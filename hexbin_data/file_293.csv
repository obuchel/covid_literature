1419,1419,1419,"Prevalence and correlates of influenza-a in piggery workers and pigs in two communities in Lagos, Nigeria",19.910727,7.221512,2013-11-17,"INTRODUCTION: Worldwide, three Influenza-A virus subtypes (H1N1, H1N2 and H3N2) in swine are major public health issues. In Nigeria, the existence of these subtypes in pigs has not been well studied. This study aimed at determining the prevalence and correlates of Influenza-A viruses circulating in piggery workers and pigs in Oke-aro and Goshen communities in Lagos, Nigeria. METHODS: Nasal swabs were taken from 197 consenting piggery workers and 281 randomly selected pigs to determine the prevalence of Influenza-A (H1, H3, H5) using Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction test (gene M). An interviewer administered questionnaire was used to collect information on demography, Influenza-A related symptoms experienced, personal hygiene and management practices from the piggery workers. Descriptive statistics was used and chi square test performed at 5% significant level. RESULTS: All piggery workers and pigs’ nasal swabs tested negative for Influenza-A viruses, hence, association could not be tested. Mean age of piggery workers was 41 ± 13.6 years and 60% were females. Forty two percent were farm attendants, 38.0% were pig farmers and the rest butchers. Nineteen percent had history of headache; 14.0% had catarrh and cough; 4.0% had sore-throat; 5.0% had diarrhea; while 48.0% had muscle pain at the time of data collection. The mean body temperature for the pig workers was 36.5 ± 0.5 °C. A significant difference (p<0.05) existed among piggery workers who had muscle pains. CONCLUSION: Piggery workers and pigs in study area were free of Influenza-A (H1, H3, H5) viruses. The current practices of the piggery workers should be encouraged.","Awosanya, Emmanuel Jolaoluwa; Ogundipe, Gabriel; Babalobi, Olutayo; Omilabu, Sunday",Pan Afr Med J,293,22

METHODS: Eight electronic databases (Embase, PubMed, Medline, CINAHL, PsycInfo, PsycArticles, The Psychology and Behavioural Sciences Collection, and Google Scholar) were searched. All study designs were included, and no date limits were set. Studies were included if they were published in English, and explored the psychological health of any EDC operatives, across fire, police, and emergency medical services. Studies were excluded if they related solely to other emergency workers, such as police officers or paramedics. Methodological quality of included studies was assessed using checklists adapted from the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme. A narrative synthesis was conducted, using thematic analysis. RESULTS: A total of 16 articles were included in the review. Two overarching themes were identified during the narrative synthesis: ‘Organisational and Operational Factors’ and ‘Interactions with Others’. Stressors identified included being exposed to traumatic calls, lacking control over high workload, and working in under-resourced and pressured environments. Lack of support from management and providing an emotionally demanding service were additional sources of stress. Peer support and social support from friends and family were helpful in managing work-related stress. DISCUSSION: EDC operatives experience stress as a result of their work, which appears to be related to negative psychological health outcomes. Future research should explore the long-term effects of this stress, and the potential for workplace interventions to alleviate the negative impacts on psychological health.

Scientists have clarified the physicochemical properties and functions of the different components of surfactant, and part of this successful research is derived from the characterization of genetic diseases affecting surfactant composition or function. Knowledge from functional tests of surfactant action, its immunochemistry, kinetics and homeostasis are important also for improving therapy with animal-derived surfactant preparations and for the development of modified surfactants. In the past decade newly designed artificial surfactants and additives have gained much attention and have proven different advantages, but their particular role still has to be defined. For clinical practice, alternative administration techniques as well as postsurfactant ventilation modes, taking into account alterations in lung mechanics after surfactant placement, may be important in optimizing the potential of this most important drug in neonatology.","Hentschel, Roland; Bohlin, Kajsa; van Kaam, Anton; Fuchs, Hans; Danhaive, Olivier",Pediatr Res,293,1

Success was viewed rather narrowly as the women leaving the relationship, setting up ‘all-or-nothing’ outcomes. Such ‘success’ led to counsellor happiness, whilst failure in this regard led to counsellors experiencing anger and burn-out. We conclude that the conundrums evident in these data are grounded in patriarchal systems, limiting the efficacy of counselling based on a bondage and deliverance narrative.

OBJECTIVES: Our objective was to investigate the overall safety profile and incidence rate of AEs of special interest (AESIs), including serious infections and tuberculosis, in CT-P13-treated patients. METHODS: Data were pooled from six observational studies representing authorised indications of CT-P13 (ankylosing spondylitis, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, plaque psoriasis, adult and paediatric Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis). Patients were analysed by indication and treatment (patients who received CT-P13 or those who switched from reference infliximab to CT-P13 ≤ 6 months prior to enrolment or during the study). RESULTS: Overall, 4393 patients were included (n = 3677 CT-P13 group; n = 716 switched group); 64.03% of patients had inflammatory bowel disease and 6.31% of patients were antidrug antibody positive. Overall, 32.94% and 9.58% of patients experienced treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) and treatment-emergent serious AEs, respectively. Across indications, TEAEs were more frequent with CT-P13 than with the switched group. Infections including tuberculosis were the most frequent serious AESI overall (2.48%) and by treatment group or indication. In total, 14 patients (0.32%) reported active tuberculosis. Overall incidence rates per 100 patient-years (95% confidence interval) were 3.40 (2.788–4.096) for serious infections including tuberculosis and 0.44 (0.238–0.732) for active tuberculosis. Infusion-related reactions were the second most frequent AESI following infection including tuberculosis. CONCLUSION: The CT-P13 safety profile appears consistent with previous studies for CT-P13 and reference infliximab, supporting the favourable risk/benefit balance for CT-P13 treatment.

Eight studies (three randomized clinical trial (RCT), one retrospective studies, two case-control studies, and two prospective studies) involving 468 patients, including 230 Mg screws and 213 Titanium (Ti) screws, were analyzed. The meta-analysis did not show any significant differences when comparing the use of Mg and Ti screws for complications (p = 0.868). The estimated complication rate was 13.3% (95% CI: 8.3% to 20.6%) for the comparison group who received an absorbable Mg screw. The use of absorbable metals is feasible for clinical applications in bone surgery with equivalent outcomes to standard metal fixation devices.","Sukotjo, Cortino; Lima-Neto, Tiburtino J.; Santiago Júnior, Joel Fereira; Faverani, Leonardo P.; Miloro, Michael",Materials (Basel),293,1

The aim of this study was to detect the resistance rate of Klebsiella pneumoniae Iraqi isolates toward quinolone antimicrobial agents, to determine genetic mutations in gyrA and parC, to screen for efflux-pump activity, and to screen the presence of plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance (PMQR) genes. METHODS: Forty-three K. pneumoniae isolates were confirmed phenotypically and genotypically by Vitek 2 system and species specific primers by PCR using the targeting rpo gene followed by sequencing. Antibiotic susceptibility test was carried out using disc diffusion method. Quinolone resistant isolates were subjected to ciprofloxacin MIC testing, and cartwheel method to screen for efflux pump activity. The presence of the plasmid mediated quinolone resistance genes qepA, qnrB, qnrS, and aac(6)Ib was tested by PCR. Sequencing of gyrA and parC was performed. RESULTS: We observed a high rate of resistance to ceftriaxone, gentamicin ciprofloxacin, and levofloxacin. Low rate of resistance was detected against amikacin and azithromycin. Ciprofloxacin MIC results revealed that 96.1% of the isolates had MICs >256 µg/mL, 83.4% had MICs >512 µg/mL while 34.6% had MIC >1024 µg/mL. Testing of isolates against ciprofloxacin mixed with EtBr at various concentrations resulted in decreased resistant. Sequencing results showed that Ser83Leu was the most common mutation in gyrA that was observed in all quinolone resistant isolates, followed by Asp87Asn. Ser80Ile mutation in parC was observed in 77.7% of the tested isolates. The prevalence of PMQR genes was 92.5% aac (6)-Ib, 51.8% qnrB, 40.7% qepA, and 37% qnrS. CONCLUSION: Quinolone resistance is common in K. pneumoniae isolates in Baghdad. The frequent mutation in gyrA and parC, and the presence of PMQR genes is alarming.","Kareem, Sawsan Mohammed; Al-kadmy, Israa M S; Kazaal, Saba S; Mohammed Ali, Alaa N; Aziz, Sarah Naji; Makharita, Rabab R; Algammal, Abdelazeem M; Al-Rejaie, Salim; Behl, Tapan; Batiha, Gaber El-Saber; El-Mokhtar, Mohamed A; Hetta, Helal F",Infect Drug Resist,293,12

While senolytics can improve aging in humans as well as mice by specifically eliminating senescent cells, the effect of the senolytics varies in different cell types, suggesting variations in senescence. Various factors can induce cellular senescence, and the rate of accumulation of senescent cells differ depending on the organ. In addition, since the heterogeneity is due to the spatiotemporal context of senescent cells, in vivo studies are needed to increase the understanding of senescent cells. Since current methods are often unable to distinguish senescent cells from other cells, efforts are being made to find markers commonly expressed in senescent cells using bulk RNA-sequencing. Moreover, single-cell RNA (scRNA) sequencing, which analyzes the transcripts of each cell, has been utilized to understand the in vivo characteristics of the rare senescent cells. Recently, transcriptomic cell atlases for each organ using this technology have been published in various species. Novel senescent cells that do not express previously established marker genes have been discovered in some organs. However, there is still insufficient information on senescent cells due to the limited throughput of the scRNA sequencing technology. Therefore, it is necessary to improve the throughput of the scRNA sequencing technology or develop a way to enrich the rare senescent cells. The in vivo senescent cell atlas that is established using rapidly developing single-cell technologies will contribute to the precise rejuvenation by specifically removing senescent cells in each tissue and individual.","Kim, Sohee; Kim, Chuna",Mol Cells,293,22

METHODS: Genome-wide association (GWA) analyses were performed using data from the Kaiser Permanente Research Board (KPRB) and the UK Biobank. ACL and PCL injury cases were identified based on electronic health records from KPRB and the UK Biobank. GWA analyses from both cohorts were tested for ACL and PCL injury using a logistic regression model adjusting for sex, height, weight, age at enrolment, and race/ethnicity using allele counts for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The data from the two GWA studies were combined in a meta-analysis. Candidate genes previously reported to show an association with ACL injury in athletes were also tested for association from the meta-analysis data from the KPRB and the UK Biobank GWA studies. RESULTS: There was a total of 2,214 cases of ACL and PCL injury and 519,869 controls within the two cohorts, with three loci demonstrating a genome-wide significant association in the meta-analysis: INHBA, AEBP2, and LOC101927869.

One such proposal is that the population frequencies of the so-called “derived” alleles of two genes involved in brain growth and development, ASPM and Microcephalin, are related to the probability of speaking a tone language or not. The original study introducing this proposal used a cross-linguistic statistical approach, showing that these associations are “special” when compared with many other possible relationships between genetic variants and linguistic features. Recent experimental evidence supports strongly a negative effect of the “derived” allele of ASPM on tone perception and/or processing within individuals, but failed to find any effect for Microcephalin. Motivated by these experimental findings, I conduct here a cross-linguistic statistical test, using a larger and updated dataset of 175 samples from 129 unique (meta)populations, and a battery of methods including mixed-effects regression (Bayesian and maximum-likelihood), mediation and path analysis, decision trees and random forests, using permutations and restricted sampling to control for the confounding effects of genealogy (language families) and contact (macroareas). Overall, the results support a negative weak effect of ASPM-D against the presence of tone above and beyond the strong confounding influences of genealogy and contact, but they suggest that the original association between tone and MCPH1 might have been a false positive, explained by differences between populations and languages within and outside Africa. Thus, these cross-linguistic population-scale statistical results are fully consonant with the inter-individual-level experimental results, and suggest that the observed linguistic diversity may be, at least in some cases, partly driven by genetic diversity.","Dediu, Dan",PLoS One,293,1

One of the contributing factors for these problems is cultural malpractices during pregnancy and childbirth. The actual incidence of cultural malpractices in developing countries accounts for about 5–15% of maternal deaths. Thus, understanding the link between cultural affairs and maternal health is critical to saving the lives of women and their babies. Therefore, this research was aimed to assess cultural malpractices during labor and delivery and associated factors among women who had at least one history of delivery in selected Zones of the Amhara region, North West Ethiopia. METHOD: Community based cross-sectional study was conducted on women who had at least one delivery history in Awi, West, and East Gojjam Zones from January 1 to May 30, 2020. The multistage cluster sampling technique was used to select 845 study participants. Data was collected through a pre-tested and structured interview questionnaire, entered and cleaned using EPI info version 7.2, and exported to SPSS version 23 for analysis. Bivariable and multivariable logistic regression was employed to assess the association of the variables and a P-value less than 0.05 was declared as statistically significant. RESULT: Out of 845 women 162(19.2%) practiced nutritional taboo, 77(9.1%) women practiced abdominal massage and 273(32.3%) delivered their babies at home.

CONCLUSION: This study showed that cultural malpractices during childbirth were high in Awi, West, and East Gojjam Zones relative to the country's maternal health service utilization plan. Working on antenatal care follow-up and women and husband education in a culturally acceptable manner may reduce cultural malpractices during labor and delivery.","Melesse, Misganaw Fikrie; Bitewa, Yibelu Bazezew; Dessie, Kumneger Nigussie; Wondim, Demeke Binalf; Bereka, Tefera Marie",BMC Pregnancy Childbirth,293,1

However, only a handful of studies have examined the association between health literacy and frailty status. The current study used data from a nationwide sample of Korean adults aged 70–84 collected from 10 cities, each of which represents a different region of South Korea (n = 1521). We used the propensity score matching (PSM) method to minimize the potential selection bias and confounding factors that are present in observational studies. After PSM, demographic and health-related characteristics between the limited health literacy (n = 486) and the nonlimited health literacy (n = 486) groups were not significantly different. Multinomial logistic regression analyses were conducted for the PSM-matched sample to examine the association between health literacy and frailty outcomes, where the robust group was set as a reference. Limited health literacy significantly increased the risk of pre-frailty (RRR = 1.45, p = 0.02) and frailty (RRR = 2.03, p = 0.01) after adjusting for demographic and health-related factors.

The viral factors involved in the different clinical manifestations of infected individuals are still unknown, and in this sense, sequencing technologies can support viral genome studies, contributing to a better understanding of infection outcome. Currently, several sequencing technologies are available with different approaches. To understand the methodological advances in the HTLV-1 field, it is necessary to organize a synthesis by a rigorous review. This systematic literature review describes different technologies used to generate HTLV-1 sequences. The review follows the PRISMA guidelines, and the search for articles was performed in PubMed, Lilacs, Embase, and SciELO databases. From the 574 articles found in search, 62 were selected. The articles showed that, even with the emergence of new sequencing technologies, the traditional Sanger method continues to be the most commonly used methodology for generating HTLV-1 genome sequences. There are many questions that remain unanswered in the field of HTLV-1 research, and this reflects on the small number of studies using next-generation sequencing technologies, which could help address these gaps. The data compiled and analyzed here can help research on HTLV-1, assisting in the choice of sequencing technologies.","de Oliveira Andrade, Felipe; Cucco, Marina Silveira; Borba, Melina Mosquera Navarro; Neto, Reinaldo Conceição; Gois, Luana Leandro; de Almeida Rego, Filipe Ferreira; Santos, Luciane Amorim; Barreto, Fernanda Khouri",Arch Virol,293,1

Identifying the decisive factors for disease outcomes and progression is crucial to elucidate the macrophages-tuberculosis interaction and provide insights into therapeutic strategies. To achieve this goal, we first model the disease progression as a dynamical shift among different disease outcomes, which are characterized by various steady states of bacterial concentration. The causal mechanisms of steady-state transitions can be the occurrence of transcritical and saddle-node bifurcations, which are induced by slowly changing parameters. Transcritical bifurcation, occurring when the basic reproduction number equals to one, determines whether the infection clears or spreads. Saddle-node bifurcation is the key mechanism to create and destroy steady states. Based on these two steady-state transition mechanisms, we carry out two sample-based sensitivity analyses on transcritical bifurcation conditions and saddle-node bifurcation conditions. The sensitivity analysis results suggest that the macrophage apoptosis rate is the most significant factor affecting the transition in disease outcomes. This result agrees with the discovery that the programmed cell death (apoptosis) plays a unique role in the complex microorganism-host interplay. Sensitivity analysis narrows down the parameters of interest, but cannot answer how these parameters influence the model outcomes. To do this, we employ bifurcation analysis and numerical simulation to unfold various disease outcomes induced by the variation of macrophage apoptosis rate. Our findings support the hypothesis that the regulation mechanism of macrophage apoptosis affects the host immunity against tuberculosis infection and tuberculosis virulence. Moreover, our mathematical results suggest that new treatments and/or vaccines that regulate macrophage apoptosis in combination with weakening bacillary viability and/or promoting adaptive immunity could have therapeutic value.

One ecological variable that is rarely considered but may contribute substantially to microbiome variation is the multifaceted nature of human-animal interfaces. We present the hypothesis that different interactions with animals contribute to shaping the human microbiome globally. We utilize a One Health framework to explore how changes in microbial exposure from human-animal interfaces shape the microbiome and, in turn, contribute to differential human health across populations, focusing on commensal and pathogen exposure, changes in colonization resistance and immune system training, and the potential for other functional shifts. Although human-animal interfaces are known to underlie human health and particularly infectious disease disparities, since their impact on the human microbiome remains woefully understudied, we propose foci for future research. We believe it will be crucial to understand this critical aspect of biology and its impacts on human health around the globe.","Kuthyar, Sahana; Reese, Aspen T.",,293,27

This growth can be contributed to multiple factors, including hardware and software advances that have allowed the acquisition of high‐resolution volumetric data of RT patients in their treatment position (also known as MR simulation) and the development of methods to image and quantify tissue function and response to therapy. More recently, the advent of MR‐guided radiation therapy (MRgRT) ‐ achieved through the integration of MR imaging systems and linear accelerators ‐ has further accelerated this trend. As MR imaging in RT techniques and technologies, such as MRgRT, gain regulatory approval worldwide, these systems will begin to propagate beyond tertiary care academic medical centers and into more community‐based health systems and hospitals, creating new opportunities to provide advanced treatment options to a broader patient population. Accompanying these opportunities are unique challenges related to their adaptation, adoption, and use including modification of hardware and software to meet the unique and distinct demands of MR imaging in RT, the need for standardization of imaging techniques and protocols, education of the broader RT community (particularly in regards to MR safety) as well as the need to continue and support research, and development in this space. In response to this, an ad hoc committee of the American Association of Physicists in Medicine (AAPM) was formed to identify the unmet needs, roadblocks, and opportunities within this space.

Here, we review the current evidence of ILC2-mediated modulation of neuroinflammatory cues (i.e., IL-33, IL-25, IL-5, IL-13, IL-10, TNFα, and CXCL16-CXCR6) within the CNS, highlight the distribution of ILC2s in both the periphery and CNS, and discuss some challenges associated with cell type-specific targeting that are important for therapeutics. A comprehensive understanding of the roles of ILC2s in mediating and responding to inflammatory cues may provide valuable insight into potential therapeutic strategies for many dementia-related disorders.","Yeung, Sherry Sin-Hang; Ho, Yuen-Shan; Chang, Raymond Chuen-Chung",Exp Mol Med,293,27

Studies on therapeutic administration of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in ALI caused by the viral infection have been limited in number and have shown conflicting results. The aim of the present investigation is to evaluate the therapeutic potential of MSC administration in A/H5N1-caused ALI, using a mouse model. METHODS: MSCs were prepared from the bone marrow of 9 to 12 week-old BALB/c mice. An H5N1 virus of A/turkey/East Java/Av154/2013 was intranasally inoculated into BALB/c mice. On days 2, 4, and 6 after virus inoculation, MSCs were intravenously administered into the mice. To evaluate effects of the treatment, we examined for lung alveolar protein as an indicator for lung injury, PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio for lung functioning, and lung histopathology. Expressions of NF-κB, RAGE (transmembrane receptor for damage associated molecular patterns), TNFα, IL-1β, Sftpc (alveolar cell type II marker), and Aqp5+ (alveolar cell type I marker) were examined by immunohistochemistry. In addition, body weight, virus growth in lung and brain, and duration of survival were measured. RESULTS: The administration of MSCs lowered the level of lung damage in the virus-infected mice, as shown by measuring lung alveolar protein, PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio, and histopathological score. In the MSC-treated group, the expressions of NF-κB, RAGE, TNFα, and IL-1β were significantly suppressed in comparison with a mock-treated group, while those of Sftpc and Aqp5+ were enhanced. Body weight, virus growth, and survival period were not significantly different between the groups. CONCLUSION: The administration of MSCs prevented further lung injury and inflammation, and enhanced alveolar cell type II and I regeneration, while it did not significantly affect viral proliferation and mouse morbidity and mortality. The results suggested that MSC administration was a promissing strategy for treatment of acute lung injuries caused by the highly pathogenic avian influenza A/H5N1 virus, although further optimization and combination use of anti-viral drugs will be obviously required to achieve the goal of reducing mortality.","Yudhawati, Resti; Amin, Muhammad; Rantam, Fedik A.; Prasetya, Rima R.; Dewantari, Jezzy R.; Nastri, Aldise M.; Poetranto, Emmanuel D.; Wulandari, Laksmi; Lusida, Maria I.; Koesnowidagdo, Soetjipto; Soegiarto, Gatot; Shimizu, Yohko K.; Mori, Yasuko; Shimizu, Kazufumi",BMC Infect Dis,293,1

Differences in the rate of decline are revealed, due not only to the severity of quarantine measures, which affected the consumption indicators, but also the structure of the regional economy, which strongly influenced the industrial production dynamics and budget revenues. The rapid increase in the level of registered unemployment in almost all regions is due to the impact of quarantine restrictions on the market services sector, which is the most developed in large cities, as well as institutional measures (increase in the size of benefits and streamlined registration). The regional dynamics of the main indicators during the three crises of the 2000s are compared and significant differences are revealed in the distribution of regions by the rate of decline. The regional profile of each crisis was different due to its factors, risk zones, duration, and depth of the decline. The coronavirus crisis is aggravated by the fact that in most regions, the decline of the previous crisis in 2015 has not yet been compensated, which may lead to a protracted recovery from the 2020 crisis.","Zubarevich, N.

We aimed to develop a nomogram to predict the FEV(1)/FVC ratio and the presence of COPD. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the data of 4241 adult patients who underwent spirometry between 2013 and 2019. By linear regression analysis, variables associated with FEV(1)/FVC were identified in the training cohort (n = 2969). Using the variables as predictors, a nomogram was created to predict the FEV(1)/FVC ratio and validated in the test cohort (n = 1272). RESULTS: Older age (β coefficient [95% CI], − 0.153 [− 0.183, − 0.122]), male sex (− 1.904 [− 2.749, − 1.056]), current or past smoking history (− 3.324 [− 4.200, − 2.453]), and the presence of dyspnea (− 2.453 [− 3.612, − 1.291]) or overweight (0.894 [0.191, 1.598]) were significantly associated with the FEV(1)/FVC ratio. In the final testing, the developed nomogram showed a mean absolute error of 8.2% between the predicted and actual FEV(1)/FVC ratios. The overall performance was best when FEV(1)/FVC < 70% was used as a diagnostic criterion for COPD; the sensitivity, specificity, and balanced accuracy were 82.3%, 68.6%, and 75.5%, respectively. CONCLUSION: The developed nomogram could be used to identify potential patients at risk of COPD who may need further evaluation, especially in the primary care setting where spirometry is not available.","Lee, Sang Chul; An, Chansik; Yoo, Jongha; Park, Sungho; Shin, Donggyo; Han, Chang Hoon",BMC Pulm Med,293,33

An imbalance between vasoconstriction and vasodilation has been proposed as the mechanism of PAH. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which catalyzes the hydrolysis of the vasoconstrictor angiotensin (Ang) II into the vasodilator Ang-(1-7), has been shown to be an important regulator of blood pressure and cardiovascular diseases. Herein we hypothesized diminazene aceturate (DIZE), an ACE2 activator, could ameliorate the development of PAH and pulmonary vascular remodeling. Methods: A murine model of PAH was established using left pneumonectomy (PNx) on day 0 followed by injection of a single dose of the VEGF receptor-2 inhibitor SU5416 (25 mg/kg) subcutaneously on day 1. All hemodynamic and biochemical measurements were done at the end of the study on day 42. Animals were divided into 4 groups (n = 6–8/group): (1) sham-operated group, (2) vehicle-treatment group (SuPNx(42)), (3) early treatment group (SuPNx(42)/DIZE(1−42)) with DIZE at 15 mg/kg/day, subcutaneously from day 1 to day 42, and (4) late treatment group (SuPNx(42)/DIZE(29−42)) with DIZE from days 29–42. Results: In both the early and late treatment groups, DIZE significantly attenuated the mean pulmonary artery pressure, pulmonary arteriolar remodeling, and right ventricle brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), as well as reversed the overexpression of ACE while up-regulating the expression of Ang-(1-7) when compared with the vehicle-treatment group. In addition, the early treatment group also significantly decreased plasma BNP and increased the expression of eNOS. Conclusions: ACE2 activator has therapeutic potentials for preventing and attenuating the development of PAH in an animal model of left pneumonectomy combined with VEGF inhibition. Activation of ACE2 may thus be a useful therapeutic strategy for the treatment of human PAH.","Chen, I-Chen; Lin, Jao-Yu; Liu, Yi-Ching; Chai, Chee-Yin; Yeh, Jwu-Lai; Hsu, Jong-Hau; Wu, Bin-Nan; Dai, Zen-Kong",Front Med (Lausanne),293,1

Based on the distinct patterns of errors and substitution patterns in their speech samples, effects of phonological universals in the format of constraints, including tone markedness scales (TMS), tone-position constraints (TPC) and the obligatory contour principle (OCP), are studied. Comparisons are made between the findings about tonal acquisition made in previous studies on lower-level learners and the higher-level learners in this study. With these error data, analyses and comparisons, I argue that some effects of the above-mentioned universals are still visible (TMS and T4-T4 OCP) while others are masked. It is a special configuration of the coarticulation rule applying to T2-T4 and T2-T1 combinations that really distinguishes the tonal system found in these very advanced learners from that of the other learners and that of the native speakers of Mandarin. Pedagogical practices that are designed to re-configure this rule will allow learners at this stage of tone acquisition to proceed into native-like speech production.","Song, Chenqing",The Acquisition of Chinese as a Second Language Pronunciation,293,32

In such an environment, the risk related to incidents involving the use of CBRN (Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear) agents must be considered a cause of potentially devastating consequences. Non-proliferation and disarmament operations can make an essential contribution to combat terrorism by preventing or reducing the access of non-state actors or non-authorised persons to chemicals, biological and nuclear dual-use materials but this could be not enough. Illicit proliferation of chemical weapons, clandestine production of toxins and biological agents, ‘dirty bombs’ and trafficking of fissile material are just some examples of the use of CBRN agents for terrorist purposes. This chapter argues that, in order to address these issues, the integration of human, instrumental, technological and financial resources should be improved and reinforced. For that purpose, an effective strategy to mitigate and reduce the risk of using CBRN materials requires a high level of coordination across national agencies.

Data from 1079 students aged 14–16 included mathematics achievement, survey measures of attitudes towards mathematics, perceived parental attitudes towards mathematics, newly developed scales for cultural capital and habitus, and social class. There was a very strong relationship between student’s attitudes towards mathematics and students’ perceptions of their parents’ attitudes towards mathematics. Middle-class students reported more positive attitudes towards mathematics, more positive perceived parental attitudes towards mathematics, and had higher mathematics achievement than working-class students. Cultural capital had a significant positive effect on students’ attitudes towards mathematics but a minor effect on their achievement in mathematics. However, cultural capital’s effect on students’ attitudes and achievement in mathematics faded when habitus was included in the model. We suggest that habitus may play a more central role than cultural capital in the reproduction of mathematics inequalities. School quality had a modest but significant impact on mathematics outcomes in this study, so we argue that challenges to mathematics inequalities will require changes both within and outside of mathematics classrooms.

We sought to develop and evaluate a blended curriculum of interactive online modules with small-group discussion to enhance the educational experience for medical students in urology. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We created a curriculum of four online case-based urology modules. Between July and October 2020, 14 fourth-year medical students completed the modules. Students answered questions on a discussion board and engaged in asynchronous dialogue with 16 physicians, in addition to a weekly live review session. Students and physicians completed anonymous surveys to assess satisfaction and perceived learning outcomes, with questions scored on a 5-point Likert scale. RESULTS: Thirteen students (93% response rate) and 12 physicians (75% response rate) completed the survey. Overall, 12/13 students and 11/12 physicians “strongly agree” or “somewhat agree” that the modules improved the rotation. Students and physicians perceived that the modules were effective for learning/teaching foundational knowledge (average ratings 4.8 and 4.5, respectively) and facilitating performance assessment (4.4 and 4.0). Students reported high learning scores across multiple Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education core competencies, and 12/13 students found the modules fun/engaging.

Recurrent or complicated diverticulitis of the sigmoid colon is a frequent indication for minimally invasive sigmoid colectomy. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of obesity on the outcome of SILS sigmoid colectomy. METHODS From September 2009 to October 2014, data from 377 patients who had intended SILS sigmoid colectomy for diverticulitis at our institution were collected in a prospective database. The patients were categorized in the following subgroups: group 1 (normal weight, body mass index (BMI) < 25 kg/m(2)), group 2 (overweight, BMI 25-29.9 kg/m(2)), group 3 (obesity, BMI 30-34.9 kg/m(2)), and group 4 (morbid obesity, BMI > 35 kg/m(2)). RESULTS The groups were equivalent for sex, age, status of diverticulitis, the presence of acute inflammation in the specimen, and the percentage of teaching operations, but the percentage of patients with accompanying diseases was significantly more frequent in groups 2, 3, and 4 (p = 0.04, 0.008, and 0.018, respectively). As compared to group 1, the conversion rate was significantly increased in groups 2 and 4 (2.3 vs. 9.3% (p = 0.013) and 2.3 vs. 12.5% (p = 0.017), respectively). The duration of surgery, hospitalization, and morbidity did not differ between the four groups. CONCLUSION Up to a body mass index of 35 kg/m(2), increased body weight does not significantly reduce the feasibility and outcome of single-incision laparoscopic surgery for diverticulitis.","Rink, Andreas D; Vestweber, Boris; Hahn, Jasmina; Alfes, Angelika; Paul, Claudia; Vestweber, Karl-Heinz",Langenbeck's archives of surgery,293,24

We estimated that the fraction of app-notified individuals subsequently showing symptoms and testing positive (the secondary attack rate, SAR) was 6.0%, comparable to the SAR for manually traced close contacts. We estimated the number of cases averted by the app using two complementary approaches. Modelling based on the notifications and SAR gave 284,000 (108,000-450,000), and statistical comparison of matched neighbouring local authorities gave 594,000 (317,000-914,000). Roughly one case was averted for each case consenting to notification of their contacts. We estimated that for every percentage point increase in app users, the number of cases can be reduced by 0.8% (modelling) or 2.3% (statistical analysis). These findings provide evidence for continued development and deployment of such apps in populations that are awaiting full protection from vaccines.","Wymant, Chris; Ferretti, Luca; Tsallis, Daphne; Charalambides, Marcos; Abeler-Dörner, Lucie; Bonsall, David; Hinch, Robert; Kendall, Michelle; Milsom, Luke; Ayres, Matthew; Holmes, Chris; Briers, Mark; Fraser, Christophe",Nature,293,12

However, whether copy number variants (CNVs) in PCP genes contribute to NTDs is unknown. Considering that CNVs are implicated in several human developmental disorders, we hypothesized that CNVs in PCP genes may be causative factors to human NTDs. DNA from umbilical cord tissues of NTD-affected fetuses and parental venous blood samples were collected. We performed a quantitative analysis of copy numbers of all exon regions in the VANGL1, VANGL2, CELSR1, SCRIB, DVL2, DVL3, and PTK7 genes using a CNVplex assay. Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) was carried out to confirm the results of CNV analysis. As a result, 16 CNVs were identified among the NTDs. Of these CNVs, 5 loci were identified in 11 NTD probands with CNVs involving DVL2 (exons 1-15), VANGL1 (exons 1-7, exon 8), and VANGL2 (exons 5-8, exons 7 and 8). One CNV (DVL2 exons 1-15) was a duplication and the remaining 15 CNVs were deletions. Eleven CNVs were confirmed by qPCR. One de novo CNV in VANGL1 and one DVL2 were detected from two cases. Compared with unaffected control populations in 1000 Genome, ExAC, MARRVEL, DGV, and dbVar databases, the frequencies of de novo deletion in VANGL1 (1.14%) and de novo duplication in DVL2 (0.57%) were significantly higher in our NTD subjects (p < 0.05). This study demonstrates that de novo CNVs in PCP genes, notably deletions in VANGL1 and gains in DVL2, could contribute to the risk of NTDs.","Tian, Tian; Lei, Yunping; Chen, Yongyan; Guo, Yinnan; Jin, Lei; Finnell, Richard H; Wang, Linlin; Ren, Aiguo",Neurogenetics,293,31

METHODS Overall, 43 consecutive infants with PIVHH were included. Most were extremely LBWIs (n = 39). Other cases included very LBWIs (n = 2) and full-term infants (n = 2). VL therapy involved continuous external ventricular drainage (EVD) management using a very fine catheter and intermittent slow injection of 6000 IU of UK every 3-6 h to actively dissolve hematomas. RESULTS Early EVD management (within 3 weeks of IVH onset) was performed in 25 infants, with combination VL therapy in 21 infants. Five initiated late EVD management (≥ 3 weeks after IVH onset); the remaining 13 were treated conservatively for several weeks, delaying surgical intervention. Eighteen of 21 (86%) infants who received VL therapy did not require permanent shunt surgery. There were no serious complications, including the absence of secondary hemorrhage and infection. Two-thirds of the infants treated in the late stages required permanent shunt, and various shunt-related complications frequently occurred. A good outcome occurred in 13/17 infants in the early treatment group, despite most subjects having an IVH grade IV, and in 6/15 in the late treatment group. CONCLUSIONS Permanent shunt surgery needs were dramatically reduced following early VL therapy, and functional outcomes were favorable. VL therapy might be a promising strategy that could lead to the development of new treatments for PIVHH.","Park, Young-Soo; Kotani, Yukiko; Kim, Tae Kyun; Yokota, Hiroshi; Sugimoto, Tadashi; Nakagawa, Ichiro; Motoyama, Yasushi; Nakase, Hiroyuki",Child's nervous system : ChNS : official journal of the International Society for Pediatric Neurosurgery,293,31

During the co-digestion, the test reactor received a mixture of GTW and MWS while the control reactor received only MWS. The test digester loading was increased incrementally to a maximum of 280% of the control digester COD loading. The highest feasible GTW loading was determined to be 23% and 58% in terms of its total 1.58 kg VS/(m(3) d) and 3.99 kg COD/(m(3) d) loadings, respectively. This test digester COD loading represented 240% of the control digester COD loading. At this loading, test digester biogas production was 67% greater than that of the control. During the test digester quasi steady state loading period when VS from GTW represented 19% of its total VS loading, the test digester COD and VS removal rates were 2.5 and 1.5 fold those of the control digester, respectively. The test digester biogas production declined markedly when the percentage of VS from GTW in its feed was increased to 30% of its total VS loading. Causes of the reduced biogas production were investigated and attributed to inhibition due to long chain fatty acid accumulation.","Razaviarani, Vahid; Buchanan, Ian D; Malik, Shahid; Katalambula, Hassan",Journal of environmental management,293,16

Intraoperative anesthetic depth may impact recovery, but the impact of brain monitoring on time to extubation and intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay after cardiac surgery has not been extensively studied. Our goal was to determine if BIS-guided anesthesia improves time to extubation compared to MAC-guided anesthesia in a cardiac surgery population. METHODS In this secondary outcome analysis of a randomized controlled study, we analyzed 294 patients undergoing elective coronary bypass grafting, valve replacements, and bypass plus valve replacements at a single tertiary referral center between February 1, 2009 and April 30, 2010. We analyzed cardiac surgery patients that had been randomized to BIS-guided anesthesia alerts (n = 131) or MAC-guided anesthesia alerts (n = 163). The primary outcome measure was time to extubation in the BIS-guided and anesthetic concentration-guided groups. Secondary outcomes were length of stay in the ICU and total postoperative hospital length of stay. RESULTS Valid extubation time data were available for 247 of 294 patients. The median [IQR] time to extubation was 307 [215 to 771] minutes in the BIS group and 323 [196 to 730] minutes in the anesthetic concentration group (p = 0.61). The median [IQR] ICU length of stay was 54 [29 to 97] hours versus 70 [44 to 99] hours (p = 0.11). In terms of postoperative hospital length of stay, there was no difference between the groups with median [IQR] times of 6 [5-8] days (p = 0.69) in each group. CONCLUSIONS The use of intraoperative BIS monitoring during cardiac surgery did not change time to extubation, ICU length of stay or hospital length of stay. Data regarding BIS monitoring and recovery in an exclusively cardiac surgery population are consistent with recent effectiveness studies in the general surgical population.

MATERIALS AND METHODS We conducted a retrospective cohort study, which included 356 patients with 556 HCCs that were inconspicuous on B-mode US. A total of 192 patients with 344 HCCs, 123 patients with 155 HCCs, and 37 patients with 57 HCCs underwent RFA under CEUS guidance, fusion imaging guidance, and the combination of CEUS and fusion imaging guidance. RESULTS The average number of treatment sessions was 1.1 (range: 1-2) in the CEUS guidance group, 1.1 (range: 1-2) in the fusion imaging guidance group, and 1.1 (range: 1-3) in the combination of CEUS and fusion imaging guidance group. Treatment analysis did not reveal significantly more RFA treatment sessions in the combination guidance group than in the other groups (p = 0.97, Student's t test). During the follow-up period (1.1-85.3 months, mean ± SD, 43.2 ± 59.5), the 3-year local tumor progression rates were 4.9, 7.2, and 5.9% in the CEUS guidance group, the fusion imaging guidance group, and the combination guidance group, respectively (p = 0.84, log-rank test). CONCLUSION In spite of selection bias, session frequency and local tumor progression were not different under the combination guidance with CEUS and fusion imaging in RFA. The combination of fusion imaging and CEUS guidance in RFA therapy is an effective treatment for HCC with poor conspicuity on B-mode US and CEUS/fusion imaging.","Minami, Tomohiro; Minami, Yasunori; Chishina, Hirokazu; Arizumi, Tadaaki; Takita, Masahiro; Kitai, Satoshi; Yada, Norihisa; Inoue, Tatsuo; Hagiwara, Satoru; Ueshima, Kazuomi; Nishida, Naoshi; Kudo, Masatoshi",Oncology,293,7

Advanced HF has a high morbidity and mortality, such that early recognition of this condition is important to optimize care. Delayed referral or lack of referral in patients who are likely to derive benefit from an advanced HF evaluation can have important adverse consequences for patients and their families. A 2-step process can be used by practitioners when considering referral of a patient with advanced HF for consideration of advanced therapies, focused on recognizing the clinical clues associated with stage D HF and assessing potential benefits of referral to an advanced HF center. Although patients are often referred to an advanced HF center to undergo evaluation for advanced therapies such as heart transplantation or implantation of a left ventricular assist device, there are other reasons to refer, including access to the infrastructure and multidisciplinary team of the advanced HF center that offers a broad range of expertise. The intent of this statement is to provide a framework for practitioners and health systems to help identify and refer patients with HF who are most likely to derive benefit from referral to an advanced HF center.","Morris, Alanna A; Khazanie, Prateeti; Drazner, Mark H; Albert, Nancy M; Breathett, Khadijah; Cooper, Lauren B; Eisen, Howard J; O'Gara, Patrick; Russell, Stuart D",Circulation,293,4

Similar to other parvoviruses, it is believed that HBoV1 can persist for long periods of time in humans, probably through maintaining concatemers of the virus single-stranded DNA genome in the nuclei of infected cells. Recently, HBoV-1 was detected in high rates in adenoid and palatine tonsils samples from patients with chronic adenotonsillar diseases, but nothing is known about the virus replication levels in those tissues. A 3-year prospective hospital-based study was conducted to detect and quantify HBoV1 DNA and mRNAs in samples of the adenoids (AD), palatine tonsils (PT), nasopharyngeal secretions (NPS), and peripheral blood (PB) from patients undergoing tonsillectomy for tonsillar hypertrophy or recurrent tonsillitis. HBoV1 was detected in 25.3% of the AD samples, while the rates of detection in the PT, NPS, and PB samples were 7.2%, 10.5%, and 1.7%, respectively. The viral loads were higher in AD samples, and 27.3% of the patients with HBoV had mRNA detectable in this tissue. High viral loads and detectable mRNA in the AD were associated with HBoV1 detection in the other sample sites. The adenoids are an important site of HBoV1 replication and persistence in children with tonsillar hypertrophy. The adenoids contain high HBoV1 loads and are frequently positive for HBoV mRNA, and this is associated with the detection of HBoV1 in secretions.","Proenca-Modena, J L; Paula, F E; Buzatto, G P; Carenzi, L R; Saturno, T H; Prates, M C; Silva, M L; Delcaro, L S; Valera, F C P; Tamashiro, E; Anselmo-Lima, W T; Arruda, E",Journal of clinical microbiology,293,27

OBJECTIVES The objective of this subset analysis was to determine effect sizes of auto-servo ventilation (ASV and biphasic positive airway pressure ASV) on echocardiographic measures of diastolic function in patients with systolic HF and SDB. METHODS Thirty-two patients with stable systolic HF, concomitant diastolic dysfunction [age 66 ± 9 years old, left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction: 30 ± 7% and New York Heart Association class II: 72%] and SDB (apnea-hypopnea index, AHI: 48 ± 19/h; 53% had predominantly obstructive sleep apnea) receiving either ASV (n = 19) or optimal medical treatment (control, n = 13) were analyzed in a randomized controlled clinical trial. Polysomnographic and echocardiographic measurements were obtained at baseline and after 12 weeks. RESULTS AHI significantly improved in the ASV group compared to the control group (-39 ± 18 vs. -0.2 ± 13.2/h, p < 0.001). At baseline, 24 (75%) patients had impaired LV relaxation, and 8 (25%) had a pseudo-normalized filling pattern. At the 12-week control visit, diastolic function assessed by the isovolumetric relaxation time (-10.3 ± 26.1 vs. 9.3 ± 49.1, p = 0.48) and deceleration time (-43.9 ± 88.8 vs. 12.4 ± 68.8, p = 0.40) tended to improve after ASV treatment, but did not reach statistical significance. Likewise, the proportion of patients whose diastolic dysfunction improved was nonsignificantly higher in the ASV than in the control group, respectively (37 vs. 15%, p = 0.25). CONCLUSIONS ASV treatment efficiently abolishes SDB in patients with stable systolic HF and concomitant diastolic dysfunction, and was associated with a statistically nonsignificant improvement in measures of diastolic dysfunction. Thus, these data provide estimates of effect size and justify the evaluation of the effects of ASV on diastolic function in larger randomized controlled trials.","Birner, Christoph; Series, Frederic; Lewis, Keir; Benjamin, Amit; Wunderlich, Silke; Escourrou, Pierre; Zeman, Florian; Luigart, Ruth; Pfeifer, Michael; Arzt, Michael",Respiration; international review of thoracic diseases,293,27

In nature, they can play many different roles as antibiotics, toxins, ionophores, bioregulators, and in intra- and interspecific signaling. Their most versatile producers are differentiating filamentous fungi and actinomycetes, followed by other bacteria such as Bacillus, Pseudomonas, Myxobacteria, and Cyanobacteria. From a biotechnological point of view, bioactive metabolites have been mainly studied as potential anti-infectives (antibacterials, antifungals, antivirals, and antiparasitics). Many of them, originally discovered for their antibiotic activity, were developed further to become leading anticancer drugs, immunosuppressive agents for organ transplantation, and successful pharmaceuticals targeting metabolic and cardiovascular diseases. Old and novel antitumor antibiotics can be divided into two groups spanning diverse chemical classes: those causing some damage to the DNA such as Mitomycins (quinones), Bleomycins (glycopeptides), Actinomycins (peptides), Anthracyclines (aromatic polyketides), Pentostatin (nucleoside), Enediynes (polyketides), and Rebeccamycin derivatives (indolocarbazole glycosides)-all produced by Streptomyces strains or related genera; and the group of tubulin-targeting molecules such as plant/fungal Taxanes (terpenes), myxobacterial Epothilones (macrocyclic polyketides), and the revisited Cryptophycins (peptolides) produced by cyanobacteria. Immunosuppressive agents used in clinical practice include Cyclosporin A (cyclopeptide) and an ester of Mycophenolic acid (small aromatic polyketide), both produced by fungi, and two streptomycete macrocyclic polyketides, Sirolimus (rapamycin) and Tacrolimus (FK506). Statins include a group of fungal polyketides (Compactin or Mevastatin, Lovastatin) and their derivatives, which specifically inhibit cholesterologenesis in liver, and represent the best-selling drugs. They have been used to prevent cardiovascular diseases.","Marinelli, Flavia",Methods in enzymology,293,31

Protocol for a systematic review.",19.776636,7.05567,2020,"Adhesions can be found after virtually every abdominopelvic operation performed through standard laparotomy as well as by laparoscopic approaches. Adhesions can be completely asymptomatic or can cause significant morbidity and mortality including strangulation, obstruction, and necrosis of bowel loops and/or infertility and organ injury during repeat abdominal surgery. Perhaps because of the multifactorial nature of adhesion development, prevention has been very limited. Three anti-adhesion products are commercially available, none of which has been universally accepted as a panacea. Part of the obstacles with adhesion management is the lack of an objective clinically relevant classification to allow their study. Because a single band can cause a life-threatening bowel obstruction, whereas extensive dense intra-abdominal adhesions may be asymptomatic, neither the mere presence or absence of adhesions nor their extent if present is totally adequate endpoints. Adhesions are a major health care burden, and their reduction is a significant unmet need in surgical therapeutics facing all surgeons. Of all the parameters assessing adhesions currently available, the authors believe that adhesion incidence (presence or absence) is the most relevant endpoint with a direct clinical implication. The authors endorse the development of a validated, clinically relevant scale to assess intra-abdominal adhesions. Given the present limitation of objective assessment of adhesions and prediction of their clinical effect, the authors also advocate, when appropriate, the use of one of the Food and Drug Administration-approved adhesion barriers. Further research is required to develop safe and effective anti-adhesion methods as well as better assessment tools for their efficacy.","Diamond, Michael P; Wexner, Steven D; diZereg, Gere S; Korell, Matthias; Zmora, Oded; Van Goor, Harry; Kamar, Moshe",Surgical innovation,293,1

Clinical experience identifies unmet medical need for additional therapies for influenza, in particular to treat severely unwell adults and children. During and following the pandemic of 2009, a wealth of data from hospitalized cases of influenza from many different countries accumulated and are now starting to emerge. Observational clinical data provide information about the efficacy of existing antiviral drugs in severely ill patients. The development pipeline for new therapies contains several promising agents which are focussed on a range of viral targets, and opens the possibility of combination antiviral therapy for the first time, which may be especially useful in clinically challenging cases. Advances in immunological methods and recombinant protein engineering support the potential for use of immunomodulating therapies as adjuncts in treatment of severe influenza. RECENT FINDINGS The main themes are the importance of treating severe influenza early, considering multiple therapy options and the relevance of observational clinical data to treatment of severely ill and risk groups. SUMMARY Clinicians, who may have only seen the media headlines following discussion of reviews which deal with randomized controlled trials of neuraminidase inhibitor drug use in mild uncomplicated influenza in the community, may be hesitant to prescribe these drugs. Observational data arising from treatment of severely ill individuals support use of these drugs early in illness and show improvement in outcomes associated with drug use.","Zambon, Maria",Current opinion in infectious diseases,293,1

We analyzed the features and the incidence of dermatological issues emerged during the hospitalization due to COVID-19 and absent before. METHODS All the SARS-CoV-2 positive patients hospitalized in Celio Military Hospital - COVID hub no-intensive care wards from March 16, 2020 until May 4, 2020 were evaluated by dermatologists several times during the hospital stay. RESULTS Ninety-six patients (15 civilians and 81 Italian servicepeople) were enrolled: 34 (35.4%) patients developed cutaneous manifestations; 15 (16.0%) suffered from skin dryness; 5 (5.2%) irritant contact dermatitis; 4 (4.2%) seborrheic dermatitis; 4 (4.2%) morbilliform rashes; 3 (3.1%) petechial rashes and 3 (3.1%) widespread hives.

METHODS This study involved 75 patients with solitary HCC who underwent RFA. The AM was evaluated using 3D-CT image fusion. All cases were categorized into two groups based on the extent of the AM: in Group A, sufficient AM was obtained, which was greater than or equal to 5 mm; in Group B, the lesion was also ablated successfully, but a 5 mm AM was not obtained. RESULTS 3D-CT Image Fusion was performed on 36 and 39 patients in Group A and Group B, respectively. The 1, 3, 5 year RFS was 87.6%, 63.2%, 50.6% for Group A, and 77.2%, 51.5%, 35.6% for Group B, respectively (P = 0.042); the corresponding OS was 94.3%, 73.8%, 64.6%, and 86.2%, 60.5%, 47.6%, respectively (P = 0.046). Multivariate analysis showed that the AM (P = 0.048, HR = 2.15, 95% CI 1.01-4.60) and Pre-NLR were independent prognostic factors for PFS.

In this study, the SARS coronavirus small envelope protein (SCVE) was expressed in E. coli cells previously engineered for periplasmic expression of carbonic anhydrase (CA) activity. This maneuver increased small molecule uptake by the cells, resulting in increased apparent CA activity of the biocatalysts. The enhancements in activity were quantified using methods developed for traditional heterogeneous catalysis. The expression of the SCVE protein was found to significantly reduce the Thiele moduli (ϕ), as well as increase the effectiveness factors (η), effective diffusivities (De), and permeabilities (P) of the biocatalysts. These catalytic improvements translated into superior performance of the biocatalysts for the precipitation of calcium carbonate from solution which is an attractive strategy for long-term sequestration of captured carbon dioxide. Overall, these results demonstrate that synthetic biology approaches can be used to enhance heterogeneous catalysts incorporated into microbial whole-cell scaffolds.","Patel, Tushar N; Park, Ah-Hyung Alissa; Banta, Scott",ACS synthetic biology,293,8

Methods: Data for everyone who had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in Norway by end of June 2020 (N = 8569) were linked at the individual level to hospitalization, receipt of invasive mechanical ventilation treatment and death measured to end of July 2020. Underlying comorbidity was proxied by hospital-based in- or outpatient treatment during the two months before the SARS-CoV-2 test. Multivariable generalized linear models were used to assess risk ratios (RRs). Results: Risk of hospitalization was particularly high for elderly (for those aged 90 and above: RR 9.5; 95% confidence interval (CI) 7.1-12.7; comparison group aged below 50), Norwegian residents born in Asia, Africa or Latin-America (RR 2.1; 95% CI 1.9-2.4; comparison group born in Norway), patients with underlying comorbidity (RR 1.6; 95% CI 1.4-1.8) and men (RR 1.3; 95% CI 1.2-1.5). Men and residents born in Africa, Asia and Latin-America were also at higher risk of receiving ventilation treatment and dying, but the mortality risk was especially high for the elderly (for those aged 90 and above: RR 607.9; 95% CI 145.5-2540.1; comparison group aged below 50) and residents in nursing homes (RR 4.2; 95% CI 3.1-5.7).

This study examines the relationships between cannabis, and depression and anxiety symptoms at 13, 15, and 17 years using cross-lagged models in a predominantly White (n = 1,430; 92%) subsample of 1,548 participants from the Quebec Longitudinal study of Child Development. Multigroup analyses were conducted to examine the models according to sexual orientation. Demographic covariates were included as control variables, as well as alcohol, cigarette, and other drug use to examine cannabis specificity. The full sample revealed small bidirectional associations, which remained significant once control variables were included in the model: cannabis at 13 and 15 years predicted anxiety symptoms at 15 and 17 years respectively, and depression symptoms at 15 years predicted cannabis at 17 years. The initial association between cannabis at 13 years and depression symptoms at 15 years was accounted for by other drug use at 13 years. Substantial differences were found between heterosexual participants and sexual minorities: LGB participants presented a substantially larger positive association between depression symptoms at 15 years and cannabis at 17 years, as well as a negative association between anxiety symptoms at 15 years and cannabis at 17 years. Both of these relationships remained significant when accounting for control variables. These results suggest that the relationships between cannabis, and depression and anxiety symptoms are bidirectional across adolescence, albeit small. Sexual minorities present particularly large associations that may represent self-medication efforts for depressive symptoms between 15 and 17 years.

A team of clinicians, academics, and researchers came together to develop an observational metric using an iterative six-stage process, culminating in a Delphi panel meeting. A scoping review of the literature provided a background empirical perspective relating to wound-dressing procedure performance. Video recordings of acute surgical wound-dressing procedures performed by nurses in clinical (n = 11) and simulated (n = 3) settings were viewed repeatedly and were iteratively deconstructed by the metric development group. This facilitated the identification of the discrete component steps, potential errors, and sentinel (serious) errors, which characterise a wound dressing procedure and formed part of the observational metric. The ANTT wound-dressing observational metric was stress tested for clarity, the ability to be scored, and interrater reliability, calculated during a further phase of video analysis. The metric was then subjected to a process of cyclical evaluation by a Delphi panel (n = 21) to obtain face and content validity of the metric. The Delphi panel deliberation verified the face and content validity of the metric. The final metric has three phases, 31 individual steps, 18 errors, and 27 sentinel errors. The metric is a tool that identifies the standard to be attained in the performance of acute surgical wound dressings. It can be used as both an adjunct to an educational programme and as a tool to assess a practitioner's performance of a wound-dressing procedure in both simulated and clinical practice contexts.","Hegarty, Josephine; Howson, Victoria; Wills, Teresa; Creedon, Sile A; Mc Cluskey, Pat; Lane, Aoife; Connolly, Aine; Walshe, Nuala; Noonan, Brendan; Guidera, Fiona; Gallagher, Anthony G; Murphy, Siobhan",International wound journal,293,17

The primary outcome was age-adjusted annual incidence of PAC. Descriptive statistics, hazard ratios, and survival rates were compared. RESULTS Cohort A and cohort B included 617,042 and 29,472 SOT recipients, respectively.

The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy of aspirin (ASA) to warfarin in patients with higher risk of VTE. METHODS This retrospective study examined 30,270 patients who received ASA or warfarin for VTE prophylaxis after TJA. Using a previously developed risk stratification model, patients were classified into low or high VTE risk categories. Postoperative 90-day VTE, periprosthetic joint infection (PJI), gastrointestinal complications, and mortality were recorded. RESULTS The incidences of VTE, PJI, and mortality were higher in patients receiving warfarin compared to ASA. In multivariate analysis, warfarin was an independent risk factor for VTE, PJI, and mortality in the higher risk VTE patients (P < .001). There was no significant difference in gastrointestinal complications between groups.

SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has caused surgeons the world over to re-evaluate their approach to surgical procedures given concerns over the risk of aerosolization of viral particles and exposure of operating room staff to infection. International society guidelines advise against the use of laparoscopy; however, the evidence on this topic is scant and recommendations are based on the perceived most cautious course of action. METHODS We conducted a narrative review of the existing literature surrounding the risks of viral transmission during laparoscopic surgery and balance these risks against the benefits of minimally invasive approaches. We also propose mitigation measures to address these risks that we have adopted in our institution. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION While it is currently assumed that open surgery minimizes operating room staff exposure to the virus, our findings reveal that this may not be the case. A well-informed, evidence-based opinion is critical when making decisions regarding which operative approach to pursue, for the safety and well-being of the patient, the operating room staff, and the healthcare system at large. Minimally invasive surgical approaches offer significant advantages with respect to both patient care, and the mitigation of the risk of viral transmission during surgery, provided the appropriate equipment and expertise are present.","Chadi, Sami A; Guidolin, Keegan; Caycedo-Marulanda, Antonio; Sharkawy, Abdu; Spinelli, Antonino; Quereshy, Fayez A; Okrainec, Allan",Annals of surgery,293,25

This systematic review examines the evidence for interventions in acute hospitals including (i) hospital-patient discharge to home, community services or other settings, (ii) hospital discharge to another care setting, and (iii) reduction or prevention of inappropriate hospital (re)admissions. Academic electronic databases were searched from 2005 to 2018. In total, ninety-four eligible papers were included. Interventions were categorized into: (1) pre-discharge exclusively delivered in the acute care hospital, (2) pre- and post-discharge delivered by acute care hospital, (3) post-discharge delivered at home and (4) delivered only in a post-acute facility. Mixed results were found regarding the effectiveness of many types of interventions. Interventions exclusively delivered in the acute hospital pre-discharge and those involving education were most common but their effectiveness was limited in avoiding (re)admission. Successful pre- and post-discharge interventions focused on multidisciplinary approaches. Post-discharge interventions exclusively delivered at home reduced hospital stay and contributed to patient satisfaction. Existing systematic reviews on tele-health and long-term care interventions suggest insufficient evidence for admission avoidance. The most effective interventions to avoid inappropriate re-admission to hospital and promote early discharge included integrated systems between hospital and the community care, multidisciplinary service provision, individualization of services, discharge planning initiated in hospital and specialist follow-up.","Coffey, Alice; Leahy-Warren, Patricia; Savage, Eileen; Hegarty, Josephine; Cornally, Nicola; Day, Mary Rose; Sahm, Laura; O'Connor, Kieran; O'Doherty, Jane; Liew, Aaron; Sezgin, Duygu; O'Caoimh, Rónán",International journal of environmental research and public health,293,22

Short Tandem Repeat (STR) analysis is utilised to perform paternity and kinship analysis, due to the polymorphic nature of STR loci. The cost associated with paternity testing is high, and there is a demand for motherless testing. Objectives This study aims to determine what the impact of motherless testing would have been by evaluating 6182 paternity trio cases. Methods The AmpFLSTR™ Identifiler™ PCR Amplification kit was used to profile each of the trio cases. A scenario was created where the mother was eliminated from the test results to determine if the paternity outcome would change. Results Putative fathers were excluded in 27% of all cases, and in 2.5% of those cases, putative fathers would have been falsely included, had the mother not been tested. These false inclusions are attributed to coincidental STR loci that are shared between the mother and the putative father. The addition of loci to the STR profiling kit may resolve the issue; however, comparable STR data with more loci will have to be evaluated to ensure it overcomes the issue of coincidentally shared loci between unrelated individuals.

False inclusion of putative fathers could have serious legal implications for testing laboratories.","De Kock, André A; Kloppers, Jean Jf",African health sciences,293,19

In March 2020, institutions in the United States began to implement a range of policies to discourage direct contact and encourage social distancing. These measures have placed us in an unprecedented position where education can no longer occur at close quarters - most notably, around a multi-headed microscope - but must instead continue at a distance. This guide is intended to be a resource for pathologists and pathologists-in-training who wish to leverage technology to continue collaboration, teaching, and education in this era. The manuscript is focused mainly on anatomic pathology; however, the technologies easily lend themselves to clinical pathology education as well. Our aim is to provide curated lists of various online resources that can be used for virtual learning in pathology, provide tips and tricks, and share our personal experience with these technologies. The lists include video conferencing platforms, pathology websites, free online educational resources, including social media, and whole-slide imaging collections. We are currently living through a unique situation without a precedent or guidebook, and we hope that this guide will enable the community of pathology educators worldwide to embrace the opportunities that 21st century technology provides.","Mukhopadhyay, Sanjay; Booth, Adam L; Calkins, Sarah M; Doxtader, Erika E; Fine, Samson W; Gardner, Jerad M; Gonzalez, Raul S; Mirza, Kamran M; Jiang, Xiaoyin Sara",Archives of pathology & laboratory medicine,293,1

Here, we used experimental sleep disruption to examine the relationship between sleep disruption-induced pain sensitivity and functional connectivity (FC) of cognitive networks contributing to pain modulation. Nineteen healthy individuals underwent two counterbalanced experimental sleep conditions for one night each: uninterrupted sleep versus sleep disruption. Following each condition, participants completed functional MRI including a simple motor task and a noxious thermal stimulation task. Pain ratings and stimulus temperatures from the latter task were combined to calculate a pain sensitivity change score following sleep disruption. This change score was used as a predictor of simple motor task FC changes using bilateral executive control networks (RECN, LECN) and the default mode network (DMN) masks as seed regions of interest (ROIs). Increased pain sensitivity after sleep disruption was positively associated with increased RECN FC to ROIs within the DMN and LECN (F(4,14) = 25.28, pFDR = 0.05). However, this pain sensitivity change score did not predict FC changes using LECN and DMN masks as seeds (pFDR > 0.05). Given that only RECN FC was associated with sleep loss-induced hyperalgesia, findings suggest that cognitive networks only partially contribute to the sleep-pain dyad.","Letzen, Janelle E; Remeniuk, Bethany; Smith, Michael T; Irwin, Michael R; Finan, Patrick H; Seminowicz, David A",Human brain mapping,293,20

We reported on a subxiphoid single-port thymectomy using CO2 insufflation, which has the following advantages: (I) the field of view offered by the camera scope inserted from the midline of the body helps confirm the location of the superior pole of the thymus and bilateral phrenic nerves; (II) there is minimal pain and no intercostal neuropathy occurs as intercostal spaces are not traversed; and (III) cosmetic outcomes are excellent. However, a drawback of this approach is that it requires familiarity with the single-port surgical procedure. Various surgical modifications have been suggested for the subxiphoid approach, which we currently use for thymectomy. These include subxiphoid single-port thymectomy; subxiphoid dual-port thymectomy (DPT) wherein an additional lateral thoracic intercostal port is added, which is used for more complicated surgeries; and subxiphoid robotic thymectomy using the da Vinci Surgical System. Here we report on these techniques. A subxiphoid approach in thymectomy is advantageous to patients as it minimizes or avoids the occurrence of intercostal neuropathy. Moreover, a subxiphoid approach provides the surgeon with a good field of view of the cervical region and helps confirm the location of the bilateral phrenic nerves. Therefore, thymectomy using a subxiphoid approach should be considered an option for a minimally invasive surgery.","Suda, Takashi",Journal of visualized surgery,293,1

Although such steps are taken to control the spread of the pandemic, they may also cause various psychological problems. This study attempts to identify individual perceptions of staying home due to the COVID-19 pandemic through metaphors, and examines the relationship between these perceptions and stress, depression, and anxiety. This research utilizes a mixed method design called the embedded design. The analyses were performed on data collected from 96 women and 80 men aged 18-57. Qualitative data were analyzed using a content analysis technique, while quantitative data were analyzed through the Kruskal-Wallis test. The findings showed that most of the participants viewed staying home as confinement, experienced boredom/depression because of staying home, and felt helpless. On the other hand, some participants concentrated on the positive sides of staying home and considered it a responsible behavior, an opportunity, and a requirement for feeling safe. The individuals who viewed staying home as confinement and a cause for boredom/depression experienced more psychological problems, whereas those who perceived it as a responsibility or opportunity experienced fewer psychological problems. Considering the literature on the contribution of positive thinking to the well-being of individuals, as well as the lower levels of psychological problems in individuals who maintain their positive perspectives despite the negativities of staying home due to the pandemic, we recommend that mental health professionals focus on the development of positive feelings and thoughts in their interventions.","Bozdağ, Faruk",The Journal of general psychology,293,8

Whereas most of the research efforts have focused on large mygalomorph spiders, araneomorph spiders are equally promising but require more sensitive and sophisticated approaches given their limited size and reduced venom yield. Belonging to the latter group, the genus Lycosa (""wolf spiders"") contains many species widely distributed throughout the world. These spiders are ambush predators that do not build webs but instead rely strongly on their venom for prey capture. Lycosa tarantula is one of the largest species of wolf spider, but its venom composition is unknown. Using a combination of RNA sequencing of the venom glands and venom proteomics, we provide the first overview of the peptides and proteins produced by this iconic Mediterranean spider. Beside the typical small disulfide rich neurotoxins, several families of proteins were also identified, including cysteine-rich secretory proteins (CRISP) and Hyaluronidases. Proteomic analysis of the electrically stimulated venom validated 30 of these transcriptomic sequences, including nine putative neurotoxins and eight venom proteins. Interestingly, LC-MS venom profiles of manual versus electric stimulation, as well as female versus male, showed some marked differences in mass distribution. Finally, we also present some preliminary data on the biological activity of L. tarantula crude venom.","Koua, Dominique; Mary, Rosanna; Ebou, Anicet; Barrachina, Celia; El Koulali, Khadija; Cazals, Guillaume; Charnet, Pierre; Dutertre, Sebastien",Toxins,293,19

Within HCWs, personnel of intensive care units (ICUs) are at the forefront of treating patients with a severe course of COVID-19 infection and therefore represent an extremely vulnerable group. Thus, our objective is to contribute to establish means of infection control protecting HCWs in the frontline of the current pandemic. DESIGN An outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 was detected and contained in a pediatric ICU (PICU). The first positive case was identified with a point-of-care diagnostic system on site. Real-time PCR-based testing systems from self-collected nasopharyngeal samples swabs were used to test for viral RNA of SARS-CoV-2 in the follow-up. SETTING PICU within a tertiary university hospital in Germany. PARTICIPANTS Healthcare workers of the PICU. INTERVENTIONS Positive HCWs were sent into quarantine. Containment measures were implemented including wearing of surgical-masks, physical distancing and systematic testing. RESULTS Among 432 HCWs, 91 (25%) were tested. Forty-five percent reported symptoms corresponding to characteristics of COVID-19. Of those, only 19,5% (8 HCWs) were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. No infection occurred outside the PICU. After the implementation of containment measures, viral transmission was stopped.

MATERIALS AND METHODS We collected medical records of the intensive care unit patients submitted by the local COVID-19 hospitals across Russia to the Federal Center for the Critical Care at the Sechenov First Moscow State Medical University (Sechenov University). Septic shock in crticially ill patients requiring mechanical ventilation was defined as a need in vasopressors to maintain blood pressure. RESULTS We studied 1078 patients with severe COVID-19 who were admitted to the intensive care units for respiratory support. There were 611 males and 467 females. The mean age was 61.013.7 years. Five hundred twenty five medical records (48.7%) were received from the Moscow hospitals, 159 (14.7%) from the Moscow region, and 394 (36.5%) from the hospitals located in 58 regions of the Russian Federation. In 613 (56.9%) patients, diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed by PCR, and in the other cases it was established on the basis of the clinical picture and the results of the chest CT scan. Septic shock developed in 214 (19.9%) of 1078 patients. In the logistic regression model, the risk of septic shock in patients older than 50 years was higher than in patients of a younger age (OR 2.34; 95% CI 1.533.67; p0.0001). In patients with more severe SARS-CoV-2 infection, there was an increase in the prevalence of cardiovascular diseases, including coronary heart disease and atrial fibrillation, type 2 diabetes and malignant tumors. The risk of septic shock in patients with three or more concomitant diseases was higher than in patients without any concomitant chronic diseases (OR 1.76; 95% CI 1.762.70). CONCLUSION The risk of septic shock in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome induced by SARS-CoV-2 is higher in patients older than 50 years with concomitant diseases, although a severe course of the disease is also possible in younger patients without any concomitant disorders.","Glybochko, P V; Fomin, V V; Moiseev, S V; Avdeev, S N; Yavorovskiy, A G; Brovko, M Y; Umbetova, K T; Aliev, V A; Bulanova, E L; Bondarenko, I B; Volkova, O S; Gaynitdinova, V V; Gneusheva, T Y; Dubrovin, K V; Kapustina, V A; Kraeva, V V; Merzhoeva, Z M; Nuralieva, G S; Nogtev, P V; Panasyuk, V V; Politov, M E; Popov, A M; Popova, E N; Raspopina, N A; Royuk, V V; Sorokin, Y D; Trushenko, N V; Khalikova, E Y; Tsareva, N A; Chikina, S Y; Chichkova, N V; Akulkina, L A; Bulanov, N M; Ermolova, L A; Zykova, A S; Kitbalyan, A A; Moiseev, A S; Potapov, P P; Tao, E A; Sholomova, V I; Shchepalina, A A; Yakovleva, A A",Terapevticheskii arkhiv,293,16

We examined the significance of the COX-prostaglandin pathway in human DC infected by DV. We show that DV infection induced the expression of COX-2 and the production of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in DC, and stimulated the DNA binding of NF-kappaB and the kinase activity of both IkappaBalpha kinase (IKK) alpha and beta. DV infection also activated MAPK and AP-1 signaling. Both IkappaBalpha kinase-NF-kappaB and MAPK-AP-1 were upstream of COX-2 activation. Our investigation into the significance of COX-2-PGE2 pathway also revealed that DV infection enhances DC migration by inducing CC chemokine receptor 7 (CCR7) expression, and that blocking COX-2 or MAPK activity suppresses DV-induced DC migration. Our data also suggest that PGE2 can induce CCR7 expression on DC and that antagonists of the PGE2 receptors EP2 and EP4 suppress DV-induced DC migration. We further show that the increased CCR7 expression was observed in both DV-infected and bystander DC, suggesting the presence of secondary effects in inducing CCR7 expression. Collectively, this study reveals not only the pathways involved in COX-2 synthesis in DV-infected DC but also the autocrine action of PGE2 on the migration of DV-infected DC.","Wu, Wan-Lin; Ho, Ling-Jun; Chang, Deh-Ming; Chen, Chen-Hung; Lai, Jenn-Haung",European journal of immunology,293,16

Despite the importance of hydrogels for therapeutic applications, a contradiction between the size of a hydrogel and the amount of loaded drug has been encountered when using conventional fabrication methods. In this study, biocompatible reservoir microcapsules (diameter ∼100 μm) with a large liquid core and polymeric shell were fabricated via a one-step phase separation of poly(ethylene glycol)diacrylate (PEGDA) and dextran within pre-gel droplets through microfluidics. By controlling the process of phase separation, high drug-loading efficiency (∼80%) for long-term release (30 days) of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) was achieved. Drug molecules were dispersed within the liquid core at a concentration above saturation solubility for sustained delivery via regulation of the shells. Effective therapeutic enhancement of human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) and umbilical artery smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation and tube formation in vitro promoted rapid cell proliferation and increased the number of migrated cells by ∼1.7 times. Moreover, in vivo blood vessel regeneration for cardiovascular control induced by sustained dual-drug (VEGF and PDGF) delivery to the rat heart was achieved, showing the effectiveness of long-term protein delivery in improving cardiac function and significantly reducing ventricular wall thickness and fibrosis of the infarct region. The ratio of heart tissue scarring was reduced to 11.2% after microcapsule treatment compared with 21.4% after saline treatment in the rat model.

In the SEA group we encountered shoulder pain in 6 (24%) patients, abdominal discomfort/pain in 4 (16%) patients, anxiety in 4 (16%) patients, and hypotension in 2 (8%) patients intraoperatively. Also, post-spinal headache was observed in 5 (20%) patients in the SEA group. Postoperative right shoulder pain was significantly higher in the GA group compared to the SEA group (32% vs. 8%; p = 0.037). In the SEA group the incidence of urinary retention and in the GA group the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) were higher, but these differences were not statistically significant. The postoperative surgical pain level was significantly lower in the SEA group (p < 0.001). Conclusions Spinal/epidural anesthesia is effective and safe in ASA I healthy patients undergoing LA. Less postoperative pain, PONV and shoulder pain are the advantages of SEA compared to GA.","Erdem, Vuslat Muslu; Donmez, Turgut; Uzman, Sinan; Ferahman, Sina; Hatipoglu, Engin; Sunamak, Oguzhan",Wideochirurgia i inne techniki maloinwazyjne = Videosurgery and other miniinvasive techniques,293,19

The use of surrogate viruses has the potential to overcome the challenges of working with SARS-CoV and to increase the available data on coronavirus survival on surfaces. Two potential surrogates were evaluated in this study; transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) were used to determine effects of AT and RH on the survival of coronaviruses on stainless steel. At 4 degrees C, infectious virus persisted for as long as 28 days, and the lowest level of inactivation occurred at 20% RH. Inactivation was more rapid at 20 degrees C than at 4 degrees C at all humidity levels; the viruses persisted for 5 to 28 days, and the slowest inactivation occurred at low RH. Both viruses were inactivated more rapidly at 40 degrees C than at 20 degrees C. The relationship between inactivation and RH was not monotonic, and there was greater survival or a greater protective effect at low RH (20%) and high RH (80%) than at moderate RH (50%). There was also evidence of an interaction between AT and RH. The results show that when high numbers of viruses are deposited, TGEV and MHV may survive for days on surfaces at ATs and RHs typical of indoor environments. TGEV and MHV could serve as conservative surrogates for modeling exposure, the risk of transmission, and control measures for pathogenic enveloped viruses, such as SARS-CoV and influenza virus, on health care surfaces.","Casanova, Lisa M; Jeon, Soyoung; Rutala, William A; Weber, David J; Sobsey, Mark D",Applied and environmental microbiology,293,8

Beak and feather disease virus (BFDV) can affect most if not all members of one of the largest and most threatened bird orders world-wide, the Psittaciformes. Signs of disease can be severe and mortality rates high. Its broad host range makes it a risk to threatened species in particular, because infection can occur via spill-over from abundant hosts. Despite these risks, surveillance of BFDV in locally abundant wild host species has been lacking. We used qPCR and haemagglutination assays to investigate BFDV prevalence, load and shedding in seven abundant host species in the wild in south-east Australia: Crimson Rosellas (Platycercus elegans), Eastern Rosellas (Platycercus eximius), Galahs (Eolophus roseicapillus), Sulphur-crested Cockatoos (Cacatua galerita), Blue-winged Parrots (Neophema chrysostoma), Rainbow Lorikeets (Trichoglossus moluccanus) and Red-rumped Parrots (Psephotus haematonotus). We found BFDV infection in clinically normal birds in six of the seven species sampled. We focused our analysis on the four most commonly caught species, namely Crimson Rosellas (BFDV prevalence in blood samples: 41.8%), Sulphur-crested Cockatoos (20.0%), Blue-winged Parrots (11.8%) and Galahs (8.8%). Species, but not sex, was a significant predictor for BFDV prevalence and load. 56.1% of BFDV positive individuals were excreting BFDV antigen into their feathers, indicative of active viral replication with shedding. Being BFDV positive in blood samples predicted shedding in Crimson Rosellas. Our study confirms that BFDV is endemic in our study region, and can inform targeted disease management by providing comparative data on interspecies variation in virus prevalence, load and shedding.","Martens, Johanne M; Stokes, Helena S; Berg, Mathew L; Walder, Ken; Raidal, Shane R; Magrath, Michael J L; Bennett, Andy T D",PloS one,293,1

We investigated whether cadavers embalmed with the novel Fix for Life (F4L) embalmment method are a suitable and realistic model for teaching 3 basic airway skills: facemask ventilation, tracheal intubation, and laryngeal mask insertion compared to a manikin (SimMan 3G) and formalin-fixed cadavers. METHODS Thirty anesthesiologists and experienced residents (""operators"") were instructed to perform the 3 airway techniques in 10 F4L, 10 formalin-fixed cadavers, and 1 manikin. The order of the model type was randomized per operator. Primary outcomes were the operators' ranking of each model type as a teaching model (total rank), ranking of the model types per technique, and an operator's average verbal rating score for suitability and realism of learning the technique on the model. Secondary outcomes were the percentages of successfully performed procedures per technique and per model (success rates in completing the respective airway maneuvers). For each of the airway techniques, the Friedman analysis of variance was used to compare the 3 models on mean operator ranking and mean verbal rating scores. RESULTS Twenty-seven of 30 operators (90%) performed all airway techniques on all of the available models, whereas 3 operators performed the majority but not all of the airway maneuvers on all models for logistical reasons. The total number of attempts for each technique was 30 on the manikin, 292 in the F4L, and 282 on the formalin-fixed cadavers. The operators' median total ranking of each model type as a teaching model was 1 for F4L, 2 for the manikin and, 3 for the formalin-fixed cadavers (P < .001). F4L was considered the best model for mask ventilation (P = .029) and had a higher mean verbal rating score for realism in laryngeal mask airway insertion (P = .043). The F4L and manikin did not differ significantly in other scores for suitability and realism. The formalin-fixed cadaver was ranked last and received lowest scores in all procedures (all P < .001). Success rates of the procedures were highest in the manikin. CONCLUSIONS F4L cadavers were ranked highest for mask ventilation and were considered the most realistic model for training laryngeal mask insertion. Formalin-fixed cadavers are inappropriate for airway management training.","van Emden, Michael W; Geurts, Jeroen J; Schober, Patrick; Schwarte, Lothar A",Anesthesia and analgesia,293,1

This study aimed to identify factors that influence faculty's rating choicesimmediately following assessment and explore their experiences using WBAs with entrustment anchors, specifically the Ottawa Surgical Competency Operating Room Evaluation scale. METHOD A convenience sample of 50 semi-structured interviews with Emergency Medicine (EM) physicians from a single Canadian hospital were conducted between July and August, 2019. All interviews occurred within two hours of faculty completing a WBA of a trainee. Faculty were asked what they considered when rating the trainee's performance and whether they considered an alternate rating. Two team members independently analyzed interview transcripts using conventional content analysis with line-by-line coding to identify themes. RESULTS Interviews captured interactions between 70% (26/37) of full-time EM faculty and 86% (19/22) of EM trainees. Faculty most commonly identified the amount of guidance the trainee required as influencing their rating. Other variables such as clinical context, trainee experience, past experiences with the trainee, perceived competence and confidence were also identified. While most faculty did not struggle to assign ratings, some had difficulty interpreting the language of entrustment anchors, being unsure if their assessment should be retrospective or prospective in nature, and if/how the assessment should change whether they were ""in the room"" or not. CONCLUSIONS By going to the frontline during WBA encounters, this study captured authentic and honest reflections from physicians immediately engaged in assessment using entrustment anchors. While many of the factors identified are consistent with previous retrospective work, we highlight how some faculty consider factors outside the prescribed approach and struggle with the language of entrustment anchors. These results further our understanding of ""in the moment"" assessments using entrustment anchors and may facilitate effective faculty development regarding WBA in CBME.","Robinson, Trevor J G; Wagner, Natalie; Szulewski, Adam; Dudek, Nancy; Cheung, Warren J; Hall, Andrew K",Medical education,293,27

Differentiation protocols of islet-like clusters lead to the generation of minor fractions of nonendocrine cells, which are mainly from endodermal and mesodermal lineages, and the risk of implanting these is unclear. In the present study, the histogenesis and the tumorigenicity of nonendocrine cells were investigated in vivo. Immunodeficient mice were implanted under the kidney capsule with islet-like clusters which were derived from differentiation of cells batches with either an intermediate or poor cell purity and followed for 8 or 26 weeks. Using immunohistochemistry and other techniques, it was found that the intermediate differentiated cell implants had limited numbers of small duct-like cysts and nonpancreatic tissue resembling gastrointestinal and retinal pigmented epithelium. In contrast, highly proliferative cystic teratomas were found at a high incidence at the implant site after 8 weeks, only in the animals implanted with the poorly differentiated cells. These findings indicate that the risk for teratoma formation and the amount of nonpancreatic tissue can be minimized by careful in-process characterization of the cells and thus highlights the importance of high purity at transplantation and a thorough ex-vivo characterization during cell product development.","Jensen, Nikolai K; Ingvorsen, Camilla; Petersen, Dorthe R; Pereira, Maria J; Lu, Tess T H; Alsted, Thomas J; Kirkegaard, Jeannette S; Keane, Kevin A",Toxicologic pathology,293,31

However, some patients fail to normalize, and their condition is often referred to as tertiary hyperparathyroidism (THPT). Surgical consensus on the timing of post-transplant parathyroidectomy (PTX) for THPT has not been reached. Herein, we report a case of a 58-year-old post-transplant woman, considering the concrete timing of PTX for both SHPT and THPT. She initiated hemodialysis with end-stage renal disease at the age of 24, and underwent first kidney transplantation at the age of 28. When peritoneal dialysis (PD) was induced due to the worsening kidney function at the age of 50, the serum intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) level remarkably increased (2332 pg/mL). Although cinacalcet was administered, the patient's iPTH levels were not sufficiently suppressed for seven years. Diagnostic images including ultrasound, computed tomography, and 99mTc-methoxyisobutylisonitrile scintigraphy indicated THPT as the reason for prolonged post-transplant hypercalcemia. Therefore, PTX was performed 14 months after the second transplantation. Histology showed nodular hyperplasia of all parathyroid glands, indicating autonomous secretion of parathyroid hormone. In general, patients with more severe THPT are recognized with more severe SHPT prior to transplantation during the dialysis period. We should consider a referral for surgery based on the individual risk factors. We recommend to perform parathyroidectomy earlier, before the kidney transplantation in the clinical suspicion of severe SHPT.","Masaki, Chiaki; Ogawa, Shoto; Shima, Hisato; Banno, Taro; Tsuyuguchi, Masaru; Nagasaka, Naoki; Tashiro, Manabu; Inoue, Tomoko; Tada, Hiroaki; Wariishi, Seiichiro; Miya, Keiko; Kawahara, Kazuhiko; Takamatsu, Norimichi; Okada, Kazuyoshi; Minakuchi, Jun",CEN case reports,293,1

Although BRCA1 mutations have been shown to be associated with an increased risk of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), its role in disease progression is yet to be determined. We hypothesized that BRCA1 expression pattern could be used as a prognostic biomarker. METHODS Sixty-seven patients who underwent resections for PDAC were included. A tissue microarray was constructed, stained with antibodies to BRCA1, and scored for intensity and subcellular location. Univariate and multivariate statistical analyses were performed. RESULTS An increase in cytosolic BRCA1 distribution was associated with higher pathologic stage (P = 0.006). Nuclear-cytosolic BRCA1 distribution was associated with a decrease in recurrence-free survival with a hazards ratio of 1.4 (P = 0.059). Decreased BRCA1 intensity was associated with higher pathologic stage (P = 0.027), but BRCA1 intensity was not associated with overall survival or recurrence-free survival.

The importance of IOM has been broadly acknowledged, and in 1989, the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) released a statement that the use of SSEPs should be standard-of-care during spine surgery. In 2012, both the AAN and the American Clinical Neurophysiology Society (ACNS) recommended that: ""Intraoperative monitoring (IOM) using SSEPs and transcranial MEPs be established as an effective means of predicting an increased risk of adverse outcomes, such as paraparesis, paraplegia, and quadriplegia, in spinal surgery.""

METHODS Five databases (PubMed, PsycINFO, Embase, Web of Science, and Scopus) were systematically searched. Studies were included if they provided findings on the association between acceptance and QOL, mental health outcomes, or both in an SCI population aged 16 years or older. Only peer-reviewed original quantitative and qualitative studies were included. Screening, quality assessment, and data extraction were conducted independently by two researchers. Findings were tabulated and synthesized by outcome. RESULTS Forty-one studies were included. Greater acceptance was consistently associated with greater global and psychological QOL, life satisfaction, sense of well-being, mental health, and with lower levels of depression and anxiety. Inconsistent evidence was found with regards to social QOL and post-traumatic stress disorder. Acceptance was generally not associated with adjustment outcomes further than 2 years into the future.

However, the effect of an acute change in central blood volume (CBV) on CBF regulation remains unclear. To address our question, we sought to examine the CBF and systemic hemodynamic responses to microgravity during parabolic flight. Twelve healthy subjects were seated upright and exposed to microgravity during parabolic flight. During the brief periods of microgravity, mean arterial pressure was decreased (-26 ± 1%, P < 0.001), despite an increase in cardiac output (+21 ± 6%, P < 0.001). During microgravity, central arterial pulse pressure and estimated carotid sinus pressure increased rapidly. In addition, this increase in central arterial pulse pressure was associated with an arterial baroreflex-mediated decrease in heart rate (r = -0.888, P < 0.0001) and an increase in total vascular conductance (r = 0.711, P < 0.001). The middle cerebral artery mean blood velocity (MCA Vmean) remained unchanged throughout parabolic flight (P = 0.30). During microgravity the contribution of cardiac output to MCA Vmean was gradually reduced (P < 0.05), and its contribution was negatively correlated with an increase in total vascular conductance (r = -0.683, P < 0.0001). These findings suggest that the acute loading of the arterial and cardiopulmonary baroreceptors by increases in CBV during microgravity results in acute and marked systemic vasodilation. Furthermore, we conclude that this marked systemic vasodilation decreases the contribution of cardiac output to CBF. These findings suggest that the arterial and cardiopulmonary baroreflex-mediated peripheral vasodilation along with dynamic cerebral autoregulation counteracts a cerebral overperfusion, which otherwise would occur during acute increases in CBV.","Ogoh, Shigehiko; Hirasawa, Ai; Raven, Peter B; Rebuffat, Thomas; Denise, Pierre; Lericollais, Romain; Sugawara, Jun; Normand, Hervé","American journal of physiology.

Various options are available for the treatment of these leaks. A newer and less invasive option for the treatment of leaks is the use of endoluminal stents. The main drawback for this treatment is stent migration. The current study describes the outcome of a new, specifically designed stent for the treatment of anastomotic leaks after bariatric surgery. METHODS For this retrospective observational study, the medical charts of patients undergoing bariatric surgery between October 1, 2010 and July 1, 2013 were reviewed. All patients with anastomotic leakage, treated with the bariatric Hanarostent, were included. RESULTS Twelve patients were included out of a total of 1702 bariatric patients in the described period. Seven had a leakage after LSG, five after LGBP. An average of 2.4 endoscopic procedures and 1.25 stents were used per patient. Successful treatment was seen in nine out of 12 patients (75 %). Most common complication was dislocation or migration of the stent, occurring in eight patients (66.7 %). CONCLUSIONS The ECBB Hanarostent®, which was specifically designed for post bariatric leakages, shows equal but not favorable success rates in this small series compared to previous reports on other types of stenting techniques. Despite the stent design, the complication rate is not reduced and the main future goal should be to target the high stent migration rate.","van Wezenbeek, Martin R; de Milliano, Martine M; Nienhuijs, Simon W; Friederich, Pieter; Gilissen, Lennard P L",Obesity surgery,293,33

DESIGN A prospective single-center study (Canadian Task Force classification III). SETTING University hospital PATIENTS Fifteen patients with an extirpated uterine weight of more than 500 g were enrolled from May 2008 to September 2009. INTERVENTIONS SPA-LAVH. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS There were 11 cases with uterine myomas and 4 cases of adenomyosis. All patients had symptoms related to these diagnoses including menorrhagia, dysmenorrhea, and pelvic pressure symptoms such as urinary frequency. The median and range are used to describe data not distributed normally. The median operation time, weight of the uterus, and estimated blood loss were 125 minutes (80 to 236 minutes), 690 g (503 to 1260 g), and 500 mL (150 to 1000 mL), respectively. There was a significant linear correlation between the operation time and the extirpated uterine weight (p<.002). Thirteen procedures were successfully performed with SPA-LAVH. The SPA procedure failed in 2 cases: 1 (uterine weight, 732 g) required 1 ancillary 5-mm port to manipulate with a myoma screw, and in the other we inserted 1 additional 15-mm port to use for a laparoscopic morcellator. There were no umbilical complications, additional procedures, or surgical complications. CONCLUSION The SPA-LAVH procedure for a large uterus weighing in excess of 500 g was as safe and effective as the conventional LAVH. Additional experience and continued investigation are warranted.","Song, Taejong; Kim, Tae-Joong; Kim, Min-Kyu; Park, Hwangshin; Kim, Joo Sun; Lee, Yoo-Young; Kim, Chul Jung; Choi, Chel Hun; Lee, Jeong-Won; Kim, Byoung-Gie; Bae, Duk-Soo",Journal of minimally invasive gynecology,293,19

However, it has been suggested that during C. elegans female meiosis, anaphase is mediated by a kinetochore-independent pushing mechanism with microtubules only attached to the inner face of segregating chromosomes. We found that the kinetochore proteins KNL-1 and KNL-3 are required for preanaphase chromosome stretching, suggesting a role in pulling forces. In the absence of KNL-1,3, pairs of homologous chromosomes did not separate and did not move toward a spindle pole. Instead, each homolog pair moved together with the same spindle pole during anaphase B spindle elongation. Two masses of chromatin thus ended up at opposite spindle poles, giving the appearance of successful anaphase.","Danlasky, Brennan M; Panzica, Michelle T; McNally, Karen P; Vargas, Elizabeth; Bailey, Cynthia; Li, Wenzhe; Gong, Ting; Fishman, Elizabeth S; Jiang, Xueer; McNally, Francis J",The Journal of cell biology,293,1

This capacity has largely been ascribed to paracrine factors secreted by nerve-resident Schwann cells. Here, we used single cell transcriptional profiling to identify ligands made by different injured rodent nerve cell types and have combined this with cell surface mass spectrometry to computationally model potential paracrine interactions with peripheral neurons. These analyses show that peripheral nerves make many ligands predicted to act on peripheral and central nervous system neurons, including known and previously uncharacterized ligands. While Schwann cells are an important ligand source within injured nerves, more than half of the predicted ligands are made by nerve-resident mesenchymal cells, including the endoneurial cells most closely associated with peripheral axons. At least three of these mesenchymal ligands, ANGPT1, CCL11 and VEGFC, promote growth when locally applied on sympathetic axons. These data therefore identify an unexpected paracrine role for nerve mesenchymal cells and suggest that multiple cell types contribute to creating a highly pro-growth environment for peripheral axons.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT This work expands our understanding of the cellular sources of ligands in the injured peripheral nerve that are potentially important for promoting axon growth. Here, we used single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to reveal that Schwann cells and, surprisingly, nerve mesenchymal cells are primary sources of ligands in the injured nerve. We then combined injured nerve scRNA-seq data with proteomic and transcriptomic data from sensory and sympathetic neurons and used a systems-biology/modeling approach to predict novel mesenchymal cell-derived factors that may promote peripheral axon growth. We tested some of these predictions and found three factors, ANGPT1, CCL11 and VEGFC, that promoted outgrowth of cultured sympathetic axons, supporting a potential role for mesenchymal-derived factors in axon growth.","Toma, Jeremy S; Karamboulas, Konstantina; Carr, Matthew J; Kolaj, Adelaida; Yuzwa, Scott A; Mahmud, Neemat; Storer, Mekayla A; Kaplan, David R; Miller, Freda D",eNeuro,293,16

The overall variability in propofol target effect-site concentrations (CeT) necessary to maintain adequate anesthesia in real-world conditions is poorly characterized, as are the patient demographic factors that contribute to this variability. This study explored these issues, hypothesizing that the variability in covariate-adjusted propofol target concentrations during BIS-controlled anesthesia would be substantial and that most of the remaining interpatient variability in drug response would be due to random effects, thus suggesting that the opportunity to improve on the Schnider model with further demographic data is limited. METHODS With ethics committee approval and a waiver of informed consent, a deidentified, high-resolution, intraoperative database consisting of propofol target concentrations, BIS values, and vital signs from 13,239 patients was mined to identify patients who underwent general endotracheal anesthesia using propofol (titrated to BIS), fentanyl, remifentanil, and rocuronium that lasted at least 1 hour. The propofol target concentrations and BIS values 30 minutes after incision (CeT30 and BIS30) were considered representative of stable intraoperative conditions. The data were plotted and analyzed by descriptive statistics. Confidence intervals were computed using a bootstrap method. A linear model was fit to the data to test for correlation with factors of interest (eg, age and weight). RESULTS A total of 4584 patients met inclusion criteria and were entered into the analysis. Of the propofol target concentrations, 95% were between 1.5 and 3.5 µg·mL. Higher BIS30 values were correlated with higher propofol concentrations. Except for age, all the patient-related variables analyzed entered the regression model linearly. Only 10.2% of the variability in CeT30 was explained by the patient factors of age and weight combined. CONCLUSIONS Our hypothesis was confirmed. The variability in covariate-adjusted propofol CeT30 titrated to BIS in real-world conditions is considerable, and only a small portion of the remaining variability in drug response is explained by patient demographic factors. This finding may have important implications for the development of new pharmacokinetic (PK) models for propofol TCI.","Schnider, Thomas W; Minto, Charles F; Egan, Talmage D; Filipovic, Miodrag",Anesthesia and analgesia,293,2

In mammalian skin, elevated expression of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein has been reported in hair follicle (HF) bulge SCs (BSCs), but its impact on SC function is unknown. Here, we show that systemic exposure of mice to the Bcl-2 antagonist ABT-199/venetoclax leads to the selective loss of suprabasal BSCs (sbBSCs), thereby disrupting cyclic HF regeneration. RNAseq analysis shows that the pro-apoptotic BH3-only proteins BIM and Bmf are upregulated in sbBSCs, explaining their addiction to Bcl-2 and the marked susceptibility to Bcl-2 antagonism. In line with these observations, conditional knockout of Bcl-2 in mouse epidermis elevates apoptosis in BSCs. In contrast, ectopic Bcl-2 expression blocks apoptosis during HF regression, resulting in the accumulation of quiescent SCs and delaying HF growth in mice. Strikingly, Bcl-2-induced changes in size and composition of the HF bulge accelerate tumour formation. Our study identifies a niche-instructive mechanism of Bcl-2-regulated apoptosis response that is required for SC homeostasis and tissue regeneration, and may suppress carcinogenesis.","Geueke, Anna; Mantellato, Giada; Kuester, Florian; Schettina, Peter; Nelles, Melanie; Seeger, Jens Michael; Kashkar, Hamid; Niemann, Catherin",EMBO reports,293,1

However, in Spain, the circumstances suffered by the health professionals who have cared for pandemic patients from a clinical nutrition standpoint has remained unknown up to this moment. OBJECTIVES the management and care changes made in clinical nutrition units in Spain, and their impact on clinical practice are described. MATERIAL AND METHODS a cross-sectional study was carried out using a survey directed at SENPE members (June 2020). Responses sent by health professionals in the field of clinical nutrition who had treated patients with COVID-19 in Spanish hospitals were included in the study. Resultados: a total of 116 survey forms were analyzed, mostly filled out by doctors (57.8 %) working at hospitals with more than 500 beds (56 %); 46 % of survey respondents were on telework. There was a nutritional care plan in 68 % of cases, such plan being present mainly in hospitals with more than 500 beds (p < 0.001). In these hospitals more specific diets for COVID-19 were implemented than in those under 500 beds: 18 (35.3 %) vs 44 (67.7 %), (p < 0.001). The use of recommendations issued by scientific societies was reported in 86 % of cases. Never or almost never could a satisfactory nutritional assessment be performed for 38.8 %. The prescription of nutritional supplements was not less than 50 %. Health workers rated their performance as satisfactory or very satisfactory (51.7 %), and this was not related to hospital size but to having implemented a COVID-19 diet (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS clinical nutrition in Spain has responded to the COVID-19 pandemic with organizational and managerial changes and, although care has been clearly affected, some quality standards were ultimately maintained. Larger hospitals have had some advantages in making these adjustments.","Martín Folgueras, Tomás; Benítez Brito, Néstor; Vidal Casariego, Alfonso; Luengo Pérez, Luis Miguel; Irles Rocamora, José Antonio",Nutricion hospitalaria,293,28

SIRT1 is an NAD+-dependent protein deacetylase which activates HBV transcription by promoting the activity of cellular transcription factors and coactivators. How SIRT1 and viral transactivator X protein (HBx) might affect each other remains to be clarified. In this study we show synergy and mutual dependence between SIRT1 and HBx in the activation of HBV transcription. All human sirtuins SIRT1 through SIRT7 activated HBV gene expression. The steady-state levels of SIRT1 protein were elevated in HBV-infected liver tissues and HBV-replicating hepatoma cells. SIRT1 interacted with HBx and potentiated HBx transcriptional activity on precore promoter and covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) likely through a deacetylase-independent mechanism, leading to more robust production of cccDNA, pregenomic RNA and surface antigen. SIRT1 and HBx proteins were more abundant when both were expressed. SIRT1 promoted the recruitment of HBx as well as cellular transcriptional factors and coactivators such as PGC-1α and FXRα to cccDNA. Depletion of SIRT1 suppressed HBx recruitment. On the other hand, SIRT1 recruitment to cccDNA was compromised when HBx was deficient. Whereas pharmaceutical agonists of SIRT1 such as resveratrol activated HBV transcription, small-molecule inhibitors of SIRT1 including sirtinol and Ex527 exhibited anti-HBV activity. Taken together, our findings revealed not only the interplay between SIRT1 and HBx in the activation of HBV transcription but also new strategies and compounds for developing antivirals against HBV.","Deng, Jian-Jun; Kong, Ka-Yiu Edwin; Gao, Wei-Wei; Tang, Hei-Man Vincent; Chaudhary, Vidyanath; Cheng, Yun; Zhou, Jie; Chan, Chi-Ping; Wong, Danny Ka-Ho; Yuen, Man-Fung; Jin, Dong-Yan",Biochimica et biophysica acta.

To date it is unknown if using videoconference facilities is cost effective. Therefore we performed a cost analysis of using a high-speed internet video conferencing system compared with conventional face-to-face MDT meetings. METHODS Costs of running a conventional MDT meeting versus a video conferencing MDT were modelled and compared over a two-year period. Participants were also surveyed on the overall effectiveness of conducting remote MDTs. RESULTS The set up and maintenance cost of the video conferencing system over two years was £30400. The staff costs of running the face-to-face MDT were £95970 and the video conferencing MDT was £23992.50. The total travel costs of the conventional face-to-face MDTs were £10555.34. In total the cost of the conventional face-to-face MDT was £106525.34 and the video conferencing MDT was £54392.50 representing a cost saving of 48.9%.

DATA SOURCES We examine radical prostatectomy in the United States and England between 2005 and 2017, using de-identified administrative claims data from the OptumLabs Data Warehouse in the United States and the Hospital Episodes Statistics in England. STUDY DESIGN We conducted a longitudinal analysis of robotic, laparoscopic, and open surgery for radical prostatectomy. We compared the trends of adoption over time within and across countries. Next, we explored whether differential adoption patterns in the two health systems are associated with differences in volumes and patient characteristics. Finally, we explored the relationship between these adoption patterns and length of stay, 30-day readmission, and urology follow-up visits. DATA COLLECTION Open, laparoscopic, and robotic radical prostatectomies are identified using Office of Population Censuses and Surveys Classification of Interventions and Procedures (OPCS) codes in England and International Classification of Diseases ninth revision (ICD9), ICD10, and Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes in the United States. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS We identified 66,879 radical prostatectomies in England and 79,358 in the United States during 2005-2017. In both countries, open surgery dominates until 2009, where it is overtaken by minimally invasive surgery. The adaptation of robotic surgery is faster in the United States. The adoption rates and, as a result, the observed centralization of volume, have been different across countries. In both countries, patients undergoing radical prostatectomies are older and have more comorbidities. Minimally invasive techniques show decreased length of stay and 30-day readmissions compared to open surgery. In the United States, robotic approaches were associated with lower length of stay and readmissions when compared to laparoscopic. CONCLUSIONS Robotic surgery has become the standard approach for radical proctectomy in the United States and England, showing decreased length of stay and in 30-day readmissions compared to open surgery. Adoption rates and specialization differ across countries, likely a product of differences in cost-containment efforts.","Maynou, Laia; Mehtsun, Winta T; Serra-Sastre, Victoria; Papanicolas, Irene",Health services research,293,17

The aim of the study was to investigate the effect of autologous PRP on the osteogenic potential of combining bovine porous bone mineral (BPBM) and bio-guide membrane (BGM) in promoting mandible bicortical bony defects in rabbits. METHODS One circular mandible bicortical bony defects were created in each of 54 rabbits, which were divided into 3 groups: group 1: 18 of the defects were left unfilled as a negative control; group 2: 18 of the defects were grafted with autologous PRP and BPBM/BGM; group 3: 18 of the defects were grafted with BPBM/BGM without PRP. Animals were killed at 4, 8, and 12 weeks after operation. Harvested tissue and specimens were evaluated histologically and radiographically, and metabolized observation was performed. Histological parameters associated with osteoblast activities, bone trabecula, neovascularization, newly formed mineralized bone, rudimental grafts and connective tissue formation were measured. Densities of the bones at 4, 8, and 12 weeks were studied by radiographic. The bone defect closure ratio was measured at 12 weeks. The bone metabolized parameter alkaline phosphatase was also measured and compared between 4, 8, and 12 weeks. RESULTS The platelet concentration of PRP is 4.19- to 4.43-fold to that of the whole blood. Histological analysis showed new bone formation at all therapeutic sites including BPBM/BGM grafts with or without PRP. A statistically significant difference in new bone formation between group PRP/BPBM/BGM and group BPBM/BGM was observed. Untreated defects of group control showed the less bone regeneration. There was significant difference of bone density between group PRP/BPBM/BGM and control, and group BPBM/BGM and control, at 4, 8, and 12 weeks postoperative. There were more bone defects filling, and the grafts were absorbed at 12 weeks of group PRP/BPBM/BGM compared with group BPBM/BGM. Defects treated with PRP/BPBM/BGM demonstrated significantly increased activity of osteoblasts, enhanced amount of mitochondria and rough endoplasmic reticulum in osteoblasts, and increased concentration of alkaline phosphatase at 4, 8, and 12 weeks compared with those treated with BPBM/BGM and control group. Complete closure ratio of bone defects treated with PRP/BPBM/BGM (50%) was significantly increased compared with that treated with BPBM/BGM (16.6%). CONCLUSIONS The study suggested that PRP combination of BPBM and BGM had significant therapeutic effects on mandible bicortical bony defects of rabbits. The effects are associated with the high concentration of platelet in PRP and the porous configuration of BPBM. Although we cannot reveal the detailed statistical relationship of PRP on promoting BPBM/GBM osteoinductive effects, PRP demonstrated superior results of bone regeneration.","Chen, Tie-Lou; Lu, Hui-Jie; Liu, Guo-qin; Tang, Da-Hai; Zhang, Xin-hai; Pan, Zhu-Lin; Wang, Shi-Feng; Zhang, Qing-fu",The Journal of craniofacial surgery,293,7

Though small differences in VATS methods exist, it is commonly accepted as a non-rib-spreading approach into the thoracic cavity via 2-4 incisions and allows for a wide range of anatomical and nonanatomical pulmonary resections. As more experience is gained with VATS, more complex surgeries take place and greater refinement of the technique occurs. A newer single-incision or uniportal VATS has been described to minimize surgical trauma, to decrease the number and size of thoracic incisions, to reduce the number of complications, and to enable faster recovery.

The type and size of surgical defects, mean operative time, morbidity, mortality and rate of recurrence at one-year follow-up were retrospectively analysed. RESULTS We performed 87 LIVHR: 51.7% for incisional hernia and 48.3% for epigastric or umbilical hernias. Mean operative time was 100 min., conversion rate was 3.4%. The mean size of abdominal defect was 6 cm (range: 2-15); in relation to umbilical hernias, mean size was 5.4 cm (range: 2-8). The mortality rate was 0%; overall morbidity was 16%. At one-year follow-up, we observed two cases of hernia recurrences. CONCLUSIONS LIVHR using PARIETEX(™) Composite mesh is an effective and safe procedure with very low morbidity and low rates of postoperative pain and recurrence, especially in hernias with diameter of between 5 and 15 cm and in obese patients without previous laparotomies.","Nardi, Mario Junior; Millo, Paolo; Brachet Contul, Riccardo; Fabozzi, Massimiliano; Persico, Fabio; Roveroni, Maurizio; Lale Murix, Elena; Bocchia, Paolo; Lorusso, Riccardo; Gatti, Aurelio; Grivon, Manuela; Allieta, Rosaldo",Minimally invasive therapy & allied technologies : MITAT : official journal of the Society for Minimally Invasive Therapy,293,19

Besides conventional care, pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) is an equally important treatment for patients with COVID-19 suffering from respiratory, physical and psychological disease. The aim of this study is to investigate the role of PR on the inpatients with severe COVID-19. METHODS This study was a self-pre- and post-control prospective clinical trial, which totally recruited 31 inpatients confirmed COVID-19 by RT-PCR. They were performed 3-weeks PR. The demographic data, medical records, symptoms, laboratory findings and chest computed tomographic (CT) scans of patients were collected at baseline. The effect of PR was assessed by questionnaires before PR as well as after 2- and 3-weeks PR. RESULTS After 3-weeks PR and treatment, neutrophil percentage decreased, while lymphocyte percentage and lymphocyte count increased (before vs. 2 weeks after PR respectively: P=0.001; P=0.001; P<0.0001). Besides, CRP and procalcitonin reduced significantly (before vs. after respectively: P<0.0001; P=0.023). Patients' oxygen intake decreased and oxygen saturation increased significantly. Meanwhile, PR relieved the patients' symptoms of cough and dyspnea, improved the patients' self-care ability, physical fitness and mental state significantly. Activities of daily living (ADL) score increased and Modified Medical Research Council Dyspnea Scale (mMRC) decreased after PR. CONCLUSIONS PR can relieve symptoms, enhance health-related quality of life, improve respiratory muscle function and alleviate disease-related anxiety and depression of severe patients with COVID-19. PR should be provided throughout the diseases management process, regardless of whether the patient is hospitalized or at home.","Sun, Jiaolin; Liu, Jia; Li, Hong; Shang, Cuixia; Li, Tingting; Ji, Wenwen; Wu, Jing; Han, Xu; Shi, Zhihong",Annals of palliative medicine,293,12

The expression of senescence-associated β-galactosidase of MSCs from three human donors (both bone marrow- and adipose tissue-derived) was suppressed on PDA. The MSCs on the PDA-coated substrate showed a lower level of interleukin 6 (IL-6), one of the senescence-associated inflammatory components. Cellular senescence-specific genes, such as p53 and p21, were downregulated on the PDA-coated substrate, while the stemness-related gene, OCT4, was upregulated. The PDA-coated substrate strongly promoted the proliferation rate of MSCs, while the stem cell character and differentiation potential were retained.

Despite its frequency, abdominoplasty is still associated with high complication rates. OBJECTIVES The authors compared clinical and economic data of 4 methods of energy-based tissue dissection in a randomized, open-label study. METHODS A total of 57 patients were preoperatively randomized into 4 groups: electrocautery, Ultracision Harmonic Scalpel, argon plasma coagulation, and PEAK-Plasmablade. Demographic and operational data as well as information on the postoperative course and complications were collected. For economic analysis, quotes were obtained from the device companies or official suppliers. RESULTS Duration of surgery, drainage quantity, and wound healing complications did not differ significantly between groups. The Ultracision method caused significantly greater blood loss compared with all other techniques (P < 0.01). PEAK and Ultracision devices entailed greater surgical costs compared with APC and electrocautery. CONCLUSIONS All methods evaluated can be applied safely and effectively in abdominoplasty procedures. However, these data demonstrate a significantly higher blood loss for the Ultracision Harmonic Scalpel. Considering the clinical data, the higher costs of PEAK and Ultracision methods appear unjustified.

ARDS is defined as the onset of hypoxemia, tachypnea, and loss of lung compliance due to some stimulus. In the United States, the incidence of ARDS has been growing because it is being increasingly recognized. The incidence of ARDS has also gone up recently due to the COVID-19 pandemic. AREAS OF UNCERTAINTY To date, there is no known one treatment for ARDS. Multiple studies have looked into various causes of ARDS, pathophysiology, and ventilation and management strategies. However, there is still considerable variability in the treatment and management of these patients from institution to institution. DATA SOURCES A literature search was conducted through PubMed and Google Scholar. Publications describing the epidemiology, diagnostic criteria, pathophysiology, and treatment were included in this review. RESULTS The definition of ARDS has evolved over the years. The most recent and agreed upon diagnostic criteria are based on the Berlin criteria for ARDS. Management of patients with ARDS includes low tidal volume ventilation, prone ventilation, paralysis in certain patient populations, and perhaps extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). This also applies to patients with ARDS due to COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS Patients with ARDS have a high mortality due to the incredibly complex disease process. Because of the complexity of ARDS, the management and treatment is equally as difficult. This article reviews some of the strategies used to date, including the role of ECMO, and includes some society recommendations. Further research must be done into which methods best guide lung ventilation in severe ARDS and patients on ECMO.","Hasan, Zubair",American journal of therapeutics,293,12

Methods An analysis was performed using Stata 15.0, and Q-test was used to evaluate the heterogeneity of the included studies. Results The most common symptoms were found to be fever (64.78%), cough (59.81%) and shortness of breath or dyspnea (23.86%). Of this 88.73% patients demonstrated typical COVID-19 signs on chest CT or X-ray. Intubation was carried out in 35.87% of patients, and 4.95% of mothers were admitted to the intensive care unit, where the rate of maternal death was <0.01% and that of premature delivery was 25.32%. The rate of the birth weight being <2,500 g was 30.65% and that of Neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission was 24.41%. Positive nasopharynx swabs or sputum from newborns was <0.01%. Conclusions Pregnant patients with COVID-19 most commonly presented with fever, cough, shortness of breath and dyspnea, most of which possessed imaging manifestations. The risk of intubation and admission to intensive care unit were high. The risk of premature delivery was higher, leading to a high risk of NICU admission and low neonatal birthweight.

It is possible that it is behavioural relevance rather than object plausibility per se which drives this effect. Here, we manipulated the biological relevance of objects (face or a non-face) and tested whether object relevance affects behavioural sensitivity and neural responses to depth-position. In a first experiment, we presented human observers with disparity-defined faces and non-faces, and observers were asked to judge the depth position of the target under signal-noise and clear (fine) task conditions. In the second experiment, we concurrently measured behavioural and fMRI responses to depth. We found that behavioural performance varied across stimulus conditions such that they were significantly worse for the upright face than the inverted face and the random shape in the SNR task, but worse for the random shape than the upright face in the feature task. Pattern analysis of fMRI responses revealed that activity of FFA was distinctly different during depth judgments of the upright face versus the other two stimuli, with its responses (and to a stronger extent, those of V3) appearing functionally-relevant to behavioural performance. We speculate that FFA is not only involved in object analysis, but exerts considerable influence on stereoscopic mechanisms as early as in V3 based on a broader appreciation of the stimulus' behavioural relevance.Significance StatementWe asked how disparity sensitivity is modulated by object (biological) relevance using behavioural and neuroimaging paradigms. We show that behavioural sensitivity to depth-position changes in biological (face) vs non-biological (random surface) contexts, and that these changes are task-dependent. Imaging results highlight a potentially key role of the fusiform region for governing the modulation of stereo encoding by object relevance. These findings highlight powerful interactions between object recognition mechanisms and stereoencoding, such that the utility of disparity information may be up/down weighed depending on the biological relevance of the object.","Chou, Idy W Y; Ban, Hiroshi; Chang, Dorita H F",eNeuro,293,1

Because substantial mortality and morbidity are associated with this procedure, its safety and diagnostic yield should be validated. METHODS Sixty-four patients with diffuse interstitial lung disease who received SLB by videothoracoscopy between 2007 and 2013 were retrospectively analyzed for mortality, surgical complication, and diagnosis. Criteria for the procedure included patients <70-year old, who had at least 60 % vital capacity and at least 40 % diffusion capacity. Patients with radiologically definite usual interstitial pneumonia were not eligible. RESULTS One conversion from the 3-port approach to thoracotomy due to bleeding occurred. Mean operation and anesthesia times were 63 and 133 min, respectively. The mean hospital stay was 6 days. Only 10 patients (16 %) received prophylactic steroid and/or elastase inhibitor administration. Neither deaths nor acute exacerbations of interstitial pneumonia occurred within 60 days after surgery. Pneumothorax occurred in four cases (6 %) after discharge, which was associated with lower % vital capacity and intraoperative steroid administration. Prolonged air leak and postoperative pneumonia were observed in 2 and 1 patients, respectively. Postoperative diagnosis was obtained in all patients. A group of connective tissue disease-related interstitial pneumonia (n = 15) and chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis (n = 18) were the major diagnoses. Discordance between pre- and postoperative diagnoses was observed among usual interstitial pneumonia, non-specific interstitial pneumonia, and chronic hypersensitivity pneumonia.

OBJECTIVE The aim of the study was to assess if tranexamic acid is safe, reduces haematoma expansion and improves outcomes in adults with spontaneous intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH). DESIGN The TICH-2 (Tranexamic acid for hyperacute primary IntraCerebral Haemorrhage) study was a pragmatic, Phase III, prospective, double-blind, randomised placebo-controlled trial. SETTING Acute stroke services at 124 hospitals in 12 countries (Denmark, Georgia, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Malaysia, Poland, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey and the UK). PARTICIPANTS Adult patients (aged ≥ 18 years) with ICH within 8 hours of onset. EXCLUSION CRITERIA Exclusion criteria were ICH secondary to anticoagulation, thrombolysis, trauma or a known underlying structural abnormality; patients for whom tranexamic acid was thought to be contraindicated; prestroke dependence (i.e. patients with a modified Rankin Scale [mRS] score > 4); life expectancy < 3 months; and a Glasgow Coma Scale score of < 5. INTERVENTIONS Participants, allocated by randomisation, received 1 g of an intravenous tranexamic acid bolus followed by an 8-hour 1-g infusion or matching placebo (i.e. 0.9% saline). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE The primary outcome was functional status (death or dependency) at day 90, which was measured by the shift in the mRS score, using ordinal logistic regression, with adjustment for stratification and minimisation criteria. RESULTS A total of 2325 participants (tranexamic acid, n = 1161; placebo, n = 1164) were recruited from 124 hospitals in 12 countries between 2013 and 2017. Treatment groups were well balanced at baseline. The primary outcome was determined for 2307 participants (tranexamic acid, n = 1152; placebo, n = 1155). There was no statistically significant difference between the treatment groups for the primary outcome of functional status at day 90 [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 0.88, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.76 to 1.03; p = 0.11]. Although there were fewer deaths by day 7 in the tranexamic acid group (aOR 0.73, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.99; p = 0.041), there was no difference in case fatality at 90 days (adjusted hazard ratio 0.92, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.10; p = 0.37). Fewer patients experienced serious adverse events (SAEs) after treatment with tranexamic acid than with placebo by days 2 (p = 0.027), 7 (p = 0.020) and 90 (p = 0.039). There was no increase in thromboembolic events or seizures. LIMITATIONS Despite attempts to enrol patients rapidly, the majority of participants were enrolled and treated > 4.5 hours after stroke onset. Pragmatic inclusion criteria led to a heterogeneous population of participants, some of whom had very large strokes. Although 12 countries enrolled participants, the majority (82.1%) were from the UK. CONCLUSIONS Tranexamic acid did not affect a patient's functional status at 90 days after ICH, despite there being significant modest reductions in early death (by 7 days), haematoma expansion and SAEs, which is consistent with an antifibrinolytic effect. Tranexamic acid was safe, with no increase in thromboembolic events. FUTURE WORK Future work should focus on enrolling and treating patients early after stroke and identify which participants are most likely to benefit from haemostatic therapy.

We propose that DNA damage induced-apoptosis accelerates viral release, triggered by depletion of host RNA binding proteins (RBPs) from nuclear RNA bound to replicating viral sequences. Methods: Information theory-based analysis of interactions between RBPs and individual sequences in the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), Influenza A (H3N1), HIV-1, and Dengue genomes identifies strong RBP binding sites in these viral genomes. Replication and expression of viral sequences is expected to increasingly sequester RBPs - SRSF1 and RNPS1. Ordinarily, RBPs bound to nascent host transcripts prevents their annealing to complementary DNA. Their depletion induces destabilizing R-loops. Chromosomal breakage occurs when an excess of unresolved R-loops collide with incoming replication forks, overwhelming the DNA repair machinery. We estimated stoichiometry of inhibition of RBPs in host nuclear RNA by counting competing binding sites in replicating viral genomes and host RNA. Results: Host RBP binding sites are frequent and conserved among different strains of RNA viral genomes. Similar binding motifs of SRSF1 and RNPS1 explain why DNA damage resulting from SRSF1 depletion is complemented by expression of RNPS1. Clustering of strong RBP binding sites coincides with the distribution of RNA-DNA hybridization sites across the genome. SARS-CoV-2 replication is estimated to require 32.5-41.8 hours to effectively compete for binding of an equal proportion of SRSF1 binding sites in host encoded nuclear RNAs. Significant changes in expression of transcripts encoding DNA repair and apoptotic proteins were found in an analysis of influenza A and Dengue-infected cells in some individuals. Conclusions: R-loop-induced apoptosis indirectly resulting from viral replication could release significant quantities of membrane-associated virions into neighboring alveoli. These could infect adjacent pneumocytes and other tissues, rapidly compromising lung function, causing multiorgan system failure and other described symptoms.","Rogan, Peter K; Mucaki, Eliseos J; Shirley, Ben C",F1000Research,293,7

The COVID-19 pandemic, together with the applied multi-level restrictive measures, has generated a unique combination of an unpredictable and stressful biomedical and socioeconomic environment (i.e., syndemic),2 introducing real-life threat, involuntary and drastic every-day life-style changes with uncertain financial and future prospects, alongside with minimized coping and stress management possibilities.3 This combination of so many different and vital stressors may lead to acute as well as long-term, direct, indirect and even transgenerational unfavourable effects on physical and mental health and functioning, which might even represent the most precarious and still unpredictable public-health-related part of the pandemic.4 Thereby, specific population groups could be at particular risk of poor health outcomes in relation to applied public health measures.4, 5 However, not every individual will experience the same level of negative impact on health and well-being during the pandemic, as several additional national, socioeconomic, environmental, behavioural, emotional and cognitive factors can moderate individual resilience and coping.6 Pandemic-related research should, thus, assess as many multidimensional risk and protective factors as possible in a longitudinal, large-scale and multi-national manner, enabling a profound and comprehensive understanding of the complex health and societal impact of the pandemic worldwide.7 Nevertheless, to date, most research findings are cross-sectional, report on small and non- representative samples from individual countries, or on specific population groups (e.g., health care workers, students, clinical populations) and usually assess only a very restricted set of outcomes and time-points. Thereby, only few studies assess coping strategies, medical history or detailed socioeconomic, demographic and environmental data. In addition, most studies leave behind linguistic differences, being available in one or at best two different languages. Such investigations of small outcome subsets within a narrow framework preclude a broader and clear understanding of the multifaceted pandemic impact on the general population and specific subgroups. Acknowledging these gaps in the existing literature, large- scale, collaborative research prospectively collecting and monitoring a broad range of real- time, multi-dimensional health-related, societal and behavioural outcome data from countries across the globe is currently explicitly needed. The Collaborative Outcomes study on Health and Functioning during Infection Times (COH- FIT) envisions to fill this gap. Based on an easy-to-access webpage (www.coh-fit.com), COH- FIT is the currently largest-scale known international collaborative study of over 200 researchers around the globe, prospectively collecting the biggest set of multi-dimensional and multi-disciplinary data from 150 high, middle, and low-income countries in over 30 languages and in three different age groups (adults, adolescents, children) of the general population, focusing also on relevant at-risk subgroups. Albeit being a cross-sectional anonymous survey on an individual level, it is a longitudinal study on a population level, as data are collected continuously since April 2020 and until the WHO declares the end of the pandemic. In addition to snowball recruitment, this project also collects information from nationally representative samples. Furthermore, COH-FIT is the first study of this scale investigating pandemic effects on health and functioning measures between family members, while it also specifically assesses a large list of behavioral and coping factors (e.g., screen time, social media usage, physical activity, social interaction, religious practices, etc.) on outcomes of interest. COH-FIT also monitors changes in public health restrictive measures to enhance data harmonization across nations and time, and to better investigate their impact on physical and mental health, while it also collects information on changes in healthcare systems functioning. The COH-FIT project was worldwide first initiated in Greece after the ethics committee approval of the School of Medicine of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki and is officially supported by the Hellenic Psychiatric Association, European Psychiatric Association, World Association of Social Psychiatry, ECNP Network on the Prevention of Mental Disorders and Mental Health Promotion, among many other national and international scientific associations. To date, COH-FIT has already collected >115,000 participations worldwide (>8,000 in Greece), but more participants are still needed, both during the second and third wave of the pandemic, as in the future, after the pandemic has ended. Currently, the COH-FIT survey actively collects the largest sample on multifactorial data on the impact of the COVD-19 pandemic on health and functioning not only in Greece, but around the globe. The elaborated design of COH-FIT and similar studies may allow a better identification of key parameters and population groups at increased risk during the pandemic, as well as potential targets for acute and long-term prevention or intervention strategies in the current as in possible future pandemics. A profound understanding of the health and societal impact of the pandemic could facilitate an optimized governmental, social and individual health preparedness during infection times8 and the bridging of individuals', societal and systemic needs and actions through multi-level guideline development with the aim to improve mental health outcomes globally.","Agorastos, Agorastos; Tsamakis, Konstantinos; Solmi, Marco; Correll, Christoph U; Bozikas, Vasilis P",Psychiatrike = Psychiatriki,293,1

Additionally we have investigated their correlation with the most frequently used clinical parameters CRP, LDH, and NLR in serum from moderate and severe COVID-19 patients hospitalized in a tertiary hospital.Methods: PAT and d-ROMs were determined by analytical photometric metric method in serum from 50 hospitalized patients. For each of them, two samples were collected and analyzed immediately after collection seven days apart.Results: All patients at admission had a much higher value for plasma peroxides and a significant correlation between oxidative stress parameters and CRP, LDH, and NLR. (p<0.05), except for OS index (OSI) vs CRP in the severe group. At discharge, plasma peroxides were reduced and OSI was improved in the moderate group.Conclusion: We consider that using OSI at the beginning of COVID-19 disease presents a valuable starting point for the general assessment of oxidative stress and hence enabling a better triage of the patients in terms of disease severity.","Zendelovska, Dragica; Atanasovska, Emilija; Petrushevska, Marija; Spasovska, Katerina; Stevanovikj, Milena; Demiri, Ilir; Labachevski, Nikola",Romanian journal of internal medicine = Revue roumaine de medecine interne,293,1

Comprehensive Medical Evaluation and Assessment of Comorbidities: Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes-2021.,19.632677,7.1741834,2021-01-01,"BACKGROUND Poorly controlled asthma and preventable exacerbations place a significant strain on healthcare, often requiring additional medications, hospital stays or treatment in the emergency department.Long-acting beta2-agonists (LABA) are the preferred add-on treatment for adults with asthma whose symptoms are not well controlled on inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), but have important safety concerns in asthma. Long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMA) have confirmed efficacy in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and are now being considered as an alternative add-on therapy for people with uncontrolled asthma. OBJECTIVES To assess the efficacy and safety of adding a LAMA to ICS compared with adding a LABA for adults whose asthma is not well controlled on ICS alone. SEARCH METHODS We searched the Cochrane Airways Group's Specialised Register (CAGR) from inception to April 2015, and imposed no restriction on language of publication. We searched additional resources to pick up unpublished studies, including ClinicalTrials.gov, World Health Organization trials portal, reference lists of primary studies and existing reviews, and manufacturers' trial registries. The most recent search was conducted in April 2015. SELECTION CRITERIA We searched for parallel and cross-over RCTs in which adults whose asthma was not well controlled with ICS alone were randomised to receive LAMA add-on or LABA add-on for at least 12 weeks. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two review authors independently screened the electronic and additional searches and extracted data from study reports. We used Covidence for duplicate screening, extraction of study characteristics and numerical data, and risk of bias ratings.The pre-specified primary outcomes were exacerbations requiring oral corticosteroids (OCS), quality of life and serious adverse events. MAIN RESULTS We included eight studies meeting the inclusion criteria, but four double-blind, double-dummy studies of around 2000 people dominated the analyses. These four trials were between 14 and 24 weeks long, all comparing tiotropium (usually Respimat) with salmeterol on top of medium doses of ICS.Studies reporting exacerbations requiring OCS showed no difference between the two add-ons, but our confidence in the effect was low due to inconsistency between studies and because the confidence intervals (CI) included significant benefit of either treatment (odds ratio (OR) 1.05, 95% CI 0.50 to 2.18; 1753 participants; 3 studies); three more people per 1000 might have an exacerbation on LAMA, but the CIs ranged from 29 fewer to 61 more. Imprecision was also an issue for serious adverse events and exacerbations requiring hospital admission, rated low (serious adverse events) and very low quality (exacerbations requiring hospital admission), because there were so few events in the analyses.People taking LAMA scored slightly worse on two scales measuring quality of life (Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire; AQLQ) and asthma control (Asthma Control Questionnaire; ACQ); the evidence was rated high quality but the effects were small and unlikely to be clinically significant (AQLQ: mean difference (MD) -0.12, 95% CI -0.18 to -0.05; 1745 participants; 1745; 4 studies; ACQ: MD 0.06, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.13; 1483 participants; 3 studies).There was some evidence to support small benefits of LAMA over LABA on lung function, including on our pre-specified preferred measure trough forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) (MD 0.05 L, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.09; 1745 participants, 4 studies). However, the effects on other measures varied, and it is not clear whether the magnitude of the differences were clinically significant.More people had adverse events on LAMA but the difference with LABA was not statistically significant. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS Direct evidence of LAMA versus LABA as add-on therapy is currently limited to studies of less than six months comparing tiotropium (Respimat) to salmeterol, and we do not know how they compare in terms of exacerbations and serious adverse events. There was moderate quality evidence that LAMAs show small benefits over LABA on some measures of lung function, and high quality evidence that LABAs are slightly better for quality of life, but the differences were all small. Given the much larger evidence base for LABA versus placebo for people whose asthma is not well controlled on ICS, the current evidence is not strong enough to say that LAMA can be substituted for LABA as add-on therapy.The results of this review, alongside pending results from related reviews assessing the use of LAMA in other clinical scenarios, will help to define the role of these drugs in asthma and it is important that they be updated as results from ongoing and planned trials emerge.","Kew, Kayleigh M; Evans, David J W; Allison, Debbie E; Boyter, Anne C",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,293,1

Antimicrobial, non-antibiotic biomaterials have the potential to reduce bacterial adhesion to the mesh surface and adjacent tissues while avoiding the development of novel antibiotic resistance. This study assesses the efficacy of presoaking reticular polypropylene meshes in chlorhexidine or a chlorhexidine and allicin combination (a natural antibacterial agent) for preventing bacterial infection in a short-time hernia-repair rabbit model. METHODS Partial hernia defects (5 x 2 cm) were created on the lateral right side of the abdominal wall of New Zealand White rabbits (n = 21). The defects were inoculated with 0.5 mL of a 106 CFU/mL Staphylococcus aureus ATCC25923 strain and repaired with a DualMesh Plus antimicrobial mesh or a Surgipro mesh presoaked in either chlorhexidine (0.05%) or allicin-chlorhexidine (900 μg/mL-0.05%). Fourteen days post-implant, mesh contraction was measured and tissue specimens were harvested to evaluate bacterial adhesion to the implant surface (via sonication, S. aureus immunolabeling), host-tissue incorporation (via staining, scanning electron microscopy) and macrophage response (via RAM-11 immunolabeling). RESULTS The polypropylene mesh showed improved tissue integration relative to the DualMesh Plus. Both the DualMesh Plus and the chlorhexidine-soaked polypropylene meshes exhibited high bacterial clearance, with the latter material showing lower bacterial yields. The implants from the allicin-chlorhexidine group displayed a neoformed tissue containing differently sized abscesses and living bacteria, as well as a diminished macrophage response. The allicin-chlorhexidine coated implants exhibited the highest contraction. CONCLUSIONS The presoaking of reticular polypropylene materials with a low concentration of chlorhexidine provides the mesh with antibacterial activity without disrupting tissue integration. Due to the similarities found with the antimicrobial DualMesh Plus material, the chlorhexidine concentration tested could be utilized as a prophylactic treatment to resist infection by prosthetic mesh during hernia repair.","Pérez-Köhler, Bárbara; García-Moreno, Francisca; Brune, Thierry; Pascual, Gemma; Bellón, Juan Manuel",PloS one,293,1

These derivatives constitute intermediates in the synthesis of indole (ervatamine-silicine) alkaloids and share a tetracyclic structure with an indole and a piperidine fused to a seven-membered carbocyclic ring. Structure-activity relationship studies indicated the importance of substituent at C-6 position and especially the presence of a benzylester for the activity and cytotoxicity of the molecules. In addition, the stereochemistry at C-7 and C-8 positions, as well as the presence of oxazolidine ring influenced the potency of the compounds. Mechanism of action studies with two analogues of this family (compounds 22 and trans-14) showed that this class of molecules can suppress viral infection during the later stages of the replication cycle (RNA replication/assembly). Moreover, a cell-dependent antiviral profile of the compounds against several Zika strains was observed, thus possibly implying the involvement of cellular factor(s) in the activity of the molecules. Sequencing of compounds-resistant Zika mutants revealed a single non-synonymous amino acid mutation (aspartic acid to histidine) at the beginning of the predicted transmembrane domain 1 of NS4B protein, which plays a vital role in the formation of the viral replication complex. To conclude, our study provides detailed information on a new class of NS4B-associated inhibitors and strengthens the importance of identifying host-viral interactions in order to tackle flavivirus infections.","Fikatas, Antonios; Vervaeke, Peter; Meyen, Eef; Llor, Nuria; Ordeix, Sergi; Boonen, Ine; Bletsa, Magda; Kafetzopoulou, Liana Eleni; Lemey, Philippe; Amat, Mercedes; Pannecouque, Christophe; Schols, Dominique",Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,293,1

Expanded collection of demographic data, including socioeconomic status (employment, income, education) and comorbidities, can enhance our understanding of the identified barriers, inform the development of interventions to overcome these barriers, and recognize their impact on treatment outcomes. A clinical trials screening tool was developed to collect expanded demographic data and barriers to trial enrollment; it has been implemented in the National Cancer Institute Clinical Oncology Research Program. The purpose of this article is to describe the development and implementation of the tool and to share information obtained during the first 43 months of its use. METHODS There were 19,373 entries collected; 74% of those screened enrolled in a clinical trial. Demographic characteristics were compared between those screened and those enrolled. They varied significantly between the groups. RESULTS Reasons for nonenrollment included ineligibility (50%), eligible but declined (47%), eligible but physician declined to offer participation (2%), and eligible but the study was suspended (1%). The most common reasons for ineligibility were failure to meet the protocol-specific stage of cancer, the presence of comorbidities, and the symptom-eligibility score was not met. The most common reason for eligible patients declining participation was that they had no desire to participate in research. CONCLUSIONS The tool provides valuable information about the characteristics of individuals who are screened and enrolled in National Cancer Institute-sponsored trials, as well as about barriers to enrollment in trials.

We categorized thyroid nodules as small (≤ 12 mL), medium (12 to 30 mL), or large (over 30 mL). BTNs volume reduction, thyroid function, cosmetic and compressive score changes and side effect evaluation at 6 and 12 months were evaluated. Results BTN volume decreased significantly from baseline to 6 (mean percentage decrease of BTN volume was 66.8 ± 13.6%, p < 0.001). At 12 months, the mean percentage reduction of BTN volume compared to six months was 13.7 ± 17.1% (p < 0.001). At 6-month, symptom score had improved significantly (p < 0.001) while it does not change significantly between 6 and 12 months. In particular, symptom score improved significantly in the medium (p < 0.001) and large (p < 0.01) subgroups. Cosmetic score improved significantly between baseline and 6 months (p < 0.001) and between 6 and 12 months (p < 0.01).

However, previous randomized controlled stroke trials were not focused on patients with mild-to-moderate symptoms. Thus, there are limited data for patient selection, prediction of clinical outcome, and occurrence of complications in this patient population. The purpose of this analysis was to assess clinical and interventional data in patients treated with mechanical thrombectomy in case of ischemic stroke with mild-to-moderate symptoms. MATERIALS AND METHODS We performed a retrospective analysis of a prospectively collected stroke data base. Inclusion criteria were anterior circulation ischemic stroke treated with mechanical thrombectomy at our institution between September 2010 and October 2015 with an NIHSS score of ≤8. RESULTS Of 484 patients, we identified 33 (6.8%) with the following characteristics: median NIHSS = 5 (interquartile range, 4-7), median onset-to-groin puncture time = 320 minutes (interquartile range, 237-528 minutes). Recanalization (TICI = 2b-3) was achieved in 26 (78.7%) patients. Two cases of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage were observed. Favorable (mRS 0-2) and moderate (mRS 0-3) clinical outcome at 90 days was achieved in 21 (63.6%) and 30 (90.9%) patients, respectively. CONCLUSIONS The clinical outcome of patients undergoing mechanical thrombectomy for acute ischemic stroke with mild stroke due to large-vessel occlusion appears to be predominately favorable, even in a prolonged time window. However, although infrequent, angiographic complications could impair clinical outcome. Future randomized controlled trials should assess the benefit compared with the best medical treatment.","Pfaff, J; Herweh, C; Pham, M; Schönenberger, S; Nagel, S; Ringleb, P A; Bendszus, M; Möhlenbruch, M",AJNR.

Both front-line battle and quarantine are stressful experiences that may make psychological support for healthcare workers necessary. Psychological support measures based on the best available evidence should be included in emergency plans worldwide. We summarise the research evidence on the psychological impact of quarantine on healthcare workers. METHODS We retrieved 470 articles on the psychological impact of quarantine on healthcare workers from the Web of Science and included in this review all 12 articles that met our inclusion criteria. RESULTS The reviewed studies reported acute stress during quarantine and long-lasting depressive, post-traumatic stress and alcohol dependency and abuse symptoms. Healthcare workers fear infection for themselves, but more so for their loved ones, and are also concerned about the stigma that may affect their families, most especially their children. CONCLUSIONS The safety of healthcare workers and their families during disease outbreaks needs to be ensured. Suitable alternative accommodation and personalised monitoring during quarantine are useful intervention measures to prevent adverse effects in healthcare workers. Clear public health communication will help reduce uncertainty, guilt and stigma. Financial aid should be considered for the more severely affected workers. Finally, mental healthcare for healthcare workers should be a priority, as quarantines can be a mental distress trigger. The development of efficient referral paths and the provision of counselling or psychotherapy during the confinement period are an opportunity for early mental health interventions.","Gómez-Durán, Esperanza L; Martin-Fumadó, Carles; Forero, Carlos G",Occupational and environmental medicine,293,28

Across six experiments, we demonstrate that beat gestures influence the explicit and implicit perception of lexical stress (e.g., distinguishing OBject from obJECT), and in turn, can influence what vowels listeners hear. Thus, we provide converging evidence for a manual McGurk effect: even the simplest ‘flicks of the hands’ influence which speech sounds we hear. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Beat gestures are very common in human face-to-face communication. Yet we know little about their behavioral consequences for spoken language comprehension. We demonstrate that beat gestures influence the explicit and implicit perception of lexical stress, and, in turn, can even shape what vowels we think we hear. This demonstration of a manual McGurk effect provides some of the first empirical support for a recent multimodal, situated psycholinguistic framework of human communication, while challenging current models of spoken word recognition that do not yet incorporate multimodal prosody. Moreover, it has the potential to enrich human-computer interaction and improve multimodal speech recognition systems.","Bosker, Hans Rutger; Peeters, David",bioRxiv,293,1

It is assumed that wearing such masks reduces the likelihood for an infected person to spread the disease, but many of these mask designs have not been tested in practice. We have applied a simple optical measurement method to evaluate the efficacy of masks to reduce the transmission of respiratory droplets during regular speech. We compare a variety of commonly available mask types and observe that some mask types approach the performance of standard surgical masks, while some mask alternatives, such as neck fleece or bandanas, offer very little protection. Our measurement setup is inexpensive and can be built and operated by non-experts, allowing for rapid evaluation of mask performance during speech, sneezing, or coughing.","Fischer, E.

The virus causes COVID-19, an infectious disease. SARS-CoV-2 provides novel clinical, immunological, and pathological features, compared to other established coronaviruses, such as the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV). There is no indication of successful antiviral treatment or vaccination at this stage. Several computational methods have been used to quickly understand the pathogenesis of viruses and to classify antiviral medications. Protein–protein interaction networks allow us to understand pathogenic pathways that contribute to the disease, infection, and development and to translate this knowledge to effective diagnostics and therapeutic strategies. The conventional approach to drug intervention and treatment interventions started to evolve with the complexity of dependence and drug pathways. Identifying drug–target interactions cannot only minimize drug production cycles and costs but can also strengthen awareness of how the future drugs and targets are identified. The purpose of a pharmaceutical network is to classify multi-target compounds focused at different protein groups involved in disrupted complexes. This promotes a network-centered viewpoint on drug action via the mapping of the goal network and offers a fresh insight into the role of polypharmacology in the drug operation. In this chapter, we shall address the available experiments and computations of protein–protein interaction methods to identify SARS-CoV-2 drugs.","Kumar, S.",Methods Pharmacol. Toxicol..,293,25

As countries begin to reframe the role of arts and culture in shaping a world affected by a global pandemic, museums will need to address not only practical measures – such as social distancing guidelines and limited visitor numbers – but also how these institutions are situated within the greater social context. Technology is particularly useful for museums to share their collections with audiences and transcend geographical boundaries, and it also allows these institutions to reposition themselves as relevant within the ongoing cultural heritage dialogue and context. However, it is debatable whether online and digital offerings classify as museums. Even if there is no consensus on the textbook definition of museum, pinpointing common traits will help establish their evolution and role for current and future generations. Embracing digitization, virtual museums, and other non-traditional frameworks allows for a more expansive and inclusive conception of museums, taking into account their dual role: as custodians of public knowledge and spaces for education and development. © 2020, Jagiellonian University Press.

Related to COVID-19, this paper focuses on public initiatives representing strategic-oriented crisis management while showing that such initiatives may not help those needing support. More precisely, the paper discusses and exemplifies the conflict of logics between private sector interests and public initiatives related to crisis management in tourism. Design/methodology/approach: The main data source is a structured newspaper review of COVID-19 and tourism as covered in the Swedish press, comprising more than 4,000 items. Findings: Findings indicate logics manifested at different levels and a logic gap between small and large firms. Large firms are potentially better able to adapt but tend to wait passively for financial support rather than reformulate their business operations. Originality/value: The paper contributes to research on crisis management in tourism by taking a public, societal-level view of crisis management juxtaposed against the local actors' sphere of operations. The conflict of logics proves how support needs to be improved to better help a sector in crisis. Thematic logics are introduced as a concept and captured in the conflicts between the present and the future, survival and change and operations and aggregates in crisis management.

Although it mostly affects adults, children of all ages, including neonates, can become ill with Covid-19, as well. The real prevalence rate of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in children is unknown. However, the severity of symptoms in children and neonates is less than in adults. Regarding the new presentation of this disease, the current study has reported a case series of COVID-19 in neonates. Case Presentation: In this article, 10 neonates with COVID- 19 admitted to our neonatal intensive care units are reported. All reported neonates had general suspicious symptoms of COVID- 19 with positive results for SARS-CoV-2 assessed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from the nasopharynx area or nose of the patients. All neonates, except for two of them, were term neonates. One case had open-heart surgery for congenital heart disease (transposition of the great arteries (TGA)). The mean patients age was 7.8 days on admission. The most frequent symptom was fever. Severe respiratory symptoms were reported in two cases. Also, abnormal radiologic findings in the chest x-ray were detected in two cases. Regarding the lack of significant respiratory symptoms in most of the patients, the lung computed tomography (CT) scan was taken just from one neonate. Leukopenia (WBC &lt; 5000/mm(3)) was detected in one case, with no lymphopenia in all neonates. The positive C-reactive protein test was not found in all cases. No patient was treated by special anti-viral agents for COVID-19, and usual antibiotic treatment for neonatal sepsis was administered for all cases. All patients, except for one, survived with no significant sequela of the disease. Conclusions: This study demonstrated that clinical manifestations, as well as laboratory and radiologic findings of COVID-19, are milder in neonates than in the older ages. Hence, it can be argued that the prognosis of COVID-19 in the neonatal period is generally good.","Tabatabaei, S. R.; Fallahi, M.; Boskabadi, A.; Taleghani, N.

The study has shown that Ukraine's involvement in European integration processes has questioned the economic performance of the domestic economy sector, the wealth of Ukrainian citizens, infrastructure upgrade and industrial re-equipment. The Agreement on Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area with the EU countries, signed and implemented by Ukraine, has not had a critical impact on the improvement of Ukraine's leading macroeconomic indicators. Thus, the GDP recovery, investment and infrastructure renewal rate was very low, with depressed and unstable social and economic projects in 2014 - 2019;in general, this prevented from moving toward the EU standards. It is also noted that with the growth of EU's GDP by USD 1, the foreign trade turnover of all goods will increase by USD 0.887, and bilateral turnover of agricultural and industrial goods - by USD 1.693 dollars;Ukraine's GDP growth has a much smaller impact, which can be explained by the difference in the EU and Ukrainian economic scales. Based on modelling study, forecasting and analysis of time series within the last five-six years, it is proved that without regular investments, supporting measures to trigger the development of high-tech sectors of Ukraine's economy and without its production and logistics partnership and involvement in the global most powerful economic centres, the domestic social and economic segments will continue to worsen and be exposed to the globalized economic risks. Therefore, it is proposed to develop new approaches to the European integration process based on pragmatism and successful experience of Central and Eastern European countries, namely to implement the relevant measures and a strategic level program in Ukraine to propel and develop high-tech and high-margin industrial sector. This requires triggering of state policy on strong involvement of co-financing of structural funds, as well as EU's framework and targeted programs;attracting investment, reducing the influence of oligarchic clans and corruption on the social and economic system of Ukraine. In addition, it is urgent to launch a strategic level program in Ukraine to develop a policy with priority initial stage focusing the key resources on the development of IT sector, which can a priori be integrated and rapidly developed in course of implementation of EU's current industrial innovation strategy.","Redziuk, Yevhenii",International Economic Policy,293,1

Translation of these alternative ORFs was dependent on RNase L’s cleavage activity, suggesting that mRNA decay fragments are translated to produce short peptides that may be important for antiviral activity.","Karasik, Agnes; Jones, Grant D.; DePass, Andrew V.; Guydosh, Nicholas R.",bioRxiv,293,1

Clinical trials demonstrate high efficacy of mRNA based SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in older adults but concerns about virus variant escape have not been well addressed. We have conducted an in-depth analysis of humoral and cellular immunity against an early-pandemic viral isolate and compared that to the P.1. (Gamma) and B.1.617.2 (Delta) variants, as well to a B.1.595 SARS-CoV-2 isolate bearing Spike mutation E484Q, in <55 and >65 age cohorts of mRNA vaccine recipients. As reported, robust immunity required the second dose of vaccine. Older vaccine recipients exhibited an expected 3-5x reduction (but not a complete loss) in neutralizing antibody titers against both P.1. (Gamma) and the B.1.595 virus at the peak of the boosted response. However, older vaccinees manifest robust cellular immunity against early-pandemic SARS-CoV-2 and more recent variants, which remained statistically comparable to the adult group. While the duration of these immune responses remains to be determined over longer periods of time, these results provide reasons for optimism regarding vaccine protection of older adults against SARS-CoV-2 variants and inform thinking about boost vaccination with variant vaccines. eTOC summary Vaccine responses are often diminished with aging, but we found strong responses to SARS-CoV-2 in older adults following mRNA vaccination.

The main findings show that labour actions, especially plans for temporary employment regulations, innovation and differentiation strategies, reorientation to closer markets and obtaining information from official sources as a guarantee of their certainty, are the measures that have a greater impact on the possibilities of recovering hotel activity. In addition, government measures that contribute to the improvement of the financial situation of firms can also play a relevant role in hotel recovery.","Hidalgo, Alberto Martin-Barroso David Nunez-Serrano Juan A.; Turrion, Jaime Velazquez Francisco J.",Tourism Management,293,26

No study to date has reported upon risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection among people who inject drugs or sex workers. Methods and Findings: Between October, 2020 and June, 2021, participants aged [≥]18 years from San Diego, California, USA and Tijuana, Baja California, Mexico who injected drugs within the last month underwent interviews and testing for SARS-CoV-2 RNA and antibodies. Binomial regressions identified correlates of SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity. Of 386 participants, SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence was 36.3% (95% CI: 31.5%-41.1%); 92.1% had detectable IgM antibodies. Only 37.5% had previously been tested. Seroprevalence did not differ by country of residence. None tested RNA-positive. Most (89.5%) reported engaging in [≥]1 protective behavior [e.g., facemasks (73.5%), social distancing (46.5%), or increasing handwashing/sanitizers (22.8%)]. In a multivariate model controlling for sex, older age, and Hispanic/Latinx/Mexican ethnicity were independently associated with SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity, as was engaging in sex work (AdjRR: 1.63; 95% CI: 1.18-2.27) and having been incarcerated in the past six months (AdjRR: 1.49; 95% CI: 0.97-2.27). Presence of comorbidities and substance using behaviors were not associated with SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity. Conclusions: This is the first study to show that sex work and incarceration were independently associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Despite engaging in protective measures, over one-third had evidence of infection, reinforcing the need for a coordinated binational response. Risk mitigation and vaccination is especially needed among older and Hispanic people who inject drugs and those with less agency to protect themselves, such as those who are sex workers or incarcerated.","Strathdee, S.

Many migratory fish populations are declining, threatened by human-induced pressures such as habitat loss and fragmentation caused by dams, roads, land use change, climate change and pollution. However, public awareness of fish migration and associated human pressures remains limited. 2. It is important to communicate about hard-to-see and complex environmental topics and issues, such as fish migration, with young people, who stand to be the most affected by ongoing global changes. Young people are also at a critical stage in their attitude formation and may be particularly receptive to learning enrichment and engagement for behaviour change about environmental issues. 3. Arts-based methods can be particularly effective in fostering broad personal connections with nature, especially for complex topics like fish migration. The collaborative and creative processes involved in developing such media often lack critique, which limits learning from previous experiences. 4. In this article, we reflect on the co-creation of the Shout Trout Workout (STW), a lyric poem, comic and music video for 8- to 14-year-olds, designed to entertain, engage and enrich learning about migratory fishes and aquatic environments. We chart the process of creation, including conception of ideas, writing the poem, fact-checking and developing the storyline with scientists and creating a comic and music video with visual artists and musicians. 5. We explore some of the challenges and merits of collaborative working, consider the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the creative and initial engagement process and share what we learned about creative input, communication and respect. We also discuss how the experience shaped our thoughts about the nature of co-creation itself, and how in creating STW, collaborators contributed to the process in multiple, nuanced and unanticipated ways (e.g. artistic input, ideas, science, dissemination), representing a spectrum of co-creative practice. 6. We hope that sharing our experiences and reflections is useful and inspiring for other cross-disciplinary collaborations, and for those who aim to create learning enrichment and engagement material about ecological processes and environmental issues for young people.","Thomas, M.

Forty of the 161 calves were submitted alive and cryptosporidiosis was diagnosed in 63% (25 of 40) of them. The cryptosporidia infected calves were usually one to two weeks old and came from 26 herds where the typical history was profuse, watery diarrhea in nearly all neonatal calves. The diarrhea usually started around one week of age, was unresponsive to all conventional antidiarrhea therapies, lasted for two or more weeks and was usually fatal. Twenty-nine (69%) of the cryptosporidia infected calves were submitted between December and February. These calves were often hutch reared.Histopatholoical examination revealed large numbers of the coccidial parasite Cryptosporidium sp embedded in the microvilli of jejunal and ileal absorptive enterocytes of all affected calves. The organisms were identified as trophozoites and schizonts (asexual stages) and macrogametes (female sexual stages) with the electron microscope. Microgametes (male sexual stages) were not identified. Occasionally a merozoite (asexual stage) was also seen apparently burrowing into or about to be enveloped by a host microvillus. Observation of the organisms was much easier when diarrheic calves were submitted alive. Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli were often cultured from intestines of dead calves and occasionally from calves submitted alive. Coronavirus particles were seen in one calf. In the last year of this study, oocysts were identified in fecal smears stained with May-Grünwald-Giemsa stain and fecal samples using a dichromate solution flotation technique.","Sanford, S E; Josephson, G K",The Canadian veterinary journal = La revue veterinaire canadienne,293,1

To date, however, the characterization of similar interactions with the genomes of members of the family Caliciviridae has been limited to in vitro binding analysis. In this study, Feline calicivirus (FCV) has been used as a model system to identify and characterize the role of host-cell factors that interact with the viral RNA. It was demonstrated that polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (PTB) interacts specifically with the 5' sequences of the FCV genomic and subgenomic RNAs. Using RNA interference it was shown that PTB is required for efficient FCV replication in a temperature-dependent manner. siRNA-mediated knockdown of PTB resulted in a 15- to 100-fold reduction in virus titre, as well as a concomitant reduction in viral RNA and protein synthesis at 32 degrees C. In addition, virus-induced cytopathic effect was significantly delayed as a result of an siRNA-mediated reduction in PTB levels. A role for PTB in the calicivirus life cycle was more apparent at temperatures above and below 37 degrees C, fitting with the hypothesis that PTB functions as an RNA chaperone, potentially aiding the folding of RNA into functional structures. This is the first functional demonstration of a host-cell protein interacting with a calicivirus RNA.","Karakasiliotis, Ioannis; Chaudhry, Yasmin; Roberts, Lisa O; Goodfellow, Ian G",The Journal of general virology,293,9

We discovered that an oligonucleotide, No. 10, was localized at the 5'-end of every mRNA, and was not colinear with the sequences of the virion genomic RNA. This result indicates that all of the mRNAs contain a leader sequence which is joined to the body sequences of the mRNAs. We have also studied the structure of the replicative intermediate (RI) RNA in the MHV-infected cells. This RI RNA consists of a single species corresponding to the MHV genomic RNA. No subgenomic RI structures were detected. Furthermore, the nascent RNA chains in the RI structure contained the leader sequences, suggesting that the leader RNA was not added to the mRNA post- transcriptionally , but rather, it was probably synthesized independently and then used as a primer for the synthesis of mRNAs. We have also shown that the poly (A) sequences in the MHV genome were transcribed from the poly (U) sequences present in the negative-strand template. The RNA polymerases involved in the MHV RNA synthesis were also characterized. The early polymerase synthesizes a single negative-stranded, full-length RNA. The late polymerases could be separated into two activities, one synthesizing positive-stranded genomic RNA, and the other synthesizing genomic as well as subgenomic RNAs. Thus, the replication and transcription functions of MHV could probably be separated. A plausible model of MHV replication is presented.","Lai, M M; Baric, R S; Brayton, P R; Stohlman, S A",Advances in experimental medicine and biology,293,9

These additional patients may lead to the risk of viral transmission to other patients and medical teams. To contain the spread of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), the Israeli Ministry of Health initiated a plan spearheaded by Magen David Adom (MDA), Israel's national emergency medical services (EMS) organization. OBJECTIVES To describe outbreak containment actions initiated by MDA, including a COVID-19 tele-triage center and home testing by paramedics. METHODS Retrospective analysis was conducted of de-identified data from the call management and command and control systems during the first period of the COVID-19 outbreak in Israel (23 February 2020-15 March 2020). RESULTS During the study period, the total number of calls to the dispatch centers was 477,321 with a daily average of 21,696, compared to 6000-6500 during routine times. The total number of COVID-19 related calls was 334,230 (daily average 15,194). There were 28,454 calls (8.51% of all COVID-19 related calls, average 1293/day) transferred to the COVID-19 call center. Of the COVID-19 call center inquiries, 8390 resulted in the dispatch of a dedicated vehicle, including a paramedic wearing personal protective equipment, to collect samples for testing (daily average 381). CONCLUSIONS Maximizing EMS during a pandemic using phone triage, in addition to dispatching paramedics to perform home testing, may significantly distance infected patients from the public and health care system. These steps can further minimize the spread of disease.","Jaffe, Eli; Sonkin, Roman; Alpert, Evan Avraham; Magid, Avi; Knobler, Haim Y",The Israel Medical Association journal : IMAJ,293,19

The GP2 subunit possesses a coiled-coil motif, which plays an important role in the oligomerization and fusion activity of other viral GPs. To determine the functional significance of the coiled-coil motif of GP2, we examined the effects of peptides corresponding to the coiled-coil motif of GP2 on the infectivity of a mutant vesicular stomatitis virus (lacking the receptor-binding/fusion protein) pseudotyped with the Ebola virus GP. A peptide corresponding to the C-terminal helix reduced the infectivity of the pseudotyped virus. We next introduced alanine substitutions into hydrophobic residues in the coiled-coil motif to identify residues important for GP function. None of the substitutions affected GP oligomerization, but some mutations, two in the N-terminal helix and all in the C-terminal helix, reduced the ability of GP to confer infectivity to the mutant vesicular stomatitis virus without affecting the transport of GP to the cell surface, its incorporation into virions, and the production of virus particles. These results indicate that the coiled-coil motif of GP2 plays an important role in facilitating the entry of Ebola virus into host cells and that peptides corresponding to this region could act as efficient antiviral agents.","Watanabe, S; Takada, A; Watanabe, T; Ito, H; Kida, H; Kawaoka, Y",Journal of virology,293,24

Here we show that an additional membrane-proximal cleavage occurs and modulates F protein function. We initially observed that the ectodomain of approximately one in three measles virus (MV) F proteins is cleaved proximal to the membrane. Processing occurs after cleavage activation of the precursor F(0) into the F(1) and F(2) subunits, producing F(1a) and F(1b) fragments that are incorporated in viral particles. We also detected the F(1b) fragment, including the transmembrane domain and cytoplasmic tail, in cells expressing the canine distemper virus (CDV) or mumps virus F protein. Six membrane-proximal amino acids are necessary for efficient CDV F(1a/b) cleavage. These six amino acids can be exchanged with the corresponding MV F protein residues of different sequence without compromising function. Thus, structural elements of different sequence are functionally exchangeable. Finally, we showed that the alteration of a block of membrane-proximal amino acids results in diminished fusion activity in the context of a recombinant CDV. We envisage that selective loss of the membrane anchor in the external subunits of circularly arranged F protein trimers may disengage them from pulling the membrane centrifugally, thereby facilitating fusion pore formation.","von Messling, Veronika; Milosevic, Dragana; Devaux, Patricia; Cattaneo, Roberto",Journal of virology,293,10

The sensitivity analysis revealed that this new score performed better than the sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score at the first day of admission. The receiver characteristic curve analysis revealed that this score predicted severe cases of COVID-19 infection at 0.831 (95% confidence interval: 0.783-0.879) and 0.798 (95% confidence interval: 0.727-0.869) of the area under the curve in the derivation and validation group. The proposed risk score system is a fairly reliable and robust tool for evaluating the severity and prognosis of patients with COVID-19. This may help to early identify severe patients with poor prognosis, who may require more intense interventions.","Ma, Ke; Xia, Yan; Hu, Boqi; Zhang, Yingli; Xu, Xiaoming; Zhang, Nan; Xu, Hong",Jpn. j. infect. dis,293,24

Specifically, in this essay, a focus is placed on how one school preserved their collaborative culture among administrators, teachers and staff. The purpose of this paper is to provide guidance to school leadership during this public health crisis. Design/methodology/approach: To ensure trustworthiness in this naturalistic inquiry, a triangulation was made of contributing authors’ perspectives to present theory-informed insights. Findings: This school’s transition to online education was guided by a shared goal to not only move content online but also a rich participatory culture among staff. Critical forms of participation and community practices are presented that were pivotal in supporting teachers through the transition. Insights equip school leaders and administrators potentially remaining online, at least in part, through the next school year. Practical implications: Schools undergoing the shift to teaching online should attend to cultural shifts and create conditions in which staff members can collaborate at higher levels.

Typical clinical testing only confirms the presence or absence of the virus, but rather, a simple and rapid testing procedure that sequences the entire genome would be impactful and allow for tracing the spread of the virus and variants, as well as the appearance of new variants. However, traditional short read sequencing methods are time consuming and expensive. Herein, we describe a tiled genome array that we developed for rapid and inexpensive full viral genome resequencing, and we have applied our SARS-CoV-2-specific genome tiling array to rapidly and accurately resequence the viral genome from eight clinical samples. We have resequenced eight samples acquired from patients in Wyoming that tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. We were ultimately able to sequence over 95% of the genome of each sample with greater than 99.9% average accuracy.","Hoff, Kendall; Ding, Xun; Carter, Lucas; Duque, John; Lin, Ju-Yu; Dung, Samantha; Singh, Priyanka; Sun, Jiayi; Crnogorac, Filip; Swaminathan, Radha; Alden, Emily N; Zhu, Xuechen; Shimada, Ryota; Posavi, Marijan; Hull, Noah; Dinwiddie, Darrell; Halasz, Adam M; McGall, Glenn; Zhou, Wei; Edwards, Jeremy S",Langmuir,293,25

Flux balance analysis is an efficient method to analyze metabolic networks. It allows optimizing for a metabolic function and thus e.g., predicting the growth rate of a specific cell or the production rate of a metabolite of interest. Here flux balance analysis was applied on human lung cells infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) to reposition metabolic drugs and drug combinations against the replication of the SARS-CoV-2 virus within the host tissue. Making use of expression data sets of infected lung tissue, genome-scale COVID-19-specific metabolic models were reconstructed. Then host-specific essential genes and gene-pairs were determined through in-silico knockouts that permit reducing the viral biomass production without affecting the host biomass. Key pathways that are associated with COVID-19 severity in lung tissue are related to oxidative stress, as well as ferroptosis, sphingolipid metabolism, cysteine metabolism, and fat digestion. By in-silico screening of FDA approved drugs on the putative disease-specific essential genes and gene-pairs, 45 drugs and 99 drug combinations were predicted as promising candidates for COVID-19 focused drug repositioning (https://github.com/sysbiolux/DCcov). Among the 45 drug candidates, six antiviral drugs were found and seven drugs that are being tested in clinical trials against COVID-19. Other drugs like gemcitabine, rosuvastatin and acetylcysteine, and drug combinations like azathioprine-pemetrexed might offer new chances for treating COVID-19.","Kishk, Ali; Pacheco, Maria Pires; Sauter, Thomas",,293,21

Present Findings: COVID-19 vaccine development efforts started in early January 2020 when Chinese scientists shared the Coronavirus genomic sequence in public domain. Approximately 321 research groups initiated the search for a vaccine, out of which 41 have reached phase I/II trails and 11 reached phase-III clinical trials, including approved vaccines for early to limited use. Out of these projects are two labs in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia still in early stages of development of a COVID-19 vaccine. Several vaccine attempts are being tested from traditional, attenuated virus methods, to new nucleic acid-based designs. However, no vaccine has yet completed clinical trials and reached public domain.In spite of the challenges faced during previous vaccine trials, researchers have found that Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of COVID-19 is structurally similar to the (SARS-CoV-1) and the Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), which caused epidemics in 2003 and 2012 respectively. Both SARS strains show identical affinity towards the type-II alveolar pneumocytes angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) receptor binding domains and therefore, similar pathogenicity. The race to develop the vaccine is predominantly for individuals at high risk of developing the infection, i.e. population groups who are most susceptible to experiencing fatal symptoms of the coronavirus. These include patients with comorbidities, above the age of 60 years and people at risk of contracting large viral loads, such as healthcare providers caring for critical admissions in in-patient wards, Intensive Care Units and Emergency Room settings. Summary: Many different vaccine strategies are under development throughout different stages of the research timeline; however, it is estimated that none will show favorable results before end of 2020. For any immunization or interventional prevention/therapy system to reach the public and patients at high risk, it needs to undergo multiple phase trials to ensure safety and effectiveness. In this scoping review we aim to map the literature on COVID-19 vaccines and provide recommendations related to gaps in research, applicability and expected challenges for implementation of nationwide vaccination in Saudi Arabia.","TofailAhmed Raja, AlAnoud; Alshamsan, Aws; Al-Jedai, Ahmed",Saudi pharmaceutical journal,293,26

Four hundred and forty-seven responses were received between 22nd May and 15th June 2020. Hospitals and care homes were recognized as the settings with the greatest unmet clinical need for COVID-19 diagnostics, despite reporting more access to laboratory molecular testing than other settings. Hospital staff identified a need for diagnostic tests for symptomatic workers and patients. In contrast, care home staff expressed an urgency for screening at the front door to protect high-risk residents and limit transmission. The length of time to test result was considered a widespread problem with current testing across all settings.

This so-called reproduction number has significant implications for the disease progression. There has been increasing literature suggesting that superspreading, the significant variability in number of new infections caused by individuals, plays an important role in the spread of SARS-CoV-2. In this paper, we consider the effect that such superspreading has on the estimation of the reproduction number and subsequent estimates of future cases. Accordingly, we employ a simple extension to models currently used in the literature to estimate the reproduction number and present a case-study of the progression of COVID-19 in Austria. Our models demonstrate that the estimation uncertainty of the reproduction number increases with superspreading and that this improves the performance of prediction intervals. Of independent interest is the derivation of a transparent formula that connects the extent of superspreading to the width of credible intervals for the reproduction number. This serves as a valuable heuristic for understanding the uncertainty surrounding diseases with superspreading.","Johnson, Kory D; Beiglböck, Mathias; Eder, Manuel; Grass, Annemarie; Hermisson, Joachim; Pammer, Gudmund; Polechová, Jitka; Toneian, Daniel; Wölfl, Benjamin",,293,30

In particular, domain adaptation consists for a specific task, in reusing training data developedfor the same task but a distinct domain. This is particularly relevant to the applications of deep learning in Natural Language Processing, because they usually require large annotated corpora that may not exist for the targeted domain, but exist for side domains. RESULTS: In this paper, we experiment with transfer learning for the task of relation extraction from biomedical texts, using the TreeLSTM model. We empirically show the impact of TreeLSTM alone and with domain adaptation by obtaining better performances than the state of the art on two biomedical relation extraction tasks and equal performances for two others, for which little annotated data are available. Furthermore, we propose an analysis of the role that syntactic features may play in transfer learning for relation extraction. CONCLUSION: Given the difficulty to manually annotate corpora in the biomedical domain, the proposed transfer learning method offers a promising alternative to achieve good relation extraction performances for domains associated with scarce resources. Also, our analysis illustrates the importance that syntax plays in transfer learning, underlying the importance in this domain to privilege approaches that embed syntactic features.","Legrand, Joël; Toussaint, Yannick; Raïssi, Chedy; Coulet, Adrien",J Biomed Semantics,293,15

For mental health, heightened stress responses to the pandemic, is likely to manifest in three ways: 1) development of a new episode of a disorder in those with a predisposition to a major psychiatric disorder or an acute exacerbation in those who already have such a disorder, 2) development of a trauma or stressor related disorder, such as acute stress disorder, Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), or adjustment disorders, and 3) development of a symptomatic stress response that does not meet the diagnostic criteria of a psychiatric disorder. The authors reviewed existing literature on past epidemics, natural disasters, and COVID-19 with a focus on psychiatry and mental health. Psychological effects of past epidemics (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoV-1, Ebola, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, the Anthrax threat), past natural disasters, and current COVID-19 data suggest numerous psychological effects following the pandemic. Alcohol use, PTSD, anxiety, anger, fear of contagion, perceived risk, uncertainty, and distrust are a few of the immediate and long-term effects that are likely to result from the COVID-19 pandemic. Identifying people in need of mental health care and determining the appropriate psychiatric services and therapy needed will be important.

Unlimited proliferation of NK-92 cells provides a consistent supply of cells for the administration and development of NK cell immunotherapy. However, the clinical efficacy of NK-92 cells has not reached its full potential due to reduced immune functions as compared to primary NK cells. Improvements of NK-92 functions currently rely on conventional transgene delivery by mRNA, plasmid and viral vector with limited efficiencies. To enable precise genetic modifications, we have established a robust CRISPR genome engineering platform for NK-92 based on the nucleofection of Cas9 ribonucleoprotein. To demonstrate the versatility of the platform, we have performed cell-based screening of Cas9 guide RNA, multiplex gene knockout of activating and inhibitory receptors, knock-in of a fluorescent gene, and promoter insertion to reactivate endogenous CD16 and DNAM-1. The CRISPR-engineered NK-92 demonstrated markedly enhanced cytotoxicity and could mediate antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity against hard to kill cancer cell lines. Our genome editing platform is straightforward and robust for both functional studies and therapeutic engineering of NK-92 cells.","Huang, Rih-Sheng; Shih, Hsin-An; Lai, Min-Chi; Chang, Yao-Jen; Lin, Steven",Front Immunol,293,1

An online survey among 397 children/adolescents and their parents across 63 municipalities in Greece was conducted in April-May 2020. Parents self-reported changes of their children's lifestyle habits and body weight, as well as sociodemographic data of their family. The present study shows that during the lockdown, children's/adolescents' sleep duration and screen time increased, while their physical activity decreased. Their consumption of fruits and fresh fruit juices, vegetables, dairy products, pasta, sweets, total snacks, and breakfast increased, while fast-food consumption decreased. Body weight increased in 35% of children/adolescents. A multiple regression analysis showed that the body weight increase was associated with increased consumption of breakfast, salty snacks, and total snacks and with decreased physical activity.

This article will provide a review of these tasks during the pandemic on the basis of interviews with KJGD administrations in 11 communities of the federal state North Rhine-Westphalia in October 2020.Typically, the KJGD is deeply involved in infection prevention in daycare facilities and schools by providing contact tracing, swab collection, guidance, crisis committee participation, quarantine survey, and data capture. The classic tasks had to be entirely discontinued in some areas, or at least strongly limited. The affected areas include occupational medicine, medical reports, school entry examinations for children, assessment of special education needs, health reporting, cooperation with child protection and early intervention, outbreak management for other infectious diseases, and the closing of immunization gaps.The consequences of discontinuing the original tasks, e.g., missing school entry examinations, cannot be predicted; resumption of these activities is essential. On behalf of municipal services of general interest in the sense of public health (in all policies), the KJGD makes a remarkable contribution to ensuring that children and youths not only stay physically healthy and far from infections but are also promoted in their individual development and participation.","Horacek, Ulrike; Auer, Isabel; Thaiss, Heidrun",Bundesgesundheitsblatt Gesundheitsforschung Gesundheitsschutz,293,1

By July 20, 2020, there were 2,118,646 confirmed cases and 80,120 confirmed deaths. To assist with the development of preventive measures and targeted interventions to combat the pandemic in Brazil, we present a geographic study to detect ""active"" and ""emerging"" space-time clusters of COVID-19. We document the relationship between relative risk of COVID-19 and mortality, inequality, socioeconomic vulnerability variables. We used the prospective space-time scan statistic to detect daily COVID-19 clusters and examine the relative risk between February 25-June 7, 2020, and February 25-July 20, 2020, in 5570 Brazilian municipalities. We apply a Generalized Linear Model (GLM) to assess whether mortality rate, GINI index, and social inequality are predictors for the relative risk of each cluster. We detected 7 ""active"" clusters in the first time period, being one in the north, two in the northeast, two in the southeast, one in the south, and one in the capital of Brazil. In the second period, we found 9 clusters with RR > 1 located in all Brazilian regions. The results obtained through the GLM showed that there is a significant positive correlation between the predictor variables in relation to the relative risk of COVID-19. Given the presence of spatial autocorrelation in the GLM residuals, a spatial lag model was conducted that revealed that spatial effects, and both GINI index and mortality rate were strong predictors in the increase in COVID-19 relative risk in Brazil. Our research can be utilized to improve COVID-19 response and planning in all Brazilian states. The results from this study are particularly salient to public health, as they can guide targeted intervention measures, lowering the magnitude and spread of COVID-19. They can also improve resource allocation such as tests and vaccines (when available) by informing key public health officials about the highest risk areas of COVID-19.","Martines, M R; Ferreira, R V; Toppa, R H; Assunção, L M; Desjardins, M R; Delmelle, E M",J Geogr Syst,293,18

METHODS: All 32 pregnant women with COVID-19 who were admitted to the hospital in Wuhan during the outbreak from January 20 to March 18, 2020, were retrospectively reviewed for the clinical records, laboratory tests, chest CT scans, and neonatal outcomes. RESULTS: There were 17 of the 32 patients (53%) with no subjective symptoms before admission, and 13 (41%) remained asymptomatic throughout hospitalization. There were 28 patients (88%) showing typical radiographic evidence of pneumonia on chest CT. The patients with COVID-19 were found in an increased risk of thromboembolism with much higher D-dimer levels than uninfected pregnant women. One neonate with asphyxia and positive immunoglobulin M (IgM) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies was reported. CONCLUSIONS: The considerable asymptomatic proportion of pregnant women with COVID-19 indicates symptom-based screening would miss a number of cases. Chest CT could provide a useful screening resource during the COVID-19epidemic outbreak. Anticoagulation therapy for the postpartum patients may be helpful for good prognosis.

In recent years, the rapid development and expansion of low-cost air quality sensors by companies such as PurpleAir has enabled an understanding of air pollution at a much higher spatiotemporal resolution compared to traditional monitoring networks. In this study, real-time PM2.5 measurements from 751 PurpleAir sensors operating from June to July in 2019 and 2020 were used to examine the impact of 4th of July fireworks on hourly and daily PM2.5 concentrations at the census tract and county levels in California. American Community Survey (ACS) and CalEnviroScreen 3.0 data were used to identify correlations between PM2.5 measurements and socioeconomic status (SES). A two-step method was implemented to assure the quality of raw PM2.5 sensor data and sensor calibration against co-located reference instruments. The results showed that over 67% and 81% of counties experienced immediate impacts related to fireworks in 2019 and 2020, respectively. Relative to 2019, the peak PM2.5 concentrations on July 4th and 5th 2020 were, on average, over 50% higher in California, likely due to the COVID-19-related increase in the use of household-level fireworks. This increase was most pronounced in southern counties, which tend to have less strict firework-related regulations and a greater use of illegal fireworks. Los Angeles County experienced the highest July 4th daily PM2.5 levels both in 2019 (29.9 µg·m-3) and 2020 (42.6 µg·m-3). Spatial hot spot analyses generally showed these southern counties (e.g., Los Angeles County) to be regional air pollution hotspots, whereas the opposite pattern was seen in the north (e.g., San Francisco). The results also showed PM2.5 peaks that were over two-times higher among communities with lower SES, higher minority group populations, and higher asthma rates. Our findings highlight the important role that policy and enforcement can play in reducing firework-related air pollution and protecting public health, as exemplified by southern California, where policy was more relaxed and air pollution was higher (especially in 2020 when the 4th of July coincided with the COVID-19-lockdown period), and in disadvantaged communities where disparities were greatest.","Mousavi, Amirhosein; Yuan, Yiting; Masri, Shahir; Barta, Greg; Wu, Jun",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),293,1

Existing prognostic models mostly consider the impact of biomarkers at presentation on the risk of a single patient outcome at a single follow up time. We collected data for 553 Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)-positive COVID-19 patients admitted to hospital whose eventual outcomes were known. The data collected for the patients included demographics, comorbidities and laboratory values taken at admission and throughout the course of hospitalization. We trained multivariate Markov prognostic models to identify high-risk patients at admission along with a dynamic measure of risk incorporating time-dependent changes in patients' laboratory values. From the set of factors available upon admission, the Markov model determined that age >80 years, history of coronary artery disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease increased mortality risk. The lab values upon admission most associated with mortality included neutrophil percentage, red blood cells (RBC), red cell distribution width (RDW), protein levels, platelets count, albumin levels and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC).

The aim of our study was to evaluate whether a recently dynamic nomogram, established in the Chinese population and based on age, lymphocyte percentage and monocyte absolute count, might apply to a different context. We collected data from 299 patients (243 with COVID-19 and 56 with FLU) at Policlinico Umberto I, Sapienza University of Rome. The nomogram included age, lymphocyte percentage and monocyte absolute count to differentiate COVID-19 from FLU. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated for all associations. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to adjust for potential confounding. A p-value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Patients with COVID-19 had higher age, lymphocyte percentage and monocyte absolute count than patients with FLU. Although univariate analysis confirmed that age, lymphocyte percentage and monocyte absolute count were associated with COVID-19, only at multivariate analysis was monocyte count statistically significant as a predictive factor of COVID-19. Using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, we found that a monocyte count >0.35x1000/mL showed an AUC of 0.680 (sensitivity 0.992, specificity 0.368). A dynamic nomogram including age, lymphocyte percentage and monocyte absolute count cannot be applied to our context, probably due to differences in demographic characteristics between Italian and Chinese populations. However, our data showed that monocyte absolute count is highly predictive of COVID-19, suggesting its potential role above all in settings where prompt PCR nasopharyngeal testing is lacking.","Curtolo, Ambrogio; Oliva, Alessandra; Volpicelli, Lorenzo; Ceccarelli, Giancarlo; D039,; Ettorre, Gabriella; Borrazzo, Cristian; Mastroianni, Claudio Maria; Venditti, Mario",Infez Med,293,1

In this work, we first study the mechanism, frequency, and ratio of mutations on the spike (S) protein, which is the common target of most COVID-19 vaccines and antibody therapies. Additionally, we build a library of antibody structures and analyze their 2D and 3D characteristics. Moreover, we predict the mutation-induced binding free energy (BFE) changes for the complexes of S protein and antibodies or ACE2. By integrating genetics, biophysics, deep learning, and algebraic topology, we deduce that some of the mutations such as M153I, S254F, and S255F may weaken the binding of S protein and antibodies, and potentially disrupt the efficacy and reliability of antibody therapies and vaccines in the development.

AREAS COVERED: We reviewed literature data on the most widely used Hib vaccines and vaccination strategies which led to the global prevention and control of Hib disease and aim to highlight important factors for continued disease control and elimination in the future. EXPERT COMMENTARY: More than 90% of countries worldwide have implemented Hib-conjugate vaccination in their national immunization programs. Vaccines containing Hib polyribosylribitol phosphate (PRP) conjugated with tetanus toxoid (Hib-TT) are the most commonly used. Neisseria meningitidis outer membrane protein complex of PRP (Hib-OMP) is also used. Although the kinetics of the immune response varies with Hib vaccine and schedule used, high control of Hib disease was observed in all settings/scenarios. Further improving global Hib vaccination coverage may result in disease elimination.","Slack, Mary; Esposito, Susanna; Haas, Hervé; Mihalyi, Attila; Nissen, Michael; Mukherjee, Piyali; Harrington, Lauriane",,293,24

METHODS: Fity-five COVID-19 patients were admitted to the Fifth People's Hospital of Wuxi from January 23rd to March 31st, 2020 as the research object. The demographic characteristics of the cases and the methods of immunotherapy were analyzed, focusing on the immunized indicators, positivity of pathogens and clinical indicators of critically ill COVID-19 patient, and the effects of immunotherapy and stem cell transplantation were evaluated. RESULTS: Aged, male and people with comorbidities were the main risk factors in the development of severe and critical COVID-19. All of confirmed COVID-19 cases (n = 55) had been treated with interferon-&#945; (IFN-&#945;), of which 81.8% (n = 45, mild and ordinary) of the patients were recovered, 14.6% (n = 8) of the patients were converted to severe, 3.6% (n = 2) of the patients were converted to critical, and some severe patients were treated with gamma globulin and albumin as adjuvant treatment. Critically ill patients were not only treated with IFN-&#945;, gamma globulin and albumin, but also treated with convalescent plasma and MSC transplantation. Due to pulmonary hemorrhage and persistently low blood oxygen saturation, terminal lung transplantation therapy was implemented. The total number of lymphocytes, CD4+, CD8+ T lymphocytes, natural killer (NK) cells and B cells in peripheral blood of the two critical COVID-19 patients were significantly reduced, and the functions of lung, liver, and kidney were severely damaged on admission, manifested as significant increase of the levels of blood C-reactive protein (CRP), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and blood urea nitrogen (BUN), etc. and decrease of blood oxygen saturation, and type I respiratory failure, and the noninvasive assisted ventilation was needed to improve. After adjuvant immunotherapy such as gamma globulin, the nucleic acid of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) turned into negative. The CRP of one critically ill patient was significantly lower than the value at admission (minimum of 21 mg/L). But the lung inflammation progressed rapidly, and the pathological results of the lung tissue from the lung transplantation showed hemorrhage and irreversible fibrosis. The ability to secrete immunoglobulin A (IgA) was significantly reduced. Liver function had been significantly improved and stabilized after treatment with convalescent plasma during the recovery period. MSC transplantation treatment reduced the BUN level by > 50% compared with the previous period, and the total number of lymphocytes in the patient increased by more than 2 times (rose from 0.23×109/L to 0.57×109/L), but the total amount of lymphocytes was still lower than the normal reference value (< 1.1×109/L). The lung inflammation lesions were obviously absorbed, and the vital signs were stable. CONCLUSIONS: In addition to IFN, gamma globulin, antiserum and MSC transplantation therapy can help clear the virus and reduce inflammation. Although MSC transplantation fail to completely change the immunecompromised state of critically ill patients, it controlled the progression of inflammation in the liver and kidneys.","Yan, Yan; Jiang, Xiufeng; Ding, Difei; Huang, Jiehui",Zhonghua Wei Zhong Bing Ji Jiu Yi Xue,293,24

In preclinical studies, activated protein C (APC) provides negative feedback downregulation of excessive inflammation and thrombin generation, attenuates damage caused by ischemia-reperfusion in many organs including lungs, and reduces death caused by bacterial pneumonia. APC exerts both anticoagulant activities and direct cell-signaling activities. Preclinical studies show that its direct cell-signaling actions mediate anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic actions, mortality reduction for pneumonia, and beneficial actions for ischemia-reperfusion injury. The APC mutant 3K3A-APC, which was engineered to have diminished anticoagulant activity while retaining cell-signaling actions, was safe in phase 1 and phase 2 human trials. Because of its broad spectrum of homeostatic effects in preclinical studies, we speculate that 3K3A-APC merits consideration for clinical trial studies in appropriately chosen, seriously ill patients with COVID-19.","Griffin, John H; Lyden, Patrick",Res Pract Thromb Haemost,293,24

We first construct dynamic components for picturing the power system operation as the environment. The transient voltage recovery criteria, which poses time-varying requirements to UVLS, is integrated into the states and reward function to advise the learning of deep neural networks. The proposed approach has no tuning issue of coefficients in reward functions, and this issue was regarded as a deficiency in the existing DRL-based algorithms. Extensive case studies illustrate that the proposed method outperforms the traditional UVLS relay in both the timeliness and efficacy for emergency control.","Zhang, Ying; Yue, Meng; Wang, Jianhui",,293,24

Twenty family physicians working in primary care health centers with a list of over 800 patients will be included, as well as a control group of family physicians with similar characteristics in terms of age, sex, and patient list. A structured training process oriented to the clinical practice of the family physician, primary care clinical ultrasound classroom (AECAP), will be carried out, and the improvement of knowledge and skills of the participants will be evaluated, as well as the improvement of the quality of care based on clinical indicators. DISCUSSION: The family physician is in a privileged situation allows increasing the performance of ultrasound in frequent clinical situations and reducing care hours. We hope that the results obtained in this study demonstrate the effectiveness of the structured training method (AECAP) and support the generalization of ultrasound in primary health care.

Answering this call, this pilot study describes the rapid, full-scale change from a primarily clinic-based Parent-Child Interaction Therapy (PCIT) model to a virtual service model (i.e., I-PCIT) in an academic and community-based program in Miami, Florida. First, we describe the virtual service training model our program developed and its implementation with 17 therapists (MAge = 32.35, 88.2% female, 47.1% Hispanic) to enable our clinic to shift from providing virtual services to a small portion of the families served (29.1%) to all of the families served. Second, we examine the effect of I-PCIT on child and caregiver outcomes during the 2-month stay-at-home period between March 16, 2020, and May 16, 2020, in 86 families (MChildAge = 4.75, 71% Hispanic). Due to the rapid nature of the current study, all active participants were transferred to virtual services, and therefore there was no comparison or control group, and outcomes represent the most recently available scores and not treatment completion. Results reveal that I-PCIT reduced child externalizing and internalizing problems and caregiver stress, and increased parenting skills and child compliance with medium to large effects even in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. Finally, the study examined components of our virtual service training model associated with the greatest improvements in child and caregiver outcomes. Preliminary findings revealed that locally and collaboratively developed strategies (e.g., online communities of practice, training videos and guides) had the strongest association with child and caregiver outcomes. Implications for virtual service delivery, implementation, and practice in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic are discussed.","Garcia, Dainelys; Blizzard, Angela M; Peskin, Abigail; Rothenberg, W Andrew; Schmidt, Ellyn; Piscitello, Jennifer; Espinosa, Natalie; Salem, Hanan; Rodriguez, Gabriela M; Sherman, Jamie A; Parlade, Meaghan V; Landa, Alexis L; Davis, Eileen M; Weinstein, Allison; Garcia, Angela; Perez, Camille; Rivera, Jessica M; Martinez, Chary; Jent, Jason F",Prev Sci,293,20

We have developed a new homemade VHC, made of a paper coffee cup, and a drinking water bottle. This study was conducted to compare the bronchodilator response in children with airway hyperresponsiveness after the use of our homemade VHC and that of a standard commercial one. METHODS: In a randomized, two-period, two-sequence crossover trial, we recruited 20 children, aged 6-15 years, who had a greater than 12% increase in FEV1 after inhaled salbutamol. They were randomized into Group A and B. Group A used our VHC on the first day and Aerochamber® on the second day. Group B used the same VHCs but in alternate sequence. Spirometries were performed before and after 400 µg of salbutamol, MDI was administered via those VHCs. RESULTS: Baseline demographic data and spirometric values did not have statistically significant differences between group A and B and between the first and second day (p > .05). After giving salbutamol MDI, both VHCs produced significant increases in FVC, FEV1 , and FEF25-75% (p < .005). The improvement in FEV1 did not significantly differ between our homemade VHC and Aerochamber® (p > .05). CONCLUSION: Our homemade VHC is effective for an MDI bronchodilator delivery. Since it is very cheap and easy to make, it may be used as a disposable device to minimize airborne transmission especially when commercial VHC is not available.","Chaicoming, Kesanee; Preutthipan, Aroonwan; Adirekkittikun, Anusorn; Nugboon, Malinee",Pediatr. pulmonol,293,1

The 224-Gbit/s line-rate OTPI-PAM-4 signal is successfully transmitted over a 500-m standard single-mode fiber (SSMF) in the C band, using the transmitter with a bandwidth of 25 GHz and the receiver with a single photodiode. By using a 33%-return-to-zero (RZ) pulse train, a bit-error ratio (BER) below 7% hard-decision forward error correction (HD-FEC) threshold is achieved. BER below 20% soft-decision forward error correction (SD-FEC) threshold is also realized using a carrier suppressed return-to-zero (CSRZ) pulse train. The OTPI technique can also be used for more higher-order pulse amplitude modulation (PAM) formats, making it a promising technique for next-generation high-speed optical interconnects.","Zhang, Xiaoling; Fu, Yan; Kong, Deming; Li, Longsheng; Jia, Shi; Wei, Jin; Chen, Chen; Zhang, Chongfu; Qiu, Kun; Hu, Hao",Opt Express,293,20

Management of high-risk patients with early intervention is a key to lower the fatality rate of COVID-19 pneumonia, as a majority of patients recover naturally. Therefore, an accurate prediction of disease progression with baseline imaging at the time of the initial presentation can help in patient management. In lieu of only size and volume information of pulmonary abnormalities and features through deep learning based image segmentation, here we combine radiomics of lung opacities and non-imaging features from demographic data, vital signs, and laboratory findings to predict need for intensive care unit (ICU) admission. To our knowledge, this is the first study that uses holistic information of a patient including both imaging and non-imaging data for outcome prediction. The proposed methods were thoroughly evaluated on datasets separately collected from three hospitals, one in the United States, one in Iran, and another in Italy, with a total 295 patients with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay positive COVID-19 pneumonia. Our experimental results demonstrate that adding non-imaging features can significantly improve the performance of prediction to achieve AUC up to 0.884 and sensitivity as high as 96.1%, which can be valuable to provide clinical decision support in managing COVID-19 patients. Our methods may also be applied to other lung diseases including but not limited to community acquired pneumonia.","Chao, Hanqing; Fang, Xi; Zhang, Jiajin; Homayounieh, Fatemeh; Arru, Chiara D.; Digumarthy, Subba R.; Babaei, Rosa; Mobin, Hadi K.; Mohseni, Iman; Saba, Luca; Carriero, Alessandro; Falaschi, Zeno; Pasche, Alessio; Wang, Ge; Kalra, Mannudeep K.; Yan, Pingkun",,293,20

Recent studies also show a bidirectional link between COVID-19 and mental health in that people with previous history of psychiatric illness have a higher risk for contracting COVID-19 and that COVID-19 patients display a variety of psychiatric illnesses. Risk factors and the response of the central nervous system to the virus show large overlaps with pathophysiological processes associated with Alzheimer's disease, delirium, post-operative cognitive dysfunction and acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, all characterized by cognitive impairment. These similarities lead to the hypothesis that the neurological symptoms could arise from neuroinflammation and immune cell dysfunction both in the periphery as well as in the central nervous system and the assumption that long-term consequences of COVID-19 may lead to cognitive impairment in the well-being of the patient and thus in today's workforce, resulting in large loss of productivity. Therefore, particular attention should be paid to neurological protection during treatment and recovery of COVID-19, while cognitive consequences may require monitoring.","Meier, I. B.; Teixeira, C.

It does so by showing how the outcome of meaning-making struggles had impacts on political legitimacy, public behaviour, and control over the spread of the virus. Ultimately, these impacts contributed to the avoidable deaths of tens of thousands of UK citizens. Dividing the crisis into phases within a secular ritual passage or 'social drama', it shows how each phase was defined by struggles between the government and other actors to code the unfolding events in an appropriate moral way, to cast actors in their proper roles, and to plot them together in a storied fashion under a suitable narrative genre. Taken together, these processes constituted a conflictual effort to define the meaning of what was occurring. The paper also offers more specific contributions to cultural sociology by showing why social performance theory needs to consider the effects of casting non-human actors in social dramas, how metaphor forms a powerful tool of political action through simplifying and shaping complex realities, and how casting can shift responsibility and redefine the meaning of emotionally charged events such as human death.","Morgan, Marcus",Am J Cult Sociol,293,5

METHODS: Patients were grouped into pre-COVID (January 2019-February 2020) (n = 162) and COVID (March 2020-January 2021) (n = 53) cohorts. We looked at patient characteristics, 30-day morbidity, and mortality. Outcomes were also assessed in donors and recipients who underwent surgery after recovery from COVID-19. RESULTS: The average number of transplants reduced from 11.5/month to 4.8/month. Fewer patients with MELD > 20 underwent LDLT in the COVID cohort (41.3% versus 24.5%, P = 0.03). Out of nine patients with a positive pretransplant COVID-19 PCR, there were 2 (22.3%) deaths on the waiting list. Seven patients underwent LT after recovery from COVID-19 with one 30-day mortality due to biliary sepsis. Three donors with positive COVID-19 PCR underwent uneventful donation after testing negative for COVID-19. No significant difference in 30-day survival was observed in the pre-COVID and COVID cohorts (93.2% versus 90.6%) (P = 0.3). Out of two recipients who developed COVID-19 pneumonia within 30 days after LT, there was one mortality. The 1-year survival for the entire cohort with a MELD cutoff of 20 was 90% and 84% (P = 0.2).

We discuss quarantine of residents and the potential harms associated with this. Personal protective equipment supply for care homes during the pandemic has been suboptimal and we suggest that better integration of procurement and supply is required. Advance care planning has been challenged by the pandemic and there is a need to for healthcare staff to provide support to care homes with this. Finally, we discuss measures to implement augmented care in care homes, including treatment with oxygen and subcutaneous fluids, and the frameworks which will be required if these are to be sustainable.

The study aims to learn fundamental changes in COVID-19 patients who underwent embolectomy in terms of clinical characteristics and clot composition. METHODS: In a retrospective cohort study design, we evaluated 21 patients who underwent embolectomy in our clinic between March 12, 2020, and December 31, 2020. Demographics, characteristics, and laboratory values were abstracted and analyzed. Histopathological assessment was held in the pathology department. RESULTS: Of these 21 patients, 11 (52.3%) were SARS-CoV-2 positive and 10 (47.6%) were SARS-CoV-2 negative. There is no statistical difference in terms of anatomic distribution, diagnostic method, length of hospital stay, amputation or mortality levels. Thromboembolic material of COVID-19 patients include significantly less red blood cell (RBC) (21.2-32.6%; P= 0.01), more lymphocyte (14.1-2.6%; P< 0.001), and more leukocyte (27.1-22.1%; P= 0.05).

We aimed to investigate whether treatment with rituximab is associated with severe COVID-19 outcomes in patients with inflammatory rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases. Methods: In this cohort study, we analysed data from the French RMD COVID-19 cohort, which included patients aged 18 years or older with inflammatory rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases and highly suspected or confirmed COVID-19. The primary endpoint was the severity of COVID-19 in patients treated with rituximab (rituximab group) compared with patients who did not receive rituximab (no rituximab group). Severe disease was defined as that requiring admission to an intensive care unit or leading to death. Secondary objectives were to analyse deaths and duration of hospital stay. The inverse probability of treatment weighting propensity score method was used to adjust for potential confounding factors (age, sex, arterial hypertension, diabetes, smoking status, body-mass index, interstitial lung disease, cardiovascular diseases, cancer, corticosteroid use, chronic renal failure, and the underlying disease [rheumatoid arthritis vs others]). Odds ratios and hazard ratios and their 95% CIs were calculated as effect size, by dividing the two population mean differences by their SD. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04353609. Findings: Between April 15, 2020, and Nov 20, 2020, data were collected for 1090 patients (mean age 55·2 years [SD 16·4]); 734 (67%) were female and 356 (33%) were male. Of the 1090 patients, 137 (13%) developed severe COVID-19 and 89 (8%) died. After adjusting for potential confounding factors, severe disease was observed more frequently (effect size 3·26, 95% CI 1·66-6·40, p=0·0006) and the duration of hospital stay was markedly longer (0·62, 0·46-0·85, p=0·0024) in the 63 patients in the rituximab group than in the 1027 patients in the no rituximab group. 13 (21%) of 63 patients in the rituximab group died compared with 76 (7%) of 1027 patients in the no rituximab group, but the adjusted risk of death was not significantly increased in the rituximab group (effect size 1·32, 95% CI 0·55-3·19, p=0·53). Interpretation: Rituximab therapy is associated with more severe COVID-19. Rituximab will have to be prescribed with particular caution in patients with inflammatory rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases.

The gastrointestinal (GI) tract is now an appreciated portal of infection. SARS-CoV-2 enters host cells via angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) and the serine protease TMPRSS2. Eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorders (EGIDs) are inflammatory conditions caused by chronic type 2 (T2) inflammation. the effects of the T2 atopic inflammatory milieu on SARS-COV-2 viral entry gene expression in the GI tract is poorly understood. We analyzed tissue ACE2 and TMPRSS2 gene expression in pediatric eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), eosinophilic gastritis (EG), and in normal adult esophagi using publicly available RNA-sequencing datasets. Similar to findings evaluating the airway, there was no difference in tissue ACE2/TMPRSS2 expression in EoE or EG when compared with control non-EoE/EG esophagus/stomach. ACE2 gene expression was significantly lower in esophagi from children with or without EoE and from adults with EoE as compared with normal adult esophagi. Type 2 immunity and pediatric age could be protective for infection by SARS-CoV-2 in the gastrointestinal tract because of decreased expression of ACE2.","Chiang, Austin W T; Duong, Loan D; Shoda, Tetsuo; Nhu, Quan M; Ruffner, Melanie; Hara, Takeo; Aaron, Bailey; Joplin, Erik; Manresa, Mario C; Abonia, J Pablo; Dellon, Evan S; Hirano, Ikuo; Gonsalves, Nirmala; Gupta, Sandeep K; Furuta, Glenn T; Rothenberg, Marc E; Lewis, Nathan E; Muir, Amanda B; Aceves, Seema S",J Pediatr Gastroenterol Nutr,293,16

Much research has been carried out since the outbreak, but few studies have focused on the dysfunction of the adaptive immunity. METHODS: In this retrospective and multi-center study, 373 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center and Affiliated Hospital of Putian University were recruited. Demographic, clinical, radiological features, and laboratory data were recorded and analyzed at admission and at discharge. Results of immunological tests were followed up until the patients were discharged. RESULTS: Of the 373 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, 322 were in the non-severe group and 51 were in the severe group. Number of T cells, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, and total lymphocytes declined remarkably upon admission and elevated when the patients were discharged. At admission, counts of total lymphocytes, T cells, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, and levels of C3 and C4 in the severe group were lower than those in the non-severe group, whereas the neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) was higher in the severe group. Counts of T cells, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, and total lymphocytes were negatively correlated with lactate dehydrogenase and C-reactive protein. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 might target adaptive immunity and cause a decrease in lymphocytes, especially T cells and subsets. Physicians should pay close attention to the adaptive immunity of patients upon admission. Monitoring NLR, T lymphocytes, and subsets would help physicians with the proper diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19.The reviews of this paper are available via the supplemental material section.","Xie, Liang; Wu, Qinhan; Lin, Qunying; Liu, Xuhui; Lin, Weihua; Hao, Shengyu; Hu, Weiping; Xiang, Guiling; Lu, Hongzhou; Li, Shanqun",Ther Adv Respir Dis,293,9

However, for patients with severe viral pneumonia, the corticosteroid treatment is highly controversial. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this review is to systematically evaluate the effect and potential mechanism of corticosteroid administration in pandemic viral pneumonia. SOURCES: We comprehensively searched all manuscripts on corticosteroid therapy for influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) viral pneumonia from the PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science and Cochrane Library databases. CONTENT: We systematically summarized the effects of corticosteroid therapy for pandemic viral pneumonia and the potential mechanism of action for corticosteroids in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). IMPLICATIONS: Observational studies showed that corticosteroid treatment was associated with increased mortality and nosocomial infections for influenza and delayed virus clearance for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Limited data on corticosteroid therapy for COVID-19 were reported. Corticosteroids were used in about a fifth of patients (670/2995, 22.4%). Although clinical observational studies reported the improvement in symptoms and oxygenation for individuals with severe COVID-19 who received corticosteroid therapy, case fatality rate in the corticosteroid group was significantly higher than that in the non-corticosteroid group (69/443, 15.6% versus 56/1310, 4.3%). Compared individuals with non-severe disease, those with severe disease were more likely to receive corticosteroid therapy (201/382, 52.6% versus 201/1310, 15.3%). Although there is no evidence that corticosteroid therapy reduces mortality in people with COVID-19, some improvements in clinical symptoms and oxygenation were reported in some clinical observational studies. Excessive inflammatory response and lymphopenia might be critical factors associated with severity of and mortality from COVID-19. Sufficiently powered randomized controlled trials with rigorous inclusion/exclusion criteria and standardized dose and duration of corticosteroids are needed to verify the effectiveness and safety of corticosteroid therapy.","Yang, J-W; Yang, L; Luo, R-G; Xu, J-F",Clin. microbiol. infect,293,16

The current method of detection involves a quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR)-based technique, which identifies the viral nucleic acids when present in sufficient quantity. False-negative results can be achieved and failure to quarantine the infected patient would be a major setback in containing the viral transmission. We aim to describe the time kinetics of various antibodies produced against the 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and evaluate the potential of antibody testing to diagnose COVID-19. METHODS: The host humoral response against SARS-CoV-2, including IgA, IgM, and IgG response, was examined by using an ELISA-based assay on the recombinant viral nucleocapsid protein. 208 plasma samples were collected from 82 confirmed and 58 probable cases (qPCR negative but with typical manifestation). The diagnostic value of IgM was evaluated in this cohort. RESULTS: The median duration of IgM and IgA antibody detection was 5 (IQR, 3-6) days, while IgG was detected 14 (IQR, 10-18) days after symptom onset, with a positive rate of 85.4%, 92.7%, and 77.9%, respectively. In confirmed and probable cases, the positive rates of IgM antibodies were 75.6% and 93.1%, respectively. The detection efficiency by IgM ELISA is higher than that of qPCR after 5.5 days of symptom onset. The positive detection rate is significantly increased (98.6%) when combining IgM ELISA assay with PCR for each patient compared with a single qPCR test (51.9%). CONCLUSIONS: The humoral response to SARS-CoV-2 can aid in the diagnosis of COVID-19, including subclinical cases.","Guo, Li; Ren, Lili; Yang, Siyuan; Xiao, Meng; Chang, De; Yang, Fan; Dela Cruz, Charles S; Wang, Yingying; Wu, Chao; Xiao, Yan; Zhang, Lulu; Han, Lianlian; Dang, Shengyuan; Xu, Yan; Yang, Qi-Wen; Xu, Sheng-Yong; Zhu, Hua-Dong; Xu, Ying-Chun; Jin, Qi; Sharma, Lokesh; Wang, Linghang; Wang, Jianwei",Clin Infect Dis,293,1

Hence, clinicians and policymakers require reliable evidence on COVID-19 epidemiology and consequences in this population. We aimed to assess the susceptibility of pregnant women to SARS-CoV-2 and women's perceived impact of the pandemic on their breastfeeding practices, medical counseling and social support. We performed a cross-sectional study using an online survey in primary care in Belgium. Pregnant and breastfeeding women and women who breastfed in the preceding four weeks were eligible to participate. The survey was distributed through social media in April 2020. In total, 6470 women participated (i.e., 2647 pregnant and 3823 breastfeeding women). Overall, 0.3% of all respondents reported to have tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, not indicating a higher susceptibility of pregnant women to contracting COVID-19. More than 90% refuted that the pandemic affected their breastfeeding practices, nor indicated that the coronavirus was responsible for breastfeeding cessation. Half of the women even considered giving longer breastmilk because of the coronavirus. In contrast, women's medical counseling and social support were negatively affected by the lockdown. Women without previous breastfeeding experience and in the early postpartum period experienced a higher burden in terms of reduced medical counseling and support. In the future, more consideration and alternative supportive measures such as tele-visits by midwives or perinatal organizations are required for these women.","Ceulemans, Michael; Verbakel, Jan Y; Van Calsteren, Kristel; Eerdekens, An; Allegaert, Karel; Foulon, Veerle",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),293,26

Methods: Serial samples were collected from patients receiving maintenance haemodialysis (HD). Thirty-nine patients had confirmed COVID-19 and 10 patients had no evidence of COVID-19. Plasma C5a and C3a levels were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results: We identified elevated levels of plasma C3a and C5a in HD patients with severe COVID-19 compared with controls. Serial sampling identified that C5a levels were elevated prior to clinical deterioration in patients who developed severe disease. C3a more closely mirrored both clinical and biochemical disease severity. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that activation of complement plays a role in the pathogenesis of COVID-19, leading to endothelial injury and lung damage. C5a may be an earlier biomarker of disease severity than conventional parameters such as C-reactive protein and this warrants further investigation in dedicated biomarker studies. Our data support the testing of complement inhibition as a therapeutic strategy for patients with severe COVID-19.","Prendecki, Maria; Clarke, Candice; Medjeral-Thomas, Nicholas; McAdoo, Stephen P; Sandhu, Eleanor; Peters, James E; Thomas, David C; Willicombe, Michelle; Botto, Marina; Pickering, Matthew C",Clin Kidney J,293,1

For this purpose, machine learning tools selected three biomarkers that predict the mortality of individual patients more than 10 days in advance with more than 90% accuracy: lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), lymphocyte and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP). In particular, relatively high levels of LDH alone seem to play a crucial role in distinguishing the vast majority of cases that require immediate medical attention. This finding is consistent with current medical knowledge that high LDH levels are associated with tissue breakdown occurring in various diseases, including pulmonary disorders such as pneumonia. Overall, this Article suggests a simple and operable decision rule to quickly predict patients at the highest risk, allowing them to be prioritized and potentially reducing the mortality rate.","Yan, Li; Zhang, Hai-Tao; Goncalves, Jorge; Xiao, Yang; Wang, Maolin; Guo, Yuqi; Sun, Chuan; Tang, Xiuchuan; Jing, Liang; Zhang, Mingyang; Huang, Xiang; Xiao, Ying; Cao, Haosen; Chen, Yanyan; Ren, Tongxin; Wang, Fang; Xiao, Yaru; Huang, Sufang; Tan, Xi; Huang, Niannian; Jiao, Bo; Cheng, Cheng; Zhang, Yong; Luo, Ailin; Mombaerts, Laurent; Jin, Junyang; Cao, Zhiguo; Li, Shusheng; Xu, Hui; Yuan, Ye",Nat.

Thus, it is very promising for prophylaxis and treatment of COVID-19, along with other coexistent flavonoids such as naringin, which could help restraining the proinflammatory overreaction of the immune system. Controlled hydrodynamic cavitation processes showed the highest speed, effectiveness and efficiency in the integral and green aqueous extraction of flavonoids, essential oils and pectin from citrus peel waste. After freeze-drying, the extracted pectin showed high quality and excellent antioxidant and antibacterial activities, attributed to flavonoids and essential oils adsorbed and concentrated on its surface. This study reviews the recent evidence about hesperidin as a promising molecule, and proposes a feasible and affordable process based on hydrodynamic cavitation for the integral aqueous extraction of citrus peel waste resulting in hesperidin-rich products, either aqueous extracts or pectin tablets. The uptake of this process on a relevant scale is urged, in order to achieve large-scale production and distribution of hesperidin-rich products. Meanwhile, experimental and clinical studies could determine the effective doses either for therapeutic and preventive purposes.","Meneguzzo, Francesco; Ciriminna, Rosaria; Zabini, Federica; Pagliaro, Mario",Process.,293,3

Whole-genome sequencing can be useful for this but has limited power for trait prediction. However, we can take advantage of the inherent information content of phenotypes to bypass these limitations. We demonstrate, in clinical and environmental bacterial isolates, that growth dynamics in standardized conditions can differentiate between genotypes, even among strains from the same species. We find that for pairs of isolates, there is little correlation between genetic distance, according to phylogenetic analysis, and phenotypic distance, as determined by growth dynamics. This absence of correlation underscores the challenge in using genomics to infer phenotypes and vice versa. Bypassing this complexity, we show that growth dynamics alone can robustly predict antibiotic responses. These findings are a foundation for a method to identify traits not easily traced to a genetic mechanism.","Zhang, Carolyn; Song, Wenchen; Ma, Helena R; Peng, Xiao; Anderson, Deverick J; Fowler, Vance G; Thaden, Joshua T; Xiao, Minfeng; You, Lingchong",Proc.

Acute ingestion of anthocyanins improves postprandial glucose responses to a single carbohydrate-rich meal under strictly controlled conditions. PURPOSE: Examine whether acute and short-term supplementation with anthocyanin-rich New Zealand blackcurrant (NZBC) extract can improve postprandial glucose responses to mixed-macronutrient meals. METHODS: Twenty-five overweight (BMI > 25 kg m2) sedentary individuals participated in one of the following double-blinded, randomised controlled trials: (1) ingestion of 600 mg NZBC extract or placebo prior to consumption of a high-carbohydrate, high-fat liquid meal (n = 12); (2) 8-days supplementation with NZBC extract (600 mg day-1) or placebo, with insulin sensitivity and markers of inflammation assessed on day-7, and free-living postprandial glucose (continuous glucose monitoring) assessed on day-8 (n = 13). RESULTS: A single dose of NZBC extract had no effect on 3 h postprandial glucose, insulin or triglyceride responses. However, in response to short-term NZBC extract supplementation insulin sensitivity was improved (+ 22%; P = 0.011), circulating C-reactive protein concentrations decreased (P = 0.008), and free-living postprandial glucose responses to both breakfast and lunch meals were reduced (- 9% and - 8%, respectively; P < 0.05), compared to placebo. CONCLUSION: These novel results indicate that repeated intake, rather than a single dose of NZBC extract, is required to induce beneficial effects on insulin sensitivity and postprandial glucose handling in individuals with overweight or obesity. Continuous glucose monitoring enabled an effect of NZBC extract to be observed under free-living conditions and highlights the potential of anthocyanin-rich supplements as a viable strategy to reduce insulin resistance.","Nolan, A; Brett, R; Strauss, J A; Stewart, C E; Shepherd, S O",Eur. j. nutr,293,16

In the first stage, the post-acute care system must, to the extent possible, help relieve acute hospitals of non-COVID-19 patients to create as much inpatient capacity as possible over the surge period. In the second stage after the initial surge as subsided, post-acute providers must protect vulnerable populations from COVID-19, prepare treat-in-place protocols for non-COVID-19 admissions, and create and formalize COVID-19 specific settings. In the third stage after a vaccine has been developed or an effective prophylactic option is available, post-acute care providers must assist with distribution and administration of vaccinations and prophylaxis, develop strategies to deliver non-COVID-19 related medical care, and begin to transition to the post-COVID-19 landscape.

The Covid-19 outbreak accelerated social change and led to a forced entry of entire segments of the workforce into telework. The change was steep in particular for countries with a lower pre-pandemic incidence of working from home, such as Romania. Using longitudinal data from an original series of surveys (Voicu et al. 2020) carried out in 2018 and during the Spring 2020 lockdown in Romania, the paper aims to explore the job satisfaction of those working-from-home in relation to work-life boundaries, before and during the quarantine period. Findings are useful for a deeper understanding of how new work arrangements influence tele-workers' perceptions of their quality of life. Results indicate that while before the pandemic, the job satisfaction of those working from home was increasing with the age of the respondent (the younger being more satisfied with working from home), that trend changed during quarantine, and job satisfaction increased significantly for people over 40. Additionally, working more hours before the pandemic is associated with lower job satisfaction scores during COVID-19 quarantine.Alternate abstract:Bazată pe dezvoltarea TIC, telemunca reprezintă un fenomen de schimbare rapidă (Eurofound 2017) ce a provocat numeroase dezbateri cu privire la modul în care influențează viața oamenilor (Allen, Golden și Shockley 2015;Golden 2009), permițând acum acestora să lucreze de oriunde și oricând prin intermediul laptopurilor, tabletelor și smartphone-urilor (Maitland and Thomson 2014). Declanșarea crizei Covid-19 a accelerat schimbările sociale și a dus la o intrare forțată a întregii populații în telemuncă. Schimbarea accelerată s-a produs în special în țările cu incidență pre-pandemică scăzută în ceea ce privește experiența de a lucra de acasă, cum este cazul României.

Kidney dysfunction is common among patients with COVID-19, and patients who develop acute kidney injury (AKI) have inferior outcomes. There is a growing body of evidence that AKI occurs in a substantial number of patients with COVID-19 and that developing AKI is associated with significantly worse outcomes for COVID-19 patients. The risk for death was amplified when AKI resulted in kidney replacement therapy (KRT). Subject of Review: The Study of the Treatment and Outcomes in Critically Ill Patients with COVID-19 (STOP-COVID) conducted a multicenter retrospective observational study enrolling 3,099 critically ill adults with COVID-19 admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) (J Am Soc Nephrol 2021;32:161-176). A total of 637 of 3,099 patients (20.6%) developed AKI treated with KRT (AKI-KRT) within 14 days of ICU admission, 350 of whom (54.9%) died within 28 days of ICU admission. Predictors of COVID-19 patients' progress to AKI-KRT were higher BMI, higher stages of CKD, lower ratio of the partial pressure of arterial oxygen over the fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO2:FiO2 ratio) on ICU admission, and greater number of vasopressors received on ICU admission. Second Opinion: Recently, some investigations revealed that the independent predictors of COVID-19 with AKI include older age, Black race, diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, mechanical ventilation, higher interleukin-6 level, and use of vasopressor medications. It seems that the underlying comorbidities with preexisting vascular endothelial damage and/or the more serious critically ill CO-VID-19 patients can contribute to the development of AKI and even AKI-KRT.","Chen, Yung-Chang; Fang, Ji-Tseng; Yang, Chih-Wei",Nephron,293,16

Our study aimed to evaluate the relationship between BMI and EPS in patients with schizophrenia. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Using data from the Research on Asian Psychotropic Prescription Patterns for Antipsychotics (REAP-AP) study, we compared the prevalence of EPS in 1448 schizophrenia patients stratified as underweight, normal range, overweight pre-obese, overweight obese I, overweight obese II, and overweight obese III according to the World Health Organization (WHO) classification system for body weight status, and with underweight, normal range, overweight at risk, overweight obese I, and overweight obese II according to the Asia-Pacific obesity classification. RESULTS: In the first step of the WHO classification system for body weight status, adjusting for the potential effects of confounding factors, the multinomial logistic regression model revealed that underweight was significantly associated with greater rates of bradykinesia and muscle rigidity, and a lower rate of gait disturbance. In the second step of the Asia-Pacific obesity classification, adjusting for the potential effects of confounding factors, the multinomial logistic regression model revealed that underweight was significantly associated with a higher rate of muscle rigidity. CONCLUSION: Findings of the present study consistently revealed that underweight was associated with a greater rate of muscle rigidity in a stepwise pattern among Asian patients with schizophrenia. Although the mechanism underlying the inverse relationship between BMI and muscle rigidity cannot be sufficiently explained, it is speculated that low BMI may contribute to the development of muscle rigidity regardless of antipsychotic ""typicality"" and dose in patients with schizophrenia.","Park, Seon-Cheol; Tripathi, Adarsh; Avasthi, Ajit; Grover, Sandeep; Tanra, Andi J; Kato, Takahiro A; Inada, Toshiya; Chee, Kok Yoon; Chong, Mian-Yoon; Yang, Shu-Yu; Lin, Sih-Ku; Sim, Kang; Xiang, Yu-Tao; Javed, Afzal; Sartorius, Norman; Shinfuku, Naotaka; Park, Yong Chon",Psychiatr Danub,293,16

This inherent feature often leads to altered virulence, infectivity and transmissibility, and antigenic shifts to escape host immunity, which might compromise the efficacy of vaccines and antiviral drugs. Therefore, we carried out a genome-wide analysis of circulating SARS-CoV-2 strains to detect the emergence of novel co-existing mutations and trace their geographical distribution within India. Comprehensive analysis of whole genome sequences of 837 Indian SARS-CoV-2 strains revealed the occurrence of 33 different mutations, 18 of which were unique to India. Novel mutations were observed in the S glycoprotein (6/33), NSP3 (5/33), RdRp/NSP12 (4/33), NSP2 (2/33), and N (1/33). Non-synonymous mutations were found to be 3.07 times more prevalent than synonymous mutations. We classified the Indian isolates into 22 groups based on their co-existing mutations. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the representative strains of each group were divided into various sub-clades within their respective clades, based on the presence of unique co-existing mutations. The A2a clade was found to be dominant in India (71.34%), followed by A3 (23.29%) and B (5.36%), but a heterogeneous distribution was observed among various geographical regions. The A2a clade was highly predominant in East India, Western India, and Central India, whereas the A2a and A3 clades were nearly equal in prevalence in South and North India. This study highlights the divergent evolution of SARS-CoV-2 strains and co-circulation of multiple clades in India. Monitoring of the emerging mutations will pave the way for vaccine formulation and the design of antiviral drugs.","Sarkar, Rakesh; Mitra, Suvrotoa; Chandra, Pritam; Saha, Priyanka; Banerjee, Anindita; Dutta, Shanta; Chawla-Sarkar, Mamta",Arch Virol,293,24

Our aim was to understand the challenges faced by psychiatrists of different professional backgrounds when assessing under 18 year olds in a health-based Place of Safety (POS).MethodWe circulated a survey to all psychiatrists on the on-call rota, to gather quantitative and qualitative information on the challenges posed by assessments of under-18s in a POS and assess whether an under-18 specific policy was needed.ResultOut of the 50 psychiatrists invited, 27 completed this survey (during February 2021). 33.3% of respondents reported that they had completed a POS assessment of an under 18-year-old when a Consultant Child and Adolescent Psychiatrist/Registrar was not available to join. 33.3% of respondents had been asked to complete such an assessment as the sole psychiatrist joining the AMHP, with 24% of those respondents reporting feeling uncomfortable doing these assessments without a second doctor present, and an additional 24% feeling comfortable only sometimes. 48.1% of the doctors surveyed did not invite parents or carers to take part in the assessment, despite this being considered best practice, citing reasons such as: being unaware that this was a possibility, assessments conducted at unsociable hours, safeguarding concerns involving the parents, and social distancing in the context of COVID-19. 41% of respondents had assessed vulnerable young people (children looked after or with a diagnosis of an autism spectrum condition) in the POS and reported that these assessments posed significant challenges to safe discharge planning and identifying appropriate placements. 81.5% felt that a tailored policy for young people was needed. Qualitative findings suggest psychiatrists think such a policy should include clear procedures (flowcharts), potential outcome scenarios/options for safe discharge, referral criteria for CAMHS, contact details for key staff members, a handover protocol. Respondents felt a shared policy with all stakeholders (AMHP service, Mental Health Services, police) was required.ConclusionOur survey highlights the challenges for non-CAMHS specialists assessing under 18s in a health-based POS and the need for an under-18 policy to support safe practice. Major themes will be further explored in a focus group to guide policy development.","Turtoi, Nicoleta Clarisa Ansell Martin Govender Trinisha Bould Helen",BJPsych Open,293,24

Thus, a variety of centrality-based methods have been proposed to identify the most influential spreaders. However, most of the existing studies have overlooked the fact that in real social networks it is more costly and difficult to convince influential individuals to act as initial spreaders, resulting in a high risk in maximizing the spreading. In this paper, we address this problem on the basis of the assumption that large-degree nodes are activated with a higher risk than small-degree nodes. We aim to identify the effective initial spreaders to maximize spreading when considering both the activation risk and the outbreak size of initial spreaders. On random networks, the analytical analysis reveals that the degree of optimal initial spreaders does not correspond to the largest degree of nodes in the network but rather be determined by infection probability and difference of activation risk among nodes with different degree. Here, we propose a risk-aware metric to identify the effective spreaders on real networks. The numerical simulation shows that the risk-aware metric outperforms the existing benchmark centralities in maximizing the effective spreading.","Xue, Leyang; Zhang, Peng; Zeng, An",,293,23

Several studies have shown that tomographic patterns seen on chest Computed Tomography (CT), such as ground-glass opacities, consolidations, and crazy paving pattern, are correlated with the disease severity and progression. CT imaging can thus emerge as an important modality for the management of COVID-19 patients. AI-based solutions can be used to support CT based quantitative reporting and make reading efficient and reproducible if quantitative biomarkers, such as the Percentage of Opacity (PO), can be automatically computed. However, COVID-19 has posed unique challenges to the development of AI, specifically concerning the availability of appropriate image data and annotations at scale. In this paper, we propose to use synthetic datasets to augment an existing COVID-19 database to tackle these challenges. We train a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to inpaint COVID-19 related tomographic patterns on chest CTs from patients without infectious diseases. Additionally, we leverage location priors derived from manually labeled COVID-19 chest CTs patients to generate appropriate abnormality distributions. Synthetic data are used to improve both lung segmentation and segmentation of COVID-19 patterns by adding 20% of synthetic data to the real COVID-19 training data. We collected 2143 chest CTs, containing 327 COVID-19 positive cases, acquired from 12 sites across 7 countries. By testing on 100 COVID-19 positive and 100 control cases, we show that synthetic data can help improve both lung segmentation (+6.02% lesion inclusion rate) and abnormality segmentation (+2.78% dice coefficient), leading to an overall more accurate PO computation (+2.82% Pearson coefficient).","Liu, Siqi; Georgescu, Bogdan; Xu, Zhoubing; Yoo, Youngjin; Chabin, Guillaume; Chaganti, Shikha; Grbic, Sasa; Piat, Sebastian; Teixeira, Brian; Balachandran, Abishek; Vishwanath, RS; Re, Thomas; Comaniciu, Dorin",,293,0

The aim was to assess the cross-cultural and cross-linguistic feasibility of an intervention method developed for English-speaking children. Method A nonconcurrent multiple-baseline design was used with four baseline data points and 16 intervention sessions per participant. The intervention design incorporated implicit learning principles, high treatment dosage, and control of the phonological neighborhood density of the stimuli. The children (24-39 months) attended 7-9 weeks of twice weekly input-based treatment in which no explicit verbal production was required from the child. Each target word was provided as input a minimum of 64 times in at least two intervention sessions. Treatment feasibility was measured by comparison of how many of the target and control words the child produced across the intervention period, and parent-reported expressive vocabulary checklists were completed for comparison of pre- and postintervention child spoken vocabulary size. An omnibus effect size for the treatment effect of the number of target and control words produced across time was calculated using Kendall's Tau. Results There was a significant treatment effect for target words learned in intervention relative to baselines, and all children produced significantly more target than control words across the intervention period. The effect of phonological neighborhood density on expressive word production could not be evaluated because two of the three children learned all target words. Conclusion The results provide cross-cultural evidence of the feasibility of a model of intervention that incorporated a high-dosage, cross-situational statistical learning paradigm to teach spoken word production to children with small expressive lexicons.","S-Y Ng, Christine; Stokes, Stephanie F; Alt, Mary",J Speech Lang Hear Res,293,1

Anakinra, a recombinant interleukin-1 receptor antagonist, is known to be effective in several hyperinflammatory diseases. We investigated the effects of anakinra on inflammatory parameters and clinical outcomes in critically ill, mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients with clinical features of hyperinflammation. METHODS: In this prospective cohort study, 21 critically ill COVID-19 patients treated with anakinra were compared to a group of standard care. Serial data of clinical inflammatory parameters and concentrations of multiple circulating cytokines were determined and aligned on start day of anakinra in the treatment group, and median start day of anakinra in the control group. Analysis was performed for day - 10 to + 10 relative to alignment day. Clinical outcomes were analyzed during 28 days. Additionally, three sensitivity analyses were performed: (1) using propensity score-matched groups, (2) selecting patients who did not receive corticosteroids, and (3) using a subset of the control group aimed to match the criteria (fever, elevated ferritin) for starting anakinra treatment. RESULTS: Baseline patient characteristics and clinical parameters on ICU admission were similar between groups. As a consequence of bias by indication, plasma levels of aspartate aminotransferase (ASAT) (p = 0.0002), ferritin (p = 0.009), and temperature (p = 0.001) were significantly higher in the anakinra group on alignment day. Following treatment, no relevant differences in kinetics of circulating cytokines were observed between both groups. Decreases of clinical parameters, including temperature (p = 0.03), white blood cell counts (p = 0.02), and plasma levels of ferritin (p = 0.003), procalcitonin (p = 0.001), creatinine (p = 0.01), and bilirubin (p = 0.007), were more pronounced in the anakinra group. No differences in duration of mechanical ventilation or ICU length of stay were observed between groups. Sensitivity analyses confirmed these results. CONCLUSIONS: Anakinra is effective in reducing clinical signs of hyperinflammation in critically ill COVID-19 patients. A randomized controlled trial is warranted to draw conclusion about the effects of anakinra on clinical outcomes.","Kooistra, Emma J; Waalders, Nicole J B; Grondman, Inge; Janssen, Nico A F; de Nooijer, Aline H; Netea, Mihai G; van de Veerdonk, Frank L; Ewalds, Esther; van der Hoeven, Johannes G; Kox, Matthijs; Pickkers, Peter",Crit Care,293,16

There is currently no vaccine or effective treatment for COVID-19. Early diagnosis and management is key to favourable outcomes. In order to prevent more widespread transmission of the virus, rapid detection and isolation of confirmed cases is of utmost importance. Real time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is currently the ""gold standard"" for the detection of SARS-COV-2. There are several challenges associated with this test from sample collection to processing and the longer turnaround time for the results to be available. More rapid and faster diagnostic tests that may produce results within minutes to a few hours will be instrumental in controlling the disease. Serological tests that detect specific antibodies to the virus may be such options. In this review, we extensively searched for studies that compared RT-PCR with serological tests for the diagnosis of COVID-19. We extracted the data from the various selected studies that compared the different tests and summarised the available evidence to determine which test is more appropriate especially in Africa.

It has been known since the 1960s that coronaviruses can cause respiratory infections in humans; however, their epidemic potential was understood only during the past two decades. In the present review, we address current knowledge on coronaviruses from a short history to epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestation of the disease, as well as treatment and prevention strategies. Although a great amount of research and efforts have been made worldwide to prevent further outbreaks of coronavirus­associated disease, the spread and lethality of the 2019 outbreak (COVID­19) is proving to be higher than previous epidemics on account of international travel density and immune naivety of the population. Only strong, joint and coordinated efforts of worldwide healthcare systems, researchers, and pharmaceutical companies and receptive national leaders will succeed in suppressing an outbreak of this scale.","Docea, Anca Oana; Tsatsakis, Aristidis; Albulescu, Dana; Cristea, Oana; Zlatian, Ovidiu; Vinceti, Marco; Moschos, Sterghios A; Tsoukalas, Dimitris; Goumenou, Marina; Drakoulis, Nikolaos; Dumanov, Josef M; Tutelyan, Victor A; Onischenko, Gennadii G; Aschner, Michael; Spandidos, Demetrios A; Calina, Daniela",Int J Mol Med,293,22

Scientifically, several studies in the literature state that information and communication technologies have great potential to reduce the costs of health care services in terms of planning and making appropriate decisions that provide timely tools to patients. Another clear benefit is the equity of access to health care. The evolution of telemedicine poses a series of legal problems ranging from the profiles on the subject of authorization and accreditation to those concerning the protection of patient confidentiality, the definition and solution of which, in the absence of specific regulatory provisions, is mainly left to the assessment of compatibility of the practices adopted so far, with the general regulatory framework. In terms of professional liability, it is necessary to first clarify that the telemedicine service is comparable to any diagnostic-therapeutic health service considering that the telemedicine service does not replace the traditional health service, but integrates the latter to improve its effectiveness, efficiency and appropriateness.","Ferorelli, D; Nardelli, L; Spagnolo, L; Corradi, S; Silvestre, M; Misceo, F; Marrone, M; Zotti, F; Mandarelli, G; Solarino, B; Dell039,; Erba, A",J Prim Care Community Health,293,22

We aimed to describe the characteristics and outcomes and to analyze the risk factors for in-hospital mortality of COVID-19 patients with diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This two-center retrospective study was performed at two tertiary hospitals in Wuhan, China. Confirmed COVID-19 patients with diabetes (N = 153) who were discharged or died from 1 January 2020 to 8 March 2020 were identified. One sex- and age-matched COVID-19 patient without diabetes was randomly selected for each patient with diabetes. Demographic, clinical, and laboratory data were abstracted. Cox proportional hazards regression analyses were performed to identify the risk factors associated with the mortality in these patients. RESULTS: Of 1,561 COVID-19 patients, 153 (9.8%) had diabetes, with a median age of 64.0 (interquartile range 56.0-72.0) years. A higher proportion of intensive care unit admission (17.6% vs. 7.8%, P = 0.01) and more fatal cases (20.3% vs. 10.5%, P = 0.017) were identified in COVID-19 patients with diabetes than in the matched patients. Multivariable Cox regression analyses of these 306 patients showed that hypertension (hazard ratio [HR] 2.50, 95% CI 1.30-4.78), cardiovascular disease (HR 2.24, 95% CI 1.19-4.23), and chronic pulmonary disease (HR 2.51, 95% CI 1.07-5.90) were independently associated with in-hospital death. Diabetes (HR 1.58, 95% CI 0.84-2.99) was not statistically significantly associated with in-hospital death after adjustment. Among patients with diabetes, nonsurvivors were older (76.0 vs. 63.0 years), most were male (71.0% vs. 29.0%), and they were more likely to have underlying hypertension (83.9% vs. 50.0%) and cardiovascular disease (45.2% vs. 14.8%) (all P values <0.05). Age &#8805;70 years (HR 2.39, 95% CI 1.03-5.56) and hypertension (HR 3.10, 95% CI 1.14-8.44) were independent risk factors for in-hospital death of patients with diabetes. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 patients with diabetes had worse outcomes compared with the sex- and age-matched patients without diabetes.

Therefore, thorough comorbidities assessment can help establish risk stratification of patients with COVID-19, upon hospital admission. Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) is a validated, simple, and readily applicable method of estimating the risk of death from comorbid disease and has been widely used as a predictor of long-term prognosis and survival. METHODS: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of CCI score and a composite of poor outcomes through several databases. RESULTS: Compared to a CCI score of 0, a CCI score of 1-2 and CCI score of &#8805;3 was prognostically associated with mortality and associated with a composite of poor outcomes. Per point increase of CCI score also increased mortality risk by 16%. Moreover, a higher mean CCI score also significantly associated with mortality and disease severity. CONCLUSION: CCI score should be utilized for risk stratifications of hospitalized COVID-19 patients.","Tuty Kuswardhani, R A; Henrina, Joshua; Pranata, Raymond; Anthonius Lim, Michael; Lawrensia, Sherly; Suastika, Ketut",Diabetes Metab Syndr,293,20

This has been possible due to the proliferation of data and the development of new methods to gather, mine and analyze it. A key role has also been played by the latest advances in new disciplines like network science. Nonetheless, current models still lack a faithful representation of all possible heterogeneities and features that can be extracted from data. Here, we bridge a current gap in the mathematical modeling of infectious diseases and develop a framework that allows to account simultaneously for both the connectivity of individuals and the age-structure of the population. We compare different scenarios, namely, i) the homogeneous mixing setting, ii) one in which only the social mixing is taken into account, iii) a setting that considers the connectivity of individuals alone, and finally, iv) a multilayer representation in which both the social mixing and the number of contacts are included in the model. We analytically show that the thresholds obtained for these four scenarios are different. In addition, we conduct extensive numerical simulations and conclude that heterogeneities in the contact network are important for a proper determination of the epidemic threshold, whereas the age-structure plays a bigger role beyond the onset of the outbreak. Altogether, when it comes to evaluate interventions such as vaccination, both sources of individual heterogeneity are important and should be concurrently considered. Our results also provide an indication of the errors incurred in situations in which one cannot access all needed information in terms of connectivity and age of the population.","Aleta, Alberto; Arruda, Guilherme Ferraz de; Moreno, Yamir",,293,30

Population mobility is an important factor that drives the spread of COVID-19. This study aimed to quantitatively evaluate the impact of population flow on the spread of COVID-19 from a spatiotemporal perspective. To this end, a case study was carried out in Hubei Province, which was once the most affected area of COVID-19 outbreak in Mainland China. The geographically and temporally weighted regression (GTWR) model was applied to model the spatiotemporal association between COVID-19 epidemic and population mobility. Two patterns of population flows, including the population inflow from Wuhan and intra-city population movement, were considered to construct explanatory variables. Results indicate that the GTWR model can reveal the spatial-temporal-varying relationships between COVID-19 and population mobility. Moreover, the association between COVID-19 case counts and population movements presented three stages of temporal variation characteristics due to the virus incubation period and implementation of strict lockdown measures. In the spatial dimension, evident geographical disparities were observed across Hubei Province. These findings can provide policymakers useful knowledge about the impact of population movement on the spatio-temporal transmission of COVID-19. Thus, targeted interventions, if necessary in certain time periods, can be implemented to restrict population flow in cities with high transmission risk.","Chen, Y.; Chen, M.; Huang, B.; Wu, C.; Shi, W.",GeoHealth,293,33

The current article reviewed various possible decontamination methods for FFR reuse including ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI), hydrogen peroxide vapor (HPV), microwave-generated steam (MGS), hydrogen peroxide gas plasma (HPGP), and 70% or higher ethanol solution. HPV decontamination was effective against bacterial spores (6 log10 reduction of Geobacillus stearothermophilus spores) on FFRs and viruses (> 4 log10 reduction of various types of viruses) on inanimate surfaces, and no degradation of respirator materials and fit has been reported. 70% or higher ethanol decontamination showed high efficacy in inactivation of coronaviruses on inanimate surfaces (> 3.9 log10 reduction) but it was lower on FFRs which filtration efficiency was also decreased. UVGI method had good biocidal efficacy on FFRs (> 3 log10 reduction of H1N1 virus) combined with inexpensive, readily available equipment; however, it was more time-consuming to ensure sufficient reduction in SARS-CoV-2. MGS treatment also provided good viral decontamination on FFRs (> 4 log10 reduction of H1N1 virus) along with less time-intensive process and readily available equipment while inconsistent disinfection on the treated surfaces and deterioration of nose cushion of FFRs were observed. HPGP was a good virucidal system (> 6 log10 reduction of Vesicular stomatitis virus) but filtration efficiency after decontamination was inconsistent. Overall, HPV appeared to be one of the most promising methods based on the high biocidal efficacy on FFRs, preservation of respirator performance after multiple cycles, and no residual chemical toxicity. Nonetheless, equipment cost and time of the HPV process and a suitable operating room need to be considered.","Thaper, Ravinder; Fagen, Brendan; Oh, Jonghwa",Protochem. photobiol. sci,293,33

Vaccine uptake rate is a crucial determinant for herd immunity. We examined factors associated with acceptance of vaccine based on (1). constructs of the Health Belief Model (HBM), (2). trust in the healthcare system, new vaccine platforms and manufacturers, and (3). self-reported health outcomes. METHODS: A population-based, random telephone survey was performed during the peak of the third wave of COVID-19 outbreak (27/07/2020 to 27/08/2020) in Hong Kong. All adults aged &#8805; 18 years were eligible. The survey included sociodemographic details; self-report health conditions; trust scales; and self-reported health outcomes. Multivariable regression analyses were applied to examine independent associations. The primary outcome is the acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine. RESULTS: We conducted 1200 successful telephone interviews (response rate 55%). The overall vaccine acceptance rate after adjustment for population distribution was 37.2% (95% C.I. 34.5-39.9%). The projected acceptance rates exhibited a ""J-shaped"" pattern with age, with higher rates among young adults (18-24 years), then increased linearly with age. Multivariable regression analyses revealed that perceived severity, perceived benefits of the vaccine, cues to action, self-reported health outcomes, and trust in healthcare system or vaccine manufacturers were positive correlates of acceptance; whilst perceived access barriers and harm were negative correlates. Remarkably, perceived susceptibility to infection carried no significant association, whereas recommendation from Government (aOR = 10.2, 95% C.I. 6.54 to 15.9, p < 0.001) was as the strongest driving factor for acceptance. Other key obstacles of acceptance included lack of confidence on newer vaccine platforms (43.4%) and manufacturers without track record (52.2%), which are of particular relevance to the current context. CONCLUSIONS: Governmental recommendation is an important driver, whereas perceived susceptibility is not associated with acceptance of COVID-19 vaccine. These HBM constructs and independent predictors inform evidence-based formulation and implementation of vaccination strategies.","Wong, Martin C S; Wong, Eliza L Y; Huang, Junjie; Cheung, Annie W L; Law, Kevin; Chong, Marc K C; Ng, Rita W Y; Lai, Christopher K C; Boon, Siaw S; Lau, Joseph T F; Chen, Zigui; Chan, Paul K S",Vaccine,293,20

Here, we evaluated the perception of the COVID-19 pandemic among medical professionals in Germany. Methods: A total of n = 2827 medical professionals participated in an online survey between 27 March and 11 April. Results: While most participants stated that Germany was well prepared and rated the measures taken by their employer as positive, subgroup analyses revealed decisive differences. The preventive measures were rated significantly worse by nurses compared to doctors (p < 0.001) and by participants from ambulatory healthcare centres compared to participants from maximum-care hospitals (p < 0.001). Importantly, shortage of protective medical equipment was reported more commonly in the ambulatory sector (p < 0.001) and in East German federal states (p = 0.004). Moreover, the majority of health care professionals (72.4%) reported significant restrictions of daily work routine. Finally, over 60% of medical professionals had concerns regarding their own health, which were more pronounced among female participants (p = 0.024). Conclusion: This survey may indicate starting points on how medical professionals could be supported in carrying out their important activities during the ongoing and future healthcare challenges.","Paffenholz, Pia; Peine, Arne; Hellmich, Martin; Paffenholz, Stella V; Martin, Lukas; Luedde, Mark; Haverkamp, Miriam; Roderburg, Christoph; Marx, Gernot; Heidenreich, Axel; Trautwein, Christian; Luedde, Tom; Loosen, Sven H",Emerg Microbes Infect,293,26

Here, we analyze 45,494 complete SARS-CoV-2 geneome sequences in the world to understand their mutations. Among them, 12,754 sequences are from the United States. Our analysis suggests the presence of four substrains and eleven top mutations in the United States. These eleven top mutations belong to 3 disconnected groups. The first and second groups consisting of 5 and 8 concurrent mutations are prevailing, while the other group with three concurrent mutations gradually fades out. Moreover, we reveal that female immune systems are more active than those of males in responding to SARS-CoV-2 infections. One of the top mutations, 27964C > T-(S24L) on ORF8, has an unusually strong gender dependence. Based on the analysis of all mutations on the spike protein, we uncover that two of four SASR-CoV-2 substrains in the United States become potentially more infectious.","Wang, Rui; Chen, Jiahui; Gao, Kaifu; Hozumi, Yuta; Yin, Changchuan; Wei, Guo-Wei",Commun Biol,293,22

Early work evaluating digital contact tracing omitted important features and heterogeneities of real-world contact patterns influencing contagion dynamics. We fill this gap with a modeling framework informed by empirical high-resolution contact data to analyze the impact of digital contact tracing in the COVID-19 pandemic. We investigate how well contact tracing apps, coupled with the quarantine of identified contacts, can mitigate the spread in real environments. We find that restrictive policies are more effective in containing the epidemic but come at the cost of unnecessary large-scale quarantines. Policy evaluation through their efficiency and cost results in optimized solutions which only consider contacts longer than 15-20 minutes and closer than 2-3 meters to be at risk. Our results show that isolation and tracing can help control re-emerging outbreaks when some conditions are met: (i) a reduction of the reproductive number through masks and physical distance; (ii) a low-delay isolation of infected individuals; (iii) a high compliance. Finally, we observe the inefficacy of a less privacy-preserving tracing involving second order contacts.

We studied the characteristics of HTx recipients from December 20, 2019, to February 25, 2020, in an effort to understand their risk and outcomes. METHODS: All accessible HTx recipients were included in this single-center retrospective study. We collected information on the recipients using a web-based questionnaire as well as the hospital database. RESULTS: We followed 87 HTx recipients (72.4% were men, and the average age was 51 years). A total of 79 recipients resided in Hubei, and 57 recipients had a Wuhan-related history of travel or contact. Most took precautionary measures while in contact with suspicious crowds, and 96.6% of the families and communities undertook prevention and quarantine procedures. Four upper airway infections were reported, and 3 of them tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 (the fourth recovered and was not tested). All cases were mild and successfully recovered after proper treatment. Laboratory results of 47 HTx cases within the last 2 months were extracted. Of these, 21.3% of recipients had pre-existing lymphopenia, and 87.2% of recipients had a therapeutic concentration of tacrolimus (5-12 ng/ml). Liver and kidney insufficiency was seen in 5 and 6 recipients, respectively. CONCLUSION: HTx recipients who practiced appropriate prevention measures had a low rate of infection with SARS-CoV-2 and transition to the associated disease COVID-19.

DESIGN: Tissue samples were tested for SARS-CoV-2 antigen using immunofluorescence and for viral RNA by in situ hybridisation. A set of 387 oropharyngeal swabs that had been submitted for routine respiratory pathogen testing was tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA using reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR. RESULTS: Lung tissue collected post-mortem from cat 1 tested positive for both SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid antigen and RNA. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in an oropharyngeal swab collected from cat 2 that presented with rhinitis and conjunctivitis. High throughput sequencing of the viral genome revealed five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) compared to the nearest UK human SARS-CoV-2 sequence, and this human virus contained eight SNPs compared to the original Wuhan-Hu-1 reference sequence. An analysis of the viral genome of cat 2 together with nine other feline-derived SARS-CoV-2 sequences from around the world revealed no shared cat-specific mutations. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that human-to-cat transmission of SARS-CoV-2 occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK, with the infected cats developing mild or severe respiratory disease. Given the ability of the new coronavirus to infect different species, it will be important to monitor for human-to-cat, cat-to-cat and cat-to-human transmission.","Hosie, Margaret J; Epifano, Ilaria; Herder, Vanessa; Orton, Richard J; Stevenson, Andrew; Johnson, Natasha; MacDonald, Emma; Dunbar, Dawn; McDonald, Michael; Howie, Fiona; Tennant, Bryn; Herrity, Darcy; Da Silva Filipe, Ana; Streicker, Daniel G; Willett, Brian J; Murcia, Pablo R; Jarrett, Ruth F; Robertson, David L; Weir, William",Vet Rec,293,16

It has published also ""best practices"" in which it advises to avoid touching the mask while wearing it. This might be challenging. The purpose of this study was to investigate the frequency of mask-touching behavior in public transportation. Methods: Observational study using data collected in real life. This survey was conducted in subways and local trains of the greater Paris region, France, between May 4th and 25th, 2020. Public Transportation users were covertly observed. Demographic characteristics, type of mask and the main activity were collected by the investigator. The duration of observation, the frequency of touching face mask, hair and the uncovered area of the face were also recorded. Frequency of mask-touching per hour was determined. Results: One hundred eighty two persons were observed. The median of estimated age [1st and 3rd interquartile] was 35 [30;45] years and 87 (48%) were women. One hundred forty three (79%) were wearing surgical mask. The median time of observation was 8 [4;12] minutes. During this period, 87 (48%) persons touched their mask 15 [7.5;30] times per hour of whom only two (8%) have used hydroalcoholic solution to disinfect their hands. Conclusions: Mask touching is frequent and is rarely followed by hand disinfection.

We wondered if the myeloid compartment was affected during Covid-19 and if monocytes and macrophages could be infected by SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: Monocytes and monocyte-derived macrophages from Covid-19 patients and controls were infected with SARS-CoV-2, and extensively investigated with immunofluorescence, viral RNA extraction and quantification, total RNA extraction followed by reverse transcription and q-PCR using specific primers, supernatant cytokines (IL-10, TNF-&#945;, IL-1ß, IFN-ß, TGF-ß1 and IL-6), flow cytometry. The effect of M1- versus M2-type or no polarization prior to infection was assessed. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 efficiently infected monocytes and MDMs but their infection is abortive. Infection was associated with immunoregulatory cytokines secretion and the induction of a macrophagic specific transcriptional program characterized by the upregulation of M2-type molecules. In vitro polarization did not account for permissivity to SARS-CoV-2, since M1- and M2-type MDMs were similarly infected.

Covid-19 has, in its own way, exposed how the existential fear of death can be crippling in its dominance and yet also provoke heroic actions. In the midst of its catastrophic effects for individuals and societies there has also been a demand for some signs of hope that might sustain efforts to find a better future. To read Hebrews in this setting is to be reminded that some of its major themes resonate with the experience of the pandemic’s broad characteristics. It deals with its recipients’ perceived bondage to the fear of death. It claims that this fear has been overcome through the heroic death of Christ, whose pattern of life is to be emulated in the heroism of his followers. It sets these topics within an overall message of hope, in which God’s action in the exalted Christ is seen as both a ‘word against death’ and the promise of a better world. The article explores further the potential appropriation for present-day readers of Hebrews’ treatment of each of these topics—fear of death, heroism and hope.","Lincoln, Andrew T.",Expos.

Methods: Patients with esophageal-gastric variceal bleeding who received TIPS treatment (ePTFE covered stent) or gastroscopy for the first time as the secondary prevention for portal hypertension at Nanfang Hospital of Southern Medical University through March to July 2017 were selected. One year after the operation, liver function changes, ascites remission rates, incidence of hepatic encephalopathy, re-bleeding rate, average hospitalization frequency and expenses, survival time, as well as the TIPS patency conditions were analyzed in the two groups of patients. 2 test, Kaplan-Meier method and Mann-Whitney U test were used to analyze the data. Results: There were 74 and 66 cases in the TIPS and the drug combined gastroscopy group and the follow-up duration (14.57 ± 0.79) was 12-16 months. One year after surgery, the remission rate of ascites in the TIPS group was higher 57.1% (32/56) than that of the drug combined gastroscopy group (0), and the difference was statistically significant (&#967;(2) = 2 = 36.73, P < 0.01). The cumulative incidence of hepatic encephalopathy at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after surgery in the TIPS group was 32.4% (24/74), 37.8% (28/74), 40.5% (30/74), and 40.5% (30/74), respectively. The cumulative incidence of hepatic encephalopathy in the drug combined gastroscopy group was 3.0% (2/66), 3.0% (2/66), 3.0% (2/66), and 6.1% (4/66), respectively. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the cumulative incidence of hepatic encephalopathy in the TIPS group was higher than that of the drug combined gastroscopy group (&#967;(2) = 11.29, P < 0.01). The incidence of severe hepatic encephalopathy ( grade III to IV) at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after surgery in the TIPS group was 2.7% (2/74), 0, 0, and 0, respectively. The incidence of severe hepatic encephalopathy in drug combined gastroscopy group was 0, and there was no statistically significant difference in development of hepatic encephalopathy between the two groups (P > 0.05). The re-bleeding rates of TIPS group and drug combined gastroscopy group were 0 and 27.3% (18/66), respectively, and the difference was statistically significant (&#967;(2) = 22.42, P < 0.01). There was no death reported during the follow-up period between both groups. The hospitalization frequency times (1.45 ± 0.80) in TIPS group was lower than that of the drug combined gastroscopy group times (3.24 ± 1.80), and the difference was statistically significant (U = -4.52, P < 0.01). Conclusion: In the prevention of esophageal-gastric variceal bleeding, TIPS (ePTFE-covered stent) treatment has the advantages of reducing re-bleeding rate, high ascites remission rate and hospitalizations frequency. In addition, patients treated with TIPS have a higher incidence of hepatic encephalopathy than that of drugs combined with gastroscopy. However, TIPS did not exacerbate the incidence of hepatic encephalopathy, and there was no significant difference in the 1-year survival rate after TIPS and drugs combined with gastroscopy treatment.","Lin, Z P; Chen, S L; Wang, J Y; Liu, F; Tan, Q; Peng, Q F; Zhao, J B",Zhonghua Gan Zang Bing Za Zhi,293,20

Numerous issues for controlling infection have arisen from public discussion led by medical professionals. Yet understanding of these factors has been necessarily qualitative and control measures to correct unfavorable trends specific to an infection area have been lacking. The logical implement for control is a large scale stochastic model with countless parameters lacking robustness and requiring enormous data. This paper presents a remedy for this vexing problem by proposing an alternative approach. Machine learning has come to play a widely circulated role in the study of complex data in recent times. We demonstrate that when machine learning is employed together with the mechanistic framework of a mathematical model, there can be a considerably enhanced understanding of complex systems. A mathematical model describing the viral infection dynamics reveals two transmissibility parameters influenced by the management strategies in the area for the control of the current pandemic. Both parameters readily yield the peak infection rate and means for flattening the curve, which is correlated to different management strategies by employing machine learning, enabling comparison of different strategies and suggesting timely alterations. Treatment of population data with the model shows that restricted non-essential business closure, school closing and strictures on mass gathering influence the spread of infection. While a rational strategy for initiation of an economic reboot would call for a wider perspective of the local economics, the model can speculate on its timing based on the status of the infection as reflected by its potential for an unacceptably renewed viral onslaught.","Wang, Shiyan; Ramkrishna, Doraiswami",Sci Rep,293,20

The present study explored the associative link between coronavirus anxieties, fear of death, and participants' well-being. Results , using structural equation modeling, found that increased mortality concerns stemming from COVID-19 were associated with heightened benefit finding (e.g., relationship investment, gratefulness, patience) from the pandemic. Increased benefit finding, in turn, was related to higher life satisfaction, meaning in life, self-esteem, resilience, and vitality while also correlating negatively with depression and stress scores. There was no evidence for reverse mediation in that fear of mortality did not predict well-being through coronavirus worries. Overall, although many persons have experienced mental health concerns (e.g., fear, stress) as a function of the COVID-19 pandemic, our findings demonstrate positive benefits that paradoxically follow in terms of an increased appreciation of life, improved relationships, and better health.","Cox, C.

This has led to an ever-growing need for caregiving. Previous literature has shown that caregivers face problems of isolation and loneliness. However, many health organizations mainly focus their efforts on in-person community groups that require participants to meet physically. This is not always convenient or accessible for caregivers who are often juggling caring for their care recipient with family and work responsibilities. Objective: With medical advancements such as the proliferation of mobile phones and internet technology, caregivers may have opportunities for easier access to resources and support. Technological innovations could help empower the caregiving community to seek assistance for improving their quality of life at their convenience. A community network app called Caregivers’ Circle was conceptualized in response to the needs of the caregivers on a day-to-day caregiving journey. This paper traces the predevelopment inquiry and technical details of this app to provide a clear understanding of its implementation along with a usability study to gauge user opinion of the app within Singapore. Methods: A predevelopment survey was conducted to identify specific needs of caregivers and gaps in the currently available web-based community networks. The survey consisted of questions on demographical data, health-related issues of the care recipient, mental and physical health–related issues of the caregiver, digital media use, information seeking, and support. This pre–app development survey was completed by 103 caregivers. Qualitative enquiries were also conducted with caregivers within Singapore to identify issues related to caregiving, support provided, and what caregivers would want from a caregiving mobile app. Results: From the feedback garnered from the caregivers, the developers were able to identify several caregivers’ needs and gaps within the current support networks. This feedback was integrated into the mobile app called Caregivers’ Circle upon development. The features of this app include a public forum for community discussions, a marketplace to buy and sell items, care groups to hold private discussions with friends or other users of the app, and a friends feature to search and add new caregiving friends. Conclusions: In general, the caregivers liked the Caregivers’ Circle app and were confident that this app could help them have a better quality of life. The Caregivers’ Circle app is unique in its integrated approach. The integration of many features that caregivers need on a daily basis into an easy app can save their time as well as help them navigate their life smoothly.","Lwin, May O.; Sheldenkar, Anita Panchapakesan Chitra",JMIR Nursing,293,24

It is important to prioritize mental health during crisis events to mitigate the negative and often long-term effects of the crises on young people, families, and society. Mental health and well-being apps represent a scalable approach for improving psychological outcomes in young people and have potential to improve the equity of service access. OBJECTIVE: The Whitu: 7 Ways in 7 Days well-being app was recently developed by our group to address the urgent need for innovative approaches to reach young New Zealanders who are struggling to cope with the COVID-19 pandemic. The aim of this study is twofold: to evaluate the acceptability of the prototype app and to examine the effectiveness of the refined app at improving mental and emotional well-being and reducing depression, anxiety, and stress in young people in New Zealand. METHODS: A two-phase mixed methods study will be undertaken to achieve these aims. During the first phase, 20 young people aged 16-30 years (including those of Maori and Pacific ethnicity) will participate in a qualitative study to help refine the prototype app. During the second phase, 90 young people aged 16-30 years will participate in a randomized waitlist-controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate the efficacy of the refined Whitu app at 4 weeks and 3 months after baseline. Outcomes will be evaluated using validated web-based questionnaires at baseline, 4 weeks, and 3 months. RESULTS: The study received ethics approval in May 2020, and recruitment for the focus groups commenced in June 2020. Recruitment for the RCT is expected to commence in October 2020. Participants for both study phases will be recruited via social media and web-based communities. Data collection for the RCT is expected to be completed by January 2021, and analyses are expected to be completed by March 2021. Linear mixed modelling will be used to determine between-group differences in psychological outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: There is an urgent need to develop culturally appropriate, scalable mental health interventions to address the psychological consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. In this study, we will develop and test an evidence-based well-being app that, if effective, can be made available to all young people in New Zealand and internationally.

BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has caused disruption to contemporary health service delivery, including alcohol and other drug treatment. Provisional research on drug and alcohol consumption patterns shows changes attributable to the pandemic, with implications for service delivery. Research also indicates the impact of the pandemic on healthcare staff is significant, leading to workforce challenges that threaten care provision. DESIGN: Qualitative descriptive study design. METHODS: Data were collected using semi-structured, individual telephone interviews with practising alcohol and other drug nurses from Australia and New Zealand (n = 19). COREQ reporting guidelines were used. RESULTS: After thematic analysis, three key themes emerged: 'No room at the inn: Changes to service delivery due to COVID-19', 'We are providing care to a very vulnerable group of people: Consumer factors during COVID-19' and 'Personally, we were very, very stressed: Workforce factors due to COVID-19'. CONCLUSIONS: The findings from this study indicate that the impact of the pandemic was felt by alcohol and other drug nurses, services and healthcare consumers alike. The experiences of alcohol and other drug nurses through the COVID-19 pandemic need further exploration both to ensure workforce sustainability and that disruptions to alcohol and other drug services do not occur in future outbreaks of communicable disease. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: COVID-19 has had a profound effect on nurses in all settings, and these effects are likely to be felt for some time after the pandemic: nursing specialties require support to ensure ongoing workforce sustainability and well-being of nursing staff. All nurses need to be aware of changes to alcohol and other drug use during the pandemic and screen healthcare consumers accordingly.","Searby, Adam; Burr, Dianna",J. clin. nurs,293,20

The coagulopathy and cerebral hemorrhage have been recently reported in these patients. Prolonged acetaminophen use increases the international normalized ratio (INR) and the risk of bleeding among patients taking anti-coagulants. Inhibition of vitamin K epoxide reductase (VKOR) by acetaminophen and NAC in chronic applications has been reported, however, detailed knowledge of the molecular mechanism and binding sites are not clear. Herein, we built the homology model of human VKOR (hVKOR) using ITASSER server, confirmed, and applied it for docking analysis of its interaction with acetaminophen and its metabolite, N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI), and NAC. We also calculated the lipophilicity and predicted the blood-brain-barrier (BBB) permeation of NAPQI by Swiss ADME. Our analysis showed that NAPQI and NAC, but not acetaminophen, bind strongly to the similar sites in hVKOR via both hydrogen and van der Waals bonding; particularly with Cys135. Thus, it interrupted the vitamin K reducing electron transfer pathway. Further, molecular dynamic (MD) simulation study revealed that the interactions of the ligands with hVKOR are stable. In conclusion, our analysis shed a light on the molecular mechanism of acetaminophen-induced coagulopathy previously reported in some clinical cases with chronic acetaminophen use. Furthermore, considering the anti-coagulopathy of NAPQI and NAC but not acetaminophen, the BBB permeation potency of these agents, and the risk of coagulopathy in COVID-19, we suggest a regular prothrombin time (PT) and INR monitoring of these patients taking acetaminophen and/or NAC.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

How different is it from other coronaviruses? Will it be attenuated or become more virulent? Which animals may be its original host? In this study, we analyzed 377 publicly available complete genome sequences for the COVID-19 virus, the previously known flu-causing coronaviruses (HCov-229E, HCov-OC43, HCov-NL63 and HCov-HKU1) and the lethal, pathogenic P3/P4 viruses, SARS, MERS, Victoria, Lassa, Yamagata, Ebola, and Dengue. We found strong similarities between the current circulating COVID-19 and SARS and MERS, as well as COVID-19 in rhinolophines and pangolins. On the contrary, COVID-19 shares little similarity with the flu-causing coronaviruses and the other P3/P4 viruses. Strikingly, we observed divergence of COVID-19 strains isolated from human hosts has steadily increased from December 2019 to March 2020, suggesting COVID-19 is actively evolving in human hosts. From all existing human COVID-19 genome sequences, we calculated the first common model that represents the shared sequences of the human COVID-19 strains, which provides important information for vaccine and antibody development. Geographic and time-course analysis of the evolutionary trees of the human COVID-19 reveals possibly heterogeneous evolutional paths among strains from 21 countries. This finding has important implications to the management of COVID-19 and the development of vaccines.","Li, Yanni; Liu, Bing; Cui, Jiangtao; Wang, Zhi; Shen, Yulong; Xu, Yueshen; Yao, Kaicheng; Guan, Yuanfang",,293,16

The approach, the diagnosis and management can be changed in the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic era. This review has focused on: i) the current understanding of digestive involvement in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infected children and adolescents and the clinical implications of COVID-19 for pediatric gastroenterologists, ii) the impact of COVID-19 on the clinical approach to patients with pre-existing or onset diseases, including diagnosis and treatment, and iii) the role and limited access to the instrumental diagnosis such as digestive endoscopy. To date, it is unclear if immunosuppression in patients with IBD and chronic liver disease represents a risk factor for adverse outcomes. Scheduled outpatient follow-up visits may be postponed, especially in patients in remission. Conversely, telemedicine services are strongly recommended. The introduction of new therapeutic regimens should be made on an individual basis, discussing the benefits and risks with each patient. Furthermore, psychological care in all children with chronic disease and their parents should be ensured. All non-urgent and elective endoscopic procedures may be postponed as they must be considered at high risk of viral transmission. Finally, until SARS-CoV-2 vaccination is not available, strict adherence to standard social distancing protocols and the use of personal protective equipment should continue to be recommended.","Dipasquale, Valeria; Passanisi, Stefano; Cucinotta, Ugo; Cascio, Antonio; Romano, Claudio",Ital J Pediatr,293,16

Methods: Here we describe the phenotypic and functional characteristics of B and T cells in hospitalised COVID-19 patients during acute disease and at 3-6 months of convalescence. Findings: We report that the alterations in B cell subsets observed in acute COVID-19 patients were largely recovered in convalescent patients. In contrast, T cells from convalescent patients displayed continued alterations with persistence of a cytotoxic programme evident in CD8+ T cells as well as elevated production of type-1 cytokines and IL-17. Interestingly, B cells from patients with acute COVID-19 displayed an IL-6/IL-10 cytokine imbalance in response to toll-like receptor activation, skewed towards a pro-inflammatory phenotype. Whereas the frequency of IL-6+ B cells was restored in convalescent patients irrespective of clinical outcome, recovery of IL-10+ B cells was associated with resolution of lung pathology. Conclusions: Our data detail lymphocyte alterations in previously hospitalized COVID-19 patients up to 6 months following hospital discharge and identify 3 subgroups of convalescent patients based on distinct lymphocyte phenotypes, with one subgroup associated with poorer clinical outcome. We propose that alterations in B and T cell function following hospitalisation with COVID-19 could impact longer term immunity and contribute to some persistent symptoms observed in convalescent COVID-19 patients.

During August 10-September 11, 2020, we recruited 2,214 participants for a representative household-based cross-sectional serosurvey in Juba, South Sudan. We found 22.3% of participants had severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) receptor binding domain IgG titers above prepandemic levels. After accounting for waning antibody levels, age, and sex, we estimated that 38.3% (95% credible interval 31.8%-46.5%) of the population had been infected with SARS-CoV-2. At this rate, for each PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection reported by the Ministry of Health, 103 (95% credible interval 86-126) infections would have been unreported, meaning SARS-CoV-2 has likely spread extensively within Juba. We also found differences in background reactivity in Juba compared with Boston, Massachusetts, USA, where the immunoassay was validated. Our findings underscore the need to validate serologic tests in sub-Saharan Africa populations.","Wiens, Kirsten E; Mawien, Pinyi Nyimol; Rumunu, John; Slater, Damien; Jones, Forrest K; Moheed, Serina; Caflisch, Andrea; Bior, Bior K; Jacob, Iboyi Amanya; Lako, Richard Lino; Guyo, Argata Guracha; Olu, Olushayo Oluseun; Maleghemi, Sylvester; Baguma, Andrew; Hassen, Juma John; Baya, Sheila K; Deng, Lul; Lessler, Justin; Demby, Maya N; Sanchez, Vanessa; Mills, Rachel; Fraser, Clare; Charles, Richelle C; Harris, Jason B; Azman, Andrew S; Wamala, Joseph F",Emerg Infect Dis,293,5

SARS-CoV-2 was initially hypothesized as the etiologic agent of CLL, but, since nasopharyngeal swabs seldom resulted positive, dermatologists' attention focused on the search for specific SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Many papers were published contemporarily on this topic, reporting limited case series. We reviewed the English literature up to the first July 2020 and, excluding single case reports, we considered 13 studies that serologically investigated 220 patients. The presence of specific antibodies was detected in 18 subjects (8.2%): isolated IgA were found in 6 patients, IgA and IgG in 1, isolated IgG in 5, and IgM in 2. In 4 patients, isotypes were not specified. Our review demonstrated a high prevalence of negative serological results in CLL: antibodies were observed only in a few patients, that are even less excluding those with positive IgA, not clearly involved in the pathogenesis of the disease. In conclusion, although it is still uncertain whether CLL are related to SARS-CoV-2 infection, patients affected by CLL seem not to be prone to shedding the virus, hence, if they are asymptomatic, we can reassure them, thus avoiding hospital referral.","Balestri, Riccardo; Magnano, Michela; Rizzoli, Laura; Rech, Giulia",Dermatol Ther,293,14

However, instruments for measuring outcomes of psychosocial interventions designed to promote well-being in dementia are often derived from a symptom-focused, loss/deficit approach, or from broad quality of life concepts. A pan-European dementia working group called for research on the development of an alternative asset/strengths-based conceptual framework of well-being in dementia. This paper takes forward this recommendation by developing such a framework and using this to map relevant self-report outcome measures. METHODS: Three scoping reviews of published studies were conducted iteratively. First, we examined the literature on lived experiences of well-being and quality of life in people with dementia and then the wider dementia literature for application of well-being constructs. The synthesised findings generated conceptual domains of well-being in people with dementia. Corresponding self-report instruments used in dementia research were scoped, categorised within the conceptual framework and their potential value in measuring outcomes for people with dementia was examined. FINDINGS: Six conceptual domains for the measurement of well-being and 35 self-report instruments that have been used with people with dementia were identified. Six instruments were developed specifically for people with dementia, five were derived from the gerontological literature and 24 from the well-being literature. Fifteen instruments and one sub-scale have been examined for psychometric properties amongst people with dementia. To date, 20 have been used as outcome measures, with seven measuring change over time. A number of identified instruments utilise traditional retrospective Likert-scaling response formats, limiting their potential for use with some groups of people with dementia. CONCLUSION: An assets/strengths-based framework is presented, outlining structural domains for selecting self-report measures of well-being in people with dementia. It provides a foundation for enhancing research into processes and outcomes of psychosocial interventions, including instrument development, more precise matching of intervention aims with outcome measurement, and newer technology-based 'in-the-moment' measurement.","Clarke, Chris; Woods, Bob; Moniz-Cook, Esme; Mountain, Gail; Øksnebjerg, Laila; Chattat, Rabih; Diaz, Ana; Gove, Dianne; Vernooij-Dassen, Myrra; Wolverson, Emma",Health Qual Life Outcomes,293,14

This study investigates the effects of such delays in the delivery of cross-linking services in patients with keratoconus progression. METHODS: Retrospective observational study of 46 patients with keratoconus progression, whose cross-linking was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Demographic and clinical details were obtained from assessments on the day of listing, and subsequent review on the day of the procedure. Topographic indices included keratometry of the posterior and anterior corneal surface, maximum keratometry (Kmax), thinnest corneal thickness, ABCD progression and progression based on standard criteria recommendations (1.5 D Kmax & 20 microns thinning). RESULTS: A total of 46 eyes were analysed with an average time between being listed for CXL and having the procedure done was 182 ± 65 days. The delay due to COVID-19 was of 3 months. In this time period they had a significant worsening of all keratometric indices and lost almost one line of visual acuity (0.19 ± 0.19 to 0.26 ± 0.18 LogMAR, p: 0.03). Thirty two eyes (70%) demonstrated progression in accordance with the ABCD progression criteria, while 18 eyes (39%) showed either an increase in Kmax of more than 1.5D or a thinning in corneal thickness of at least 20 µm. CONCLUSIONS: The treatment delay for the keratoconus patients caused further progression and vision worsening. We recommend that corneal collagen crosslinking needs to be considered as a high priority intervention.","Shah, Haider; Pagano, Luca; Vakharia, Anuj; Coco, Giulia; Gadhvi, Kunal A; Kaye, Stephen B; Romano, Vito",Eur J Ophthalmol,293,29

COVID-19 largely exhibits mild to moderate clinical manifestations. However, severe pneumonia with high fatality rate may occur, especially in the elderly and in patients with underlying conditions, such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease. SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) binds to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a ubiquitous trans-membrane carboxypeptidase, to enter the cells. AIMS: This short review discusses some open questions about the link between COVID-19 and diabetes, principally focusing on the possible effects of commonly used drugs in patients with diabetes. RESULTS: Preclinical studies have reported that angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and ACE inhibitors might increase ACE2 expression in several cell types. Hence, it has been speculated that the treatment with these agents might influence the course of the infection, and both harmful and beneficial effects have been supposed. Other pharmacological agents are thought to increase ACE2 expression, including statins and proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-Î³) agonists. All these drug classes are broadly adopted in T2D. Besides ACE2, other unknown co-factors might be involved in cell infection. It has been recently observed that dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4), the receptor for MERS-CoV (Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus) and ACE2 have similar expression profiles in the lung. DPP4 has important metabolic and immune functions and is a target for commonly used therapies in T2D. CONCLUSIONS: Although clinical data supporting an influence of all these drugs on the course of the disease are limited, this is an interesting background for further research that might help unravel the complex mechanisms underlying the link between COVID-19 and diabetes.","Filardi, T; Morano, S",J Endocrinol Invest,293,24

Two of the foremost bioactive factors, bone morphogenetic protein-2 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), are widely applied using a ceramic scaffold. The aim of this study was to determine the use of hydroxyapatite microcarrier (MC) for dual delivery of osteogenic and angiogenic factors to accelerate hard tissue regeneration during the regenerative process. METHODS: Two MCs of different sizes were fabricated by emulsification of gelatin and alpha-tricalcium phosphate (&#945;-TCP). The experimental group was divided based on the combination of MC size and growth factors. For investigating the in vitro properties, rat mesenchymal stem cells (rMSCs) were harvested from bone marrow of the femur and tibia. For in vivo experiments, MC with/without growth factors was applied into the standardized, 5-mm diameter defects, which were made bilaterally on the parietal bone of the rat. The animals were allowed to heal for 8 weeks, and samples were harvested and analyzed by micro-computed tomography and histology. RESULTS: Improved proliferation of rat mesenchymal stem cells was observed with VEGF loaded MC. For osteogenic differentiation, dual growth factors delivered by MC showed higher osteogenic gene expression, alkaline phosphatse production and calcium deposition. The in vivo results revealed statistically significant increase in new bone formation when dual growth factors were delivered by MC. Dual growth factors administered on a calcium phosphate matrix showed significantly enhanced osteogenic potential. CONCLUSION: We propose this system has potential clinical utility in providing solutions for craniofacial bone defects, with the added benefit of early availability.","Kim, Tae-Woo; Ahn, Woo-Beom; Kim, Joong-Min; Kim, Joong-Hyun; Kim, Tae-Hyun; Perez, Roman A; Jang, Hyon-Seok",,293,4

Many patients with rare diseases also suffer from mental retardation and disability. These rare disease phenotypes do not emerge in older people who are susceptible to COVID-19 infection, but present at a very young age or at birth. These factors must be taken in consideration when caring for this vulnerable patient population during a pandemic, such as COVID-19. Patients with a rare disease have to take their regular medication continuously to control their condition and frequently, the medications, directly or indirectly, affect their immune system. It is important for this patient population, if infected with COVID-19 or another severe form of infection, to adjust the treatment protocol by specialists, in consultation with their own medical team. Special awareness and educational programs, understandable for mentally retarded patients, must be developed to educate them about social distancing, curfew, sanitization, and sensitization to the disease and quarantine.

Recent studies have shown that patients with COVID-19 experience relevant gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms. We aimed to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis on the GI symptoms of COVID-19. METHODS: A literature search was conducted via electronic databases, including PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Google Scholar, from inception until 20 March 2020. Data were extracted from relevant studies. A systematic review of GI symptoms and a meta-analysis comparing symptoms in severe and non-severe patients was performed using RevMan V.5.3. RESULTS: Pooled data from 2477 patients with a reverse transcription-PCR-positive COVID-19 infection across 17 studies were analysed. Our study revealed that diarrhoea (7.8%) followed by nausea and/or vomiting (5.5 %) were the most common GI symptoms. We performed a meta-analysis comparing the odds of having GI symptoms in severe versus non-severe COVID-19-positive patients. 4 studies for nausea and/or vomiting, 5 studies for diarrhoea and 3 studies for abdominal pain were used for the analyses. There was no significant difference in the incidence of diarrhoea (OR=1.32, 95% CI 0.8 to 2.18, Z=1.07, p=0.28, I2=17%) or nausea and/or vomiting (OR=0.96, 95% CI 0.42 to 2.19, Z=0.10, p=0.92, I2=55%) between either group. However, there was seven times higher odds of having abdominal pain in patients with severe illness when compared with non-severe patients (OR=7.17, 95% CI 1.95 to 26.34, Z=2.97, p=0.003, I2=0%). CONCLUSION: Our study has reiterated that GI symptoms are an important clinical feature of COVID-19. Patients with severe disease are more likely to have abdominal pain as compared with patients with non-severe disease.","Suresh Kumar, Vishnu Charan; Mukherjee, Samiran; Harne, Prateek Suresh; Subedi, Abinash; Ganapathy, Muthu Kuzhali; Patthipati, Venkata Suresh; Sapkota, Bishnu",,293,20

Details regarding the safety and use of tracheostomy in treating COVID-19 continue to evolve. Objective: To evaluate the association of tracheostomy with COVID-19 patient outcomes and the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission among health care professionals (HCPs). Data Sources: EMBASE (Ovid), Medline (Ovid), and Web of Science from January 1, 2020, to March 4, 2021. Study Selection: English-language studies investigating patients with COVID-19 who were receiving IMV and undergoing tracheostomy. Observational and randomized clinical trials were eligible (no randomized clinical trials were found in the search). All screening was performed by 2 reviewers (P.S. and M.L.). Overall, 156 studies underwent full-text review. Data Extraction and Synthesis: We performed data extraction in accordance with Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology guidelines. We used a random-effects model, and ROBINS-I was used for the risk-of-bias analysis. Main Outcomes and Measures: SARS-CoV-2 transmission between HCPs and levels of personal protective equipment, in addition to complications, time to decannulation, ventilation weaning, and intensive care unit (ICU) discharge in patients with COVID-19 who underwent tracheostomy. Results: Of the 156 studies that underwent full-text review, only 69 were included in the qualitative synthesis, and 14 of these 69 studies (20.3%) were included in the meta-analysis. A total of 4669 patients were included in the 69 studies, and the mean (range) patient age across studies was 60.7 (49.1-68.8) years (43 studies [62.3%] with 1856 patients). We found that in all studies, 1854 patients (73.8%) were men and 658 (26.2%) were women. We found that 28 studies (40.6%) investigated either surgical tracheostomy or percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy. Overall, 3 of 58 studies (5.17%) identified a small subset of HCPs who developed COVID-19 that was associated with tracheostomy. Studies did not consistently report the number of HCPs involved in tracheostomy. Among the patients, early tracheostomy was associated with faster ICU discharge (mean difference, 6.17 days; 95% CI, -11.30 to -1.30), but no change in IMV weaning (mean difference, -2.99 days; 95% CI, -8.32 to 2.33) or decannulation (mean difference, -3.12 days; 95% CI, -7.35 to 1.12). There was no association between mortality or perioperative complications and type of tracheostomy. A risk-of-bias evaluation that used ROBINS-I demonstrated notable bias in the confounder and patient selection domains because of a lack of randomization and cohort matching. There was notable heterogeneity in study reporting. Conclusions and Relevance: The findings of this systematic review and meta-analysis indicate that enhanced personal protective equipment is associated with low rates of SARS-CoV-2 transmission during tracheostomy. Early tracheostomy in patients with COVID-19 may reduce ICU stay, but this finding is limited by the observational nature of the included studies.","Staibano, Phillip; Levin, Marc; McHugh, Tobial; Gupta, Michael; Sommer, Doron D",JAMA otolaryngol.-- head neck surg.

The pandemic is historic in scope and precedent given its emergence in an increasingly digital era. Importantly, there have been concerns about the accuracy of COVID-19 case counts due to issues such as lack of access to testing and difficulty in measuring recoveries. OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study were to detect and characterize user-generated conversations that could be associated with COVID-19-related symptoms, experiences with access to testing, and mentions of disease recovery using an unsupervised machine learning approach. METHODS: Tweets were collected from the Twitter public streaming application programming interface from March 3-20, 2020, filtered for general COVID-19-related keywords and then further filtered for terms that could be related to COVID-19 symptoms as self-reported by users. Tweets were analyzed using an unsupervised machine learning approach called the biterm topic model (BTM), where groups of tweets containing the same word-related themes were separated into topic clusters that included conversations about symptoms, testing, and recovery. Tweets in these clusters were then extracted and manually annotated for content analysis and assessed for their statistical and geographic characteristics. RESULTS: A total of 4,492,954 tweets were collected that contained terms that could be related to COVID-19 symptoms. After using BTM to identify relevant topic clusters and removing duplicate tweets, we identified a total of 3465 (<1%) tweets that included user-generated conversations about experiences that users associated with possible COVID-19 symptoms and other disease experiences. These tweets were grouped into five main categories including first- and secondhand reports of symptoms, symptom reporting concurrent with lack of testing, discussion of recovery, confirmation of negative COVID-19 diagnosis after receiving testing, and users recalling symptoms and questioning whether they might have been previously infected with COVID-19. The co-occurrence of tweets for these themes was statistically significant for users reporting symptoms with a lack of testing and with a discussion of recovery. A total of 63% (n=1112) of the geotagged tweets were located in the United States. CONCLUSIONS: This study used unsupervised machine learning for the purposes of characterizing self-reporting of symptoms, experiences with testing, and mentions of recovery related to COVID-19. Many users reported symptoms they thought were related to COVID-19, but they were not able to get tested to confirm their concerns. In the absence of testing availability and confirmation, accurate case estimations for this period of the outbreak may never be known. Future studies should continue to explore the utility of infoveillance approaches to estimate COVID-19 disease severity.","Mackey, Tim; Purushothaman, Vidya; Li, Jiawei; Shah, Neal; Nali, Matthew; Bardier, Cortni; Liang, Bryan; Cai, Mingxiang; Cuomo, Raphael",JMIR Public Health Surveill,293,20

We verify the nonnegativity and boundedness of its solutions. We outline all possible equilibrium points of the proposed model. We prove the global stability of equilibria by constructing proper Lyapunov functions. We do some numerical simulations to visualize the obtained results. According to our model, lymphopenia in COVID-19 cancer patients may worsen the outcomes of the infection and lead to death.

One surprisingly effective platform for healthcare professionals (HCPs) to share knowledge and experiences from the front lines has been social media (for example, the ""#medtwitter"" community on Twitter). However, identifying clinically-relevant content in social media without manual labeling is a challenge because of the sheer volume of irrelevant data. We present an unsupervised, iterative approach to mine clinically relevant information from social media data, which begins by heuristically filtering for HCP-authored texts and incorporates topic modeling and concept extraction with MetaMap. This approach identifies granular topics and tweets with high clinical relevance from a set of about 52 million COVID-19-related tweets from January to mid-June 2020. We also show that because the technique does not require manual labeling, it can be used to identify emerging topics on a week-to-week basis. Our method can aid in future public-health emergencies by facilitating knowledge transfer among healthcare workers in a rapidly-changing information environment, and by providing an efficient and unsupervised way of highlighting potential areas for clinical research.","Wu, Julia; Sivaraman, Venkatesh; Kumar, Dheekshita; Banda, Juan M; Sontag, David",J Biomed Inform,293,23

The present study was designed to answer to this question. METHODS: The population study was the Covid-Clinic-Toul cohort which records data about all hospitalized patients with a positive reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction for a SARS-CoV-2 infection at Toulouse University hospital, France. Exposure to systemic corticosteroids was assessed at hospital admission. A propensity score (PS) according to corticosteroid exposure was calculated including comorbidities, clinical, radiological and biological variables that impact COVID-19 severity. The primary outcome was composite, including admission to intensive care unit, need of mechanical ventilation and death occurring during the 14 days after hospital admission. Logistic regression models adjusted for the PS (overlap weighting) provided odds ratios (ORs) and their 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). RESULTS: Overall, 253 patients were included in the study. Median age was 64 years, 140 patients (59.6%) were men and 218 (86.2%) had at least one comorbidity. Seventeen patients (6.7%) were exposed to corticosteroids before hospital admission. Chronic inflammatory disease (n = 8) was the most frequent indication. One hundred and twenty patients (47.4%) met the composite outcome. In the crude model, the OR of previous exposure to systemic corticosteroids was 1.64; 95% CI: 0.60-4.44. In the adjusted model, it was 1.09 (95% CI: 0.65-1.83). CONCLUSION: Overall, this study provide some evidences for an absence of an increased risk of unfavorable outcome with previous exposure to corticosteroids in the general setting of patients hospitalized for COVID-19.","Lafaurie, Margaux; Martin-Blondel, Guillaume; Delobel, Pierre; Kamar, Nassim; Charpentier, Sandrine; Sommet, Agnès; Moulis, Guillaume",BMC Pharmacol Toxicol,293,16

In order to identify possible prime target cells of SARS-CoV-2 by comprehensive dissection of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 coexpression pattern in different cell types, five datasets with single-cell transcriptomes of lung, oesophagus, gastric mucosa, ileum and colon were analysed. Design: Five datasets were searched, separately integrated and analysed. Violin plot was used to show the distribution of differentially expressed genes for different clusters. The ACE2-expressing and TMPRRSS2-expressing cells were highlighted and dissected to characterise the composition and proportion. Results: Cell types in each dataset were identified by known markers. ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were not only coexpressed in lung AT2 cells and oesophageal upper epithelial and gland cells but also highly expressed in absorptive enterocytes from the ileum and colon. Additionally, among all the coexpressing cells in the normal digestive system and lung, the expression of ACE2 was relatively highly expressed in the ileum and colon. Conclusion: This study provides the evidence of the potential route of SARS-CoV-2 in the digestive system along with the respiratory tract based on single-cell transcriptomic analysis. This finding may have a significant impact on health policy setting regarding the prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our study also demonstrates a novel method to identify the prime cell types of a virus by the coexpression pattern analysis of single-cell sequencing data.","Zhang, Hao; Kang, Zijian; Gong, Haiyi; Xu, Da; Wang, Jing; Li, Zhixiu; Li, Zifu; Cui, Xinggang; Xiao, Jianru; Zhan, Jian; Meng, Tong; Zhou, Wang; Liu, Jianmin; Xu, Huji",Gut,293,26

Aim: We investigated the impact of PSMA-PET on Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Working Group 3 (PCWG3) clinical subtype classification when compared to conventional imaging (CI). Methods: Multicenter retrospective study enrolling patients with (a) PSMA-PET for CRPC, (b) PSA values &#8805;1 ng/mL and (c) CI, i.e. CT plus bone scan or whole-body MRI. Clinical PCWG3 subtype was determined for PET vs. CI by three blinded readers. Results: 67 patients were included and PSMA-PET led to up-staging in 15% (10/67) of patients, of these 6/10 (60%) had CI non-metastatic CRPC. PSMA-PET resulted in down-staging in 15% (10/67) of patients. Agreement for PET vs. CI PCWG3 clinical subtype was 0.81 vs. 0.51, 0.74 vs. 0.47, 0.95 vs. 0.72, or 0.59 vs. 0.66 for local, nodal, bone, or visceral disease, respectively. Conclusion: PSMA-PET demonstrated major concordance with CI for per-patient PCWG3 clinical subtype and should be implemented in future CRPC clinical trial screening procedures.","Farolfi, Andrea; Hirmas, Nader; Gafita, Andrei; Weber, Manuel; Barbato, Francesco; Wetter, Axel; Mei, Riccardo; Pianori, Davide; Hadaschik, Boris; Herrmann, Ken; Castellucci, Paolo; Fanti, Stefano; Eiber, Matthias; Fendler, Wolfgang P",J. nucl. med,293,1

A volatility index, credit default swap spreads, and foreign exchange rates are used as control variables, with a daily dataset between January 2, 2017, and October 20, 2020. After examining the stationarity and nonlinearity characteristics of the variables, we applied a nonlinear autoregressive distributed lag (NARDL) model and then conducted a Markov switching regression (MSR) for a robustness check. The results reveal that both foreign portfolio flows and monetary responses have an important effect on the index, and foreign portfolio flows have a higher effect than monetary responses. Accordingly, the results obtained from the NARDL and MSR models are robust and consistent.","Kartal, Mustafa Tevfik Ertuğrul Hasan Murat Ulussever Talat",Borsa Istanbul Review,293,16

Many of those critically ill have required days to weeks of supportive mechanical invasive ventilation (MV) as part of their treatment. Previous estimates set the US availability of mechanical ventilators at approximately 62,000 full-featured ventilators, with 98,000 non-full featured devices (including non-invasive devices). Given the limited availability of this resource both in US and in low- and middle-income countries, we provide a framework to approach the shortage of MV resources. Here we discuss evidence and possibilities to reduce overall MV needs, strategies to maximize the availability of MV devices designed for invasive ventilation, the literature underlying methods to create and fashion new sources of potential ventilation that are available to hospitals and front-line providers, and discuss the staffing needs necessary to support MV efforts. The pandemic has already pushed cities like New York and Boston well beyond previous ICU capacity in its first wave. As hotspots continue to develop around the country and the globe, it is evident that issues may arise ahead regarding the efficient and equitable use of resources. This unique challenge may continue to stretch resources and require care beyond previously set capacities and boundaries. The approaches presented here provide a review of the known evidence and strategies for those at the front-line facing this challenge.","Dar, Mohammad; Swamy, Lakshmana; Gavin, Daniel; Theodore, Arthur",Ann.

Split ventilation allows a single ventilator to be used for more than one patient but is not practicable due to requirements for matched patient settings, risks of cross-contamination, harmful interference between patients and the inability to individualize ventilator support parameters. We hypothesized that a system could be developed to circumvent these limitations. METHODS AND FINDINGS: A novel delivery system was developed to allow individualized peak inspiratory pressure settings and PEEP using a pressure regulatory valve, developed de novo, and an inline PEEP 'booster'. One-way valves, filters, monitoring ports and wye splitters were assembled in-line to complete the system and achieve the design targets. This system was then tested to see if previously described limitations could be addressed. The system was investigated in mechanical and animal trials (ultimately with a pig and sheep concurrently ventilated from the same ventilator). The system demonstrated the ability to provide ventilation across clinically relevant scenarios including circuit occlusion, unmatched physiology, and a surgical procedure, while allowing significantly different pressures to be safely delivered to each animal for individualized support. CONCLUSIONS: In settings of limited ventilator availability, systems can be developed to allow increased delivery of ventilator support to patients. This enables more rapid deployment of ventilator capacity under constraints of time, space and financial cost. These systems can be smaller, lighter, more readily stored and more rapidly deployable than ventilators. However, optimizing ventilator support for patients with individualized ventilation parameters will still be dependent upon ease of use and the availability of medical personnel.","VanKoevering, Kyle K; Yalamanchi, Pratyusha; Haring, Catherine T; Phillips, Anne G; Harvey, Stephen Lewis; Rojas-Pena, Alvaro; Zopf, David A; Green, Glenn E",PLoS One,293,1

This study focused on the spatial transmission of the pandemic among the 640 districts in India over time, and aimed to understand the urban-centric nature of the infection. The connectivity context was emphasized that possibly had inflicted the outbreak. Using the modes of transmission data for the available cases, the diffusion of this disease was explained. Metropolitans contributed three-fourths of total cases from the beginning. The transport networks attributed significantly in transmitting the virus from the urban containment zones. Later, there was a gradual shift of infections from urban to rural areas; however, the numbers kept increasing in the former. The massive reverse migration after lockdown spiked the infected cases further. Districts with airports reported more with influx of international passengers. A profound east-west division in April with higher infections in the southern and western districts existed. By mid-May eastern India saw a steep rise in active cases. Moran's I analysis showed a low autocorrelation initially which increased over time. Hotspot clustering was observed in western Maharashtra, eastern Tamil Nadu, Gujarat and around Kolkata by the second week of August. The diffusion was due to travel, exposure to infected individuals and among the frontline workers. Spatial regression models confirmed that urbanization was positively correlated with higher incidences of infections. Transit mediums, especially rail and aviation were positively associated. These models validated the crucial role of spatial proximity in diffusion of the pandemic.","Gupta, Devarupa; Biswas, Dibyendu; Kabiraj, Pintu",GeoJournal,293,21

We first build deterministic models for the problem and then develop the corresponding stochastic programming models to maximize the retailers' expected profit over the planning horizon. The uncertainty of customer demand is represented by scenario trees, and a scenario reduction technique is used to solve the problem when the scenario trees are too large. We conduct numerical tests based on real data crawling from an online store. The results show that the stochastic model outperforms the deterministic model, especially when the retailer is less cash-constrained. Moreover, the retailer tends to choose using order-based loan when its initial available cash is small or facing long receipt delay length.","Chen, Zhen; Zhang, Ren-qian",,293,16

As one of the most important targets for antibody and drug developments, the Spike RBD-ACE2 interface has received extensive attention. Here, using molecular dynamics simulations, we explicitly analyzed the energetic features of the RBD-ACE2 complex of both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. Despite the high structural similarity, the binding strength of SARS-CoV-2 to the ACE2 receptor is estimated to be -16.35 kcal mol-1 stronger than that of SARS-CoV. Energy decomposition analyses identified three binding patches in SARS-CoV-2 RBD and eleven key residues (F486, Y505, N501, Y489, Q493, L455, etc.), which are believed to be the main targets for drug development. The dominating forces arise from van der Waals attractions and dehydration of these residues. Compared with SARS-CoV, we found seven mutational sites (K417, L455, A475, G476, E484, Q498 and V503) on SARS-CoV-2 that unexpectedly weakened the RBD-ACE2 binding. Interestingly, the E484 site is recognized to be the most repulsive residue at the RBD-ACE2 interface, indicating that from the energy point of view, a mutation of E484 would be beneficial to RBD-ACE2 binding. This is in line with recent findings that it is mutated by lysine (E484K mutation) in the rapidly spreading variants of COVID-19 belonging to the B.1.351 and P.1 lineages. In addition, this mutation is reported to cause virus neutralization escapes from highly neutralizing COVID-19 convalescent plasma. Thus, further efforts are required to probe its functional relevance. Overall, our results present a systematic understanding of the energetic binding features of SARS-CoV-2 RBD with the ACE2 receptor, which can provide a valuable insight for the design of SARS-CoV-2 drugs and identification of cross-active antibodies.","Yang, Yanmei; Zhang, Yunju; Qu, Yuanyuan; Zhang, Chao; Liu, Xue-Wei; Zhao, Mingwen; Mu, Yuguang; Li, Weifeng",Nanoscale,293,27

At the peak of the pandemic, many LT services worldwide reduced or halted their activities. With the gradual easing of lockdowns, LT teams face new challenges when restarting activities. The numbers of LTs are likely to drop in the immediate post-COVID era. Prolonged and intermittent lockdowns are likely to lead to a shortage of supplies, especially in poor resource settings. Special attention is needed to avoid nosocomial COVID-19 infection among cirrhotic patients awaiting transplant, post-transplant patients, and members of transplant teams. LT programs may have to revise existing strategies in selecting donors and recipients for transplants. Redesigning service provision, restructuring outpatient care, carefully screening and selecting donors and recipients, and performing LT with limited resources will have to be initiated in the post-COVID era if long-term recovery of LT services is to be expected.

TRIAL DESIGN: Parallel, 2:1 randomization, double blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center trial. PARTICIPANTS: Male and female patients above the age of 64 (i.e. &#8805;65 years of age) with COVID-19 diagnosis confirmed by SARS-CoV2 positive throat swab (PCR). Patients can only be included within 3 days of symptom onset in ambulatory care if they consent to the study procedure and are able to adhere to the study visit schedule and protocol requirements (including telephone visits concerning symptoms and side effects). Severity of disease at inclusion is mild to moderate defined as not requiring hospital admission: SpO2 >94%, respiratory rate <20, mental state alert, no signs of septic shock. Cardiac risk is minimised by requiring a Tisdale score &#8804; 6. Patients are recruited in the two german cities of Ulm and Tübingen in various ambulatory care settings. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Each patient will be given a first dose of 600 mg Hydroxychloroquine or the equivalent number of placebo capsules (3 capsules) at the day of inclusion. From the 2nd day on, each patient will get 200 mg or the equivalent number of placebo capsules twice a day (400mg/day) until day 7 (6 more does of 400 mg); a cumulative dose of 3 g. MAIN OUTCOMES: Rate of hospitalization or death at day 7 after study inclusion RANDOMISATION: All consenting adult patients having confirmed COVID-19 are randomly and blindly allocated in a 2:1 ratio to either IMP or placebo.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the extent of vaccination coverage and intention to vaccinate among college students. College students (N = 457) enrolled in the Spring 2021 semester at a university in New Jersey completed a cross-sectional survey. The survey collected information on demographics, COVID-19 and vaccination history, knowledge levels and sources of COVID-19 vaccine information, and vaccine attitudes. Multivariable regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with vaccination, and the intention to vaccinate among non-vaccinated students. Results indicate that 23% (n = 105) of participants reported being vaccinated already. Among non-vaccinated students, 52.8% indicated their intention to receive the vaccine when it is made available to college students. Students who were health care workers (adjusted odds ratio, aOR = 4.17, p < 0.001), had a family member who had received a COVID-19 vaccine (aOR = 5.03, p < 0.001), exhibited greater positive attitudes regarding vaccination (aOR = 1.12, p < 0.001), and received a seasonal flu vaccine (aOR = 1.97, p < 0.05) were more likely to have received the COVID-19 vaccine. Among non-vaccinated students, those who discussed COVID-19 vaccine information with others (aOR = 5.38, p < 0.001), and exhibited more overall positive attitudes regarding vaccination (aOR = 2.69, p < 0.001), were more likely to indicate their willingness to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. Findings of this study highlight the need for additional education and vaccine outreach aimed at promoting uptake of the COVID-19 vaccine among college students.","Kecojevic, Aleksandar; Basch, Corey H; Sullivan, Marianne; Chen, Yen-Tyng; Davi, Nicole K",J. community health,293,22

The results highlight the complex ways in which family resources intersect with the pandemic to affect these different groups of children. Family economic resources have generally declined across all groups, but left-behind children have suffered the most severe economic shock. However, parent–child relationships for all children have improved across the board during the pandemic. Diminished economic resources act as a risk factor, while improved family relationships play a protective role in children’s psychological well-being. Parent–child relationships have had a more pronounced positive impact on psychological outcomes for migrant and left-behind children, who are the most deprived of parental input under normal circumstances, than for other groups of children. Because of these processes, migrant children and left-behind children fare similarly to urban children in terms of their resilience to the COVID-19 crisis. Among children enjoying especially favorable parent–child relationships, migrant children and left-behind children even appear to have higher psychological well-being than urban children during the pandemic. In comparison to this social impact, the impact of family economic resources is more moderate in magnitude and does not vary systematically across different groups of children. As a result, the positive impact of improved parent–child relationships largely outweighs the adverse effect of reduced family economic resources. Overall, the findings provide new insight into the relationship among disasters, family resources, and child well-being in the context of the COVID-19 crisis in China.

This study is to explore the patient characteristics and transmission chains of COVID-19 in the population of Gansu province, and support decision-making. METHODS: We collected data from Gansu Province National Health Information Platform. A cross-sectional study was conducted, including patients with COVID-19 confirmed between January 23 and February 6, 2020, and analyzed the gender and age of the patients. We also described the incubation period, consultation time and sources of infection in the cases, and calculated the secondary cases that occurred within Gansu for each imported case. RESULTS: We found thirty-six (53.7%) of the patients were women and thirty-one (46.3%) men, and the median ages were 40 (IQR 31-53) years. Twenty-eight (41.8%) of the 67 cases had a history of direct exposure in Wuhan. Twenty-five (52.2%) cases came from ten families, and we found no clear reports of modes of transmission other than family clusters. The largest number of secondary cases linked to a single source was nine. CONCLUSION: More women than men were diagnosed with COVID-19 in Gansu Province. Although the age range of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Gansu Province covered almost all age groups, most patients with confirmed COVID-19 tend to be middle aged persons. The most common suspected mode of transmission was through family cluster. Gansu and other settings worldwide should continue to strengthen the utilization of big data in epidemic control.","Yan, Xuanchen; Wang, Jianjian; Yao, Jingwen; Estill, Janne; Wu, Shouyuan; Lu, Jie; Liang, Baoping; Li, Hongmin; Tao, Shengxin; Bai, Huanli; Liu, Hongliang; Chen, Yaolong",BMC Infect Dis,293,22

This study aims to determine mentee developmental outcomes based on student surveys and discuss these within the context of the relevant teaching and learning methodology. The mentorship was structured around scientific writing projects established by the team using a student-centred approach, with one-on-one expert mentorship through weekly formative assessments. Furthermore, weekly online meetings were conducted, including expert lectures, formative assessments and social engagement. Data were collected through final assessments and mentee surveys on mentorship outcomes. Results show that mentees (n = 28) reported a significant (p < .0001) improvement in all criteria related to the five core pillars.

The pivotal role of immunoglobulins in the host immune response to infection suggests that additional therapy with polyclonal intravenous immunoglobulins may be a promising option in patients with septic shock. Immunoglobulin preparations enriched with the IgM component have largely been used in sepsis, mostly at standard dosages (250 mg/kg per day), regardless of clinical severity and without any dose adjustment based on immunoglobulin serum titres or other biomarkers. We hypothesised that a personalised dose of IgM enriched preparation based on patient IgM titres and aimed to achieve a specific threshold of IgM titre is more effective in decreasing mortality than a standard dose. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The study is designed as a multicentre, interventional, randomised, single-blinded, prospective, investigator sponsored, two-armed study. Patients with septic shock and IgM titres <60 mg/dL will be randomly assigned to an IgM titre-based treatment or a standard treatment group in a ratio of 1:1. The study will involve 12 Italian intensive care units and 356 patients will be enrolled. Patients assigned to the IgM titre-based treatment will receive a personalised daily dose based on an IgM serum titre aimed at achieving serum titres above 100 mg/dL up to discontinuation of vasoactive drugs or day 7 after enrolment. Patients assigned to the IgM standard treatment group will receive IgM enriched preparation daily for three consecutive days at the standard dose of 250 mg/kg. The primary endpoint will be all-cause mortality at 28 days. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study protocol was approved by the ethics committees of the coordinating centre (Comitato Etico dell'Area Vasta Emilia Nord) and collaborating centres. The results of the trial will be published within 12 months from the end of the study and the steering committee has the right to present them at public symposia and conferences. TRIAL REGISTRATION DETAILS: The trial protocol and information documents have received a favourable opinion from the Area Vasta Emilia Nord Ethical Committee on 12 September 2019.

The COVID-19 epidemic catalyzed the expansion of online health care services. In recent years, internet hospitals have been rapidly developed. Ping An Good Doctor is the largest, national online medical entry point in China and is a widely used platform providing online health care services. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to give a comprehensive description of the characteristics of the online consultations and inquisitions in Ping An Good Doctor. The analyses tried to answer the following questions: (1) What are the characteristics of the consultations in Ping An Good Doctor in terms of department and disease profiles? (2) Who uses the online health services most frequently? and (3) How is the user experience of the online consultations of Ping An Good Doctor? METHODS: A total of 35.3 million consultations and inquisitions over the course of 1 year were analyzed with respect to the distributions of departments and diseases, user profiles, and consulting behaviors. RESULTS: The geographical distribution of the usage of Ping An Good Doctor showed that Shandong (18.4%), Yunnan (15.6%), Shaanxi (7.2%), and Guangdong (5.5%) were the provinces that used it the most; they accounted for 46.6% of the total consultations and inquisitions. In terms of department distribution, we found that gynecology and obstetrics (19.2%), dermatology (17.0%), and pediatrics (14.4%) were the top three departments in Ping An Good Doctor. The disease distribution analysis showed that, except for nondisease-specific consultations, acute upper respiratory infection (AURI) (4.1%), pregnancy (2.8%), and dermatitis (2.4%) were the most frequently consulted diseases.

The COVID-19 epidemic catalyzed the expansion of online health care services. In recent years, internet hospitals have been rapidly developed. Ping An Good Doctor is the largest, national online medical entry point in China and is a widely used platform providing online health care services. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to give a comprehensive description of the characteristics of the online consultations and inquisitions in Ping An Good Doctor. The analyses tried to answer the following questions: (1) What are the characteristics of the consultations in Ping An Good Doctor in terms of department and disease profiles? (2) Who uses the online health services most frequently? and (3) How is the user experience of the online consultations of Ping An Good Doctor? METHODS: A total of 35.3 million consultations and inquisitions over the course of 1 year were analyzed with respect to the distributions of departments and diseases, user profiles, and consulting behaviors. RESULTS: The geographical distribution of the usage of Ping An Good Doctor showed that Shandong (18.4%), Yunnan (15.6%), Shaanxi (7.2%), and Guangdong (5.5%) were the provinces that used it the most; they accounted for 46.6% of the total consultations and inquisitions. In terms of department distribution, we found that gynecology and obstetrics (19.2%), dermatology (17.0%), and pediatrics (14.4%) were the top three departments in Ping An Good Doctor. The disease distribution analysis showed that, except for nondisease-specific consultations, acute upper respiratory infection (AURI) (4.1%), pregnancy (2.8%), and dermatitis (2.4%) were the most frequently consulted diseases.

The plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) is considered the gold standard for measuring serum neutralizing antibodies but requires high level biosafety, live viral cultures and days to complete. We hypothesized that competitive enzyme linked immunoassays (ELISAs) based on SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins receptor binding domain (RBD) attachment to its host receptor, the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 receptor (ACE2r), would correlate with PRNT, given the central role of RBD-ACE2r interactions in infection and published studies to date, and enable evaluation of vaccine responses. Methods and FindingsConfiguration and development of a competitive ELISA with plate-bound RBD and soluble biotinylated ACE2r was accomplished using pairs of pre/post vaccine serum. When the competitive ELISA was used to evaluate N=32 samples from COVID-19 patients previously tested by PRNT, excellent correlation in IC50 results were observed (rs= .83, p < 0.0001). When the competitive ELISA was used to evaluate N=41 vaccinated individuals and an additional N=14 unvaccinated recovered COVID-19 patients, significant differences in RBD-ACE2r inhibitory activity were associated with prior history of COVID-19 and type of vaccine received. In longitudinal analyses pre and up to 200 days post vaccine, surrogate neutralizing activity increased markedly after primary and booster vaccine doses, but fell substantially, up to <12% maximal levels within 6 months. ConclusionsA competitive ELISA based on inhibition of RBD-ACE2r attachment correlates well with PRNT, quantifies significantly higher activity among vaccine recipients with prior COVID (vs. those without), and highlights marked declines in surrogate neutralizing activity over a 6 month period post vaccination. The findings raise concern about the duration of vaccine responses and potential need for booster shots.","Wisnewski, Adam V; Liu, Jian; Lucas, Carolina V; Klein, Jon; Iwasaki, Akiko; Cantley, Linda; Fazen, Louis; Luna, Julian Campillo; Slade, Martin; Redlich, Carrie",,293,1

This study was aimed to assess the clinical effects of flaxseed and hesperidin in patients with NAFLD. SUBJECTS/METHODS: In this randomized, controlled, clinical trial, one hundred eligible patients with NAFLD were enrolled and randomly assigned to four dietary intervention groups including lifestyle modification program (control), lifestyle modification program with 30 g whole flaxseed powder, lifestyle modification program with 1 g hesperidin supplementation, and lifestyle modification program with combination of 30 g flaxseed and 1 g hesperidin (flax-hes) for 12 weeks. The changes in anthropometric parameters, metabolic profiles of glucose and lipids, inflammatory biomarkers and hepatic steatosis and fibrosis were evaluated. RESULTS: After the 12-week dietary interventions, significant reductions in body mass index, glucose hemostasis parameters and hepatic steatosis were observed in all groups. Repeated measures analysis of variance revealed a significant effect for time relative to almost all paraclinical parameters. Post hoc analysis with Bonferroni correction revealed that the three intervention groups experienced significant decreases in plasma levels of alanine aminotransferase, indices of insulin resistance and insulin sensitivity, fasting glucose and fatty liver index compared to control (p < 0.008). CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, our study confirmed that hesperidin and flaxseed supplementation improved glucose and lipid metabolism, while reduced inflammation and hepatic steatosis (controlled attenuation parameter) in NAFLD patients.

These workers are mostly middle-aged women and racial/ethnic minorities who typically earn low wages. Despite being integral to patient care, these workers are often neglected by the medical community and society at large; thus, developing a health care system capable of addressing the COVID-19 crisis and future pandemics requires a better understanding of the experiences of home health care workers. Objective: To understand the experiences of home health care workers caring for patients in New York City during the COVID-19 pandemic. Design, Setting, and Participants: From March to April 2020, a qualitative study with 1-to-1 semistructured interviews of 33 home health care workers in New York City was conducted in partnership with the 1199SEIU Home Care Industry Education Fund, a benefit fund of the 1199 Service Employees International Union United Healthcare Workers East, the largest health care union in the US. Purposeful sampling was used to identify and recruit home health care workers. Main Outcomes and Measures: Audio-recorded interviews were professionally transcribed and analyzed using grounded theory. Major themes and subthemes were identified. Results: In total, 33 home health care workers employed by 24 unique home care agencies across the 5 boroughs of New York City participated. Participants had a mean (SD) age of 47.6 (14.0) years, 32 (97%) were women, 21 (64%) were Black participants, and 6 (18%) were Hispanic participants. Five major themes emerged: home health care workers (1) were on the front lines of the COVID-19 pandemic but felt invisible; (2) reported a heightened risk for virus transmission; (3) received varying amounts of information, supplies, and training from their home care agencies; (4) relied on nonagency alternatives for support, including information and supplies; and (5) were forced to make difficult trade-offs in their work and personal lives. Conclusions and Relevance: In this qualitative analysis, home health care workers reported providing frontline essential care, often at personal risk, during the COVID-19 pandemic. They experienced challenges that exacerbated the inequities they face as a marginalized workforce. Interventions and policies to better support these frontline health care professionals are urgently needed.","Sterling, Madeline R; Tseng, Emily; Poon, Anthony; Cho, Jacklyn; Avgar, Ariel C; Kern, Lisa M; Ankuda, Claire K; Dell, Nicola",JAMA intern. med.

The lack of an established vaccine for this disease has caused millions of illnesses and hundreds of thousands of deaths globally. Mathematical models have become crucial tools in determining the potential and seriousness of the disease and in helping the types of strategic intervention measures to be taken to prevent and control the intensity of the spread of the disease. In this study, a compartmental epidemic model of COVID-19 is proposed and analyzed to predict the transmission dynamics of the disease in Ethiopia. Analytically, the basic reproduction number is determined. To observe the dynamics of the system, a detailed stability analysis of the disease-free equilibrium (DFE) of the proposed model is carried out. Our result shows that the DFE is stable if the basic reproduction number is less than unity and unstable otherwise. Also, the parameters of the assumed model are estimated using the actual data of COVID-19 from Ethiopia reported for three months between March and June 2020. Furthermore, we performed a sensitivity analysis of the basic reproductive number and found that reducing the rate of transmission is the most important factor in achieving disease control. Numerical simulations demonstrate the suitability of the proposed model for the actual COVID-19 data in Ethiopia. In particular, the numerical simulation shows an increase in the rate of transmission leads to a significant increase in the infected individuals. Thus, results of the numerical simulations are in agreement with the sensitivity results of the system. The possible implication of this is that declining the rate of transmission to the desired level could enable us to combat the disease. Numerical simulations are also performed to forecast the disease prevalence in the community.","Abay, Abadi; Berhe, Hailay Weldegiorgis; Atsbaha, Habtu Alemayehu",Results Phys,293,22

METHODS: Since February 21, 2020, staff in high-risk areas such as the ED and ICU of King Hamad University Hospital have worn N95 masks when performing aerosol-generating procedures to protect against the novel coronavirus 2019. At that time, without education enablers or resources that could be directly translated into practice, the hospital's Pressure Injury Prevention Committee explored, created, and tested a stepwise process to protect the skin under these masks while ensuring that it did not interfere with the effectiveness of the N95 mask seal. RESULTS: Skin protection was achieved by repurposing a readily available silicone border dressing cut into strips. This was tested on 10 volunteer staff members of various skin types and both sexes. Oxygen saturation values taken before and after the 4-hour wear test confirmed that well-fitted facial protection did not compromise the mask seal, but rather improved it. Staff also self-reported increased comfort with less friction. An educational enabler to prevent MDRPI from N95 mask wear was an important additional resource for the staff. CONCLUSIONS: This creative and novel stepwise process of developing a safe skin protection method enabling staff to apply a repurposed silicone border dressing beneath an N95 mask was largely effective and aided by the creation of the enabler.","Smart, Hiske; Opinion, Francis Byron; Darwich, Issam; Elnawasany, Manal Aly; Kodange, Chaitanya",Adv Skin Wound Care,293,20

We aimed to identify factors related to lapses in PPE use that may influence transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from patients to healthcare personnel (HCP). DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Tertiary-care medical center in Minnesota. PARTICIPANTS: In total, 345 HCP who sustained a significant occupational exposure to a patient with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) from May 13, 2020, through November 30, 2020, were evaluated. RESULTS: Overall, 8 HCP (2.3%) were found to have SARS-CoV-2 infection during their 14-day postexposure quarantine. A lack of eye protection during the care of a patient with COVID-19 was associated with HCP testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) during the postexposure quarantine (relative risk [RR], 10.25; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.28-82.39; P = .009). Overall, the most common reason for a significant exposure was the use of a surgical face mask instead of a respirator during an aerosol-generating procedure (55.9%). However, this was not associated with HCP testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 during the postexposure quarantine (RR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.96-1; P = 1). Notably, transmission primarily occurred in units that did not regularly care for patients with COVID-19.

Current frameworks may identify various factors that should be examined when making evidence-informed vaccine-related recommendations. However, while most immunization guidelines systematically assess clinical factors, such as efficacy and safety of vaccines, there is no published framework outlining how to systematically assess programmatic factors, such as the ethics, equity, feasibility, and acceptability of recommendations. We have addressed this gap with the development of the EEFA (Ethics, Equity Feasibility, Acceptability) Framework, supported by evidence-informed tools, including Ethics Integrated Filters, Equity Matrix, Feasibility Matrix, and an Acceptability Matrix. The Framework and tools are based on five years of environmental scans, systematic reviews and surveys, and refined by expert and stakeholder consultations and feedback. For each programmatic factor, the EEFA Framework summarizes the minimum threshold for consideration and when further in-depth analysis may be required, which aspects of the factor should be considered, how to assess the factor using the supporting evidence-informed tools, and who should be consulted to complete the assessment. Research, particularly in the fields of vaccine acceptability and equity, has validated the utility and comprehensiveness of the tools. The Framework has been successfully used in Canada for clear, timely, transparent vaccine guidance with positive stakeholder feedback on its comprehensiveness, relevance and appropriateness. Applying the EEFA Framework allows for the systematic consideration of the spectrum of public health science without a delay in recommendations, complementing existing decision-making frameworks. This Framework will therefore be useful for advisory groups worldwide to integrate critical factors that could impact the successful and timely implementation of comprehensive, transparent recommendations, and will further the global objective of developing practical and evidence-informed immunization policies.","Ismail, Shainoor J; Hardy, Kendra; Tunis, Matthew C; Young, Kelsey; Sicard, Nadine; Quach, Caroline",Vaccine,293,16

Anxiety regarding a greater ability to transmit the virus is largely unfounded and has played a significant role in the decision to allow children to return to school. In some patients, however, especially in infants and in those with underlying comorbidities, severe disease must be anticipated and planned for accordingly. The most relevant severe clinical presentation in addition to the established respiratory complications, is that of a multisystem inflammatory disorder, with features resembling Kawasaki disease. The impact of the pandemic on the economic and social wellbeing of children, including food insecurity and care when parents are ill, cannot be ignored. During this pandemic, it is imperative to ensure access to routine and emergency medical services to sick children. In so doing, potentially devastating medical and socioeconomic consequences can be mitigated.","Hendricks, C L; Green, R J",S Afr Med J,293,15

With the genetic sequence data of the nCoV already available since January 10, 2020, leading pharmaceutical companies, world over, in turn, have started working on the clinical trials to produce vaccines against this nCoV. In fact, many vaccines under the Phase III trial have claimed to demonstrate their efficacy to be as high as 95% against the nCoV. In January, the central drugs standard control organization, India had granted the emergency-use authorization [EUA] to two vaccines namely, Covishield (live vaccine, Oxford-AstraZeneca, United Kingdom being manufactured by the Serum Institute of India, Pune) and Covaxin (inactivated vaccine, Bharat Biotech, India). Although, most of the countries offer no deferral period for the donors who have been administered an inactivated vaccine against this nCoV. However, the national blood transfusion council of India has recently recommended a donor deferral period of 28 days from the last dose of vaccination. This could essentially lead to a massive loss of eligible blood donors and jeopardize the already disrupted blood supply management due to the COVID-19 outbreak.

The present cross-sectional study investigated the association of each dimension of health literacy with the implementation of exercise during the declaration of a state of emergency due to coronavirus disease in community-dwelling old-old adults. We collected data from 483 community-dwelling old-old adults (52.8% women) aged between 77 and 99 years who participated in a mail survey. Participants were divided into exercise or nonexercise groups based on the implementation of exercise during the declaration of a state of emergency. Health literacy was assessed using a 14-item health literacy scale. There were 327 (67.7%) participants in the exercise group and 156 (32.3%) in the nonexercise group. A significantly higher score of health literacy was observed in the exercise group than in the nonexercise group (communicative health literacy score = 14.0 ± 3.6 vs. 12.7 ± 3.8, p = 0.001). In a multivariate logistic regression model adjusted for potential confounders, high communicative health literacy scores were significantly associated with the implementation of exercise during the declaration of a state of emergency (odds ratio = 1.88, 95% confidence interval = 1.20-2.93). Approximately two-thirds of community-dwelling old-old adults implement exercise during the declaration of a state of emergency.

Some online dashboards have included essential features on a world map. However, only transforming data into visualizations for countries/regions is insufficient for the public need. This study aims to (1) develop an algorithm for classifying countries/regions into four quadrants inn GSM and (2) design an app for a better understanding of the COVID-19 situation. METHODS: We downloaded COVID-19 outbreak numbers daily from the Github website, including 189 countries/regions. A four-quadrant diagram was applied to present the classification of each country/region using Google Maps run on dashboards. A novel presentation scheme was used to identify the most struck entities by observing (1) the multiply infection rate (MIR) and (2) the growth trend in the recent 7 days. Four clusters of the COVID-19 outbreak were dynamically classified. An app based on a dashboard aimed at public understanding of the outbreak types and visualizing of the COVID-19 pandemic with Google Maps run on dashboards. The absolute advantage coefficient (AAC) was used to measure the damage hit by COVID-19 referred to the next two countries severely hit by COVID-19. RESULTS: We found that the two hypotheses were supported: India (i) is in the increasing status as of April 28, 2021; (ii) has a substantially higher ACC(= 0.81 > 0.70), and (iii) has a substantially higher ACC(= 0.66 < 0.70) as of May 17, 2021. CONCLUSION: Four clusters of the COVID-19 outbreak were dynamically classified online on an app making the public understand the outbreak types of COVID-19 pandemic shown on dashboards. The app with GSM and AAC is recommended for researchers in other disease outbreaks, not just limited to COVID-19.","Yang, Daw-Hsin; Chien, Tsair-Wei; Yeh, Yu-Tsen; Yang, Ting-Ya; Chou, Willy; Lin, Ju-Kuo",Eur J Med Res,293,24

A consultant led VSC is held weekly to review the database and follow-up patients virtually. Method: Analysis of patients added over a 15-month period was performed. Outcomes included spontaneous stone passage rates, intervention rates and time from initial imaging to VSC outcomes. Results: 615 patients with a median age of 48 years were analysed. Emergency referrals to urology accounted for 85.9% of data. VSC review occurred a median of 5 days after initial imaging. Majority of stones were lower ureteric (64.6%), 28.1% upper ureteric and 7.2% renal stones. Follow up data was available for 557 patients (90.6%). 73.6% of patients passed stones spontaneously. Median time from investigation to imaging was 21 days. 372 patients were discharged following VSC review. 111 patients were listed for surgical intervention. Median time to intervention was 21 days for ESWL, 62 days for ureteroscopy and 202 days for PCNL. Conclusions: VSC leads to shorter waiting times for follow-up imaging and interventions in patients with renal stone disease. This is especially evident in the current Covid-19 pandemic, resulting in higher quality of care.","Lee, R. X. N.; Heng, T. C. R.; Raju, J. A.; Bodiwala, D.; Scriven, S.

Connected devices, including continuous glucose monitors and automated insulin delivery systems for diabetes, are being used increasingly to support personalized clinical decisions based on automatically collected data. Furthermore, the development, demand, and coverage for telehealth have all recently expanded, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Medical care, and especially diabetes care, are therefore becoming more digital through the use of both connected digital health devices and telehealth communication. It has therefore become necessary to integrate digital data into the electronic health record and maintain personal data confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Connected digital monitoring combined with telehealth communication is known as virtual health. For this virtual care paradigm to be successful, patients must have proper skills, training, and equipment. We propose that along with the five current vital signs of blood pressure, pulse, respiratory rate, temperature, and pain, at this time, digital connectivity should be considered as the sixth vital sign.

Neolithic pastoralists, practicing transhumance between sandy lowlands and Saharan mountains, adopted new cultural practices: cattle burials and livestock bone deposits in built installations. Their ritual nature is indisputable. But ritual for what? If considered from the perspective of livestock zoonoses, such practices may point to the ""dark side"" of cultural adjustments-strategies to counter human and livestock diseases.

In this study, the changes in clinical practice occurred in an orthopaedic center in Milan are described. METHODS: Number and type of admissions, outpatients cancelled and preserved, emergency room, and intensive care unit activities have been analyzed in the timeframe of seven weeks since the beginning of the pandemic (from February 24th to April 10th) and compared with the same period in 2019. RESULTS: The planned surgical admissions declined from 2172 in 2019 to 664 in 2020 (69.42%, p < 0.0001), while emergencies increased from 158 to 268 (69.62%). The rehabilitation admissions declined from 414 to 69 (83.33%). The overall admission decreased by 63.52%, the trend showed a drop in the last weeks. Surgery performed in the COVID-19 operating room increased by 16.7% in the last week. Seven deaths occurred (0.7% of all orthopaedics and trauma admissions) compared with four (0.1%) which happened in the same period in 2019 (p = 0.004). Six of these patients were suffering from COVID-19. A total of 23,580 outpatients (93.8%) were cancelled. Emergency room consultations declined by 68.14% and 63.47% among white and green priority, respectively, while increased by 25% and 100% among yellow and red, respectively. CONCLUSION: These numbers show the radical changed scenario in an orthopaedic center in Milan during COVID-19 pandemic. Elective surgery declined rapidly going close to zero, outpatient admissions were restricted to cases that cannot be postponed, while emergencies increased due to the role played by the hospital as referral orthopaedic centre during the pandemic. The still ongoing emergency will have important impacts on the overall orthopaedic healthcare management for the next months.","Zagra, Luigi; Faraldi, Martina; Pregliasco, Fabrizio; Vinci, Anna; Lombardi, Giovanni; Ottaiano, Immacolata; Accetta, Riccardo; Perazzo, Paolo; D039,; Apolito, Rocco",Int Orthop,293,3

The dimensionality of tasks ranges from small molecule physicochemical property assessment over protein-ligand interaction up to statistical analyses of biological data. This way, method development and usability both benefit from insights gained at both ends, when predictiveness and readiness of novel approaches are confirmed, but the pharmaceutical drug makers get early access to novel tools for the quality of drug products and benefit of patients. Quantum-mechanical and simulation methods particularly fall into this group of methods, as they require skills and expense in their development but also significant resources in their application, thus are comparatively slowly dripping into the realm of industrial use. Nevertheless, these physics-based methods are becoming more and more useful. Starting with a general overview of these and in particular quantum-mechanical methods for drug discovery we review a decade-long and ongoing collaboration between Sanofi and the Kast group focused on the application of the embedded cluster reference interaction site model (EC-RISM), a solvation model for quantum chemistry, to study small molecule chemistry in the context of joint participation in several SAMPL (Statistical Assessment of Modeling of Proteins and Ligands) blind prediction challenges. Starting with early application to tautomer equilibria in water (SAMPL2) the methodology was further developed to allow for challenge contributions related to predictions of distribution coefficients (SAMPL5) and acidity constants (SAMPL6) over the years. Particular emphasis is put on a frequently overlooked aspect of measuring the quality of models, namely the retrospective analysis of earlier datasets and predictions in light of more recent and advanced developments. We therefore demonstrate the performance of the current methodical state of the art as developed and optimized for the SAMPL6 pKa and octanol-water log P challenges when re-applied to the earlier SAMPL5 cyclohexane-water log D and SAMPL2 tautomer equilibria datasets. Systematic improvement is not consistently found throughout despite the similarity of the problem class, i.e. protonation reactions and phase distribution. Hence, it is possible to learn about hidden bias in model assessment, as results derived from more elaborate methods do not necessarily improve quantitative agreement. This indicates the role of chance or coincidence for model development on the one hand which allows for the identification of systematic error and opportunities toward improvement and reveals possible sources of experimental uncertainty on the other. These insights are particularly useful for further academia-industry collaborations, as both partners are then enabled to optimize both the computational and experimental settings for data generation.","Tielker, Nicolas; Eberlein, Lukas; Hessler, Gerhard; Schmidt, K Friedemann; Güssregen, Stefan; Kast, Stefan M",J. comput. aided mol. des,293,24

This paper explores over 30 interventions across the following nine categories of change that hold the potential to address inequality, provide all citizens with access to essential goods and services, and advance progress towards sustainability: (1) Income and wealth transfers to facilitate an equitable increase in purchasing power/disposable income; (2) broadening worker and citizen ownership of the means of production and supply of services, allowing corporate profit-taking to be more equitably distributed; (3) changes in the supply of essential goods and services for more citizens; (4) changes in the demand for more sustainable goods and services desired by people; (5) stabilizing and securing employment and the workforce; (6) reducing the disproportionate power of corporations and the very wealthy on the market and political system through the expansion and enforcement of antitrust law such that the dominance of a few firms in critical sectors no longer prevails; (7) government provision of essential goods and services such as education, healthcare, housing, food, and mobility; (8) a reallocation of government spending between military operations and domestic social needs; and (9) suspending or restructuring debt from emerging and developing countries. Any interventions that focus on growing the economy must also be accompanied by those that offset the resulting compromises to health, safety, and the environment from increasing unsustainable consumption. This paper compares and identifies the interventions that should be considered as an important foundational first step in moving beyond the COVID-19 pandemic and towards sustainability. In this regard, it provides a comprehensive set of strategies that could advance progress towards a component of Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 10 to reduce inequality within countries. However, the candidate interventions are also contrasted with all 17 SDGs to reveal potential problem areas/tradeoffs that may need careful attention.","Ashford, Nicholas A.; Hall, Ralph P.; Arango-Quiroga, Johan; Metaxas, Kyriakos A.; Showalter, Amy L.",Sustainability,293,16

Novel agents such as 18F DOPA and 68Ga DOTATATE are being used nowadays in academic centers. During the COVID-19 pandemic, procurement of MIBG has proved particularly challenging, necessitating the use of 68Ga DOTATATE positron emission tomography. Methods: 68Ga DOTATATE PET/CT imaging was carried out for staging of three pediatric patients with Neuroblastoma at our institution. A review of the literature was also completed. Results: 68Ga-DOTATATE is FDA approved for imaging of somatostatin receptor (SSTR) positive gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. 68Ga DOTATATE PET/CT scans were successfully carried out in all patients. All patients showed DOTATATE avid disease. PET scans showed excellent spatial resolution and demonstrated high accuracy in concordance with current EANM guidelines. Conclusion: We have presented 68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT imaging believe it can be reliably used as an alternative to MIBG for staging of neuroblastoma. Its advantages include technical, clinical and practical advantages making it an attractive option. Further multicenter studies are required before it can be recommended for standard clinical use.","Maaz, Ata Ur Rehman; O039,; Doherty, Jim; Djekidel, Mehdi",J. nucl. med. technol,293,16

The novel coronavirus uses the ACE2 receptor to infect human cells, allowing it to target organ systems with such receptors including the respiratory, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal and endocrine system. The purpose of this case report is to describe the long-term implications COVID-19 may cause in the endocrine system. A 46-year-old woman was referred to our clinic due to abrupt uncontrolled blood glucose levels ranging from 200-550mg/dL after being infected with COVID-19 for approximately 10 weeks. She has a past medical history of Diabetes Mellitus Type 2 which was diagnosed 3 years ago and was well controlled with diet. Present history reveals polyuria, polydipsia, tiredness and a decreased appetite. Laboratory values show HbA1C 12, negative islet cell antibodies/GAD antibodies, low C-peptide, high TSH, normal FT4 and positive anti-TPO antibodies/thyroglobulin antibodies. The sudden loss of blood glucose control along with low c peptide levels without evidence of autoimmunity support the diagnosis of Pancreatic Diabetes. SARS-COV-2 infection may cause Diabetes Type 3, rendering a patient dependent on insulin use for life. Covid-19 survivors, with or without a previous history of endocrinopathy, should be evaluated for possible long-term sequels of infection as the virus targets tissues throughout the body.","Zayas, Francisco Jose Hernandez-Negron Marianne Garcia Michelle Marie Mangual",Journal of the Endocrine Society,293,26

Compared to other risks affecting public health such as flooding, EDs attract little attention in terms of risk assessment in the current literature. It does not well respond to the high practical demand for advanced techniques capable of tackling ED risks. To bridge this gap, an adapted fuzzy evidence reasoning method is proposed to realize the quantitative analysis of ED outbreak risk assessment (EDRA) with high uncertainty in risk data. The novelty of this article lies in (1) taking the lead to establish the outbreak risk evaluation system of epidemics covering the whole epidemic developing process, (2) combining quantitative and qualitative analysis in the fields of epidemic risk evaluation, (3) collecting substantial first-hand data by reviewing transaction data and interviewing the frontier experts and policymakers from Chinese Centers for Disease Control and Chinese National Medical Products Administration. This work provides useful insights for the regulatory bodies to (1) understand the risk levels of different EDs in a quantitative manner and (2) the sensitivity of different EDs to the identified risk factors for their effective control. For instance, in the case study, we use real data to disclose that influenza has the highest breakout risk level in Beijing. The proposed method also provides a potential tool for evaluating the outbreak risk of COVID-19.","Shi, Xianliang; Li, Jiangning; Huang, Anqiang; Song, Shaohua; Yang, Zaili",Risk anal,293,24

Specifically, we aim to: a) explore the psychosocial experiences of women in the early postnatal period; b) describe prevalence rates of clinically relevant maternal anxiety and depression; and c) explore whether psychosocial change occurring as a result of COVID-19 is predictive of clinically relevant maternal anxiety and depression. METHODS: A sample of UK mothers (N = 614) with infants aged between birth and twelve weeks were recruited via convenience sampling. A cross-sectional survey design was utilised which comprised demographics, COVID-19 specific questions, and a battery of validated psychosocial measures, including the EPDS and STAI-S which were used to collect prevalence rates of clinically relevant depression and anxiety respectively. Data collection coincided with the UK government's initial mandated ""lockdown"" restrictions and the introduction of social distancing measures in 2020. FINDINGS: Descriptive findings from the overall sample indicate that a high percentage of mothers self-reported psychological and social changes as a result of the introduction of social distancing measures. For women who reported the presence of psychosocial change, these changes were perceived negatively. Whilst seventy women (11.4%) reported a current clinical diagnosis of depression, two hundred and sixty-four women (43%) reported a score of &#8805;13 on the EPDS, indicating clinically relevant depression. Whilst one hundred and thirteen women (18.4%) reported a current clinical diagnosis of anxiety, three hundred and seventy-three women (61%) reported a score of &#8805;40 on STAI-S, indicating clinically relevant anxiety. After accounting for current clinical diagnoses of depression or anxiety, and demographic factors known to influence mental health, only perceived psychological change occurring as a result of the introduction of social distancing measures predicted unique variance in the risk of clinically relevant maternal depression (30%) and anxiety (33%). INTERPRETATION: To our knowledge, this is the first national study to examine the psychosocial experiences of postnatal women during the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK. Prevalence rates of clinically relevant maternal depression and anxiety were extremely high when compared to both self-reported current diagnoses of depression and anxiety, and pre-pandemic prevalence studies. Perceived psychological changes occurring as a result of the introduction of social distancing measures predicted unique variance in the risk for clinically relevant maternal depression and anxiety. This study provides vital information for clinicians, funders, policy makers, and researchers to inform the immediate next steps in perinatal care, policy, and research during COVID-19 and future health crises.","Fallon, Victoria; Davies, Siân M; Silverio, Sergio A; Jackson, Leanne; De Pascalis, Leonardo; Harrold, Joanne A",J Psychiatr Res,293,20

This vital resource must be effectively employed, it must be certified, it must be searched for, it must be found, and it may even be actively produced. We discuss why this needs to be done and how this can be achieved. Our arguments not only apply to the current pandemic but also to any future rapidly spreading, infectious disease epidemics. In addition, we argue for high awareness of a major secondary, nonbiological crisis arising from the side effects of societal and economic pandemic reactions to actual or imagined health risks.

The medicalprocedure was, to treat a patient with pneumonia.Oxygen was mainly used in hospitals, to treat patients with a variety of respiratory issues. The first form of portable medical grade oxygen was developed in 1950's, which led to the clinical use of oxygen therapy. There is considerable observation based, as well as experimental evidence, to suggest that oxygen therapy exerts a significant physiological and pharmacological effects that improves cellular, tissue, and organ oxygenation, exerts anti-inflammatory, anti-bacterial effects, and improves tissue repair mechanisms. Despite this knowledge, the oxygen therapy to treat hypoxia related clinical conditions is limited. Since our interest is in the prevention of clinical complications related to cardiometabolic diseases, we discuss in this overview, pre-existing conditions, where oxygen therapy may play a very important role, in preventing hypoxia-mediated cell death, and protect the tissue and organ damage. Stroke affects 33 million individuals, worldwide every year and two-thirds of all strokes, occur in developing countries. Unlike developed countries, where stroke incidence has declined by 42% over the last four decades, stroke incidence rates have increased by &gt;100% in developing, low-to middle-income countries. It is possible, that by developing a combined oxygen therapy (using Normobaric oxygen therapy followed by Hyperbaric oxygen therapy), significant number of stroke-related morbidity and mortality could be reduced. Another area of interest, that needs immediate attention is the COVID-19 related respiratory distress, hypoxia, organ failure and death. Like the stroke condition, early intervention with combined oxygen therapy, will significantly reduce hypoxia mediated, -inflammation, respiratory distress, organ failure and loss of lives, in Covid-19 patients. Efforts are in progress to test this hypothesis, in both stroke patients as well as Covid-19 patients, to validate the benefits or otherwise of combined oxygen therapy, in reducing the morbidity and mortality under these severe illness conditions.","Muralidharan, G.; Rao, Gundu H.R.",Biomed.

AGPs includethe use of electrocautery, open suctioning, and drilling. Temporal bone drilling aerosolizes bone, blood, and mucosa. Thelining of the eustachian tube, middle ear, and mastoid air cells has been shown to harbor multiple respiratory viruses.Incidents of combined neurootology and neurosurgical procedures resulting in infections of surgeons and trainees havebeen reported. Intraoperative exposures may occur even when patients test negative for COVID-19 preoperatively, despiteproper personal protective equipment (PPE). We describe the use of a protective tent to reduce the number of aerosolizedparticles within the operating room. Using a standard c-arm drape ([ Fig. 1 ]), a sterile tent can be created between theoperating field and microscope. The drape is cut in the middle between the two arms. One side has a circumferential rubberband that goes around the patient and irrigation bag, where it is then secured with clamps. Suction tubing and drill wiresare passed beneath this with additional tenting support from a Leyla's retractor on the contralateral side ([ Fig. 2 ]).Surgeons may attach suctions to the integrated smoke evacuator of the Neptune 3 Waste Management System. Thesurgeon accesses the operative site by two small slits that accommodate the forearms, while still allowing access to themicroscope handles ([ Fig. 3 ]). The surgical technician can pass instruments by going beneath the drape, through smallslits, or by the creation of a flap that is closed and secured when the surgeon is actively working. During temporal bonedrilling it has been clear that the generation of smoke, fluids, and other particles is substantial ([ Fig. 4 ]). With consistentuse, we have found that both the surgeon and assistants quickly accommodate to the new set-up.

As an academic who has studied deinstitutionalization of services for people with disabilities in Romania, I argue that residential care institutions for people with disabilities are at risk of becoming sites for community contagion with COVID-19. These institutions are often located in remote and economically peripheral areas of the country that have been characterized by high rates of outmigration. Now, these are becoming areas of intense return migration. Community contagion in adjacent locations can easily spill over to residential institutions through care and health workers’ trajectories. Once spread to residential institutions, COVID-19 has a high chance of adversely affecting the health of residents with disabilities.

Hence, the immune response in conventionally weaned pigs infected with PDCoV was assessed after challenge and rechallenge. After the first challenge, obvious diarrhea and viral shedding developed successively in all pigs in the four inoculation dose groups from 3 to 14 days postinfection (dpi), and all pigs recovered (no clinical symptoms or viral shedding) by 21 dpi. All pigs in the four groups exhibited significantly increased PDCoV-specific IgG, IgA and virus-neutralizing (VN) antibody (Ab) titers and IFN-Î³ levels in the serum after the first challenge. All pigs were completely protected against rechallenge at 21 dpi. The serum levels of PDCoV-specific IgG, IgA, and VN Abs increased further after rechallenge. Notably, the IFN-Î³ level declined continuously after 7 dpi. In addition, the levels of PDCoV-specific IgG, IgA and VN Abs in saliva increased significantly after rechallenge and correlated well with the serum Ab titers. Furthermore, the appearance of clinical symptoms of PDCoV infection in conventionally weaned pigs was delayed with reduced inoculation doses.

We found no differences in the time to clinical improvement (median, 7 d vs. 12 d; risk ratio (RR), 2.0; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.7-5.6; p = 0.2), with clinical improvement occurring in ten patients in the Triazavirin group and six patients in the placebo group (38.5% vs. 23.1%, RR, 2.1; 95% CI, 0.6-7.0; p = 0.2). All components of the primary outcome normalized within 28 d, with the exception of absorption of pulmonary infection (Triazavirin 50.0%, placebo 26.1%). Patients in the Triazavirin group used less frequent concomitant therapies for respiratory, cardiac, renal, hepatic, or coagulation supports. Although no statistically significant evidence was found to indicate that Triazavirin benefits COVID-19 patients, our observations indicated possible benefits from its use to treat COVID-19 due to its antiviral effects. Further study is required for confirmation.","Wu, Xiaoke; Yu, Kaijiang; Wang, Yongchen; Xu, Wanhai; Ma, Hongli; Hou, Yan; Li, Yue; Cai, Benzhi; Zhu, Liying; Zhang, Min; Hu, Xiaoli; Gao, Jingshu; Wang, Yu; Qin, Huichao; Wang, Wenjie; Zhao, Mingyan; Wu, Xia; Zhang, Yong; Li, Lu; Li, Kang; Du, Zhimin; Mol, Ben Willem J; Yang, Baofeng",,293,24

A growing number of studies call attention to the relationship between VD deficiency and cardiovascular disease. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of VD on subclinical left ventricular (LV) function in diabetic and non-diabetic patients with no significant coronary artery disease. Material and methods: We recruited 140 patients (80 diabetics and 60 non-diabetics) with symptoms of stable ischemic heart disease who underwent coronary angiography and who had no significant coronary artery disease in our clinic. The 25(OH)D3 levels were measured and patients who had 25-(OH)D3 levels below 20 ng/dl were defined as the VD deficient group. In addition to conventional echocardiographic parameters, tissue Doppler echocardiography was used for LV diastolic functions and 2D speckle tracking strain echocardiography (2D STE) for evaluating the longitudinal deformation indices of the LV myocardium. Results: In all groups, LV global longitudinal strain (GLS) was significantly impaired in patients with VD deficiency (p < 0.001) compared to patients without VD deficiency. LV global longitudinal strain rate (GLSR) was significantly impaired in patients with VD deficiency (p = 0.003). The GLS was negatively associated with 25-(OH)D3 in the VD deficiency group (r = -0.52623, p < 0.001). Conversely, GLS was positively associated with 25-(OH)D3 levels in the normal VD group (r = 0.28, p = 0.048). Conclusions: VD deficiency is associated with impaired myocardial GLS. The present study demonstrated that VD deficiency may be the cause of subclinical myocardial dysfunction in patients with or without diabetes mellitus and no history of significant coronary artery disease.","Ozer, Pelin Karaca; Emet, Samim; Karaayvaz, Ekrem Bilal; Elitok, Ali; Bilge, Ahmet Kaya; Adalet, Kamil; Oncul, Aytac",Arch Med Sci Atheroscler Dis,293,30

The prognosis and lethality of COVID-19 infection in patients with established kidney disease has not been widely studied. METHODS: Data included patients who underwent kidney biopsy at the Vall d'Hebron Hospital between January 2013 and February 2020 with COVID-19 diagnosis during the period from March 1 to May 15, 2020. RESULTS: Thirty-nine (7%) patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 infection. Mean age was 63 ± 15 years and 48.7% were male. Hypertension was present in 79.5%, CKD without renal replacement therapy in 76.9%, and cardiovascular disease in 64.1%. Nasopharyngeal swab was performed in 26 patients; older (p = 0.01), hypertensive (p = 0.005), and immunosuppressed (p = 0.01) patients, those using RAS-blocking drugs (p = 0.04), and those with gastrointestinal symptoms (p = 0.02) were more likely to be tested for CO-VID-19. Twenty-two patients required hospitalization and 15.4% died. In bivariate analysis, mortality was associated with older age (p = 0.03), cardiovascular disease (p = 0.05), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (p = 0.05), and low hemoglobin levels (p = 0.006). Adjusted Cox regression showed that low hemoglobin levels at admission had 1.81 greater risk of mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with CO-VID-19 infection and kidney disease confirmed by kidney biopsy presented a mortality of 15.4%. Swab test for COVID-19 was more likely to be performed in older, hypertensive, and immunosuppressed patients, those using RAS-blocking drugs, and those with gastrointestinal symptoms. Low hemoglobin is a risk factor for mortality.","Román, Juan León; García-Carro, Clara; Agraz, Irene; Toapanta, Nestor; Vergara, Ander; Gabaldón, Alejandra; Torres, Irina; Bury, Roxana; Baldallo, Cinthia; Serón, Daniel; Soler, María José",Kidney Blood Press Res,293,1

Not only hyperglycaemia induced nerve damage is harder to repair using currently approved medications, but also, the use of these agents is often limited by the extent of pain relief provided and side effects. METHODOLOGY: In this prospective, open-label, pilot study, 20 type-2 diabetes mellitus patients (male/female=13/7, mean age- 56.1±8.04 years), meeting inclusion/exclusion criteria, were treated with dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor, Teneligliptin, 20mg once a day for three months. Efficacy parameters: Sudomotor function (Sudoscan score); parasympathetic dysfunction assessed using Ewing's criteria i.e. heart rate response to -standing (HRS), -valsalva (HRV) and -deep breath (HRD); sympathetic dysfunction assessed as blood pressure response to -standing (BPS) and -handgrip (BPH); ankle brachial index (ABI), vibration perception threshold (VPT), C-reactive protein, glycemic profile and health related quality of life (HRQoL); and, tolerability parameters: complete blood count, liver function tests, serum creatinine, thyroid stimulating hormone, QT- interval and serum vitamin B12 levels, were measured. RESULTS: There was no statistical difference in BMI, SBP, DBP, HRD, BPH and all safety parameters. After 12 weeks treatment, there was improvement in HRS (p<0.01) and HRV (p<0.01), but not in HRD (p=0.12). BPS was significantly lowered (p <0.01), but not the BPH (p =0.06). Sudoscan score was increased, while VPT was significantly decreased (both p<0.01). CONCLUSION: Teneligliptin not only improves the glycemic status but also improves sudomotor function, peripheral and autonomic neuropathy, and reduces vascular inflammation in type 2 diabetes.","Syngle, Ashit; Chahal, Simran; Vohra, Kanchan",Neurol. sci,293,23

The aim of this study is to reveal the preventive measures taken by renal transplant recipients during the COVID-19 pandemic and whether these measures influence the prevalence of the disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: After detecting the first COVID-19 case in Turkey, we briefed all of our renal transplant recipients on preventive measures regarding COVID-19. Two months afterward, a questionnaire was prepared regarding the preventive measures practiced by renal transplant recipients, and patients were asked whether they had any COVID-19 symptoms or had received a COVID-19 diagnosis. RESULTS: Among 132 patients, 68 were surveyed through telephone calls. During this time, 95.5% of patients were in isolation at home except for when seeing to their essential needs. Two (2.9%) patients were hospitalized due to increases in creatinine level and urinary tract infection. All patients have worn masks when going out and stated that they washed their hands more frequently. There was a decrease in the frequency of hospital controls in 79.4% of patients. Although 2 (2.9%) patients had complaints of dysuria and fever, they did not apply to the hospital because they thought hospitals carried risk during the pandemic. One patient had a cough with fever and was admitted to the hospital with suspicion of COVID-19 but tested negative. DISCUSSION: It was determined that renal transplant recipients in our study population meticulously complied with preventive measures and increased the use of masks and hand hygiene practices. As a result, none were infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.","Hasanoglu, Imran; Bilgic, Zeynep; Olcucuoglu, Erkan; Karakan, Mine Sebnem; Demirci, Bahar Gurlek; Kalem, Ayse Kaya; Kayaaslan, Bircan; Eser, Fatma; Guner, Rahmet",Transplant. proc,293,1

As this value increases monotonically over time, the end of June 2021 was chosen, when the growth rate in Ukraine and the vast majority of European countries was small. This allowed us to draw some intermediate conclusions about the influence of the volume of population, its density, and the level of urbanization on the accumulated number of laboratory-confirmed cases per capita in European countries and regions of Ukraine. A simple analysis showed that the number of cases per capita does not depend on these demographic factors, although it may differ by about 4 times for different regions of Ukraine and more than 9 times for different European countries.

Methods: Medical Research Council guidelines for developing complex interventions informed intervention development and feasibility testing. This included identifying the evidence base and theory (establishing HOP theory of change, a systematic review on decision-making in dementia, a stakeholder consultation), modelling the intervention materials with research experts (creation of version 1.0) and experts by experience (creation of version 2.0), and pilot testing the intervention recording participant observations and facilitator reflections. The final version of the intervention materials was developed with experts by experience of dementia where the accessibility of language and appropriate styles of facilitation were the focus. Results: The concept of the intervention was strongly endorsed by respondents of the stakeholder consultation (209/226). Stakeholder preferences included face-to-face delivery, a manualized workbook approach and the inclusion of the primary carer during intervention delivery. Recruitment for intervention groups took place in non-NHS settings (2 small groups recruited) and NHS settings (no groups recruited). In non-NHS settings, 7 dyads agreed to take part in one of two intervention groups. Both intervention groups had over 70% attendance by participants (group 1: 72.2% group 2: 87.5%). Conclusion: The concept of an intervention to support diagnostic disclosure was endorsed by stakeholders; however, recruitment was challenging; the ""who to tell, how and when?"" intervention has the potential to fill a gap in the post-diagnostic pathway.","Bhatt, Jem; Ruffell, Tamatha Ophelia; Scior, Katrina; Charlesworth, Georgina",Clin Interv Aging,293,10

However, poultry meat is frequently highly contaminated with microorganisms. Total viable count (TVC), which is also called total aerobic mesophilic bacteria (TAMB), is an indicator of bacterial quality. The aim of this study was to investigate the factors associated with bacterial contamination of poultry meat at butcher shops. The study was carried out from January 2018 to July 2020 and included 10 butcher shops in Biskra (Algeria). Different poultry meat samples (n=159) were purchased from butcher shops, prior to and after the outbreak of COVID-19. Each sample was tested for TAMB and faecal coliforms. In this study, one independent variable was quantitative, which is the contamination of poultry meat by faecal coliforms, and nine variables were categorical: whole carcass packed at the slaughterhouse or cut at butcher shop, sample type: thigh skin, thigh meat, neck skin, liver, turkey escalope, and before or after the outbreak of COVID-19. Descriptive statistics, multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) and multiple linear regression were used to examine if the various factors identified were associated with the bacterial contamination of poultry meat. The average level of contamination of poultry meat by TAMB was: 6.40 +or- 0.81 log10 CFU/g.

BACKGROUND: Care homes provide long-term care to vulnerable, frail older people, as well as to young people with profound disabilities. The COVID-19 pandemic has shown that the residential care sector has been seriously affected in many parts of the world and has exposed major flaws and vulnerabilities in infection control and other processes that have resulted in considerable loss of life of residents of these facilities. DESIGN: Discursive paper informed by a systematic literature. Review was carried out in line with PRISMA reporting guidelines. The review protocol was registered with PROSPERO on 2020 [CRD42020211847]. RESULTS: The review identified six papers meeting inclusion criteria across care residential facilities in different countries. Several prevention and mitigation strategies were identified to manage and reduce the spread and severity of viral respiratory infection pandemics. These strategies include isolation, restriction of movement, personal protective and hygienic measures, health education and information sharing, monitoring and coordination, and screening and treatment. Preparedness strategies identified were contingency planning such as reporting/communication, leadership, human resource, insurance, occupational health and resource availability. The prevention/mitigation and preparedness strategies helped to achieve decline in disease severity, reduced prevalence, reduced spread of the disease, improved readiness criteria, resource usefulness and increased intervention acceptability. This paper presents a conceptual framework exploring the interconnectedness of preparedness and prevention/ mitigation strategies and associated outcomes. We discuss areas of concern in the context of workforce employment patterns in the sector. Concerns related to the unintended consequences of strategies placed on aged care facilities, which may worsen mental health outcomes for residents, are discussed. CONCLUSIONS: Persons in residential care settings are at greater risk of infection during a pandemic, and therefore, strict measures to protect their safety are warranted. However, they are also a group who already experience social isolation and so any measures involving restrictions to visiting and social interaction, particularly over the longer term, must be accompanied by strategies to mitigate potential loneliness and mental health sequelae arising from long-term pandemic restrictions. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Though there was evidence of activity in preparedness for disasters within the residential care sector, various contextual factors affecting the sector were clearly not adequately considered or addressed in pre-pandemic disaster planning, particularly in the areas of staff movements between care homes and the length of time that social isolation and restriction measures would need to be in place. Future pandemic planning should consider the nature of the workforce model in the care home sector, and factor in strategies to better support the mobile and highly casualised workforce.","Usher, Kim; Durkin, Joanne; Gyamfi, Naomi; Warsini, Sri; Jackson, Debra",J. clin. nurs,293,24

METHODS: In total, 7,706 pancreatoduodenectomies performed at 18 international institutions composing the Pancreas Fistula Study Group were examined (2003-2020). High estimated blood loss (>700 mL) was defined as twice the median. Propensity score matching (1:1 exact-match) was employed to adjust for variables associated with high estimated blood loss and clinically relevant pancreatic fistula occurrence. The study was powered to detect a 33% clinically relevant pancreatic fistula increase in the high estimated blood loss group, with &#945; = 0.05 and ß = 0.2. RESULTS: The propensity score model included 966 patients with high estimated blood loss and 966 patients with lower estimated blood loss; all covariate imbalantces were solved. Patients with high estimated blood loss patients experienced higher clinically relevant pancreatic fistula rates (19.4 vs 12.6%, odds ratio 1.66; P < .001), as well as higher severe complication rates (27.8 vs 15.6%), transfusions (50.1 vs 14.3%), reoperations (9.2 vs 4.0%), intensive care unit transfers (9.9 vs 4.8%) and 90-day mortality (4.7 vs 2.0%, all P < .001). High estimated blood loss was an independent predictor for clinically relevant pancreatic fistula (odds ratio 1.78, 95% confidence interval 1.37-2.32), as were prophylactic Octreotide administration (odds ratio 1.95, 95% confidence interval 1.46-2.61) and soft pancreatic texture (odds ratio 5.32, 95% confidence interval 3.74-5.57; all P < .001). Moreover, a second model including 1,126 pancreatoduodenectomies was derived including vascular resections as additional confounder (14.0% vascular resections performed in each group). On multivariable regression, high estimated blood loss was confirmed an independent predictor for clinically relevant pancreatic fistula reduction (odds ratio 1.80, 95% confidence interval 1.32-2.44; P < .001), whereas vascular resection was not (odds ratio 0.64, 95% confidence interval 0.34-1.88; P = .156). CONCLUSION: This study better establishes the relationship between estimated blood loss and outcomes after pancreatoduodenectomy. Despite inherent contributions to blood loss, its minimization is an actionable opportunity for clinically relevant pancreatic fistula reduction and performance optimization in pancreatoduodenectomy. Accordingly, practical insights are offered to achieve this goal.","Casciani, Fabio; Trudeau, Maxwell T; Asbun, Horacio J; Ball, Chad G; Bassi, Claudio; Behrman, Stephen W; Berger, Adam C; Bloomston, Mark P; Callery, Mark P; Christein, John D; Falconi, Massimo; Fernandez-Del Castillo, Carlos; Dillhoff, Mary E; Dickson, Euan J; Dixon, Elijah; Fisher, William E; House, Michael G; Hughes, Steven J; Kent, Tara S; Kunstman, John W; Malleo, Giuseppe; Partelli, Stefano; Wolfgang, Christopher L; Zureikat, Amer H; Vollmer, Charles M",Surgery (St. Louis),293,33

The objective was to determine the circulatory biomarkers for macrophage activation at baseline and after serum glucose normalization in obese type 2 diabetes (OT2D) subjects. A case-controlled interventional pilot study in OT2D (n = 23) and control subjects (n = 23). OT2D subjects underwent hyperinsulinemic clamp to normalize serum glucose. Plasma macrophage-related proteins were determined using Slow Off-rate Modified Aptamer-scan plasma protein measurement at baseline (control and OT2D subjects) and after 1-h of insulin clamp (OT2D subjects only). Basal M1 macrophage activation was characterized by elevated levels of M1 macrophage-specific surface proteins, CD80 and CD38, and cytokines or chemokines (CXCL1, CXCL5, RANTES) released by activated M1 macrophages. Two potent M1 macrophage activation markers, CXCL9 and CXCL10, were decreased in OT2D. Activated M2 macrophages were characterized by elevated levels of plasma CD163, TFGß-1, MMP7 and MMP9 in OT2D. Conventional mediators of both M1 and M2 macrophage activation markers (IFN-Î³, IL-4, IL-13) were not altered. No changes were observed in plasma levels of M1/M2 macrophage activation markers in OT2D in response to acute normalization of glycemia. In the basal state, macrophage activation markers are elevated, and these reflect the expression of circulatory cytokines, chemokines, growth factors and matrix metalloproteinases in obese individuals with type 2 diabetes, that were not changed by glucose normalisation. These differences could potentially predispose diabetic individuals to increased infection severity complicated by ARDS.

The objective of this study was to determine the predictive factors of severe hypoxemia in patients hospitalized in COVID-19 health facilities in Burkina Faso. PATIENTS AND METHOD: This study was a hospital-based cross-sectional study. The data collected relate to the period of the first wave of the epidemic (March 9 to June 30, 2020). All patients hospitalized for COVID-19 in the requisitioned health facilities of Ouagadougou were included in this study. Predictors of severe hypoxemia were identified using multivariate logistic regression model. RESULTS: During the study period, 442 patients were included representing 45.7% of the total number of positive patients in the whole country. The most common co-morbidities were diabetes (55; 12.4%), arterial hypertension (97; 21.9%). Severe hypoxemia (SpO2 < 90%) was observed in 64 patients (14.5%). Age over 65 years (OR = 8.24; 95% CI: 2.83 - 24.01) and diabetes (OR = 2.43; 95% CI: 1.17 - 5.06) were the predictors with the occurrence of severe hypoxemia in multivariate analysis. CONCLUSION: The predictive factors of COVID-19 are similar in African and Caucasian populations. The surveillance of COVID-19 in risk groups should be strengthened to reduce their morbidity and mortality.","Arnaud, Diendéré Eric; Apoline, Sondo K; Risgou, Ouédraogo Abdoul; Lucien, Dahourou Désiré; Kadari, Cissé; Abdoulaye, Sawadogo; Soumaila, Maiga; Marcel, Kuiré; Seidou, Zida; Pierre, Kaboré R; Christian, Minoungou J W; Ulrich, Habou; Habil, Badalo; Noelie, Zoungrana; Arsène, Ouédraogo G; Arielle, Belem Rita; Jacques, Zoungrana; Armel, Poda G E; Ismael, Diallo; Flavien, Kaboré; Sanou, Adama; Séni, Kouanda",Int. j. infect. dis,293,26

Households in particular represent a close-contact environment with high probability of transmission between persons of different ages and with different roles in society. METHODS: Complete households with a laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 positive case in the Netherlands (March-May 2020) were included. At least three home visits were performed during 4-6 week of follow-up, collecting naso- and oropharyngeal swabs, oral fluid, feces and blood samples for molecular and serological analyses of all household members. Symptoms were recorded from two weeks before the first visit through to the final visit. Infection secondary attack rates (SAR) were estimated with logistic regression. A transmission model was used to assess transmission routes in the household. RESULTS: A total of 55 households with 187 household contacts were included. In 17 households no transmission took place, and in 11 households all persons were infected. Estimated infection SARs were high, ranging from 35% (95%CI: 24%-46%) in children to 51% (95%CI: 39%-63%) in adults. Estimated transmission rates in the household were high, with reduced susceptibility of children compared to adolescents and adults (0.67; 95%CI: 0.40-1.1). CONCLUSION: Estimated infection SARs were higher than reported in earlier household studies, presumably owing to our dense sampling protocol. Children were shown to be less susceptible than adults, but the estimated infection SAR in children was still high. Our results reinforce the role of households as one of the main multipliers of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the population.","Reukers, Daphne F M; van Boven, Michiel; Meijer, Adam; Rots, Nynke; Reusken, Chantal; Roof, Inge; van Gageldonk-Lafeber, Arianne B; van der Hoek, Wim; van den Hof, Susan",Clin. infect. dis,293,16

The present work was aimed at studying the efficiency of thymulin and PRDX6 in a type 1 diabetes mellitus model induced by streptozotocin in mice. Effects of prolonged treatment with PRDX6 or thymic peptide thymulin on diabetes development were evaluated. We assessed the effects of the drugs on the physiological status of diabetic mice by measuring blood glucose, body weight, and cell counts in several organs, as well as effects of thymulin and PRDX6 on the immune status of diabetic mice measuring concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines in blood plasma (TNF-&#945;, interleukin-5 and 17, and interferon-Î³), activity of NF-&#954;B and JNK pathways, and Hsp90&#945; expression in immune cells. Both thymulin and PRDX6 reduced the physiological impairments in diabetic mice at various levels. Thymulin and PRDX6 provide beneficial effects in the model of diabetes via very different mechanisms. Taken together, the results of our study indicated that the thymic peptide and the antioxidant enzyme have anti-inflammatory functions. As increasing evidences show diabetes mellitus as a distinct comorbidity leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome and increased mortality in patients with COVID-19 having cytokine storm, thymulin, and PRDX6 might serve as a supporting anti-inflammatory treatment in the therapy of COVID 19 in diabetic patients.","Novoselova, Elena G; Glushkova, Olga V; Lunin, Sergey M; Khrenov, Maxim O; Parfenyuk, Svetlana B; Novoselova, Tatyana V; Sharapov, Mars G; Gordeeva, Alina E; Novoselov, Vladimir I; Fesenko, Evgeny E",Int J Immunopathol Pharmacol,293,21

However, a critical gap exists between the fast pace of biomarker discovery and the successful translation to clinical use. This gap underscores the fundamental biomarker conundrum across various acute and chronic disorders: how does a biomarker address a specific unmet need? Additionally, the gap highlights the need to shift the paradigm from a focus on biomarker discovery to greater translational impact and the need for a more streamlined drug approval process. The unmet need for biomarkers in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is for reliable and validated biomarkers that minimize heterogeneity and allow for stratification of subject selection for enrollment in clinical trials of tailored therapies. This unmet need is particularly highlighted by the ongoing SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 pandemic. The unprecedented numbers of COVID-19-induced ARDS cases has strained health care systems across the world and exposed the need for biomarkers that would accelerate drug development and the successful phenotyping of COVID-19-infected patients at risk for development of ARDS and ARDS mortality. Accordingly, this review discusses the current state of ARDS biomarkers in the context of the drug development pipeline and highlight gaps between biomarker discovery and clinical implementation while proposing potential paths forward. We discuss potential ARDS biomarkers by category and by context of use, highlighting progress in the development continuum. We conclude by discussing challenges to successful translation of biomarker candidates to clinical impact and proposing possible novel strategies.","Bime, Christian; Camp, Sara M; Casanova, Nancy; Oita, Radu C; Ndukum, Juliet; Lynn, Heather; Garcia, Joe G N",Transl Res,293,1

Multiple therapeutic options, including hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and azithromycin (AZI), were tried initially to treat moderate to severe COVID-19 and high-risk patients in LTCFs, but they were abandoned due to unfavorable reports. As a less toxic option, we initiated treatment with doxycycline (DOXY) very early in the course of illness. DOXY has antiviral, cardioprotective, immunomodulatory, and anti-inflammatory properties, but the efficacy of early intervention with DOXY in high-risk COVID-19 patients in LTCFs is unknown. Objective The goal of this retrospective study is to describe the clinical outcomes of high-risk COVID-19 patients with moderate to severe symptoms in LTCFs after early intervention with DOXY. Design Case-series analysis Setting LTCFs in New York Participants This observational study examines 89 patients who were diagnosed with COVID-19 from March 18 to May 13, 2020. Exposure All patients who were diagnosed with COVID-19 received DOXY and regular standard of care within 12 hours of the onset of symptoms. Additionally, four patients received meropenem, three patients received Zosyn, two patients received linezolid, and two patients received Bactrim DS. Four patients were on chronic ventilator support. No patients received any steroids or any other antiviral or immunomodulatory agents. The majority of the patients received zinc and calcium supplements as well. Main outcomes and measures Assessed measures were patients' characteristics, fever, shortness of breath (SOB), cough, oxygen saturation/pulse oximetry (POX), radiologic improvements, laboratory tests, DOXY side effects, hospital transfers, and death. Results Eighty-nine (89) high-risk patients, who developed a sudden onset of fever, cough, SOB, and hypoxia and were diagnosed with COVID-19, were treated with DOXY (100 mg PO or intravenous (IV) for seven days) and regular standard of care. Eighty-five percent (85%) of patients (n=76) demonstrated clinical recovery that is defined as resolution of fever (average 3.7 days, Coeff = -0.96, p = 0.0001), resolution of SOB (average 4.2 days), and improvement of POX: average 84% before treatment and average 95% after treatment (84.7 ± 7% vs. 95 ± 2.6%, p = 0.0001). Higher pre- and post-treatment POX is associated with lower mortality (oxygen saturation (Spo2) vs. Death, Coeff = -0.01, p = 0.023; post-Spo2 vs. Death, Coeff = -0.05, p = 0.0002). Within 10 days of symptom onset, 3% of patients (n=3) were transferred to hospital due to clinical deterioration and 11% of patients (n=10) died. The result was followed for 30 days from the onset of symptoms in each patient. Conclusion Early treatment with DOXY for high-risk patients with moderate to severe COVID-19 infections in non-hospital settings, such as LTCFs, is associated with early clinical recovery, decreased hospitalization, and decreased mortality.","Alam, Mohammud M; Mahmud, Saborny; Rahman, Mohammad M; Simpson, JoAnn; Aggarwal, Sandeep; Ahmed, Ziauddin",Cureus,293,26

This study assessed the appointment processes and terms for deans, directors, and chairs of schools and programs of public health and their views on term limits. METHODS: A 10-question survey was developed for the Association of Schools and Programs of Public Health and provided electronically to 127 deans and program directors in November and December 2019, of whom 58 (46%) responded. RESULTS: Of 54 respondents to the question on term limits, 45 deans and directors of schools and programs of public health served with no terms or limits and 9 served with terms of 3-5 years with no limits on the number of terms. Respondents largely agreed with most arguments for or against term limits. Of 51 respondents, most indicated completely or moderately valid support for 2 arguments for term limits: diversity (n = 40) and succession planning (n = 40). Of 51 respondents, most indicated completely or moderately valid support for 3 arguments against term limits: stable and continuous leadership (n = 40), time for leadership development (n = 37), and loss of institutional memory (n = 35). Twenty-seven of 53 responding deans and directors viewed the most appropriate terms and limits as being more restrictive than their current terms; the other 26 viewed the most appropriate terms as being the same as their current terms. No respondents preferred less restrictive limits than their current terms.

It also aimed to examine factors associated with sleep quality and its seven subcomponents: subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbance, use of sleeping medications, and daytime dysfunction. A descriptive, correlational, and cross-sectional study design was used. We performed descriptive, and regression analyses with a sample of 215 female staff nurses enrolled in post-licensure online nursing programs at a southeastern state university. Data collection was conducted using an online survey from April to May 2020. Sleep quality was measured using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Nurses working part time (p = 0.02), with lower perceived physical health (p = 0.01), a lower self-care self-regulation score (p < 0.001), and higher work stress (p < 0.05) showed poorer sleep quality. Factors associated with subcomponents of sleep quality varied. Poor sleep quality among nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic was reported. Various factors, including work environmental factors were associated with the sleep quality in this sample. Hospital administrators should consider developing intervention programs for improving the work environment, which would impact sleep quality, health status, and job performance.","Kim-Godwin, Yeoun Soo; Lee, Meen Hye; Logan, Jeongok G; Liu, Xiaoyue",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),293,20

Eat Well Saskatchewan (EWS), a free dietitian contact service in Saskatchewan, implemented a 16-week social media campaign (#eatwellcovid19) using a storytelling approach. This campaign allowed Saskatchewan residents to share their experiences on how they coped with food insecurity challenges during COVID-19 with others. Objectives: To describe implementation and evaluation of #eatwellcovid19 using social media analytics and qualitative interviews of campaign followers. Methods: EWS encouraged Saskatchewan residents to submit personal stories that demonstrated their own coping strategies in dealing with food security challenges during COVID-19. Each week, 1--3 stories were featured on EWS social media platforms (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram), along with social media posts featuring related evidence-based nutrition information. Social media metrics and semi-structured qualitative interviews of campaign followers were used to evaluate campaign impact. The interviews were analyzed using content analysis and NVivo. Results: EWS received 75 stories from Saskatchewan residents and 42 were featured on social media. Stories were on various topics (e.g., traditional food skills, gardening). On Facebook, the campaign reached 100,571 people, left 128,818 impressions and 9,575 engaged with posts. On Instagram, the campaign reached 11,310 people, and made 14,145 impressions. On Twitter, the campaign made 15,199 impressions and received 424 engagements. All EWS social media platforms saw an increase in followers during the campaign;Instagram's growth was the largest (+30%). Not including campaign posters promoted with paid advertising, featured story submission posts made the largest impact on all platforms (except Twitter), followed by supplemental content related to featured stories. Interview participants (n = 20) appreciated the positive, local and reliable content and stated the storytelling format helped them to feel connected to their community during social isolation. Conclusions: Storytelling appeared to be a successful approach for this campaign. Residents appreciated hearing local stories to help deal with food security concerns experienced during the pandemic. Significance: Social media health promotion campaigns are gaining popularity and have potential to reach large audiences and counteract nutrition misinformation. Storytelling is an approach dietitians could use when designing similar campaigns.

OBJECTIVE: This systematic review and meta-analysis summarized contemporary studies that report the use of Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) to treat COVID-19. SEARCH STRATEGY: Six electronic databases (PubMed/MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, ScienceDirect, Google Scholar, Wanfang Data and China National Knowledge Infrastructure) were searched from their beginning to May 15, 2020 with the following search terms: traditional Chinese medicine, Chinese medicine, Chinese herbal medicine, COVID-19, new coronavirus pneumonia, SARS-CoV-2, and randomized controlled trial. INCLUSION CRITERIA: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) from peer-reviewed journals and non-reviewed publications were included. Further, included RCTs had a control group that was given standard care (SC; such as conventional Western medicine treatments or routine medical care), and a treatment group that was given SC plus CHM. DATA EXTRACTION AND ANALYSIS: Two evaluators screened and collected literature independently; information on participants, study design, interventions, follow-up and adverse events were extracted, and risk of bias was assessed. The primary outcomes included scores that represented changes in symptoms and signs over the course of treatment. Secondary outcomes included the level of inflammatory markers, improvement of pneumonia confirmed by computed tomography (CT), and adverse events. Dichotomous data were expressed as risk ratio or hazard ratio with 95% confidence interval (CI); where time-to-event analysis was used, outcomes were expressed as odds ratio with 95% CI. Continuous data were expressed as difference in means (MD) with 95% CI, and standardized mean difference (SMD) was used when different outcome scales were pooled. RESULTS: Seven original studies, comprising a total of 732 adults, were included in this meta-analysis. Compared to SC alone, CHM plus SC had a superior effect on the change of symptom and sign score (-1.30 by SMD, 95% CI [-2.43, -0.16]; 3 studies; n = 261, P = 0.03), on inflammatory marker C-reactive protein (CRP, mg/L; -11.82 by MD, 95% CI [-17.95, -5.69]; 5 studies; n = 325, P = 0.0002), on number of patients with improved lung CT scans (1.34 by risk ratio, 95% CI [1.19, 1.51]; 4 studies; n = 489, P < 0.00001). No significant adverse events were recorded in the included RCTs. CONCLUSION: Current evidence shows that CHM, as an adjunct treatment with standard care, helps to improve treatment outcomes in COVID-19 cases.","Fan, Arthur Yin; Gu, Sherman; Alemi, Sarah Faggert",J Integr Med,293,16

This situation had the potential to lead to delays in diagnosis and treatment, which could result in an increase in severe cases and deaths. This analysis was based on findings from a field visit, carried out between June 30th and July 1st, 2020, to a warehouse, to two health facilities, and a meeting with a community health worker, and an descriptive epidemiologic data analysis of health information system (HIS) to evaluate trends of the number of people tested for malaria and number of malaria cases reported, by comparing data from 2018, 2019 and 2020 for the period between January and May. The two health facilities and the warehouse had about two months of stock of antimalarial drugs, and patients with malaria symptoms were being tested for malaria at the COVID-19 screening site. The HIS data showed that the number of reported malaria cases decreased by 3.0% (177.646/172.246) in April, and 7.0% (173.188/161.812) in May, when comparing 2019 and 2020 data. People tested for malaria in community increased by 39.0% (190.370/264.730), between 2019 and 2020. The COVID-19 may have had a negative impact on the diagnosis and treatment of malaria in health facility (HF).

The most frequent thyroid hormonal findings in patients with COVID-19, particularly in individuals with severe disease, are similar to those present in the non-thyroidal illness syndrome and require no intervention. Subacute thyroiditis has also been reported during COVID-19 infection. Diagnosis and treatment of hypothyroidism during the COVID-19 pandemic may follow usual practice; however, should avoid frequent laboratory tests in patients with previous controlled disease. Well-controlled hypo and hyperthyroidism are not associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 infection or severity. Newly diagnosed hyperthyroidism during the pandemic should be preferably treated with antithyroid drugs (ATDs), bearing in mind the possibility of rare side effects with these medications, particularly agranulocytosis, which requires immediate intervention. Definitive treatment of hyperthyroidism (radioiodine therapy or surgery) may be considered in those cases that protective protocols can be followed to avoid COVID-19 contamination or once the pandemic is over. In patients with moderate Graves' ophthalmopathy (GO) not at risk of visual loss, glucocorticoids at immunosuppressive doses should be avoided, while in those with severe GO without COVID-19 and at risk of vision loss, intravenous glucocorticoid is the therapeutic choice. Considering that most of the thyroid cancer cases are low risk and associated with an excellent prognosis, surgical procedures could and should be postponed safely during the pandemic period. Additionally, when indicated, radioiodine therapy could also be safely postponed as long as it is possible.","Martins, João Roberto M; Villagelin, Danilo G P; Carvalho, Gisah A; Vaisman, Fernanda; Teixeira, Patrícia F S; Scheffel, Rafael S; Sgarbi, José A",Arch. endocrinol. metab.

(Special Section: COVID-19.),20.011528,2.7780256,2020,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Covid-19, initially described as a respiratory system's infection, is currently more and more recognized as a multiorganic disease, including neurological manifestations. There is growing evidence about a potential neuroinvasive role of SARS-CoV-2. The purpose of this study is to describe new findings, in the form of cerebral microbleeds affecting different brain structures, observed in MRIs of critically ill patients. METHODS: For this purpose, the MR images of 9 patients with a common pattern of abnormal findings (2 women/7 men; 55-79 years of age; mean age: 67.7 years) were depicted. All patients were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and presented with delayed recovery of consciousness or important agitation, requiring brain MRI. RESULTS: All patients had suffered from severe (5/9) or moderate (4/9) acute respiratory distress syndrome, requiring prolonged stay in the intensive care unit. Their common MRI finding was the presence of microbleeds in unusual distribution with a specific predilection for the corpus callosum. Other uncommon locations of microbleeds were the internal capsule (5/9), as well as middle cerebellar peduncles (5/9). Subcortical regions were also affected in the majority of patients. CONCLUSIONS: Brain MRI raised evidence that Covid-19 or its related treatment may involve the brain with an unusual pattern of microbleeds, predominantly affecting the corpus callosum. The mechanism of this finding is still unclear but the differential diagnosis should include thrombotic microangiopathy related to direct or indirect-through the cytokine cascade-damage by the SARS-CoV-2 on the endothelium of brain's vessels, as well as mechanisms similar to the hypoxemia brain-blood-barrier injury.","Fitsiori, Aikaterini; Pugin, Deborah; Thieffry, Camille; Lalive, Patrice; Vargas, Maria Isabel",J Neuroimaging,293,1

We report results from a longitudinal survey of United States residents during six months (March 16 -August 16, 2020) of the COVID-19 pandemic. Contrary to past research suggesting that the increased salience of a disease threat should improve attitudes toward vaccines, we observed a decrease in intentions of getting a COVID-19 vaccine when one becomes available. We further found a decline in general vaccine attitudes and intentions of getting the influenza vaccine. Analyses of heterogeneity indicated that this decline is driven by participants who identify as Republicans, who showed a negative trend in vaccine attitudes and intentions, whereas Democrats remained largely stable. Consistent with research on risk perception and behavior, those with less favorable attitudes toward a COVID-19 vaccination also perceived the virus to be less threatening.

For low overall infection levels in the population the pooling of samples can drastically amplify the testing capacity. Here we present a formula to estimate the optimal group-size for pooling, the efficiency gain (tested persons per test), and the expected upper bound of missed infections in pooled testing, all as a function of the population-wide infection levels and the false negative/positive rates of the currently used PCR tests. Assuming an infection level of 0.1% and a false negative rate of 2%, the optimal pool-size is about 34, and an efficiency gain of about 15 tested persons per test is possible. For an infection level of 1% the optimal pool-size is 11, the efficiency gain is 5.1 tested persons per test. For an infection level of 10% the optimal pool-size reduces to about 4, the efficiency gain is about 1.7 tested persons per test. For infection levels of 30% and higher there is no more benefit from pooling.

Information regarding the incidences and implications of arrhythmias in COVID-19 is limited. METHODS: A total of 463 patients with COVID-19 and who had at least one electrocardiogram recording from February 1 to March 19, 2020, in Wuhan Union Hospital were enrolled in the study. RESULTS: Arrhythmias occurred in 85 of 463 (18.4%) patients: atrial arrhythmias in 10.2%, junctional arrhythmias in 0.2%, ventricular arrhythmias in 3.5%, and conduction block in 7.3%. Compared with patients without arrhythmias, those with arrhythmias had higher mortality, both during the time from symptom onset (p < 0.001) and from admission to follow-up (p < 0.001). The frequencies of severe COVID-19 (44.7% vs. 21.2%; p < 0.001) and death (25.9% vs. 10.1%; p < 0.001) were higher in patients with arrhythmias than in those without arrhythmias. Atrial arrhythmias and ventricular arrhythmias could predict severity and mortality, their odds ratios (OR) were 4.45 (95% confidence interval [CI] 2.35 to 8.40), 5.80 (95% CI 1.89 to 17.76) respectively for severity, and were 3.51 (95% CI 1.74 to 7.08), 3.41 (95% CI 1.13 to 10.24) respectively for mortality. High levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-10 were associated with the occurrence of arrhythmias (all p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Arrhythmias were significantly associated with COVID-19 severity and mortality. Atrial arrhythmia was the most frequent arrhythmia type. IL-6 and IL-10 levels can predict the risk of arrhythmias in COVID-19 patients.","Guan, Hongquan; Liu, Jie; Ding, Jiaxing; Liu, Wei; Feng, Yu; Bao, Yintu; Li, Huili; Wang, Xuehua; Zhou, Zihua; Chen, Zhijian",J Electrocardiol,293,29

Through a meta-analysis of different enriched features from these gene modules, we extract communities of highly interconnected features. These clusters of higher-order features, working as a multifeatured machine, enable collective assessment of their contribution for disease or phenotype characterization.

Seeking for the input data homogeneity, we analyze single-stranded RNA viruses only. Two approaches are used to obtain the nucleotide sequences; In the first one, chunks of equal length (four nucleotides) are considered. In the second approach, the whole RNA genome is divided into parts by adenine or the most frequent nucleotide as a ""space"". Rank-frequency distributions are studied in both cases. The defined nucleotide sequences are signs comparable to a certain extent to syllables or words as seen from the nature of their rank-frequency distributions. Within the first approach, the Pólya and the negative hypergeometric distribution yield the best fit. For the distributions obtained within the second approach, we have calculated a set of parameters, including entropy, mean sequence length, and its dispersion. The calculated parameters became the basis for the classification of viruses. We observed that proximity of viruses on planes spanned on various pairs of parameters corresponds to related species. In certain cases, such a proximity is observed for unrelated species as well calling thus for the expansion of the set of parameters used in the classification. We also observed that the fifth most frequent nucleotide sequences obtained within the second approach are of different nature in case of human coronaviruses (different nucleotides for MERS, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 versus identical nucleotides for four other coronaviruses). We expect that our findings will be useful as a supplementary tool in the classification of diseases caused by RNA viruses with respect to severity and contagiousness.","Husev, Mykola; Rovenchak, Andrij",Biosemiotics,293,22

ObjectiveAssessing the BNT162b2 vaccine effectiveness in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection given high-risk exposure, through analysis of household members of confirmed cases. DesignRetrospective cohort study. Data of household members of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases between 20/12/2020 and 17/03/2021 were collected. SettingNationally centralized database of Maccabi Healthcare Services (MHS), the second largest Healthcare Maintenance Organization in Israel. Participants2.5 million MHS members were considered, of which we included only households with two adult members, given possible lower transmission and susceptibility among children. Households with no prior confirmed infections and a confirmed index case during the study period were included. ExposureParticipants were classified into three vaccination groups in time of the index case (the confirmed exposure)-Unvaccinated; Fully Vaccinated(7 or more days post second dose) and a reference control group of Recently Vaccinated Once(0-7 days from the first dose, presumably still unprotected). Main Outcomes and MeasuresAssessing the probability of an additional SARS-CoV-2 infection in the household occurring within 10 days of an index case, calculated separately for the three vaccination groups. Main outcome was vaccine effectiveness given confirmed exposure. High testing rates among household members enabled us to estimate with a high degree of confidence effectiveness against asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection as well. ResultsA total of 173,569 households were included, out of which 6,351 households had an index infection (mean [SD] age, 58.9 [13.5] years; 50% were women). Vaccine effectiveness of Fully Vaccinated compared to Unvaccinated participants was 80.0% [95% CI, 73.0-85.1] and 82.0% [95% CI, 75.5-86.7] compared to those Recently Vaccinated Once. Conclusion and RelevanceThe BNT162b2 vaccine is effective in a high-risk, real life, exposure scenario, but the protection rates afforded in these settings are lower than those previously described. Household members of COVID-19 patients and any individual with a confirmed exposure to COVID-19 are still at a considerable risk of being infected even if fully vaccinated.","Gazit, Sivan; Mizrahi, Barak; Kalkstein, Nir; Neuberger, Ami; Peretz, Asaf; Mizrahi-Reuveni, Miri; Patalon, Tal",,293,1

This study aimed to describe HH compliance measurement and explore observed influencing factors with respect to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) guidelines in China. METHODS: Compliance was measured as the percentage of compliant opportunities based on criteria for 17 moments. The criteria for compliance included HH behavior, procedure, duration, hand drying method, and the overall that counts them all. The observed influencing factors included different departments and areas and protection motivation. Descriptive analysis and logistic regression were performed. RESULTS: The compliance of overall criteria, HH behavior, procedure, duration, and hand drying method were 79.44%, 96.71%, 95.74%, 88.93%, and 88.42%, respectively, which were significantly different from each other (P < .001).

The response strategy has involved implementing measures like social distancing, and care delivery modalities like telemedicine have been promoted to reduce the risk of transmission. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to analyze the benefits of using telemedicine services for patients with chronic liver disease (CLD) at a tertiary care center in Italy during the COVID-19-mandated lockdown. METHODS: From March 9 to May 3, 2020, a prospective observational study was conducted in the Liver Unit of the University Hospital of Naples Federico II to evaluate the impact of (1) a fully implemented telemedicine program, partially restructured in response to COVID-19 to include video consultations; (2) extended hours of operation for helpline services; and (3) smart-working from home to facilitate follow-up visits for patients with CLD while adhering to social distancing regulations. RESULTS: During the lockdown in Italy, almost 400 visits were conducted using telemedicine; only patients requiring urgent care were admitted to a non-COVID-19 ward of our hospital. Telemedicine services were implemented not only for follow-up visits but also to screen patients prior to hospital admission and to provide urgent evaluations during complications. Of the nearly 1700 patients with CLD who attended a follow-up visit at our Liver Unit, none contracted COVID-19, and there was no need to alter treatment schedules. CONCLUSIONS: Telemedicine was a useful tool for following up patients with CLD and for reducing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. This system of health care delivery was appreciated by patients since it gave them the opportunity to be in contact with physicians while respecting social distancing rules.","Guarino, Maria; Cossiga, Valentina; Fiorentino, Andrea; Pontillo, Giuseppina; Morisco, Filomena",J Med Internet Res,293,12

Currently, there are no effective medications against coronavirus. In the present study, we utilized a holistic bioinformatics approach to study gene signatures of SARS-CoV- and SARS-CoV-2-infected Calu-3 lung adenocarcinoma cells. Through the Gene Ontology platform, we determined that several cytokine genes were up-regulated after SARS-CoV-2 infection, including TNF, IL6, CSF2, IFNL1, IL-17C, CXCL10, and CXCL11. Differentially regulated pathways were detected by the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes, gene ontology, and Hallmark platform, including chemokines, cytokines, cytokine receptors, cytokine metabolism, inflammation, immune responses, and cellular responses to the virus. A Venn diagram was utilized to illustrate common overlapping genes from SARS-CoV- and SARS-CoV-2-infected datasets. An Ingenuity pathway analysis discovered an enrichment of tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-) and interleukin (IL)-17-related signaling in a gene set enrichment analysis. Downstream networks were predicted by the Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery platform also revealed that TNF and TNF receptor 2 signaling elicited leukocyte recruitment, activation, and survival of host cells after coronavirus infection. Our discovery provides essential evidence for transcript regulation and downstream signaling of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Cheng, Li-Chin; Kao, Tzu-Jen; Phan, Nam Nhut; Chiao, Chung-Chieh; Yen, Meng-Chi; Chen, Chien-Fu; Hung, Jui-Hsiang; Jiang, Jia-Zhen; Sun, Zhengda; Wang, Chih-Yang; Hsu, Hui-Ping",Medicine (Baltimore),293,1

Enforcement of the order was tightened progressively, resulting in significant improvement of compliance, while other interventions such as tracking of potential contacts and medical screening were underway, and the media continued to provide updates and general advices. The numbers of new and active Covid-19 cases started showing evident downtrends from mid-April, thus indicating the effectiveness of movement control and its compliance. Conclusion: The article provides insight into crucial factors contributing to the success of movement control to effectively contain Covid-19, and highlights the need to prevent future upsurge through continuous monitoring and enforcement.","Tang, Kuok Ho Daniel",Z Gesundh Wiss,293,2

I examine changes in the concentrations of bacteria, oxygen, lead, and sulphate at the terminus of the Mississippi River before and after these pollution abatement efforts. Microbial concentrations increased or were stable from 1909 to 1980 but decreased about 3 orders of magnitude after the 1970s, while the average oxygen content increased. A large decline in lead concentration occurred after the 1960s, along with a less dramatic decline in sulphate concentrations. The pH of the river dropped to a low of 5.8 in 1965 as sulfur dioxide emissions peaked and averaged 8.2 in 2019 after emissions declined.

After two outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) occurred in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, from March–June 2003, we reviewed the unexpected role and responsibilities of pharmacists during these two crises, and present strategies for better crisis preparedness. Methods and Results. Pharmacists were actively involved in battling the SARS crises. After conducting extensive literature searches and evaluations, pharmacists prepared administration and dosing guidelines for the two investigational drugs, ribavirin and interferon alfacon‐1, that were being used to treat the syndrome. They provided direct patient care under modified conditions. They revised drug distribution procedures and developed new ones to meet more stringent infection‐control standards. Collaborative teamwork with key stakeholders was important in accomplishing tasks in an efficient and timely manner. Regular communication with health care staff took place internally and externally. Education and updated information for pharmacists was crucial. Conclusion. Pharmacists can play a vital role during crises in the areas of drug distribution, drug information, and direct patient care. Collaborative teamwork and close communication are keys to success. Pharmacists must be proactive and take a leadership role in assuming pharmacy‐related responsibilities. By evaluating what worked and what didn't, pharmacists can develop procedures for future crises requiring pharmacy support.","Chin, Thomas W.

The family Nodaviridae, whose members are non-enveloped, positive-stranded bipartite RNA viruses, is comprised of the genera Alphanodavirus and Betanodavirus, whose members predominantly infect insects and fish, respectively. The alphanodaviruses can also infect suckling mice and suckling hamsters, resulting in paralysis and death. Pigs near the site of isolation of the Nodamura virus (NoV), an alphanodavirus, have been reported to have high levels of NoV neutralizing antibody, suggesting that they may be part of the natural host range of this virus. Betanodaviruses are the causative agents of viral nervous necrosis, which occurs in several species of fish. However, little is known regarding the mechanism of infection of these viruses. Whether betanodaviruses can infect hosts other than fish remains unclear. In this study, we examined the possibility that a betanodavirus, redspotted grouper nervous necrosis virus (RGNNV), can infect human cell lines and showed that this virus can attach to the cells but cannot penetrate them, although human cells can support the replication of the betanodavirus when viral RNAs are transfected. The betanodavirus in its present form cannot infect human cells.","Adachi, K.; Ichinose, T.; Watanabe, K.; Kitazato, K.; Kobayashi, N.",Arch Virol,293,14

OBJECTIVE: Determine whether medical mask use by sick individuals with ILI protects well contacts from related respiratory infections. SETTING: 6 major hospitals in 2 districts of Beijing, China. DESIGN: Cluster randomised controlled trial. PARTICIPANTS: 245 index cases with ILI. INTERVENTION: Index cases with ILI were randomly allocated to medical mask (n=123) and control arms (n=122). Since 43 index cases in the control arm also used a mask during the study period, an as-treated post hoc analysis was performed by comparing outcomes among household members of index cases who used a mask (mask group) with household members of index cases who did not use a mask (no-mask group). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Primary outcomes measured in household members were clinical respiratory illness, ILI and laboratory-confirmed viral respiratory infection. RESULTS: In an intention-to-treat analysis, rates of clinical respiratory illness (relative risk (RR) 0.61, 95% CI 0.18 to 2.13), ILI (RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.03 to 3.13) and laboratory-confirmed viral infections (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.06 to 15.54) were consistently lower in the mask arm compared with control, although not statistically significant. A post hoc comparison between the mask versus no-mask groups showed a protective effect against clinical respiratory illness, but not against ILI and laboratory-confirmed viral respiratory infections. CONCLUSIONS: The study indicates a potential benefit of medical masks for source control, but is limited by small sample size and low secondary attack rates. Larger trials are needed to confirm efficacy of medical masks as source control.

The aim of our study was to study its impact on activity related to emergencies in hand and upper limb trauma in comparison to the same reference period in 2019. MATERIAL AND METHODS: All consecutive patients consulting for upper limb injury requiring urgent care at Georges-Pompidou European Hospital (HEGP), France, during the lockdown period (case group) and the equivalent period in 2019 (control group) were included. In each group, the type of accident, the anatomical location of the injury, and the treatment were reported and compared. RESULTS: Two hundred seventy-five patients were included in the case group in comparison to 784 patients in the control group. We observed a two-third decrease in the rate of upper limb emergencies (− 64.9%) in particular a drastic drop in the rate of road, work, and leisure accidents (10.4% vs 14.3%, p = 0.1151; 10.0% vs 22.6%, p < 0.0001; 13.1% vs 30.8%, p < 0.0001, respectively), and a clear increase in domestic accidents (66.5% vs 32.3%, p < 0.0001). The aetiologies were more dominated by lacerations of soft tissues (48.4%, vs 38.3%, p = 0.0034) and infections (8.7% vs 5.1%, p = 0.0299) with an increase in the indications for surgical management (51.2% vs 36.9%, p < 0.0001). Conversely, we observed fewer consultations for joint injuries (20.7% vs 30.7%, p = 0.0015) and fractures (22.2% vs 25.9%, p = 0.2210).

The relatively new EN 16615 simulates disinfection by wiping and allows for assessing the recovery of microorganisms from the surface and, importantly, the degree of spread of microorganisms when the surface is disinfected by wiping. For the first time, using this standard, the tested products in the form of commercial disinfectant wipes were compared with self-made wipes soaked in respective disinfectant liquids. The disinfected surfaces were simulated by homogeneous polyvinyl chloride plates. The studies were carried out not only with the standard, but also with clinical multidrug-resistant microbial strains. Based on the research, it can be concluded that the most effective products in the disinfection process (log(10) reduction of ≥5) with the shortest contact time (1 min) were products containing ethanol, propanol, and quaternary ammonium compounds (self-made wipes) and propanol (commercial wipes). The least effective products (log(10) reduction of <5) in terms of the contact time declared by the manufacturer were products containing ethanol and sodium hypochlorite (commercial wipes).

Complementing this work, here, we report on the social patterning of self-reported positive changes experienced during COVID-19 national lockdown in Scotland. Methods: The CATALYST study collected data from 3342 adults in Scotland during weeks 9-12 of a national lockdown. Participants completed an online questionnaire providing data on key sociodemographic and health variables, and completed a measure of positive change. The positive change measure spanned diverse domains (e.g., more quality time with family, developing new hobbies, more physical activity, and better quality of sleep). We used univariate analysis and stepwise regression to examine the contribution of a range of sociodemographic factors (e.g., age, gender, ethnicity, educational attainment, and employment status) in explaining positive change. Results: There were clear sociodemographic differences across positive change scores. Those reporting higher levels of positive change were female, from younger age groups, married or living with their partner, employed, and in better health. Conclusion: Overall our results highlight the social patterning of positive changes during lockdown in Scotland. These findings begin to illuminate the complexity of the unanticipated effects of national lockdown and will be used to support future intervention development work sharing lessons learned from lockdown to increase positive health change amongst those who may benefit.","Williams, Lynn; Rollins, Lesley; Young, David; Fleming, Leanne; Grealy, Madeleine; Janssen, Xanne; Kirk, Alison; MacDonald, Bradley; Flowers, Paul",,293,1

The model simulates the balance sheets of insurance firms, who collect premiums from clients in return for insuring them against intermittent, heavy-tailed risks. Firms manage their capital and pay dividends to their investors and use either reinsurance contracts or cat bonds to hedge their tail risk. The model generates plausible time series of profits and losses and recovers stylized facts, such as the insurance cycle and the emergence of asymmetric firm size distributions. We use the model to investigate the problem of risk model homogeneity. Under the European regulatory framework Solvency II, insurance companies are required to use only certified risk models. This has led to a situation in which only a few firms provide risk models, creating a systemic fragility to the errors in these models. We demonstrate that using too few models increases the risk of nonpayment and default while lowering profits for the industry as a whole. The presence of the reinsurance industry ameliorates the problem but does not remove it. Our results suggest that it would be valuable for regulators to incentivize model diversity. The framework we develop here provides a first step toward a simulation model of the insurance industry, which could be used to test policies and strategies for capital management.","Heinrich, Torsten; Sabuco, Juan; Farmer, J.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 120 fecal samples were collected from enterotoxemia suspected lambs were used for screening of C. perfringens cpa gene by LAMP. The specificity of the LAMP amplified products was tested by digesting with restriction enzyme XmnI for alpha toxin gene. RESULTS: Out of 120 samples screened 112 (93.3%) samples were positive by both LAMP and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for detection of cpa gene which indicated the equal sensitivity of both the tests. The enzyme produced single cut in 162 base pair amplified product of alpha toxin gene at 81 base pair resulting in a single band in gel electrophoresis. CONCLUSION: Both LAMP and PCR for detection of cpa gene indicated the equal sensitivity of both the tests. Standardization of LAMP reaction for amplification of epsilon and beta toxin genes will help to identify the C. perfringens toxin types from the clinical samples. The test could be a suitable alternative to the PCR in detection of toxin types without the help of sophisticated machinery like thermal cycler.

We hypothesised that vuvuzelas might facilitate the generation and dissemination of respiratory aerosols. To investigate the quantity and size of aerosols emitted when the instrument is played, eight healthy volunteers were asked to blow a vuvuzela. For each individual the concentration of particles in expelled air was measured using a six channel laser particle counter and the duration of blowing and velocity of air leaving the vuvuzela were recorded. To allow comparison with other activities undertaken at sports events each individual was also asked to shout and the measurements were repeated while using a paper cone to confine the exhaled air. Triplicate measurements were taken for each individual. The mean peak particle counts were 658×10(3) per litre for the vuvuzela and 3.7×10(3) per litre for shouting, representing a mean log(10) difference of 2.20 (95% CI: 2.03,2.36; p<0.001). The majority (>97%) of particles captured from either the vuvuzela or shouting were between 0.5 and 5 microns in diameter. Mean peak airflows recorded for the vuvuzela and shouting were 6.1 and 1.8 litres per second respectively. We conclude that plastic blowing horns (vuvuzelas) have the capacity to propel extremely large numbers of aerosols into the atmosphere of a size able to penetrate the lower lung. Some respiratory pathogens are spread via contaminated aerosols emitted by infected persons.

To limit the viral spread, prompt and precise diagnosis is crucial to facilitate treatment and ensure effective isolation. Accurate detection of antibodies (IgG and IgM) is imperative to understand the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in public and to inspect the proportion of immune individuals. In this review, we demonstrate and evaluate some tests which have been used commonly to detect SARS-CoV-2. These include nucleic acid tests and serological tests for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA and specific antibodies in infected people. Moreover, the vitality of biosensing technologies emphasizing on optical and electrochemical biosensors towards the detection of SARS-CoV-2 has also been discussed here. The early diagnosis of COVID-19 based on detection of reactive oxygen species (ROS) overproduction owing to virus induced dysfunctioning of lung cells has also been highlighted.","Aziz, Ayesha; Asif, Muhammad; Ashraf, Ghazala; Farooq, Umer; Yang, Qiaoli; Wang, Shenqi",Curr Opin Colloid Interface Sci,293,19

Outbreaks in different parts of the globe are shaped by repeated introductions of new lineages and subsequent local transmission of those lineages. Here, we sequenced 3940 SARS-CoV-2 viral genomes from Washington State to characterize how the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Washington State (USA) was shaped by differences in timing of mitigation strategies across counties, as well as by repeated introductions of viral lineages into the state. Additionally, we show that the increase in frequency of a potentially more transmissible viral variant (614G) over time can potentially be explained by regional mobility differences and multiple introductions of 614G, but not the other variant (614D) into the state. At an individual level, we see evidence of higher viral loads in patients infected with the 614G variant. However, using clinical records data, we do not find any evidence that the 614G variant impacts clinical severity or patient outcomes.

MethodsAn online national cross-sectional pilot-validated questionnaire was self-administered by HCW in Saudi Arabia, a nation with MERS-CoV experience. The main outcome variable was HCWs acceptance of COVID-19 vaccine candidates. The associated factors of vaccination acceptance were identified through a logistic regression analysis and the level of anxiety using generalized anxiety disorder 7. ResultOut of 1512 HCWs who completed the study questionnaire--944 (62.4%) women and 568 (37.6%) men--1058 (70%) were willing to receive COVID-19 vaccines. Logistic regression analysis revealed that male HCWs (ORa=1.551, 95% CI: 1.122-2.144), HCWs who believe in vaccine safety (ORa=2.151; 95% CI:1.708-2.708), HCWs who believe that COVID vaccines are the most likely way to stop the pandemic (ORa=1.539; 95% CI: 1.259-1.881), and HCWs who rely on Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website for COVID 19 updates (ORa=1.505, 95% CI: 1.125-2.013) were significantly associated with reporting willingness to be vaccinated. However, HCWs who believed vaccines were rushed without evidence-informed testing were found to be 60% less inclined to accept COVID-19 vaccines (ORa=0.394, 95% CI: 0.298- 0.522).

Condensation of peracetylated 3-deoxy-3-fluoro-d-glucopyranose (1) with silylated N(4)-benzoyl cytosine, followed by selective deprotection and isopropylidenation afforded compound 2. Routine deoxygenation at position 2′, followed by a deprotection-selective reprotection sequence afforded the partially tritylated dideoxy nucleoside of cytosine 6, which upon oxidation of the free hydroxyl group at the 4′-position, furnished the desired tritylated 2,3-dideoxy-3-fluoro ketonucleoside 7a in equilibrium with its hydrated form 7b. Compound 2 was the starting material for the synthesis of the dideoxy fluoro ketopyranonucleoside 13a. Similarly, several subsequent protection and deprotection steps as well as routine deoxygenation at position 4′, followed by oxidation of the free hydroxyl group at the 2′-position of the partially tritylated dideoxy nucleoside 12, yielded the desired carbonyl compound 13a in equilibrium with its hydrated form 13b. Finally, trityl removal from 7a/b and 13a/b provided the unprotected 2,3-dideoxy-3-fluoro-4-keto and 3,4-dideoxy-3-fluoro-2-ketopyranonucleoside analogues 8a and 14a, in equilibrium with their gem-diol forms 8b and 14b. None of the compounds showed inhibitory activity against a wide variety of DNA and RNA viruses at subtoxic concentrations, except 7a/b that was highly efficient against rotavirus infection.

Although centers maintained telephone contact, it quickly became evident that parents needed more detailed advice and guidance. Staff from 30 daycare centers volunteered to take part in a two-month online support and training course for 336 caregivers of children with ASD of different ages. In addition to the provision of visual and written information, synchronous video sessions were used to coach parents on the learning goals devised for the children. Both qualitative and quantitative data were collected to understand the acceptability of using telepractice and the outcomes achieved. A low dropout rate and positive feedback from parents indicated that they perceived telepractice sessions to be useful. The factors contributing to parents’ satisfaction were identified. Although the use of telepractice would be a good alternative for caregivers in any future lockdowns, it could also be used in conjunction with daycare center services to encourage greater parental participation, or with families living in areas with no day centers.

After SARS-CoV-2 infection, cardio-pulmonary complications can occur and, before the resumption of sports competitions, a screening has been recommended. However, few data are available and discrepancies exist in the screening modalities. We conducted this prospective study to investigate the incidence of cardiovascular consequences following SARS-CoV-2 infection in young adult competitive athletes and the appropriate screening strategies for a safe return-to-play. METHODS: Ninety competitive athletes (24 ± 10 years) after asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection were screened by physical examination, blood testing, spirometry, 12‑lead resting ECG, 24-h ambulatory ECG monitoring, echocardiogram, and cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET). RESULTS: Sixty-four athletes (71.1%) were male, and most (76.7%) were mildly symptomatic. After SARS-CoV-2 infection, spirometry and resting ECG were normal in all athletes. Ambulatory ECG monitoring demonstrated <50/24 h supraventricular and ventricular premature beats in 53.3% and 52.2% of athletes, respectively, in the absence of malignant arrhythmias. CPET did not demonstrate cardiopulmonary limitations. Echocardiography showed pericardial effusion in 3 athletes (all females) with symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection (3.3%; 4.4% in the symptomatic group) with a definitive diagnosis of myopericarditis in 1 athlete (1.1%) and pericarditis in 2 athletes (2.2%). CONCLUSIONS: Cardiac consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection were found in 3.3% of competitive athletes. An appropriate screening primarily based on the detection of uncommon arrhythmias and cardiac symptoms should be recommended in competitive athletes after SARS-CoV-2 infection to detect a cardiac involvement and guarantee a safe return-to-play.","Cavigli, Luna; Frascaro, Federica; Turchini, Francesca; Mochi, Nicola; Sarto, Patrizio; Bianchi, Stefano; Parri, Antonio; Carraro, Nicolò; Valente, Serafina; Focardi, Marta; Cameli, Matteo; Bonifazi, Marco; D'Ascenzi, Flavio",Int J Cardiol,293,28

There is an ongoing discussion whether the clinical presentation and ventilatory parameters are the same as typical ARDS or not. There is no clear understanding of how the hemodynamic parameters have been affected in COVID-19 ARDS patients. We aimed to compare hemodynamic and respiratory parameters of moderate and severe COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 ARDS patients. These patients were monitored with an advanced hemodynamic measurement system by the transpulmonary thermodilution method in prone and supine positions. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data of 17 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and 16 patients diagnosed with other types of diseases with moderate and severe ARDS, mechanically ventilated, placed in a prone position, had advanced hemodynamic measurements with PiCCO, and stayed in the intensive care unit for more than a week were analyzed retrospectively. Patient characteristics and arterial blood gases analysis recorded at admission and respiratory and advanced hemodynamic parameters during the first week were compared in prone and supine positions. RESULTS: No difference was observed in the respiratory parameters including respiratory system compliance between COVID-19 and non-COVD-19 patients in prone and supine positions. In comparison of advanced hemodynamic parameters in the first week of intensive care, the extravascular lung water and pulmonary vascular permeability indexes measured in supine position of COVID-19 ARDS patients were found to be significantly higher than non-COVID-19 patients. Duration of prone position was significantly longer in patients diagnosed with COVID-19 ARDS. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggested that COVID-19 ARDS is a variant of typical ARDS with a different pathophysiology.

Furthermore, PPE for the eyes and mouth, such as face shields, allow for additional protection when working with aerosols. 3-D printing enables the easy and rapid production of lightweight plastic frameworks based on open-source data. The practicality and clinical suitability of four face shields printed using a fused deposition modeling printer were examined. The weight, printing time, and required tools for assembly were evaluated. To assess the clinical suitability, each face shield was worn for one hour by 10 clinicians and rated using a visual analogue scale. The filament weight (21–42 g) and printing time (1:40–3:17 h) differed significantly between the four frames. Likewise, the fit, wearing comfort, space for additional PPE, and protection varied between the designs. For clinical suitability, a chosen design should allow sufficient space for goggles and N95 respirators as well as maximum coverage of the facial area. Consequently, two datasets are recommended. For the final selection of the ideal dataset to be used for printing, scalability and economic efficiency need to be carefully balanced with an acceptable degree of protection.","Wesemann, Christian; Pieralli, Stefano; Fretwurst, Tobias; Nold, Julian; Nelson, Katja; Schmelzeisen, Rainer; Hellwig, Elmar; Spies, Benedikt Christopher",Materials (Basel),293,30

Pharmacy practice in Saudi Arabia is emerging in recent years with greater policy emphasis on pharmacists taking new clinical roles. This study aimed to explore the experiences, perceptions and barriers of Saudi pharmacists about their uptake of non-traditional roles using Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF). METHODS: A qualitative semi-structured study using face-to-face or telephone interviews were conducted. Eligible participants included qualified pharmacists from Saudi Arabia. Interviews focused on pharmacist’s perceptions, current opportunities and key challenges towards the uptake of non-traditional roles. Interviews were audiotaped and transcribed verbatim. Results were analysed through the framework analysis method and were later mapped with respective domains of TDF. RESULTS: A total of 14 pharmacists completed the interview (9 females and 5 males). Participants showed an overall positive attitude towards the uptake of non-traditional roles. Participants felt that there was wider support available for pharmacists at the policy level to uptake non-traditional roles. However, a need for greater recognition of roles by other healthcare professionals and patients were identified. Participants alluded to reluctance of some physicians to take on board the suggestions from a pharmacist. Key barriers to uptake of non-traditional roles were related to environmental context and resources domain of TDF. For example, participants discussed the need for even further practical experiences during their undergraduate degree to become ready to adopt non-traditional roles in clinical practice. CONCLUSIONS: Participants of this theoretically informed qualitative study showed an overall positive attitude towards the way pharmacy practice is progressing in Saudi Arabia and their uptake of non-traditional roles. However, there is a need to improve interdisciplinary working, patient awareness of pharmacist competencies and their educational preparedness in furthering their uptake of non-traditional roles. Addressing such barriers and promoting uptake of novel roles by pharmacists is imperative in the context of emerging COVID-19 and future pandemics.","Mohammed, Eeman; Khanal, Saval; Jalal, Zahraa; Cheema, Ejaz; Abutaleb, Mohammed H.; Paudyal, Vibhu",J Pharm Policy Pract,293,10

As in other chronic diseases, ME/CFS evolves through different stages, from asymptomatic predisposition, progressing to a prodromal stage, and then to symptomatic disease. Disease incidence depends on genetic makeup and environment factors, the exposure to singular or repeated insults, and the nature of the host response. In people who develop ME/CFS, normal homeostatic processes in response to adverse insults may be replaced by aberrant responses leading to dysfunctional states. Thus, the predominantly neuro-immune manifestations, underlined by a hyper-metabolic state, that characterize early disease, may be followed by various processes leading to multi-systemic abnormalities and related symptoms. This abnormal state and the effects of a range of mediators such as products of oxidative and nitrosamine stress, may lead to progressive cell and metabolic dysfunction culminating in a hypometabolic state with low energy production. These processes do not seem to happen uniformly; although a spiraling of progressive inter-related and self-sustaining abnormalities may ensue, reversion to states of milder abnormalities is possible if the host is able to restate responses to improve homeostatic equilibrium. With time variation in disease presentation, no single ME/CFS case description, set of diagnostic criteria, or molecular feature is currently representative of all patients at different disease stages. While acknowledging its limitations due to the incomplete research evidence, we suggest the proposed framework may support future research design and health care interventions for people with ME/CFS.","Nacul, Luis; O'Boyle, Shennae; Palla, Luigi; Nacul, Flavio E.; Mudie, Kathleen; Kingdon, Caroline C.; Cliff, Jacqueline M.; Clark, Taane G.; Dockrell, Hazel M.; Lacerda, Eliana M.",Front Neurol,293,20

This study aimed to examine whether emergency departments (EDs) also recorded a rise in mental health presentations. METHOD: Changes in the number, and type, of mental health presentations to Western Australia EDs were examined between January and May 2020, and compared to 2019. RESULTS: Data showed an unexpected decrease in the number of mental health presentations, compared to 2019, which was temporally coincident with the rise in local COVID-19 cases. Presentations for anxiety and panic symptoms, and social and behavioural issues, increased by 11.1% and 6.5%, respectively, but suicidal and self-harm behaviours decreased by 26%. CONCLUSION: A rise in local COVID-19 cases was associated with a decrease in mental health presentations to EDs.

For this reason, numerous guidelines have been developed for delirium recognition, prevention and management across different countries and disciplines. Although research is adduced as evidence for these guidelines, a constant finding is the lack of implementation if they exist at all. Implementation is a human behaviour that can be influenced by various factors including culture at a micro- and macro-level. Hofstede’s model proposes that national cultures vary along six consistent dimensions. AIM: Using this model, we examined the nature of delirium guidelines across countries in relation to Hofstede’s six cultural dimensions. METHODS: Data collected for each country on: the six dimensions of Hofstede’s model, number of delirium guidelines approved by a National professional body of each country (through searching databases), the annual old-age dependency ratio for each country. RESULTS: Sixty-four countries had the completed six dimensions of Hofstede’s model. Twenty of them (31%) had one or more delirium guidelines. The total number of different delirium guidelines was 45. Countries with formal delirium guidelines have significantly lower power distance among their members, are more individualistic societies, have lower levels of uncertainty avoidance and higher old-age dependency ratio compared to those without delirium guidelines. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: The development and implementation of delirium guidelines vary across countries. Specific combinations of cultural dimensions influence the production of delirium guidelines. Understanding these important cultural differences can facilitate more widespread acceptance and implementation of guidelines.

A hallmark of severe COVID-19 disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 is the low presence of IFN proteins in patient serum despite elevated levels of IFN-encoding mRNAs, indicative of post-transcriptional inhibition of IFN protein production. Here, we performed single-molecule RNA visualization to examine the expression and localization of host mRNAs during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our data show that the biogenesis of type I and type III IFN mRNAs is inhibited at multiple steps during SARS-CoV-2 infection. First, translocation of the interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) transcription factor to the nucleus is limited in response to SARS-CoV-2, indicating that SARS-CoV-2 inhibits RLR-MAVS signaling and thus weakens transcriptional induction of IFN genes. Second, we observed that IFN mRNAs primarily localize to the site of transcription in most SARS-CoV-2 infected cells, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 either inhibits the release of IFN mRNAs from their sites of transcription and/or triggers decay of IFN mRNAs in the nucleus upon exiting the site of transcription. Lastly, nuclear-cytoplasmic transport of IFN mRNAs is inhibited during SARS-CoV-2 infection, which we propose is a consequence of widespread degradation of host cytoplasmic basal mRNAs in the early stages of SARS-CoV-2 replication by the SARS-CoV-2 Nsp1 protein, as wells as the host antiviral endoribonuclease, RNase L. Importantly, IFN mRNAs can escape SARS-CoV-2-mediated degradation if they reach the cytoplasm, making rescue of mRNA export a viable means for promoting the immune response to SARS-CoV-2.","Burke, James M; St Clair, Laura A; Perera, Rushika; Parker, Roy",RNA,293,3

This review considers recent summaries of complications and looks toward strategies to improve practice using a coordinated approach. RECENT FINDINGS: A safety gap can exist between national recommendations and local practice. A lack of attention to end tidal carbon dioxide has repeatedly contributed to airway mismanagement. Clinicians must be trained in newer airway devices (videolaryngoscopes or supraglottic airways) to use them effectively. Time must be found to teach rarely performed skills (e.g., front-of-neck access). Both larger and smaller hospitals have benefitted from an airway lead or response team, coordinating education programs, ensuring the adoption of guidelines, standardizing equipment, and recognizing the role of human factors and ergonomics.

Immunological mechanisms in the eye must be tightly regulated to ensure externally mediated injury and infection or internally mediated autoimmunity do not exceed self-defence tolerance. Vasoactive neuropeptides (VNs) including vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and pituitary adenylate cyclase polypeptide (PACAP) and their receptors exist in the mammalian eye including the sclera, cornea, iris, ciliary body, ciliary process and the retina and may have a role in protecting these normally immune privileged sites. VN receptors are class II G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) which couple primarily to the adenylate cyclase (AC)-cyclic AMP pathway. A sound blood supply is essential for retinal survival hence vascular compromise will have serious consequences. Retinal vasculitis is a potentially blinding condition with a strong association with systemic inflammatory diseases. Compromise of the endothelial barriers and the blood retina barrier (BRB) may instigate inflammatory responses setting up a chain of events involving VNs in a manner which provokes autoimmunity to them. Protection from BRB breakdown may be linked to nitric oxide (NO) effects and actions of phosphodiesterase inhibitors and cAMP production. Induced NO expressed under influences of inflammatory mediators evokes neurodegeneration and cell apoptosis and may lead to serious ocular disease including retinal injury. Other inflammatory mediators also play a role in retinal pathology. PACAP and glutamate are co-stored in the retinohypothalamic tract and PACAP attenuates glutamate induced neurotoxicity in cultured retinal neurons suggesting that compromise of this VN would have significant detrimental impact on retinal viability though glutamate toxicity. Additional effects of VN compromise would possibly occur through unopposed vasoconstriction and inflammation. Proof of this hypothesis has important implications for treatment and prevention of autoimmune retinopathy and blindness as a number of therapeutic pathways may be opened. Importantly for therapeutic contexts cAMP effects are maintained by phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitors which could be used in VN autoimmune disorders. A compelling case may exist to undertake a therapeutic trial of VN replacement, PDE inhibitors and other agents in autoimmune retinopathies resulting from possible VN autoimmunity.","Staines, Donald R.",Med Hypotheses,293,1

Moreover, the study also presents an overview of several mechanisms of action by which pollutants could cause adipose tissue dysfunction. Indeed, a better understanding of the mechanism by which environmental chemicals target adipose tissue and cause metabolic disturbances, and how these mechanisms interact and sex specificities are essential for developing mitigating and sex-specific strategies against metabolic diseases of chemical origin. In particular, considering that a scenario without pollutant exposure is not a realistic option in our current societies, attenuating the deleterious effects of exposure to pollutants by acting on the gut-adipose tissue axis may constitute a new direction of research.","Le Magueresse-Battistoni, Brigitte",Int J Environ Res Public Health,293,29

In the absence of effective antiviral therapies, other host immunomodulatory therapies such as targeting inflammatory response are currently being used without clear evidence of their effectiveness. As inflammation is an essential component of host antiviral mechanisms, therapies targeting inflammation may adversely affect viral clearance and disease outcome. Objective To understand whether the persistent presence of the virus is a key determinant in the disease severity during COVID-19 and to determine if the viral reactivation in some patients is associated with infectious viral particles. Methods The data for patients were available including the onset of the disease, duration of viral persistence, measurements of inflammatory markers such as IL-6 and CRP, chest imaging, disease symptoms, and their durations among others. Follow up tests were performed to determine if the viral negative status persists after their recovery. Results Our data show that patients with persistent viral presence (>16 days) have more severe disease outcomes including extensive lung involvement and requirement of respiratory support. Two patients who died of COVID-19 were virus-positive at the time of their death. Four patients demonstrated virus-positive status on the follow-up tests and these patient samples were sent to viral culture facility where virus culture could not be established. Conclusion These data suggest that viral persistence is the key determining factor of the disease severity.

Here, to track the spread of SARS-CoV-2 lineages in Bangladesh at the national level, we analysed outbreak trajectory and variant emergence using genomics, Facebook ‘Data for Good’ and data from three mobile phone operators. We sequenced the complete genomes of 67 SARS-CoV-2 samples (collected by the IEDCR in Bangladesh between March and July 2020) and combined these data with 324 publicly available Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) SARS-CoV-2 genomes from Bangladesh at that time. We found that most (85%) of the sequenced isolates were Pango lineage B.1.1.25 (58%), B.1.1 (19%) or B.1.36 (8%) in early-mid 2020. Bayesian time-scaled phylogenetic analysis predicted that SARS-CoV-2 first emerged during mid-February in Bangladesh, from abroad, with the first case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) reported on 8 March 2020. At the end of March 2020, three discrete lineages expanded and spread clonally across Bangladesh. The shifting pattern of viral diversity in Bangladesh, combined with the mobility data, revealed that the mass migration of people from cities to rural areas at the end of March, followed by frequent travel between Dhaka (the capital of Bangladesh) and the rest of the country, disseminated three dominant viral lineages. Further analysis of an additional 85 genomes (November 2020 to April 2021) found that importation of variant of concern Beta (B.1.351) had occurred and that Beta had become dominant in Dhaka. Our interpretation that population mobility out of Dhaka, and travel from urban hotspots to rural areas, disseminated lineages in Bangladesh in the first wave continues to inform government policies to control national case numbers by limiting within-country travel.","Cowley, Lauren A.; Afrad, Mokibul Hassan; Rahman, Sadia Isfat Ara; Mamun, Md Mahfuz Al; Chin, Taylor; Mahmud, Ayesha; Rahman, Mohammed Ziaur; Billah, Mallick Masum; Khan, Manjur Hossain; Sultana, Sharmin; Khondaker, Tilovatul; Baker, Stephen; Banik, Nandita; Alam, Ahmed Nawsher; Mannoor, Kaiissar; Banu, Sayera; Chowdhury, Anir; Flora, Meerjady Sabrina; Thomson, Nicholas R.; Buckee, Caroline O.; Qadri, Firdausi; Shirin, Tahmina",Nat Microbiol,293,1

After laryngectomy, the patient's vocal function can be restored in several ways, including the insertion of a tracheoesophageal (TE) shunt. A TE shunt is considered an effective means of restoring speech due to its high efficacy, low requirement for training, and no need for any equipment while speaking. However, complications such as saliva inflow into the trachea, caused by the widening of the shunt opening, have also been reported. Moreover, the optimal treatment for an enlarged fistula has not yet been established. A fistula may also form at sites of hypopharyngeal reconstruction with free jejunal transplantation. Following its formation, the influx of saliva, infections, and pressure exerted by the act of swallowing make a fistula resistant to closure, and most patients require closure surgery using myocutaneous flaps. We encountered a case where an intractable TE fistula formed due to a TE shunt after the patient underwent total pharyngolaryngeal resection for hypopharyngeal cancer and hypopharyngeal reconstruction with a free jejunum flap. Since the optimal method for the TE fistula closure remains uncertain, we attempted to close the fistula according to the fistula closure of the free jejunal transplantation. Failure to close a TE fistula using a myocutaneous flap necessitates a re-closure procedure. However, because the surgical field around the trachea can be limited in such patients, creating an additional myocutaneous flap may not be feasible. In addition to the myocutaneous flap, ventilation control using a conventional intubation tube may further narrow the surgical field during the re-closure surgery. Based on our experience and existing literature, in this article, we summarize several ways of managing TE fistula when the surgical field around the trachea is limited.","Morimatsu, Yasuyuki; Yonezawa, Koichiro; Matsui, Hidetoshi; Iwae, Shigemichi; Sakakibara, Shunsuke",Cureus,293,1

Ensuring an adequate ventilation rate is essential to reduce the risk of infection in confined spaces. In this study, we estimated the association between the infection probability and ventilation rates with the Wells-Riley equation, where the quantum generation rate (q) by a COVID-19 infector was obtained using a reproductive number-based fitting approach. The estimated q value of COVID-19 is 14–48 h(−1). To ensure an infection probability of less than 1%, a ventilation rate larger than common values (100–350 m(3)/h per infector and 1200–4000 m(3)/h per infector for 0.25 h and 3 h of exposure, respectively) is required. If the infector and susceptible person wear masks, then the ventilation rate ensuring a less than 1% infection probability can be reduced to a quarter respectively, which is easier to achieve by the normal ventilation mode applied in typical scenarios, including offices, classrooms, buses, and aircraft cabins. Strict preventive measures (e.g., wearing masks and preventing asymptomatic infectors from entering public spaces using tests) that have been widely adopted should be effective in reducing the risk of infection in confined spaces.","Dai, Hui; Zhao, Bin",Build Simul,293,10

This decline in hours is heavily concentrated in recessions: hours and earnings at the bottom fall sharply in recessions and do not fully recover in subsequent expansions. Motivated by this evidence, we build a structural model to explore the possibility that recessions cause persistent increases in inequality; that is, that the cycle drives the trend. The model features skill-biased technical change, which implies a trend decline in low-skill wages relative to the value of non-market activities. With this adverse trend in the background, recessions imply a potential double-whammy for low skilled men. This group is disproportionately likely to experience unemployment, which further reduces skills and potential earnings via a scarring effect. As unemployed low skilled men give up job search, recessions generate surges in non-participation. Because non-participation is highly persistent, earnings inequality remains elevated long after the recession ends.","Heathcote, Jonathan; Perri, Fabrizio; Violante, Giovanni L.",Rev Econ Dyn,293,1

A set of recommendations have been prepared based on National and International published scientific literature and recent updates on COVID 19. These has been implemented in our tertiary care centre. Due to the evolving nature of COVID 19 and existing knowledge gaps, these recommendations may have to be revised periodically. The incidence of COVID 19 is very low (1–5%) in the pediatric age group with relatively good prognosis. Pediatric airway surgeries should be restricted to emergency cases only. The decision of postponement of the surgical cases should be taken by the team of senior pediatric airway surgeons. Flexible laryngoscopy should be avoided. Foreign body cases should undergo a computed tomography scan to avoid diagnostic bronchoscopies. All the measures should be taken to prevent direct contact of aerosol so powered instruments should not be used unless mandatory. Protective draping method should be adopted to prevent aerosol exposure. As paediatric airway surgeries are aerosol generating procedure where the risk of contracting COVID 19 by the surgeons and support staff is very high, we suggest recommendations to prevent the contact with infected aerosol. We assure these recommendations are easy to follow and can impact good quality outcome during this pandemic crisis.","Raman, Eshwara V.; Shivnani, Deepa",Indian J Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,293,20

Objective: Based on death notification data from Antananarivo, the capital city of Madagascar, this study assesses seasonal patterns of all-cause and cause-specific mortality by age groups and evaluates how these patterns changed over the period 1976–2015. Methods: Monthly numbers of deaths by cause were obtained from death registers maintained by the Municipal Hygiene Office in charge of verifying deaths before the issuance of burial permits. Generalized Additive Mixed regression models (GAMM) were used to test for seasonality in mortality and its changes over the last four decades, controlling for long-term trends in mortality. Results: Among children, risks of dying were the highest during the hot and rainy season, but seasonality in child mortality has significantly declined since the mid-1970s, as a result of declines in the burden of infectious diseases and nutritional deficiencies. In adults aged 60 and above, all-cause mortality rates are the highest in the dry and cold season, due to peaks in cardiovascular diseases, with little change over time. Overall, changes in the seasonality of all-cause mortality have been driven by shifts in the hierarchy of causes of death, while changes in the seasonality within broad categories of causes of death have been modest. Conclusion: Shifts in disease patterns brought about by the epidemiological transition, rather than changes in seasonal variation in cause-specific mortality, are the main drivers of trends in the seasonality of all-cause mortality.","Schlüter, Benjamin-Samuel; Masquelier, Bruno; Metcalf, C.

However, the question to whether continue or withdraw metformin therapy in COVID-19 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus remains contentious. This study aims to investigate the association between metformin and poor COVID-19 outcomes. METHODS: Eligible studies published up to 21 October 2020 were included and appraised for validity, importance, and applicability. The included studies were further ranked according to the level of evidence (LOE). RESULTS: Nine studies were included for further assessments, of which seven studies stated that metformin was not associated with poor COVID-19 outcomes (LOE II-V), while the other two with poorer designs stated otherwise (LOE V). Although metformin may increase the risk of developing acidosis and lactic acidosis (LOE IV), the observed risks were more accentuated in patients with severe COVID-19 disease or kidney impairment and in patients with > 2 daily metformin doses. Interestingly, one study revealed that metformin may even yield therapeutic role in reducing the risk of COVID-19 mortality (LOE II), although further studies are required to confirm these findings. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicated that metformin may be safely continued in COVID-19 patients. The benefit of metformin therapy with simultaneous continuous monitoring of COVID-19 severity and kidney function may outweigh the risks of lactic acidosis, of which incidence is relatively rare.

However, the effect of diosmetin on atopic dermatitis (AD) development has not been reported. This study thus aims to investigate whether diosmetin possesses inhibitory effects on AD development. A dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB)-induced AD mouse model was used to evaluate the effects of diosmetin on AD development. Treatment with diosmetin significantly reduced the dermatitis score, thickness of epidermis and dermis and number of mast cells in comparison with the untreated group. Furthermore, immunohistochemical analysis using an anti-F4/80 antibody demonstrated that diosmetin significantly suppressed macrophage infiltration into the AD lesion. It was observed that the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-4 and IL-1β) in skin lesion decreased in response to treatment with diosmetin. In addition, the anti-inflammatory effect of diosmetin was evaluated in LPS- or IL-4-induced a mouse macrophage cell line (raw 264.7). Diosmetin inhibited the production of nitric oxide and decreased the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). Diosmetin not only suppressed the phosphorylation of MAP kinase (ERK 1/2, p38 and JNK) but the activation of JAK/STAT signaling. The mRNA analysis demonstrated that diosmetin also reduced the level of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β and IL-6. Collectively, these results demonstrate that diosmetin exhibits the inhibitory effect on AD, suggesting that diosmetin may be a potential therapeutic agent for this atopic disorder.","Lee, Dae-hyo; Park, Jeong-ki; Choi, Jawun; Jang, Hyuk; Seol, Jae-won",Int Immunopharmacol,293,1

The practice of preventive measures was relatively lower for avoiding social gatherings and disinfecting contaminated surfaces. Better education, urban residence, and believing the pandemic is real were factors associated with good knowledge on COVID-19 symptoms, transmission methods, and preventive actions. Additionally, being male was associated with good knowledge on symptoms and transmission methods, whereas being in an older age group was associated with knowledge of transmission methods.

It started in Wuhan in China in December 2019 spreading rapidly worldwide. CASE SUMMARY: Three patients aged 51–84 developed a pericarditis related to COVID-19, associated for two of them with a myocarditis. Case 1 was a COVID-19 cardiac tamponade without myocarditis, confirmed by a positive chest computed tomography (CT) scan. Case 2 showed a COVID-19 myopericarditis, confirmed by a positive chest CT scan and a SARS-coronavirus-2 positive swab. Case 3 was a cardiac tamponade due to COVID-19 pericarditis, with a positive polymerase chain reaction on pericardial fluid. They were all treated by colchicine and their condition improved rapidly. DISCUSSION: Presumably rare, we reported three cases of pericardial effusions (PEs) occurring in a single cardiology centre. There is a higher incidence of COVID-19-related cardiac diseases such as pericarditis that can manifest as a minimal PE to a cardiac tamponade, which should result in a higher awareness of cardiologists. A systematic measure of the high-sensitivity troponin kinetic in patients affected by COVID-19 could be interesting in order to screen for potential myocarditis. Any unexplained haemodynamic failure or increased cardiac biomarkers should make the medical team search for myopericarditis by a transthoracic echocardiography.","Sauer, François; Dagrenat, Charlotte; Couppie, Philippe; Jochum, Gaelle; Leddet, Pierre",Eur Heart J Case Rep,293,9

To develop specific anti-coronavirus therapeutics and prophylactics, the molecular mechanism that underlies viral infection must first be defined. Therefore, we herein established a SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein-mediated cell–cell fusion assay and found that SARS-CoV-2 showed a superior plasma membrane fusion capacity compared to that of SARS-CoV. We solved the X-ray crystal structure of six-helical bundle (6-HB) core of the HR1 and HR2 domains in the SARS-CoV-2 S protein S2 subunit, revealing that several mutated amino acid residues in the HR1 domain may be associated with enhanced interactions with the HR2 domain. We previously developed a pan-coronavirus fusion inhibitor, EK1, which targeted the HR1 domain and could inhibit infection by divergent human coronaviruses tested, including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Here we generated a series of lipopeptides derived from EK1 and found that EK1C4 was the most potent fusion inhibitor against SARS-CoV-2 S protein-mediated membrane fusion and pseudovirus infection with IC50s of 1.3 and 15.8 nM, about 241- and 149-fold more potent than the original EK1 peptide, respectively. EK1C4 was also highly effective against membrane fusion and infection of other human coronavirus pseudoviruses tested, including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, as well as SARSr-CoVs, and potently inhibited the replication of 5 live human coronaviruses examined, including SARS-CoV-2. Intranasal application of EK1C4 before or after challenge with HCoV-OC43 protected mice from infection, suggesting that EK1C4 could be used for prevention and treatment of infection by the currently circulating SARS-CoV-2 and other emerging SARSr-CoVs.","Xia, Shuai; Liu, Meiqin; Wang, Chao; Xu, Wei; Lan, Qiaoshuai; Feng, Siliang; Qi, Feifei; Bao, Linlin; Du, Lanying; Liu, Shuwen; Qin, Chuan; Sun, Fei; Shi, Zhengli; Zhu, Yun; Jiang, Shibo; Lu, Lu",Cell Res,293,16

In addition, autophagy can also play important roles during human diseases, such as cancer, neurodegenerative and autoimmune disorders. Furthermore, novel findings suggest that autophagy contributes to the host defense against microbial infections. In this article, we review the role of macroautophagy in antiviral immune responses and discuss molecular mechanisms evolved by viral pathogens to evade this process.

While highly effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are being applied on a large-scale, whether and to what extent the strength of the vaccine-induced immune response could be further potentiated is still an object of debate. Several reports studied the effect of different vaccines on the susceptibility and mortality of COVID-19, with conflicting results. We aimed to evaluate whether previous influenza and/or pneumococcal vaccination had an impact on the specific immune response to the SARS-CoV-2 BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine. The study population consists of 710 workers from our Institute who completed the BNT162b2 schedule and have been tested at least once after the second dose, from 27 December 2020 up to 15 April 2021. Of these, 152 (21.4%) had received an influenza and 215 (30.3%) a concomitant influenza and pneumococcal vaccination, a median of 102 days before the second dose of BNT162b2. Overall, 100% of workers were tested for anti-Spike receptor-binding domain (anti-S/RBD) antibodies, 224 workers for neutralization titer (Micro-neutralization assay, MNA), and 155 workers for a spike-specific T cell interferon-γ response (IFN-γ). The levels of anti-S/RBD, MNA and IFN-γ were evaluated and compared according to sex, age, involvement in direct care of COVID-19 patients, and previous influenza/pneumococcal vaccination. At the univariate analysis, no statistically significant association was observed with regard to a previous influenza and pneumococcal vaccination. A significant lower anti-S/RBD response was observed according to an older age and male sex, while MNA titers were significantly associated to sex but not to age. At the multivariable analysis, workers receiving a concomitant influenza and pneumococcal vaccination or only influenza showed a 58% (p 0.01) and 42% (p 0.07) increase in MNA titers, respectively, compared to those who did not receive an influenza/pneumococcal vaccination. Female workers showed an 81% MNA and a 44% anti-S/RBD increase compared to male workers (p < 0.001). Compared to workers aged 21 to 49 years, those aged 50 or older were associated with a reduction in the anti-S/RBD (16%; p 0.005), MNA (31%; p 0.019), and IFN.g (32%) immune response. Maintaining the influenza and pneumococcal immunization program for the coming season, in which COVID-19 could still be spreading, remains strongly recommended to protect those who are more vulnerable and to limit the potential burden of these infections on the healthcare system.","Puro, Vincenzo; Castilletti, Concetta; Agrati, Chiara; Goletti, Delia; Leone, Sara; Agresta, Alessandro; Cimini, Eleonora; Tartaglia, Eleonora; Casetti, Rita; Colavita, Francesca; Meschi, Silvia; Matusali, Giulia; Lapa, Daniele; Najafi Fard, Saeid; Aiello, Alessandra; Farrone, Chiara; Gallì, Paola; Capobianchi, Maria Rosaria; Ippolito, Giuseppe",Vaccines (Basel),293,20

OBJECTIVE: This study assesses the source(s) of COVID-19 information among people in Nigeria, as well as the predictors and the perceived accuracy of information from these sources. METHODS: We conducted an online survey of consenting adults residing in Nigeria between April and May 2020 during the lockdown and first wave of COVID-19. The major sources of information about COVID-19 were distilled from 7 potential sources (family and friends, places of worship, health care providers, internet, workplace, traditional media, and public posters/banners). An open-ended question was asked to explore how respondents determined accuracy of information. Statistical analysis was conducted using STATA 15.0 software (StataCorp Texas) with significance placed at P<.05. Approval to conduct this study was obtained from the Lagos State University Teaching Hospital Health Research Ethics Committee. RESULTS: A total of 719 respondents completed the survey. Most respondents (n=642, 89.3%) obtained COVID-19–related information from the internet. The majority (n=617, 85.8%) considered their source(s) of information to be accurate, and 32.6% (n=234) depended on only 1 out of the 7 potential sources of COVID-19 information.

The risk of allergic reaction to the newly licensed vector vaccines (AstraZeneca®, Johnson&Johnson®) cannot be conclusively assessed yet, but also appears to be low. There is currently no evidence that patients with allergic diseases (atopic patients) react more frequently or more severely to these vaccines. It is currently assumed that intolerance reactions of the immediate-type are either type I allergic (IgE-mediated) reactions or occur via complement activation (CARPA, “complement activation-related pseudoallergy”). Polyethylene glycol (PEG) or polysorbate, which are present as stabilizers in the vaccines, are suspected as triggers for this. CONCLUSION: The data available so far do not show a significantly increased risk of immediate-type allergic reactions in atopic persons. In almost all cases, atopic patients can be vaccinated without problems. Standardized follow-up tests after suspected allergic reactions or CARPA-mediated reactions are currently limited.","Altrichter, Sabine; Wöhrl, Stefan; Horak, Fritz; Idzko, Marco; Jordakieva, Galateja; Untersmayr, Eva; Szepfalusi, Zsolt; Zieglmayer, Petra; Jensen-Jarolim, Erika; Wiedermann, Ursula; Rosenkranz, Alexander; Hötzenecker, Wolfram",Allergo J Int,293,2

The seemingly unstoppable viruses have kept records high to threaten human health and well-being. The diversity and complexity of natural products (NPs) offer remarkable efficacy and specificity to target viral infection steps and serve as excellent source for antiviral agents. The discovery and production of antiviral NPs remain challenging due to low abundance in their native hosts. Reconstruction of NP biosynthetic pathways in microbes is a promising solution to overcome this limitation. In this review, we surveyed 23 most prominent NPs (from more than 200 antiviral NP candidates) with distinct antiviral mode of actions and summarized the recent metabolic engineering effort to produce these compounds in various microbial hosts. We envision that the scalable and low-cost production of novel antiviral NPs, enabled by metabolic engineering, may light the hope to control and eradicate the deadliest viruses that plague our society and humanity.","Ma, Jingbo; Gu, Yang; Xu, Peng",Curr Opin Biotechnol,293,1

Obesity is a risk factor for severe disease, and the practice of endoscopy poses special challenges and risks of SARS-CoV-2 transmission to patients and providers given the evolving role of the gastrointestinal tract in viral transmission and aerosol generation during endoscopic procedures. It is therefore necessary to distinguish between urgent interventions that cannot be postponed despite the risks during the pandemic and, in contrast, purely elective interventions that could be deferred in order to minimize transmission risks during a time of infection surge and limited access. Semi-urgent bariatric procedures have an intermediate position. Since the chronological course of the pandemic is still unpredictable, these interventions were defined according to whether or not they should be performed within a nominal 8-week period. In this position statement, the IFSO Endoscopy Committee offers guidance on navigating bariatric endoscopic procedures in patients with obesity during the COVID-19 pandemic, in the hope of mitigating the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission to vulnerable patients and healthcare workers.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed retrospectively the files of patients over 85 years old and older who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of our training and research hospital between January 2017 and December 2018. Demographic and clinical findings, treatment modalities, and outcomes were recorded. The patients who died during the ICU stay were compared to the survivors, and factors associated with mortality and LOS in the intensive care were evaluated. RESULTS: We reviewed 2350 files, and 218 patients (58.3% females) were included. The rate of mortality was 81.7%. The factors independently associated with a higher rate of mortality were the acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (APACHE) II score; the need for mechanical ventilation (MV), or inotropic support; and the presence of coronary artery disease (CAD) or chronic kidney disease (CKD). A tracheostomy and a blood transfusion were inversely associated with mortality. We found an association between LOS and comorbidities (renal replacement, percutaneous gastrostomy, blood transfusion, and a tracheostomy). CONCLUSION: The rate of survival in the intensive care was low among these very elderly intensive care patients. A higher APACHE II score; application of MV or inotropic support; and the presence of CAD or CKD were associated with a higher mortality rate. HOW TO CITE THIS ARTICLE: Miniksar OH, Özdemir M.

Expression of ICAM-1 on vascular endothelium recruits leukocytes which initiates inflammation. IL-6 induces ICAM-1. Both ICAM-1 and IL-6 can be enhanced in influenza virus infection and COVID-19 patients. Besides initiation of virus entry host cells, whether HA alone, instead of whole virus, of influenza has the effects on expression of ICAM-1 and IL-6 in vascular endothelium with injury in the lungs, remains to be demonstrated. METHODS: RT-qPCR and Western blot as well as histopathologic examination were used to examine mRNA and protein of ICAM-1 and IL-6 as well as pathological injury in the lung tissues, respectively. RESULTS: After incubation of the Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells (HUVECs) with HA of H1N1 for 24 h, the mRNA and protein of ICAM-1 and IL-6 in HUVECs were increased in group of 5 μg/ml concentration with statistical significance (p < 0.05). Pathological injury in lung tissues of the mice was shown 12 h after tail intravenous injection with 100 μl of HA (50 μg/ml and 100 μg/ml in normal saline), including widened alveolar spaces with angiotelectasis in alveolar wall, alveolar luminal and interstitial inflammatory infiltrates, alveolar luminal erythrocyte effusion. CONCLUSIONS: HA alone, instead of whole H1N1 virus, induced more expression of ICAM-1 and IL-6, two molecules involving in pathological and inflammatory responses, in HUVECs and pathological injury in lung tissues of the mice. This knowledge provides a new HA-targeted potential direction for prevention and treatment of disease related to H1N1 infection.","Zhao, Ming-Zhen; Guo, Xiang; Sun, Bo; Sun, Xiao-Fang; Pang, Gui-Fen; Yang, Lin-Ying; Zhao, Xing; Sun, Li-Xin; Zhang, Qing",Gene,293,23

Although clinical reports indicate that ORF8 variant strains (Δ382 and L84S variants) are less likely to cause severe illness, functional differences between wild-type and variant ORF8 are unknown. Furthermore, the physicochemical properties of the ORF8 protein have not been analyzed. In this study, the physicochemical properties of the wild-type ORF8 and its L84S variant were analyzed and compared. Using the tobacco BY-2 cell production system, which has been successfully used to produce the wild-type ORF8 protein with a single conformation, was used to successfully produce the ORF8 L84S variant protein at the same level as wild-type ORF8. The produced proteins were purified, and their temperature and pH dependencies were examined using nuclear magnetic resonance spectra. Our data suggested that the wild-type and L84S variant ORF8 structures are highly stable over a wide temperature range. Both proteins displayed an aggregated conformation at higher temperature that reverted when the temperature was decreased to room temperature. Moreover, ORF8 precipitated at acidic pH and this precipitation was reversed when the solution pH was shifted to neutral. Interestingly, the L84S variant exhibited greater solubility than wild-type ORF8 under acidic conditions. Thus, the finding indicated that conformational stability and reversibility of ORF8 are key properties related to function in oppressive environments.","Ohki, Shinya; Imamura, Tomohiro; Higashimura, Yasuki; Matsumoto, Kenji; Mori, Masashi",Biochem Biophys Res Commun,293,20

Rapid access to bundles (clusters) of related elements of knowledge gathered from diverse sources on the Internet and from growing knowledge repositories seem particularly helpful when exploring less obvious therapeutic targets in viruses (for which knowledge new to the researcher is important), and when using the following concept. Subsequences of amino acid residue sequences of proteins that are conserved across strains and species are (a) more likely to be important targets and (b) less likely to exhibit escape mutations that would make them resistant to vaccines and therapeutic agents. However, the terms “conserved” and even “highly conserved” used by authors are matters of degree, depending on how distant from SARS-CoV-2 they wished to go in comparing other sequences. The binding site to the human ACE2 protein as virus receptor and human antibody CR3022 binding site on the spike glycoprotein are rather variable by the criteria used in the present and preceding studies. To look for more strongly conserved targets, open reading Frames of SARS-CoV-2 were examined for extremely highly conserved regions, meaning recognizable across many viruses and organisms. Most prominent is a motif found in SARS-CoV-2 non-structural protein 3 (Nsp3). It relates to a fold called type called the macro domain and has remarkably wide distribution across organisms including humans with significant homologies involving three especially conserved subsequences (a) VVVNAANVYLKHGGGVAGALNK, (b) LHVVGPNVNKG, and (c) PLLSAGIFG. Careful study of the variations of these and of the more variable sequences between and around them might provide a finer “scalpel” to ensure inhibition of a vital function of the virus without impairing the functions of related host macro domains.","Robson, B.",Comput Biol Med,293,16

However, these local learned descriptors suffer from the inconsistency problem without considering the relationship between two descriptors in a patch. Consequently, the problem causes the irregular spatial distribution of local learned descriptors. In this paper, we propose a neat method to overcome the above inconsistency problem. The core idea is to design a triplet loss function of vertex-edge constraint (VEC), which takes the correlation between two descriptors of a patch into account. Furthermore, to minimize the non-matching descriptors’ influence, we propose an exponential algorithm to reduce the difference between the long and short sides. The competitive performance against state-of-the-art methods on various datasets demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method.","Yin, Jianhua; Zhu, Longzhen; Bai, Yang; He, Zhenyu",Signal Image Video Process,293,26

METHODS: We systematically searched the PubMed and Google Scholar databases until June 1st, 2020 and accessed the full text on COVID-19 and MS to prepare a narrative review on this topic. RESULTS: Patients with metabolic disorders like obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular and liver disease may face a higher risk of infection of COVID-19, greatly affecting the development and prognosis of the disease, being associated with significantly worse outcome in these patients. The proposed drugs that are in clinical trial for COVID-19 treatment must be carefully considered for clinical use, especially in patients with MS. CONCLUSION: MS is a risk factor influencing the progression and prognosis of COVID-2019. The drugs currently evaluated for the infection treatment are promising but need further studies to prove their efficacy and safety, due to the adverse effects may be exacerbated by combination therapy or due to viral infection.

SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Elective surgical practices have been profoundly impacted by the global COVID-19 pandemic, leading to a rapid increase in the utilization of telemedicine. The abrupt initiation of audio-video telehealth visits for all providers of a multidisciplinary clinic on March 19(th) 2020 provided unique circumstances to assess the impact of telemedicine. METHODS: Data from the clinical booking system (new patient and follow-up visits) for all clinical provider types of the multidisciplinary metabolic center from the pre-telehealth, post-telehealth, and a 2019 comparative period were retrospectively reviewed and compared. The primary outcome is the change in patient visit volume for all clinical providers from before to after the initiation of telemedicine for both new patient, and follow-up visits. RESULTS: There were a total of 506 visits (162 new patient visits, and 344 follow-ups) in the pre-telehealth period, versus 413 visits (77 new patient visits, and 336 follow-ups) during the post-telehealth period. After telehealth implementation, new visits for surgeons decreased by 75%. Although follow-up visits decreased by 55.06% for surgeons, there was an increase by 27.36% for advanced practitioners. When surgeons were separated from other practitioners, their follow-up visit rate decrease by 55.06%, compared to a 16.08% increase for the group of all other practitioners (P < 0.0001). Dietitians experienced higher rates of absenteeism with new patient visits (10.00% vs 31.42%, P = 0.0128), whereas bariatricians experienced a decrease in follow-up visit absenteeism (33.33% vs 0%, P = 0.0093). CONCLUSIONS: Although new patient visit volume fell across the board, follow-up visits increased for certain nonsurgical providers. This provides a template for adoption of a multidisciplinary telehealth clinic in a post-pandemic world.","Brown, Andrew M.; Ardila-Gatas, Jessica; Yuan, Victoria; Devas, Nina; Docimo, Salvatore; Spaniolas, Konstaninos; Pryor, Aurora D.",Ann Surg,293,1

Extensive efforts and progress have been made to develop effective and safe vaccines against COVID-19. A primary target of these vaccines is the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein, and many studies utilized structural vaccinology techniques to either stabilize the protein or fix the receptor-binding domain at certain states. In this study, we extended an evolutionary protein design algorithm, EvoDesign, to create thousands of stable S protein variants without perturbing the surface conformation and B cell epitopes of the S protein. We then evaluated the mutated S protein candidates based on predicted MHC-II T cell promiscuous epitopes as well as the epitopes’ similarity to human peptides. The presented strategy aims to improve the S protein’s immunogenicity and antigenicity by inducing stronger CD4 T cell response while maintaining the protein’s native structure and function. The top EvoDesign S protein candidate (Design-10705) recovered 31 out of 32 MHC-II T cell promiscuous epitopes in the native S protein, in which two epitopes were present in all seven human coronaviruses. This newly designed S protein also introduced nine new MHC-II T cell promiscuous epitopes and showed high structural similarity to its native conformation. The proposed structural vaccinology method provides an avenue to rationally design the antigen’s structure with increased immunogenicity, which could be applied to the rational design of new COVID-19 vaccine candidates.","Ong, Edison; Huang, Xiaoqiang; Pearce, Robin; Zhang, Yang; He, Yongqun",bioRxiv,293,1

The aim of this research is to propose a novel inventory pooling model to help determine order sizes and safety inventories in local hospital warehouses. The current study attempts to portray the availability of pharmaceutical items in public hospitals facing COVID-19 challenges. Different from previous studies, this research builds upon the consecrated theory of inventory pooling, extending it to pandemic circumstances where the intractability of kurtosis and skewness in inventory models are critical issues for making sure that medicines have high availability at a low cost. These effects on the total cost of inventory are explored and compared to a supply system with no consolidation. A continuous-review model is assumed with allocation rules for centralization and regular transshipment given different skewness and kurtosis structures for the demand, describing them by the copula method. This method models a multivariate demand considering that the marginal distributions of the demand can be specified by the Generalized Additive Model for Location, Scale and Shape, which offers advantages to model demands considering virtually any marginal statistical distribution. Numerical simulations and an illustrative example show that distributions of demands with more negative skewness and high kurtosis favor to a greater extent obtaining lower total costs with regular supply transshipment systems. Our study points out important considerations for supply chain decision makers when having demands with skewness and kurtosis patterns.","Rojas, Fernando; Wanke, Peter; Bravo, Fernando; Tan, Yong",Comput Ind Eng,293,5

Despite the ban on elective procedures, it is impossible to define the medical urgency of a case solely on whether a case is on an elective surgery schedule. Orthopaedic surgical procedures should consider COVID-19-associated risks and an assimilation of all available disease dependent, disease independent, and logistical information that is tailored to each patient, institution, and region. Using an evidence-based risk stratification of clinical urgency, we provide a framework for prioritization of orthopaedic sport medicine procedures that encompasses such factors.

Some of these variants initially identified in caged were also found in humans. The claim that these variants exhibited lower susceptibility to antibody neutralization led to the slaughter of 17 million minks in Denmark. SARS-CoV-2 prevalence tests led to the discovery of infected farmed minks worldwide. In this study, we revisit the issue of the circulation of SARS-CoV-2 variants in minks as a model of sarbecovirus interspecies evolution by: (1) comparing human and mink angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and neuropilin 1 (NRP-1) receptors; (2) comparing SARS-CoV-2 sequences from humans and minks; (3) analyzing the impact of mutations on the 3D structure of the spike protein; and (4) predicting linear epitope targets for immune response. Mink-selected SARS-CoV-2 variants carrying the Y453F/D614G mutations display an increased affinity for human ACE2 and can escape neutralization by one monoclonal antibody. However, they are unlikely to lose most of the major epitopes predicted to be targets for neutralizing antibodies. We discuss the consequences of these results for the rational use of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.","Devaux, Christian A.; Pinault, Lucile; Delerce, Jérémy; Raoult, Didier; Levasseur, Anthony; Frutos, Roger",Front Microbiol,293,3

Subsequent experimental infection of Jamaican fruit bats (Artibeus jamaicensis) caused a disease similar to that of naturally infected bats. Although substantial attention has focused on bats as reservoir hosts of viruses that cause human disease, little is known about the interactions between bats and their pathogens. We performed a transcriptome-wide study to illuminate the response of Jamaican fruit bats experimentally infected with TCRV. Differential gene expression analysis of multiple tissues revealed global and organ-specific responses associated with innate antiviral responses, including interferon alpha/beta and Toll-like receptor signaling, activation of complement cascades, and cytokine signaling, among others. Genes encoding proteins involved in adaptive immune responses, such as gamma interferon signaling and costimulation of T cells by the CD28 family, were also altered in response to TCRV infection. Immunoglobulin gene expression was also elevated in the spleens of infected bats, including IgG, IgA, and IgE isotypes. These results indicate an active innate and adaptive immune response to TCRV infection occurred but did not prevent fatal disease. This de novo assembly provides a high-throughput data set of the Jamaican fruit bat and its host response to TCRV infection, which remains a valuable tool to understand the molecular signatures involved in antiviral responses in bats. IMPORTANCE As reservoir hosts of viruses associated with human disease, little is known about the interactions between bats and viruses. Using Jamaican fruit bats infected with Tacaribe virus (TCRV) as a model, we characterized the gene expression responses to infection in different tissues and identified pathways involved with the response to infection. This report is the most detailed gene discovery work in the species to date and the first to describe immune gene expression responses in bats during a pathogenic viral infection.","Gerrard, Diana L.; Hawkinson, Ann; Sherman, Tyler; Modahl, Cassandra M.; Hume, Gretchen; Campbell, Corey L.; Schountz, Tony; Frietze, Seth",mSphere,293,1

DESIGN: An observational descriptive study which included hospitalised suspected, or probable cases of hopitalised COVID-19 patients, conducted in Dr. Cipto Mangunkusumo National Hospital, Ciputra Hospital, Mitra Keluarga Depok Hospital and Mitra Keluarga Kelapa Gading Hospital, Indonesia. Epidemiological, clinical, laboratory and radiology data were obtained. Nasopharyngeal and anal swabs specimens were collected for SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection. RESULTS: We analysed 136 subjects as part of this study. The clinical spectrum of COVID-19 manifesation in this study was typical of hospitalised patients, with 25% classified as mild cases, 14.7% in severe condition and 12.5% of subjects classified as having acute respiratory distress syndrome. When compared with nasopharyngeal swab as the standard specimen for reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) detection of SARS-CoV-2 antigen, the sensitivity and specificity of the anal swab was 36.7% and 93.8%, respectively. The positive and negative predictive value were 97.8% and 16.5 %, respectively. The performance of the anal swab remained similar when only the subgroup of patients with gastrointestinal symptoms (n=92, 67.6%) was analysed (sensitivity 40% and specificity 91.7%). Out of all the subjects included in analysis, 67.6% had gastrointestinal symptoms. Similarly, 73.3% of patients in the anal swab-positive group had gastrointestinal symptoms. The two most common gastrointestinal symptoms in the subjects’ population were nausea and anorexia. CONCLUSION: Anal swab specimen has low sensitivity (36.7%) but high specificity (93.8%) for detecting SARS-CoV-2 antigen by RT-PCR. Only one additional positive result was found by anal swab among the nasopharyngeal swab-negative group. Anal swab may not be needed as an additional test at the beginning of a patient’s diagnostic investigation and nasopharyngeal swab RT-PCR remains as the standard diagnostic test for COVID-19.","Abdullah, Murdani; Sudrajat, Dedy Gunawanjati; Muzellina, Virly Nanda; Kurniawan, Juferdy; Rizka, Aulia; Utari, Amanda Pitarini; Pribadi, Rabbinu Rangga; Idrus, Muhammad Firhat; Yusra, Yusra; Meilany, Sofy; Surandy, Andry; Shatri, Hamzah; Rinaldi, Ikhwan; Pitoyo, Ceva Wicaksono; Renaldi, Kaka",BMJ Open Gastroenterol,293,20

METHODS: We used data from 2,337,855 women aged 15–49 years from nationally representative Demographic and Health Survey conducted between 1990 and 2018. Bayesian linear regression analyses were performed. RESULTS: During 1990–2018, the prevalence of underweight decreased in 35 countries and overweight increased in 50 countries. The highest underweight increase was in Morocco (5.5%) and overweight in Nepal (12.4%). In 2030, >20% of women in eight LMICs will be underweight, with Madagascar (36.8%), Senegal (32.2%), and Burundi (29.2%) projected to experience the highest burden of underweight. Whereas >50% of women in 22 LMICs are projected to be overweight, with Egypt (94.7%), Jordan (75.0%), and Pakistan (74.1%) projected to have the highest burden of overweight. 24 LMICs are projected to experience the double burden of malnutrition (both underweight and overweight >20%) in 2030. Noticeable variations in underweight and overweight were observed across wealth, residence, education, and age of women, with a higher rate of overweight in high-income, high-education, and urban women. These inequalities have widened in many countries and are projected to continue. The probability of eradicating overweight and underweight is nearly 0% for all countries by 2030, except Egypt is on track to eradicate underweight. CONCLUSIONS: Although the prevalence of underweight declined, this decline has been superseded by the dramatic increase of overweight. None of the 55 LMICs is likely to eradicate malnutrition in women by 2030.","Hasan, Md.

Masks, depending on type, filter out the majority of viral particles, but not all. We first discuss the near-century-old literature around the viral inoculum and severity of disease (conceptualized as the LD50 or lethal dose of the virus). We include examples of rising rates of asymptomatic infection with population-level masking, including in closed settings (e.g., cruise ships) with and without universal masking. Asymptomatic infections may be harmful for spread but could actually be beneficial if they lead to higher rates of exposure. Exposing society to SARS-CoV-2 without the unacceptable consequences of severe illness with public masking could lead to greater community-level immunity and slower spread as we await a vaccine. This theory of viral inoculum and mild or asymptomatic disease with SARS-CoV-2 in light of population-level masking has received little attention so this is one of the first perspectives to discuss the evidence supporting this theory.","Gandhi, Monica; Beyrer, Chris; Goosby, Eric",J Gen Intern Med,293,26

One such method uses stably expressed reference genes. Since suitable reference genes appear to be unique for each tissue, we have identified an optimal set of the most stably expressed genes in human blood that can be used for normalization. METHODS: Whole-genome Affymetrix Human 2.0 Plus arrays were examined from 526 samples of males and females ages 2 to 78, including control subjects and patients with Tourette syndrome, stroke, migraine, muscular dystrophy, and autism. The top 100 most stably expressed genes with a broad range of expression levels were identified. To validate the best candidate genes, we performed quantitative RT-PCR on a subset of 10 genes (TRAP1, DECR1, FPGS, FARP1, MAPRE2, PEX16, GINS2, CRY2, CSNK1G2 and A4GALT), 4 commonly employed reference genes (GAPDH, ACTB, B2M and HMBS) and PPIB, previously reported to be stably expressed in blood. Expression stability and ranking analysis were performed using GeNorm and NormFinder algorithms. RESULTS: Reference genes were ranked based on their expression stability and the minimum number of genes needed for nomalization as calculated using GeNorm showed that the fewest, most stably expressed genes needed for acurate normalization in RNA expression studies of human whole blood is a combination of TRAP1, FPGS, DECR1 and PPIB. We confirmed the ranking of the best candidate control genes by using an alternative algorithm (NormFinder). CONCLUSION: The reference genes identified in this study are stably expressed in whole blood of humans of both genders with multiple disease conditions and ages 2 to 78. Importantly, they also have different functions within cells and thus should be expressed independently of each other. These genes should be useful as normalization genes for microarray and RT-PCR whole blood studies of human physiology, metabolism and disease.","Stamova, Boryana S; Apperson, Michelle; Walker, Wynn L; Tian, Yingfang; Xu, Huichun; Adamczy, Peter; Zhan, Xinhua; Liu, Da-Zhi; Ander, Bradley P; Liao, Isaac H; Gregg, Jeffrey P; Turner, Renee J; Jickling, Glen; Lit, Lisa; Sharp, Frank R",BMC Med Genomics,293,29

In the United Kingdom (UK), the pandemic significantly disrupted oncology services as resources were reassigned to care for COVID-19 patients. In addition to service disruptions, many women received a UK Government letter advising them to shield for 12-weeks. We aimed to explore the effect of disruption to scheduled oncology services and the UK Government shielding letter on emotional and cognitive vulnerability. A further aim was to investigate the relationship between COVID-19 related emotional vulnerability (COVID-EMV) and anxiety, depression and perceived cognitive function. Women diagnosed with primary breast cancer (N = 234) completed a series of online questionnaires to assess their cognitive and emotional wellbeing as well as their COVID-EMV. Results indicated that disrupted oncology services had a significant impact on COVID-EMV, anxiety and depression, with those experiencing disruptions expressing higher general emotional vulnerability as well as COVID-EMV. Further, the UK Government letter had a significant effect on perceived cognitive function; those who received the letter reported poorer cognitive function. Regression analyses revealed that after allowing for the effects of sociodemographic and clinical variables, women’s COVID-EMV significantly predicted worse outcomes of anxiety, depression and perceived cognitive function. Our findings indicate that concerns about COVID-19 amongst women affected by breast cancer leads to increased risk of developing affective disorder, such as anxiety and depression symptomatology, among this sample. We advocate the rapid implementation of accessible interventions designed to promote emotional resilience in the breast cancer population.","Swainston, Jessica; Chapman, Bethany; Grunfeld, Elizabeth A.; Derakshan, Nazanin",Front Psychol,293,24

Nicotinic receptors (nAChRs) have been put forward as potential regulators of inflammation and of ACE2 expression. As vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) activates nAChRs, we aimed to investigate whether VNS can be instrumental in affecting intestinal epithelial ACE2 expression. METHODS: By using publicly available datasets we qualified epithelial ACE2 expression in human intestine, and assessed gene co-expression of ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 priming Transmembrane Serine Protease 2 (TMPRSS2) with nAChRs in intestinal epithelial cells. Next, we investigated mouse and human ACE2 expression in intestinal tissues after chronic VNS via implanted devices. RESULTS: We show co-expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 with nAChRs and α7 nAChR in particular in intestinal stem cells, goblet cells, and enterocytes. However, VNS did not affect ACE2 expression in murine or human intestinal tissue, albeit in colitis setting. CONCLUSIONS: ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are specifically expressed in epithelial cells of human intestine, and both are co-expressed with nAChRs. However, no evidence for regulation of ACE2 expression through VNS could be found. Hence, a therapeutic value of VNS with respect to SARS-CoV-2 infection risk through ACE2 receptor modulation in intestinal epithelia could not be established.","ten Hove, Anne S.; Brinkman, David J.; Li Yim, Andrew Y.

Prophylactic mRNA COVID‐19 vaccines commonly utilize nanotechnology to deliver mRNA encoding SARS‐CoV‐2 vaccine antigens, thereby triggering the body's immune response and preventing infections. In this study, a new combinatorial library of symmetric lipid‐like compounds is constructed, and among which a lead compound is selected to prepare lipid‐like nanoassemblies (LLNs) for intracellular delivery of mRNA. After multiround optimization, the mRNA formulated into core–shell‐structured LLNs exhibits more than three orders of magnitude higher resistance to serum than the unprotected mRNA, and leads to sustained and high‐level protein expression in mammalian cells. A single intravenous injection of LLNs into mice achieves over 95% mRNA translation in the spleen, without causing significant hematological and histological changes. Delivery of in‐vitro‐transcribed mRNA that encodes high‐affinity truncated ACE2 variants (tACE2v mRNA) through LLNs induces elevated expression and secretion of tACE2v decoys, which is able to effectively block the binding of the receptor‐binding domain of the SARS‐CoV‐2 to the human ACE2 receptor. The robust neutralization activity in vitro suggests that intracellular delivery of mRNA encoding ACE2 receptor mimics via LLNs may represent a potential intervention strategy for COVID‐19.","Li, Min; Li, Sanpeng; Huang, Yixuan; Chen, Haixia; Zhang, Songya; Zhang, Zhicheng; Wu, Weigang; Zeng, Xiaobin; Zhou, Boping; Li, Bin",Adv Mater,293,29

However, it is still not known whether viruses are responsible for the symptoms observed in sick pilgrims or whether they only colonize sick and asymptomatic pilgrims. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A prospective cohort study was conducted among French Hajj pilgrims in 2016. Medical follow-up and systematic nasal swabbing were performed pre- and post-Hajj. Additional samples were obtained per-Hajj, at symptom onset in ill pilgrims. Viruses were identified using the BioFire FilmArray(®) Respiratory multiplex qualitative PCR panel. RESULTS: 109 pilgrims were included. 83.5% presented respiratory symptoms during Hajj and 39.5% were still symptomatic on return. 5.5% of pre-Hajj, 95.2% of per-Hajj (at symptom onset) and 46.5% of post-Hajj samples tested positive (p < 0.0001). Acquisition rates of rhinovirus/enterovirus, coronavirus 229E and influenza A virus were respectively 38.6%, 19.8% and 2.0%. Although rhinovirus/enterovirus, coronavirus 229E and influenza A clearance were respectively 70.6%, 71.4% and 100% on return, overall virus carriage proportion on return was 75.0% in pilgrims with influenza-like illness and 44.0% in those who have never experienced this symptoms or resolved it (OR = 4.05, 95% CI [1.02–16.02]).

To make a proper distribution schedule, we considered the timing of supply and demand. In the present study, a “sequential time window” is used to describe the time to generate of supply and demand and the time of supply delivery. Then, considering the sequential time window, we proposed two multiobjective scheduling models with the consideration of demand uncertainty; two multiobjective stochastic programming models were also proposed to solve the scheduling models. Moreover, this paper describes a simulation that was performed based on a first-aid medicine distribution problem during a Wenchuan earthquake response. The simulation results show that the methodologies proposed in this paper provide effective schedules for the distribution of first-aid medicine. The developed distribution schedule enables some supplies in the former time windows to be used in latter time windows. This schedule increases the utility of limited stocks and avoids the risk that all the supplies are used in the short-term, leaving no supplies for long-term use.","Fang, Jiaqi; Hou, Hanping; Lu, Changxiang; Pang, Haiyun; Deng, Qingshan; Ye, Yong; Pan, Lingle",PLoS One,293,24

These four have a relationship with the shape of the daily mortality curve once one considers the intervals from infection to death or recovery. Without an understanding of this relationship we cannot say that an earlier lockdown would have saved lives. Using a small stochastic model, the lockdown had to be weakened, in April and May, for simulated deaths to match ongoing actual daily deaths. Google mobility data was found to be consistent with the weakening required in the model with similar changes from baseline in time and magnitude. If in an earlier lockdown, mobility and interactions would have followed a similar course, then with a large epidemic curve an earlier lockdown might be associated with many more deaths than some currently believe. This was confirmed in the stochastic model and in two modified SIR models of epidemics of various sizes. The first SIR model had a fixed period to recovery and the second used random periods, both models had random periods to death. Weakening of the mitigations was required to tune the output in large but not in small epidemics. This gives weight to the epidemic having affected many more individuals than some reports currently suggest. In both one and two-week earlier lockdowns, total deaths were found to depend on the size of the epidemic and to vary from 2,000-49,000 deaths. There was a linear relationship between the peak proportion of the population infected and the reciprocal of the case fatality rate. This work questions the low prevalence of < 0.1%, reported by the Office for National Statistics in May and June 2020, since to accommodate a weakening lockdown, the shape of the daily mortality curve, and an acceptable case fatality rate a much larger epidemic curve is required.","Lander, A.

In a transwell culture system, Rep60 cells were co-cultured with either PBMCs or highly purified γδ T cells stimulated by non-peptidic antigens. Vγ9Vδ2 T cell activation was associated with a dramatic reduction of HCV RNA levels. Neutralizing antibodies targeting IFN-γ revealed a critical role for this cytokine in the inhibition of HCV replication. Interestingly, drugs already in clinical use, such as Phosphostim and Zoledronate, known to activate γδ T cells, were shown to induce the inhibition of HCV replication mediated by Vγ9Vδ2 T cells of HCV patients.

Because of the sudden and rapid rise of B.1.1.7, we investigated the prevalence and growth dynamics of this variant in the United States (U.S.), tracking it back to its early emergence and onward local transmission. We found that the RT-qPCR testing anomaly of S gene target failure (SGTF), first observed in the U.K., was a reliable proxy for B.1.1.7 detection. We sequenced 212 B.1.1.7 SARS-CoV-2 genomes collected from testing facilities in the U.S. from December 2020 to January 2021. We found that while the fraction of B.1.1.7 among SGTF samples varied by state, detection of the variant increased at a logistic rate similar to those observed elsewhere, with a doubling rate of a little over a week and an increased transmission rate of 35-45%. By performing time-aware Bayesian phylodynamic analyses, we revealed several independent introductions of B.1.1.7 into the U.S. as early as late November 2020, with onward community transmission enabling the variant to spread to at least 30 states as of January 2021. Our study shows that the U.S. is on a similar trajectory as other countries where B.1.1.7 rapidly became the dominant SARS-CoV-2 variant, requiring immediate and decisive action to minimize COVID-19 morbidity and mortality.","Washington, Nicole L.; Gangavarapu, Karthik; Zeller, Mark; Bolze, Alexandre; Cirulli, Elizabeth T.; Barrett, Kelly M.

Among these, endothelial injury has been proposed as one of the main pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the disease, promoting a hyperinflammatory and prothrombotic state leading to worse clinical outcomes. Leukocytes and platelets play a key role in inflammation and thrombogenesis, hence the objective of the current study was to study whether neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelets-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), the systemic immune-inflammation index (SII) as well as the new parameter neutrophil-to-platelet ratio (NPR), could help identify patients who at risk of admission at Intensive Care Units. METHODS: A retrospective observational study was performed at HM Hospitales including electronic health records from 2245 patients admitted due to COVID-19 from March 1 to June 10, 2020. Patients were divided into two groups, admitted at ICU or not. RESULTS: Patients who were admitted at the ICU had significantly higher values in all hemogram-derived ratios at the moment of hospital admission compared to those who did not need ICU admission. Specifically, we found significant differences in NLR (6.9 [4–11.7] vs 4.1 [2.6–7.6], p < 0.0001), PLR (2 [1.4–3.3] vs 1.9 [1.3–2.9], p = 0.023), NPR (3 [2.1–4.2] vs 2.3 [1.6–3.2], p < 0.0001) and SII (13 [6.5–25.7] vs 9 [4.9–17.5], p < 0.0001) compared to those who did not require ICU admission.

Maintenance of continuous cold chain at every step increases the final cost of vaccines. Any breach in the cold chain even for a short duration results in the need to discard the vaccines. As a result, there is a pressing need for the development of thermostable vaccines. In this proof-of-concept study, we showed that E. coli curli-green fluorescent fusion protein remains stable in freeze-dried yeast powder for more than 18 and 12 months when stored at 30 °C and 37 °C respectively. Stability of the heterologous protein remains unaffected during the process of heat-inactivation and lyophilization. The mass of lyophilized yeast powder remains almost unchanged during the entire period of storage and expressed protein remains intact even after two cycles of freeze and thaws. The protease-deficient strain appears ideal for the development of whole recombinant yeast-based vaccines. The cellular abundance of expressed antigen in dry powder after a year was comparable to freshly lyophilized cells. Scanning electron microscopy showed the intact nature of cells in powdered form even after a year of storage at 30 °C. Observation made in this study showed that freeze-dry yeast powder can play a vital role in the development of thermostable vaccines. Key Points • Yeast-based vaccines can overcome problem of cold chain associated with conventional vaccines • Lyophilized yeast powder can be a simple way for long-term storage of immunogen(s) • Protease deficient strain is important for whole recombinant yeast-based vaccines","Kumar, Ravinder; Kharbikar, Bhushan N.",Appl Microbiol Biotechnol,293,16

The study’s main aim was to develop road traffic noise models using a graph theory approach involving the parameters related to road traffic subsystem. The road traffic subsystem variables selected for the modeling purposes included vehicular speed, traffic volume, carriageway width, number of heavy vehicles, and number of honking events. The interaction of the selected variables considered in the form of permanent noise function is given in the matrix form. Eigenvalues and corresponding eigenvectors are calculated for removing any human judgmental error. The permanent noise function matrix was then updated using the eigenvectors, which was ultimately utilized for obtaining the permanent noise index. Data regarding the selected variables were collected for three months, and the noise parameters included in the study were equivalent noise level (L(eq,1h)), maximum noise level (L(10,1h)), and background noise level (L(90,1h)). A logarithmic transformation was applied to the permanent noise index and linear regression models were developed for L(eq,1h) , L(90,1h) , and L(10,1h) respectively. The models were validated using the data collected from the same locations for nine months. The models were found to provide satisfactory results, although the results were somewhat overestimated. The method can prove beneficial for estimating future noise levels, given the expected changes in values for the independent variables considered in the study.","Gilani, Towseef Ahmed; Mir, Mohammad Shafi",Environ Sci Pollut Res Int,293,1

Restrictions impacted individuals’ psychological health, especially in those with eating disorders (ED). Healthcare providers (HCPs) treating ED provided assistance by telemedicine and/or in walk-in clinics. We hypothesize that social restrictions represented a great stressor for ED patients and HCPs, negatively impacted their therapeutic alliance, and affected the frequency of dysfunctional behaviors. METHODS: This cross-sectional study consisted of an online survey investigating the experience of HCPs involved in ED treatment, with a specific focus on difficulties concerning the therapeutic efficacy. Questionnaire (n. 18 questions) was formulated ad hoc by our research team and sent by e-mail to Italian HCPs registered on online platforms. HCPs included ED experts specialized in psychology, nutrition or medicine. Data were collected during lockdown phase I and referred to patients with Anorexia Nervosa-(AN), Bulimia Nervosa (BN)—and Binge-Eating Disorder-(BED). RESULTS: One-hundred questionnaires were collected; 84 and 76 were included in our qualitative and quantitative analyses, respectively. Thirty-six% of HCPs felt their therapeutic intervention was unsuccessful, 37% complained compromised therapeutic alliance. Changes in frequency of compensatory behaviors (increased in 41% AN and 49,5% BN; reduced in 14,6% AN and 21,8% BN) and binge-eating episodes (increased in 53,3% BN and 30,5% BED; reduced in 30,7% BN and 24,7% BED) were experienced and ascribed to augmented patient’s anxiety. Disorders switches and variation in dysfunctional conducts frequency were both significantly related to ED category (p < 0.05 for all). Concentration techniques were recognized as useful to offset such negative outcomes. CONCLUSION: According to HCPs, social restrictions affected the frequency of dysfunctional behaviors in ED patients and the efficacy of their therapeutic intervention. Further long-term studies are needed to confirm our data in a larger sample size. LEVEL IV: Novel results from a cross-sectional study.

Recent studies have shown that the “cytokine storm” (high concentration of proinflammatory cytokines) may contribute to the mortality of COVID-19. Repeated exposure to the virus can lead to a dose-dependent immune response that may be associated with more disease severity and higher mortality. Sudden deterioration/increased oxygen consumption after initial improvement may be due to multiple surges of cytokines storm within a short period, the possible cause may be due to multiple exposures within the incubation period. We hypothesize that multiple surges in cytokines storm in some patients may be due to multiple exposures of the same patient within the incubation period, sepsis, or other inflammatory lesions inside the body. In our cases, sepsis as a cause of cytokine storm was ruled out by doing the procalcitonin test, which was within the normal limit.

Using RNA antisense purification and mass spectrometry, we identified up to 104 human proteins that directly and specifically bind to SARS-CoV-2 RNAs in infected human cells. We integrated the SARS-CoV-2 RNA interactome with changes in proteome abundance induced by viral infection and linked interactome proteins to cellular pathways relevant to SARS-CoV-2 infections. We demonstrated by genetic perturbation that cellular nucleic acid-binding protein (CNBP) and La-related protein 1 (LARP1), two of the most strongly enriched viral RNA binders, restrict SARS-CoV-2 replication in infected cells and provide a global map of their direct RNA contact sites. Pharmacological inhibition of three other RNA interactome members, PPIA, ATP1A1, and the ARP2/3 complex, reduced viral replication in two human cell lines.

In this context, users’ participation in social media has become one of the main indicators of their effectiveness, highlighting the importance of analyzing which factors enhance online engagement. This research extends the number of variables identified in prior studies and analyzes 19,817 Facebook posts from 126 health organizations. Using multivariate linear regression, explanatory results show that economic and organizational attributes, and factors related to the social media posts, both contribute significantly to explain the engagement reached in social media by those organizations. According to our findings, health organizations are not taking enough advantage of social media to engage with their current and potential users. The dissemination of relevant information using visually attractive formats could help draw the attention of consumers, both to reach a higher commitment with the organization and to create value for society.","Alonso-Cañadas, Juana; Galán-Valdivieso, Federico; Saraite-Sariene, Laura; Caba-Pérez, Carmen",Int J Environ Res Public Health,293,26

There are two important uncertainties in the management of people with diabetes undergoing major surgery: (1) how to improve diabetes management in the weeks leading up to an elective procedure and (2) whether that improved management leads to improved postoperative outcomes. The aim of this study was to develop and pilot a specialist diabetes team-led intervention to improve surgical outcomes in people with diabetes. DESIGN: Open pilot feasibility study SETTING: Diabetes and cardiothoracic surgery departments, University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust PARTICIPANTS: Seventeen people with diabetes undergoing cardiothoracic surgery INTERVENTION: Following two rapid literature reviews, a prototype intervention was developed based on a previously used nurse-led outpatient intervention and tested. PRIMARY OUTCOME: Feasibility and acceptability of delivering the intervention SECONDARY OUTCOMES: Biomedical data were collected at baseline and prior to surgery. We assessed how the intervention was used. In depth qualitative interviews with participants and healthcare professionals were used to explore perceptions and experiences of the intervention and how it might be improved. RESULTS: Thirteen of the 17 people recruited completed the study and underwent cardiothoracic surgery. All components of the OCTOPuS intervention were used, but not all parts were used for all participants. Minor changes were made to the intervention as a result of feedback from the participants and healthcare professionals. Median (IQR) HbA(1c) was 10 mmol/mol (3, 13) lower prior to surgery than at baseline. CONCLUSION: This study has shown that it is possible to develop a clinical pathway to improve diabetes management prior to admission. The clinical and cost-effectiveness of this intervention will now be tested in a multicentre randomised controlled trial in cardiothoracic centres across the UK.

COVID-19 is usually mild and non-fatal in children. However, in rare cases, children could severely be affected, and clinical manifestations may differ from adults. A multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a rare but serious complication associated with COVID-19, initiated by an overactive immune response in kids that usually hits weeks after exposure to the COVID-19. MIS-C is a disorder in which inflammation could occur in different parts of the body. The disease puts pressure on the heart, as blood vessels leading towards the heart get inflamed and incapable of carrying adequate blood, hence producing cardiac complications in children hospitalised with MIS-C. The problem seems to be associated with COVID-19 in children; however, the association between MIS-C and COVID-19 is still unidentified. There is very little understanding of what triggers the MIS-C, which necessitates a rigorous mapping of the disease and associated risk elements for better disease management and navigating through this crisis.","Shakeel, Sadia; Ahmad Hassali, Mohamed Azmi",Malays J Med Sci,293,1

In 2020, there was a global outbreak of COVID-19, resulting in an unprecedented global burden of disease, health care costs, and had a significant economic impact. Recently, SARS-CoV-2 was detected on the outer packaging of imported cold chain items in China and has led to virus transmission events, causing great concern. This paper analyses the factors of SARS-CoV-2 survival and transmission in different places and environments, especially the characteristics of low temperatures and object surfaces. It was found that SARS-CoV-2 could survive on surfaces of cold and moist objects in the cold chain for more than 3 weeks, potentially causing COVID-19 transmission. We believe that the low-temperature environment in winter may accelerate the spread of the outbreak and new outbreaks may occur. Overall, SARS-CoV-2 transmission that is susceptible to low winter temperatures is critical for predicting winter pandemics, allowing for the appropriate action to be taken in advance.","Chi, Yuhua; Wang, Qingxiu; Chen, Guosheng; Zheng, Shiliang",Front Public Health,293,23

METHODS: We performed a longitudinal, cross‐sectional email survey of clinically active emergency physicians (attending, fellow, and resident) at seven academic emergency departments. Follow‐up surveys were sent 4 to 6 weeks after the initial survey and assessed the following: COVID‐19 patient exposure, availability of COVID‐19 testing, levels of home and workplace anxiety/stress, changes in behaviors, and performance on a primary care posttraumatic stress disorder screen (PC‐PTSD‐5). Logistic regression explored factors associated with a high PC‐PTSD‐5 scale score (≥3), indicating increased risk for PTSD. RESULTS: Of the 426 surveyed initial respondents, 262 (61.5%) completed the follow‐up survey. While 97.3% (255/262) reported treating suspected COVID‐19 patients, most physicians (162/262, 61.8%) had not received testing themselves. In follow‐up, respondents were most concerned about the relaxing of social distancing leading to a second wave (median score = 6, IQR = 4–7). Physicians reported a consistently high ability to order COVID‐19 tests for patients (median score = 6, IQR = 5–7) and access to personal protective equipment (median score = 6, IQR = 5–6). Women physicians were more likely to score ≥ 3 than men on the PC‐PTSD‐5 screener on the initial survey (43.3% vs. 22.5%; Δ 20.8%, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 9.3% to 31.5%), and despite decreases in overall proportions, this discrepancy remained in follow‐up (34.7% vs. 16.8%; Δ 17.9%, 95% CI = 7.1% to 28.1%). In examining the relationship between demographics, living situations, and institution location on having a PC‐PTSD‐5 score ≥ 3, only female sex was associated with a PC‐PTSD‐5 score ≥ 3 (adjusted odds ratio = 2.48, 95% CI = 1.28 to 4.79). CONCLUSIONS: While exposure to suspected COVID‐19 patients was nearly universal, stress levels in emergency physicians decreased with time. At both initial and follow‐up assessments, women were more likely to test positive on the PC‐PTSD‐5 screener compared to men.","Baumann, Brigitte M.; Cooper, Richelle J.; Medak, Anthony J.; Lim, Stephen; Chinnock, Brian; Frazier, Remi; Roberts, Brian W.; Epel, Elissa S.; Rodriguez, Robert M.",Acad Emerg Med,293,16
