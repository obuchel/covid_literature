11,Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 regulates RNA synthesis of a cytoplasmic virus,2000-09-01,"Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP A1) is involved in pre-mRNA splicing in the nucleus and translational regulation in the cytoplasm. In the present study, we demonstrate that hnRNP A1 also participates in the transcription and replication of a cytoplasmic RNA virus, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV). Overexpression of hnRNP A1 accelerated the kinetics of viral RNA synthesis, whereas the expression in the cytoplasm of a dominant-negative hnRNP A1 mutant that lacks the nuclear transport domain significantly delayed it. The hnRNP A1 mutant caused a global inhibition of viral mRNA transcription and genomic replication, and also a preferential inhibition of the replication of defective-interfering RNAs. Similar to the wild-type hnRNP A1, the hnRNP A1 mutant complexed with an MHV polymerase gene product, the nucleocapsid protein and the viral RNA. However, in contrast to the wild-type hnRNP A1, the mutant protein failed to bind a 250 kDa cellular protein, suggesting that the recruitment of cellular proteins by hnRNP A1 is important for MHV RNA synthesis. Our findings establish the importance of cellular factors in viral RNA-dependent RNA synthesis.","Shi, Stephanie T.; Huang, Peiyong; Li, Hsin-Pai; Lai, Michael M.C.",The EMBO Journal,http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc302072?pdf=render,11
574,Macrophage-Mediated Optic Neuritis Induced by Retrograde Axonal Transport of Spike Gene Recombinant Mouse Hepatitis Virus,2011-06-01,"Following intracranial inoculation, neurovirulent mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) strains induce acute inflammation, demyelination and axonal loss in the CNS. Prior studies using recombinant MHV strains that differ only in the spike gene, which encodes a glycoprotein involved in virus-host cell attachment, demonstrated that spike mediates anterograde axonal transport of virus to the spinal cord. A demyelinating MHV strain induces optic neuritis, but whether this is due to retrograde axonal transport of viral particles to the retina, or if it is due to traumatic disruption of retinal ganglion cell axons during intracranial inoculation is not known. Using recombinant isogenic MHV strains, we examined the ability of recombinant MHV to induce optic neuritis by retrograde spread from the brain through the optic nerve into the eye following intracranial inoculation. Recombinant demyelinating MHV induced macrophage infiltration of optic nerves, demyelination and axonal loss whereas optic neuritis and axonal injury were minimal in mice infected with the non-demyelinating MHV strain that differs in the spike gene. Thus, optic neuritis was dependent on a spike glycoprotein-mediated mechanism of viral antigen transport along retinal ganglion cell axons. These data indicate that MHV spreads by retrograde axonal transport to the eye and that targeting spike protein interactions with axonal transport machinery is a potential therapeutic strategy for CNS viral infections and associated diseases.","Shindler, Kenneth S.; Chatterjee, Dhriti; Biswas, Kaushiki; Goyal, Ashish; Dutt, Mahasweta; Nassrallah, Mayssa; Khan, Reas S.; Sarma, Jayasri Das",Journal of Neuropathology & Experimental Neurology,https://academic.oup.com/jnen/article-pdf/70/6/470/9561356/70-6-470.pdf,11
655,Quercetin 7-rhamnoside reduces porcine epidemic diarrhea virus replication via independent pathway of viral induced reactive oxygen species,2011-10-04,"BACKGROUND: On the base of our previous study we were observed relevant studies on the hypothesis that the antiviral activity of quercetin 7-rhamnoside (Q7R), a flavonoid, won't relate ability of its antioxidant. METHODS: We were investigated the effects of Q7R on the cytopathic effects (CPE) by CPE reduction assay. Production of DNA fragment and reactive oxygen species (ROS) induced by PEDV infection were studied using DNA fragmentation assay and flow cytometry. RESULTS: In the course of this study it was discovered that Q7R is an extremely potent compound against PEDV. The addition of Q7R to PEDV-infected Vero cells directly reduced the formation of a visible cytopathic effect (CPE). Also, Q7R did not induce DNA fragmentation. Furthermore, ROS increased the infection of PEDV, which was strongly decreased by N-acetyl-L-cysteins (NAC). However, the increased ROS was not decreased by Q7R. Antiviral activity of antioxidants such as NAC, pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC), and the vitamin E derivative, trolox, were hardly noticed. CONCLUSIONS: We concluded that the inhibition of PEDV production by Q7R is not simply due to a general action as an antioxidants and is highly specific, as several other antioxidants (NAC, PDTC, trolox) are inactive against PEDV infection.","Song, Jae Hyoung; Shim, Jae Kwon; Choi, Hwa Jung",Virol J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3200163/,11
726,"3D QSAR Pharmacophore Modeling, in Silico Screening, and Density Functional Theory (DFT) Approaches for Identification of Human Chymase Inhibitors",2011-12-12,"Human chymase is a very important target for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. Using a series of theoretical methods like pharmacophore modeling, database screening, molecular docking and Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations, an investigation for identification of novel chymase inhibitors, and to specify the key factors crucial for the binding and interaction between chymase and inhibitors is performed. A highly correlating (r = 0.942) pharmacophore model (Hypo1) with two hydrogen bond acceptors, and three hydrophobic aromatic features is generated. After successfully validating “Hypo1”, it is further applied in database screening. Hit compounds are subjected to various drug-like filtrations and molecular docking studies. Finally, three structurally diverse compounds with high GOLD fitness scores and interactions with key active site amino acids are identified as potent chymase hits. Moreover, DFT study is performed which confirms very clear trends between electronic properties and inhibitory activity (IC(50)) data thus successfully validating “Hypo1” by DFT method. Therefore, this research exertion can be helpful in the development of new potent hits for chymase. In addition, the combinational use of docking, orbital energies and molecular electrostatic potential analysis is also demonstrated as a good endeavor to gain an insight into the interaction between chymase and inhibitors.","Arooj, Mahreen; Thangapandian, Sundarapandian; John, Shalini; Hwang, Swan; Park, Jong Keun; Lee, Keun Woo",Int J Mol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3257128/,11
1059,Highly similar structural frames link the template tunnel and NTP entry tunnel to the exterior surface in RNA-dependent RNA polymerases,2012-12-25,"RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) is essential to viral replication and is therefore one of the primary targets of countermeasures against these dangerous infectious agents. Development of broad-spectrum therapeutics targeting polymerases has been hampered by the extreme sequence variability of these sequences. RdRps range in length from 400–800 residues, yet contain only ∼20 residues that are conserved in most species. In this study, we made structure-based comparisons that are independent of sequence composition using a recently developed algorithm. We identified residue-to-residue correspondences of multiple protein structures and created (two-dimensional) structure-based alignment maps of 37 polymerase structures that provide both sequence and structure details. Using these maps, we determined that ∼75% of each polymerase species consists of seven protein segments, each of which has high structural similarity to segments in other species, though they are widely divergent in sequence composition and order. We define each of these segments as a ‘homomorph’, and each includes (though most are much larger than) the well-known conserved polymerase motifs. All homomorphs contact the template tunnel or nucleoside triphosphate (NTP) entry tunnel and the exterior of the protein, suggesting they constitute a structural and functional skeleton common among the polymerases.","Lang, Dorothy M.; Zemla, A.

1255,Pathogenic Mouse Hepatitis Virus or Poly(I:C) Induce IL-33 in Hepatocytes in Murine Models of Hepatitis,2013-09-13,"The IL-33/ST2 axis is known to be involved in liver pathologies. Although, the IL-33 levels increased in sera of viral hepatitis patients in human, the cellular sources of IL-33 in viral hepatitis remained obscure. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the expression of IL-33 in murine fulminant hepatitis induced by a Toll like receptor (TLR3) viral mimetic, poly(I:C) or by pathogenic mouse hepatitis virus (L2-MHV3). The administration of poly(I:C) plus D-galactosamine (D-GalN) in mice led to acute liver injury associated with the induction of IL-33 expression in liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSEC) and vascular endothelial cells (VEC), while the administration of poly(I:C) alone led to hepatocyte specific IL-33 expression in addition to vascular IL-33 expression. The hepatocyte-specific IL-33 expression was down-regulated in NK-depleted poly(I:C) treated mice suggesting a partial regulation of IL-33 by NK cells. The CD1d KO (NKT deficient) mice showed hepatoprotection against poly(I:C)-induced hepatitis in association with increased number of IL-33 expressing hepatocytes in CD1d KO mice than WT controls. These results suggest that hepatocyte-specific IL-33 expression in poly(I:C) induced liver injury was partially dependent of NK cells and with limited role of NKT cells. In parallel, the L2-MHV3 infection in mice induced fulminant hepatitis associated with up-regulated IL-33 expression as well as pro-inflammatory cytokine microenvironment in liver. The LSEC and VEC expressed inducible expression of IL-33 following L2-MHV3 infection but the hepatocyte-specific IL-33 expression was only evident between 24 to 32h of post infection. In conclusion, the alarmin cytokine IL-33 was over-expressed during fulminant hepatitis in mice with LSEC, VEC and hepatocytes as potential sources of IL-33.","Arshad, Muhammad Imran; Patrat-Delon, Solène; Piquet-Pellorce, Claire; L’Helgoualc’h, Annie; Rauch, Michel; Genet, Valentine; Lucas-Clerc, Catherine; Bleau, Christian; Lamontagne, Lucie; Samson, Michel",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3772926/,11
1339,A Neutralization Epitope in the Hepatitis C Virus E2 Glycoprotein Interacts with Host Entry Factor CD81,2014-01-06,"The identification of a specific immunogenic candidate that will effectively activate the appropriate pathway for neutralizing antibody production is fundamental for vaccine design. By using a monoclonal antibody (1H8) that neutralizes HCV in vitro, we have demonstrated here that 1H8 recognized an epitope mapped between residues A524 and W529 of the E2 protein. We also found that the epitope residues A524, P525, Y527 and W529 were crucial for antibody binding, while the residues T526, Y527 and W529 within the same epitope engaged in the interaction with the host entry factor CD81. Furthermore, we detected “1H8-like” antibodies, defined as those with amino acid-specificity similar to 1H8, in the plasma of patients with chronic HCV infection. The time course study of plasma samples from Patient H, a well-characterized case of post-transfusion hepatitis C, showed that “1H8-like” antibodies could be detected in a sample collected almost two years after the initial infection, thus confirming the immunogenicity of this epitope in vivo. The characterization of this neutralization epitope with a function in host entry factor CD81 interaction should enhance our understanding of antibody-mediated neutralization of HCV infections.","Zhao, Zhong; Zhong, Lilin; Elrod, Elizabeth; Struble, Evi; Ma, Li; Yan, Hailing; Harman, Christine; Deng, Lu; Virata-Theimer, Maria Luisa; Liu, Peter; Alter, Harvey; Grakoui, Arash; Zhang, Pei",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3882236/,11

The gut microbiota may play a critical role in the gut health of the host. We herein attempted to identify a microbiota shift that may be affected by porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED). We observed significant differences in microbiota between the control and PED virus (PEDV)-infected groups at both the phylum and genus level. Most commensal bacteria (i.e. Psychrobacter, Prevotella, and Faecalibacterium) in the healthy gastrointestinal tract were decreased due to dysbiosis induced by PEDV infection.","Koh, Hyeon-Woo; Kim, Myun Soo; Lee, Jong-Soo; Kim, Hongik; Park, Soo-Je",Microbes Environ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4567570/,11

2511,Ultrasensitive Detection of Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus from Fecal Samples Using Functionalized Nanoparticles,2016-12-09,"Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is the main causative agent of porcine diarrhea, which has resulted in devastating damage to swine industry and become a perplexed global problem. PEDV infection causes lesions and clinical symptoms, and infected pigs often succumb to severe dehydration. If there is not a timely and effective method to control its infection, PEDV will spread rapidly across the whole swine farm. Therefore, preclinical identification of PEDV is of great significance for preventing the outbreak and spread of this disease. In this study, a functionalized nanoparticles-based PCR method (UNDP-PCR) specific for PEDV was developed through systematic optimization of functionalized magnetic beads and gold nanoparticles which were further used to specifically enrich viral RNA from the lysate of PEDV stool samples, forming a MMPs-RNA-AuNPs complex. Then, oligonucleotides specific for PEDV coated on AuNPs were eluted from the complex and were further amplified and characterized by PCR. The detection limitation of the established UNDP-PCR method for PEDV was 25 copies in per gram PEDV stool samples, which is 400-fold more sensitive than conventional RT-PCR for stool samples. The UNDP-PCR for PEDV exhibited reliable reproducibility and high specificity, no cross-reaction was observed with other porcine viruses. In 153 preclinical fecal samples, the positive detection rate of UNDP-PCR specific for PEDV (30.72%) was much higher than that of conventional RT-PCR (5.88%) and SYBR Green real-time RT-PCR. In a word, this study provided a RNA extraction and transcription free, rapid and economical method for preclinical PEDV infection, which showed higher sensitivity, specificity and reproducibility, and exhibited application potency for evaluating viral loads of preclinical samples.","Xing, Na; Guan, Xiaoxiao; An, Bin; Cui, Beibei; Wang, Zengguo; Wang, Xiaoya; Zhang, Xiujuan; Du, Qian; Zhao, Xiaomin; Huang, Yong; Tong, Dewen",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5147876/,11
2670,The Functional Roles of the Cis-acting Elements in Bamboo mosaic virus RNA Genome,2017-04-13,"Bamboo mosaic virus (BaMV), which belongs to the genus Potexvirus in the family Alphaflexiviridae, has a single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome that is approximately 6400 nucleotides (nts) in length. Positive-sense RNA viruses can use genomic RNA as a template for translation and replication after entering a suitable host cell. Furthermore, such viral RNA is recognized by capsid protein for packaging and by viral movement protein(s) or the movement protein complex for cell-to-cell and systemic movement. Hence, viral RNA must contain signals for different functions to complete the viral infection cycle. In this review, we examine various cis-acting elements in the genome of BaMV. The highly structured 3′ untranslated region (UTR) of the BaMV genomic RNA plays multiple roles in the BaMV infection cycle, including targeting chloroplasts for RNA replication, providing an initiation site for the synthesis of minus-strand RNA, signaling for polyadenylation, and directing viral long-distance movement. The nt at the extreme 3′ end and the structure of the 3′-terminus of minus-strand RNA are involved in the initiation of plus-strand genomic RNA synthesis. Both these regions have been mapped and reported to interact with the viral-encoded RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Moreover, the sequences upstream of open reading frames (ORFs) 2, 3, and 5 are involved in regulating subgenomic RNA synthesis. The cis-acting elements that were identified in BaMV RNA are discussed and compared with those of other potexviruses.","Chen, I-Hsuan; Huang, Ying-Wen; Tsai, Ching-Hsiu",Front Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5390519/,11
3318,Label‐Free Quantitative Proteomic Analysis of Differentially Expressed Membrane Proteins of Pulmonary Alveolar Macrophages Infected with Highly Pathogenic Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus and Its Attenuated Strain,2017-11-24,"Significant differences exist between the highly pathogenic (HP) porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) and its attenuated pathogenic (AP) strain in the ability to infect host cells. The mechanisms by which different virulent strains invade host cells remain relatively unknown. In this study, pulmonary alveolar macrophages (PAMs) are infected with HP‐PRRSV (HuN4) and AP‐PRRSV (HuN4‐F112) for 24 h, then harvested and subjected to label‐free quantitative MS. A total of 2849 proteins are identified, including 95 that are differentially expressed. Among them, 26 proteins are located on the membrane. The most differentially expressed proteins are involved in response to stimulus, metabolic process, and immune system process, which mainly have the function of binding and catalytic activity. Cluster of differentiation CD163, vimentin (VIM), and nmII as well as detected proteins are assessed together by string analysis, which elucidated a potentially different infection mechanism. According to the function annotations, PRRSV with different virulence may mainly differ in immunology, inflammation, immune evasion as well as cell apoptosis. This is the first attempt to explore the differential characteristics between HP‐PRRSV and its attenuated PRRSV infected PAMs focusing on membrane proteins which will be of great help to further understand the different infective mechanisms of HP‐PRRSV and AP‐PRRSV.","Qu, Zehui; Gao, Fei; Li, Liwei; Zhang, Yujiao; Jiang, Yifeng; Yu, Lingxue; Zhou, Yanjun; Zheng, Hao; Tong, Wu; Li, Guoxin; Tong, Guangzhi",Proteomics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6084361/,11

3758,Visual detection of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus using a novel reverse transcription polymerase spiral reaction method,2019-04-15,"BACKGROUND: Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is a major etiological agent of porcine epidemic diarrhea around the world. Point-of-care testing in the field is lacking owing to the requirement for a simple, robust field applicable test that does not require professional laboratory equipment. The aim of this study was to establish a novel reverse transcription polymerase spiral reaction (RT-PSR) assay for the rapid detection of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV). For the assay, a specific RT-PSR primer pair was designed against a conserved region in PEDV ORF3. RESULTS: The RT-PSR was optimized, and PEDV could be detected after a 50 min incubation at 62 °C, in addition to the 15 min required for reverse transcription. No cross-reaction with other porcine infectious viruses was observed. This new method for PEDV detection was 10 times more sensitive than the conventional reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay. The positive rates for 65 clinical samples using the new RT-PSR assay and the conventional RT-PCR assay were 58.46% (38/65) and 53.84% (35/65), respectively. In the RT-PSR assay, the addition of a mixture of dyes allowed a positive reaction to be directly observed by the naked eye. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that this RT-PSR assay is capable of accurately detecting PEDV, and has the advantages of high specificity and sensitivity for the detection of PEDV.","Wang, Xueyu; Xu, Xin; Hu, Wen; Zuo, Kejing; Li, Zhili; Kan, Yunchao; Yao, Lunguang; Ji, Jun; Bi, Yingzuo",BMC Vet Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6466714/,11
3816,Mechanism of Inhibition of Ebola Virus RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase by Remdesivir,2019-04-04,"Remdesivir (GS-5734) is a 1′-cyano-substituted adenosine nucleotide analogue prodrug that shows broad-spectrum antiviral activity against several RNA viruses. This compound is currently under clinical development for the treatment of Ebola virus disease (EVD). While antiviral effects have been demonstrated in cell culture and in non-human primates, the mechanism of action of Ebola virus (EBOV) inhibition for remdesivir remains to be fully elucidated. The EBOV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) complex was recently expressed and purified, enabling biochemical studies with the relevant triphosphate (TP) form of remdesivir and its presumptive target. In this study, we confirmed that remdesivir-TP is able to compete for incorporation with adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Enzyme kinetics revealed that EBOV RdRp and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) RdRp incorporate ATP and remdesivir-TP with similar efficiencies. The selectivity of ATP against remdesivir-TP is ~4 for EBOV RdRp and ~3 for RSV RdRp. In contrast, purified human mitochondrial RNA polymerase (h-mtRNAP) effectively discriminates against remdesivir-TP with a selectivity value of ~500-fold. For EBOV RdRp, the incorporated inhibitor at position i does not affect the ensuing nucleotide incorporation event at position i+1. For RSV RdRp, we measured a ~6-fold inhibition at position i+1 although RNA synthesis was not terminated. Chain termination was in both cases delayed and was seen predominantly at position i+5. This pattern is specific to remdesivir-TP and its 1′-cyano modification. Compounds with modifications at the 2′-position show different patterns of inhibition. While 2′-C-methyl-ATP is not incorporated, ara-ATP acts as a non-obligate chain terminator and prevents nucleotide incorporation at position i+1. Taken together, our biochemical data indicate that the major contribution to EBOV RNA synthesis inhibition by remdesivir can be ascribed to delayed chain termination. The long distance of five residues between the incorporated nucleotide analogue and its inhibitory effect warrant further investigation.","Tchesnokov, Egor P.; Feng, Joy Y.; Porter, Danielle P.; Götte, Matthias",Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6520719/,11
4230,Microarray analysis reveals the inhibition of intestinal expression of nutrient transporters in piglets infected with porcine epidemic diarrhea virus,2019-12-24,"Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) infection can induce intestinal dysfunction, resulting in severe diarrhea and even death, but the mode of action underlying these viral effects remains unclear. This study determined the effects of PEDV infection on intestinal absorption and the expression of genes for nutrient transporters via biochemical tests and microarray analysis. Sixteen 7-day-old healthy piglets fed a milk replacer were randomly allocated to one of two groups. After 5-day adaption, piglets (n = 8/group) were orally administrated with either sterile saline or PEDV (the strain from Yunnan province) at 10(4.5) TCID(50) (50% tissue culture infectious dose) per pig. All pigs were orally infused D-xylose (0.1 g/kg BW) on day 5 post PEDV or saline administration. One hour later, jugular vein blood samples as well as intestinal samples were collected for further analysis. In comparison with the control group, PEDV infection increased diarrhea incidence, blood diamine oxidase activity, and iFABP level, while reducing growth and plasma D-xylose concentration in piglets. Moreover, PEDV infection altered plasma and jejunal amino acid profiles, and decreased the expression of aquaporins and amino acid transporters (L-type amino acid transporter 1, sodium-independent amino acid transporter, B(°(,+))-type amino acid transport protein, sodium-dependent neutral amino acid transporter 1, sodium-dependent glutamate/aspartate transporter 3, and peptide transporter (1), lipid transport and metabolism-related genes (lipoprotein lipase, apolipoprotein A1, apolipoprotein A4, apolipoprotein C2, solute carrier family 27 member 2, solute carrier family 27 member 4, fatty acid synthase, and long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase (3), and glucose transport genes (glucose transporter-2 and insulin receptor) in the jejunum. However, PEDV administration increased mRNA levels for phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 1, argininosuccinate synthase 1, sodium/glucose co-transporter-1, and cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator in the jejunum. Collectively, these comprehensive results indicate that PEDV infection induces intestinal injury and inhibits the expression of genes encoding for nutrient transporters.","Zhang, Junmei; Zhao, Di; Yi, Dan; Wu, Mengjun; Chen, Hongbo; Wu, Tao; Zhou, Jia; Li, Peng; Hou, Yongqing; Wu, Guoyao",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6930262/,11
4836,Olfactory neural pathway in mouse hepatitis virus nasoencephalitis,1988,"ORF 1a of lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus, strain P (LDV-P), encodes a protein of 2206 amino acids. Eisenberg hydrophobic moment analysis of the protein predicted the presence of eleven transmembrane segments in the C-terminal half of the molecule (amino acids 980–1852) that flank the serine protease domain. cDNAs encoding ORF 1a protein segments encompassing transmembrane segments 5 to 11 and its amphipathic C-terminal end as well as the N-terminal 80 amino acids of the downstream ORF 1b protein were transcribed and the transcripts in vitro translated in the absence and presence of microsomal membranes. The synthesis of the protein products with putative transmembrane segments was enhanced by the presence of the microsomal membranes and the proteins became membrane associated. When synthesized in the absence of membranes they were recovered in the supernatant upon ultracentrifugation of the translation reaction mixtures, whereas they were recovered in the membrane pellet when synthesized in the presence of membranes. Furthermore, the latter proteins were not released from the membranes by disruption of the membrane vesicles in carbonate buffer, pH 11.5, and large portions of the proteins were resistant to digestion by trypsin, chymotrypsin and proteinase K. No N-glycosylation was observed and only little, if any, processing of the protein by the putative serine protease. The results indicate that the C-terminal half of the ORF 1a protein represents a non-glycosylated integral membrane protein. Potential modes of synthesis and function of the protein are discussed. In addition, the results showed that the synthesis of the ORF 1a protein was generally terminated at its termination codon, but that read-through into the ORF 1b gene occurred with low frequency.","Faaberg, K.

4847,Ultrastructure and immuno-cytochemistry of BHK-21 cells infected with a modified Bucyrus strain of equine arteritis virus,1995,"Extract: Two live “attenuated” respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccines were administered intranasally and by aerosol in placebo-controlled trials among asthmatic children hospitalized at National Jewish Hospital and Research Center (NJH). The first vaccine, a 26° -adapted RSV vaccine, was given to 28 children, and a placebo control was given to 25. Twenty-one of 28 vaccinees (75%) had “takes,” as judged by virus shedding and/or rises in serum antibody and/or rises in nasal secretion neutralizing activity. No excess in wheezing was attributable to the vaccine administration, although there was a high background level of acute respiratory symptoms in both vaccinees and control subjects. In an outbreak of natural RSV infection which occurred some months after the vaccine was given, there was some evidence that those who received the vaccine less than 4 months before exposure to wild virus were protected against reinfection. Protection was not evident when this interval was greater than 4 months. The second vaccine, a temperature-sensitive mutant strain (ts-1), was administered to 22 children, and placebo to 21. Thirteen children (59%) had “takes.” In vaccinees under 6 years of age, 7 of 7 had “takes.” Again, no excess wheezing was seen in vaccinees as compared with control subjects, although there was some evidence that upper respiratory symptoms were more frequent in younger vaccinees. Four of 10 vaccinees shed virus with temperature-sensitive characteristics somewhat different from those of the vaccine strain. Vaccine virus was demonstrated to spread to uninoculated or placebo control children. Natural RSV challenge did not occur during the period of study. Speculation: One of two live “attenuated” RSV vaccines may have produced a brief period of protection against natural infection. This finding offers hope that such live vaccines might prevent disease in selected children over a critical time period, such as infants for the 1st year of life, or allergic or asthmatic children during periods of epidemic prevalence. Asthmatic children did not appear to develop symptoms of wheezing after attenuated RSV infection. This finding suggests that the mechanism of wheezing in asthmatic children with RSV infection may be dependent on, among other factors, the virulence of the virus strain (perhaps its capacity to replicate in and, possibly, invade the lower respiratory tract), rather than on an allergic response to antigens introduced into, and limited to, the upper airway. In view of the spread of the ts-1 vaccine and its apparent loss of temperature sensitivity in some vaccinees, the vaccine may have had the potential for reversion to virulence and hence initiation of epidemic disease. These characteristics are undesirable in live respiratory virus vaccines and should, if possible, be avoided in the development of future such vaccines.","Mcintosh, Kenneth; Arbeter, Allan M; Stahl, Marlene K; Orr, Inara A; Hodes, David S; Ellis, Elliot F",Pediatr Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7086601/,11
4853,Mouse hepatitis virus and host determinants of vertical transmission and maternally-derived passive immunity in mice,1988,"Using a sensitive infant mouse bioassay to detect infectious virus, the pattern of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) JHM dissemination in blood and other tissues was examined during the first 5 days following intranasal inoculation. MHV replicated in nasal turbinates of both susceptible BALB and resistant SJL mice from days 1 through 5, but BALB mice had higher titers on days 1 and 2. Viremia was detectable on days 1 through 5 in BALB mice, but only on days 3 and 5 in SJL mice. Transient virus replication occurred in the lungs of both mouse genotypes at 1 and 2 days, then ceased. This correlated with more consistently demonstrable virus in blood collected from the left atrium of the heart, compared to jugular vein, portal vein and right atrial blood. Virus was associated equally with the plasma and cellular fractions of blood on day 3, but was primarily in the buffy coat of the cellular fraction on day 5. Interferon-α/β was detected in serum and spleen, but not liver or brain of BALB mice or in any tissue of SJL mice.

The distribution of virus in nose, cervical, axillary and mesenteric lymph nodes, spleen, Peyer's patch, thymus, bone marrow and liver was examined at 1, 2, and 3 days. The resulting pattern suggested lymphatic spread of virus to cervical lymph node and mesenteric lymph node as pathways of dissemination in addition to viremia.","Barthold, S.

The earliest lesions were characterized by decreased MBP and MAG and increased GFAP. During the further progression of the disease, MBP and MAG losses continued to match each other. There was no indication of MAG loss preceding the disappearance of MBP. In the more advanced lesions there was a marked decrease of GFAP positive cells. Since these findings differed considerably from similar immunohistochemical studies in progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) where demyelination results from oligodendroglial infection, it was concluded that the oligodendroglial cell body is not the primary target of CDV. The marked astroglial changes were also considered to contribute to demyelination in CDV infection but the mechanism by which this happens remains unknown.","Vandevelde, M.; Bichsel, P.; Cerruti-Sola, S.; Steck, A.; Kristensen, F.; Higgins, R.

Six months after neonatal infection, virus concentration in serum was 10(2) to 10(4) rabbit-infectious doses per ml, the level of IgG appeared elevated, and serum rendered non-infectious by ether-treatment had a protective effect in passive immunisation experiments. No evidence of glomerulonephritis or deposits of immunoglobulins could be demonstrated in the kidneys.

4894,Asymptomatic infection of mouse hepatitis virus in the rat,1979,"INTRODUCTION: Acute respiratory tract infections (ARI) in children are often treated with antibiotics even without evidence of bacterial infection. Serum procalcitonin (PCT) is elevated in bacterial but not in viral infections. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of children in the PID-ARI.net study on respiratory infections to address the question of whether plasma PCT could potentially distinguish between bacterial infections requiring antibiotic therapy and viral ARI. We analysed data on 327 children who had been included in the German PID-ARI.net study and in whom nasopharyngeal aspirates had been analysed with a 19-valent multiplex reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction–enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for viral and atypical bacterial pathogens. Serum PCT was determined using a quantitative immunoassay (BRAHMS Kryptor PCTsensitive, Henningsdorf, Germany). We then focussed specifically on those children who were treated with antibiotics and therefore had been suspected of having bacterial infection but who had a serum PCT level lower than 0.1 ng/ml. RESULTS: Out of 327 children, 132 had serum PCT levels below 0.1 ng/ml. Of these 132, 38 children had been treated with antibiotics. After exclusion of 26 patients (with critical illnesses, antibiotics on admission or for reasons other than ARI), 12 children remained for further evaluation. Of these 12 children, four had atypical pneumonia; four others had positive virus testing, and, in the last four, the aetiology of ARI remained unknown; evidence of bacterial infection could not be detected in any. CONCLUSIONS: Taken the results of this retrospective analysis, serum PCT values below 0.1 ng/ml might be a marker to identify children with acute respiratory tract infection in whom antibiotic treatment could be withheld. However, only a prospective intervention trial will prove the general safety of this limit.","Schützle, Heike; Forster, Johannes; Superti-Furga, Andrea; Berner, Reinhard",Eur J Pediatr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7086784/,11

Addition of inhibitors of oxidative phosphorylation leads to a rapid, total depletion of ATP in infected cells at pH 6 and results in an inhibition of polykaryocyte formation. However, when cells were exposed for only a few minutes to pH 6 in the presence of the inhibitors and then kept at pH 7.2, the ATP level partially recovered to values sufficient for syncytium formation. Similar results were obtained after ATP depletion induced by 2-deoxyglucose.

Primary cultures of murine, feline, and human microglia and astrocytes were infected with several different rabies viruses: two unpassaged street virus isolates, a cell culture-adapted strain, and a mouse brain-passaged strain. Infection, as determined by immunofluorescence, was detected in 15 of the 16 (94%) virus-glial cell combinations. Replication of infectious virus, determined by infectivity assay, was detected in 7 of the 8 (88%) virus-cell combinations.

The S1 glycoprotein gene of IBV isolates were amplified by reverse transcriptase – polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and analyzed by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis. Fifteen Korean IBV isolates were classified into 4 groups by their RFLP patterns using restriction enzymes, HaeIII, BstYI, and XcmI. The RFLP patterns for 3, 1, and 1 of 15 isolates corresponded to the patterns of IBV Arkansas, Connecticut, and Massachusetts strains, respectively. Ten of 15 isolates generated unique KM91 RFLP pattern that was observed in the IBV KM 91 strain previously isolated in Korea. To confirm genetic diversity in the S1 genes of IBV isolates, viral RNAs of representative 9 of 15 IBV isolates were amplified, cloned, sequenced and compared with published sequences for non-Korean IBV strains. Korean IBV isolates showed amino acid sequence similarity between 61.8% (K446-01 and K161-02) and 96.1% (K281-01 and K210-02) with each other and they showed amino acid sequence similarity between 42.9% (K161-02 and GA980470) and 96.5% (K203-02 and KB8523) compared to non-Korean IBV strains. By phylogenetic tree analysis, Korean IBV field isolates were branched into five clusters in which 3 clusters were differentiated from non-Korean IBV strains. Especially, Korean IBV isolates K069-01, K507-01, K774-01 and K142-02 formed a separate cluster. It seems that IBVs continue to evolve and IBVs showing various genetic differences may cocirculate in Korea.","Lee, S. K.; Sung, H. W.; Kwon, H.

4985,"On the relative merits of italics, Latin and binomial nomenclature in virus taxonomy",2000,"Coxsackievirus B 5 (CB 5) labeled with tritiated uridine was used to trace the interaction of the virus with explant cultures of porcine ileum. Similarly labeled human poliovirus 1 (PO 1), which is not specifically retained by porcine tissue, was used as a control. The explant procedure employed could maintain ileal tissue in a differentiated state for up to 48 hours. Porcine ileum was acquired from both young (4–6 week-old) and adult (9–11 month-old) animals. Inoculated explants of either absorptive or lymphoid tissue were incubated at temperatures selected to permit either viral adsorption or penetration and elution to occur. Retention of radioactive virus was quantitated by liquid scintillation counting and localized by autoradiography. Only in absorptive tissue explants from young animals did adsorption of CB 5 at 6°C exceed penetration at 37°C. This suggested that incubation at 6°C may not be an appropriate condition for studying enterovirus adsorption in explants. CB 5 penetrated most efficiently into lymphoid tissue explants from young animals, indicating that these tissues could discriminate between CB 5 and PO 1. In explants from adults, CB 5 penetrated equally well into lymphoid and absorptive tissues. Virus penetrated into the absorptive epithelial cells and, possibly, the lamina propria near the villous tips. Low efficiency of penetration, and the non-critical function of these target cells, may help account for the characteristic lack of gastrointestinal symptoms in enterovirus infections.","Heinz, B.

Virus internalization was inhibited and viral protein expression was not detected. When the extracellular medium was buffered at low pH, the ammonium chloride induced block on JV infection was overcome. Furthermore, JV was able to induce fusion of infected cells at pH 5.5 leading to polykaryoctye formation. Taken together, these results demonstrate that JV entry occurs through an endocytic mechanism requiring a low pH dependent membrane fusion.","Castilla, V.; Mersich, S. E.; Candurra, N.

Adenovirus infections can result in severe complications in some cases, such as in adenovirus type 11 infection in immunocompromised patients. However, effective treatment methods for adenovirus infections are currently unavailable. This prompted the search for antiviral agents effective against adenovirus infections. In the present study, adenovirus E1A was targeted by RNA interference (RNAi) using synthetic small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) in an attempt to inhibit viral replication, since adenovirus E1A proteins are known to be involved in the transcriptional activation of the viral and cellular genes necessary for controlling the cell cycle and viral replication. The results indicated that the siRNAs effectively reduced the amount of adenovirus E1A mRNA and the levels of replicative intermediates. Additionally, siRNA-mediated gene silencing inhibited adenovirus replication by suppressing the E1A mRNA. These results suggest that the RNAi-mediated targeting of adenovirus E1A may have a potentially therapeutic effect in controlling adenovirus infections.","Chung, Y.-S.; Kim, M.-K.; Lee, W.-J.; Kang, C.",Arch Virol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7087230/,11

The properties of the interferon produced in the present study are similar to those of other interferons produced in chicken cells. 4. HeLa or BHK-21 cells did not acquire resistance to virus infection, after incubation with interferon produced in CE cells.

Immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis confirmed that the fiber is expressed as a 102 kDa glycoprotein, which is localized to the nucleus of infected cells. To identify the nuclear localization signals (NLS), BAdV-3 fiber deletion mutants and GFP/β-galactosidase fusion proteins were expressed in transfected cells, and subcellular localization was visualized by immunofluorescence microscopy. Analysis of deletion mutants localized the NLS to the N-terminal 41 amino acids. Analysis of the N-terminal 41 amino acids identified a cluster of basic residues between amino acid 14 and 20. Substitution of the basic residues ((16)KAKR(19)) with acidic residues ((16)EAEE(19)) resulted in the accumulation of fiber in the cytoplasm. However, (16)KAKR(19) or (12)VYPYKAKRPNI(22) were not sufficient for efficient transport of a cytoplasmic protein GFP/β-galactosidase to the nucleus. The recombinant BAdV-3 expressing mutant fiber containing (16)EAEE(19) instead of (16)KAKR(19) was unable to replicate efficiently in Madin-Darby bovine kidney cells, suggesting that the NLS of fiber carries out important in vivo functions.","Wu, Q.; Chen, Y.; Kulshreshtha, V.; Tikoo, S.

We identified recent refugees and asylum seekers < 18 years of age admitted to the University Children’s Hospital in Basel, Switzerland, in 2015. A retrospective analysis was performed using electronic patient records. We identified 105 admissions in 93 patients with a median age of 5.7 (IQR 2.6–14.5) years. Eritrea, Syria, and Afghanistan were the most frequent countries of origin. The median duration of admission was 4 (IQR 2–6) days with infections and elective surgical interventions being the most common reason (54.8 and 16.1%, respectively). Most infections were airway, skin, and gastrointestinal in 46.4, 20.2, and 11.9%, respectively. The prevalence of tropical infections was 11.9%. The main pathogens identified were influenza A virus (13.8%), Staphylococcus aureus (10.3%), and rhino/enterovirus (10.3%). Previous medical non-infectious conditions were recorded in 13%. Conclusion: The study revealed a high burden of infections in admitted patients mostly caused by well-known pathogens prevalent also in the local population. Both tropical infections and pre-existing non-infectious conditions are also important in admitted patients.

5023,Studies on avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV): III. Interferon induction by and sensitivity to interferon of IBV,1979,"BACKGROUND: Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) is the causative agent of porcine circovirus-associated disease (PCVAD). Its prevalence in swine herds was first reported in China in 2000. PCV2 infection causes immunosuppression that leads to multiple diseases, causing serious economic problems for the swine industry in China. Since information on the genetic variation of PCV2 in Yunnan province is limited, this study aims to investigate the molecular epidemiological and evolutionary characteristics of PCV2 from 2016 to 2019. METHODS: A total of 279 clinical samples were collected from different regions of Yunnan between 2016 to 2019, and PCV2 was detected by PCR. We then amplified full genomes from the positive samples, and the sequences were analysed for homology and genetic evolution. RESULTS: Overall, 60.93% (170/279) of the screened swine herd samples were positive for PCV2. We sequenced 15 Yunnan province PCV2 strains from positive samples. Analyses of the complete genomes and Cap genes led to the classification of the 15 Yunnan PCV2 strains into PCV2a (2 of 15), PCV2b (1of 15) and PCV2d (12 of 15). All strains shared 94.3–99.9% of their identities with the nucleotide sequences of complete genomes in this study and shared 94.2–99.9% identity with the reference sequences. All strains share 89.4–100% and 86.8–100% of their identities with the nucleotide and amino acid (aa) sequences of Cap, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study provide evidence that PCV2a, PCV2b and PCV2d genotypes coexisted in Yunnan Province from 2016 to 2019, and the priority prevalence genotype was PCV2d. The data provide evidence for the increased genetic diversity and insights into the molecular epidemiology of PCV2. This study also provides basic data for the Yunnan province PCV2 molecular epidemiological survey and accumulates effective materials for the development of PCV2 vaccines.","Lv, Nianci; Zhu, Li; Li, Wengui; Li, Zhilan; Qian, Qisheng; Zhang, Tianyu; Liu, Lu; Hong, Jinmei; Zheng, Xiaolin; Wang, Yuan; Zhang, Yifang; Chai, Jun",BMC Vet Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7087357/,11

It was established between 2005 and 2008 at the Charité in Berlin and termed “New Quality and Quantity Indices in Science” (NewQIS), consisting of the integration of common scientometric parameters such as the h-index and novel visualization techniques including density equalizing mapping. NewQIS was used to assess socio-economic important fields of medicine and sciences. Within NewQIS studies, research activities, citation patterns and their relation to socio-economic figures were analyzed with regard to time periods, countries, continents or even single cities. Within the decade after its establishment, more than 80 NewQIS articles were peer-reviewed and published.

Antiviral activity also appeared in fresh milk stored at 4 C for at least two days. The antiviral activity, which reduced titers of virus by as much as 10,000-fold, only affected enveloped viruses and was localized in the milk lipid fraction. Its appearance in stored milk was apparently due to fatty acids released by the activity of milk lipases, particularly lipoprotein lipase. Antiviral activity in the infants' stomach, however, most likely resulted from the activity of gastric and linguallipases on milk triglycerides and caused the release of antiviral fatty acids. Milk and stomach contents that were antiviral also lysed cultured cells by disruption of their plasma membrane. Cell lysis was also caused by purified linoleic acid, which is a normal constituent of human milk triglycerides.","Isaacs, Charles E.; Thormar, Halldor; Pessolano, Tammy",J Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7109787/,11

7807,Characterization of brain-infiltrating mononuclear cells during infection with mouse hepatitis virus strain JHM(),2002-11-11,"Although the major isoform of myelin basic protein (MBP) in the healthy adult CNS is the 18.5-kDa protein, other isoforms containing exon 2 encoded protein (21.5 kDa and 20.2 kDa) exist and are expressed primarily during myelin formation. Since remyelination is a prominent feature in MS lesions, we examined the frequencies of T cell lines (TCLs) specific for epitopes within exon 2 encoded MBP (X2MBP), and also within 18.5-kDa MBP, in members of a multiplex family with MS. TCLs specific for X2MBP were as prevalent as TCLs specific for immunodominant epitopes within 18.5-kDa MBP. In addition, while frequencies of TCLs specific for 18.5-kDa MBP were no different between the affected and unaffected, the frequency of X2MBP-specific TCLs correlated with disease.","Voskuhl, Rhonda R.; McFarlin, Dale E.; Tranquill, Laura R.; Deibler, Gladys; Stone, Roger; Maloni, Heidi; McFarland, Henry F.",J Neuroimmunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7119790/,11
7815,Envelope proteins of avian infectious bronchitis virus: Purification and biological properties,2002-12-20,"Intracranial inoculation of immunocompetent mice with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) induces a fatal neurologic illness. In this disease a marked increase in MHC class I expression was found, closely associated with viral antigens and inflammatory infiltrates, in meninges, choroid plexus and ventricular ependyma but not within the brain parenchyma. Immunosuppression prevented MHC induction. Mice inoculated at birth had persistent infections, with LCMV antigens found primarily in neurons, but no inflammatory cells or focal increase in MHC class I. Failure of infected neurons to express MHC class I allow them to escape destruction by cytotoxic T cells (CTL) but may increase their susceptibility to be persistently infected by non-lytic viruses.","Mucke, L.; Oldstone, M.B.A.",J Neuroimmunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7119833/,11
7941,Molecular Dissection of Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Virus Putative Nonstructural Protein 2,2006,"The recent publication of the complete genome sequences of Leishmania major, Trypanosoma brucei and Trypanosoma cruzi revealed that each genome contains 8300-12,000 protein-coding genes, of which -6500 are common to all three genomes, and ushers in a new, post-genomic, era for trypanosomatid drug discovery. This vast amount of new information makes possible more comprehensive and accurate target identification using several new computational approaches, including identification of metabolic “choke-points”, searching the parasite proteomes for orthologues of known drug targets, and identification of parasite proteins likely to interact with known drugs and drug-like small molecules. In this chapter, we describe several databases (such as GENEDB, BRENDA, KEGG, METACYC, the THERAPEUTIC TARGET DATABASE, and CHEMBANK) and algorithms (including PATHOLOGIC, PATHWAY HUNTER TOOL, AND AUTODOCK) which have been developed to facilitate the bioinformatic analyses underlying these approaches. While target identification is only the first step in the drug development pipeline, these new approaches give rise to renewed optimism for the discovery of new drugs to combat the devastating diseases caused by these parasites. Traditionally, drug discovery in the trypanosomatids (and other organisms) has proceeded from two different starting points: screening large numbers of existing compounds for activity against whole parasites or more focused screening of compounds for activity against defined molecular targets. Most existing anti-trypanosomatids drugs were developed using the former approach, although the latter has gained much attention in the last twenty years under the rubric of “rational drug design”. Until recently, one of the major bottlenecks in anti-trypanosomatid drug development has been our ability to identify good targets, since only a very small percentage of the total number of trypanosomatid genes were known. That has now changed forever, with the recent (July, 2005) publication of the “Tritryp” (Trypanosonm brucei, Trypanosoma cruzi and Leishmania major) genome sequences.(1-4) This vast amount of information now makes possible several new approaches for target identffication and ushers in a post-genomic era for trypanosomatid drug discovery.","Myler, Peter J.",Drug Targets in Kinetoplastid Parasites,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123030/,11

8562,Characterization of proteins encoded by ORFs 2 to 7 of Lelystad virus,1995-01-10,"Polypeptides of the vaccinia virus envelope exposed on the surface were identified by means of sulfo-N-hydroxysuccinimidobiotin as a surface tag. Among surface expressed polypeptides is the 35-kDa antigen, previously designated Ag35. Both monoclonal (mAb) and monospecific affinity pure antibodies directed against Ag35 neutralized vaccinia infectiousness, indicating that this prominent surface antigen has a function during early virus-host cell interactions. The binding of several monoclonal antibodies to various regions of Ag35 was tested by reacting CNBr fragments, derived from the polypeptide, employing Western blotting. All mAbs tested reacted with the same region of Ag35. Estimation of the molecular weights (MW), based on migration of the CNBr peptides in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, revealed that those partial digestion products which contained a proline-rich 99 amino acid limit digest fragment were present at a position approximately 12.5 kDa larger than that predicted from the DNA sequence. By contrast, partial and limit digest products lacking the proline-rich fragment migrated to the MW position expected from the length of the DNA sequence. This observation demonstrates that departure from a predicted 22.3 kDa to an anomalous MW of Ag35 is conferred by the proline-rich peptide. The surface location of Ag35 was confirmed by immune electron microscopy. In a competition test the binding specificity of mAb and affinity-purified antibodies at the surface of virions could be demonstrated. Evidence for an association of Ag35 with the virus envelope at various stages during biogenesis of vaccinia was obtained by immune electron microscopy of whole mounts and thin sections. Presence of Ag35 as an early component of immature and mature virions, probably residing in the bilayer membrane structure was detected. A distinction can, therefore, be made between Ag35 and several other vaccinia envelope polypeptides which are synthesized as late functions and added during late stages of envelope assembly.","Gordon, James; Mohandas, Anjani; Wilton, Sharon; Dales, Samuel",Virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7130692/,11

A viral diagnosis was established in 38 (39%) of the 98 patients, and a bacterial diagnosis in 19 (19%). Ten (53%) of the 19 patients with bacterial pneumonia had a concurrent viral infection. No clinical, laboratory, or radiographic findings that would reliably differentiate viral from bacterial infection were identified. This study suggests that bacterial pneumonia is more common in pediatric outpatients than previously reported, and that the clinical, laboratory, and radiographic findings in patients with bacterial infection may be indistinguishable from findings in patients with viral infection.","Tumer, Ronald B.; Lande, Arthur E.; Chase, Patricia; Hilton, Nancy; Weinberg, Diana",J Pediatr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7131735/,11
8939,Analysis of a hypervariable region in the 3' non-coding end of the infectious bronchitis virus genome(),2002-11-12,"An immunogenic component was isolated from both the Illinois (propagated in young swine) and the Miller (cell culture-adapted) strains of porcine transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) virus. The viral subunit was released from the virion by sonication and was separated from intact virus and other viral components by isopycnic centrifugation. It had a buoyant density in sucrose of 1.02 g/ml. Further purification consisted of gel filtration through Sephadex G200, in which process the immunogen, with a molecular weight of approximately 25 000, was the last component to be eluted. A group of ten young, weaned swine, inoculated intramuscularly with two or three 1-mg doses of the viral subunit were protected against challenge with virulent TGE virus, probably by the induction of secretory IgA. The immunogen also induced a humoral immune response of variable magnitude (titers ranging from 8 to 5 625) in the animals. These antibodies are not believed to be directly related to protection against infection. They can, however, be easily identified by serologic procedures and may serve as a convenient indicator of responsiveness to the TGE viral immunogen.","Gough, Patricia M.; Ellis, Carmen H.; Frank, Clifford J.; Johnson, Carl J.",Antiviral Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7134058/,11
8953,Molecular determinants of rotavirus virulence: Localization of a potential virulence site in a murine rotavirus VP4,2002-11-13,"Population density and immune status, vectors and virulence of infection, nutritional status, sanitation, genetic susceptibility and medical management of cases, are important factors influencing the incidence and/or severity of virus infections. Thus, the prevalence and clinical importance of virus infections and the need for antiviral drugs differ from place to place and from time to time. National and World Health Statistics of notifications of disease give some index of the incidence of infections but not all virus infections are notifiable. Such statistics can be misleading also through failures to notify from sloth on the part of the physician or, in the absence of pathognomonic symptoms or signs, from errors in diagnosis. Any assessment of the need for new antiviral drugs should consider the availability, safety, effectiveness and cost of alternative measures, including prevention of spread of infection by control of vectors, immunization by use of viral vaccines, or treatment with existing antiviral drugs. Early start of treatment of acute virus infections with existing drugs gives the best results and, where the clinical diagnosis is uncertain, accurate rapid virus diagnosis is of paramount importance. Many virus infections are asymptomatic or of trivial importance and without sequelae. However, new or improved antiviral drugs are needed for the prevention and/or treatment of a number of significant conditions caused by viruses which are not at present adequately controlled. These include upper and lower respiratory tract infections, influenza, chronic hepatitis, gastroenteritis, infectious mononucleosis, measles, rabies, haemorrhagic fevers and warts. Furthermore, such drugs might prove of therapeutic value in the prevention or treatment of virus-associated tumours, such as hepatoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, Burkitt's lymphoma, Kaposi's sarcoma and possibly carcinoma of the cervix.","Freestone, D.S.",Antiviral Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7134137/,11

The actions and cell communication via cytokines in the CNS are designated as the CNS cytokine network, in which microglia and astrocytes play the central roles. To further characterize the CNS cytokine network we investigated the differences in roles of these cells, and found that microglia might contribute to the early phase of cytokine production reaction and that astrocytes might contribute the late phase of the reaction. We also investigated roles of inhibitory cytokines such as TGF β, IL-4, and IL-10, and showed that each might play a distinct role in the inhibitory regulation in the CNS. We summarized our previous report about cellular distribution of cytokine receptors in the CNS cells and discussed their roles in the CNS cytokine network. Finally, we investigated that expression of IL-6 and IL-2 receptors in neuronal and oligodendrocytic differentiation, respectively. From these results, we discussed the features of the CNS cytokine network.","Sawada, Makoto; Suzumura, Akio; Marunouchi, Tohru",Int J Dev Neurosci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7135063/,11

They have been widely used for biomarker discovery and to study protein–protein interactions. The accomplishments of DNA microarray technology, which had enabled massive parallel studies of gene expression, sparked great interest for the development of protein microarrays to achieve similar success at the protein level. Protein microarray detection techniques are often classified as being label‐based and label‐free. Most of the microarray applications have employed labelled detection such as fluorescent, chemiluminescent and radioactive labelling. These labelling strategies have synthetic challenges, multiple label issues and may exhibit interference with the binding site. Therefore, development of sensitive, reliable, high‐throughput, label‐free detection techniques are now attracting significant attention. Label‐free detection techniques monitor biomolecular interactions and simplify the bioassays by eliminating the need for secondary reactants. Moreover, they provide quantitative information for the binding kinetics. In this article, we will review several label‐free techniques, which offer promising applications for the protein microarrays, and discuss their prospects, merits and challenges.","Ray, Sandipan; Mehta, Gunjan; Srivastava, Sanjeeva",Proteomics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7167936/,11

Metabolomics, which aims at characterizing diseases based on their metabolic signatures, has been applied to expand pathophysiological understanding of many diseases. In this exploratory study, we used the untargeted metabolomic analysis to shed new light on the etiology of pCAP. METHODS: Liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry was used to quantify the metabolite content of urine samples collected from children hospitalized for CAP of pneumococcal or viral etiology, ascertained using a conservative algorithm combining microbiological and biochemical data. RESULTS: Fifty‐nine children with CAP were enrolled over 16 months. Pneumococcal and viral cases were distinguished by means of a multivariate model based on 93 metabolites, 20 of which were identified and considered as putative biomarkers. Among these, six metabolites belonged to the adrenal steroid synthesis and degradation pathway. CONCLUSIONS: This preliminary study suggests that viral and pneumococcal pneumonia differently affect the systemic metabolome, with a stronger disruption of the adrenal steroid pathway in pneumococcal pneumonia. This finding may lead to the discovery of novel diagnostic biomarkers and bring us closer to personalized therapy for pCAP.","Del Borrello, Giovanni; Stocchero, Matteo; Giordano, Giuseppe; Pirillo, Paola; Zanconato, Stefania; Da Dalt, Liviana; Carraro, Silvia; Esposito, Susanna; Baraldi, Eugenio",Pediatr Pulmonol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7168041/,11

The goal of the POLLEK study is to assess the quality of life and health status (including mental health) of medical students and young physicians. The aim of the presented paper was to assess the reliability and compatibility of paper and electronic versions of the POLLEK questionnaire. Methods: Between 1 October 2019 and 28 February 2020, all medical students (N = 638) of the first year in the Medical University of Silesia were invited to participate in a cross-sectional study. Three hundred and fifty-three students (55.3%) who accomplished both versions were included in the current analysis. Results: Values of Cronbach’s alpha >0.7 proved both modes of delivery to have good internal consistency, except for the individual Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test (AUDIT) domains and the Environmental domain of the WHOQOL-BREF (paper version). Similarly, interclass correlation coefficients equal to or greater than 0.9 denoted an excellent reproducibility. Conclusions: We documented very good accordance and reproducibility of POLLEK questionnaire (both paper and electronic versions). These findings legitimize the use of the questionnaire interchangeably.","Gajda, Maksymilian; Szemik, Szymon; Sedlaczek, Katarzyna; Kowalska, Małgorzata",Healthcare (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7711888/,11

Despite the early appearance of the virus in Europe, the prevalence and virulence appeared to be low for several weeks, before the spread and severity of symptoms increased exponentially, yet with marked spatial and temporal differences. Here, we compare the possible linkages between peaks of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and the sudden, explosive increase of hospitalizations and mortality rates in the Swiss Canton of Ticino, and the Greater Paris and London regions. We argue that these peaks of fine particulate matter are primarily occurring during thermal inversion of the boundary layer of the atmosphere. We also discuss the influence of Saharan dust intrusions on the COVID-19 outbreak observed in early 2020 on the Canary Islands. We deem it both reasonable and plausible that high PM2.5 concentrations—favored by air temperature inversions or Saharan dust intrusions—are not only modulating but even more so boosting severe outbreaks of COVID-19. Moreover, desert dust events—besides enhancing PM2.5 concentrations—can be a vector for fungal diseases, thereby exacerbating COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. We conclude that the overburdening of the health services and hospitals as well as the high over-mortality observed in various regions of Europe in spring 2020 may be linked to peaks of PM2.5 and likely particular weather situations that have favored the spread and enhanced the virulence of the virus. In the future, we recommended to monitor not only the prevalence of the virus, but also to consider the occurrence of weather situations that can lead to sudden, very explosive COVID-19 outbreaks.","Rohrer, Mario; Flahault, Antoine; Stoffel, Markus",Earth Syst Environ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7679238/,11

Early data from Europe had shown mortality rates of up to 30.4% in patients who develop COVID-19 and a hip fracture. METHOD: Prospective study of patients presenting with a hip fracture between 23/03/2020 and 18/05/2020. Primary outcomes were 30-day mortality and COVID-19 status. Secondary outcomes were length of stay, discharge destination and readmission. RESULTS: 50 patients identified, mean age 82. 49 patients underwent operation, 34 (69.4%) within 48 hours of admission. 14 Patients (28%) tested positive for COVID-19 within 30 days. 30-day mortality was 10% (n = 5). 2 patients who died were COVID-19 positive. Mean length of stay was 12.3 days. 7 patients (14%) re-admitted within 30 days, 4 with COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Despite extra strain on the hospital, we believe we achieved good outcomes for this cohort. Compared to previous NHFD data we decreased our length of stay and time to operation. 30-day mortality increased (8.4% in 2018) but we believe this to be expected in vulnerable patients during a pandemic.

Mortality rates have recently been lower, raising hope that treatments have improved. However, patients are also now younger, with fewer comorbidities. We explored whether hospital mortality was associated with changing demographics at a 3-hospital academic health system in New York. We examined in-hospital mortality or discharge to hospice from March through August 2020, adjusted for demographic and clinical factors, including comorbidities, admission vital signs, and laboratory results. Among 5,121 hospitalizations, adjusted mortality dropped from 25.6% (95% CI, 23.2-28.1) in March to 7.6% (95% CI, 2.5-17.8) in August. The standardized mortality ratio dropped from 1.26 (95% CI, 1.15-1.39) in March to 0.38 (95% CI, 0.12-0.88) in August, at which time the average probability of death (average marginal effect) was 18.2 percentage points lower than in March.

Surgery is the treatment of choice for symptomatic PGLs. A small (7 mm) extra-adrenal PGL was diagnosed in the right retroperitoneal space in a 19-year-old patient affected by symptomatic hypertension unresponsive to medical treatment. Indication to percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (RFA) was given by a multidisciplinary team on the basis of the size of the nodule, the surgical risks, the young age of the patient, and his wish to reduce as much as possible the post-interventional rehabilitation. To our knowledge, the use of percutaneous RFA in the treatment of retroperitoneal extra-adrenal primary paragangliomas has never been described. We describe its feasibility and the patient's clinical outcome.","Ierardi, Anna Maria; Biondetti, Pierpaolo; Ferrante, Giulia; Carugo, Stefano; Carrafiello, Gianpaolo",Cardiovascular and interventional radiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00270-018-2015-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29922859/,11

There remains an unmet need to address the substantial morbidity and mortality associated with severe community-acquired pneumonia (sCAP). Recombinant human plasma gelsolin (rhu-pGSN) improves disease outcomes in diverse animal models of infectious and non-infectious inflammation.Methods. This blinded dose-escalation safety study involved non-ICU patients admitted for mild CAP and randomized 3:1 to receive adjunctive rhu-pGSN or placebo intravenously. Thirty-three subjects were treated: 8 in the single-dose phase and 25 in the multi-dose phase. For the single-dose phase, rhu-pGSN 6 mg/kg was administered once. For the multi-dose phase, a daily rhu-pGSN dose of 6, 12, or 24 mg/kg was given on 3 consecutive days.Results Adverse events (AEs) were generally mild in both treatment groups irrespective of dose. The only serious (S)AE in the single-dose phase was a non-drug related pneumonia in a rhu-pGSN recipient who died after institution of comfort care. One single-dose placebo recipient had a drug-related AE (maculo-papular rash). In the multi-dose phase, there were 2 SAEs in 1 placebo recipient, including a fatal pulmonary embolism. In the 18 rhu-pGSN recipients in the multi-dose phase, there were no serious or drug-related AEs, and nausea and increased blood pressure were each reported in 2 patients. The median rhu-pGSN half-life exceeded 17 hours with all dosing regimens, and supraphysiologic levels were maintained throughout the 24-hour dosing interval in the 2 highest dosing arms.Conclusions Rhu-pGSN was well tolerated overall in CAP patients admitted to non-ICU beds, justifying a larger proof-of-concept trial in an ICU population admitted with sCAP.","Tannous, Abla; Levinson, Susan L; Bolognese, James; Opal, Steven M; DiNubile, Mark J",Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,https://doi.org/10.1128/aac.00579-20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32690640/,11

64610,In vitro antiviral activity and underlying molecular mechanisms of dipotassium glycyrrhetate against porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus.,2013,"OBJECTIVES In accordance with initial guidance from the Royal College of Surgeons and Royal College of Radiologists, we evaluated the utility of CT of the chest in the exclusion of asymptomatic COVID-19 infection prior to elective cancer surgery on self-isolating patients during the pandemic. METHODS All surgical referrals without symptoms of COVID-19 infection in April and May 2020 were included. Patient records were retrospectively reviewed. Screening included CT chest for major thoracic and abdominal surgery. CTs were reported according to British Society of Thoracic Imaging guidelines and correlated with reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and surgical outcomes. RESULTS The prevalence of RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 infection in our screened population was 0.7% (5/681). 240 pre-operative CTs were performed. 3.8% (9/240) of CTs were reported as abnormal, only one of which was RT-PCR positive. 2% (5/240) of cases had surgery postponed based on CT results. All nine patients with CTs reported as abnormal have had surgery, all without complication. CONCLUSION The prevalence of asymptomatic COVID-19 infection in our screened population was low. The pre-test probability of CT chest in asymptomatic, self-isolating patients is consequently low. CT can produce false positives in this setting, introducing unnecessary delay in surgery for a small proportion of cases. ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE Self-isolation, clinical assessment and RT-PCR are effective at minimising COVID-19 related surgical risk. The addition of CT chest is unhelpful. Our data have particular relevance during the second wave of infection and in the recovery phase.","Ap Dafydd, Derfel; O'Mahony, Michelle; Jhanji, Shaman; Devaraj, Anand; Allum, William; Nicol, David; Blunt, Dominic M; Riddell, Angela M",The British journal of radiology,https://doi.org/10.1259/bjr.20200994; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33242245/,11
64686,Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus induces autophagy to promote virus replication.,2012,"BACKGROUND The impact of COVID-19 in healthcare systems globally was unprecedented leading to cancelations of most planned surgical activities. Surgical trainees were redeployed to Intensive Care and Emergency units supporting urgent and unplanned care on COVID-19 patients. Theater exposure, crucial part of surgical training, was reduced to minimal since elective cases were postponed, and emergency operating was carried out by consultants only. Surgical research has also been severely hit with most of the clinical trials been postponed. Teaching activities as well as national and international congresses and surgical courses important tools for continuous professional development were canceled. METHODS The primary aim of our study was to summarize the changes in surgical training during the pandemic. This was followed by a review of the existing social media platforms, video-conferencing platforms along with the role of the social media in surgical training. The crucial role of simulation in surgical training was explored and alternative ways of training with engagement of the feedback mechanisms were proposed. The secondary aim was to highlight possible novel educational strategies for the forthcoming post-COVID-19 era. CONCLUSIONS The ""new"" era forced the educational boards to reexamine training curriculums. Innovation strategies and cooperation on the part of surgical residency programs is crucial. Strong leadership is needed, on the part of the education bodies with restructuring of the surgical programmes to accommodate alternative ways of training is necessary to maintain rigorous standards of education and training.","Doulias, Triantafyllos; Gallo, Gaetano; Rubio-Perez, Ines; Breukink, Stephanie O; Hahnloser, Dieter",Journal of investigative surgery : the official journal of the Academy of Surgical Research,https://doi.org/10.1080/08941939.2020.1824250; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32959688/,11

Procalcitonin (PCT) levels have been shown to be significantly increased in COVID-19 patients in comparison with healthy subjects/asymptomatic coronavirus-positive patients. In this report, our aim was to assess the associations of the PCT level with DIC and the severity of COVID-19 infection. PATIENTS AND METHODS In this cross-sectional, retrospective study, 71 consecutive patients with severe COVID-19 (21 with DIC and 50 without DIC) were enrolled in the study. The PCT level was obtained from hospital records. RESULTS The PCT level was significantly higher in the patients with DIC than in those without DIC [1.9 (0.6-14.5) vs. 0.3 (0.2-0.4) (ng/mL), p<0.01]. The PCT level showed a positive and significant correlation with DIC (r=0.382, p=0.001) and was an independent predictor of DIC in patients with severe COVID-19 (OR: 6.685, CI: 1.857-24.063, p<0.01). CONCLUSIONS In summary, the PCT level was increased in severe COVID-19 patients with DIC compared with those without DIC. An increased PCT level might suggest the presence of DIC and may help in predicting COVID-19 severity.","Asoğlu, R; Tibilli, H; Afşin, A; Türkmen, S; Barman, H A; Asoğlu, E",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,https://doi.org/10.26355/eurrev_202011_23856; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33275269/,11
66114,The cellular interactome of the coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus nucleocapsid protein and functional implications for virus biology.,2013,"The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of rapid, cost effective, accurate, and non-invasive testing for viral infections. Volatile compounds (VCs) have been suggested for several decades as fulfilling these criteria. However currently very little work has been done in trying to diagnose viral infections using VCs. Much of the work carried out to date involves the differentiation of bacterial and viral sources of infection and often the detection of bacterial and viral co-infection. However, this has usually been done in vitro and very little work has involved the use of human participants. Viruses hijack the host cell metabolism and do not produce their own metabolites so identifying virus specific VCs is at best a challenging task. However, there are proteins and lipids that are potential candidates as markers of viral infection. The current understanding is that host cell glycolysis is upregulated under viral infection to increase the available energy for viral replication. There is some evidence that viral infection leads to the increase of production of fatty acids, alkanes, and alkanes related products. For instance, 2,3-butandione, aldehydes, 2,8-dimethyl-undecane and n-propyl acetate have all been correlated with viral infection. Currently, the literature points to markers of oxidative stress (e.g. nitric oxide, aldehydes etc) being the most useful in the determination of viral infection. The issue, however, is that there are also many other conditions that can lead to oxidative stress markers being produced. In this review a range of (mainly mass spectrometric) methods are discussed for viral detection in breath, including breath condensate. Currently MALDI-ToF-MS is likely to be the preferred method for the identification of viral strains and variants of those strains, however it is limited by its need for the viral strains to have been sequenced and logged in a database.","Gould, Oliver; Ratcliffe, Norman; Krol, Ewelina; de Lacy Costello, Ben P J",Journal of breath research,https://doi.org/10.1088/1752-7163/ab9c32; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32531777/,11

69523,Alphavirus RNA synthesis and non-structural protein functions.,2015,"Farm animals play an important role in translational research as large animal models of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. The mechanistic investigation of zoonotic diseases of the GI tract, in which animals can act as asymptomatic carriers, could provide important information for therapeutic approaches. In veterinary medicine, farm animals are no less relevant, as they can serve as models for the development of diagnostic and therapeutic approaches of GI diseases in the target species. However, farm animal-derived cell lines of the intestinal epithelium are rarely available from standardised cell banks and, in addition, are not usually specific for certain sections of the intestine. Immortalised porcine or bovine enterocytic cell lines are more widely available, compared to goat or sheep-derived cell lines; no continuous cell lines are available from the chicken. Other epithelial cell types with intestinal section-specific distribution and function, such as goblet cells, enteroendocrine cells, Paneth cells and intestinal stem cells, are not represented in those cell line-based models. Therefore, intestinal organoid models of farm animal species, which are already widely used for mice and humans, are gaining importance. Crypt-derived or pluripotent stem cell-derived intestinal organoid models offer the possibility to investigate the mechanisms of inter-cell or host-pathogen interactions and to answer species-specific questions. This review is intended to give an overview of cell culture models of the intestinal epithelium of farm animals, discussing species-specific differences, culture techniques and some possible applications for intestinal organoid models. It also highlights the need for species-specific pluripotent stem cell-derived or crypt-derived intestinal organoid models for promotion of the Three Rs principles (replacement, reduction and refinement).","Seeger, Bettina",Alternatives to laboratory animals : ATLA,https://doi.org/10.1177/0261192920974026; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33337913/,11

Despite intensive research, most of the existing diagnostic methods remain non-specific, labour-intensive, time-consuming or are not sensitive enough for rapid and timely diagnosis of the onset and progression of sepsis. The present work was undertaken to explore the potential of Raman spectroscopy to identify the biomarkers of sepsis in a label-free and minimally invasive manner using different mouse models of inflammation. The sera of BALB/c mice infected with Salmonella Typhimurium reveal extensive hemolysis, as indicated by the Raman bands that are characteristic of the porphyrin ring of hemoglobin (668, 743, 1050, 1253 and 1397 cm-1) which increase in a kinetic manner. These markers are also observed in a lipopolysaccharide-induced endotoxic shock model, but not in a thioglycollate-induced sterile peritonitis model. These data demonstrate that hemolysis is a signature of systemic, but not localised, inflammation. To further validate our observations, sepsis was induced in the nitric oxide synthase 2 (Nos2-/-) deficient strain which is more sensitive to infection. Interestingly, Nos2-/- mice exhibit a higher degree of hemolysis than C57BL/6 mice. Sepsis-induced hemolysis was also confirmed using resonance Raman spectroscopy with 442 nm excitation which demonstrated a pronounced increase in the resonant Raman bands at 670 and 1350 cm-1 in sera of the infected mice. This is the first study to identify inflammation-induced hemolysis in mouse models of sepsis using Raman spectral signatures for hemoglobin. The possible implications of this method in detecting hemolysis in different inflammatory pathologies, such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, are discussed.","Verma, Taru; Majumdar, Shamik; Yadav, Shikha; Ahmed, Syed Moiz; Umapathy, Siva; Nandi, Dipankar",The Analyst,https://doi.org/10.1039/d1an00066g; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34032232/,11

77095,A novel B-cell epitope of avian infectious bronchitis virus N protein.,2010,"Since DNA sequencing techniques first became available almost 30 years ago, the amount of nucleic acid sequence data has increased enormously. Phylogenetics, which is widely applied to compare and analyze such data, is particularly useful for the analysis of genes from rapidly evolving viruses. It has been used extensively to describe the molecular epidemiology and transmission of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the origins and subsequent evolution of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-associated coronavirus (SCoV), and, more recently, the evolving epidemiology of avian influenza as well as seasonal and pandemic human influenza viruses. Recent advances in phylogenetic methods can infer more in-depth information about the patterns of virus emergence, adding to the conventional approaches in viral epidemiology. Examples of this information include estimations (with confidence limits) of the actual time of the origin of a new viral strain or its emergence in a new species, viral recombination and reassortment events, the rate of population size change in a viral epidemic, and how the virus spreads and evolves within a specific population and geographical region. Such sequence-derived information obtained from the phylogenetic tree can assist in the design and implementation of public health and therapeutic interventions. However, application of many of these advanced phylogenetic methods are currently limited to specialized phylogeneticists and statisticians, mainly because of their mathematical basis and their dependence on the use of a large number of computer programs. This review attempts to bridge this gap by presenting conceptual, technical, and practical aspects of applying phylogenetic methods in studies of influenza, HIV, and SCoV. It aims to provide, with minimal mathematics and statistics, a practical overview of how phylogenetic methods can be incorporated into virological studies by clinical and laboratory specialists.","Lam, Tommy Tsan-Yuk; Hon, Chung-Chau; Tang, Julian W",Critical reviews in clinical laboratory sciences,https://doi.org/10.3109/10408361003633318; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20367503/,11

Previous studies have indicated that the intraoperative application of fibrin sealant may reduce the incidence of postoperative anastomotic leakage. This retrospective study was aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of fibrin sealant in the prevention of anastomotic leakage in patients undergoing McKeown esophagectomy. METHODS We designed a single-center, retrospective study. Between January 2018 and December 2019, 227 patients with esophageal or esophagogastric junction cancer undergoing McKeown esophagectomy performed by our team were retrospectively identified, of whom 86 patients were included in the FS group and 141 patients were included in the control group. Intraoperatively, 2.5 ml of porcine fibrin sealant was applied circumferentially to the cervical anastomosis after the anastomosis was created in the FS group. The primary outcome was the incidence of cervical anastomotic leakage within the first three months after surgery. RESULTS The differences in baseline clinical characteristics between the two groups were not significant except for a history of drinking. In the FS group, the postoperative cervical anastomotic leakage rate was lower (FS group: 4.7% [4 of 82] vs. control group: 19.9% [28 of 141], p < 0.01). Multivariate logistic regression showed that the intraoperative application of fibrin sealant was an independent protective factor for anastomotic leakage (OR 0.169, 95% CI 0.055-0.515, p = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS The intraoperative application of fibrin sealant could possibly prevent cervical anastomotic leakage after McKeown esophagectomy with satisfactory safety.

This retrospective analysis of the initial Canadian experience provides insight into technical challenges, clinical and radiographic outcomes, and complication rates after the use of flow-diverting stents for unruptured aneurysms. MATERIALS AND METHODS Cases were compiled from 7 Canadian centers between July 2008 and December 2010. Each center prospectively tracked their initial experience; these data were retrospectively updated and pooled for analysis. RESULTS During the defined study period, 97 cases of unruptured aneurysm were treated with the PED, with successful stent deployment in 94 cases. The overall complete or near-complete occlusion rate was 83%, with a median follow-up at 1.25 years (range 0.25-2.5 years). Progressive occlusion was witnessed over time, with complete or near-complete occlusion in 65% of aneurysms followed through 6 months, and 90% of aneurysms followed through 1 year. Multivariate analysis found previous aneurysm treatment and female sex predictive of persistent aneurysm filling. Most patients were stable or improved (88%), with the most favorable outcomes observed in patients with cavernous carotid aneurysms. The overall mortality rate was 6%. Postprocedural aneurysm hemorrhage occurred in 3 patients (3%), while ipsilateral distal territory hemorrhage was observed in 4 patients (3.4%). CONCLUSIONS Flow-diverting stents represent an important tool in the treatment of complex intracranial aneurysms. The relative efficacy and morbidity of this treatment must be considered in the context of available alternate interventions.","O'Kelly, C J; Spears, J; Chow, M; Wong, J; Boulton, M; Weill, A; Willinsky, R A; Kelly, M; Marotta, T R",AJNR.

This review evaluates the evidence that microbes are involved in the etiopathogenesis of the disease focusing on possibilities for antimicrobial intervention. RECENT FINDINGS The clinical presentation of hepatitis B virus (HBV)-associated polyarteritis nodosa (PAN) is different from that of non-HBV-PAN and requires antiviral treatment. In hepatitic C virus (HCV)-associated autoimmune diseases, type 2 cryoglobulinemia is present in 52% of cases. Chronic nasal carriage of Staphylococcus aureus is related to endonasal activity of Wegener's granulomatosis and recurrent relapses, and prophylactic treatment with co-trimoxazole is effective in reducing relapse rate. SUMMARY Patients with PAN should be tested for HBV, and patients with type 2 cryoglobulinemia for HCV. When tested positive, antiviral treatment should be considered. Patients with Wegener's granulomatosis should be tested for nasal carriage of S. aureus, and prophylactic treatment with co-trimoxazole should be considered in case of persistent endonasal activity of Wegener's granulomatosis together with S. aureus carriage. The efficacy of S. aureus elimination for preventing relapses of Wegener's granulomatosis should be evaluated.","Kallenberg, Cees G M",Current opinion in rheumatology,https://doi.org/10.1097/bor.0b013e328344f323; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21346576/,11

METHODS/DESIGN In this double-blind, randomized controlled trial, 200 very preterm infants with a gestational age < 32 weeks will be randomized to start resuscitation after birth with either 30% or 65% oxygen. The FiO₂ will be adjusted based on oxygen saturation measured by pulse oximetry (SpO₂) and pulse rate (which should be over 100 beats per minute) in order to achieve a target SpO₂ of 88-94% at 10 min of life. The FiO₂ and pulse oximetry data will be continuously recorded.The primary outcome is survival without bronchopulmonary dysplasia, as assessed by a physiological test at 36 weeks postmenstrual age. The secondary outcomes include the time to achieve SpO₂ > 88%, Apgar score at 5 min, cumulative O₂ exposure, oxidative stress (as determined by glutathione synthesis and oxidative stress markers), retinopathy of prematurity, brain injury and neurodevelopmental outcome at 2 years of age.This study will provide insight into determining the appropriate initial FiO₂ to start resuscitation of very preterm infants.

To respond effectively to this pandemic, it is mandatory to reaffirm science in its different fields of study, including the food safety area. Presently, we review food safety in times of COVID-19, exploring whether the virus can be transmitted by food or water; recommendations from regulatory agencies; perceptions of food hygiene practices during the pandemic; and post-pandemic perspectives. The review was based on papers published in Web of Science, Scopus, Pubmed, and covered recommendations of public health protection and regulatory agencies around the world. The transmission of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) by food was not confirmed until the present time. In any case, the protocols already established for food safety were reinforced, emphasizing the proper hygiene of hands after shopping, handling food packages, or before manipulating or eating food, adequate social distance, the use of individual protection equipment, the health of employees, and the proper preparation of food. It is hoped, in the post-pandemic scenario, to reach a better understanding of the particularities that led to greater care with food hygiene. Moreover, it is expected that the food system will creatively adapt the way meals are served.","Maragoni-Santos, Carollyne; Serrano Pinheiro de Souza, Thaiza; Matheus, Julia Rabelo Vaz; de Brito Nogueira, Talita Braga; Xavier-Santos, Douglas; Miyahira, Roberta Fontanive; Costa Antunes, Adriane Elisabete; Fai, Ana Elizabeth Cavalcante",Critical reviews in food science and nutrition,https://doi.org/10.1080/10408398.2021.1887078; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33591233/,11

METHODS This study included 153 consecutive patients with cT1 renal masses undergoing RAPN and analyzed their perioperative outcomes, particularly tumor complexity. In this series, cT1b, completely endophytic, hilar, and cystic tumors were considered complex tumors. Patients with tumors that met at least one of the complex criterion were placed in the complex tumor group; patients with tumors that did not meet any of the complex criteria were placed in the non-complex tumor group. RESULTS Of the 153 patients, 54 (35.3%) had complex tumors; specifically, 18 (11.8%) had cT1b tumors, 15 (9.8%) had completely endophytic tumors, 28 (18.3%) had hilar tumors, and 8 (5.2%) had cystic tumors. The non-complex group included 99 patients (64.7%). The complex tumor group had significantly longer warm ischemia and console times than the non-complex tumor group, but there was no significant difference between them in the achievement of the trifecta. Both warm ischemia and console times were significantly correlated with the number of complex factors. Multivariate analyses of complex factors demonstrated that completely endophytic and cT1b tumors were independently associated with warm ischemia time and console time, respectively. CONCLUSIONS For patients with complex tumors, RAPN may be a feasible procedure with acceptable perioperative outcomes. However, special attention should be paid to long warm ischemia and console times, particularly in those with completely endophytic and/or cT1b tumors.","Motoyama, Daisuke; Sato, Ryo; Watanabe, Kyohei; Matsushita, Yuto; Watanabe, Hiromitsu; Matsumoto, Rikiya; Ito, Toshiki; Sugiyama, Takayuki; Otsuka, Atsushi; Miyake, Hideaki",Asian journal of endoscopic surgery,https://doi.org/10.1111/ases.12872; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33006270/,11

OBJECTIVES We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the relationship between ACI and mortality risk in COVID-19 patients. METHODS Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines were followed in abstracting data and assessing validity. We searched MEDLINE, Scopus and Web of Science to locate all articles published up to 10 April 2020 reporting data of COVID-19 survivors and nonsurvivors developing ACI as a complication of the infection. Quality assessment was performed using the Newcastle-Ottawa quality assessment scale. Data were pooled using the Mantel-Haenszel random effects models with odds ratio as the effect measure with the related 95% confidence interval. Statistical heterogeneity between groups was measured using the Higgins I statistic. RESULTS Eight studies, enrolling 1686 patients (mean age 59.5 years), met the inclusion criteria and were included in the final analysis. Data regarding the outcome of patients complicated with ACI were available for 1615 patients. Of these, 387 (23.9%) experienced ACIs as COVID-19 complications during the hospitalization. The incidence of ACI was significantly higher among non survivors when compared with survivors (61.6 vs. 6.7%, P < 0.0001). The pooled analysis confirmed a significantly increased risk of death in COVID-19 patients complicated with ACI during the disease (odds ratio: 21.6, 95% confidence interval: 8.6-54.4, P < 0.0001, I = 82%). CONCLUSION Development of ACI during COVID-19 significantly increases the risk of death during the infection.","Zuin, Marco; Rigatelli, Gianluca; Zuliani, Giovanni; Bilato, Claudio; Zonzin, Pietro; Roncon, Loris",Journal of cardiovascular medicine,https://doi.org/10.2459/jcm.0000000000001064; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32740433/,11
92405,"Serotype and genotype diversity of infectious bronchitis viruses isolated during 1985-2008 in Guangxi, China.",2012,"Background A new coronavirus pneumonia caused by 2019 new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is spreading in China. Here we summarized the patients we accepted in the fever outpatient department. Methods Patients with epidemiologic history, respiratory symptoms or fever were required to go to the fever clinic for screening. Patients were finally laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using nasal and pharyngeal swabs. Epidemiologic features, clinical presentation, laboratory findings and image features were collected and analyzed. Results Totally, 16 patients were diagnosed as 2019-nCoV infection. The median age of the patients was 39.00 (35.25-55.75) years old, and the ratio of men and women was 9:7. Fifteen (93.75%) patients had clear epidemiologic history. The most common symptoms of the patients were fever (87.50%) and cough (n=8, 50.00%). The mean white blood cell count in the patients was (4.97±1.71) ×109/L, and it was lower than 4.00×109/L in 4 (25.00%) patients. The median neutrophil and lymphocyte count were 2.70 (1.84-3.27) ×109/L and (1.52±0.53) ×109/L respectively. The mean C-reactive protein level was 19.11±17.39 mg/L. Patients were likely had normal procalcitonin, creatinine, alanine aminotransferase, creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase levels at diagnosis. Fourteen (87.50%) patients had pneumonia in chest CT scan. Conclusions No specific symptom was helpful in the diagnosis of 2019-nCoV infection, but relatively low WBC and lymphocyte level might be suggestive to diagnosis. Most patients had fever and pneumonia, however, there were indeed some patients without fever and pneumonia. Screening procedure should not only focus on fever patients. The origin, transmission route, key targets of the virus and mechanism of infection deserved more studies.","Li, Yan; Xu, Shengyong; Du, Tiekuan; Xu, Jun; Li, Yi; Yu, Xuezhong; Zhu, Huadong",Journal of thoracic disease,https://doi.org/10.21037/jtd.2020.03.33; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32642164/,11

The purpose of this study was to assess and compare the prognostic role of tumor- TILs and its relationship with PD-L1 expression in stage II and III colon cancer. METHODS Immunohistochemisty was used to assess the densities of CD8+, CD4+, and FOXP3+ cells, and PD-L1 expression in intraepithelial tumor site from 58 stage II and III colon cancers. These were evaluated for association with histopathologic features and overall survival. RESULTS PD-L1-positive tumors contained a higher number of CD8+ TILs with statistical significance (p = 0.001). CD4+ TILs showed positive correlation with PD-L1 expression (p = 0.034). There were no associations between PD-L1 expression and FOXP3+ TILs. Microsatellite instability (MSI)-high status (p = 0.001; Odd ration 18.0; 95% CI = 4.3-74.8) was the strongest prognostic factor along with mucinous/poor cell differentiation, CD8 and right tumor location was associated with PD-L1 expression (p = 0.024, 0.035 and 0.033, respectively). CONCLUSION This study demonstrated that PD-L1 expression was associated with MSI-high, increased CD8+ TILs, mucinous and poor cell differentiation, and right-sided tumor location.","Jung, Dong Hae; Park, Hyun Jung; Jang, Ho Hee; Kim, Se-Hee; Jung, YunJae; Lee, Won-Suk",Cancer investigation,https://doi.org/10.1080/07357907.2020.1793349; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32762373/,11

MATERIAL AND METHODS The study involved 94 males which were divided into groups by age: 15-20, 21-30, 31-40, 41-50, 51-60 years old, each examined male had one 3.8 or 4.8 tooth removed (from the fracture line in the region angle of the mandible, according to orthodontic indications) for medical reasons. The shape, roughness, length and width of the enamel prisms were studied in the Image Analysis NT-VDT program according to the method of Omsk State Medical University. RESULTS The enamel prisms structure at all ages has a regular, ordered shape with 6-sided and 7-sided figures. The most constant structure occurs at the age group of 41-50, 51-60 years. The fastest enamel prisms growth occurs in the direction that increases the prism length at all ages. Growth on a plane which increases the prism width is slow at 41-50 years. It is catching up with the growth rate of enamel prisms in length at 51-60 years old. Enamel prisms at 15-20, 21-30 years old stretch faster in the horizontal direction. CONCLUSION In maturation process, due to correct and harmonious growth, enamel prisms are timely modified from pyramidal form in the early postpartum period to a prismatic form in the late postpartum period of ontogenesis.","Vagner, V D; Konev, V P; Korshunov, A S; Kuryatnikov, K N; Skurikhina, A P",Stomatologiia,https://doi.org/10.17116/stomat202110003119; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34180620/,11

In this study, we conducted a retrospective analysis of data from the Israeli Ministry of Health collected between 28 August 2020 and 24 February 2021. We studied the temporal dynamics of the number of new COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations after the vaccination campaign, which was initiated on 20 December 2020. To distinguish the possible effects of the vaccination on cases and hospitalizations from other factors, including a third lockdown implemented on 8 January 2021, we performed several comparisons: (1) individuals aged 60 years and older prioritized to receive the vaccine first versus younger age groups; (2) the January lockdown versus the September lockdown; and (3) early-vaccinated versus late-vaccinated cities. A larger and earlier decrease in COVID-19 cases and hospitalization was observed in individuals older than 60 years, followed by younger age groups, by the order of vaccination prioritization. This pattern was not observed in the previous lockdown and was more pronounced in early-vaccinated cities.

99218,Identification of the functional domain of the porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus receptor.,2015,"Excess concentrations of lead (Pb) were found in tap water from drinking water supply systems of high-rise buildings in 11 public rental housing (PRH) estates in Hong Kong, posing threats to public health. The copper supply lines are fitted with lead-soldered connections and brass fixtures and faucets. The causes of excess lead are studied through field sampling on occupied households, experiments on prototype supply chains, and 3D numerical modeling. The tap water lead concentration of 129 households in the PRH estates was sampled using a specially designed protocol, revealing the highly variable lead concentration variations induced by sources along the supply chain. Lead concentration variation at consumer tap and its relation with various lead sources are studied in a full-scale test rig. A 3D computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model is successfully developed to interpret the time variation of lead concentrations at the consumer tap. Model predictions of the complex variation of dissolved lead are in good agreement with data and confirm lead solder in copper pipe connections as a major cause of the ""lead water"" episode in Hong Kong. The CFD calculations demonstrate the importance of turbulent diffusion and shear flow dispersion in the modeling of lead; the use of a ""plug flow"" approximation can result in significant overestimation of lead concentration. The findings provide a basis for lead risk assessment of different water sampling strategies in densely populated high-rise buildings in Megacities.","Chan, Shu Ning; Chang, Lu; Choi, King Wah; Lee, Joseph H W; Fawell, John K; Kwok, Kelvin Y T",Environmental science & technology,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.0c03232; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33142055/,11

Tackling these issues, Collison, Vize, Miller, and Lynam developed the Five Factor Machiavellianism Inventory (FFMI), comprising antagonism, agency, and planfulness. We aimed to replicate the MACH-IV psychopathy relations, demonstrate the validity of the FFMI by assessing its relations with the NEO-PI-R and the HEXACO facets, and link the FFMI to a broad range of work-related criteria. We replicated the MACH-IV psychopathy relations and found a very high ([Formula: see text] = .91) absolute profile similarity between the FFMI's correlations with the NEO-PI-R in our sample (N = 572) and the correlation profile for the same variables reported by Collison and colleagues. Both the NEO-PI-R and HEXACO-PI-R profiles for the FFMI found in the current study supported its distinctiveness from traditional measures of Machiavellianism, which converged greatly with the correlation profiles for the FFMI-antagonism dimension.

Deep venous system involvement and septic dural sinus thrombosis have a higher mortality rate. In acute occlusion, collateral flow may not be established, which may result in significant edema and mass effect. Endovascular interventions may be considered as a treatment option in appropriate high-risk patients with DVST. MATERIALS AND METHODS Eight patients with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-confirmed dural sinus thrombosis, who did not respond to the conventional standard medical treatment, were subsequently treated with mechanical thrombectomy using the Penumbra System®. In all cases, medical treatment including anticoagulants were continued following the procedure for a minimum period of 1 year. RESULTS Recanalization of the dural sinus thrombosis was achieved in all 8 cases. There were no immediate or late endovascular-related complications. One death occurred due to an unrelated medical event. At 6 months, there was notable improvement in the modified Rankin Score (mRS), with 5/8 (62%) patients achieving mRS of 2 or less. The follow-up ranged between 3 months and 26 months (mean: 14.5 months), and there were no new neurological events during the follow-up period. CONCLUSION Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis is a rare but life-threatening condition that demands timely diagnosis and therapy. In cases of rapidly declining neurological status despite standard therapy with systemic anticoagulation and anti-edema measures, mechanical thrombectomy could be a lifesaving and effective option. In this study, good outcomes were observed in the majority of patients at long-term follow up.","Mammen, Suraj; Keshava, Shyamkumar Nidugala; Moses, Vinu; Aaron, Sanjith; Ahmed, Munawwar; Chiramel, George K; Mani, Sunithi E; Alexander, Mathew",The Indian journal of radiology & imaging,https://doi.org/10.4103/0971-3026.202956; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28515593/,11
102531,Genetic manipulation of porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus recovered from a full-length infectious cDNA clone.,2015,"Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is abnormal dilatation of the aorta, carrying a substantial risk of rupture and thereby marked risk of death. Open repair of AAA involves lengthy surgery time, anesthesia, and substantial recovery time. Endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) provides a safer option for patients with advanced age and pulmonary, cardiac, and renal dysfunction. Successful endovascular repair of AAA depends on correct selection of patients (on the basis of their vascular anatomy), choice of the correct endoprosthesis, and familiarity with the technique and procedure-specific complications. The type of aneurysm is defined by its location with respect to the renal arteries, whether it is a true or false aneurysm, and whether the common iliac arteries are involved. Vascular anatomy can be divided more technically into aortic neck, aortic aneurysm, pelvic perfusion, and iliac morphology, with grades of difficulty with respect to EVAR, aortic neck morphology being the most common factor to affect EVAR appropriateness. When choosing among the devices available on the market, one must consider the patient's vascular anatomy and choose between devices that provide suprarenal fixation versus those that provide infrarenal fixation. A successful technique can be divided into preprocedural imaging, ancillary procedures before AAA stent-graft placement, the procedure itself, postprocedural medical therapy, and postprocedural imaging surveillance. Imaging surveillance is important in assessing complications such as limb thrombosis, endoleaks, graft migration, enlargement of the aneurysm sac, and rupture. Last, one must consider the issue of radiation safety with regard to EVAR.","Bryce, Yolanda; Rogoff, Philip; Romanelli, Donald; Reichle, Ralph","Radiographics : a review publication of the Radiological Society of North America, Inc",https://doi.org/10.1148/rg.352140045; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25763741/,11

Little is known about the impact of these modern design features on resistance to air flow. METHODS We undertook a bench model test to measure pressure-flow characteristics and resistance of a range of tubes of similar outer diameter, including those enabling subglottic suction and speech. A constant inspiratory ± expiratory air flow was generated at increasing flows up to 150 L/min through each tube (with or without optional, mandatory, or interchangeable inner cannula). Driving pressures were measured, and resistance was calculated (cm H2O/L/s). RESULTS Pressures changed with increasing flow (P < .001) and tube type (P < .001), with differing patterns of pressure change according to the type of tube (P < .001) and direction of air flow. The single-lumen reference tube encountered the lowest inspiratory and expiratory pressures compared with all double-lumen tubes (P < .001); placement of an optional inner cannula increased bidirectional tube resistance by a factor of 3. For a tube with interchangeable inner cannulas, the type of cannula altered pressure and resistance differently (P < .001); the speech cannula in particular amplified pressure-flow changes and increased tube resistance by more than a factor of 4. CONCLUSIONS Tracheostomy tube type and inner cannula selection imposed differing pressures and resistance to air flow during inspiration and expiration. These differences may be important when selecting airway equipment or when setting parameters for monitoring, particularly for patients receiving supported ventilation or during the weaning process.","Pryor, Lee N; Baldwin, Claire E; Ward, Elizabeth C; Cornwell, Petrea L; O'Connor, Stephanie N; Chapman, Marianne J; Bersten, Andrew D",Respiratory care,https://doi.org/10.4187/respcare.04396; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26860399/,11

However, few published case reports exist describing the surgical treatment of ectopic kidneys with TCC. Surgical removal of a pelvic kidney can be complicated by aberrant vasculature supply, a tortuous ureter and abutting anatomical structures. Thus, it is necessary to determine the most appropriate surgical technique for treatment of pelvic kidneys with suspected malignancy. CASE PRESENTATION A 65-year-old female who presented with hematuria and lower abdominal pain was found to have a right pelvic kidney with a heterogeneous mass on computed tomography (CT) urogram. A robot-assisted laparoscopic nephroureterectomy of the right pelvic kidney was performed. Histopathological analysis revealed high-grade TCC with microscopic extension through the muscularis propria of the renal pelvis and superficially into the renal parenchyma. CONCLUSION This case demonstrates the successful use of robot-assisted laparoscopic nephroureterectomy in the treatment of a pelvic kidney with TCC. Preoperative CT angiography is critical to define vascular anatomy and to prevent significant blood loss and damage to surrounding structures during surgery. This case was presented because TCC of a pelvic kidney is a rare occurrence and the use of robot-assisted nephroureterectomy for treatment of this disease is novel.","Rezaee, Michael E; Shetty, Zubin; Pridmore, David; Dave, Chirag N; Shetty, Sugandh D",Journal of endourology case reports,https://doi.org/10.1089/cren.2016.0068; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27579441/,11

Unsupervised hierarchical cluster analysis based on 18 T cell subsets resulted in separation of healthy controls and COVID-19 patients. Compared to healthy controls, patients suffering from severe and critical COVID-19 had increased frequencies of activated and proliferating CD38+Ki67+ CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, suggesting active antiviral T cell defense. Frequencies of CD38+Ki67+ Th1 and CD4+ cells correlated negatively with plasma IL-6. Thus, our data suggest that patients suffering from COVID-19 have a distinct T cell composition that is potentially modulated by IL-6.","Rupp, Janine; Dreo, Barbara; Gütl, Katharina; Fessler, Johannes; Moser, Adrian; Haditsch, Bernd; Schilcher, Gernot; Matzkies, Lucie-Marie; Steinmetz, Ivo; Greinix, Hildegard; Stradner, Martin H",Journal of immunology,https://doi.org/10.4049/jimmunol.2001034; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33558375/,11
112474,Co-infections of chickens with Avian Influenza Virus H9N2 and Moroccan Italy 02 Infectious Bronchitis Virus: effect on pathogenesis and protection conferred by different vaccination programs.,2019,"BACKGROUND Antegrade colonic enema (ACE) via an appendicostomy is a recognised method of treatment for medically intractable fecal incontinence and/or constipation. In case of a missing appendix, ileal neoappendicostomy (INA) is considered a suitable alternative. The aim of this study was to review the postoperative complications, functional outcome, stoma-related complications and quality of life of patients treated with this method. METHODS A systematic literature search was performed in Embase, MEDLINE, PubMed (NCBI) and Cochrane Library from inception to September 2020 using the search terms ""antegrade enema"" OR ""continence enema"". Studies on children and adults with fecal incontinence, constipation or a combination of both, who underwent ileal neoappendicostomy for ACE due to the failure of medical treatment and/or anal irrigation were included in the studies, which reported one or more of the following primary outcomes: postoperative complications, functional results, and stoma-related complications. RESULTS A total of 780 studies were identified, 8 of which, comprising 6 studies in adults and 2 in children, were eligible for review. Overall, 139 patients were included. All studies were retrospective and the methods for reporting outcomes were highly heterogeneous. Improvements in incontinence and constipation were reported in all studies, together with an improved quality of life when reported (5 studies). Stomal stenosis and leakage rates were 0-29% and 14-60%, respectively. Postoperative complications were relatively common and included potentially life-threatening complications. CONCLUSIONS Taking into consideration that studies of INA were few and of poorly quality; ACE via an INA had a positive impact on bowel function and quality of life. Stoma-related complications and postoperative complications remain a concern.","Abildgaard, H A; Børgager, M; Ellebæk, M B; Qvist, N",Techniques in coloproctology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10151-021-02434-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33765228/,11

The potential impact of CME in increasing postoperative complications is still unclear. The aim of our study was to evaluate the safety and feasibility of laparoscopic CME compared with laparoscopic non-complete mesocolic excision (NCME) during colectomy for RCC. METHODS Data from a prospectively collected database of patients who underwent laparoscopic right and extended right colectomy at our institution between January 2008 and February 2020 were retrieved and analyzed. Short-term outcomes of patients undergoing CME and NCME were compared. A 1:1 propensity score matching (PSM) was used to balance baseline characteristics between groups. RESULTS A total of 663 consecutive patients underwent resection of RCC in the study period. Among these, 500 met the inclusion criteria and after PSM a total of 372 patients were correctly matched, 186 in each group. A similar rate of overall postoperative complications was found between the CME and NCME groups (21.5% and 18.3%, p = 0.436). No difference was found in terms of conversion rate, severe complications, reoperations, readmissions, and mortality. The median number of harvested lymph nodes was higher in the CME group (22 versus 19, p = 0.003), with a lower rate of inadequate sampling (7.0% and 15.1%, p = 0.013). CONCLUSION Laparoscopic CME for RCC is technically feasible and safe. It does not seem to be associated with a higher rate of complications or mortality compared with the ""traditional"" approach, but it allows better nodal sampling.","Magistro, Carmelo; Bertoglio, Camillo Leonardo; Giani, Alessandro; Mazzola, Michele; Rubicondo, Carolina; Maspero, Marianna; Carnevali, Pietro; Origi, Matteo; Ferrari, Giovanni",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-021-08601-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34129088/,11

Therefore, the pandemic might significantly change the behaviour of patients with CBDs and results in some challenges. In the present study, we assessed the main challenges of COVID-19 infection to patients with CBDs. Data were collected from medical files and interviews of patients with CBDs who had COVID-19 infection. Follow-ups were performed on patients who had active severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection between April and October 2020. All patients were interviewed by an expert in order to collect the pertinent data. Some questions were about patients' preventive behaviors and feelings prior to infection, and some were about the consequences of infection on patients' replacement therapy and bleeding management. Among 25 patients, infection and death of loved ones (n: 7, 28%), and their own (n: 5, 20%) or family members' (n: 1, 4%) infection, and the resulting economic burden (n: 2, 8%) were main concerns. Six patients experienced depression during the pandemic. The pandemic caused all severely affected patients but one (n: 11, 92%) to abandon replacement therapy. However, two received on-demand therapy after exacerbation of their bleeding. Only one (25%) of four patients on prophylaxis received in-home therapy, whereas the others (75%) abandoned prophylaxis. It seems that COVID-19 infection has great consequences on the lives of patients with CBDs, causing some to take dangerous actions, such as abandonment of their treatment. Healthcare systems, and healthcare providers, should have an appropriate strategy for management of patients with CBDs that prevents infection and provides timely replacement therapy.","Dorgalaleh, Akbar; Tabibian, Shadi; Baghaipour, Mohammad Reza; Dabbagh, Ali; Bahoush, Gholamreza; Jazebi, Mohammad; Bahraini, Mehran; Fazeli, Alieh; Yousefi, Forough",Blood coagulation & fibrinolysis : an international journal in haemostasis and thrombosis,https://doi.org/10.1097/mbc.0000000000001019; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33560003/,11
115966,Adaptive mutations in replicase transmembrane subunits can counteract inhibition of equine arteritis virus RNA synthesis by cyclophilin inhibitors.,2019,"PURPOSE Single-incision laparoscopy (SIL) is potentially less invasive compared with standard laparoscopic surgery (LAP); however, it may be more technically challenging and have a longer learning curve. A two-phase study was conducted to examine the performance of standardized tasks on a surgical simulator by novices during a distributed training period. Phase 1 examined the effect of LAP-specific or SIL-specific training on skill acquisition for both techniques. Phase 2 compared the effectiveness and learning curves of additional instrument types for SIL (straight [STR] vs. dynamic articulating [D-ART]). METHODS Medical students without previous surgical experience were randomized to LAP-specific training or SIL-specific training, using static articulating instruments [S-ART] for SIL. LAP and SIL scores on the peg transfer (PEG) and pattern cutting (CIRCLE) tasks from the Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery (FLS) were measured at baseline and after four training sessions. In phase 2, a new group of subjects were randomized to SIL training using STR or D-ART instruments, with similar baseline and post-training testing. FLS task scores were calculated and compared according to training regimen and instrument type. RESULTS Forty-five subjects completed the study. All scores improved significantly during the training period. Improvement in LAP score was similar between LAP-trained and SIL-trained groups. Improvement of SIL score was better for the SIL-trained group. Final scores were better and the learning curve was shorter for LAP versus SIL technique, with no differences in SIL scores according to instrument type. CONCLUSIONS LAP technique results in superior task performance with a shorter learning curve compared with SIL technique during a standardized training period. SIL-specific simulator training is better than LAP training alone to improve SIL performance. Neither S-ART nor D-ART instruments for SIL are associated with improved performance or shorter learning curve compared with STR instruments.","Santos, Byron F; Reif, Taylor J; Soper, Nathaniel J; Hungness, Eric S",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-011-1791-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21647813/,11

ROX is an index that can help in identification of patients with low and those with high risk of intubation. So, this study was planned to validate the diagnostic accuracy of the ROX index for prediction of COVID-19 pneumonia outcome (the need for intubation) and, in addition, to underline the significant association of the ROX index with clinical, radiological, demographic data. MATERIAL AND METHODS Sixty-nine RT-PCR positive COVID-19 patients were enrolled. The following data were collected: medical history, clinical classification of COVID-19 infection, the ROX index measured daily and the outcome assessment. RESULTS All patients with severe COVID-19 infection (100%) were intubated (50% of them on the 3rd day of admission), but only 38% of patients with moderate COVID-19 infection required intubation (all of them on the 3rd day of admission). The ROX index on the 1st day of admission was significantly associated with the presence of comorbidities, COVID-19 clinical classification, CT findings and intubation (p ≤ 0.001 for each of them). Regression analysis showed that sex and ROX.1 are the only significant independent predictors of intubation [AOR (95% CI): 16.9 (2.4- 117), 0.77 (0.69-0.86)], respectively. Cut-off point of the ROX index on the 1st day of admission was ≤ 25.26 (90.2% of sensitivity and 75% of specificity). CONCLUSIONS ROX is a simple noninvasive promising tool for predicting discontinuation of high-flow oxygen therapy and could be used in the assessment of progress and the risk of intubation in COVID-19 patients with pneumonia.","Suliman, Lucy Abdelmabood; Abdelgawad, Taha Taha; Farrag, Nesrine Saad; Abdelwahab, Heba Wagih",Advances in respiratory medicine,https://doi.org/10.5603/arm.a2020.0176; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33471350/,11

SARS-CoV-2 is highly infectious with a high basic reproduction number (R0 ) of 2.2-5.7 that has led to its exponential spread. Besides, very little is known about it in terms of immunogenicity and its molecular targets. SARS-CoV-2 causes acute respiratory distress syndrome, followed by multiple organ failure and death in a small percentage of individuals. Cardiac injury has emerged as another dreaded outcome of COVID-19 complications. However, a thorough understanding of the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 is lacking. In this review, we discuss the virus, possible mechanisms of COVID-19-induced cardiac injury, and potential therapeutic strategies, and we explore if exosomes could be targeted to treat symptoms of COVID-19.

Such a crisis calls for an urgent need to develop a risk stratification tool. The present chapter aimed to identify laboratory and clinical correlates of adverse outcomes in patients with COVID-19. To this end, we conducted a systematic evaluation of studies that investigated laboratory abnormalities in patients with COVID-19 and compared i. patients with a severe form of disease and patients with a non-severe form of the disease, ii. patients who were in critical condition and patients who were not in critical condition, and iii. patients who survived and patients who died. We included 54 studies in the data synthesis. Compared to patients with a non-severe form of COVID-19, patients who had a severe form of disease revealed higher values for white blood cells (WBC), polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN), total bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), creatinine, troponin, procalcitonin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and D-dimer. By contrast, platelet count, lymphocyte count, and albumin levels were decreased in patients with a severe form of COVID-19. Also, patients with a severe phenotype of disease were more likely to have diabetes, chronic heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cerebrovascular disease, hypertension, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and malignancy. Compared to patients who survived, patients who died had higher WBC, PMN, total bilirubin, ALT, procalcitonin, IL-6, creatinine, PT, lymphocyte count, platelet count, and albumin. Also, non-survivors revealed a higher prevalence of diabetes, chronic heart disease, COPD, cerebrovascular disease, and CKD. Meta-analyses identified several laboratory parameters that might help the prediction of severe, critical, and lethal phenotypes of COVID-19. These parameters correlate with the immune system function, inflammation, coagulation, and liver and kidney function.","Gholami, Bahareh; Gholami, Samira; Loghman, Amir Hossein; Khodaei, Behzad; Seyedpour, Simin; Seyedpour, Nasrin; Saghazadeh, Amene; Rezaei, Nima",Advances in experimental medicine and biology,https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-63761-3_22; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33973190/,11

The patient was referred to our institution from another hospital, where she had undergone a femoro-popliteal and crural bypass which was unsuccessful, requiring amputation of her leg. Following surgery, she was unable to breath spontaneously without any specific reason. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging showed no pathology and the neurologists did not have a diagnosis for her comatose state. There was consensus in both hospitals that surgical plication of her elevated diaphragm might be the only option for respiratory improvement. We performed a double-lined diaphragmatic plication procedure by means of uniportal video-assisted thoracic surgery technique with CO2 insufflation using GelPort. Despite the time-consuming adhesiolysis and the need for lung suturing at the end of the procedure, the operative time was 120 min. Oxygenation remarkably improved after the operation, yet the patient remained in comatose state.

122976,The role of ORF3 accessory protein in replication of cell-adapted porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV).,2017,"Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is the most frequently reported single cause of safety-related withdrawal of marketed drugs. It is essential to identify drugs with DILI potential at the early stages of drug development. In this study, we describe a deep learning-powered DILI (DeepDILI) prediction model created by combining model-level representation generated by conventional machine learning (ML) algorithms with a deep learning framework based on Mold2 descriptors. We conducted a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed DeepDILI model performance by posing several critical questions: (1) Could the DILI potential of newly approved drugs be predicted by accumulated knowledge of early approved ones? (2) is model-level representation more informative than molecule-based representation for DILI prediction? and (3) could improved model explainability be established? For question 1, we developed the DeepDILI model using drugs approved before 1997 to predict the DILI potential of those approved thereafter. As a result, the DeepDILI model outperformed the five conventional ML algorithms and two state-of-the-art ensemble methods with a Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) value of 0.331. For question 2, we demonstrated that the DeepDILI model's performance was significantly improved (i.e., a MCC improvement of 25.86% in test set) compared with deep neural networks based on molecule-based representation. For question 3, we found 21 chemical descriptors that were enriched, suggesting a strong association with DILI outcome. Furthermore, we found that the DeepDILI model has more discrimination power to identify the DILI potential of drugs belonging to the World Health Organization therapeutic category of 'alimentary tract and metabolism'. Moreover, the DeepDILI model based on Mold2 descriptors outperformed the ones with Mol2vec and MACCS descriptors. Finally, the DeepDILI model was applied to the recent real-world problem of predicting any DILI concern for potential COVID-19 treatments from repositioning drug candidates. Altogether, this developed DeepDILI model could serve as a promising tool for screening for DILI risk of compounds in the preclinical setting, and the DeepDILI model is publicly available through https://github.com/TingLi2016/DeepDILI.","Li, Ting; Tong, Weida; Roberts, Ruth; Liu, Zhichao; Thakkar, Shraddha",Chemical research in toxicology,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.chemrestox.0c00374; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33356151/,11

However, the fragmentation regioselectivity cannot be switched and fragmentation at the less-substituted terminus is so far not possible. We report here that the reaction of ketone enolates with commercial alkyl nitrites provides a direct and regioselective way of fragmenting ketones into esters and oximes or ω-hydroxyimino esters, respectively. A comprehensive study of the scope of this reaction with respect to ketone classes and alkyl nitrites is presented. Control over the site of cleavage is gained through regioselective enolate formation by various bases. Oxidation of kinetic enolates of unsymmetrical ketones leads to the otherwise unavailable ""anti-Beckmann"" cleavage at the less-substituted side chain, while cleavage of thermodynamic enolates of the same ketones represents an alternative to the Baeyer-Villiger oxidation or the Beckmann rearrangement under basic conditions.

125575,Type III Interferon Restriction by Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus and the Role of Viral Protein nsp1 in IRF1 Signaling.,2018,"Cleavage activation of the hemagglutinin (HA) precursor is an essential step in the influenza virus replication cycle that is driven by host cell proteases. HA cleavage activation is required for virus-endosome membrane fusion and the subsequent release of the influenza virus genome into the cytoplasm. Previous studies have determined that HA cleavage is most likely driven by either membrane-bound or extracellular trypsin-like proteases that reside in the respiratory tract. However, there is still uncertainty regarding which proteases are critical for HA cleavage in vivo. Therefore, further investigation of HA cleavage activation is needed in order to gain insight into the critical proteases involved. Matriptase is a member of the type II transmembrane serine protease family that is highly expressed in a membrane-bound form throughout the respiratory tract. One feature of matriptase is that, once activated, the catalytic domain is secreted into the extracellular space and so serves as a functional extracellular protease. In this study, we have determined that the secreted, catalytic domain of matriptase has the ability to cleave and activate HA from the influenza virus H1 subtype but not the H2 and H3 subtypes. Furthermore, matriptase selectively cleaved the HA of particular strains within the H1 subtype, revealing both subtype and H1 strain specificity. Matriptase was also found to activate thrombolytic zymogens that have been shown to cleave and activate the influenza virus HA. Our data demonstrate that matriptase has the ability to cleave HA directly or indirectly by activating HA-cleaving zymogens.","Hamilton, Brian S; Gludish, David W J; Whittaker, Gary R",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00306-12; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22811538/,11

The lungs are highly susceptible to ROS-mediated damage. Oxidative stress (OS) caused by this redox imbalance leads to the pathogenesis of multiple pulmonary diseases such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). OS causes damage to important cellular components in terms of lipid peroxidation, protein oxidation, and DNA histone modification. Inflammation further enhances ROS production inducing changes in transcriptional factors which mediate cellular stress response pathways. This deviation from normal cell function contributes to the detrimental pathological characteristics often seen in pulmonary diseases. Although antioxidant therapies are feasible approaches in alleviating OS-related lung impairment, a comprehensive understanding of the updated role of ROS in pulmonary inflammation is vital for the development of optimal treatments. In this chapter, we review the major pulmonary diseases-including COPD, asthma, ARDS, COVID-19, and lung cancer-as well as their association with ROS.","Zuo, Li; Wijegunawardana, Denethi",Advances in experimental medicine and biology,https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-68748-9_11; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34019270/,11

The greater omentum is placed on the cranial side of the transverse colon through the defect between the elevated jejunum and the transverse mesocolon. Anastomosis is performed of the transverse mesocolon attached to the transverse colon, the greater omentum is passed through the Petersen's defect, and the stump of the mesojejunum is attached to the elevated jejunum by an interrupted suture. Petersen's defect is spread and straightened to stabilize the visual field. The thread is inserted first at the base of the stump of the elevated mesojejunum, next to the greater omentum, which has passed through Petersen's defect, and then to the transverse mesocolon to set the starting point of continuous suture. The stitches of continuous suture are sewn toward the transverse colon. Petersen's defect is closed completely. RESULTS We performed this technique in 37 patients. All procedures were completed without intraoperative complication or conversion to laparotomy. During the follow-up period, none of the patients developed complications related to the internal hernia, such as Petersen's hernia. CONCLUSIONS We have indicated a novel, easy, and secure closure procedure of Petersen's defect following laparoscopic distal gastrectomy with Roux-en-Y reconstruction.","Hirahara, Noriyuki; Matsubara, Takeshi; Hayashi, Hikota; Takai, Kiyoe; Fujii, Yusuke; Tajima, Yoshitsugu",Journal of laparoendoscopic & advanced surgical techniques.

OBJECTIVES To synthesize current evidence for walking soccer, and provide a summary of global walking soccer organizations. DATA SOURCES We searched for studies published across all years and all languages within multiple databases for studies focused on walking soccer (football) in adults (18+ years). Two authors independently screened citations at Level 1 and 2. We also conducted a forward citation search and reviewed the reference lists for included studies. We searched the grey literature to identify walking soccer organizations. We conducted the last database search in December 2019. STUDY APPRAISAL AND SYNTHESIS METHODS We conducted a standard systematic review following established guidelines. We also summarized findings from a limited search for walking soccer organizations. For peer-reviewed literature, we used the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool (MMAT) to assess methodological quality, and conducted a narrative synthesis of the evidence. RESULTS We identified nine peer-reviewed studies (with 117 participants). Most studies included small sample sizes and interventions with short duration. Walking soccer is an emerging modified sport that is popular across the United Kingdom (UK), with its reach extending to other countries. CONCLUSIONS Limited published evidence exists for walking soccer, despite is global popularity. For the studies identified, generalizability was limited to predominately older men from the UK. Based on preliminary findings, walking soccer has the potential to confer health benefits and build social connections.","Corepal, Rekesh; Zhang, Jia Yu; Grover, Sanya; Hubball, Harry; Ashe, Maureen C",Scandinavian journal of medicine & science in sports,https://doi.org/10.1111/sms.13772; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32671884/,11

We evaluated bevacizumab with a widely used carboplatin-paclitaxel backbone. METHODS Patients with metastatic/recurrent/persistent cervical cancer not amenable to curative surgery and/or radiotherapy received 3-weekly bevacizumab 15 mg/kg, paclitaxel 175 mg/m2, and carboplatin AUC 5 until progression or unacceptable toxicity. Maintenance bevacizumab was allowed. Patients with ongoing bladder/rectal involvement, prior cobalt radiotherapy, a history of fistula/gastrointestinal perforation, or recent bowel resection/chemoradiation were excluded. The primary objective was to determine incidences of gastrointestinal perforation/fistula, gastrointestinal-vaginal fistula, and genitourinary fistula. RESULTS Among 150 treated patients, disease at study entry was persistent in 21%, recurrent in 56%, and newly diagnosed metastatic in 23%. After 27.8 months' median follow-up, median bevacizumab duration was 6.7 months; 57% received maintenance bevacizumab. Seventeen patients (11.3%; 95% CI: 6.7-17.5%) experienced ≥1 perforation/fistula event: gastrointestinal perforation/fistula in 4.7% (1.9-9.4%), gastrointestinal-vaginal fistula in 4.0% (1.5-8.5%), and genitourinary fistula in 4.7% (1.9-9.4%). Of these, 16 were previously irradiated, several with ongoing radiation effects. The most common grade 3/4 adverse events were neutropenia (25%), anemia (19%), and hypertension (14%). Five patients (3%) had fatal adverse events. Objective response rate was 61% (95% CI: 52-69%), median progression-free survival was 10.9 (10.1-13.7) months, and median overall survival was 25.0 (20.9-30.4) months. CONCLUSIONS Bevacizumab can be combined with carboplatin-paclitaxel in the CECILIA study population.

The aim of our study was to compare outcomes for single-incision laparoscopic colectomy with laparoscopic-assisted colectomy. METHODS Patients undergoing laparoscopic colectomy were prospectively entered into an institutional review board-approved database. Those that underwent single-incision laparoscopic colectomy were case matched for sex, age, disease, surgery, body mass index, previous surgeries, and surgeon with patients undergoing LAC. RESULTS Twenty-nine single-incision laparoscopic segmental colectomies were performed for polyps (4), adenocarcinoma (12), diverticulitis (6), and Crohn's disease (7) and were case matched to laparoscopic-assisted colectomy for the same indications. Mean body mass index was 28.8 ± 3 kg/m². Operative time was longer for single-incision laparoscopic colectomy (134.4 ± 40 vs 103.8 ± 54 min; P = .0002). Four single-incision laparoscopic colectomies were converted to LAC requiring either one extra port (2) or 2 extra ports (2), and there was one conversion to laparotomy. Extraction scar length (millimeters) was similar (38 ± 6.0 vs 45 ± 6.2; P = .746). Postoperative morbidity (5/29 vs 7/29; P = .284) and length of stay (day) (3.7 ± 1.1 vs 3.9 ± 1.1; P = .445) were similar between groups. CONCLUSIONS Single-incision laparoscopic colectomy is feasible and safe but takes more time than laparoscopic-assisted colectomy. Although results approximate those for laparoscopic-assisted colectomy, an additional learning curve is involved, and extra incisions are sometimes required. Single-incision laparoscopic colectomy requires further prospective validation so that the cost of the device can be justified by an improved clinical outcome.","Champagne, B J; Lee, E C; Leblanc, F; Stein, S L; Delaney, C P",Diseases of the colon and rectum,https://doi.org/10.1007/dcr.0b013e3181fd48af; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21228666/,11

One option for mitigating an FFR shortage is to decontaminate and reuse the devices. The focus of this study was to develop a new evaluation technique based on three major decontamination requirements: 1) inactivating viruses, 2) not altering the respirator properties, and 3) not leaving any toxic byproduct on the FFR. METHODS Hydrophilic and hydrophobic FFRs were contaminated with MS2 virus. In the solution-based deposition, the virus-containing liquid droplets were spiked directly onto FFRs, while in the vapor-based and aerosol-based depositions, the viral particles were loaded onto FFRs using a bio-aerosol testing system. Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) and moist heat (MH) decontamination methods were used for inactivation of viruses applied to FFRs. RESULTS Both UVGI and MH methods inactivated viruses (> 5-log reduction of MS2 virus; in 92% of both method experiments, the virus was reduced to levels below the detection limit), did not alter the respirator properties, and did not leave any toxic byproduct on the FFRs. CONCLUSIONS Both UVGI and MH methods could be considered as promising decontamination candidates for inactivation of viruses for respirator reuse during shortages.","Vo, Evanly; Appavoo, Samy Rengasamy; Xu, Susan; Horvatin, Matthew; Zhuang, Ziqing",American journal of infection control,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajic.2021.01.017; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33524450/,11

In Brazil, however, this is not the case for most medical schools, considering Brazilian social inequality and uneven access to technology. Recently, the Covid-19 pandemic has also challenged Universities to seek and make a transition towards more effective methods of full-time online education. Thus, the main goal of this work was to verify student's perception and academic performance, assessed upon VM implementation in a Brazilian Medical School. Ribeirao Preto Medical School students answered a twenty-six-question survey with regards to optical microscopy (OM) and VM. Academic performance was compared between participants that were (year of 2019) or were not (year of 2015) exposed to VM. Taken the results together, subjective impressions such as handling, suitability, learning effectiveness and pleasure using the tools, have shown a higher score for virtual microscopy (median = 29), when compared to optical microscopy (median = 24) with a P-value < 0.001 by Wilcoxon rank test, upon measurement using an ordinal scale. Regarding academic performance, no statistically significant differences were found between groups (P-value = 0.38, Cohen's d = 0.19).

Diverse ethnic, racial, and linguistic students face significant challenges and are placed at considerable risk by long-observed structural inequities evidenced in society and schools. Teachers must develop the capacity to be culturally sensitive, provide culturally responsive pedagogy, and regularly self-assess for biases implicated in positive academic outcomes for students in kindergarten through Grade 12.

AIMS We aimed to describe quality of working life (QWL) in IBD patients and to assess variables that are associated with QWL. METHODS Employed IBD patients of two tertiary and two secondary referral hospitals were included. QWL (range 0-100) was measured using the Quality of Working Life Questionnaire (QWLQ). Work productivity (WP), fatigue, and health-related quality of life (HRQL) were assessed using the Work Productivity and Activity Impairment questionnaire, Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory, and Short Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire, respectively. Active disease was defined as a score > 4 for the patient-reported Harvey-Bradshaw index in Crohn's disease (CD) or Simple Clinical Colitis Activity Index in ulcerative colitis patients. RESULTS In total, 510 IBD patients were included (59% female, 53% CD, mean age 43 (SD 12) years). The mean QWLQ score was 78 (SD 11). The lowest subscore (54 (SD 26)) was observed for ""problems due to the health situation"": 63% reported fatigue-related problems at work, 48% agreed being hampered at work, 46% had limited confidence in their body, and 48% felt insecure about the future due to their health situation. Intermediate/strong associations were found between QWL and fatigue (r = - 0.543, p < 0.001), HRQL (r = 0.527, p < 0.001), WP loss (r = - 0.453, p < 0.001) and disease activity (r = - 0.331, p < 0.001). Independent predictors of impaired QWL in hierarchical regression analyses were fatigue (B = - 0.204, p < 0.001), WP loss (B = - 0.070, p < 0.001), and impaired HRQL (B = 0.248, p = 0.001).

We explored the experiences of family members of patients with severe acute brain injury focusing on the impact of family presence in the hospital. Methods: Semistructured interviews (February 2018-April 2020) were audiotaped, transcribed, and analyzed using thematic analysis. Results: We interviewed family members of 19 patients with stroke, traumatic brain injury, or cardiac arrest; five interviews occurred after initiation of restrictive visitation policies. Four key themes highlight the role of visitation on family's ability to (1) cope by being at the bedside, (2) protect and advocate for the patient, (3) build trust with clinicians, and (4) receive emotional support in the intensive care unit. After visitation restrictions, families found ways to communicate and support virtually and wished for proactive communication from clinicians. Conclusions: Family presence at patient's bedside fulfills important needs. Visitation restrictions require hospitals to be creative and inclusive to help maintain these connections.","Creutzfeldt, Claire J; Schutz, Rachael E C; Zahuranec, Darin B; Lutz, Barbara J; Curtis, J Randall; Engelberg, Ruth A",Journal of palliative medicine,https://doi.org/10.1089/jpm.2020.0520; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33210984/,11

After 30 months, the BCVA had not changed, but the FAF showed a spark-like hypoautofluorescence in the macula. The abnormal area of the EZ had expanded toward the periphery, and the rate of EZ loss was 199.7%/year OD and 206.8%/year OS. Genetic examinations revealed an increase in the number of heterozygous CAG repeats in the ATXN1 gene, and the CAG repeat number of the mutant allele ranged from 43 to 48. CONCLUSIONS The full-field scotopic and photopic ERGs were normal. The mfERGs were significantly smaller in the central region. OCT demonstrated bilateral photoreceptor atrophy in the macula, and the rate of EZ loss was more rapid than in other macular dystrophies. Spark-like hypoautofluorescence appeared during the course of the disease process which might be a specific feature of SCA1-related retinopathy.","Hirose, Ayane; Katagiri, Satoshi; Hayashi, Takaaki; Matsuura, Tomokazu; Nagai, Norihiro; Fujinami, Kaoru; Iwata, Takeshi; Tsunoda, Kazushige",Documenta ophthalmologica.

In due time, when analyzing the desorption of hydrogen molecules from crystalline adsorbents, attempts were made to associate this behavior with the manifestation of second-order effects, when the rate of desorption is limited by the rate of surface diffusion of hydrogen atoms with their subsequent association into molecules. However, the estimates made in the present work show that the dominance of second-order effects should be expected in the region of times significantly exceeding those where the kinetics of H2 desorption have long acquired a non-Debye character. To explain the observed regularities, an approach has been developed according to which frozen fluctuations in the activation energy of desorption play a crucial role in the non-Debye kinetics of the process. The obtained closed expression for the desorption rate has a transparent physical meaning and allows us to give a quantitative interpretation of a number of experiments on the desorption kinetics of molecules not only from crystalline (containing frozen defects) but also from amorphous adsorbents. The ways of further development of the proposed theory and its experimental verification are outlined.","Bondarev, Victor N; Kutarov, Volodymyr V; Schieferstein, Eva; Zavalniuk, Vladimir V",Molecules,https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules25163662; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32796720/,11

In contrast to monomeric picornavirus 3C peptidases, SARS-CoV 3CLpro exists in equilibrium between the monomer and dimer forms in solution, and only the dimer is proteolytically active in dilute buffer solutions. In this study, the increase of SARS-CoV 3CLpro peptidase activity in presence of kosmotropic salts and crowding agents is described. The activation followed the Hofmeister series of anions, with two orders of magnitude enhancement in the presence of Na₂SO₄, whereas the crowding agents polyethylene glycol and bovine serum albumin increased the hydrolytic rate up to 3 times. Kinetic determinations of the monomer dimer dissociation constant (K(d)) indicated that activation was a result of a more active dimer, without significant changes in K(d) values. The activation was found to be independent of substrate length and was derived from both k(cat) increase and K(m) decrease. The viral peptidase activation described here could be related to the crowded intracellular environment and indicates a further fine-tuning mechanism for biological control, particularly in the microenvironment of the vesicles that are induced in host cells during positive strand RNA virus infection.","Okamoto, Debora N; Oliveira, Lilian C G; Kondo, Marcia Y; Cezari, Maria H S; Szeltner, Zoltán; Juhász, Tünde; Juliano, Maria A; Polgár, László; Juliano, Luiz; Gouvea, Iuri E",Biological chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1515/bc.2010.145; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21087086/,11

Considering that the global burden of poor mental health continues to rise, such interventions could be a cost-effective means to improve mental health, as well as reconnect individuals with the natural world, and thus aid efforts. However, the effectiveness of NBIs as a prescriptive intervention is, in part, a function of access to blue and green spaces. Accordingly, this scoping review will explore how structural inequalities influence the effectiveness of nature-based interventions as treatment options for mental and physical ill health. Methods A scoping review will be conducted to identify the barriers and facilitators associated with the utilisation of green and blue spaces. The review will follow the PRISMA-ScR guidelines, in addition to the associated Cochrane guidelines for scoping reviews. A literature search will be performed across five databases, and articles will be selected based on key inclusion/ exclusion criteria. All data will be extracted to a pre-defined charting table. The primary and secondary outcomes will be mental and physical health respectively. Discussion This review will better inform relevant stakeholders of the potential enablers and barriers of nature-based interventions, and thereby improve provision and implementation of NBIs as public health initiatives.","Nejade, R.

We describe children seeking SARS-CoV-2 testing at a community site and compare antigen test performance to real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and viral culture. Methods: Two anterior nasal specimens were self-collected for BinaxNOW antigen and RT-PCR testing, along with demographics, symptoms, and exposure information from individuals [≥]5 years at a community testing site. Viral culture was attempted on residual antigen or RT-PCR positive specimens. Demographic and clinical characteristics, and the performance of SARS-CoV-2 antigen tests, were compared among children (<18 years) and adults. Results: About one in ten included specimens were from children (225/2110); 16.4% (37/225) were RT-PCR positive. Cycle threshold values were similar among RT-PCR positive specimens from children and adults (22.5 vs 21.3, p=0.46) and among specimens from symptomatic and asymptomatic children (22.5 vs 23.2, p=0.39). Sensitivity of antigen test compared to RT-PCR was 73.0% (27/37) among specimens from children and 80.8% (240/297) among specimens from adults; among specimens from children, specificity was 100% (188/188), positive and negative predictive value were 100% (27/27) and 94.9% (188/198) respectively. Virus was isolated from 51.4% (19/37) of RT-PCR positive pediatric specimens; all 19 had positive antigen test results. Conclusions : With lower sensitivity relative to RT-PCR, antigen tests may not diagnose all positive COVID-19 cases; however, antigen testing identified children with live SARS-CoV-2 virus.","Ford, L.; Whaley, M.

183932,cis-acting RNA signals in the NS5B C-terminal coding sequence of the hepatitis C virus genome.,2004,"Malformations of or injuries to the developing lung are associated with perinatal morbidity and mortality with lifelong consequences for subsequent pulmonary health. One fetal exposure linked with poor health outcomes is chorioamnionitis, which impacts up to 25-40% of preterm births. Severe chorioamnionitis with prematurity is associated with significantly increased risk of pulmonary disease and secondary infections in childhood, suggesting that fetal inflammation may significantly alter developmental ontogeny of the lung. To test this hypothesis, we used intra-amniotic lipopolysaccharide (LPS, endotoxin) to generate experimental chorioamnionitis in prenatal Rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta), a model which shares critical structural and temporal aspects of human lung development. Inflammatory injury directly disrupts the developing gas exchange surface of the primate lung, with extensive damage to alveolar structure, particularly the close association and coordinated differentiation of alveolar type 1 pneumocytes and specialized alveolar capillary endothelium. Single cell RNA sequencing analysis defined a multicellular alveolar signaling niche driving alveologenesis which was extensively disrupted by perinatal inflammation, leading to loss of gas exchange surface and alveolar simplification similar to that found in chronic lung disease of newborns. Blockade of IL1β and TNFα ameliorated endotoxin-induced inflammatory lung injury by blunting stromal response to inflammation and modulating innate immune activation in myeloid cells, restoring structural integrity and key signaling networks in the developing alveolus. These data provide new insight into the pathophysiology of developmental lung injury and suggest that modulating inflammation is a promising therapeutic approach to prevent fetal consequences of chorioamnionitis.","Toth, Andrea; Steinmeyer, Shelby; Kannan, Paranthaman; Gray, Jerilyn; Jackson, Courtney M.; Mukherjee, Shibabrata; Demmert, Martin; Sheak, Joshua R.; Benson, Daniel; Kitzmiller, Joe; Wayman, Joseph A.; Presicce, Pietro; Cates, Christopher; Rubin, Rhea; Chetal, Kashish; Du, Yina; Miao, Yifei; Gu, Mingxia; Guo, Minzhe; Kalinichenko, Vladimir V.; Kallapur, Suhas G.; Miraldi, Emily R.; Xu, Yan; Swarr, Daniel; Lewkowich, Ian; Salomonis, Nathan; Miller, Lisa; Sucre, Jennifer S.; Whitsett, Jeffrey A.; Chougnet, Claire A.; Jobe, Alan H.; Deshmukh, Hitesh; Zacharias, William J.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.06.24.449766,11

Furthermore, mild to moderate infections are an important contributor to ongoing transmission. There remains a critical need to identify host immune biomarkers predictive of clinical and virologic outcomes in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients. Leveraging longitudinal samples and data from a clinical trial of Peginterferon Lambda for treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infected outpatients, we used host proteomics and transcriptomics to characterize the trajectory of the immune response in COVID-19 patients within the first 2 weeks of symptom onset. We define early immune signatures, including plasma levels of RIG-I and the CCR2 ligands (MCP1, MCP2 and MCP3), associated with control of oropharyngeal viral load, the degree of symptom severity, and immune memory (including SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell responses and spike (S) protein-binding IgG levels). We found that individuals receiving BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) vaccine had similar early immune trajectories to those observed in this natural infection cohort, including the induction of both inflammatory cytokines (e.g. MCP1) and negative immune regulators (e.g. TWEAK). Finally, we demonstrate that machine learning models using 8-10 plasma protein markers measured early within the course of infection are able to accurately predict symptom severity, T cell memory, and the antibody response post-infection.","Hu, Z.; van der Ploeg, K.; Chakraborty, S.; S Arunachalam, P.; Mori, D.

Design. Nationwide cross-sectional study. Setting. Japanese general adult population. Participants. 1,757 adult residents. Primary outcome measures. Fourteen preventive care measures aggregated the overall, screening, immunization, and counseling composites. Results. Depression screening, zoster vaccination, and tetanus vaccination had low implementation rates even among participants with a usual source of primary care. After adjustment for possible confounders, having a usual source of primary care was positively associated with all preventive care composites. Primary care performance assessed by the Japanese version of Primary Care Assessment Tool Short Form was also dose-dependently associated with an increase in all composites. Results of the sensitivity analyses using a different calculation of preventive care composite were similar to those of the primary analyses. Conclusions. Receipt of primary care, particularly high-quality primary care, contributed to increased preventive care utilization even during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the rate of mental health screening in primary care was at a very low level. Therefore, addressing mental health issues should be a major challenge for primary care providers during and after the pandemic.","Aoki, T.; Fujinuma, Y.; Matsushima, M.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.09.26.21263606v1?rss=1,11

Then, we use estimated series of time-varying coefficients obtained from the previous step as proxy variables for the government response’s effect and run stepwise regressions with policy indicators of OxCGRT to identify which specific policy can mitigate the spreading of the COVID-19 epidemic in Japan. The main finding is that the response of Japanese government on COVID-19 epidemic is basically effective. However, the effect of Japanese government’ policy is gradually weakening. Under our identification scheme, we find that policies of quarantine and movement restrictions are still most effective, but policies of public health system do not show much effectiveness in the regression analysis. Another important empirical finding is that policies of economic support are effective in reducing the spread of COVID-19. Within the framework of empirical strategy proposed in this paper, the conclusion should be explained in the context of the socio-political and health situation in Japan, but the methodology is assumed to be applicable to other countries and regions in the analysis of government performance of response to COVID-19.","Wang, Rui",COVID,https://doi.org/10.3390/covid1010022,11

Although the route of infection for COVID-19 by water or aquatic organisms has not yet been observed in the wild, the relevance of its study is highlighted because there are cases of other viral infections known to have been transferred to humans by aquatic biota. It is encouraging to know that aquatic species, such as fish, marine mammals, and amphibians, show very few coronavirus cases. Some other aquatic animals may also be a possible source of cure or treatment against, as some evidence with algae and aquatic invertebrates suggest.","Núñez-Nogueira, Gabriel Valentino-Álvarez Jesús Alberto Granados-Berber Andrés Arturo Ramírez-Ayala Eduardo Zepeda-González Francisco Alberto Tintos-Gómez Adrián",Water,https://doi.org/10.3390/w13162215,11
184523,Intracellular retention of hepatitis B virus surface protein mutants devoid of amino-terminal pre-S1 sequences.,1994,"In the South Kivu province of the DR Congo, marshes are considered as favorable lands for various crop productions, and these improve food security and livelihood of thousands of households. We analyzed survey data collected from 148 farmers using a binary logit model and descriptive statistics in order to identify the potential threats to agricultural production, and the coping strategies used by farmers in marshlands. Results showed that 65% of respondents were female, and 76% of all farmers claimed perceiving threats to agricultural production in marshes. The perceived potential threats to agriculture included floods, pest infestation (millipede, fall armyworm), crop theft, and unsecure land-holding status as well as the decrease in soil fertility. Moreover, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has also led to the increase in prices of agricultural inputs (pesticides, seeds), and manure that has become increasingly rare and expensive due to the drastic reduction in livestock in that region weakened by several years of civil war and insecurity. In response, farmers were combining several adaptation strategies and these included drainage, mulching, manure application, and crop diversification used by farmers for, respectively, managing floods, maintaining soil fertility, and reducing crop failure. To cope with land scarcity, both female (75%) and male farmers (60%) claimed seeking for lands in highlands and renting extra plots in the same marshes or elsewhere. Despite the strategies implemented, there is still a need to strengthen farmers’ knowledge of flood and pesticide management and promote the integrated pest management practices for a sustainable use of marshlands. © 2021 The Author(s).

Quinacrine (QC) increases the antimicrobial activity against yeast exponentially with a pH-dependent increase in the cationic amphiphilic drug (CAD) structure. CAD-QC localizes in membranes and induces glucose starvation by noncompetitively inhibiting glucose uptake. A logarithmic increase in antimicrobial activity with pH-dependent CAD formation was also observed for chloroquine, indicating that the CAD structure is crucial for its pharmacological activity. A decrease in CAD structure with a slight decrease in pH from 7.4 greatly reduced their effects; namely, these drugs would inefficiently act on falciparum malaria and COVID-19 pneumonia patients with acidosis, resulting in resistance. Recovering normal blood pH or using pH-insensitive quinoline drugs might be effective.","Kitagawa, Tomohisa; Mastumoto, Atsushi; Terashima, Ichiro; Uesono, Yukifumi",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.04.237255,11
184848,Localization of the RNA-binding domain of mouse hepatitis virus nucleocapsid protein.,1993,"As many universities transitioned to online learning during the COVID-19 pandemic, the distance learning environment presented various accessibility challenges for deaf and hard-of-hearing students (DHH). In art and design higher education programs, the transition from face-to-face learning to virtual learning is difficult for students in general, and even more difficult for students with hearing loss. Art and design educators have explored approaches to effectively compensate for these challenges and optimize the distance learning experiences for DHH students. This paper aims to investigate these challenges and attempts to explore the international best practices in distance education for deaf learners. Action research is used as a methodology to guide the professional development of art and design educators on ways to refine and hone their online teaching approaches. Ten DHH students (5 Males and 5 females) participated in the action research for the needs of this study. Their challenges, experiences, preferences, needs and artworks were analysed in an attempt to optimize their online learning outcomes and provide recommendations that will lead to the implementation of effective teaching strategies and the design of appropriate e-learning environments for hearing-impaired art and design students. The preliminary findings of the study revealed that the main challenges DHH students and their instructors faced were communication barriers and misinterpretation of tasks, which led to difficulties in fulfilling the course intended outcomes. The recommendations formulated on the basis of the findings are to adapt the intended learning outcomes and teaching approaches to optimize the learning experiences of the DHH students. © Authors This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International License (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0).","Al Hashimi, S.; Alsindi, D.","International Journal of Learning, Teaching and Educational Research",https://doi.org/10.26803/ijlter.20.7.1,11

However, there is an important hesitance towards the vaccine. The aim of this study is to evaluate the vaccination hesitance and main concerns towards the vaccine among surgeons. METHODS: An anonymous survey of 16 questions was sent to 138 Belgian surgeons before the start of vaccination in Belgium. The questions were divided into sections, evaluating demographics, COVID-19 test status and symptoms, the surgeon's opinion on the COVID-19 vaccination and their main concerns. RESULTS: Ninety-three out of 138 surgeons (67.4%) completed the survey: two-third of them were residents. Sixty-nine surgeons (74.2%) do want to get vaccinated. Forty-two surgeons (45.2%) feel like they do not have enough information about the vaccine. Residents feel significantly more underinformed than consultants (52.3% and 29.0%, respectively). Surgeons who feel to be well-informed are more willing to get vaccinated (92.2%) compared to those who feel to have a lack of information (52.4%). The main concerns among surgeons include effectiveness (26.9%), safety and side effects (19.4%) and organisation and vaccination strategy (12.9%). Twenty-five surgeons (26.9%) have no concerns at all. CONCLUSION: Most surgeons (74.2%) are ready for their COVID-19 vaccine. However, some of the surgeons are still doubtful about the vaccine. A lack of information plays a major role in their scepticism. A strong communication strategy is necessary to educate, reassure and motivate surgeons to get vaccinated.","Farid, Yasser; Vissers, Gino; Ortiz, Soccoro; Tondu, Thierry; Thiessen, Filip; Coppieters, Yves; Wauthy, Pierre",Acta Chir Belg,https://doi.org/10.1080/00015458.2021.1975892,11

Studies using mosses allow both short-and long-term air quality monitoring. The increasing contamination of the environment (including air) is causing a search for new, cheap and effective methods of monitoring its condition. Once such method is the use of mosses in active biomonitoring. The aim of the study was to assess the atmospheric aerosol pollution with selected heavy metals (Ni, Cu, Zn, Cd, Hg and Pb) from the smoke of fireworks used during New Year’s Eve in the years 2019/2020 and 2020/2021. In studies a biomonitoring moss-bag method with moss Pleurozium schreberi (Willd. ex Brid.) Mitt. genus Pleurozium was used. The research was conducted in the town Prószków (5 km in south direction from Opole, opolskie voivodship, Poland). The moss was exposed 14 days before 31 December (from 17 to 30 of December), on New Year’s Eve (31 December and 1 January) and 2 weeks after the New Year (from 2–15 January). Higher concentrations of analysed elements were determined in samples exposed during New Year’s Eve. Increases in concentrations were demonstrated by analysis of the Relative Accumulation Factor (RAF). The results indicate that the use of fireworks during New Year’s Eve causes an increase in air pollution with heavy metals. In addition, it was shown that the COVID-19 induced restrictions during New Year’s Eve 2020 resulted in a reduction of heavy metal content in moss samples and thus in lower atmospheric aerosol pollution with these analytes. The study confirmed moss usefulness in monitoring of atmospheric aerosol pollution from point sources. © 2021 by the authors.

Nevertheless, middle age is often overlooked in neuroscience under the assumption that this is a time of relative stability, although cognitive decline, as well as changes in brain structure and function are well-established by the age of 60. Here we characterized the middle-aged brain in the context of healthy younger and older adults by assessing resting-state electrophysiological and neuromagnetic activity in two different samples (N = 179, 631). Alpha and beta oscillations – two key ageing signatures – were analyzed in terms of spectral power and burst events. While posterior alpha power and burst rate features changed linearly with age, similarly to behavioral measures, sensorimotor beta power and burst rate properties varied non-linearly, with inflection points during middle age. The findings suggest that ageing is characterized by distinct spatial and temporal brain dynamics, some critically arising in middle age.","Gula, Justyna; Moiseeva, Victoria; Ruiz, Maria Herrojo; Cappelletti, Marinella",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.06.04.447084,11

During the pandemic period, the follow-up and treatment of patients who were diagnosed with rheumatic disease and used corticosteroid, immunosuppressive, biological or synthetic DMARDs and disease management during SARS-CoV2 infection still remain a problem. Objectives: In this study, it was aimed to share the demographic data of 52 patients with inflammatory rheumatic disease diagnosed with SARS-COV2 who were followed up and treated in the Rheumatology Department of Private Doruk Hospital during the SARS-COV2 pandemic. Additionally, it is aimed to examine the primary rheumatological diseases of the patients, their biological and conventional DMARD treatments, their comorbidities and the course of SARS-COV2. Methods: Fifty-two patients who were diagnosed with SARS-COV2 by PCR method while being followed up and treated in the rheumatology center between May 2020 and November 2020 and get COVID treatment in the same center were included in the study. All patients diagnosed with SARS-COV2 and required hospitalization were hospitalized in the same center and followed up and treated. The files and electronic records of the patients were retrospectively recorded by the rheumatologist who followed the patients. Results: In this retrospective study conducted from a single center, 52 patients whose diagnosis of SARS-COV2 was confirmed by PCR were included. Distribution of primary rheumatic diseases of the patients;19 rheumatoid arthritis (RA), 14 Ankylosing spondylitis (AS), 4 Psoriatic Arthritis (PsA), 4 Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), 5 Behcet's Disease (BD), 4 Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF), 2 Sjögren's syndrome. 76.8% of the patients were female, 22.2% male, their mean age was 47 ± 18. Biological drug use rate of 37 patients in RA, AS and PsA groups was 83.7% (monotherapy or combination 31/37). Moreover, 16.2% (6/37) of the patients were using synthetic DMARD combination (MTX+SLZ +HCQ) and 40.5% (15/37) of the patients were using a combination of biological and synthetic DMARDs. While 73% (38/52) of 52 patients had a mild course, 27% (14/52) had severe SARS-COV2 requiring hospitalization. 14 patients who had severe SARS-COV2 infection and required hospitalization, 10 were followed up with the diagnosis of RA, 2 with AS and 2 with SLE. Hospitalization of patients using monotherapy biological drugs (TNF inhibitor, Tocilizumab, IL 17-A) due to severe SARS-COV2 was found to be lower than the group using combined synthetic DMARDs with steroids (MTX+SSZ+HCQ) (p <0.05). The corticosteroid dose of the RA patients was in the range of 5-10 mg/day. The rate of having severe SARS-COV2 was found to be higher in the combination group using biological or synthetic DMARD and low dose corticosteroids compared to group using monotherapy biologicals (p <0.05). The rate of having severe SARSCOV2 was found to be significantly higher in the group using 10/mg or more at the time of diagnosis (p <0.05). Two patients with SLE multiple organ involvement had severe SARS-COV2 while using rituximab, and hospitalization was required. In terms of comorbidities, hypertension was the most common comorbidity with 64.2% (9/14) in the group with severe SARS-COV2, followed by obesity with 21.4% (3/14). Conclusion: In patients with inflammatory rheumatic disease, SARS-COV-2 infection and the drugs used for the treatment of primary disease are still considered to be a difficult situation in terms of prognosis. In our study with limited cases, data suggesting that there is no increased risk of SARS-COV2 requiring hospitalization in patients using TNF inhibitors, tocilizumab and IL17-A blockers. It was thought that there might be a drug-induced increased risk due to the severe SARS-COV2 infection that developed in our two patients who used rituximab, but the disease-related risk increase was not ignored because the patients were SLE patients with active multi-organ invol ement.","Karabulut, Y.",Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases,https://doi.org/10.1136/annrheumdis-2021-eular.3672,11

Much less is known about humans’ ability to deploy such alpha lateralization in time, and to thus exploit alpha power as a spatio-temporal filter. Here we show that spatially lateralized alpha power does signify - beyond the direction of spatial attention - the distribution of attention in time and thereby qualifies as a spatio-temporal attentional filter. Participants (N = 20) selectively listened to spoken numbers presented on one side (left vs right), while competing numbers were presented on the other side. Key to our hypothesis, temporal foreknowledge was manipulated via a visual cue, which was either instructive and indicated the to-be-probed number position (70% valid) or neutral. Temporal foreknowledge did guide participants’ attention, as they recognized numbers from the to-be-attended side more accurately following valid cues. In the magnetoencephalogram (MEG), spatial attention to the left versus right side induced lateralization of alpha power in all temporal cueing conditions. Modulation of alpha lateralization at the 0.8-Hz presentation rate of spoken numbers was stronger following instructive compared to neutral temporal cues. Critically, we found stronger modulation of lateralized alpha power specifically at the onsets of temporally cued numbers. These results suggest that the precisely timed hemispheric lateralization of alpha power qualifies as a spatio-temporal attentional filter mechanism susceptible to top-down behavioural goals.","Wöstmann, Malte; Maess, Burkhard; Obleser, Jonas",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.13.200584,11

Results: 42 918 bereaved older spouses were included and matched to an equal number of married controls (mean age 78.9 [SD 7.2] years, 68% women). During the first year of follow-up, the risk of death from any cause was 1.66 (95% confidence interval 1.53 to 1.80) times higher for bereaved cases than for married controls, and bereaved cases survived on average 4.2 days shorter than married controls. Bereaved cases also experienced an increased risk of acute cardiovascular events (incidence rate ratio 1.34, 1.24 to 1.44), hip fracture (1.48, 1.30 to 1.68), pneumonia (1.14, 1.04 to 1.25), and self-harm (3.49, 2.11 to 5.76). These associations were strongly time-dependent, increasing sharply immediately after spousal loss and weakening as time elapsed. In the self-controlled cohort crossover study, the relative incidence ratios increased for all four secondary outcomes, starting already during the 6-month period preceding spousal loss. Conclusion: Among older persons, the association between spousal bereavement and the risk of negative health outcomes and mortality is most likely causal. Our finding that the risk of adverse health consequences increases already during the 6 months prior to spousal loss indicates that palliative care services have an important role to play in providing timely bereavement care to spouses and other family caregivers.","Morin, Lucas; Wastesson, Jonas W; Fors, Stefan; Agahi, Neda; Johnell, Kristina",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.16.20067645,11
186040,Localization of neutralizing epitopes and receptor-binding site in murine coronavirus spike protein.,1995,"The lamin B receptor (LBR) is a polytopic integral membrane protein localized exclusively in the inner nuclear membrane domain of the nuclear envelope. Its cDNA deduced primary structure consists of a highly charged amino-terminal domain of 205 residues that faces the nucleoplasm followed by a hydrophobic domain with eight potential transmembrane segments. To identify determinants that sort LBR from its site of integration (RER and outer nuclear membrane) to the inner nuclear membrane, we prepared full-length, truncated, and chimeric cDNA constructs of chick LBR, transfected these into mammalian cells and detected the expressed protein by immunofluorescence microscopy using appropriate antibodies. Surprisingly, we found that the determinants for sorting of LBR to the inner nuclear membrane reside in a region comprising its first transmembrane sequence plus flanking residues on either side. The other transmembrane regions as well as the nucleoplasmic domain are not required for sorting. We propose that the first transmembrane segment of LBR interacts specifically with another transmembrane segment and consider several mechanisms by which such specific interaction could result in sorting to the inner nuclear membrane.",,J Cell Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2119546/,11

Recently, a PrP(Sc)-like intermediate form characterized by the formation of insoluble aggregates and protease-resistant PrP species termed insoluble PrP(C) (iPrP(C)) has been identified in uninfected mammalian brains and cultured neuronal cells, providing new insights into the molecular mechanism(s) of these diseases. Here, we explore the molecular characteristics of the spontaneously formed iPrP(C) in cultured neuroblastoma cells expressing wild-type or mutant human PrP linked to two familial prion diseases. We observed that although PrP mutation at either residue 183 from Thr to Ala (PrP(T183A)) or at residue 198 from Phe to Ser (PrP(F198S)) affects glycosylation at both N-linked glycosylation sites, the T183A mutation that results in intracellular retention significantly increased the formation of iPrP(C). Moreover, while autophagy is increased in F198S cells, it was significantly decreased in T183A cells. Our results indicate that iPrP(C) may be formed more readily in an intracellular compartment and that a significant increase in PrP(T183A) aggregation may be attributable to the inhibition of autophagy.","Zou, Roger S.; Fujioka, Hisashi; Guo, Jian-Ping; Xiao, Xiangzhu; Shimoji, Miyuki; Kong, Crystal; Chen, Cecilia; Tasnadi, Megan; Voma, Chesinta; Yuan, Jue; Moudjou, Mohammed; Laude, Hubert; Petersen, Robert B.; Zou, Wen-Quan",Aging (Albany NY),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3229973/,11

From one point-of-view the demand for new and more versatile diagnostic is increasing due to a deeper knowledge of biomarkers and their combination with diseases. From another point-of-view a decentralization of diagnostics will occur since decisions can be made faster resulting in higher success of therapy. Hence, new types of technologies have to be established which enables a multiparameter analysis at the point-of-care. Within this review-like article a system called Fraunhofer ivD-platform is introduced. It consists of a credit-card sized cartridge with integrated reagents, sensors and pumps and a read-out/processing unit. Within the cartridge the assay runs fully automated within 15-20 minutes. Due to the open design of the platform different analyses such as antibody, serological or DNA-assays can be performed. Specific examples of these three different assay types are given to show the broad applicability of the system.","Schumacher, Soeren; Sartorius, Dorian; Ehrentreich-Förster, Eva; Bier, Frank F.",EJIFCC,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4975254/,11

In an attempt to develop a small nonhuman primate model of Lassa fever, common marmosets were subcutaneously inoculated with Lassa virus strain Josiah. This inoculation resulted in a systemic disease with clinical and morphological features mirroring those in fatal human Lassa infection: fever, weight loss, high viremia and viral RNA load in tissues, elevated liver enzymes, and severe morbidity between days 15 and 20. The most prominent histopathology findings included multifocal hepatic necrosis with mild inflammation and hepatocyte proliferation, lymphoid depletion, and interstitial nephritis. Cellular aggregates in regions of hepatocellular necrosis were largely composed of HAM56-positive macrophages, devoid of CD3-positive and CD20-positive cells, and characterized by marked reductions in the intensity of HLA-DP, DQ, DR staining. A marked reduction in the major histocompatibility complex class II expression was also observed in the lymph nodes. Immunophenotypic alterations in spleen included reductions in overall numbers of CD20-positive and CD3-positive cells and the disruption of lymphoid follicular architecture. These findings identify the common marmoset as an appropriate model of human Lassa fever and present the first experimental evidence that replication of Lassa virus in tissues is associated with alterations that would be expected to impair adaptive immunity.","Carrion, Ricardo; Brasky, Kathleen; Mansfield, Keith; Johnson, Curtis; Gonzales, Monica; Ticer, Anysha; Lukashevich, Igor; Tardif, Suzette; Patterson, Jean",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17409137/,11

For IgG, the median optical density at 450 nm (OD450) turned positive at day 17 and a biphasic response was observed. At day 240, all patients were still positive for anti-nucleocapsid protein IgG antibody. For IgM, the median OD450 turned positive at day 20.5, peaked at about day 80, and fell to below the baseline level at about day 180.

YHV virions purified from infected shrimp contain three major structural proteins of molecular mass 116 kDa (gp116), 64 kDa (gp64) and 20 kDa (p20). Two different staining methods indicated that the gp116 and gp64 proteins are glycosylated. Here we report the complete nucleotide sequence of ORF3, which encodes a polypeptide of 1666 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 185 713 Da (pI=6.68). Hydropathy analysis of the deduced ORF3 protein sequence identified six potential transmembrane helices and three ectodomains containing multiple sites for potential N-linked and O-linked glycosylation. N-terminal sequence analysis of mature gp116 and gp64 proteins indicated that each was derived from ORF3 by proteolytic cleavage of the polyprotein between residues Ala(228) and Thr(229), and Ala(1127) and Leu(1128), located at the C-terminal side of transmembrane helices 3 and 5, respectively. Comparison with the deduced ORF3 protein sequence of Australian gill-associated virus (GAV) indicated 83 % amino acid identity in gp64 and 71 % identity in gp116, which featured two significant sequence deletions near the N terminus.

The present authors studied the impact of self-administered (SA) and standardised dyspnoea questions on CRQ measurement properties. In a factorial design multicentre trial, 177 patients with CRD (mean age 67.7 yrs; mean forced expiratory volume in one second per cent predicted 44.6%) were randomised to CRQ-IA (n = 86) or CRQ-SA (n = 91), and to initially complete the standardised or individualised items before and after respiratory rehabilitation. While maintaining validity, the CRQ-SA proved more responsive to changes in HRQL than the CRQ-IA in all domains. Compared with the standardised dyspnoea domain, the individualised dyspnoea domain indicated greater responsiveness. The correlations of baseline scores and change scores with other HRQL instruments indicated good validity of the CRQ-SA. In conclusion, self-administration and standardisation of the chronic respiratory questionnaire maintains validity and responsiveness relative to the interviewer-administered chronic respiratory questionnaire. These results challenge the assumption that interviewer-administered questionnaires are superior to self-administered questionnaires in older patients with chronic respiratory disease.","Schünemann, H J; Goldstein, R; Mador, M J; McKim, D; Stahl, E; Puhan, M; Griffith, L E; Grant, B; Austin, P; Collins, R; Guyatt, G H",The European respiratory journal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15640320/,11

Many patients have a remitting-relapsing course of disease with exacerbations often following unrelated microbial illnesses. The relationship between the two events remains obscure. One possibility is that T cells specific for the inciting microbial pathogen are able to effect demyelination at a site of ongoing inflammation within the CNS. This possibility was examined in mice infected with mouse hepatitis virus, a well-described model of virus-induced demyelination. Using transgenic TCR/recombination activation gene 2(-/-) mice with only non-mouse hepatitis virus-specific T cells, we show that CD8 T cells are able to cause demyelination in the absence of cognate Ag in the CNS, but only if specifically activated. These findings demonstrate a novel mechanism for immune-mediated neuropathology and show that activated CD8 T cells may serve as important mediators of bystander demyelination during times of infection, including in patients with multiple sclerosis.","Haring, Jodie S; Pewe, Lecia L; Perlman, Stanley",Journal of immunology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12133983/,11

These host range mutants replicated efficiently in normally nonpermissive Chinese hamster ovary (CHO), in human hepatocarcinoma (HepG2), and to a lesser extent in human breast carcinoma (MCF7) cell lines. Little if any replication was noted in baby hamster kidney (BHK), green African monkey kidney (COS-7), feline kidney (CRFK), and swine testicular (ST) cell lines. By fluorescent antibody (FA) staining, persistent viruses V10B and V30B, isolated at days 38 and 119 days postinfection, also demonstrated very low levels of replication in human HepG2 cells. These data suggest that persistence may rapidly select for host range expansion of animal viruses. Pretreatment of HepG2 cells with a polyclonal antibody directed against human carcinoembryonic antigens (CEA) or with some monoclonal antibodies (Col-1, Col-4, Col-12, and Col-14) that bind human CEA significantly inhibited V51B infection. Under identical conditions, little or no blockade was evident with other monoclonal antibodies (kat4c or Col-6) which also bind the human CEA glycoproteins. In addition, an antibody (EDDA) directed against irrelevant antigens did not block V51B replication. Pretreatment with the Col-4 and Col-14 antibodies did not block Sindbis virus replication in HepG2 cells or MHV infection in DBT cells, suggesting that one or more CEA glycoproteins likely functioned as receptors for V51B entry into human cell lines. To test this hypothesis, the human biliary glycoprotein (Bgp) and CEA genes were cloned and expressed in normally nonpermissive BHK cell lines by using noncytopathic Sindbis virus replicons (pSinRep19). By growth curves and FA staining, human CEA and to a much lesser extent human Bgp functioned as receptors for V51B entry. Furthermore, V51B replication was blocked with polyclonal antiserum directed against human CEA and Bgp. Under identical conditions, the parental MHV strain A59 failed to replicate in BHK cells expressing human Bgp or CEA. These data suggest that MHV persistence may promote virus cross-species transmissibility by selecting for virus variants that recognize phylogenetic homologues of the normal receptor.","Baric, R S; Sullivan, E; Hensley, L; Yount, B; Chen, W",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9847369/,11

Subsites A, E, and F were conserved on all TGEV and PRCV strains examined.

The 2 MAb to subsite D reacted with all TGEV strains examined, but not with 2 US PRCV strains, 2 European PRCV strains, 1 feline infectious peritonitis virus strain, and 1 canine coronavirus strain.

This mini review will build upon previously published comprehensive reviews by reorganizing the anti-apoptotic strategies specific for CTL induced apoptosis and integrating recent discoveries in viral evasion of Fas/FasL and perforin/granzyme mediated apoptosis. This updated look at viral evasion in the context of the CTL response should generate dialogue and provide impetus for research to illuminate interactions between the best defense against viruses and the viral adaptations to evade this defense.","Keckler, M Shannon",Frontiers in bioscience : a journal and virtual library,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17127333/,11

METHODS 350 throat washes of confirmed, suspected and observed SARS cases were tested by TaqMan and molecular beacon fluorescence RT-PCR methods. 386 animals with 442 nasal-throat swabs, fecal swabs of animals and cell cultured were detected by TaqMan method and conventional RT-PCR method. RESULTS 10 positive were detected from 41 SARS clinical confirmed cases (24.39%). The results of TaqMan and molecular beacon are basically coincident with the coincident rate of 88.89%. 18 cell cultures with CPE were detected and find 16 positive, among which, 14 were civet cats (87.5%). The detecting results of animal samples from Dongmen Market (Shenzhen) and other markets and farms in peripheral areas show that: the total positive rate of 4 kinds of wild animal (civet cat, raccoon dog, hog-badge and Chinese ferret-badge) is 39.02% , which has an significant difference (P < 0.01) compared with the positive rate of other animals as 0. The positive rate of PCR for nasal and fecal swabs from 109 major wild animals is 44.04%, but the positive rate of 145 wild live-animals is 0. CONCLUSION TaqMan and molecular beacon PCR methods both can be used in SARS detection.The results could support the hypothesis that animals (especially civet cat) could carry SARS virus.","Zhao, Jin; Fang, Shi-Song; He, Ya-Qing; Yang, Hong; Liu, Jianjun; Hu, Qinghua; He, Jianfan; Liu, Tao; Liu, Xiaoli; Zhuang, Zhixiong; Zhang, Dan; Zhou, Jun'an",Wei sheng yan jiu = Journal of hygiene research,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16229261/,11

188971,Detection of transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus antigens by a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique.,1986,"Five strains of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) were isolated from five layer flocks that had nephropathogenic infection in four provinces in China. Among them, three of the five flocks had been vaccinated against infectious bronchitis. Virulence studies indicated that the five Chinese IBV isolates caused 10 to 30% mortality in 15-day-old specific pathogen free chickens and gross lesions were mainly confined to the kidneys in all of the dead chickens. Two oligonucleotide pairs, S1Uni2 and S1Oligo3' or S1Oligo5' and S1Oligo3', were used after propagation of the isolates in embryonated eggs to amplify the S1 protein genes of the spike protein. The cDNA derived by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction was cloned and sequenced. The nucleotide and amino acid sequence of S1 protein gene had a similar degree of identity (> or =92%) among the five Chinese IBV isolates. The nucleotide and amino acid identity of the S1 protein gene between the five Chinese IBV isolates and 16 strains of other IBVs varied from 60 to 81%. This clearly showed that the five Chinese IBV isolates comprised a separate genotype. These results demonstrated, for the first time, that there is a new genotype of nephropathogenic IBV circulating in vaccinated and non-vaccinated flocks in China.","Liu, Shengwang; Kong, Xiangang",Avian pathology : journal of the W.V.P.A,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15223561/,11
189166,Murine coronavirus packaging signal confers packaging to nonviral RNA.,1997,"Despite a great increase in our understanding of the molecular biology of the viruses associated with acute upper respiratory tract viral infections (URTIs) there is a remarkable lack of knowledge and ideas about why URTI should exhibit a seasonal incidence. Most publications in this area either acknowledge a complete lack of any explanation for the seasonality of URTI or put forward an explanation relating to an increased ""crowding"" of susceptible persons in winter. This review will discuss some of the ideas concerning the seasonality of URTI and put forward a new hypothesis for discussion, namely that seasonal exposure to cold air causes an increase in the incidence of URTI due to cooling of the nasal airway. The hypothesis is supported by literature reports demonstrating that inhalation of cold air causes cooling of the nasal epithelium, and that this reduction in nasal temperature is sufficient to inhibit respiratory defences against infection such as mucociliary clearance and the phagocytic activity of leukocytes. A case is also made to suggest that warming of the nasal airway during fever and nasal congestion may help to resolve a current URTI.","Eccles, R",Acta oto-laryngologica,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11936911/,11

PATIENTS Twenty-one HIV-seropositive patients (13 asymptomatic and eight with diarrhoea) and 12 controls from an urban referral-based tertiary care centre in Berlin who underwent duodenoscopy. METHODS A new miniaturized Ussing chamber allowed measurements on duodenal forceps biopsies. Epithelial barrier function was characterized by alternating current impedance analysis, which allows differentiation of epithelial and subepithelial resistance and by 3H-lactulose and 3H-mannitol flux measurements. Na+-glucose cotransport was quantified as phlorizin-sensitive short circuit current (Isc) and active ion secretion by baseline and bumetanide-sensitive Isc. RESULTS Duodenal biopsies from asymptomatic HIV-infected patients were no different from controls, whereas biopsies from HIV-infected patients with diarrhoea showed a decrease in epithelial resistance from 21.2+/-1.9 to 12.9+/-1.3 omega cm2 (P<0.01). Concomitantly, mucosal-to-serosal lactulose flux increased from 0.29+/-0.02 to 0.40+/-0.03 micromol (hcm2) (P<0.01). Phlorizin-sensitive Isc indicating Na+-glucose cotransport, as well as baseline and bumetanide-sensitive Isc indicating active electrogenic chloride secretion were not different between the three groups. CONCLUSIONS A miniaturized Ussing device was developed for electrophysiological investigations of duodenal forceps biopsies, which allowed characterization of active ion transport mechanisms and epithelial barrier function. Duodenum of HIV-infected patients with diarrhoea showed no evidence for active ion secretion or Na+-glucose malabsorption, but showed an impaired epithelial barrier function, which could contribute to diarrhoea by a leak flux mechanism.","Stockmann, M; Fromm, M; Schmitz, H; Schmidt, W; Riecken, E O; Schulzke, J D",AIDS,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9456254/,11

In this study we examined the prevalence of 4 human coronaviruses, including subtypes OC43, 229E, and the recently described NL63 and HKU1 in a pediatric population presenting to a children's hospital. PATIENTS AND METHODS Specimens collected over a 1-year period from pediatric patients presenting with acute respiratory illness were analyzed for the presence of 4 coronavirus subtypes using consensus and subtype-specific real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction assays. The demographic and clinical characteristics associated with coronavirus infection were examined retrospectively. RESULTS Coronaviruses were detected in 66 of 1043 children. Eight, 11, 19, and 28 specimens were positive for subtypes 229E, NL63, OC43, and HKU1, respectively. Coronaviruses were detected throughout the study period; all 4 of the subtypes were present simultaneously in December. The acute clinical features were similar across subtypes. Of 32 children infected with a coronavirus as the sole respiratory pathogen, 13 had lower respiratory tract disease. Children whose only detectable respiratory virus was a coronavirus were more likely to have underlying chronic disease than were children coinfected with another respiratory virus. CONCLUSIONS Although 4 subtypes of coronavirus were detected, the recently discovered coronavirus subtypes NL63 and HKU1 accounted for the majority of coronaviruses detected in our cohort of mostly hospitalized children with respiratory symptoms. New subtypes likely represent a substantial portion of previously unexplained respiratory illnesses.","Kuypers, Jane; Martin, Emily T; Heugel, Judson; Wright, Nancy; Morrow, Rhoda; Englund, Janet A",Pediatrics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17130280/,11

Kaduna is one of the states in Nigeria with a high number of COVID-19 infected individuals. Some staff of Barau Dikko Teaching Hospital, Kaduna (BDTH) were infected with COVID-19 during the initial period of the pandemic. Most of the infected staff were from the General Out-Patient Clinic (GOPC), as it was the only Department with up to 11 staff infected during this initial period of the COVID-19 pandemic. This had led to the temporary closure of the Department. The aim of this paper is to characterize the GOPC Staff that tested positive to COVID-19 following previous contact with COVID-19 patients that were seen at the GOPC during the first wave of the pandemic. This is with the view to consider GOPC staff as high risk and frontline health workers for COVID 19. It was a retrospective study, and data were collected from the record of all the staff of the GOPC who were traced to have had contact with the COVID-19 positive patients and were also tested positive. Eleven (34%) out of the 32 staff were infected with COVID-19 at the GOPC. Only 1 staff was above 50 years. Most of them had mild symptoms and had side effects from the antiviral drugs. Staff of the GOPC are at risk of COVID-19 infection and should be considered frontline workers for COVID-19.","Abubakar, R; Zubairu, H D; Badamasi, M S; Abubakar, K A",West African journal of medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34331530/,11

Indicator improvements could include provisional case-counts by causes of death, besides the age-standardization of specified causes of death and the Potential Years of Life Lost by cause of death, for territorial comparison. Meanwhile, the usefulness of social indicators applied to the statistics of death causes could be enhanced, as is the case of education. By updating the databases, it would be possible to maintain the registries of deceased and their causes of death without an annual closure before the statistical publication. Moreover, we could link the databases of demographic records of the population to their health files, to obtain individually the people at risk of sickness or death, and to enable their respective vital, social, health trajectories for statistics. In this way, the INE would increase its leadership and reference on mortality statistics in Spain and EuroStat, as well. Furthermore, the State, Autonomous and municipal administrations could redefine their publication offer into a more specified or innovative statistics of death causes.","Cirera Suárez, Lluís; Zurriaga Llorens, Oscar",Revista espanola de salud publica,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34651616/,11
189409,Insertion of a new transcriptional unit into the genome of mouse hepatitis virus.,1999,"Taxanes, which are used to treat breast cancer, damage the microtubules of normal nerve cells, causing numbness of the fingers related to chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy(CIPN); therefore, effective methods for reducing numbness are needed. In 2017, it was reported that physical stimuli related to massage improved finger blood flow volumes, contributing to the regeneration of damaged nerves. We developed a method of hand therapy for breast cancer patients complaining of numbness related to anticancer drug administration, and examined its effects on numbness. Hand therapy was performed by a single therapist who received lectures at the Sophia Phytotherapy College, which is accredited by the Japan Handcare Association. The fingertips to wrist, ankle, metacarpal bones, palm, and elbow were massaged using the bilateral arms/fingers for 15minutes. We investigated the influences of daily living status(Support Team Assessment Sched- ule-Japan: STAS-J), age, body mass index(BMI), severity/site of numbness, type of numbness, type of drug, duration of breast cancer, duration of numbness, and presence or absence of lymph node dissection, and evaluated the severity of numbness using a 10-cm Visual Analog Scale(VAS). The study included 51 breast cancer patients complaining of numbness of the fingers, with a mean age of 59 years. In patients with relatively mild numbness(STAS-J 1), the VAS scores before and after hand therapy were 4.7±1.8 and 1.9±1.3, respectively, showing a marked decrease. In STAS-J 2 patients, the values were 4.9 ±1.4 and 2.1±1.3, respectively, also showing a marked decrease. Thus, this hand therapy reduced numbness in mild- and moderate-status patients. Statistical comparisons were performed between the STAS-J 1/2(mild/moderate numbness)and STAS-J 3/4(severe numbness)groups. Although the severity of numbness was not correlated with age, BMI, type of drug, lymph node dissection, or duration of breast cancer, the proportion of patients with a B1-year history of numbness was significantly larger in the STAS-J 1/2 group. The most frequent site of numbness was from the proximal interphalangeal joints to the fingertips. Concerning the severity of numbness, many patients complained of severe numbness, as represented by that after sitting straight. These results suggest that this hand therapy is effective for reducing numbness in patients receiving taxanes and complaining of mild to moderate numbness.","Sasaki, Akiko; Ikeda, Akiko; Tsunoda, Yuko; Sawada, Terumasa; Tsurutani, Junji; Tatsuo, Tokito; Kiuchi, Yuji; Nakamura, Seigo",Gan to kagaku ryoho.

Sequencing analysis of the viral structural proteins revealed four and one amino acid substitutions in the S and membrane (M) proteins, respectively. We demonstrated, using a viral-like particle formation system, that the S mutations were involved in the lower incorporation of the S protein into virions, although the M mutation that disrupts the glycosylation was not present in this phenotype. Further mutational experiments identified two substitutions, Y442C and L472F, within the receptor binding domain that could be critical for the reduced S incorporation, as well as reduced binding affinity between the S protein and ACE2 receptor. Thus, these two amino acid substitutions might lead to a conformational change in the S protein, resulting in reduced incorporation into viral particles.","Li, Shu-Ming; Li, Gui-Mei; Nakamura, Shota; Ikuta, Kazuyoshi; Nakaya, Takaaki",Japanese journal of infectious diseases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18362400/,11

We previously found that deletions in the single-stranded tails of a satellite RNA (sat-RNA D) associated with turnip crinkle virus are repaired in vivo (C. D. Carpenter and A. E. Simon, 1996, J. Virol. 70, 478-486). We now extend this analysis to show that sat-RNA D transcripts with 3'-end deletions of 5 bases give rise to wild-type sat-RNA, while deletions of 6 to 11 bases result in sat-RNA with additional deletions to the -14 position joined to internal TCV genomic RNA (or other) sequence followed by replacement of the terminal C1-2UGC1-3 motif. In addition, we have determined that the selection of internal TCV sequence used in the repair of sat-RNA D 3' ends is not random and generation of these short TCV segments likely involves primer-mediated synthesis of abortive products facilitated by base-pairing between internal regions of TCV genomic RNA and oligoribonucleotides generated by abortive cycling from the 3' end of the TCV genome.","Carpenter, C D; Simon, A E",Virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8955033/,11

The present study was undertaken to clarify the mechanism of an extensive JHMV infection in the brain by using neural cells isolated from mouse brain. In contrast to wild-type (wt) JHMV, a soluble-receptor-resistant mutant (srr7) infects and spreads solely in an MHVR-dependent fashion (F. Taguchi and S. Matsuyama, J. Virol. 76:950-958, 2002). In mixed neural cell cultures, srr7 infected a limited number of cells and infection did not spread, although wt JHMV induced syncytia in most of the cells. srr7-infected cells were positive for GS-lectin, a microglia marker. Fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis showed that about 80% of the brain cells stained with anti-MHVR antibody (CC1) were also positive for GS-lectin. Pretreatment of those cells with CC1 prevented virus attachment to the cell surface and also blocked virus infection. These results show that microglia express functional MHVR that mediates JHMV infection. As expected, in microglial cell-enriched cultures, both srr7and wt JHMV produced syncytia in a majority of cells. Treatment with CC1 of mixed neural cell cultures and microglia cultures previously infected with wt virus failed to block the spread of infection, indicating that wt infection spreads in an MHVR-independent fashion. Thus, the present study indicates that microglial cells are the major population of the initial target for MHV infection and that the wt spreads from initially infected microglia to a variety of cells in an MHVR-independent fashion.","Nakagaki, Keiko; Nakagaki, Kazuhide; Taguchi, Fumihiro",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15857995/,11

METHODS Both qualitative and quantitative methods were used in data collection and analyses. Quantitative surveys would include 1. The setting, functions and administration of current 63 'fever clinics' in Beijing; 2. Survey on patients with fever who had visited 'fever clinics' and randomly selected from the 63 fever clinics; 3. Survey on physicians working in the 'fever clinics'. Qualitative studies would include discussion or interview with administrators, physicians working in the 'fever clinics' and field studies on 23 randomly selected 'fever clinics' as well as telephone interview to the staff working in the hospitals that did not have the 'fever clinics'. RESULTS A couple of significant problems raised during the study including: 1. Low coverage of current surveillance system. 89% of the hospitals were not covered by the surveillance system which reflecting the misjudgment on the patients with fever that they would only attend 'fever clinics' to seek for medical help. The fact was that most of the hospitals where 'fever clinics' had not been set also received patients with fever. 2. Information related to patients with fever needs to improve regarding its completeness and accuracy. 3. Significant unbalance in daily cost and effectiveness in most of the 'fever clinics' was noticed. CONCLUSION 'Fever clinics' needs to be adjusted to meet the possible SARS epidemic in coming winter and spring.

MAFbx/Atrogin-1 is a muscle specific E3 ubiquitin ligase upregulated during disuse, immobilization and fasting or systemic diseases such as diabetes, cancer, AIDS and renal failure. This response is necessary to induce a rapid and functional atrophy. To date, the targets of MAFbx/Atrogin-1 in skeletal muscle remain to be identified. We have recently presented evidence that eIF3-f, a regulatory subunit of the eukaryotic translation factor eIF3 is a key target that accounts for MAFbx/Atrogin-1 function in muscle atrophy. More importantly, we showed that eIF3-f acts as a ""translational enhancer"" that increases the efficiency of the structural muscle proteins synthesis leading to both in vitro and in vivo muscle hypertrophy. We propose that eIF3-f subunit, a mTOR/S6K1 scaffolding protein in the IGF-1/Akt/mTOR dependent control of protein translation, is a positive actor essential to the translation of specific mRNAs probably implicated in muscle hypertrophy. The central role of eIF3-f in both the atrophic and hypertrophic pathways will be discussed in the light of its promising potential in muscle wasting therapy.","Csibi, Alfredo; Tintignac, Lionel A; Leibovitch, Marie Pierre; Leibovitch, Serge A",Cell cycle,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18583931/,11

Recombinant mouse hepatitis viruses expressing the accessory hemagglutinin esterase protein display reduced fitness in vitro.,2005,"We report the earliest known cluster of SARS-CoV-2 infection so far reported, which occurred in New Zealand in late February 2020. The cluster includes one confirmed and five probable cases. The cluster was identified while investigating a weak positive nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test that was returned by a male in his 60s in September 2020. The PCR result, combined with a clear clinical and epidemiological history of a COVID-19 like illness in late February 2020, prompted serological testing. SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies were detected and supported historical infection. Serology was also reactive for five close contacts who had also experienced a COVID-19 like illness in February 2020. Combined case histories and investigations suggest that this local cluster was import related, with the index case identified as a family member visiting from Italy in February. Case investigation also suggests this cluster was active in New Zealand prior to any previously documented local cases, indicating that SARS-CoV-2 was present and local transmission was occurring earlier than initially suspected. A weak positive PCR result, six months after acute infection, supports international evidence that SARS-CoV-2 genetic material can be detected for several months after initial COVID-19 infection, and that this is not necessarily indicative of infectivity.","Becker, Elizabeth; Vipond, Richard; Mansell, Chris",The New Zealand medical journal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33767480/,11

Inactivation of receptors by neuraminidase treatment and restoration of receptors by enzymatic resialylation of asialo-cells is described as a method to determine (i) the type of sialic acid that is recognized; (ii) the linkage specificity of the viral binding activity; (iii) the minimal amount of sialic acid required for virus attachment. Evidence is presented that both glycoproteins and glycolipids can serve as receptors for BCV provided they contain 9-O-acetylated sialic acid. A model is introduced proposing that after initial binding to sialic acid-containing receptors, the S-protein of BCV interacts with a specific protein receptor. This interaction may result in a conformational change that exposes a fusogenic domain and thus induces the fusion between the viral and the cellular membrane.","Schultze, B; Herrler, G",Archives of virology.

190361,Cis-acting sequences may contribute to size variation in the surface glycoprotein of bovine immunodeficiency virus.,2001,"INTRODUCTION The Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) is essential to avoid the COVID-19 spread to health care workers. Its use can be difficult, posing a high risk of contamination, mainly during doffing, then with the risk of becoming infected. METHODS We conducted a prospective before-and-after design that used clinical simulation as a research methodology in a clinical simulation center of Colombia. A simulation-based educational intervention with two cases related to COVID-19 was proposed in the emergency room and the intensive care unit. We conducted A workshop for donning and doffing of personal protective equipment (PPE) and a debriefing after the first case. RESULTS In the pre-test, 100% of participants failed donning and doffing PPE, 98.4% were contaminated, only one-person did not contaminate out of. The mean cognitive load was high (7.43±0.9 points). In the post-test, 100% were successful in donning the PPE and 94.8% in doffing; only 9.8% were contaminated. The mean of the cognitive load was low (4.1±1.4 points), and the performance was high (7.9±1.1). Of the total, 73.8% of participants reported overload in the doffing. The most difficulties were in gown/overall, and N95 mask removal. DISCUSSION The PPE donning and doffing is critical and may be changed significantly by active training. In responding to the current COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, activities of training in donning and doffing PPE would provide a means of training personnel, reducing the cognitive load and maybe the risk of contamination and infection of health care workers.","Díaz-Guio, Diego Andrés; Ricardo-Zapata, Alejandra; Ospina-Velez, Jeniffer; Gómez-Candamil, Gabriel; Mora-Martinez, Santiago; Rodriguez-Morales, Alfonso J",Le infezioni in medicina,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32532947/,11

Almost all isolates after 2005 were clustered into group 4, and there was no regional specificity in these clusters. To differentiate the genotypes without sequencing, a simple technique-reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction/restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis (RT-PCR/RFLP)-was developed.

190758,Tracing the origin and co-phylogeny of the caliciviruses.,2006,"BACKGROUND The continuation of the health emergency due to the management of COVID-19 is having a profound effect on all aspects of society, including mental health and physical health. This observational study examined practitioners of psychiatric rehabilitation and therapeutic communities, focusing on the emotional aspects of patient care, in particular the fatigue of compassion, empathy and lack of hope, aspects that could be directly linked to the burnout of health professionals, as found in other similar studies. METHOD In this study, self-administered scale data was collected in 87 healthcare professionals recruited from 3 different psychiatric rehabilitation communities. In particular, we assessed the fatigue of compassion, vicarious trauma, burnout and hope (hopeless), empathy and depressive symptoms in the two months of May and June 2021. RESULTS The results obtained after the administration of the following rating scales, ProQOL, BHS, SAVE-9, BDI-II and BEES, showed an overall increase in scores in all professional figures, a significant fatigue of compassion, while the percentage burnout is not present in several groups. The presence of high levels of hope, satisfaction of compassion is indicative of a moderate level of empathy in some professional figures; these high levels can protect workers from the risk of developing work-related stress and depressive symptoms. CONCLUSIONS The data obtained with this study are not similar to those of previous studies, although they may indicate the importance of factors such as hope, empathy in the care of the patient with psychic disorders in rehabilitation communities, underlining the need for interventions aimed at the emotional management of the care relationship as a tool to improve care and prevent burnout even during times of high stress, such as managing a pandemic.","Vacca, Antonella; Minò, Maria Vincenza; Colizzi, Ivana; Solomita, Barbara; Longo, Roberto; Franza, Francesco; Tavormina, Giuseppe",Psychiatria Danubina,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34559788/,11

190877,Characterization of replicative intermediate RNA of mouse hepatitis virus: presence of leader RNA sequences on nascent chains.,1983,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a new infectious disease that emerged in mid- November 2002 in Guangdong, southern China. The global pandemic began in late February 2003 in Hong Kong. By the time SARS was declared contained on 5 July 2003 by the World Health Organization (WHO), it had afflicted 8096 patients in 29 countries. No other disease had had such a phenomenal impact on healthcare workers (HCWs), who formed about 21% of SARS patients. In Vietnam, Canada and Singapore, HCWs accounted for 57%, 43% and 41% of SAR patients, respectively. At the beginning of the outbreak, there was practically no information on this disease, which did not even have a name until 16 March 2003, except that it was infectious and could result in potentially fatal respiratory failure. Indeed, HCWs had lost their lives to SARS. Understandably, some HCWs refused to look after SARS patients or even resigned. Initially, much negative publicity was given to such HCWs. It was a very trying time for HCWs as many were also ostracised by the society which they served. They were perceived to be a potential source of infection in the community because of their contact with SARS patients, whom they risked their lives looking after. Subsequently, as we learnt more about the disease and educated the public about the plight of the frontline HCWs, the public gave the frontline HCWs tremendous support and even honoured them as heroes. Being in the medical profession, caring for patients is one of our expected responsibilities. On the other hand, as public citizens, HCWs have the right to resign when they feel that their responsibility to their families should take priority over that to their patients. As a result of this scourge, each HCW learnt to decide if caring for patients is their chosen profession and vocation. Many chose to live up the Hippocratic oath.","Tai, Dessmon Y H","Annals of the Academy of Medicine, Singapore",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16830007/,11
190968,Virus-encoded proteinases and proteolytic processing in the Nidovirales.,2000,"Porcine organs, cells and tissues provide a viable source of transplants in humans, though there is some concern of public health risk from adaptation of swine infectious agents in humans. Limited information is available on the public health risk of many exogenous swine viruses, and reliable and rapid diagnostic tests are available for only a few of these. The ability of several porcine viruses to cause transplacental fetal infection (parvoviruses, circoviruses, and arteriviruses), emergence or recognition of several new porcine viruses during the last two decades (porcine circovirus, arterivirus, paramyxoviruses, herpesviruses, and porcine respiratory coronavirus) and the immunosuppressed state of the transplant recipients increases the xenozoonoses risk of humans to porcine viruses through transplantation. Much of this risk can be eliminated with vigilance and sustained monitoring along with a better understanding of pathogenesis and development of better diagnostic tests. In this review we present information on selected exogenous viruses, highlighting their characteristics, pathogenesis of viral infections in swine, methods for their detection, and the potential xenozoonoses risk they present. Emphasis has been given in this review to swine influenza virus, paramyxovirus (Nipah virus, Menagle virus, LaPiedad paramyxovirus, porcine paramyxovirus), arterivirus (porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus) and circovirus as either they represent new swine viruses or present the greatest risk. We have also presented information on porcine parvovirus, Japanese encephalitis virus, encephalomyocarditis virus, herpesviruses (pseudorabies virus, porcine lymphotropic herpesvirus, porcine cytomegalovirus), coronaviruses (TGEV, PRCV, HEV, PEDV) and adenovirus. The potential of swine viruses to infect humans needs to be assessed in vitro and in vivo and rapid and more reliable diagnostic methods need to be developed to assure safe supply of porcine tissues and cells for xenotransplantation.","Paul, P S; Halbur, P; Janke, B; Joo, H; Nawagitgul, P; Singh, J; Sorden, S",Current topics in microbiology and immunology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12934944/,11

Serial serum samples from eight patients collected during the first, third, and ninth months after the onset of infection were evaluated. It was found that low-avidity IgG antibodies were detected in 15/15 (100%), 1/5 (20%), and 0/8 (0%) serum samples collected during the first, third, and ninth months after the onset of symptoms, respectively. Low-avidity antibodies of IgA and IgM subclasses were detected in 14/14 (100%) and 3/14 (21%) serum samples, respectively, collected in the first month after the onset of infection. However, IgA antibodies remained low in avidity in a proportion of patients even during late convalescence. As a consequence, IgG antibody avidity assays gave better discrimination between acute-phase and late-convalescent-phase serum samples than IgM, IgA, or IgGAM assays. In two of these patients, sequential serum samples were also tested for IgG avidity against human CoV strains OC43 and 229E in parallel. While SARS CoV infections induced an anamnestic IgG antibody response to the 229E and OC43 viruses, these cross-reactive antibodies remained of high avidity from early (the first month) postinfection. The results showed that assays to detect low-avidity antibody may be useful for discriminating early from late antibody responses and also for distinguishing anamnestic cross-reactive antibody responses from primary specific responses. This may be useful in some clinical situations.","Chan, K H; Sonnenberg, K; Niedrig, M; Lam, S Y; Pang, C M; Chan, K M; Ma, S K; Seto, W H; Peiris, J S M",Clinical and vaccine immunology : CVI,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17881505/,11

There is a need to find the best method for drug delivery to reduce transmission, while keeping the risk of selection for drug-resistant viral variants low. Even when infection is prevented during pregnancy, the risk of acquiring infection by breast feeding remains significant and in some settings, is unavoidable. The ability of antiretroviral drugs or vaccines to limit transmission by breast milk is unknown. HIV vaccines are still in an early phase of development and have not yet been tested in newborns, in part due to concerns about potential of low immunogenicity due to transplacental transfer of maternal antibodies. Alternative strategies have been proposed to limit transmission using passive prophylaxis by human monoclonal antibody, but to insure product safety, trials have been slowed. Due to such concerns, animal models may provide an alternative for testing efficacy in human newborns. In this review, advances made using such models will be compared for mother-to-child transmission of lentivirus with that of HIV-1. In addition, some perspectives on integrating the data obtained from these models as a groundwork for future clinical work will be presented.","Jayaraman, Pushpa; Haigwood, Nancy L",Frontiers in bioscience : a journal and virtual library,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16720355/,11

METHODS The serum levels of IgM and IgG antibodies to N antigen were measured in 200 healthy blood donors and 13 SARS patients at different time points of acute and convalescent phases using indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with N fusion proteins of SARS-associated coronaviruses. RESULTS The IgM positive critical value of 0.233 and IgG of 0.239 were selected as the threshold value for positive results that equals the product of 2.1 and the mean IgM and IgG levels of 200 healthy blood donors. In 13 patients with SARS, the antibody responses to N antigen were not detectable in the first week after the onset of symptoms. The IgM and IgG seroprotection rates were 83.3% and 66.7% respectively in the second week, both reaching 100% at the third week. IgM seroprotection rates was 61.5% in the second month, and 38.5% at third month. The IgG peaked one month after the onset and remained at high levels in the following 2 months. CONCLUSION The antibody responses suggest that N protein of SARS is immunodominant and plays an important role in viral pathogenesis. This ELISA-based test for detecting anti- N antigen may be of significant value for SARS diagnosis.","Che, Xiao-yan; Hao, Wei; Qiu, Li-wen; Pan, Yu-xian; Liao, Zhi-yong; Xu, Hua; Chen, Jin-jun; Hou, Jin-lin; Woo, Patrick C Y; Lau, Susanna K P; Kwok, Yung Yuen; Huang, Zhen",Di 1 jun yi da xue xue bao = Academic journal of the first medical college of PLA,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12865207/,11

Methods Two male patients ages 57 and 64 years old were treated. Each met at least one of the following criteria: shortness of breath; respiratory rate (RR) ≥30 breaths/minute; finger pulse oxygen saturation (SpO2) ≤93% at rest; and oxygen index (P/F ratio: PaO2/FiO2 ≤300 mmHg). Each case excluded any combination with pneumothorax, pulmonary bullae or other absolute contraindications to HBO2. Patients were treated with 1.5 atmospheres absolute HBO2 with an oxygen concentration of more than 95% for 60 minutes per treatment, once a day for one week. Patients' self-reported symptoms, daily mean SpO2 (SO2), arterial blood gas analysis, D-dimer, lymphocyte, cholinesterase (che) and chest CT were conducted and measured. Results For both patients, dyspnea and shortness of breath were immediately alleviated after the first HBO2 treatment and remarkably relieved after seven days of HBO2 therapy. The RR also decreased daily. Neither patient became critically ill. The decreasing trend of SO2 and P/F ratio was immediately reversed and increased day by day. The lymphocyte count and ratio corresponding to immune function gradually recovered. D-dimer corresponding to peripheral circulation disorders and serum cholinesterase, reflecting liver function had improved. Follow-up chest CT showed that the pulmonary inflammation had clearly subsided. Conclusion Our preliminary uncontrolled case reports suggest that HBO2 therapy may promptly improve the progressive hypoxemia of patients with COVID-2019 pneumonia. However, the limited sample size and study design preclude a definitive statement about the potential effectiveness of HBO2 therapy to COVID-2019 pneumonia. It requires evaluation in randomized clinical trials in future.","Guo, Dazhi; Pan, Shuyi; Wang, MaoMao; Guo, Yufeng","Undersea & hyperbaric medicine : journal of the Undersea and Hyperbaric Medical Society, Inc",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32574433/,11

An emergency response vaccine is defined as a vaccine of public health importance that should be available to all people at risk against epidemic, pandemic or global threat situations. This review focuses on global threat vaccines, those that would be used in the case of an emerging pathogen or the intentional release of an agent to which there is a low level of population immunity. The development and use of such vaccines requires attention to simultaneous actions on seven fronts: development, forecasting, supply sources, regulation, procurement, financing and allocation. Neglect of any one of these aspects will threaten the success of the project. A case study on smallpox vaccines illustrates this. Although many public health experts fear that attention to stockpiling emergency response vaccines could draw resources from other areas, some aspects of such an effort could positively impact the supply of other needed vaccines.","Milstien, Julie",Expert opinion on biological therapy,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14519076/,11

From July 2004 until June 2008 it was administered in a three-dose schedule to over a million individuals, aged six weeks to 20 years, to provide protection against the epidemic strain of group B Meningococci. The cost of the campaign, including the development of the vaccine was substantial, in excess of $200M, but it contributed to a reduced incidence of meningococcal infections along with a reduction in morbidity and mortality. The campaign led to the development of a national immunisation register (NIR), which is still in existence today. As well as considering the legacies of the MeNZB vaccination programme, this paper examines whether there are any lessons to be learned, specifically concerning active vaccine safety monitoring, which may be important if, and when, a COVID-19 vaccine is developed and a national immunisation campaign instituted.","Reid, James Stewart",The New Zealand medical journal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33223554/,11

Pretreatment of MDCK I (Madin Darby canine kidney) cells with neuraminidase or acetylesterase rendered the cells resistant to infection by BCV. The receptors on a human (CaCo-2) and a porcine (LLC-PK1) epithelial cell line were also found to be sensitive to neuraminidase treatment. The susceptibility to infection by BCV was restored after resialylation of asialo-MDCK I cells with Neu5,9Ac2. Transfer of sialic acid lacking a 9-O-acetyl group was ineffective in this respect. These results demonstrate that 9-O-acetylated sialic acid is used as a receptor determinant by BCV to infect cultured cells. The possibility is discussed that the initiation of a BCV infection involves the recognition of different types of receptors, a first receptor for primary attachment and a second receptor to mediate the fusion between the viral envelope and the cellular membrane.","Schultze, B; Herrler, G",The Journal of general virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1321878/,11

Patients with comorbidities (obesity, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes mellitus) are particularly at risk of a more severe course of infection. We present a 33-year old lean patient with a medical history of ulcerative colitis on immunosuppressive treatment with Azathioprine, after unsuccessful in vitro fertilization one week before the onset of symptoms, admitted to hospital for two-week-long cough with sore throat with fever ap to 40°C. CT confirmed bilateral bronchopneumonia without etiological detection of the infectious agent. Three PCR tests (two of nasopharyngeal swabs and one of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL)) were negative for COVID-19, including antigen and antibody tests. Complex parenteral ATB treatment with high-flow nasal oxygen therapy was ineffective, and artificial lung ventilation was indicated for acute respiratory failure. After 4 days antifungal treatment of Fluconazole, condition of patient progressed to hepatic and multiorgan failure and the patient died on day 14 of hospitalization. Post-mortem histological examination revealed the presence of coronavirus in the cells of lung parenchyma. The case recalls that even young patients with immunosuppressive treatment are at risk for the critical course of COVID-19 disease. The negativity of the tests was due to the capture of the patient only after the second week of infection, at the time of the diagnostic window between the positive PCR test and the formation of antibodies. The persistent effect of immunosuppression was most likely the reason for the lack of antibody response.","Faktorová, Xénia; Horniaková, Lucia; Sedlačko, Jozef; Havranová, Alena; Martanovič, Peter; Malíková, Petra; Jakabovičová, Martina; Urkovičová, Zuzana; Szántová, Mária",Vnitrni lekarstvi,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33752392/,11

192466,High-frequency leader sequence switching during coronavirus defective interfering RNA replication.,1989,"INTRODUCTION Otitis media is a frequent complication of a viral upper respiratory tract infection, and the reported co-incidence of those diseases increases with assay sensitivity and sampling density. We determined the incidence of otitis-media complications in young children when referenced to cold-like illnesses and to concurrent virus recovery from the nasopharynx. METHODS A total of 60 children from 24 families were followed from October 2003 through April 30, 2004, by daily parental recording of illness signs, weekly pneumatic otoscopic examinations, and periodic polymerase chain reaction assay of collected nasal fluids for common viruses. RESULTS One hundred ninety-nine cold-like illnesses were observed, but a sample for virus assay was not collected concurrent with 71 episodes. Of the remainder, 73% of cold-like illnesses were temporally related to recovery of 1 or a combination of the assayed viruses, with rhinovirus predominating. For non-cold-like illness periods, 54 (18%) of 297 assays were positive for virus, and the virus frequency distribution was similar to that for cold-like illnesses. There were 93 diagnosed otitis-media episodes; 65 (70%) of these occurred during a cold-like illness. For the 79 otitis-media episodes with available nasal samples, 61 (77%) were associated with a positive virus result. In this population, the otitis-media complication rate for a cold-like illness was 33%. CONCLUSIONS A cold-like illness was not a prerequisite for polymerase chain reaction detection of viruses in the nose and nasopharynx of young children. Viral detection by polymerase chain reaction in the absence of a cold-like illness is associated with complications in some subjects. Otitis media is a complication of viral infection both with and without concurrent cold-like illnesses, thus downwardly biasing coincidence estimates that use cold-based illnesses as the denominator.","Winther, Birgit; Alper, Cuneyt M; Mandel, Ellen M; Doyle, William J; Hendley, J Owen",Pediatrics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17545372/,11

METHODS The sacral vertebrae were isolated in 9 unembalmed female cadavers, and segments of polypropylene mesh were attached to the sacrum using stitches at either the S1 or S2 level. The free end of the mesh was pulled at a constant rate. Maximum tension prior to system failure was recorded for each specimen. Suture pullout strengths between the two groups were compared using the two-sample Wilcoxon rank-sum test. RESULTS In all but one specimen, failure of the system occurred at the point of suture attachment to the anterior longitudinal ligament. Among the nine specimens, median pullout strengths were 7.49 lb (interquartile range 7.95) at S1 and 3.15 lb (interquartile range 2.975) at S2 (p = 0.028). CONCLUSION The pullout strength of sutures used to attach the sacrocolpopexy mesh to the sacrum is significantly higher at the S1 level than at the S2 level.","Shippey, Stuart; Sutter, Edward; Belkoff, Stephen M; Gutman, Robert; Chen, Chi Chiung Grace",Gynecologic and obstetric investigation,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22759390/,11

METHODS Using a cross-sectional survey, EMTs in Toronto, Ont., were surveyed 1 year after the SARS outbreak during mandatory training on the use of personal protective equipment in airway management during the outbreak and just before taking the survey. Practices that were addressed reflected government directives on the use of this equipment. Main outcome measures included the frequency of personal protective equipment use and, as applicable, why particular items were not always used. RESULTS The response rate was 67.3% (n = 230). During the SARS outbreak, an N95-type particulate respirator was reported to be always used by 91.5% of respondents. Conversely, 72.9% of the respondents reported that they never used the open face hood. Equipment availability and vision impairment were often cited as impediments to personal protective equipment use. In nonoutbreak conditions, only the antimicrobial airway filter was most often reported to be always used (52.0%), while other items were used at an intermediate frequency. The most common reason for not always donning equipment was that paramedics deemed it unnecessary for the situation. CONCLUSION Personal protective equipment is not consistently employed as per medical directives. Reasons given for nonuse included nonavailability, judgment of nonnecessity or technical difficulties. There are important public health implications of noncompliance.","Visentin, Laura M; Bondy, Susan J; Schwartz, Brian; Morrison, Laurie J",CJEM,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19166639/,11

An important part to prioritize within Urologyis Urolithiasis. The objective of this article is to establish strategies and recommendations for the treatment and follow-up in COVID-19 pandemic in phases I, II and III, based on available scientific evidence and the consensus of a group of experts in these pathologies. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The document is based on the evidence available in the literature so far on SARSCoV-2 and the experience of the authors in the management of COVID-19 in their institutions. A narrative review of the literature was conducted, and a modified nominal group technique was used due to the extraordinary restrictions of assembly and mobility during the pandemic. RESULTS: Recommendations are made regarding the epidemiological evaluation of patients before surgery ,the management of positive patients, the epidemiological measures for healthcare personnel, the management of renal colic, the type of anesthesia, endourological surgery, shockwave lithotripsy, hospitalization, clinicalt ests, out-patient service and priorities on the surgical waiting list. CONCLUSION: Treatment of Urolithiasis in COVID-19 pandemic calls for prioritization of patients, maximum efficiency in treatments, adequate protection of healthcare personnel, and the implementation of telemedicine as a measure to reduce patient attendance to the hospital.","Cepeda, Marcos; Budía, Alberto; Pérez-Fentes, Daniel; Cansino, Ramón; Galán, Juan Antonio; Angerri, Oriol; Torrecilla, Carlos",Archivos espanoles de urologia,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32538815/,11
193303,Internal ribosome entry in the coding region of murine hepatitis virus mRNA 5.,1994,"BACKGROUND COVID-19, caused by SARS CoV-2, is an acute respiratory viral illness. We present the experience of treating patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in a Role 3 hospital in an active warzone. METHODS This is a retrospective care series of patients treated for COVID-19 at Craig Joint Theater Hospital, Bagram, Afghanistan from May to August 2020. Data extracted included demographics, admission and disposition information, past medical history, comorbidities, Transportation Command (TRANSCOM) severity classification (i.e. Category A, Category B), and treatments received. RESULTS This series included 15 Category A and 55 Category B patients. Most patients were non-US contractors with one chronic condition. Most patients received medical treatments in accordance with Department of Defense Practice Management Guidelines. For Category A patients, mechanical ventilation use declined from a mean average of 10.67 days to 2.83 days following the introduction of high-flow nasal cannula. Average hospital length of stay was 6 days (range 2-23). One death occurred in a patient greater than 60 years old with three known prior medical conditions. Most patients were discharged to a non-medical isolation facility. Aeromedically evacuated patients were mostly US military and US contractors. CONCLUSION We faced several challenges including retrofitting a Role 3 facility designed for trauma care for management of a highly contagious respiratory viral illness. Logistics constraints impacted timely delivery of medical therapies and equipment and decreased efficiency of aeromedical evacuation. Despite these challenges and the simultaneous trauma mission, most patients received medical care in accordance with treatment guidelines with a low mortality rate.","Banares, Katherine; Surry, Luke; Rand, Jamie; Stuever, Mary; Bishop, Shawn; Chicoine, Erin; Liane, Billy-Joe",Medical journal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33666906/,11
193317,Genesis of Sindbis virus by in vivo recombination of nonreplicative RNA precursors.,1995,"Treatment of calvarial defects has remained a challenge in reconstruction surgery, especially because of infection at these sites. We produced a bactericidal biomaterial for treating infected bone defects by using calcium phosphate bone cement mixed with antibiotics. We evaluated the usefulness of this material mixed with the antibiotic vancomycin in a cranium-infected rat model. The concentration of vancomycin used was 5.0 wt%, as reported in our previous study. In order to establish the rat model, a cranium defect (diameter, 5 mm) was made that was infected with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Thirty-six rats were divided into 6 groups depending on whether an autologous graft or bone cement with or without antibiotic was used for the defect. After 1 and 4 weeks, abscess formation was checked, tissue bacterial counts were determined, and pathological examination was performed. At both 1 and 4 weeks, no MRSA was detected on tissue bacterial culture or pathological examination in groups that received bone cement with antibiotics. In groups that received bone cement without antibiotic, MRSA was detected, and the bone cement had compromised and disintegrated into several slices. In conclusion, bone cement that contains antibiotics appears to be effective not only for reconstruction in cases of cranial defect, but also in terms of preventing infection.","Sakamoto, Yoshiaki; Ochiai, Hiroko; Ohsugi, Ikuko; Inoue, Yoshikazu; Yoshimura, Yoko; Kishi, Kazuo",Neurologia medico-chirurgica,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24670313/,11
193393,Identification of a domain required for autoproteolytic cleavage of murine coronavirus gene A polyprotein.,1989,"Bats (order Chiroptera, suborders Megachiroptera [""flying foxes""] and Microchiroptera) are abundant, diverse, and geographically widespread. These mammals provide us with resources, but their importance is minimized and many of their populations and species are at risk, even threatened or endangered. Some of their characteristics (food choices, colonial or solitary nature, population structure, ability to fly, seasonal migration and daily movement patterns, torpor and hibernation, life span, roosting behaviors, ability to echolocate, virus susceptibility) make them exquisitely suitable hosts of viruses and other disease agents. Bats of certain species are well recognized as being capable of transmitting rabies virus, but recent observations of outbreaks and epidemics of newly recognized human and livestock diseases caused by viruses transmitted by various megachiropteran and microchiropteran bats have drawn attention anew to these remarkable mammals. This paper summarizes information regarding chiropteran characteristics and information regarding 66 viruses that have been isolated from bats. From these summaries, it is clear that we do not know enough about bat biology; we are doing too little in terms of bat conservation; and there remain a multitude of questions regarding the role of bats in disease emergence.","Calisher, Charles H; Childs, James E; Field, Hume E; Holmes, Kathryn V; Schountz, Tony",Clinical microbiology reviews,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16847084/,11

193850,Identification of mouse hepatitis virus papain-like proteinase 2 activity.,2000,"PURPOSE The authors analyzed online consumer health information related to screening tests to see how well this information meets known standards for supporting the understanding of test uncertainty. SETTING/SUBJECTS MedlinePlus documents regarding maternal serum screening (6), prostate-specific antigen testing (6), and screening mammography (6) were analyzed. METHODOLOGY The content of the documents was analyzed. RESULTS This study showed that most sites conscientiously report that tests are less than 100% accurate, but few provide important details about the level of uncertainty associated with test results. In particular, few resources give information about the predictive value of screening tests and have little mention of the fact that predictive value is influenced by the a priori likelihood of having the condition. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION These results suggest that online consumer health information does not adequately support decisions about medical screening. We suggest a potential solution to the problem: metadata harvesting coupled with optimized presentation techniques to format personalized information about screening tests. Using these techniques, the empowerment of personal choice in matters of health decisions could become the de facto standard.","Burkell, Jacquelyn; Campbell, D Grant",Journal of the Medical Library Association : JMLA,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16059426/,11

We identified eight human MAbs binding to virus and infected cells, six of which could be mapped to two SARS-CoV structural proteins: the nucleocapsid (N) and spike (S) proteins. Two MAbs reacted with N protein. One of the N protein MAbs recognized a linear epitope conserved between all published human and animal SARS-CoV isolates, and the other bound to a nonlinear N epitope. These two N MAbs did not compete for binding to SARS-CoV. Four MAbs reacted with the S glycoprotein, and three of these MAbs neutralized SARS-CoV in vitro. All three neutralizing anti-S MAbs bound a recombinant S1 fragment comprising residues 318 to 510, a region previously identified as the SARS-CoV S receptor binding domain; the nonneutralizing MAb did not. Two strongly neutralizing anti-S1 MAbs blocked the binding of a recombinant S fragment (residues 1 to 565) to SARS-CoV-susceptible Vero cells completely, whereas a poorly neutralizing S1 MAb blocked binding only partially. The MAb ability to block S1-receptor binding and the level of neutralization of the two strongly neutralizing S1 MAbs correlated with the binding affinity to the S1 domain. Finally, epitope mapping, using recombinant S fragments (residues 318 to 510) containing naturally occurring mutations, revealed the importance of residue N479 for the binding of the most potent neutralizing MAb, CR3014. The complete set of SARS-CoV MAbs described here may be useful for diagnosis, chemoprophylaxis, and therapy of SARS-CoV infection and disease.","van den Brink, Edward N; Ter Meulen, Jan; Cox, Freek; Jongeneelen, Mandy A C; Thijsse, Alexandra; Throsby, Mark; Marissen, Wilfred E; Rood, Pauline M L; Bakker, Alexander B H; Gelderblom, Hans R; Martina, Byron E; Osterhaus, Albert D M E; Preiser, Wolfgang; Doerr, Hans Wilhelm; de Kruif, John; Goudsmit, Jaap",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15650189/,11

Forceps were designed with end that were the same size and shape as conventional 5-mm forceps, except that the diameter of the shaft was decreased to 2.4 mm. Endo Relief forceps were used for thoracoscopic surgery in 18 patients. We retrospectively compared the frequency of grasping error between conventional small-diameter forceps and Endo Relief group. The mean surgical time was 57.5 minutes (range, 45-75 minutes). There were no complications, no recurrences of pneumothorax and lung cancer, and no deaths after surgery. There were no intraoperative complications and no need for a second surgery to open additional ports. The frequency of grasping error was significantly lower in the Endo Relief group compared to the conventional small-diameter forceps group (0.17 ± 0.23 vs 1.33 ± 0.22; P = 0.022). Our experience thus far indicates that this technique has cosmetic benefit and is as effective as the classic 3-port technique for experienced thoracoscopic surgeons.

194235,Localization of mouse hepatitis virus open reading frame 1A derived proteins.,1998,"Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a common winter time respiratory virus that affects persons of all ages and is the major cause of serious lower respiratory tract infections in young children. However, RSV is also an important pathogen in adults, particularly in the elderly, patients with chronic lung disease, or those with impaired immunity. Clinical features of RSV infections overlap with other respiratory viruses, so laboratory tests are required to establish the diagnosis. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of samples from nasal swabs, sputum, or bronchoalveolar lavage is a sensitive test to substantiate the diagnosis. Serologies are useful in epidemiological surveys. The clinical course of RSV infections is variable. In infants, RSV presents as bronchiolitis. In adults, mild to moderate upper respiratory tract illness is characteristic. However, severe pneumonia can occur, particularly in the elderly with comorbidities or compromised immune status. Humoral antibodies confer partial immunity to RSV infection and disease severity; cellular immunity is important to eradicate RSV in established infections. Treatment of RSV infections is often supportive. Aerosolized ribavirin is approved for RSV infections in infants; its role in adults is controversial. Infection control measures are critical to limit spread of RSV. Currently, RSV vaccines are not available, but candidate vaccines are being developed.","Falsey, Ann R",Seminars in respiratory and critical care medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17458771/,11

Indeed, although the use of RT-PCR remains the keystone of the diagnosis, the delay in diagnosis as well as the overload of the microbiological platforms have led us to make almost systematic the use of thoracic imaging for taking in charge of patients. In this context, thoracic imaging has shown a major interest in diagnostic aid in order to better guide the management of patients admitted to hospital. The most common signs encountered are particularly well described in thoracic computed tomography. Typical imaging combines bilateral, predominantly peripheral and posterior, multi-lobar, ground glass opacities. Of note, it is common to identify significant lesions in asymptomatic patients, with imaging sometimes preceding the onset of symptoms. Beyond conventional chest imaging, many teams have developed new artificial intelligence tools to better help clinicians in decision-making.","Guiot, J; Danthine, D; Deprez, L; Louis, R; Lovinfosse, P; Meunier, P",Revue medicale de Liege,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33211427/,11

The SprayShield™ Adhesion Barrier System (Covidien, Waltham, MA) is a next-generation sprayable adhesion barrier to prevent postoperative adhesions. Initially sprayed as a liquid, SprayShield™ solidifies within 2 seconds of contact with tissue through a polyethylene glycol (PEG) ester-Trilysine reaction to form an adherent, internal tissue barrier that protects the underlying tissues for several days after surgery. After tissue begins to heal, the adhesion barrier liquefies via hydrolysis and completely absorbs within 7 days. Safety testing has shown the product to be nongenotoxic, noncytotoxic, nonsensitizing, and nonirritating. SprayShield™ has been shown to adhere well to tissue, with the mechanism of adherence believed to be mainly due to tissue surface mechanical interlocking. In studies that compared SprayShield™ to good surgical technique, virgin hogs were randomized to receive SprayShield™ or good surgical technique (Control). Compared to Controls, SprayShield™ demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in the number of adhesions (46%, p=0.04) and in the area of adhesions (83%, p=0.012) to injured sites. With its ease of application, biocompatibility and adhesion prevention efficacy, SprayShield™ may be an effective next-generation adhesion prevention product for open and laparoscopic abdominopelvic procedures as an adjunct to good surgical technique.","Ferland, Roger; Campbell, Patrick K",Surgical technology international,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19579201/,11
194607,Persistent infection of cultured cells with mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) results from the epigenetic expression of the MHV receptor.,1995,"Previous studies suggested that coronavirus RNA transcription involves interaction between leader RNA and the intergenic (IG) sequences, probably via protein-RNA interactions (X. M. Zhang, C.-L. Liao, and M. M. C. Lai, J. Virol., 68:4738-4746, 1994; X. M. Zhang and M. M. C. Lai, J. Virol., 68:6626-6633, 1994). To determine whether cellular proteins are involved in this process, we performed UV cross-linking experiments using cytoplasmic extracts of uninfected cells and the IG (promoter) sequence between genes 6 and 7 (IG7) and the 5' untranslational region of mouse hepatitis virus genomic RNA. We demonstrated that three different cellular proteins (p70, p48, and p35/38) bound to the promoter sequence of the template RNA. Deletion analyses of the template RNA mapped the binding site of p35/38 at the consensus transcription initiation signal. In contrast, the binding of p70 and p48 was less specific. p35/38 is the same protein as the one previously identified to bind to the complementary strand of the leader RNA; its binding affinity to the leader was approximately 15 times stronger than that to IG7. Site-directed mutagenesis of the IG sequence revealed that mutations in the consensus sequence of IG7 (UCUAAUCUAAAC to UCGAAAC and GCUAAAG), which resulted in reduced subgenomic mRNA transcription, also caused correspondingly reduced levels of p35/38 binding. These results demonstrated that the extent of protein binding to the IG sequences correlated with the amounts of subgenomic mRNAs transcribed from the IG site. These studies suggest that these RNA-binding proteins are involved in coronavirus RNA transcription and may represent transcription factors.","Zhang, X; Lai, M M",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7853499/,11

Seven days after admission, he became deteriorated with significant reduction of oxygen saturation and his coagulation parameter levels were increased with highly suspicion of pulmonary embolism. He was treated with azithromycin, isoprinosine, lopinavir, and fondaparinux with thromboprophylaxis dosage since admission. The role of increased fondaparinux dosage at the time of clinical deterioration was then followed by clinical improvement and reduced D-dimer level. Anticoagulant therapy, mainly with fondaparinux, showed a better prognosis in patients with markedly elevated D-Dimer. Fondaparinux needs to be monitored appropriately to prevent bleeding and adverse. The patient was discharged from the hospital in an improved condition and normal D-Dimer levels.

194960,Sequence determination of the nucleocapsid protein gene of the porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus confirms that this virus is a coronavirus related to human coronavirus 229E and porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus.,1993,"We have cloned and characterized a human brain cDNA encoding a new metalloprotease that has been called aminopeptidase O (AP-O). AP-O exhibits a series of structural features characteristic of aminopeptidases, including a conserved catalytic domain with a zinc-binding site (HEXXHX18E) that allows its classification in the M1 family of metallopeptidases or gluzincins. The structural complexity of AP-O is further increased by the presence of an additional C-terminal domain 170 residues long, which is predicted to have an ARM repeat fold originally identified in the Drosophila segment polarity gene product Armadillo. This ARM repeat domain is also present in aminopeptidase B, aminopeptidase B-like, and leukotriene A4 hydrolase and defines a novel subfamily of aminopeptidases that we have called ARM aminopeptidases. Northern blot analysis revealed that AP-O is mainly expressed in the pancreas, placenta, liver, testis, and heart. Human AP-O was produced in Escherichia coli, and the purified recombinant protein hydrolyzed synthetic substrates used for assaying aminopeptidase activity. This activity was abolished by general inhibitors of metalloproteases and specific inhibitors of aminopeptidases. Recombinant AP-O also cleaved angiotensin III to generate angiotensin IV, a bioactive peptide of the renin-angiotensin pathway with multiple actions on diverse tissues, including brain, testis, and heart. On the basis of these results we suggest that AP-O could play a role in the proteolytic processing of bioactive peptides in those tissues where it is expressed.","Díaz-Perales, Araceli; Quesada, Víctor; Sánchez, Luis M; Ugalde, Alejandro P; Suárez, María F; Fueyo, Antonio; López-Otín, Carlos",The Journal of biological chemistry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15687497/,11

We compared the species specificity of HCV-229E infection with the species specificity of virus binding using immunofluorescence, assay of virus yields, fluorescence activated cell sorting and a monoclonal antibody directed against hAPN that blocks infection. We found that HCV-229E binds to intestinal brush border membranes (BBM) and to membranes of cell lines from cats, dogs, pigs, and humans, however the virus only infects two of these species. HCV-229E will not bind to BBM or to membranes from cell lines derived from hamster or mice. Animal coronaviruses related to HCV-229E, including FIPV, CCV, and TGEV bind to cell membranes from cats, dogs, cows, pigs and humans (but not mice), while each virus infects cells from only a subset of these species.

These data suggest that the species-specificity of infection for this serogroup of coronaviruses is determined at the levels of virus binding and penetration. Since binding of viral spike glycoprotein to cellular receptors is not the only limiting factor, we suggest that one or more steps associated with virus penetration may determine the species specificity of infection with the HCV-229E serogroup of coronaviruses.","Levis, R; Cardellichio, C B; Scanga, C A; Compton, S R; Holmes, K V",Advances in experimental medicine and biology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8830504/,11
195259,Effect of mutations in the mouse hepatitis virus 3'(+)42 protein binding element on RNA replication.,2005,"The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) has (as of Oct. 14, 2020) infected approximately 38 million people worldwide. The most feared sequelae of COVID-19 in adults are severe, often fatal, lung disease, venous thromboembolic disease, cerebrovascular disease, and multiple organ system failure. Fortunately, unlike adults, most children who contract COVID-19 have a mild respiratory illness or asymptomatic. It is now evident that a small percentage of children develop a critical and novel illness with persistent fever , prominent GI symptoms , single or multi-organ dysfunction including shock and laboratory evidence of profound inflammation which has been termed multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) by the CDC. Some of the reported cases share features with well-known inflammatory syndromes such as Kawasaki disease, macrophage activation syndrome/hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis and toxic shock syndrome. The temporal relationship of MIS-C and COVID-19 suggests a post-infectious immune dysregulation. Patients with MIS-C, especially those with cardiac dysfunction and/or shock, should preferably be managed in pediatric intensive care. We will discuss the epidemiology of MIS-C, similarities with known inflammatory syndromes in children, clinical presentation, and present management options.","Dasgupta, Kingshuk; De, Pradip; Finch, Sudhir Eugene",South Dakota medicine : the journal of the South Dakota State Medical Association,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33684269/,11

Surgical biopsy is more difficult for these lesions because intraoperative localization has to be made without the aid of direct visualization or manual palpation. Electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy can be used in the operating room to identify a small peripheral lesion and marked using an injection of methylene blue, which can be seen on the visceral pleura of the lung. We present our initial experience using this technique. The sample was eight patients who had peripheral lesions with an average size of 19 mm. Surgical wedge biopsy was diagnostic in all cases, with an average procedure time of 28 minutes. There were no complications from this procedure. In conclusion, these data suggest that electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy can be performed safely with high diagnostic accuracy by the operating thoracic surgeon, but further data are needed to establish its utility and safety.","Brown, Jordan; Lee, Thomas J; Joiner, Theresa; Wrightson, William",The American surgeon,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28206930/,11

We sought to determine the efficacy of a standardized preparation of E purpurea in reducing symptom severity and duration of the common cold. METHODS A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled design was used. Patients received either 100 mg of E purpurea (freeze-dried pressed juice from the aerial portion of the plant) or a lactose placebo 3 times daily until cold symptoms were relieved or until the end of 14 days, whichever came first. Symptoms (sneezing, nasal discharge, nasal congestion, headache, sore or scratchy throat, hoarseness, muscle aches, and cough) were scored subjectively by the patient and recorded daily in a diary. Kaplan-Meier curves were used to estimate the survival function of time to resolution in each group. The Wilcoxon rank sum test was used to compare time to resolution between the 2 groups. RESULTS One hundred twenty-eight patients were enrolled within 24 hours of cold symptom onset. Group demographic distribution was comparable for sex, age, time from symptom onset to enrollment in the study, average number of colds per year, and smoking history. No statistically significant difference was observed between treatment groups for either total symptom scores (P range,.29-.90) or mean individual symptom scores (P range,.09-.93). The time to resolution of symptoms was not statistically different (P =.73). CONCLUSIONS Some studies have concluded that Echinacea effectively reduces the symptoms and duration of the common cold. We were unable to replicate such findings. Further studies using different preparations and dosages of E purpurea are necessary to validate previous claims.","Yale, Steven H; Liu, Kejian",Archives of internal medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15197051/,11

195650,Sequence and translation of the murine coronavirus 5'-end genomic RNA reveals the N-terminal structure of the putative RNA polymerase.,1987,"To examine the prerequisites for cleavage activation of the hemagglutinin of human influenza viruses, a cDNA clone obtained from strain A/Port Chalmers/1/73 (serotype H3) was subjected to site-directed mutagenesis and expressed in CV-1 cells by using a simian virus 40 vector. The number of basic residues at the cleavage site, which consists of a single arginine with wild-type hemagglutinin, was increased by inserting two, three, or four additional arginines. Like wild-type hemagglutinin, mutants with up to three additional arginines were not cleaved in CV-1 cells, but insertion of four arginines resulted in activation. When the oligosaccharide at asparagine 22 of the HA1 subunit of the hemagglutinin was removed by site-directed mutagenesis of the respective glycosylation site, only three inserted arginines were required to obtain cleavage. Mutants containing a series of four basic residues were also generated by substituting arginine for uncharged amino acids immediately preceding the cleavage site. The observation that these mutants were not cleaved, even when the carbohydrate at asparagine 22 of HA1 was absent, underscores the fact that the basic peptide had to be generated by insertion to obtain cleavage. The data show that the hemagglutinin of a human influenza virus can acquire high cleavability, a property known to be an important determinant for the pathogenicity of avian influenza viruses. Factors important for cleavability are the number of basic residues at the cleavage site, the oligosaccharide at asparagine 22, and the length of the carboxy terminus of HA1.","Ohuchi, R; Ohuchi, M; Garten, W; Klenk, H D",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2041080/,11

Both RCVs were replicated in LBC and RCN-9 cells, but not in the others. The infectivity titers of both RCVs grown in RCN-9 cells were significantly higher than those in LBC cells in every passage (2.5-3.9 log rate). Both RCVs replicated in LBC cells showed higher tropism to RCN-9 cells than to LBC cells, suggesting that RCN-9 cells are more suitable for the replication of RCVs than LBC cells.

195933,Identification of a new transcriptional initiation site and the corresponding functional gene 2b in the murine coronavirus RNA genome.,1989,"Every recent presidential administration has faced an infectious disease threat, and this trend is certain to continue. The states have primary responsibility for protecting the public's health under their police powers, but modern travel makes diseases almost impossible to contain intrastate. How should the federal government respond in the future? The Ebola scare in the U.S. repeated a typical response--demands for quarantine. In January 2017, the Department of Health and Human Services and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued final regulations on its authority to issue Federal Quarantine Orders. These regulations rely heavily on confining persons who may or may not be ill, raising serious questions about federal commitment to due process protections as well as the scope of statutory authority to impose quarantine. As the Supreme Court has stated in United States v. Salerno, ""liberty is the norm, and detention prior to trial or without trial is the carefully limited exception."" Unconstrained use of quarantines undermines both the rule of law and public confidence in government decisions in times of crisis. This article analyzes the regulations and argues for a rights-based approach to infectious disease control that also protects public health. By respecting constitutional rights, the federal government can encourage public trust and cooperation and minimize harm, both essential requirements for controlling an epidemic.","Ulrich, Michael R; Mariner, Wendy K",SMU law review : a publication of Southern Methodist University School of Law,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30028114/,11
196052,In situ hybridization for the detection and localization of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus in the intestinal tissues from naturally infected piglets.,2000,"BACKGROUND Many factors have been identified which can predict severe outcomes and mortality in hospitalized patients of COVID-19. This study was conducted with the objective of finding out the association of various clinical and laboratory parameters as used by International Severe Acute Respiratory and emerging Infections Consortium (ISARIC) World Health Organization (WHO)- ISARIC/WHO 4C Mortality score in predicting high risk patients of COVID-19. Ascertaining the parameters would help in triage of patients of severe disease at the outset, and shall prove beneficial in improving the standard of care. METHODS This cross-sectional study was carried out in COVID-19 Department of Ayub Teaching Hospital, Abbottabad. All COVID-19 patients admitted from 15th April to 15th July 2020 were included. RESULTS A total of 347 patients were included in the study. The mean age was 56.46±15.44 years. Male patients were 225 (65%) and female 122 (35%). Diabetes (36%) was the most common co-morbidity, followed by hypertension (30.8%). Two hundred & six (63.8%) patients recovered and 117 (36.2%) patients died. Shortness of breath (80%), fever (79%) and cough (65%) were the most common presenting symptoms. Patients admitted with a 4C Mortality score of 0-3 (Low Risk Category), the patients who recovered were 36 (90%) and those who died were 4 (10.0%). In patients admitted with a 4C Mortality score of more than 14 (Very High-Risk Category), the number of patients who recovered was 1 (20%), and those who died were 4 (80%). The difference in mortality among the categories was statistically significant (p<0.001). Hypertension was a risk factor for death in patients of COVID-19 (Odds ratio=1.24, 95% CI [0.76-2.01]). Lymphopenia was not associated with statistically significant increased risk for mortality. CONCLUSIONS The ISARIC 4C mortality score can be used for stratifying and predicting mortality in COVID-19 patients on arrival in hospital. We propose that it should be used in every patient of COVID-19 presenting to the hospital. Those falling in Low and Intermediate Risk Category should be managed in ward level. Those falling in High and Very High Category should be admitted in HDU/ICU with aggressive treatment from the start.","Ali, Rashid; Qayyum, Fatima; Ahmed, Nasir; Haroon, Muhammad Zeeshan; Irshad, Romana; Sajjad, Sabeen; Malik, Sidra Qayyum; Saleem, Sania; Hussain, Rizwana; Zahid, Ayesha; Farooq, Umer","Journal of Ayub Medical College, Abbottabad : JAMC",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33774948/,11

It was hypothesized that the initial virus and provirus load could significantly influence the course of retrovirus infection. To determine the role of provirus loads, two methods of PCR, a nested PCR and a fluorogenic probe-based (TaqMan) real-time quantitative PCR, which were specific to the U3 region of FeLV-A were established. FeLV provirus in naturally and experimentally infected cats was then measured. Only 3 weeks after experimental FeLV-A infection, persistently infected cats demonstrated higher provirus loads and lower humoral immune responses than cats that had overcome antigenaemia. Lower initial provirus loads were associated with successful humoral immune responses. Unexpectedly, provirus in the buffy-coat cells of two cats that tested negative for the p27 antigen (a marker for viraemia) was also detected. In 597 Swiss cats, comparison of p27 antigen levels with PCR results revealed broad agreement. However, similar to the experimental situation, a significant number of animals (10%) was negative for the p27 antigen and FeLV-positive by PCR. These cats had a mean provirus load 300-fold lower than that of animals testing positive for the p27 antigen. In conclusion, an association between the provirus load and the outcome of FeLV infection was found. Detection of provirus carriers should contribute to further the control of FeLV. In addition, quantification of provirus loads will lead to a better understanding of FeLV pathogenesis and anti-retrovirus protective mechanisms.","Hofmann-Lehmann, R; Huder, J B; Gruber, S; Boretti, F; Sigrist, B; Lutz, H",The Journal of general virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11413369/,11

The effect was maximal at 1 week after infection, and thymuses returned to normal size by 2 weeks after infection. There was no effect of glucocorticoids, since thymus atrophy was also found in adrenalectomized, infected mice. In infected thymus, immature CD4+ CD8+ lymphocytes were selectively depleted, and apoptosis of lymphocytes was increased. The MHV receptor glycoprotein MHVR was detected on thymus epithelial cells but not on T lymphocytes. In a small number of stromal epithelial cells, but in very few lymphocytes, the viral genome was detectable by in situ hybridization. These observations suggested that MHV-A59-induced thymic atrophy results not from a generalized lytic infection of T lymphocytes but rather from apoptosis of immature double-positive T cells that might be caused by infection of a small proportion of thymus epithelial cells or from inappropriate secretion of some factor, such as a cytokine.","Godfraind, C; Holmes, K V; Coutelier, J P",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7666556/,11

Treatments for H5N1 influenza are unsatisfactory, and convalescent human plasma containing H5N1 antibodies could be an effective therapy during outbreaks and pandemics. PURPOSE To determine whether transfusion with influenza-convalescent human blood products reduced the risk for death in patients with Spanish influenza pneumonia. DATA SOURCES Manual search of English-language journals from 1918 to 1925. Citations from retrieved studies were also searched. STUDY SELECTION Published English-language studies that had at least 10 patients in the treatment group, used convalescent blood products to treat Spanish influenza pneumonia in a hospital setting, and reported on a control or comparison group. DATA EXTRACTION Two investigators independently extracted data on study characteristics, outcomes, adverse events, and quality. DATA SYNTHESIS Eight relevant studies involving 1703 patients were found. Treated patients, who were often selected because of more severe illness, were compared with untreated controls with influenza pneumonia in the same hospital or ward. The overall crude case-fatality rate was 16% (54 of 336) among treated patients and 37% (452 of 1219) among controls. The range of absolute risk differences in mortality between the treatment and control groups was 8% to 26% (pooled risk difference, 21% [95% CI, 15% to 27%]). The overall crude case-fatality rate was 19% (28 of 148) among patients who received early treatment (after <4 days of pneumonia complications) and 59% (49 of 83) among patients who received late treatment (after > or =4 days of pneumonia complications). The range of absolute risk differences in mortality between the early treatment group and the late treatment group was 26% to 50% (pooled risk difference, 41% [CI, 29% to 54%]). Adverse effects included chill reactions and possible exacerbations of symptoms in a few patients. LIMITATIONS Studies were few and had many methodologic limitations. No study was a blinded, randomized, or placebo-controlled trial. Some pertinent studies may have been missed. CONCLUSIONS Patients with Spanish influenza pneumonia who received influenza-convalescent human blood products may have experienced a clinically important reduction in the risk for death. Convalescent human H5N1 plasma could be an effective, timely, and widely available treatment that should be studied in clinical trials.","Luke, Thomas C; Kilbane, Edward M; Jackson, Jeffrey L; Hoffman, Stephen L",Annals of internal medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16940336/,11

This virus is the cause of the COVID-19 disease. This infection later spread to the whole world. The goal of this article is to present the clinical and laboratory characteristics of patients with COVID-19 treated in the Faculty Hospital Pilsen. METHODS In this monocentric, retrospective study, clinical and biochemical data of 89 adult patients with COVID-19 was analyzed. These patients were in the care of the Faculty Hospital Pilsen between March 14 and April 7. RESULTS In this cohort, made up of 89 patients, 63 were treated as outpatients and 26 were hospitalized. 10 patients required intensive care. The most common symptoms among patients were cough and fever. Dyspnea was present in 29 patients. A CT scan showed bilateral pneumonia in 23 of the admitted patients. Fever and bilateral pneumonia were significantly more common in patients ≥ 60 years old (p=0.047, and p=0.001, respectively). Of lab results, the patients in intensive care had significantly higher values of C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, lactate dehydrogenase, interleukin 6, myoglobin and ferritin. CONCLUSION The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever and cough. These two symptoms are simultaneously present in more than half the cases. Approximately 1/10th of patients requires intensive care.

METHODS Ten identified SARS patients were selected from a general hospital in March. Survey was carried out through a standardized questionnaire provided by Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Contents of the questionnaire would include: history of contact with SARS patient, route of infection, methods used for protection and so on. RESULTS (1) Distribution os SARS patients were confined to 3 wards: 4, 5, and 6 on the 7, 8, 12, 13 and 14 floors in the west unit of the inpatient building. Most of the inpatients were elderly and having severe original diseases. (2) Index patients were the first generation source of transmission and they infected inpatients and medical staff, making them the second generation. People with latent infection who had close contact with SARS patients might also serve as the possible source of transmission. (3) The major transmission routes were: near distant droplet infection and close contact infection. There was also a clue to the probability of aerosol or droplet nuclei infection through air-conditioning and ventilation system. CONCLUSION Nosocomial infection appeared to be the main characteristic of the SARS epidemic in the early stage of this hospital. Other than close contact and near space airborne transmission of SARS virus, the possibility of long-distance aerosol transmission called for further epidemiological and experimental studies in the future.","He, Yao; Jiang, Yong; Xing, Yu-bin; Zhong, Guang-lin; Wang, Lei; Sun, Zheng-ji; Jia, Hong; Chang, Qing; Wang, Yong; Ni, Bin; Chen, Shi-ping",Zhonghua liu xing bing xue za zhi = Zhonghua liuxingbingxue zazhi,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12975006/,11

At the same time samples were tested for the presence of 12 respiratory viruses--IAV, IBV, PIV 1 - 4, RSV, RV, metapneumoviruses, and coronaviruses NL63, 229E and OC43--in the presence of IPC represented by equine arteritis virus using analogous PCR test-system provided by medical center of Leiden university. Results of tests for detection of IAV, IBV, RSV, PIV 1 - 4, and RV, analyzed by both systems, agreed in 94%. Multiplex format of RT-PCR performing significantly reduces time and cost of the test, which make it suitable and effective instrument of epidemiological studies.","Nikonova, A A; Uspenskaia, E S; Lobodanov, S A; Oksanich, A S; Gorbalenia, A E; Claas, Eric C J; Foshina, E P; Kaira, A N; Zverev, V V; Faĭzuloev, E B","Zhurnal mikrobiologii, epidemiologii, i immunobiologii",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19338239/,11
196846,Cell cycle perturbations induced by infection with the coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus and their effect on virus replication.,2006,"Over recent years, the use of individually ventilated cage (IVC) rack systems in laboratory rodent facilities has increased. Since every cage in an IVC rack may be assumed to be a separate microbiological unit, comprehensive microbiological monitoring of animals kept in IVCs has become a challenging task, which may be addressed by the appropriate use of sentinel mice. Traditionally, these sentinels have been exposed to soiled bedding but more recently, the concept of exposure to exhaust air has been considered. The work reported here was aimed firstly at testing the efficiency of a sentinel-based microbiological monitoring programme under field conditions in a quarantine unit and in a multi-user unit with frequent imports of mouse colonies from various sources. Secondly, it was aimed at determining biocontainment of naturally infected mice kept in an IVC rack, which included breeding of the mice. Sentinels were exposed both to soiled bedding and to exhaust air. The mice which were used in the study carried prevalent infectious agents encountered in research animal facilities including mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), mouse parvovirus (MPV), intestinal flagellates and pinworms. Our data indicate that the sentinel-based health monitoring programme allowed rapid detection of MHV, intestinal flagellates and pinworms investigated by a combination of soiled bedding and exhaust air exposure. MHV was also detected by exposure to exhaust air only. The IVC rack used in this study provided biocontainment when infected mice were kept together with non-infected mice in separate cages in the same IVC rack.","Brielmeier, M; Mahabir, E; Needham, J R; Lengger, C; Wilhelm, P; Schmidt, J",Laboratory animals,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16803642/,11

Observed leukopenia may lead to more frequent monitoring, or even acute discontinuation of clozapine treatment. COVID-19 may cause deviating blood parameters such as leukopenia, and more exceptionally even granulocytopenia, just as clozapine does. In case of a SARS-CoV-2 infection and leukopenia, it is important to differentiate whether the reduced white blood cell count is caused by clozapine - in which case it needs to be stopped immediately - or as a consequence of infection with the coronavirus. In case of a mild leukopenia, based on a lymphopenia, clozapine can be safely continued with more frequent blood monitoring. Additionally, the dosage of clozapine should be reduced by half, due to the risk of a sudden increase of clozapine serum levels.","Smits, F; Bogers, J P A M; de Leeuw, M",Tijdschrift voor psychiatrie,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34231858/,11

However, growing concerns about biodiversity loss and emerging diseases of wildlife origin have enhanced debates about the importance of wildlife. Wildlife-related diseases are viewed through these debates as a potential threat to wildlife conservation and domestic animal and human health. This article provides an overview of the values we place on wildlife (positive: socio-cultural, nutritional, economic, ecological; and negative: damages, health issues) and of the significance of diseases for biodiversity conservation. It shows that the values of wildlife, the emergence of wildlife diseases and biodiversity conservation are closely linked. The article also illustrates why investigations into wildlife diseases are now recognized as an integral part of global health issues.

197247,Experimental demyelination produced by the A59 strain of mouse hepatitis virus.,1984,"BACKGROUND Post-operative diaphragmatic hernias (PODHs) are serious complications following esophagectomy or total gastrectomy. The aim of this study was to describe and compare the incidence of PODHs at a high volume center over time and analyze the outcomes of patients who develop a PODH. METHODS A prospective database of all resectional esophagogastric operations performed for cancer between January 2001 and December 2015 was analyzed. Patients diagnosed with PODH were identified and data extracted regarding demographics, details of initial resection, pathology, PODH symptoms, diagnosis and treatment. RESULTS Out of 631 patients who had hiatal dissection for malignancy, 35 patients developed of PODH (5.5 % overall incidence). Median age was 66 (range 23-87) years. The incidence of PODH in each operation type was: 2 % (4/221) following an open 2 or 3 stage esophagectomy, 10 % (22/212) following laparoscopic hybrid esophagectomy, 7 % (5/73) following MIO, and 3 % (4/125) following total gastrectomy. The majority of patients had colon or small bowel in a left-sided hernia. Of the 35 patients who developed a PODH, 20 (57 %) patients required emergency surgery, whereas 15 (43 %) had non-urgent repair. The majority of the patients had had suture repair (n = 24) or mesh repair (n = 7) of the diaphragmatic defect. Four patients were treated non-operatively. In hospital post-operative mortality was 20 % (4/20) in the emergency group and 0 % (0/15) in the elective group. Further hernia recurrence affected seven patients (n = 7/27, 26 %) and 4 of these patients (15 %) presented with multiple recurrences. CONCLUSION PODH is a common complication following hybrid esophagectomy and MIO. Given the high mortality from emergency repair, careful thought is needed to identify surgical techniques to prevent PODH forming when minimal access esophagectomy are performed. Upper GI surgeons need to have a low index of suspicion to investigate and treat patients for this complication.","Matthews, Jacob; Bhanderi, Shivam; Mitchell, Harriet; Whiting, John; Vohra, Ravinder; Hodson, James; Griffiths, Ewen",Surgical endoscopy,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27105617/,11

METHODS Retrospective cases involving 801 patients admitted to hospitals in Beijing between March and June 2003, with a diagnosis of probable SARS, moderate type. The series of clinical manifestation, laboratory and radiograph data obtained from 801 cases were analyzed. RESULTS One to three days after the onset of SARS, the major clinical symptoms were fever (in 88.14% of patients), fatigue, headache, myalgia, arthralgia (25-36%), etc. The counts of WBC (in 22.56% of patients) lymphocyte (70.25%) and CD3, CD4, CD8 positive T cells (70%) decreased. From 4-7 d, the unspecific symptoms became weak; however, the rates of low respiratory tract symptoms, such as cough (24.18%), sputum production (14.26%), chest distress (21.04%) and shortness of breath (9.23%) increased, so did the abnormal rates on chest radiograph or CT. The low counts of WBC, lymphocyte and CD3, CD4, CD8 positive T cells touched bottom. From 8 to 16 d, the patients presented progressive cough (29.96%), sputum production (13.09%), chest distress (29.96%) and shortness of breath (35.34%). All patients had infiltrates on chest radiograph or CT, some even with multi-infiltrates. Two weeks later, patients' respiratory symptoms started to alleviate, the infiltrates on the lung began to absorb gradually, the counts of WBC, lymphocyte and CD3, CD4, CD8 positive T cells were restored to normality.

197611,Analysis of efficiently packaged defective interfering RNAs of murine coronavirus: localization of a possible RNA-packaging signal.,1990,"Coronaviruses (CoV) are enveloped, spherical, single-stranded positive-sense RNA viruses causing mainly respiratory and intestinal infections in animals and humans. Until recently five types of human coronaviruses (HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E, SARS-CoV) have been known, however a novel CoV has been identified in 2012 in Saudi Arabia. This virus, namely MERS-CoV (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus), was classified within Coronaviridae family, Coronavirinae sub-family, Betacoronavirus genus, clade C. It causes acute respiratory infections in humans and transmits via respiratory route and close contact between humans. The aim of this study was to present the first MERS case from Turkey identified by molecular methods and the results of viral sequence analysis. A 42-year-old male Turkish citizen who worked as an employee in Jeddah, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, admitted to hospital with the complaints of fever and malaise on 25-26 September 2014. Since his symptoms went on and got worse, he returned to Turkey, and hospitalized in a hospital's intensive care unit in Hatay on 6th of October with the symptoms of fever, malaise, sweating, cough and respiratory distress. He transferred to a university hospital on 8th of October and died on 11th October. The tracheal aspirate sample obtained before he died was sent to Virology Unit of Reference Laboratories of the Turkish Public Health Institution. Detection of viral RNA was performed by using a commercial real-time PCR kit (hCoV-EMC Real-Time RT-PCR, Fast Track Diagnostics, Luxembourg) targeting the MERS-CoV E protein (upE), ORF1a and ORF1b gene regions. The reference method Superscript III One Step RT-PCR (Invitrogen, USA) recommended by World Health Organization (WHO) was also applied for confirmation. Both of the methods yielded positive results for MERS-CoV RNA. For the amplification of nucleocapsid (N) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) genes, hemi-nested PCR (Invitrogen, ABD) was conducted, followed by sequence analysis of 204 nucleotide part of N gene. Phylogenetic tree of N gene was obtained with the use of MEGA6 software. N gene was chosen as it comprised a two aminoacid deletion in the corresponding published sequence from the patient treated in London, United Kingdom. There was no nucleotide or aminoacid change in our isolate, namely ANK/1079/2014 when compared with human Betacoronavirus 2c EMC/2012 reference strain found in Genbank database. The target gene regions selected in our study (UpE, ORF1a, ORF1b, N and RdRp) which were also recommended by WHO, shown to have high specificity and sensitivity for the diagnosis and confirmation of MERS-CoV, and also recommended by WHO. The previous studies indicated that, the viral genomes detected in the earliest cases of humans (clade A) are genetically distinct from the others (clade B) which were isolated from dromedary camels and humans. In our study, according to phylogenetic analysis of partial N gene segment, isolate ANK/1079/2014 has taken place within clade A. In conclusion, MERS-CoV appears to have limited circulation in Arabian Peninsula and Middle-Eastern countries, it should be considered in mind that travel-related cases may export the virus outside these regions leading autochtonous infections in the other parts of the world.","Bayrakdar, Fatma; Altaş, Ayşe Başak; Korukluoğlu, Gülay; Topal, Selmur",Mikrobiyoloji bulteni,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26313282/,11
198156,Molecular epidemiology of infectious bronchitis virus in The Netherlands.,1987,"The small envelope protein (E) plays a role of central importance in the assembly of coronaviruses. This was initially established by studies demonstrating that cellular expression of only E protein and the membrane protein (M) was necessary and sufficient for the generation and release of virus-like particles. To investigate the role of E protein in the whole virus, we previously generated E gene mutants of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) that were defective in viral growth and produced aberrantly assembled virions. Surprisingly, however, we were also able to isolate a viable MHV mutant (DeltaE) in which the entire E gene, as well as the nonessential upstream genes 4 and 5a, were deleted. We have now constructed an E knockout mutant that confirms that the highly defective phenotype of the DeltaE mutant is due to loss of the E gene. Additionally, we have created substitution mutants in which the MHV E gene was replaced by heterologous E genes from viruses spanning all three groups of the coronavirus family. Group 2 and 3 E proteins were readily exchangeable for that of MHV. However, the E protein of a group 1 coronavirus, transmissible gastroenteritis virus, became functional in MHV only after acquisition of particular mutations. Our results show that proteins encompassing a remarkably diverse range of primary amino acid sequences can provide E protein function in MHV. These findings suggest that E protein facilitates viral assembly in a manner that does not require E protein to make sequence-specific contacts with M protein.","Kuo, Lili; Hurst, Kelley R; Masters, Paul S",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17182690/,11

198258,Rapid diagnosis of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus infection by polymerase chain reaction.,1997,"INTRODUCTION It is clear that a proportion of patients continue to suffer long-lasting symptoms following acute infection with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Persistent olfactory dysfunction is one of the commonest complaints reported in the condition colloquially known as long COVID (now known as post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC)). The prevalence, risk factors and clinical course of long COVID olfactory dysfunction are not yet well understood. At present, the main stay of treatment is olfactory training. Quantitative olfactory testing and impacts on patient quality of life have not been widely studied. This study describes our experiences at Wrightington, Wigan and Leigh Teaching Hospitals, UK (WWL) of establishing a COVID-19 smell clinic, along with preliminary data on patient demographics, baseline smell test scores and quality of life questionnaire scores before olfactory training. METHODS We piloted a COVID-19 smell clinic. We recorded patient demographics and clinical characteristics then performed clinical assessment of each patient. Quantitative measurements of olfactory dysfunction were recorded using the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT). We measured the impact of olfactory dysfunction on patient quality of life using the validated English Olfactory Disorders Questionnaire (eODQ). RESULTS 20 patients participated in the clinic. 4 patients were excluded from analysis due to missing data. Median age was 35 years. 81% (n=13) of the participants were female. 50% (n=8) of patients suffered with a combination of anosmia/ageusia and parosmia, whilst 43% (n=7) of patients suffered with anosmia/ageusia without parosmia. Almost all the patients registered UPSIT scores in keeping with impaired olfaction. Patient scores ranged from 22 to 35, with the median score at 30. All patients reported that their olfactory dysfunction had an impact on their quality of life. The median eODQ score reported was 90, with scores ranging from 42 to 169 out of a maximum of 180. CONCLUSION We have demonstrated that it is simple and feasible to set up a COVID-19 smell clinic. The materials are inexpensive, but supervised completion of the UPSIT and eODQ is time-consuming. Patients demonstrate reduced olfaction on quantitative testing and experience significant impacts on their quality of life as a result. More research is needed to demonstrate if olfactory training results in measurable improvements in smell test scores and quality of life.","Chu, M; Gopikrishna, D; Rocke, J; Kumar, B N",The Medical journal of Malaysia,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34558550/,11
198270,Efficient homologous RNA recombination and requirement for an open reading frame during replication of equine arteritis virus defective interfering RNAs.,2000,"The US government considers cyanide to be among the most likely agents of chemical terrorism. Cyanide differs from many other biological or chemical agents for which little or no defense is available because its individual and public health effects are largely remediable through appropriate preparedness and response. Because the toxicity of the cyanide antidote currently available in the United States renders it ill-suited for use in terrorist incidents and other situations requiring rapid out-of-hospital treatment, hydroxocobalamin--an effective and safe cyanide antidote being used in other countries--has been introduced in the United States. Unlike the other available cyanide antidote, hydroxocobalamin can be administered at the scene of a cyanide disaster, and it need not be reserved for cases of confirmed cyanide poisoning but can be administered in cases of suspected poisoning. Both of these attributes facilitate the rapid intervention necessary for saving lives. To realize the potential benefits of hydroxocobalamin, progress also needs to be realized in other aspects of readiness, including but not limited to developing plans for ensuring local and regional availability of antidote, educating emergency responders and health care professionals in the recognition and management of cyanide poisoning, and raising public awareness of the potential for a chemical weapons attack and of how to respond.","Eckstein, Marc",The Journal of emergency medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17976798/,11

This study aimed to describe the range of bat viromes, including viruses from mammals, insects, fungi, plants, and phages, in 11 insectivorous bat species (216 bats in total) common in six provinces of China. To analyze viromes, we used sequence-independent PCR amplification and next-generation sequencing technology (Solexa Genome Analyzer II; Illumina). The viromes were identified by sequence similarity comparisons to known viruses. The mammalian viruses included those of the Adenoviridae, Herpesviridae, Papillomaviridae, Retroviridae, Circoviridae, Rhabdoviridae, Astroviridae, Flaviridae, Coronaviridae, Picornaviridae, and Parvovirinae; insect viruses included those of the Baculoviridae, Iflaviridae, Dicistroviridae, Tetraviridae, and Densovirinae; fungal viruses included those of the Chrysoviridae, Hypoviridae, Partitiviridae, and Totiviridae; and phages included those of the Caudovirales, Inoviridae, and Microviridae and unclassified phages. In addition to the viruses and phages associated with the insects, plants, and bacterial flora related to the diet and habitation of bats, we identified the complete or partial genome sequences of 13 novel mammalian viruses. These included herpesviruses, papillomaviruses, a circovirus, a bocavirus, picornaviruses, a pestivirus, and a foamy virus. Pairwise alignments and phylogenetic analyses indicated that these novel viruses showed little genetic similarity with previously reported viruses. This study also revealed a high prevalence and diversity of bat astroviruses and coronaviruses in some provinces. These findings have expanded our understanding of the viromes of bats in China and hinted at the presence of a large variety of unknown mammalian viruses in many common bat species of mainland China.","Wu, Zhiqiang; Ren, Xianwen; Yang, Li; Hu, Yongfeng; Yang, Jian; He, Guimei; Zhang, Junpeng; Dong, Jie; Sun, Lilian; Du, Jiang; Liu, Liguo; Xue, Ying; Wang, Jianmin; Yang, Fan; Zhang, Shuyi; Jin, Qi",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22855479/,11

To examine the effect of storage temperature on the ability to detect PEDV and TGEV RNA by multiplex RT-PCR, fecal samples were stored for different temperatures (4, 21, 36, and 45 C) before extracting viral RNA. The PEDV and TGEV nucleic acids in fecal samples were stable up to 3 days at 4 C. The PEDV and TGEV nucleic acids were consistently detected in fecal samples up to 60 hours at 21 C and 24 hours only at 36 and 45 C. Thereafter, the number of positive signals declined. Positive signals were detected in fecal samples stored at 4 C by 240 hours. The PEDV and TGEV nucleic acids were consistently detected in fecal samples up to 60 hours at 21 C and 24 hours only at 36 and 45 C. The results of this study suggested that storage temperature has significant effect on the detection of PEDV and TGEV nucleic acids from fecal samples by multiplex RT-PCR.","Jung, Kwonil; Chae, Chanhee","Journal of veterinary diagnostic investigation : official publication of the American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians, Inc",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15152841/,11

Four male patients of this family had congenital conductive hearing loss. Three of these family members underwent bilateral ossiculoplasty, a father and two of his three sons. All three were found to have mild or moderate conductive hearing loss due to fixation of the head of the stapes by a bony bar that extended from the head of the stapes to the posterior ear canal wall. Surgical removal of the bony bar improved hearing in all cases. This family exhibits autosomal-dominant inheritance of this abnormality. Fixation of the head of the stapes by a bony bar that extends to the posterior ear canal wall is a rare cause of congenital, autosomal-dominant, mild or moderate conductive hearing loss that can be surgically corrected.","Wetmore, Stephen J; Gross, Andrew F","Ear, nose, & throat journal",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21853440/,11

However, inadequate attention seems to have been paid to the heart when managing COVID-19 in terms of detection, monitoring and treatment. We are of the opinion that these severe patients may have had myocardial injury or acute myocarditis. Signs that supports this opinion is the extremely high myocardial injury markers in severe patients, cardiac arrhythmia and suffer progressive heart failure or unexpected cardiac arrest in recent studies. Some suggestions involved of treatment need to be made. The use of an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) plus extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) should be placed earlier if the pneumonia progresses rapidly, the ejection fraction decreases or there is heart failure. Besides, blood purification treatment including continuous kidney substitution treatment (CRRT) is recommended to clear inflammatory factors and block cytokine storm. In addition, the early usage of glucocorticoid and human immunoglobulin has been found to be preferable when acute myocarditis is accompanied by unstable hemodynamics.","Li, Long; Hill, Jonathan; Spratt, James C; Jin, Zening",Resuscitation,,11

229393,Introductions to the Community: Early-Career Researchers in the Time of COVID-19,2021,"OBJECTIVES: There is very limited evidence to support the common practice of preparative fasting prior to contrast-enhanced computerized tomography (CT). This study examined the effect of withholding fasting orders, prior to contrast-enhanced CT, on the incidence of aspiration pneumonitis and adverse gastrointestinal symptoms. METHODS: This randomized controlled trial enrolled hospitalized patients referred for non-emergency, contrast-enhanced CT scan to either at least 4 h of fasting or to an unrestricted consumption of liquids and solids up to the time of CT. The primary outcome was incidence of aspiration pneumonitis and the secondary outcomes were rates of adverse gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea and/or vomiting). RESULTS: After excluding participants with incomplete follow-up, a total of 1080 participants were assigned to the fasting group and 1011 were assigned to the non-fasting group. Aspiration pneumonitis was not identified in either group. The mean time of fasting in the fasting group was 8.4 ± 1.6 h. Rates of nausea and vomiting were not statistically different between the fasting group compared with the non-fasting group, 6.6% vs. 7.6% (p = 0.37) and 2.6% vs. 3.0% (p = 0.58), respectively. A subgroup analysis of patients who were required to drink oral contrast agent (n = 1257) showed that rates of nausea and vomiting were not statistically different between the fasting and non-fasting groups, 6.8% vs. 8.0% (p = 0.42) and 2.6% vs. 3.6% (p = 0.3), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Withholding fasting orders prior to contrast-enhanced CT was not associated with a greater risk of aspiration pneumonitis or a significant increase in rates of adverse gastrointestinal symptoms. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov : NCT03533348 KEY POINTS: â¢ Is fasting necessary prior to contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT)? â¢ In this randomized clinical study including 2091 participants referred to non-emergency contrast-enhanced CT scan, withholding preparative fasting was not associated with a greater risk of aspiration pneumonitis or clinically significant increase in rates of adverse gastrointestinal symptoms. â¢ Eating and drinking prior to contrast-enhanced CT can be allowed and are not associated with an increased risk of aspiration pneumonitis.","Neeman, Ziv; Abu Ata, Mayasa; Touma, Elia; Saliba, Walid; Barnett-Griness, Ofra; Gralnek, Ian M; Rock, Wasim; Bisharat, Naiel",Eur. radiol,,11

There are two objectives: to arrive at an appropriate model that captures the collected data faithfully and to use that as a basis to explore the nonlinear behavior. We use a nonlinear susceptible, exposed, infectious and removed transmission model with added behavioral and government policy dynamics. We develop a genetic algorithm technique to identify key model parameters employing COVID-19 data from South Korea. Stability, bifurcations and dynamic behavior are analyzed. Parametric analysis reveals conditions for sustained epidemic equilibria to occur. This work points to the value of nonlinear dynamic analysis in pandemic modeling and demonstrates the dramatic influence of social and government behavior on disease dynamics.","Kwuimy, C A K; Nazari, Foad; Jiao, Xun; Rohani, Pejman; Nataraj, C",Nonlinear Dyn,,11

COVID-19 specific biomarkers of cognitive impairment are currently lacking, but there is some evidence that SARS-CoV-2 could preferentially and directly target the frontal lobes, as suggested by behavioral and dysexecutive symptoms, fronto-temporal hypoperfusion on MRI, EEG slowing in frontal regions, and frontal hypometabolism on 18F-FDG-PET imaging. We suggest that an inflammatory parainfectious process targeting preferentially the frontal lobes (and/or frontal networks) could be the underlying cause of these shared clinical, neurophysiological, and imaging findings in COVID-19 patients. We explore the biological mechanisms and the clinical biomarkers that might underlie such disruption of frontal circuits and highlight the need of standardized diagnostic procedures to be applied when investigating patients with these clinical findings. We also suggest the use of a unique label, to increase comparability across studies.","Toniolo, Sofia; Di Lorenzo, Francesco; Scarioni, Marta; Frederiksen, Kristian Steen; Nobili, Flavio",J Alzheimers Dis,,11

In reality, Australia is very far away from addressing the societal level drivers of health inequity. There is little progressive policy that touches on the conditions of daily life that matter for health, and action to redress inequities in power, money and resources is almost non-existent. In this chapter we ask you to pause this reality and come on a fantastic journey where we envisage how COVID-19 was a great disruptor and accelerator of positive progressive action. We offer glimmers of what life could be like if there was committed and real policy action on the social determinants of health equity. It is vital that the health sector assists in convening the multisectoral stakeholders necessary to turn this fantasy into reality. CHAPTER 2: ABORIGINAL AND TORRES STRAIT ISLANDER CONNECTION TO CULTURE: BUILDING STRONGER INDIVIDUAL AND COLLECTIVE WELLBEING: Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples have long maintained that culture (ie, practising, maintaining and reclaiming it) is vital to good health and wellbeing. However, this knowledge and understanding has been dismissed or described as anecdotal or intangible by Western research methods and science. As a result, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander culture is a poorly acknowledged determinant of health and wellbeing, despite its significant role in shaping individuals, communities and societies. By extension, the cultural determinants of health have been poorly defined until recently. However, an increasing amount of scientific evidence supports what Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have always said - that strong culture plays a significant and positive role in improved health and wellbeing. Owing to known gaps in knowledge, we aim to define the cultural determinants of health and describe their relationship with the social determinants of health, to provide a full understanding of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander wellbeing. We provide examples of evidence on cultural determinants of health and links to improved Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health and wellbeing. We also discuss future research directions that will enable a deeper understanding of the cultural determinants of health for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. CHAPTER 3: PHYSICAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH: HEALTHY, LIVEABLE AND SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITIES: Good city planning is essential for protecting and improving human and planetary health. Until recently, however, collaboration between city planners and the public health sector has languished. We review the evidence on the health benefits of good city planning and propose an agenda for public health advocacy relating to health-promoting city planning for all by 2030. Over the next 10 years, there is an urgent need for public health leaders to collaborate with city planners - to advocate for evidence-informed policy, and to evaluate the health effects of city planning efforts. Importantly, we need integrated planning across and between all levels of government and sectors, to create healthy, liveable and sustainable cities for all. CHAPTER 4: HEALTH PROMOTION IN THE ANTHROPOCENE: THE ECOLOGICAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH: Human health is inextricably linked to the health of the natural environment. In this chapter, we focus on ecological determinants of health, including the urgent and critical threats to the natural environment, and opportunities for health promotion arising from the human health co-benefits of actions to protect the health of the planet. We characterise ecological determinants in the Anthropocene and provide a sobering snapshot of planetary health science, particularly the momentous climate change health impacts in Australia. We highlight Australia's position as a major fossil fuel producer and exporter, and a country lacking cohesive and timely emissions reduction policy. We offer a roadmap for action, with four priority directions, and point to a scaffold of guiding approaches - planetary health, Indigenous people's knowledge systems, ecological economics, health co-benefits and climate-resilient development. Our situation requires a paradigm shift, and this demands a recalibration of health promotion education, research and practice in Australia over the coming decade. CHAPTER 5: DISRUPTING THE COMMERCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH: Our vision for 2030 is an Australian economy that promotes optimal human and planetary health for current and future generations. To achieve this, current patterns of corporate practice and consumption of harmful commodities and services need to change. In this chapter, we suggest ways forward for Australia, focusing on pragmatic actions that can be taken now to redress the power imbalances between corporations and Australian governments and citizens. We begin by exploring how the terms of health policy making must change to protect it from conflicted commercial interests. We also examine how marketing unhealthy products and services can be more effectively regulated, and how healthier business practices can be incentivised. Finally, we make recommendations on how various public health stakeholders can hold corporations to account, to ensure that people come before profits in a healthy and prosperous future Australia. CHAPTER 6: DIGITAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH: THE DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION: We live in an age of rapid and exponential technological change. Extraordinary digital advancements and the fusion of technologies, such as artificial intelligence, robotics, the Internet of Things and quantum computing constitute what is often referred to as the digital revolution or the Fourth Industrial Revolution (Industry 4.0). Reflections on the future of public health and health promotion require thorough consideration of the role of digital technologies and the systems they influence. Just how the digital revolution will unfold is unknown, but it is clear that advancements and integrations of technologies will fundamentally influence our health and wellbeing in the future. The public health response must be proactive, involving many stakeholders, and thoughtfully considered to ensure equitable and ethical applications and use. CHAPTER 7: GOVERNANCE FOR HEALTH AND EQUITY: A VISION FOR OUR FUTURE: Coronavirus disease 2019 has caused many people and communities to take stock on Australia's direction in relation to health, community, jobs, environmental sustainability, income and wealth. A desire for change is in the air. This chapter imagines how changes in the way we govern our lives and what we value as a society could solve many of the issues Australia is facing - most pressingly, the climate crisis and growing economic and health inequities. We present an imagined future for 2030 where governance structures are designed to ensure transparent and fair behaviour from those in power and to increase the involvement of citizens in these decisions, including a constitutional voice for Indigenous peoples. We imagine that these changes were made by measuring social progress in new ways, ensuring taxation for public good, enshrining human rights (including to health) in legislation, and protecting and encouraging an independent media.

In most parts of the world, testing largely focused on symptomatic cases, and we thus hypothesized that the true number of infected cases and relative testing capacity are better determinants to guide lockdown exit strategies We employed the SEIR model to estimate the numbers of undocumented cases As expected, the estimated numbers of all cases largely exceeded the reported ones in all Italian regions Next, we used the numbers of reported and estimated cases per million of population and compared it with the respective numbers of tests In Lombardy, as the most affected region, testing capacity per reported new case seemed between two and eight most of the time, but testing capacity per estimated new cases never reached four up to April 30 In contrast, Veneto's testing capacity per reported and estimated new cases were much less discrepant and were between four and 16 most of the time As per April 30 also Marche, Lazio and other Italian regions arrived close to 16 ratio of test capacity per new estimated infection Thus, the criterion to exit a lockdown should be decided at the level of the regions, based on the local testing capacity that should reach 16 times the estimated true number of newly infected cases as predicted","Li, C.; Romagnani, P.; Anders, H.

310373,De novo 3D models of SARS-CoV-2 RNA elements from consensus experimental secondary structures,2021,"Rituals may be understood broadly as stereotyped behaviours carrying symbolic meanings, which play a crucial role in defining relationships, legitimating authority, giving meaning to certain life events and stabilising social structures. Despite intense interest in the subject, and an extensive literature, relatively little attention has been given to the nature, role and function of ritual in contemporary medicine. Medicine is replete with ritualistic behaviours and imperatives, which play a crucial role in all aspects of clinical practice. Rituals play multiple, complex functions in clinical interactions and have an important role in shaping interactions, experiences and outcomes. Longstanding medical rituals have been disrupted in the wake of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Medical rituals may be evident or invisible, often overlap with or operate alongside instrumentalised practices, and play crucial roles in establishing, maintaining and guaranteeing the efficacy of clinical practices. Rituals can also inhibit progress and change, by enforcing arbitrary authority. Physicians should consider when they are undertaking a ritual practice and recognise when the exigencies of contemporary practice are affecting that ritual with or without meaning or intention. Physicians should reflect on whether aspects of their ritual interactions are undertaken on the basis of sentiment, custom or evidence-based outcomes, and whether rituals should be defended, continued in a modified fashion or even abandoned in favour of new behaviours suitable for and salient with contemporary practice in the interests of patient care.","Arnold, Mark H; Komesaroff, Paul; Kerridge, Ian",Intern Med J,,11

311744,Molecular characterization of infectious bronchitis virus based on RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene,2020,"In this paper, five phenomenological (Richards, a generalized Richards, Blumberg, Tsoularis & Wallace, and Gompertz) models are implemented to predict the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases. The five phenomenological models are in the form of ordinary differential equations with a few number of model parameters. The model parameters of each model were calibrated by fitting the model with the reported cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in East Java Province from March 25 until October 31, 2020 via nonlinear least square method. We compare the performance of the five phenomenological models by measuring four performance metrics, namely the root mean square error (RMSE), the mean absolute error (MAE), the coefficient of determination (R-2) and the Akaike information criterion (AIC). When calibrating the cumulative number of cases, the five models perform very well, which are indicated by their high coefficient of determination (R-2 &gt; 0.999). However, a comparison of the four-performance metrics shows that Tsoularis & Wallace performed the best followed by a generalized Richards model. The prediction for the final size of the COVID-19 epidemic in East Java according to the Tsoularis & Wallace model is kappa = 78 002. Both Richards and Gompertz models tend to underestimate the final size of the epidemic, while the Blumberg model tends to overestimate. The five models estimate the peak of the COVID-19 epidemic in East Java has been occurred on August 13-14, 2020. Using the predicted cumulative number of cases, we determine the daily new cases of COVID-19 in East Java. Based on the four-performance metrics, it appears that the five phenomenological models predict new daily cases of COVID-19 equally well.","Darti, I.; Habibah, U.; Astutik, S.; Kusumawinahyu, W.

First, it has created previously unimaginable opportunities for learning and development and personal exploration and growth. Second, it seems that the very same qualities and characteristics of the Internet that make these positive contributions possible, such as its immediacy, portability, intimacy, unconstrained reach and lack of supervision and regulation of content, has opened children and young people up to a range of serious social, intellectual and mental health risks. Finally, over and above these 'effects', the digital space is increasingly successfully being harnessed for the identification and treatment of mental health problems.

Renal patients undergoing hemodialysis run the risk not only of suffering but also of transmitting and spreading COVID-19 due to multiple factors, both procedural and logistical, associated with the process. These include the long duration of the technique, collective transfer to and from the centres, and the waiting time before performing the technique, aspects that make strict isolation difficult and therefore increase not only the risk of contagion between patients but also between specialist health professionals, which makes it more difficult to replace professionals. Prevention, protection, detection, isolation and distribution measures are essential in the management of the epidemic and must be taken from the initial stage. For this to be possible, it is necessary to draw up protocols to guide the actions of both the patient and the professionals in the different stages of chronic renal disease.","Gómez-Beltrán, Piedras Albas; Domínguez Carranza, Estela; Medero Rubio, Francisca; Pérez Márquez, Manuela",Enferm. clin.

Little is known about NKT cells which represent a bridge between innate and adaptive immunity. METHODS: We characterized peripheral blood T, NK and NKT cells in 45 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia (COVID-19 subjects) and 19 healthy donors (HDs). According to the severity of the disease, we stratified COVID-19 subjects into severe and non-severe groups. RESULTS: Compared to HDs, COVID-19 subjects showed higher percentages of NK CD57+ and CD56dim NK cells and lower percentages of NKT and CD56bright cells. In the severe group we found a significantly lower percentage of NKT cells. In a multiple logistic regression analysis, NKT cell was independently associated with the severity of the disease. CONCLUSIONS: The low percentage of NKT cells in peripheral blood of COVID-19 subjects and the independent association with the severity of the disease suggests a potential role of this subset.","Zingaropoli, Maria Antonella; Perri, Valentina; Pasculli, Patrizia; Cogliati Dezza, Francesco; Nijhawan, Parni; Savelloni, Giulia; La Torre, Giuseppe; D039,; Agostino, Claudia; Mengoni, Fabio; Lichtner, Miriam; Ciardi, Maria Rosa; Mastroianni, Claudio Maria",Clin Immunol,,11

In this paper, we describe our multi-task transfer learning approach for this challenge. Our approach leverages state-of-the-art transformer models including both encoder-based models such as BERT and a sequence-to-sequence based T5 for joint transfer learning on the two tasks. Based on this approach, we submitted several runs to the track. The returned evaluation results show that our runs substantially outperform other participating runs in both IT classification and priority level prediction.","Wang, Congcong; Lillis, David",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.13395v1.pdf,11

378451,Co-infections of chickens with avian influenza virus H9N2 and Moroccan Italy 02 infectious bronchitis virus: effect on pathogenesis and protection conferred by different vaccination programmes,2020,"Importance: Recent studies have suggested that olfactory dysfunction and gustatory dysfunction are associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, olfaction has been evaluated solely on reported symptoms, after COVID-19 diagnosis, and in both mild and severe COVID-19 cases, but rarely has it been assessed in prospectively unselected populations. Objective: To evaluate the diagnostic value of a semiobjective olfactory test developed to assess patient-reported chemosensory dysfunction prior to testing for the presence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in patients attending a COVID-19 screening facility. Design, Setting, and Participants: This prospective diagnostic study with participants and observers blinded to COVID-19 status was conducted in a COVID-19 screening center of a tertiary university hospital in France from March 23 to April 22, 2020. Participants were 854 consecutively included health care workers or outpatients with symptoms or with close contact with an index case. Exclusion criteria were prior chemosensory dysfunction, testing inability, or contraindications (n = 45). Main Outcomes and Measures: Participants were interviewed to ascertain their symptoms and then underwent Clinical Olfactory Dysfunction Assessment (CODA), an ad hoc test developed for a simple and fast evaluation of olfactory function. This assessment followed a standardized procedure in which participants identified and rated the intensity of 3 scents (lavender, lemongrass, and mint) to achieve a summed score ranging from 0 to 6. The COVID-19 status was assessed using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction to detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in samples collected via nasopharyngeal swab (reference standard) to calculate the diagnostic values of patient-reported chemosensory dysfunction and CODA. Results: Of 809 participants, the female to male sex ratio was 2.8, and the mean (SD) age was 41.8 (13.0) years (range, 18-94 years). All participants, if symptomatic, had mild disease at the time of testing, and 58 (7.2%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Chemosensory dysfunction was reported by 20 of 58 participants (34.5%) with confirmed COVID-19 vs 29 of 751 participants (3.9%) who tested negative for COVID-19 (absolute difference, 30.6% [95% CI, 18.3%-42.9%]). Olfactory dysfunction, either self-reported or clinically ascertained (CODA score &#8804;3), yielded similar sensitivity (0.31 [95% CI, 0.20-0.45] vs 0.34 [95% CI, 0.22-0.48]) and specificity (0.97 [95% CI, 0.96-0.98) vs 0.98 [95% CI, 0.96-0.99]) for COVID-19 diagnosis. Concordance was high between reported and clinically tested olfactory dysfunction, with a Gwet AC1 of 0.95 (95% CI, 0.93-0.97). Of 19 participants, 15 (78.9%) with both reported olfactory dysfunction and a CODA score of 3 or lower were confirmed to have COVID-19. The CODA score also revealed 5 of 19 participants (26.3%) with confirmed COVID-19 who had previously unperceived olfactory dysfunction. Conclusions and Relevance: In this prospective diagnostic study of outpatients with asymptomatic or mild to moderate COVID-19, systematically assessed anamnesis and clinical testing with the newly developed CODA were complementary and specific for chemosensory dysfunction. Olfactory dysfunction was suggestive of COVID-19, particularly when clinical testing confirmed anamnesis.

We describe critical illness in pediatric patients with active COVID-19 and identify factors associated with PICU admission and organ dysfunction. This is a retrospective chart review of 77 pediatric patients age 1 day to 21 years admitted to two New York City pediatric hospitals within the Northwell Health system between February 1 and April 24, 2020 with PCR + SARS-CoV-2. Descriptive statistics were used to describe the hospital course and laboratory results and bivariate comparisons were performed on variables to determine differences. RESULTS: Forty-seven patients (61%) were admitted to the general pediatric floor and thirty (39%) to the PICU. The majority (97%, n = 75) survived to discharge, 1.3% (n = 1) remain admitted, and 1.3% (n = 1) died. Common indications for PICU admission included hypoxia (50%), hemodynamic instability (20%), diabetic ketoacidosis (6.7%), mediastinal mass (6.7%), apnea (6.7%), acute chest syndrome in sickle cell disease (6.7%), and cardiac dysfunction (6.7%). Of PICU patients, 46.7% experienced any significant organ dysfunction (pSOFA > = 2) during admission. Patients aged 12 years or greater were more likely to be admitted to a PICU compared to younger patients (p = 0.015). Presence of an underlying comorbidity was not associated with need for PICU admission (p = 0.227) or organ dysfunction (p = 0.87). Initial white blood cell count (WBC), platelet count, and ferritin were not associated with need for PICU admission. Initial C-reactive protein was associated with both need for PICU admission (p = 0.005) and presence of organ dysfunction (p = 0.001). Initial WBC and presenting thrombocytopenia were associated with organ dysfunction (p = 0.034 and p = 0.003, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Age over 12 years and initial CRP were associated with need for PICU admission in COVID-19. Organ dysfunction was associated with elevated admission CRP, elevated WBC, and thrombocytopenia. These factors may be useful in determining risk for critical illness and organ dysfunction in pediatric COVID-19.","Fisler, Grace; Izard, Stephanie M; Shah, Sareen; Lewis, Deirdre; Kainth, Mundeep K; Hagmann, Stefan H F; Belfer, Joshua A; Feld, Lance M; Mastroianni, Fiore; Kvasnovsky, Charlotte L; Capone, Christine A; Schneider, James; Sweberg, Todd; Schleien, Charles; Taylor, Matthew D",Ann Intensive Care,,11

Therefore, the prevention of COVID-19 and the rapid diagnosis of infected patients is crucial. METHOD: We searched all relevant literature published up to February 28, 2020. We used Random-effect models to analyze the appropriateness of the pooled results. RESULT: Eighty studies were included in the meta-analysis, including 61,742 patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection. 62.5% (95% CI 54.5-79, p < 0.001) of patients had a history of recent travel endemic area or contact with them. The most common symptoms among COVID-19 infected patients were fever 87% (95% CI 73-93, p < 0.001), and cough 68% (95% CI 55.5-74, p < 0.001)), respectively. The laboratory analysis showed that thrombocytosis was present in 61% (95% CI 41-78, p < 0.001) CRP was elevated in 79% (95% CI 65-91, p < 0.001), and lymphopenia in 57.5% (95% CI 42-79, p < 0.001). The most common radiographic signs were bilateral involvement in 81% (95% CI 62.5-87, p < 0.001), consolidation in 73.5% (95% CI 50.5-91, p < 0.001), and ground-glass opacity 73.5% (95% CI 40-90, p < 0.001) of patients. Case fatality rate (CFR) in <15 years old was 0.6%, in >50 years old was 39.5%, and in all range group was 6%. CONCLUSIONS: Fever and cough are the most common symptoms of COVID-19 infection in the literature published to date. Thombocytosis, lymphopenia, and increased CRP were common lab findings although most patients included in the overall analysis did not have laboratory values reported. Among Chinese patients with COVID-19, rates of hospitalization, critical condition, and hospitalization were high in this study, but these findings may be biased by reporting only confirmed cases.","Pormohammad, Ali; Ghorbani, Saied; Baradaran, Behzad; Khatami, Alireza; J Turner, Raymond; Mansournia, Mohammad Ali; Kyriacou, Demetrios N; Idrovo, Juan-Pablo; Bahr, Nathan C",Microb Pathog,,11

This emphasizes the need for differentiated responses that account for the varying vulnerabilities of diverse groups regarding the pandemic. In Ghana, much of the attention on COVID-19 has been on urban centres, particularly the country's two largest metropolises in southern Ghana. This has created a gap between national level policy and the experiences of COVID-19 among rural dwellers in Ghana. This is despite evidence that the world's poorest populations will bear the brunt of COVID-19 effects, and that globally, four out of five people living below the poverty line reside in rural areas. Using the Upper West Region as a case study, we discuss the differentiated vulnerabilities that agrarian communities in Ghana face regarding the pandemic.

Workers trapped in precarious employment (PE), both formal and informal, are among those most affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Here we call attention to at least 5 critical ways that the consequences of the crisis among workers in PE will be felt globally: (a) PE will increase, (b) workers in PE will become more precarious, (c) workers in PE will face unemployment without being officially laid off, (d) workers in PE will be exposed to serious stressors and dramatic life changes that may lead to a rise in diseases of despair, and (e) PE might be a factor in deterring the control of or in generating new COVID-19 outbreaks.

CONCLUSION: Postponement of cancer screening due to COVID-19 has resulted in a backlog of individuals needing to undergo structural examination of the colon. The experience during the initial COVID-19 surge with urgent evaluation of the colon for transplant patients prior to transplant suggests that CTC can be done in a lower risk manner as compared to other structural examinations. The procedural profile of CTC is advantageous during this pandemic as maintaining social distancing and preserving healthcare supplies including PPE are of paramount importance.

In this research, the first resolved COVID-19 crystal structure (main protease) was targeted in a virtual screening study by of FDA approved drugs dataset. In addition, a knowledge gap in relations of COVID-19 with the previously known fatal Coronaviruses (CoVs) epidemics, SARS and MERS CoVs, was covered by investigation of sequence statistics and phylogenetics. Materials and methods Molecular modeling, virtual screening, docking, sequence comparison statistics and phylogenetics of the COVID-19 main protease were investigated. Key findings COVID-19 Mpro formed a phylogenetic group with SARS CoV that was distant from MERS CoV. The identity% was 96.061 and 51.61 for COVID-19/SARS and COVID-19/MERS CoV sequence comparisons, respectively. The top 20 drugs in the virtual screening studies comprised a broad-spectrum antiviral (ribavirin), anti-hepatitis B virus (telbivudine), two vitamins (vitamin B12 and nicotinamide) and other miscellaneous systemically acting drugs. Of special interest, ribavirin had been used in treating cases of SARS CoV. Significance The present study provided a comprehensive targeting of the first resolved COVID+19 structure of Mpro and found a suitable save drugs for repurposing against the viral Mpro. Ribavirin, telbivudine, vitamin B12 and nicotinamide can be combined and used for COVID treatment.

A key feature of the COVID-19 era is likely to be a rethink of the way we work and the implications on commuting activity. Working from home (WFH) has been the ‘new normal’ during the period of lockdown, except for essential services that require commuting. In recognition of the new normal as represented by an increasing amount of WFH, this paper develops a model to identify the incidence of WFH and what impact this could have on the number of weekly commuting trips. Using data collected in eight countries (Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and South Africa), we developed a Poisson regression model for the number of days individuals worked from home during the pandemic. Simulated scenarios quantify the impact of the different variables on the probability of WFH by country. The findings provide a reference point as we continue to undertake similar analysis at different points through time during the pandemic and after when restrictions are effectively removed.","Balbontin, Camila; Hensher, David A.; Beck, Matthew J.; Giesen, Ricardo; Basnak, Paul; Vallejo-Borda, Jose Agustin; Venter, Christoffel",J Transp Geogr,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0966692321002416?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtrangeo.2021.103188; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0966692321002416; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34493910/,11

To further understand the disease pathogenesis and, consequently, to develop an additional tool for clinicians to evaluate patients for presumptive intervention we sought to compare plasma cytokine levels between a range of donor and patient samples grouped by a COVID-19 Severity Score (CSS) based on need for hospitalization and oxygen requirement. Here we utilize a mutual information algorithm that classifies the information gain for CSS prediction provided by cytokine expression levels and clinical variables. Using this methodology, we found that a small number of clinical and cytokine expression variables are predictive of presenting COVID-19 disease severity, raising questions about the mechanism by which COVID-19 creates severe illness. The variables that were the most predictive of CSS included clinical variables such as age and abnormal chest x-ray as well as cytokines such as macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF), interferon-inducible protein 10 (IP-10) and Interleukin-1 Receptor Antagonist (IL-1RA). Our results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection causes a plethora of changes in cytokine profiles and that particularly in severely ill patients, these changes are consistent with the presence of Macrophage Activation Syndrome and could furthermore be used as a biomarker to predict disease severity.","Huntington, Kelsey E.; Louie, Anna D.; Lee, Chun Geun; Elias, Jack A.; Ross, Eric A.; El-Deiry, Wafik S.",medRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.24.20235721; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.11.24.20235721v1?rss=1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33269361/,11
591763,Assembly and immunogenicity of coronavirus-like particles carrying infectious bronchitis virus M and S proteins,2013-11-12,"OBJECTIVES: We aimed to define the clinical and serological characteristics of pan-neurofascin antibody-positive patients. METHODS: We tested serum from patients with suspected immune-mediated neuropathies for antibodies directed against nodal/paranodal protein antigens using a live cell-based assay and solid-phase platform. The clinical and serological characteristics of antibody-positive and seronegative patients were then compared. Sera positive for pan-neurofascin were also tested against live myelinated human stem cell-derived sensory neurons for antibody binding. RESULTS: Eight patients with IgG(1)-subclass antibodies directed against both isoforms of the nodal/paranodal cell adhesion molecule neurofascin were identified. All developed rapidly progressive tetraplegia. Cranial nerve deficits (100% vs 26%), autonomic dysfunction (75% vs 13%) and respiratory involvement (88% vs 14%) were more common than in seronegative patients. Four patients died despite treatment with one or more modalities of standard immunotherapy (intravenous immunoglobulin, steroids and/or plasmapheresis), whereas the four patients who later went on to receive the B cell-depleting therapy rituximab then began to show progressive functional improvements within weeks, became seronegative and ultimately became functionally independent. CONCLUSIONS: IgG(1) pan-neurofascin antibodies define a very severe autoimmune neuropathy. We urgently recommend trials of targeted immunotherapy for this serologically classified patient group.","Fehmi, Janev; Davies, Alexander J; Walters, Jon; Lavin, Timothy; Keh, Ryan; Rossor, Alexander M; Munteanu, Tudor; Delanty, Norman; Roberts, Rhys; Bäumer, Dirk; Lennox, Graham; Rinaldi, Simon",J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34400540/; https://doi.org/10.1136/jnnp-2021-326343,11

Our study is to determine the impact of mental and psychological symptoms among population in quarantine for 2 weeks during COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A case-controlled study design have conducted at department of psychiatry of Shenzhen Longgang Center for Chronic Disease Control in Shenzhen, China mainland from 7th April to 15th June 2020.1674 participants (aged 18 to 65 years) in quarantine for 2 weeks and 1743 age-sex matched controls living in Shenzhen were recruited between 7th April 2020 and 15th June 2020. The assessment of depressive, anxiety, and insomnia symptoms were determined by self-reported questionnaires PHQ-9, GAD-7, and ISI, respectively. RESULTS: A total of 1674 participants in quarantine for 2 weeks and 1743 age-sex matched controls (32.6 ± 9.3 years vs. 32.7 ± 10.7 years, 49.8% vs. 47.8% females) were recruited. Population in quarantine had higher score on PHQ-9 (6.1 ± 5.5 vs. 3.0 ± 3.7, p < 0.001), GAD-7 (4.2 ± 4.7 vs. 1.9 ± 3.7, p < 0·001), and ISI (5.5 ± 5.8 vs. 3.1 ± 5.0%, p < 0.001) compared to general population. Population in quarantine showed significantly higher risks of depression (OR: 4.55, 95% CI: 3.82–5.41), anxiety (OR: 2.92, 95% CI: 2.43–3.51), and insomnia (OR: 2.40, 95% CI: 2.02–2.89), when compared to the general population.

594292,Monoclonal antibodies to the matrix (El) glycoprotein of mouse hepatitis virus protect mice from encephalitis,1989-01-31,"Background: COVID-19 infections can spread silently, due to the simultaneous presence of significant numbers of both critical and asymptomatic to mild cases. While for the former reliable data are available (in the form of number of hospitalization and/or beds in intensive care units), this is not the case of the latter. Hence, analytical tools designed to generate reliable forecast and future scenarios, should be implemented to help decision makers planning ahead (e.g. medical structures and equioment). Method: The Test Positivity Rate (TPR) is an indicator designed to describe the evolution of an infectipus disease by accounting for the proportion of the number of persons tested positive in a given day. Previous work of one of the authors showed how an alternative formulation of the TPR exhibits a strong correlation with the number of patients admitted in hospital and intensive care units. In this paper, we investigate the lagged correlation structure between the newly defined TPR and the hospitalized people time series, exploiting a rigorous statistical model, the Seasonal Auto Regressive Moving Average (SARIM A). Results: The rigourous analytical framework chosen, i.e. the stochastic processes theory, allowed for a reliable forecasting about 12 days ahead, of those quantities. The proposed approach would also allow decision makers to forecast the number of beds in hospitals and intensive care units needed 12 days ahead. Conclusion: The obtained results show that a standardized TPR index is a valuable metric to monitor the growth of the COVID-19 epidemic. The index can be computed on daily basis and it is probably one of the best forecasting tools available today for predicting hospital and intensive care units overload, being an optimal compromise between simplicity of calculation and accuracy.","Fenga, L.; Gaspari, M.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.04.21252897v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.04.21252897,11

METHODS: Participants were recruited from communities in Beijing, Lanzhou and Hangzhou, China in May and June 2013 by convenience sampling. Demographics and other relevant information were collected using a self-administered questionnaire. Focus group interviews were conducted using a set of nine pre-developed questions and a tested moderator guide. The interviews were audio recorded and were transcribed verbatim. The constant comparative method was used to identify trends and themes. RESULTS: A total of nine focus group interviews, with 94 participants recruited from nine communities, were conducted. Most participants received H7N9 information via television and the Internet. Most the participants appreciated the transparency and timeliness of the information released by the government. They expressed a sense of trust in the recommended public health advice and followed most of them. The participants suggested that the government release more information about clinical treatment outcomes, have more specific health recommendations that are practical to their settings and expand the use of new media channels for risk communication. CONCLUSION: The public perceived the overall risk communication strategy by the Chinese public health agencies as effective, though the moderator had a governmental agency title that might have biased the results. There is a need to expand the use of social media for risk communication in the future.","Li, Richun; Xie, Ruiqian; Yang, Chong; Frost, Melinda",Western Pac Surveill Response J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27757257/,11
594862,Development of HiBiT-Tagged Recombinant Infectious Bronchitis Coronavirus for Efficient in vitro and in vivo Viral Quantification,2020-08-28,"Summary: Nutritional status has been indicated as a contributing factor to age‐related dysregulation of the immune response. Vitamin E, a lipid‐soluble antioxidant vitamin, is important for normal function of the immune cells. The elderly are at a greater risk for vitamin E intake that is lower than recommended levels. Vitamin E supplementation above currently recommended levels has been shown to improve immune functions in the aged including delayed‐type hypersensitivity skin response and antibody production in response to vaccination, which was shown to be mediated through increased production of interleukin (IL)‐2, leading to enhanced proliferation of T cells, and through reduced production of prostaglandin E(2), a T‐cell suppressive factor, as a result of a decreased peroxynitrite formation. Vitamin E increased both cell‐dividing and IL‐producing capacities of naïve T cells, but not memory T cells. The vitamin E‐induced enhancement of immune functions in the aged was associated with significant improvement in resistance to influenza infection in aged mice and a reduced risk of acquiring upper respiratory infections in nursing home residents. Further studies are needed to determine the signaling mechanisms involved in the upregulation of naïve T‐cell function by vitamin E as well as the specific mechanisms involved in reduction of risk for upper respiratory infections.","Meydani, Simin Nikbin; Han, Sung Nim; Wu, Dayong",Immunol Rev,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15882360/,11

To analyse the economic and psychosocial impact and the infection prevention measures taken by them during the pandemic. METHODS: A 25 item questionnaire designed to assess the components of the objectives was tele-administered between October 2020 and January 2021 to the patients enrolled in the Indian Progressive Systemic Sclerosis Registry registry. RESULTS: Out of the 428 patients in the registry, 336 took part in the study. Scheduled outpatient visit was missed by 310 (92.3%) patients and 75 (22.3%) skipped prescription drugs. During the pandemic, 75 (22.3%) had a family member lose jobs. Financial difficulties were reported by 155 (46.1%) with 116 (34.5%) patients having to spend an additional of INR 4000 (2000 to 10000) [USD 54.9 (27.0– 137.4)] to continue treatment. Though 35 patients (10.4%) had at least one symptom suggestive of COVID-19, confirmed infection was only in 4. None of them needed hospitalisation or had adverse outcomes. Worsening of Scleroderma was seen in 133 (39.6%) individuals with 15(4.5%) requiring hospitalisation. Most (96%) of the patients were aware about infection prevention measures and 91(27.1%) had taken unproven prophylactic medications. CONCLUSION: Individuals with Scleroderma in India have been affected during the pandemic due to closure of hospital services, lack of transport, loss of job and the additional financial burden. Healthcare providers should continue to educate patients to stay on their medications and encourage them to get vaccinated for COVID-19.","Kavadichanda, Chengappa; Shobha, Vineeta; Ghosh, Parasar; Wakhlu, Anupam; Bairwa, Devender; Mohanan, Manju; Janardana, Ramya; Sircar, Geetabali; Sahoo, Rasmi Ranjan; Joseph, Sneha; Negi, Vir Singh; Khanna, Dinesh; Shenoy, Padmanabha",Rheumatol Adv Pract,https://doi.org/10.1093/rap/rkab027; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34095747/,11

DESIGN: Survey-based cross-sectional assessment. SETTING: The intensive care unit at the Nightingale London hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Staff working in the clinical area and therefore requiring full personal protective equipment (PPE). INTERVENTION: Survey of all staff members sampled from a single shift at the Nightingale Hospital. This investigated perceived utility and actual use of identification methods (name and role labels on visors and gowns, coloured role identification tapes) and formal hand signals as an adjunctive communication method. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Self-reported frequency of use and perceived utility of each communication and personnel identification adjunct. RESULTS: Fifty valid responses were received (72% response rate), covering all clinical professional groups. Prominent name/role identifications and coloured role identification tapes were very frequently used and were perceived as being highly useful. Formal hand signals were infrequently used and not perceived as being beneficial, with respondents citing use of individual hand signals only in specific circumstances. CONCLUSION: PPE is highly depersonalizing, and interpersonal identification aids are very useful. Despite being difficult, verbal communication is not completely prohibited, which could explain the low utility of formal hand signals. The methods developed at the Nightingale hospital have enhanced communication in the critical care, field hospital setting. There is potential for wider application to a variety of healthcare settings, in both the current situation and future pandemic scenarios.","Shurlock, Jonathan; Rudd, James; Jeanes, Annette; Iacovidou, Aphrodite; Creta, Antonio; Kanthasamy, Vijayabharathy; Schilling, Richard; Sullivan, Eamonn; Cooke, Joanne; Laws-Chapman, Colette; Baxter, David; Finlay, Malcolm",Int J Qual Health Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33270866/; https://doi.org/10.1093/intqhc/mzaa162,11
598597,The cellular protein nucleolin preferentially binds long-looped G-quadruplex nucleic acids(),2017-05-11,"Pork processing plants were apparent hotspots for SARS-CoV2 in the spring of 2020. As a result, the swine industry was confronted with a major occupational health, financial, and animal welfare crisis. The objective of this work was to describe the epidemiological situation within processing plants, develop mathematical models to simulate transmission in these plants, and test the effectiveness of routine PCR screening at minimizing SARS-CoV2 circulation. Cumulative incidence of clinical (PCR-confirmed) disease plateaued at ~2.5% to 25% across the three plants studied here. For larger outbreaks, antibody prevalence was approximately 30% to 40%. Secondly, we developed a mathematical model that accounts for asymptomatic, pre-symptomatic, and background ""community"" transmission. By calibrating this model to observed epidemiological data, we estimated the initial reproduction number (R) of the virus. Across plants, R generally ranged between 2 and 4 during the initial phase, but subsequently declined to ~1 after two to three weeks, most likely as a result of implementation/compliance with biosecurity measures in combination with population immunity. Using the calibrated model to simulate a range of possible scenarios, we show that the effectiveness of routine PCR-screening at minimizing disease spread was far more influenced by testing frequency than by delays in results, R, or background community transmission rates. Testing every three days generally averted about 25% to 40% of clinical cases across a range of assumptions, while testing every 14 days typically averted 7 to 13% of clinical cases. However, the absolute number of additional clinical cases expected and averted was influenced by whether there was residual immunity from a previous peak (i.e., routine testing is implemented after the workforce had experienced an initial outbreak). In contrast, when using PCR-screening to prevent outbreaks or in the early stages of an outbreak, even frequent testing may not prevent a large outbreak within the workforce. This research helps to identify protocols that minimize risk to occupational safety and health and support continuity of business for U.S. processing plants. While the model was calibrated to meat processing plants, the structure of the model and insights about testing are generalizable to other settings where large number of people work in close proximity.","VanderWaal, K.; Black, L.; Hodge, J.; Bedada, A.; Dee, S.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.02.21249552v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.02.21249552,11

The glycans in some proteins play a pivotal role in protein folding, oligomerization, quality control, sorting, and transport so the hindering of N-linked glycosylation of glycoproteins will prevent assembly of the virion. Tunicamycin and anticancer drug inhibit the N- linked glycans. Our study aimed to find out the mechanism action of tunicamycin on the viral glycoproteins. The growth of coronavirus in the presence inhibitor tunicamycin resulted in the production of spikeless, non-infectious virions which were devoid of S protein. We concluded that tunicamycin inhibits E2, S, and M glycoproteins of coronaviruses. Tunicamycin is also diminished glycosylation od PTMs such as HE, and 8 ab of SARS-CoV.

598925,Detection and genetic analysis of porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus in South Korea,2010-11-20,"BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) targets multiple organs and causes severe coagulopathy. Histopathological organ changes might not only be attributable to a direct virus-induced effect, but also the immune response. The aims of this study were to assess the duration of viral presence, identify the extent of inflammatory response, and investigate the underlying cause of coagulopathy. METHODS: This prospective autopsy cohort study was done at Amsterdam University Medical Centers (UMC), the Netherlands. With informed consent from relatives, full body autopsy was done on 21 patients with COVID-19 for whom autopsy was requested between March 9 and May 18, 2020. In addition to histopathological evaluation of organ damage, the presence of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein and the composition of the immune infiltrate and thrombi were assessed, and all were linked to disease course. FINDINGS: Our cohort (n=21) included 16 (76%) men, and median age was 68 years (range 41–78). Median disease course (time from onset of symptoms to death) was 22 days (range 5–44 days). In 11 patients tested for SARS-CoV-2 tropism, SARS-CoV-2 infected cells were present in multiple organs, most abundantly in the lungs, but presence in the lungs became sporadic with increased disease course. Other SARS-CoV-2-positive organs included the upper respiratory tract, heart, kidneys, and gastrointestinal tract. In histological analyses of organs (sampled from nine to 21 patients per organ), an extensive inflammatory response was present in the lungs, heart, liver, kidneys, and brain. In the brain, extensive inflammation was seen in the olfactory bulbs and medulla oblongata. Thrombi and neutrophilic plugs were present in the lungs, heart, kidneys, liver, spleen, and brain and were most frequently observed late in the disease course (15 patients with thrombi, median disease course 22 days [5–44]; ten patients with neutrophilic plugs, 21 days [5–44]). Neutrophilic plugs were observed in two forms: solely composed of neutrophils with neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), or as aggregates of NETs and platelets.. INTERPRETATION: In patients with lethal COVID-19, an extensive systemic inflammatory response was present, with a continued presence of neutrophils and NETs. However, SARS-CoV-2-infected cells were only sporadically present at late stages of COVID-19. This suggests a maladaptive immune response and substantiates the evidence for immunomodulation as a target in the treatment of severe COVID-19.

However, most of the surface characterization methods are either limited to 2-dimensional measurements or not reaching to true 3D atomic-scale resolution, and single-atom level determination of the 3D surface atomic structure for general 3D nanomaterials still remains elusive. Here we show the measurement of 3D atomic structure of a Pt nanoparticle at 15 pm precision, aided by a deep learning-based missing data retrieval. The surface atomic structure was reliably measured, and we find that<100>and<111>facets contribute differently to the surface strain, resulting in anisotropic strain distribution as well as compressive support boundary effect.

In the present study, we explored and compared mutation profiles of SARS-CoV-2 isolated from mildly affected and severely affected COVID-19 patients in order to explore any relationship between mutation profile and disease severity. Genomic sequences of SARS-CoV-2 were downloaded from Global Initiative on Sharing Avian Influenza Data (GISAID) database. With the help of Genome Detective Coronavirus Typing Tool, genomic sequences were aligned with the Wuhan seafood market pneumonia virus reference sequence and all the mutations were identified. Distribution of mutant variants was then compared between mildly and severely affected groups. Among the numerous mutations detected, 14408C>T and 23403A>G mutations resulting in RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) P323L and spike protein D614G mutations, respectively, were found predominantly in severely affected group (>82%) compared with mildly affected group (<46%, p < 0.001).

High on the list were the Baltic countries, which sit precariously on the edge of Europe and historically have been the “bloodlands” between East and West in author Timothy Snyder's phrasing. More specifically, journalists and analysts pointed to the “Russian enclaves” in northeastern Estonia and southeastern Latvia, where, by many accounts, large ethnic Russian populations were prepared to rise up against Baltic governments with a bit of provocation from across the eastern border. However, six years on, there is little indication that Russian speakers in the Baltic countries are on the brink of causing an internal uprising.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the preparedness and capacity of palliative care services in the Middle-East and North Africa region to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A cross-sectional online survey was undertaken, with items addressing the WHO International Health Regulations. Non-probabilistic sampling was used, and descriptive analyses were conducted. RESULTS: Responses from 43 services in 12 countries were analysed. Half of respondents were doctors (53%), and services were predominantly hospital-based (84%). All but one services had modified at least one procedure to respond to COVID-19. Do Not Resuscitate (DNR) policies were modified by a third (30%) and unavailable for a fifth (23%). While handwashing facilities at points of entry were available (98%), a third had concerns over accessing disinfectant products (37%), soap (35%), or running water (33%). The majority had capacity to use technology to provide remote care (86%) and contact lists of patients and staff (93%), though only two-fifths had relatives’ details (37%). Respondents reported high staff anxiety about becoming infected themselves (median score 8 on 1-10 scale), but only half of services had a stress management procedure (53%). Three-fifths had plans to support triaging COVID-19 patients (60%) and protocols to share (58%).

Furthermore, no studies investigated the variables that may modulate the efficacy of vaccination. The aim of this analysis was to assess whether there are modifying factors that may potentially influence the clinical efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines. A quantitative synthesis of data from Phase III trials was performed via pairwise and network meta-analyses, along with meta-regression analysis. Data from Phase III trials are currently available only for AZD1222, BNT162b2, mRNA-1237, and Sputnik V. Vaccination resulted to be generally effective (90.0%, 95%CI 72.6–96.4; p < 0.001), although the efficacy of AZD1222 (62.1%) introduced a significant level of heterogeneity in the meta-analysis (I(2) 92.17%, p < 0.001). No significant modifying factors resulted from the meta-regression analysis. However, considering the mRNA-based vaccines, a trend toward significance (p = 0.081) resulted for age. The network meta-analysis provided the following rank of effectiveness: BNT162b2 ≃ mRNA-1273 > Sputnik V >> AZD1222.

It predominantly infects pneumocytes of the respiratory tract, but due to the presence of angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2) on other cells like surface enterocytes of the upper esophagus and colon, these are also considered as the primary sites of infection. ACE2 receptor served as a cellular entry point for SARS-CoV-2. The expression of the ACE2 receptors is regulated by several factors such as age, tobacco smoking, inflammatory signaling, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and comorbidities (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), tuberculosis, cerebrovascular disease, coronary heart disease, hypertension, and diabetes). Therefore, scientists are trying to explore the in-depth knowledge of ACE2 and considered it as a potential indirect target for COVID-19 therapeutics. In this focused review, we discussed in detail ACE2 expressions and regulation by different factors in the primary or vulnerable sites of SARS-CoV-2 infections.

Design: Retrospective comparative study. Setting: Three university hospitals in Biscay province (Basque Country, Spain). Patients: 77 patients over 65 years-old with PFF (AO 31-A and 31-B). Intervention: Study conducted between 9 March and 15 April 2020. The COVID-19 group included only patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, confirmed by a positive RT-PCR test. Main outcome measurements: 30-day mortality rate and risk factors for mortality. Results: Of a total 77 patients, 10 were diagnosed with SARS CoV-2 infection. Mean age was 85 years. Patients with SARS-Cov-2 infection had higher BMI (29.53 kg/m²) compared to patients without infection (24.09 kg/m²) (p=0.001). No significant differences were found between both groups in terms of the Charlson Comorbidity Index, ASA score, use of oral anticoagulants or presence of cognitive impairment. Seven of the 10 patients in the COVID-19 group developed (viral) pneumonia, as compared to one single case (1/67) of (bacterial) pneumonia in the control group (p< 0.001). Thirty-days mortality was higher (p=0.03) in COVID-19 patients (40%) than in those in the control group (11.9%). In the multivariate analysis, age ≥91 years-old, ASA class IV and BMI >25 kg/m2 were significant predictors of 30-day mortality. All deaths in the COVID-19 group occurred while the patients were hospitalized. Conclusions: SARS CoV-2 infection in patients with a PFF was seen to result in higher rates of early mortality, with COVID-19-related pneumonia being the leading direct cause of mortality. Objetivos: Comparar la tasa de mortalidad a 30 días en pacientes con fractura de fémur proximal (FFP) y coinfección por SARS-CoV-2 frente a FFP sin coinfección. Diseño: Estudio retrospectivo comparativo. Escenario: Tres hospitales universitarios en Vizcaya (País Vasco, España). Pacientes: 77 pacientes mayores de 65 años con FFP (AO 31-A y 31-B). Intervención: Entre el 9 de Marzo y 15 de Abril de 2020. El grupo COVID-19 incluía pacientes con infección confirmada mediante test PCR-RT. Medidas de resultados principales: Tasa de mortalidad a 30 días y factores de riesgo de mortalidad. Resultados: 10 de los 77 pacientes presentaron coinfección por SARS CoV-2. La edad media fue 85 años. Los pacientes infectados presentaban un IMC mayor (29,53 kg/m²) frente a los no infectados (24,09 kg/m²) (p=0,001). No hubo diferencias significativas en el índice de comorbilidad de Charlson, la puntuación ASA, el uso de anticoagulantes o el deterioro cognitivo. Siete pacientes del grupo COVID-19 (7/10) desarrollaron neumonía (vírica), frente a un solo caso (1/67) de neumonía (bacteriana) en el grupo control (p<0,001).

608571,Physico‐Chemical Properties of Mouse Hepatitis Virus (MHV‐2) Grown on DBT Cell Culture,2013-11-14,"BACKGROUND: The Mediterranean diet is considered one of the healthier food habits and olive oil is one of its key components. Olive oil polyphenols are known to induce beneficial effects in several pathological conditions, such as inflammatory bowel disease, and to contrast the proliferation of cancer cells or hypercholesterolemia. Polyphenols are also present in waste products derived from the olive industry: olive mill wastewaters (OMWW) are rich in polyphenols and there is an increasing interest in using OMWW in animal nutrition. OMWW are attributed with positive effects in promoting chicken performance and the quality of food-derived products. However, a tissue-specific transcriptome target analysis of chickens fed with OMWW has never been attempted. RESULTS: We explored the effect of dietary OMWW on the intestinal function in broilers. A morphological analysis of the jejunum revealed that OMWW reduced crypt depth, whereas no significant modifications were observed for villus height and the villus height/crypt depth ratio. An RNA Sequencing analysis was performed on isolated, intestinal, epithelial cells and 280 differentially expressed genes were found using a count-based approach. An enrichment analysis revealed that the majority of up regulated genes in the OMWW group were over-represented by the regulation of viral genome replication-related GO-Terms, whereas down regulated genes were mainly involved in cholesterol and lipid metabolism. CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed how an industrial waste product can be recycled as a feed additive with a positive relapse. OMWW dietary supplementation can be a nutritional strategy to improve chicken performance and health, prevent intestinal damage, enhance innate immunity and regulate cholesterol metabolism and fat deposition.

On the basis of several parameters, children affected by neuroblastoma are stratified into low, intermediate and high risk. At present, more than 50% of high-risk patients with metastatic spread display an overall poor long-term outcome also complicated by devastating long-term morbidities. Thus, novel and more effective therapies are desperately needed to improve lifespan of high-risk patients. In this regard, adoptive cell therapy holds great promise and several clinical trials are ongoing, demonstrating safety and tolerability, with no toxicities. Starting from the immunological and clinical features of neuroblastoma, we here discuss the immunotherapeutic approaches currently adopted for high-risk patients and different innovative therapeutic strategies currently under investigation. The latter are based on the infusion of natural killer (NK) cells, as support of consolidation therapy in addition to standard treatments, or chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells directed against neuroblastoma associated antigens (e.g., disialoganglioside GD2). Finally, future perspectives of adoptive cell therapies represented by γδ T lymphocyes and CAR NK cells are envisaged.","Morandi, Fabio; Sabatini, Federica; Podestà, Marina; Airoldi, Irma",Vaccines (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines9010043; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33450862/,11

Limited research has focused on individual knowledge, awareness, and preparedness of COVID-19 in postsecondary institutions in the post-COVID-19 era so far. This study aimed to explore whether students’ perceived anti-epidemic campus signals had effects on their awareness of and preparedness for COVID-19. Leveraging the data collected from full-time college students in a province located in East China and building a structural regression model, we found that students’ perceived anti-epidemic campus signals were significantly associated with their awareness of and preparedness for COVID-19. With one perceived signal decrease, there were 0.099 unit and 0.051 unit decreases in students’ awareness and preparedness, respectively. In addition, we indeed found that female students had a higher awareness and better preparedness than their male peers. These findings provided important implications for postsecondary administrators and policymakers, as well as future research.","Zhao, Teng; Zhang, Yuchen; Wu, Chao; Su, Qiang",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18179276; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34501868/,11

B.1.617.2 replaced B.1.1.7 as the dominant virus in the United Kingdom, resulting in a steep increase in new infections, and a similar development is expected for other countries. Effective countermeasures require information on susceptibility of B.1.617.2 to control by antibodies elicited by vaccines and used for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) therapy. We show, using pseudotyping, that B.1.617.2 evades control by antibodies induced upon infection and BNT162b2 vaccination, although to a lesser extent as compared to B.1.351. We find that B.1.617.2 is resistant against bamlanivimab, a monoclonal antibody with emergency use authorization for COVID-19 therapy. Finally, we show increased Calu-3 lung cell entry and enhanced cell-to-cell fusion of B.1.617.2, which may contribute to augmented transmissibility and pathogenicity of this variant.

The COVID-19 pandemic may have impacted on global children’s cancer services, which can have consequences for childhood cancer outcomes. The Global Health Research Group on Children’s Non-Communicable Diseases is currently undertaking the first international cohort study to determine the variation in paediatric cancer management during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the short-term to medium-term impacts on childhood cancer outcomes. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is a multicentre, international cohort study that will use routinely collected hospital data in a deidentified and anonymised form. Patients will be recruited consecutively into the study, with a 12-month follow-up period. Patients will be included if they are below the age of 18 years and undergoing anticancer treatment for the following cancers: acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, Burkitt lymphoma, Hodgkin lymphoma, Wilms tumour, sarcoma, retinoblastoma, gliomas, medulloblastomas and neuroblastomas. Patients must be newly presented or must be undergoing active anticancer treatment from 12 March 2020 to 12 December 2020. The primary objective of the study was to determine all-cause mortality rates of 30 days, 90 days and 12 months. This study will examine the factors that influenced these outcomes. χ(2) analysis will be used to compare mortality between low-income and middle-income countries and high-income countries. Multilevel, multivariable logistic regression analysis will be undertaken to identify patient-level and hospital-level factors affecting outcomes with adjustment for confounding factors. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: At the host centre, this study was deemed to be exempt from ethical committee approval due to the use of anonymised registry data. At other centres, participating collaborators have gained local approvals in accordance with their institutional ethical regulations. Collaborators will be encouraged to present the results locally, nationally and internationally. The results will be submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal.","Peter, Noel; Bandyopadhyay, Soham; Lakhoo, Kokila",BMJ Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34083337/; https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-045679,11
614140,Defective interfering particles of mouse hepatitis virus,1984-02-29,"BACKGROUND: Urethral injury or erosion of an inflatable penile prosthetic (IPP) cylinder is a rare complication of IPP placement. It can present with varying symptoms and management can be difficult with risk for future complications. We present a patient with an eroded IPP who developed a secondary contralateral urethrocavernous fistula requiring repeat urethroplasty. We also describe the literature surrounding these complications and strategies to prevent them. CASE PRESENTATION: A 69-year-old man with poorly controlled diabetes presented to our clinic with 6 months of intermittent white urethral discharge first noted after IPP removal and replacement by an outside urologist for device malfunction. Office cystoscopy revealed an eroded right-sided prosthetic cylinder in the bulbar urethra. The patient was taken to the operating room for IPP explantation with closure of right corporal defect, left sided malleable prosthesis placement, and primary excision with anastomosis of his bulbar urethra. A catheter was left in place for two weeks postoperatively, at which time a peri-catheter retrograde urethrogram was performed which showed no evidence of contrast extravasation and his catheter was subsequently removed. Several months later, he presented with recurrent urethral discharge without evidence of recurrent erosion on cystoscopy with development of scrotal abscesses following office cystoscopy, concerning for an unidentified urethral defect. He returned to the operating room for scrotal exploration and was noted on cystoscopy to have a pinpoint fistula between his left corporal body and his bulbar urethra. He underwent left sided malleable prosthetic explant, and non-transecting bulbar urethroplasty. Peri-catheter retrograde urethrogram two weeks later showed no contrast extravasation and he has had no recurrence of urethral discharge or scrotal abscesses since. CONCLUSIONS: Urethral erosion and urethrocavernous fistula formation are rare complications of penile prosthesis placement. Risks are elevated in patients with corporal fibrosis, diabetes, those undergoing penile implant revision surgery, and those requiring prolonged urethral catheterization.","Botkin, Hannah; Barnes, Brian; Pearlman, Amy",BMC Urol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33581719/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12894-021-00793-9,11

In situations that preclude early surgery, topical agents allow for a safer delay. Cerium nitrate compounded with silver sulfadiazine (Ce-SSD) is a burn cream that provides broad antibacterial activity, forms a temporary barrier, and promotes re-epithelialization. Methemoglobinemia is a rare, but oft-cited, systemic complication of Ce-SSD. In this retrospective review, 157 patients treated with Ce-SSD between July 2014 - July 2018 were identified and the monitoring protocol for methemoglobinemia during Ce-SSD treatment was evaluated. Median age was 59 years (IQR, 47-70.5 years), with total body surface area burn (TBSA) of 8.5% (IQR, 3-27), adjusted Baux score of 76 (IQR, 59-94), and inhalation injury present in 9.9% of patients. Primary endpoints included incidence of symptomatic and asymptomatic methemoglobinemia. Of the 9.6% (n = 15) of patients with methemoglobinemia, 73.3% (n=11) had maximum methemoglobin levels ≥ 72 hours from time of first application. One patient developed clinically significant methemoglobinemia. Patients with TBSA ≥ 20% were more likely to develop methemoglobinemia (OR 9.318, 95% CI 2.078 to 65.73, p = 0.0078), however neither Ce-SSD doses nor days of exposure were significant predictors. Ce-SSD application to temporize burn wounds until excision and grafting is safe, effective, and, in asymptomatic patients with TBSA < 20%, can be used without serial blood gas monitoring. Vigilant monitoring for symptoms should be performed in patients with TBSA ≥ 20%, but routine blood gases are not necessary.","Reese, Adam D; Keyloun, John W; Garg, Gaurav; McLawhorn, Melissa M; Moffatt, Lauren T; Travis, Taryn E; Johnson, Laura S; Shupp, Jeffrey W",J Burn Care Res,https://doi.org/10.1093/jbcr/irab180; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34543402/,11

A global response is needed to prepare health systems worldwide. Covid-19 can be diagnosed both on chest X-ray and on computed tomography (CT). Asymptomatic patients may also have lung lesions on imaging. CT investigation in patients with suspicion Covid-19 pneumonia involves the use of the high-resolution technique (HRCT). Artificial intelligence (AI) software has been employed to facilitate CT diagnosis. AI software must be useful categorizing the disease into different severities, integrating the structured report, prepared according to subjective considerations, with quantitative, objective assessments of the extent of the lesions. In this communication, we present an example of a good tool for the radiologist (Thoracic VCAR software, GE Healthcare, Italy) in Covid-19 diagnosis (Pan et al. in Radiology, 2020. 10.1148/radiol.2020200370). Thoracic VCAR offers quantitative measurements of the lung involvement. Thoracic VCAR can generate a clear, fast and concise report that communicates vital medical information to referring physicians. In the post-processing phase, software, thanks to the help of a colorimetric map, recognizes the ground glass and differentiates it from consolidation and quantifies them as a percentage with respect to the healthy parenchyma. AI software therefore allows to accurately calculate the volume of each of these areas. Therefore, keeping in mind that CT has high diagnostic sensitivity in identifying lesions, but not specific for Covid-19 and similar to other infectious viral diseases, it is mandatory to have an AI software that expresses objective evaluations of the percentage of ventilated lung parenchyma compared to the affected one.","Belfiore, Maria Paola; Urraro, Fabrizio; Grassi, Roberta; Giacobbe, Giuliana; Patelli, Gianluigi; Cappabianca, Salvatore; Reginelli, Alfonso",Radiol Med,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11547-020-01195-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32367319/,11

At present, confirmatory diagnosis is by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), typically taking several hours and requiring a molecular laboratory to perform. There is an urgent need for rapid, simplified and cost-effective detection methods. We have developed and analytically validated a protocol for direct rapid extraction-free PCR (DIRECT-PCR) detection of SARS-CoV-2 without the need for nucleic acid purification. As few as 6 RNA copies per reaction of viral nucleocapsid (N) gene from respiratory samples such as sputum and nasal exudate can be detected directly using our one-step inhibitor-resistant assay. The performance of this assay was validated on a commercially available portable PCR thermocycler. Viral lysis, reverse transcription, amplification and detection are achieved in a single-tube homogeneous reaction within 36 minutes.

Despite the fact that most COVID-19 cases and mortalities were reported in China, the WHO has declared this outbreak as the sixth public health emergency of international concern. The COVID-19 can present as an asymptomatic carrier state, acute respiratory disease, and pneumonia. Adults represent the population with the highest infection rate; however, neonates, children, and elderly patients can also be infected by SARS-CoV-2. In addition, nosocomial infection of hospitalized patients and healthcare workers, and viral transmission from asymptomatic carriers are possible. The most common finding on chest imaging among patients with pneumonia was ground-glass opacity with bilateral involvement. Severe cases are more likely to be older patients with underlying comorbidities compared to mild cases. Indeed, age and disease severity may be correlated with the outcomes of COVID-19. To date, effective treatment is lacking; however, clinical trials investigating the efficacy of several agents, including remdesivir and chloroquine, are underway in China. Currently, effective infection control intervention is the only way to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2.","Lai, Chih-Cheng; Liu, Yen Hung; Wang, Cheng-Yi; Wang, Ya-Hui; Hsueh, Shun-Chung; Yen, Muh-Yen; Ko, Wen-Chien; Hsueh, Po-Ren",J Microbiol Immunol Infect,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1684118220300402; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32173241/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1684118220300402; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmii.2020.02.012,11

There is no existing pharmaceutical treatment that is known to be effective. Preliminary data shows that San Yao San Fang (SYSF) has clinical benefits in patients with COVID-19. The aim of this paper is to review existing data regarding the use of formulas within San Yao San Fang in the treatment of COVID-19 Search Strategy: We searched through 5 databases for studies on SYSF and patients with COVID-19 through April 2020. Eligibility Criteria: We included studies that included formulas within San Yao San Fang with or without Western interventions against Western interventions. Main results: We included 7 studies involving 532 patients. SYSF combined with Western interventions improved the recovery rate of symptoms such as fever (Risk Ratio (RR) 0.40 (95% CI 0.24 to 0.66, P < 0.01)), cough (RR 0.56 (95% CI 0.38 to 0.82, P < 0.01)) and fatigue (RR 0.61 (95% CI 0.47 to 0.78, P < 0.01)) and other symptoms such as headache, gastrointestinal symptoms, myalgia, dyspnoea and chest tightness (RR 0.63 (95% CI 0.47 to 0.83, P < 0.01)) as compared to the control group. SYSF combined with Western interventions reduced the duration of fever as compared to the control group. (Mean difference (MD) -1.18 (95% CI -1.45 to -0.91, P < 0.01)) In regards to adverse events, there is no statistical difference between the treatment group and the control group. (RR 1.62 (95% CI 0.83 to 3.17, P = 0.16)). SYSF combined with Western interventions did not show to significantly reduce duration of hospitalisation as compared to the control group.

For COVID-19 patients with cardiac sequela, only a small subset of patients have myocarditis; the pathogenesis of cardiac sequela caused by SARS-CoV-2 other than microthrombi associated sequela remains to be determined. Methods Retrospective analysis of 71 heart autopsy specimens from COVID-19 and putative COVID-19 in the NIH COVID Digital Pathology Repository. Results The most consistent observation was that of localized myocardial cell death not associated with either myocarditis or microthrombi. Red blood cells were typically absent from capillaries, but when observed were predominately in linear clusters (stacks) of adjacent cells. Conclusions Based on our retrospective analysis, we propose that localized ischemia and subsequent cell death by anoxia contributes to the cardiac pathogenesis in some COVID-19 patients. We propose two new models predicting vasoconstriction of cardiac pericyte cells induced by elevated histamine from hyper-activated mast cells or by direct infection. We propose that impeded blood flow and cell death by anoxia are initial steps in the development of SARS-CoV-2 induced cardiac injury in COVID-19 patients independent of microthrombi or myocarditis.","Fremont-Smith, Maurice; Gherlone, Nicole; Smith, Nora; Tisdall, Philip; Ricke, Darrell O.",Int J Infect Dis,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971221007633?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2021.09.052; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34592443/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1201971221007633,11

Despite global efforts, it continues to cause great losses, and leaving multiple unknowns that we must resolve in order to face the pandemic more effectively. One of the questions that has arisen recently is what happens, after recovering from COVID-19. For this reason, the objective of this study is to identify the risk of presenting persistent symptoms in recovered from COVID-19. This case-control study was conducted in one state of Mexico. Initially the data were obtained from the participants, through a questionnaire about symptoms that they had at the moment of the interview. Initially were captured the collected data, to make a dataset. After the pre-processed using the R project tool to eliminate outliers or missing data. Obtained finally a total of 219 participants, 141 recovered and 78 controls. It was used confidence level of 90% and a margin of error of 7%. From results it was obtained that all symptoms have an associated risk in those recovered. The relative risk of the selected symptoms in the recovered patients goes from 3 to 22 times, being infinite for the case of dyspnea, due to the fact that there is no control that presents this symptom at the moment of the interview, followed by the nausea and the anosmia with a RR of 8.5. Therefore, public health strategies must be rethought, to treat or rehabilitate, avoiding chronic problems in patients recovered from COVID-19.","Galván-Tejada, Carlos E.; Herrera-García, Cintya Fabiola; Godina-González, Susana; Villagrana-Bañuelos, Karen E.; Amaro, Juan Daniel De Luna; Herrera-García, Karla; Rodríguez-Quiñones, Carolina; Zanella-Calzada, Laura A.; Ramírez-Barranco, Julio; de Avila, Jocelyn L.

623391,A recombinant infectious bronchitis virus from a chicken with a spike gene closely related to that of a turkey coronavirus,2020-01-25,"BACKGROUND: Whether or not to administer antibiotics is a common and challenging clinical decision in patients with suspected infections presenting to the emergency department (ED). We prospectively validate InSep, a 29-mRNA blood-based host response test for the prediction of bacterial and viral infections. METHODS: The PROMPT trial is a prospective, non-interventional, multi-center clinical study that enrolled 397 adult patients presenting to the ED with signs of acute infection and at least one vital sign change. The infection status was adjudicated using chart review (including a syndromic molecular respiratory panel, procalcitonin and C-reactive protein) by three infectious disease physicians blinded to InSep results. InSep (version BVN-2) was performed using PAXgene Blood RNA processed and quantified on NanoString nCounter SPRINT. InSep results (likelihood of bacterial and viral infection) were compared to the adjudicated infection status. RESULTS: Subject mean age was 64 years, comorbidities were significant for diabetes (17.1%), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (13.6%), and severe neurological disease (6.8%); 16.9% of subjects were immunocompromised. Infections were adjudicated as bacterial (14.1%), viral (11.3%) and noninfected (0.25%): 74.1% of subjects were adjudicated as indeterminate. InSep distinguished bacterial vs. viral/noninfected patients and viral vs. bacterial/noninfected patients using consensus adjudication with AUROCs of 0.94 (95% CI 0.90–0.99) and 0.90 (95% CI 0.83–0.96), respectively. AUROCs for bacterial vs. viral/noninfected patients were 0.88 (95% CI 0.79–0.96) for PCT, 0.80 (95% CI 0.72–89) for CRP and 0.78 (95% CI 0.69–0.87) for white blood cell counts (of note, the latter biomarkers were provided as part of clinical adjudication). To enable clinical actionability, InSep incorporates score cutoffs to allocate patients into interpretation bands. The Very Likely (rule in) InSep bacterial band showed a specificity of 98% compared to 94% for the corresponding PCT band (> 0.5 µg/L); the Very Unlikely (rule-out) band showed a sensitivity of 95% for InSep compared to 86% for PCT. For the detection of viral infections, InSep demonstrated a specificity of 93% for the Very Likely band (rule in) and a sensitivity of 96% for the Very Unlikely band (rule out). CONCLUSIONS: InSep demonstrated high accuracy for predicting the presence of both bacterial and viral infections in ED patients with suspected acute infections or suspected sepsis. When translated into a rapid, point-of-care test, InSep will provide ED physicians with actionable results supporting early informed treatment decisions to improve patient outcomes while upholding antimicrobial stewardship.

623600,Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus: Molecular mechanisms of attenuation and vaccines,2020-10-01,"Bovine respiratory disease (BRD) complex is an important viral infection that causes huge economic losses in cattle herds worldwide. However, there is no directly effective antiviral drug application against respiratory viral pathogens; generally, the metaphylactic antibacterial drug applications are used for BRD. Ivermectin (IVM) is currently used as a broad-spectrum anti-parasitic agent both for veterinary and human medicine on some occasions. Moreover, since it is identified as an inhibitor for importin α/β-mediated nuclear localization signal (NLS), IVM is also reported to have antiviral potential against several RNA and DNA viruses. Since therapeutic use of IVM in COVID-19 cases has recently been postulated, the potential antiviral activity against bovine respiratory viruses including BRSV, BPIV-3, BoHV-1, BCoV and BVDV are evaluated in this study. For these purposes, virus titration assay was used to evaluate titers in viral harvest from infected cells treated with non-cytotoxic IVM concentrations (1, 2.5 and 5 μM) and compared to titers from non-treated infected cells. This study indicated that IVM inhibits the replication of BCoV, BVDV, BRSV and BoHV-1 in a dose-dependent manner in vitro as well as number of extracellular infectious virions, but it has no importantly strong antiviral effect against extracellular shedding of BPIV-3. In addition, it was demonstrated that IVM has no clear effect on the attachment and penetration steps of the replication of the studied viruses. Finally, this study shows for the first time that IVM can inhibit infection of BRD-related viral agents namely BCoV, BVDV, BRSV and BoHV-1 at the concentrations of 2.5 and 5 μM. Consequently, IVM, which is licensed for antiparasitic indications, also deserves to be evaluated as a broad-spectrum antiviral in BRD caused by viral pathogens.","Yesilbag, Kadir; Toker, Eda Baldan; Ates, Ozer",Virus Res,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170221000915; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33713753/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170221000915?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2021.198384,11

This study assessed a short-term evolution of vitamin D status and its influence upon different clinical parameters in critically ill patients with COVID-19. Methods: A prospective analytical study in which 37 critically ill volunteers between 41 and 71 years of age with COVID-19 were evaluated at baseline and three days of intensive care unit (ICU) stay. 25-OH-D(3) and 25-OH-D(2) were analyzed by liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry and total 25-OH-D levels were calculated as the sum of both. Results: All patients presented low 25-OH-D levels at baseline, decreasing total 25-OH-D (p = 0.011) mainly through 25-OH-D(2) (p = 0.006) levels during ICU stay. 25-OH-D(2) levels decreased a mean of 41.6% ± 89.6% versus 7.0% ± 23.4% for the 25-OH-D(3) form during the ICU stay. Patients who did not need invasive mechanical ventilation presented higher levels of 25-OH-D(2) at baseline and follow-up. Lower 25-OH-D and 25-OH-D(3) levels were associated with higher D-dimer at baseline (p = 0.003; p = 0.001) and at follow up (p = 0.029), higher procalcitonin levels (p = 0.002; p = 0.018) at follow up, and lower percentage lymphocyte counts (p = 0.044; p = 0.040) during ICU stay. Conclusions: Deficient vitamin D status in critical patients was established at the admission and further worsened after three days of stay. Lower vitamin D levels were related to key altered clinical and biochemical parameters on patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Formidable challenges limit precautionary measures which were instituted by the government to curb the pandemic. Insufficient COVID-19 testing laboratories, limited medical and personal protective equipment, and an inadequate number of health workers leave the country ill-equipped in the fight against the pandemic. Lack of assistance from the government to those who lost their jobs due to lockdown forced these individuals to go outside to find provisions, thus increasing the spread of the virus. Moreover, the fragile healthcare system is overburdened by civil conflicts and other epidemics and endemics amid the COVID-19 pandemic. The conflicts have led to thousands of deaths and hundreds of thousands of displacements and deprived many people of basic health services. The 11th outbreak of Ebola has been increasing at an alarming pace, and it is expected to soar because of a shortfall of funds and insufficient numbers of health workers. The DRC with the cooperation of regional powers needs to address these challenges in a manner similar to that used in the previous Ebola epidemics. Moreover, the government should have a balance in shifting the available resources between COVID-19 and other diseases.

The disease has no efficient drugs. However, previous studies revealed that SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV have 96% and 86.5% similarities in cysteine proteases (3CLpro) and papain-like protease (PLpro) sequences, respectively. This resemblance could be significant in the search for drug candidates with antiviral effects against SARS-CoV-2. OBJECTIVE This paper is a compilation of natural products that inhibit SARS-CoV 3CLpro and PLpro and, concomitantly, reduce inflammation and/or modulate the immune system as a perspective strategy for COVID-19 drug discovery. It also presents in silico studies performed on these selected natural products using SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro and PLpro as targets to propose a list of hit compounds. METHOD The plant metabolites were selected in the literature based on their biological activities on SARS-CoV proteins, inflammatory mediators, and immune response. The consensus docking analysis was performed using four different packages. RESULTS Seventy-nine compounds reported in the literature with inhibitory effects on SARS-CoV proteins were reported as anti-inflammatory agents. Fourteen of them showed in previous studies immunomodulatory effects. Five and six of these compounds showed significant in silico consensus as drug candidates that can inhibit PLpro and 3CLpro, respectively. Our findings corroborated recent results reported on anti-SARS-CoV-2 in the literature.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention continues to report more morbidity and mortality in adults than in children. Early in Pandemic, there was a concern that patients with asthma would be affected disproportionately from COVID-19, but this was not manifested. It is now recognized that angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptors that are used by the coronavirus for infection have low expression in children with atopy that may contribute to decreased infectivity in children who are atopic. There are several early reports of decreased emergency department (ED) visits for children with asthma. The authors previously reported a decrease in pediatric ED visits in the spring of 2020, which correlated with school closure. Objective: To determine if this trend of decreased ED visits for pediatric asthma was sustained throughout the first COVID-19 pandemic year. Methods: ED data from one inner city children's hospital were collected by using standard medical claims codes. Conclusion: We reported a sustained year of decreased ED visits for children with asthma in one pediatric ED in an inner-city hospital; this seemed to be secondary to school closure and decreased exposure to upper respiratory infections.","Arsenault, Samantha; Hoofman, Jacob; Poowuttikul, Pavadee; Secord, Elizabeth",Allergy and asthma proceedings,https://doi.org/10.2500/aap.2021.42.210059; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34474709/,11

Alongside such conventional dosing, administration of 1 gm of methylprednisolone daily (pulse dosing) has also been reported in the literature with claims of favorable outcomes. Comparisons between such disparate approaches to corticosteroids for Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia are lacking. In this retrospective study of patients admitted to the ICU with COVID-19 pneumonia, we compared patients treated with 0.5-2 mg/kg/day in methylprednisolone equivalents (high-dose corticosteroids) and patients treated with 1 gm of methylprednisolone (pulse-dose corticosteroids) to those who did not receive any corticosteroids. The endpoints of interest were hospital mortality, ICU-free days at Day 28, and complications potentially attributable to corticosteroids. Pulse-dose corticosteroid therapy was associated with a significant increase in ICU-free days at Day 28 compared to no receipt: adjusted relative risk (aRR): 1.45 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.05-2.02; p = 0.03) and compared with high-dose corticosteroid administration (p = 0.003). Nonetheless, receipt of high-dose corticosteroids-but not of pulse-dose corticosteroids-significantly reduced the odds of hospital mortality compared to no receipt: adjusted Odds ratio (aOR) 0.31 (95% CI: 0.12-0.77; p = 0.01). High-dose corticosteroids reduced mortality compared to pulse-dose corticosteroids (p = 0.04). Pulse-dose corticosteroids-but not high-dose corticosteroids-significantly increased the odds of acute kidney injury requiring renal replacement therapy compared to no receipt: aOR 3.53 (95% CI: 1.27-9.82; p = 0.02). The odds of this complication were also significantly higher in the pulse-dose group when compared to the high-dose group (p = 0.05 for the comparison). In this single-center study, pulse-dose corticosteroid therapy for COVID-19 pneumonia in the ICU was associated with an increase in ICU-free days but failed to impact hospital mortality, perhaps because of its association with development of severe renal failure. In line with existing trial data, the effect of high-dose corticosteroids on mortality was favorable.","Yaqoob, Hamid; Greenberg, Daniel; Hwang, Frank; Lee, Curtis; Vernik, David; Manglani, Ravi; Wang, Zhen; Murad, M Hassan; Chandy, Dipak; Epelbaum, Oleg",J. med. virol,https://doi.org/10.1002/jmv.27351; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34542192/,11
630393,Expression of Hemagglutinin/Esterase by a Mouse Hepatitis Virus Coronavirus Defective–Interfering RNA Alters Viral Pathogenesis,1998-03-01,"Background Most respiratory viruses show pronounced seasonality, but for SARS-CoV-2 this still needs to be documented. Methods We examined the disease progression of COVID-19 in 6,911 patients admitted to hospitals in Europe and China. In addition, we evaluated progress of disease symptoms in 37,187 individuals reporting symptoms into the COVID Symptom Study application. Findings Meta-analysis of the mortality risk in eight European hospitals estimated odds ratios per one day increase in the admission date to be 0.981 (0.973-0.988, p<0.001) and per increase in ambient temperature of one degree Celsius to be 0.854 (0.773-0.944, p=0.007). Statistically significant decreases of comparable magnitude in median hospital stay, probability of transfer to Intensive Care Unit and need for mechanical ventilation were also observed in most, but not all hospitals. The analysis of individually reported symptoms of 37,187 individuals in the UK also showed the decrease in symptom duration and disease severity with time. Interpretation Severity of COVID-19 in Europe decreased significantly between March and May and the seasonality of COVID-19 is the most likely explanation. Mucosal barrier and mucociliary clearance can significantly decrease viral load and disease progression, and their inactivation by low relative humidity of indoor air might significantly contribute to severity of the disease.","Kifer, D.; Bugada, D.; Villar-Garcia, J.; Gudelj, I.; Menni, C.; Sudre, C.

631073,A porcine epidemic diarrhea virus strain with distinct characteristics of four amino acid insertion in the COE region of spike protein,2020-12-13,"BACKGROUND: Studies on the fusion-inhibitory peptides derived from the heptad repeat 1 and 2 (HR1 and HR2) regions of the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein gp41 provided crucial information on the viral fusogenic mechanism. We used a similar approach to study the fusogenic mechanism of severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV). METHODS: We tested the inhibitory activity against infection of two sets of peptides corresponding to sequences of SARS-CoV spike protein HR1 and HR2 regions and investigated the interactions between the HR1 and HR2 peptides by surface plasmon resonance, sedimentation equilibration analysis, circular dichroism, native polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis, size exclusion high-performance liquid chromatography, and computer-aided homology modelling and molecule docking analysis. FINDINGS: One peptide, CP-1, derived from the HR2 region, inhibited SARS-CoV infection in the micromolar range. CP-1 bound with high affinity to a peptide from the HR1 region, NP-1. CP-1 alone had low -helicity and self-associated to form a trimer in phosphate buffer (pH 7·2). CP-1 and NP-1 mixed in equimolar concentrations formed a six-helix bundle, similar to the fusogenic core structure of HIV-1 gp41. INTERPRETATION: After binding to the target cell, the transmembrane spike protein might change conformation by association between the HR1 and HR2 regions to form an oligomeric structure, leading to fusion between the viral and target-cell membranes. At the prefusion intermediate state, CP-1 could bind to the HR1 region and interfere with the conformational changes, resulting in inhibition of SARS-CoV fusion with the target cells. CP-1 might be modifiable to increase its anti-SARS-CoV activity and could be further developed as an antiviral agent for treatment or prophylaxis of SARS-CoV infection.","Liu, Shuwen; Xiao, Gengfu; Chen, Yibang; He, Yuxian; Niu, Jinkui; Escalante, Carlos R; Xiong, Huabao; Farmar, James; Debnath, Asim K; Tien, Po; Jiang, Shibo",Lancet,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15043961/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0140673604157887; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673604157887,11

We aimed to assess moving CHG bathing into routine practice using a human factors approach. We evaluated implementation in non-intensive care unit (ICU) settings in the Veterans Health Administration. METHODS: Our multiple case study approach included non-ICU units from 4 Veterans Health Administration settings. Guided by the Systems Engineering Initiative for Patient Safety, we conducted focus groups and interviews to capture barriers and facilitators to daily CHG bathing. We measured compliance using observations and skin CHG concentrations. RESULTS: Barriers to daily CHG include time, concern of increasing antibiotic resistance, workflow and product concerns. Facilitators include engagement of champions and unit shared responsibility. We found shortfalls in patient education, hand hygiene and CHG use on tubes and drains. CHG skin concentration levels were highest among patients from spinal cord injury units. These units applied antiseptic using 2% CHG impregnated wipes vs 4% CHG solution/soap. DISCUSSION: Non-ICUs implementing CHG bathing must consider human factors and work system barriers to ensure uptake and sustained practice change. CONCLUSIONS: Well-planned rollouts and a unit culture promoting shared responsibility are key to compliance with daily CHG bathing. Successful implementation requires attention to staff education and measurement of compliance.","Knobloch, Mary Jo; Musuuza, Jackson S; McKinley, Linda; Zimbric, Michele L; Baubie, Kelsey; Hundt, Ann Schoofs; Carayon, Pascale; Hagle, Mary; Pfeiffer, Christopher D; Galea, Marinella D; Crnich, Christopher J; Safdar, Nasia",Am J Infect Control,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajic.2020.12.012; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33359552/,11

While the main route for the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus is person to person from respiratory droplets, survival of the virus in the air and its ability to infect subsequently have raised concerns. COVID-19 outbreaks in meat and other food processing plants raise concern for potential of foodborne spread. We focus on the survivability of the virus in the food subjected to various unit operations during processing, storage and distribution and the risk to consumers. While the risk of contamination of food products is possibly due to survival of the virus in the air in food processing operations if preventive measures are not followed, survival of the virus on fresh foods is dependent on the intrinsic and extrinsic properties of the specific foods and antimicrobial interventions used during production. Even if the virus remains infective on contaminated foods, maintenance of infectivity after ingestion of food and subsequent invasion of tissue has not been reported. An alternate route of infection from contaminated foods can be during handling of foods and subsequent spread of the virus to other surfaces such as face, nose, leading to infection. However, due to the extensive treatments foods receive during processing, often inhospitable environs of the food products and further food preparation prior to consumption significantly reduce the risk of transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.","Thippareddi, Harshavardhan; Balamurugan, S.; Patel, Jitendra; Singh, Manpreet; Brassard, Julie",Lebensm Wiss Technol,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0023643820311361?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0023643820311361; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32921811/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2020.110147,11

We use data principally from the World Bank Indicators covering the period 1990–2016 to study the nexus among biomass utilization, economic growth, and CO(2) emission based on the moderating role of biotechnology in China. On the basis of the results of our preliminary tests, we apply the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) for this analysis and employ the nonlinear autoregressive distributed lag (NARDL) as a robust check and also deploy the vector error correction model (VECM) to determine the direction of causality. We find that long-run relationship exists among the factors in this study. We additionally find that biotechnology has a critical but negative relationship with CO(2) emission in China. Through hierarchical multiple regression analysis and PROCESS macro for mediation, moderation, and conditional process, we establish that biotechnology significantly moderates the relationship between biomass utilization and CO(2) emission in China. Again, we discover that biomass utilization significantly decreases CO(2) emission in China. Through the ARDL, NARDL, and VECM, we find empirical support for the growth hypothesis in China. We conduct a series of diagnostic tests that prove the robustness of our estimates. Based on our empirical evidence, this study recommends that China seeks sustainable economic development and environmental sustainability simultaneously by prioritizing biomass utilization and biotechnological innovation in the country.","Quacoe, Daniel; Wen, Xuezhou; Quacoe, Dinah",Environ Sci Pollut Res Int,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33244690/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-020-11495-4,11

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the prognostic impact of chest X-ray (CXR) score, frailty, and clinical and laboratory data on in-hospital mortality of hospitalized older patients with COVID-19. Methods. This retrospective study included 122 patients 65 years or older with positive reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) and with availability to CXRs on admission. The primary outcome of the study was in-hospital mortality. Statistical analysis was conducted using Cox regression. The predictive ability of the CXR score was compared with the Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) and fever data using Area Under the Curve (AUC) and net reclassification improvement (NRI) statistics. Results. Of 122 patients, 67 died during hospital stay (54.9%). The CXR score (HR: 1.16, 95% CI, 1.04–1.28), CFS (HR: 1.27; 95% CI, 1.09–1.47), and presence of fever (HR: 1.75; 95% CI, 1.03–2.97) were significant predictors of in-hospital mortality.

Cough is a normal physiological defensive reflex responsible for keeping the airways free of obstruction and harmful substances. However, cough is also the most frequent symptom of acute respiratory system diseases and is the most common reason why sick patients visit physicians. The largest diagnostic group associated with chronic cough is asthma or asthma-like syndromes and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Furthermore, gastroesophageal reflux, rhinitis/postnasal drip syndrome and unpleasant side effects accompanying the therapy with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) represent other causes of chronic cough. The cough reflex may be elicited by the activation of receptors of non-myelinated nociceptive Aδ-fibers and C-fibers and receptors of myelinated Aδ-fibers distributed throughout the respiratory tract. In recent times as proper cough receptors are thought to be rapidly adapting receptors (RARs) of myelinated fibers, C-fibers and transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) localize on the non-myelinated fibers. As the pathological cough (especially its chronic form) has significant impact on patient's quality of life, observed either in physical activity or psychosocial domain, various treatment attitudes are used for different forms of cough (acute, subacute, chronic, productive, nonproductive, psychogenic, asthma-associated, or painful). Interest of research in this field is accompanied with the fact, that many antitussive drugs (mainly from the opioid group), which have been the antitussives of choice for decades, are limited by their unpleasant and very often adverse reactions. In this chapter the authors divided the drugs used in the pharmacological treatment of cough into several groups. These include the drugs acting at the level of receptors, the drugs affecting the propagation of cough impulses in afferent nerves, the drugs modulating the central coordination of cough reflex, the drugs acting at the level of efferent nerves, and the drugs affecting the effectors. Efficacy of many antitussive agents is connected with their influence on more than one level of cough reflex. Another group used in the therapy of cough are mucoactive substances that change the dry, irritant and nonproductive cough into the so-called productive cough with nonirritating expectoration. The last-mentioned group in this chapter is demulcerative and hydrating drugs, which can create a defense layer protecting the mucous membranes from other irritant stimuli.","Nosalova, Gabriela; Mokry, Juraj; Franova, Sona",Advances in Phytomedicine,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1572557X05020064; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1572557X05020064,11
635954,Innate and adaptive immunity against Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus,2015-09-15,"PURPOSE: To determine risk factors for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in healthcare workers (HCWs), characterize symptoms, and evaluate preventive measures against SARS-CoV-2 spread in hospitals. METHODS: In a cross-sectional study conducted between May 27 and August 12, 2020, after the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, we obtained serological, epidemiological, occupational as well as COVID-19-related data at a quaternary care, multicenter hospital in Munich, Germany. RESULTS: 7554 HCWs participated, 2.2% of whom tested positive for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Multivariate analysis revealed increased COVID-19 risk for nurses (3.1% seropositivity, 95% CI 2.5–3.9%, p = 0.012), staff working on COVID-19 units (4.6% seropositivity, 95% CI 3.2–6.5%, p = 0.032), males (2.4% seropositivity, 95% CI 1.8–3.2%, p = 0.019), and HCWs reporting high-risk exposures to infected patients (5.5% seropositivity, 95% CI 4.0–7.5%, p = 0.0022) or outside of work (12.0% seropositivity, 95% CI 8.0–17.4%, p < 0.0001). Smoking was a protective factor (1.1% seropositivity, 95% CI 0.7–1.8% p = 0.00018) and the symptom taste disorder was strongly associated with COVID-19 (29.8% seropositivity, 95% CI 24.3–35.8%, p < 0.0001). An unbiased decision tree identified subgroups with different risk profiles. Working from home as a preventive measure did not protect against SARS-CoV-2 infection. A PCR-testing strategy focused on symptoms and high-risk exposures detected all larger COVID-19 outbreaks. CONCLUSION: Awareness of the identified COVID-19 risk factors and successful surveillance strategies are key to protecting HCWs against SARS-CoV-2, especially in settings with limited vaccination capacities or reduced vaccine efficacy.

637170,The influence of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus on pig small intestine mucosal epithelial cell function,2018-10-04,"The purpose of this study is to investigate physicians’ knowledge, attitudes and practice of generic medicine substitutions in China. We conducted a cross-sectional online questionnaire survey on physicians from secondary or tertiary hospitals in China from 2020 December to 2021 April. Descriptive statistical and ordered logistic regression were used for analysis. A total of 1225 physicians were included in the final analysis, and only 330 (26.94%) of them scored 4 or above in the knowledge part, which means that the physicians have a good knowledge of generic substitutions. Of the total, 586 (47.83%) agreed or strongly agreed that generic drugs could be substituted for originator drugs and 585 (47.75%) always or often prescribed generic medicines. The percentage of physicians with a positive attitude toward or that practice prescribing generic medicine is below 50%, which needs to be improved in China. Physicians’ knowledge, their attitude toward generic substitution, if familiar with the policy of generic substitution, and incentives for prescribing generic medicines are influencing factors for the practice of generic substitution. Our studies show that the practice of generic substitution by physicians could be improved by several measures in China. We suggested that the physicians should be taught more about the bulk-buy policy and the generic-originator equivalence evaluation policy. Moreover, government incentives to promote generic substitution should be established. Our study also suggested that physicians with less working experience and female physicians should learn more about generic substitution.","Zhao, Mingyue; Zhang, Lingyi; Feng, Zhitong; Fang, Yu",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18157749; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34360043/,11

Given the rapid deterioration of patients' condition before death, markers with efficient prognostic values are urgently required. During the treatment process, notable changes in plasma potassium levels have been observed among severely ill patients. We aimed to evaluate the association between average plasma potassium (K(a)(+)) levels during hospitalization and 30-day mortality in patients with COVID-19. Methods: Consecutive patients with COVID-19 hospitalized in the Zhongfaxincheng branch of Tongji Hospital in Wuhan, China from February 8 to 28, 2020 were enrolled in this study. We followed patients up to 30 days after admission. Results: A total of 136 patients were included in the study. The average age was 62.1±14.6 years and 51.5% of patients were male. The median baseline potassium level was 4.3 (3.9-4.6) mmol/L and K(a)(+) level during hospitalization was 4.4 (4.2-4.7) mmol/L; the median number of times that we measured potassium was 4 (3-5). The 30-day mortality was 19.1%. A J-shaped association was observed between K(a)(+) and 30-day mortality. Multivariate Cox regression showed that compared with the reference group (K(a)(+) 4.0 to <4.5 mmol/L), 30-day mortality was 1.99 (95% confidence interval [CI]=0.54-7.35, P=0.300), 1.14 (95% CI=0.39-3.32, P=0.810), and 4.14 (95% CI=1.29-13.29, P=0.017) times higher in patients with COVID-19 who had K(a)(+) <4.0, 4.5 to <5.0, and ≥5.0 mmol/L, respectively. Conclusion: Patients with COVID-19 who had a K(a)(+) level ≥5.0 mmol/L had a significantly increased 30-day mortality compared with those who had a K(a)(+) level 4.0 to <4.5 mmol/L. Plasma potassium levels should be monitored routinely and maintained within appropriate ranges in patients with COVID-19.","Liu, Shengcong; Zhang, Long; Weng, Haoyu; Yang, Fan; Jin, Han; Fan, Fangfang; Zheng, Xizi; Yang, Hongyu; Li, Haichao; Zhang, Yan; Li, Jianping",Int J Med Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33437208/; https://doi.org/10.7150/ijms.50965,11

Phylogenetic analysis on partial major outer and inner capsid proteins shows that these PRV strains are closely related to Melaka and Kampar viruses previously isolated in Malaysia. Further study is required to determine the public health significance of PRV infection in Southeast Asia, especially in cases where co‐infection with other pathogens may potentially lead to different clinical outcomes.

The developing embryo and its membranes provide a diversity of cell types that allow for the successful replication of a wide variety of different viruses. Within the family Coronaviridae the embryonated egg has been used as a host system primarily for two avian coronaviruses within the genus Gammacoronavirus, infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) and turkey coronavirus (TCoV). IBV replicates well in the embryonated chicken egg, regardless of inoculation route; however, the allantoic route is favored as the virus replicates well in epithelium lining the chorioallantoic membrane, with high virus titers found in these membranes and associated allantoic fluids. TCoV replicates only in epithelium lining the embryo intestines and bursa of Fabricius; thus, amniotic inoculation is required for isolation and propagation of this virus.

639436,The First Whole Genome Sequence and Characterisation of Avian Nephritis Virus Genotype 3,2021-02-03,"BACKGROUND: In November 2020, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) provided Emergency Use Authorizations (EUA) for two novel virus-neutralizing monoclonal antibody therapies, bamlanivimab, and REGN-COV2 (casirivimab plus imdevimab), for the treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19 in adolescents and adults in specified high-risk groups. This has challenged clinicians to determine the best approach to use of these products. METHODS: A panel of experts in pediatric infectious diseases, pediatric infectious diseases pharmacy, pediatric intensive care medicine, and pediatric hematology from 29 geographically diverse North American institutions was convened. Through a series of teleconferences and web-based surveys, a guidance statement was developed and refined based on review of the best available evidence and expert opinion. RESULTS: The course of COVID-19 in children and adolescents is typically mild and there is no high-quality evidence supporting any high risk groups. There is no evidence for safety and efficacy of monoclonal antibody therapy for treatment of COVID-19 in children or adolescents, limited evidence of modest benefit in adults, and evidence for potential harm associated with infusion reactions or anaphylaxis. CONCLUSIONS: Based on evidence available as of December 20, 2020, the panel suggests against routine administration of monoclonal antibody therapy (bamlanivimab, or casirivimab and imdevimab), for treatment of COVID-19 in children or adolescents, including those designated by the FDA as at high risk of progression to hospitalization or severe disease. Clinicians and health systems choosing to use these agents on an individualized basis should consider risk factors supported by pediatric-specific evidence, and ensure implementation of a system for safe and timely administration that does not exacerbate existing healthcare disparities.","Wolf, Joshua; Abzug, Mark J; Wattier, Rachel L; Sue, Paul K; Vora, Surabhi B; Zachariah, Philip; Dulek, Daniel E; Waghmare, Alpana; Olivero, Rosemary; Downes, Kevin J; James, Scott H; Pinninti, Swetha G; Yarbrough, April; Aldrich, Margaret L; MacBrayne, Christine E; Soma, Vijaya L; Grapentine, Steven P; Oliveira, Carlos R; Hayes, Molly; Kimberlin, David W; Jones, Sarah B; Bio, Laura L; Morton, Theodore H; Hankins, Jane S; Marόn-Alfaro, Gabriella M; Timberlake, Kathryn; Young, Jennifer L; Orscheln, Rachel C; Schwenk, Hayden T; Goldman, David L; Groves, Helen E; Huskins, W Charles; Rajapakse, Nipunie S; Lamb, Gabriella S; Tribble, Alison C; Lloyd, Elizabeth E; Hersh, Adam L; Thorell, Emily A; Ratner, Adam J; Chiotos, Kathleen; Nakamura, Mari M",J Pediatric Infect Dis Soc,https://doi.org/10.1093/jpids/piaa175; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33388760/,11

This study investigated the correspondence between objective evaluations of Romanian school children (actual weight) and perceptions about weight (perceived weight), preoccupation with body weight management (desired weight) and parents’ perceptions on children’s weight. Materials and Methods: A cross sectional study was performed among 344 children aged 11 to 14 and 147 parents from Cluj-Napoca, Romania. We made anthropometric measurements of children, and short questionnaires were completed by the children and the parents. Results: The results show that 3.8% of children were underweight, 68.3% had a normal weight and 27.9% were overweight. Of this sample, 61.5% of underweight children, 20% of normal weight children and 43.7% of overweight children had misperceptions about their weight. The percentage of parents who did not estimate their children’s weight correctly was 50%, 11.9% and 41.5%, respectively, for each of the three weight groups. The results of the logistic regression analyses showed that several factors were associated with the misclassification of their own body weight by the children, such as body mass index, gender, weight management practices, misclassification by the parents as well as parent–child discussions on these issues. Conclusions: Education for both Romanian parents and children is needed with regard to correctly identifying and managing children’ body weight.","Lotrean, Lucia Maria; Popa, Ioana; Florea, Mira; Lazea, Cecilia; Stanescu, Ana Maria Alexandra; Lencu, Codruta",Medicina (Kaunas),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33915949/; https://doi.org/10.3390/medicina57040333,11

Data were collected through an online survey from 667 participants. Psychological distress was assessed using the GHQ-12, and affect balance was assessed as the preponderance of positive over negative affect. Results reveal that psychological capital and internal locus of control were negatively associated with psychological distress. In addition, affect balance mediated the relationship between psychological capital and psychological distress and the relationship between internal locus of control and psychological distress. Thus, both the psychological resources through affect balance acted as buffers protecting people from mental health deterioration during COVID-19 lockdown. However, the direct and indirect effects of psychological capital on psychological distress is stronger than that of internal locus of control.

Sources espousing misinformation and conspiracy theories frequently offer information that can help make sense of this uncertainty. Individuals high in intolerance of uncertainty (IU) may be particularly impacted by the impoverished epistemic environment and may thus be more drawn to conspiratorial thinking (CT). In the present work, we show across 2 studies (N = 519) that COVID-19-specific CT is associated with higher levels of IU as well as delusion-proneness, and paranoia. Furthermore, delusion-proneness and paranoia explained the relationship between IU and CT and emerged as independent partial correlates of CT even when controlling for other facets of schizotypy. In contrast, anxiety did not explain the relationship between IU and CT. Overall, our findings highlight the importance of individual differences in IU, delusion-proneness and paranoia in the development of CT in the context of the acute uncertainty of a global crisis, in which conspiracy theories are more prevalent and salient. Informational intervention designs may benefit from leveraging the body of work demonstrating the efficacy of targeting IU to incite meaningful changes in thinking.","Larsen, Emmett M.; Donaldson, Kayla R.; Liew, Megan; Mohanty, Aprajita",Front Psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.698147; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34483993/,11

We update our systematic review on COVID-19-associated mucormycosis (CAM) till June 21st, 2021, comparing cases reported from India and elsewhere. We included individual patient details of 275 cases of CAM, of which 233 were reported from India and 42 from the rest of the world. Diabetes mellitus was the most common underlying risk factor for CAM in India than in other countries. The fatality rate of cases reported from India (36.5%) was less than the globally reported cases (61.9%), probably due to the predominance of rhino-orbital mucormycosis. On a multivariate analysis, we found that pulmonary or disseminated mucormycosis cases and admission to the intensive care unit were associated with increased mortality, while combination medical therapy improved survival. The paucity of pulmonary and disseminated mucormycosis cases from India suggests that these cases were either not diagnosed or reported, further supported by a trend of search data from the Google search engine. In this review, we discuss the factors explaining the substantial rise in cases of CAM. We also propose a hypothetical model describing the epidemiologic triad of CAM.

646448,Oral immunogenicity of the plant derived spike protein from swine-transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus,2000,"BACKGROUND: The Internet of Medical Things (IoMTs) is gradually replacing the traditional healthcare system. However, little attention has been paid to their security requirements in the development of the IoMT devices and systems. One of the main reasons can be the difficulty of tuning conventional security solutions to the IoMT system. Machine Learning (ML) has been successfully employed in the attack detection and mitigation process. Advanced ML technique can also be a promising approach to address the existing and anticipated IoMT security and privacy issues. However, because of the existing challenges of IoMT system, it is imperative to know how these techniques can be effectively utilized to meet the security and privacy requirements without affecting the IoMT systems quality, services, and device’s lifespan. METHODOLOGY: This article is devoted to perform a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) on the security and privacy issues of IoMT and their solutions by ML techniques. The recent research papers disseminated between 2010 and 2020 are selected from multiple databases and a standardized SLR method is conducted. A total of 153 papers were reviewed and a critical analysis was conducted on the selected papers. Furthermore, this review study attempts to highlight the limitation of the current methods and aims to find possible solutions to them. Thus, a detailed analysis was carried out on the selected papers through focusing on their methods, advantages, limitations, the utilized tools, and data. RESULTS: It was observed that ML techniques have been significantly deployed for device and network layer security. Most of the current studies improved traditional metrics while ignored performance complexity metrics in their evaluations. Their studies environments and utilized data barely represent IoMT system. Therefore, conventional ML techniques may fail if metrics such as resource complexity and power usage are not considered.","Hameed, Shilan S.; Hassan, Wan Haslina; Abdul Latiff, Liza; Ghabban, Fahad",PeerJ Comput Sci,https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj-cs.414; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33834100/,11

However, RT-PCR has its limitations; this includes issues of low sensitivity, sampling errors and appropriate timing of specimen collection. As pulmonary involvement is the most common manifestation of severe COVID-19, early and appropriate lung imaging is important to aid diagnosis. However, gross discrepancies can occur between the clinical and imaging findings in patients with COVID-19, which can mislead clinicians in their decision making. Although chest X-ray (CXR) has a low sensitivity for the diagnosis of COVID-19 associated lung disease, especially in the earlier stages, a positive CXR increases the pre-test probability of COVID-19. CXR scoring systems have shown to be useful, such as the COVID-19 opacification rating score which helps to predict the need of tracheal intubation. Furthermore, artificial intelligence-based algorithms have also shown promise in differentiating COVID-19 pneumonia on CXR from other lung diseases. Although costlier than CXR, unenhanced computed tomographic (CT) chest scans have a higher sensitivity, but lesser specificity compared to RT-PCR for the diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia. A semi-quantitative CT scoring system has been shown to predict short-term mortality. The routine use of CT pulmonary angiography as a first-line imaging modality in patients with suspected COVID-19 is not justifiable due to the risk of contrast nephropathy. Scoring systems similar to those pioneered in CXR and CT can be used to effectively plan and manage hospital resources such as ventilators. Lung ultrasound is useful in the assessment of critically ill COVID-19 patients in the hands of an experienced operator. Moreover, it is a convenient tool to monitor disease progression, as it is cheap, non-invasive, easily accessible and easy to sterilise. Newer lung imaging modalities such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for safe imaging among children, adolescents and pregnant women are rapidly evolving. Imaging modalities are also essential for evaluating the extra-pulmonary manifestations of COVID-19: these include cranial imaging with CT or MRI; cardiac imaging with ultrasonography (US), CT and MRI; and abdominal imaging with US or CT. This review critically analyses the utility of each imaging modality to empower clinicians to use them appropriately in the management of patients with COVID-19 infection.","Kumar, Hemant; Fernandez, Cornelius James; Kolpattil, Sangeetha; Munavvar, Mohamed; Pappachan, Joseph M",World J Radiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33968311/; https://doi.org/10.4329/wjr.v13.i4.75,11

647625,Neuraminidase treatment of avian infectious bronchitis coronavirus reveals a hemagglutinating activity that is dependent on sialic acid-containing receptors on erythrocytes,1992-08-31,"This article describes the clinical course, radiological findings, and outcome of two patients with the novel 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) who remained comatose for a prolonged duration following discontinuation of all sedation. These two male patients, one aged 59-years and another aged 53-years, both with a history of hypertension and neurologically intact on admission, developed worsening COVID-19 associated acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Both required benzodiazepine, opioid, neuromuscular blockade, therapeutic anticoagulation, and vasopressor infusions in addition to renal replacement therapy. Echocardiography demonstrated normal chamber size and systolic function in both cases. Each patient demonstrated only trace flexion to pain 7–10 days following discontinuation of all sedation. Magnetic Resonance Imaging on both patients demonstrated multifocal lesions on diffusion weighted imaging with apparent diffusion coefficient correlate in bilateral middle/anterior cerebral artery borderzones, and no large-vessel occlusion or severe stenosis. In both patients, continuous electroencephalography demonstrated no seizures. Neither patient had any documented period of sustained hypotension (mean arterial pressure <60 mmHg) or hypoxia (SpO(2) <90%). Ninety days following initial presentation, the 59-years-old man was oriented, with fluent speech and able to ambulate with assistance, while the other 53-years-old man was at home and independent, undertaking the basic activities required by daily living. We conclude that critically-ill COVID-19 patients with prolonged coma following sedation discontinuation may demonstrate imaging features of ischemic injury in borderzone regions despite the absence of documented sustained hypotension or hypoxia. However, substantial neurological recovery is possible despite these findings.","Pirau, Letitia; Ottenhoff, Lauren; Williamson, Craig A.; Ahmad, Shahid N.; Wabl, Rafael; Nguyen, Andrew; Faiver, Laura; Rajajee, Venkatakrishna",Front Neurol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fneur.2020.00964; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33071927/,11
647778,The autoimmune response induced by mouse hepatitis virus A59 is expanded by a hepatotoxic agent,2009-03-01,"Abstract Background: The pandemic caused by coronavirus in recent months is having a devastating global effect, which puts the world under the most ever unprecedented emergency. Currently, since there are not effective antiviral treat- ments for Covid-19 yet, it is crucial to early detect and monitor the progression of the disease, thus helping to reduce mortality. While a corresponding vaccine is being developed, and different measures are being used to combat the virus, medical imaging techniques have also been investigated to assist doctors in diag- nosing this disease. Objective: This paper presents a practical solution for the detection of Covid-19 from chest X-ray (CXR) images, exploiting cutting-edge Machine Learning techniques. Methods: We employ EfficientNet and MixNet, two recently developed families of deep neural networks, as the main classifica- tion engine. Furthermore, we also apply different transfer learning strategies, aiming at making the training process more accurate and efficient. The proposed approach has been validated by means of two real datasets, the former consists of 13,511 training images and 1,489 testing images, the latter has 14,324 and 3,581 images for training and testing, respectively. Results: The results are promising: by all the experimental configurations considered in the evaluation,our approach always yields an accuracy larger than 95.0%, with the maximum accuracy obtained being 96.64%. Conclusions: As a comparison with various existing studies, we can thus conclude that our performance improvement is significant.","Nguyen, P.; Iovino, L.; Flammini, M.; Linh, L.

647831,"Identification of an infectious bronchitis coronavirus strain exhibiting a classical genotype but altered antigenicity, pathogenicity, and innate immunity profile",2016-11-23,"BACKGROUND: Non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) constituted the principal public health response to the previous influenza A (H1N1) 2009 pandemic and are one key area of ongoing preparation for future pandemics. Thailand is an important point of focus in terms of global pandemic preparedness and response due to its role as the major transportation hub for Southeast Asia, the endemic presence of multiple types of influenza, and its role as a major receiving country for migrants. Our aim was to collect information about vulnerable migrants’ perceptions of and ability to implement NPIs proposed by the WHO. We hope that this information will help us to gauge the capacity of this population to engage in pandemic preparedness and response efforts, and to identify potential barriers to NPI effectiveness. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was performed. The study was conducted during the influenza H1N1 2009 pandemic and included 801 migrant participants living in border areas thought to be high risk by the Thailand Ministry of Public Health. Data were collected by Migrant Community Health Workers using a 201-item interviewer-assisted questionnaire. Univariate descriptive analyses were conducted. RESULTS: With the exception of border measures, to which nearly all participants reported they would be adherent, attitudes towards recommended NPIs were generally negative or uncertain. Other potential barriers to NPI implementation include limited experience applying these interventions (e.g., using a thermometer, wearing a face mask) and inadequate hand washing and household disinfection practices. CONCLUSIONS: Negative or ambivalent attitudes towards NPIs combined with other barriers identified suggest that vulnerable migrants in Thailand have a limited capacity to participate in pandemic preparedness efforts. This limited capacity likely puts migrants at risk of propagating the spread of a pandemic virus. Coordinated risk communication and public education are potential strategies that may reduce barriers to individual NPI implementation.","Hickey, Jason; Gagnon, Anita J; Jitthai, Nigoon",BMC Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24973943/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2458-14-665,11

Air pollutants such as sulfur oxides, nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide and dioxide, particulate matter (PM), ozone and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are commonly found at high levels in big cities and/or in the vicinity of different chemical industries. An association between air concentrations of these pollutants and human respiratory viruses interacting to adversely affect the respiratory system has been also reported. The present review was aimed at assessing the potential relationship between the concentrations of air pollutants on the airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and the severity of COVID-19 in patients infected by this coronavirus. The results of most studies here reviewed suggest that chronic exposure to certain air pollutants leads to more severe and lethal forms of COVID-19 and delays/complicates the recovery of patients of this disease.","Domingo, José L.; Marquès, Montse; Rovira, Joaquim",Environ Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32718835/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0013935120307568; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013935120307568?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2020.109861,11

Objective: To assess associations between changes in movement behaviors (physical activity, screen time and sleeping) and emotional changes in toddlers and preschoolers during early stages of the pandemic in Chile. Methods: A cross-sectional study conducted from March 30th to April 27th, 2020. Main caregivers of 1- to 5-year-old children living in Chile answered an online survey that included questions about sociodemographic characteristics, changes in the child's emotions and behaviors, movement behaviors and caregivers' stress during the pandemic. Multiple linear regressions were used to assess the association between different factors and emotional changes in toddlers and preschoolers. Results: In total, 1727 caregivers provided complete data on emotional changes for children aged 2.9 ± 1.36 years old, 47.9% girls. A large proportion of toddlers and preschoolers in Chile experienced emotional and behavioral changes. Most caregivers reported that children “were more affectionate” (78.9%), “more restless” (65.1%), and ‘more frustrated' (54.1%) compared with pre-pandemic times. Apart from changes in movement behaviors, factors such as child age, caregivers' age and stress, and residential area (urban/rural) were consistently associated with changes in emotions and behaviors. Conclusion: The pandemic substantially affected the emotions and behaviors of toddlers and preschoolers in Chile. The findings suggest that supportive actions for caregivers may have a positive impact not only on adults but also on children. Mental health promotion programs should consider multilevel approaches in which the promotion of movement behaviors and support for caregivers should be essential pieces for future responses.","Aguilar-Farias, Nicolas; Toledo-Vargas, Marcelo; Miranda-Marquez, Sebastian; Cortinez-O'Ryan, Andrea; Martino-Fuentealba, Pia; Cristi-Montero, Carlos; Rodriguez-Rodriguez, Fernando; Guarda-Saavedra, Paula; Del Pozo Cruz, Borja; Okely, Anthony D.",Front Pediatr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34532302/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fped.2021.667362,11
649993,Enhancement of the immunogenicity of an infectious bronchitis virus DNA vaccine by a bicistronic plasmid encoding nucleocapsid protein and interleukin-2,2008-03-07,"The COVID-19 pandemic is an emerging respiratory infectious disease, having a significant impact on the health and life of many people around the world. Therefore, early identification of COVID-19 patients is the fastest way to restrain the spread of the pandemic. However, as the number of cases grows at an alarming pace, most developing countries are now facing a shortage of medical resources and testing kits. Besides, using testing kits to detect COVID-19 cases is a time-consuming, expensive, and cumbersome procedure. Faced with these obstacles, most physicians, researchers, and engineers have advocated for the advancement of computer-aided deep learning models to assist healthcare professionals in quickly and inexpensively recognize COVID-19 cases from chest X-ray (CXR) images. With this motivation, this paper proposes a CovidMulti-Net architecture based on the transfer learning concept to classify COVID-19 cases from normal and other pneumonia cases using three publicly available datasets that include 1341, 1341, and 446 CXR images from healthy samples and 902, 1564, and 1193 CXR images infected with Viral Pneumonia, Bacterial Pneumonia, and COVID-19 diseases. In the proposed framework, features from CXR images are extracted using three well-known pre-trained models, including DenseNet-169, ResNet-50, and VGG-19. The extracted features are then fed into a concatenate layer, making a robust hybrid model. The proposed framework achieved a classification accuracy of 99.4%, 95.2%, and 94.8% for 2-Class, 3-Class, and 4-Class datasets, exceeding all the other state-of-the-art models. These results suggest that the CovidMulti-Net frameworks ability to discriminate individuals with COVID-19 infection from healthy ones and provides the opportunity to be used as a diagnostic model in clinics and hospitals.

MS is significantly associated with a high rate of psychological, behavioral, and emotional consequences. Despite the frequent mental disorders, high rate of psychological comorbidities, and emotional problems in people with MS (PwMS), these conditions are often underdiagnosed and undertreated. This study aimed to examine the efficacy of a group format of the unified protocol for the transdiagnostic treatment of emotional disorders in adult PwMS associated with an emotional disorder. METHODS: Seventy adult PwMS were randomized using an internet-based computer system to either the unified protocol (n = 35) or treatment as usual condition. The assessment protocol included semi-structured clinical interviews and self-reports evaluating diagnostic criteria, depression, anxiety and worry symptoms, emotional dysregulation, and affectivity. RESULTS: The parametric test of analysis of covariance, followed the intent to treat analyses, revealed the unified protocol significantly changed depression symptoms (Cohen’s d = 1.9), anxiety symptoms (Cohen’s d = 2.16), worry symptoms (Cohen’s d = 1.27), emotion dysregulation (Cohen’s d = 0.44), positive affect (Cohen’s d = 1.51), and negative affect (Cohen’s d = 1.89) compared with the control group. The unified protocol also significantly improved outcome scores at the end of treatment relative to baseline (p < .001). CONCLUSION: The findings support that the unified protocol could be an additional efficient psychological treatment for PwMS. Trial registration IRCT, number: IRCT20190711044173N1.

Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS), first clinically identified in 2009, is an emerging tick-borne hemorrhagic viral disease, currently limited in distribution to East Asia. Relatively little is known about the disease with an initial Case Fatality Rate ranging from 5% to 40%. It primarily affects the elderly living in rural areas, which is particularly troublesome given Japan’s rapidly aging population. Control efforts are severely hampered by lack of specific knowledge of the disease and its means of transmission, coupled with the absence of both a vaccine and an effective treatment regime, although some antiviral drugs and blood transfusions are successful in treating the disease. Despite both the causative virus and vector ticks being commonly found throughout Japan, the disease shows a very specific, limited geographical distribution for as yet unknown reasons.","Crump, Andy; Tanimoto, Tetsuya",JMA J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33225100/; https://doi.org/10.31662/jmaj.2019-0073,11

Le cerveau est particulièrement sensible à l’environnement pendant ces remaniements. Le système endocannabinoïde participe directement et indirectement à ces processus de plasticité et de maturation. Le delta-9-tetrahydrocanabinol, principal composant psychoactif du cannabis, diffuse dans le placenta, le lait maternel et le cerveau. Il interagit avec le système endocannabinoïde, notamment par l’activation des récepteurs aux cannabinoïdes 1 CB1R, ce qui peut entraîner des altérations du neurodéveloppement et du fonctionnement des circuits neuronaux. Par conséquent, l’exposition au cannabis in utero, en période périnatale ainsi qu’à l’adolescence est susceptible d’entraîner des perturbations de la maturation cérébrale dont les conséquences, sur le plan cognitif, psychotique et addictif, persistent bien au-delà de la période d’exposition. Plusieurs facteurs modulent le risque de telles complications mais les études réalisées sur des modèles animaux ainsi que chez l’homme ont montré qu’une exposition durant les phases critiques, en particulier durant la phase de développement périnatal et à l’adolescence, constitue en soi un facteur de risque. Les données actuelles incitent à diffuser une information objective aux jeunes, pour prévenir et limiter les consommations précoces. Summary Brain development is a complex phenomenon, stretching from fetal life to adolescence, during which brain maturation proceeds through a series of ordered events including critical periods of plasticity. The brain is particularly sensitive to the environment during these changes. The endocannabinoid system participates directly and indirectly in these plasticity and maturation processes. The main psychoactive component of cannabis, the delta-9-tetrahydrocanabinol, can cross the placental barrier, is present in breastmilk and diffuses in the brain. It interacts with the endocannabinoid signaling, especially through the activation of cannabinoid receptors 1 CB1R, which can lead to abnormal neurodevelopmental processes and neuronal circuits functions. Therefore, exposure to cannabis in utero, in perinatal phase, as well as during the adolescence disrupts the brain maturation and can cause disturbances on the cognitive, psychotic and addictive levels that persist far beyond the period of exposure. Several factors modulate the risk of such complications, but studies performed in animal models as well as in human cohorts have shown that exposure during both the critical perinatal and adolescence phases is a risk factor per se. Current knowledge encourages the dissemination of objective information to young people, to prevent and limit early exposure and its consequences.","Krebs, M.-O.; Demars, F.; Frajerman, A.; Kebir, O.; Jay, T.",Bull Acad Natl Med,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0001407920301722; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001407920301722,11

Thorough investigations of the evolution of human coronaviruses (HCoVs) are urgently required. In the current study, we studied amplified fragments of ORF1a/b, Spike (S) gene, ORF3/4a, and ORF4b of four human MERS-CoV strains for tracking the evolution of MERS-CoV over time. METHODS: RNA isolated from nasopharyngeal aspirate, sputum, and tracheal swabs/aspirates from hospitalized patients with suspected MERS-CoV infection were analyzed for amplification of nine variable genomic fragments. Sequence comparisons were done using different bioinformatics tools available. RESULTS: Several mutations were identified in ORF1a/b, ORF3/4a and ORF4b, with the highest mutation rates in the S gene. Five codons; 4 in ORF1a and 1 in the S gene, were found to be under selective pressure. Characteristic amino acid changes, potentially hosted and year specific were defined across the S protein and in the receptor-binding domain Phylogenetic analysis using S gene sequence revealed clustering of MERS-CoV strains into three main clades, A, B and C with subdivision of with clade B into B1 to B4.

657584,"Complete genome sequence of Nariva virus, a rodent paramyxovirus",2008-12-23,"Introduction After appearance of the novel Coronavirus 2019 in Wuhan, China, new epicenters of the now pandemic appeared nationally. The new Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is associated with a syndrome of acute hypoxemic respiratory failure that can lead to admission to intensive care unit (ICU), invasive mechanical ventilation, and at times, death. The first two COVID-19 cases in the State of Michigan were reported in March 10, 2020. During the subsequent weeks, Michigan became one of the early national epicenters of the current COVID-19 pandemic. Early observational studies have suggested a correlation between susceptibility to COVID-19 infection and type A blood group, and furthermore, increased risk of respiratory failure and worse outcome. We conducted this retrospective study to evaluate the association between ABO blood groups and disease severity/mortality in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Methods We reviewed the records of hospitalized patients with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 testing managed at Henry Ford Health System (HFHS) between March 10 and April 30, 2020. Henry Ford Health System (HFHS) serves inner city and metropolitan Detroit in Michigan, with diverse demographics including African American, Middle Eastern, and Caucasian populations. Age, gender, race, ABO blood groups, comorbidities, disease severity (defined as intensive care unit admission), intubation, and mortality variables were collected for 1488 eligible patients. Survival data was updated on July 15, 2020. Results were presented as median plus range, or percentages as indicated. In the univariate analysis, Student’s t-test and Pearson’s Chi-square/Fisher’s exact test were used to determine the significance and odds ratio (OR) for the independent variables as related to outcome. A multivariate analysis was performed using logistic regression to identify the risk factors for mortality. A backward stepwise (Wald) selection model was performed, with significance level for removal from the model set at 0.1. All tests of significance were two-sided, and a p value of < 0.05 was regarded as significant. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS (Statistical Package for Social Sciences) software, version 22 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of HFHS. Results 1488 hospitalized COVID-19 positive patients with available ABO blood group were included. The median age of patients was 68 years (Range 19-99 years); 801 (54%) were females. Most patients (n=856; 58%) were African Americans. 485 (32.6%) patients had blood group A, 276 (18.5%) had group B, 658 (44.2%) had group O, and 69 (4.6%) had group AB. 469 (31.5%) patients required ICU admission, 370 of whom were intubated. On last follow up, 411 (27.6%) patients were dead. ABO blood groups and Rhesus factor (D antigen) were not associated with the ICU admission, intubation, or mortality. Male gender, age ≥65 years, some underlying diseases such as obesity, coronary artery disease chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and malignancy were associated with increased mortality. African American patients were almost 40% less likely to die (OR = 0.56; 95% CI: 0.44-0.7; p < 0.001). Table 1 shows the parameters analyzed as predictors of mortality using univariate and multivariate logistic regression. Multivariate analysis showed that age (≥65 years) (OR = 4.27; 95% CI: 3.19-5.71; p < 0.001), male gender (OR = 1.57; 95% CI: 1.23-2.01; p < 0.001), Caucasian race (OR=1.46; 95% CI: 1.14-1.86; p = 0.003), and COPD (OR = 1.49; 95% CI: 1.09-2.04; p = 0.013) were associated with mortality. Conclusion According to our study, ABO blood groups and Rhesus factor did not correlate with disease severity, use of mechanical ventilation, or mortality in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Elderly patients, male gender, patients with COPD were at increased risk of death. Contrary to perceived belief, African Americans were not at increased risk of mortality, compared to Caucasians with COVID-19 infection. Caucasians were more likely to die from COVID-19 infection.

We summarized the measures taken in Wuhan and analyzed the effects to comprehensively describe the factors involved in controlling the COVID-19 in China. In China, several measures such as the lockdown of Wuhan, restriction of traffic and communities, increasing hospital beds, nationwide support from medical staff, epidemic prevention equipment and supplies, and establishment of makeshift shelter hospitals have been taken. The lockdown of Wuhan reduced the propagation of cases to other cities in Hubei province and throughout China, traffic and community restrictions reduced the flow of population and the spread of disease, increasing wards and beds and medical personnel reduced the incidence of severe cases and mortality, the establishment of the Fangcang shelter hospitals provided a good isolation and monitoring environment, and further reduced the spread and fatality of the disease. The fact that China was able to control the spread of COVID-19 within three months without a specific drug or vaccine suggests that these measures are more adequate and effective.","Xin, Xing; Li, Shu-fang; Cheng, Ling; Liu, Chang-yu; Xin, Yin-juan; Huang, Hai-long; Beejadhursing, Rajluxmee; Wang, Shao-shuai; Feng, Ling",Curr Med Sci,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11596-021-2321-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33582909/,11
660118,Porcine Intestinal Enteroids: a New Model for Studying Enteric Coronavirus Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus Infection and the Host Innate Response,2018-12-12,"INTRODUCTION: Emergency departments (EDs) are reasonably well prepared for external disasters, such as natural disasters, mass casualty incidents, and terrorist attacks. However, crises and disasters that emerge and unfold within hospitals appear to be more common than external events. EDs are often affected. Internal hospital crises and disasters (IHCDs) have the potential to endanger patients, staff, and visitors, and to undermine the integrity of the facility as a steward of public health and safety. Furthermore, ED patient safety and logistics may be seriously hampered. METHODS: Case series of 3 disasters within EDs. Narrative overview of the current IHCD-related literature retrieved from searches of PubMed databases, hand searches, and authoritative texts. DISCUSSION: The causes of IHCDs are multifaceted and an internal disaster is often the result of a cascade of events. They may or may not be associated with a community-wide event. Examples include fires, floods, power outages, structural damage, information and communication technology (ICT) failures, and cyberattacks. EDs are particularly at-risk. While acute-onset disasters have immediate consequences for acute care services, epidemics and pandemics are threats that can have long-term sequelae. CONCLUSIONS: Hospitals and their EDs are at-risk for crises and their potential escalation to hospital disasters. Emerging risks due to climate-related emergencies, infectious disease outbreaks, terrorism, and cyberattacks pose particular threats. If a hospital is not prepared for IHCDs, it undermines the capacity of administration and staff to safeguard the safety of patients. Therefore, hospitals and their EDs must check and where necessary enhance their preparedness for these contingencies.","Barten, Dennis G.; Klokman, Vincent W.; Cleef, Sigrid; Peters, Nathalie A. L.

The establishment of standardized RT-qPCR protocols for respiratory secretions testing, as well as sharing of specimens, data, and information became critical. Here, we investigate the analytical performance of two interim RT-qPCR protocols (Charité and Centers for Disease Control (CDC)) for the qualitative detection of SARS-CoV-2 executed in a fully automated platform. Analytical specificity, PCR amplification efficiency, analytical sensitivity (limit of detection), and cross-reactivity were evaluated using contrived samples. The on-going accuracy was evaluated by retrospective analysis of our test results database (real clinical samples). N1, E, and a modified version of RdRP assays presented adequate analytical specificity, amplification efficiency, and analytical sensitivity using contrived samples. The three assays were applied to all individuals who requested the SARS-CoV-2 molecular test assay in our laboratory and it was observed that N1 gave more positive results than E, and E gave more positive results than RdRP (modified). The RdRP and E were removed from the test and its final version, based on N1 assay only, was applied to 30,699 Brazilian individuals (from 19 February 2020 to 8 May 2020). The aggregated test results available in the database were also presented.","Barra, Gustavo Barcelos; Santa Rita, Ticiane Henriques; Mesquita, Pedro Góes; Jácomo, Rafael Henriques; Nery, Lídia Freire Abdalla",Genes (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33053675/; https://doi.org/10.3390/genes11101183,11

663710,Neutralizing antibodies against porcine epidemic diarrhea virus block virus attachment and internalization,2018-08-30,"BACKGROUND: Severe COVID-19 infection results in a systemic inflammatory response (SIRS). This SIRS response shares similarities to the changes observed during the peri-operative period that are recognised to be associated with the development of multiple organ failure. METHODS: Electronic patient records for patients who were admitted to an urban teaching hospital during the initial 7-week period of the COVID-19 pandemic in Glasgow, U.K. (17th March 2020—1st May 2020) were examined for routine clinical, laboratory and clinical outcome data. Age, sex, BMI and documented evidence of COVID-19 infection at time of discharge or death certification were considered minimal criteria for inclusion. RESULTS: Of the 224 patients who fulfilled the criteria for inclusion, 52 (23%) had died at 30-days following admission. COVID-19 related respiratory failure (75%) and multiorgan failure (12%) were the commonest causes of death recorded. Age ≥ 70 years (p < 0.001), past medical history of cognitive impairment (p ≤ 0.001), previous delirium (p < 0.001), clinical frailty score > 3 (p < 0.001), hypertension (p < 0.05), heart failure (p < 0.01), national early warning score (NEWS) > 4 (p < 0.01), positive CXR (p < 0.01), and subsequent positive COVID-19 swab (p ≤ 0.001) were associated with 30-day mortality. CRP > 80 mg/L (p < 0.05), albumin < 35 g/L (p < 0.05), peri-operative Glasgow Prognostic Score (poGPS) (p < 0.05), lymphocytes < 1.5 10(9)/l (p < 0.05), neutrophil lymphocyte ratio (p ≤ 0.001), haematocrit (< 0.40 L/L (male)/ < 0.37 L/L (female)) (p ≤ 0.01), urea > 7.5 mmol/L (p < 0.001), creatinine > 130 mmol/L (p < 0.05) and elevated urea: albumin ratio (< 0.001) were also associated with 30-day mortality. On multivariate analysis, age ≥ 70 years (O.R. 3.9, 95% C.I. 1.4–8.2, p < 0.001), past medical history of heart failure (O.R. 3.3, 95% C.I. 1.2–19.3, p < 0.05), NEWS > 4 (O.R. 2.4, 95% C.I. 1.1–4.4, p < 0.05), positive initial CXR (O.R. 0.4, 95% C.I. 0.2–0.9, p < 0.05) and poGPS (O.R. 2.3, 95% C.I. 1.1–4.4, p < 0.05) remained independently associated with 30-day mortality. Among those patients who tested PCR COVID-19 positive (n = 122), age ≥ 70 years (O.R. 4.7, 95% C.I. 2.0—11.3, p < 0.001), past medical history of heart failure (O.R. 4.4, 95% C.I. 1.2–20.5, p < 0.05) and poGPS (O.R. 2.4, 95% C.I. 1.1–5.1, p < 0.05) remained independently associated with 30-days mortality.

In response, cities are rapidly implementing street reallocation initiatives. These interventions provide space for walking and cycling, however, other mobility needs (e.g., essential workers, deliveries) may be impeded by these reallocation decisions. Informed by mobility justice frameworks, we examined socio-spatial differences in access to street reallocations in Seattle, Washington and Vancouver, British Columbia. In both cities, more interventions occurred in areas where people of color, particularly Black and Indigenous people, lived. In Seattle, more interventions occurred in areas where people with disabilities, on food stamps, and children lived. In Vancouver, more interventions occurred in areas where recent immigrants lived, or where people used public transit or cycled to work. Street reallocations could be opportunities for cities to redress inequities in mobility and access to public spaces. Going forward, it is imperative to monitor how cities use data and welcome communities to redesign these temporary spaces to be corridors for their own mobility.","Firth, Caislin L.; Baquero, Barbara; Berney, Rachel; Hoerster, Katherine D.; Mooney, Stephen J.; Winters, Meghan",SSM Popul Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33748391/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssmph.2021.100769,11

Remote examination of patients with hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) brings particular challenges, given the propensity of HS to affect intimate body areas. To understand the impact of remote consultations on the care of patients with HS, a retrospective analysis was conducted of all consultations from 2 April to 29 October 2020 at the HS clinic at Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust. In this group of patients with HS, 46.3% were black, compared with 7.0% of patients attending general dermatology clinics (P < 0.001). The majority (65.9%) of patients had previously received or were currently taking adalimumab. All consultations were performed by telephone and in 50.7% of the consultations, patients were assessed as having unstable (u)HS, with 81.1% of these uHS episodes leading to a change in pharmacological therapy. The decision‐making process was aided by patient‐submitted photographs at only 8.1% of consultations involving uHS, for reasons of patient privacy, comfort and data security. The data suggest that HS is an inherently unstable disease despite maximal medical therapy, and this study highlights important reasons for the assessment of patients with HS by FTF consultations where safely possible.","Patel, N.

The most commonly used antibiotics in swine industry are tetracyclines, beta-lactams, and macrolides. Resistance to these antibiotics has already been observed worldwide (reaching high rates for macrolides and tetracyclines) as well as resistance to aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones, amphenicols, and glycopeptides. Most of the resistance mechanisms are encoded by antibiotic resistance genes, and a large part are carried by mobile genetic elements (MGEs) that can be transferred through horizontal gene transfer. This review provides an update of the resistance genes, their combination in multidrug isolates, and their localization on MGEs in S. suis. It also includes an overview of the contribution of biofilm to antimicrobial resistance in this bacterial species. The identification of resistance genes and study of their localization in S. suis as well as the environmental factors that can modulate their dissemination appear essential in order to decipher the role of this bacterium as a reservoir of antibiotic genes for other species.","Dechêne-Tempier, Manon; Marois-Créhan, Corinne; Libante, Virginie; Jouy, Eric; Leblond-Bourget, Nathalie; Payot, Sophie",Microorganisms,https://doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms9081765; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34442843/,11

Face masks and other personal protective equipment (PPE) can act as barriers that prevent the spread of respiratory droplets containing these viruses. However, influenza A viruses and coronaviruses are stable for hours on various materials, which makes frequent and correct disposal of these PPE important. Metal ions embedded into PPE may inactivate respiratory viruses, but confounding factors such as absorption of viruses make measuring and optimizing the inactivation characteristics difficult. Here we used polyamide 6.6 (PA66) fibers that had zinc ions embedded during the polymerisation process and systematically investigated if these fibers can absorb and inactivate pandemic SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A virus H1N1. We find that these viruses are readily absorbed by PA66 fabrics and inactivated by zinc ions embedded into this fabric. The inactivation rate (pfu·gram(−1)·min(−1)) exceeds the number of active virus particles expelled by a cough and supports a wide range of viral loads. Overall, these results provide new insight into the development of “pathogen-free” PPE and better protection against RNA virus spread.","Gopal, Vikram; Nilsson-Payant, Benjamin E.; French, Hollie; Siegers, Jurre Y.; tenOever, Benjamin R.; Yung, Wai-shing; Hardwick, Matthew; te Velthuis, Aartjan J.W.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.02.365833; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33173872/,11

In this review, we discuss the known various immunomodulatory mechanisms of antimalarials and the current evidence for their beneficial effects in various diseases and in potential novel applications.","Ben-Zvi, Ilan; Kivity, Shaye; Langevitz, Pnina; Shoenfeld, Yehuda",Clin Rev Allergy Immunol,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12016-010-8243-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21221847/,11
672701,Cellular entry of the porcine epidemic diarrhea virus,2016-12-02,"The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), continues to spread worldwide. Serological testing for SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies plays an important role in understanding and controlling the pandemic, notably through epidemiological surveillance. Well-validated and highly specific SARS-CoV-2 serological assays are urgently needed. We describe here the analytical and clinical performance of Vidas SARS-CoV-2 IgM and Vidas SARS-CoV-2 IgG, two CE-marked, emergency use authorization (EUA)-authorized, automated, qualitative assays for the detection of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgM and IgG, respectively. Both assays showed high within-run and within-laboratory precision (coefficients of variation < 11.0%) and very low cross-reactivity toward sera of patients with a past common coronavirus or respiratory virus infection. Clinical specificity determined on up to 989 prepandemic healthy donors was ≥99% with a narrow 95% confidence interval for both IgM and IgG assays. Clinical sensitivity was determined on up to 232 samples from 130 reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR)-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 patients. The positive percent agreement (PPA) with SARS-CoV-2 PCR reached 100% at ≥16 days (Vidas SARS-CoV-2 IgM) and ≥32 days (Vidas SARS-CoV-2 IgG) of symptom onset. Combined IgM/IgG test results improved the PPA compared to each test alone. SARS-CoV-2 IgG seroconversion followed closely that of SARS-CoV-2 IgM and remained stable over time, while SARS-CoV-2 IgM levels rapidly declined. Interestingly, SARS-CoV-2-specific IgM and IgG responses were significantly higher in COVID-19 hospitalized versus nonhospitalized patients. Altogether, the Vidas SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG assays are highly specific and sensitive serological tests suitable for the reliable detection of past acute SARS-CoV-2 infections.","Renard, Nathalie; Daniel, Soizic; Cayet, Nadège; Pecquet, Matthieu; Raymond, Frédérique; Pons, Sylvie; Lupo, Julien; Tourneur, Carole; Pretis, Catherine; Gerez, Guillaume; Blasco, Patrick; Combe, Maxime; Canova, Imen; Lesénéchal, Mylène; Berthier, Franck",J Clin Microbiol,https://doi.org/10.1128/jcm.02292-20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33419947/,11

The specific monoclonal antibody (MAb) (designated as 8F(8)A(8)H(4)2H(7)) against GL was produced with the immunogen GL–BSA conjugate. The dissociation constant (K (d)) value of the MAb was approximately 9.96×10(−10) M. The cross reactivity of the MAb with glycyrrhetic acid was approximately 2.6%. The conventional indirect competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (icELISA) and simplified icELISA adapted with a modified procedure were established using the MAb. The IC(50) value and the detect range by the conventional icELISA were 1.1 ng mL(−1) and 0.2–5.1 ng mL(−1), respectively. The IC(50) value and the detect range by the simplified icELISA were 5.3 ng mL(−1) and 1.2–23.8 ng mL(−1), respectively. The two icELISA formats were used to analyze GL contents in the roots of wild licorice and different parts of cultivated licorice (Glycyrrhiza uralensis Fisch). The results obtained with the two icELISAs agreed well with those of the HPLC analysis. The correlation coefficient was more than 0.98 between HPLC and the two icELISAs. The two icELISAs were shown to be appropriate, simple, and effective for the quality control of raw licorice root materials.","Zhao, Jing; Li, Gang; Wang, Bao-min; Liu, Wei; Nan, Tie-gui; Zhai, Zhi-xi; Li, Zhao-hu; Li, Qing X.",Anal Bioanal Chem,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17006677/,11

As it is clear that this virus becomes a public health threat and spreading easily among individuals. Mathematical models with computational simulations are effective tools that help global efforts to estimate key transmission parameters and further improvements for controlling this disease. This is an infectious disease and can be modeled as a system of non-linear differential equations with reaction rates. This work reviews and develops some suggested models for the COVID-19 that can address important questions about global health care and suggest important notes. Then, we suggest an updated model that includes a system of differential equations with transmission parameters. Some key computational simulations and sensitivity analysis are investigated. Also, the local sensitivities for each model state concerning the model parameters are computed using three different techniques: non-normalizations, half normalizations, and full normalizations. Results based on the computational simulations show that the model dynamics are significantly changed for different key model parameters. Interestingly, we identify that transition rates between asymptomatic infected with both reported and unreported symptomatic infected individuals are very sensitive parameters concerning model variables in spreading this disease. This helps international efforts to reduce the number of infected individuals from the disease and to prevent the propagation of new coronavirus more widely on the community. Another novelty of this paper is the identification of the critical model parameters, which makes it easy to be used by biologists with less knowledge of mathematical modeling and also facilitates the improvement of the model for future development theoretically and practically.","Khoshnaw, Sarbaz H.A.; Shahzad, Muhammad; Ali, Mehboob; Sultan, Faisal",Chaos Solitons Fractals,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960077920303313?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chaos.2020.109932; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0960077920303313; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32523257/,11

Universities were one of few public institutions subject to strict closure, meaning that students had to adapt overnight to online teaching. This study investigates the prevalence of self-reported recommendation compliance and associations with self-reported symptoms of contagion, self-experienced effects on mental health and academic self-efficacy among university students in Sweden in May-June 2020. METHODS This was a cross-sectional 23 question online survey in which data were analysed by multinomial regression, taking a Bayesian analysis approach complemented by null hypothesis testing. RESULTS A total of 4495 students consented to respond. Recommendation compliance ranged between 70% and 96%. Women and older students reported higher compliance than did men and younger students. Mild to moderate COVID-19 symptoms were reported by 30%, severe symptoms by fewer than 2%; 15% reported being uncertain and half of the participants reported no symptoms. Mental health effects were reported by over 80%, and changes in academic self-efficacy were reported by over 85%; in both these areas negative effects predominated. Self-reported symptoms and uncertainty about contagion were associated with non-compliance, negative mental health effects, and impaired academic self-efficacy. CONCLUSIONS Students generally followed public health recommendations during strict closure of universities, but many reported considerable negative consequences related to mental health and academic self-efficacy. Digital interventions should be developed and evaluated to boost coping skills, build resilience and alleviate student suffering during the pandemic and future similar crises.","Berman, Anne H; Bendtsen, Marcus; Molander, Olof; Lindfors, Petra; Lindner, Philip; Granlund, Lilian; Topooco, Naira; Engström, Karin; Andersson, Claes",Scandinavian journal of public health,https://doi.org/10.1177/14034948211027824; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34213359/,11

Lombardy (region of Italy), accounts for 786,324 cases as of 21 April 2021. We retrospectively describe our single Centre experience in 82 adult kidney-transplant patients with COVID-19 infection during two pandemic outbreaks: 27 (first outbreak) and 65 (second outbreak). Thirty-seven patients were hospitalized (HP) and sixty-five were home managed (HM). Infection presented with fever (80%), cough (51%), and dyspnea (33%). HP were older (60 ± 11 vs. 50 ± 14 years, p = 0.001), had more severe respiratory symptoms (dyspnea 62.1%, p < 0.0001–cough 67% p = 0.008), and a longer length of disease (30 ± 28 vs. 21 ± 10, p = 0.04). The incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) was 29.7% (p < 0.0001).

We examined the factors associated with mental health symptoms in Chinese general adults in Hong Kong. Methods: We conducted a dual-frame (landline and mobile) survey on Chinese adults aged 18 years or older in April 2020. Shortage of preventive materials, perceptions of the outbreak (each item range 1–5), and reduction in income were assessed. Mental health symptoms measured included stress (Perceived Stress Scale-4, range 0–16), anxiety (General Anxiety Disorders-2, range 0–6, cutoff >2), and depressive symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire-2, range 0–6, cutoff >2). Results were weighted by the general population distribution. Associations were analyzed by multivariable linear (for stress) and logistic (for anxiety and depressive symptoms) regression adjusting for sociodemographic and health-related covariates, including confirmed or in close contacts of confirmed cases, chronic disease, self-rated health, and smoking and alcohol drinking behavior. Results: Of the 1,501 participants (52.5% female, 55.0 aged 30–59 years), the average stress score was 7.20 (SD 2.12). 218 (15.8%) and 206 (14.8%) participants had anxiety and depressive symptoms, respectively. Shortage in facemasks (20.8%), alcohol-based hand sanitizers (13.9%), and cleaning products (7.3%) was reported. Participants generally disagree with the perception of at risk of getting infected in the coming 6 months (mean 2.2, SD 1.1), but tended to agree with the perception of worry that the people around pose a threat to them (mean 3.6, SD 0.9) and the outbreak has greatly affected their daily life (mean 3.7, SD 0.9). 59.3% employed participants had income reduction and 6.2% had become unemployed since the outbreak. Stress, anxiety, and depressive symptoms were more prevalent in those with shortages of preventive materials and negative perceptions of the outbreak (all P < 0.05). Reduction in income and unemployment were associated with more mental health symptoms (all P < 0.05). Conclusions: Shortage of preventive materials, negative perceptions, financial loss, and unemployment were prevalent during the outbreak and found in association with higher stress and more anxiety and depressive symptoms. Further research and urgent actions are warranted to relieve stress and promote mental health, targeting the many risk factors identified by our study.","Zhao, Sheng Zhi; Luk, Tzu Tsun; Wu, Yongda; Weng, Xue; Wong, Janet Yuen Ha; Wang, Man Ping; Lam, Tai Hing",Front Psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.617397; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34163379/,11

The initial outbreak was of considerable size first in China subsequently spread to the rest of the world. Immediately after the epidemic (which according to the World Health Organization had risen to pandemic status), the problem of whether or not to update the occupational risk assessment arose, also considering how the biological risk from SARS CoV-2 should be understood: specific or generic. To this end, we conducted a literature review to identify national health legislation and policies, examining how Italy has addressed the COVID-19 emergency in occupational health planning, in order to develop considerations on the need to update the Risk Assessment Document following the pandemic status. The data that emerged from the review of current legislation allowed us to conclude that the risk from SARS-CoV-2 is in most work activities to be understood as a generic or aggravated generic risk, requiring the employer to apply and control the preventive measures suggested by health authorities to contain the spread of the virus.","Cirrincione, Luigi; Rapisarda, Venerando; Mazzucco, Walter; Provenzano, Rosanna; Cannizzaro, Emanuele",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33918369/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18073729,11

Our present study investigated whether cinnamon water extract (CWE) may influence the differentiation of monocytes into macrophages and the activity of macrophage scavenger receptors, commonly observed in atherosclerotic lesions. METHODS: We investigated the effect of CWE on the expression of various surface markers and the uptake of acetylated low density lipoprotein (LDL) in phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA)-stimulated THP-1 cells. The protein levels of PMA or macrophage-colony stimulating factor (M-CSF)-stimulated type 1 macrophage scavenger receptor (SRA) were analyzed. Finally, the role of extracellar signal-related kinase (ERK) 1/2 in SRA synthesis and the effect of CWE on PMA-stimulated ERK1/2 were determined. RESULTS: CWE inhibited the differentiation of monocyte by decreasing the expression of CD11b, CD36 and SRA and the uptake of acetyl LDL. CWE suppressed the upregulation of SRA by M-CSF and modulated ERK1/2 activity, which was required for PMA-induced SRA synthesis. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that CWE was able to interfere with monocyte differentiation and macrophage scavenger activity, indicating its potential in preventing the development of atherosclerotic lesions.","Kang, Hee; Park, Sung-Hyun; Yun, Jeong-Moon; Nam, Tae-Gyu; Kim, Young-Eun; Kim, Dae-Ok; Kim, Youn Jung",BMC Complement Altern Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24602512/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1472-6882-14-90,11

However, there is currently little information on vaccine studies and commercially available vaccines for PDCoV. Hence, herein, a PDCoV strain, CH/XJYN/2016, was successfully isolated and serially propagated in vitro, and its biological characteristics were determined. Compared to that of previously reported and recently isolated PDCoV strains from China and the United States, the S gene of the CH/XJYN/2016 strain contains novel mutations. Infection studies revealed that CH/XJYN/2016 is pathogenic to suckling piglets and conventional weaned pigs. In addition, the median pig diarrhea dose (PDD(50)) of PDCoV in conventional weaned pigs was determined (2.0 log(10)PDD(50)/3 mL). Furthermore, an inactivated cell-adapted CH/XJYN/2016-based vaccine candidate was developed with different adjuvants. Compared with nonvaccinated pigs, conventional weaned pigs given the inactivated vaccine developed a potent humoral immune response and showed no clinical signs or viral shedding after challenge, indicating a potent protective effect of the vaccine against PDCoV infection. Therefore, the PDCoV vaccine developed in this study is a promising vaccine candidate that can be used for the control of PDCoV infection in pigs.","Gao, Xiang; Zhao, Donghong; Zhou, Peng; Zhang, Liping; Li, Mingxia; Li, Weiyan; Zhang, Yongguang; Wang, Yonglu; Liu, Xinsheng",Virus Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32247757/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170220300010?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2020.197955; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170220300010,11

Galactomannan index (GI) positivity in BAL was between 10% and 28%. GI in blood was found in 0.9% to 6.7% of the available samples. The prevalence of COVID-19-associated pulmonary aspergillosis ranged from 2.7% to 27.7%. Studies compared the mortality between defined cases and non-cases, and all showed increased mortality in cases. No studies showed that antifungal treatment reduced mortality. Concluding, this review showed how studies defined the clinical entity COVID-19-associated pulmonary aspergillosis where positive Aspergillus test in the respiratory sample was the main driver for the diagnosis. There were many differences between studies in terms of test algorithm and Aspergillus test used that largely determined the prevalence. Whether antifungal therapy, either as prophylaxis, pre-emptive or targeted therapy will lead to better outcomes of COVID-19-associated pulmonary aspergillosis patients is still need to be answered.","Yusuf, Erlangga; Seghers, Leonard; Hoek, Rogier A.

685429,Heterogeneity of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus: implications for current vaccine efficacy and future vaccine development,2000-06-12,"PURPOSE: Early identification of causative agents in lower respiratory infection of pediatric patients can reduce morbidity and prevent an overuse of antimicrobials. Two kinds of multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and a commercial shell vial viral culture were performed to identify causative agents in pediatric patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Nasopharyngeal aspirates of 220 children diagnosed with viral pneumonia were obtained. Two kinds of multiplex PCR (Seeplex™ RV detection kit, and Labopass™ RV detection kit), and a shell vial culture by R-Mix were performed. RESULTS: Positive samples from 220 total samples by two multiplex PCRs were 52.7% and 46.4%, respectively. We also cultured 103 samples that showed positive results of the adenovirus, influenza virus, parainfluenza virus, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) by two multiplex PCR. The RSV was most frequently detected in 53.0% (Seeplex) and 51.7% (Labopass) of patients. The detection rate of adenovirus (AdV) was 10.3% and 12.1%, influenza virus (IFV) A and B was 12.5% and 3.4%, and parainfluenza virus (PIFV) 1, 2, and 3 were 2.9% and 2.6%. Shell vial cultures showed concordant results with each multiplex PCR by 96.1% and 77.7%, respectively. Sequencing results were 90% consistent with multiplex PCR. CONCLUSION: Multiplex PCR showed more positivity than the shell vial culture and it can be an effective primary test. Other complementary efforts such as viral cultures and sequencing analysis could be considered, according to clinical and laboratory conditions.","Lee, Jong-Han; Chun, Jin-Kyong; Kim, Dong Soo; Park, Yongjung; Choi, Jong Rak; Kim, Hyon-Suk",Yonsei Med J,https://doi.org/10.3349/ymj.2010.51.5.761; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20635453/,11

With the continuous spread of the new coronavirus pneumonia epidemic in even the world, prevention and treatment of the disease have become urgent tasks. The drugs currently being developed are not adequate to deal with this critical situation. In addition to being controlled through effective isolation, we need a rapid response from the healthcare and biotechnology industries to accelerate drug treatment research. By reviewing the currently available literature published at home and abroad, we summarize the current research progress of drug treatment during the epidemic period. At present, the drugs that can be used for treatment mainly include antiviral drugs, antimalarials, glucocorticoids, plasma therapy, biological agents, and traditional Chinese medicine. The effectiveness and safety of drug therapy need to be confirmed by more clinical studies.","Yan, Junqiang; Liu, Anran; Huang, Jiarui; Wu, Jiannan; Fan, Hua",AAPS PharmSciTech,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32405780/; https://doi.org/10.1208/s12249-020-01679-z,11
686783,Mouse Hepatitis Virus Receptor as a Determinant of the Mouse Susceptibility to MHV Infection,2012-02-24,"BACKGROUND: The novel acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic imposed a national lockdown at the beginning of 2020. People faced social distancing, being forced to stay at home. Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) typically influences life habits and psycho-social relationship. It is now questionable how PAD can be affected by changes in lifestyle imposed by the Sars-CoV-19 Pandemic. This study's main objective is to evaluate how the limitations of social behavior set by Sars-CoV-19 Pandemic impact the perception and evolution of the disease in a group of patients with a diagnosed PAD. METHODS: The changes in the in the perception and the evolution of the PAD were evaluated by comparing results of a modified VascuQol-6 quality of life (QoL) survey referring to the time frame defined “No-Sars-CoV-2 period” (from July to December 2019) with results referring to the time frame defined “Sars-CoV-2 period” (from January to June 2020). An overall score (range 4-60) was calculated, and a comparison between the two period studies was reported. Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) Curves evaluated a delta value for each patient with revascularization of lower limb peripheral arteries. Optimal cut-offs were chosen based on their specificity, sensitivity. RESULTS: One-hundred-two PAD patients gave their informed consent to take part in the study. A significant general worsening of patients PAD perception in the Sars-CoV-2 period was recorded for the following items: lower limbs health status perception; overall activity limitation; walking ability limitation; overall daily walking distance; lower limbs fatigue perception; concerns about PAD worsening; pain discomfort (P < 0.05). The pain intensity changed from 4.7 ± 2.9 in the No-Sars-CoV-2 period to 6.3 ± 2.9 in the Sars-CoV-2 period significantly (P < 0.0001), even though analgesic drug intake did not increase considerably in Sars-CoV-2 period (P = 0.15). The overall score was 20.3 ± 7.4 for the No-Sars-CoV-2 period and 27.4 ± 7.6 in the Sars-CoV-2 period (P = 0.0001). The ROC curve built to analyze the relation between Delta-score and the need for revascularization identifies a cut-off > 8.5 (Area Under the Curve 0.5436; CI 95% 0.4252 to 0.6620) with a sensitivity and specificity respectively of 52.6% (CI 95% 37.26–67.52%) and 65.6% (CI 95% 53.40–76.08%). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with PAD were significantly hit by all the restrictions and the social limitations imposed to reduce the Sars-CoV-19 virus diffusion. Our study confirms that the perception and the evolution of PAD were significantly affected during the “Sars-CoV-2 period”.","de Donato, Gianmarco; Pasqui, Edoardo; Alba, Giuseppe; Abu Leil, Mustafa; Palasciano, Giancarlo",Ann Vasc Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33689759/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.avsg.2021.02.003; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0890509621001898; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0890509621001898?v=s5,11

This research examines the environmental risks, occupational health hazards, and health outcomes experienced by migrant dairy farm workers in Vermont. This research draws on a triangulation of sources including analysis of data—surveys and interviews with migrant dairy farmworkers gathered by the organization Migrant Justice since 2015 as well as relevant key informant interviews with community organizations across the state to characterize the occupational health experiences of migrant dairy workers in Vermont. Our results show that Vermont migrant dairy farmworkers received poor health and safety training and lacked sufficient protective gear. Over three quarters of the respondents reported experiencing harm from chemical and biological risks. Close to half the survey respondents reported headaches, itchy eyes and cough; a quarter reported breathing difficulties; three fourths reported being hurt by animal-related risks. These exposures and existing health concerns are avoidable. Migrant workers require better social representation and advocates to negotiate better work-related protection and training, access to health services, and social welfare to ensure their health and safety.","Panikkar, Bindu; Barrett, Mary-Kate",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33915975/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18073675,11

Depuis son éclosion, cette maladie a généré de nombreuses situations de l’exercice médical où la vie du patient ou son intégrité physique se trouvent menacées, et pour lesquelles l’intervention salvatrice urgente du médecin est indispensable. Cette intervention en urgence pour porter secours à personne en péril constitue avant tout une obligation morale mais également éthique, déontologique et légale. En effet, la non-assistance à personne est considérée pénalement comme un délit passible de sanctions graves. Toutefois, dans le contexte de la pandémie COVID-19, il existe un flou entourant cette infraction complexe, notamment en ce qui concerne l’évaluation du péril, et l’appréciation du risque pour soi ou pour autrui. D’où l’intérêt de ce travail qui se propose d’analyser les particularités du délit de non-assistance à personne en péril dans le contexte de la pandémie COVID-19, et de détailler les enjeux judiciaires dans le domaine pénal qui découlent de cette infraction. The COVID-19 infection is a serious disease, which causes to medical community many difficulties worldwide. This pandemic has generated many situations in the medical exercise for which the urgent saving intervention of the doctor is essential. This urgent intervention to rescue a person in danger is above all a moral obligation but, also an ethical, deontological and legal one. Indeed, the non-assistance to a person in danger is considered like a criminal offense, which is punishable by serious sanctions.However, in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, this complex offense still vague in the assessment of the danger and in the appreciation of the risk for oneself or for others. Here, we propose to decipher the particularities of the offense of failure to assist to a person in danger in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, and to detail the legal issues in the penal field that arise from this offense.","Ben Amar, W.; Karray, N.; Siala, H.; Zribi, M.; Lebkem, H.; Hammami, Z.; Maatoug, S.",,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S187865292100047X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S187865292100047X?v=s5,11

The definition of the correlates of protection necessary to manage the COVID-19 pandemic, require both immune parameters but the complexity of traditional tests limits virus-specific T cell measurements. Methods We test the sensitivity and performance of a simple and rapid SARS-CoV-2 Spike-specific T cell test based on stimulation of whole blood with peptides covering the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein followed by cytokine (IFN-γ, IL-2) measurement in different cohorts including BNT162b2 vaccinated (n=112; 201 samples), convalescent asymptomatic (n=62; 62 samples) and symptomatic (n=68; 115 samples) COVID-19 patients and SARS-CoV-1 convalescent individuals (n=12; 12 samples). Results The sensitivity of the rapid cytokine whole blood test equates traditional methods of T cell analysis (ELISPOT, Activation Induced Markers). Utilizing this test we observed that Spike-specific T cells in vaccinated preferentially target the S2 region of Spike and that their mean magnitude is similar between them and SARS-CoV-2 convalescents at 3 months after vaccine or virus priming respectively. However, a wide heterogeneity of Spike-specific T cell magnitude characterizes the individual responses irrespective of the time of analysis. No correlation between neutralizing antibody levels and Spike-specific T cell magnitude were found. Conclusions Rapid measurement of cytokine production in whole blood after peptide activation revealed a wide dynamic range of Spike-specific T cell response after vaccination that cannot be predicted from neutralizing antibody quantities. Both Spike-specific humoral and cellular immunity should be tested after vaccination to define the correlates of protection necessary to evaluate current vaccine strategies.","Tan, Anthony T; Lim, Joey Ming Er; Le Bert, Nina; Kunasegaran, Kamini; Chia, Adeline; Qui, Martin Daniel Co; Tan, Nicole; Chia, Wan Ni; de Alwis, Ruklanthi; Ying, Ding; Ooi, Eng Eong; Wang, Lin-Fa; Chen, Mark I-Cheng; Young, Barnaby; Hsu, Li Yang; Low, Jenny GH; Lye, David Chien; Bertoletti, Antonio",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.06.29.450293,11
