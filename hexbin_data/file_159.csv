346,Using Satellite Images of Environmental Changes to Predict Infectious Disease Outbreaks,2009-09-11,"Recent events clearly illustrate a continued vulnerability of large populations to infectious diseases, which is related to our changing human-constructed and natural environments. A single person with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in 2007 provided a wake-up call to the United States and global public health infrastructure, as the health professionals and the public realized that today’s ease of airline travel can potentially expose hundreds of persons to an untreatable disease associated with an infectious agent. Ease of travel, population increase, population displacement, pollution, agricultural activity, changing socioeconomic structures, and international conflicts worldwide have each contributed to infectious disease events. Today, however, nothing is larger in scale, has more potential for long-term effects, and is more uncertain than the effects of climate change on infectious disease outbreaks, epidemics, and pandemics. We discuss advances in our ability to predict these events and, in particular, the critical role that satellite imaging could play in mounting an effective response.","Ford, Timothy E.; Colwell, Rita R.; Rose, Joan B.; Morse, Stephen S.; Rogers, David J.; Yates, Terry L.",Emerg Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2819876/,159
522,Networks and the Epidemiology of Infectious Disease,2011-03-16,"The science of networks has revolutionised research into the dynamics of interacting elements. It could be argued that epidemiology in particular has embraced the potential of network theory more than any other discipline. Here we review the growing body of research concerning the spread of infectious diseases on networks, focusing on the interplay between network theory and epidemiology. The review is split into four main sections, which examine: the types of network relevant to epidemiology; the multitude of ways these networks can be characterised; the statistical methods that can be applied to infer the epidemiological parameters on a realised network; and finally simulation and analytical methods to determine epidemic dynamics on a given network. Given the breadth of areas covered and the ever-expanding number of publications, a comprehensive review of all work is impossible. Instead, we provide a personalised overview into the areas of network epidemiology that have seen the greatest progress in recent years or have the greatest potential to provide novel insights. As such, considerable importance is placed on analytical approaches and statistical methods which are both rapidly expanding fields. Throughout this review we restrict our attention to epidemiological issues.","Danon, Leon; Ford, Ashley P.; House, Thomas; Jewell, Chris P.; Keeling, Matt J.; Roberts, Gareth O.; Ross, Joshua V.; Vernon, Matthew C.",Interdiscip Perspect Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3062985/,159
557,Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2: Central Regulator for Cardiovascular Function,2010-04-20,"Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a new component of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). Accumulating evidence shows that ACE2 provides protective effects in peripheral tissues and has great potential for the treatment of RAS-related diseases. The role of ACE2 in the central nervous system is not well established. However, in recent years, much more progress has been made on the studies of this carboxypeptidase in the central regulation of blood pressure and cardiovascular function in general. It has been shown that brain ACE2 interacts with the other components of the RAS (ACE, angiotensin II, and angiotensin II type 1 receptor), protects baroreflex and autonomic function, stimulates nitric oxide release, reduces oxidative stress, and prevents the development of or attenuates hypertension. These data support the critical role of ACE2 in the central regulation of cardiovascular function. This review summarizes recently published data on the central effects of ACE2 in the regulation of cardiovascular function.","Xia, Huijing; Lazartigues, Eric",Current Hypertension Reports,http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc3093757?pdf=render,159
815,Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) and ACE2 Bind Integrins and ACE2 Regulates Integrin Signalling,2012-04-16,"The angiotensin converting enzymes (ACEs) are the key catalytic components of the renin-angiotensin system, mediating precise regulation of blood pressure by counterbalancing the effects of each other. Inhibition of ACE has been shown to improve pathology in cardiovascular disease, whilst ACE2 is cardioprotective in the failing heart. However, the mechanisms by which ACE2 mediates its cardioprotective functions have yet to be fully elucidated. Here we demonstrate that both ACE and ACE2 bind integrin subunits, in an RGD-independent manner, and that they can act as cell adhesion substrates. We show that cellular expression of ACE2 enhanced cell adhesion. Furthermore, we present evidence that soluble ACE2 (sACE2) is capable of suppressing integrin signalling mediated by FAK. In addition, sACE2 increases the expression of Akt, thereby lowering the proportion of the signalling molecule phosphorylated Akt. These results suggest that ACE2 plays a role in cell-cell interactions, possibly acting to fine-tune integrin signalling. Hence the expression and cleavage of ACE2 at the plasma membrane may influence cell-extracellular matrix interactions and the signalling that mediates cell survival and proliferation. As such, ectodomain shedding of ACE2 may play a role in the process of pathological cardiac remodelling.","Clarke, Nicola E.; Fisher, Martin J.; Porter, Karen E.; Lambert, Daniel W.; Turner, Anthony J.",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3327712/,159
910,Infectious Disease Transmission during Organ and Tissue Transplantation,2012-08-11,"Infectious disease transmission through organ and tissue transplantation has been associated with severe complications in recipients. Determination of donor-derived infectious risk associated with organ and tissue transplantation is challenging and limited by availability and performance characteristics of current donor epidemiologic screening (e.g., questionnaire) and laboratory testing tools. Common methods and standards for evaluating potential donors of organs and tissues are needed to facilitate effective data collection for assessing the risk for infectious disease transmission. Research programs can use advanced microbiological technologies to define infectious risks posed by pathogens that are known to be transplant transmissible and provide insights into transmission potential of emerging infectious diseases for which transmission characteristics are unknown. Key research needs are explored. Stakeholder collaboration for surveillance and research infrastructure is required to enhance transplant safety.","Greenwald, Melissa A.; Kuehnert, Matthew J.; Fishman, Jay A.",Emerg Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3414044/,159
1003,The influence of climatic conditions on the transmission dynamics of the 2009 A/H1N1 influenza pandemic in Chile,2012-11-13,"BACKGROUND: The role of demographic factors, climatic conditions, school cycles, and connectivity patterns in shaping the spatio-temporal dynamics of pandemic influenza is not clearly understood. Here we analyzed the spatial, age and temporal evolution of the 2009 A/H1N1 influenza pandemic in Chile, a southern hemisphere country covering a long and narrow strip comprising latitudes 17°S to 56°S. METHODS: We analyzed the dissemination patterns of the 2009 A/H1N1 pandemic across 15 regions of Chile based on daily hospitalizations for severe acute respiratory disease and laboratory confirmed A/H1N1 influenza infection from 01-May to 31-December, 2009. We explored the association between timing of pandemic onset and peak pandemic activity and several geographical and demographic indicators, school vacations, climatic factors, and international passengers. We also estimated the reproduction number (R) based on the growth rate of the exponential pandemic phase by date of symptoms onset, estimated using maximum likelihood methods. RESULTS: While earlier pandemic onset was associated with larger population size, there was no association with connectivity, demographic, school or climatic factors. In contrast, there was a latitudinal gradient in peak pandemic timing, representing a 16-39-day lag in disease activity from the southern regions relative to the northernmost region (P < 0.001). Geographical differences in latitude of Chilean regions, maximum temperature and specific humidity explained 68.5% of the variability in peak timing (P = 0.01). In addition, there was a decreasing gradient in reproduction number from south to north Chile (P < 0.0001). The regional mean R estimates were 1.6-2.0, 1.3-1.5, and 1.2-1.3 for southern, central and northern regions, respectively, which were not affected by the winter vacation period. CONCLUSIONS: There was a lag in the period of most intense 2009 pandemic influenza activity following a South to North traveling pattern across regions of Chile, significantly associated with geographical differences in minimum temperature and specific humidity. The latitudinal gradient in timing of pandemic activity was accompanied by a gradient in reproduction number (P < 0.0001). Intensified surveillance strategies in colder and drier southern regions could lead to earlier detection of pandemic influenza viruses and improved control outcomes.","Chowell, Gerardo; Towers, Sherry; Viboud, Cécile; Fuentes, Rodrigo; Sotomayor, Viviana; Simonsen, Lone; Miller, Mark A; Lima, Mauricio; Villarroel, Claudia; Chiu, Monica; Villarroel, Jose E; Olea, Andrea",BMC Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3518181/,159
1061,Age- and Sex-Specific Mortality Associated With the 1918–1919 Influenza Pandemic in Kentucky,2013-03-01,"Background. The reasons for the unusual age-specific mortality patterns of the 1918–1919 influenza pandemic remain unknown. Here we characterize pandemic-related mortality by single year of age in a unique statewide Kentucky data set and explore breakpoints in the age curves. Methods. Individual death certificates from Kentucky during 1911–1919 were abstracted by medically trained personnel. Pandemic-associated excess mortality rates were calculated by subtracting observed rates during pandemic months from rates in previous years, separately for each single year of age and by sex. Results. The age profile of excess mortality risk in fall 1918 was characterized by a maximum among infants, a minimum at ages 9–10 years, a maximum at ages 24–26 years, and a second minimum at ages 56–59 years. The excess mortality risk in young adults had been greatly attenuated by winter 1919. The age breakpoints of mortality risk did not differ between males and females. Conclusions. The observed mortality breakpoints in male and female cohorts born during 1859–1862, 1892–1894, and 1908–1909 did not coincide with known dates of historical pandemics. The atypical age mortality patterns of the 1918–1919 pandemic cannot be explained by military crowding, war-related factors, or prior immunity alone and likely result from a combination of unknown factors.","Viboud, Cécile; Eisenstein, Jana; Reid, Ann H.; Janczewski, Thomas A.; Morens, David M.; Taubenberger, Jeffery K.",J Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3563305/,159
1335,Minimizing the threat of pandemic emergence from avian influenza in poultry systems,2013-12-16,"BACKGROUND: Live-animal markets are a culturally important feature of meat distribution chains in many populations, yet they provide an opportunity for the maintenance and transmission of potentially emergent zoonotic pathogens. The ongoing human outbreak of avian H7N9 in China highlights the need for increased surveillance and control in these live-bird markets (LBMs). DISCUSSION: Closure of retail markets in affected areas rapidly decreased human cases to rare, sporadic occurrence, but little attention has been paid thus far to the role of upstream elements of the poultry distribution chain such as wholesale markets. This could partly explain why transmission in poultry populations has not been eliminated more broadly. We present surveillance data from both wholesale live-bird markets (wLBMs) and rLBMs in Shantou, China (from 2004–2006), and call on disease-dynamic theory to illustrate why closing rLBMs has only minor effects on the overall volume of transmission. We show that the length of time birds stay in rLBMs can severely limit transmission there, but that the system-wide effect may be reduced substantially by high levels of transmission upstream of retail markets. SUMMARY: Management plans that minimize transmission throughout the entire poultry supply chain are essential for minimizing exposure to the public. These include reducing stay-time of birds in markets to 1 day, standardizing poultry supply chains to limit transmission in pre-retail settings, and monitoring strains with epidemiological traits that pose a high risk of emergence. These actions will further limit human exposure to extant viruses and reduce the likelihood of the emergence of novel strains by decreasing the overall volume of transmission.","Pepin, Kim M; Lloyd-Smith, James O; Webb, Colleen T; Holcomb, Karen; Zhu, Huachen; Guan, Yi; Riley, Steven",BMC Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3878446/,159
1343,"Update on the Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2-Angiotensin (1–7)-Mas Receptor Axis: Fetal Programing, Sex Differences, and Intracellular Pathways",2014-01-09,"The renin-angiotensin-system (RAS) constitutes an important hormonal system in the physiological regulation of blood pressure. Indeed, dysregulation of the RAS may lead to the development of cardiovascular pathologies including kidney injury. Moreover, the blockade of this system by the inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) or antagonism of the angiotensin type 1 receptor (AT(1)R) constitutes an effective therapeutic regimen. It is now apparent with the identification of multiple components of the RAS that the system is comprised of different angiotensin peptides with diverse biological actions mediated by distinct receptor subtypes. The classic RAS can be defined as the ACE-Ang II-AT(1)R axis that promotes vasoconstriction, sodium retention, and other mechanisms to maintain blood pressure, as well as increased oxidative stress, fibrosis, cellular growth, and inflammation in pathological conditions. In contrast, the non-classical RAS composed of the ACE2-Ang-(1–7)-Mas receptor axis generally opposes the actions of a stimulated Ang II-AT(1)R axis through an increase in nitric oxide and prostaglandins and mediates vasodilation, natriuresis, diuresis, and oxidative stress. Thus, a reduced tone of the Ang-(1–7) system may contribute to these pathologies as well. Moreover, the non-classical RAS components may contribute to the effects of therapeutic blockade of the classical system to reduce blood pressure and attenuate various indices of renal injury. The review considers recent studies on the ACE2-Ang-(1–7)-Mas receptor axis regarding the precursor for Ang-(1–7), the intracellular expression and sex differences of this system, as well as an emerging role of the Ang1-(1–7) pathway in fetal programing events and cardiovascular dysfunction.","Chappell, Mark C.; Marshall, Allyson C.; Alzayadneh, Ebaa M.; Shaltout, Hossam A.; Diz, Debra I.",Front Endocrinol (Lausanne),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3886117/,159
1462,School closures during the 2009 influenza pandemic: national and local experiences,2014-04-16,"BACKGROUND: School closure is a non-pharmaceutical intervention that was considered in many national pandemic plans developed prior to the start of the influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 pandemic, and received considerable attention during the event. Here, we retrospectively review and compare national and local experiences with school closures in several countries during the A(H1N1)pdm09 pandemic. Our intention is not to make a systematic review of country experiences; rather, it is to present the diversity of school closure experiences and provide examples from national and local perspectives. METHODS: Data were gathered during and following a meeting, organized by the European Centres for Disease Control, on school closures held in October 2010 in Stockholm, Sweden. A standard data collection form was developed and sent to all participants. The twelve participating countries and administrative regions (Bulgaria, China, France, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR), Italy, Japan, New Zealand, Serbia, South Africa, Thailand, United Kingdom, and United States) provided data. RESULTS: Our review highlights the very diverse national and local experiences on school closures during the A(H1N1)pdm09 pandemic. The processes including who was in charge of making recommendations and who was in charge of making the decision to close, the school-based control strategies, the extent of school closures, the public health tradition of responses and expectations on school closure varied greatly between countries. Our review also discusses the many challenges associated with the implementation of this intervention and makes recommendations for further practical work in this area. CONCLUSIONS: The single most important factor to explain differences observed between countries may have been the different public health practises and public expectations concerning school closures and influenza in the selected countries.","Cauchemez, Simon; Van Kerkhove, Maria D; Archer, Brett N; Cetron, Martin; Cowling, Benjamin J; Grove, Peter; Hunt, Darren; Kojouharova, Mira; Kon, Predrag; Ungchusak, Kumnuan; Oshitani, Hitoshi; Pugliese, Andrea; Rizzo, Caterina; Saour, Guillaume; Sunagawa, Tomimase; Uzicanin, Amra; Wachtel, Claude; Weisfuse, Isaac; Yu, Hongjie; Nicoll, Angus",BMC Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4021091/,159
1736,Genetic diversity of the 2013–14 human isolates of influenza H7N9 in China,2015-02-28,"BACKGROUND: Influenza H7N9 has become an endemic pathogen in China where circulating virus is found extensively in wild birds and domestic poultry. Two epidemic waves of Human H7N9 infections have taken place in Eastern and South Central China during the years of 2013 and 2014. In this study, we report on the first four human cases of influenza H7N9 in Shantou, Guangdong province, which occurred during the second H7N9 wave, and the subsequent analysis of the viral isolates. METHODS: Viral genomes were subjected to multisegment amplification and sequenced in an Illumina MiSeq. Later, phylogenetic analyses of influenza H7N9 viruses were performed to establish the evolutionary context of the disease in humans. RESULTS: The sequences of the isolates from Shantou have closer evolutionary proximity to the predominant Eastern H7N9 cluster (similar to A/Shanghai/1/2013 (H7N9)) than to the Southern H7N9 cluster (similar to A/Guangdong/1/2013 (H7N9)). CONCLUSIONS: Two distinct phylogenetic groups of influenza H7N9 circulate currently in China and cause infections in humans as a consequence of cross-species spillover from the avian disease. The Eastern cluster, which includes the four isolates from Shantou, presents a wide geographic distribution and overlaps with the more restricted area of circulation of the Southern cluster. Continued monitoring of the avian disease is of critical importance to better understand and predict the epidemiological behaviour of the human cases.

1761,The combination of decoy receptor 3 and soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-1 for the diagnosis of nosocomial bacterial meningitis,2015-03-23,"BACKGROUND: Early diagnosis and appropriate antibiotic treatment can significantly reduce mortality of nosocomial bacterial meningitis. However, it is a challenge for clinicians to make an accurate and rapid diagnosis of bacterial meningitis. This study aimed at determining whether combined biomarkers can provide a useful tool for the diagnosis of bacterial meningitis. METHODS: A retrospective study was carried out. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of decoy receptor 3 (DcR3) and soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-1 (sTREM-1) were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). RESULTS: The patients with bacterial meningitis had significantly elevated levels of the above mentioned biomarkers. The two biomarkers were all risk factors with bacterial meningitis. The biomarkers were constructed into a “bioscore”. The discriminative performance of the bioscore was better than that of each biomarker, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) of 0.842 (95% confidence intervals (CI) 0.770–0.914; p< 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Combined measurement of CSF DcR3 and sTREM-1 concentrations improved the prediction of nosocomial bacterial meningitis. The combined strategy is of interest and the validation of that improvement needs further studies.","Liu, Yong-Juan; Shao, Li-Hua; Zhang, Jian; Fu, Shan-Ji; Wang, Gang; Chen, Feng-Zhe; Zheng, Feng; Ma, Rui-Ping; Liu, Hai-Hong; Dong, Xiao-Meng; Ma, Li-Xian",Ann Clin Microbiol Antimicrob,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4373519/,159
1811,Epidemiology and Virology of Acute Respiratory Infections During the First Year of Life: A Birth Cohort Study in Vietnam,2015-03-24,"BACKGROUND: Understanding viral etiology and age-specific incidence of acute respiratory infections in infants can help identify risk groups and inform vaccine delivery, but community-based data is lacking from tropical settings. METHODS: One thousand four hundred and seventy-eight infants in urban Ho Chi Minh City and 981 infants in a semi-rural district in southern Vietnam were enrolled at birth and followed to 1 year of age. Acute respiratory infection (ARI) episodes were identified through clinic-based illness surveillance, hospital admissions and self-reports. Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from infants with respiratory symptoms and tested for 14 respiratory pathogens using multiplex reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Estimated incidence of ARI was 542 and 2691 per 1000 infant-years, and hospitalization rates for ARI were 81 and 138 per 1000 infant-years, in urban and semi-rural cohorts, respectively, from clinic- and hospital-based surveillance. However self-reported ARI episodes were just 1.5-fold higher in the semi-rural versus urban cohort, indicating that part of the urban–rural difference was explained by under-ascertainment in the urban cohort. Incidence was higher in infants ≥6 months of age than <6 months, but this was pathogen-specific. One or more viruses were detected in 53% (urban) and 64% (semi-rural) of samples from outpatients with ARI and in 78% and 66% of samples from hospitalized ARI patients, respectively. The most frequently detected viruses were rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, influenza virus A and bocavirus. ARI-associated hospitalizations were associated with longer stays and more frequent ICU admission than other infections. CONCLUSIONS: ARI is a significant cause of morbidity in Vietnamese infants and influenza virus A is an under-appreciated cause of vaccine-preventable disease and hospitalizations in this tropical setting. Public health strategies to reduce infant ARI incidence and hospitalization rates are needed.","Anders, Katherine L.; Nguyen, Hoa L.; Nguyen, Nguyet Minh; Van Thuy, Nguyen Thi; Hong Van, Nguyen Thi; Hieu, Nguyen Trong; Hong Tham, Nguyen Thi; Thanh Ha, Phan Thi; Lien, Le Bich; Vinh Chau, Nguyen Van; Ty Hang, Vu Thi; van Doorn, H.

1897,Immunogenicity and Safety of an EB66 Cell-Culture-Derived Influenza A/Indonesia/5/2005(H5N1) AS03-Adjuvanted Vaccine: A Phase 1 Randomized Trial,2015-08-15,"BACKGROUND: Cell-culture-derived (CC) influenza vaccine production methods could provide benefits over classical embryonated-egg technology, including a higher production capacity and the faster creation of a supply that meets demand. METHODS: A CC-inactivated split-virus influenza A/Indonesia/5/2005(H5N1) vaccine derived from the EB66 cell line (hereafter, “CC-H5N1”) was investigated in a phase 1 randomized, blinded study. Healthy adults (n = 521) received 2 vaccine doses (days 0 and 21) of either investigational CC-H5N1 vaccine (1.9 µg or 3.75 µg of hemagglutinin antigen [HA] with the AS03 adjuvant system or 15 µg of plain HA), embryonated-egg-derived vaccines (3.75 µg of HA with AS03 or 15 µg of plain HA), or placebo. Assessment of the adjuvant effect and immunogenicity was performed using Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research acceptability criteria 21 days after dose 2. Safety was assessed until month 12. RESULTS: AS03-adjuvanted CC-H5N1 elicited a homologous hemagglutination inhibition antibody response that satisfied immunogenicity criteria 21 days after dose 2 and persisted at month 12. Adjuvant effect and immune response against a drift-variant strain were demonstrated. No vaccine-related serious adverse events were reported. The immunogenicity and safety of the CC-H5N1 formulation containing 3.75 µg of HA and AS03 appeared to be similar to those for the licensed egg-derived AS03-adjuvanted control vaccine. CONCLUSIONS: The feasibility of the EB66 cell line to produce an immunogenic influenza vaccine with acceptable safety profile was demonstrated. Antigen sparing was achieved through combination with AS03 adjuvant. This CC-H5N1 might contribute to the rapid access of vaccine in the event of an influenza A(H5N1) pandemic.

1924,"Pneumonia among adults hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed seasonal influenza virus infection—United States, 2005–2008",2015-08-26,"BACKGROUND: Influenza and pneumonia combined are the leading causes of death due to infectious diseases in the United States. We describe factors associated with pneumonia among adults hospitalized with influenza. METHODS: Through the Emerging Infections Program, we identified adults ≥ 18 years, who were hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed influenza during October 2005 through April 2008, and had a chest radiograph (CXR) performed. Pneumonia was defined as the presence of a CXR infiltrate and either an ICD-9-CM code or discharge summary diagnosis of pneumonia. RESULTS: Among 4,765 adults hospitalized with influenza, 1392 (29 %) had pneumonia. In multivariable analysis, factors associated with pneumonia included: age ≥ 75 years, adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 1.27 (95 % confidence interval 1.10–1.46), white race AOR 1.24 (1.03–1.49), nursing home residence AOR 1.37 (1.14–1.66), chronic lung disease AOR 1.37 (1.18–1.59), immunosuppression AOR 1.45 (1.19–1.78), and asthma AOR 0.76 (0.62–0.92). Patients with pneumonia were significantly more likely to require intensive care unit (ICU) admission (27 % vs. 10 %), mechanical ventilation (18 % vs. 5 %), and to die (9 % vs. 2 %). CONCLUSIONS: Pneumonia was present in nearly one-third of adults hospitalized with influenza and was associated with ICU admission and death. Among patients hospitalized with influenza, older patients and those with certain underlying conditions are more likely to have pneumonia. Pneumonia is common among adults hospitalized with influenza and should be evaluated and treated promptly.

3535,The role of pneumonia and secondary bacterial infection in fatal and serious outcomes of pandemic influenza a(H1N1)pdm09,2018-12-07,"BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of pneumonia and secondary bacterial infections during the pandemic of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09. METHODS: A systematic review was conducted to identify relevant literature in which clinical outcomes of pandemic influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 infection were described. Published studies (between 01/01/2009 and 05/07/2012) describing cases of fatal or hospitalised A(H1N1)pdm09 and including data on bacterial testing or co-infection. RESULTS: Seventy five studies met the inclusion criteria. Fatal cases with autopsy specimen testing were reported in 11 studies, in which any co-infection was identified in 23% of cases (Streptococcus pneumoniae 29%). Eleven studies reported bacterial co-infection among hospitalised cases of A(H1N1)2009pdm with confirmed pneumonia, with a mean of 19% positive for bacteria (Streptococcus pneumoniae 54%). Of 16 studies of intensive care unit (ICU) patients, bacterial co-infection identified in a mean of 19% of cases (Streptococcus pneumoniae 26%). The mean prevalence of bacterial co-infection was 12% in studies of hospitalised patients not requiring ICU (Streptococcus pneumoniae 33%) and 16% in studies of paediatric patients hospitalised in general or pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) wards (Streptococcus pneumoniae 16%). CONCLUSION: We found that few studies of the 2009 influenza pandemic reported on bacterial complications and testing. Of studies which did report on this, secondary bacterial infection was identified in almost one in four patients, with Streptococcus pneumoniae the most common bacteria identified. Bacterial complications were associated with serious outcomes such as death and admission to intensive care. Prevention and treatment of bacterial secondary infection should be an integral part of pandemic planning, and improved uptake of routine pneumococcal vaccination in adults with an indication may reduce the impact of a pandemic.","MacIntyre, Chandini Raina; Chughtai, Abrar Ahmad; Barnes, Michelle; Ridda, Iman; Seale, Holly; Toms, Renin; Heywood, Anita",BMC Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6286525/,159
3638,A year of terror and a century of reflection: perspectives on the great influenza pandemic of 1918–1919,2019-02-06,"BACKGROUND: In the spring of 1918, the “War to End All Wars”, which would ultimately claim more than 37 million lives, had entered into its final year and would change the global political and economic landscape forever. At the same time, a new global threat was emerging and would become one of the most devastating global health crises in recorded history. MAIN TEXT: The 1918 H1N1 pandemic virus spread across Europe, North America, and Asia over a 12-month period resulting in an estimated 500 million infections and 50–100 million deaths worldwide, of which ~ 50% of these occurred within the fall of 1918 (Emerg Infect Dis 12:15-22, 2006, Bull Hist Med 76:105-115, 2002). However, the molecular factors that contributed to the emergence of, and subsequent public health catastrophe associated with, the 1918 pandemic virus remained largely unknown until 2005, when the characterization of the reconstructed pandemic virus was announced heralding a new era of advanced molecular investigations (Science 310:77-80, 2005). In the century following the emergence of the 1918 pandemic virus we have landed on the Moon, developed the electronic computer (and a global internet), and have eradicated smallpox. In contrast, we have a largely remedial knowledge and understanding of one of the greatest scourges in recorded history. CONCLUSION: Here, we reflect on the 1918 influenza pandemic, including its emergence and subsequent rapid global spread. In addition, we discuss the pathophysiology associated with the 1918 virus and its predilection for the young and healthy, the rise of influenza therapeutic research following the pandemic, and, finally, our level of preparedness for future pandemics.","Nickol, Michaela E.; Kindrachuk, Jason",BMC Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6364422/,159
3739,The Way Forward: Potentiating Protective Immunity to Novel and Pandemic Influenza Through Engagement of Memory CD4 T Cells,2019-04-15,"Potentially pandemic strains of influenza pose an undeniable threat to human populations. Therefore, it is essential to develop better strategies to enhance vaccine design and predict parameters that identify susceptible humans. CD4 T cells are a central component of protective immunity to influenza, delivering direct effector function and potentiating responses of other lymphoid cells. Humans have highly diverse influenza-specific CD4 T-cell populations that vary in stimulation history, specificity, and functionality. These complexities constitute a formidable obstacle to predicting immune responses to pandemic strains of influenza and derivation of optimal vaccine strategies. We suggest that more precise efforts to identify and enumerate both the positive and negative contributors of immunity in the CD4 T-cell compartment will aid in both predicting susceptible hosts and in development of vaccination strategies that will poise most human subjects to respond to pandemic influenza strains with protective immune responses.","Sant, Andrea J",J Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6452298/,159
4026,A descriptive analysis of the Spatio-temporal distribution of intestinal infectious diseases in China,2019-09-02,"BACKGROUND: Intestinal infectious diseases (IIDs) have caused numerous deaths worldwide, particularly among children. In China, eight IIDs are listed as notifiable infectious diseases, including cholera, poliomyelitis, dysentery, typhoid and paratyphoid (TAP), viral Hepatitis A, viral Hepatitis E, hand-foot-mouth disease (HFMD) and other infectious diarrhoeal diseases (OIDDs). The aim of the study is to analyse the spatio-temporal distribution of IIDs from 2006 to 2016. METHODS: Data on the incidence of IIDs from 2006 to 2016 were collected from the public health science data centre issued by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. This study applied seasonal decomposition analysis, spatial autocorrelation analysis and space-time scan analysis. Plots and maps were constructed to visualize the spatio-temporal distribution of IIDs. RESULTS: Regarding temporal analysis, the incidence of HFMD and Hepatitis E showed a distinct increasing trend, while the incidence of TAP, dysentery, and Hepatitis A presented decreasing trends over the last decade. The incidence of OIID remained steady. Summer is the season with the greatest number of cases of different IIDs. Regarding the spatial distribution, approximately all p values for the global Moran’s I from 2006 to 2016 were less than 0.05, indicating that the incidences of the epidemics were unevenly distributed throughout the country. The high-risk areas for HFMD and OIDD were located in the Beijing-Tianjin-Tangshan (BTT) region and south China. The high-risk areas for TAP were located in some parts of southwest China. A higher incidence rates for dysentery and Hepatitis A were observed in the BTT region and some west provincial units. The high-risk areas for Hepatitis E were the BTT region and the Yangtze River Delta area. CONCLUSIONS: Based on our temporal and spatial analysis of IIDs, we identified the high-risk periods and clusters of regions for the diseases. HFMD and OIDD exhibited high incidence rates, which reflected the negligence of Class C diseases by the government. At the same time, the incidence rate of Hepatitis E gradually surpassed Hepatitis A. The authorities should pay more attention to Class C diseases and Hepatitis E. Regardless of the various distribution patterns of IIDs, disease-specific, location-specific, and disease-combined interventions should be established.

Stochastic population data cause oscillations to be sustained rather than damped, and data analysis regarding the oscillations provides insights into the same set of population data. Notably, oscillations arise naturally from the model, instead of from a periodic forcing term or other exogenous mechanism that guarantees oscillation: the model has no such mechanism. These emergent natural oscillations display appropriate periodicity for smallpox, even when the model is applied to different locations and populations. The model and datasets, in turn, offer new observations about disease dynamics and solution trajectories. These results call for renewed attention to relatively simple models, in combination with datasets from real outbreaks.","Greer, Meredith; Saha, Raj; Gogliettino, Alex; Yu, Chialin; Zollo-Venecek, Kyle",R Soc Open Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7029885/,159

For example, Ribonucleases (RNases) are enzymes relevant to several biologic processes; then, theoretical and experimental study of the molecular diversity of Peptide Mass Fingerprints (PMFs) of RNases is useful for drug design. This study introduces a methodology that combines QSAR models, 2D-Electrophoresis (2D-E), MALDI-TOF Mass Spectroscopy (MS), BLAST alignment, and Molecular Dynamics (MD) to explore PMFs of RNases. We illustrate this approach by investigating for the first time the PMFs of a new protein of L. infantum. Here we report and compare new versus old predictive models for RNases based on Topological Indices (TIs) of Markov Pseudo-Folding Lattices. These group of indices called Pseudo-folding Lattice 2D-TIs include: Spectral moments π (k)(x,y), Mean Electrostatic potentials ξ (k)(x,y), and Entropy measures θ (k)(x,y). The accuracy of the models (training/cross-validation) was as follows: ξ (k)(x,y)-model (96.0%/91.7%)>π (k)(x,y)-model (84.7/83.3) > θ (k)(x,y)-model (66.0/66.7). We also carried out a 2D-E analysis of biological samples of L. infantum promastigotes focusing on a 2D-E gel spot of one unknown protein with M<20, 100 and pI <7. MASCOT search identified 20 proteins with Mowse score >30, but not one >52 (threshold value), the higher value of 42 was for a probable DNA-directed RNA polymerase. However, we determined experimentally the sequence of more than 140 peptides. We used QSAR models to predict RNase scores for these peptides and BLAST alignment to confirm some results. We also calculated 3D-folding TIs based on MD experiments and compared 2D versus 3D-TIs on molecular phylogenetic analysis of the molecular diversity of these peptides. This combined strategy may be of interest in drug development or target identification.

5337,Zoonoses,2004,"BACKGROUND, AIMS AND SCOPE: Current studies have paid little attention to the dynamism in urban spatial expansion and its possible environmental and health effects or to the health effects of rapid urban environmental change at different points along the urbanisation gradient. This study adopts a public health ecology approach to systematically understand the relationship between urbanisation, urban environmental change and human health in China. METHOD: Remote sensing image analysis, based on night light data at five different time periods in recent decades, was used to determine changes to the overall urban area. Through a review of the evidence on the relationships between environmental health, urbanisation and health, we advance a pathway framework for explaining urban human health ecology. The Spearman rank correlation coefficient was used to measure the correlation between disease prevalence and urbanisation level, adding a further dimension to a systemic understanding of urban health. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Urban areas have been increasing spatially, but unevenly, in recent decades, with medium and small cities also expanding rapidly in the past decade. Urbanisation and urban expansion result in changes to land use/coverage change, the urban environment and the residents’ lifestyle, which result in human health problems. Regions with the highest urbanisation level were more inclined to have a high prevalence of chronic disease in recent decades. An ecological public health approach provides insights into the multiple types of data which need to be routinely collected if human disease is not to become a barrier to social and economic development.","Li, Xinhu; Wang, Cuiping; Zhang, Guoqin; Xiao, Lishan; Dixon, Jane",Environ Sci Pollut Res Int,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7088762/,159
5444,Avian Influenza,2005,"Relationships between viruses and their human host are traditionally described from the point of view taking into consideration hosts as victims of viral aggression, which results in infectious diseases. However, these relations are in fact two-sided and involve modifications of both the virus and host genomes. Mutations that accumulate in the populations of viruses and hosts may provide them advantages such as the ability to overcome defense barriers of host cells or to create more efficient barriers to deal with the attack of the viral agent. One of the most common ways of reinforcing anti-viral barriers is the horizontal transfer of viral genes into the host genome. Within the host genome, these genes may be modified and extensively expressed to compete with viral copies and inhibit the synthesis of their products or modulate their functions in other ways. This review summarizes the available data on the horizontal gene transfer between viral and human genomes and discusses related problems.","Blinov, V. M.; Zverev, V. V.; Krasnov, G. S.; Filatov, F.

6446,Severe combined immune deficiency presenting with cyclic hematopoiesis,1991,"Surfactant proteins are well known from the human lung where they are responsible for the stability and flexibility of the pulmonary surfactant system. They are able to influence the surface tension of the gas–liquid interface specifically by directly interacting with single lipids. This work describes the generation of reliable protein structure models to support the experimental characterization of two novel putative surfactant proteins called SP-G and SP-H. The obtained protein models were complemented by predicted posttranslational modifications and placed in a lipid model system mimicking the pulmonary surface. Molecular dynamics simulations of these protein-lipid systems showed the stability of the protein models and the formation of interactions between protein surface and lipid head groups on an atomic scale. Thereby, interaction interface and strength seem to be dependent on orientation and posttranslational modification of the protein. The here presented modeling was fundamental for experimental localization studies and the simulations showed that SP-G and SP-H are theoretically able to interact with lipid systems and thus are members of the surfactant protein family.

6561,Management of Fulminant Hepatitis B,2019-06-04,"Chickenpox is often considered more severe during the first year of life, but its course is usually mild during the first 3 months of life, presumably owing to the persistence of maternal antibodies. Hospitalization and intravenous acyclovir therapy are generally restricted to severe cases but also systematically recommended in newborns in France, irrespective of the clinical severity of the infection. This recommendation was launched in 1998 when Varicella zoster virus (VZV)-specific immunoglobulins were not available in the country and has remained unchanged since. The aim of this prospective observational study was to describe complications of varicella infection in a population of 745 children hospitalized for varicella before 1 year of age, with a specific focus on newborns. Complications occurred in 65% of cases. They were very rare before the age of 1 month (10%) but their incidence then increased progressively with age and probably the disappearance of maternal antibodies: 42% (1–2 months), 66% (3–5 months), 70% (6–8 months), and 79% (9–12 months). Conclusion Chickenpox is usually mild in newborns because most of them are protected by VZV maternal antibodies. Unless the absence of maternal VZV immunity is demonstrated, newborns with mild chickenpox should not require antiviral therapy.","Lécuyer, Aurélie; Levy, Corinne; Gaudelus, Joel; Floret, Daniel; Soubeyrand, Benoit; Caulin, Evelyne; Cohen, Robert; Grimprel, Emmanuel",Eur J Pediatr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7101746/,159

Although PVAT has long been regarded as simply a structural unit providing mechanical support to vasculature, it is now gaining reputation as an integral endocrine/paracrine component, in addition to the well-established modulator endothelium, in regulating vascular tone. Since the discovery of anti-contractile effect of PVAT in 1991, the use of multiple rodent models of reduced amounts of PVAT has revealed its regulatory role in vascular remodeling and cardiovascular implications, including atherosclerosis. PVAT does not only release PVAT-derived relaxing factors (PVRFs) to activate multiple subsets of endothelial and vascular smooth muscle potassium channels and anti-inflammatory signals in the vasculature, but it does also provide an interface for neuron-adipocyte interactions in the vascular wall to regulate arterial vascular tone. In this review, we outline our current understanding towards PVAT and attempt to provide hints about future studies that can sharpen the therapeutic potential of PVAT against cardiovascular diseases and their complications.","Cheng, Chak Kwong; Bakar, Hamidah Abu; Gollasch, Maik; Huang, Yu",Cardiovasc Drugs Ther,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7101924/,159

DHF/DSS occur mainly due to secondary infection by a heterotype DV infection in children and adults but in infants even primary infection by DV causes DHF/DSS. Clinical manifestations of DHF/DSS are more significantly associated with death in infants compared with older children. Vertical transmission of DV and anti-DV IgG has been well reported and is responsible for the pathogenesis of DV disease and its manifestations in infants. The complex pathogenesis of DHF/DSS during primary dengue in infants, with multiple age-related confounding factors, offers unique challenges to investigators. Dengue in infants is not often studied in detail due to practical limitations, but looking at the magnitude of DHF/DSS in infants and the unique opportunities this model provides, there is a need to focus on this problem.

A focal skin puncture and subcutaneous swelling over the dorsal part of the head were detected on physical examination. Neurological examination indicated lesion(s) in the right forebrain in four cats, multifocal forebrain in one cat, left forebrain in one cat, and multifocal forebrain and brainstem in the remaining cat. In all cats, magnetic resonance imaging revealed a space-occupying forebrain lesion causing a severe mass effect on adjacent brain parenchyma. CLINICAL APPROACH AND OUTCOME: All cats were managed with a combination of medical and surgical treatment. At surgery a small penetrating calvarial fracture was detected in all cats, and a tooth fragment was found within the content of the abscess in two cats. The combination of surgical intervention, intensive care and intravenous antimicrobials led to a return to normal neurological function in five cats. PRACTICAL RELEVANCE: As this series of cases indicates, successful resolution of a brain abscess due to a bite injury depends on early recognition and combined used of antimicrobials and surgical intervention. A particular aim of surgery is to remove any skull and foreign body (tooth) fragments that may represent a continuing focus of infection.","Costanzo, Chiara; Garosi, Laurent S.; Glass, Eric N.; Rusbridge, Clare; Stalin, Catherine E.; Volk, Holger A.",J Feline Med Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7130018/,159

8453,The concept of commensal viruses almost 20 years later: redefining borders in clinical virology,2017-03-11,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is acquired as a systemic “trait” by individuals who are genetically susceptible. This condition does not involve the central nervous system (CNS) and is characterized by a state of hyperactive immunocompetent responsiveness. It develops as the result of an antigenic challenge by a viral protein, either from a viral infection or a vaccination. In order for MS to become a disease affecting the CNS, it is necessary for the blood-brain barrier's (BBB) impermeability to be altered. This is now a fully recognized fact. As a result of this change, the MS lesion, which consists of edema and inflammation occurs. It may but need not lead to demyelination. Several mechanisms can cause this increased permeability of the BBB. The role of the immune system, and in particular of T lymphocytes in initiating and continuing the process of lesion formation remains extremely controversial. In fact, there are unanswered questions regarding the actual target of MS: is it the myelin sheath itself or its forming cell, the oligodendrocyte, or is it the BBB itself leading to bystander demyelination? The role of mild, concussional trauma to the CNS in producing the alteration of the BBB and therefore acting as a trigger or facilitator in the development or enlargement of MS lesions in the CNS, is based on considerable clinical, neuropathological and experimental evidence.

With the changing pattern in the etiological profile of CAP and advances in medical techniques in diagnosis and treatment over time, Chinese Thoracic Society of Chinese Medical Association updated its CAP guideline in 2016 to address the standard management of CAP in Chinese adults. Extensive and comprehensive literature search was made to collect the data and evidence for experts to review and evaluate the level of evidence. Corresponding recommendations are provided appropriately based on the level of evidence. This updated guideline covers comprehensive topics on CAP, including aetiology, antimicrobial resistance profile, diagnosis, empirical and targeted treatments, adjunctive and supportive therapies, as well as prophylaxis. The recommendations may help clinicians manage CAP patients more effectively and efficiently. CAP in pediatric patients and immunocompromised adults is beyond the scope of this guideline. This guideline is only applicable for the immunocompetent CAP patients aged 18 years and older. The recommendations on selection of antimicrobial agents and the dosing regimens are not mandatory. The clinicians are recommended to prescribe and adjust antimicrobial therapies primarily based on their local etiological profile and results of susceptibility testing, with reference to this guideline.","Cao, Bin; Huang, Yi; She, Dan‐Yang; Cheng, Qi‐Jian; Fan, Hong; Tian, Xin‐Lun; Xu, Jin‐Fu; Zhang, Jing; Chen, Yu; Shen, Ning; Wang, Hui; Jiang, Mei; Zhang, Xiang‐Yan; Shi, Yi; He, Bei; He, Li‐Xian; Liu, You‐Ning; Qu, Jie‐Ming",Clin Respir J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7162259/,159
9873,Clinical features of Chlamydia pneumoniae acute respiratory infection,2015-01-01,"Achieving accurate, real-time estimates of disease activity is challenged by delays in case reporting. “Nowcast” approaches attempt to estimate the complete case counts for a given reporting date, using a time series of case reports that is known to be incomplete due to reporting delays. Modeling the reporting delay distribution is a common feature of nowcast approaches. However, many nowcast approaches ignore a crucial feature of infectious disease transmission—that future cases are intrinsically linked to past reported cases—and are optimized to one or two applications, which may limit generalizability. Here, we present a Bayesian approach, NobBS (Nowcasting by Bayesian Smoothing) capable of producing smooth and accurate nowcasts in multiple disease settings. We test NobBS on dengue in Puerto Rico and influenza-like illness (ILI) in the United States to examine performance and robustness across settings exhibiting a range of common reporting delay characteristics (from stable to time-varying), and compare this approach with a published nowcasting software package while investigating the features of each approach that contribute to good or poor performance. We show that introducing a temporal relationship between cases considerably improves performance when the reporting delay distribution is time-varying, and we identify trade-offs in the role of moving windows to accurately capture changes in the delay. We present software implementing this new approach (R package “NobBS”) for widespread application and provide practical guidance on implementation.","McGough, Sarah F.; Johansson, Michael A.; Lipsitch, Marc; Menzies, Nicolas A.",PLoS Comput Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7162546/,159
10320,Infections after T‐replete haploidentical transplantation and high‐dose cyclophosphamide as graft‐versus‐host disease prophylaxis,2015-03-26,"BACKGROUND: Red blood cell (RBC) transfusion risks could be reduced if a robust technology for pathogen inactivation of RBC (PI‐RBCs) were to be approved. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Estimates of per‐unit and per‐patient aggregate infectious risks for conventional RBCs were calculated; the latter used patient diagnosis as a determinant of estimated lifetime exposure to RBC units. Existing in vitro data for the two technologies under development for producing PI‐RBCs and the status of current clinical trials are reviewed. RESULTS: Minimum and maximum per‐unit risk were calculated as 0.0003% (1 in 323,000) and 0.12% (1 in 831), respectively. The minimum estimate is for known lower‐risk pathogens while the maximal estimate also includes an emerging infectious agent (EIA) and endemic area Babesia risk. Minimum and maximum per‐patient lifetime risks by diagnosis grouping were estimated as 1.5 and 3.3%, respectively, for stem cell transplantation (which includes additional risk for cytomegalovirus transmission); 1.2 and 3.7%, respectively, for myelodysplastic syndrome; and 0.2 and 44%, respectively, for hemoglobinopathy. DISCUSSION: There is potential for PI technologies to reduce infectious RBC risk and to provide additional benefits (e.g., prevention of transfusion‐associated graft‐versus‐host disease and possible reduction of alloimmunization) due to white blood cell inactivation. PI‐RBCs should be viewed in the context of having a fully PI‐treated blood supply, enabling a blood safety paradigm shift from reactive to proactive. Providing insurance against new EIAs. Further, when approved, the use of PI for all components may catalyze operational changes in blood donor screening, laboratory testing, and component manufacturing.","Kleinman, Steve; Stassinopoulos, Adonis",Transfusion,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7169855/,159

11877,Influenza A(H5N1) Vaccines: Are We Better Prepared for the Next Pandemic?,2014-01-01,"BACKGROUND: Influenza is known to be associated with various neurological complications, including encephalitis. We conducted a registry-based study to assess the risk of encephalitis after influenza and A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccine. METHODS: Data from Norwegian national health registries during 2008–14 were linked using the unique personal identifiers given to all Norwegian residents (N = 5 210 519). Cox proportional-hazard models with time-varying variables were fitted to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) of encephalitis after influenza and A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccine, using the risk windows 0–7, 0–14, 0–30, 0–60, 0–90 and 0–180 days. RESULTS: In Norway, 684 172 individuals received an influenza diagnosis and 2793 patients were hospitalized with encephalitis during 2008–14. The risk of encephalitis increased after influenza: HR, 7-day risk window: 47.8 (95% confidence interval (CI): 35.8–63.8), and the HR decreased for longer risk windows; HR, 180-day risk window: 3.8 (95% CI: 3.1–4.7). HR of encephalitis after influenza during the 2009 main pandemic wave using a 7-day risk window was 30.0 (95% CI: 10.8–83.2). We found no differences in the risk of encephalitis after the seasonal influenza compared with influenza during the 2009 main pandemic wave; HR, 7-day risk window: 1.3 (95% CI: 0.4–4.3). A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccine was not associated with the risk of encephalitis: HR, 14-day risk window: 0.6 (95% CI: 0.2–2.1). CONCLUSIONS: There was an increased risk of encephalitis following influenza but not after A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccine. The risk of encephalitis was highest in the first few weeks after influenza.","Ghaderi, Sara; Størdal, Ketil; Gunnes, Nina; Bakken, Inger J; Magnus, Per; Håberg, Siri E",Int J Epidemiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7313985/,159

PRV has thus far been found only in Australia and Asia, where diverse old-world fruit bats (Pteropodidae) serve as hosts. In this study, we report the discovery of PRV in Africa, in an Angolan soft-furred fruit bat (Lissonycteris angolensis ruwenzorii) from Bundibugyo District, Uganda. Metagenomic characterization of a rectal swab yielded 10 dsRNA genome segments, revealing this virus to cluster within the known diversity of PRV variants detected in bats and humans in Southeast Asia. Phylogeographic analyses revealed a correlation between geographic distance and genetic divergence of PRVs globally, which suggests a geographic continuum of PRV diversity spanning Southeast Asia to sub-Saharan Africa. The discovery of PRV in an African bat dramatically expands the geographic range of this zoonotic virus and warrants further surveillance for PRVs outside of Southeast Asia.","Bennett, Andrew J.; Goldberg, Tony L.",Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7412351/,159
13145,"Seroincidence of Influenza Among HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected Men During the 2009 H1N1 Influenza Pandemic, Bangkok, Thailand",2014-10-10,"OBJECTIVE: This paper compares the accuracy of predicting suicide from Social Determinants of Health (SDoH) or history of illness. POPULATION STUDIED: 5 313 965 Veterans who at least had two primary care visits between 2008 and 2016. STUDY DESIGN: The dependent variable was suicide or intentional self‐injury. The independent variables were 10 495 International Classification of Disease (ICD) Version 9 codes, age, and gender. The ICD codes included 40 V‐codes used for measuring SDoH, such as family disruption, family history of substance abuse, lack of education, legal impediments, social isolation, unemployment, and homelessness. The sample was randomly divided into training (90 percent) and validation (10 percent) sets. Area under the receiver operating characteristic (AROC) was used to measure accuracy of predictions in the validation set. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Separate analyses were done for inpatient and outpatient codes; the results were similar. In the hospitalized group, the mean age was 67.2 years, and 92.1 percent were male. The mean number of medical diagnostic codes during the study period was 37; and 12.9 percent had at least one SDoH V‐code. At least one episode of suicide or intentional self‐injury occurred in 1.89 percent of cases. SDoH V‐codes, on average, elevated the risk of suicide or intentional self‐injury by 24‐fold (ranging from 4‐ to 86‐fold). An index of 40 SDoH codes predicted suicide or intentional self‐injury with an AROC of 0.64. An index of 10 445 medical diagnoses, without SDoH V‐codes, had AROC of 0.77. The combined SDoH and medical diagnoses codes also had AROC of 0.77. CONCLUSION: In predicting suicide or intentional self‐harm, SDoH V‐codes add negligible information beyond what is already available in medical diagnosis codes. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Policies that affect SDoH (eg, housing policies, resilience training) may not have an impact on suicide rates, if they do not change the underlying medical causes of SDoH.","Alemi, Farrokh; Avramovic, Sanja; Renshaw, Keith D.; Kanchi, Rania; Schwartz, Mark",Health Serv Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7518826/,159

BRB081 strain was grown in six different media settings over 1, 2, 3 or 7 days. Extractions of mycelium and broth were conducted separately for each media and cultivation period by sonication using methanol/acetone 1:1 and agitation with ethyl acetate, respectively. All methanol/acetone and ethyl acetate crude extracts were analysed by HPLC-MS/MS and data treatment was performed through GNPS platform using MZmine 2 software. In parallel, the genome was sequenced, assembled and mined to search for biosynthetic gene clusters (BGC) of secondary metabolites using the AntiSMASH 5.0 software. Spectral library search tool allowed the annotation of desferrioxamines, fatty acid amides, diketopiperazines, xanthurenic acid and, remarkably, the cyclic octapeptides surugamides. Molecular network analysis allowed the observation of the surugamides cluster, where surugamide A and the protonated molecule corresponding to the B-E isomers, as well as two potentially new analogues, were detected. Data treatment through MZmine 2 software allowed to distinguish that the largest amount of surugamides was obtained by cultivating BRB081 in SCB medium during 7 days and extraction of culture broth. Using the same data treatment, a chemical barcode was created for easy visualization and comparison of the metabolites produced overtime in all media. By genome mining of BRB081 four regions of biosynthetic gene clusters of secondary metabolites were detected supporting the metabolic data. Cytotoxic evaluation of all crude extracts using MTT assay revealed the highest bioactivity was also observed for extracts obtained in the optimal conditions as those for surugamides production, suggesting these to be the main active compounds herein. This method allowed the identification of compounds in the crude extracts and guided the selection of best conditions for production of bioactive compounds.","Tangerina, Marcelo M.

16331,Research in brief,2021-03-24,"We report on further development of the agroinfiltratable Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV)-based overexpression (TRBO) vector to deliver CRISPR/Cas9 components into plants. First, production of a Cas9 (HcoCas9) protein from a binary plasmid increased when co-expressed in presence of suppressors of gene silencing, such as the TMV 126-kDa replicase or the Tomato bushy stunt virus P19 protein. Such suppressor-generated elevated levels of Cas9 expression translated to efficient gene editing mediated by TRBO-G-3′gGFP expressing GFP and also a single guide RNA targeting the mgfp5 gene in the Nicotiana benthamiana GFP-expressing line 16c. Furthermore, HcoCas9 encoding RNA, a large cargo insert of 4.2 kb, was expressed from TRBO-HcoCas9 to yield Cas9 protein again at higher levels upon co-expression with P19. Likewise, co-delivery of TRBO-HcoCas9 and TRBO-G-3′gGFP in the presence of P19 also resulted in elevated levels percentages of indels (insertions and deletions). These data also revealed an age-related phenomenon in plants whereby the RNA suppressor P19 had more of an effect in older plants. Lastly, we used a single TRBO vector to express both Cas9 and a sgRNA. Taken together, we suggest that viral RNA suppressors could be used for further optimization of single viral vector delivery of CRISPR gene editing parts.","Chiong, Kelvin T.; Cody, Will B.; Scholthof, Herman B.",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7990971/,159

The Mediterranean diet, rich in fermentable fibres and anti-inflammatory phenolic compounds, is associated with reduced risk of developing PD and slower progression of parkinsonism. The Mediterranean diet is often recommended for people with PD; however, no studies to date examine this diet as a therapeutic intervention to modulate gastrointestinal (GI) dysfunction. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is a randomised, controlled, parallel study. During a 2-week run-in, participants with PD and constipation symptoms (n=52) will undergo baseline nutritional and neurological assessments and provide a stool sample. Participants will be stratified by sex and Hoehn and Yahr stage and randomised to follow standard of care for constipation (control) or standard of care plus a Mediterranean diet (intervention) for 8 weeks. A study dietitian will provide dietary instruction and weekly follow-up via telephone to both groups to support adherence and monitor adverse events. Questionnaires will assess dietary intake and GI function including stool frequency, form, symptoms and laxative usage. Measurements completed at baseline will be repeated at 4 and 8 weeks of the intervention. The primary outcome is to evaluate the difference between mean change (final–baseline) in Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS) constipation syndrome scores for the control versus intervention groups. Secondary outcomes will assess stool frequency and form, weekly GSRS syndrome scores, digestive quality of life, laxative usage, faecal microbial communities and inflammatory markers, anxiety, depression, quality life, body weight and composition, dietary fibre intake and Mediterranean diet adherence.

It focuses, in particular, on the recent rise to prominence of non-communicable diseases on the global health agenda. Once considered to be diseases of affluence, non-communicable diseases (NCDs) such as cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disease have recently come to be seen as a threat to both the global population and the global economy. Strategies to combat the proliferation of NCDs have simultaneous been shown to be particularly cost-effective, making NCD interventions a solid global health investment. This chapter contrasts the current era of global health, in which health is imagined in as a form of human capital and a site of investment with a post-war era of international health during which health was advocated as a human right and public good. Drawing on empirical material including historical documents, published reports and the scientific literature, it argues that the transition from international to global health can be best understood as resulting from the rise of economic rationalities in the field of world health over the last 25 years.","Kenny, Katherine E.",History of Economic Rationalities,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123985/,159

26965,P441 – P678,2015-12-28,"In both industrialized and developing countries, childhood immunization has become one of the most important and cost-effective public health interventions. National immunization programs have prevented millions of deaths since WHO initiated the ‘Expanded Program on Immunization’ in 1974. Smallpox was eradicated in 1979, poliomyelitis is on the verge of eradication, and two thirds of developing countries have eliminated neonatal tetanus. Global immunization coverage was at 78% in 2005. Through their impact on childhood morbidity and mortality, immunization programs are contributing to reaching the ‘Millennium Development Goal 4’ — a two-thirds reduction of under-five mortality by 2015. However, the failure to reach more than 20% of the world’s children with existing vaccines was responsible for at least 2.5 million of an estimated 10.5 million deaths of children under 5 years, mainly in developing countries. Of these deaths, 1.4 million could have been prevented by vaccines currently recommended by WHO. Rapid progress in our understanding of the pathogenesis of infectious diseases, immunology, and biotechnology has increased the number of candidate vaccine antigens available. Pressures are growing on public health decision makers to establish evidence-based ways to decide which new vaccines should be introduced on a large scale into national immunization programs. The gap in access to new vaccines between the developing and industrialized worlds is still wide, and wealthy countries are still the first to introduce and use new vaccines. Interest from countries and partner agencies in vaccination, as one of the most cost-effective public health interventions, continues to be strong, also due to rapid progress in biotechnology and vaccine development and the emergence of global infectious disease threats, including HIV/AIDS, SARS, and influenza. The establishment of the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization has focused global activities to support vaccination programs through raising considerable funds, and to assist especially poorer countries in improving and expanding their vaccination programs. Global efforts concentrate on further reducing the gap in the access to all existing vaccines between industrialized and developing countries.","Tangermann, Rudolf H.; Nohynek, Hanna; Eggers, Rudolf",Pediatric Infectious Diseases Revisited,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7124024/,159

As one of the permanent members of the United Nations (UN) Security Council, China, has been supportive of international norms advocated by the UN, and even though the term human security has not been frequently used, in effect it has been vigorously practiced. For both the government and the academic community in China, human security and national security are not necessarily in confrontation but rather can complement and strengthen one another. The purpose is to improve the quality of people’s everyday life and the government is expected to contribute to this end. Chinese people expect the government to extend a parental roof over the people.","Xiao, Ren",Human Security Norms in East Asia,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7124087/,159

30219,Infectious Disease,2009-05-15,"This chapter describes how the poor health of a laboratory animal can adversely the experimental models used in antimicrobial research. Concerns for the health of laboratory animals have mostly focused on spontaneous infections, although disease in laboratory animals may also be caused by genetic or environmental determinants. The presence of various pathogenic microorganisms may cause changes in the organs, resulting in difficulties in the interpretation of the pathological diagnosis included in the evaluation of many microbiological models. The immune system may be modulated by spontaneous infections in the absence of clinical disease. This effect may be either suppressive or activating or both at the same time, but on different parts of the immune system. Some microorganisms have a specific effect on enzymatic, haematological, and other parameters, which are monitored in the animal during an experiment. Organic function disturbances may change the outcome of the experiment without the knowledge of the scientist. Spontaneous infections in an experimental infection model may also compete with the experimental infection, which in the worst cases may fail. Microorganisms present in the animal may contaminate samples and tissue specimens, such as cells and sera. This may complicate the in vitro maintenance of cell lines, and may interfere with experiments performed on cell cultures or isolated organs. To avoid disease, microbial interference, and zoonoses, laboratory animals are produced according to a three-step principle, which include rederivation, barrier protection, and health monitoring. Rederivation means the production of animals to initiate breeding colonies by either caesarian section or embryo transfer.","Hansen, A.K.",Handbook of Animal Models of Infection,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7155508/,159

This stimulation has previously been shown to activate NK cells. Cell cytotoxicity was measured by flow cytometry after incubation with k562 cells. This method was compared to the current standard 51Cr release assay. Cells were treated with BFA to accumulate IFN‐γ, stained for surface markers, permeabilized and stained for intracellular IFN‐γ. Flow cytometry was then performed to measure intracellular IFN‐γ production in PBMC, especially in NK cells. Results: We have demonstrated that stimulation with IL‐2 and IL‐12 is effective in increasing the number of IFN‐γ‐positive cells. There is a distinct difference between the CD3‐CD56dim and the CD3‐CD56bright subsets, with a much greater proportion of IFN‐γ‐positive cells in the CD3‐CD56bright subset. The effects of stimulation with IL‐2 and IL‐12 on cytotoxicity will be presented, as will the relation between IFN‐γ production and cytotoxicity. In addition, we will present results of these assays applied to porcine cells. Discussion: In combination, these tests will address NK cell function by combining cytotoxicity with IFN‐γ production in NK cell subsets. The results will demonstrate whether this could serve as a useful tool in describing NK‐cell function, which could be of value in clinical and experimental settings.","Nyboe, R.; Rix, T.; Krog, J.; Tønnesen, E.; Hokland, M.",Scand J Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7169545/,159

40710,Real-Time Forecast of Influenza Outbreak Using Dynamic Network Marker Based on Minimum Spanning Tree,2020-10-01,"BACKGROUND: During events that involve health risks, people may feel the need personal and social resources to cope with the demands posed by event. Depending on their individual characteristics, people may perceive their resources as sufficient or as insufficient to face the situation. Risk perception analysis was conducted in Portugal during the COVID-19 outbreak, to develop communication strategies, customized to the changing needs, helping people make informed decisions. METHODS: Citizens messages on social networks of 3 official information sources, and 8 media sources were analyzed between 26th January and 5th March 2020. A sample of comments to publications related to COVID-19 were analyzed in 4-days periods and categorized. A qualitative theory-driven thematic analysis was carried out based on two global categories: Demands and Resources. From this analysis, the threat level ratio (Demands/Resources) was calculated. RESULTS: A total of 8,251 comments were analysed in 10 periods of 4 days of data collection, from 26th January to 5th March. The threat level ratio increased during the first 15 days of analysis, having its maximum (6.80) in the period between the 7th and 14th of February, mostly associated with the perceived danger associated with the lack of airports arrivals control from China. After the announcement of the first confirmed case of COVID-19 in a Portuguese citizen outside Portugal, on 23rd February, the risk perception increased 1,4% compared to the previous period of analysis. On the contrary, after announcing the first confirmed case in Portugal, on the 1st March, the risk perception decreased 1,6%, which is inferred to be associated with a shift in the media discourse and to the use of humour. CONCLUSIONS: Awareness of risks is a necessary condition for people to adhere to the necessary recommendations to mitigate the crisis. During an epidemic, an effective communication strategy can become an opportunity to promote health literacy. KEY MESSAGES: Risk perception is essential to define effective communication strategies to promote health literacy and best practices among targeted populations. effective communication strategies customized to people’s needs and priorities help people making informed decisions during a public health emergency.","Leiras, G; Arriaga, M; Gaspar, R; Raposo, B; Domingos, S",Eur J Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7543568/,159

In particular, cutting edge computer vision technology based on deep-learning approaches has been deployed with an extraordinary degree of success. The ability to extract semantic concepts from continuous processing of video stream in real-time has led to the investigation of such solutions to enhance the operational security of critical infrastructure against intruders. Despite the success of computer vision technologies validated in a laboratory environment, there still exists several challenges that limit the deployment of these solutions in operational environment. Addressing these challenges, the paper presents a framework that integrates three main computer vision technologies namely (i) person detection; (ii) person re-identification and (iii) face recognition to enhance the operational security of critical infrastructure perimeter. The novelty of the proposed framework relies on the integration of key technical innovations that satisfies the operational requirements of critical infrastructure in using computer vision technologies. One such requirement relates to data privacy and citizen rights, following the implementation of General Data Protection Regulation across Europe for the successful adoption of video surveillance for infrastructure security. The video analytics solution proposed in the paper integrates privacy preserving technologies, high-level rule engine for threat identification and a knowledge model for escalating threat categorises to human operator. The various components of the proposed framework has been validated using commercially available graphical processing units for detecting intruders. The performance o the proposed framework has been evaluated in operational environments of the critical infrastructure. An overall accuracy of 97% is observed in generating alerts against malicious intruders.","Chandramouli, Krishna; Izquierdo, Ebroul",Cyber-Physical Security for Critical Infrastructures Protection,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7972676/,159
51854,Infectious diseases in Yemen,2021-04-23,"According to the 2016 Mckinsey report, the global construction industry is one of the least productive (The Construction Productivity Imperative, McKinsey Report, 2016), which can be attributed to a minimal implementation of digital and automation technology (Berger Digtization in the Construction industry—Building Europe's road to ""Construction 4.0 THINK/ACT—BEYOND MAINSTREAM, 2015). This research argues that this relates to the skill base of construction workers since very few, if any, can operate digital fabrication systems. Here, a digital model is considered foundational knowledge and is used to communicate with a fabrication unit. The difficulty lies in communicating the digital model to the fabrication machine, which arguably requires a level of specialist knowledge. However, history shows that other methods of communicating complex construction information have existed, such as 1:1 on-site drawing, which used to be made by architects or construction workers to communicate complex information related to constructing jigs or building components (The Tracing Floor of York Minster.” In Studies in the History of Civil Engineering, 1:81–86. The Engineering of Medieval Cathedrals. Routledge, 1997). We propose an alternative where we learn from history and amalgamate that knowledge with a robotic framework. We present the calibration process behind a parametric visual feedback method for robotic fabrication that detects on-object hand-drawn markings and allows us to assign digital information to detected markings. The technique is demonstrated through a 1:2 prototype that is fabricated using an ABB IRB 120 robot arm.","Pedersen, Jens; Søndergaard, Asbjørn; Reinhardt, Dagmar",Constr Robot,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8054693/,159
54192,OP03 Anti-SARS-CoV2 antibody responses are attenuated in patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease treated with infliximab,2021-05-27,"OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this research is to assess and compare the self-reported hydration practices of long-distance trail runners during an intended long training run (LTR), an intended event, and during an actual event during COVID-19. The hypothesis is that hydration practices are inconsistent between these three scenarios and runners sometimes consume more than intended during an event. Consuming more fluids than intended may lead to exercise-associated hyponatremia (EAH). METHODS: Cross-sectional pre- and post-survey design. The setting was the Macedonia Trail Race was in Kent, CT and the Angevine Farm Trail Race was in Warren, CT. A total of 26 (of 310 registered) eligible runners from one of the events volunteered to be participants. The pre-race survey assessed intended hydration practices of training and a possible event. The post-race assessed the actual hydration practices of the race. Main outcome measures were hydration practices, including strategies and volumes during a LTR, and intended event, and the actual event. Awareness and knowledge of EAH, and the understanding of an effective hydration plan were assessed. RESULTS: There was a strong correlation (0.91) between intended volumes before the LTR and the intended event. When comparing volumes consumed during the event to the intended event, the correlation was moderate (0.52). Moderate agreement (64–85%) was found when comparing the hydration strategies in the intended and the actual events. The comparisons were statistically significant when measured by the Kappa statistic (P < 0.05). Runners reported drinking according to thirst an average of 30% across the three scenarios. This study found that 50% of runners reported knowledge and awareness of EAH, while 62% felt they had a solid understanding of an effective hydration plan. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, long-distance trail runners reported differences in hydration practices when comparing an intended LTR, an intended trail event, and an actual trail event. Drinking according to thirst is the recommended hydration strategy to prevent EAH, in lieu of a personalized hydration plan. This indicates a need for ongoing education on hydration practices and EAH. The primary limitations of this study are self-reported data and small sample size due to COVID-19.

To address the societal need for monitoring the spread of SARS-CoV-2, many existing diagnostic technologies were quickly adapted to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA and antigens as well as the immune response, and new testing strategies were developed to accelerate time-to-decision. In parallel, the infusion of research support accelerated the development of new spectroscopic methods. While these methods have significantly reduced the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on society when coupled with behavioral changes, they also lay the groundwork for a new generation of platform technologies. With several epidemics on the horizon, such as the rise of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, the ability to quickly pivot the target pathogen of this diagnostic toolset will continue to have an impact.","Scholtz, Alexis; Ramoji, Anuradha; Silge, Anja; Jansson, Jakob R.; de Moura, Ian G.; Popp, Jürgen; Sram, Jakub P.; Armani, Andrea M.",ACS Photonics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8482784/,159
60657,More Tools for the Toolbox: Interpreting Coughing Patients' Clues.,2021-01-01,"Virus-specific CD8(+) T cells are critical for protection against neurotropic coronaviruses; however, central nervous system (CNS) infection with the recombinant JHM (RJHM) strain of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) elicits a weak CD8(+) T-cell response in the brain and causes lethal encephalomyelitis. An adoptive transfer model was used to elucidate the kinetics of CD8(+) T-cell priming during CNS infection with RJHM as well as with two MHV strains that induce a robust CD8(+) T-cell response (RA59 and SJHM/RA59, a recombinant A59 virus expressing the JHM spike). While RA59 and SJHM/RA59 infections resulted in CD8(+) T-cell priming within the first 2 days postinfection, RJHM infection did not lead to proliferation of naïve CD8(+) T cells. While all three viruses replicated efficiently in the brain, only RA59 and SJHM/RA59 replicated to appreciable levels in the cervical lymph nodes (CLN), the site of T-cell priming during acute CNS infection. RJHM was unable to suppress the CD8(+) T-cell response elicited by RA59 in mice simultaneously infected with both strains, suggesting that RJHM does not cause generalized immunosuppression. RJHM was also unable to elicit a secondary CD8(+) T-cell response in the brain following peripheral immunization against a viral epitope. Notably, the weak CD8(+) T-cell response elicited by RJHM was unique to CNS infection, since peripheral inoculation induced a robust CD8(+) T-cell response in the spleen. These findings suggest that the failure of RJHM to prime a robust CD8(+) T-cell response during CNS infection is likely due to its failure to replicate in the CLN.","MacNamara, Katherine C; Bender, Susan J; Chua, Ming Ming; Watson, Richard; Weiss, Susan R",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00106-08; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18417581/,159
60979,Epidemiological surveillance of healthcare-associated infections in a pediatric hematopoietic stem cell transplantation unit in south Brazil.,2020-11-29,"BACKGROUND In the U.S., strong ethnic/racial, socioeconomic, demographic, and geographic breastfeeding (BF) inequities persist, and African American and Hispanic women are less likely to meet their breastfeeding goals compared to White women. This systematic review (SR) was designed to answer the question: What is the impact of breastfeeding interventions targeting ethnic/racial minority women in the U.S. on improving BF initiation, duration and exclusivity rates? METHODS The SR was conducted following the Institute of Medicine Guidelines and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses checklist. The study protocol was developed and registered a priori in PROSPERO (ID#CRD42020177764). The electronical databases searched was MEDLINE All (Ovid). Search strategies were led by the team's expert public health librarian using both controlled vocabulary and free text queries and were tested against a validated set of relevant papers included in existing reviews. The GRADE methodology was used to assess the quality of the studies. RESULTS We included 60 studies that had randomized (n = 25), observational (n = 24), quasi-experimental (n = 9), or cross-sectional (n = 2) designs. The studies focused on populations that were multi-ethnic/racial (n = 22), only Hispanic (n = 24), only Black (n = 13), and only American Indian (n = 1). The study interventions were classified following the socioecological model: macrosystem/policy level (n = 6); community level (n=51), which included healthcare organizations (n = 34), The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) (n = 9), and community organizations/public health institutions (n = 8); and interpersonal level (n = 3). CONCLUSIONS Policy and community level interventions delivered through WIC, healthcare facilities, and community agencies) are likely to improve BF outcomes among women of color. The combination of interventions at different levels of the socioecological model has not been studied among minority women in the U.S. Implementation science research is needed to learn how best to scale up and sustain effective BF interventions, taking into account the needs and wants of minority women. Thus, it is strongly recommended to conduct large scale implementation research studies addressesing how to strengthen the different health and social environments surrounding women of color in the U.S. to improving their BF outcomes.","Segura-Pérez, Sofia; Hromi-Fiedler, Amber; Adnew, Misikir; Nyhan, Kate; Pérez-Escamilla, Rafael",International journal for equity in health,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12939-021-01388-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33676506/,159

Methods Retrospective analysis of all uncomplicated postpartum women in seven obstetrical units within a large health system between December 8th, 2019 and June 20th, 2020. Women were stratified into two groups based on date of delivery in relation to the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in New York (Mid-March 2020); those delivering before or during the COVID-19 pandemic. We compared hospital length of stay, defined as time interval from delivery to discharge in hours, between the two groups and correlated it with the number of COVID-19 admissions to our hospitals. Statistical analysis included use of Wilcoxon rank sum test and Chi-squared test with significance defined as p-value<0.05. Results Of the 11,770 patients included, 5,893 (50.1%) delivered prior to and 5,877 (49.9%) delivered during the COVID-19 pandemic. We detected substantial shortening in postpartum hospital length of stay after vaginal delivery (34 vs. 48 h, p≤0.0001) and cesarean delivery (51 vs. 74 h, p≤0.0001) during the COVID-19 pandemic. Conclusions We report successful implementation of early postpartum discharge for low-risk patients resulting in a significantly shorter hospital stay during the COVID-19 pandemic in New York. The impact of this strategy on resource utilization, patient satisfaction and adverse outcomes requires further study.","Bornstein, Eran; Gulersen, Moti; Husk, Gregg; Grunebaum, Amos; Blitz, Matthew J; Rafael, Timothy J; Rochelson, Burton L; Schwartz, Benjamin; Nimaroff, Michael; Chervenak, Frank A",Journal of perinatal medicine,https://doi.org/10.1515/jpm-2020-0337; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32845868/,159
61407,"Incidence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus nosocomial infections in intensive care units in Lyon University hospitals, France, 2003-2006.",2008,"CONTEXT Laparoscopic surgery in urology is considered to be an important advance, although it is not exempt from some morbidity associated to the use of multiple trocars and specifically to the extraction of the specimen. In order to decrease this morbidity and improve esthetics, other techniques are being developed, such as natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) and laparoendoscopic single-site surgery (LESS). It is aimed to review the current status of laparoendoscopic single site surgery in urology. ACQUISITION OF EVIDENCE A nonsystematic review has been carried out by means of the bibliographic search using the terms LESS and Urology from 2007 to 2012. The current LESS experience in urology is described, and its principal indications and the different single site devices and instruments available on the market are described. SYNTHESIS OF EVIDENCE LESS surgery arose as one more step in the constant evolution of minimally invasive surgery in an attempt to improve esthetics, reduce surgical trauma and decrease pain and the post-operative complications associated to the conventional laparoscopy with multiple trocars. Since it was first described in 2007, the experience has been increasing exponentially and the LESS technique, whether assisted or not by robot, is becoming consolidated for a large spectrum of urological indications (both in oncological and reconstructive surgery) on a much greater scale than the NOTES technique. Even though most of the existing data are not randomized and very rarely comparative, with the selection bias that this represents, it seems clear that the esthetic benefit and analgesic control associated to the LESS surgery is real and reproducible. The complications associated to it are greater in cases of major oncology surgery and are due more to the technique itself then to the approach. CONCLUSIONS Although the real benefit of the LESS surgery in urology cannot be appropriately quantified, the cosmetic improvement, less pain and greater patient satisfaction with their wound are clear. Appropriate training in this type of procedures in centers having large volumes and the continuous technical improvements in the instrumental development by the biomedical industry has resulted in the fact that the transumbilical LESS technique in urology has been born to stay.","García-Mediero, J M; Cabrera, P M; Cáceres, F; Mateo, E; García-Tello, A; Angulo, J C",Actas urologicas espanolas,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.acuro.2012.07.001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22999345/,159

Also, we aim to evaluate breastfeeding rates predischarge and postdischarge. METHODS Nasopharyngeal swabs for SARS-CoV-2 were obtained from symptomatic and high-risk women in the delivery room. Mothers with positive SARS-CoV-2 test results were separated from the newborns. Newborns were screened within 48 hours of delivery, and anti-infectious guidelines were imparted to the mothers before discharge. Rescreening took place ≥14 days postdischarge. Data regarding SARS-CoV-2-positive household members and breastfeeding were obtained by follow-up phone calls. RESULTS A total of 73 newborns of SARS-CoV-2-positive mothers were born in Israel during the ∼3-month period under study. Overall, 55 participated in this study. All neonates tested negative for the virus postdelivery. A total 74.5% of the neonates were fed unpasteurized expressed breast milk during the postpartum separation until discharge. Eighty-nine percent of the neonates were discharged from the hospital after their mothers were instructed in anti-infection measures. In 40% of the households, there were additional SARS-CoV-2-positive residents. A total of 85% of the newborns were breastfed postdischarge. Results for all 60% of the newborns retested for SARS-CoV-2 postdischarge were negative. CONCLUSIONS No viral infection was identified in neonates born to and separated from their SARS-CoV-2-positive mothers at birth and subsequently fed unpasteurized breast milk. All infants breastfed at home remained SARS-CoV-2 negative. These findings may provide insights regarding the redundancy of postpartum mother-newborn separation in SARS-CoV-2-positive women and, assuming precautions are adhered to, support the safety of breast milk.","Shlomai, Noa Ofek; Kasirer, Yair; Strauss, Tzipora; Smolkin, Tatiana; Marom, Ronella; Shinwell, Eric S; Simmonds, Arye; Golan, Agneta; Morag, Iris; Waisman, Dan; Felszer-Fisch, Clari; Wolf, Dana G; Eventov-Friedman, Smadar",Pediatrics,https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2020-010918; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33850028/,159

This study aims to assess correlations of the time from symptom onset to diagnosis and treatment with the time to disease resolution and CT scores as based on findings from sequential chest CT examinations. MATERIALS AND METHODS. Thirty patients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) confirmed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis underwent chest CT examinations. Five patients who did not have positive CT findings or who had not yet fulfilled criteria for discharge from the hospital were excluded. CT scores were determined according to CT findings and lung involvement. The time from symptom onset to diagnosis and treatment was recorded for each patient, and on the basis of this information, patients with COVID-19 were divided into group 1 (patients for whom this interval was ≤ 3 days) and group 2 (those for whom this interval was > 3 days). The CT scores for each group were fitted using a Lorentzian line-shape curve to show the variation tendency during treatment. The differences in age, sex, and last CT scores determined before discharge between the two groups were analyzed, and correlations of the time from symptom onset to diagnosis and treatment with the time to disease resolution as well as with the highest CT score also underwent statistical analysis. RESULTS. A total of 25 subjects were enrolled in the study. The fitted tendency curves for group 1 and group 2 were significantly different, with peak points showing that the estimated highest CT score was 10 and 16 for each group, respectively, and the time to disease resolution was 6 and 13 days, respectively. The Mann-Whitney test showed that the last CT scores were lower for group 1 than for group 2 (p = 0.025), although the chi-square test found no difference in age and sex between the groups. The time from symptom onset to diagnosis and treatment had a positive correlation with the time to disease resolution (r = 0.93; p = 0.000) as well as with the highest CT score (r = 0.83; p = 0.006). CONCLUSION. Timely diagnosis and treatment are key to providing a better prognosis for patients with COVID-19.","Huang, Guoquan; Gong, Tao; Wang, Guangbin; Wang, Jianwen; Guo, Xinfu; Cai, Erpeng; Li, Shirong; Li, Xiaohu; Yu, Yongqiang; Lin, Liangjie",AJR.

74874,Communicating bad news in the context of COVID-19.,2020,"OBJECTIVE Transsphenoidal surgery has been the gold standard for intra- and suprasellar lesions as well as some extrasellar pathologies for more than 40 years. This approach, with proper surgical expertise, is very safe with a low morbidity and mortality rate. However, as with every surgical treatment, complications can occur and may result in serious consequences for the patient. The goal of this article is to focus on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) fistulas after transsphenoidal surgery and discuss possible risk factors and treatment options, including less common procedures in persistent CSF fistulas. METHODS Over a period of 24 months, 339 consecutive patients underwent a total of 363 transsphenoidal surgeries for different pathologies in our institution. There were 282 patients with pituitary adenomas and 57 patients with nonadenomateous lesions. RESULTS CSF fistulas occurred in total of six patients (1.77%), most frequently after surgery for nonadenomateous lesions (7%). The rate was only 0.7% after surgery for pituitary adenomas. In three patients, a simple resurgery with repacking of the sella using muscle, fat, and fibrin glue was performed. All three patients received a lumbar drainage for 5 days as well. All three patients had recurrent CSF fistulas despite surgical repair, requiring multiple resurgeries. In two patients, the implantation of a ventriculoperitoneal (vp) shunt with programmable valve for continuous lowering of the CSF pressure was required. In both patients, the vp shunt was explanted 2 to 3 months after the last proven rhinorrhea. Out of the 339, 2 patients developed meningitis due to CSF fistulas (0.59%). CONCLUSIONS CSF fistulas continue to present a problem after transsphenoidal surgery and require sophisticated technical measures to treat this complication. Failure after repair can occur and necessitates more intense treatment modalities. The usage of the transsphenoidal approach in other skull base lesions leads to higher rates of CSF fistulas and subsequently higher frequency of meningitis.","Malik, Muhammad Usman; Aberle, Jens C; Flitsch, Joerg","Journal of neurological surgery.

75540,Design and evaluation of Taqman low density array (TLDA) for monitoring post-transplant viral infections.,2020-10-29,"HIV Associated Nephropathy (HIVAN) remains a concern among untreated HIV patients, notably of African descent, as patients can reach end-stage renal disease within three years. Two variants (G1 and G2) of the APOL1 gene, common in African populations to protect against African sleeping sickness, have been associated with an increased risk of several glomerular disorders including HIVAN, hypertension-attributed chronic kidney disease, idiopathic focal segmental glomerulosclerosis and are accordingly named renal risk variants (RRVs). This review examines the mechanisms by which APOL1 RRVs drive glomerular injury in the setting of HIV infection and their potential application to patient management. Innate antiviral mechanisms activated by chronic HIV infection, especially those involving type 1 interferons, are of particular interest as they have been shown to upregulate APOL1 expression. Additionally, the downregulation of miRNA 193a (a repressor of APOL1) is also associated with the up-regulation of APOL1. Interestingly, glomerular damage affected by APOL1 RRVs is caused by both loss and gain of function changes in the protein, explicitly characterizing these effects. Their intracellular localization offers a further understanding of the nuances of APOL1 variants effects in promoting renal disease. Finally, although APOL1 variants have been recognized as a critical genetic player in mediating kidney disease, there are significant gaps in their application to patient management for screening, diagnosis, and treatment.","Goyal, Rohan; Singhal, Pravin C",The FEBS journal,https://doi.org/10.1111/febs.15677; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33340240/,159

METHODS The authors performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies comparing continuous noninvasive arterial pressure monitoring with invasive arterial pressure monitoring. Random-effects pooled bias and SD of bias for systolic arterial pressure, diastolic arterial pressure, and mean arterial pressure were calculated. Continuous noninvasive arterial pressure monitoring was considered acceptable if pooled estimates of bias and SD were not greater than 5 and 8 mmHg, respectively, as recommended by the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation. RESULTS Twenty-eight studies (919 patients) were included. The overall random-effect pooled bias and SD were -1.6 ± 12.2 mmHg (95% limits of agreement -25.5 to 22.2 mmHg) for systolic arterial pressure, 5.3 ± 8.3 mmHg (-11.0 to 21.6 mmHg) for diastolic arterial pressure, and 3.2 ± 8.4 mmHg (-13.4 to 19.7 mmHg) for mean arterial pressure. In 14 studies focusing on currently commercially available devices, bias and SD were -1.8 ± 12.4 mmHg (-26.2 to 22.5 mmHg) for systolic arterial pressure, 6.0 ± 8.6 mmHg (-10.9 to 22.9 mmHg) for diastolic arterial pressure, and 3.9 ± 8.7 mmHg (-13.1 to 21.0 mmHg) for mean arterial pressure. CONCLUSIONS The results from this meta-analysis found that inaccuracy and imprecision of continuous noninvasive arterial pressure monitoring devices are larger than what was defined as acceptable. This may have implications for clinical situations where continuous noninvasive arterial pressure is being used for patient care decisions.","Kim, Sang-Hyun; Lilot, Marc; Sidhu, Kulraj S; Rinehart, Joseph; Yu, Zhaoxia; Canales, Cecilia; Cannesson, Maxime",Anesthesiology,https://doi.org/10.1097/aln.0000000000000226; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24637618/,159

This paper investigates which cognitive, moral, and emotional traits separate people who comply with official recommendations from those who don't. In four studies (three pre-registered) on both U.S. and French samples, we found that individuals' self-reported compliance with official recommendations during the COVID-19 pandemic was partly driven by individual differences in moral values, disgust sensitivity, and psychological reactance.

90462,Recent advances in the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2-angiotensin(1-7)-Mas axis.,2008,"BACKGROUND Diaphragmatic muscle contractions triggered by ventilator insuffl ations constitute a form of patient-ventilator interaction referred to as “entrainment,” which is usually unrecognized in critically ill patients. Our objective was to review tracings, which also included muscular activity, obtained in sedated patients who were mechanically ventilated to describe the entrainment events and their characteristics. The term “reverse triggering” was adopted to describe the ventilator-triggered muscular efforts. METHODS Over a 3-month period, recordings containing fl ow, airway pressure, and esophageal pressure or electrical activity of the diaphragm were reviewed. Recordings were obtained from a series of consecutive heavily sedated patients ventilated with an assist-control mode of ventilation for ARDS. The duration of entrainment, the entrainment ratio, and the phase difference elapsing between the commencement of the ventilator and neural breaths were evaluated. RESULTS The tracings of eight consecutive patients with ARDS were reviewed; they all showed different forms of entrainment. Reverse triggering occurred over a portion varying from 12% to 100% of the total recording period. Seven patients had a 1:1 mechanical insuffl ation to diaphragmatic contractions ratio; this coexisted with a 1:2 ratio in one patient and 1:2 and 1:3 ratios in another. One patient exhibited only a 1:2 ratio. The frequency of reverse-triggered breaths had a mean coeffi cient of variability of , 5%, very close to the variability of mechanical breaths. CONCLUSIONS To our knowledge, this is the fi rst time that the presence of respiratory entrainment in sedated, critically ill adult patients who are mechanically ventilated has been documented. The “reverse-triggered” breaths illustrate a new form of neuromechanical coupling with potentially important clinical consequences.","Akoumianaki, Evangelia; Lyazidi, Aissam; Rey, Nathalie; Matamis, Dimitrios; Perez-Martinez, Nelly; Giraud, Raphael; Mancebo, Jordi; Brochard, Laurent; Richard, Jean-Christophe Marie",Chest,https://doi.org/10.1378/chest.12-1817; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23187649/,159

Therefore, detection of IL-6 at low concentrations permits early diagnosis of worst-case outcome in viral respiratory infections. Here, a versatile biointerface is presented that eliminates nonspecific adhesion and thus enables immunofluorescence detection of IL-6 in whole human plasma or whole human blood during coagulation, down to a limit of detection of 0.5 pg mL-1 . The sensitivity of the developed lubricant-infused biosensor for immunofluorescence assays in detecting low molecular weight proteins such as IL-6 is facilitated by i) producing a bioink in which the capture antibody is functionalized by an epoxy-based silane for covalent linkage to the fluorosilanized surface and ii) suppressing nonspecific adhesion by patterning the developed bioink into a lubricant-infused coating. The developed biosensor addresses one of the major challenges for biosensing in complex fluids, namely nonspecific adhesion, therefore paving the way for highly sensitive biosensing in complex fluids.","Shakeri, Amid; Jarad, Noor Abu; Terryberry, Jeff; Khan, Shadman; Leung, Ashlyn; Chen, Simeng; Didar, Tohid F",Small,https://doi.org/10.1002/smll.202003844; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33078567/,159

In search for novel treatment strategies against COVID-19, exosomes have attracted the attention of scientists and pharmaceutical companies worldwide. Exosomes are small extracellular vesicles, secreted by all types of cells, and considered as key mediators of intercellular communication and stem-cell paracrine signaling. Herein, we reviewed the most recent literature about the role of exosomes as potential agents for treatment, prevention, diagnosis, and pathogenesis of COVID-19. Several studies and ongoing clinical trials have been investigating the anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, and reparative effects of exosomes derived from mesenchymal stem/stromal cells for COVID-19-related acute lung injury. Other studies reported that exosomes play a key role in convalescent plasma therapy for COVID-19, and that they could be of use for the treatment of COVID-19 Kawasaki's-like multisystem inflammatory syndrome and as drug delivery nanocarriers for antiviral therapy. Harnessing some advantageous aspects of exosome biology, such as their endogenous origin, capability of crossing biological barriers, high stability in circulation, and low toxicity and immunogenicity, several companies have been testing exosome-based vaccines against SARS-CoV-2. As they carry cargos that mimic the status of parent cells, exosomes can be isolated from a variety of sources, including plasma, and employed as biomarkers of COVID-19. Lastly, there is growing evidence supporting the role of exosomes in COVID-19 infection, spread, reactivation, and reinfection. The lessons learned using exosomes for COVID-19 will help determine their efficacy and applicability in other clinical conditions.","Zani-Ruttenstock, Elke; Antounians, Lina; Khalaj, Kasra; Figueira, Rebeca L; Zani, Augusto",European journal of pediatric surgery : official journal of Austrian Association of Pediatric Surgery ...

To investigate this potential, we redirected the coronavirus murine hepatitis virus (MHV), which is normally unable to infect human cells, to human tumor cells by using a soluble receptor (soR)-based expression construct fused to an epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor targeting moiety. Addition of this adapter protein to MHV allowed infection of otherwise nonsusceptible, EGF receptor (EGFR)-expressing cell cultures. We introduced the sequence encoding the adaptor protein soR-EGF into the MHV genome to generate a self-targeted virus capable of multiround infection. The resulting recombinant MHV was viable and had indeed acquired the ability to infect all glioblastoma cell lines tested in vitro. Infection of malignant human glioblastoma U87DeltaEGFR cells gave rise to release of progeny virus and efficient cell killing in vitro. To investigate the oncolytic capacity of the virus in vivo, we used an orthotopic U87DeltaEGFR xenograft mouse model. Treatment of mice bearing a lethal intracranial U87DeltaEGFR tumor by injection with MHVsoR-EGF significantly prolonged survival compared to phosphate-buffered saline-treated (P = 0.001) and control virus-treated (P = 0.004) animals, and no recurrent tumor load was observed. However, some adverse effects were seen in normal mouse brain tissues that were likely caused by the natural murine tropism of MHV. This is the first demonstration of oncolytic activity of a coronavirus in vivo. It suggests that nonhuman coronaviruses may be attractive new therapeutic agents against human tumors.","Verheije, Monique H; Lamfers, Martine L M; Würdinger, Thomas; Grinwis, Guy C M; Gerritsen, Winald R; van Beusechem, Victor W; Rottier, Peter J M",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00495-09; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19439466/,159

METHOD The Consensus Conference was entirely held online due to anti-Covid-19 restrictions and after an introductory four lectures held by national and international experts in the field, a total of nine questions were presented and a digital ""real-time"" voting system was obtained. A consensus was reached if 75% or more of all panelists agreed on a given question. RESULTS A total of 202 physicians, from 76 different Italian Breast Centers homogeneously distributed throughout the Italian country, participated to the Conference. Most participants were surgeons (75%). Consensus was reached for seven out of the nine considered topics, including management of margins and lymph nodes at surgery, and there was good correspondence between the 32 ""Expert Panelists"" and the ""Participants"" to the Conference. Consensus was not achieved regarding the indications to NACT for high-grade luminal-like breast tumors, and the need to perform an axillary lymph node dissection in case of micrometastases in the sentinel lymph node after NACT. CONCLUSIONS NACT is a topic of major interest among surgeons, and there is need to develop shared guidelines. While a Consensus was obtained for most issues presented at this Conference, controversies still exist regarding indications to NACT in luminal B-like tumors and management of lymph node micrometastases.

100045,Mental Symptoms in Different Health Professionals During the SARS Attack: A Follow-up Study.,2009,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS We present an open retromuscular mesh technique for incisional hernia repair, the modified peritoneal flap hernioplasty, where the fascia is sutured to the mesh and the hernia sac utilized for anterior mesh coverage. The aim was to describe the modified peritoneal flap hernioplasty technique and to compare it to a retromuscular repair, without component separation, regarding short-term complications, patient satisfaction, abdominal wall complaints, and recurrent incisional hernia. MATERIALS AND METHODS Consecutive patients operated electively with modified peritoneal flap hernioplasty technique (December 2012-December 2015) or retromuscular technique (Jan 2011-Oct 2014) were included in a retrospective single-center cohort study. Outcomes were evaluated from the Swedish Ventral Hernia Registry, by chart review, physical examination, and an abdominal wall complaints questionnaire. RESULTS The modified peritoneal flap hernioplasty group (n = 78) had larger hernias (mean width 10.4 vs 8.5 cm, p = 0.005), more advanced Centers for Disease Control classification (p = 0.009), and more simultaneous gastrointestinal-tract surgery (23.1% vs 11.5%, p = 0.041) than the retromuscular group (n = 96). No difference in short-term complications was seen. Incisional hernia recurrence was lower in the modified peritoneal flap hernioplasty group (1.4% vs 10.3%, p = 0.023), and patients were more satisfied (93.8% vs 81.7%, p = 0.032). Follow-up time was shorter in the modified peritoneal flap hernioplasty group (614 vs 1171 days, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION This retrospective study showed similar rates of short-term complications, despite more complex hernias in the modified peritoneal flap hernioplasty group. Furthermore, a lower incisional hernia recurrence rate for the modified peritoneal flap hernioplasty technique compared with the retromuscular technique used in our department was found. If this holds true with equally long follow-up remains to be proven.","Petersson, P; Montgomery, A; Petersson, U",Scandinavian journal of surgery : SJS : official organ for the Finnish Surgical Society and the Scandinavian Surgical Society,https://doi.org/10.1177/1457496919863943; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31328662/,159
100935,Iatrogenic oesophageal transection during laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy.,2014,"BACKGROUND The health-care burden related to ventral hernia management is substantial, with more than 3 billion dollars in expenditures annually in the US. Previous studies have suggested that the utilization of laparoscopic repair remains relatively low although national volume estimates have not been reported. We sought to estimate the inpatient national volume of elective ventral hernia surgery and characterize the proportion of laparoscopic versus open operations. METHODS We analyzed data from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample to identify adults with a diagnosis of an umbilical, incisional, or ventral hernia who underwent an elective inpatient repair between 2009 and 2010. Cases that involved other major abdominal or pelvic operations were excluded. Covariates included patient demographics, surgical approach, and use of mesh. National surgical volume estimates were generated and length of stay and total hospital charges were compared for laparoscopic versus open repairs. RESULTS A total of 112,070 ventral hernia repairs were included in the analysis: 72.1 % (n = 80,793) were incisional hernia repairs, while umbilical hernia repairs comprised only 6.9 % (n = 7,788). Laparoscopy was utilized in 26.6 % (n = 29,870) of cases. Mesh was placed in 85.8 % (n = 96,265) of cases, including 49.3 % (n = 3,841) of umbilical hernia repairs and 90.1 % (n = 72,973) of incisional hernia repairs. Length of stay and total hospital charges were significantly lower for laparoscopic umbilical, incisional, and ""other"" ventral hernia repairs (p values all <0.001). Total hospital charges during this 2-year period approached 4 billion dollars ($746 million for laparoscopic repair; $3 billion for open repair). CONCLUSIONS Utilization of laparoscopy for elective abdominal wall hernia repair remains relatively low in the US despite its excellent outcomes. Given the substantial financial burden associated with these hernias, future research focused on preventing the development and optimizing the surgical treatment of ventral abdominal wall hernias is warranted.","Funk, Luke M; Perry, Kyle A; Narula, Vimal K; Mikami, Dean J; Melvin, W Scott",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-013-3075-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23860608/,159

In March 2020, Project ECHO created 10 coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) telementoring programs to meet the public health needs of clinicians and teachers living in underserved rural and urban regions of New Mexico. The newly created COVID-19 programs include 7 weekly sessions (Community Health Worker [in English and Spanish], Critical Care, Education, First-Responder Resiliency, Infectious Disease Office Hours, and Multi-specialty) and 3 one-day special sessions. We calculated the total number of attendees, along with the range and standard deviation, per session by program. Certain programs (Critical Care, Infectious Disease Office Hours, Multi-specialty) recorded the profession of attendees when available. The Project ECHO research team collected COVID-19 infection data by county from March 11 through May 31, 2020. During that same period, 9765 health care and general education professionals participated in the COVID-19 programs, and participants from 31 of 35 (89%) counties in New Mexico attended the sessions. Our initial evaluation of these programs demonstrates that an interprofessional clinician group and teachers used the Project ECHO network to build a community of practice and social network while meeting their educational and professional needs. Because of Project ECHO's large reach, the results of the New Mexico COVID-19 response suggest that the rapid use of ECHO telementoring could be used for other urgent national public health problems.","Katzman, Joanna G; Tomedi, Laura E; Thornton, Karla; Menking, Paige; Stanton, Michael; Sosa, Nestor; Harkins, Michelle; Katzman, Neil; Liu, Jinyang; Archer, Gaelyn R D; Arora, Sanjeev",Public health reports,https://doi.org/10.1177/0033354920969180; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33216679/,159

105669,"Farewell, Francisco.",2021-07-28,"Although it is understood that equine endocrinopathic laminitis can be triggered by high concentrations of insulin, it is unclear whether this represents a direct action on lamellar tissue via insulin receptors (InsR), an interaction with IGF-1 receptors (IGF-1R), or some other, indirect action. This uncertainty is because of the reported scarcity of InsR in lamellar tissue and the low affinity of insulin for equine IGF-1R. In the present study, the effects of insulin and IGF-1 (as a positive control) were examined using lamellar explants isolated from the hooves of healthy horses and incubated in cell culture medium for between 2 min and 48 h. In this system, a low physiological concentration of IGF-1 (10 nM; 1.31 ng/mL) caused a marked increase in the appearance of phosphorylated IGF-1R after 5 min (P < 0.05), and this effect was blocked by a human anti-IGF-1R monoclonal antibody (mAb). However, a high concentration of insulin (10 nM; 1,430 μIU/mL) appeared to cause dephosphorylation of the IGF-1R after 5 min (P < 0.01), 15 min, and 30 min (P < 0.001). Using 3H-thymidine as a marker, it was also demonstrated that insulin and IGF-1-stimulated cell proliferation in lamellar explants over the same concentration range as each other (1-100 nM), implying that each peptide acts via its own receptor (P < 0.001). Conversely, the effect of both peptides could be blocked using a selective anti-IGF-1R mAb (P < 0.001), implying that insulin acts via IGF1-R (either directly or indirectly). Notwithstanding this conundrum, the results demonstrate that insulin acts directly on lamellar tissue and suggest that a therapeutic anti-IGF-1R mAb could be useful in treating or preventing endocrinopathic laminitis.","Rahnama, S; Spence, R; Vathsangam, N; Baskerville, C L; Bailey, S R; de Laat, M A; Anderson, S T; Pollitt, C C; Sillence, M N",Domestic animal endocrinology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.domaniend.2020.106530; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32818904/,159

Often the decision maker combines data, likely uncertain or incomplete, with non-formalized knowledge within a multi-objective problem space, weighing the recommendations of analysts within broader contexts and goals. As most past research in visual analytics has focused on understanding the needs and challenges of data analysts, less is known about the tasks and challenges of organizational decision makers, and how visualization support tools might help. Here we characterize the decision maker as a domain expert, review relevant literature in management theories, and report the results of an empirical survey and interviews with people who make organizational decisions.

We examined the role of MAPK signaling in microglia using a preclinical model of AD pathology and quantitative proteomics studies of postmortem human brains. In multiplex immunoassay analyses of MAPK phosphoproteins in acutely isolated microglia and brain tissue from 5xFAD mice, we found phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) was the most strongly upregulated phosphoprotein within the MAPK pathway in acutely isolated microglia, but not whole-brain tissue from 5xFAD mice. The importance of ERK signaling in primary microglia cultures was next investigated using transcriptomic profiling and functional assays of amyloid-β and neuronal phagocytosis, which confirmed that ERK is a critical regulator of IFNγ-mediated pro-inflammatory activation of microglia, although it was also partly important for constitutive microglial functions. Phospho-ERK was an upstream regulator of disease-associated microglial gene expression (Trem2, Tyrobp), as well as several human AD risk genes (Bin1, Cd33, Trem2, Cnn2), indicative of the importance of microglial ERK signaling in AD pathology. Quantitative proteomic analyses of postmortem human brain showed that ERK1 and ERK2 were the only MAPK proteins with increased protein expression and positive associations with neuropathological grade. In a human brain phosphoproteomic study, we found evidence for increased flux through the ERK signaling pathway in AD. Overall, our analyses strongly suggest that ERK phosphorylation, particularly in microglia in mouse models, is a regulator of pro-inflammatory immune responses in AD pathogenesis.","Chen, Michael J; Ramesha, Supriya; Weinstock, Laura D; Gao, Tianwen; Ping, Lingyan; Xiao, Hailian; Dammer, Eric B; Duong, Duc D; Levey, Allan I; Lah, James J; Seyfried, Nicholas T; Wood, Levi B; Rangaraju, Srikant",Journal of neuroscience research,https://doi.org/10.1002/jnr.24829; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33729626/,159

The goal of this practice management guideline was to evaluate the role of the viscoelasticity tests: thromboelastography (TEG) and rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM), in the management of acutely bleeding trauma, surgical and critically ill patients. METHODS Systematic review and meta-analyses of manuscripts comparing TEG/ROTEM to non-TEG/ROTEM-guided blood products transfusions strategies were performed. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology was applied to assess the level of evidence and create recommendations for TEG/ROTEM-guided blood product transfusions in adult trauma, surgical, and critically ill patients. RESULTS Utilizing TEG/ROTEM-guided blood transfusions in acutely bleeding trauma, surgical, and critically ill patients was associated with a tendency to fewer blood product transfusions in all populations. TEG/ROTEM-guided transfusions were associated with a reduced number of additional invasive hemostatic interventions (angioembolic, endoscopic, or surgical) in surgical patients. TEG/ROTEM -guided transfusions were associated with a reduction in mortality in trauma patients. CONCLUSION In patients with ongoing hemorrhage and concern for coagulopathy, we conditionally recommend using TEG/ROTEM-guided transfusions, compared with traditional coagulation parameters, to guide blood component transfusions in each of the following three groups: adult trauma patients, adult surgical patients, and patients with critical illness.

A case series study.,2020-05-08,"Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) is characterized by a heterogeneous group of extranodal non-Hodgkin lymphomas, in which monoclonal T lymphocytes infiltrate the skin. LW-213, a derivative of wogonin, was found to induce cell apoptosis in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). In this study, we investigated the effects of LW-213 on CTCL cells and the underlying mechanisms. We showed that LW-213 (1-25 μM) dose-dependently inhibited human CTCL cell lines (Hut-102, Hut-78, MyLa, and HH) with IC50 values of around 10 μM, meanwhile it potently inhibited primary leukemia cells derived from peripheral blood of T-cell lymphoma patients. We revealed that LW-213-induced apoptosis was accompanied by ROS formation and the release of calcium from endoplasmic reticulum (ER) through IP3R-1channel. LW-213 selectively activated CHOP and induced apoptosis in Hut-102 cells via activating PERK-eIF2α-ATF4 pathway. Interestingly, the degree of apoptosis and expression of ER stress-related proteins were alleviated in the presence of either N-acetyl cysteine (NAC), an ROS scavenger, or 2-aminoethyl diphenylborinate (2-APB), an IP3R-1 inhibitor, implicating ROS/calcium-dependent ER stress in LW-213-induced apoptosis. In NOD/SCID mice bearing Hut-102 cell line xenografts, administration of LW-213 (10 mg/kg, ip, every other day for 4 weeks) markedly inhibited the growth of Hut-102 derived xenografts and prolonged survival. In conclusion, our study provides a new insight into the mechanism of LW-213-induced apoptosis, suggesting the potential of LW-213 as a promising agent against CTCL.","Yu, Xiao-Xuan; Zhu, Meng-Yuan; Wang, Jia-Rong; Li, Hui; Hu, Po; Qing, Ying-Jie; Wang, Xiang-Yuan; Wang, Hong-Zheng; Wang, Zhan-Yu; Xu, Jing-Yan; Guo, Qing-Long; Hui, Hui",Acta pharmacologica Sinica,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41401-020-0466-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32747719/,159

Generally, however, there has been no emphasis on the dynamism of the air-water interface despite the fact that that is one of its most unique characteristics, especially when compared with other solid surfaces. In this review, we introduce several of the advances in molecular recognition from the viewpoint of their dynamic properties. Finally, molecular recognition through dynamic cavity formation at the air-water interface is highlighted as being the most advanced example.

The objective of this study was to differentiate adenomatous polyps (APs) from hyperplastic polyps (HPs) with CCE. Methods In this single-center retrospective study, an analysis was conducted on the same CPs with both CCE and colonoscopy (CS) and histopathologically diagnosed as AP or HP. The color difference (ΔE) between the polyp surface and the surrounding mucosa was calculated using the CIELAB color space method on white light (WL), flexible spectral imaging color enhancement (FICE), and blue mode (BM) CP images. We investigated the ability of the ratio of the color differences (ΔE') to differentiate between APs and HPs. Results The size of all 51 polyps (34 APs, 17 HPs) was 7.5±4.6 mm with CCE and 7.3±4.2 mm with CS, and this difference was not significant (p=0.28). The FICEΔE' of APs was 3.3±1.8, which was significantly higher than the FICEΔE' of HPs (1.3±0.6; p<0.001). A receiver operating characteristic analysis showed that FICEΔE' was useful for differentiating between APs and HPs, with an area under the curve of 0.928 (95% confidence interval, 0.843-1). The sensitivity was 91.2%, and the specificity was 88.2% with a cut-off value of 1.758. Conclusion Using FICE on CCE images of CPs and applying the CIELAB color space method, we were able to differentiate between APs and HPs with high accuracy. This method has the potential to reduce unnecessary CS procedures.","Nakazawa, Kei; Nouda, Sadaharu; Kakimoto, Kazuki; Kinoshita, Naohiko; Tanaka, Yasuyoshi; Tawa, Hideki; Koshiba, Ryoji; Naka, Yutaka; Hirata, Yuki; Ota, Kazuhiro; Kawakami, Ken; Takeuchi, Toshihisa; Inoue, Takuya; Miyazaki, Takako; Sanomura, Makoto; Nakamura, Shiro; Saito, Yutaka; Higuchi, Kazuhide",Internal medicine,https://doi.org/10.2169/internalmedicine.6446-20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33456043/,159
128878,Improvement of the Targeting of Radiolabeled and Functionalized Liposomes with a Two-Step System Using a Bispecific Monoclonal Antibody (Anti-CEA × Anti-DTPA-In).,2015,"INTRODUCTION Maternal obesity has been linked to adverse outcomes for mothers and their offspring, including, but not limited to gestational hypertension (gHTN), gestational diabetes (GDM), pre-eclampsia, fetal macrosomia, and emergency cesarean section. Recent investigations have also shown that obesity, as defined by a body mass index (BMI) ≥ 30, especially severe obesity (BMI ≥ 40), is a risk factor for both hospitalization and death from COVID-19. OBJECTIVES The objective of this study is to determine the prevalence and association of maternal obesity at delivery with adverse antenatal, intrapartum, and neonatal outcomes in a cohort of consecutive delivering patients at a tertiary care center in Iowa from May to September 2020. A secondary objective is to determine if maternal obesity has any relationship to past or current COVID-19 infection status at the time of delivery. This is a secondary analysis of a prospective cohort study to analyze obstetric outcomes among COVID-19 infected and uninfected patients. METHODS We conducted a prospective cohort study using demographic and clinical data obtained from the electronic medical record. Excess plasma was collected from routine blood samples obtained at delivery admission to determine the seroprevalence of COVID-19 antibody using the DiaSorin and Roche antibody assays. Frequency variables were each calculated separately, and a comparison of maternal and neonatal outcomes was conducted using the generalized linear mixed modeling (GLMM) framework to account for varying distributions (normal and binary). RESULTS 1001 women delivered during the study period and 89.7% met criteria for being overweight or obese; 17.9% met criteria for severe obesity. Women with obesity had 49.8% lower odds of possessing private insurance, and women with severe obesity were less than half as likely to plan to breastfeed at the time of discharge. Women with obesity of any kind had a significantly increased odds of GDM and gHTN, and an increased risk of an infant with macrosomia, hypoglycemia, and NICU admission. No significant association was found between BMI and COVID-19 infection or disease severity. CONCLUSION This study provides insight into obstetric complications facing women with obesity, especially those with severe obesity. This report serves to highlight potential challenges, such as insurance status and labor complications, that impact women of high BMI to a greater degree when compared to their normal-weight counterparts.","Castaneda, Claire; Marsden, Katharine; Maxwell, Timothy; Ten Eyck, Patrick; Kuwaye, Daren; Kenne, Kimberly A; Merryman, Abbey S; Steffen, Haley A; Swartz, Samantha R; Merrill, Anna E; Krasowski, Matthew D; Jackson, J Brooks; Rysavy, Mary B","The journal of maternal-fetal & neonatal medicine : the official journal of the European Association of Perinatal Medicine, the Federation of Asia and Oceania Perinatal Societies, the International Society of Perinatal Obstetricians",https://doi.org/10.1080/14767058.2021.1988563; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34641757/,159

However, the severe performance degradation coming from the instability of the MoOX and its interfaces has not been well addressed. In this work, we started with a c-Si(p)/MoOX heterojunction solar cell which yielded a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 15.86 %, in which the MoOX film was synthesized by industry-compatible atomic layer deposition (ALD). The initial PCE dropped to 10.20 % after two days because of severe migration of O and Ag at the MoOX/Ag interface. We solved this by the insertion of a CrOX layer between the MoOX layer and the Ag electrode. The solar cell was found to be stable for over 8 months in air due to the suppression of interface degradation. Our work demonstrates an effective way of improving the stability of silicon solar cells with transition metal oxide carrier selective contacts.","Li, Jingye; Pan, Tianyu; Wang, Jilei; Cao, Shuangying; Lin, Yinyue; Hoex, Bram; Ma, Zhongquan; Lu, Linfeng; Yang, Liyou; Sun, Baoquan; Li, Dongdong",ACS applied materials & interfaces,https://doi.org/10.1021/acsami.0c09877; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32667771/,159

For example, the predictive coding framework assumes that people take contextual information into account when anticipating other's actions. Likewise, the teleological stance theory assumes an early developing ability to consider situational constraints in action prediction. The current study investigates, over a wide age range, whether humans flexibly integrate situational constraints in their action anticipations. By means of an eye-tracking experiment, 2-year-olds, 5-year-olds, younger and older adults (together N = 181) observed an agent repeatedly taking one of two paths to reach a goal. Then, this path became blocked, and for test trials only the other path was passable. Results demonstrated that in test trials younger and older adults anticipated that the agent would take the continuous path, indicating that they took the situational constraints into account. In contrast, 2- and 5-year-olds anticipated that the agent would take the blocked path, indicating that they still relied on the agent's previous observed behaviour and-contrary to claims by the teleological stance theory-did not take the situational constraints into account. The results highlight developmental changes in human's ability to include situational constraints in their visual anticipations. Overall, the study contributes to theories on predictive coding and the development of action understanding.","Ganglmayer, Kerstin; Haupt, Marleen; Finke, Kathrin; Paulus, Markus",Cognitive processing,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10339-021-01015-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33763791/,159

BACKGROUND Current guidelines for managing patients with hypertension mainly rely on blood pressure (BP) measured at brachial arteries (cuff BP). However, BP measured at the central aorta (central BP [CBP]) may be a better prognostic factor for predicting future cardiovascular events than cuff BP. METHODS In a derivation cohort (1,272 individuals and a median follow-up of 15 years), we determined diagnostic thresholds for CBP by using current guideline-endorsed cutoffs for cuff BP with a bootstrapping (resampling by drawing randomly with replacement) and an approximation method. To evaluate the discriminatory power in predicting cardiovascular outcomes, the derived thresholds were tested in a validation cohort (2,501 individuals with median follow-up of 10 years). RESULTS The 2 analyses yielded similar diagnostic thresholds for CBP. After rounding, systolic/diastolic threshold was 110/80 mm Hg for optimal BP and 130/90 mm Hg for hypertension. Compared with optimal BP, the risk of cardiovascular mortality increased significantly in subjects with hypertension (hazard ratio: 3.08, 95% confidence interval: 1.05 to 9.05). Of the multivariate Cox proportional hazards model, incorporation of a dichotomous variable by defining hypertension as CBP ≥ 130/90 mm Hg was associated with the largest contribution to the predictive power. CONCLUSIONS CBP of 130/90 mm Hg was determined to be the cutoff limit for normality and was characterized by a greater discriminatory power for long-term events in our validation cohort. This report represents an important step toward the application of the CBP concept in clinical practice.","Cheng, Hao-Min; Chuang, Shao-Yuan; Sung, Shih-Hsien; Yu, Wen-Chung; Pearson, Alan; Lakatta, Edward G; Pan, Wen-Harn; Chen, Chen-Huan",Journal of the American College of Cardiology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jacc.2013.06.029; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23850921/,159
145376,Epidemiologic and Molecular Study of EVs in Hospitalized Children With Severe Acute Respiratory Infection.,2019,"Background: Telehealth in the Military Health System (MHS) has long been an important tool for delivering care in deployed settings. However, the scope of nondeployed telehealth usage in the MHS has not previously been published, making full evaluation difficult. This study aims at addressing this gap by assessing trends over time, demographics, provider types, and diagnoses most associated with telehealth usage in the MHS. Methods: Secondary analysis was conducted on health care claims from the MHS Data Repository for all telehealth services provided from fiscal years 2006 to 2018. Telehealth services were identified by using Common Procedural Terminology (CPT) code modifiers GT, GQ, and 95. Patient demographics, provider type, and major diagnostic category were assessed for all telehealth services in both direct (military provided) and purchased (private sector) care. Results: Usage of telehealth services in the MHS rose ∼19-fold, from 2,549 to 48,667 occurrences, from 2006 to 2018. Physicians provided ∼60% of telehealth services overall, and the greatest usage was for mental health diagnoses. Purchased care (PC) showed differences from direct care (DC), including a greater level of expansion, greater inclusion of children and adolescents, and lower usage of telehealth for non-mental health services. Conclusions: Telehealth usage in the MHS has increased substantially from a total 2,549 occurrences in 2006 to 48,667 occurrences in 2018, demonstrating greater acceptance and usage by both DC and PC providers. Future directions include assessing provider types, diagnosis codes, and patient demographics associated with telehealth use, especially in the emerging COVID19 clinical practice environment.","Madsen, Cathaleen; Banaag, Amanda; Koehlmoos, Tracey Pérez",Telemedicine journal and e-health : the official journal of the American Telemedicine Association,https://doi.org/10.1089/tmj.2020.0474; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33733870/,159

147695,Safety and Antibody Kinetics of COVID-19 Convalescent Plasma for the Treatment of Moderate to Severe Cases of SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Pediatric Patients.,2021-05-04,"INTRODUCTION A high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) is an alternative device for oxygena-tion, which improves gas exchange and reduces the work of breathing. Postextubation respiratory failure causes increased morbidity and mortality. HFNC has been widely employed during the COVID-19 pandemic. The purpose of this paper is to report a single-centre experience on the effectiveness and safety of HFNC in weaning COVID-19 patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS Nine patients showed severe acute respiratory failure and interstitial pneumonia due to SARS-CoV-2. After mechanical ventilation (5 Helmet CPAP, 4 invasive mechanical ventilation), they were de-escalated to HFNC. Settings were: 34-37°C, flow from 50 to 60 L min-1. FiO2 was set to achieve appropriate SpO2. RESULTS Nine patients (4 females; age 63 ± 13.27 years; BMI 27.2 ± 4.27) showed a baseline PaO2/FiO2 of 109 ± 45 mm Hg. After a long course of ventilation all patients improved (PaO2/FiO2 336 ± 72 mm Hg). Immediately after initiation of HFNC (2 hours), PaO2/FiO2 was 254 ± 69.3 mm Hg. Mean ROX index at two hours was 11.17 (range: 7.38-14.4). It was consistent with low risk of HFNC failure. No difference was observed on lactate. After 48 hours of HFNC oxygen therapy (day 3), mean PaO2/FiO2 increased to 396 ± 83.5 mm Hg. All patients recovered from respiratory failure after 7 ± 4.1 days. CONCLUSIONS HFNC might be helpful in weaning COVID-19 respiratory failure. Effectiveness and comfort should be assessed between 2 and 48 hours. Clinical outcomes, oxygenation, and ROX index should be considered, to rule out the need for intubation. Further evidence is required for firm conclusions.","Simioli, Francesca; Annunziata, Anna; Langella, Gerardo; Polistina, Giorgio E; Martino, Maria; Fiorentino, Giuseppe",Anaesthesiology intensive therapy,https://doi.org/10.5114/ait.2020.101007; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33242934/,159
149443,"Use of the informational spectrum methodology for rapid biological analysis of the novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV: prediction of potential receptor, natural reservoir, tropism and therapeutic/vaccine target.",2020,"BACKGROUND With age, the acuity of the five senses (i.e., hearing, sight, taste, smell, touch) is reduced. These types of sensory changes can affect day-to-day activities, making it more difficult for individuals to communicate and to interact with the world around them. The five senses allow us to receive information from the environment in the form of sound, light, smell, taste, and touch. As an older person's senses decline, they need more stimulation to be aware of these sensations. In long-term care settings, appropriate sensory practices are needed to address the diminishing senses of older adults. The objective of this mixed-methods systematic review is to examine the relationship between the sensory practices and the quality of life of residents living in long-term care settings and to develop an aggregated synthesis of mixed-methods studies to derive recommendations for policy, practice, and research. METHODS We will conduct a mixed-methods systematic review in accordance with the Cochrane Handbook. A search strategy has been developed with an expert health sciences librarian and peer reviewed using Peer Review for Electronic Search Strategies (PRESS). Seven databases: MEDLINE (Ovid), PubMed (non-MEDLINE-Ovid), CINAHL (EBSCO), Embase (Ovid), Ageline, PsycINFO (Ovid), and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) will be searched for studies that meet the inclusion criteria. Two reviewers will independently screen the results of the literature search using a two-step process. Eligible studies will undergo a quality assessment and data extraction. Disagreements will be resolved through consultation with a third reviewer. We will assess the quality of individual studies using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool (MMAT). The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) will be used to summarize the strength of the quantitative evidence, and the Confidence in the Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative research (CERQual) tool to assess confidence in the qualitative syntheses. DISCUSSION This systematic review will summarize evidence-based knowledge for sensory practices, identify gaps in the literature, and inform an audit program for assessing the presence of sensory practices in the long-term care setting. The results will be relevant to policy makers, decision-makers, clinicians, and residents/families in long-term care settings.

However, the effect of physical activity monitor-based interventions in older adults remains unclear and should be systematically reviewed. Objective The objective of this systematic review was to estimate the effect of physical activity monitor-based interventions on physical activity behavior in participants aged 65 and above. Subsequently we explored the effect on body mass index, physical capacity, and health-related quality of life and finally the impact of patient- and intervention characteristics. Methods Searches in MEDLINE, EMBASE, SPORTDiscus, CINAHL, and CENTRAL were performed on April 26, 2018. No publication date filters were applied. References of eligible studies were scrutinized and relevant journals were hand-searched. Randomized controlled trials and randomized cross-over trials investigating the effect of a physical activity monitor-based intervention on physical activity were included. Studies were included if the mean age of the participants was above 65 years, and participants could walk independently with or without walking aids. The Cochrane handbook was used as a template for extracting data and the RoB 2.0 tool was used to assess risk of bias. Random-effects meta-analysis using Hedges g, were used to pool the study results. The main outcome of this study was physical activity. Results Twenty-one studies with 2783 participants were included. The median participant age in the studies was 70.5 years, the median percentage of male participants was 42%, and the median baseline daily step count was 5268. Physical activity monitor-based interventions had a moderate effect (SMD = 0.54, 95% CI: 0.34 to 0.73) compared to control interventions, corresponding to an average increase of 1297 steps per day in the intervention groups. No impact of patient and intervention characteristics on the effect estimates were found. Short conclusion Low quality of evidence was found for a moderate effect of physical activity monitor-based interventions on physical activity compared with control interventions.

RECENT FINDINGS Various screening tools and validated risk calculators have been shown to help predict toxicity from surgery and chemotherapy. Radiation therapy has been more challenging to select the appropriate tool to reliably predict patients at risk for toxicity and noncompliance. Ongoing work on electronic geriatric assessment tools is showing promise in making comprehensive assessment more feasible. SUMMARY Selecting appropriate cancer therapy is particularly important in older patients, and validated tools have been developed to guide clinicians for surgery and chemotherapy; however, radiotherapy toxicity remains an area for further development, as does the uptake of existing tools into routine oncology practice.","Menjak, Ines B; Giffoni de Mello Morais Mata, Danilo; Chesney, Tyler; Haase, Kristen R",Current opinion in supportive and palliative care,https://doi.org/10.1097/spc.0000000000000539; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33399394/,159

METHODS For this cross-sectional study, data collected from 591 nursing assistants in 42 nursing homes in Canada and Spain were analyzed with mixed-effects regression. RESULTS In both countries, stress related to residents' behaviors was negatively associated with job satisfaction, and, in Canada, it moderated the positive association between supervisory support and job satisfaction. Stress related to family conflict issues moderated the positive association of supervisory support and job satisfaction differently in each location: in Canada, greater stress was associated with a weaker association between supervisory support and job satisfaction; in Spain, this was also observed but only when supervisory support was sufficiently weak. DISCUSSION Stress was associated with lower job satisfaction and moderated the association of supervisory support and job satisfaction, reinforcing the importance of supervisors supporting nursing assistants, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic.","McGilton, Katherine S; Stewart, Steven; Bethell, Jennifer; Chu, Charlene H; Mateos, Jose T; Pastells-Peiró, Roland; Blanco-Blanco, Joan; Rodriguez-Monforte, Miriam; Escrig-Pinol, Astrid; Gea-Sánchez, Montserrat",Journal of applied gerontology : the official journal of the Southern Gerontological Society,https://doi.org/10.1177/0733464820980567; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33353479/,159

OBJECTIVE We assessed the efficacy of combined pre-anaesthetic forced-air warming in combination with warmed intravenous fluid infusion for preventing hypothermia and shivering during caesarean delivery under spinal anaesthesia. DESIGN A randomised controlled study. SETTING A tertiary care teaching hospital from July 2017 to April 2018. PATIENTS A total of 50 pregnant women, American Society of Anaesthesiologists physical status 2, aged 20 to 45 years, scheduled for caesarean delivery under spinal anaesthesia. INTERVENTION Patients were enrolled and randomised into two groups: an active warming group (n = 25), which received combined pre-anaesthetic whole body forced-air warming for 15 min and prewarmed intravenous fluids, and a control group, which received no active warming or warmed fluids (C group; n = 25). Spinal anaesthesia was induced with 10 mg bupivacaine containing fentanyl (10 μg). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Tympanic membrane temperature and shivering severity were measured at baseline and every 10 min during surgery, and then every 10 min for 1 h postoperatively. Neonatal outcomes (tympanic membrane temperature at birth, umbilical venous blood pH, Apgar score) were also recorded. RESULTS The incidences of peri-operative hypothermia (0 vs. 48%, P < 0.001) and shivering (22 vs. 52%, P = 0.031) were significantly lower in the active warming than in the C group. The maximum temperature change was also significantly lower in the active warming than in the C group. Maternal thermal comfort scores were higher in the active warming than in the C group. Neonatal parameters were not significantly different between the groups. CONCLUSION The combination of pre-anaesthetic forced-air warming and warmed intravenous fluid infusions appears to be effective for preventing hypothermia and shivering during caesarean delivery under spinal anaesthesia.

157750,Correct probability estimates for the risk of an anaesthetist contracting the SARS-CoV-2 virus after aerosol-generating procedures.,2021-01-24,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy has become a valuable primary bariatric operation. It has an acceptable complication profile and amount of weight loss. However, one of the most distressing complications to the patient is reflux postoperatively. There is thought to be a relationship between a hiatal hernia and postoperative reflux. There is disagreement on how to address a hiatal hernia intraoperatively, and the use of mesh is controversial. Our objectives were to examine the use of a prosthetic bioabsorbable mesh for repair of a large hiatal hernia during a sleeve gastrectomy and to examine the incidence of reflux and mesh-related complications in the near term. METHODS This is a case series of patients with hiatal hernia undergoing a primary sleeve gastrectomy. None of the patients had a previous hiatal hernia repair. Three patients with large hiatal hernias diagnosed preoperatively or intraoperatively were included. The hiatus of the diaphragm was repaired with a posterior crural closure, and a piece of prosthetic bioabsorbable mesh was placed posteriorly to reinforce the repair. RESULTS There were 3 patients. The mean follow-up period was 12 months. There were no mesh-related complications. One of the patients needed to resume proton pump inhibitors to control reflux. CONCLUSION The use of a prosthetic bioabsorbable mesh to repair a hiatal hernia simultaneously with a sleeve gastrectomy is safe. There were no mesh-related complications at 1 year.","Clapp, Benjamin",JSLS : Journal of the Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons,https://doi.org/10.4293/108680813x13693422520008; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24398209/,159

These characteristics prevent collaboration between entities, constituting a barrier to emergent personalized and public health challenges, namely the discovery of new druggable targets, identification of disease-causing genetic variants, or the study of rare diseases. In this paper, we propose a semi-automatic methodology for the analysis of distributed and private biobanks. The strategies involved in the proposed methodology efficiently enable the creation and execution of unified genomic studies using distributed repositories, without compromising the information present in the datasets. We apply the methodology to a case study in the current Covid-19, ensuring the combination of the diagnostics from multiple entities while maintaining privacy through a completely identical procedure.

165974,SARS-CoV-2 antibody changes in patients receiving COVID-19 convalescent plasma from normal and vaccinated donors,2021-08-05,"Correct bioriented attachment of sister chromatids to mitotic spindle is essential for chromosome segregation. The conserved protein shugoshin (Sgo1) contributes in budding yeast to biorientation by recruiting the protein phosphatase PP2A-Rts1 and the condensin complex to centromeres. Using peptide prints, we identified a Serine-Rich Motif (SRM) of Sgo1 that mediates the interaction with condensin and is essential for centromeric condensin recruitment and the establishment of biorientation. We show that the interaction is regulated via phosphorylation within the SRM and we determined the phospho-sites using mass spectrometry. Analysis of the phosphomimicking and phosphoresistant mutants revealed that SRM phosphorylation disrupts the shugoshin – condensin interaction. We present an evidence that Mps1, a central kinase in the spindle assembly checkpoint, directly phosphorylates Sgo1 within the SRM to regulate the interaction with condensin and thereby condensin localization to centromeres. Our findings identify novel mechanisms that control shugoshin activity at the centromere in budding yeast. Author summary Proper chromosome segregation in eukaryotes is ensured through correct attachment of the spindle microtubules to the centromeric chromosomal regions. The attachment is mediated via the multimolecular proteinaceous complex called kinetochore and precisely regulated. This enables the establishment of so called bioirentation, when each sister chromatid is attached to microtubules emanating from opposite spindle poles. Shugoshin (Sgo1) is a conserved centromeric protein that facilitates biorientation through its interactions with the protein phosphatase PP2A/Rts1, chromosome passanger complex and centromeric condensin. Here, we identified a serin-rich motif that is required for the interaction of shugoshin with the condensin complex. We show that loss of this region impairs condensin enrichment at the centromere, chromosome biorientation, segregation as well as the function of the chromosome passanger complex in the error correction. Moreover, the interaction is phosphoregulated, as phosphorylation of the serin-rich motif on Sgo1 disrupts its interaction with condensin. Finally, we show that the conserved spindle assembly checkpoint kinase Mps1 is responsible for this phosphorylation. Our findings uncover novel regulatory mechanisms that facilitate proper chromosome segregation.","Metwaly, Galal Yahya; Wu, Yehui; Peplowska, Karolina; Röhrl, Jennifer; Soh, Young-Min; Bürmann, Frank; Gruber, Stephan; Storchova, Zuzana",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2019.12.16.877894,159

171456,Comparison of children and young people admitted with SARS-CoV-2 across the UK in the first and second pandemic waves: prospective multicentre observational cohort study,2021-09-17,"Background: The provision of cancer services has been strongly impacted by the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2. Our Cancer Centre in South-East London treats approximately 8,800 patients annually and is one of the largest Comprehensive Cancer Centres in the UK. When dealing with the second wave of COVID-19, it is important to further evaluate the safety of cancer treatments whilst balancing the risks of COVID-19 infection and complications. Here, we report on the patient/tumour characteristics of those patients undergoing SACT for a urological cancer diagnosis during the first wave, so as to help establish clinical guidelines for the management of these patients in a SARS-CoV-2 epidemic. Methods: All urological cancer patients receiving at least one SACT between 1st March- 31st May 2020 (COVID-19 period) were compared to the same timeframe in 2019. SARSCoV2 infection was defined as a positive RT-PCR test;patients with symptoms or radiological changes alone were excluded. As part of Guy's Cancer Cohort, we collected information on demographics, and cancer type, stage, and treatment. Results: A total of 455 patients (305 prostate, 102 renal, 38 bladder, and 10 testicular) received SACT in 2020 as compared to 535 (353 prostate, 129 renal, 37 bladder, and 15 testicular) in 2019 (15% overall decline). Patient characteristics in terms of demographics were fairly comparable, with 10% female patients in 2019 and 9% in 2020;49% aged 70+ vs 45%;and 77% in the low socioeconomic category vs 78%. There was an increase in patients with stage 4 (89% vs 95% in 2020) and a slight change in distribution of SACT types (2019 vs 2020): chemotherapy (18% vs 14%), immunotherapy (7% vs 10%), biological or targeted (63% vs 66%), combination of biological/targeted (6% vs 5%), other combinations (5% vs 5%). The proportion of SACT delivered as part of radical treatment declined from 3% to 0.2% in 2020. A total of 5 patients (1%) developed COVID-19 (2 prostate, 2 renal, and 1 bladder). All were male and aged 60+;three had 2+ comorbidities. One patient was on immunotherapy and four on biological or targeted treatment. Four patients had severe pneumonia and one died of their COVID-19 (bladder cancer). Conclusions: Whilst there was a decline of number of patients receiving SACT during COVID-19, we were still able to provide a safe high-quality urological cancer SACT pathway during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, with very few COVID-19 positive patients. In a next step we will evaluate oncological outcomes at 6 months follow-up.","Karampera, C.; Khan, M.; Russell, B.; Moss, C.; Monroy-Iglesias, M. J.; Dolly, S.; Thillai, K.; Josephs, D.

Using biochemical and single-molecule Förster resonance energy transfer (smFRET) experiments, we studied how frameshift-inducing stem-loops from E. coli dnaX mRNA and the gag-pol transcript of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) perturb translation elongation. We find that upon encountering the ribosome, the stem-loops strongly inhibit A-site tRNA binding and ribosome intersubunit rotation that accompanies translation elongation. Electron cryo-microscopy (cryo-EM) reveals that the HIV stem-loop docks into the A site of the ribosome. Our results suggest that mRNA stem-loops can transiently escape ribosome helicase by binding to the A site. Thus, the stem-loops can modulate gene expression by sterically hindering tRNA binding and inhibiting translation elongation.","Bao, Chen; Loerch, Sarah; Ling, Clarence; Korostelev, Andrei A.; Grigorieff, Nikolaus; Ermolenko, Dmitri N.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.05.936120,159

186007,New mass spectrometric assay for angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 activity.,2006,"The 5.8 kb RNA genome of potato leafroll luteovirus (PLRV) contains two overlapping open reading frames, ORF2a and ORF2b, which are characterized by helicase and RNA polymerase motifs, respectively, and possibly represent the viral replicase. Within the overlap, ORF2b lacks an AUG translational start codon and is therefore presumably translated by -1 ribosomal frameshifting as a transframe protein with ORF2a. This hypothesis was studied by introducing the putative frameshift region into an internal position of the beta-glucuronidase (GUS) gene and testing for the occurrence of frameshifting in vivo by transient expression of GUS activity in potato protoplasts as well as in vitro by translation in the reticulocyte system. Both experimental approaches demonstrate that a -1 frameshift occurs at a frequency of approximately 1%. Site-directed mutagenesis identified the frameshift region and the involvement of the novel heptanucleotide motif UUUAAAU in conjunction with an adjacent stem-loop structure. Part of this stem-loop encodes a basic region in the ORF2b moiety of the transframe protein which was shown by binding experiments with PLRV RNA to represent a nucleic acid-binding domain. These data support a possible biological significance of the frameshift to occur at this position of the large overlap by including the putative RNA template-binding site of the PLRV replicase in the ORF2a/ORF2b transframe protein.","Prüfer, D; Tacke, E; Schmitz, J; Kull, B; Kaufmann, A; Rohde, W",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC556553/,159

Single buccal cells from controls and patients, and 1PBs were subjected to primer extension preamplification (PEP) PCR followed by amplification of F8 gene coding and intronic flanking regions, and direct sequencing. Moreover, multiplex fluorescent amplification of four short tandem repeats was adapted to a single cell preamplification in order to rule out contamination and allele drop-out, and for confirmatory indirect diagnosis. A couple at risk of HA transmission, with a familial mutation characterized as a 41-bp duplication in exon 14 of the F8 gene, was selected for the first clinical study. After optimizing the protocol, the complete F8 gene coding sequence was obtained from single cells to demonstrate the sensitivity of our methodology although in any clinical case only the relevant region, not the whole gene, must be amplified. The woman enrolled in the first clinical case has completed the first in-vitro fertilization cycle, and seven oocytes were analyzed with concordant results by both linkage analysis and direct sequencing method.

The RT-nPCR detected viral RNA in as little as 10 fg lymphoid organ total RNA isolated from GAV-infected P. monodon. Amplification of serial dilutions of a GAV cDNA clone showed that the nested PCR was sufficiently sensitive to detect a single genome equivalent using a DNA template. The specificity and sensitivity of the RT-nPCR was also demonstrated using experimentally infected P. (Marsupenaeus) japonicus, where GAV sequences could be amplified from lymphoid organ and haemocyte RNA as early as 6 h post infection (p.i.), and from gills by 24 h p.i. In contrast, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) identified nucleocapsids and virions in lymphoid organ cells and haemocytes from Days 3 and 6 p.i., respectively, while there was no evidence of infection in gill cells at any time. The practical application of the RT-nPCR was demonstrated by screening healthy wild-caught P. monodon broodstock. The high prevalence (>98%) of broodstock that were positive by RT-nPCR suggests that LOV is endemic in northern Queensland. In addition, results with lymphoid organ, gill and haemocyte RNA suggest that small gill biopsies may be best suited to the non-sacrificial testing of valuable broodstock. The speed and sensitivity of the RT-nPCR make it a useful adjunct to TEM for diagnosing LOV/GAV infection of P. monodon, with the additional benefit that screening of gill biopsies may facilitate selection of LOV-free broodstock.","Cowley, J A; Dimmock, C M; Spann, K M; Walker, P J",Diseases of aquatic organisms,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10768283/,159

Result During Songkran holiday 2015, the univariate Moran's I of RTIs distribution among provinces in Thailand showed a slightly positive spatial autocorrelation, as the Moran's I was 0.1701, with statistical significance at 0.05. Local indicators of spatial association indicated seven hotspots and five cold spots. In addition, the number of motor vehicles, and length of trunk road (super highway), tertiary roads, secondary roads, and primary roads had positive spatial autocorrelation with road traffic injury, with Moran's I values of 0.173, 0.117, 0.219, 0.162, and 0.279, respectively. Conclusion This study demonstrates that local indicators of spatial association could detect the spatial pattern of road traffic injury. The number of motor vehicles, length of all roads served as new parameters for determining road traffic injury hotspots.","Tubtimhin, S; Laohasiriwong, W; Pitaksanurat, S; Sornlorm, K; Luenam, A",Kathmandu University medical journal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33305745/,159

BACKGROUND CVH has an increased risk of postoperative infection. CVH repair with synthetic or biologic meshes has reported chronic biomaterial infections and high hernia recurrence rates. METHODS Patients with a contaminated or clean-contaminated operative field and a hernia defect at least 9 cm had a biosynthetic mesh (open, sublay, retrorectus, or intraperitoneal) repair with fascial closure (n = 104). Endpoints included overall Kaplan-Meier estimates for hernia recurrence and postoperative wound infection rates at 24 months, and the EQ-5D and Short Form 12 Health Survey (SF-12). Analyses were conducted on the intent-to-treat population, and health outcome measures evaluated using paired t tests. RESULTS Patients had a mean age of 58 years, body mass index of 28 kg/m, 77% had contaminated wounds, and 84% completed 24-months follow-up. Concomitant procedures included fistula takedown (n = 24) or removal of infected previously placed mesh (n = 29). Hernia recurrence rate was 17% (n = 16). At the time of CVH repair, intraperitoneal placement of the biosynthetic mesh significantly increased the risk of recurrences (P ≤ 0.04). Surgical site infections (19/104) led to higher risk of recurrence (P < 0.01). Mean 24-month EQ-5D (index and visual analogue) and SF-12 physical component and mental scores improved from baseline (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS In this prospective longitudinal study, biosynthetic absorbable mesh showed efficacy in terms of long-term recurrence and quality of life for CVH repair patients and offers an alternative to biologic and permanent synthetic meshes in these complex situations.This is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-Non Commercial-No Derivatives License 4.0, where it is permissible to download and share the work provided it is properly cited.

Probe design and experimental parameters important in nanowire-based MB assays are discussed. Loop regions of 24 bases and 5 base pair stem regions in the beacon probes gave optimal performance. Our results suggest that thermodynamic predictions for secondary structure stability of solution-phase MB can guide probe design for nanowire-based assays. Dengue virus-specific probes with predicted solution-phase DeltaG of folding in 500 mM buffered NaCl of approximately -4 kcal/mol performed better than those with DeltaG > -2 or < -6 kcal/mol. Buffered 300-500 mM NaCl was selected after comparison of several buffers previously reported for similar types of assays, and 200-500 mM NaCl was found to be the optimal ionic strength for the hybridization temperatures (25 and 50 degrees C) and probe designs used here. Target binding to the surface as a function of solution concentration fit a Sips isotherm with Kd = 1.7 +/- 0.3 nM. The detection limit was approximately 100 pM, limited by incomplete quenching. Single base mismatches could be discriminated from fully complementary targets. Oligonucleotide target sequences specific for human immunodeficiency, hepatitis C, and severe acute respiratory viruses were assayed simultaneously in a no-wash, sealed chamber, multiplexed experiment in which each of three probe sequences was attached to a different pattern of encoded nanowires. Finally, we demonstrated that probe-coated nanowires retain their selectivity and sensitivity in a triplexed assay after storage for over 3 months.","Stoermer, Rebecca L; Cederquist, Kristin B; McFarland, Sean K; Sha, Michael Y; Penn, Sharron G; Keating, Christine D",Journal of the American Chemical Society,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17177440/,159

199271,Be careful when stopping short term dexamethasone therapy in SARS-CoV-2 infection: An experience,2020,"Viral infection can result in alterations to the host subcellular membrane. This is often reported when using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), resulting in a description of tubuloreticular membrane subcellular ultrastructure rather than a definition based on 3-D morphology. 2-D TEM micrographs depicting subcellular membrane changes are associated with subcellular SARS virion particles [Goldsmith CS, Tatti KM, Ksiazek TG et al. Ultra-structural characterization of SARS coronavirus. Emerg Infect Dis 2004; 10: 320-326]. In the present study, we have defined the 2-D membrane pattern and shape associated with the SARS virus infection. This is by using a direct template matching method to determine what the 3-D structure of the SARS virus associated host membrane change would be. The TEM image for our purposes is defined on 2-D information, such as the membrane having undergone proliferation and from pattern recognition suggesting that the membrane-described pattern is possibly a gyroid type of membrane. Features of the membrane were used to compute and match the gyroid structure with an existing 2-D TEM micrograph, where it was revealed that the membrane structure was indeed a gyroid-based cubic membrane. The 2-D gyroid computer-simulated image that was used to match the electron micrograph of interest was derived from a mathematically well-defined 3-D structure, and it is from this 3-D derivative that allows us to make inferences about the 3-D structure of this membrane. In conclusion, we demonstrate that a 3-D structure can be defined from a 2-D membrane patterned image and that a SARS viral associated membrane change has been identified as cubic membrane morphology. Possible mechanisms for this cubic membrane change are discussed with respect to viral severity, persistence and free radical production.","Almsherqi, Zakaria A; McLachlan, Craig S; Mossop, Peter; Knoops, Kèvin; Deng, Yuru",Redox report : communications in free radical research,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16156956/,159

Two of these investigations reported through exploratory factor analysis (EFA) the number of factors extracted to examine the structure of the test which consists of variables associated with the same factor, the common underlying trait of which allows correlation between such variables. The EFA methodology is linked to the area of psychometrics that has driven the evaluation of latent variable models (not directly measurable), this has led to the development of new statistical models which are more robust such as the analysis of structural equations.

200862,"Clinical course of asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic patients with coronavirus disease admitted to community treatment centers, South Korea",2020,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an infectious disease first recognized in November 2002 in Guangdong Province, China. It spread to many countries all over the world during February to June 2003, with 8098 cases reported. Twenty-one percent of the affected people were health care workers. Because SARS is a new emerging disease, this review describes the current understanding about the etiology, clinical pictures, laboratory and radiological findings of SARS. RECENT FINDINGS Severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was quickly found to be the etiological agent of SARS in April 2003. The transmission of SARS-CoV between human beings is mainly due to close contact. Using barrier precautions, the transmission of SARS-CoV can be prevented. The most common clinical presentations of patients with SARS include fever, cough, and dyspnea. The common laboratory findings include lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, elevated serum alanine and aspartate aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase, creatine phosphokinase, and C-reactive protein. The most common radiological finding is pneumonic lesion(s) in the chest radiogram. Many patients experience exacerbation of clinical symptoms in the second week of disease course and some may progress to respiratory failure and need mechanical ventilatory support. The overall case fatality rate is 9.6%. The current method of treatment of SARS is still controversial. SUMMARY SARS is an infectious disease with high contagiousness and a high mortality rate. Early case identification and infection control are two important factors to limit its spread.","Wang, Jann-Tay; Chang, Shan-Chwen",Current opinion in infectious diseases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15021055/,159
200863,"Clinical course of asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic patients with coronavirus disease admitted to community treatment centers, South Korea",2020,"Background Alveolar air leak comprising of pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, and subcutaneous emphysema in the ongoing COVID 19 pneumonia have been increasingly reported in literature. These air leaks were also recognized in the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and H1N1 viral pandemics. Here we review the incidence and outcomes of alveolar air leaks over 400 patients admitted to our tertiary care institution for moderate-severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Methods We performed a retrospective audit of moderate to severe COVID-19 cases admitted to our hospital. Patients who were recognized as either a spontaneous pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, pneumopericardium and subcutaneous emphysema were identified. Their clinical features and characteristics were thoroughly documented and clinical outcomes were gathered. Each case has been presented as a brief synopsis. Results During the audit period, we reviewed over 670 patients, out of these 419 patients required intensive care for moderate to severe disease. 10 patients developed Pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, pneumopericardium and/ or subcutaneous emphysema - referred to as Alveolar Air leak syndrome; The incidence of alveolar air leak was found to be 2.39%. 6 patients did not survive the resultant complication. Conclusion Spontaneous alveolar air leaks are a rare but definite complication of COVID-19 viral pneumonia and may occur in the absence of mechanical ventilation. ICU Clinicians must be alert about the diagnosis and treatment of this complication.","Joshi, Sharad; Bhatia, Ankit; Tayal, Nitesh; Chaturvedi, Shailendra; Ali, Syed Jauhar",The Journal of the Association of Physicians of India,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34227771/,159
201930,Invasive Pulmonary Aspergillosis in Patients with SARS-CoV-2 Infection: A Systematic Review of the Literature,2020,"SARS-CoV-2 causes the disease named COVID-19, which emerged in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 and developed into the current pandemic. The manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection are highly variable. The worst outcomes are usually associated with advanced age and known risk factors. Among these, it would be reasonable to consider conditions compromising the immune system, particularly the immunodeficiency associated to HIV. To date, however, there is no evidence of HIV infection worsening the evolution and prognosis of COVID-19. Pneumocystis jirovecii (previously-P. carinii) pneumonia, is a fungal disease that most commonly affects immunocompromised persons and can be life-threatening. Typically, patients at risk are those with any underlying condition altering host immunity. We present the case of a middle-aged woman with Raynaud's syndrome who was admitted with pneumonia. During hospitalization she was simultaneously diagnosed with infection by HIV, COVID-19 and P. jirovecci. The patient evolved favorably upon empirical treatment without requiring invasive maneuvers or ventilatory support. Outpatient follow-up after hospital discharge was uneventful.","Larzábal, Francisco J; Vilela, Andrés; Brusca, Silvia; Saluzzi, Irene; Ghergo, Gisela E; Angiono, María Antonela",Medicina,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33048801/,159

This study aims to identify factors that explain the behavioral intention of Wuhan City urban residents to wear masks. METHODS: A theoretical model was extended on UTAUT by incorporating the feature on residents having relevant knowledge and sufficient awareness on the pandemic. During early stages of the COVID-19 outbreak, an online survey was conducted in Wuhan City and 728 valid samples were collected from 35 communities. Structural equations modeling and bootstrapping were applied. RESULTS: Sample data present acceptable reliability and validity. Performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, and knowledge about COVID-19 have positive effects on behavioral intention. Facilitating condition, knowledge, and behavioral intention have significant effects on use behavior. Gender, age, education, income, and current marital status are significant moderators in the theoretical model. CONCLUSION: Having relevant knowledge on the pandemic, together with performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, and facilitating condition, affects behavioral intention and usage behavior of Wuhan residents to wear masks at early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. Subgroups have different psychological mechanisms based on their demographic characteristics. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Health policy makers should focus on enhancing residents' knowledge on infectious disease and their awareness of the risk mitigation, and develop personalized measures for different subgroups.","Zhou, Min; Long, Piao; Kong, Nan; Campy, Kathryn S",Patient educ. couns,,159

While the challenges of conducting research in high-prevalence countries are well published, there is a paucity from low COVID-19 countries. METHODS: A PRISMA guided systematic review was conducted using the databases Ovid-Medline, Embase, Scopus and Web of Science to identify relevant articles discussing ethical issues relating to research in low prevalence COVID-19 countries. RESULTS: The search yielded 133 original articles of which only 2 fit the inclusion criteria and aim, with neither specific to low prevalence. Most of the available literature focused on clinical management and resource allocation related to high prevalence countries. These results will be discussed under the ethical dimensions of equity, individual liberty, privacy and confidentiality, proportionality, public protection, provision of care, reciprocity, stewardship and trust.. CONCLUSIONS: A systematic review failed to identify articles relating to COVID-19 research ethics, specific to low prevalence countries. It shows that there is a significant gap in the literature that warrants further investigation. Common ethical principles were used to present a distinct set of challenges experienced by a country with a low prevalence of COVID-19. This unique perspective of some of the common ethical problems surrounding research, may help guide further discussion and guide research in similar countries.","Skapetis, Tony; Law, Constance; Rodricks, Rohan",BMC Med Ethics,,159
207633,Characteristics and Prognosis of Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Disease During the SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic in the Basque Country (Spain),2020,"This study assessed implications of the Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic on household income and food security in two East African countries - Kenya and Uganda, using online survey data from 442 respondents. Results show that more than two-thirds of the respondents experienced income shocks due to the COVID-19 crisis. Food security and dietary quality worsened, as measured by the food insecurity experience scale and the frequency of consumption of nutritionally-rich foods. The proportion of food insecure respondents increased by 38% and 44% in Kenya and Uganda respectively, and in both countries, the regular consumption of fruits decreased by about 30% during the COVID-19 pandemic, compared to a normal period (before the pandemic). Results from probit regressions show that the income-poor households and those dependent on labour income were more vulnerable to income shock, and had poorer food consumption during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to other respondent categories. As such, they were more likely to employ food-based coping strategies compared to those pursuing alternative livelihoods, who generally relied on savings. Farmers were less likely to experience worsened food security compared to other respondent categories who depended to a great extent on market sources for food. In both countries, participation in national social security schemes was less likely to mitigate respondents' income shock during the COVID-19 period. Conversely, membership in savings and loan groups was correlated with less likelihood of suffering income shocks and reduction in food consumption. The results suggest that ongoing and future government responses should focus on structural changes in social security by developing responsive packages to cushion members pushed into poverty by such pandemics while building strong financial institutions to support the recovery of businesses in the medium term, and ensuring the resilience of food supply chains particularly those making available nutrient-dense foods.","Kansiime, Monica K; Tambo, Justice A; Mugambi, Ms Idah; Bundi, Ms Mary; Kara, Augustine; Owuor, Mr Charles",World Dev,,159

The aim of the study was to evaluate perioperative complications and the safety of STB in a tertiary care university hospital setting. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Intra- and postoperative complications were retrospectively recorded and associations based on the evaluation of clinical and laboratory parameters were studied using regression analyses. RESULTS: A total of 562 patients were included. Early tracheotomy shortened ventilation time after tracheotomy (ventilation before STB &#8804; 5 days: mean 9.2 ± 9.1 days; ventilation before STB &#8805; 6 days: mean 11.5 ± 10.5 days, p = 0.0001). Overall complications were found in 30/562 cases (5.3%), major complications in 12/562 cases (2.1%). Significant risk factors for overall tracheotomy related complications were higher body mass index (odds ratio [OR] 1.04, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01-1.07, p = 0.02), lower CRP (OR 0.99, CI 0.99-1.00, p = 0.03), higher INR (OR 5.67, CI 1.27-25.34, p = 0.02), longer duration of operation (OR 1.03, CI 1.00-1.06, p = 0.04) and tracheotomy during extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support (OR 6.26, CI 1.21-32.44, p = 0.03). CONCLUSION: STB represents a safe surgical procedure, also suitable for patients with an increased risk profile.

Through a longitudinal qualitative case study, we place relationality and becoming at the centre of organizing food and food systems, demonstrating how entangled relationships can create a complex ontology through the meshwork knots, threads and weave. We show how issues of collective concern come together to form dynamic knots of interactions, how the threads within the meshwork indicate processes of movement, and how the weave suggests degrees of food system resilience-but always in flow. This theoretical approach thus provides a platform for addressing thoughtful concerns about ""food matters"" including the integrity of our global food system, the negative health and environmental impacts of industrialized food production, and food safety issues.","Pavlovich, Kathryn; Henderson, Alison; Barling, David",Agric Human Values,,159

210876,Performances of the VitaPCR™ SARS-CoV-2 Assay during the second wave of the COVID-19 epidemic in France,2021,"CONTEXT: The pandemic has substantially increased the workload of hospital palliative care providers, requiring them to be responsive and innovative despite limited information on the specific end of life care needs of patients with COVID-19. Multi-site data detailing clinical characteristics of patient deaths from large populations, managed by specialist and generalist palliative care providers is lacking. OBJECTIVES: To conduct a large multicenter study examining characteristics of COVID-19 hospital deaths and implications for care. METHODS: A multi-center retrospective evaluation examined 434 COVID-19 deaths in 5 hospital trusts over the period 23/03/20-10/05/20. RESULTS: Eighty three percent of patients were over 70 and 32% were admitted from care homes. Diagnostic timing indicated over 90% of those who died contracted the virus in the community. Dying was recognized in over 90% of patients, with the possibility of dying being identified less than 48 hours from admission for a third. In over a quarter, death occurred less than 24 hours later. Patients who were recognized to be dying more than 72 hours prior to death are most likely to have access to medication for symptom control. CONCLUSION: This large multicenter study comprehensively describes COVID-19 deaths throughout the hospital setting. Clinicians are alert to and diagnose dying appropriately in most patients. Outcomes could be improved by advance care planning to establish preferences, including whether hospital admission is desirable, and alongside this, support the prompt use of anticipatory subcutaneous medications and syringe drivers if needed. Finally, rapid discharges and direct hospice admissions could better utilize hospice beds and improve care.","Dewhurst, Felicity; Billett, Hannah; Simkiss, Lauri; Bryan, Charlotte; Barnsley, Julie; Charles, Max; Fleming, Elizabeth; Grieve, Jennifer; Hacking, Sade; Howorth, Kate; Huggin, Amy; Kavanagh, Emily; Kiltie, Rachel; Lowery, Lucy; Miller, Dene; Nicholson, Alex; Nicholson, Lucy; Paxton, Ann; Porteous, Anna; Rowley, Grace; Snell, Kaly; Woods, Elizabeth; Zabrocki, Elizabeth; Frew, Katherine; Srivastava, Leena",J. pain symptom manage,,159

Ministries of Health or other similar authorized institutions allow use of such drugs in strictly controlled clinical trials or under special procedures. Our research aim was to study the state of physical availability and affordability of protocol drugs for treatment of coronavirus disease COVID-19 in Ukraine. Methods: Comparative analysis of clinical protocols for treatment of COVID-19 and data from State Registers of Medicines (SRM) of Ukraine. Results: In Ukraine two special drugs: remdesivir and favipivir are included in clinical protocols (orders of the Ministry of Health No 762 from 02.04 ® No 2583 from 11.11.2020), but unlike model WHO protocol, which includes remdesivir, Ukrainian protocols doesn’t indicate their experimental use or experimental treatment. Drugs, recommended by Ukraine protocols, according to SRM: tocilizumab is registered under 1 tradename in 2 technological forms: concentrate for infusion solution and solution for injection. Lopinavir is registered only in combination with ritonavir under 2 tradenames in 2 technological forms: tablets in 2 dosages and solution for oral administration. In addition, ritonavir is registered under 1 tradename alone and under another tradename in a triple combination. In general, INN Azithromycin as a first-line drug for the treatment of pneumonia, as a complication of COVID-19, in SRM of Ukraine appears under 77 trade names (including dosages and technological forms);62 of them are included in National List. Dexamethasone, recommended as an adjunct to combination therapy, is listed under 27 items in SRM. Enoxaparin as low molecularweight heparin is listed in SRM under 5 items. Conclusions: Analysis of Ukraine SRM showed that new experimental antiviral drugs remdesivir and favipivir included in clinical protocol for COVID-19 treatment in Ukraine are unregistered and generally absent.","Blavatska, O.; Blavatskyi, I.",Value in Health,,159
213279,The clinical characteristics of pediatric inpatients with SARS-CoV-2 infection: A meta-analysis and systematic review,2020,"The objective of this prospective cohort study was to investigate the effect of bovine coronavirus (BCoV), bovine rotavirus (BRoV), and Cryptosporidiumparvum on dairy calf health and performance and to determine the prevalence of these pathogens. A total of 198 male dairy calves housed at a grain-fed veal facility were examined from June 11, 2018, to October 9, 2018. Calves were fed milk replacer twice daily and housed individually until weaning at 56 d. Once weaned, calves were moved into groups of 5 until they were moved to a finishing facility at 77 d. At the grain-fed veal facility, calves were scored for fecal consistency for the first 28 d and had fecal samples taken on arrival and at 7 and 14 d. Fecal samples were frozen and submitted to a commercial laboratory, where they were tested for BCoV, C.parvum, and 2 groups of BRoV: group A (BRoV A) and group B (BRoV B). Calves were weighed on arrival and at 14, 49, 56, and 77 d using a digital body scale. Treatments for disease and mortalities that occurred over the 77 d were also recorded. Statistical models, including Cox proportional hazards and repeated measures models, were built to determine the effect of infection with 1 of the pathogens. Over the 3 sampling points, 151 (85.8%), 178 (94.2%), 3 (1.5%), and 97 (57.4%) calves tested positive at least once for BCoV, BRoV A, BRoV B, and C.parvum, respectively. The source of the calves and the level of serum total protein measured on arrival were associated with testing positive for a pathogen. Calves that tested positive for C.parvum had an increased proportion of days with diarrhea and severe diarrhea; calves that tested positive for BCoV and BRoV A had an increased proportion of days with severe diarrhea. In addition, calves that tested positive for C.parvum had a higher hazard of being treated for respiratory disease. With respect to body weight, calves that had diarrhea or severe diarrhea had lower body weight at 49, 56, and 77 d. Specifically, calves that had an increased proportion of days with diarrhea showed a reduction in weight gain of up to 15 kg compared to calves without diarrhea. Calves that tested positive for C.parvum had a lower body weight at 49, 56, and 77 d; calves that tested positive for BCoV had a lower body weight at 56 and 77 d. This study demonstrates that the prevalence of BCoV, BRoV A, and C.parvum infection is high in this population of calves and has significant effects on the occurrence of diarrhea and body weight gain. Future studies should evaluate approaches for minimizing the effect of infection with these pathogens to improve the welfare, health, and productivity of dairy calves.","Renaud, D L; Rot, C; Marshall, J; Steele, M A",J Dairy Sci,,159
213809,Lack of detrimental effect of corticosteroids on antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 and viral clearance in patients hospitalized with COVID-19,2020,"BACKGROUND: A novel coronavirus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was identified at the end of 2019. The disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 was named COVID-19. The main purpose of this review was to provide an overview of SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: The authors searched the MEDLINE database for clinical studies related to virus characteristics, pathogenesis, diagnosis, transmission mechanisms, and treatment options. RESULTS: As of January 27, 2021, the number of infected people and deaths associated with COVID-19 worldwide were approximately 100 million and 2 million, respectively. The manifestations of COVID-19 are variable, and the severity is affected by age and preexisting medical conditions. Children and adolescents are usually asymptomatic or have mild symptoms. Older adults, in comparison, may experience severe illness and have disproportionally elevated mortality. Among those who survive, some may experience enduring deficits. The viral load is particularly elevated in saliva and oropharynx, which constitute potential sources of infection. The diagnosis of the disease may be confounded by factors related to the replicating cycle of the virus, viral load, and sensitivity of the diagnostic method used. As of January 2021, COVID-19 has no cure but can be prevented. Its treatment is based on supportive care along with antiviral medications and monoclonal antibodies. In severe cases with multiorgan involvement, mechanical ventilation, dialysis, and hemodynamic support may be necessary. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 is a transmittable disease with a variable course. A substantial number of patients, particularly children, remain asymptomatic. Important advances have been made in the development of new treatments. However, the mortality in vulnerable populations remains elevated. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: The elevated viral load in the oral cavity and pharynx suggests that oral health care professionals could get infected through occupational exposure. Providers should understand the variables that influence the yield of diagnostic studies because false-negative results can occur.","Lamberghini, Flavia; Testai, Fernando D",J Am Dent Assoc,,159
215265,SARS-CoV-2 lung disease in a patient with pulmonary sarcoidosis - case report,2020,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate how racial/ethnic density and residential segregation shape the uneven burden of COVID-19 in US counties and whether (if yes, how) residential segregation moderates the association between racial/ethnic density and infections. DESIGN: We first merge various risk factors from federal agencies (e.g. Census Bureau and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) with COVID-19 cases as of June 13th in contiguous US counties (N = 3,042). We then apply negative binomial regression to the county-level dataset to test three interrelated research hypotheses and the moderating role of residential segregation is presented with a figure. RESULTS: Several key results are obtained. (1) Counties with high racial/ethnic density of minority groups experience more confirmed cases than those with low levels of density. (2) High levels of residential segregation between whites and non-whites increase the number of COVID-19 infections in a county, net of other risk factors. (3) The relationship between racial/ethnic density and COVID-19 infections is enhanced with the increase in residential segregation between whites and non-whites in a county. CONCLUSIONS: The pre-existing social structure like residential segregation may facilitate the spread of COVID-19 and aggravate racial/ethnic health disparities in infections. Minorities are disproportionately affected by the novel coronavirus and focusing on pre-existing social structures and discrimination in housing market may narrow the uneven burden across racial/ethnic groups.","Yang, Tse-Chuan; Emily Choi, Seung-Won; Sun, Feinuo",Ethn Health,,159

224035,Clinical value anti-SARS-COV-2 serum IgA titration in patients with COVID-19,2020,"Since the outbreak of the novel corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) at the end of 2019, specific antiviral drugs have been lacking. A Chinese patent medicine Toujiequwen granules has been promoted in the treatment of COVID-19. The present study was designed to reveal the molecular mechanism of Toujiequwen granules against COVID-19. A network pharmacological method was applied to screen the main active ingredients of Toujiequwen granules. Network analysis of 149 active ingredients and 330 drug targets showed the most active ingredient interacting with many drug targets is quercetin. Drug targets most affected by the active ingredients were PTGS2, PTGS1, and DPP4. Drug target disease enrichment analysis showed drug targets were significantly enriched in cardiovascular diseases and digestive tract diseases. An ""active ingredient-target-disease"" network showed that 57 active ingredients from Toujiequwen granules interacted with 15 key targets of COVID-19. There were 53 ingredients that could act on DPP4, suggesting that DPP4 may become a potential new key target for the treatment of COVID-19. GO analysis results showed that key targets were mainly enriched in the cellular response to lipopolysaccharide, cytokine activity and other functions. KEGG analysis showed they were mainly concentrated in viral protein interaction with cytokine and cytokine receptors and endocrine resistance pathway. The evidence suggests that Toujiequwen granules might play an effective role by improving the symptoms of underlying diseases in patients with COVID-19 and multi-target interventions against multiple signaling pathways related to the pathogenesis of COVID-19.","Yang, Bao-Yu; Wang, Hao-Zhen; Ma, Zhen-Zhong; Lu, Chen; Li, Yang; Lu, Zi-Yin; Lu, Xiu-Li; Gao, Bing",Curr Med Sci,,159

This study aims to analyze the diffusion of SARS-CoV-2 in Spain using maximum likelihood phylogenetic and Bayesian phylodynamic analyses. The most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic was estimated in Wuhan, China, around November 24, 2019. Phylogenetic analyses of the first 12,511 SARS-CoV-2 whole genome sequences obtained worldwide, including 290 from 11 different regions of Spain, revealed 62 independent introductions of the virus in the country. Most sequences from Spain were distributed in clades characterized by D614G substitution in S gene (20A, 20B and 20C) and L84S substitution in ORF8 (19B) with 163 and 118 sequences, respectively, with the remaining sequences branching in 19A. A total of 110 (38%) sequences from Spain grouped in four different monophyletic clusters of 20A clade (20A-Sp1 and 20A-Sp2) and 19B clade (19B-Sp1 and 19B-Sp2) along with sequences from 29 countries worldwide. The MRCA of 19A-Sp1, 20A-Sp1, 19A-Sp2 and 20A-Sp2 clusters were estimated in Spain around January 21 and 29, and February 6 and 17, 2020, respectively. The prevalence of 19B clade in Spain (40%) was by far higher than in any other European country during the first weeks of the epidemic, probably by a founder effect. However, this variant was replaced by G614-bearing viruses in April. In vitro assays showed an enhanced infectivity of pseudotyped virions displaying G614 substitution compared with D614, suggesting a fitness advantage of D614G.IMPORTANCE Multiple SARS-CoV-2 introductions have been detected in Spain and at least four resulted in the emergence of locally transmitted clusters originated not later than mid-February, with further dissemination to many other countries around the world and a few weeks before the explosion of COVID-19 cases detected in Spain during the first week of March. The majority of the earliest variants detected in Spain branched in 19B clade (D614 viruses), which was the most prevalent clade during the first weeks of March, pointing to a founder effect. However, from mid-March to June, 2020, G614-bearing viruses (20A, 20B and 20C clades) overcame D614 variants in Spain, probably as a consequence of an evolutionary advantage of this substitution in the spike protein. A higher infectivity of G614-bearing viruses compared to D614 variants was detected, suggesting that this substitution in SARS-CoV-2 spike protein could be behind the variant shift observed in Spain.","Díez-Fuertes, Francisco; Iglesias-Caballero, María; García Pérez, Javier; Monzón, Sara; Jiménez, Pilar; Varona, Sarai; Cuesta, Isabel; Zaballos, Ángel; Jiménez, Mercedes; Checa, Laura; Pozo, Francisco; Pérez-Olmeda, Mayte; Thomson, Michael M; Alcamí, José; Casas, Inmaculada",J. virol,,159

Here we report three cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection within one family. Sequencing of the S gene of the viral genome showed 100% identity among samples, suggesting that the same strain caused the infection. Following treatment with oseltamivir and short-term methylprednisolone combined with symptomatic management, all three patients recovered within 3 weeks, as evidenced by the disappearance of their symptoms, clearance of pulmonary infiltrates and consecutive negative molecular diagnostic test findings. Our observations suggest the importance of preventing family transmission and the efficacy of current integrated treatment for mild/moderate pneumonia in COVID-19 cases.","Xiong, Yong; Song, Shihui; Ye, Guangming; Wang, Xinghuan",BMJ case reports,,159

Globally well-connected areas with high population densities are hence expected to be disproportionately affected by COVID-19. This paper investigates the role of population density within the Netherlands, comparing hospitalisation and mortality related to COVID-19 across municipalities. The paper finds that infections, hospitalisation and mortality related to COVID-19 are not clearly correlated with the population density or urbanity of the municipality, also when controlling for age and public health factors. The paper concludes that while the public debate stresses the elevated risk of infections in cities, due to transgressive behaviour, the evidence in this paper suggests that the geography of the epidemic in the Netherlands is more complex. It speculates that the variation in urbanisation in most of the country might just be too small to expect significant differences.","Boterman, Willem R.",Tijdschr. Econ. Soc. Geogr.,,159

And cognitive assessment has not been studied in asymptomatic subjects. We compared the cognitive assessment scores between asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infected subjects with that of controls to detect mild cognitive impairment by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment test. Asymptomatic COVID-19 subjects secured lower scores in certain domains of the MoCA in comparison with the controls. The domains were visuoperception (2.4 ± 0.7 vs2.8 ± 0.7, p = 0.032), naming (3.6 ± 0.5 vs3.9 ± 0.2, p = 0.016) and fluency (0.9 ± 0.6 vs1.6 ± 0.7, p = < 0.001). Also, older aged COVID-19 positive subjects scored lower in the MoCA when compared to the younger people. Our study shows that even otherwise asymptomatic COVID-19 subjects have cognitive deficits in certain subdomains and suggests the need for a detailed psychometric assessment especially in the elderly population.

232923,The Involvement of MicroRNAs in SARS-CoV-2 Infection Comorbid with HIV-Associated Preeclampsia,2021,"Proton beam therapy is widely used for treating brain tumor. Despite the efficacy of treatment, the use of this therapy has met some limitations associated with possible damage to normal brain tissues located beyond the tumor site. In this context, the exploration of the harmful effects of protons on the normal brain tissues is of particular interest. We have investigated changes in the total mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number and identified mtDNA mutant copies in three brain regions (the hippocampus, cortex and cerebellum) of rats after irradiation their whole-head with 150 MeV protons at doses of 3 and 5 Gy. The study was performed in 2-months old male Spraque Dawley rats (n = 5 each group). The mtDNA copy numbers were determined by real-time PCR. The level of mtDNA heteroplasmy was estimated using Surveyor nuclease technology. Our results show that after head exposure to protons, levels of mtDNA copy number in three rat brain regions increase significantly as the levels of mtDNA mutant copies increase. The most significant elevation is observed in the hippocampus. In conclusion, an increase in mtDNA mutant copies may contribute to mitochondrial dysfunction accompanied by increased oxidative stress in different brain regions and promote the development of neurodegenerative diseases and the induction of carcinogenesis.","Abdullaev, Serazhutdin; Bulanova, Tatiana; Timoshenko, Gennady; Gaziev, Azhub I",Mol.

A new SARS-CoV-2 antigen test (LUMIPULSEâ) was licensed and widely used in Japan since May 2020. We conducted this study intending to whether the automated quantitative CLEIA antigen test using a saliva sample is effective and valid for the diagnosis of COVID-19. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed and compared the diagnostic accuracy of both the automated quantitative CLEIA antigen test and real-time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR) using a saliva sample from individuals suspected as having COVID-19. RESULTS: A total of 305 samples were collected and tested in Aichi Medical University Hospital and affiliated facilities from December 2020 until January 2021 at our institute. Using reverse-transcription PCR as a reference, the AUROC of the automated quantitative CLEIA antigen test was 0.903 (95% confidential interval 0.845-0.962, p < 0.001). The appropriate cut-off antigen level was 4.0 pg/mL and had a sensitivity of 77.8%, a specificity of 99.6%, a positive predictive value of 98%, and a negative predictive value of 94.5%. On the other hand, the diagnostic accuracy of the antigen test decreased among patients among patients with COVID-19 with threshold cycle (Ct-value)&#8805;27, which shows the AUROC was 0.795 (95%CI 0.687-0.907, p < 0.001).

234463,Sars-cov-2 Infection and Seroconversion in Pediatric Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patients,2021,"OBJECTIVE: Due to concerns of infection and medication disruptions during the COVID-19 pandemic, rheumatology patients at the pandemic epicenter were at risk of distress and poor health outcomes. We sought to investigate medication disruptions and COVID-related distress shortly after the peak of the pandemic in the Bronx, NY, and determine whether factors related to the pandemic were associated with flares, disease activity, and overall health. METHODS: We surveyed adult patients and parents of pediatric patients from rheumatology clinics in the Bronx, in the month following the epidemic peak regarding medication access, medication interruptions, COVID-19 infection, COVID-19 hospitalization, and COVID-related distress. We examined which factors associated with patient-reported flares, disease activity, and overall health scores in regression models accounting for socio-demographics and rheumatologic disease type. RESULTS: Of 1,692 patients and parents contacted, 361 (21%) responded; 16% reported medication access difficulty, 14% medication interruptions, and 41% flare. In a multivariable logistic regression model, medication access difficulty was associated with increased odds of flare (OR 4.0, 95% CI 1.5-10.4, p=0.005), as was high COVID-related distress (OR 2.4, 95% CI 1.2-4.6, p=0.01). In multivariable linear regression models, medication access difficulty and high distress were associated with worse disease activity scores and high distress was associated with worse health scores. CONCLUSION: Medication access difficulties and flares were common among rheumatology patients from the Bronx, NY in the month following the epidemic peak.

236779,"Author´s answer to: ""Effect of adacolumn® in ulcerative colitis with COVID-19""",2020,"Avermectins are a group of drugs that occurs naturally as a product of fermenting Streptomyces avermitilis, an actinomycetes, isolated from the soil. Eight different structures, including ivermectin, abamectin, doramectin, eprinomectin, moxidectin, and selamectin, were isolated and divided into four major components (A1a, A2a, B1a and B2a) and four minor components (A1b, A2b, B1b, and B2b). Avermectins are generally used as a pesticide for the treatment of pests and parasitic worms as a result of their anthelmintic and insecticidal properties. Additionally, they possess anticancer, anti-diabetic, antiviral, antifungal, and are used for treatment of several metabolic disorders. Avermectin generally works by preventing the transmission of electrical impulse in the muscle and nerves of invertebrates, by amplifying the glutamate effects on the invertebrates-specific gated chloride channel. Avermectin has unwanted effects or reactions, especially when administered indiscriminately, which include respiratory failure, hypotension, and coma. The current review examines the mechanism of actions, biosynthesis, safety, pharmacokinetics, biological toxicity and activities of avermectins.","El-Saber Batiha, Gaber; Alqahtani, Ali; Ilesanmi, Omotayo B; Saati, Abdullah A; El-Mleeh, Amany; Hetta, Helal F; Magdy Beshbishy, Amany",,,159

We consider the setting where multiple viruses are simultaneously prevalent in the population, and the spread occurs due to not only individual-to-individual interaction but also due to individual-to-resource interaction. In such a setting, an individual is either not affected by any of the viruses, or infected by one and exactly one of the multiple viruses. We classify the equilibria into three classes: a) the healthy state (all viruses are eradicated), b) single-virus endemic equilibria (all but one viruses are eradicated), and c) coexisting equilibria (multiple viruses simultaneously infect separate fractions of the population). We provide i) a sufficient condition for exponential (resp. asymptotic) eradication of a virus; ii) a sufficient condition for the existence, uniqueness and asymptotic stability of a single-virus endemic equilibrium; iii) a necessary and sufficient condition for the healthy state to be the unique equilibrium; and iv) for the bi-virus setting (i.e., two competing viruses), a sufficient condition and a necessary condition for the existence of a coexisting equilibrium. Building on these analytical results, we provide two mitigation strategies: a technique that guarantees convergence to the healthy state; and, in a bi-virus setup, a scheme that employs one virus to ensure that the other virus is eradicated. The results are illustrated in a numerical study of a spread scenario in Stockholm city.","Janson, Axel; Gracy, Sebin; E.Par'e, Philip; Sandberg, Henrik; H.Johansson, Karl",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.07569v1.pdf,159

Though the problem we generate applies more broadly than the Bridge problem, we believe it makes a good exemplar of the kind of case we believe is problematic. First, we argue that simulations of these thought experiments run into a practicality horn that makes it practically impossible to produce them. These problems revolve around concepts that we call ""perspectival fidelity"" and ""context realism."" Moral dilemmas that include features present in the Bridge variant will, as a result, be practically impossible to simulate. We also argue that, should we be wrong about the practical impossibility of creating a VR simulation of Bridge, such a simulation must face an ethical horn which renders these simulations ethically impermissible to develop or use. For these reasons, we argue that it is virtually impossible to simulate the bridge problem (and other thought experiments with similar features) both practically and ethically in VR.","Ramirez, Erick Jose; LaBarge, Scott",,,159

No specific methods have been identified to predict, detect and quantify the microvascular alterations during COVID-19. Our aim was to assess microvasculature through nailfold videocapillaroscopy (NVC) in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: We performed NVC in patients with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia. Elementary alterations were reported for each finger according to a semi-quantitative score. Capillary density, number of enlarged and giant capillaries, number of micro-hemorrhages and micro-thrombosis (NEMO score) were registered. RESULTS: We enrolled 82 patients (mean age 58.8 ± 13.2 years, male 68.3%) of whom 28 during the hospitalization and 54 after recovery and hospital discharge. At NVC examination we found abnormalities classifiable as non-specific pattern in 53 patients (64.6%). Common abnormalities were pericapillary edema (80.5%), enlarged capillaries (61.0%), sludge flow (53.7%), meandering capillaries and reduced capillary density (50.0%). No pictures suggestive of scleroderma pattern have been observed. Acute COVID-19 patients, compared to recovered patients, showed a higher prevalence of hemosiderin deposits as a result of micro-hemorrhages (P = .027) and micro-thrombosis (P < .016), sludge flow (P = .001), and pericapillary edema (P < .001), while recovered patients showed a higher prevalence of enlarged capillaries (P < .001), loss of capillaries (P = .002), meandering capillaries (P < .001), and empty dermal papillae (P = .006). CONCLUSION: COVID-19 patients present microvascular abnormalities at NVC. Currently ill and recovered subjects are characterized by a different distribution of elementary capillaroscopic alterations, resembling acute and post-acute microvascular damage. Further studies are needed to assess the clinical relevance of NVC in COVID-19.","Natalello, Gerlando; De Luca, Giacomo; Gigante, Laura; Campochiaro, Corrado; De Lorenzis, Enrico; Verardi, Lucrezia; Paglionico, Annamaria; Petricca, Luca; Martone, Anna Maria; Calvisi, Stefania; Ripa, Marco; Cavalli, Giulio; Della-Torre, Emanuel; Tresoldi, Moreno; Landi, Francesco; Bosello, Silvia Laura; Gremese, Elisa; Dagna, Lorenzo",Microvasc Res,,159

No therapeutics have yet been proven effective for treating severe COVID-19. OBJECTIVES: To determine whether human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cell infusion may be effective and safe for the treatment of severe COVID-19. METHODS: Patients with severe COVID-19 were randomly divided into 2 groups: the standard treatment group and the standard treatment plus hUC-MSC infusion group. The incidence of progression from severe to critical illness, 28-day mortality, clinical symptom improvement, time to clinical symptom improvement, hematologic indicators including C-reactive protein, lymphocyte number, and interleukin 6, and imaging changes were observed and compared between the two groups. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The incidence of progression from severe to critical illness and the 28-day mortality rate were 0 in the hUC-MSC treatment group, while 4 patients in the control group deteriorated to critical condition and received invasive ventilation; 3 of them died, and the 28-day mortality rate was 10.34%. In the hUC-MSC treatment group, the time to clinical improvement was shorter than that in the control group. Clinical symptoms of weakness and fatigue, shortness of breath, and low oxygen saturation obviously improved beginning on the third day of stem cell infusion and reached a significant difference on day 7. CRP and IL-6 levels were significantly lower from day 3 of infusion, the time for the lymphocyte count to return to the normal range was significantly faster, and lung inflammation absorption was significantly shorter on CT imaging in the hUC-MSC group than in the control group. CONCLUSIONS: Intravenous transplantation of hUC-MSCs is a safe and effective method that can be considered a salvage and priority treatment option for severe COVID-19.

This study aimed to evaluate the dynamics of the evolution of new community cases, and mortality records of COVID-19 in the State of Pará, which has a subtropical climate with temperatures between 20 and 35 °C, after the implementation of social distancing by quarantine and adoption of lockdown. The follow-up was carried out by the daily data from the technical bulletins provided by the State of Pará Public Health Secretary (SESPA). On 18 March 2020, Pará notified the first case of COVID-19. After 7 weeks, the number of confirmed cases reached 4756 with 375 deaths. The results show it took 49 days for 81% of the 144 states municipalities, distributed over an area of approximately 1 248 000 km2 to register COVID-19 cases. Temperature variations between 24.5 and 33.1 °C did not promote the decline in the new infections curve. The association between social isolation, quarantine and lockdown as an action to contain the infection was effective in reducing the region's new cases registration of COVID-19 in the short-term. However, short periods of lockdown may have promoted the virus spread among peripheral municipalities of the capital, as well as to inland regions.","Lélis da Silva, Félix; Dias Pita, Javier; Gomes, Maryjane Diniz A; Lélis da Silva, Andréa P; da Silva, Gabriel Lélis P",Epidemiol Infect,,159

the complete clinical picture regarding COVID-19 is not yet fully known, based on currently available information, older adults, and people of any age who have a serious underlying medical condition, might be at a higher risk of becoming severely ill with COVID-19 The emergence and rapid spread of COVID-19 is not only becoming a new public health crisis, but it is also wreaking havoc on the global economy and industries However, investigations into the disease, patient-tracking mechanisms and the transmission of case reports seem to both labor-intensive and slow OBJECTIVE: The ongoing pandemic is putting healthcare systems under strain worldwide and forcing hospitals and other medical facilities to scramble to make sure that data can be shared effectively The primary aim of this study is to design a Global Infectious Disease Surveillance and Case-Tracking system that is capable of facilitating the detection and control of COVID-19 transmission A block-chain-based architecture has been built to protect the security and guarantee the correctness of the International Patient Summary (IPS) The primary aim of this study is to design a Global Infectious Disease Surveillance and Case-Tracking system that is capable of facilitating the detection and control of COVID-19 transmission We have designed an International Patient Summary (IPS) that is based on the HL7/FHIR standard and have used block-chain architecture to build a platform for protecting the security and guaranteeing the correctness of IPS METHODS: An International Patient Summary (IPS), which is an electronic health record that contains essential healthcare information about a patient, is used in this study IPS is designed to support the used case scenario for 'unplanned, cross-border care' It is intended to be international, i e , to provide generic solutions for global application beyond a region or country The design, global scope, and utility of IPS for unplanned cross-border care, and its potential for re-use, make it suitable for a situation like COVID-19 The Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) confirmed that IPS, which includes symptoms, therapies, medications, and laboratory data, can be efficiently transferred and exchanged on the system for easy access by physicians Patient data are de-identified to protect their privacy All systems are protected by block-chain architecture, including data encryption, validation, and exchange or transfer records Members of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in various countries will be able to carry out risk control and track high-risk groups by using a tracking module in the system RESULTS: This study designs an International Patient Summary (IPS) that complies with infectious disease surveillance and clinically-meaningful data, according to the IPS HL7-FHIR guidelines In order to achieve the purpose of global COVID-19 surveillance and to enhance health resilience, a global infectious disease information exchange must be enacted The COVID-19 surveillance system was built and designed, based on block-chain architecture IPS is used to exchange case study information among physicians When physicians pass the system verification, they can upload the case IPS and get the IPS data of other global cases from the system The system includes a daily IPS uploading and enhancement plan, which covers real-time uploading through the interoperation of the clinic system with the module based on the Open API architecture An authentic physician can use this system to share and exchange a patient's IPS, in order to provide international references Through the treatment of different cases, drug treatments, and the exchange of patient treatment results, the disease spread can be controlled and treatment methods can be funded From the establishment of the infectious disease case-tracking module, and according to the location information of the IPS, we can track the moving paths of infectious disease cases The location information recorded in the block-chain is for all users to check the location information of different cases The case-tracking module is established for CDC members to track cases and prevent the spread of a disease Based on this module, CDC members can identify the moving paths of the cases and design a case-tracking plan CONCLUSIONS: This study has created an IPS of infectious diseases for physicians to access when treating COVID-19 patients We have also established secure block-chain architecture for the protection of IPS and have completed the application of the moving path tracking of patients The results of this research can help health authorities to respond quickly to the transmission and spread of any unknown disease and provide a good system for information retrieval on disease transmission Another benefit of this system is that it can help public health researchers to form a study trial and analyze data from different countries One of the effective means of fighting an unknown virus could be by means of a common forum to facilitate the mutual sharing of experiences, best practices, therapies for patients, possible useful medications and outcomes from clinical interventions being trailed in various countries in a secure, trustworthy manner The system that is suggested by our study can become an effective tool for facilitating global collaboration, cooperation and collective evidence-based efforts to address the unprecedented situation created by COVID-19","Lee, H.

In the absence of vaccines and antivirals, several behavioural change and policy initiatives, such as physical distancing, have been implemented to control the spread of the coronavirus. Social media data can reveal public perceptions toward how governments and health agencies across the globe are handling the pandemic, as well as the impact of the disease on people regardless of their geographic locations in line with various factors that hinder or facilitate the efforts to control the spread of the pandemic globally. OBJECTIVE: This paper aims to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on people globally using social media data. METHODS: We apply natural language processing (NLP) and thematic analysis to understand public opinions, experiences, and issues with respect to the COVID-19 pandemic using social media data. First, we collect over 47 million COVID-19-related comments from Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, and three online discussion forums. Second, we perform data preprocessing which involves applying NLP techniques to clean and prepare the data for automated keyphrase extraction. Third, we apply NLP approach to extract meaningful keyphrases from over 1 million randomly-selected comments, as well as compute sentiment scores for each keyphrase and assign sentiment polarity (i.e., positive, negative, or neutral) based on the scores using lexicon-based technique. Fourth, we grouped related negative and positive keyphrases into categories or broad themes. RESULTS: A total of 34 negative themes emerged, out of which 15 are health-related issues, psychosocial issues, and social issues related to the COVID-19 pandemic from the public perspective. Some of the health-related issues are increased mortality, health concerns, struggling health systems, and fitness issues; while some of the psychosocial issues include frustrations due to life disruptions, panic shopping, and expression of fear. Social issues include harassment, domestic violence, and wrong societal attitude. In addition, 20 positive themes emerged from our results. Some of the positive themes include public awareness, encouragement, gratitude, cleaner environment, online learning, charity, spiritual support, and innovative research. CONCLUSIONS: We uncover various negative and positive themes representing public perceptions toward the COVID-19 pandemic and recommend interventions that can help address the health, psychosocial, and social issues based on the positive themes and other research evidence. These interventions will help governments, health professionals and agencies, institutions, and individuals in their efforts to curb the spread of COVID-19 and minimize its impact, as well as in reacting to any future pandemics.","Oyebode, Oladapo; Ndulue, Chinenye; Adib, Ashfaq; Mulchandani, Dinesh; Suruliraj, Banuchitra; Orji, Fidelia Anulika; Chambers, Christine; Meier, Sandra; Orji, Rita",,,159
264326,Late Breaking Abstract - Atypical clinical and radiological presentation of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the elderly,2020,"Reversible solvent-triggered single-crystal-to-single-crystal (SCSC) transformations are observed between two copper(II) azamacrocyclic complexes: [Cu(C16H38N6)(H2O)2](C12H6O4) (1) and [Cu(C16H38N6)(C12H6O4)] (2). Complex (1) was prepared via self-assembly of a copper(II) azamacrocyclic complex containing butyl pendant groups, [Cu(C16H38N6)(ClO4)2], with 2,7-naphthalenedicarboxylic acid. When monomeric compound (1) was immersed in CH3OH, coordination polymer (2) was obtained, indicating a solvent-triggered SCSC transformation. Furthermore, when (2) was immersed in water, an reverse SCSC transformation from (2) to (1) occurred. Complex (1) presents a 3D supramolecular structure formed via intermolecular hydrogen-bonding interactions, whereas complex (2) features a 1D zigzag coordination polymer. The reversible SCSC transformation of (1) and (2) was characterized using single-crystal X-ray diffraction and in situ powder X-ray diffraction techniques. Despite its poor porosity, complex (2) displayed interesting CO2 adsorption behaviour under CO2 gas.","Shin, Jong Won; Jeong, Ah Rim; Kim, Younghak; Kim, Dae Woong; Lee, Sang Geul; Lee, Hyosun; Moon, Dohyun",Acta Crystallogr B Struct Sci Cryst Eng Mater,,159

Wabah yang bermula dari Wuhan, Tiongkok ini menyebar dengan cepat dan menginfeksi hampir semua Negara di dunia.Sejalan dengan data nasional, data pada Pemprov NTB juga menujukkan grafik lonjakan kasus yang signifikan, sejak diumumkannya kasus COVID-19 untuk pertama kali pada akhir Maret lalu. Bahkan NTB masuk dalam daerah yang digolongkan sebagai Zona Merah penyebaran COVID-19. Mencegah meluasnya penyebaran virus ini, Pemprov NTB melakukan beberapa langkah sesuai dengan arahan pemerintah pusat, mengeluarkan kebijakan pembatasan kegiatan masyarakat untuk belajar, bekerja dan beribadah dari rumah (Work From Home) dalam upaya memutus mata rantai menyebaran. Disisi lain, keadaan ini akan mendorong turunnya permintaan secara drastis, kegiatan produksi pun ikut terhambat. Saat ini COVID-19 bukan hanya menjadi ancaman bagi kesehatan manusia, tetapi juga sudah mulai mempengaruhi fundamental perekonomian NTB. Hal ini bisa dilihat dari terpukulnya beberapa sektor yang menjadi tumpuan ekonomi NTB seperti industri pariwisata, pertambangan dan sektor lainnya. Bahkan ekonom menyebutkan perekonomian NTB akan terkoreksi pada angka 3-4 persen. Terdapat 3 skenario perekonomian yang akan dihadapi NTB ditengah situasi Pandemi ini, yaitu tren pertumbuhan jangka panjang yang rendah, rebound pertumbuhan yang kuat, dan penurunan berkepanjangan tanpa pemulihan ekonomi. Pemprov NTB saat ini memiliki dua fokus utama untuk terhindar dari skenario ekonomi terburuk. Fokus dalam penanganan medis dan� fokus menangani dampak negatif COVID-19 pada ekonomi. Beberapa langkah yang dilakukan adalah memangkas belanja yang bukan prioritas, realokasi anggaran, menjaga daya beli masyarakat dan mewujudkan stimulus-stimulus ekonomi di daerah yang tepat sasaran.","Maryanti, Sri; Netrawati, I Gunsti Ayu Oka; Nuada, I Wayan",Media Bina Ilmiah,,159

270702,Improving the Understanding of the Immunopathogenesis of Lymphopenia as a Correlate of SARS-CoV-2 Infection Risk and Disease Progression in African Patients: Protocol for a Cross-sectional Study,2021,"BACKGROUND: Patients diagnosed with the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) who develop severe symptoms need to be determined in advance so that appropriate treatment strategies are in place. METHODS: To determine the clinic features of patients diagnosed definitely with COVID-19 and evaluate risk factors for severe outcome, the medical records of hospitalized patients were reviewed retrospectively by us and data were compiled. Laboratory data from 90 cases were analyzed, and COVID-19 patients were classified into two groups (severe and non-severe) based on the severity. RESULTS: Severe COVID-19 cases on admission had higher leukocyte and neutrophil counts, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), D-dimer, fibrinogen, C-reactive protein levels, and lower lymphocyte counts compared with those of non-severe cases (p < 0.05). The area under the curve (AUC) for leukocyte counts, neutrophil counts, and levels of C-reactive protein was 0.778, 0.831, and 0.800, respectively. The thresholds were 7.70 × 109 /L for leukocyte counts, 5.93 × 109/L for neutrophil counts, and 75.07 mg/L for C-reactive protein, respectively. Logistic regression analyses indicated that higher white blood cell (WBC) counts (OR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.05-1.71), neutrophil counts (OR, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.06-1.73), and C-reactive protein levels (OR, 1.02; 95% CI, 1.0-1.04) were several predictive factors for severe outcome. Severe COVID-19 patients had a reduction in WBC counts, D-dimer, C-reactive protein, and fibrinogen upon discharge from hospital, while lymphocyte counts increased (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Counts of WBC, neutrophil, and lymphocyte, NLR, and levels of C-reactive protein, D-dimer, and fibrinogen are helpful for prediction of the deterioration trend in patients diagnosed with COVID-19.","Shi, Shaorui; Nie, Bin; Chen, Xinzu; Cai, Qiang; Lin, Chunxin; Zhao, Guangda; Zhang, Xingying",J Clin Lab Anal,,159

The goals were diagnosis and treatment of patients with COVID-19 while protecting patients and staff from infection and ensuring operational continuity and treatment of patients with non-COVID. Options considered included adaptation of existing wards, building a tented facility and converting a non-medical structure. The option chosen was a non-medical structure converted to a hospitalisation facility suited for COVID-19 with appropriate logistic and organisational adaptations. Operational principles included patient isolation, unidirectional workflow from clean to contaminated zones and minimising direct contact between patients and caregivers using personal protection equipment (PPE) and a multimodal telemedicine system. The ED was modified to enable triage and treatment of patients with COVID-19 while maintaining a COVID-19-free environment in the main campus.

By shifting to distance education, we created features that can be easily implemented and combined with any physics-type course at a university level. Thereby, we incidentally made introductory physics sustainably accessible to students having difficulties visiting the university. Besides our experiences gained on blended learning methods, we provide a guide to online exercises, microlearning videos, and e-assessments, including exams realized in a virtual setting via the university's Moodle. Since the course is attended annually by more than 800 students enrolled in at least twelve bachelor degree engineering and all STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) fields, our reformations greatly impact the student's learning style. The teaching concepts presented here are supported by results from the Force Concept Inventory, student feedback, and exam results. The Force Concept Inventory shows that our online teaching did not negatively affect the student's learning process compared with a traditional face-to-face lecture. Student's feedback shows that the new format and material being available online are received very well. Finally, the exam results show that virtual exams conducted in a remote setting can be designed to minimize cheating possibilities. In addition, the test was able to yield a similar distribution of points as in the previous traditional ones.","Netzer, Ch'e; Mittelstadt, Alexander",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.01385v1.pdf,159

279113,"Safety, tolerability, and outcomes of losartan use in patients hospitalized with SARS-CoV-2 infection: A feasibility study",2020,"The rapid development of vaccines against COVID-19 represents a huge achievement, and offers hope of ending the global pandemic. At least three COVID-19 vaccines have been approved or are about to be approved for distribution in many countries. However, with very limited initial availability, only a minority of the population will be able to receive vaccines this winter. Urgent decisions will have to be made about who should receive priority for access. Current policy in the UK appears to take the view that those who are most vulnerable to COVID-19 should get the vaccine first. While this is intuitively attractive, we argue that there are other possible values and criteria that need to be considered. These include both intrinsic and instrumental values. The former are numbers of lives saved, years of life saved, quality of the lives saved, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and possibly others including age. Instrumental values include protecting healthcare systems and other broader societal interests, which might require prioritizing key worker status and having dependants. The challenge from an ethical point of view is to strike the right balance among these values. It also depends on effectiveness of different vaccines on different population groups and on modelling around cost-effectiveness of different strategies. It is a mistake to simply assume that prioritizing the most vulnerable is the best strategy. Although that could end up being the best approach, whether it is or not requires careful ethical and empirical analysis.","Giubilini, Alberto; Savulescu, Julian; Wilkinson, Dominic",Bioethics,,159

Afterwards, COVID-19 outbreak was declared as a Public Health Emer-gency of International Concern by the World Health Organization (WHO). Now, around two and a half million people are suffering and several thousand are dead worldwide due to the highly infectious and deadly nature of the virus. Unfortunately, no standard medicine or vaccine is available to treat the dis-ease. The major clinical symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, chills, cough, fatigue, respiratory symptoms, diarrhoea, and shortness of breath. Clinical symptom-based Indian traditional medicinal practices like Ayurveda and Siddha could be beneficial to treat and prevent the infection. Indian origin traditional medicinal plant Neem (Azadirachta indica) has been reported to have antiviral potential against bovine herpes virus type-1, poliovirus type 1, duck plague virus, dengue virus type-2, newcastle disease virus, infectious bursal disease virus, avian influenza virus, and group B coxsackievirus. Neem is widely used as Ayurvedic medicine to treat fever, cough, asthma, and diarrhoea, which are also reported as the common clinical symptoms of COVID-19. Neem is reported to enhance both humoral and cell-mediated immune response dur-ing viral infection. Multidimensional antiviral therapeutic potentials of Neem insist on hypothesizing its probable application to control COVID-19 along with modern medicinal practices.

METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed data in the China Lung Transplantation Registration from January 23, 2020, to March 23, 2020 (2020 cohort), compared with the same period in 2019 (2019 cohort). Pre- and post-lung transplantation management strategies, including measures aiming to prevent severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection, were applied to all recipients, including 5 post-Coronavirus Disease 2019 transplants during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 pandemic period in China. RESULTS: Twenty-eight lung transplant procedures were performed, including lung transplant for 5 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome due to Coronavirus Disease 2019-related pulmonary fibrosis. Compared with the 2019 cohort, more patients with urgent conditions received transplantation in 2020, with a shorter pre-lung transplant admission time and early mobilization post-lung transplant. A large proportion (60%) of lung donations were transported on high-speed trains and commercial flights or highways and commercial flights. Grafts in the preservation containers were handed over to the receiving staff at the airport for 40% (10/25) of donations, which reduced the unnecessary quarantine of transporting staff entering the city. Listed candidates were urgently transferred to other qualified centers in 17.9% of cases (5/28), which reduced the risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 exposure in Coronavirus Disease 2019-designated hospitals. The 90-day survival of the transplant recipients in 2020 was 85.7%, including 3 of 5 recipients (60%) who had critically severe Coronavirus Disease 2019. CONCLUSIONS: Lung transplant and donation amid Coronavirus Disease 2019 can be performed safely with coordinated efforts on medical resource sharing and medical staff protection based on stratification of the infection risk. Outcomes were not compromised during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 outbreak. Lung transplantion can be regarded as salvage therapy for critical patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 with a confirmed positive turned negative virology status.","Wu, Bo; Huang, Man; Jiao, Guohui; Hu, Chunxiao; Yang, Yi; Jingyu, Chen",J. thorac. cardiovasc. sur,,159

Information regarding redeployment, fellow restriction in endoscopy, outpatient clinics and inpatient consults, impact on educational activities, and available wellness resources was obtained. Fellows' level of agreement with adjustments to clinical duties was also assessed. RESULTS: One hundred and seventy-seven Gastroenterology fellows responded, and 29.4% were redeployed to non-GI services during the pandemic. COVID-19 impacted all aspects of GI fellowship training in the USA (endoscopy, outpatient clinics, inpatient consults, educational activities). Fellows' level of agreement in changes to various aspects of fellowship varied. 72.5% of respondents reported that their programs provided them with increased wellness resources to cope with the additional stress during the pandemic. For respondents with children, 17.6% reported no support with childcare. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted GI fellowship training in the USA in multiple domains, including gastrointestinal endoscopy, inpatient consults, outpatient clinics, and educational conferences. Our study highlights the importance of considering and incorporating fellows' viewpoints, as changes are made in response to the ongoing pandemic.","Clarke, Kofi; Bilal, Mohammad; Sánchez-Luna, Sergio A; Dalessio, Shannon; Maranki, Jennifer L; Siddique, Shazia Mehmood",Dig. dis. sci,,159
282644,Thrombosis and antiphospholipid antibodies in patients with SARS-COV-2 infection (COVID-19),2020,"With the advances in health information technology and the need for increased access to specialized health care, the advent of telemedicine was designed to bring care to individuals at a distance. Telemedicine decreases barriers to health care and brings medical specialists to underserved areas and populations. We have seen a tremendous increase in the need and utilization of telemedicine during the COVID-19 pandemic due to the lockdowns and social distancing efforts. Virtual care continues to be extended to patients to maintain their health care needs when in-person clinic appointments are not feasible or ideal such as seen during a pandemic. Telemedicine is an additional tool that has proven vital to our healthcare system. To provide optimal care, a strong technological infrastructure must be in place. Once in practice, positive outcomes have been noted for patients and healthcare providers as diagnosis, treatment, and appropriate triage can be made virtually and at the patients' convenience. To ensure high-quality care is provided through the Veterans Affairs teledermatology consultation service, we investigated the concordance of teledermatology diagnoses with clinical examination findings through a retrospective chart review covering a one-year time period. Our study found a concordance of 75.3% between the teledermatology diagnoses and the in-person clinical diagnoses. The main limitation we found to virtual examination is the inability to perform total body skin examinations. We found that 60.2% of patients had additional diagnoses when examined in person, with 8.4% of patients having an additional malignant diagnosis. These findings highlight the need for in-person examinations when feasible to ensure that no other diagnoses go undiscovered if not captured on the submitted images for teledermatology consultation. Despite the limitations posed by photographic examination, teledermatology can be used as a reliable method for diagnosis when a conventional in-person examination is not readily available or ideal, such as during a pandemic, and can serve as a powerful triaging tool.","Gerhardt, C.

283327,Severity of Respiratory Infections With Seasonal Coronavirus Is Associated With Viral and Bacterial Coinfections,2021,"AIM: The object of this work was to study how National Health Service hospitals in England and Wales aimed to maintain effective and safe colorectal cancer (CRC) services during the first peak of the COVID-19 pandemic (April 2020). METHOD: A national survey was performed among all 148 hospitals providing CRC services. Information was collected about changes in referrals, diagnostic, staging and therapeutic procedures, as well as whether there was access to a 'cold site' (a hospital facility free of COVID-19). Clinicians in each hospital were also asked to give the 'single most important lesson learned' about keeping services safe and effective. RESULTS: Full responses were received from 123 (83%) hospitals, and information about 'cold sites' was available for 146 (99%). Eighty hospitals (54%) had access to a 'cold site' and this was increased in regions with higher COVID-19 infection rates (p <0.001). Of the 123 responding hospitals, 105 (85%) indicated that referrals of patients with suspected CRC had dropped by at least 30%, and 69 (56%) indicated that treatment plans were altered in at least 50% of CRC patients. However, 'cold site' availability protected the capacity for diagnostic colonoscopy (p = 0.013) and CRC resection (p = 0.010). Many 'lessons learned' highlighted the importance of adequate structural service organization, often mentioning 'cold sites' and regional coordination as examples, good communication and triage of patients based on clinical urgency. CONCLUSION: Access to 'cold sites', as well as regional coordination, clear communication and strong leadership, were found to be pivotal in maintaining capacity for diagnosis and treatment of CRC during the COVID-19 surge.","Boyle, Jemma M; Kuryba, Angela; Blake, Helen A; Aggarwal, Ajay; van der Meulen, Jan; Walker, Kate; Braun, Michael; Fearnhead, Nicola",Colorectal dis,,159

304400,Rheumatic diseases during pregnancy and SARS-CoV-2: An appeal for medication adherence,2020,"Binding of calcium ion to calcium-binding proteins (CBP) triggers a large number of biological processes in a cell. CBP are known to play important roles in various diseases, such as cancer, alzheimer, and neuronal problems. However, the calculation of the binding affinity of calcium ion to CBP still possesses a significant challenge to the computational investigators. One of the main reasons for this difficulty is the polarization of CBP due to the binding of calcium. In the current work, we have used the implicit polarization method of Leontyev et al. (PCCP, 13.7 (2011): 2613-2626) to calculate the binding free energy of calcium ion binding to calmodulin, an important CBP. We have used the widely used MM-PBSA method to find a good protocol of calculation with implicit polarization. We have also optimized the best value of the calcium radius to match the experimental results. Our results show incorporation of polarization improves the agreement between the calculated and experimental results, although still, some discrepancy remains. On the whole, this work shows implicit polarization when combined with the MM-PBSA method can give results better than calculation without any polarization, and further improvement is necessary to get a quantitative match with experiments.

Here, we analyzed the clinical characteristics of the first 17 reported cases of death due to COVID-19 pneumonia in Wuhan, China. Demographics, initial symptoms, complications, chest computerized tomography (CT) images, treatments, and prognoses were collected and analyzed from the National Health Committee of China data. The first 17 reported deaths from COVID-19 were predominately in older men; 82.35% of patients were older than 65 years, and 76.47% were males. The most common initial symptoms were fever or fatigue (14 cases, 82.35%), respiratory symptoms, such as cough (12 cases, 70.59%), and neurological symptoms, such as headache (3 cases, 17.65%). The most common finding of chest CT was viral pneumonia (5 cases, 29.41%). Anti-infectives (11 cases, 64.71%) and mechanical ventilation (9 cases, 52.94%) were commonly used for treatment. Most of the patients (16 cases, 94.12%) died of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

With the further development of the epidemic, the proportion of clusters has increased. METHODS: In our study, we collected information on COVID-19 clusters in Qingdao City. The epidemiological characteristics and clinical manifestations were analyzed. RESULTS: Eleven clusters of COVID-19 were reported in Qingdao City between January 29, and February 23, 2020, involving 44 confirmed cases, which accounted for 73.33% of all confirmed cases. From January 19 to February 2, 2020, the cases mainly concentrated in the district that had many designated hospitals. Patients aged 20-59 y old accounted for the largest proportion (68.18%) of cases; the male-to-female sex ratio was 0.52:1. Three cases were infected from exposure to confirmed cases. The average incubation period was 6.28 d. The median number of cases per cluster was 4, and the median duration time was 6 d. The median cumulative number of exposed persons was 53. CONCLUSION: More attention should be paid to the epidemic of clusters in prevention and control of COVID-19. In addition to isolating patients, it is essential to track, screen, and isolate those who have come in close contact with patients. Self-isolation is the key especially for healthy people in the epidemic area.","Jia, Jing; Hu, Xiaowen; Yang, Feng; Song, Xin; Dong, Liyan; Zhang, Jingfei; Jiang, Fachun; Gao, Ruqin",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,,159
308817,Seropositivity and risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection in staff working in care homes during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"BACKGROUND: Alcohol harms are rising globally, and alcohol policies, where they exist, are weak or under-developed. Limited progress has been made since the formulation of the World Health Organisation (WHO) Global Strategy in 2010. WHO is seeking to accelerate progress in implementing international efforts to reduce the harmful use of alcohol. The threat to global health posed by tobacco is well understood by policy communities and populations globally; by contrast alcohol is much less so, despite available evidence. THE COMPETITION FOR EPISTEMIC AUTHORITY: Global alcohol corporations have sought to become trusted sources of advice for policy makers and consumers, while continuing to grow their markets. Evidence-informed public health messaging faces formidable competition from transnational corporations as the worlds of corporate and political communications, social and mainstream media become increasingly linked, presenting new opportunities for corporate actors to shape global health governance. Alcohol messaging that uses means of persuasion tied to industry agendas does not tell a clear story about commercial determinants of health, and does not contribute to health improvement. On the contrary, the basic tenets of an evidence-informed population-based approach are denied and the policy measures supported by high quality evidence are being opposed, because they are inimical to commercial interests. A David and Goliath metaphor for this state of affairs, which seems to fit at first glance, may unwittingly reinforce the status quo. CONCLUSION: Public opinion on alcohol and policy issues varies across time and place and can be influenced by dedicated public health interventions. Alcohol marketing dominates people's thinking about alcohol because we currently allow this to happen. Greater ambition is needed in developing countermarketing and other interventions to promote evidence-informed ideas with the public. Alcohol policies need to be further developed, and implemented more widely, in order to arrest the growing burden of alcohol harms across the world.","Madden, Mary; McCambridge, Jim",Global Health,,159

Various comorbidities are associated with worse disease prognosis. Understanding the impact of ethnicity on the disease outcome is an important public health issue but data from our region is lacking. Aim: We aim to identify comorbidities among patients hospitalized for COVID-19 that are associated with inhospital death. Also, to assess if ethnicity is correlated with increased risk of death. Patients and Method. The study is a single-centre, observational study in Shaikh Shakhbout Medical City, Abu Dhabi. Patients admitted with COVID-19, between 1st of March and the end of May, were enrolled. Records were studied for demography, comorbidity, and ethnicity. Ethnicity was divided into Arabs (Gulf, North Africa, and the Levant), South Asia (India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, and Afghanistan), Africans, the Philippines, and others. The study was approved by the Department of Health of Abu Dhabi. Results: 1075 patients (972 males) were enrolled. There were 24 nationalities under 5 ethnicity groups. Mean (average) age was 51 years (20-81). 101 (9.4%) died with deceased patients being significantly older. Death risk was not significantly influenced by sex. Duration of hospitalization among survivors was 6.2 days (0.2-40.4) with older patients and men staying longer (P < 0.01). Comorbidities of diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, chronic renal disease, liver disease, and malignancy were associated with higher risk of mortality univariate, but only liver disease reached statistical significance after adjustment for age. The highest percentage of death was seen in Arab Levant (21.2) followed by the Asian Afghan (18.8); however, differences among ethnicities did not reach statistical significance (P = 0.086). Conclusion: COVID-19 outcome was worse in older people and those with comorbidities. Men and older patients required longer hospitalization.

312307,Emerging Fungal Infections,2021,"The incidence of several respiratory viral infections has been shown to be related to climate. Because humans spend most of their time indoors, measures of indoor climate, rather than outdoor climate, may be better predictors of disease incidence and transmission. Therefore, understanding the relationship between indoor and outdoor climate will help illuminate their influence on the seasonality of diseases caused by respiratory viruses. Indoor-outdoor relationships between temperature and humidity have been documented in temperate regions, but little information is available for tropical regions, where seasonal patterns of respiratory viral diseases differ. We have examined indoor-outdoor correlations of temperature, relative humidity (RH), and absolute humidity (AH) over a 1-year period in each of seven tropical cities. Across all cities, the average monthly indoor temperature was 25 ± 3°C (mean ± standard deviation) with a range of 20-30°C. The average monthly indoor RH was 66 ± 9% with a range of 50-78%, and the average monthly indoor AH was 15 ± 3 g/m3 with a range of 10-23 g/m3 . Indoor AH and RH were linearly correlated with outdoor AH when the air conditioning (AC) was off, suggesting that outdoor AH may be a good proxy of indoor humidity in the absence of AC. All indoor measurements were more strongly correlated with outdoor measurements as distance from the equator increased. Such correlations were weaker during the wet season, especially when AC was in operation. These correlations will provide insight for assessing the seasonality of respiratory viral infections using outdoor climate data, which is more widely available than indoor data, even though transmission of these diseases mainly occurs indoors.","Pan, Jin; Tang, Julian; Caniza, Miguela; Heraud, Jean-Michel; Koay, Evelyn; Lee, Hong Kai; Lee, Chun Kiat; Li, Yuguo; Nava Ruiz, Alejandra; Santillan-Salas, Carlos Francisco; Marr, Linsey C",Indoor air,,159

The objective of this cross‐sectional study in May‐July 2020 was to assess the prevalence of SARS‐CoV‐2 antibodies and virus RNA in schoolchildren, consistent with previous infection by contact tracing.MethodsSchool authorities approached parents for voluntary participation. Interested families were contacted by the study team. A nasal and oropharyngeal swab, a blood sample, and a questionnaire were employed. Primary endpoint was the frequency of SARS‐CoV‐2 real‐time PCR (RT‐PCR) and antibody‐positive children. Antibody positivity was assessed by a highly sensitive first‐line ELISA, and a neutralization assay and two other immunoassays as confirmatory assays.ResultsOf 2069 children (median age 13 years, IQR 10‐15), 2 cases (0.1%) tested positive for SARS‐CoV‐2 RNA and 26 cases (1.3%) tested positive for specific antibodies. SARS‐CoV‐2‐specific antibodies exhibited detectable virus‐neutralizing activity in 92% (24 of 26 samples). Seropositivity was associated with a history of mild clinical symptoms in 14 children (53.8%), while 12 children (46.2%) remained asymptomatic. Among 13 seropositive children being tested concomitantly with their siblings, only one pair of siblings was seropositive. Contact tracing revealed adult family members and school teachers as potential index cases.ConclusionIn schoolchildren, the infection rate with SARS‐CoV‐2 is low and associated with a mild or asymptomatic course of disease. Virus spreading seemed to occur more likely in intergenerational contacts than among siblings in the same household. The presence of neutralizing SARS‐CoV‐2 antibodies in children may reflect protective adaptive immunity.","Szépfalusi, Zsolt Schmidthaler Klara Sieber Justyna Kopanja Sonja Götzinger Florian Schoof Anja Hoz Jakub Willinger Birgit Makristathis Athanasios Weseslindtner Lukas Stiasny Karin Bohle Barbara Krotka Pavla Graf Alexandra Frischer Thomas",Pediatric Allergy and Immunology,,159

This is important to consider as communities plan for health care needs of an aging population and is particularly relevant in the face of Covid-19, as we know severity is exacerbated by underlying health conditions.","Slater, Morgan; Jacklin, Kristen; Sutherland, Roseanne; Jones, Carmen; Blind, Melissa; Warry, Wayne; Valvasori, Meghan; Walker, Jennifer",Can J Aging,,159

Rapid transmission of COVID-19 has caused wide-spread panic. Many established medications have been used to treat the disease symptoms; however, no specific drugs or vaccines have been developed. Organoids derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) may serve as suitable infection models for ex vivo mimicking of the viral life cycle and drug screening. Human iPSC-3D organoids, self-organised tissues with multiple cell environments, have a similar structure and function as real human organs; hence, these organoids allow greater viral infection efficiency, mimic the natural host-virus interactions, and are suitable for long-term experimentation. Here, we suggest the use of a functional human iPSC-organoid that could act as a reliable and feasible ex vivo infection model for investigation of the virus. This approach will provide much needed insight into the underlying molecular dynamics of COVID-19 for the development of novel treatment and prevention strategies.","Zhou, Hang; Liu, Li-Ping; Fang, Mei; Li, Yu-Mei; Zheng, Yun-Wen",Histol Histopathol,,159

Placental examination demonstrated a small for gestational age placenta with extensive intervillous histiocytosis, syncytiotrophoblast karyorrhexis, and diffuse intervillous fibrin deposition. Immunohistochemical staining demonstrated infection of the syncytiotrophoblasts by SARS-CoV-2 inversely related to the presence of intervillous histiocytes and fibrin deposition.

In these recommendations, away rotations are discouraged, and all programs are compelled to commit to virtual interviews. Unlike employers and applicants in other industries, orthopaedic residency/fellowship programs and candidates seeking those positions have not routinely conducted virtual interviews. Without in-person interviews, applicants may perceive a limited ability to demonstrate their qualifications, judge program culture, and gauge ultimate program compatibility. Likewise, programs may perceive the inability to evaluate a candidate in real time, physically show program strengths, and ultimately judge applicant compatibility. Careful preparation and execution of a virtual interview can overcome these perceived limitations, whereas benefits, such as decreased cost for both programs and applicants, can make virtual interviews appealing. The purpose of this review was to help define a virtual interview, illustrate the benefits, and offer tips to both programs and applicants on how to prepare and perform optimally on an interview day.","Hagedorn, John C; Chen, Jie; Weiss, William M; Fredrickson, Saul W; Faillace, John J",J.

The coronavirus pandemic is evolving very rapidly and represents a risk for health care workers and society in general. Moreover, pandemic has tested the limits of health systems by raising questions about forms of prevention, management of infections with conventional therapies and the use of diagnostic tools. In this article we discussed the possible role of the nanostructured-graphene based materials as aid tools for preventing the spread and infection of SARS-CoV-2. In this regard, nanotechnology could take part in the fight against the spread of future diseases caused by deadly viruses. However, its use should be well founded in terms of biocompatibility.

The increasing global health and economic burden of SARS-CoV-2 has necessitated urgent investigations into the pathogenesis of disease and development of therapeutic and vaccination regimens. Human trials of vaccine and antiviral candidates have been undertaken, but basic pathogenetic studies are still required to inform these trials. Gaps in understanding of cellular infection by, and immunity to, SARS-CoV-2 mean additional models are required to assist in improved design of these therapeutics. Human organoids are three-dimensional models that contain multiple cell types and mimic human organs in ex vivo culture conditions. The SARS-CoV-2 virus has been implicated in causing not only respiratory injury but also injury to other organs such as the brain, liver and kidneys. Consequently, a variety of different organoid models have been employed to investigate the pathogenic mechanisms of disease due to SARS-CoV-2. Data on these models have not been systematically assembled. In this review, we highlight key findings from studies that have utilised different human organoid types to investigate the expression of SARS-CoV-2 receptors, permissiveness, immune response, dysregulation of cellular functions, and potential antiviral therapeutics.","Egilmezer, Ece; Rawlinson, William D",Rev. med. virol,,159

Focusing on various surveys, feminized sectors such as agriculture, garments have been hardest hit by the pandemic. Female workers have been rapidly lost their means to earn income and confined to homes. Beyond lost jobs and reduced working hours, the pandemic has also increased the time poverty of women. While pre-pandemic unpaid work burdens are well established as strong, the study indicates that burdens are escalated after-pandemic. Women balanced intensified unpaid care and domestic works simultaneously or make a tradeoff, without or minimal help from men.

However, inconsistency and ambiguity in instructions show a lack of definitive knowledge on best spray use techniques. In this study, we have identified a new usage strategy for nasal sprays available over-the-counter, that registers an average 8-fold improvement in topical delivery of drugs at diseased sites, when compared to prevalent spray techniques. The protocol involves re-orienting the spray axis to harness inertial motion of particulates and has been developed using computational fluid dynamics simulations of respiratory airflow and droplet transport in medical imaging-based digital models. Simulated dose in representative models is validated through in vitro spray measurements in 3D-printed anatomic replicas using the gamma scintigraphy technique. This work breaks new ground in proposing an alternative user-friendly strategy that can significantly enhance topical delivery inside human nose. While these findings can eventually translate into personalized spray usage instructions and hence merit a change in nasal standard-of-care, this study also demonstrates how relatively simple engineering analysis tools can revolutionize everyday healthcare.","Basu, Saikat; Holbrook, Landon T; Kudlaty, Kathryn; Fasanmade, Olulade; Wu, Jihong; Burke, Alyssa; Langworthy, Benjamin; Farzal, Zainab; Mamdani, Mohammed; Bennett, William D; Fine, Jason; Senior, Brent A; Zanation, Adam M; Ebert, Charles S; Jr.,; Kimple, Adam J; Thorp, Brian D; Frank-Ito, Dennis O; Garcia, Guilherme JM; Kimbell, Julia S",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.11960v5.pdf,159

However, such methods demand considerable manual effort from researchers and may be overly focused and narrowed to certain online groups. In this work, we propose a complete solution to accelerate qualitative analysis of problematic online speech -- with a specific focus on opinions emerging from online communities -- by leveraging machine learning algorithms. First, we employ qualitative methods of deep observation for understanding problematic online speech. This initial qualitative study constructs an ontology of problematic speech, which contains social media postings annotated with their underlying opinions. The qualitative study also dynamically constructs the set of opinions, simultaneous with labeling the postings. Next, we collect a large dataset from three online social media platforms (Facebook, Twitter and Youtube) using keywords. Finally, we introduce an iterative data exploration procedure to augment the dataset. It alternates between a data sampler, which balances exploration and exploitation of unlabeled data, the automatic labeling of the sampled data, the manual inspection by the qualitative mapping team and, finally, the retraining of the automatic opinion classifier. We present both qualitative and quantitative results. First, we present detailed case studies of the dynamics of problematic speech in a far-right Facebook group, exemplifying its mutation from conservative to extreme. Next, we show that our method successfully learns from the initial qualitatively labeled and narrowly focused dataset, and constructs a larger dataset. Using the latter, we examine the dynamics of opinion emergence and co-occurrence, and we hint at some of the pathways through which extreme opinions creep into the mainstream online discourse.","Kong, Quyu; Booth, Emily; Bailo, Francesco; Johns, Amelia; Rizoiu, Marian-Andrei",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.00302v1.pdf,159

The aim of this paper is to estimate setting-specific vaccination thresholds for SARS-CoV-2 to prevent sustained community transmission using classical principles of airborne contagion modeling. We calculated the airborne infection risk in three settings, a classroom, prison cell block, and restaurant, at typical ventilation rates, and then the expected number of infections resulting from this risk at varying levels of occupant susceptibility to infection. ResultsWe estimate the vaccination threshold for control of SARS-CoV-2 to range from a low of 40% for a mechanically ventilation classroom to a high of 85% for a naturally ventilated restaurant. ConclusionsIf vaccination rates are limited to a theoretical minimum of approximately two-thirds of the population, enhanced ventilation above minimum standards for acceptable air quality is needed to reduce the frequency and severity of SARS-CoV-2 superspreading events in high-risk indoor environments.","Mikszewski, Alex; Stabile, Luca; Buonanno, Giorgio; Morawska, Lidia",,,159
341401,Vacuna-gate escalates in Peru,2021,"The inability of patients with CVID to mount specific antibody responses to pathogens has raised concerns on the risk and severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection, but there might be a role for protective T cells in these patients. SARS-CoV-2 reactive T cells have been reported for SARS-CoV-2 unexposed healthy individuals. Until now, there is no data on T cell immunity to SARS-CoV-2 infection in CVID. This study aimed to evaluate reactive T cells to human endemic corona viruses (HCoV) and to study pre-existing SARS-CoV-2 reactive T cells in unexposed CVID patients. We evaluated SARS-CoV-2- and HCoV-229E and -OC43 reactive T cells in response to seven peptide pools, including spike and nucleocapsid (NCAP) proteins, in 11 unexposed CVID, 12 unexposed and 11 post COVID-19 healthy controls (HC). We further characterized reactive T cells by IFNÎ³, TNF&#945; and IL-2 profiles. SARS-CoV-2 spike-reactive CD4+ T cells were detected in 7 of 11 unexposed CVID patients, albeit with fewer multifunctional (IFNÎ³/TNF&#945;/IL-2) cells than unexposed HC. CVID patients had no SARS-CoV-2 NCAP reactive CD4+ T cells and less reactive CD8+ cells compared to unexposed HC. We observed a correlation between T cell reactivity against spike of SARS-CoV-2 and HCoVs in unexposed, but not post COVID-19 HC, suggesting cross-reactivity. T cell responses in post COVID-19 HC could be distinguished from unexposed HC by higher frequencies of triple-positive NCAP reactive CD4+ T cells. Taken together, SARS-CoV-2 reactive T cells are detectable in unexposed CVID patients albeit with lower recognition frequencies and polyfunctional potential. Frequencies of triple-functional reactive CD4+ cells might provide a marker to distinguish HCoV cross-reactive from SARS-CoV-2 specific T cell responses. Our data provides evidence, that anti-viral T cell immunity is not relevantly impaired in most CVID patients.","Steiner, Sophie; Sotzny, Franziska; Bauer, Sandra; Na, Il-Kang; Schmueck-Henneresse, Michael; Corman, Victor M; Schwarz, Tatjana; Drosten, Christian; Wendering, Désirée J; Behrends, Uta; Volk, Hans-Dieter; Scheibenbogen, Carmen; Hanitsch, Leif G",Front Immunol,,159

Multiple therapeutic options have been explored, including corticosteroids. Preliminary results of corticosteroids in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are encouraging; however, the role of corticosteroids remains controversial. RESEARCH QUESTION: What is the impact of corticosteroids in mortality, ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, and viral shedding in COVID-19 patients? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of literature on corticosteroids and COVID-19 in major databases (PubMed, MEDLINE, and EMBASE) of published literature through July 22, 2020, that report outcomes of interest in COVID-19 patients receiving corticosteroids with a comparative group. RESULTS: A total of 73 studies with 21,350 COVID-19 patients were identified. Corticosteroid use was reported widely in mechanically ventilated patients (35.3%), ICU patients (51.3%), and severe COVID-19 patients (40%). Corticosteroids showed mortality benefit in severelly ill COVID-19 patients (OR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.51-0.83; P = .0006); however, no beneficial or harmful effects were noted among high-dose or low-dose corticosteroid regimens. Emerging evidence shows that low-dose corticosteroids do not have a significant impact in the duration of SARS-CoV-2 viral shedding. The analysis was limited by highly heterogeneous literature for high-dose and low-dose corticosteroids regimens. INTERPRETATION: Our results showed evidence of mortality benefit in severely ill COVID-19 patients treated with corticosteroids. Corticosteroids are used widely in COVID-19 patients worldwide, and a rapidly developing global pandemic warrants further high-quality clinical trials to define the most beneficial timing and dosing for corticosteroids.","Cano, Edison J; Fuentes, Xavier Fonseca; Campioli, Cristina Corsini; O039,; Horo, John C; Saleh, Omar Abu; Odeyemi, Yewande; Yadav, Hemang; Temesgen, Zelalem",Chest,,159

We, therefore, aim to assess the influence of COVID-19 infection on IVF treatments. DESIGN: An observational study. SETTING: A tertiary, university-affiliated medical center. PATIENTS AND METHODS: All consecutive couples undergoing ovarian stimulation (OS) for IVF, before and after recovering from COVID-19 infection, and reached the ovum pick-up (OPU) stage. The stimulation characteristics and embryological variables of couples undergoing IVF treatments after recovering from COVID-19 infection were assessed and compared to their IVF cycles prior to COVID-19 infection. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Stimulation characteristics and embryological variables. RESULTS: Nine couples (seven with the female partner infection and two with the male partner) resumed IVF treatment 8-92 d after recovering from the COVID-19 infection (negative polymerase chain reaction [PCR]). No in-between cycles differences were observed in OS and embryological variables between the cycles before and after recovering from the COVID-19 infection, except for a significantly lower proportion of top-quality embryos. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 infection did not affect patients' performance or ovarian reserve in their immediate subsequent IVF cycle, except for a reduced proportion of top-quality embryos (TQEs). We therefore suggest, to postpone IVF treatment for a least 3 months (duration of folliculogenesis and spermatogenesis) after recovering from COVID-19 infection, aiming to recruit healthy gametes that were not exposed to COVID-19 infection during their development.","Orvieto, Raoul; Segev-Zahav, Aliza; Aizer, Adva",Gynecol Endocrinol,,159
352278,Management of pregnancy-related hypertensive disorders in patients infected with SARS CoV-2: pharmacological and clinical issues,2020,"Its semi-allogeneic nature renders the conceptus vulnerable to attack by the maternal immune system. Several protective mechanisms operate during gestation to correct the harmful effects of anti-fetal immunity and to support a healthy pregnancy outcome. Pregnancy is characterized by gross alterations in endocrine functions. Progesterone is indispensable for pregnancy and humans, and it affects immune functions both directly and via mediators. The progesterone-induced mediator - PIBF - acts in favor of Th2-type immunity, by increasing Th2 type cytokines production. Except for implantation and parturition, pregnancy is characterized by a Th2-dominant cytokine pattern. Progesterone and the orally-administered progestogen dydrogesterone upregulate the production of Th2-type cytokines and suppress the production of Th1 and Th17 cytokine production in vitro. This is particularly relevant to the fact that the Th1-type cytokines TNF-&#945; and IFN-Î³ and the Th17 cytokine IL-17 have embryotoxic and anti-trophoblast activities. These cytokine-modulating effects and the PIBF-inducing capabilities of dydrogesterone may contribute to the demonstrated beneficial effects of dydrogesterone in recurrent spontaneous miscarriage and threatened miscarriage. IL-17 and IL-22 produced by T helper cells are involved in allograft rejection, and therefore could account for the rejection of paternal HLA-C-expressing trophoblast. Th17 cells (producing IL-17 and IL-22) and Th22 cells (producing IL-22) exhibit plasticity and could produce IL-22 and IL-17 in association with Th2-type cytokines or with Th1-type cytokines. IL-17 and IL-22 producing Th cells are not harmful for the conceptus, if they also produce IL-4. Another important protective mechanism is connected with the expansion and action of regulatory T cells, which play a major role in the induction of tolerance both in pregnant women and in tumour-bearing patients. Clonally-expanded Treg cells increase at the feto-maternal interface and in tumour-infiltrating regions. While in cancer patients, clonally-expanded Treg cells are present in peripheral blood, they are scarce in pregnancy blood, suggesting that fetal antigen-specific tolerance is restricted to the foeto-maternal interface. The significance of Treg cells in maintaining a normal materno-foetal interaction is underlined by the fact that miscarriage is characterized by a decreased number of total effector Treg cells, and the number of clonally-expanded effector Treg cells is markedly reduced in preeclampsia. In this review we present an overview of the above mechanisms, attempt to show how they are connected, how they operate during normal gestation and how their failure might lead to pregnancy pathologies.","Piccinni, Marie-Pierre; Raghupathy, Raj; Saito, Shigeru; Szekeres-Bartho, Julia",Front Immunol,,159

Ultimately, the public's response to announcements of lockdowns-defined as restrictions on both local movement or long distance travel-will determine how effective these kinds of interventions are. Here, we evaluate the effects of lockdowns on human mobility and simulate how these changes may affect epidemic spread by analyzing aggregated mobility data from mobile phones. We show that in 2020 following lockdown announcements but prior to their implementation, both local and long distance movement increased in multiple locations, and urban-to-rural migration was observed around the world. To examine how these behavioral responses to lockdown policies may contribute to epidemic spread, we developed a simple agent-based spatial model. Our model shows that this increased movement has the potential to increase seeding of the epidemic in less urban areas, which could undermine the goal of the lockdown in preventing disease spread. Lockdowns play a key role in reducing contacts and controlling outbreaks, but appropriate messaging surrounding their announcement and careful evaluation of changes in mobility are needed to mitigate the possible unintended consequences.","Kishore, Nishant; Kahn, Rebecca; Martinez, Pamela P; De Salazar, Pablo M; Mahmud, Ayesha S; Buckee, Caroline O",Sci Rep,,159

364140,Facing SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic at a COVID-19 Regional Children's Hospital in Italy,2020,"BACKGROUND: The public health strategies for prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection have included closing the national borders and cancelling international flights, which has severely affected free crew changes. This caused prolonged stay on board or at home for seafarers, who should be recognized as 'key' workers regarding their essential role in maintaining the flow of vital goods. OBJECTIVE: Using a general inductive approach, this qualitative study aims to describe how the COVID-19 pandemic reflects on seafarers' well-being. The study focused on obtaining personal experiences from seafarers on board, and seafarers at home, relating to the current world pandemic. METHODS: A convenience sample consisting of 752 seafarers from the international seafarers' population participated in an online study in spring 2020. The questionnaire used included questions relating to basic sociodemographic and work characteristics, and one open question which addressed seafarers' personal experiences. The data obtained was analysed by thematic analysis. RESULTS: The emerged themes included mental, physical, social and economic well-being. Most of the answers of seafarers located on board related to threatened mental, physical and social well-being, while seafarers at home reported mostly on threats to their economic well-being. CONCLUSION: Seafarers' well-being is seriously threatened by preventive measures relating to the COVID-19 pandemic. Results are discussed in relation to earlier findings in the area of occupational stress in seafaring. Overall, the data obtained portrays existing underlying occupational structures in the seafaring sector, which are rendered more visible due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In short, seafarers describe their reality as far away from the concept of 'key' or 'essential' workers.","Sliskovic, Ana",Work,,159

Available data on the vaccine immune response developed by MF patients, and the impact of the treatment with the inhibitor of JAK-STAT signaling ruxolitimib, are still fragmented to support an informed decision for a third dose for this category of subjects. Here, we show that 76% of MF patients develop spike-specific IgG after the second vaccine dose, but the response has a slower kinetic compared to healthy subjects, suggesting a reduced capability of their immune system to promptly react to vaccination. A reduced ACE2/RBD inhibition binding activity of spike-specific antibodies was also observed, especially in ruxolitimib treated patients. Our results contribute to answer the open question on the induction of the antibody responses in MF patients following vaccination with COVID-19 mRNA vaccines, showing a slow kinetic that support the need for a third dose of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines.","Fiorino, Fabio; Sicuranza, Anna; Ciabattini, Annalisa; Santoni, Adele; Pastore, Gabiria; Simoncelli, Martina; Polvere, Jacopo; Galimberti, Sara; Auddino, Stefano; Barate', Claudia; Montagnani, Francesca; Sammartano, Vincenzo; Bocchia, Monica; Medaglini, Donata",,,159

373722,Association of Maternal Perinatal SARS-CoV-2 Infection With Neonatal Outcomes During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Massachusetts,2021,"We and others propose vimentin as a possible cellular target for the treatment of COVID-19. This innovative idea is so recent that it requires further attention and debate. The significant role played by vimentin in virus-induced infection however is well established: (1) vimentin has been reported as a co-receptor and/or attachment site for SARS-CoV; (2) vimentin is involved in viral replication in cells; (3) vimentin plays a fundamental role in both the viral infection and the consequent explosive immune-inflammatory response and (4) a lower vimentin expression is associated with the inhibition of epithelial to mesenchymal transition and fibrosis. Moreover, the absence of vimentin in mice makes them resistant to lung injury. Since vimentin has a twofold role in the disease, not only being involved in the viral infection but also in the associated life-threatening lung inflammation, the use of vimentin-targeted drugs may offer a synergistic advantage as compared with other treatments not targeting vimentin. Consequently, we speculate here that drugs which decrease the expression of vimentin can be used for the treatment of patients with COVID-19 and advise that several Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs be immediately tested in clinical trials against SARS-CoV-2, thus broadening therapeutic options for this type of viral infection.","Li, Zhenlin; Paulin, Denise; Lacolley, Patrick; Coletti, Dario; Agbulut, Onnik",,,159

Constituting important correlates of protection, the determination of virus-neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) is indispensable for convalescent plasma selection, vaccine candidate evaluation, and immunity certificates. In contrast to standard serological ELISAs, plaque reduction neutralization tests (PRNTs) are laborious, time-consuming, expensive, and restricted to specialized laboratories. To replace microscopic counting-based SARS-CoV-2 PRNTs by a novel assay exempt from genetically modified viruses, which are inapplicable in most diagnostics departments, we established a simple, rapid, and automated SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assay employing an in-cell ELISA (icELISA) approach. After optimization of various parameters such as virus-specific antibodies, cell lines, virus doses, and duration of infection, SARS-CoV-2-infected cells became amenable as direct antigen source for quantitative icELISA. Antiviral agents such as human sera containing NAbs or antiviral interferons dose dependently reduced the SARS-CoV-2-specific signal. Applying increased infectious doses, the icELISA-based neutralization test (icNT) was superior to PRNT in discriminating convalescent sera with high from those with intermediate neutralizing capacities. In addition, the icNT was found to be specific, discriminating between SARS-CoV-2-specific NAbs and those raised against other coronaviruses. Altogether, the SARS-CoV-2 icELISA test allows rapid (<48 h in total, read-out in seconds) and automated quantification of virus infection in cell culture to evaluate the efficacy of NAbs and antiviral drugs using reagents and equipment present in most routine diagnostics departments.","Schöler, Lara; Le-Trilling, Vu Thuy Khanh; Eilbrecht, Mareike; Mennerich, Denise; Anastasiou, Olympia E; Krawczyk, Adalbert; Herrmann, Anke; Dittmer, Ulf; Trilling, Mirko",Front Immunol,,159

As such, some providers have adopted the ""COVID intubation box"", a cuboid barrier which which separates the clinician from the airway. While this device has limitations, there is promising evidence on its effectiveness. Aim: To summarize the history, evidence, and limitations of the popular intubation box design. Furthermore, we share our modified design and experiences from airway simulations. Methods: Using our prototyping and validation facilities, our team designed and iteratively improved our device to arrive at a final design. The expert panel, consisting of anesthesiologists, infection control staff, and emergency clinicians, trialed the device using airway simulation mannequins and provided feedback. Results: Our final device features a dome shape, increased height, wider arm port diameter, additional side port for assistants, and drapes to reduce viral escape. Feedback from simulations was overall positive, especially noting that the height and arm port diameter facilitated arm motion within the box. The infection control team preferred the unique dome shape for safe disinfection. Conclusion: Our intubation box overcomes several challenges and criticisms of the popular intubation box.

OBJECTIVES: This observational study compared the prevalence of COVID-19 symptoms, diagnosis and hospitalization in IBD patients with a control population with non-inflammatory bowel disorders. METHODS: This multicentre study, included 2733 outpatients (1397 IBD patients and 1336 controls), from eight major gastrointestinal centres in Lombardy, Italy. Patients were invited to complete a web-based questionnaire regarding demographic, historical and clinical features over the previous 6 weeks. The prevalence of COVID-19 symptoms, diagnosis and hospitalization for COVID-19 was assessed. RESULTS: 1810 patients (64%) responded to the questionnaire (941 IBD patients and 869 controls). IBD patients were significantly younger and of male sex than controls. NSAID use and smoking were more frequent in controls. IBD patients were more likely treated with vitamin-D and vaccinated for influenza. Highly probable COVID-19 on the basis of symptoms and signs was less frequent in the IBD group (3.8% vs 6.3%; OR:0.45, 95%CI:0.28-0.75).

402274,Acute rejection after anti-SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination in a patient who underwent a kidney transplant,2021,"The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has brought immense challenges to the natural and built environment to develop an antivirus-enabled model for reducing potential risks of spreading the virus at varied scales such as buildings, neighborhoods, and cities. Spatial configurations of structures may hinder or assist the spread of viruses in the built environment. In this study, we have hypothesized that suitable air ventilation in historic buildings may enhance the built environment to combat the spreading of infectious viruses. To provide such quantitative shreds of evidence, we have generated and estimated an integrated model to summarize obtained information by considering natural ventilation, wind speed, inflow and outflow, wind direction, and forecasting the associated risks of airborne disease transmission in a historical building (i.e., the Hazzazi House in particular). Intrinsically, the results have demonstrated that the effectiveness of natural ventilation has directly influenced reducing the risks of transmitting airborne infectious viruses for the selected heritage building in Jeddah (Saudi Arabia). The adopted methods in this research may be useful to understand the potentials of conserving old heritage buildings. Consequently, the results demonstrate that natural air ventilation systems are critical to combat the spread of infectious diseases in the pandemic.","Alaidroos, Alaa; Almaimani, Ayad; Baik, Ahmed; Al-Amodi, Mohamed; Rahaman, Khan Rubayet",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,159

405537,Persistence of intestinal SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with COVID-19 leads to re-admission after pneumonia resolved,2020,"BACKGROUND: Collection of respiratory cultures for airway microbiology surveillance is an essential component of routine clinical care in cystic fibrosis (CF). The COVID-19 global pandemic has necessitated increased use of telehealth, but one limitation of telehealth is the inability to collect respiratory specimens. We initiated a protocol for at-home collection of oropharyngeal (OP) swabs from children with CF. METHODS: Home respiratory specimen collection was offered during telehealth encounters. Home OP swab kits were sent to participating families via mail with instructions for collection and return. Specimens were returned by overnight shipping or dropped off at a hospital lab for processing and culture. We evaluated demographic data and compared culture results from the home-collected specimen to the most recent specimen collected in clinic. We also tracked the frequency of newly identified Pseudomonas aeruginosa. RESULTS: Home OP swab kits were sent to families of 33 children with CF (range 1.5-19 years). OP swab kits were successfully returned from 19 children (range 1.5-19 years). One or more CF pathogens grew from 79% of the specimens. For four individuals, the home collected specimen demonstrated the new growth of P. aeruginosa. CONCLUSIONS: Home collection of OP swabs for bacterial culture is feasible in children with CF across a range of ages. Most home-collected specimens demonstrated growth of one or more CF pathogens and results were similar to recent in-clinic specimens, suggesting acceptable sample collection technique. Anti-pseudomonal therapy was initiated for four children based on the growth of P. aeruginosa from the home respiratory specimen.","Lenhart-Pendergrass, Patricia M; Anthony, Meg; Sariyska, Sabina; Andrews, Ashley; Scavezze, Heather; Towler, Elinor; Martiniano, Stacey L; Hoppe, Jordana E; Zemanick, Edith T",Pediatr Pulmonol,,159
406089,"SARS-CoV-2—Morphology, Transmission and Diagnosis during Pandemic, Review with Element of Meta-Analysis",2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed the fragmentation of the healthcare delivery systems and highlighted the role of resilient primary healthcare systems for a robust public health response during health emergencies. Primary care while being the first point of contact between the citizens and the health systems has received scant attention or targeted investments over the past several decades. Through this narrative review, we aim to outline the potential role of telehealth in augmenting health systems capacity. While teleconsultations have increased exponentially during the pandemic, evidence suggests that utilisation of primary care for non-emergency and non-COVID-19 conditions such as chronic medical conditions has significantly decreased, suggesting that most telemedicine utilisation has been to address an immediate crisis. In countries with pre-existing national digital health framework and enabling regulatory environments, telehealth interventions while strengthening the public health response to COVID-19 also supported the continuum of care at the primary care level. Even after COVID-19 is controlled, telemedicine has the potential to address persistent obstacles to primary care in the South East Asia region, including scarcity of trained healthcare workers, access challenges and costs associated with in-person care. Telemedicine holds promise in strengthening primary care and has the potential to catalyse achieving universal health coverage.","Gudi, N.; Konapur, R.; John, O.; Sarbadhikari, S.; Landry, M.",BMJ Innovations,,159

One of the causes was that social awareness is still lacking especially for people in the poverty line. This study attempts to describe the social behavior of people in poverty line toward COVID-19 case in Makassar. METHOD: This research is a qualitative descriptive study based on the case. The data analysis was undertaken qualitatively. RESULTS: The results revealed that the limited understanding of people in poverty line about COVID-19 and health protocols makes their behavior indifferent and disobedient to health protocols. In addition, the government's top-down approach to deal with COVID-19 pandemic was ineffective. However, bottom-up collaborative interventions need to be carried out through a group approach to gain an understanding of the COVID-19 health protocol, especially for people in poverty line and other vulnerable groups.","Latief, Muhammad Iqbal; Amandaria, Riri",Gac Sanit,,159
407410,Difficult editorial decisions,2020,"BACKGROUND: In December 2019, the COVID-19 outbreak started in China and rapidly spread around the world. Lack of a vaccine or optimized intervention raised the importance of characterizing risk factors and symptoms for the early identification and successful treatment of patients with COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate and analyze biomedical literature and public social media data to understand the association of risk factors and symptoms with the various outcomes observed in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: Through semantic analysis, we collected 45 retrospective cohort studies, which evaluated 303 clinical and demographic variables across 13 different outcomes of patients with COVID-19, and 84,140 Twitter posts from 1036 COVID-19-positive users. Machine learning tools to extract biomedical information were introduced to identify mentions of uncommon or novel symptoms in tweets. We then examined and compared two data sets to expand our landscape of risk factors and symptoms related to COVID-19. RESULTS: From the biomedical literature, approximately 90% of clinical and demographic variables showed inconsistent associations with COVID-19 outcomes. Consensus analysis identified 72 risk factors that were specifically associated with individual outcomes. From the social media data, 51 symptoms were characterized and analyzed. By comparing social media data with biomedical literature, we identified 25 novel symptoms that were specifically mentioned in tweets but have been not previously well characterized. Furthermore, there were certain combinations of symptoms that were frequently mentioned together in social media. CONCLUSIONS: Identified outcome-specific risk factors, symptoms, and combinations of symptoms may serve as surrogate indicators to identify patients with COVID-19 and predict their clinical outcomes in order to provide appropriate treatments.","Jeon, Jouhyun; Baruah, Gaurav; Sarabadani, Sarah; Palanica, Adam",J Med Internet Res,,159

About a case,2020,"AIM: This study aimed to describe the change in surgical practice and the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on mortality after surgical resection of colorectal cancer during the initial phases of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. METHOD: This was an international cohort study of patients undergoing elective colon or rectal cancer resection, without preoperative suspicion of SARS-CoV-2. Centres entered data from their first recorded case of COVID-19 until 19 April 2020. The primary outcome was 30-day mortality. Secondary outcomes included anastomotic leak, postoperative SARS-CoV-2, and a comparison with a pre-pandemic European Society of Coloproctology cohort data. RESULTS: From 2073 patients in 40 countries, 1.3% (27/2073) had a defunctioning stoma and 3.0% (63/2073) had an end stoma instead of an anastomosis only. 30-day mortality was 1.8% (38/2073), the incidence of postoperative SARS-CoV-2 was 3.8% (78/2073), and the anastomotic leak rate was 4.9% (86/1738). Mortality was lowest in patients without a leak or SARS-CoV2 (14/1601, 0.9%), and highest in patients with both a leak and SARS-CoV-2 (5/13, 38.5%). Mortality was independently associated with an anastomotic leak (adjusted odds ratio 6.01, 95% confidence interval 2.58-14.06), postoperative SARS-CoV-2 (16.90, 7.86-36.38), male sex (2.46, 1.01-5.93), age >70 years (2.87, 1.32-6.20), and advanced cancer stage (3.43, 1.16-10.21). Compared to pre-pandemic data, there were fewer anastomotic leaks (4.9% versus 7.7%), an overall shorter length of stay (6 versus 7 days), but higher mortality (1.7% versus 1.1%). CONCLUSION: Surgeons need to further mitigate against both SARS-CoV-2 and anastomotic leak when offering surgery during current and future COVID-19 waves based on patient, operative, and organisational risks.",,Colorectal dis,,159

The frequency of acute cardiac injury in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 is unknown. The objective was to compare the rates of cardiac injury by angiotensin-converting enzyme-2-binding viruses from viruses that do not bind to angiotensin-converting enzyme-2. DATA SOURCES: We performed a systematic review of coronavirus disease 2019 literature on PubMed and EMBASE. STUDY SELECTION: We included studies with ten or more hospitalized adults with confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 or other viral pathogens that described the occurrence of acute cardiac injury. This was defined by the original publication authors or by: 1) myocardial ischemia, 2) new cardiac arrhythmia on echocardiogram, or 3) new or worsening heart failure on echocardiogram. DATA EXTRACTION: We compared the rates of cardiac injury among patients with respiratory infections with viruses that down-regulate angiotensin-converting enzyme-2, including H1N1, H5N1, H7N9, and severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus-1, to those with respiratory infections from other influenza viruses that do not bind angiotensin-converting enzyme-2, including Influenza H3N2 and influenza B. DATA SYNTHESIS: Of 57 studies including 34,072 patients, acute cardiac injury occurred in 50% (95% CI, 44-57%) of critically ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019. The overall risk of acute cardiac injury was 21% (95% CI, 18-26%) among hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019. In comparison, 37% (95% CI, 26-49%) of critically ill patients with other respiratory viruses that bind angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (p = 0.061) and 12% (95% CI, 7-22%) of critically ill patients with other respiratory viruses that do not bind angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (p < 0.001) experienced a cardiac injury. CONCLUSIONS: Acute cardiac injury may be associated with whether the virus binds angiotensin-converting enzyme-2. Acute cardiac injury occurs in half of critically ill coronavirus disease 2019 patients, but only 12% of patients infected by viruses that do not bind to angiotensin-converting enzyme-2.","Cheng, Matthew P; Cau, Alessandro; Lee, Todd C; Brodie, Daniel; Slutsky, Arthur; Marshall, John; Murthy, Srin; Lee, Terry; Singer, Joel; Demir, Koray K; Boyd, John; Ohm, Hyejee; Maslove, David; Goffi, Alberto; Bogoch, Isaac I; Sweet, David D; Walley, Keith R; Russell, James A",Crit. care med,,159

METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 38 family members of patients with advanced cancer (n=12) and bereaved family members (n=26) on when and how to effectively implement bereavement risk screening. Data was analyzed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: Many participants indicated that they would be open to completing a self-report screening measure before and after the patient's death. Several suggested screening at multiple timepoints and the importance of follow-up. Participants viewed screening as an opportunity to connect to psychosocial support. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that family members appear supportive of sensitively-approached bereavement risk screening before and after a patient's death as an important component of quality psychosocial care. To optimize implementation, bereavement risk screening would involve screening at multiple timepoints and include follow-up. Findings suggest standardized risk screening using a brief, validated self-report tool would be a pragmatic approach to increasing access to bereavement care. This article is protected by copyright.

413129,Clinical features of discharged COVID-19 patients with an extended SARS-CoV-2 RNA positive signal in respiratory samples,2020,"BACKGROUND: The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in late 2019 and its subsequent spread worldwide continues to be a global health crisis. Many governments consider contact tracing of citizens through apps installed on mobile phones as a key mechanism to contain the spread of SARS-CoV-2. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we sought to explore the suitability of artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled social media analyses using Facebook and Twitter to understand public perceptions of COVID-19 contact tracing apps in the United Kingdom. METHODS: We extracted and analyzed over 10,000 relevant social media posts across an 8-month period, from March 1 to October 31, 2020. We used an initial filter with COVID-19-related keywords, which were predefined as part of an open Twitter-based COVID-19 dataset. We then applied a second filter using contract tracing app-related keywords and a geographical filter. We developed and utilized a hybrid, rule-based ensemble model, combining state-of-the-art lexicon rule-based and deep learning-based approaches. RESULTS: Overall, we observed 76% positive and 12% negative sentiments, with the majority of negative sentiments reported in the North of England. These sentiments varied over time, likely influenced by ongoing public debates around implementing app-based contact tracing by using a centralized model where data would be shared with the health service, compared with decentralized contact-tracing technology. CONCLUSIONS: Variations in sentiments corroborate with ongoing debates surrounding the information governance of health-related information. AI-enabled social media analysis of public attitudes in health care can help facilitate the implementation of effective public health campaigns.","Cresswell, Kathrin; Tahir, Ahsen; Sheikh, Zakariya; Hussain, Zain; Domínguez Hernández, Andrés; Harrison, Ewen; Williams, Robin; Sheikh, Aziz; Hussain, Amir",J Med Internet Res,,159
415119,Co-infections among patients with COVID-19: The need for combination therapy with non-anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents?,2020,"RATIONALE Severe inflammation is thought to drive disease severity in patients with COVID-19. Proposed treatments include corticosteroids and tocilizumab. Corticosteroids have demonstrated outcome benefit in patients with severe ARDS1,2. Tocilizumab (an interleukin-6 receptor antibody) is theorized to block the inflammatory cascade3. Variable steroid administration for COVID-19 illness stemmed from the possibility of increased viral shedding and limited survival benefit noted from other Coronavirus strains4. Lack of standardization for tocilizumab and corticosteroid administration leaves retrospective study prone to confounding and bias;therefore, we proposed using causal analysis to better determine treatment efficacy. In clinical observational studies, it is only possible to observe an individual participant under one treatment scenario, whereas the counterfactual (alternate) outcome is unknown5. Targeted Maximum Likelihood Estimator (TMLE) generates two matched subject populations using assigned weights to create a pseudo-population that models counterfactual outcomes while limiting confounding bias6. The causal analysis objective was to elucidate the Average Treatment Effect (ATE) for steroids and tocilizumab to reduce mortality in adult patients with COVID-19. METHODS A retrospective review of adult patients with COVID-19 admitted to an ICU between March 2020 and June 2020. The primary outcome was ICU mortality. We used TMLE with an ensemble of machine learning algorithms as the primary model7. The machine learning ensemble included Logistic Regression, a Neural Network, Naive Bayes, and XGboost8. The analysis was performed on corticosteroid and tocilizumab administration separately. The covariates included for the corticosteroid group were age, ethnicity, oxygen support level, and tocilizumab treatment. The tocilizumab analysis covariates included age, ethnicity, oxygen support, ECMO, and treatment with corticosteroids. Our primary metric was Average Treatment Effect (ATE). Secondary metrics are Odds Ratio and Risk Ratio. RESULTS Using TMLE, mortality analysis on the corticosteroids group (n=199) demonstrated an ATE (RD) of-0.259, 95% CI [-0.387 ,-0.13], risk ratio (RR) 0.512, 95% CI [0.364, 0.72] and odds ratio (OR) of 0.33 [0.188, 0.581]. The tocilizumab group (n=199) demonstrated an ATE (RD) of 0.104, 95% CI [-0.025, 0.232], RR 1.343, 95% CI [0.916, 1.97] and OR of 1.578 [0.885-2.813]. CONCLUSION Causal analysis is a useful analysis model to evaluate treatment effects. In this cohort of adult patients with COVID-19, tocilizumab did not demonstrate a mortality difference, whereas corticosteroids were associated with decreased mortality.","Lee, B.; Chavez, K.; Schorr, C.; Bach, H.; Banerjee, A.; Quevada, K.; Patel, S.",American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine,,159

DESIGN: A phone survey administered between August and October 2020 to participants of a population-based longitudinal cohort study established in 2002 comprising two cohorts born in 1994-1995 and 2001-2002 in Ethiopia, India (Andhra Pradesh and Telangana), Peru and Vietnam. We use logistic regressions to examine associations between mental health and pandemic-related stressors, structural factors (gender, age), and lifelong protective/risk factors (parent and peer relationship, wealth, long-term health problems, past emotional problems, subjective well-being) measured at younger ages. SETTING: A geographically diverse, poverty-focused sample, also reaching those without mobile phones or internet access. PARTICIPANTS: 10 496 individuals were approached; 9730 participated. Overall, 8988 individuals were included in this study; 4610 (51%) men and 4378 (49%) women. Non-inclusion was due to non-location or missing data. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Symptoms consistent with at least mild anxiety or depression were measured by Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (&#8805;5) or Patient Health Questionnaire-8 (&#8805;5). RESULTS: Rates of symptoms of at least mild anxiety (depression) were highest in Peru at 41% (32%) (95% CI 38.63% to 43.12%; (29.49-33.74)), and lowest in Vietnam at 9% (9%) (95% CI 8.16% to 10.58%; (8.33-10.77)), mirroring COVID-19 mortality rates. Women were most affected in all countries except Ethiopia. Pandemic-related stressors such as health risks/expenses, economic adversity, food insecurity, and educational or employment disruption were risk factors for anxiety and depression, though showed varying levels of importance across countries. Prior parent/peer relationships were protective factors, while long-term health or emotional problems were risk factors. CONCLUSION: Pandemic-related health, economic and social stress present significant risks to the mental health of young people in LMICs where mental health support is limited, but urgently needed to prevent long-term consequences.","Porter, Catherine; Favara, Marta; Hittmeyer, Annina; Scott, Douglas; Sánchez Jiménez, Alan; Ellanki, Revathi; Woldehanna, Tassew; Duc, Le Thuc; Craske, Michelle G; Stein, Alan",BMJ Open,,159
416740,SARS-CoV-2 and arbovirus infection: a rapid systematic review,2020,"Patients with autoimmune rheumatic diseases (AIRD) are suspected to have less robust immune responses during COVID-19 due to underlying immune dysfunction and the use of immune-suppressive drugs. Fifty consecutive patients with a diagnosis of AIRD on disease-modifying drugs were included at around 30 days after a confirmatory test for COVID-19. Fifty controls matched one to one for age, sex, and severity of COVID-19 were also included at around 30 days after testing positive for COVID-19. Antibody titers for anti-spike protein IgG and anti-nucleocapsid protein IgG were estimated. Cases (mean age 45.9 ± 13; 76% females) and controls (mean age 45.9 ± 13; 76% females) had similar proportion of comorbidities. Of the cases, 4 had moderate and 1 had severe COVID-19, while 3 and 1 of controls had moderate and severe COVID-19 respectively. Positivity of anti-N IgG was similar between patients (80%) and controls (90%) (p = 0.26). Similarly, anti-S IgG was positive in 82% of patients and 86% of controls (p = 0.79). Both the antibodies were negative in seven (14%) patients and five (10%) of controls (p = 0.76, Fischer exact test). Only anti-N IgG titers were lower in patients as compared to controls. In four patients with rheumatoid arthritis, two with spondyloarthritis and one with eosinophilic fasciitis both antibodies were not detectable. They did not differ from the rest of the cohort in clinical characteristics. The patients with AIRD had adequate protective antibody responses to COVID-19 at a median of 30 days post-infection. Thus, the presence of AIRD or the use of immunosuppressants does not seem to influence the development of humoral immune response against COVID-19. Key Points â¢ Patients with autoimmune rheumatic diseases (AIRD) are suspected to have less robust immune responses. â¢ In our cohort of 50 patients with AIRD with confirmed COVID-19, only seven did not have detectable protective antibodies at 30 days post infection. â¢ Patients with AIRD on immunosuppressants have adequate protective antibodies post COVID-19 disease, at rates similar to that in health controls.","Shenoy, Padmanabha; Ahmed, Sakir; Shanoj, K C; Shenoy, Veena; Damodaran, Deepak; Menon, Aparna R; Alias, Bazil; Devakumar, Divya; Babu, A S Sageer",Clin. rheumatol,,159

424393,Advancing Digital Health Equity: A Policy Paper of the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the HIV Medicine Association,2020,"Stigmatization from work-related COVID-19 exposure has not been investigated in detail yet. Therefore, we systematically searched three databases: Medline, Embase, and PsychInfo (until October 2020), and performed a grey literature search (until February 2021). We identified 46 suitable articles from 24 quantitative and 11 qualitative studies, 6 systematic reviews, 3 study protocols and 1 intervention. The assessment of stigmatization varied widely, ranging from a single-item question to a 22-item questionnaire. Studies mostly considered perceived self-stigma (27 of 35 original studies) in healthcare workers (HCWs) or hospital-related jobs (29 of 35). All articles reported on stigmatization as a result of work-related COVID-19 exposure. However, most quantitative studies were characterized by convenience sampling (17 of 24), and all studies-also those with an adequate sampling design-were considered of low methodological quality. Therefore, it is not possible to determine prevalence of stigmatization in defined occupational groups. Nevertheless, the work-related stigmatization of occupational groups with or without suspected contact to COVID-19 is a relevant problem and increases the risk for depression (odds ratio (OR) = 1.74; 95% confidence interval CI 1.29-2.36) and anxiety (OR = 1.75; 95% CI 1.29-2.37). For promoting workers' health, anti-stigma strategies and support should be implemented in the workplace.","Schubert, Melanie; Ludwig, Julia; Freiberg, Alice; Hahne, Taurai Monalisa; Romero Starke, Karla; Girbig, Maria; Faller, Gudrun; Apfelbacher, Christian; von dem Knesebeck, Olaf; Seidler, Andreas",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,159

METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study in women undergoing Uphold mesh-augmented sacrospinous ligament fixation between 2010 and 2017. We compared 3 groups: (1) women with a wide genital hiatus preoperatively and 6 weeks postoperatively (""Persistently Wide"" cohort), (2) women with a wide genital hiatus preoperatively but normal hiatus 6 weeks postoperatively (""Improved"" cohort), and (3) women with a normal genital hiatus preoperatively and 6 weeks postoperatively (""Stably Normal"" cohort). We defined a wide hiatus as 4 cm or greater and a normal hiatus as less than 4 cm. The primary outcome was anatomic failure, defined as recurrent prolapse beyond the hymen or retreatment for prolapse with surgery or pessary. RESULTS: Ninety-seven women were included in the study. Overall, mean age was 68 years (±7.15 years), mean body mass index was 28.36 kg/m2 (±5.34 kg/m2) and mean follow up time was 400 ± 216 days. Anatomic failure did not differ between groups (Persistently Wide, 15.4%; Improved, 11.1%; Stably Normal, 10.0%; P = 0.88). In logistic regression, the odds of anatomic failure remained similar among all groups (P = 0.93). CONCLUSIONS: A persistently wide genital hiatus alone was not associated with anatomic failure in this small study cohort. Therefore, surgical reduction of the genital hiatus with level III support procedures may not affect prolapse recurrence at the time of mesh-augmented sacrospinous ligament fixation. Further studies are needed to confirm this relationship and investigate other potential mechanisms for these findings.","Vaughan, Monique H; Giugale, Lauren E; Siddiqui, Nazema Y; Bradley, Megan S",Female pelvic med. reconstr. surg.

429698,Evolving reporting criteria of COVID-19 in Taiwan during the epidemic,2020,"In recent years, high flow nasal cannula (HFNC) is a respiratory support system that has become prominent in the treatment of respiratory failure. HFNC provides higher concentration and flow of oxygen, resulting in decreasing anatomic dead space by preventing rebreathing and ensure positive end-expiratory. However, in COVID-19, the usage of HFNC is much controversial due to concerns about the benefits and risk of aerosol-dispersion. Considering the debates about the use of HFNC, we reviewed the literature related to the usage of HFNC in COVID-19. The available reports suggest that HFNC provides high concentrations of oxygen to the patients, who can not reach with conventional devices. HFNC can reduce the requiring of intubation in patients with COVID-19, and it can decrease the length of intensive care unit stay, and complications related to mechanical ventilation. Also HFNC can in achieving apneic oxygenation in patients during airway management. Besides that, the use of high-flow oxygen cannulas can produce aerosols. So, HFNC treatment should be carried out in a negative pressure room; when it is not possible, devices should be undertaken in a single room.","Gürün Kaya, Aslihan; Öz, Miraç; Erol, Serhat; Çiftçi, Fatma; Çiledag, Aydin; Kaya, Akin",Tuberk Toraks,,159

The aim of the present study is to analyze our results in colorectal oncologic surgery during the Covid-19 pandemic in patients with and without perioperative SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods In total, 32 patients (19 male and 13 female patients), with a mean age of 64 years (range: 57.2 to 69.5 years) with colorectal cancer underwent surgery under the recommendations of surgical societies included in a protocol. Data collection included clinical characteristics (gender, age, body mass index, American Society of Anesthesiologists score, tumor location, preoperative staging, lymphopenia), data related to SARS-CoV-2 infection (postoperative symptoms, diagnostic tests), operative details (surgical procedure, approach, duration, stoma), pathological outcomes (tumor stage, number of lymph nodes harvested, distal and circumferential radial margins, quality of the total mesorectal excision), and surgical outcomes (morbidity, mortality, hospital stay, and the rates of reoperation and readmission). Results A total of 3 (9.4%) patients who underwent colorectal surgery during the Covid-19 pandemic were infected by SARS-CoV-2 in the postoperative period. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was associated with Covid-19 (6.2% versus 33.3%;p = 0.042), and surgical morbidity was higher among Covid-19 patients (100% versus 37.9%;p = 0.039). There were not significant differences between COVID-19 patients and non-COVID-19 patients in relation to the rest of the analyzed outcomes. Conclusion During the Covid-19 pandemic, colorectal cancer surgery should be performed according to the recommendations of surgical societies.

To this end, firstly, we describe in detail how the growth of COVID-19 cases can be represented with a parameterized exponential curve. Then, having collected and pre-processed various country rankings, statistics and indicators of socio-economic circumstances of a country, we constructed an adequate dataset of 116 countries. In order to predict the behavior of the coronavirus spread behavior, we employed machine learning algorithms, i.e., regression and classification approach. Since the dataset is unlabelled, we also made use of the clustering methods. In essence, the results of the regression analysis indicate a strong relationship between countries’ socio-economic indicators and the behavior of the coronavirus number of novel cases.

The COVID-19 group (CovG) comprised patients who presented between April 15 and May 15, 2020, the 30-day period with the highest daily number of new cases in Turkey. The control group (CG) was obtained by randomization through a computer program from among 2 245 patients who applied in the same period of the previous year. The patients' presenting complaint(s), diagnostic(s) and demographic information's were collected from a database, with all identifying information concealed. For patients who presented more than once, their initial complaint and diagnoses were analyzed RESULTS: The study included a total of 400 patients: 200 in the CovG and 200 in the CG. Mean ages in the CovG and CG were 41.23 ± 14.48 and 48.20 ± 17.49 years, respectively (p < 0.001). The female to male patient ratio was 0.53 in the CovG and 0.83 in the CG (p = 0.032). There were fewer university graduates compared to other education levels among the patients who presented during the pandemic (p = 0.013). During the COVID-19 pandemic, there was no increase in presentation frequency for any ocular disease compared to the previous year. The only statistical decrease in patient application complaints was observed in reading difficultness (11 % in CovG vs. 37 % in CG; p < 0.001). Presentations due to dry eye (DE) and allergic conjunctivitis (AC) were similar to the same period of the year (p = 0.303 and p = 0.550, respectively). At least 1 chronic ocular disease was present in 25 % of the CovG and 45.5 % of the CG (p < 0.001). A statistically significant decrease was observed in CovG for age-related macular degeneration and glaucoma in the diagnoses made at the end of the examination (p = 0.001 and p < 0.001, respectively). CONCLUSION: During the first peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in Turkey, the most common outpatient presentations to the ophthalmology department were for the diagnoses of DE and AC. During peak pandemic period, elderly patients, women and academically trained patients significantly reduced their visits to the Eye Clinic. The reduction in presentation of patients with glaucoma and age-related macular degeneration may be due to the longterm treatment planning for these patients and the social isolation measures issued for the older population. These patients should be encouraged to use video consultation / telemedicine in eye patients at risk of vision loss.","Fatih, Aslan; Öktem, C",Cesk Slov Oftalmol,,159

The focus of this study was to investigate the effect of biliatresone on the development of the hepatobiliary system in mice. We successfully synthesized biliatresone with a purity of 98% and confirmed its biliary toxicity. Exposure to high doses of biliatresone caused abortion or death in pregnant mice. Neonatal mice injected with biliatresone developed clinical signs of biliary obstruction, and dysplasia or the absence of extrahepatic biliary tract lumen, which confirmed the occurrence of biliary atresia. In the portal tract of biliary atresia mice, signs of infiltration of inflammatory cells and liver fibrosis were observed. The signature of extrahepatic biliary gene expression in these mice mainly involved the cell adhesion process, and hepatic RNA-seq was highly linked to transcriptional evidence of oxidative stress. When compared with the control group, hepatic glutathione levels were markedly reduced after biliatresone injection. Taken together, these data confirm that biliatresone causes severe developmental abnormalities of the hepatobiliary system in mice. Furthermore, decreased levels of glutathione may play a mechanistic role in the pathogenesis of liver fibrosis in biliatresone-induced experimental biliary atresia.","Yang, Yifan; Wang, Junfeng; Zhan, Yong; Chen, Gong; Shen, Zhen; Zheng, Shan; Dong, Rui",Lab. invest,,159

The attention from both public and policy keeps raising on related practical problems, including \textit{1) how to protect data security and location privacy? 2) how to efficiently and dynamically deploy SRC Internet of Thing (IoT) witnesses to monitor large areas?} To answer these questions, in this paper, we propose a decentralized and permissionless blockchain protocol, named \textit{Bychain}. Specifically, 1) a privacy-preserving SRC protocol for activity-tracking and corresponding generalized block structure is developed, by connecting an interactive zero-knowledge proof protocol and the key escrow mechanism. As a result, connections between personal identity and the ownership of on-chain location information are decoupled.

Such disruption has greatly affected hands-on training programs essential to acquire clinical competencies, particularly modes requiring physical patient encounters. While most educational content has successfully been shifted to predominantly web-conferencing platforms, the essential clinical teaching at affiliated hospitals for undergraduate medicine clerkship years has been severely disrupted due to barring of students from hospital premises to minimise spread of COVID-19, presenting a problem requiring unique solutions to ensure that quality of education and subsequent healthcare is kept sufficiently high. To this degree, technological advances increasingly present several elegant solutions which may provide the required levels of educational delivery. In this article, we briefly discuss the number of options that could be deployed to aid in acquisition of requisite skills during the clerkship years, with a focus on wearable technologies and video recording/broadcasting. Given the ongoing pandemic, application of technological advances could provide, with some global coordination, the medical education community with numerous proactive solutions rather than just educational luxuries or novelties.","Yaqinuddin, Ahmed; Kashir, Junaid; AlKattan, Wael; AlKattan, Khaled",J Med Educ Curric Dev,,159

451193,Pediatric Emergency Visits for Asthma Drop Significantly with COVID19 School Closure,2021,"BACKGROUND: Minimal access surgery [MAS] is not available to most people in the rural areas of Low Middle-Income Countries [LMIC]. This leads to an increase in the morbidity and the economic loss to the poor and the marginalized. The Gasless laparoscopic surgeries [GAL] are possible in rural areas as they could be carried out under spinal-anaesthesia. In most cases, it does not require the logistics of providing gases for pneumoperitoneum and general anaesthesia. The current study compares GAL with conventional Laparoscopic surgeries [COL] for general surgical procedures METHODS: A single-centre, non-blinded randomized control trial [RCT] was conducted to evaluate non - inferiority of GAL versus COL at a teaching hospital in New Delhi. Patients were allocated into two groups and underwent MAS (Cholecystectomies and appendectomies). The procedure was carried out by two surgeons by randomly choosing between GAL and COL. The data was collected by postgraduates and analyzed by a biostatistician. RESULTS: 100 patients who met the inclusion criteria were allocated into two groups. No significant difference was observed in the mean operating time between GAL group (52.9 min) vs COL group (55 minutes) [p=0.3]. The intraoperative vital signs were better in the GAL group [p < 0.05]. The postoperative pain score was slightly higher in the GAL group [p = 0.01]; however, it did not require additional analgesics. CONCLUSIONS: No significant differences were found between the two groups. GAL can be classed as non-inferior compared to COL and has the potential to be adopted in low resource settings.","Mishra, Anurag; Bains, Lovenish; Jesudin, Gnanaraj; Aruparayil, Noel; Singh, Rajdeep",J.

455832,CT features of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia according to clinical presentation: a retrospective analysis of 120 consecutive patients from Wuhan city,2020,"Context: Following the emergence of the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), researchers sought safe and effective treatment modalities. Remdesivir is currently being evaluated for clinical efficacy and safety in patients with COVID-19. Objective: To describe the clinical outcomes of COVID-19 patients following treatment with remdesivir at a community hospital. Methods: A retrospective review of medical records was conducted in August 2020 for all patients given remdesivir while hospitalized for severe COVID-19 between May 1 and August 19, 2020. A convenience sample of consecutive patients with treatment including remdesivir, antibiotics, convalescent plasma, dexamethasone, or a combination of multiple drugs was included in the analysis. Patients receiving remdesivir were administered a 5-day treatment course. Patients with a glomerular filtration rate of less than 30 mL/min, those with liver function tests 5 times the normal reference range, and those who were pregnant were excluded from treatment with remdesivir. Differences in between men and women were detected with &#967;2 and independent samples t tests. The degree to which presenting symptoms influenced patient outcomes was analyzed with a stepwise logistic regression. Results: Among the 76 patients who received remdesivir, the mean (95% confidence interval, CI) age was 63 years (59.8-66.2). Thirty-six (47.4%) were men and 40 (52.6%) were women. Forty-nine (64.5%) were White and 27 (35.5%) were nonWhite. The majority of patients (54; 71.1%) had at least 1 comorbid condition, with hypertension being the most common (43; 56.6%). The mean (95% CI) length of stay for patients who received remdesivir was 10.09 days (8.6-11.6) and the mean (95% CI) duration of oxygen therapy was 9.42 days (8.0-10.8). A total of 14 (18.4%) patients given remdesivir were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with an mean (95% CI) length of stay of 9.29 days (5.6-13.0). Women administered remdesivir were more likely to be admitted to the ICU (11 [27.5%] vs 3 [8.3%]; P=.031). The mortality rate was 14 patients (18.4%), with no statistically significant difference observed between men (5; 13.9%) and women (9; 22.5%; P=.33). No significant difference was seen amongst sexes for duration of oxygen therapy (men, 8.0 days [6.2-9.8] vs women, 10.76 days [8.8-12.8]; P=.051) or length of stay (men, 8.61 days [6.7-10.5] vs women, 11.43 days [9.3-13.5]; P=.058). There was no statistically significant difference in pooled racial groups (White vs nonWhite) for in-hospital mortality, number admitted to the ICU, days spent in the ICU, duration of oxygen use, or length of stay. Conclusion: Remdesivir may show clinical efficacy for the treatment of severe COVID-19 in a community setting. Although this was a small-scale study with limited patients, it represents a point of reference for the use of remdesivir at other community hospitals.","Lee, Stephen; Santarelli, Anthony; Caine, Kristen; Schritter, Sarah; Dietrich, Tyson; Ashurst, John",J Am Osteopath Assoc,,159
457967,The Role of Human Coronavirus Infection in Pediatric Acute Gastroenteritis,2020,"In this work we propose a novel space-dependent multiscale model for the spread of infectious diseases in a two-dimensional spatial context on realistic geographical scenarios. The model couples a system of kinetic transport equations describing a population of commuters moving on a large scale (extra-urban) with a system of diffusion equations characterizing the non commuting population acting over a small scale (urban). The modeling approach permits to avoid unrealistic effects of traditional diffusion models in epidemiology, like infinite propagation speed on large scales and mass migration dynamics. A construction based on the transport formalism of kinetic theory allows to give a clear model interpretation to the interactions between infected and susceptible in compartmental space-dependent models. In addition, in a suitable scaling limit, our approach permits to couple the two populations through a consistent diffusion model acting at the urban scale. A discretization of the system based on finite volumes on unstructured grids, combined with an asymptotic preserving method in time, shows that the model is able to describe correctly the main features of the spatial expansion of an epidemic. An application to the initial spread of COVID-19 is finally presented.","Boscheri, Walter; Dimarco, Giacomo; Pareschi, Lorenzo",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.10101v1.pdf,159

In this article, we analyse whether the level of compliance with social distancing measures is associated with political, economic, and demographic factors. In particular, our interests lie in two areas. First, as lockdowns have dragged on, many countries see some political resistance, often, though not always, from populist movements: are localities that support populist movements more likely to ignore social distancing measures? Secondly, economic security: do localities with higher levels of income and wealth have higher levels of social distancing? We combine anonymised movement data from people's mobile phones drawn from the Google Community Mobility surveys with subnational economic and demographic data to answer these questions. It is found that across Europe, social distancing patterns correlate strongly with populist attitudes and economic security.

460855,Continuous thrombocytopenia after SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid negative in a non-severe COVID-19 patient for several months,2020,"With high certainty, extreme weather events will intensify in their impact within the next 10 years due to climate change-induced increases in hazard probability of occurrence and simultaneous increases in socio-economic vulnerability. Data from previous mega-disasters show that losses from disruptions of critical services surpass the value of direct damages in the exposed areas because critical infrastructures [CI] are increasingly (inter-) dependent. Local events may have global impacts. Systemic criticality, which describes the relevance of a critical infrastructure due to its positioning within the system, needs to be addressed to reduce the likelihood of cascading effects. This paper presents novel approaches to operationalise and assess systemic criticality. Firstly, the paper introduces systemic cascade potential as a measurement of systemic criticality. It takes the relevance of a sector and the relevance of its interdependencies into account to generate a relative value of systemic importance for a CI sector. Secondly, an exemplary sectoral assessment of the road network allows reflecting the spatial manifestation of the first level of cascading effects. It analyses the impact of traffic interruptions on the accessibility of critical facilities to point out the systemically most critical segments of the municipal road network. To further operationalise the spatial dimension of criticality, a normative assertion determining the worthiness of protection of system components is required. A nationwide spatial flood protection plan incorporates this aspect in Germany for the first time. Its formal approval process was initiated in February 2020.","Kruse, Philip M.; Schmitt, Hanna C.; Greiving, Stefan",Climatic Change,,159

Features of the pathophysiology and clinical presentation partially distinguish it from 'classical' ARDS. A Research and Development (RAND) analysis gauged the opinion of an expert panel about the management of ARDS with and without COVID-19 as the precipitating cause, using recent UK guidelines as a template. METHODS: An 11-person panel comprising intensive care practitioners rated the appropriateness of ARDS management options at different times during hospital admission, in the presence or absence of, or varying severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection on a scale of 1-9 (where 1-3 is inappropriate, 4-6 is uncertain and 7-9 is appropriate). A summary of the anonymised results was discussed at an online meeting moderated by an expert in RAND methodology. The modified online survey comprising 76 questions, subdivided into investigations (16), non-invasive respiratory support (18), basic intensive care unit management of ARDS (20), management of refractory hypoxaemia (8), pharmacotherapy (7) and anticoagulation (7), was completed again. RESULTS: Disagreement between experts was significant only when addressing the appropriateness of diagnostic bronchoscopy in patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19. Adherence to existing published guidelines for the management of ARDS for relevant evidence-based interventions was recommended. Responses of the experts to the final survey suggested that the supportive management of ARDS should be the same, regardless of a COVID-19 diagnosis. For patients with ARDS with COVID-19, the panel recommended routine treatment with corticosteroids and a lower threshold for full anticoagulation based on a high index of suspicion for venous thromboembolic disease. CONCLUSION: The expert panel found no reason to deviate from the evidence-based supportive strategies for managing ARDS outlined in recent guidelines.","Griffiths, Mark; Meade, Susanna; Summers, Charlotte; McAuley, Daniel Francis; Proudfoot, Alastair; Baladia, Marta Montero; Dark, Paul M; Diomede, Kate; Finney, Simon J; Forni, Lui G; Meadows, Chris; Naldrett, Ian A; Patel, Brijesh; Perkins, Gavin D; Samaan, Mark A; Sharifi, Laurence; Suntharalingam, Ganesh; Tarmey, Nicholas T; Young, Harriet F; Wise, Matt P; Irving, Peter M",Thorax,,159

Studies have shown that smokers are less likely to be diagnosed with or be hospitalized for COVID-19 but, once hospitalized, have higher odds for an adverse outcome. We have previously presented the potential interaction between SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoprotein and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), due to a ""toxin-like"" epitope on the Spike glycoprotein, with homology to a sequence of a snake venom toxin. This epitope coincides with the well-described cryptic epitope for the human anti-SARS-CoV antibody CR3022. In this study, we present the molecular complexes of both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoproteins, at their open or closed conformations, with the model of the human &#945;7 nAChR. We found that all studied protein complexes' interface involves a large part of the ""toxin-like"" sequences of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoproteins and toxin binding site of human &#945;7 nAChR. Our findings provide further support to the hypothesis about the protective role of nicotine and other cholinergic agonists. The potential therapeutic role of CR3022 and other similar monoclonal antibodies with increased affinity for SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoprotein against the clinical effects originating from the dysregulated cholinergic pathway should be further explored.","Lagoumintzis, George; Chasapis, Christos T; Alexandris, Nikolaos; Kouretas, Dimitrios; Tzartos, Socrates; Eliopoulos, Elias; Farsalinos, Konstantinos; Poulas, Konstantinos",Food Chem Toxicol,,159

STUDY DESIGN: This is a retrospective cohort study of pregnant women with COVID-19. Pregnant women were divided into two groups based on status at admission, symptomatic or asymptomatic. All testing was done by nasopharyngeal swab using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Initially, nasopharyngeal testing was performed only on women with a positive screen (symptoms or exposure) but subsequently, testing was universally performed on all women admitted to labor and delivery. Chi-square and Wilcoxon's rank-sum tests were used to compare outcomes between groups. RESULTS: Eighty-one patients were tested because of a positive screen (symptoms [n = 60] or exposure only [n = 21]) and 75 patients were universally tested (all asymptomatic). In total, there were 46 symptomatic women and 22 asymptomatic women (tested based on exposure only [n = 12] or as part of universal screening [n = 10]) with confirmed COVID-19. Of symptomatic women (n = 46), 27.3% had preterm delivery and 26.1% needed respiratory support while none of the asymptomatic women (n = 22) had preterm delivery or need of respiratory support (p = 0.007 and 0.01, respectively). CONCLUSION: Pregnant women who presented with COVID19-related symptoms and subsequently tested positive for COVID-19 have a higher rate of preterm delivery and need for respiratory support than asymptomatic pregnant women. It is important to be particularly rigorous in caring for COVID-19 infected pregnant women who present with symptoms.

479594,Influence of the onset of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on the diagnosis and treatment of ulcerative colitis,2021,"Considerable progress has been made towards conversational models that generate coherent and fluent responses by training large language models on large dialogue datasets. These models have little or no control of the generated responses and miss two important features: continuous dialogue skills integration and seamlessly leveraging diverse knowledge sources. In this paper, we propose the Adapter-Bot, a dialogue model that uses a fixed backbone conversational model such as DialGPT (Zhang et al., 2019) and triggers on-demand dialogue skills (e.g., emphatic response, weather information, movie recommendation) via different adapters (Houlsby et al., 2019). Each adapter can be trained independently, thus allowing a continual integration of skills without retraining the entire model. Depending on the skills, the model is able to process multiple knowledge types, such as text, tables, and graphs, in a seamless manner.

482458,Anti-HLA and anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in kidney transplant recipients with COVID-19,2021,"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has emerged as a global health and economic security threat with staggering cumulative incidence worldwide. Given the severity of projections, hospitals across the globe are creating additional critical care surge capacity and limiting patient routine access to care for other diseases like tuberculosis (TB). The outbreak fuels panic in sub-Saharan Africa where the healthcare system is fragile in withstanding the disease. Here, we looked over the COVID-19 containment measures in Ethiopia in context from reliable sources and put forth recommendations that leverage the health system response to COVID-19 and TB. MAIN TEXT: Ethiopia shares a major proportion of the global burden of infectious diseases, while the patterns of COVID-19 are still at an earlier stage of the epidemiology curve. The Ethiopian government exerted tremendous efforts to curb the disease. It limited public gatherings, ordered school closures, directed high-risk civil servants to work from home, and closed borders. It suspended flights to 120 countries and restricted mass transports. It declared a five-month national state of emergency and granted a pardon for 20 402 prisoners. It officially postponed parliamentary and presidential elections. It launched the 'PM Abiy-Jack Ma initiative', which supports African countries with COVID-19 diagnostics and infection prevention and control commodities. It expanded its COVID-19 testing capacity to 38 countrywide laboratories. Many institutions are made available to provide clinical care and quarantine. However, the outbreak still has the potential for greater loss of life in Ethiopia if the community is unable to shape the regular behavioral and sociocultural norms that would facilitate the spread of the disease. The government needs to keep cautious that irregular migrants would fuel the disease. A robust testing capacity is needed to figure out the actual status of the disease. The pandemic has reduced TB care and research activities significantly and these need due attention. CONCLUSIONS: Ethiopia took several steps to detect, manage, and control COVID-19. More efforts are needed to increase testing capacity and bring about behavioral changes in the community. The country needs to put in place alternative options to mitigate interruptions of essential healthcare services and scientific researches of significant impact.","Mohammed, Hussen; Oljira, Lemessa; Roba, Kedir Teji; Yimer, Getnet; Fekadu, Abebaw; Manyazewal, Tsegahun",Infect Dis Poverty,,159

484361,SARS-CoV-2 Clinical Outcomes in Patients with Cancer in a Large Integrated Health Care System in Northern California,2020,"SARS-CoV-2 entry requires sequential cleavage of the spike glycoprotein at the S1/S2 and the S2' cleavage sites to mediate membrane fusion. SARS-CoV-2 has a polybasic insertion (PRRAR) at the S1/S2 cleavage site that can be cleaved by furin. Using lentiviral pseudotypes and a cell-culture-adapted SARS-CoV-2 virus with an S1/S2 deletion, we show that the polybasic insertion endows SARS-CoV-2 with a selective advantage in lung cells and primary human airway epithelial cells, but impairs replication in Vero E6, a cell line used for passaging SARS-CoV-2. Using engineered spike variants and live virus competition assays and by measuring growth kinetics, we find that the selective advantage in lung and primary human airway epithelial cells depends on the expression of the cell surface protease TMPRSS2, which enables endosome-independent virus entry by a route that avoids antiviral IFITM proteins. SARS-CoV-2 virus lacking the S1/S2 furin cleavage site was shed to lower titres from infected ferrets and was not transmitted to cohoused sentinel animals, unlike wild-type virus. Analysis of 100,000 SARS-CoV-2 sequences derived from patients and 24 human postmortem tissues showed low frequencies of naturally occurring mutants that harbour deletions at the polybasic site. Taken together, our findings reveal that the furin cleavage site is an important determinant of SARS-CoV-2 transmission.","Peacock, Thomas P; Goldhill, Daniel H; Zhou, Jie; Baillon, Laury; Frise, Rebecca; Swann, Olivia C; Kugathasan, Ruthiran; Penn, Rebecca; Brown, Jonathan C; Sanchez-David, Raul Y; Braga, Luca; Williamson, Maia Kavanagh; Hassard, Jack A; Staller, Ecco; Hanley, Brian; Osborn, Michael; Giacca, Mauro; Davidson, Andrew D; Matthews, David A; Barclay, Wendy S",Nat. microbiol,,159

487663,Use of chlorhexidine to eradicate oropharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 patients,2021,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: A majority of medical students believe that treating sexual concerns is important for their careers. However, a minority feel that they have received adequate instruction in medical school. This novel supplemental reproductive and sexual health curriculum at a large academic medical center aimed to address this gap and to improve attitudes, comfort, and knowledge about sexual and reproductive health topics among learners. METHODS: Students participated in a series of sexual and reproductive health workshops taught by interdisciplinary health care workers, with the first cohort in a classroom setting and the second cohort using a virtual format due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We administered a novel pre- and postcourse survey to assess attitudes, comfort, and knowledge about the topics. We performed unpaired 1-tailed t tests and &#967;2 tests to compare the scores on the pre- and postcourse surveys. RESULTS: Sample size was 12 students for the first cohort and 23 students for the second cohort. Reported levels of comfort with taking sexual histories in different age groups and discussing reproductive and sexual health topics increased significantly: 0.92 for the classroom setting, and 0.50 for the virtual setting, with an average increase of 0.65 points on a 4-point Likert scale. There were no significant changes in student attitudes toward or knowledge of reproductive and sexual health. CONCLUSION: This course elaborated on topics to which medical students traditionally lack adequate exposure, with significant improvement in comfort counseling patients. A disparity between the classroom and virtual setting suggests limitations of online learning for these topics.","Friedlander, Rachel; Mou, Sophie; Shearer, Lee",Fam Med,,159

489721,The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2: From a zoonotic infection to coronavirus disease 2019,2020,"AIM AND OBJECTIVE: At present, the world is facing a global pandemic threat of SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19 and till date, there are no clinically approved vaccines or antiviral drugs available for the treatment of coronavirus infections. Studies conducted in China recommended the use of liquorice (Glycyrrhiza species), an integral medicinal herb of traditional Chinese medicine in the deactivation of COVID-19. Therefore, the present investigation was undertaken to identify the leads from the liquorice plant against COVID-19 using molecular docking simulation studies. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A set of reported bioactive compounds of liquorice were investigated for COVID-19 main protease (Mpro) inhibitory potential. The study was conducted on Autodock vina software using COVID-19 Mpro as a target protein having PDB ID: 6LU7. RESULTS: Out of the total 20 docked compounds, only six compounds showed the best affinity towards the protein target, which included glycyrrhizic acid, isoliquiritin apioside, glyasperin A, liquiritin, 1-methoxyphaseollidin and hedysarimcoumestan B. From the overall observation, glycyrrhizic acid followed by isoliquiritin apioside demonstrated the best affinity towards Mpro representing the binding energy of -8.6 and -7.9 Kcal/mol respectively. Nevertheless, the other four compounds were also quite comparable with the later one. CONCLUSION: From the present investigation, we conclude that the compounds having oxane ring and chromenone ring substituted with hydroxyl 3-methylbut-2-enyl group could be the best alternative for the development of new leads from liquorice plant against COVID-19.","Sinha, Saurabh K; Prasad, Satyendra K; Islam, Md Ataul; Chaudhary, Sushil K; Singh, Shashikant; Shakya, Anshul",,,159

There are few therapeutic options and no approved vaccines. Here, we examine the properties of highly potent human monoclonal antibodies (hu-mAbs) in a Syrian hamster model of SARS-CoV-2 and in a mouse-adapted model of SARS-CoV-2 infection (SARS-CoV-2 MA). Antibody combinations were effective for prevention and in therapy when administered early. However, in vitro antibody neutralization potency did not uniformly correlate with in vivo protection, and some hu-mAbs were more protective in combination in vivo. Analysis of antibody Fc regions revealed that binding to activating Fc receptors contributes to optimal protection against SARS-CoV-2 MA. The data indicate that intact effector function can affect hu-mAb protective activity and that in vivo testing is required to establish optimal hu-mAb combinations for COVID-19 prevention.","Schäfer, Alexandra; Muecksch, Frauke; Lorenzi, Julio C C; Leist, Sarah R; Cipolla, Melissa; Bournazos, Stylianos; Schmidt, Fabian; Maison, Rachel M; Gazumyan, Anna; Martinez, David R; Baric, Ralph S; Robbiani, Davide F; Hatziioannou, Theodora; Ravetch, Jeffrey V; Bieniasz, Paul D; Bowen, Richard A; Nussenzweig, Michel C; Sheahan, Timothy P",,,159
494122,SARS-CoV2 and immunosuppression: A double-edged sword,2020,"AIM: We aimed to estimate the risk of COVID-19 outbreaks in a COVID-19-free destination country (New Zealand) associated with shore leave by merchant ship crews who were infected prior to their departure or on their ship. METHODS: We used a stochastic version of the SEIR model CovidSIM v1.1 designed specifically for COVID-19. It was populated with parameters for SARS-CoV-2 transmission, shipping characteristics and plausible control measures. RESULTS: When no control interventions were in place, we estimated that an outbreak of COVID-19 in New Zealand would occur after a median time of 23 days (assuming a global average for source country incidence of 2.66 new infections per 1,000 population per week, crews of 20 with a voyage length of 10 days and 1 day of shore leave per crew member both in New Zealand and abroad, and 108 port visits by international merchant ships per week). For this example, the uncertainty around when outbreaks occur is wide (an outbreak occurs with 95% probability between 1 and 124 days). The combination of PCR testing on arrival, self-reporting of symptoms with contact tracing and mask use during shore leave increased this median time to 1.0 year (14 days to 5.4 years, or a 49% probability within a year). Scenario analyses found that onboard infection chains could persist for well over 4 weeks, even with crews of only 5 members. CONCLUSION: This modelling work suggests that the introduction of SARS-CoV-2 through shore leave from international shipping crews is likely, even after long voyages. But the risk can be substantially mitigated by control measures such as PCR testing and mask use.","Wilson, Nick; Blakely, Tony; Baker, Michael G; Eichner, Martin",N Z Med J,,159

A perspective through the lens of respiratory tract infections: author's response,2020,"The widely used logistic model for epidemic case reporting data may be either restrictive or unrealistic in presence of containment measures when implemented after an epidemic outbreak. For flexibility in epidemic case reporting data modeling, we combined an exponential growth curve for the early epidemic phase with a flexible growth curve to account for the potential change in growth pattern after implementation of containment measures. We also fitted logistic regression models to recoveries and deaths from the confirmed positive cases. In addition, the growth curves were integrated into a SIQR (Susceptible, Infective, Quarantined, Recovered) model framework to provide an overview on the modeled epidemic wave. We focused on the estimation of: (1) the delay between the appearance of the first infectious case in the population and the outbreak (“epidemic latency period”);(2) the duration of the exponential growth phase;(3) the basic and the time-varying reproduction numbers;and (4) the peaks (time and size) in confirmed positive cases, active cases and new infections.

In those patients who develop worsening pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), high concentrations of oxygen may need to be administered for prolonged time periods, often together with mechanical ventilation. Hyperoxia, although lifesaving and essential for maintaining adequate oxygenation in the short-term, may have adverse long-term consequences upon lung parenchymal structure and function. How hyperoxia per se impacts lung disease in COVID-19 has remained largely unexplored. Numbers of experimental studies have previously established that hyperoxia is associated with deleterious outcomes inclusive of: perturbations in immunologic responses; abnormal metabolic function and alterations in hemodynamics and alveolar barrier function. Such changes may ultimately progress into clinically evident lung injury, adverse remodeling and result in parenchymal fibrosis when exposure is prolonged. Given that significant exposure to hyperoxia in patients with severe COVID-19 may be unavoidable to preserve life, these sequelae of hyperoxia, superimposed on the cytopathic effects of SARS-CoV-2 virus may well impact pathogenesis of COVID-19-induced ARDS.","Hanidziar, Dusan; Robson, Simon C","Am. j. physiol., lung cell. mol. physiol",,159

We propose two measures for quantifying the trendiness of trends. Under the assumption that reality evolves in continuous time we define what constitutes a trend and a change in a trend, and we introduce a probabilistic Trend Direction Index. This index has the interpretation of the probability that a latent characteristic has changed monotonicity at any given time conditional on observed data. We also define a global index of Expected Trend Instability quantifying the expected number of times that a trend has changed on an interval. Using a latent Gaussian process model we show how the Trend Direction Index and the Expected Trend Instability can be estimated from data in a Bayesian framework and give an application to development of the proportion of smokers in Denmark during the last 20 years.","Jensen, Andreas Kryger; Ekstrom, Claus Thorn",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.11848v1.pdf,159

516126,Original Article Highlights From This Issue,2021,"The molecular mechanism of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Spike protein was characterized to identify novel therapies. The impact of tofacitinib, IL-6R Ab, or TNFi therapy was determined on Spike protein or LPS/IFN-Î³-induced signaling, inflammation, and metabolic reprogramming in M&#934;s and/or rheumatoid arthritis (RA) fibroblast-like synoviocyte (FLS). ACE2 frequency was markedly expanded in M&#934;s compared to T cells and RA FLS. Tofacitinib suppresses Spike protein potentiated STAT1 signaling, whereas this function was unchanged by TNFi. Tofacitinib impairs IL-6/IFN/LPS-induced STAT1 and STAT3 phosphorylation in RA M&#934;s and FLS. Interestingly, tofacitinib had a broader inhibitory effect on the monokines, glycolytic regulators, or oxidative metabolites compared to IL-6R Ab and TNFi in Spike-protein-activated M&#934;s. In contrast, all three therapies disrupted IFN-&#945; and IFN-ß secretion in response to Spike protein; nonetheless, the IFN-Î³ was only curtailed by tofacitinib or IL-6R Ab. While tofacitinib counteracted M&#934; metabolic rewiring instigated by Spike protein, it was inconsequential on the glycolysis expansion mediated via HK2 and/or LDHA in the activated RA M&#934; and FLS. Nevertheless, the potentiated inflammatory response and the diminished oxidative phosphorylation modulated by Spike protein and/or LPS/IFN-Î³ stimulation in M&#934;s or RA FLS were reversed by tofacitinib. In conclusion, tofacitinib suppresses M&#934; inflammation and immunometabolism triggered by Spike protein and may provide a promising strategy for COVID-19 patients.","Palasiewicz, Karol; Umar, Sadiq; Romay, Bianca; Zomorrodi, Ryan K; Shahrara, Shiva",Eur. j. immunol,,159
516469,Upper Respiratory Tract Co-detection of Human Endemic Coronaviruses and High-density Pneumococcus Associated With Increased Severity Among HIV-Uninfected Children Under 5 Years Old in the PERCH Study,2021,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and represents the causative agent of a potentially fatal disease. The spread of the infection and the severe clinical disease have led to the widespread adoption of social distancing measures. Special attention and efforts to protect or reduce transmission have been applied at all social levels, including health care operators. Hence, this reports focuses on the description of a new protocol for the safe management of cytological samples processed by liquid-based cytology (LBC) with an evaluation of the changes in terms of morphology and immunoreactivity. METHODS: From March 11 to April 25, 2020, 414 cytological cases suspicious for SARS-CoV-2 were processed with a new virus-inactivating method suggested by Hologic, Inc, for all LBC specimens. RESULTS: The samples showed an increased amount of fibrin in the background. A slight decrease in cellular size was also observed in comparison with the standard method of preparation. Nonetheless, the nuclear details of the neoplastic cells were well identified, and the immunoreactivity of the majority of those cells was maintained. The cell blocks did not show significant differences in morphology, immunoreactivity, or nucleic acid stability. CONCLUSIONS: Despite some minor changes in the morphology of the cells, the results of this study highlight that the adoption of the new protocol for the biosafety of LBC-processed samples in pathology laboratories is important for minimizing the risk for personnel, trainees, and cytopathologists without impairing the diagnostic efficacy of the technique.","Straccia, Patrizia; Rossi, Esther Diana; Martini, Maurizio; Mulè, Antonino; Cianfrini, Federica; Curatolo, Mariangela; Cancellieri, Alessandra; Brunelli, Chiara; Zannoni, Gian Franco; Fadda, Guido",Cancer cytophathol,,159

These compounds reach wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) through sewerage system and are not sufficiently removed by using conventional treatment process. Psychiatric drugs released with WWTP effluent may cause possible risks to the receiving aquatic environment. Also, two antidepressants have been included in the ""watch list"" in 2020. Therefore, simple and relatively cost effective removal of psychiatric drugs from wastewaters becomes important. Magnetite red mud nanoparticles (RM-NPs) synthesized was applied for the removal of psychiatric drugs (fluoxetine, paroxetine, carbamazepine, diazepam, and lorazepam) in WWTP effluent first time in this study. The adsorption of carbamazepine as a model compound was fitted well with pseudo-second-order kinetic model. The Freundlich isotherm model better represented the sorption data than the Langmuir model. High adsorption capacity (90.5 mg/g) was reached at 30 min contact time at pH 6.5-7.0 at 25 °C. The adsorption rate was described by the pseudo second order model and its rate control mechanism was controlled by film diffusion. The magnetite RM-NPs were efficiently used for the removal of carbamazepine from real WWTP effluents. The adsorption capacity and the magnetic separability of the regenerated magnetite RM-NPs were unaffected five cycles. Due to its simple application, low cost and high adsorption capacity, magnetite RM-NPs can be recommended as a better adsorbent comparing to commercial adsorbents to remove psychiatric drugs from WWTP effluents.","Aydin, Senar; Bedük, Fatma; Ulvi, Arzu; Aydin, Mehmet Emin",Sci Total Environ,,159

Methods: We retrospectively collected clinical data and outcomes of COVID-19 positive cancer patients treated consecutively in five North London hospitals (cohort A). Outcomes recorded included time interval between most recent anti-cancer treatment and admission, severe outcome [a composite endpoint of intensive care unit (ITU) admission, ventilation and/or death] and mortality. Outcomes were compared with consecutively admitted COVID-19 positive patients, without a history of cancer (cohort B), treated at the primary centre during the same time period (1 March–30 April 2020). Patients were matched for age, gender and comorbidity. Results: The median age in both cohorts was 74 years, with 67% male, and comprised of 30 patients with cancer, and 90 without (1:3 ratio). For cohort B, 579 patients without a history of cancer and consecutively admitted were screened from the primary London hospital, 105 were COVID-19 positive and 90 were matched and included. Excluding cancer, both cohorts had a median of two comorbidities. The odds ratio (OR) for mortality, comparing patients with cancer to those without, was 1.05 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.4–2.5], and severe outcome (OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.4–2.0) suggesting no increased risk of death or a severe outcome in patients with cancer. Cancer patients who received systemic treatment within 28 days had an OR for mortality of 4.05 (95% CI 0.68–23.95), p = 0.12. On presentation anaemia, hypokalaemia, hypoalbuminaemia and hypoproteinaemia were identified predominantly in cohort A. Median duration of admission was 8 days for cancer patients and 7 days for non-cancer. Conclusion: A diagnosis of cancer does not appear to increase the risk of death or a severe outcome in COVID-19 patients with cancer compared with those without cancer. If a second spike of virus strikes, rational decision making is required to ensure optimal cancer care.","Joharatnam-Hogan, Nalinie; Hochhauser, Daniel; Shiu, Kai-Keen; Rush, Hannah; Crolley, Valerie; Wilson, William; Sharma, Anand; Muhammad, Aun; Anwar, Muhammad; Vasdev, Nikhil; Goldstein, Robert; Kantser, Ganna; Saha, Aramita; Raja, Fharat; Bridgewater, John; Khan, Khurum",Ther.

Thirty PTs who had worked at a National Public Hospital in Madrid during the first COVID-19 outbreak were recruited by purposeful sampling and snowball techniques. In-depth interviews and researcher field notes were used to collect data. Interviews were transcribed verbatim. An inductive thematic analysis was used to identify emerging themes. After identifying 1110 codes, four themes emerged. Throughout the first wave of the pandemic, the role and work of PTs in hospitals experienced a change. These changes took place at their organizational level, affecting the distribution of PTs in the hospital, and the role of PTs in front-line COVID units such as ICUs, as well as direct management of outpatients at the onset of the pandemic, and after discharge from the ICUs. This situation has led to PTs foreseeing challenges and developing new expectations concerning their role and the physical therapy profession in the future.","Palacios-Ceña, Domingo; Fernández-de-las-Peñas, César; Florencio, Lidiane L.; Palacios-Ceña, María; de-la-Llave-Rincón, Ana I.",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18168368; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34444118/,159
590313,"Clinical and molecular features of adenovirus type 2, 3, and 7 infections in children in an outbreak in Taiwan, 2011",2016-11-13,"INTRODUCTION: Older Canadians living with frailty are high users of healthcare services; however, the healthcare system is not well designed to meet the complex needs of many older adults. Older persons look to their primary care practitioners to assess their needs and coordinate their care. They may need care from a variety of providers and services, but often this care is not well coordinated. Older adults and their family caregivers are the experts in their own needs and preferences, but often do not have a chance to participate fully in treatment decisions or care planning. As a result, older adults may have health problems that are not properly assessed, managed or treated, resulting in poorer health outcomes and higher economic and social costs. We will be implementing enhanced primary healthcare approaches for older patients, including risk screening, patient engagement and shared decision making and care coordination. These interventions will be tailored to the needs and circumstances of the primary care study sites. In this article, we describe our study protocol for implementing and testing these approaches. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Nine primary care sites in three Canadian provinces will participate in a multi-phase mixed methods study. In phase 1, baseline information will be collected through questionnaires and interviews with patients and healthcare providers (HCPs). In phase 2, HCPs and patients will be consulted to tailor the evidence-based interventions to site-specific needs and circumstances. In phase 3, sites will implement the tailored care model. Evaluation of the care model will include measures of patient and provider experience, a quality of life measure, qualitative interviews and economic evaluation. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study has received ethics clearance from the host academic institutions: University of Calgary (REB17-0617), University of Waterloo (ORE#22446) and Université Laval (#MP-13-2019-1500 and 2017-2018-12-MP).

This study aimed to investigate the association between stress and turnover intention among healthcare workers in Saudi Arabia and whether social support could affect this association. In this cross-sectional study, healthcare workers in primary healthcare centers in Saudi Arabia responded to an online questionnaire assessing their sociodemographic and occupational history, stress levels using the Perceived Stress Scale-10 (PSS-10), social support using the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS), and turnover intention within the next few months. Path analysis was conducted to assess the mediating effect of social support on the association between stress and turnover intention. A total of 1101 healthcare workers (242 physicians, 340 nurses, 310 paramedics, and 209 administrative workers) participated in this study. The path between stress and support had a significant standardized regression weight (-.34, p < .05). The path between support and turnover had a significant standardized regression weight (.08, p < .05). The standardized total effect of stress on turnover without the impact of support was significant (-.39, p < .05). The direct effect of stress on turnover with the presence of support was significant (-.36, p < .05). The indirect effect of stress on turnover with the presence of support was significant (-.03, p < .05). Thus, there is evidence to show that support mediates the relationship between stress and support. Stress is associated with turnover intention among healthcare workers in Saudi Arabia. Social support had a mitigating effect on the relationship between stress and turnover intention.","Al-Mansour, Khalid",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0258101; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34618851/,159
590931,SARS-CoV-2 tracheitis in laryngectomised patients: A consecutive case-series study,2021,"The role of the environment and climate in the transmission and case-fatality rates of SARS-CoV-2 is still being investigated. Elevation and air quality are believed to be significant factors in the current development of the pandemic, but the influence of additional environmental factors remain unclear. In this study, we explored the relationship between the cumulative number of infections and mortality cases with climate (temperature, precipitation, solar radiation, water vapor pressure, wind), environmental data (elevation, NDVI, PM2.5 and NO2 concentration), and population density in Peru. Using the data from confirmed cases of infection from 1287 districts and confirmed cases of mortality in 479 districts, we used Spearman's correlations to assess the correlation between environmental and climatic factors with cumulative infection cases, cumulative mortality and case-fatality rate. We also explored district cases by the ecozones of coast, sierra, high montane forest and lowland rainforest. Multiple linear regression models indicate elevation, mean solar radiation, air quality, population density and green cover are influential factors in the distribution of infection and mortality of SARS-CoV-2 in Peru. The case-fatality rate was weakly associated with elevation. Our results also strongly suggest that exposure to poor air quality is a significant factor in the mortality of individuals with SARS-CoV-2 below the age of 30. We conclude that environmental and climatic factors do play a significant role in the transmission and case-fatality rates in Peru, however further study is required to see if these relationships are maintained over time.","Samillan, V.

A total of 835 patients diagnosed with COVID‐19 by polymerase chain reaction were included (median age 64 years; 52% female). Of these, 46 (5.5%) had a prescription for an immunosuppressive therapy before diagnosis, most commonly oral steroids (20, 43%), mycophenolate (12, 26%), or tacrolimus (11, 24%). Patients on immunosuppressive therapy with COVID‐19 had increased mortality (30% vs. 17%, p = 0.036; odds ratio 2.1, 95% confidence interval 1.11–4.04), which remained significant (p = 0.040) after performing multivariate logistic regression controlling for gender, age, race, and comorbidity status. Laboratory markers of inflammation were uniformly elevated in both patients on or not on immunosuppressive therapies who died, but lymphocytes and neutrophils were decreased in both COVID‐19 patients on immunosuppressive therapies who died and who remained alive. These findings demonstrate that COVID‐19 disease is more severe in patients taking prior immunosuppressive medications.

We investigated the relationship between COVID-19 incidence and sociodemographic factors in Barcelona at a fine-grained geography. METHODS: This cross-sectional ecological study is based on 10 550 confirmed cases of COVID-19 registered during the first wave in the municipality of Barcelona (population 1.64 million). We considered 16 variables on the demographic structure, urban density, household conditions, socioeconomic status, mobility and health characteristics for 76 geographical units of analysis (neighbourhoods), using a lasso analysis to identify the most relevant variables. We then fitted a multivariate Quasi-Poisson model that explained the COVID-19 incidence by neighbourhood in relation to these variables. RESULTS: Neighbourhoods with: (1) greater population density, (2) an aged population structure, (3) a high presence of nursing homes, (4) high proportions of individuals who left their residential area during lockdown and/or (5) working in health-related occupations were more likely to register a higher number of cases of COVID-19. Conversely, COVID-19 incidence was negatively associated with (6) percentage of residents with post-secondary education and (7) population born in countries with a high Human Development Index. CONCLUSION: Like other historical pandemics, the incidence of COVID-19 is associated with neighbourhood sociodemographic factors with a greater burden faced by already deprived areas. Because urban social and health injustices already existed in those geographical units with higher COVID-19 incidence in Barcelona, the current pandemic is likely to reinforce both health and social inequalities, and urban environmental injustice all together.","López-Gay, Antonio; Spijker, Jeroen; Cole, Helen V S; Marques, Antonio G; Triguero-Mas, Margarita; Anguelovski, Isabelle; Marí-Dell'Olmo, Marc; Módenes, Juan A; Álamo-Junquera, Dolores; López-Gallego, Fernando; Borrell, Carme",J Epidemiol Community Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34158409/; https://doi.org/10.1136/jech-2020-216325,159

We characterized 198 antibodies isolated from four COVID19+ subjects and identified 14 SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies. One targeted the NTD, one recognized an epitope in S2 and eleven bound the RBD. Three anti-RBD neutralizing antibodies cross-neutralized SARS-CoV-1 by effectively blocking binding of both the SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 RBDs to the ACE2 receptor. Using the K18-hACE transgenic mouse model, we demonstrate that the neutralization potency and antibody epitope specificity regulates the in vivo protective potential of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. All four cross-neutralizing antibodies neutralized the B.1.351 mutant strain. Thus, our study reveals that epitopes in S2 can serve as blueprints for the design of immunogens capable of eliciting cross-neutralizing coronavirus antibodies.","Jennewein, Madeleine F.; MacCamy, Anna J.; Akins, Nicholas R.; Feng, Junli; Homad, Leah J.; Hurlburt, Nicholas K.; Seydoux, Emilie; Wan, Yu-Hsin; Stuart, Andrew B.; Edara, Venkata Viswanadh; Floyd, Katharine; Vanderheiden, Abigail; Mascola, John R.; Doria-Rose, Nicole; Wang, Lingshu; Yang, Eun Sung; Chu, Helen Y.; Torres, Jonathan L.; Ozorowski, Gabriel; Ward, Andrew B.; Whaley, Rachael E.; Cohen, Kristen W.; Pancera, Marie; McElrath, M.

The most common symptoms included subjective fever (92%), shortness of breath (85%), and cough (77%). Six patients (46%) required admission to the intensive care unit. Two patients (15%) died during hospitalization. CONCLUSIONS: Black men may be at increased risk for COVID-19 among patients with OHT. Presenting signs and symptoms in this cohort are similar to those in the general population. Elevated inflammatory markers on presentation appear to be associated with more severe illness.","Ketcham, Scott W.; Adie, Sarah K.; Malliett, Ashley; Abdul-Aziz, Ahmad A.; Bitar, Abbas; Grafton, Gillian; Konerman, Matthew C.",J Card Fail,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cardfail.2020.05.008; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1071916420304152; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32417380/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1071916420304152?v=s5,159
594927,"Of mice and men: defining, categorizing and understanding the significance of zoonotic infections",2014-12-12,"Dengue is an acute febrile disease triggered by dengue virus. Dengue is the widespread and rapidly transmitted mosquito-borne viral disease of humans. Diverse symptoms and diseases due to Dengue virus (DENV) infection ranges from dengue fever, dengue hemorrhagic fever (life-threatening) and dengue shock syndrome characterized by shock, endothelial dysfunction and vascular leakage. Several studies have linked the severity of dengue with the induction of inflammasome. DENV activates the NLRP3-specific inflammasome in DENV infected human patients, mice; specifically, mouse bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDMs), dendritic cells, endothelial cells, human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), keratinocytes, monocyte-differentiated macrophages (THP-1), and platelets. Dengue virus mediated inflammasome initiates the maturation of IL-1β and IL-18, which are critical for dengue pathology and inflammatory response. Several studies have reported the molecular mechanism through which (host and viral factors) dengue induces inflammasome, unravels the possible mechanisms of DENV pathogenesis and sets up the stage for the advancement of DENV therapeutics. In this perspective article, we discuss the potential implications and our understanding of inflammasome mechanisms of dengue virus and highlight research areas that have potential to inhibit the pathogenesis of viral diseases, specifically for dengue.","Shrivastava, Gaurav; Valenzuela Leon, Paola Carolina; Calvo, Eric",Front Cell Infect Microbiol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fcimb.2020.00489; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33014899/,159

The aim of the study is to examine the underlying vulnerabilities of Mexican immigrants in New York City (NYC) and Los Angeles (LA), its correspondence with area-level COVID-19 morbidity and mortality, and to document the role of trusted and culturally sensitive services offered during the pandemic through the Ventanillas de Salud (i.e. VDS, Health Windows) program. The study uses a mixed-methods approach including a cross-sectional survey of Mexican immigrants in LA and NYC collected in the Mexican Consulates at the onset of the pandemic, complemented with a georeferencing analysis and key informant interviews. Data suggested an increased vulnerability to COVID-19 given participants reported health status, health care profile and place of residence, which coincided with the georeferencing analysis. The key informant interviews confirmed the vulnerability of this population and the supporting role of VDS in helping immigrants navigate health systems and disseminate health information. Mexican immigrants had an increased vulnerability to COVID-19 at the individual, geographic and systemic levels. Trusted and culturally sensitive services are needed to overcome some of the barriers and risk factors that increase the vulnerability of URM and immigrant populations to COVID-19.

However, limited data are available on cancer patients. Coagulation indexes and inflammation parameters in 57 cancer patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection with different severity were retrospectively analyzed. We found that D-dimer levels were increased in 33 patients (57.9%, median: 790 ng/mL). Compared with ordinary type patients, severe and critical ill patients had decreased MPV values (P = 0.006), prolonged PT (median: 13.3 vs. 11.5 vs. 11.4 s, P < 0.001), significant higher D-dimer levels (median: 2,400 vs. 940 vs. 280 ng/mL, P < 0.001), higher PCT levels (median: 0.17 vs. 0.055 vs. 0.045 ng/mL, P = 0.002), higher IL-6 (median: 20.6 vs. 2.3 vs. 3.0 pg/mL, P = 0.040), and decreased PaO(2) (median: 68 vs. 84 vs. 96 mm Hg, P < 0.001).

However, multicentric studies providing a population‐based perspective are lacking. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective multicentric study at five hospitals in Northern Portugal, representing 45.1% of all hospitalised patients in this region, between 1 March and 30 June 2020. RESULTS: Among 1261 hospitalised COVID‐19 patients, 457 (36.2%) presented neurological manifestations, corresponding to a rate of 357 per 1000 in the North Region. Patients with neurologic manifestations were younger (68.0 vs. 71.2 years, p = 0.002), and the most frequent neurological symptoms were headache (13.4%), delirium (10.1%), and impairment of consciousness (9.7%). Acute well‐defined central nervous system (CNS) involvement was found in 19.1% of patients, corresponding to a rate of 217 per 1000 hospitalised patients in the whole region. Assuming that all patients with severe neurological events were hospitalised, we extrapolated our results to all COVID‐19 patients in the region, estimating that 116 will have a severe neurological event, corresponding to a rate of nine per 1000 (95% CI = 7–11). Overall case fatality in patients presenting neurological manifestations was 19.8%, increasing to 32.6% among those with acute well‐defined CNS involvement. CONCLUSIONS: We characterised the population of hospitalised COVID‐19 patients in Northern Portugal and found that neurological symptoms are common and associated with a high degree of disability at discharge.

Employment and educational outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic were examined in a well-defined cohort of patients receiving care in an early psychosis clinic. METHODS: Data were extracted from the electronic health records of 128 patients receiving care at McLean Hospital's first-episode psychosis (FEP) clinic between January 1 and September 21 in 2019 and 2020. Using a generalized linear model with a Gaussian distribution and robust standard errors, the authors compared the average changes in the weekly employment and education proportions before and after COVID-19 lockdowns with the same changes in 2019. RESULTS: Employment losses among patients with FEP were greater than among the general population and persisted through the end of follow-up. In 2020, average employment after a stay-at-home order was instituted was 33% lower than before the order compared with the change in employment during the same period in 2019. The effect was stronger among men and those who identified as non-White, were age <21 years, or did not have a college education. Although educational engagement recovered in the fall of 2020, it still remained below the 2019 levels. CONCLUSIONS: Employment disruptions were major and persistent among the FEP population, which might affect short- and long-term outcomes. Innovative approaches are needed to help patients transition to remote employment, file unemployment claims, and use online hiring platforms to ameliorate the indirect effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Szmulewicz, Alejandro; Öngür, Dost; Shinn, Ann K; Carol, Emily E; Dow, Jacqueline; Yilmaz, Nergiz; Durning, Peter T; Sastry, Jayram M; Hsu, John",Psychiatr Serv,https://doi.org/10.1176/appi.ps.202100114; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34189932/,159
603960,Host Diagnostic Biomarkers of Infection in the ICU: Where Are We and Where Are We Going?,2021-02-12,"BACKGROUND: Health care workers are at the frontline in the fight against infectious disease, and as a result are at a high risk of infection. During the 2014–2015 Ebola outbreak in West Africa, many health care workers contracted Ebola, some fatally. However, no members of the Chinese Anti-Ebola medical team, deployed to provide vital medical care in Liberia were infected. This study aims to understand how this zero infection rate was achieved. METHODS: Data was collected through 15 in-depth interviews with participants from the People’s Liberation Army of China medical team which operated the Chinese Ebola Treatment Center from October 2014 to January 2015 in Liberia. Data were analysed using systematic framework analysis. RESULTS: This study found numerous bio-psycho-socio-behavioural risk factors that directly or indirectly threatened the health of the medical team working in the Chinese Ebola Treatment Center. These factors included social and emotional stress caused by: (1) the disruption of family and social networks; (2) adapting to a different culture; (3) and anxiety over social and political unrest in Liberia. Exposure to Ebola from patients and local co-workers, and the incorrect use of personal protective equipment due to fatigue was another major risk factor. Other risk factors identified were: (1) shortage of supplies; (2) lack of trained health personnel; (3) exposure to contaminated food and water; (4) and long working hours. Comprehensive efforts were taken throughout the mission to mitigate these factors. Every measure was taken to prevent the medical team’s exposure to the Ebola virus, and to provide the medical team with safe, comfortable working and living environments. There were many challenges in maintaining the health safety of the team, such as the limited capability of the emergency command system (the standardized approach to the command, control, and coordination of an emergency response), and the lack of comprehensive international protocols for dealing with emerging infectious disease pandemics. CONCLUSIONS: The comprehensive and multidisciplinary measures employed to protect the health of the medical team proved successful even in Liberia’s resource-limited setting. The global health community can learn valuable lessons from this experience which could improve the safety of health care workers in future emergencies. These lessons include: establishing capable command systems; implementing effective coordination mechanisms; providing adequate equipment; providing training for medical teams; investing in the development of global health professionals; and improving research on ways to protect health care workers.

Here, starting from the evidence that in Italy, the areas with the lowest number of COVID-19 cases were those with the highest incidence of malaria in the early 1900's, we explore possible inverse relationships between malaria and COVID-19. Indeed, some genetic variants, which have been demonstrated to give an advantage against malaria, can also play a role in the incidence and severity of SARS-CoV-2 infections (e.g., the ACE2 receptor). To verify this scientific hypothesis, we here use public data from whole-genome sequencing (WGS) experiments to extrapolate the genetic information of 46 world populations with matched COVID-19 data. In particular, we focus on 47 genes, including ACE2 and genes which have previously been reported to play a role in malaria. Only common variants (>5%) in at least 30% of the selected populations were considered, and, for this subset, we correlate the intra-population allele frequency with the COVID-19 data (cases/million inhabitants), eventually pinpointing meaningful variants in 6 genes. This study allows us to distinguish between positive and negative correlations, i.e., variants whose frequency significantly increases with increasing or decreasing COVID-19 cases. Finally, we discuss the possible molecular mechanisms associated with these variants and advance potential therapeutic options, which may help fight and/or prevent COVID-19.","Rusmini, Marta; Uva, Paolo; Amoroso, Antonio; Tolomeo, Manlio; Cavalli, Andrea",Front Med (Lausanne),https://doi.org/10.3389/fmed.2021.650231; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33981715/,159

During the COVID-19 pandemic, this study focused on emerging challenges in managing healthy personal protective materials (HPPM) in Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, using silty sand (SM) soil as an example since it covers large areas in KSA and in the whole world. The main objective of this paper is to find a novel way to minimize pandemic-related waste by using HPPM as waste materials in road construction. For the first time, a series of experiments was conducted on a mixture of different percentages of shredded HPPM (0, 0.5, 1 and 2%) added to the silty sand (SM) soil for road applications, including soil classification according to the USCS, modified compaction, UCS, UPV, and CBR. In addition, a numerical simulation was performed using geotechnical-based software Plaxis 3D to study the performance of the soil-HPPM mix as a subbase layer in the paving structure under heavy traffic loading. The modified compaction test results show that there is an increase in the optimum moisture content with increasing the HPPM contents from 0.5% to 1% and 2%. However, a reduction in the maximum dry density is observed. The values of dry density and water content at 0%, 0.5%, 1% and 2% pf HPPM are 2.045, 1.98, 1.86 and 1.8 g/cm(3) and 7.65% 8%, 8.5% and 9.5%, respectively. The soaked CBR values at 0, 0.5, 1 and 2% HPPM are 23, 30, 8, 2% with the maximum value attained with the addition of 0.5% HPPM. The results of UCS were with the same percentages of HPPM 430, 450, 430 and 415 kPa, respectively, with the maximum value attained with 0.5% HPPM addition as well. In contrast, the values of UVP at 0%, 0.5%, 1% and 2% are 978.5, 680.3, 489.4 and 323.6 m/s, respectively, confirming the trends obtained by modified compaction test results. The simulation results confirm this conclusion that the soil-HPPM mix show a superior performance when used as a subbase layer and reduced vertical displacement by a percentage of 11% compared to the normal subbase material. By eliminating HPPM especially facemasks from the landfill lifecycle, incorporating them into high quality construction material production has the potential to deliver significant environmental benefits.","Abdullah, Gamil M.S.; El Aal, Ahmed Abd",J Clean Prod,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095965262102970X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.128772; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S095965262102970X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34518745/,159

608503,"Detection and viral RNA shedding of SARS-CoV-2 in respiratory specimens relative to symptom onset among COVID-19 patients in Bavaria, Germany − Addendum",2021-07-26,AIMS: The aim of this study is to evaluate whether there has been a significant change in the frequency of markedly decomposed bodies having coronial autopsies since the UK’s first COVID-19 lockdown. METHODS: We compared coronial autopsies (n=263) performed by one pathologist at a central London mortuary in the 1 year before and after 23 March 2020 by analysing their autopsy reports and coronial documentation. RESULTS: We have shown that there has been a significant increase of 70.5% (p=0.001) in the frequency of markedly decomposed bodies having coronial autopsies since the first lockdown. This is associated with a 38% increase (p=0.0001) in the rate of those dying at home and a 52.4% decrease (p=0.00003) in the rate of those dying in hospital who go on to have a coronial autopsy in our facility. Our results suggest that the most significant factor behind the increased frequency in advanced decomposition change since the first lockdown is this increase in coronial autopsies for deaths at home relative to deaths in hospital. CONCLUSION: Our results support the idea that perimortem social isolation will lead to an increased frequency of advanced decomposition changes seen at autopsy. We suggest that it could be possible to use the frequency of advanced postmortem decomposition change in a population as a surrogate marker for social isolation in future studies. Our study also illustrates a changing environment where the increasing prevalence of postmortem decomposition changes could affect the accuracy of autopsy reports and the medicolegal consequences thereof.,"Estrin-Serlui, Theodore; Osborn, Michael",J Clin Pathol,https://doi.org/10.1136/jclinpath-2021-207675; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34535567/,159
608535,Human parechovirus: sepsis-like illness with pulmonary infection,2017-07-07,"In evaluating the appropriate response to the COVID-19 pandemic, a key parameter is the rate of substitution between wealth and mortality risk, conventionally summarized as the value per statistical life (VSL). For the United States, VSL is estimated as approximately $10 million, which implies the value of preventing 100,000 COVID-19 deaths is $1 trillion. Is this value too large? There are reasons to think so. First, VSL is a marginal rate of substitution and the potential risk reductions are non-marginal. The standard VSL model implies the rate of substitution of wealth for risk reduction is smaller when the risk reduction is larger, but a closed-form solution calibrated to estimates of the income elasticity of VSL shows the rate of decline is modest until the value of a non-marginal risk reduction accounts for a substantial share of income; average individuals are predicted to be willing to spend more than half their income to reduce one-year mortality risk by 1 in 100. Second, mortality risk is concentrated among the elderly, for whom VSL may be smaller and who would benefit from a persistent risk reduction for a shorter period because of their shorter life expectancy. Third, the pandemic and responses to it have caused substantial losses in income that should decrease VSL. In contrast, VSL is plausibly larger for risks (like COVID-19) that are dreaded, uncertain, catastrophic, and ambiguous. These arguments are evaluated and key issues for improving estimates are highlighted.","Hammitt, James K.",J Risk Uncertain,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11166-020-09338-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33199940/,159

609138,Guillain-Barré Syndrome Outbreak in Peru 2019 Associated With Campylobacter jejuni Infection,2021-02-05,"Introduction: Broad consent for future use is the reuse of data and/or samples collected by a study by researchers who may not be affiliated with the original study team for purposes that may differ from the objectives of the original study. Sharing participant-level data and samples collected from research participants facilitates reuse and transparency and can accelerate drug or vaccine development, research findings, and translation. Data reuse and synthesis help prevent unnecessary research, thereby respecting research participants time and efforts and building their trust in the research process. Despite these myriad benefits, data and sample sharing represent a significant investment of time for the team that collected the data or samples, and may present additional risks for research participants, including that of re-identifiability and incidental findings, or for the source community. This scoping review will summarize existing guidance on broad consent for future use and highlight evidence gaps related to the ethical, equitable implementation of broad consent for future use. Methods and analysis: We will apply the Arskey and O’Malley scoping review methodology and best practice as outlined in the Joanna Briggs scoping review guidelines. The research questions have been identified through a literature review and consultation with subject-matter experts. The systematic search will be conducted in three databases using a tailored search strategy. We will search the reference lists of included articles or related systematic reviews for additional citations. The title-abstract and full text screening and charting the data will be conducted independently by two reviewers. Discrepancies will be resolved by a third reviewer. Results will be summarized in narrative form. Ethics and dissemination: This scoping review summarizes findings from existing publications and grey literature rather than primary data and, as such, does not require ethics review. Findings will be disseminated through an open access publication and webinar.","Maxwell, Lauren; Gilyan, Regina; Chavan, Sayali Arvind; Merson, Laura; Saxena, Abha; Terry, Rob",F1000Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33953907/; https://doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.51312.1,159
609490,Antibody response to first and second dose of BNT162b2 in a cohort of characterized healthcare workers,2021-03-26,"Different viruses can be responsible for similar clinical manifestations of respiratory infections. Thus, the etiological diagnosis of respiratory viral diseases requires the detection of a large number of viruses. In this study, 6 duplex real-time PCR assays, using EvaGreen intercalating dye, were developed to detect 12 major viruses responsible for respiratory diseases: influenza A and B viruses, enteroviruses (including enterovirus spp, and rhinovirus spp), respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, coronaviruses group I (of which CoV 229E and CoV NL63 are part) and II (including CoV OC43 and CoV HKU1), parainfluenza viruses type 1, 2, 3 and 4, human adenoviruses and human bocaviruses. The 2 target viruses of each duplex reaction were distinguishable by the melting temperatures of their amplicons. The 6 duplex real time PCR assays were applied for diagnostic purpose on 202 respiratory samples from 157 patients. One hundred fifty-seven samples were throat swabs and 45 were bronchoalveolar lavages. The results of the duplex PCR assays were confirmed by comparison with a commercial, validated, assay; in addition, the positive results were confirmed by sequencing. The analytical sensitivity of the duplex PCR assays varied from 10(3) copies/ml to 10(4) copies/ml. For parainfluenza virus 2 only it was 10(5) copies/ml. Seventy clinical samples (35%) from 55 patients (30 children and 25 adults) were positive for 1 or more viruses. In adult patients, influenza A virus was the most frequently detected respiratory virus followed by rhinoviruses. In contrast, respiratory syncytial virus was the most common virus in children, followed by enteroviruses, influenza A virus and coronavirus NL63. The small number of samples/patients does not allow us to draw any epidemiological conclusion. Altogether, the results of this study indicate that the 6 duplex PCR assays described in this study are sensitive, specific and cost-effective. Thus, this assay could be particularly useful to identify the main respiratory viruses directly from clinical samples, after nucleic acid extraction, and, also, to screen a large number of patients for epidemiological studies.","Arvia, Rosaria; Corcioli, Fabiana; Ciccone, Nunziata; Della Malva, Nunzia; Azzi, Alberta",Mol Cell Probes,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26334289/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mcp.2015.08.006; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0890850815300323; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0890850815300323,159

Methodology We conducted a retrospective review of electronic records for demographic, clinical and laboratory data, imaging and outcomes for 500 hospitalised patients between February 20th and May 7th 2020 from Southend University Hospital, Essex, UK. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to identify risk factors relevant to outcome. Results The mean age of the cohort admitted to hospital with Covid-19, was 69.4 and 290 (58%) were over 70. The majority were Caucasians, 437 (87%) with less than 2 co-morbidities 280(56%). Most common were hypertension 186(37 %), Cardiovascular disease 178(36 %) and Diabetes 128 (26 %), represented in a larger proportion on the mortality group. Mean CFS was 4 with Non Survivors had significantly higher CFS 5 vs 3 in survivors, p<0.001. In addition, Mean CRP was significantly higher 150 vs 90, p<0.001 in Non Survivors. We observed the baseline predictors for mortality were age, CFS and CRP. Conclusions In this single centre study, older and frailer patients with more comorbidities and a higher baseline CRP and creatinine were risk factors for worse outcomes. Integrated frailty and age based risk stratification are essential, in addition to monitoring SFR (Sp02/Fi02) and inflammatory markers throughout the disease course to allow for early intervention to improve patient outcomes.","Koduri, G.; Gokaraju, S.; Darda, M.; Warrier, V.; Duta, I.; Hayes, F.; El Sayed, I.; Ahmed, Y.

Golfers (Study 1: n = 298, Study 2: n = 124) ≥16 years old residing in the UK participated in this study which collected data using online surveys. Study 1 was conducted during a period of quarantine restrictions (4–12th May 2020), whilst study 2 took place following the easing of the COVID-19 quarantine restrictions (6–14th July 2020). Within study 1 and study 2, key variables of interest levels were also collected to investigate the association with golf related activities. The findings of study 1 highlighted that negligible and non-significant correlations were observed between golf physical and sedentary activities and key variables of interest (r < 0.3, p > 0.05) except sense of belonging and sedentary golf activities (r = 0.178, p = 0.003). Study 2 highlighted that sense of belonging, enjoyment and wellbeing were significantly associated with outdoor golf course activity (r = 0.186–0.252, p ≤ 0.05). Furthermore, when comparing study 1 and study 2, sense of belonging and life satisfaction significantly improved (p < 0.05, d = 0.2). Based on these findings, playing golf on outdoor golf courses appears to be positively related to sense of belonging, enjoyment and wellbeing. Also, with the reopening of golf courses life satisfaction improved which, together, highlights the beneficial impact that outdoor golf can impart.","Sorbie, Graeme G.; Beaumont, Alexander J.; Williams, Ashley K.; Glen, Jonathan; Hardie, Scott M.; Lavallee, David",Front Sports Act Living,https://doi.org/10.3389/fspor.2021.622171; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33604568/,159

Emotional and social support are essential to help people to get through personal crises such as bereavement. In this study we characterize the social support owners obtain from their dogs, provide evidence of how widespread this social support is amongst dog-owners, and show how social support from dogs can increase during a crisis (using the COVID-19 pandemic as an example). We collected data from a representative population-based sample of Spanish dog-owners and found that most respondents said that their dogs helped them to get through tough times. They got comfort from physical contact with their dogs, shared activities with them and treated them as confidants in a similar way to friends and family. These are all key aspects of social support, and dogs offer the advantage of being more available than human sources of support. It would be expected that the support that dogs provide would be increased during a time of personal crisis and when we looked at data collected from a convenience sample of Spanish dog-owners during the COVID-19 confinement that is what we found; during the confinement owners engaged in more shared activities with their dogs, hugged them more often and turned to them more as a source of companionship and comfort (p < 0.0001 in all cases). However, although owners did confide more in their dogs (p < 0.0001), the effect was not as great as for other aspects of social support. We suspect that this is because people were able to use telecommunications such as video conferencing to maintain their human confidant relationships. Our findings indicate that dogs can substitute for humans as sources of some kinds of social support when conventional sources are unavailable. Our conclusion is that where a dog is present in a household, it should be regarded as an important resource for social support. This should be considered when designing clinical interventions and when public health decisions are being made.","Bowen, Jonathan; Bulbena, Antonio; Fatjó, Jaume",Front Psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.622060; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33935828/,159

In Ecuador, the first case of COVID-19 was recorded on 29 February 2020. Despite efforts to control its spread, SARS-CoV-2 overran the Ecuadorian public health system, which became one of the most affected in Latin America on 24 April 2020. The Hospital General del Sur de Quito (HGSQ) had to transition from a general to a specific COVID-19 health center in a short period of time to fulfill the health demand from patients with respiratory afflictions. Here, we summarized the implementations applied in the HGSQ to become a COVID-19 exclusive hospital, including the rearrangement of hospital rooms and a triage strategy based on a severity score calculated through an artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted chest computed tomography (CT). Moreover, we present clinical, epidemiological, and laboratory data from 75 laboratory tested COVID-19 patients, which represent the first outbreak of Quito city. The majority of patients were male with a median age of 50 years. We found differences in laboratory parameters between intensive care unit (ICU) and non-ICU cases considering C-reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase, and lymphocytes. Sensitivity and specificity of the AI-assisted chest CT were 21.4% and 66.7%, respectively, when considering a score >70%; regardless, this system became a cornerstone of hospital triage due to the lack of RT-PCR testing and timely results. If health workers act as vectors of SARS-CoV-2 at their domiciles, they can seed outbreaks that might put 1,879,047 people at risk of infection within 15 km around the hospital.

Vitamin A has been used successfully in measles, RSV, and AIDS patients and is an effective vaccine adjuvant. In this study, low retinol levels were found in patients with severe COVID-19. Retinoid signaling impairment in COVID-19 disrupts Type-I interferon synthesis. Material and Method: Two groups were formed in the study. The patient group consisted of 27 (Group 1) severe COVID-19 patients hospitalized in the intensive care unit with respiratory failure, and the control group consisted of 23 (Group 2) patients without COVID-19 symptoms. Serum retinol levels were analyzed by ELIZA and HPLC in both groups. Findings: Retinol levels were found to be significantly lower in the patient group (P <0.001). There was no difference in retinol between two different age groups in the patient group (P> 0.05). There was no significant difference in retinol between men and women (P> 0.05). Comorbidity did not affect serum retinol levels (P >0.05). Conclusion: Serum retinol levels were low in patients with severe COVID-19. Drugs preventing retinol excretion were not stopped in the patient group. Some patients took vitamin A externally. Despite this, retinol was low in COVID-19 patients. Retinol depletion impairs Type-I interferon synthesis by impairing retinoid signaling. Retinoid signaling may be the main pathogenetic disorder in COVID-19. This pathogenesis can serve as a guide for adjuvants, drug targets, and candidate drugs. Retinol, retinoic acid derivatives, and some CYP450 inhibitors may work on COVID-19.","Sarohan, A.

After its inception, the virus proliferated rapidly, which led to the cause of millions of deaths, and having a detrimental effect on physical health, social lives, economic uncertainty, and mental health of people. The World Health Organization has reported that there are 111 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 2.45 million deaths due to COVID-19 worldwide. Indisputably, the present pandemic has contributed to the extensive psychological and environmental distress together with clinical depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), domestic violence, and unemployment. Due to the ambiguous nature of the pandemic, educational organizations, and outdoor activities are closed, thus burdening the mental health of younger populations. Children as well as youths are more glued to the Internet for their studies, online gaming, shopping, watching movies, and searching health-related information. Despite the advantages of using the Internet, it has some severe consequences too. Some people are repeatedly searching for physical and mental well-being related information without verifying credible sources, which, in turn, causes distress and anxiety. In such situations, individuals may end up contributing to an illness known as cyberchondria. In this paper, we have tried to highlight the problematic use of Internet for health-related searches and have outlined the management of such illness. We suggest two strategies: firstly, to reduce repeated online searches of health information and, secondly, to manage anxiety-augmenting thoughts that are triggered due to the maladaptive thoughts caused by the abstruse information.","Varma, Rahul; Das, Sreeja; Singh, Tushar",Front Psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.618508; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33995143/,159

These strategies however carry a significant risk for mental health which can lead to increased short-term and long-term mortality, which is currently not included in modelling the impact of the pandemic. Methods: We used years of life lost (YLL) as the main outcome measure as applied to Switzerland as an exemplar. We focused on suicide, depression, alcohol use disorder, childhood physical abuse and social isolation as these are known to increase YLL in the context of imposed restriction in social contact and freedom of movement. We also estimated a minimum duration of mitigation of 3 months based on current public health plans. Results: The study projects that the average person would suffer 0.205 YLL due to psychosocial consequence of COVID-19 mitigation measures. However, this loss would be entirely borne by a subpopulation of 2.1 percent of the population, the average of whom suffer an average 9.79 YLL. Conclusions: The results presented here are likely to underestimate the true impact of the mitigation strategies on YLL. However, model like the one presented here highlight the need for public health models to expand their scope in order to provide better estimates of the risks and benefits of mitigation.","Moser, D.

Objective To quantify particle aerosolization during tracheostomy surgery and tracheostomy care and to evaluate interventions that minimize the risk of viral particle exposure. Design, Setting, and Participants This comparative effectiveness study was conducted from August 2020 to January 2021 at a tertiary care academic institution. Aerosol generation was measured in real time with an optical particle counter during simulated (manikin) tracheostomy surgical and clinical conditions, including cough, airway nebulization, open suctioning, and electrocautery. Aerosol sampling was also performed during in vivo swine tracheostomy procedures (n = 4), with or without electrocautery. Fluorescent dye was used to visualize cough spread onto the surgical field during swine tracheostomy. Finally, 6 tracheostomy coverings were compared with no tracheostomy covering to quantify reduction in particle aerosolization. Main Outcomes and Measures Respirable aerosolized particle concentration. Results Cough, airway humidification, open suctioning, and electrocautery produced aerosol particles substantially above baseline. Compared with uncovered tracheostomy, decreased aerosolization was found with the use of tracheostomy coverings, including a cotton mask (73.8% [(95% CI, 63.0%-84.5%]; d = 3.8), polyester gaiter 79.5% [95% CI, 68.7%-90.3%]; d = 7.2), humidification mask (82.8% [95% CI, 72.0%-93.7%]; d = 8.6), heat moisture exchanger (HME) (91.0% [95% CI, 80.2%-101.7%]; d = 19.0), and surgical mask (89.9% [95% CI, 79.3%-100.6%]; d = 12.8). Simultaneous use of a surgical mask and HME decreased the particle concentration compared with either the HME (95% CI, 1.6%-12.3%; Cohen d = 1.2) or surgical mask (95% CI, 2.7%-13.2%; d = 1.9) used independently. Procedures performed with electrocautery increased total aerosolized particles by 1500 particles/m3 per 5-second interval (95% CI, 1380-1610 particles/m3 per 5-second interval; d = 1.8). Conclusions and Relevance The findings of this laboratory and animal comparative effectiveness study indicate that tracheostomy surgery and tracheostomy care are associated with significant aerosol generation, putting health care workers at risk for viral transmission of airborne diseases. Combined HME and surgical mask coverage of the tracheostomy was associated with decreased aerosolization, thereby reducing the risk of viral transmission to health care workers.","Berges, Alexandra J; Lina, Ioan A; Ospino, Rafael; Tsai, Hsiu-Wen; Brenner, Michael J; Pandian, Vinciya; Rule, Ana M; Hillel, Alexander T",JAMA otolaryngology-- head & neck surgery,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34292321/; https://doi.org/10.1001/jamaoto.2021.1383,159
616517,Duration of SARS-CoV-2 sero-positivity in a large longitudinal sero-surveillance cohort: the COVID-19 Community Research Partnership,2021-08-30,"The pandemic associated with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV2) and its disease named COVID-19 challenged the scientific community to discover effective therapeutic solutions in a short period. Repurposing existing drugs is one viable approach that emphasizes speed during these urgent times. Famotidine, a class A G protein-coupled receptor antagonist used for the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux was recently identified in an in silico screening. Additionally, a recent retrospective clinical report showed that the treatment with famotidine provided a good outcome in patients infected with SARS-CoV2. A clinical trial testing effectiveness of famotidine in combination with hydroxychloroquine is currently ongoing in the United States (US). In the 1990s, famotidine was described as an antiviral agent against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Interestingly, some HIV protease inhibitors are presently being used against SARS-CoV2. However, it is not clear if famotidine could be effective against SARS-CoV2. Thus, by using a computational analysis, we aimed to examine if the antiviral effect of famotidine could be related to the inhibition of proteases involved in the virus replication. Our results showed that famotidine could interact within the catalytic site of the three proteases associated with SARS-CoV2 replication. However, weak binding affinity of famotidine to these proteases suggests that a successful famotidine therapy could likely be achieved only in combination with other antiviral drugs. Finally, analysis of famotidine’s pharmacokinetic parameters indicated that its effect against SARS-CoV2 infection could be reached only upon intravenous administration. This work will contribute to the pharmacological knowledge of famotidine as an antiviral agent against SARS-CoV2.","Ortega, Joseph T.; Serrano, Maria Luisa; Jastrzebska, Beata",Biomolecules,https://doi.org/10.3390/biom10060954; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32599963/,159

The serum delta neutrophil index (DNI) reflects the fraction of circulating immature granulocytes and is evaluated in infection and inflammation. The aim of this study is to evaluate the usefulness of DNI as a diagnostic marker in patients with MIS-C and to assess its role in determining the severity of MIS-C. This retrospective, observational study included 83 patients with MIS-C and 113 patients with COVID-19, and 102 healthy controls. C-reactive protein (CRP), the absolute neutrophil count (ANC), absolute lymphocyte count (ALC), DNI, and the platelet count were recorded. The DNI levels were 4.60 ± 5.70% in the MIS C group, 0.30 ± 0.99% in the COVID group, and 0.20 ± 0.56% in the control group (p < 0.001). According to the severity of MIS-C, the DNI level was found to be 1.22% in mild MIS-C, 4.3% in moderate MIS-C, and 5.7% in severe MIS-C. There was a statistically significant correlation between DNI levels and the severity of MIS-C. The cutoff value of DNI for predicting MIS-C was 0.45%. In the analysis of the diagnostic performance of DNI compared with CRP, ANC, ALC and platelet counts, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were found to be 79.5%, 97.1%, 95.7%, and 85.3%, respectively. Conclusions: The delta neutrophil index was identified as a diagnostic marker for MIS-C such as ANC, ALC, platelet count, and CRP. DNI levels in hemogram analysis may guide clinicians in determining the diagnosis and severity of MIS-C.","Karagol, Cuneyt; Tehci, Ali Kansu; Gungor, Ali; Ekici Tekin, Zahide; Çelikel, Elif; Aydın, Fatma; Kurt, Tuba; Sezer, Müge; Tekgöz, Nilüfer; Coşkun, Serkan; Kaplan, Melike Mehveş; Bayhan, Gulsum Iclal; Yaralı, Husniye Nese; Ozbek, Namuk Yasar; Çelikel Acar, Banu",Eur J Pediatr,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00431-021-04281-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34647164/,159

622383,Neutralizing Antibody Responses After SARS-CoV-2 Infection in End-Stage Kidney Disease and Protection Against Reinfection,2021-04-28,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was first reported in Wuhan in December 2019 and has rapidly spread across different cities within and outside China. Hong Kong started to prepare for COVID-19 on 31(st) December 2019 and infection control measures in public hospitals were tightened to limit nosocomial transmission within healthcare facilities. However, the recommendations on the transmission-based precautions required for COVID-19 in hospital settings vary from droplet and contact precautions, to contact and airborne precautions with placement of patients in airborne infection isolation rooms. AIM: To describe an outbreak investigation of a patient with COVID-19 who was nursed in an open cubicle of a general ward before the diagnosis was made. METHOD: Contacts were identified and risk categorized as ‘close’ or ‘casual’ for decisions on quarantine and/or medical surveillance. Respiratory specimens were collected from contacts who developed fever, and/or respiratory symptoms during the surveillance period and were tested for SARS-CoV-2. FINDINGS: A total of 71 staff and 49 patients were identified from contact tracing, seven staff and 10 patients fulfilled the criteria of ‘close contact’. At the end of 28-day surveillance, 76 tests were performed on 52 contacts and all were negative, including all patient close contacts and six of the seven staff close contacts. The remaining contacts were asymptomatic throughout the surveillance period. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 is not spread by an airborne route, and nosocomial transmissions can be prevented through vigilant basic infection control measures, including wearing of surgical masks, hand and environmental hygiene.","Wong, S.C.-Y.; Kwong, R.T.-S.; Wu, T.C.; Chan, J.W.M.; Chu, M.Y.; Lee, S.Y.; Wong, H.Y.; Lung, D.C.",J Hosp Infect,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0195670120301742; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhin.2020.03.036; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32259546/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0195670120301742?v=s5,159
623000,SARS-CoV-2 Infection in the Heart Transplant Recipient,2020-10-13,"BACKGROUND: Smoking is a plausible risk factor for COVID-19 progression and complications. Smoking cessation digital platforms transcend pandemic-driven social distancing and lockdown measures in terms of assisting smokers in their quit attempts. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to examine trends in the number of visitors, followers, and subscribers on smoking cessation digital platforms from January to April 2020 and to compare these traffic data to those observed during the same 4-month period in 2019. The examination of prepandemic and postpandemic trends in smoking cessation digital platform traffic can reveal whether interest in smoking cessation among smokers is attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We obtained cross-sectional data from daily visitors on the SmokeFree website; the followers of six SmokeFree social media accounts; and subscribers to the SmokeFree SMS text messaging and mobile app interventions of the National Cancer Institute’s SmokeFree.gov initiative platforms, which are publicly available to US smokers. Average daily percentage changes (ADPCs) were used to measure trends for the entire 2020 and 2019 study periods, whereas daily percentage changes (DPCs) were used to measure trends for each time segment of change within each 4-month period. Data analysis was conducted in May and June 2020. RESULTS: The number of new daily visitors on the SmokeFree website (between days 39 and 44: DPC=18.79%; 95% CI 5.16% to 34.19%) and subscribers to the adult-focused interventions QuitGuide (between days 11 and 62: DPC=1.11%; 95% CI 0.80% to 1.43%) and SmokeFreeTXT (between days 11 and 89: DPC=0.23%; 95% CI 0.004% to 0.47%) increased, but this was followed by declines in traffic. No comparable peaks were observed in 2019. The number of new daily subscribers to quitSTART (ie, the teen-focused intervention) trended downward in 2020 (ADPC=−1.02%; 95% CI −1.88% to −0.15%), whereas the overall trend in the number of subscribers in 2019 was insignificant (P=.07). The number of SmokeFree social media account followers steadily increased by <0.1% over the 4-month study periods in 2019 and 2020. CONCLUSIONS: Peaks in traffic on the SmokeFree website and adult-focused intervention platforms in 2020 could be attributed to an increased interest in smoking cessation among smokers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Coordinated campaigns, especially those for adolescents, should emphasize the importance of smoking cessation as a preventive measure against SARS-CoV-2 infection and raise awareness of digital smoking cessation platforms to capitalize on smokers’ heightened interest during the pandemic.","El-Toukhy, Sherine",J Med Internet Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33646963/; https://doi.org/10.2196/24593,159
623341,Dramatic drop of new SARS-CoV-2 infections among health care workers after the first dose of the BNT162b2 mRNA Covid-19 Vaccine,2021-03-26,"Background: Since the beginning of COVID19 pandemic, cancer patients were considered to be more susceptible to contract SARCOV2 due to their underlying disease, greater immunosuppression and comorbidities. This higher risk forced oncologist on March 2020 to switch to telehealth without previous knowledge on this field. The aim of this study is to review our experience with telemedicine during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Patients attended by a telephonic and/or an in-person visit in the Medical Oncology Service at Parc Taulí Hospital Universitari between March 13 to April 30 2020 were included. Characteristics of recruited patients were summarized using descriptive analysis. The study was approved by the Research Ethic Committee. Results: 855 patients were attended. 24.4 % had an in-person visit, 63.2 % had a phone call visit and 12.4 % both types. Median age was 65,48 [26-94] years old. 48.7% were male. 65.4% ECOG 0. Cancer types were: 41,8 % Colorectal, 12,7% Gastrointestinal non-colorectal, 12% Lung, 21,3 % Breast and 12.2 % Others. Most patients (52.4%) had a follow-up visit. 26.4 % were receiving palliative treatment and the most frequent administered drug was chemotherapy (51.2%). Telephonic appointments were mainly follow-up visits (63.7%), used for older patients (median age 66 years) with colorectal and breast cancers (42.7 % and 24.3% respectively), ECOG 0 (65.4%) and stage I, II and III disease (73.9%). In contrast, in-person appointments were mostly treatment visits (84.1%), for younger patients (median age 63.4 years) with stage IV disease (60%), ECOG ≥ 1 (51.7%) and colorectal cancer (35,9%). The proportion of patients with non-colorectal and thoracic cancers was higher when compared to telephonic assistance (40.6 % vs 19.4% respectively). The differences between the two types of visit were statistically significant (p<0.0001). Conclusions: Without a robust scientific basis or previous experience, it seems that during the first period of COVID-19 pandemic oncologist felt more comfortable with face-to-face appointments when visiting patients with stage IV disease and/or ECOG ≥ 1 that were receiving palliative treatment. These patients attended more to the hospital despite having a higher mortality for COVID19. Legal entity responsible for the study: The authors. Funding: Has not received any funding. Disclosure: S.

It started in December 2019 and has, so far, led to more than 149, 470,968 cases, 3,152,121 deaths, and 127,133,013 survivors recovered by 28 April 2021. COVID-19 has a high morbidity, and mortality of 2%, on average, whereas most people are treated after a period of time. Some people who recover from COVID-19 are left with 20 to 30% decreased lung function. In this context, exercise focused on skeletal muscle with minimal lung involvement could potentially play an important role. Regular exercise protects against diseases associated with chronic low-grade systemic inflammation. This long-term effect of exercise may be ascribed to the anti-inflammatory response elicited by an acute bout of exercise, which is partly mediated by muscle-derived myokines. The isometric training system seems to have this feature, because this system is involved with the skeletal muscle as the target tissue. However, no studies have examined the effect of exercise on the treatment and recovery of COVID-19, and, more importantly, “muscle–lung cross-talk” as a mechanism for COVID-19 treatment. It is suggested that this theoretical construct be examined by researchers.","Nobari, Hadi; Fashi, Mohamad; Eskandari, Arezoo; Pérez-Gómez, Jorge; Suzuki, Katsuhiko",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34200791/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18126304,159

Here we conducted a retrospective, single center study involving a large cohort of SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals to address this issue. Patients and Methods: A total of 1,184 consecutive subjects (256 children and 928 adults) testing positive for SARS-COV-2 RNA in nasopharyngeal exudates (NP) were included, of whom 424 (121 children and 303 adults) had COVID-19 not requiring hospitalization and 760 (135 children and 625 adults) were asymptomatic close contacts of COVID-19 patients. SARS-CoV-2 RNA testing was carried out using the TaqPath COVID-19 Combo Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MS, USA). The AMPLIRUN TOTAL SARS-CoV-2 RNA Control (Vircell SA, Granada, Spain) was used for estimating SARS-CoV-2 RNA loads (in copies/mL). Results: Median SARS-COV-2 RNA loads were comparable between adults and children with COVID-19 (7.14 log10 copies/ml vs. 6.98 log10 copies/ml; P=0.094). Median SARS-CoV-2 RNA load in asymptomatic children and adults was similar (6.20 log10 copies/ml vs. 6.48 log10 copies/ml; P=0.97). Children with COVID-19 symptoms displayed SARS-CoV-2 RNA loads comparable to their asymptomatic counterparts (P=0.61). Meanwhile in adults, median SARS-CoV-2 RNA load was significantly higher in symptomatic than in asymptomatic subjects (P=<0.001), yet comparable (P=0.61) when the analysis excluded patients sampled within 48 h after symptoms onset. Conclusions: The data suggest that children may be drivers of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the general population at the same level as adults.","Costa, R.; Bueno, F.; Albert, E.; Torres, I.; Carbonell-Sahuquillo, S.; Barres-Fernandez, A.; Sanchez, D.; Padron, C.; Colomina, J.; Lazaro-Carreno, M.

Disease extent on CT has been reported to influence prognosis. PURPOSE: To create a large publicly available dataset and assess the diagnostic and prognostic value of CT in COVID-19 pneumonia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This multicenter observational retrospective cohort study (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04355507) involved 20 French university hospitals. Eligible subjects presented at the emergency departments of the hospitals involved between March 1st and April 30th, 2020 and underwent both thoracic CT and RT-PCR for suspected COVID-19 pneumonia. CT images were read blinded to initial reports, RT-PCR, demographic characteristics, clinical symptoms, and outcome. Readers classified CT scans as positive or negative for COVID-19, based on criteria published by the French Society of Radiology. Multivariable logistic regression was used to develop a model predicting severe outcome (intubation or death) at 1-month follow-up in subjects positive for both RT-PCR and CT, using clinical and radiological features. RESULTS: Of 10,930 subjects screened for eligibility, 10,735 (median age 65 years, interquartile range, 51–77 years; 6,147 men) were included and 6,448 (60.0%) had a positive RT-PCR result. With RT-PCR as reference, the sensitivity and specificity and CT were 80.2% (95%CI: 79.3, 81.2) and 79.7% (95%CI: 78.5, 80.9), respectively with strong agreement between junior and senior radiologists (Gwet’s AC1 coefficient: 0.79) Of all the variables analysed, the extent of pneumonia on CT (OR 3.25, 95%CI: 2.71, 3.89) was the best predictor of severe outcome at one month. A score based solely on clinical variables predicted a severe outcome with an AUC of 0.64 (95%CI: 0.62, 0.66), improving to 0.69 (95%CI: 0.6, 0.71) when it also included the extent of pneumonia and coronary calcium score on CT. CONCLUSION: Using pre-defined criteria, CT reading is not influenced by reader’s experience and helps predict the outcome at one month.

624473,A comparison study between GeXP-based multiplex-PCR and serology assay for Mycoplasma pneumoniae detection in children with community acquired pneumonia,2017-07-25,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to high mortality rates in nursing homes (NHs) in Europe. For adequate risk management and good prognostications, it is essential to identify mortality risk factors. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine whether previously identified risk factors for 30-day mortality in Dutch NH residents with COVID-19 are unique to COVID-19. METHODS: In this cohort study, we included 1,294 NH residents with COVID-19 (cases) and 17,999 NH residents without COVID-19 (controls, from the pre-COVID-19 period). We used descriptive statistics and Cox proportional hazard models to compare mortality rates in residents with and without COVID-19, categorized by risk factors. RESULTS: Cases had a more than 18 times higher hazard of death within 30 days compared to controls (HR 18, 95%CI: 16-20). For residents with COVID-19, being male, having dementia, and having Parkinson's disease (PD) were all associated with a higher 30-day mortality (HR 1.8 versus 1.3 versus 1.7). Being male was also associated with a higher mortality (HR 1.7) in the control group, whereas having dementia and PD were not. COVID-19 symptomatology was very similar for residents with and without dementia or PD, except for delirium and malaise which was more frequent in residents with dementia. CONCLUSION: Dementia and PD were significant additional risk factors for mortality in Dutch NH residents with COVID-19, whereas male gender was not unique to residents with COVID-19. The frailty of PD and dementia in NH residents with COVID-19 are relevant to consider in prognostication, communication, and care planning with residents and their families.","Rutten, Jeanine J S; van Kooten, Janine; van Loon, Anouk M; van Buul, Laura W; Joling, Karlijn J; Smalbrugge, Martin; Hertogh, Cees M P M",J. alzheimers dis,https://doi.org/10.3233/jad-210319; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34542068/,159

It is now known that poor glucose control before hospital admission can be associated with a high risk of in-hospital death. By achieving and maintaining glycemic control, primary care physicians (PCPs) play a critical role in limiting this potentially devastating outcome. Further, despite the hope that mass vaccination will help control the pandemic, genetic variants of the virus are causing surges in some countries. As such, PCPs will treat an increasing number of patients with diabetes who have symptoms of post-COVID-19 infection, or even have new-onset type 2 diabetes as a result of COVID-19 infection. However, much of the literature published focuses on the effects of COVID-19 in hospitalized patients, with few publications providing information and advice to those caring for people with diabetes in the primary care setting. This manuscript reviews the current knowledge of the risk and outcomes of individuals with diabetes who are infected with COVID-19 and provides information for PCPs on the importance of glucose control, appropriate treatment, and use of telemedicine and online prescription delivery systems to limit the potentially devastating effects of COVID-19 in people with hyperglycemia.","Pettus, Jeremy; Skolnik, Neil",Postgraduate medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34602003/; https://doi.org/10.1080/00325481.2021.1978704,159

For sustained production of animals products, healthy livestock and poultry farming are the major concerns as animals are susceptible to various infectious agents viz. bacteria, virus, and parasites leading to huge economical losses in the form of livestock’s morbidity and mortality. Besides, zoonotic nature of some infectious pathogens of animals is also raising concern for human safety. Vaccination of animals against various diseases present in different geographical regions is a best known strategy for prevention of different disease outbreaks both in organized and unorganized livestock and poultry sectors. Vaccines had played a major role in eradication of different dreaded diseases of livestock sectors globally. In this article we have discussed different vaccine types, various vaccine strategies used for the development of more efficacious and safe vaccines and commercially available vaccines for livestock and poultry.","Nimmanapalli, Ramadevi; Gupta, Vikas","Genomics and Biotechnological Advances in Veterinary, Poultry, and Fisheries",https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780128163528000205; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128163528000205,159

Relying on the job demands-resources model and the positive affective spillover effect, the aim of this study was to investigate the mediated relationship of family support, work engagement and subjective well-being, and the moderating effect of religious attendance on the mediated relationship. Methods: A cross-sectional research design was adopted. Mediation and moderated mediation were tested using the PROCESS macro v3.5 for the SPSS supplement. Purposive sampling was used for the distribution of questionnaires to high-technology employees in Taiwan. Results: Results from the data of 603 high-technology employees indicated that family support, work engagement, and subjective well-being exhibited a significant mediated relationship, and the mediated relationship was stronger among individuals with religious attendance experience. Conclusions: This study emphasizes the driving effect of family support on high-technology employee well-being and the moderating effect of religious attendance as a situational strength. We recommend closely attending to employee well-being because doing so is conducive to both the personal quality of life of employees and the sustainable development of organizations.","Huang, Ing-Chung; Du, Pey-Lan; Lin, Long-Sheng; Lin, Tsai-Fei; Kuo, Shu-Chun",Healthcare (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare9050602; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34069946/,159

625593,"General hospital staff worries, perceived sufficiency of information and associated psychological distress during the A/H1N1 influenza pandemic",2010-11-09,"BACKGROUND: In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the UK first adopted physical distancing measures in March, 2020. Vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 became available in December, 2020. We explored the health and economic value of introducing SARS-CoV-2 immunisation alongside physical distancing in the UK to gain insights about possible future scenarios in a post-vaccination era. METHODS: We used an age-structured dynamic transmission and economic model to explore different scenarios of UK mass immunisation programmes over 10 years. We compared vaccinating 75% of individuals aged 15 years or older (and annually revaccinating 50% of individuals aged 15–64 years and 75% of individuals aged 65 years or older) to no vaccination. We assumed either 50% vaccine efficacy against disease and 45-week protection (worst-case scenario) or 95% vaccine efficacy against infection and 3-year protection (best-case scenario). Natural immunity was assumed to wane within 45 weeks. We also explored the additional impact of physical distancing on vaccination by assuming either an initial lockdown followed by voluntary physical distancing, or an initial lockdown followed by increased physical distancing mandated above a certain threshold of incident daily infections. We considered benefits in terms of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and costs, both to the health-care payer and the national economy. We discounted future costs and QALYs at 3·5% annually and assumed a monetary value per QALY of £20 000 and a conservative long-run cost per vaccine dose of £15. We explored and varied these parameters in sensitivity analyses. We expressed the health and economic benefits of each scenario with the net monetary value: QALYs × (monetary value per QALY) – costs. FINDINGS: Without the initial lockdown, vaccination, and increased physical distancing, we estimated 148·0 million (95% uncertainty interval 48·5–198·8) COVID-19 cases and 3·1 million (0·84–4·5) deaths would occur in the UK over 10 years. In the best-case scenario, vaccination minimises community transmission without future periods of increased physical distancing, whereas SARS-CoV-2 becomes endemic with biannual epidemics in the worst-case scenario. Ongoing transmission is also expected in intermediate scenarios with vaccine efficacy similar to published clinical trial data. From a health-care perspective, introducing vaccination leads to incremental net monetary values ranging from £12·0 billion to £334·7 billion in the best-case scenario and from –£1·1 billion to £56·9 billion in the worst-case scenario. Incremental net monetary values of increased physical distancing might be negative from a societal perspective if national economy losses are persistent and large. INTERPRETATION: Our model findings highlight the substantial health and economic value of introducing SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. Smaller outbreaks could continue even with vaccines, but population-wide implementation of increased physical distancing might no longer be justifiable. Our study provides early insights about possible future post-vaccination scenarios from an economic and epidemiological perspective.

In this method, DNA or messenger RNA (mRNA) sequences are delivered to the body to generate proteins, which mimic disease antigens to stimulate the immune response. Advantages of nucleic acid vaccines include stimulation of both cell‐mediated and humoral immunity, ease of design, rapid adaptability to changing pathogen strains, and customizable multiantigen vaccines. To combat the SARS‐CoV‐2 pandemic, and many other diseases, nucleic acid vaccines appear to be a promising method. However, aid is needed in delivering the fragile DNA/mRNA payload. Many delivery strategies have been developed to elicit effective immune stimulation, yet no nucleic acid vaccine has been FDA‐approved for human use. Nanoparticles (NPs) are one of the top candidates to mediate successful DNA/mRNA vaccine delivery due to their unique properties, including unlimited possibilities for formulations, protective capacity, simultaneous loading, and delivery potential of multiple DNA/mRNA vaccines. This review will summarize the many varieties of novel NP formulations for DNA and mRNA vaccine delivery as well as give the reader a brief synopsis of NP vaccine clinical trials. Finally, the future perspectives and challenges for NP‐mediated nucleic acid vaccines will be explored.","Ho, William; Gao, Mingzhu; Li, Fengqiao; Li, Zhongyu; Zhang, Xue‐Qing; Xu, Xiaoyang",Adv Healthc Mater,https://doi.org/10.1002/adhm.202001812; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33458958/,159

After exposure of bacteriophage T2 to a commercially available cranberry (Vaccinium macrocarpon) juice cocktail (CJ), virus infectivity titer was no longer detectible. After a 60-min exposure to orange (OJ) and grapefruit juices (GJ), phage infectivity was reduced to 25–35% of control, respectively. Similar data were observed for the bacteriophage T4. CJ inactivation of phage T4 was rapid, dose-dependent, and occurred at either 4 or 23 °C. Neither pH nor differences in sugar/carbohydrate levels among the juices may be ascribed to the recognized antiviral effects. Further studies were performed to identify the occurrence of antiviral activity by CJ to a mammalian enteric virus. The treatment of the simian rotavirus SA-11 with a 20% CJ suspension was sufficient to inhibit hemagglutination. Under scanning and transmission electron microscopy, CJ was observed to inhibit the adsorption of phage T4 to its bacterial host cells and prevented the replication of rotavirus in its monkey kidney (MA-104) host cells, respectively. The data suggest, for the first time, a non-specific antiviral effect towards unrelated viral species (viz., bacteriophages T2 and T4 and the simian rotavirus SA-11) by a commercially available cranberry fruit juice drink.","Lipson, S.M.; Sethi, L.; Cohen, P.; Gordon, R.E.; Tan, I.P.; Burdowski, A.; Stotzky, G.",Phytomedicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17140784/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0944711306001863; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0944711306001863,159

Objective: to investigate the prognostic factors of early chest CT findings in COVID-19 patients. Materials and Methods: This retrospective study included 91 patients (34 women, and 57 men) of RT-PCR positive COVID-19 from 3 hospitals in Iran between February 25, 2020, to march 15, 2020. Patients were divided into two groups as good prognosis, discharged from the hospital and alive without symptoms (48 patients), and poor prognosis, died or needed ICU care (43 patients). The first CT images of both groups that were obtained during the first 8 days of the disease presentation were evaluated considering the pattern, distribution, and underlying disease. The total CT-score was calculated for each patient. Univariate and multivariate analysis with IBM SPSS Statistics v.26 was used to find the prognostic factors. Results: There was a significant correlation between poor prognosis and older ages, dyspnea, presence of comorbidities, especially cardiovascular and pulmonary. Considering CT features, peripheral and diffuse distribution, anterior and paracardiac involvement, crazy paving pattern, and pleural effusion were correlated with poor prognosis. There was a correlation between total CT-score and prognosis and an 11.5 score was suggested as a cut-off with 67.4% sensitivity and 68.7% specificity in differentiation of poor prognosis patients (patients who needed ICU admission or died. Multivariate analysis revealed that a model consisting of age, male gender, underlying comorbidity, diffused lesions, total CT-score, and dyspnea would predict the prognosis better. Conclusion: Total chest CT-score and chest CT features can be used as prognostic factors in COVID-19 patients.

The active form, baloxavir acid (BXA), targets the cap-snatching endonuclease (PA) of the influenza virus polymerase complex. The nuclease activity delivers the primer for transcription, and previous reports have shown that BXA blocks the nuclease activity with high potency. However, biochemical studies on the mechanism of action are lacking. Structural data have shown that BXA chelates the two divalent metal ions at the active site, like inhibitors of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) integrase or ribonuclease (RNase) H. Here we studied the mechanisms underlying the high potency of BXA and how the I38T mutation confers resistance to the drug. Enzyme kinetics with the recombinant heterotrimeric enzyme (FluB-ht) revealed characteristics of a tight binding inhibitor. The apparent inhibitor constant (K(i)(app)) is 12 nM, while the I38T mutation increased K(i)(app) by ∼18-fold. Order-of-addition experiments show that a preformed complex of FluB-ht, Mg(2+) ions and BXA is required to observe inhibition, which is consistent with active site binding. Conversely, a preformed complex of FluB-ht and RNA substrate prevents BXA from accessing the active site. Unlike integrase inhibitors that interact with the DNA substrate, BXA behaves like RNase H inhibitors that compete with the nucleic acid at the active site. The collective data support the conclusion that BXA is a tight binding inhibitor and the I38T mutation diminishes these properties.","Todd, Brendan; Tchesnokov, Egor P.; Götte, Matthias",J Biol Chem,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbc.2021.100486; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33647314/,159
632978,The Impact of SARS-CoV-2 on Inflammatory Bowel Disease,2020-05-05,"BACKGROUND: There have been insufficient data for African patients with COVID-19 who are critically ill. The African COVID-19 Critical Care Outcomes Study (ACCCOS) aimed to determine which resources, comorbidities, and critical care interventions are associated with mortality in this patient population. METHODS: The ACCCOS study was a multicentre, prospective, observational cohort study in adults (aged 18 years or older) with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection who were referred to intensive care or high-care units in 64 hospitals in ten African countries (ie, Egypt, Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Libya, Malawi, Mozambique, Niger, Nigeria, and South Africa). The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality censored at 30 days. We studied the factors (ie, human and facility resources, patient comorbidities, and critical care interventions) that were associated with mortality in these adult patients. This study is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04367207. FINDINGS: From May to December, 2020, 6779 patients were referred to critical care. Of these, 3752 (55·3%) patients were admitted and 3140 (83·7%) patients from 64 hospitals in ten countries participated (mean age 55·6 years; 1890 [60·6%] of 3118 participants were male). The hospitals had a median of two intensivists (IQR 1–4) and pulse oximetry was available to all patients in 49 (86%) of 57 sites. In-hospital mortality within 30 days of admission was 48·2% (95% CI 46·4–50·0; 1483 of 3077 patients). Factors that were independently associated with mortality were increasing age per year (odds ratio 1·03; 1·02–1·04); HIV/AIDS (1·91; 1·31–2·79); diabetes (1·25; 1·01–1·56); chronic liver disease (3·48; 1·48–8·18); chronic kidney disease (1·89; 1·28–2·78); delay in admission due to a shortage of resources (2·14; 1·42–3·22); quick sequential organ failure assessment score at admission (for one factor [1·44; 1·01–2·04], for two factors [2·0; 1·33–2·99], and for three factors [3·66, 2·12–6·33]); respiratory support (high flow oxygenation [2·72; 1·46–5·08]; continuous positive airway pressure [3·93; 2·13–7·26]; invasive mechanical ventilation [15·27; 8·51–27·37]); cardiorespiratory arrest within 24 h of admission (4·43; 2·25–8·73); and vasopressor requirements (3·67; 2·77–4·86). Steroid therapy was associated with survival (0·55; 0·37–0·81). There was no difference in outcome associated with female sex (0·86; 0·69–1·06). INTERPRETATION: Mortality in critically ill patients with COVID-19 is higher in African countries than reported from studies done in Asia, Europe, North America, and South America.

Here, we estimate the performances of homemade droplet digital PCR (ddPCR)-based assays against culture in 89 biopsies, for those fresh and formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) subsamples were available. Methods: MTB diagnosis in fresh subsamples was performed by culture. Fresh subsamples were also analyzed for acid-fast bacilli smear-microscopy (AFB) and Xpert(®) MTB/RIF (Xpert). MTB examination was repeated in blind in the 89 FFPE subsamples by in-house ddPCR assays targeting the IS6110 and rpoB. Analytical sensitivity of ddPCR assays was evaluated using serial dilution of H37Rv strain. Limit of detection (LOD) was calculated by probit analysis. Results were expressed in copies/10(6) cells. Results: IS6110 and rpoB ddPCR assays showed a good linear correlation between expected and observed values (R(2): 0.9907 and 0.9743, respectively). Probit analyses predicted a LOD of 17 and 40 copies/10(6) cells of MTB DNA for IS6110 and rpoB, respectively. Of the 89 biopsies, 68 were culture positive and 21 were culture negative. Considering mycobacterial culture as reference method, IS6110 assay yielded positive results in 67/68 culture-positive samples with a median interquartile range (IQR) of 1,680 (550–8,444) copies/10(6) cells (sensitivity: 98.5%; accuracy: 98.9). These performances were superior to those reported by the rpoB assay in FFPE subsamples (sensitivity: 66.20%; accuracy: 74.1) and even superior to those reported by Xpert and AFB in fresh subsamples (sensitivity: 79.4 and 33.8%, respectively; accuracy: 84.3 and 49.4, respectively). When Xpert and AFB results were stratified according to mycobacterial load detected by rpoB and IS6110 ddPCR, bacterial load was lower in Xpert and AFB negative with respect to Xpert and AFB-positive samples (p = 0.003 and 0.01 for rpoB and p = 0.01 and 0.11 for IS6110), confirming the poor sensitivity of these methods in paucibacillary disease. Conclusion: ddPCR provides highly sensitive, accurate, and rapid MTB diagnosis in FFPE samples, as defined by the high concordance between IS6110 assay and culture results. This approach can be safely introduced in clinical routine to accelerate MTB diagnosis mainly when culture results remain unavailable.","Antonello, Maria; Scutari, Rossana; Lauricella, Calogero; Renica, Silvia; Motta, Valentina; Torri, Stefania; Russo, Cristina; Gentile, Leonarda; Cento, Valeria; Colagrossi, Luna; Mattana, Giordana; Codecasa, Luigi Ruffo; Vismara, Chiara; Scaglione, Francesco; Veronese, Silvio Marco; Bonoldi, Emanuela; Bandera, Alessandra; Gori, Andrea; Mazzola, Ester; Perno, Carlo Federico; Alteri, Claudia",Front Microbiol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2021.727774; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34589075/,159

It is unknown which patients could require higher doses of tocilizumab to get out of the cytokine storm. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty‐four patients affected by COVID‐19 pneumonia were included. All the patients underwent tocilizumab 8 mg/kg intravenously and were tested for serum IL‐6 24‐48 hours before and 12‐48 hours after tocilizumab infusion. Comparisons between survivors and non‐survivors were performed. RESULTS: Eighteen patients were discharged, while six patients died, with no clinical or laboratory differences between the two groups at baseline. IL‐6 was not different at baseline (p=0.41), while 24‐48h post‐tocilizumab IL‐6 serum levels were significantly higher in non‐survivors than in survivors [2398.5 (430.5‐9372) pg/mL vs 290.5 (58.5‐1305.5) pg/mL, p=0.022)]. Serum IL‐6 post‐tocilizumab showed a good predictive ability to discriminate survivors from non‐survivors (AUC 0.815 95%CI 0.63‐0.99, p=0.02). CONCLUSION: Repeated measurement of serum level of IL‐6 early after tocilizumab may distinguish non‐survivors from survivors and support the choice of deeper targeting IL‐6 in COVID‐19 pneumonia.

We developed a protocol, C-I-TASSER, to integrate interresidue contact maps from deep neural-network learning with the cutting-edge I-TASSER fragment assembly simulations. Large-scale benchmark tests showed that C-I-TASSER can fold more than twice the number of non-homologous proteins than the I-TASSER, which does not use contacts. When applied to a folding experiment on 8,266 unsolved Pfam families, C-I-TASSER successfully folded 4,162 domain families, including 504 folds that are not found in the PDB. Furthermore, it created correct folds for 85% of proteins in the SARS-CoV-2 genome, despite the quick mutation rate of the virus and sparse sequence profiles. The results demonstrated the critical importance of coupling whole-genome and metagenome-based evolutionary information with optimal structure assembly simulations for solving the problem of non-homologous protein structure prediction.","Zheng, Wei; Zhang, Chengxin; Li, Yang; Pearce, Robin; Bell, Eric W.; Zhang, Yang",Cell Rep Methods,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34355210/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.crmeth.2021.100014,159
635259,The Value That Infectious Diseases Physicians Bring to the Healthcare System,2017-09-15,"INTRODUCTION: Staff-to-staff transmission of SARS-CoV-2 poses a significant risk to the Emergency Department (ED) workforce. We measured close (<6 ft), prolonged (>10 min) staff interactions in a busy pediatric Emergency Department in common work areas over time as the pandemic unfolded, measuring the effectiveness of interventions meant to discourage such close contact. METHODS: We used a Real-Time Locating System to measure staff groupings in crowded common work areas lasting ten or more minutes. We compared the number of these interactions pre-pandemic with those occurring early and then later in the pandemic, as distancing interventions were suggested and then formalized. Nearly all healthcare workers in the ED were included, and the duration of interactions over time were evaluated as well. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: This study included a total of 12,386 pairs of staff-to-staff encounters over three time periods including just prior to the pandemic, early in the pandemic response, and later in the steady-state pandemic response. Pairs of staff averaged 0.89 high-risk interactions hourly prior to the pandemic, and this continued early in the pandemic with informal recommendations (0.80 high-risk pairs hourly). High-risk staff encounters fell significantly to 0.47 interactions per hour in the steady-state pandemic with formal distancing guidelines in place and decreased patient and staffing volumes. The duration of these encounters remained stable, near 16 min. Close contact between healthcare staff workers did significantly decrease with formal distancing guidelines, though some high-risk interactions remained, warranting additive protective measures such as universal masking.","Barrick, Lindsey; Overmann, Kevin M.; LaBare, Jonathan; Wu, Danny T.Y.",Am J Emerg Med,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0735675721004502?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34098329/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajem.2021.05.066; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0735675721004502,159

People's hard-earned money, their personal information, identity, and health are at a higher risk than ever due to the misuse of technology in doing forgery. However, the technology can also be used as an answer to counteracting against fraudulence prevalent in affairs from every walk of life. This short paper attempts to present the blockchain technology as a solution to overcome the menace of forgery by promoting trustless computing in business transactions. The paper explains the blockchain technology and a variety of its implementation through five different use cases in the field of drug supply chain, health insurance, land record management, courier services, and immigration records. The immigration blockchain is also proposed as a solution to check pandemic like the coronavirus (COVID-19) effectively. The implementation of the Blockchain is performed using a locally built IBM’s hyper-ledger fabric-based platform, and Ethereum public platform.

SARS-CoV-2 relies on the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor for cellular entry and the abundance of this receptor in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract may help explain the GI manifestations, including dysgeusia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain, present in over 40% of infected patients. GI tract involvement also raises the concern for oral-fecal transmission which is poorly understood. Outcome studies in COVID-19 patients with preexisting liver disease and inflammatory bowel disease show predominantly mild transaminase elevations and no increased risk from the use of biological agents in inflammatory bowel disease patients. High-dose corticosteroids, however, should be avoided. As endoscopic procedures are aerosol-generating, modifications to clinical practice is necessary to minimize the spread of COVID-19.

Antimicrobial host defense peptides have been investigated for their potential as a new class of antimicrobial drugs. Recently their immunomodulatory activities have begun to be appreciated. Modulation of innate immunity by synthetic variants of host defense peptides, called innate defense regulators (IDRs), is protective without direct antimicrobial action. We discuss the potential and current limitations in exploiting the immunomodulatory activity of IDRs as a novel anti-infective pathway.

METHODS: Analysis of individual-level web browsing data linked with survey responses from representative samples of Americans collected between October 2016 and February 2019. RESULTS: We estimate that approximately 84% of Americans visit a vaccine-related webpage each year. Encounters with vaccine-skeptical content are less frequent; they make up only 7.5% of vaccine-related pageviews and are encountered by only 18.5% of people annually. However, these pages are more likely to be published by untrustworthy sources. Moreover, skeptical content exposure is more common among people with less favorable vaccine attitudes. Finally, usage of online intermediaries is frequently linked to vaccine-related information exposure. Google use is differentially associated with subsequent exposure to non-skeptical content, whereas exposure to vaccine-skeptical webpages is associated with usage of webmail and, to a lesser extent, Facebook. CONCLUSIONS: Online exposure to vaccine-skeptical content is relatively rare, but vigilance is required given the potential for exposure among vulnerable audiences.","Guess, Andrew M.; Nyhan, Brendan; O’Keeffe, Zachary; Reifler, Jason",Vaccine,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X20313116; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33164802/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X20313116; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2020.10.018,159

Communicating with patients or their families during such dire times is very important especially when the patient or family members have unrealistic expectations. Herein, we have highlighted practical suggestions which if applied can prevent unnecessary draining encounters with patients and families; for example, incorporating ancillary staff such as palliative and pastoral care into the care team. We have also proposed a new concept of ‘physician optimism’. Based on this concept, the physician can be classified as a pessimist or an optimist with realistic or unrealistic expectations and communicate to patients with or without requisite empathy. To ensure the best outcomes, we conclude that physicians must be realistic optimists who always communicate with empathy. Unrealistic optimism, no matter how well-intentioned, is deceiving to patients and their families will never allow a culture of trust.","Salabei, Joshua K.; Fishman, Troy J.; Schwartz, Steven J; Okonoboh, Peters; Iyer, Uma G.",Journal of community hospital internal medicine perspectives,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34234895/; https://doi.org/10.1080/20009666.2021.1890340,159
641207,Immune response to SARS-CoV-2 in health care workers following a COVID-19 outbreak: a prospective longitudinal study,2020-08-06,"BACKGROUND: The new SARS-CoV-2 variant VOC (202012/01), identified recently in the United Kingdom (UK), exhibits a higher transmissibility rate compared to other variants, and a reproductive number 0.4 higher. In the UK, scientists were able to identify the increase of this new variant through the rise of false negative results for the spike (S) target using a three-target RT-PCR assay (TaqPath kit). METHODS: To control and study the current coronavirus pandemic, it is important to develop a rapid and low-cost molecular test to identify the aforementioned variant. In this work, we designed primer sets specific to the VOC (202012/01) to be used by SYBR Green-based RT-PCR. These primers were specifically designed to confirm the deletion mutations Δ69/Δ70 in the spike and the Δ106/Δ107/Δ108 in the NSP6 gene. We studied 20 samples from positive patients, detected by using the Applied Biosystems TaqPath RT-PCR COVID-19 kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, USA) that included the ORF1ab, S, and N gene targets. 16 samples displayed an S-negative profile (negative for S target and positive for N and ORF1ab targets) and four samples with S, N and ORF1ab positive profile. RESULTS: Our results emphasized that all S-negative samples harbored the mutations Δ69/Δ70 and Δ106/Δ107/Δ108. This protocol could be used as a second test to confirm the diagnosis in patients who were already positive to COVID-19 but showed false negative results for S-gene. CONCLUSIONS: This technique may allow to identify patients carrying the VOC (202012/01) or a closely related variant, in case of shortage in sequencing.","Abdel Sater, Fadil; Younes, Mahmoud; Nassar, Hassan; Nguewa, Paul; Hamze, Kassem",Mol Biol Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34613565/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11033-021-06717-y,159

Some argue that these result from a hypersensitivity reaction, although evidence to support this is very scarce. Most reports on such reactions are not substantiated by positive skin tests. The purpose of our study was to determine whether immediate or delayed type hypersensitivity reaction follows hyaluronic acid (HA) filler injections. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twelve patients were referred for general allergic screening (patch tests), as well as specific intradermal testing (injection of 0.1cc boluses) on the medial upper arm with a selection of several currently available hyaluronic acid (HA) fillers on the market. A positive allergic reaction was defined as erythema, firmness or swelling. RESULTS: During the 4 month follow-up, no reactions to any of the tested HA fillers were reported. No correlation was found between results from the general allergic screening and a history with LIRs to HA fillers.

Since March 2020, country programmes have implemented a range of strategies to either continue vaccination services during COVID-19 measures like 'lockdown' and/or resume services when risks of SARS-CoV-2 transmission could be appropriately mitigated. Through the Exemplars in Global Health partnership in Liberia, Nepal, and Senegal, we conducted interviews with immunisation programme managers and ministry of health leadership to better understand how they have addressed the myriad vaccination challenges posed by the ongoing pandemic. From establishing alternative modes of service delivery to combatting vaccine distrust and rumours via risk communication campaigns, many routine immunisation programmes have demonstrated how to adapt, resume, and/or maintain vital vaccination efforts during the COVID-19 crisis. Yet millions of children remain un- or under-vaccinated worldwide, and the same programmes striving to implement catch-up services for missed doses and postponed mass campaigns will also soon be tasked with COVID-19 vaccine deployment. As laid bare by the current pandemic, the world's gains against vaccine-preventable diseases are fragile: enshrined by a delicate global ecosystem of logistics, supply, and procurement, the success of routine immunisation ultimately rests upon dedicated programme staff, the resources and support available to them, and then the trust in and demand for vaccines by their recipients.

METHODS: A cross-sectional online survey was distributed to all consultant glaucoma specialists who are on the UK and Eire Glaucoma Society contact list. Participants were asked specific questions regarding preferences in glaucoma surgical practices and whether these had changed subsequent to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Trabeculectomy was the procedure of choice for 61 (87%) glaucoma specialists. A total of 51 (73%) respondents reported performing minimally invasive glaucoma surgery (MIGS) procedures before the COVID-19 pandemic. The most commonly performed MIGS procedure was the iStent inject (51%), followed by XEN 45 (36%) and Preserflo (17%). Forty-three (61%) respondents reported modifying their glaucoma surgery practice subsequent to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Of the glaucoma specialists who modified their surgical practices, 21 (43%) specifically reduced the number of trabeculectomies performed. In combination, diode laser (both micropulse and conventional trans-scleral cyclodiode) was the most common alternative procedure. Glaucoma drainage devices, deep sclerectomy and Preserflo were also commonly chosen alternatives. CONCLUSION: Although trabeculectomy remains the most commonly performed established glaucoma surgery, it is being performed with reduced frequency during the COVID-19 pandemic due to the number of postoperative visits and procedures required. Alternatives such as conventional and micropulse diode laser, glaucoma drainage devices, deep sclerectomy and Preserflo appear to be the favoured alternative procedures.","Holland, Lee Joseph; Mercieca, Karl J; Kirwan, James F",Br J Ophthalmol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33931388/; https://doi.org/10.1136/bjophthalmol-2021-319062,159

These patients were much older (median age = 69 years) than the average age of our sample and had systemic comorbidities (diabetes mellitus, hypertension, etc.). We propose the term “COVID-19 retinopathy” to denote the presence of CWSs at the posterior pole, occasionally associated with intraretinal hemorrhages, in the absence of ocular inflammation in patients with a history of COVID-19 disease.","Bansal, Reema; Markan, Ashish; Gautam, Nitin; Guru, Rashmi Ranjan; Lakshmi, P.

649890,"Clinical course and outcome of 107 patients infected with the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, discharged from two hospitals in Wuhan, China",2020-04-30,The COVID-19 disease is caused by a positive stranded RNA virus called SARS-CoV-2. The virus mainly targets the pulmonary epithelial cells as it’s initial site of infection by letting its surface spike protein interact and bind to the host ACE2 receptor. The internalization and gradual replication of the virus results in an exaggerated immune response triggering release of many pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. This immune storm is responsible for multiple health hazards in the host ultimately leading to multiple organ failure. Mesenchymal stem cell therapy offers a promising approach towards mitigating the delirious effects of the infection in the COVID-19 patients. This therapy has shown to reduce the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines as well as repair of damaged tissues in COVID-19 patients.

649971,Prevention of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) transmission in residential aged care using ultraviolet light (PETRA): a two-arm crossover randomised controlled trial protocol,2021-09-17,"BACKGROUND: Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) is the causal agent of postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS), which has severely impacted the swine industry worldwide. PCV2 triggers a weak and atypical innate immune response, but the key genes and mechanisms by which the virus interferes with host innate immunity have not yet been elucidated. In this study, genes that control the response of primary porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs), the main target of PCV2, were profiled in vitro. RESULTS: PAMs were successfully infected by PCV2-WH strain, as evidenced quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and immunofluorescence assay (IFA) results. Infection-related differential gene expression was investigated using pig microarrays from the US Pig Genome Coordination Program and validated by real-time PCR and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Microarray analysis at 24 and 48 hours post-infection (HPI) revealed 266 and 175 unique genes, respectively, that were differentially expressed (false discovery rate <0.05; fold-change >2). Only six genes were differentially expressed between 24 and 48 HPI. The up-regulated genes were principally related to immune response, cytokine activity, locomotion, regulation of cell proliferation, apoptosis, cell growth arrest, and antigen procession and presentation. The down-regulated genes were mainly involved in terpenoid biosynthesis, carbohydrate metabolism, translation, proteasome degradation, signal transducer activity, and ribosomal proteins, which were representative of the reduced vital activity of PCV2-infected cells. CONCLUSIONS: PCV2 infection of PAMs causes up-regulation of genes related to inflammation, indicating that PCV2 may induce systematic inflammation. PCV2 persistently induced cytokines, mainly through the Toll-like receptor (TLR) 1 and TLR9 pathways, which may promote high levels of cytokine secretion. PCV2 may prevent apoptosis in PAMs by up-regulating SERPINB9 expression, possibly to lengthen the duration of PCV2 replication-permissive conditions. The observed gene expression profile may provide insights into the underlying immunological response and pathological changes that occur in pigs following PCV2 infection.","Li, Wentao; Liu, Shuqing; Wang, Yang; Deng, Feng; Yan, Weidong; Yang, Kun; Chen, Huanchun; He, Qigai; Charreyre, Catherine; Audoneet, Jean-Christophe",BMC Genomics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23711280/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2164-14-353,159

Although many countries have actively implemented vaccination strategies to curb the epidemic, there is no specific efficient therapeutic drug for this virus to effectively reduce deaths. Therefore, the underappreciated macromolecular compounds have become the spotlight of research. Furthermore, the medicinal compounds in plants that provide myriad possibilities to treat human diseases have become of utmost importance. Experience indicates that Traditional Chinese medicine effectively treats SARS and has been used for treating patients with COVID-19 in China. As one of the world’s oldest herbal remedies, licorice is used for treating patients with all stages of COVID-19. Glycyrrhizic acid (GA), the main active compound in licorice, has been proven effective in killing the SARS virus. Meanwhile, as a natural plant molecule, GA can also directly target important protein structures of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and inhibit the replication of SARS-CoV-2. In this review, we summarized the immune synergy of GA and its potential role in treating COVID-19 complications. Besides, we reviewed its anti-inflammatory effects on the immune system and its positive effects in cooperation with various drugs to fight against COVID-19 and its comorbidities. The purpose of this review is to elucidate and suggest that GA can be used as a potential drug during COVID-19 treatment.","Sun, Zhong; He, Guozhong; Huang, Ninghao; Thilakavathy, Karuppiah; Lim, Jonathan Chee Woei; Kumar, S.

Field-effect transistors based on semiconducting two-dimensional (2D) materials (2D-FETs) have been identified as potential candidates for rapid and label-free sensing applications. This is because any perturbation of such atomically thin 2D channels can significantly impact their electronic transport properties. Here, we report the use of FET based on semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) WSe(2) as a promising biosensor for the rapid and sensitive detection of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. The sensor is created by functionalizing the WSe(2) monolayers with a monoclonal antibody against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and exhibits a detection limit of down to 25 fg/μL in 0.01X phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Comprehensive theoretical and experimental studies, including density functional theory, atomic force microscopy, Raman and photoluminescence spectroscopies, and electronic transport properties, were performed to characterize and explain the device performance. The results demonstrate that TMDC-based 2D-FETs can potentially serve as sensitive and selective biosensors for the rapid detection of infectious diseases.","Fathi-Hafshejani, Parvin; Azam, Nurul; Wang, Lu; Kuroda, Marcelo A.; Hamilton, Michael C.; Hasim, Sahar; Mahjouri-Samani, Masoud",ACS Nano,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34181385/; https://doi.org/10.1021/acsnano.1c01188,159

However, reports on the risk factors for cardiac injury and their prognostic value are limited. Results: In total, 15.9% of all cases were defined as cardiac injury in our study. Patients with severe COVID-19 were significantly associated with older age and higher respiratory rates, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores, cardiac injury biomarkers and PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratios. Male patients with chest distress and dyspnea were more likely to have severe disease. Patients with cardiac injury were significantly more likely to have a severe condition and have an outcome of death. However, no significant difference was found in respiratory rates, dyspnea or PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio between patients with or without cardiac injury. In the logistic regression model, pre-existing hypertension and higher SOFA score were independent risk factors for patients with COVID-19 developing cardiac injury. Conclusions: Our study revealed that cardiac injury was an important predictor for patients having a severe or fatal outcome. Patients with pre-existing hypertension and higher SOFA scores upon admission were more likely to develop cardiac injury. Nevertheless, pulmonary ventilation dysfunction and oxygen inhalation insufficiency were not the main causes of cardiac injury in patients with COVID-19. Methods: A total of 113 confirmed cases were included in our study. Severe patients were defined according to American Thoracic Society guidelines for community-acquired pneumonia. Cardiac injury was defined as a serum cTnI above the 99(th)-percentile of the upper reference limit. Patient characteristics, clinical laboratory data and treatment details were collected and analyzed.

Methodology This was an observational study conducted in the Department of Microbiology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Gorakhpur. Results In total, 2,168 patients were tested. The percentage positivity rate of the RT-PCR tests among the antigen-negative samples was 4.34% in the first wave of the pandemic whereas it was 8.08% in the second wave.

In both entities patients with events and with severe structural damage displayed higher neutrophil and lower lymphocyte counts. In both scenarios, higher maximum neutrophil and lower minimum lymphocyte counts were associated with more events and more severe organ damage. NLR was higher in STEMI and COVID-19 patients with the worst clinical and structural outcomes. A canonical deregulation of the immune response occurs in STEMI and COVID-19 patients.

The objectives of the study were to determine optimum handling conditions of the oral fluid before RNA extraction and to compare the performance of the RNeasy Protect Saliva Mini kit, which contains a stabilizing agent, with that of the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini kit, which does not contain a stabilizing agent. Preliminary studies with oral fluid inoculated with HEV indicated that a heat treatment of 60 °C for 15 min was detrimental to HEV RNA. HEV was recovered from 25/25 and 24/25 samples of oral fluid when samples were incubated for ≤24 h at 4 °C and 30 days at −20 °C, respectively, without a stabilizing agent and extracted with the QiaAMP kit. In contrast, HEV RNA was detected in 16/25 and 11/25 samples when samples were incubated with a stabilizing agent for 24 h at 37 °C and 30 days at −20 °C, respectively, and extracted with the RNeasy Protect Saliva kit. Moreover, the mean number of genome copies/ml of HEV recovered from oral fluid stored at −20 °C without the stabilizing agent was 2.9 log units higher than oral fluid stored at −20 °C in the presence of the stabilizing agent. The recovery of RNA from HEV, F-RNA coliphage MS2 and murine norovirus (MNV), which are surrogates for norovirus, was significantly greater when oral fluid was incubated for 24 h at 4 °C than when oral fluid was stabilized with RNAprotect Saliva Reagent for 24 h at 37 °C, where the relative differences between the two processes were 1.4, 1.8, and 2.7 log genome copies/ml for MS2, MNV, and HEV, respectively. The findings suggest that it is unnecessary to stabilize oral fluid from swine for the detection of viral RNA, provided the samples are stored at 4 °C or frozen at −20 °C, and that the RNeasy Protect Saliva Mini kit did not perform well for the detection of viral RNA.","Jones, T.H.; Muehlhauser, V.",J Virol Methods,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2013.12.011; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24384096/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093413005132; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166093413005132,159

Methods The data of all probable SARS cases were derived from the Infectious Disease Reporting System of the Center of Diseases Control and Hospital Information Systems, during the 2003 epidemic in mainland China. The definition of probable SARS case was consistent with the definition for clinically confirmed SARS issued by the Ministry of Health of the People’s Republic of China. We performed univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis to determine the association of CFR with age, sex, residence location, occupation, the period of the epidemic and the duration from symptom onset to admission into hospital. Results The overall CFR was 6.4% among 5327 probable SARS cases in mainland China. Old age, being a patient during the early period of a local outbreak, and being from Tianjin led to a relatively higher CFR than young age, late stage of a local outbreak and cases from Beijing. Guangdong Province resulted in an even lower CFR compared with Beijing. Conclusions Because of their deteriorated health status and apparent complications, SARS patients aged >60 years had a much higher risk of dying than younger patients. At the early stage of local outbreaks, lack of experience in patient care and perhaps treatment also led to a relatively higher CFR. The Tianjin SARS outbreak happened mainly within a hospital, leading to a high impact of co‐morbidity. The relatively young age of the cases partly explains the low CFR in mainland China compared with other countries and areas affected by SARS.","Jia, Na; Feng, Dan; Fang, Li‐Qun; Richardus, Jan Hendrik; Han, Xiao‐Na; Cao, Wu‐Chun; De Vlas, Sake J.",Trop Med Int Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19508439/; https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3156.2008.02147.x,159
657156,Using a novel rapid viral test to improve triage of emergency department patients with acute respiratory illness during flu season,2018-09-15,"Potential for SARS‐CoV‐2 viral inactivation by solar UV radiation in outdoor spaces in the UK has been assessed. Average erythema effective and UV‐A daily radiant exposures per month were higher (statistically significant, P < 0.05) in spring 2020 in comparison with spring 2015–2019 across most of the UK, while irradiance generally appeared to be in the normal expected range of 2015–2019. It was found that these higher radiant exposures may have increased the potential for SARS‐CoV‐2 viral inactivation outdoors in April and May 2020. Assessment of the 6‐year period 2015–2020 in the UK found that for 50–60% of the year, that is most of October to March, solar UV is unlikely to have a significant (at least 90% inactivation) impact on viral inactivation outdoors. Minimum times to reach 90% and 99% inactivation in the UK are of the order of tens of minutes and of the order of hours, respectively. However, these times are best case scenarios and should be treated with caution.","Rendell, Rebecca; Khazova, Marina; Higlett, Michael; O’Hagan, John",Photochem Photobiol,https://doi.org/10.1111/php.13401; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33590505/,159

The need for these analyses was motivated by research of surgical work-flow disruptions in operating room settings. Specifically, for the analysis of the causes and characteristics of periods of high disruption-rates, which are associated with adverse surgical outcomes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: read-tv is a graphical application, and the main component of a package of the same name. read-tv generates and evaluates code to filter and visualize data. Users can view the visualization code from within the application, which facilitates reproducibility. The data input requirements are simple, a table with a time column with no missing values. The input can either be in the form of a file, or an in-memory dataframe– which is effective for rapid visualization during curation. RESULTS: We used read-tv to automatically detect surgical disruption cascades. We found that the most common disruption type during a cascade was training, followed by equipment. DISCUSSION: read-tv fills a need for visualization software of surgical disruptions and other longitudinal data. Every visualization is reproducible, the exact source code that read-tv executes to create a visualization is available from within the application. read-tv is generalizable, it can plot any tabular dataset given the simple requirements that there is a numeric, datetime, or datetime string column with no missing values. Finally, the tab-based architecture of read-tv is easily extensible, it is relatively simple to add new functionality by implementing a tab in the source code. CONCLUSION: read-tv enables quick identification of patterns through customizable longitudinal plots; faceting; CPA; and user-specified filters. The package is available on GitHub under an MIT license.","Del Gaizo, John; Catchpole, Ken R; Alekseyenko, Alexander V",JAMIA Open,https://doi.org/10.1093/jamiaopen/ooab007; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33709063/,159

Still, the human response to restrain the virus is also creating massive ripples through different systems, such as health, economy, education, and tourism. This paper focuses on research and applying Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms to predict COVID-19 propagation using the available time-series data and study the effect of the quality of life, the number of tests performed, and the awareness of citizens on the virus in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries at the Gulf area. So we focused on cases in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), United Arab of Emirates (UAE), Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman, and Qatar. For this aim, we accessed the time-series real-datasets collected from Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CSSE). The timeline of our data is from January 22, 2020 to January 25, 2021. We have implemented the proposed model based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) with ten hidden units (neurons) to predict COVID-19 confirmed and death cases. From the experimental results, we confirmed that KSA and Qatar would take the most extended period to recover from the COVID-19 virus, and the situation will be controllable in the second half of March 2021 in UAE, Kuwait, Oman, and Bahrain. Also, we calculated the root mean square error (RMSE) between the actual and predicted values of each country for confirmed and death cases, and we found that the best values for both confirmed and death cases are 320.79 and 1.84, respectively, and both are related to Bahrain. While the worst values are 1768.35 and 21.78, respectively, and both are related to KSA. On the other hand, we also calculated the mean absolute relative errors (MARE) between the actual and predicted values of each country for confirmed and death cases, and we found that the best values for both confirmed and deaths cases are 37.76 and 0.30, and these are related to Kuwait and Qatar respectively.

There are, however, few training options that explicitly utilise real-time simulated stochastic outbreaks where the participants themselves comprise the dataset they subsequently analyse. In this paper, we present a teaching exercise in which an infectious disease outbreak is simulated over a five-day period and subsequently analysed. We iteratively developed the teaching exercise to offer additional insight into analysing an outbreak. An R package for visualisation, analysis and simulation of the outbreak data was developed to accompany the practical to reinforce learning outcomes. Computer simulations of the outbreak revealed deviations from observed dynamics, highlighting how simplifying assumptions conventionally made in mathematical models often differ from reality.

It draws on a published compilation of 202 Emerging Infectious Zoonotic Disease (EIZD) events for the period 1940–2004. Of the 202 zoonotic EID events in the dataset, 74 (36.6%) were associated with animals kept for food production, which acted as reservoir for the zoonotic pathogen in 64 events and as intermediate / amplifying host in 8 events. Significant differences exist both in the characteristics of the causal agents and the drivers of emergence of zoonotic diseases from food animals and non-food animals. However, the prevailing policy debate on prevention, detection and control of EIZDs largely focuses on diseases of non-food animal origin (wildlife), neglecting the role of food animals. Policies and investments that ensure appropriate veterinary public health measures along and within food animal value chains are essential to mitigate the global risk of EIZDs, particularly in developing regions where the livestock sector is experiencing rapid growth and structural transformation.","Otte, Joachim; Pica-Ciamarra, Ugo",One Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34522761/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.onehlt.2021.100323,159

DESIGN: Rapid systematic review. PARTICIPANTS: Humans with viral respiratory infections, exposed to systemic NSAIDs. PRIMARY OUTCOMES: Acute severe adverse outcomes, healthcare utilisation, quality of life and long-term survival. RESULTS: We screened 10 999 titles and abstracts and 738 full texts, including 87 studies. No studies addressed COVID-19, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome or Middle East Respiratory Syndrome; none examined inpatient healthcare utilisation, quality of life or long-term survival. Effects of NSAIDs on mortality and cardiovascular events in adults with viral respiratory infections are unclear (three observational studies; very low certainty). Children with empyema and gastrointestinal bleeding may be more likely to have taken NSAIDs than children without these conditions (two observational studies; very low certainty). In patients aged 3 years and older with acute respiratory infections, ibuprofen is associated with a higher rate of reconsultations with general practitioners than paracetamol (one randomised controlled trial (RCT); low certainty). The difference in death from all causes and hospitalisation for renal failure and anaphylaxis between children with fever receiving ibuprofen versus paracetamol is likely to be less than 1 per 10 000 (1 RCT; moderate/high certainty). Twenty-eight studies in adults and 42 studies in children report adverse event counts. Most report that no severe adverse events occurred. Due to methodological limitations of adverse event counts, this evidence should be interpreted with caution. CONCLUSIONS: It is unclear whether the use of NSAIDs increases the risk of severe adverse outcomes in patients with viral respiratory infections. This absence of evidence should not be interpreted as evidence for the absence of such risk. This is a rapid review with a number of limitations.

664533,An Assumed Vertical Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 During Pregnancy: A Case Report and Review of Literature,2020-09-26,"Polyvalent bacterial lysates have been in use for decades for prevention and treatment of respiratory infections with reported clinical benefits. However, besides claims of broad immune activation, the mode of action is still a matter of debate. The lysates, formulated with the main bacterial species involved in respiratory infections, are commonly prepared by chemical or mechanical disruption of bacterial cells, what is believed influences the biological activity of the product. Here, we prepared two polyvalent lysates with the same composition but different method of bacterial cell disruption and evaluated their biological activity in a comparative fashion. We found that both bacterial lysates induce NF-kB activation in a MyD88 dependent manner, suggesting they work as TLR agonists. Further, we found that a single intranasal dose of any of the two lysates, is sufficient to protect against pneumococcal pneumonia, suggesting that they exert similar biological activity. We have previously shown that protection against pneumococcal pneumonia can also be induced by prior S. pneumoniae sub lethal infection or therapeutic treatment with a TLR5 agonist. Protection in those cases depends on neutrophil recruitment to the lungs, and can be associated with increased local expression of IL-17A. Here, we show that bacterial lysates exert protection against pneumococcal pneumonia independently of neutrophils, IL-17A or Caspase-1/11 activation, suggesting the existence of redundant mechanisms of protection. Trypsin-treated lysates afford protection to the same extent, suggesting that just small peptides suffice to exert the protective effect or that the molecules responsible for the protective effect are not proteins. Understanding the mechanism of action of bacterial lysates and deciphering the active components shall allow redesigning them with more precisely defined formulations and expanding their range of action.","Ferrara, Florencia; Rial, Analía; Suárez, Norma; Chabalgoity, José Alejandro",Front Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33981296/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2021.562244,159

METHODS: Narrative analysis conducted by a team of medical professionals and anthropologists. We purposefully selected 10 PC physicians in community‐based hospitals and clinics and conducted a total of 17 individual and group interviews. The verbatim transcript data were analyzed using the conceptual framework of adaptive performance. RESULTS: We identified three “phases” of the time period (January–May 2020). In Phase 1, PC physicians initially perceived the disease as a problem unrelated to them. In Phase 2, the Diamond Princess outbreak triggered adaptive performance of the physicians, who began to deal with medical issues related to COVID‐19 by using social networking services and applying the collected information to their organization and/or communities. Following this, in Phase 3, the PC physicians’ adaptive performance in their own communities and institutions emerged in the face of the pandemic. Reflecting their sensitivity to local context, the PC physicians were seen to exhibit adaptive performance through dealing with context‐dependent problems and relationships. CONCLUSIONS: PC physicians exhibited adaptive performance in the course of coping with the realities of COVID‐19 in shifting phases and in differing localities in the early stages of the pandemic. The trajectories of adaptive performance in later stages of the pandemic remain to be seen.","Haruta, Junji; Horiguchi, Sachiko; Miyachi, Junichiro; Teruyama, Junko; Kimura, Shuhei; Iida, Junko; Ozone, Sachiko; Goto, Ryohei; Kaneko, Makoto; Hama, Yusuke",J Gen Fam Med,https://doi.org/10.1002/jgf2.452; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34226858/,159

The aim of this study was to clarify the association between CRRT and 28-day mortality in critically ill coronavirus disease 2019 (-COVID-19) patients receiving mechanical ventilation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 112 respiratory decompensated critically ill adult patients with COVID-19 admitted to a COVID-19-designated ICU were included in this retrospective cohort study. Data on demographic information, comorbidities, laboratory findings upon ICU admission, and clinical outcomes were collected. The Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazard model were applied to determine the potential risk factors associated with 28-day mortality. RESULTS: The median age was 65.7 years, 67.8% were males, and 58.9% patients had at least one comorbidity. The median scores of the Charlson Comorbidity Index and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) were 3 and 7, respectively. Acute kidney injury (AKI) occurred in 57 critically ill patients upon ICU admission; 43 patients were classified as stage 2 - 3 AKI, and 36 patients were treated with CRRT. Age > 65 years, high SOFA score, damaged cardiac function, poor nutrition, and severe infection were significantly associated with increased 28-day mortality.

A retrospective analysis was performed on 217 patients with COVID‐19 admitted to the First Hospital of Changsha in China, from January 17, 2020, to February 29, 2020. The active monitoring model in CHPS was used to detect ADR signals of the hospital information system. The risk factors for the ADRs were classified using the World Health Organization‐Uppsala Monitoring Centre (WHO‐UMC) system. Univariate and multivariate logistic regressions were carried out to analyze the risk factors of ADRs. Our results showed that the prevalence of ADRs was 37.8% in the patients, which was predominated by drug‐induced gastrointestinal disorders and liver system disorders (23.0% vs. 13.8%). The ADR could be explained by the use of lopinavir/ ritonavir and umifenovir by 63.8% and 18.1%, respectively. There were 96.8% of ADRs that occurred within 14 days of hospitalization. Multivariable analysis showed that length of stay (odds ratio (OR): 2.02; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.03–3.96; P = 0.04), number of drugs used in the hospital (OR: 3.17; 95% CI 1.60–6.27; P = 0.001) and underlying basic diseases (OR: 2.07; 95% CI 1.02–4.23; P = 0.04) were independent risk factor for ADRs in the patients. Together, the incidence of ADRs was significantly high during the treatment period.

This public awareness represents an enhanced opportunity for early and urgent goals-of-care discussions to reduce medically ineffective care. OBJECTIVE To assess the end-of-life experiences of hospitalized patients dying of COVID-19 with respect to identifying the clinical factors associated with utilization or non-utilization of the ICU. METHODS Retrospective cohort study of hospital outcomes using electronic medical records and individual chart review from March 15, 2020 to October 15, 2020 of every patient with a COVID-19 diagnosis who died or was admitted to hospice while hospitalized. Logistic regression multivariate analysis was used to identify the clinical and demographic factors associated with non-utilization of the ICU. RESULTS 133/749 (18%) of hospitalized COVID-19 patients died or were admitted to hospice as a result of COVID-19. Of the 133, 66 (49.6%) had no ICU utilization. In multivariate analysis, the significant patient factors associated with non-ICU utilization were increasing age, normal body mass index, and the presence of an advanced directive calling for limited life sustaining therapies.

666967,"From the Hajj: it's the flu, idiot",2014-12-13,"BACKGROUND: Cases of COVID-19 first emerged in December 2019. Since then, the virus has spread rapidly worldwide, with daily increases in the numbers of infections and deaths. COVID-19 spreads via airborne transmission, which renders dental treatment a potential source of virus transmission. Dental treatments require the use of handpieces, ultrasonic devices, or air–water syringes, which generate considerable amounts of aerosols. Jordan, being one of the affected countries, instituted preventive lockdown measures on March 17, 2020. Emergency dental treatments were only allowed in dental clinics of the Royal Medical Services of Jordan Armed Forces and Ministry of Health, and were prohibited in other sectors such as private clinics and universities. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to investigate the dental treatments performed in three military hospitals during the 44-day lockdown period in Jordan. The investigation explores the impact of COVID-19 on the number of patients and types of performed dental treatments. METHODS: Data such as number of patients, patients’ age and gender, and performed dental treatments were collected retrospectively from the hospital records and were analyzed. RESULTS: Our results showed a 90% (17,591 to 1689) decrease in patient visits during the lockdown period compared to regular days. The total number of treatments (n=1689) during the lockdown period varied between endodontic cases (n=877, 51.9%), extraction and other surgical cases (n=374, 22.1%), restorative cases (n=142, 8.4%), orthodontic treatments (n=4, 0.2%), and other procedures (n=292, 17.3%). The differences in gender and age group among all clinics were statistically significant (P<.001 and P=.02, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic had a significant effect on the number of patients seeking dental treatments. It also affected the types of treatments performed. Endodontic treatment accounted for almost 50% of patient load during the lockdown compared to approximately 20% during regular days.","Obeidat, Lina; Masarwa, Nader; AlWarawreh, Amjad; El-Naji, Waddah",Interact J Med Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33325372/; https://doi.org/10.2196/24371,159

But profiles of loneliness during the pandemic and risk factors remain unclear. OBJECTIVE: The current study aimed to examine if and how loneliness levels changed during the strict lockdown and to explore the clustering of loneliness growth trajectories. METHODS: Data from 38,217 UK adults in the UCL COVID -19 Social Study (a panel study collecting data weekly during the pandemic) were analysed during the strict lockdown period in the UK (23/03/2020–10/05/2020). The sample was well-stratified and weighted to population proportions of gender, age, ethnicity, education and geographical location. Growth mixture modelling was used to identify the latent classes of loneliness growth trajectories and their predictors. RESULTS: Analyses revealed four classes, with the baseline loneliness level ranging from low to high. In the first a few weeks of lockdown, loneliness levels increased in the highest loneliness group, decreased in the lowest loneliness group, and stayed relatively constant in the middle two groups. Younger adults (OR = 2.17–6.81), women (OR = 1.59), people with low income (OR = 1.3), the economically inactive (OR = 1.3–2.04) and people with mental health conditions (OR = 5.32) were more likely to be in highest loneliness class relative to the lowest. Further, living with others or in a rural area, and having more close friends or greater social support were protective. CONCLUSIONS: Perceived levels of loneliness under strict lockdown measures due to COVID-19 were relatively stable in the UK, but for many people these levels were high with no signs of improvement. Results suggest that more efforts are needed to address loneliness.","Bu, Feifei; Steptoe, Andrew; Fancourt, Daisy",Soc Sci Med,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2020.113521; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33257177/,159

While some IBV strains replicate locally, others can disseminate to various organs, including the kidney. Here, we elucidate the determinants for kidney tropism by studying interactions between the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the viral attachment protein spike from two IBV strains with different tropisms. Recombinantly produced RBDs from the nephropathogenic IBV strain QX and from the nonnephropathogenic strain M41 bound to the epithelial cells of the trachea. In contrast, only QX-RBD binds more extensively to cells of the digestive tract, urogenital tract, and kidneys. While removal of sialic acids from tissues prevented binding of all proteins to all tissues, binding of QX-RBD to trachea and kidney could not be blocked by preincubation with synthetic alpha-2,3-linked sialic acids. The lack of binding of QX-RBD to a previously identified IBV-M41 receptor was confirmed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), demonstrating that tissue binding of QX-RBD is dependent on a different sialylated glycan receptor. Using chimeric RBD proteins, we discovered that the region encompassing amino acids 99 to 159 of QX-RBD was required to establish kidney binding. In particular, QX-RBD amino acids 110 to 112 (KIP) were sufficient to render IBV-M41 with the ability to bind to kidney, while the reciprocal mutations in IBV-QX abolished kidney binding completely. Structural analysis of both RBDs suggests that the receptor-binding site for QX is located at a different location on the spike than that of M41. IMPORTANCE Infectious bronchitis virus is the causative agent of infectious bronchitis in chickens. Upon infection of chicken flocks, the poultry industry faces substantial economic losses by diminished egg quality and increased morbidity and mortality of infected animals. While all IBV strains infect the chicken respiratory tract via the ciliated epithelial layer of the trachea, some strains can also replicate in the kidneys, dividing IBV into the following two pathotypes: nonnephropathogenic (example, IBV-M41) and nephropathogenic viruses (including IBV-QX). Here, we set out to identify the determinants for the extended nephropathogenic tropism of IBV-QX. Our data reveal that each pathotype makes use of a different sialylated glycan ligand, with binding sites on opposite sides of the attachment protein. This knowledge should facilitate the design of antivirals to prevent coronavirus infections in the field.","Bouwman, Kim M.; Parsons, Lisa M.; Berends, Alinda J.; de Vries, Robert P.; Cipollo, John F.; Verheije, Monique H.",J Virol,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01363-19; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694947/,159

While offering the opportunity of digital visits to patients, there are also challenges for this development. The purpose of this study is to enhance the understanding of digital visits, as perceived by experts working in telemedicine companies. To serve this purpose, the authors conducted semi-structured interviews with managers and employees in eight telemedicine companies. The analysis of the empirical data confirmed the importance of digital visits and their efficiency. The potential of digital visits is expected to increase significantly, should they make use of remote devices to transfer real-time data from patients to physicians. In such a case, digital visits are expected to cover approximately 70–75% of medical cases. However, the use of remote devices must be taken with caution and specific conditions need to be taken into account. We encourage researchers to perform research on promising technologies such as artificial intelligence and remote diagnostic devices, which could make more diagnoses and conditions possible to be treated by digital visits.

The overall objective of this study was to investigate the subjective strategies for maintaining appetite applied by patients recovering from COVID-19. The study included 19 in-depth interviews, focusing on patients suffering from long-term effects of COVID-19. The results were analysed using a thematic analysis for qualitative data. Results on strategies for maintaining appetite included four key themes: (1) a focus on well-functioning senses, (2) a focus on familiar foods, (3) a focus on the eating environment, and (4) a focus on post-ingestive well-being. It was found that factors prior to, during and after food intake, as well as the context, could influence desire to eat and pleasure related to food intake. As ageusia and anosmia make characterization of food difficult, being able to recognize and memorize its flavour was important to engage in consumption. Under normal circumstances, the hedonic value of food relies predominantly on the flavour of foods. When suffering from chemosensory dysfunction, shifting focus towards the texture of food, including trigeminal stimulation during consumption, were beneficial for maintaining appetite and food-related pleasure. Furthermore, a focus on the holistic satisfying feelings of choosing healthy food, as well as a focus on other people’s enjoyment during meals were reported to boost well-being around food intake. The study elaborated our understanding of the complex consequences of COVID-19, and can be applied in health promoting initiatives targeted patients recovering from COVID-19.","Høier, Alexander Teymour Zadeh Baboli; Chaaban, Nora; Andersen, Barbara Vad",Foods,https://doi.org/10.3390/foods10020464; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33672528/,159

These factors increase the risk of the spread of infectious diseases by air travel. Little is known, however, about the extent to which airlines provide information to passengers on infection control and measures to prevent the spread of infectious diseases. This study examined the websites of the global commercial passenger airlines to see if they contained information about infection control and prevention of infectious diseases and appraised the clinical usefulness of that information. METHOD: A cross-sectional text-based analysis of the 73 airline websites from the six global commercial passenger airline conglomerates was performed to identify information about infection control and prevention of infectious between July and August 2019. RESULTS: Of the 73 airline websites, less than half (n = 35, 28.6%) contained information deemed useful for passengers. While there was a range of general health advice within the websites, there was limited information about infection control and preventing infectious diseases. A minority of websites contained information about vaccination status prior to travel, and to a lesser extent handwashing and hand hygiene, with very few including disease-specific advice or preventive measures. CONCLUSIONS: Airline websites are an underutilised source of information for infection control and the prevention of infectious diseases.

We estimated case fatality rate, cumulative recovery number, basic reproduction number (R(0)) and future incidence of COVID-19 in Bangladesh. We illustrated the spatial distribution of cases throughout the country. We performed phylogenetic and mutation analysis of SARS-CoV-2 sequences from Bangladesh. As of July 31, 2020, Bangladesh had a case fatality rate of 1.32%. The cases were initially clustered in Dhaka and its surrounding districts in March but spreads throughout the country over time. The R(0) calculated as 1.173 in Exponential Growth method. For the projection, a 20% change in R(0) with subsequent infection trend has been calculated. The genomic analysis of 292 Bangladeshi SARS-CoV-2 strains suggests diverse genomic clades L, O, S, G, GH, where predominant circulating clade was GR (83.9%; 245/292). The GR clades' phylogenetic analysis revealed distinct clusters (I to XIII) with intra-clade variations. The mutation analysis revealed 1634 mutations where 94.6% and 5.4% were non-synonymous and unique mutation, respectively. The Spike, Nucleocapsid, NSP2, and RdRP showed substantially high mutation and no mutation recorded in NSP9 and NSP11 protein. In spike (S) protein, 355 predominant mutations were recorded, highest in D614G. Alternatively, I120F in NSP2 protein, R203K and G204R in nucleocapsid protein, and P323L in RdRp were more recurrent. The Bangladeshi genomes belonged to phylogenetic lineages A, B, B.1, B.1.1, B.1.1.23, B.1.1.25, B.1.113, and B.1.36, among which 50.0% sequences owned by the pangolin lineage B.1.1.25. The study indicates the spatial distribution of SARS-CoV-2, and molecular epidemiology of Bangladeshi isolates.

671532,SARS-CoV-2 infection in children with chronic kidney disease,2021-09-14,"The function of the SARS-CoV-2 accessory protein p6, encoded by ORF6, is not fully known. Based upon its similarity to p6 from SARS-CoV, it may play a similar role, namely as an antagonist of type I interferon (IFN) signaling. Here we report the sequencing of a SARS-CoV-2 strain passaged six times after original isolation from a clinical patient in Hong Kong. The genome sequence shows a 27 nt in-frame deletion (Δ27,264-27,290) within ORF6, predicted to result in a 9 aa deletion (ΔFKVSIWNLD) from the central portion of p6. This deletion is predicted to result in a dramatic alteration in the three-dimensional structure of the resultant protein (p6Δ22-30), possibly with significant functional implications. Analysis of the original clinical sample indicates that the deletion was not present, while sequencing of subsequent passages of the strain identifies the deletion as a majority variant. This suggests that the deletion originated ab initio during passaging and subsequently propagated into the majority, possibly due to the removal of selective pressure through the IFN-deficient Vero E6 cell line. The specific function of the SARS-CoV-2 p6 N-terminus, if any, has not yet been determined. However, this deletion is predicted to cause a shift from N-endo to N-ecto in the transmembrane localization of the SARS-CoV-2 p6Δ22-30 N-terminus, possibly leading to the ablation of its native function.","Riojas, Marco A.; Frank, Andrew M.; Puthuveetil, Nikhita P.; Flores, Beth; Parker, Michael; King, Stephen P.; Peiris, Malik; Chu, Daniel K.

671593,Confronting the avian influenza threat: vaccine development for a potential pandemic,2004-07-30,"In order to reduce transmission of COVID-19, social distancing measures were proposed, including spatial distancing (2 m distance), or even generalized lockdown. Main concern was to prevent overwhelming of the healthcare systems, mainly of the intensive care units (ICUs) by decreasing the spreading of the disease. In Greece, the Government, after consulting with experts in the fields of infectious disease and epidemiology, implemented a rather aggressive stance with an early lockdown. Aim of our study, is to identify and compare the characteristics of cases referred for autopsy during the first month of the lockdown period for the COVID-19 outbreak, versus the cases referred during the same period in 2019. 231 autopsy cases were included in our study, 125 in 2019 and 106 in 2020. Regarding gender, age and nationality, no significant differences were detected between the two time periods. Age subgroup analysis demonstrated increased number of cases within the age group 70-79 years, in 2020. As to the place of death, the increase in the percentage of out-of-hospital deaths was not confirmed as statistically significant. Regarding type of death (violent, sudden/unexpected), the drop of violent deaths in the 2020 examined period, was not confirmed as statistically significant; however, further subgroup analysis showed a significant drop of fatal injuries resulting from road traffic accidents in the 2020 period. The slight increase of sudden/unexpected deaths, especially myocardial infarction cases, did not reach statistical significance. One month after lockdown, we cannot detect significant differences in the two time periods examined. Further study should be conducted soon when more data will become available. Frequency of fatal myocardial infarction seems to remain unaffected by the COVID-19 pandemic while deaths resulting from road traffic accidents exhibit a significant decrease. Homicides and suicides remain at low levels, in our jurisdiction area, seemingly unaffected by the COVID-19 outbreak and the subsequent lockdown. It appears that since sudden/unexpected deaths, statistically remain unaffected, the preventive measures taken by the Greek authorities prevented overwhelming of the healthcare system, which could function properly.","Sakelliadis, Emmanouil I.; Katsos, Konstantinos D.; Zouzia, Evmorfili I.; Spiliopoulou, Chara A.; Tsiodras, Sotirios",Forensic Sci Int,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.forsciint.2020.110365; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32563134/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0379073820302279; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0379073820302279?v=s5,159

The model is thereafter parametrized with respect to the highly virulent Schu S4 strain of Francisella tularensis, in the first such study to consider a biologically plausible mathematical model for early human infection with this bacterium. Results indicate a median infectious dose of about 23 organisms, which is higher than previously thought, and an average incubation period of between 3 and 7 days depending on dose. The distribution of incubation periods is right-skewed up to about 100 organisms and symmetric for larger doses. Moreover, there are some interesting parallels to the hypotheses of some of the classical dose–response models, such as independent action (single-hit model) and individual effective dose (probit model).

The Academy of Consultation-Liaison Psychiatry (ACLP) residency education subcommittee convened a writing group with the goal of summarizing the current evidence about outpatient consultation-liaison psychiatry (CLP) training and providing a framework for CLP educators who are interested in developing outpatient CLP rotations within their programs. METHOD: MEDLINE (via PubMed), Embase and PsycINFO (via OVID), were reviewed each from inception to December 2019, for psychiatric CLP services in ambulatory settings that involved residents or fellows. The CLP education guidelines were reviewed for recommendations relevant to outpatient CLP. We also searched MedEd portal for published curriculums relevant to CLP. The group held 2 conferences to reach consensus about recommendations in setting up outpatient CLP rotations. RESULTS: Seventeen articles, three ACLP supported guidelines, and eight online didactic resources were identified as directly reporting on the organization and/or impact of an outpatient CLP rotation. These manuscripts indicated that residents found outpatient CLP rotations effective and relevant to their future careers. However, the literature provided few recommendations for establishing formal outpatient CLP training experiences. DISCUSSION: Outpatient CLP rotations offer multiple benefits for trainees, including exposure to specific clinical scenarios and therapeutic interventions applicable only in the outpatient setting, increased continuity of care and the unique experience of providing liaison and education to non-mental health providers. The article outlines recommendations and examples for developing outpatient CLP rotations which CLP educators can incorporate in their programs.","Zimbrean, Paula C.; Ernst, Carrie L.; Forray, Ariadna; Beach, Scott R.; Lavakumar, Mallika; Siegel, Andrew M.; Soeprono, Thomas; Schwartz, Ann C.",Psychosomatics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32650995/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0033318220301420; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0033318220301420?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psym.2020.05.004,159
676593,MHC Haplotyping of SARS-CoV-2 Patients: HLA Subtypes Are Not Associated with the Presence and Severity of COVID-19 in the Israeli Population,2021-05-29,"Bacteriophage (phage), which are viruses that infect bacteria only, have shown promise as vehicles for targeted cancer gene therapy, albeit with poor efficiency. Recently, we generated an improved version of phage vectors by incorporating cis genetic elements of adeno‐associated virus (AAV). This novel AAV/phage hybrid (AAVP) efficiently delivered systemically administered therapeutic genes to various tumor targets by displaying an integrin tumor‐targeting ligand on the phage capsid. However, inherent limitations in bacteriophage mean that these AAVP vectors still need to be improved. One of the limitations of AAVP in mammalian cells may be its susceptibility to proteasomal degradation. The proteasome is upregulated in cancer and it is known that it constitutes a barrier to gene delivery by certain eukaryotic viruses. We report here that inhibition of proteasome improved targeted reporter gene delivery by AAVP in cancer cells in vitro and in tumors in vivo after intravenous vector administration to tumor‐bearing mice. We also show enhanced targeted tumor cell killing by AAVP upon proteasome inhibition. The AAVP particles persisted significantly in cancer cells in vitro and in tumors in vivo after systemic administration, and accumulated polyubiquitinated coat proteins. Our results suggest that the proteasome is indeed a barrier to tumor targeting by AAVP and indicate that a combination of proteasome‐inhibiting drugs and AAVP should be considered for clinical anticancer therapy.","Przystal, Justyna M.; Umukoro, Eloho; Stoneham, Charlotte A.; Yata, Teerapong; O'Neill, Kevin; Syed, Nelofer; Hajitou, Amin",Mol Oncol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22951279/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molonc.2012.08.001,159

678237,Antibody response to SARS‐CoV‐2 messenger RNA vaccines in liver transplant recipients,2021-08-18,"The nuclear pore complex is the sole gateway connecting the nucleoplasm and cytoplasm. In humans, the nuclear pore complex is one of the largest multiprotein assemblies in the cell, with a molecular mass of ∼110 MDa and consisting of 8 to 64 copies of about 34 different nuclear pore proteins, termed nucleoporins, for a total of 1000 subunits per pore. Trafficking events across the nuclear pore are mediated by nuclear transport receptors and are highly regulated. The nuclear pore complex is also used by several RNA viruses and almost all DNA viruses to access the host cell nucleoplasm for replication. Viruses hijack the nuclear pore complex, and nuclear transport receptors, to access the nucleoplasm where they replicate. In addition, the nuclear pore complex is used by the cell innate immune system, a network of signal transduction pathways that coordinates the first response to foreign invaders, including viruses and other pathogens. Several branches of this response depend on dynamic signaling events that involve the nuclear translocation of downstream signal transducers. Mounting evidence has shown that these signaling cascades, especially those steps that involve nucleocytoplasmic trafficking events, are targeted by viruses so that they can evade the innate immune system. This review summarizes how nuclear pore proteins and nuclear transport receptors contribute to the innate immune response and highlights how viruses manipulate this cellular machinery to favor infection. A comprehensive understanding of nuclear pore proteins in antiviral innate immunity will likely contribute to the development of new antiviral therapeutic strategies.","Shen, Qingtang; Wang, Yifan E.; Palazzo, Alexander F.",J Biol Chem,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34097873/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbc.2021.100856,159

The type I interferon (IFN-I or IFN α/β) is a key mediator of innate antiviral response during virus infection. Different antagonistic strategies have been identified and determined as to how PEDV infection inhibits the host’s IFN responses to escape the host innate immune pathway, but the pathogenic mechanisms of PEDV infection are not fully elucidated. Our preliminary results revealed that endogenous TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) and interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), the key components in the IFN signaling pathway were downregulated in PEDV infected IPEC-J2 cells by iTRAQ analysis. In this study, we screened nsp15 as the most important viral encoded protein involved in TBK1 and IRF3 reduction. Endoribonuclease (EndoU) activity has been well determined for coronavirus nsp15. Three residues (H226, H241, and K282) of PEDV nsp15 were identified as critical amino acids for PEDV EndoU but not D265, which was not well correlated with published results of other coronaviruses, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome virus (SARS-CoV). Moreover, PEDV nsp15 can directly degrade the RNA levels of TBK1 and IRF3 dependent on its EndoU activity to suppress IFN production and constrain the induction of IFN stimulated genes (ISGs), by which PEDV antagonizes the host innate response to facilitate its replication. Collectively, these results have confirmed that PEDV nsp15 was capable of subverting the IFN response by the RNA degradation of TBK1 and IRF3.","Wu, Yang; Zhang, Hongling; Shi, Zhaorong; Chen, Jianfei; Li, Mingwei; Shi, Hongyan; Shi, Da; Guo, Longjun; Feng, Li",Viruses,https://doi.org/10.3390/v12060599; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32486349/,159

It is still a pandemic and poses major health problem across the globe. In our review, clinical characteristics and laboratory parameters of COVID-19 patients were compiled systematically, with special reference to pregnant women in order to understand the disease course. An extensive literature search on various scientific databases for relevant manuscripts was conducted, which yielded 7 manuscripts for final analysis. The most common symptoms were fever (85%), cough (70.63%), chest tightness (37.36%), expectoration (33.27%), fatigue (32%), dyspnea (31.95%), and shortness of breath (31.19%), while hemoptysis (1.0%) was the least common. The associated comorbidities were hypertension (21.6%) and diabetes (10.0%). In terms of hematological parameters, lower total leukocyte counts were observed in 65% of cases and biochemical parameters, patients demonstrated elevated levels of albumin (53.72%), lactate dehydrogenase (45.71%), and natriuretic peptide (34.84%); however, total bilirubin was elevated in only 8% of cases.

NLR may be used as an early marker of poor prognosis in patients with COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the prognostic value of the NLR in patients diagnosed with COVID-19. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis. Observational studies that reported the association between baseline NLR values (ie, at hospital admission) and severity or all-cause mortality in COVID-19 patients were included. The quality of the studies was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS). Random effects models and inverse variance method were used for meta-analyses. The effects were expressed as odds ratios (ORs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Small study effects were assessed with the Egger's test. RESULTS: We analysed 61 studies (n = 15 522 patients), 58 cohorts, and 3 case-control studies. An increase of one unit of NLR was associated with higher odds of severity (OR 6.22; 95%CI 4.93 to 7.84; P < .001) and higher odds of all-cause mortality (OR 12.6; 95%CI 6.88 to 23.06; P < .001). In our sensitivity analysis, we found that 41 studies with low risk of bias and moderate heterogeneity (I2 = 53% and 58%) maintained strong association between NLR values and both outcomes (severity: OR 5.36; 95% CI 4.45 to 6.45; P < .001; mortality: OR 10.42 95% CI 7.73 to 14.06; P = .005).

Literature search has been carried out extensively to gather significant findings on immunomodulating activities of these plants. The immunomodulatory effects of Curcuma species were critically analyzed, and future research strategies and appropriate perspectives on the plants as source of new immunomodulators were discussed. Most of the pharmacological investigations to evaluate their immunomodulatory effects were in vivo and in vitro experiments on the crude extracts of the plants. The extracts were not chemically characterized or standardized. Of all the Curcuma species investigated, the immunomodulatory effects of C. longa were the most studied. Most of the bioactive metabolites responsible for the immunomodulating activities were not determined, and mechanistic studies to understand the underlying mechanisms were scanty. There are limited clinical studies to confirm their efficacy in human. Of all the bioactive metabolites, only curcumin is undergoing extensive clinical trials based on its anti-inflammatory properties and main use as an adjuvant for the treatment of cancer.

Also, controversy exists if and to what extent AI should be incorporated into radiology residency programs. METHODS: Between April and July 2019, an international survey took place on AI regarding its impact on the profession and training. The survey was accessible for radiologists and residents and distributed through several radiological societies. Relationships of independent variables with opinions, hurdles, and education were assessed using multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS: The survey was completed by 1041 respondents from 54 countries. A majority (n = 855, 82%) expects that AI will cause a change to the radiology field within 10 years. Most frequently, expected roles of AI in clinical practice were second reader (n = 829, 78%) and work-flow optimization (n = 802, 77%). Ethical and legal issues (n = 630, 62%) and lack of knowledge (n = 584, 57%) were mentioned most often as hurdles to implementation. Expert respondents added lack of labelled images and generalizability issues. A majority (n = 819, 79%) indicated that AI should be incorporated in residency programs, while less support for imaging informatics and AI as a subspecialty was found (n = 241, 23%). CONCLUSIONS: Broad community demand exists for incorporation of AI into residency programs. Based on the results of the current study, integration of AI education seems advisable for radiology residents, including issues related to data management, ethics, and legislation. KEY POINTS: • There is broad demand from the radiological community to incorporate AI into residency programs, but there is less support to recognize imaging informatics as a radiological subspecialty. • Ethical and legal issues and lack of knowledge are recognized as major bottlenecks for AI implementation by the radiological community, while the shortage in labeled data and IT-infrastructure issues are less often recognized as hurdles. • Integrating AI education in radiology curricula including technical aspects of data management, risk of bias, and ethical and legal issues may aid successful integration of AI into diagnostic radiology.","Huisman, Merel; Ranschaert, Erik; Parker, William; Mastrodicasa, Domenico; Koci, Martin; Pinto de Santos, Daniel; Coppola, Francesca; Morozov, Sergey; Zins, Marc; Bohyn, Cedric; Koç, Ural; Wu, Jie; Veean, Satyam; Fleischmann, Dominik; Leiner, Tim; Willemink, Martin J.",Eur Radiol,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00330-021-07782-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33974148/,159
682315,The first 2019 novel coronavirus case in Nepal,2020-02-10,"Understanding the outbreak dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic has important implications for successful containment and mitigation strategies. Recent studies suggest that the population prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, a proxy for the number of asymptomatic cases, could be an order of magnitude larger than expected from the number of reported symptomatic cases. Knowing the precise prevalence and contagiousness of asymptomatic transmission is critical to estimate the overall dimension and pandemic potential of COVID-19. However, at this stage, the effect of the asymptomatic population, its size, and its outbreak dynamics remain largely unknown. Here we use reported symptomatic case data in conjunction with antibody seroprevalence studies, a mathematical epidemiology model, and a Bayesian framework to infer the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19. Our model computes, in real time, the time-varying contact rate of the outbreak, and projects the temporal evolution and credible intervals of the effective reproduction number and the symptomatic, asymptomatic, and recovered populations. Our study quantifies the sensitivity of the outbreak dynamics of COVID-19 to three parameters: the effective reproduction number, the ratio between the symptomatic and asymptomatic populations, and the infectious periods of both groups. For nine distinct locations, our model estimates the fraction of the population that has been infected and recovered by Jun 15, 2020 to 24.15% (95% CI: 20.48%-28.14%) for Heinsberg (NRW, Germany), 2.40% (95% CI: 2.09%-2.76%) for Ada County (ID, USA), 46.19% (95% CI: 45.81%-46.60%) for New York City (NY, USA), 11.26% (95% CI: 7.21%-16.03%) for Santa Clara County (CA, USA), 3.09% (95% CI: 2.27%-4.03%) for Denmark, 12.35% (95% CI: 10.03%-15.18%) for Geneva Canton (Switzerland), 5.24% (95% CI: 4.84%-5.70%) for the Netherlands, 1.53% (95% CI: 0.76%-2.62%) for Rio Grande do Sul (Brazil), and 5.32% (95% CI: 4.77%-5.93%) for Belgium. Our method traces the initial outbreak date in Santa Clara County back to January 20, 2020 (95% CI: December 29, 2019–February 13, 2020). Our results could significantly change our understanding and management of the COVID-19 pandemic: A large asymptomatic population will make isolation, containment, and tracing of individual cases challenging. Instead, managing community transmission through increasing population awareness, promoting physical distancing, and encouraging behavioral changes could become more relevant.","Peirlinck, Mathias; Linka, Kevin; Sahli Costabal, Francisco; Bhattacharya, Jay; Bendavid, Eran; Ioannidis, John P.A.; Kuhl, Ellen",Comput Methods Appl Mech Eng,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0045782520305958; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33518823/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0045782520305958; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cma.2020.113410,159

The SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein is responsible for mediating viral attachment and fusion with cell membranes. Mutations in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S-protein occur at the most variable part of the SARS-CoV-2 genome, and specific sites of S-protein have undergone positive selection impacting the viral pathogenicity. In the present work, we used high-throughput computation to design 100,000 mutants in RBD interfacial residues and identify novel affinity-enhancing and affinity-weakening mutations. Our data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 can establish a higher rate of infectivity and pathogenesis when it acquires combinatorial mutations at the interfacial residues in RBD. Mapping of the mutational landscape of the interaction site suggests that a few of these residues are the hot-spot residues with a very high tendency to undergo positive selection. Knowledge of the affinity-enhancing mutations may guide the identification of potential cold-spots for this mutation as targets for developing a possible therapeutic strategy instead of hot-spots, and vice versa. Understanding of the molecular interactions between the virus and host protein presents a detailed systems view of viral infection mechanisms. The applications of the present research can be explored in multiple antiviral strategies, including monoclonal antibody therapy, vaccine design, and importantly in understanding the clinical pathogenesis of the virus itself.

We performed a prospective study to investigate seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among staff and cancer patients at a large cancer centre, at the end of the period of first national lockdown in France, and to determine factors associated with the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: After the first lockdown, all medical and non-medical staff, and all patients attending the medical oncology department were invited to undergo serological testing for SARS-CoV-2 between 11 May and 30 June 2020. All participants were also invited to complete a questionnaire collecting data about their living and working conditions, and for patients, medical management during lockdown. FINDINGS: A total of 1,674 subjects (663 staff members, 1011 patients) were included. Seroprevalence was low in both staff (1.8%) and patients (1.7%), despite more features of high risk for severe forms among patients. None of the risk factors tested in our analysis (working or living conditions, comorbidities, management characteristics during lockdown) was found to be statistically associated with seroprevalence in either staff or patients. There was no significant difference in the proportion of symptomatic and asymptomatic subjects between staff and patients. Only fever, loss of smell and loss of taste were significantly more frequent among seropositive patients, in both staff and patients. INTERPRETATION: We report very low seroprevalence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in the staff (caregiving and non-caregiving) and patients of a large cancer care centre in which strict hygiene, personal protection and social distancing measures were implemented.","Ladoire, Sylvain; Goussot, Vincent; Redersdorff, Emilie; Cueff, Adele; Ballot, Elise; Truntzer, Caroline; Ayati, Siavoshe; Bengrine-Lefevre, Leila; Bremaud, Nathalie; Coudert, Bruno; Desmoulins, Isabelle; Favier, Laure; Fraisse, Cléa; Fumet, Jean-David; Hanu, Roxana; Hennequin, Audrey; Hervieu, Alice; Ilie, Silvia; Kaderbhai, Courèche; Lagrange, Aurélie; Martin, Nils; Mazilu, Irina; Mayeur, Didier; Palmier, Rémi; Simonet-Lamm, Anne-Laure; Vincent, Julie; Zanetta, Sylvie; Arnould, Laurent; Coutant, Charles; Bertaut, Aurélie; Ghiringhelli, François",Eur J Cancer,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959804921001246?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33780664/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0959804921001246; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejca.2021.02.027,159
685873,Anticipated and current preventive behaviors in response to an anticipated human-to-human H5N1 epidemic in the Hong Kong Chinese general population,2007-03-15,"Introduction: The main clinical manifestation of the novel Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is respiratory issues. Neurological manifestations are being increasingly recognized, including febrile seizures, headache, dizziness, and myalgia, as well as encephalopathy, encephalitis, stroke, and acute peripheral nerve diseases. Cerebral vasculitis is rarely reported. We describe a case of SARS-CoV-2 interstitial pneumonia complicated by flaccid tetraplegia due to Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS) associated with a cerebral vasculitis-like pattern. Case description: A 62-year-old man was hospitalized for cough, fever, and severe respiratory failure requiring tracheal intubation and invasive ventilation. The chest Computerized Tomography (CT) showed images related to interstitial pneumonia and the subsequent nasopharyngeal swab confirmed the presence of SARS-CoV-2 infection. During the hospitalization, there was a progressive deterioration of the senses associated with areflexic flaccid tetraplegia. The treatment with high doses of immunoglobulin G (IgG) led to the immediate improvement of the general conditions and a partial response in terms of recovery of the upper limb and of the distal lower limb movements. Subsequently the patient was admitted to our Rehabilitation Unit, where he received an intensive rehabilitation treatment consisting of physiotherapy and occupational therapy. Two months later the patient was discharged at home and able to walk independently even for long distances thanks to the use of Ankle-Foot Orthosis (AFO). Conclusion: In this report, we present the case of a patient with peripheral and central neurological damage occurred later severe pneumonia induced by SARS-CoV-2. The Immunoglobulin G therapy allowed the patient to benefit considerably from early rehabilitation, reaching the walking, increasing the independence in daily living tasks, and enabling safe discharge from hospital to home. Related neurologic complications of SARS-CoV-2 infection suffer a lack of understanding and further investigations should be conducted.","Colonna, Stefano; Sciumé, Luciana; Giarda, Federico; Innocenti, Alessandro; Beretta, Giovanna; Dalla Costa, Davide",Front Neurol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33488499/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fneur.2020.602554,159

It is assumed that the society consists of four compartments; susceptibles (S), infecteds at large (simply called infecteds) (I), quarantined patients (Q) and recovered individuals (R), and the time evolution of the pandemic is described by a set of ordinary differential equations. It is shown that the quarantine rate can be determined from the time dependence of the daily confirmed new cases, from which the number of the infecteds at large can be estimated. The number of daily confirmed new cases is shown to be proportional to the number of infecteds a characteristic time earlier, and the infection rate and quarantine rate are determined for the period from mid-February to mid-April in Japan, and transmission characteristics of the initial stages of the outbreak in Japan are analyzed. The effectiveness of different measures is discussed for controlling the outbreak and it is shown that identifying patients through PCR testing and isolating them in a quarantine is more effective than lockdown measures aimed at inhibiting social interactions of the general population. An effective reproduction number for infecteds at large is introduced which is appropriate to epidemics controlled by quarantine measures.","Odagaki, T.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.02.20117341; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.06.02.20117341v1?rss=1,159

The revised global measles mortality reduction goal set forth in the WHO-UNICEF Global Immunization Vision and Strategy for 2006–2015 is to reduce measles deaths by 90% by 2010 compared to the estimated 757,000 deaths in 2000. The possibility of measles eradication has been discussed for almost 40 years, and measles meets many of the criteria for eradication. Global measles eradication will face a number of challenges to achieving and sustaining high levels of vaccine coverage and population immunity, including population growth and demographic changes, conflict and political instability, and public perceptions of vaccine safety. To achieve the measles mortality reduction goal, continued progress needs to be made in delivering measles vaccines to the world's children.","Moss, W.

Materials & methods Bioinformatics tools were used to analyse and predict cis-acting regulatory elements by obtaining viral sequences from available databases. Results Computational analysis prediction revealed the presence of RNA stem-loop structures within the 3’ end of the ORF1ab region that are analogous to the previously identified SARS-CoV genomic packaging signals. Alignment-based RNA secondary structures prediction of the 5’ end of the SARS-CoV-2 genome identified also conserved CREs. Conclusion These CREs could be used as potential targets for a vaccine and/or antiviral therapeutics developments; however, further studies would be required to confirm their roles in the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle.","Alhatlani, Bader Y.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.23.167916,159
687984,Biodefence research two decades on: worth the investment?,2021,"Point of care (PoC) diagnostics are at the focus of government initiatives, NGOs and fundamental research alike. In high-income countries, the hope is to streamline the diagnostic procedure, minimize costs and make healthcare processes more efficient and faster, which, in some cases, can be more a matter of convenience than necessity. However, in resource-limited settings such as low-income countries, PoC-diagnostics might be the only viable route, when the next laboratory is hours away. Therefore, it is especially important to focus research into novel diagnostics for these countries in order to alleviate suffering due to infectious disease. In this review, the current research describing the use of PoC diagnostics in resource-limited settings and the potential bottlenecks along the value chain that prevent their widespread application is summarized. To this end, we will look at literature that investigates different parts of the value chain, such as fundamental research and market economics, as well as actual use at healthcare providers. We aim to create an integrated picture of potential PoC barriers, from the first start of research at universities to patient treatment in the field. Results from the literature will be discussed with the aim to bring all important steps and aspects together in order to illustrate how effectively PoC is being used in low-income countries. In addition, we discuss what is needed to improve the situation further, in order to use this technology to its fullest advantage and avoid “leaks in the pipeline”, when a promising device fails to take the next step of the valorization pathway and is abandoned.","Heidt, Benjamin; Siqueira, Williane F.; Eersels, Kasper; Diliën, Hanne; van Grinsven, Bart; Fujiwara, Ricardo T.; Cleij, Thomas J.",Biosensors (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32987809/; https://doi.org/10.3390/bios10100133,159

Purpose: Although the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, has been viably controlled in China, a new normal in healthcare strategies has become standard in China and worldwide. We conducted a questionnaire study to disseminate the experience from China in terms of urology outpatient prevention and control measures under standardized prevention policies against COVID-19. Participants and Methods: From May 3, 2020 to June 25, 2020, we conducted an anonymous cross-sectional questionnaire study, focused on the status of and experiences with outpatient urology prevention and control measures during the COVID-19 pandemic. The targeted respondents were urologists in mainland China, covering all levels of hospitals and clinics. Results: A total of 216 (97%) valid responses were collected. We found that 183 (85%) respondents were from outside of Hubei province in China. One-hundred-and-fifty-eight (73%) respondents believed that SARS-CoV-2 could be detected in urine, and that protection against urine exposure was needed. Over 80% of respondents recommended WeChat application or similar online video meetings for virtual outpatient consultations. The suggested flowcharts and recommendations to prevent new cases were easy to understand and approved by most physicians, which could provide reference for outpatient prevention and control. We still need to make adequate preparations under the new normal of the COVID-19 Epidemic, especially for those suspected of being infected. Conclusions: Although the scientific validation of the questionnaire is limited, it provides a first snapshot of the experiences relating to the prevention and control measures in urology clinics in China, and can inform future policies in this field.","Zhu, Xiao-Liang; Jiang, Hai-Hong; Jiang, Ming-Hui; Liu, Wen-Li; Sheng, Zi-Lu; Liu, Jia-Hui; Wang, Meihao",Front Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.670889; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34490178/,159

However, prognostic role of coinfection remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: Evaluate relation between respiratory viral confection and illness severity in children. STUDY DESIGN: MEDLINE (through PUBMED), EMBASE, EBSCO, LILACS databases were searched up to March 2015 by two independent reviewers. Studies assessing severity of viral coinfection in patients aged less than 18 years were included. Standardized forms were used for data extraction of population, study design, clinical syndromes, virus combinations compared and severity outcomes. Risk of bias and quality of evidence were assessed through EPHPP and GRADE. Subgroup analysis was performed according to age and viral combinations. RESULTS: Of 5218 records screened, 43 were included in analysis. Viral coinfection did not influence risks of all outcomes assessed: length of stay (mean difference in days in coinfection, −0.10 [95% confidence interval: −0.51 to 0.31]), length of supplemental oxygen (−0.42 [−1.05 to 0.20]), need of hospitalization (odds ratio of coinfection, 0.96 [95% confidence interval: 0.61–1.51]), supplemental oxygen (0.94 [0.66 to 1.34]), need of intensive care (0.99 [0.64 to 1.54]), mechanical ventilation (0.81 [0.33 to 2.01]) and death (2.22 [0.83 to 5.95]). Sub-analyses according to age and viral combinations have not shown influence of these factors in outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Respiratory viral coinfection did not increase severity in all outcomes assessed. Further studies are necessary to confirm this finding, especially regarding role of specific viral interactions.","Scotta, Marcelo Comerlato; Chakr, Valentina Coutinho Baldoto Gava; de Moura, Angela; Becker, Rafaela Garces; de Souza, Ana Paula Duarte; Jones, Marcus Herbert; Pinto, Leonardo Araújo; Sarria, Edgar Enrique; Pitrez, Paulo Marcio; Stein, Renato Tetelbom; Mattiello, Rita",J Clin Virol,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2016.04.019; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27155055/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653216300865; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653216300865,159
