This positive single-stranded RNA virus is a member of the Flaviviridae family, which notably includes dengue, tick-borne, West Nile, Zika as well as yellow fever, and transmits to humans by infected mosquitos. The main site of interactions for antibodies against this virus is the envelope protein domain III (ED3). The present report investigates the time-dependent structural and conformational changes of JEV ED3 functional epitopes and escape mutants by computer simulations. The results indicate the presence of significant structural differences between the functional epitopes and the escape mutants. Mutation-induced structural/conformational instabilities of this type can decrease the antibody neutralization activity. Among the different escape mutants studied here, Ser40Lys/Asp41Arg appear to be most unstable, while Ser40Glu/Asp41Leu exhibit the lowest structural variations. The highest level of escape mutation observed in Ser40Lys is linked to the relatively higher values of root mean square deviation/fluctuation found in the molecular dynamics simulation of this protein. Secondary-structure deviations and depletion of H bonding are other contributing factors to the protein’s increased instability. Overall, the proteins with residue 41 mutations are found to be structurally more ordered than those with residue 40 mutations. The detailed time-based structural assessment of the mutant epitopes described here may contribute to the development of novel vaccines and antiviral drugs necessary to defend against future outbreaks of JEV escape mutants.

Yet, little is known about the experience of living with and managing HIV over decades. The present study took a qualitative approach and used the lens of symbolic violence, a type of internalized, non-physical violence manifested in the power differential between social groups. We focused on adult African American/Black and Latinx (AABL) PLWH from low-SES backgrounds. METHODS: Data were drawn from two studies with AABL PLWH in New York City (N = 59). After providing signed informed consent, participants engaged in in-depth semi-structured interviews on aspects of HIV management. Interviews were audio-recorded and professionally transcribed verbatim, and data were analyzed using directed qualitative content analysis. RESULTS: Participants in the two studies were comparable on sociodemographic and background characteristics. They had lived with HIV for 20 years, on average (range 3–33 years). All were from low-SES backgrounds and most were African American/Black and men. Participants experienced a convergence of multiple social exclusions, harms, and stigmas, consistent with symbolic violence, which contributed to disengagement from HIV care and discontinuation of HIV medications. We organized results into five sub-themes: (1) participants were “ground down” over time by material, social, and emotional challenges and this diminished self-worth and, at times, the will to live; (2) social isolation and self-isolation, based in part on feeling devalued and dehumanized, served as stigma-avoidance strategies and mechanisms of social exclusion; (3) stigmatizing aspects of patient-provider interactions, both experienced and anticipated, along with (4) restricted autonomy in HIV care and other settings (e.g., parole) reduced engagement; and (5) poor HIV management was internalized as a personal failure. Importantly, resilience was evident throughout the five sub-themes. CONCLUSIONS: Symbolic violence is a useful framework for understanding long-term HIV management and survivorship among AABL PLWH from low-SES backgrounds. Indeed, forms of symbolic violence are internalized over time (e.g., experiencing devaluation, dehumanization, loss of self-worth, and anticipated stigma), thereby impeding successful HIV management, in part because avoiding HIV care and discontinuing HIV medications are primary coping strategies. Results have implications for interventions in community and health care settings.","Freeman, Robert; Gwadz, Marya; Wilton, Leo; Collins, Linda M.; Dorsen, Caroline; Hawkins, Robert L.; Silverman, Elizabeth; Martinez, Belkis Y.; Leonard, Noelle R.; Applegate, Amanda; Cluesman, Sabrina",Int J Equity Health,599,1

Due to the rigidity of the skull, edema-induced increase of intracranial fluid significantly complicates severe CNS injuries by raising intracranial pressure and compromising perfusion. Mortality due to cerebral edema is high. With mortality rates up to 80% in severe cases of stroke, it is the leading cause of death within the first week. Similarly, cerebral edema is devastating for patients of TBI, accounting for up to 50% mortality. Currently, the available treatments for cerebral edema include hypothermia, osmotherapy, and surgery. However, these treatments only address the symptoms and often elicit adverse side effects, potentially in part due to non-specificity. There is an urgent need to identify effective pharmacological treatments for cerebral edema. Currently, ion channels represent the third-largest target class for drug development, but their roles in cerebral edema remain ill-defined. The present review aims to provide an overview of the proposed roles of ion channels and transporters (including aquaporins, SUR1-TRPM4, chloride channels, glucose transporters, and proton-sensitive channels) in mediating cerebral edema in acute ischemic stroke and TBI. We also focus on the pharmacological inhibitors for each target and potential therapeutic strategies that may be further pursued for the treatment of cerebral edema.","Luo, Zheng-wei; Ovcjak, Andrea; Wong, Raymond; Yang, Bao-xue; Feng, Zhong-ping; Sun, Hong-shuo",Acta Pharmacol Sin,599,1

Samples were analyzed through structural equation modelling (SEM) to test the model. Results showed that Taiwanese college students did not have optimistic bias but Chinese students did. The models showed that both Taiwanese and Chinese students’ consumption cognition significantly influenced their purchase intention, and news attention significantly influenced only Chinese students’ purchase intention. Model comparison analysis suggested significant differences between the models for Taiwan and mainland China. The results revealed that optimistic bias can be reduced in different social contexts as that of the Taiwan model and the mainland Chinese model found in this study were indeed different. This study also confirmed that people had optimistic bias on food safety issues, based on which recommendations were made to increase public awareness of food safety as well as to improve government’s certification system.","Wang, Guan-Yun; Yueh, Hsiu-Ping",Foods,599,1

We have shown previously that the administration of immunobiotic Lactobacillus plantarum (Lp) directly to the respiratory tract prevents lethal inflammatory responses to subsequent infection with a mouse respiratory virus pathogen. While Lp-mediated protective responses involve non-redundant contributions of both Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) and NOD2, the cellular basis of these findings remains unclear. Here, we address the impact of Lp and its capacity to suppress inflammation in virus-infected respiratory epithelial cells in two cell culture models. We found that both MLE-12 cells and polarized mouse tracheal epithelial cells (mTECs) were susceptible to infection with Influenza A and released proinflammatory cytokines, including CCL2, CCL5, CXCL1, and CXCL10, in response to replicating virus. MLE-12 cells express NOD2 (81 ± 6.3%) and TLR2 (19 ± 4%), respond to Lp, and are TLR2-specific, but not NOD2-specific, biochemical agonists. By contrast, we found that mTECs express NOD2 (81 ± 17%) but minimal TLR2 (0.93 ± 0.58%); nonetheless, mTECs respond to Lp and the TLR2 agonist, Pam2CSK4, but not NOD2 agonists or the bifunctional TLR2-NOD2 agonist, CL-429. Although MLE-12 cells and mTECS were both activated by Lp, little to no cytokine suppression was observed in response to Lp followed by virus infection via a protocol that replicated experimental conditions that were effective in vivo. Further study and a more complex approach may be required to reveal critical factors that suppress virus-induced inflammatory responses.","Mai, Eric; Percopo, Caroline M.; Limkar, Ajinkya R.; Sek, Albert C.; Ma, Michelle; Rosenberg, Helene F.",Viruses,599,1

Material and Methods: This study included 15 patients with LBP and 15 healthy controls. All participants were instructed to sit on a height-adjustable chair with their knee and hip joints bent at 90° for 30 min, in slumped sitting postures. Surface electromyography was used to assess the median frequency of the internal obliques (IO)/transversus abdominis (TrA) and multifidus (MF) muscles. Perceived discomfort was measured using a Borg category ratio-scale. Median frequency of the trunk muscles and perceived discomfort after 30 min of sitting were compared with baseline. Result: There were no significant differences within the group and between both groups in the median frequency of bilateral IO and MF muscles. The LBP group showed significantly greater perceived discomfort after prolonged sitting, as compared to the control group. Conclusions: Prolonged sitting with slumped posture could increase the risk of experiencing lower back discomfort.","Jung, Kyoung-Sim; Jung, Jin-Hwa; In, Tae-Sung; Cho, Hwi-Young",Medicina (Kaunas),599,1

As TFF2 has tissue repair and protection properties, this suggests that HF diet-induced Tff2 production and the resulting TFF2 mucosal protective effects would be a mechanism to counteract the HF diet-induced tissue damage. On the other hand, the induction of Tff2 by HF diet could indicate that TFF2 is a food intake regulator (appetite control) since Tff2 is also expressed in the brain. This highlights the importance of exploring TFF2-related pathways in the context of obesity management towards potential therapies. ABSTRACT: Physiological homeostasis requires a balance between the immunological functions and the resulting damage/side effects of the immunological reactions including those related to high-fat (HF) diet. Within this context, whereas HF diet, through diverse mechanisms (such as inflammation), leads to immune-mediated damage, trefoil factor family member 2 (Tff2) represents a HF diet-induced gene. On the other hand, TFF2 both promotes tissue repair and reduces inflammation. These properties are towards counteracting the immune-mediated damage resulting from the HF diet. These observations suggest that the HF diet-induction of Tff2 could be a regulatory pathway aiming to counteract the immune-mediated damage resulting from the HF diet. Interestingly, since Tff2 expression increases with HF diet and with Tff2 also expressed in the brain, we also hypothesize that TFF2 could be a HF diet-induced food intake-control signal that reduces appetite. This hypothesis fits with counteracting the immune damage since reducing the food intake will reduce the HF intake and therefore, reduces the HF diet-induced tissue damage. Such food intake signaling would be an indirect mechanism by which TFF2 promotes tissue repair as well as a pathway worth exploring for potential obesity management pharmacotherapies.","Ghanemi, Abdelaziz; Yoshioka, Mayumi; St-Amand, Jonny",Animals (Basel),599,1

Consequently, it is of paramount importance to identify accurate predictors of NIV outcome. The aim of our preliminary study is to evaluate the Diaphragmatic Thickening Fraction (DTF) and the respiratory rate/DTF ratio as predictors of NIV outcome in de-novo ARF patients. METHODS: Over 36 months, we studied patients admitted to the emergency department with a diagnosis of de-novo ARF and requiring NIV treatment. DTF and respiratory rate/DTF ratio were measured by 2 trained operators at baseline, at 1, 4, 12, 24, 48, 72 and 96 h of NIV treatment and/or until NIV discontinuation or intubation. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed to evaluate the ability of DTF and respiratory rate/DTF ratio to distinguish between patients who were successfully weaned and those who failed. RESULTS: Eighteen patients were included. We found overall good repeatability of DTF assessment, with Intra-class Correlation Coefficient (ICC) of 0.82 (95% confidence interval 0.72–0.88). The cut-off values of DTF for prediction of NIV failure were < 36.3% and < 37.1% for the operator 1 and 2 (p < 0.0001), respectively. The cut-off value of respiratory rate/DTF ratio for prediction of NIV failure was > 0.6 for both operators (p < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: DTF and respiratory rate/DTF ratio may both represent valid, feasible and noninvasive tools to predict NIV outcome in patients with de-novo ARF.

This paper examined differences in work factors between construction sectors and examined the association between sector and health behaviors, health outcomes, and work outcomes. We surveyed 929 male construction apprentices (44% residential and 56% commercial) and found that residential apprentices reported fewer workplace safety policies, higher frequency of heavy lifting, and greater likelihood of reporting musculoskeletal pain compared to apprentices in commercial work. Residential apprentices reported higher job strain, lower supervisor support, more lost workdays due to pain or injury, and lower productivity related to health than commercial apprentices. Multivariate Poisson regression models controlling for multiple work factors showed that residential construction work, high job strain, heavy lifting, low coworker support, and low supervisor support were each independently associated with one or more work or health outcomes. These findings suggest that interventions should seek to improve coworker and supervisory supportive behaviors, decrease job strain, and reduce organizational stressors, such as mandatory overtime work. Our study shows disparities in health and safety between construction sectors and highlights the need for interventions tailored to the residential sector.","Dale, Ann Marie; Rohlman, Diane S.; Hayibor, Lisa; Evanoff, Bradley A.",Int J Environ Res Public Health,599,1

So far, BPA toxicity has been largely investigated on different biological processes, from reproduction to development, immune system, and metabolism. In zebrafish, Danio rerio, previous studies revealed the ability of environmentally relevant concentrations of this contaminant to significantly impair fertility via epigenetic modification. In addition, several studies demonstrated the ability of different probiotic strains to improve organism health. This study provides information on the role of the probiotic mixture SLAb51 to counteract adverse BPA effects on reproduction. A 28-day trial was set up with different experimental groups: BPA, exposed to 10 µg/L BPA; P, receiving a dietary supplementation of SLAb51 at a final concentration of 10(9) CFU/g; BPA+P exposed to 10 µg/L BPA and receiving SLAb51 at a final concentration of 10(9) CFU/g and a C group. Since oocyte growth and maturation represent key aspects for fertility in females, studies were performed on isolated class III (vitellogenic) and IV (in maturation) follicles and liver, with emphasis on the modulation of the different vitellogenin isoforms. In males, key signals regulating spermatogenesis were investigated. Results demonstrated that in fish exposed to the combination of BPA and probiotic, most of the transcripts were closer to C or P levels, supporting the hypothesis of SLAb51 to antagonize BPA toxicity. This study represents the first evidence related to the use of SLAb51 to improve reproduction and open new fields of investigation regarding its use to reduce endocrine disrupting compound impacts on health.","Giommi, Christian; Habibi, Hamid R.; Candelma, Michela; Carnevali, Oliana; Maradonna, Francesca",Int J Mol Sci,599,1

We have recently published that emergency professionals display increased salivary levels of α-amylase and dehydroepiandrosterone during the working day. The pattern of these markers may suggest a counteracting mechanism of dehydroepiandrosterone against the stress reflected by amylase increases. In order to verify this hypothesis, we have analysed different psychological aspects in the same group of healthcare professionals through different tests related to behaviours resulting from stress. These include the state-trait anxiety inventory, the self-efficacy test and the sleeping quality questionnaire. The tests were provided at the beginning of the working day and collected at the end. STAI scores (trait and state) were indicative of no anxiety. Self-efficacy scores were considered optimal, as well as those from the sleeping quality questionnaire. This is supported by the modest correlation between STAI scores and salivary levels of α-amylase and dehydroepiandrosterone. In conclusion, the emergency professionals of the studied hospitals seem to have adequate work management. Altogether it means that the stress generated during work performance is controlled, allowing a correct adaptation to the demanding situations undergone in emergency departments.","Pérez-Valdecantos, Daniel; Caballero-García, Alberto; del Castillo-Sanz, Teodosia; Bello, Hugo J.; Roche, Enrique; Roche, Alba; Córdova, Alfredo",Int J Environ Res Public Health,599,1

Our study aims to analyze whether minimally invasive valve surgery (MIVS) can reduce the incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications compared to the full median sternotomy (FS) approach. METHODS: We reviewed the records of 1076 patients who underwent isolated mitral or aortic valve surgery (80 MIVS and 996 FS) in our institution between January 2015 and December 2019. Propensity score-matching analysis was used to compare outcomes between the groups and to reduce selection bias. RESULTS: Propensity score matching revealed no significant difference in hospital mortality between the groups. The incidence of PPCs was significantly less in the MIVS group than in the FS group (19% vs. 69%, respectively; P < 0.0001). The most common PPCs were atelectasis (P = 0.034), pleural effusions (P = 0.042), and pulmonary infection (P = 0.001). Prolonged mechanical ventilation time (> 24 h) (P = 0.016), blood transfusion amount (P = 0.006), length of hospital stay (P < 0.0001), and ICU stay (P < 0.0001) were significantly less in the MIVS group. Cardiopulmonary bypass (CBP), aortic cross-clamping, and operative time intervals were significantly longer in the MIVS group than in the matched FS group (P < 0.001). A multivariable analysis revealed a decreased risk of PPCs in patients undergoing MIVS (odds ratio, 0.25; 95% confidence interval, 0.006–0.180; P < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: MIVS for isolated valve surgery reduces the risk of PPCs compared with the FS approach.","Mohamed, Mohamed Abdulkadir; Cheng, Cai; Wei, Xiang",J Cardiothorac Surg,599,1

Despite the potential correlation of these outcomes, they are typically analysed separately, potentially leading to misinformation and inefficient estimates due to partial assessment of safety data. Using joint modelling, we investigated whether clinical AEs vary by treatment and how laboratory outcomes (alanine amino-transferase, total bilirubin) and concomitant medication are associated with clinical AEs over time following artemisinin-based antimalarial therapy. METHODS: We used data from a trial of artemisinin-based treatments for malaria during pregnancy that randomized 870 women to receive artemether–lumefantrine (AL), amodiaquine–artesunate (ASAQ) and dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine (DHAPQ). We fitted a joint model containing four sub-models from four outcomes: longitudinal sub-model for alanine aminotransferase, longitudinal sub-model for total bilirubin, Poisson sub-model for concomitant medication and Poisson sub-model for clinical AEs. Since the clinical AEs was our primary outcome, the longitudinal sub-models and concomitant medication sub-model were linked to the clinical AEs sub-model via current value and random effects association structures respectively. We fitted a conventional Poisson model for clinical AEs to assess if the effect of treatment on clinical AEs (i.e. incidence rate ratio (IRR)) estimates differed between the conventional Poisson and the joint models, where AL was reference treatment. RESULTS: Out of the 870 women, 564 (65%) experienced at least one AE. Using joint model, AEs were associated with the concomitant medication (log IRR 1.7487; 95% CI: 1.5471, 1.9503; p < 0.001) but not the total bilirubin (log IRR: -0.0288; 95% CI: − 0.5045, 0.4469; p = 0.906) and alanine aminotransferase (log IRR: 0.1153; 95% CI: − 0.0889, 0.3194; p = 0.269). The Poisson model underestimated the effects of treatment on AE incidence such that log IRR for ASAQ was 0.2118 (95% CI: 0.0082, 0.4154; p = 0.041) for joint model compared to 0.1838 (95% CI: 0.0574, 0.3102; p = 0.004) for Poisson model. CONCLUSION: We demonstrated that although the AEs did not vary across the treatments, the joint model yielded efficient AE incidence estimates compared to the Poisson model. The joint model showed a positive relationship between the AEs and concomitant medication but not with laboratory outcomes.

Bioprocess conditions namely temperature, pH, agitation and duration were comparatively modeled using statistical and artificial neural network (ANN) methods to predict and optimize product yield using the matrix of a central composite rotatable design (CCRD). Response surface methodology (RSM) was the statistical approach while a feed-forward neural network, trained with Levenberg–Marquardt back-propagation algorithm, was the neural network method. Glycolipopeptide model was predicted by a significant (P < 0.001, R(2) of 0.9923) quadratic function of the RSM with a mean squared error (MSE) of 3.6661. The neural network model, on the other hand, returned an R(2) value of 0.9964 with an MSE of 1.7844. From all error metrics considered, ANN glycolipopeptide model significantly (P < 0.01) outperformed RSM counterpart in predictive modeling capability. Optimization of factor levels for maximum glycolipopeptide concentration produced bioprocess conditions of 32 °C for temperature, 7.6 for pH, agitation speed of 130 rpm and a fermentation time of 66 h, at a combined desirability function of 0.872. The glycosylated lipid-tailed peptide demonstrated significant anti-bacterial activity (MIC = 8.125 µg/mL) against Proteus vulgaris, dose-dependent anti-biofilm activities against Escherichia coli (83%) and Candida dubliniensis (90%) in 24 h and an equally dose-dependent cytotoxic activity against human breast (MCF-7: IC50 = 65.12 µg/mL) and cervical (HeLa: IC50 = 16.44 µg/mL) cancer cell lines.

This is particularly true since the outbreak of the global COVID-19 pandemic. Many countries have long adopted a best practice code for the stewardship role of institutional investors and asset managers, but Germany has so far refused to follow that trend. This paper explores the reasons for this reluctance, as well as whether the adoption of a Stewardship Code would still make sense in the regulatory framework of Germany today. Despite the increased presence of shareholder engagement (and even activism), several reasons may be put forward for why lawmakers have refused to adopt a stewardship code. This paper argues that the main political reason for this reluctance lies in the limited geographical reach of such a code, which would primarily be restricted to the (limited) domestic fund industry and would thus be unable to prescribe any meaningful principles to foreign-based asset managers. Still, I argue that the adoption of a code in the German context may make sense, for example to define expectations and to clarify the obligations of investee companies. Most importantly, it would benefit domestic investors that are typically ‘home biased’ and thereby frequently disproportionately invested in domestic funds.","Ringe, Wolf-Georg",Eur Bus Org Law Rev,599,1

The mechanisms that ensure the survival of commensals during inflammation and maintain the stability of the core component of the normal gut microbiota in such conditions remain poorly understood. We propose a new in vitro approach to study the mechanisms of resistance to immune response factors based on high-throughput sequencing followed by transcriptome analysis. This approach allowed us to detect differentially expressed genes associated with inflammation. In this study, we demonstrated that the presence of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNFα to the growth medium of the B. longum subsp. longum GT15 strain changes the latter’s growth rate insignificantly while affecting the expression of certain genes. We identified these genes and performed a COG and a KEGG pathway enrichment analysis. Using phylogenetic profiling we predicted the operons of genes whose expression was triggered by the cytokines TNFα and IL-6 in vitro. By mapping the transcription start points, we experimentally validated the predicted operons. Thus, in this study, we predicted the genes involved in a putative signaling pathway underlying the mechanisms of resistance to inflammatory factors in bifidobacteria. Since bifidobacteria are a major component of the human intestinal microbiota exhibiting pronounced anti-inflammatory properties, this study is of great practical and scientific relevance.","Veselovsky, Vladimir A.; Dyachkova, Marina S.; Menyaylo, Egor A.; Polyaeva, Polina S.; Olekhnovich, Evgenii I.; Shitikov, Egor A.; Bespiatykh, Dmitry A.; Semashko, Tatiana A.; Kasianov, Artem S.; Ilina, Elena N.; Danilenko, Valeriy N.; Klimina, Ksenia M.",Front Immunol,599,1

METHODS/RESULTS: Online surveys were used for data collection, received from 5479 individuals from the general population, sleep disorder patients, and COVID-involved (medical doctors (MDs) and nurses) and COVID-affected professionals (teachers, psychologists, and dentists). SQ and AQ were worse in adults, females, and high-education subjects. Feeling worse, having economic problems, depression, anxiety, irritability, and a high Calamity Experience Check List (CECL) score during COVID were significantly associated with poor SQ and AQ. Shorter sleep duration, increased latency, poor nutrition, low physical activity, increased mobile and social network use, more negative and less positive attitudes and behaviors were associated with poor AQ. CONCLUSIONS: The SQ logistic regression showed gender, morbidities, CECL, and awakenings as relevant, whereas, for AQ, relevant variables further included age and physical activity. Aiming to have a high stress compliance, each individual should sleep well, have important control of their mood, practice positive behaviors while dismissing negative behaviors and attitudes, practice exercise, have adequate nutrition, and beware of technologies and dependences.","Paiva, Teresa; Reis, Cátia; Feliciano, Amélia; Canas-Simião, Hugo; Machado, Maria Augusta; Gaspar, Tânia; Tomé, Gina; Branquinho, Cátia; Silva, Maria Raquel; Ramiro, Lúcia; Gaspar, Susana; Bentes, Carla; Sampaio, Francisco; Pinho, Lara; Pereira, Conceição; Carreiro, Alexandra; Moreira, Susana; Luzeiro, Isabel; Pimentel, Joana; Videira, Gabriela; Fonseca, Júlio; Bernarda, Ana; Vaz Castro, Joana; Rebocho, Sofia; Almondes, Katie; Canhão, Helena; Matos, Margarida Gaspar",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),599,1

We derive the three free parameters for both models in several cases and test them against the amount of data needed to bring accuracy in predictions. The SHR model is (Formula presented.) accurate about 20 days past the second inflexion point in the daily curve of cases, while the SIR model reaches a similar accuracy a fortnight before. All the analyzed cases assert the utility of SHR and SIR approximants as a valuable tool to forecast the disease’s evolution.

Here we explore data collected early in the pandemic to examine what factors might drive this relation. We focus on political affiliation. Given the functional account of boredom as a call to action, we hypothesized that this urge to act may drive individuals towards outlets replete with symbolic value (e.g., ideology, identity). In addition, given the politicization of some social distancing rules (e.g., mask wearing), we explored whether those who adhere to strong political ideologies-particularly conservative ideologies-would be more likely to rule-break. Moderation analyses indicated that boredom proneness and social (but not fiscal) conservatism were indeed predictive of rule-breaking. These results highlight the need for both clear messaging emphasizing the strength of communal identity and action (i.e., that ""We are all in this together"") and for interventions that emphasize shared collective values in contexts that appeal directly to social conservatives.","Brosowsky, Nicholaus P; Van Tilburg, Wijnand; Scholer, Abigail A; Boylan, James; Seli, Paul; Danckert, James",Motiv Emot,599,16

Thromboelastography (TEG) has been suggested as a tool for identifying patients at increased risk of VTE. This study aims to determine if serial TEG evaluation predicts the development of VTE in patients with COVID-19 and respiratory failure admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study of patients admitted to the ICU with COVID-19 and respiratory failure without a prior diagnosis of acute VTE. Patients underwent TEG on days 1, 4, and 6 of ICU admission. The number of hypercoagulable days, defined as elevated TEG maximum amplitude, were recorded. The outcome was time from ICU admission to VTE during the hospital admission. Patients were censored at death and discharge. A Cox proportional hazards model was fit for time to first VTE controlling for patient age, sex, and exposure to antiplatelet agents. RESULTS: A total of 56 patients were enrolled in the study (11 females/45 males);41.1% had a hypercoagulable TEG (MA above the upper limit of normal) on ICU day 1, 55.4% on day 4, and 48.2% on day 6. The primary outcome of VTE occurred in 17 patients (30.4%). The median time from ICU admission to VTE was 7 days (IQR 3-12). Of the 14 patients with hypercoagulable MA on all 3 measured days, 1 patient (7.1%) developed a VTE compared to 15.4% of those with hypercoagulable MA for 2 days (N=13), 30.8% of those hypercoagulable for 1 day (N=13), and 62.5% of patients not hypercoagulable any of the 3 days (N=16). Multivariable Cox-proportional hazards model found that increasing number of hypercoagulable days by MA was associated with a decreased risk of VTE (OR 0.48, CI 0.27-0.85, p=0.01). A Cox proportional hazards regression curve for the number of hypercoagulable days by MA holding all other covariates at their medians is shown in Figure 1. CONCLUSION: In this study, more hypercoagulable days on TEG MA measurement was counterintuitively associated with a decreased risk of VTE in patients with COVID-19 respiratory failure. The normal response to inflammation and infection is upregulation of pro-coagulant acute phase reactants suggesting that increased TEG MA may be physiologic. TEG MA measures below the upper limit of normal are associated with an increased risk of VTE and may mark the development of a consumptive coagulopathy.","Marvi, T.; Stubblefield, W.; Tillman, B.; Self, W.; Rice, T.

Once an immunological complication like cytokine storm occurs, anti-viral based monotherapy alone is not enough. Additional anti-inflammatory treatment is recommended. It must be noted that anti-inflammatory drugs such as JAK inhibitors, IL-6 inhibitors, TNF-&#945; inhibitors, colchicine, etc., have been either suggested or are under trials for managing cytokine storm in COVID-19 infections. Natural astaxanthin (ASX) has a clinically proven safety profile and has antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory properties. There is evidence from preclinical studies that supports its preventive actions against ALI/ARDS. Moreover, ASX has a potent PPARs activity. Therefore, it is plausible to speculate that ASX could be considered as a potential adjunctive supplement. Here, we summarize the mounting evidence where ASX is shown to exert protective effect by regulating the expression of pro-inflammatory factors IL-1ß, IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-&#945;. We present reports where ASX is shown to prevent against oxidative damage and attenuate exacerbation of the inflammatory responses by regulating signaling pathways like NF-Ä¸B, NLRP3 and JAK/STAT. These evidences provide a rationale for considering natural astaxanthin as a therapeutic agent against inflammatory cytokine storm and associated risks in COVID-19 infection and this suggestion requires further validation with clinical studies.","Talukdar, Jayanta; Bhadra, Bhaskar; Dattaroy, Tomal; Nagle, Vinod; Dasgupta, Santanu",Biomed Pharmacother,599,22

GSE122960) were analyzed to isolate and specifically study gene expression in alveolar type II cells. Colocalization of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and TMPRSS2 enables severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV 2) to enter the cells. Expression levels of these genes in the alveolar type II cells of elderly and young patients were comparable and, therefore, do not seem to be responsible for worse outcomes observed in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) affected elderly. In cells from the elderly, 263 genes were downregulated and 95 upregulated. Superoxide dismutase 3 (SOD3) was identified as the top-ranked gene that was most downregulated in the elderly. Other redox-active genes that were also downregulated in cells from the elderly included activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) and metallothionein 2A (M2TA). ATF4 is an endoplasmic reticulum stress sensor that defends lungs via induction of heme oxygenase 1. The study of downstream factors known to be induced by ATF4, according to Ingenuity Pathway Analysis&#8482;, identified 24 candidates. Twenty-one of these were significantly downregulated in the cells from the elderly. These downregulated candidates were subjected to enrichment using the Reactome Database identifying that in the elderly, the ability to respond to heme deficiency and the ATF4-dependent ability to respond to endoplasmic reticulum stress is significantly compromised. SOD3-based therapeutic strategies have provided beneficial results in treating lung disorders including fibrosis. The findings of this study propose the hypotheses that lung-specific delivery of SOD3/ATF4-related antioxidants will work in synergy with promising antiviral drugs such as remdesivir to further improve COVID-19 outcomes in the elderly.","Abouhashem, Ahmed S; Singh, Kanhaiya; Azzazy, Hassan M E; Sen, Chandan K",Antioxid Redox Signal,599,24

Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that leads to neuronal death. Chromosome-wide changes in gene expression have been reported in HD, not only in the brain but also in peripheral blood cells, but whether this translates into nuclear and chromosome architecture alterations has not yet been studied. METHODS: We investigate nuclear structure and chromosome organization in HD blood cells using fluorescence in situ hybridization in ultrathin cryosections (cryoFISH), coupled with machine learning image analysis to evaluate size, distribution, and morphology of nuclei and chromosomes. Four chromosomes were analyzed based on up- or downregulation of gene expression in HD. RESULTS: We show that blood cells from HD patients display increased nuclear size and filamentary shape, increased size of gene-rich chromosome 19, decreased filamentary shape of gene-rich chromosome 22, and a more radially centralized position for chromosome 19, whereas chromosomes 4 and 5 do not show detectable differences. CONCLUSIONS: We identify gross changes in nuclear architecture and chromosome organization associated with HD in blood. This adds a new layer of information onto disrupting mechanisms in HD and increases the potential of using blood to survey HD.","de Castro, Inês J; Toner, Brian; Xie, Sheila Q; Swingland, James; Hodges, Angela; Tabrizi, Sarah J; Turkheimer, Federico; Pombo, Ana; Khalil, André",Neurol. sci,599,16

In this manuscript we show that the RT-LAMP reaction has a sensitivity of only 200 RNA virus copies, with a color change from pink to yellow occurring in 100% of the 62 clinical samples tested positive by RT-qPCR. We also demonstrated that this reaction is 100% specific for SARS-CoV-2 after testing 57 clinical samples infected with dozens of different respiratory viruses and 74 individuals without any viral infection. Although the majority of manuscripts recently published using this technique describe only the presence of two-color states (pink = negative and yellow = positive), we verified by naked-eye and absorbance measurements that there is an evident third color cluster (orange), in general related to positive samples with low viral loads, but which cannot be defined as positive or negative by the naked eye. Orange colors should be repeated or tested by RT-qPCR to avoid a false diagnostic. RT-LAMP is therefore very reliable for samples with a RT-qPCR Ct < 30 being as sensitive and specific as a RT-qPCR test. All reactions were performed in 30 min at 65 °C. The use of reaction time longer than 30 min is also not recommended since nonspecific amplifications may cause false positives.","Aoki, Mateus Nóbrega; de Oliveira Coelho, Bruna; Góes, Luiz Gustavo Bentim; Minoprio, Paola; Durigon, Edison Luiz; Morello, Luis Gustavo; Marchini, Fabricio Klerynton; Riediger, Irina Natassja; do Carmo Debur, Maria; Nakaya, Helder I; Blanes, Lucas",Sci Rep,599,20

OBJECTIVES: The aim of our research was to assess the performance of FRENDTM COVID-19 Ag assay (NanoEntek, South Korea) as a ultra-rapid frontline test for SARS-COV-2 identification, in comparison with RT-PCR and another COVID-19 antigen fluorescence immunoassay (FIA). STUDY DESIGN: The qualitative FIA FRENDTM test, designed to detect within 3 minutes the Nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2, was evaluated using nasopharyngeal swabs in Universal Transport Medium (UTM&#8482;, Copan Diagnostics Inc, US) from suspected COVID-19 cases who accessed the Emergency Room of the Ospedale Policlinico San Martino, Genoa, Liguria, Northwest Italy. Diagnostic accuracy was determined in comparison with SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR and STANDARD FTM COVID-19 Ag FIA test (SD BIOSENSOR Inc., Republic of Korea). RESULTS: In November 2020, 110 nasopharyngeal samples were collected consecutively; 60 resulted RT-PCR positive. With respect to RT-PCR results, sensitivity and specificity of FRENDTM COVID-19 Ag test were 93.3% (95% CI: 83.8-98.2) and 100% (95% CI: 92.9-100), respectively. FRENDTM and STANDARD FTM COVID-19 Ag FIA assays showed a concordance of 96.4% (Cohen's k = 0.93, 95% CI: 0.86-0.99). CONCLUSIONS: FRENDTM FIA test showed high sensitivity and specificity in nasopharyngeal swabs. The assay has the potential to become an important tool for an ultra-rapid identification of SARS-COV-2 infection, particularly in situations with limited access to molecular diagnostics.","Orsi, Andrea; Pennati, Beatrice Marina; Bruzzone, Bianca; Ricucci, Valentina; Ferone, Diego; Barbera, Paolo; Arboscello, Eleonora; Dentone, Chiara; Icardi, Giancarlo",J Virol Methods,599,12

However, other manifestations such as headache, abdominal pain, diarrhea, loss of taste and smell were added to the clinical spectrum, during the course of the COVID‐19 pandemic. The reports on the neurological findings are increasing rapidly and headache seems to be the leader on the symptom list. Headache was reported in 11%‐34% of the hospitalized COVID‐19 patients, but clinical features of these headaches were totally missing in available publications. According to our initial experience, significant features of headache presentation in the symptomatic COVID‐19 patients were new‐onset, moderate‐severe, bilateral headache with pulsating or pressing quality in the temporoparietal, forehead or periorbital region. The most striking features of the headache were sudden to gradual onset and poor response to common analgesics, or high relapse rate, that was limited to the active phase of the COVID‐19. Symptomatic COVID‐19 patients, around 6%‐10%, also reported headache as a presenting symptom. The possible pathophysiological mechanisms of headache include activation of peripheral trigeminal nerve endings by the SARS‐CoV‐2 directly or through the vasculopathy and/or increased circulating pro‐inflammatory cytokines and hypoxia. We concluded that as a common non‐respiratory symptom of COVID‐19, headache should not be overlooked, and its characteristics should be recorded with scrutiny.","Bolay, Hayrunnisa; Gül, Ahmet; Baykan, Betül",Headache,599,1

We aim to characterize airway microbiome (mycobiome, bacteriome) and functional genes in asthmatics and controls. METHODS: Sputum microbiome of controls, untreated asthma patients and inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) receiving patients was detected using high throughput sequencing. Metagenomic sequencing was used to examine the functional genes of microbiome. RESULTS: 1. Mycobiome: α diversity was lower in untreated asthma group than that in controls. Mycobiome compositions differed among the three groups. Compared with controls, untreated asthma group has higher abundance of Wallemia, Mortierella and Fusarium. Compared with untreated asthma patients, ICS receiving patients has higher abundance of Fusarium and Mortierella, lower frequency of Wallemia, Alternaria and Aspergillus. 2. Bacteriome: α diversity was lower in untreated asthma group than that in controls. There are some overlaps of bacteriome compositions between controls and untreated asthma patients which were distinct from ICS receiving patients. Untreated asthma group has higher Streptococcus than controls. 3. Potential fungal and bacterial biomarkers of asthma: Trametes, Aspergillus, Streptococcus, Gemella, Neisseria, etc. 4. Correlation network: There are dense and homogenous correlations in controls but a dramatically unbalanced network in untreated asthma and ICS receiving patients, which suggested the existence of disease-specific inter-kingdom and intra-kingdom alterations. 5.
