3996,3996,3996,Content validity of the newly developed risk assessment tool for religious mass gathering events in an Indian setting (Mass Gathering Risk Assessment Tool-MGRAT),14.848911,4.890491,2019-07-11,"BACKGROUND: Risk assessment (RA) for mass gathering events is crucial to identify potential health hazards. It aids in planning and response activities specific to the event but is often overlooked by the event organizers. This paper reports the content validity process of a newly developed tool called Mass Gathering Risk Assessment Tool (MGRAT), which intends to assess the risks associated with religious mass gathering events in Indian settings. METHODS: Qualitative approach was followed to identify the risks associated with mass gathering events and to identify the domains and items to be included in the RA tool. The draft tool was shared with six experts who were selected by the convenient method; selected experts were requested to assess the tool and give their comments about the domains, items, relevant responses, and overall presentation of the tool using content validity questionnaire. Content validity index and Fleiss kappa statistics were calculated to assess the agreement between multiple raters. RESULTS: Agreement proportion expressed as scale-level content validity index (S-CVI) calculated by the averaging method is 0.92. S-CVI; calculated by universal agreement is 0.78. Fleiss kappa statistics to measure the agreement between multiple experts after adjusting the component of the chance agreement is 0.522 (95% CI: 0.417, 0.628, P value: 0.001). CONCLUSION: MGRAT is a valid tool, which has an appropriate level of content validity. As the number of raters increases, there will be difficulty in achieving consensus among all the items, which is the reason for lower Content Validity Index/Universal Average (CVI/UA) when compared with Content Validity Index/Average (CVI/Ave). Fleiss kappa statistics also indicated moderate agreement among the raters beyond the chance agreement, which also supports the appropriate content validity of MGRAT.","Sharma, Upasana; Desikachari, BR; Sarma, Sankara",J Family Med Prim Care,430,1

Efforts to recover donor lungs with reversible injuries using ex vivo perfusion systems are limited to <24 hours of support. Here, we demonstrate the feasibility of extending normothermic extracorporeal lung support to 4 days using cross-circulation with conscious swine. METHODS: A swine behavioral training program and custom enclosure were developed to enable multiday cross-circulation between extracorporeal lungs and recipient swine. Lungs were ventilated and perfused in a normothermic chamber for 4 days. Longitudinal analyses of extracorporeal lungs (ie, functional assessments, multiscale imaging, cytokine quantification, and cellular assays) and recipient swine (eg, vital signs and blood and tissue analyses) were performed. RESULTS: Throughout 4 days of normothermic support, extracorporeal lung function was maintained (arterial oxygen tension/inspired oxygen fraction >400 mm Hg; compliance >20 mL/cm H(2)O), and recipient swine were hemodynamically stable (lactate <3 mmol/L; pH, 7.42 ± 0.05). Radiography revealed well-aerated lower lobes and consolidation in upper lobes of extracorporeal lungs, and bronchoscopy showed healthy airways without edema or secretions. In bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, interleukin (IL) 4, IL-6, and IL-10 levels increased less than 6-fold, whereas interferon gamma, IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-1ra, IL-2, IL-8, IL-12, IL-18, and tumor necrosis factor alpha levels decreased from baseline to day 4. Histologic evaluations confirmed an intact blood–gas barrier and outstanding preservation of airway and alveolar architecture. Cellular viability and metabolism in extracorporeal lungs were confirmed after 4 days. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate feasibility of normothermic maintenance of extracorporeal lungs for 4 days by cross-circulation with conscious swine. Cross-circulation approaches could support the recovery of damaged lungs and enable organ bioengineering to improve transplant outcomes.","Hozain, Ahmed E.; Tipograf, Yuliya; Pinezich, Meghan R.; Cunningham, Katherine M.; Donocoff, Rachel; Queen, Dawn; Fung, Kenmond; Marboe, Charles C.; Guenthart, Brandon A.; O'Neill, John D.; Vunjak-Novakovic, Gordana; Bacchetta, Matthew",J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg,430,1

Based upon our current understanding of this rather complex disease, the knowledge that is currently being generated in the basic science of stone disease offers the promise of minimizing patient suffering. But the technology and information are expanding at incomprehensible rates. METHODS: This is a history of technology and information systems themselves. This history is absolutely fascinating and deserves a spot in the lexicon of the history of urolithiasis because it is the future of management of this ancient malady and best hope for the future. A review of the errors of complex systems and the application to medicine and surgery centers on the notion of six sigma (six standard deviations from the norm). This is a statistical reference to improving outcomes. RESULTS: This chapter jumps to the history of modern electronics, computers, the rise of the Internet, and artificial intelligence and how it might be applied to urolithiasis. By necessity, complex systems in turn tend to focus on the complications and unintended consequences of the technology. Therefore, some attention will be paid to complications, medical malpractice, and the notion of human error. CONCLUSIONS: This concluding chapter brings us up-to-date in the technologies that will evolve and modify our current perceptions of stone disease. This includes the surgical and medical methods that will evolve in conjunction with the technologies that will drive all of the future of medicine, intelligent technology. The notion of convergence will be developed and presented and why such luminaries as Bill Joy have become so pessimistic about the future.","Moran, Michael E.",Urolithiasis,430,1

The aims of this study were to identify GAS isolates and to determine emm typing, the coverage rate of available vaccines, and the distribution of superantigen gene profiles. 15 GAS isolates were isolated from throat cultures of 200 patients with tonsillopharyngitis, who were admitted to Canakkale Health Application and Research Hospital between October 2017 and May 2018. Identification of the isolates was performed by conventional methods and 16S rRNA sequence analysis. emm typing and exotoxin profiling of the isolates were performed by polymerase chain reaction. 7.5% GAS was detected in 200 patients. All the GAS isolates were identified as S. pyogenes. emm typing can be carried out in 13 S. pyogenes isolates. emm89 (33.3%), emm44 (20%), emm6 (13.3%), emm84 (6.7%), emm1 (6.7%), and emm18.1 (6.7%) were found to be six emm types. The coverage rate of S. pyogenes strains for 26-valent vaccine was 61.5% and for the 30-valent vaccine 84.6%.

To investigate the effect of dengue and Zika cocirculation on the spread of both pathogens, we create a deterministic dengue and Zika coinfection model, the first to incorporate altered infectivity of mosquitoes (due to coinfection). The model also addresses increased infectivity due to antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) within the human population. Central to our analysis is the derivation and interpretation of the basic reproductive number and invasion reproductive number of both pathogens. In addition, we investigate how model parameters impact the persistence of each disease. Our results identify threshold conditions under which one disease facilitates the spread of the other and show that ADE has a greater impact on disease persistence than altered vector infectivity. This work highlights the importance of ADE and illustrates that while the endemic presence of dengue facilitates the spread of Zika, it is possible for high Zika prevalence to prevent the establishment of dengue.","Olawoyin, Omomayowa; Kribs, Christopher",Bull Math Biol,430,1

ER-degradation enhancing α-mannosidase-like (EDEM1) was proposed to extract terminally misfolded proteins from the calnexin folding cycle and target them for degradation by ERAD. Here, using mass-spectrometry and biochemical methods, we show that EDEM1 is found in auto-regulatory complexes with ERAD components. Moreover, the N-terminal disordered region of EDEM1 mediates protein–protein interaction with misfolded proteins, whilst the absence of this domain significantly impairs their degradation. We also determined that overexpression of EDEM1 can induce degradation, even when proteasomal activity is severely impaired, by promoting the formation of aggregates, which can be further degraded by autophagy. Therefore, we propose that EDEM1 maintains ER homeostasis and mediates ERAD client degradation via autophagy when either dislocation or proteasomal degradation are impaired.","Chiritoiu, Marioara; Chiritoiu, Gabriela N.; Munteanu, Cristian V.

11818,11818,11818,Global governance for COVID-19 vaccines,15.300472,5.0808005,2020-06-18,"BACKGROUND: In 2009, a novel influenza vaccine was distributed worldwide to combat the H1N1 influenza “swine flu” pandemic. However, antibodies induced by the vaccine display differences in their specificity and cross-reactivity dependent on pre-existing immunity. Here, we present a computational model that can capture the effect of pre-existing immunity on influenza vaccine responses. The model predicts the region of the virus hemagglutinin (HA) protein targeted by antibodies after vaccination as well as the level of cross-reactivity induced by the vaccine. We tested our model by simulating a scenario similar to the 2009 pandemic vaccine and compared the results to antibody binding data obtained from human subjects vaccinated with the monovalent 2009 H1N1 influenza vaccine. RESULTS: We found that both specificity and cross-reactivity of the antibodies induced by the 2009 H1N1 influenza HA protein were affected by the viral strain the individual was originally exposed. Specifically, the level of antigenic relatedness between the original exposure HA antigen and the 2009 HA protein affected antigenic-site immunodominance. Moreover, antibody cross-reactivity was increased when the individual’s pre-existing immunity was specific to an HA protein antigenically distinct from the 2009 pandemic strain. Comparison of simulation data with antibody binding data from human serum samples demonstrated qualitative and quantitative similarities between the model and real-life immune responses to the 2009 vaccine. CONCLUSION: We provide a novel method to evaluate expected outcomes in antibody specificity and cross-reactivity after influenza vaccination in individuals with different influenza HA antigen exposure histories. The model produced similar outcomes as what has been previously reported in humans after receiving the 2009 influenza pandemic vaccine. Our results suggest that differences in cross-reactivity after influenza vaccination should be expected in individuals with different exposure histories.","Anderson, Christopher S.; Sangster, Mark Y.; Yang, Hongmei; Mariani, Thomas J.; Chaudhury, Sidhartha; Topham, David J.",BMC Bioinformatics,430,16

This study was an examination of genetics knowledge before and after culturally and linguistically appropriate pre-test genetic counseling in a diverse deaf adult sample. Individuals ≥18 years old with early-onset sensorineural deafness were offered connexin-26/30 testing and genetic counseling. Participants completed questionnaires containing 10 genetics knowledge items at baseline and following pre-test genetic counseling. The effects of genetic counseling, prior beliefs about etiology, and participant’s preferred language on genetics knowledge scores were assessed (n = 244). Pre-test genetic counseling (p = .0007), language (p < .0001), prior beliefs (p < .0001), and the interaction between counseling and beliefs (p = .035) were predictors of genetics knowledge. American Sign Language (ASL)-users and participants with “non-genetic/unknown” prior beliefs had lower knowledge scores than English-users and participants with “genetic” prior beliefs, respectively. Genetics knowledge improved after genetic counseling regardless of participants’ language; knowledge change was greater for the “non-genetic/unknown” beliefs group than the “genetic” beliefs group. ASL-users’ lower knowledge scores are consistent with evidence that ethnic and cultural minority groups have less genetics knowledge, perhaps from exposure and access disparities. Culturally and linguistically appropriate pre-test genetic counseling significantly improved deaf individuals’ genetics knowledge. Assessing deaf individuals’ prior beliefs is important for enhancing genetics knowledge.","Baldwin, Erin E.; Boudreault, Patrick; Fox, Michelle; Sinsheimer, Janet S.; Palmer, Christina G.

Participants in rural areas sourced more energy from wild and cultivated foods; consumed a wider diversity of foods; were more likely to meet WHO recommendations of >400 g of non-starchy fruits and vegetables daily; were more physically active; and had significantly lower body fat, waist circumference, and body mass index (BMI) when compared to urban populations. Urban populations were found to have a reduced ability to self-cultivate agri-food products or collect wild foods, and therefore consumed more ultra-processed foods (classified as NOVA 4) and takeout foods, and overall had less diverse diets compared to rural populations. Clear opportunities to leverage traditional knowledge and improve the cultivation and consumption of underutilized species can assist in building more sustainable and resilient food systems while ensuring that indigenous knowledge and cultural preferences are respected.","Vogliano, Chris; Raneri, Jessica E.; Maelaua, Josephine; Coad, Jane; Wham, Carol; Burlingame, Barbara",Nutrients,430,1

The present study aimed to investigate the effects of sorafenib on the proliferation, autophagy and apoptosis of HepG2 cells under hypoxia. Briefly, reverse transcription-quantitative PCR and western blotting was performed to quantify HIF-1, LC3II/I, mTOR and p70s6K expression levels. Cell proliferation was determined using the Cell Counting Kit-8 assay and the cell apoptosis rate was evaluated using flow cytometry. The results demonstrated that autophagy and apoptosis were induced by hypoxia, and that sorafenib further enhanced hypoxia-induced autophagy and apoptosis in HepG2 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, the mechanism of sorafenib-mediated autophagy in liver cancer cell were investigated by using chloroquine (CQ). The results showed that CQ significantly inhibited autophagy by decreasing LC3II/LC3I ratio in HepG2 cells treated with sorafenib and/or hypoxia. By contrast, sorafenib could increase the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) and of the autophagy marker (LC3II/I) and decrease the expression of mammalian target of rapamycin and p70 ribosomal S6 kinase in HepG2 cells under normoxia and hypoxia conditions, suggesting that sorafenib could induce hypoxia and autophagy in liver cancer cells. In addition, sorafenib was demonstrated to prevent proliferation and induce apoptosis of HepG2 cells under normoxia and hypoxia. Sorafenib could also prevent the malignant behavior of HepG2 by inducing hypoxia and autophagy. In summary, the findings from the present study suggested that sorafenib may inhibit liver cancer progression by activating autophagy and HIF-1 signaling pathway.","Yang, Qingzhuang; Gao, Lianghui; Huang, Xiaolong; Weng, Jie; Chen, Youke; Lin, Shibu; Yin, Qiushi",Exp Ther Med,430,5

Previous research analyzing the effect of retirement on PA levels has shown mixed results, and few studies investigated this issue in a gender perspective, thus, highlighting a need of knowledge in this respect. Aims of this study focused on the experience of PA during the retirement transition were to understand typologies of PA and possible changes in these typologies, to identify behavioural types relative to PA practice and levels, and to distinguish the main drivers and barriers for practicing PA associated with the different behavioural types. A further goal of the study was to investigate the abovementioned aims considering differences between women and men. Analyses were carried out within a three-year qualitative longitudinal study (2014-2016), which explored the individual experience of PA during the transition from work to retirement of 24 women and 16 men in Italy, with interviews carried out one year before and one and two years after retirement. Results show that preferred PA for both women and men was walking, along the transition to retirement. Over time, several participants replaced physically demanding activities with lighter ones. Six behavioural types were identified, describing individuals who incremented, started, or maintained the same level of PA, people who decreased PA levels or stopped it, and individuals who had a fluctuant behavior towards PA, or who had never practiced it. In general, poor health represented the main barrier to PA. For men, the main driver to PA was its effects on body shape, while for women, socialization/networking. In order to stimulate a more effective promotion of PA during the retirement transition, policy implications were discussed in light of the results obtained.","Socci, Marco; Santini, Sara; Dury, Sarah; Perek-Białas, Jolanta; D'Amen, Barbara; Principi, Andrea",Biomed Res Int,430,4

An approach, called frequent fault-tolerant pattern (FT-pattern) mining, is more suitable for extracting interesting information from real-world data that may be polluted by noise. Previous research on frequent fault-tolerant pattern mining has been widely studied. However, all of the researches focus on static database. In this paper, we propose an efficient framework to analyze the frequent FT-patterns mining in dynamic database. To avoid re-scanning the whole database, beside of keeping the fault-tolerance pattern, we will also keep the potential fault-tolerance pattern that has higher possibility of becoming a fault-tolerance pattern. The experimental results show that by re-using the existing pattern that had been generated, the proposed algorithms are highly efficient in terms of execution time and maximum memory usage for mining fault-tolerance frequent pattern in dynamic database compare to FFM algorithm.","Ester, Delvi; lee, Guanling",New Information and Communication Technologies for Knowledge Management in Organizations,430,1

At about the same time, Scadding4 in the United Kingdom proposed the term fibrosing alveolitis, suggesting (incorrectly) that DIP and UIP were early and late phases of a single disorder.5 There has subsequently been much discussion and controversy over what patterns should be included in such a classification system, in terms of both histology and what these patterns represent regarding clinical disease. As a result, some patterns have now been categorized according to their recognized causes; for example, GIP has been reclassified as a pneumoconiosis, the cause being exposure to cobalt during the production of hard metals or during diamond polishing (see Chapter 26).6,7","Nicholson, Andrew G.",Dail and Hammar&#x02019;s Pulmonary Pathology,430,17

Since there is no “one-fits-all” cloud service provider, companies face the challenge of selecting and combining services from different vendors to meet all their requirements. Therefore, this paper calls for the design of a cloud brokering framework that would enable faster and easier selection of cloud services by recommending appropriate services through a matchmaking system. Drawing on previously conducted studies and considering current issues and practical experiences both from provider and user perspectives, we propose a framework that would identify, rank and recommend cloud services from multiple modules and components to individual consumers. Furthermore, we contribute an early-stage design of a cloud broker framework that considers cloud-service consumers’ sourcing preferences while making new cloud-sourcing decisions and that can be used in the selection and adoption phase of implementing cloud services and/or as part of a multicloud strategy.","Hentschel, Raoul; Strahringer, Susanne","Responsible Design, Implementation and Use of Information and Communication Technology",430,1

About fifty percent of today's pharmaceutical drugs are derived from natural origin. Interest in natural products as a source of new drugs is growing due to many factors that will be discussed in this article. Viruses have been resistant to therapy or prophylaxis longer than any other form of life. Currently, there are only few drugs available for the cure of viral diseases including acyclovir which is modeled on a natural product parent. In order to combat viruses which have devastating effects on humans, animals, insects, crop plants, fungi and bacteria, many research efforts have been devoted for the discovery of new antiviral natural products. Recent analysis of the number and sources of antiviral agents reported mainly in the annual reports of medicinal chemistry from 1984 to 1995 indicated that seven out of ten synthetic agents approved by FDA between 1983-1994, are modeled on a natural product parent. It has been estimated that only 5-15% of the approximately 250,000 species of higher plants have been systematically investigated for the presence of bioactive compounds while the potential of the marine environment has barely been tapped. The aim of this review is to provide an overview on the central role of natural products in the discovery and development of new antiviral drugs by displaying 340 structures of plant, marine and microbial origin that show promising in vitro antiviral activity.","El Sayed, Khalid A.",,430,1

By now, these limitations have been addressed individually: to improve performance under a strict power constraint, power capping, which sets power limits to components/nodes/jobs, is an indispensable feature; and for memory bandwidth/capacity increase, the industry has begun to support hybrid main memory designs that comprise multiple different technologies including emerging memories (e.g., 3D stacked DRAM or Non-Volatile RAM) in one compute node. However, few works look at the combination of both trends. This paper explicitly targets power managements on hybrid memory based HPC systems and is based on the following observation: in spite of the system software’s efforts to optimize data allocations on such a system, the effective memory bandwidth can decrease considerably when we scale the problem size of applications. As a result, the performance bottleneck component changes in accordance with the footprint (or data) size, which then also changes the optimal power cap settings in a node. Motivated by this observation, we propose a power management concept called [Image: see text] and a profile-driven software framework to realize it. Our experimental result on a real system using HPC benchmarks shows that our approach is successful in correctly setting power caps depending on the footprint size while keeping around 93/96% of performance/power-efficiency compared to the best settings.","Arima, Eishi; Hanawa, Toshihiro; Trinitis, Carsten; Schulz, Martin",High Performance Computing,430,22

In fact, most popular Big Data frameworks such as Hadoop and Spark are implemented in Java or using other languages designed to run on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) such as Scala. However, modern computing hardware is increasingly complex, featuring multiple processing cores aggregated into one or more CPUs that are usually organized as a Non-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA) architecture. The platform-independent features of the JVM come at the cost of hardware abstraction, which makes it more difficult for Big Data developers to take advantage of hardware-aware optimizations based on managing CPU or NUMA affinities. In this paper we introduce jhwloc, a Java library for easily managing such affinities in JVM-based applications and gathering information about the underlying hardware topology. To demonstrate the functionality and benefits of our proposal, we have extended Flame-MR, our Java-based MapReduce framework, to provide support for setting CPU affinities through jhwloc. The experimental evaluation using representative Big Data workloads has shown that performance can be improved by up to 17% when efficiently exploiting the hardware. jhwloc is publicly available to download at https://github.com/rreye/jhwloc.","Expósito, Roberto R.; Veiga, Jorge; Touriño, Juan",Computational Science - ICCS 2020,430,1

However, keeping up the details or records of students’ progress is a difficult task. We therefore propose a support for instructors to evaluate the performance of their students. In particular, a prototype tool is designed and developed in order to facilitate the evaluation of activities based on an active learning class. The tool also encompasses the web service for a function of face feature recognition. Two scenarios of active learning classrooms are created in order to evaluate the prototype tool. We also plan to create a larger number of scenarios which involve different class objectives. The results show that the tool can detect and determine students with high precision values.

All drugs in use for treating plague are registered based on experimental data and anecdotal evidence, and no regimen currently recommended is supported by a randomized clinical trial. The IMASOY trial intends to fill this knowledge gap by comparing two 10-day regimens included in the national guidelines in Madagascar. The primary objective of the trial is to test the hypothesis that ciprofloxacin monotherapy is non-inferior to streptomycin followed by ciprofloxacin for the treatment of bubonic plague, thus avoiding the need for injectable, potentially toxic, aminoglycosides. METHODS: A two-arm parallel-group randomized control trial will be conducted across peripheral health centres in Madagascar in five districts. Males and non-pregnant females of all ages with suspected bubonic or pneumonic plague will be recruited over the course of three plague ‘seasons’. The primary endpoint of the trial is to assess the proportion of patients with bubonic plague who have a therapeutic response to treatment (defined as alive, resolution of fever, 25% reduction in the size of measurable buboes, has not received an alternative treatment and no clinical decision to continue antibiotics) as assessed on day 11. DISCUSSION: If successful, the trial has the potential to inform the standard of care guidelines not just in Madagascar but in other countries afflicted by plague. The trial is currently ongoing and expected to complete recruitment in 2022. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04110340.

The logic of POZE underpins five books that appear at Palgrave/Springer in 2020/21. It is based on the understanding that human existence results from four dimensions, soul, heart, mind, and body, which find their expression in aspirations, emotions, thoughts, and sensations. Through their four-dimensionality individuals are symmetrical to the four dimensions that shape the society, which they are part of. Individuals are the micro entity of a four-dimensional collective reality that encompasses communities and institutions in the meso-dimension, and countries and economies in the macro-dimension. Altogether micro, meso and macro are integral parts of the meta dimension, Planet Earth; the latter also includes non-anthropocentric aspects such as Nature. POZE provides insights about the multiple dynamics that shape our individual and collective experience. Moreover, it provides practical guidance to optimize the interplay between them. As a result of this understanding, it posits that change is possible. Moving towards a fair inclusive world, characterized by a life of quality for everyone 1) is at reach; 2) is achievable; 3) involves everyone as both a right-holder and duty-bearer; and 4) is to the benefit of everyone. POZE has four meanings: it i) translates as ‘inner peace’ from Haitian Creole, country where the dynamic began in 2017; ii) is an acronym that encompasses the four core concepts of the paradigm (Purpose, Om, Zoom, Expression); iii) is a representation of the four outcomes of the logic (Perspective, Optimization, Zenith, Exposure); finally it iv) stands for an exercise to nurture inner peace daily (Pause, Observe, Zoom in, Experience). These will be explored further in the article.","Walther, Cornelia C.",Int,430,16

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the time investment required by professionals to implement a psychosocial dementia care program to manage neuropsychiatric symptoms. METHODS: A prospective observational study design was used. The program consisted of 1) a one-day training course, 2) three interdisciplinary discussion meetings in five months, and 3) a web-based tool for the continued assessment of neuropsychiatric symptoms. Care professionals implemented the intervention in in-home (19 in-home care management agencies and 14 multiple in-home service providers) and residential care settings (19 group homes and eight nursing homes) in Japan from October 2019 to February 2020. The level of neuropsychiatric symptoms for the participants was evaluated using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI: 0–144). The time investment was reported by participating professionals. A total of 125 persons with dementia were included at baseline. RESULTS: Neuropsychiatric symptoms were significantly decreased at the final follow-up in all types of providers (Cohen’s d(rm) = 0.44–0.61). The mean (SD) time required for the five-month implementation was 417.9 (219.8) minutes. There was a mean (SD) decrease of 8.6 (14.0) points in the total NPI score among the 103 persons with completed interventions. The time investment was significantly lower in in-home care management agencies than in group homes, and lower in follow-ups than at baseline assessment. CONCLUSION: The program implementation may incur a substantial time investment regardless of setting. An additional benefit scheme to reward the time investment would be helpful to encourage implementation until the follow-ups.","Nakanishi, Miharu; Niimura, Junko; Ziylan, Canan; Bakker, Ton TJEM; Granvik, Eva; Nägga, Katarina; Shindo, Yumi; Nishida, Atsushi",,430,1

With the COVID-19 pandemic, the importance of social support has been highlighted in media reports because of its well-known beneficial effects on overall well-being. However, as adults age, social networks, contacts, and activities naturally decrease. These age-related losses are often difficult, if not impossible, to replace. Pets have recently been recognized as a valuable source of social support for many older adults, providing both physical and psychological benefits through mutual connection and behavioral activation. Previous studies have examined how human social support or pet social support enhance older adults’ well-being (i.e., positive emotions, engagement, relationships, accomplishment, and meaning). However, there is a gap in our scientific knowledge as previous research has not evaluated if pet social support can serve as a protective factor in the absence of adequate human social support. Current analyses, with 141 older adult participants, suggests that pet owners with a positive attachment to their pet experience higher well-being as pets serve as a coping resource that protects against common life stressors. Similar to human social support, pet social support appears to be a protective factor that also promotes and fosters a sense of well-being in older adults. Support in late life is especially important for families and agencies to be attuned to, especially during a global pandemic.","Sobering, Juliet; Brown, Lisa",Innov Aging,430,0

BACKGROUND: One of the most common and serious respiratory complications associated with acute stroke is HAP. Respiratory care is among the fundamentals of patient care, and thus competency in this field is expected as part of nursing training. However, there is a paucity of literature detailing RNs’ experiences with respiratory care in relation to HAP, specifically among patients with acute stroke, in the context of stroke units. As such, there is a need to expand the knowledge base relating to respiratory care focusing on HAP, to assist with evidence-based nursing. DESIGN: A qualitative descriptive study. METHOD: Eleven RNs working in four different acute stroke units in Southern Sweden participated in the current study. The data were collected through semi-structured interviews, and the transcribed interviews were analysed using inductive content analysis. RESULTS: Three overarching categories were identified: (1), awareness of risk assessments and risk factors for HAP (2) targeting HAP through multiple nursing care actions, and (3) challenges in providing respiratory care to patients in risk of HAP. These reflected the similarities and differences in the experiences that RNs had with providing respiratory care in relation to HAP among in-patients with acute stroke. CONCLUSIONS: The findings from this study suggest that the RNs experience organisational challenges in providing respiratory care for HAP among patients with acute stroke. Respiratory care plays a vital role in the identification and prevention of HAP, but our findings imply that RNs’ knowledge needs to be improved, the fundamentals of nursing care need to be prioritised, and evidence-based guidelines must be implemented. RNs would also benefit from further education and support, in order to lead point-of-care nursing in multidisciplinary stroke teams.","Borglin, Gunilla; Eriksson, Miia; Rosén, Madeleine; Axelsson, Malin",BMC Nurs,430,1

Both manufacturing and services sectors in the economies of Asia have outsourced supplies from different countries in order to gain a competitive advantage through effective value chain management. The motivations for this outsourcing are to achieve technological innovations, reduce end-product prices, and strengthen strategic competitiveness. This paper applies a supply chain approach to develop the concept of a hazard-resilient healthcare system (HRHS) and to explore ways how this might be achieved. After reviewing the current international thinking on HRHS, which has narrowly focused on building national capacities with national capabilities, it argues that a supply chain approach may provide a better, more robust, and in many ways more realistic, approach to enhance the hazard resilience of national healthcare systems. Within such an approach, capabilities of the local actors (local health authorities and healthcare providers) in a pandemic or disaster-prone situation remain important and should be further strengthened, but international support and assistance in times of emergency should also be a key plank of the system. In a changing world with more frequent high-impact pandemics and disasters, such international support need not be one way, but both ways. A system of mutual support may be developed by forming an effective international common pool of capability in responding to the health needs when a major disaster occurs anywhere in a region or globally. Even though serious limitations exist in the current thinking on HRHS, significant progress has been made on the international humanitarian assistance front, especially in the ASEAN region. While developments on this front have not been a part of the purview of the current international thinking on HRHS, it is argued that they may well form an important corner stone in a typical future national HRHS.","Liu, Minquan; Anbumozhi, Venkatachalam",J,430,16

This chapter will argue that the levels of poverty and child poverty in the United Kingdom were alarmingly high before Covid-19 and that they have risen further as a result of the pandemic. The increase in poverty has impacted on the effectiveness of homeschooling for disadvantaged families due to a lack of resources and there has been a greater uptake at foodbanks. Catholic communities and Catholic schools have responded to this crisis situation and there are examples of enhanced support for vulnerable families.

Singapore has New Nation. Malaysia has The Tapir Times, previously known as Fake Malaysia News. Indonesia has Pos Ronda (Guard Post). All of these were created when virtually anyone with access to the Internet can publicly share content online. These satirical news websites—all, save for Pos Ronda, in English—may appear to be little more than derivative reproductions of American satirical news outfits such as The Onion. They seem to be worthy of about as much scholarly scrutiny as their American counterparts—hardly any, being mere “infotainment,” as some scholars say. However, their peculiar contexts make it difficult to trivialize them. Philippine satirists have long seemed vulnerable to prosecution under the country's defamation laws, including a recently-enacted cybercrime law. Thailand has a strict lèse majesté law and has been under martial rule twice in the past two decades. Singapore is one of the world's “authoritarian democracies.” Malaysia, sharing the colonial British legal heritage of Singapore, also has various legal restrictions on online expression. Indonesia’s Internet law makes online defamation and blasphemy a punishable offense. Yet the writers behind these websites seem to have been able to flout undemocratic laws and/or bypass the restrictions of repressive regimes without punishment. Is their largely unimpeded functionality under their respective regimes evidence that online satirical news is capable of pushing the boundaries of freedom of expression even in “illiberal” democratic states? Or are they tolerated annoyances by often anonymous authors? This chapter attempts to derive preliminary answers to these questions by determining how aware the writers are of the subversive potential of their work, first by focusing on whether the challenges to state policies in selected articles from these websites can be considered legally fair, then by examining the textual and non-textual responses of these websites to events affecting free speech within their particular contexts. The articles in these websites are considered a distinct genre, not simply a digitized form of preexisting printed satirical news—especially in an age of online “fake news”—distinguished by not being intentionally deceptive, but still similarly parodic of the news (following Pierre Macherey’s definition of parody)—a genre that, given its easily “shareable” nature and the ability of readers to participate in its world-building, is peculiar to the Web 2.0 era.","Reyes, Miguel Paolo P.",New Media Spectacles and Multimodal Creativity in a Globalised Asia,430,1

It enables government for instantaneous transmission of information to the targeted citizen, processing large scale data available through social media and can enable to take decisions based on that data in judicial way to increase transparency and accountability. For smart governance, it is required that within a limited budget government can propagate information to the maximum people. Social media analysis provides knowledge to ensure maximize the influence. Similarly for misinformation/rumour, influence can be minimized and SNA helps to identify communities and locations affected by this information. Moreover it can be used to identify those influential users who are able to spread information. This knowledge will empower Government agencies to take necessary precautionary measures such as targeted campaigning against the rumour, identified the source of information, block the source node or delayed rumour propagation. In this chapter we will study an conceptual framework for generating a governance system which will be able to identify the citizens those have maximum influence in the social network, campaigning of government policies through them for the maximum propagation to the citizen with minimum budget, detect rumour, found the source of misinformation, block the source node of rumour, detection of community, generating anti-spreading model for already propagated rumour.","Dey, Paramita; Roy, Sarbani",Smart Cities: A Data Analytics Perspective,430,12

The hypothesis of our study is that donor/recipient HLA mismatches assessed at the molecular level may also influence a higher susceptibility to the development of posttransplant primary T-cell alloimmunity. In this prospective observational study, 169 consecutive kidney transplant recipients without preformed donor-specific antibodies (DSA) and with high resolution donor/recipient HLA typing were evaluated for HLA molecular mismatch scores using different informatic algorithms [amino acid mismatch, eplet MM, and Predicted Indirectly Recognizable HLA Epitopes (PIRCHE-II)]. Primary donor-specific alloimmune activation over the first 2 years posttransplantation was assessed by means of both dnDSA and dnDST using single antigen bead (SAB) and IFN-γ ELISPOT assays, respectively. Also, the predominant alloantigen presenting pathway priming DST alloimmunity and the contribution of main alloreactive T-cell subsets were further characterized in vitro. Pretransplantation, 78/169 (46%) were DST+ whereas 91/169 (54%) DST−. At 2 years, 54/169 (32%) patients showed detectable DST responses: 23/54 (42%) dnDST and 31/54 (57%) persistently positive (persistDST+). 24/169 (14%) patients developed dnDSA. A strong correlation was observed between the three distinct molecular mismatch scores and they all accurately predicted dnDSA formation, in particular at the DQ locus. Likewise, HLA molecular incompatibility predicted the advent of dnDST, especially when assessed by PIRCHE-II score (OR 1.014 95% CI 1.001–1.03, p=0.04). While pretransplant DST predicted the development of posttransplant BPAR (OR 5.18, 95% CI=1.64–16.34, p=0.005) and particularly T cell mediated rejection (OR 5.33, 95% CI=1.45–19.66, p=0.012), patients developing dnDST were at significantly higher risk of subsequent dnDSA formation (HR 2.64, 95% CI=1.08–6.45, p=0.03). In vitro experiments showed that unlike preformed DST that is predominantly primed by CD8+ direct pathway T cells, posttransplant DST may also be activated by the indirect pathway of alloantigen presentation, and predominantly driven by CD4+ alloreactive T cells in an important proportion of patients. De novo donor-specific cellular alloreactivity seems to precede subsequent humoral alloimmune activation and is influenced by a poor donor/recipient HLA molecular matching.","Meneghini, Maria; Crespo, Elena; Niemann, Matthias; Torija, Alba; Lloberas, Nuria; Pernin, Vincent; Fontova, Pere; Melilli, Edoardo; Favà, Alexandre; Montero, Nuria; Manonelles, Anna; Cruzado, Josep Maria; Palou, Eduard; Martorell, Jaume; Grinyó, Josep Maria; Bestard, Oriol",Front Immunol,430,1

Data analysis method based on machine learning is an important, active, and multi-disciplinarily research field. Support vector machine (SVM) is one of the most powerful and fast classification models. The main challenges SVM faces are the selection of feature subset and the setting of kernel parameters. To improve the performance of SVM, a metaheuristic algorithm is used to optimize them simultaneously. This paper first proposes a novel classification model called IBMO-SVM, which hybridizes an improved barnacle mating optimizer (IBMO) with SVM. Three strategies, including Gaussian mutation, logistic model, and refraction-learning, are used to improve the performance of BMO from different perspectives. Through 23 classical benchmark functions, the impact of control parameters and the effectiveness of introduced strategies are analyzed. The convergence accuracy and stability are the main gains, and exploration and exploitation phases are more properly balanced. We apply IBMO-SVM to 20 real-world datasets, including 4 extremely high-dimensional datasets. Experimental results are compared with 6 state-of-the-art methods in the literature. The final statistical results show that the proposed IBMO-SVM achieves a better performance than the standard BMO-SVM and other compared methods, especially on high-dimensional datasets. In addition, the proposed model also shows significant superiority compared with 4 other classifiers.","Jia, Heming; Sun, Kangjian",Pattern Anal Appl,430,33

We have chosen India as a prototype for the analysis of morbidity and mortality rates to learn about the principles and practices for achieving minimum causality under the most complex practical scenario. The State of Goa where 5 cases / 100,000 with no death reported as of May 25, 2020, 8:21 A.M. At the time of the data analysis, India was on 62nd day of lockdown. Based on the data available at this time, here we present an inverse correlation of decreased morbidity and mortality rate with increased social distancing, stay‐home program / shelter‐in program administered by Indian authorities. It is intriguing that a population of approximately 1.3 billion people, reporting a minimum morbidity and mortality rate (M&M rate) could be an exceptional example of coordination of incredibly diverse cultural and complex administrative fabric. In all, our hypothesis is that it is the herd immunity conferred the protection for an en masse from the current pandemic event. Based on the lessons learned from this current SARS‐CoV‐2, here we present a “Cogent Transmission Model” (CTM) in which community living confer and/or reinforce herd immunity induced protection from the future pandemic of infectious diseases caused by antibiotic resistance bacterial pathogens (ARBP). The success in sustaining a minimum M&M rate could be due in part by the social support system which is a significant element for the development of hardiness to prevent the spread of infectious diseases. The success of the current lockdown is a reflection of the social support system which is intertwined with perceptions of personal control enabling the coping process. Such a level of hardiness is also referred to as “Internal Locus of Control” (ILC). It is our observation that a pattern of consistency on the confidence level of each and every member of the community having considerable control over the events in overcoming the illness and combating the diseases is truly flabbergasting. Such a level of resilience draws a corollary of the hardy personality as identified in the “Personal Hardiness” (J. Pers and Soci. Psych 37, 1–11: 1979). Traits such as a. sense of commitment to self, b. control over their life at the individual level and c. view and make adjustments as challenges arise rather than viewing it as a source of stress. Taken together we suggest that commitment to self, control of self in dynamic social environmental circumstances and readjustment to challenges separate the people with “Personal Hardiness” from the rest of the society as a remarkable trait to overcome the fear of the unknown in a pandemic event (FASEB Journal 2019 33:1_supplement, 483.16‐483.16). It would be a dream come true, should the principles of “Personal Hardiness” disseminated across the globe at all socioeconomic levels in every nook and corner at the earliest possible time, it would definitely vanquish the plausible pandemic of infectious diseases at its blossom.","Jauregui, Lizette; Moreno, Bernice; Nunez, Hector; Kannan, Subburaj",FASEB J,430,1

Overarching themes were that summaries were understandable, had appropriate level of detail, and added value to the ICU experience. CONCLUSIONS: In this pilot study, family members had positive impressions of receiving daily written summaries of care. Further study is needed to determine the extent to which written communication may affect family and patient outcomes.","Bulger, Jeffrey L.; Quinn, Thomas V.; Glover, Crystal M.; Basapur, Santosh; Shah, Raj C.; Greenberg, Jared A.",Crit Care Explor,430,1

Most of these peptides are cationic-amphipathic, exhibiting two main mechanisms of action, direct lysis and by modulating the immunity. The most commonly reported activity of AMPs is their anti-bacterial effects, although other effects, such as anti-fungal, anti-viral, and anti-parasitic, as well as anti-tumor mechanisms of action have also been described. Their anti-parasitic effect against leishmaniasis has been studied. Leishmaniasis is a neglected tropical disease. Currently among parasitic diseases, it is the second most threating illness after malaria. Clinical treatments, mainly antimonial derivatives, are related to drug resistance and some undesirable effects. Therefore, the development of new therapeutic agents has become a priority, and AMPs constitute a promising alternative. In this work, we describe the principal families of AMPs (melittin, cecropin, cathelicidin, defensin, magainin, temporin, dermaseptin, eumenitin, and histatin) exhibiting a potential anti-leishmanial activity, as well as their effectiveness against other microorganisms.","El-Dirany, Rima; Shahrour, Hawraa; Dirany, Zeinab; Abdel-Sater, Fadi; Gonzalez-Gaitano, Gustavo; Brandenburg, Klaus; Martinez de Tejada, Guillermo; Nguewa, Paul A.",Biomolecules,430,1

We estimate that the foreclosure discount is considerable, and this would suggest a high degree of market segmentation and limited spillovers from foreclosures to the market for non-foreclosed homes. However, by exploiting the exogeneity of the market entry of foreclosures, we find that new foreclosures increase home sellers’ propensity to adjust their list price. Moreover, following the methodology in Campbell et al. (Am Econ Rev 101(5):2108–2131, 2011), we show that foreclosure listings have a significant negative impact on the prices of non-foreclosed nearby homes. Our evidence is quantitatively consistent with the recent literature on the impact of foreclosures on the US housing market.","Loberto, Michele",Ital Econ J,430,1

However, the adoption and use of the EHR is influenced by several factors, including users' perception. OBJECTIVES To undertake a systematic review of the literature to understand healthcare professionals' perceptions about the adoption and use of EHRs in Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries in order to influence the implementation strategies, training programme and policy development in the GCC region. METHOD A systematic literature search was undertaken on seven online databases to identify articles published between January 2006 and December 2017 examining healthcare professionals' perception towards the adoption and use of EHR in the Gulf context. RESULTS The fourteen articles included in this review identified both positive and negative perceptions of the role of EHR in healthcare. The positive perceptions included EHR benefits, such as improvements to work efficiency, quality of care, communication and access to patient data. Conversely, the negative perceptions were associated with challenges or risks of adopting an EHR, such as disruption of provider-patient communication, privacy and security concerns and high initial costs. The perceptions were influenced by personal factors (eg, age, occupation and computer literacy) and system factors (perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use). CONCLUSION Positive perceptions of EHRs by the healthcare professionals could facilitate the adoption of this technology in the Gulf region, particularly when barriers are addressed early. Negative perceptions may inform change management strategies during adoption and implementation. The perceptions should be further evaluated from a technology acceptance perspective.","Alanazi, Bander; Butler-Henderson, Kerryn; Alanazi, Mohammed",BMJ health & care informatics,430,17

We aimed to examine the extent of trainees' involvement in and comfort with telemedicine practices in Canada with the use of a web-based self-administered survey. Eighty-six trainees from 12 training programs completed the survey (65% response rate). Results showed that before COVID-19, 39 trainees (45%) had telemedicine exposure, compared with 67 (78%) after COVID-19 (P < 0.001). However, only 44 trainees (51%) reported being comfortable or very comfortable with the use of telemedicine. Of the 67 trainees who were involved in telemedicine, 4 (6%) had full supervision during virtual visits, 13 (19%) had partial supervision, and 50 (75%) had minimal or no supervision. Importantly, 67 trainees (78%) expressed the need for telemedicine-specific training and 64 (74%) were willing to have their virtual visits recorded for the purpose of evaluation and feedback. Furthermore, 47 (55%) felt strongly or very strongly positive about incorporating telemedicine into their future practice. The main perceived barriers to telemedicine use were concerns about patients' engagement, fear of weakening the patient-physician relationship, and unfamiliarity with telemedicine technology. These barriers, together with training in virtual physical examination skills and medicolegal aspects of telemedicine, are addressed in several established internal medicine telemedicine curricula that could be adapted by cardiology programs. In conclusion, while the degree of telemedicine involvement since COVID-19 was high, the trainees' comfort level with telemedicine practice remains suboptimal likely due to lack of training and inadequate staff supervision. Therefore, a cardiology telemedicine curriculum is needed to ensure that trainees are equipped to embrace telemedicine in cardiovascular clinical care.","Almufleh, Aws; Lee, Christopher; Tsang, Michael Yc; Gin, Kenneth; Tsang, Teresa S M; Nair, Parvathy",The Canadian journal of cardiology,430,1

To date, commercial metallic guidewires were considered contraindicated during CMR fluoroscopy due to concerns over radiofrequency (RF)-induced heating. The inability to use metallic guidewires hampers catheter navigation in patients with challenging anatomy. Here we use low specific absorption rate (SAR) imaging from gradient echo spiral acquisitions and a commercial nitinol guidewire for CMR fluoroscopy right heart catheterization in patients. METHODS The low-SAR imaging protocol used a reduced flip angle gradient echo acquisition (10° vs 45°) and a longer repetition time (TR) spiral readout (10 ms vs 2.98 ms). Temperature was measured in vitro in the ASTM 2182 gel phantom and post-mortem animal experiments to ensure freedom from heating with the selected guidewire (150 cm × 0.035″ angled-tip nitinol Terumo Glidewire). Seven patients underwent CMR fluoroscopy catheterization. Time to enter each chamber (superior vena cava, main pulmonary artery, and each branch pulmonary artery) was recorded and device visibility and confidence in catheter and guidewire position were scored on a Likert-type scale. RESULTS Negligible heating (< 0.07°C) was observed under all in vitro conditions using this guidewire and imaging approach. In patients, chamber entry was successful in 100% of attempts with a guidewire compared to 94% without a guidewire, with failures to reach the branch pulmonary arteries. Time-to-enter each chamber was similar (p=NS) for the two approaches. The guidewire imparted useful catheter shaft conspicuity and enabled interactive modification of catheter shaft stiffness, however, the guidewire tip visibility was poor. CONCLUSIONS Under specific conditions, trained operators can apply low-SAR imaging and using a specific fully-insulated metallic nitinol guidewire (150 cm × 0.035"" Terumo Glidewire) to augment clinical CMR fluoroscopy right heart catheterization.

ANIMALS 5 healthy adult horses. PROCEDURES A crossover study was conducted. Radiopaque contrast medium (12 mL) was administered orally and via nasopharyngeal catheter to each horse. Pharyngeal and laryngeal distribution of contrast medium was determined by examination of radiographs obtained immediately after administration of contrast medium, compared with those obtained before administration. Regional distribution of contrast medium was graded. Endoscopic examination of the nasopharynx, laryngopharynx, and larynx was performed to confirm radiographic results. RESULTS Examination of radiographs obtained after nasopharyngeal administration revealed contrast medium in the nasopharynx (n = 5), oropharynx (2), laryngopharynx (3), and larynx (5) of the 5 horses. Examination of radiographs obtained after oral administration revealed contrast medium in the oropharynx (n = 4) and larynx (1) of the 5 horses. Endoscopic examination confirmed radiographic findings and was found to be sensitive for detection of contrast medium in the laryngopharynx, whereby detection rates were higher for both administration methods. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Results suggested that medication administered by use of a nasopharyngeal catheter will result in topical distribution within the nasopharynx, including the dorsal surface of the soft palate, and larynx, although distribution should be evaluated in horses with clinical airway disease to confirm these findings. Oral administration did not result in consistently detectable topical laryngeal distribution but could be used for selected conditions (eg, palatitis).","Colbath, Aimée C; Valdés-Martínez, Alejandro; Leise, Britta S; Hackett, Eileen S",American journal of veterinary research,430,31

However, clinical uptake of esophageal manometry in ICU is still low. Thus, the purpose of review is to describe technical tips to adequately measure esophageal pressure at the bedside, and then update the most important clinical applications of esophageal manometry in ICU. RECENT FINDINGS Each esophageal balloon has its own nonstressed volume and it should be calibrated properly to measure pleural pressure accurately: transpulmonary pressure calculated on absolute esophageal pressure reflects values in the lung regions adjacent to the esophageal balloon (i.e. dependent to middle lung). Inspiratory transpulmonary pressure calculated from airway plateau pressure and the chest wall to respiratory system elastance ratio reasonably reflects lung stress in the nondependent 'baby' lung, at highest risk of hyperinflation. Also esophageal pressure can be used to detect and minimize patient self-inflicted lung injury. SUMMARY Esophageal manometry is not a complicated technique. There is a large potential to improve clinical outcome in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome, acting as an early detector of risk of lung injury from mechanical ventilation and vigorous spontaneous effort.","Yoshida, Takeshi; Brochard, Laurent",Current opinion in critical care,430,1

The resources are unevenly spread and, in order to be able to meet a potentially increased demand, we have estimated the future need for thrombectomy. METHODS The new treatment recommendations are similar to those that have been in use at the Karolinska University Hospital since 2007. Using our local thrombectomy data (2009-2011), we calculated the proportion of thrombectomies performed at our hospital by level of stroke severity according to the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score (0-5, 6-11, 12-19, and 20-35). We then estimated the total number of potential thrombectomies expected in Sweden by extrapolating our treatment proportions to the rest of Sweden through the use of data from the Swedish National Stroke Registry. RESULTS The number of potential thrombectomies would have been more than five times higher (1268 estimated compared with 232 actually reported in the National Stroke Registry) if the new recommendations for thrombectomy in acute ischemic stroke had been implemented in 2013 (the year from which we had the most recent available data from the Swedish Stroke Registry). CONCLUSIONS When the new recommendations are implemented broadly, there may be a substantial increase in demand for thrombectomies. Our study highlights the need for policymakers and healthcare professionals to prepare for the increasing demands for advanced endovascular stroke treatment.","Kuntze Söderqvist, Åsa; Andersson, Tommy; Ahmed, Niaz; Wahlgren, Nils; Kaijser, Magnus",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,430,1

To gain insight into the regulatory mechanisms involved in encapsulation of a foreign object, and subsequent differentiation of encapsulating cells, the present study used microarray technology and real-time RT-PCR to identify the temporal changes in gene expression associated with tissue development. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that 3-7 days post-implantation of foreign objects (cubes of boiled egg white) into rats, they were encapsulated by tissue comprised primarily of haemopoietic (CD45(+)) cells, mainly macrophages (CD68(+), CCR1(+)). By day 14, tissue capsule cells no longer expressed CD68, but were positive for myofibroblast markers alpha-smooth muscle (SM) actin and SM22. In accordance with these results, gene expression data showed that early capsule (days 3-7) development was dominated by the expression of monocyte/macrophage-specific genes (CD14, CSF-1, CSF-1R, MCP-1) and pro-inflammatory mediators such as transforming growth factor (TGF-beta). As tissue capsule development progressed (days 14-21), myofibroblast-associated and pro-fibrotic genes (associated with TGF-beta and Wnt/beta-catenin signalling pathways, including Wnt 4, TGFbetaRII, connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), SMADs-1, -2, -4 and collagen-1 subunits) were significantly up-regulated. The up-regulation of genes associated with Cardiovascular and Skeletal and Muscular System Development at later time-points suggests the capacity of cells within the tissue capsule for further differentiation to smooth muscle, and possibly other cell types. The identification of key regulatory pathways and molecules associated with the fibrotic response to implanted materials has important applications not only for optimising tissue engineering strategies, but also to control deleterious fibrotic responses.","Le, S J; Gongora, M; Zhang, B; Grimmond, S; Campbell, G R; Campbell, J H; Rolfe, B E",Differentiation; research in biological diversity,430,1

This research focuses on computer-aided analysis based on deep learning of phonocardiogram (PCG) signals that can enable improved and timely detection of heart abnormalities. The two widely used publicly available PCG datasets are from the PhysioNet/CinC (2016) and PASCAL (2011) challenges. The datasets are significantly different in terms of the tools used for data acquisition, clinical protocols, digital storages and signal qualities, making it challenging to process and analyze. APPROACH In this work, we have used short-time Fourier transform (STFT) based spectrograms to learn the representative patterns of the normal and abnormal PCG signals. Spectrograms generated from both the datasets are utilized to perform four different studies: (i) train, validate and test different variants of convolutional neural network (CNN) models with PhysioNet dataset, (ii) train, validate and test the best performing CNN structure on PASCAL dataset as well as, (iii) on the combined PhysioNet-PASCAL dataset and (iv) finally, transfer learning technique is employed to train the best performing pre-trained network from the first study with PASCAL dataset. MAIN RESULTS The first study achieves an accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision and F1 score of 95.75%, 96.3%, 94.1%, 97.52% , and 96.93% respectively while the second study shows accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision and F1 score of 75.25%, 74.2%, 76.4%, 76.73%, and 75.42% respectively.

Chromogranin A protein expression was assessed in 538 endoscopically or surgically resected rectal NETs and compared with clinicopathologic factors to identify its clinical and prognostic significance. All of the rectal NETs analyzed (100%) were synaptophysin positive, but chromogranin A labeling was only detected in 111 cases (20.6%). Chromogranin A expression in the rectal NETs was more commonly associated with older age (50 y and older; P=0.013), male sex (P=0.002), radical resection (P=0.003), large tumor size (≥1 cm; P=0.038), muscularis propria invasion (P=0.002), lymphovascular (P=0.014) and perineural (P<0.001) invasion, an involved resection margin (P=0.028), and lymph node metastasis (P=0.003). Patients with chromogranin A expression had higher plasma chromogranin A levels (P=0.023) than those without chromogranin A expression during follow-up. The 10-year disease-free survival rate in rectal NET patients with chromogranin A expression (91.5%) was significantly shorter than the negative cases (99.7%) by both univariate (hazard ratio=14.438; 95% confidence interval: 2.911-71.598; P<0.001) and multivariate (hazard ratio=12.099; 95% confidence interval, 2.044-71.608; P=0.006) analyses. In summary, rectal NETs that are positive for chromogranin A are less common than those with synaptophysin expression and show more aggressive clinical behavior. Chromogranin A is therefore a prognostic indicator of higher recurrence risk in patients with endoscopically or surgically resected rectal NETs.","Kim, Jisup; Kim, Joo Young; Oh, Eun Hye; Yoo, Changhoon; Park, In Ja; Yang, Dong-Hoon; Ryoo, Baek-Yeol; Ryu, Jin-Sook; Hong, Seung-Mo",The American journal of surgical pathology,430,1

The pathogen has been identified as a novel enveloped RNA beta-coronavirus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The virus SARS-CoV-2 is associated with a disease characterized by severe atypical pneumonia known as coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19). Typical symptoms of this disease include cough, fever, malaise, shortness of breath, gastrointestinal symptoms, anosmia, and, in severe cases, pneumonia.1 The high-risk group of COVID-19 patients includes people over the age of 60 years as well as people with existing cardiovascular disease and/or diabetes mellitus. Epidemiological investigations have suggested that the outbreak was associated with a live animal market in Wuhan. Within the first few months of the outbreak, cases were growing exponentially all over the world. The unabated spread of this deadly and highly infectious virus is a health emergency for all nations in the world and has led to the World Health Organization (WHO) declaring a pandemic on March 11, 2020. In this report, we consolidate and review the available clinically and preclinically relevant results emanating from in vitro animal models and clinical studies of drugs approved for emergency use as a treatment for COVID-19, including remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine, and lopinavir-ritonavir combinations. These compounds have been frequently touted as top candidates to treat COVID-19, but recent clinical reports suggest mixed outcomes on their efficacies within the current clinical protocol frameworks.","Maciorowski, Dawid; Idrissi, Samir Z El; Gupta, Yash; Medernach, Brian J; Burns, Michael B; Becker, Daniel P; Durvasula, Ravi; Kempaiah, Prakasha",SLAS discovery : advancing life sciences R & D,430,1

Intraoperative measures aiming to prevent this is not standardised. AIM Presentation of experience with active suction of the prevesical space in managing postoperative urine leakage. MATERIAL AND METHODS At the Department of Urology, where laparoscopy of the upper abdomen and open RP were performed, a protocol for extraperitoneal LRP was established in 8/2008. Until 5/2011, 154 LRPs have been performed. Urine leakage from a suction drain appeared in 9 cases (5.8%). Permanent active suction (with a machine for Büllae thoracic drainage) of the prevesical space with negative pressure of 7-12 cm of H2O was started immediately. RESULTS Urine leakage started after a mean of 0.9 (0-2) days postoperatively and stopped after a mean of 8.1 (15-42) days. Leakage stopped with only suctioning in 7 cases. In one case, open re-anastomosis was performed on the 7(th) postoperative day (POD). In another case, ineffective active suction was replaced on the 10(th) POD by needle vented suction without effect and the leakage stopped following gradual shortening of the drain up to the 15(th) POD. CONCLUSIONS Active suction of the prevesical space seems to be an effective intervention to stop postoperative urine leakage after laparoscopic radical prostatectomy.","Hora, Milan; Stránský, Petr; Klečka, Jiří; Trávníček, Ivan; Urge, Tomáš; Eret, Viktor; Ferda, Jiří; Petersson, Fredrik; Hes, Ondřej",Wideochirurgia i inne techniki maloinwazyjne = Videosurgery and other miniinvasive techniques,430,24

Herein, a valid ratiometric fluorescence strategy using g-C3N4 nanosheets coupled with Eu3+ is designed for the assay of TC. In this strategy, both Eu3+ and g-C3N4 nanosheets serve as the recognition units of TC. The blue fluorescence of g-C3N4 nanosheets can be quenched by TC via the inner filter effect (IFE); meanwhile, the red fluorescence of Eu3+ can be enhanced by TC through the antenna effect (AE). The synergistic effect of AE and IFE caused by TC makes the developed ratiometric fluorescent sensor display a wide linear range for TC from 0.25 to 80 μM with a detection limit of 6.5 nM and a significant fluorescence color evolution from blue to red. Given its simplicity, free-label, excellent selectivity, high sensitivity, and recognizable color change, point-of-care testing systems, including smartphones and test paper-based assays, are developed for the visual sensing of TC. The integration of smartphones and test paper on a ratiometric fluorescent sensor greatly reduces the detection cost and time, providing a promising method for the qualitative discernment and semi-quantitative assay of TC on-site. Moreover, the potential application of the approach is also verified by detecting TC in milk.","Han, Lei; Fan, Yu Zhu; Qing, Min; Liu, Shi Gang; Yang, Yu Zhu; Li, Nian Bing; Luo, Hong Qun",ACS applied materials & interfaces,430,1

The contribution is based on an empirical study of the needs assessment in eldercare in Sweden. The article aims to explore needs assessors' conceptions of mental illness amongst older people in relation to intertwining processes of normalisation and organisational and legal constraints. The normalisation principle (NP) proposes that individuals with a disability should have access to the same living conditions as 'others'. The NP can be described as a strategy that highlights equal rights for individuals regardless of their life situation. The main findings are that mental illness is defined by needs assessors on a spectrum of diagnoses from schizophrenia and borderline personality disorder to anxiety and depression. The successful normalisation of mental illness is linked to structural context, attitudes to older people's mental illnesses and ageing, the practise established on a unit and whether needs assessors reproduce ageism or challenge it through the NP by attempting to secure the rights of older people.","Elmersjö, Magdalena; Hansen, Emelie; Victor, Marie Louise",Health & social care in the community,430,1

The current study investigated a method to induce positive involuntary imagery in daily life, which would allow direct testing of its impact. An unselected student sample (N = 80) completed a single session of a positive imagery cognitive bias modification (CBM) paradigm, which involved listening to and imagining brief positive imagery scripts. Participants then recorded any involuntary memories of the imagined training scenarios in a three-day diary before returning to the lab for a follow-up assessment. Participants were randomised to imagine the scenarios in either an emotionally involved or emotionally detached manner, providing a test of the role of emotion in the subsequent experience of involuntary memories. Participants reported experiencing involuntary memories of the training scenarios in their daily life, but the number recorded did not differ between the experimental conditions. Exploratory analyses suggested that more vivid imagery and recall testing were associated with a greater number of involuntary memories. The study highlights the potential of the imagery CBM paradigm to further our understanding of the functions and potential importance of positive involuntary mental imagery in daily life.","Blackwell, Simon E; Dooley, Daniela; Würtz, Felix; Woud, Marcella L; Margraf, Jürgen",Memory,430,1

Since healthcare workers (HCWs) have a higher risk of acquiring and spreading MERS-CoV, we aimed to evaluate the perceived risk and anxiety level of HCWs in Saudi Arabia regarding MERS. METHODOLOGY An anonymous, self-administered questionnaire was sent online to HCWs at King Khalid University Hospital in Saudi Arabia. The total knowledge and anxiety scores were calculated. Logistic regression analyses were used to identify predictors of high anxiety scores. RESULTS Of 591 (70%) HCWs that responded, 284 (55%), 164 (32%), and 68 (13.2%) were physicians, nurses, and technicians, respectively. Physicians obtained a lower median knowledge score (6/9) compared to other professions (7/9). The mean anxiety score was similar for physicians and other HCWs (3/5); however, non-physicians expressed higher levels of anxiety toward the risk of transmitting MERS-CoV to their families, with an anxiety score of 4/5. The ability of the virus to cause severe disease or death was the most frequently reported reason for worry by physicians (89.7%) and non-physicians (87.2%). Overall, 80% of physicians and 90% of non-physicians reported improvement in adherence to hand hygiene and standard precautions while in hospital (p = 0.002). Concern over transmitting MERS-CoV to family members was the most predictive factor for anxiety among non-physician HCWs. CONCLUSION A significant proportion of HCWs expressed anxiety about the risk of acquiring MERS-CoV infection.

Their own needs during the assisted dying journey are often, however, unrecognized and underrepresented in policies and guidelines. Circumstances under which people choose assisted dying, and relational contexts such as the sociopolitical environment, may influence the experiences of family members and healthcare providers. ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS Ethics approval was not required to conduct this review. AIM This scoping review aims to identify the relational influences on the experiences of family members and healthcare providers of adults who underwent assisted dying and of those unable to access assisted dying due to the loss of capacity to consent. METHODS A literature search was conducted in four databases, including MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) and PsycINFO. The search retrieved 12,074 articles, a number narrowed down to 172 articles for full-text screening. Thirty-six articles met the established inclusion criteria. A feminist relational framework guided the data analysis. RESULTS Five key themes on the influences of family members' and healthcare providers' experiences throughout the assisted dying process were synthesized from the data. They include (1) relationships as central to beginning the process, (2) social and political influences on decision making, (3) complex roles and responsibilities of family members and healthcare providers, (4) a unique experience of death, and (5) varying experiences following death. CONCLUSION The feminist relational lens, used to guide analysis, shed light on the effect of the sociopolitical influences and the relationships among patients, families, and healthcare providers on each other's experiences. Addressing the needs of the family members and healthcare providers is vital to improving the assisted dying process. Including families' and healthcare providers' needs within institutional policies and enhancing collaboration and communication among those involved could improve the overall experience.","Variath, Caroline; Peter, Elizabeth; Cranley, Lisa; Godkin, Dianne; Just, Danielle",Nursing ethics,430,1

The specific methane yield calculated from the balance was 18% higher than the one in the batch tests, suggesting a stimulation of methane generation by co-digestion. It was hypothesized that this increase was caused by shifting the C/N ratio of raw sludge (8.8) to a more favourable ratio of the added food waste (17.7). In addition, potential benefits by adding food waste for energy autarky was investigated.

To understand how cellular conditions control capsid trafficking, we have tracked the subcellular fate of recombinant AAV2 (rAAV2) vectors using confocal immunofluorescence, three-dimensional infection analysis, and subcellular fractionation. Here we report that a population of rAAV2 virions enters the nucleus and accumulates in the nucleolus after infection, whereas empty capsids are excluded from nuclear entry. Remarkably, after subcellular fractionation, virions accumulating in nucleoli were found to retain infectivity in secondary infections. Proteasome inhibitors known to enhance transduction were found to potentiate nucleolar accumulation. In contrast, hydroxyurea, which also increases transduction, mobilized virions into the nucleoplasm, suggesting that two separate pathways influence vector delivery in the nucleus. Using a small interfering RNA (siRNA) approach, we then evaluated whether nucleolar proteins B23/nucleophosmin and nucleolin, previously shown to interact with AAV2 capsids, affect trafficking and transduction efficiency. Similar to effects observed with proteasome inhibition, siRNA-mediated knockdown of nucleophosmin potentiated nucleolar accumulation and increased transduction 5- to 15-fold. Parallel to effects from hydroxyurea, knockdown of nucleolin mobilized capsids to the nucleoplasm and increased transduction 10- to 30-fold. Moreover, affecting both pathways simultaneously using drug and siRNA combinations was synergistic and increased transduction over 50-fold. Taken together, these results support the hypothesis that rAAV2 virions enter the nucleus intact and can be sequestered in the nucleolus in stable form. Mobilization from the nucleolus to nucleoplasmic sites likely permits uncoating and subsequent gene expression or genome degradation. In summary, with these studies we have refined our understanding of AAV2 trafficking dynamics and have identified cellular parameters that mobilize virions in the nucleus and significantly influence AAV infection.","Johnson, Jarrod S; Samulski, R Jude",Journal of virology,430,31

OBJECTIVE To report our early experience with R-LESS radical nephrectomy (RN). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A retrospective review of R-LESS RN data was performed between May 2008 and November 2010. A total of 10 procedures were performed and subsequently matched to 10 conventional laparoscopic RN procedures (controls). The control group was matched with respect to patient age, body mass index (BMI), American Society of Anesthesiologists score, surgical indication, and tumor size. SURGICAL PROCEDURE R-LESS RN was performed using methods outlined in the manuscript and supplemental video material. All patients underwent R-LESS RN by a single surgeon. Single-port access was achieved via two commercially available multichannel ports, and robotic trocars were inserted either through separate fascial stabs or through the port, depending on the type used. The da Vinci S and da Vinci-Si Surgical Systems (Intuitive Surgical, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) with pediatric and standard instruments were used. MEASUREMENTS Preoperative, perioperative, pathologic, and functional outcomes data were analyzed. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS The mean patient age was 64.0 yr of age for both groups, and BMI was 29.2 kg/m(2). There was no difference between R-LESS and conventional laparoscopy cases in median operative time, estimated blood loss, visual analogue scale, or complication rate. The R-LESS group had a lower median narcotic requirement during hospital admission (25.3 morphine equivalents vs 37.5 morphine equivalents; p=0.049) and a shorter length of stay (2.5 d vs 3.0 d; p=0.03). Study limitations include the small sample size, short follow-up period, and all the inherent biases introduced by a retrospective study design. CONCLUSIONS R-LESS RN offers comparable perioperative outcomes to conventional laparoscopic RN. Prospective comparison is needed to definitively establish the position of R-LESS in minimally invasive urologic surgery.","White, Michael A; Autorino, Riccardo; Spana, Gregory; Laydner, Humberto; Hillyer, Shahab P; Khanna, Rakesh; Yang, Bo; Altunrende, Fatih; Isac, Wahib; Stein, Robert J; Haber, Georges-Pascal; Kaouk, Jihad H",European urology,430,1

Complications are usually associated with the research approach, the etiological coherence of co-occurrence, and the obscurity or absence of diagnostic criteria for mental disorders due to a general medical condition or drugs, age, etc. This review aims to investigate contemporary epidemiological data on mental and somatic comorbidity. RECENT FINDINGS The frequent co-occurrence of certain physical diseases and certain mental disorders is corroborated by contemporary epidemiological data. Cardiovascular disease, hypertension, respiratory disorders, diabetes mellitus and other metabolic disorders seem to be associated with mental disorders; the rates of occurrence, however, depend on the special characteristics of the sample. Utilization of healthcare systems and costs for patients with mental-somatic comorbidities are suggested to be higher than those for patients without comorbidities. SUMMARY Although it is generally accepted that many physical conditions have been associated with serious mental disorders, the exact nature of the relationship between them is still unclear. Various factors such as unhealthy lifestyle habits, psychotropic medication, and inadequate medical treatment or provision are implicated.

Infections caused by carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) are increasingly prevalent, but treatment options are limited. While several serine-dependent β-lactamase inhibitors are formulated with commonly prescribed β-lactams, no MBL inhibitors are currently approved for combinatorial therapies. New compounds that target MBLs to restore carbapenem activity against CPE are therefore urgently needed. Herein we identified and characterized novel synthetic peptide inhibitors that bound to and inhibited NDM-1, which is an emerging β-lactam resistance mechanism in CPE. METHODS We leveraged Surface Localized Antimicrobial displaY (SLAY) to identify and characterize peptides that inhibit NDM-1, which is a primary carbapenem resistance mechanism in CPE. Lead inhibitor sequences were chemically synthesized and MBCs and MICs were calculated in the presence/absence of carbapenems. Kinetic analysis with recombinant NDM-1 and select peptides tested direct binding and supported NDM-1 inhibitor mechanisms of action. Inhibitors were also tested for cytotoxicity. RESULTS We identified approximately 1700 sequences that potentiated carbapenem-dependent killing against NDM-1 Escherichia coli. Several also enhanced meropenem-dependent killing of other CPE. Biochemical characterization of a subset indicated the peptides penetrated the bacterial periplasm and directly bound NDM-1 to inhibit enzymatic activity. Additionally, each demonstrated minimal haemolysis and cytotoxicity against mammalian cell lines. CONCLUSIONS Our approach advances a molecular platform for antimicrobial discovery, which complements the growing need for alternative antimicrobials. We also discovered lead NDM-1 inhibitors, which serve as a starting point for further chemical optimization.","Kazi, Misha I; Perry, Blair W; Card, Daren C; Schargel, Richard D; Ali, Hana B; Obuekwe, Victor C; Sapkota, Madhab; Kang, Katie N; Pellegrino, Mark W; Greenberg, David E; Castoe, Todd A; Boll, Joseph M",The Journal of antimicrobial chemotherapy,430,1

We performed a structured interview with 50 consecutive families of children with developmental disabilities about their experience with remote learning 2 months after COVID-19 lockdown. We observed that setting up the remote learning system was challenging for families who were born outside of the United States, spoke limited English, or had a lower level of education. Though some special education supports were in place, remote learning for children with developmental disabilities led to gaps in their therapeutic services. Children with more severe developmental disabilities joined less than 2 hours of remote learning per day and had a decrease in their therapeutic services. Most children (80%) relied on their parents for education. Additionally, for low-income communities, with families who spoke languages other than English, remote learning revealed a new barrier to access: technology.","Valicenti-McDermott, Maria; O'Neil, Molly; Morales-Lara, Amy; Seijo, Rosa; Fried, Tammy; Shulman, Lisa",Journal of child neurology,430,23

This report aims to introduce the development of novel sustainable public health care systems with regard to COVID-19 in Japan: task sharing, securing staff, and task shifting. METHODS A descriptive study. The Japan Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare enlisted good practices regarding resource allocation and developing full readiness for sustainable public health care systems in September 2020. RESULTS Public health center developed systems for office support, infection control, hospital coordination, and outsourced inventory control. To reduce the workload of PHNs, a support team of three to four office workers developed a response manual for residents and a format for telephone consultations regarding COVID-19. Developing an infection control team and web-based system for hospital coordination decreased the workload of PHCs in each community to prepare for the pandemic. CONCLUSION Public health center should consider managing limited human resources and focus on providing specialized care for COVID-19 patients. Task sharing, securing staff, and task shifting are crucial strategies for developing sustainable public health care systems.","Yoshioka-Maeda, Kyoko",Public health nursing,430,1

As convalescent plasma is already used as antibody therapy, this study aimed to compare the binding capacity of antibodies specific to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 between human milk and serum from COVID-19-recovered women. Materials and Methods: The areas under the curve (AUCs) for IgA, IgM, and IgG specific to the SARS-CoV-2 RBD in human milk and serum samples were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Milk samples were collected from 12 COVID-19-recovered women, while serum samples were from 10 COVID-19-recovered women. The antibody concentrations were also determined. Results: Our study reveals that SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific antibody titers differed between human milk and serum samples from COVID-19-recovered women. When the AUCs were not divided by the antibody concentration, SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific IgA, IgM, and IgG levels were higher in the serum sample group than the human milk group (p < 0.001). However, the titers of SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific IgM (AUC/μg of IgM) and IgG (AUC/μg of IgG) were higher in human milk samples than serum samples (p < 0.05). The titer of SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific IgA (AUC/mg of IgA) was higher in the serum sample group than the human milk group (p < 0.01). Conclusions: Human milk antibodies specific to the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 must be purified to obtain comparable binding capacity observed with SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific serum antibodies.","Demers-Mathieu, Veronique; DaPra, Ciera; Medo, Elena",Breastfeeding medicine : the official journal of the Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine,430,1

Adjunctive vein of Marshall (VOM) ethanol infusion (VOM-Et) can facilitate acute MI block. However, little is known regarding its long-term success. This study sought to evaluate the impact of adjunctive VOM-Et on MI block achievement and durability compared to RFCA alone. Methods - Patients undergoing a first attempt of posterior MI ablation were grouped according to their MI block index strategy: adjunctive VOM-Et and RFCA alone. Rates of acute MI block and MI reconnection observed during repeat procedures were compared between the two groups. Results - The VOM-Et group consisted of 152 patients (63.8 ± 9.4 years) undergoing adjunctive VOM-Et for MI block. The RFCA group consisted of 110 patients (60.9 ± 9.2 years) undergoing MI ablation using RFCA alone. Acute MI block was more frequently achieved in the VOM-Et group (98.7% [150/152] vs. 63.6% [70/110]; p < 0.001) with shorter RFCA duration (5.00 [3.00-7.00] vs. 19.0 [13.6-22.0] mins; p < 0.001). Of the 220 patients with MI block achieved during the index procedure, 81 underwent a repeat procedure during follow-up (VOM-Et group: 23.3% [35/150] vs. RFCA group: 65.7% [46/70], respectively; p < 0.001). A significantly greater number of patients exhibited durable MI block in the VOM-Et group (62.9% [22/35] vs. 32.6% [15/46], respectively; p = 0.008). Conclusions - Beyond facilitating acute MI block, VOM-Et is associated with greater lesion durability as evidenced by higher rates of MI block during repeat procedures.","Nakashima, Takashi; Pambrun, Thomas; Vlachos, Konstantinos; Goujeau, Cyril; André, Clémentine; Krisai, Philipp; Ramirez, F Daniel; Kamakura, Tsukasa; Takagi, Takamitsu; Nakatani, Yosuke; Kitamura, Takeshi; Takigawa, Masateru; Roux, Jean-Rodolphe; Cheniti, Ghassen; Tixier, Romain; Chauvel, Remi; Welte, Nicolas; Duchateau, Josselin; Sacher, Frédéric; Cochet, Hubert; Hocini, Mélèze; Haïssaguerre, Michel; Jaïs, Pierre; Derval, Nicolas",Circulation.

RECENT FINDINGS Numerous molecular assays have been developed recently using a variety of technologies. Direct hybridization techniques have allowed analysis of blood culture bottles for organisms such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Target amplification methods allow postamplification analysis using a variety of technologies depending on the clinical needs for the assay. Postamplification analysis includes methods such as Sanger sequencing, pyrosequencing, reverse hybridization, and Luminex analysis, which are becoming more widely utilized. In the future, whole genome sequencing, mass spectrometry, and microarray analysis may provide a wealth of information that can be used to specifically tailor the treatment of infectious diseases. SUMMARY The implications of current trends in molecular infectious diseases are moving towards high-throughput, simple, array-type technologies that will provide a wealth of data regarding types of organisms present in a sample and the virulence factors/resistance determinants that influence the severity of disease. As a result of these developments, infectious diseases will be more accurately and effectively treated.","Muldrew, Kenneth L",Current opinion in pediatrics,430,10

From March 2004 to October 2014, RFA was performed as the initial stand-alone bridge therapy to LT for 121 patients (men/women ratio, 83:38; mean age, 60.0 years) with 156 de novo HCCs (mean size, 2.4 cm). Follow-up period from initial RFA ranged from 1.3 to 128.0 months (median, 42.9 months). We assessed the overall and tumor-specific waiting list dropout rates, post-LT tumor recurrence, and 10-year post-LT and intention-to-treat survival rates. Dropout from the waiting list due to tumor progression occurred in 7.4% of patients. HCC recurrence after LT occurred in 5.6% of patients. The post-LT overall survival (OS) rate at 5 and 10 years was 75.8% and 42.2%, respectively, and the recurrence-free survival (RFS) rate was 71.1% and 39.6%, respectively. Intention-to-treat OS, RFS, and DSS rates for the entire study population at 5 and 10 years were 63.5% and 41.2%, 60.8% and 37.7%, and 89.5% and 89.5%, respectively. CONCLUSION RFA as a first-line stand-alone bridge therapy to LT achieves excellent long-term overall and tumor-specific survivals, with a low dropout rate from tumor progression despite long wait list times and a sustained low tumor recurrence rate upon post-LT follow-up of up to 10 years.

The secondary objectives are, to determine the effect of baseline use of ACE-i/ARB on the need for mechanical ventilation, new dialysis, ICU care, and on composite of above-mentioned outcomes in the same cohort. METHODS In this retrospective study, we analyzed data using electronic medical records from all hospitalized Covid-19 African-American patients, who either died in the hospital or survived to discharge between 2 March and 22 May 2020. Patients were divided into two groups, those on ACE-i/ARB at baseline and those not on them. We used Pearson chi-square test for categorical variables, and Student's t test for continuous variables. We performed multiple logistic regression to test the primary and secondary objectives using SAS 9.4. RESULTS Out of 531 patients included in the analysis, 207 (39%) were on ACE-i/ARB at baseline. Patients in ACE-i/ARB group were older (64 vs. 57 years, P < 0.001), and had higher prevalence of hypertension (96.6 vs. 69.4%, P < 0.001) and diabetes mellitus (55.6 vs. 34.9%, P < 0.001). There was no difference in sex, BMI, other comorbidities, and presenting illness severity among the groups. After adjustment of multiple covariates, there was no difference in outcomes between the two groups including mortality, need for mechanical ventilation, new dialysis, ICU care, as well as composite outcomes.

RECENT FINDINGS Several molecular, transgenic strategies to provide safer transplant source animals with less porcine endogenous retrovirus infectivity have been developed. A genomics approach by selective breeding and porcine endogenous retrovirus loci knockout is at least theoretically possible. For other viruses, advances have been made in technologies for virus discovery and identification. SUMMARY The consequences of possible zoonoses in xenotransplantation are largely unknown. Further work to identify and control potential zoonotic agents based on recent progress will improve the safety profile of xenotransplantation.

METHODS We evaluated 20 patients with newly diagnosed TETs who had undergone concomitant 18F-FDG-PET/CT and 111In-octreotide SPECT. Thymic epithelial tumors were classified by World Health Organization (WHO) as low-risk thymomas (5), high-risk thymomas (4), and thymic carcinomas (11, among which 6 neuroendocrine tumors). Patients were staged according to Masaoka system. 18F-FDG-PET/CT was performed and SUV(max) of primary tumors was recorded. 111In-octreotide SPECT of the thorax was performed, and tumor-to-background ratio was determined on the 24-hour coronal sections. RESULTS All patients showed increased 18F-FDG uptake in mediastinal lesions. SUV(max) were significantly correlated with WHO classification (r = 0.66, P < 0.01) and with Masaoka stage (r = 0.60, P < 0.01). SUV(max) of low-risk thymomas (mean [SD], 2.87 [0.83]) were significantly lower than those of high-risk thymomas (mean [SD], 7.21 [1.73], P < 0.01) and of thymic carcinomas (mean [SD], 9.39 [5.80], P < 0.05), whereas no significant difference was found between high-risk thymomas and thymic carcinomas. SUV(max) of all high-risk thymomas and thymic carcinomas was 4.5 or greater. All primary tumors were detected by In-octreotide SPECT, and tumor-to-background ratios ranged between 1.67 and 10.10. No statistically significant correlation was found between tumor-to-background ratios and WHO classification (r = 0.24, P = 0.36) and Masaoka stages (r = 0.31, P = 0.23). However tumor-to-background ratios of thymic neuroendocrine tumors (mean [SD], 5.71 [3.09]) were significantly higher than those of all other TETs with SUV(max) of 4.5 or greater (mean [SD], 2.41 [0.56]; P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS 18F-FDG-PET/CT scan allows to differentiate high-risk epithelial tumors and thymic carcinomas from low-risk thymomas, whereas 111In-octreotide SPECT may identify neuroendocrine tumors among those showing high 18F-FDG uptake.","De Luca, Serena; Fonti, Rosa; Palmieri, Giovannella; Federico, Piera; Del Prete, Giuseppina; Pacelli, Roberto; Pace, Leonardo; De Placido, Sabino; Salvatore, Marco; Del Vecchio, Silvana",Clinical nuclear medicine,430,26

We tested whether these interventions are associated with reduced mortality. METHODS This two-by-two factorial, multicentre, randomised, clinical trial (HYPERS2S) recruited patients aged 18 years and older with septic shock who were on mechanical ventilation from 22 centres in France. Patients were randomly assigned 1:1:1:1 to four groups by a computer generated randomisation list stratified by site and presence or absence of acute respiratory distress syndrome by use of permuted blocks of random sizes. Patients received, in an open-labelled manner, mechanical ventilation either with FiO2 at 1·0 (hyperoxia) or FiO2 set to target an arterial haemoglobin oxygen saturation of 88-95% (normoxia) during the first 24 h; patients also received, in a double-blind manner, either 280 mL boluses of 3·0% (hypertonic) saline or 0·9% (isotonic) saline for fluid resuscitation during the first 72 h. The primary endpoint was mortality at day 28 after randomisation in the intention-to-treat population. This study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01722422. FINDINGS Between Nov 3, 2012, and June 13, 2014, 442 patients were recruited and assigned to a treatment group (normoxia [n=223] or hyperoxia [n=219]; isotonic [n=224] or hypertonic [n=218]). The trial was stopped prematurely for safety reasons. 28 day mortality was recorded for 434 patients; 93 (43%) of 217 patients had died in the hyperoxia group versus 77 (35%) of 217 patients in the normoxia group (hazard ratio [HR] 1·27, 95% CI 0·94-1·72; p=0·12). 89 (42%) of 214 patients had died in the hypertonic group versus 81 (37%) of 220 patients in the isotonic group (HR 1·19, 0·88-1·61; p=0·25). We found a significant difference in the overall incidence of serious adverse events between the hyperoxia (185 [85%]) and normoxia groups (165 [76%]; p=0·02), with a clinically relevant doubling in the hyperoxia group of the number of patients with intensive care unit-acquired weakness (24 [11%] vs 13 [6%]; p=0·06) and atelectasis (26 [12%] vs 13 [6%]; p=0·04) compared with the normoxia group. We found no statistical difference for serious adverse events between the two saline groups (p=0·23). INTERPRETATION In patients with septic shock, setting FiO2 to 1·0 to induce arterial hyperoxia might increase the risk of mortality. Hypertonic (3%) saline did not improve survival.

This study's goal was to examine relationships between medical school accreditation variables and ECFMG certification for a global sample. METHOD Using ECFMG databases, the authors created a 10-year cohort (January 1, 2007, to December 31, 2016) of certification applicants, defined as individuals who had attempted at least 2 examinations required for certification. Authors aggregated applicant data at the school level, excluding schools with <80 applicants. School accreditation statuses were based on agency websites. School region, age, and time of first accreditation were included. Analyses included descriptive and bivariate statistics and multiple linear regressions adjusting for school start year and year of first accreditation. RESULTS The cohort included 128,046 applicants from 1,973 medical schools across 162 countries. After excluding low-volume schools, 318 schools across 81 countries remained. These provided 99,598 applicants and 77,919 certificate holders, three-quarters of whom came from the Caribbean, South-Central Asia, and West Asia regions. Two hundred and fifty (78.6%) schools were accredited; 68 (21.4%) were not. Most ECFMG applicants (n = 84,776, 85.1%) and certificate holders (n = 68,444, 87.8%) attended accredited medical schools. Accredited schools had higher rates of ECFMG certification among graduates than non-accredited schools in comparisons that included all schools (75.0% (standard deviation [SD] = 10.6%) vs. 68.3% (SD = 15.9%), P < .001), and for countries that had both accredited and non-accredited schools (73.9% (SD = 11.4%) vs. 67.3% (SD = 16.8%), P = .023). After adjusting for age of school, longer duration of accreditation was associated with higher certification rates (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS Accreditation had a positive association with ECFMG certification rates. Future studies should investigate how accreditation processes might account for higher certification rates.","Tackett, Sean; Boulet, John R; van Zanten, Marta",Academic medicine : journal of the Association of American Medical Colleges,430,16

The purpose of this study was to evaluate if traditional vs. single-use instrumentation had an effect on SSI's. We compared SSI rates and costs of TKAs performed with single-use (449) and traditional (169) TKA instrumentation trays. Total OR Time was, on average, 30 min less when single-use instrumentation was used. SSIs decreased in the single-use group (n=1) compared to the traditional group (n=5) (P=0.006). Single-use instrumentation added $490 in initial costs; however it saved between $480 and $600. Single-use instrumentation may provide a benefit to the patient by potentially decreasing the risk of infection and reducing the overall hospital costs.","Siegel, Geoffrey W; Patel, Neil N; Milshteyn, Michael A; Buzas, David; Lombardo, Daniel J; Morawa, Lawrence G",The Journal of arthroplasty,430,12

Most studies focus on parenchymal destruction of the disease; but little is known about whether the disease affects the airway. This study was conducted to investigate the changes in airway dimensions and explore the associated factors during early convalescence in patients with COVID-19. Methods We retrospectively analyzed quantitative computed tomography (CT)-based airway measures of 69 patients with COVID-19 from 5 February to 17 March 2020, and 32 non-COVID-19 participants from 1 January 2018 to 31 December 2019 from Guangzhou, China. The well-established measures of wall area fraction and the square root of the wall area of a hypothetical bronchus with an inner perimeter of 10 mm, were used to describe airway wall dimensions. We described the characteristics of the dimensions and inner area of airways in 66 patients with COVID-19 at the initial and convalescent stages of the disease, and compared them with the non-COVID-19 group. Linear regression models were constructed to investigate the association of airway dimensions with duration of hospitalization or disease severity after recovery. Partial correlation coefficients were calculated to investigate whether inflammatory markers were related to airway dimensions. Results Among 66 patients with COVID-19, airway dimensions were greater during disease initiation than early convalescence, which was significantly greater than in non-COVID-19 participants. No significant difference was found between the patients with COVID-19 at the initial stage and the non-COVID-19 controls regarding the first to eighth generations of the inner area. In adjusted regression models, duration of hospitalization was negatively associated with wall area fraction of the first to the sixth generation of airways. No significant associations exist between airway dimensions and disease severity, or airway dimensions with inflammatory markers. Conclusions Airway dimensions in patients with COVID-19 during disease initiation are greater than those in non-COVID-19 participants. Such structural airway changes continue to remain significantly greater during early convalescence. No evidence shows that disease severity or inflammatory markers are associated with airway dimensions, implying that the primary lesion attacked by COVID-19 might not be the airways.","Xu, Jiaxuan; Liang, Zhenyu; Jian, Wenhua; Li, Jianyu; Tang, Guoyan; Mo, Xiaoneng; Zhang, Dongying; Zheng, Jinping; Qian, Yuanxin; Liu, Jinxin; Li, Shiyue",Journal of thoracic disease,430,15

METHODS In this randomized, single-blinded, noninferiority, controlled trial, we randomized patients scheduled for elective radical thyroidectomy to an endotracheal tube (ETT) group or a FLMA group. The primary outcomes were ventilation leak volume, peak airway pressure, and partial pressure of end-tidal carbon dioxide (PetCO2). Data for primary outcomes were collected after insertion of ETT/FLMA, at incision, and at 10-minute intervals during surgery. Ten milliliters, 5 cm H2O, and 10 mm Hg were used as the noninferiority deltas for ventilation leak volume, peak airway pressure, and PetCO2, respectively. We assessed noninferiority of FLMA to ETT on the primary outcomes over time using the results of a linear mixed-effects model. The position of FLMA mask was evaluated before and after surgery, and the airway complications were recorded. RESULTS A total of 132 patients were included: 65 in ETT group and 67 in FLMA group. Differences (FLMA group minus ETT group) of ventilation leak volume, peak airway pressure, and PetCO2 from the mixed-effects models were 2.09 mL (98.3% confidence interval [CI], -6.46 to 10.64), -0.60 cm H2O (98.3% CI, -2.15 to 0.96), and 1.02 mm Hg (98.3% CI, 0.04-1.99), respectively. Score of fiber-optic position of FLMA was significantly higher after surgery than before. There was no severe shift, loss of the mask seal, regurgitation, or aspiration in the FLMA group. One patient in the FLMA group experienced brief and easily controlled laryngospasm. CONCLUSIONS In thyroid surgery, FLMA is noninferior to ETT in the peak airway pressure and PetCO2 although mild to moderate mask shift could occur during surgical manipulation. There is no evidence for a higher complication rate when FLMA is used.","Gong, Yahong; Wang, Jin; Xu, Xiaohan; Li, Jianjin; Song, Ruiyue; Yi, Jie",Anesthesia and analgesia,430,1

In this study we sought to assess the learning curve of minimally invasive Ivor Lewis esophagectomy (MIILE) and to evaluate perioperative outcomes, including anastomotic leak and hospital readmission, as a function of graduated surgeon experience. METHODS Data were extracted from the electronic medical records of patients who underwent MIILE, performed by a single surgeon over an 8-year period (2009-2017). Primary outcomes were 5-year overall survival, postoperative complications, and 90-day readmission rates. Surgeon experience was divided into 4 quartiles, representing graduated experience. Statistical analysis was performed using univariate and multivariate logistic regression, whereas Kaplan-Meier estimators were used to assess survival outcomes. RESULTS A total of 170 patients underwent MIILE and were analyzed after exclusion criteria were applied. Five-year overall survival was 50.1% (95% confidence interval, 39.7%-63.2%). Mortality at 90 days was 3.9% (95% confidence interval, 0.8%-6.9%). Major complications occurred in 25.3% (n = 43) and 25.9% (n = 44) were readmitted to the hospital within 90 days after surgery. Conversion to open surgery, anastomotic leaks, and readmissions decreased over time.

79843,79843,79843,The Frustrating Experience of Trying to Do the Right Thing.,14.958422,5.164079,2021,"Ageing has been recognized as one of the most critically important health-care issues worldwide. It is relevant to Asia, where the increasing number of older populations has drawn attention to the paramount need for health-care investment, particularly in end-of-life care. The advocacy of advance care planning is a mean to honor patient autonomy. Since most East Asian countries are influenced by Confucianism and the concept of 'filial piety,' patient autonomy is consequently subordinate to family values and physician authority. The dominance from family members and physicians during a patient's end-of-life decision-making is recognized as a cultural feature in Asia. Physicians often disclose the patient's poor prognosis and corresponding treatment options to the male, family member rather to the patient him/herself. In order to address this ethical and practical dilemma, the concept of 'relational autonomy' and the collectivism paradigm might be ideally used to assist Asian people, especially older adults, to share their preferences on future care and decision-making on certain clinical situations with their families and important others. In this review article, we invited experts in end-of-life care from Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Singapore and Taiwan to briefly report the current status of advance care planning in each country from policy, legal and clinical perspectives. According to the Asian experiences, we have seen different models of advance care planning implementation. The Asian Delphi Taskforce for advance care planning is currently undertaken by six Asian countries and a more detailed, culturally sensitive whitepaper will be published in the near future.","Cheng, Shao-Yi; Lin, Cheng-Pei; Chan, Helen Yue-Lai; Martina, Diah; Mori, Masanori; Kim, Sun-Hyun; Ng, Raymond",Japanese journal of clinical oncology,430,16

However, there still lack the report of long-term outcomes of LS with the large-scale cases. The aim of the present study was to analyze the short- and long-term outcomes of LS in a single institution over 16 years, and to compare the perioperative outcomes of totally laparoscopic splenectomy (TLS) and hand-assisted laparoscopic splenectomy (HALS) for splenomegaly.Between November 2002 and December 2018, 486 consecutive patients undergoing elective LS were enrolled in this study, including 222 TLS and 264 HALS. The intraoperative, postoperative, and follow-up data were retrospectively analyzed.The 5 most common indications were hypersplenism (71.0%), immune thrombocytopenia (14.8%), splenic benign tumor (4.5%), splenic cyst (2.9%), and splenic malignant tumor (2.9%). The mean operative time, intraoperative blood loss, and length of stay were 149.4 ± 63.3 minutes, 230.1 ± 225.1 mL, and 6.7 ± 3.2 days, respectively. The morbidity, mortality, reoperation, and conversion rate were 23.0%, 0, 0.4%, and 1.9%, respectively. Portal vein system thrombosis (PVST) was the most frequent complication with an incidence of 19.8%. The incidence of PVST in HALS was higher than that in TLS (23.9% vs 14.9%, P = .013). Compared with TLS, HALS had a shorter operative time (P = .000), lower intraoperative blood loss (P = .000), comparable conversion rate (P = .271), and morbidity (P = .922) for splenomegaly > 17.0 cm. During the follow-up period, the overall respond rate for immune thrombocytopenia was 77.8%, and the esophagogastric variceal bleeding rate was 6.9% in 320 patients with hypersplenism secondary to hepatic cirrhosis.LS is a safe, feasible, and effective procedure with satisfactory short- and long-term outcomes. HALS is a reasonable technique in patients with massive spleens.","Fu, Xiaowei; Yang, Zhengjiang; Tu, Shuju; Xin, Wanpeng; Chen, Haiming; Li, Xueming; Li, Yong; Xiao, Weidong",Medicine,430,1

On the 30th of April, 64 days after this first diagnosis, the number of patients had increased exponentially, reaching 19 224 confirmed cases and 1859 (9.67%) deaths. In response to this global outbreak, we summarize the current state of our understanding regarding COVID-19 in Mexico. Methods We obtained the data from the official website of the Ministry of Health in Mexico. The study period was between the 27th of February and the 30th of April 2020. The cases were confirmed using real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, and we analysed epidemiological, demographic and clinical data. Results In Mexico, most cases of COVID-19 were located in Mexico City. The mean age of the patients was 46 years. Of the 12 656 confirmed cases, most infected individuals were between the ages of 30 and 59 years (65.85%), and there was a higher incidence rate in men (58.18%) than in women (41.82%). The patients who died had one or more comorbidities, mainly hypertension (45.53%), diabetes (39.39%) and obesity (30.4%). In the first 64 days of the epidemic, China had reported 80 304 cases with a mortality rate of 3.66%. Conclusions Our results indicate an early transmission of COVID-19 in Mexico. The descriptive epidemiology shows similarities between the cases of COVID-19 in Mexico and those in China. In the same period of the epidemic curve, we observed a reduction in the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Mexico and a higher mortality rate compared with that of China.","Suárez, V; Suarez Quezada, M; Oros Ruiz, S; Ronquillo De Jesús, E",Revista clinica espanola,430,7

These mental health issues can potentially lead to nurses taking leaves of absence and may require accommodations for their return to work. The purpose of this review was to map key themes in the peer-reviewed literature about accommodations for nurses' return to work following leaves of absence for mental health issues. METHODS A six-step methodological framework for scoping reviews was used to summarize the amount, types, sources, and distribution of the literature. The academic literature was searched through nine electronic databases. Electronic charts were used to extract code and collate the data. Findings were derived inductively and summarized thematically and numerically. RESULTS Academic literature is scarce regarding interventions for nurses' return to work following leaves of absence for mental health issues, and most focused on substance use concerns. Search of the peer-reviewed literature yielded only six records. The records were primarily quantitative studies (n = 4, 68%), published between 1997 and 2018, and originated in the United States (n = 6, 100%). The qualitative thematic findings addressed three major themes: alternative to discipline programs (ADPs), peer support, and return to work policies, procedures, and practices. CONCLUSIONS While the literature supports alternative to discipline programs as a primary accommodation supporting return to work of nurses, more on the effectiveness of such programs is required. Empirical evidence is necessary to develop, maintain, and refine much needed return to work accommodations for nurses after leaves of absence for mental health issues.","Covell, Christine L; Sands, Shamel Rolle; Ingraham, Kenchera; Lavoie-Tremblay, Melanie; Price, Sheri L; Reichert, Carol; Bourgeault, Ivy L",Human resources for health,430,1

Several studies have described typical clinical manifestations including fever, cough, diarrhea, and fatigue. However, to our knowledge, it has not been reported that patients with COVID-19 had any neurologic manifestations. Objective To study the neurologic manifestations of patients with COVID-19. Design, Setting, and Participants This is a retrospective, observational case series. Data were collected from January 16, 2020, to February 19, 2020, at 3 designated special care centers for COVID-19 (Main District, West Branch, and Tumor Center) of the Union Hospital of Huazhong University of Science and Technology in Wuhan, China. The study included 214 consecutive hospitalized patients with laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection. Main Outcomes and Measures Clinical data were extracted from electronic medical records, and data of all neurologic symptoms were checked by 2 trained neurologists. Neurologic manifestations fell into 3 categories: central nervous system manifestations (dizziness, headache, impaired consciousness, acute cerebrovascular disease, ataxia, and seizure), peripheral nervous system manifestations (taste impairment, smell impairment, vision impairment, and nerve pain), and skeletal muscular injury manifestations. Results Of 214 patients (mean [SD] age, 52.7 [15.5] years; 87 men [40.7%]) with COVID-19, 126 patients (58.9%) had nonsevere infection and 88 patients (41.1%) had severe infection according to their respiratory status. Overall, 78 patients (36.4%) had neurologic manifestations. Compared with patients with nonsevere infection, patients with severe infection were older, had more underlying disorders, especially hypertension, and showed fewer typical symptoms of COVID-19, such as fever and cough. Patients with more severe infection had neurologic manifestations, such as acute cerebrovascular diseases (5 [5.7%] vs 1 [0.8%]), impaired consciousness (13 [14.8%] vs 3 [2.4%]), and skeletal muscle injury (17 [19.3%] vs 6 [4.8%]). Conclusions and Relevance Patients with COVID-19 commonly have neurologic manifestations. During the epidemic period of COVID-19, when seeing patients with neurologic manifestations, clinicians should suspect severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection as a differential diagnosis to avoid delayed diagnosis or misdiagnosis and lose the chance to treat and prevent further transmission.","Mao, Ling; Jin, Huijuan; Wang, Mengdie; Hu, Yu; Chen, Shengcai; He, Quanwei; Chang, Jiang; Hong, Candong; Zhou, Yifan; Wang, David; Miao, Xiaoping; Li, Yanan; Hu, Bo",JAMA neurology,430,29

Key examination findings with cholestatic jaundice as an early manifestation led to suspicion of type 4 Farber disease. Observation of hydrocephalus, hypertension, bilateral pinguecula and Erlenmeyer flask deformity of the femur were unusual findings for Farber disease. The child had few features (pinguecula, Erlenmeyer flask deformity and hydrocephalus) overlapping with Gaucher disease. Alternatively, prosaposin deficiency (Farber disease type 7) was another differential diagnosis. Diagnosis of Farber disease was confirmed by detection of foamy macrophages on skin biopsy and two homozygous missense variants in ASAH1 gene.","Mhatre, Shweta; Muranjan, Mamta; Karande, Sunil; Balaji, Harish",BMJ case reports,430,1

To date, Mycobacterium bovis Bacillus Calmette Guerin (BCG) is the only licensed anti-TB vaccine worldwide, which provides an important but limited protection from the Mtb infection. The development of alternative anti-TB vaccines is therefore urgently needed. Here we report, the generation of Ad5-CEAB, a recombinant adenovirus expressing Mtb antigens of CFP10, ESAT6, Ag85A and Ag85B proteins in a form of mixture. In order to evaluate the immunogenicity of Ad5-CEAB, mice were immunized with Ad5-CEAB by intranasal instillation three times with 2-week intervals. The results demonstrated that Ad5-CEAB elicited a strong antigen-specific immune response, particularly of the Th1 immune responses that were characterized by an increased ratio of IgG2a/IgG1 and secretions of Th1 type cytokines, IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-2 and IL-12. In addition, the Ad5-CEAB also showed an ability to enhance humoral responses with a dramatically augmented antigen-specific serum IgG. Furthermore, an elevated sIgA were also found in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of the immunized mice, suggesting the elicitation of mucosal immune responses. These data indicate that Ad5-CEAB can induce a broad range of antigen-specific immune responses in vivo, which provides a promising and novel route for developing anti-TB vaccines and warrants further investigation.","Li, Wu; Deng, Guangcun; Li, Min; Zeng, Jin; Zhao, Liping; Liu, Xiaoming; Wang, Yujiong",Molecular immunology,430,1

METHODS Patients with cancer routinely tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by nasal swab and real-time polymerase chain reaction between March 21 and May 4, 2020, were included. The results of this cancer cohort were statistically compared with the SARS-CoV-2 prevalence in the Austrian population as determined by a representative nationwide random sample study (control cohort 1) and a cohort of patients without cancer presenting to our hospital (control cohort 2). RESULTS A total of 1,688 SARS-CoV-2 tests in 1,016 consecutive patients with cancer were performed. A total of 270 of 1,016 (26.6%) of the patients were undergoing active anticancer treatment in a neoadjuvant/adjuvant and 560 of 1,016 (55.1%) in a palliative setting. A total of 53 of 1,016 (5.2%) patients self-reported symptoms potentially associated with COVID-19. In 4 of 1,016 (0.4%) patients, SARS-CoV-2 was detected. At the time of testing at our department, all four SARS-CoV-2-positive patients were asymptomatic, and two of them had recovered from symptomatic COVID-19. Viral clearance was achieved in three of the four patients 14-56 days after testing positive. The estimated odds ratio of SARS-CoV-2 prevalence between the cancer cohort and control cohort 1 was 1.013 (95% CI, 0.209 to 4.272; P = 1), and between control cohort 2 and the cancer cohort it was 18.333 (95% CI, 6.056 to 74.157). CONCLUSION Our data indicate that continuation of active anticancer therapy and follow-up visits in a large tertiary care hospital are feasible and safe after implementation of strict population-wide and institutional safety measures during the current COVID-19 pandemic. Routine SARS-CoV-2 testing of patients with cancer seems advisable to detect asymptomatic virus carriers and avoid uncontrolled viral spread.","Berghoff, Anna S; Gansterer, Margaretha; Bathke, Arne C; Trutschnig, Wolfgang; Hungerländer, Philipp; Berger, Julia M; Kreminger, Judith; Starzer, Angelika M; Strassl, Robert; Schmidt, Ralf; Willschke, Harald; Lamm, Wolfgang; Raderer, Markus; Gottlieb, Alex D; Mauser, Norbert J; Preusser, Matthias",Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,430,1

The current pandemic in the United States poses unique challenges unlike any other for businesses and employers as they begin to reopen. Businesses and employers are forced to ensure that they are not only in compliance with federal guidances but also with state and local guidances. In addition to the complex and ever evolving guidances, we are still learning about and adapting best practices during these reopening phases. Therefore, it is crucial for businesses to stay up-to-date not only with the released guidances but also with the latest understanding and information about SARS-CoV-2. As part of reopening, it is crucial for businesses to have comprehensive reopening plans prior to restart of operation. These plans must be clear, concise, and flexible enough to include updated guidances and information. In this publication, we describe reopening frameworks, considerations, and strategies that can be used as a starting point for businesses to further optimize and tailor to their unique operations.","Parker, Justine; Boles, Corey; Egnot, Natalie; Sundermann, Alexander; Fleeger, Alan",Toxicology and industrial health,430,16

This study aims to compare the risk of mortality in patients with AKI receiving lower PD dosage and conventional intermittent hemodialysis (IHD) in Thailand. METHODS In a tertiary center in Thailand, a matched case-control study using propensity scores in patients with AKI was conducted to compare the outcomes between lower PD dosage (18 L per day for first two sessions, weekly Kt/V 2.2) and IHD (three times a week) from February 2015 to January 2016. The primary outcome was a 30-day in-hospital mortality rate. Secondary outcomes included dialysis dependence at 90 days. RESULTS Eighty-four patients were included (28 PD and 56 IHD). Patient characteristics were comparable between two treatment groups. Overall, the mean age was 58 years. Most of the patients were critically ill (87% need mechanical ventilator; mean acute physiological and chronic health evaluation (APACHE II) score: 25). The 30-day in-hospital mortality rate was similar between the PD and IHD patients (57% vs. 46%, p = 0.36). The dialysis dependence rate was also comparable at 90 days. The risk of death among AKI patients was higher in those with respiratory failure, higher APACHE II score, and starting dialysis with blood urea nitrogen greater than 70 mg dL-1. CONCLUSION Clinical outcomes, including risk of mortality and 90-day dialysis dependence among patients with AKI, appear to be comparable between lower dosage PD and IHD.","Parapiboon, Watanyu; Chumsungnern, Thosapol; Chamradpan, Treechada",Peritoneal dialysis international : journal of the International Society for Peritoneal Dialysis,430,1

The synthetic parameters greatly influence the morphologies of the final bimetallic Au-AgNSs, their stability and application potential as surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) substrates. Direct comparison of several types of Au NPs possessing different surface species and serving as seeds in Au-AgNSs synthesis is the main objective of this paper. Borohydride-reduced (with varying stages of borohydride hydrolysis) and citrate-reduced Au NPs were prepared and used as seeds in Au-AgNSs generation. The order of reactants in seed-mediated growth procedure represents another key factor influencing the final Au-AgNSs characteristics. Electronic absorption spectra, dynamic light scattering, zeta potential measurements, energy dispersive spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy were employed for Au-AgNSs characterization. Subsequently, possibilities and limitations of SERS-detection of unperturbed cationic porphyrin, 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(1-methyl-4-pyridyl)21H,23H-porphine (TMPyP), were investigated by using these Au-AgNSs. Only the free base (unperturbed) SERS spectral form of TMPyP is detected in all types of Au-AgNSs. It reports about a well-developed envelope of organic molecules around each Au-AgNSs which prevents metalation from occuring. TMPyP, attached via ionic interaction, was successfully detected in 10 nM concentration due to Au-AgNSs.","Vilímová, Iveta; Šišková, Karolína",Nanomaterials,430,12

Methods: We used direct sequencing for the genotyping of the SFTPC gene within 101 asthmatic children. The study of T138N and S186N variants in 110 controls is conducted by the PCR-RFLP technique. Results: The molecular study revealed 26 variants including 24 intronic variations and 2 exonic variations (T138N and S186N) with respective frequencies of 16.8% and 18.3%. We conducted a case-control study of the two identified exonic variations. A different genotypic and allelic distribution between the two groups was noted. Only the T138N polymorphism showed a significant association with asthma disease (p < 10-3). Statistical analysis elaborated four haplotypes with the following frequencies in patients vs controls: 138Thr-186Ser (79.5% vs 57.6%), 138Thr-186Asn (3.7% vs 7.8%), 138Asn-186Thr (2.2% vs 20.2%) and 138Asn-186Asn (14.6% vs 14.4%). A significant difference (p < 10-3) was highlighted in haplotype distribution. The 138Asn-186Ser (OR [95%CI] = 0.14[0.04-0.54], p = 0.004, R2=0.93) and 138Thr-186Asn (OR [95%CI] = 0.35[0.12-0.54], p = 0.047, R2=0.88) haplotypes showed a negative association with asthma which may constitute a protective factor against the disease. Conclusion: In Tunisia, this work constitutes the first report interested in the SFTPC gene and highlights the genetic variability of the SFTPC gene in asthma. Therefore, the case-controls analysis may be useful in the study of surfactant proteins dysfunction in chronic respiratory disease at an early age.","Nefzi, Malek; Wahabi, Imen; Hadj Fredj, Sondess; Othmani, Rym; Dabboubi, Rym; Boussetta, Khedija; Fanen, Pascale; Messaoud, Taieb",The Journal of asthma : official journal of the Association for the Care of Asthma,430,27

The selection and administration of resuscitation fluids is one component of this complex physiological sequence directed at restoring depleted intravascular volume. Presently, the selection of i.v. fluid is usually dictated more by local practice patterns than by evidence. The debate on fluid choice has primarily focused on evaluating outcome differences between 'crystalloids vs colloids'. More recently, however, there is interest in examining outcome differences based on the chloride content of crystalloid solutions. New insights into the conventional Starling model of microvascular fluid exchange may explain that the efficacy of colloids in restoring and maintaining depleted intravascular volume is only moderately better than crystalloids. A number of investigator-initiated, high-quality, randomized controlled trials have demonstrated that modest improvements in short-term physiological endpoints with colloids have not translated into better patient-centred outcomes. In addition, there is substantial evidence that certain types of fluids may independently worsen patient-centred outcomes. These include hydroxyethyl starch and albumin solutions in selected patient populations. There is no evidence to support the use of other colloids. The use of balanced salt solutions in preference to 0.9% saline is supported by the absence of harm in large observational studies. However, there is no compelling randomized trial-based evidence demonstrating improved clinical outcomes with the use of balanced salt solutions compared with 0.9% saline at this time.","Raghunathan, K; Murray, P T; Beattie, W S; Lobo, D N; Myburgh, J; Sladen, R; Kellum, J A; Mythen, M G; Shaw, A D",British journal of anaesthesia,430,16

However, while there is evidence documenting the growth in discrimination and xenophobia, little is known about how the COVID-19 outbreak is activating the expression of such negative attitudes. The goal of the current paper therefore was to investigate what aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic may be contributing to this rise in expressions of prejudice and xenophobia. More specifically, this study used an experimental design to assess the effects of using stigmatized language to describe the virus as well as the threat to physical health and economic wellbeing posed by the virus on COVID-19 prejudice. Data were collected from a national sample of 1451 adults residing within the United States. Results from 2 × 2 x 2 between-subjects analyses of covariance demonstrated that emphasizing the connection between China and COVID-19, rather than framing the virus neutrally, increased negative attitudes toward Asian Americans, beliefs that resources should be prioritized for Americans rather than immigrants, and general xenophobia. Emphasizing the severity of the economic impact of the virus also increased beliefs that Asian Americans are a threat to resources and general xenophobia. In contrast, messages which emphasized the serious health risks of COVID-19 did not increase bias toward Asian Americans or xenophobia. Our findings suggest that specific types of public health messaging related to infectious diseases, especially framing the virus in terms of its country of origin or its likely economic impact, may elicit prejudice and xenophobia. Public health campaigns that emphasize the severity of the virus, however, are not likely to trigger the same negative attitudes. Implications for public health responses to health crises are discussed.","Dhanani, Lindsay Y; Franz, Berkeley",Social science & medicine,430,1

A late and uncontrolled inflammatory response characterized by high activity of proinflammatory cytokines and the recruitment of neutrophils and macrophages develops in predisposed individuals and is potentially harmful in some cases. Interleukin (IL)-17 is one of the many cytokines released during coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). IL-17 is crucial in recruiting and activating neutrophils, cells that can migrate to the lung, and are heavily involved in the pathogenesis of COVID-19. During the infection T helper 17 (Th17) cells and IL-17-related pathways are associated with a worse outcome of the disease. All these have practical consequences considering that some drugs with therapeutic targets related to the Th17 response may have a beneficial effect on patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection.

In the routine accelerated ""fast track"" program the use of additional opioids was registered. RESULTS SILS was performed in 18 patients with cancer resections. Comparisons between the SILS procedures and the matched 36 CLS operations showed no significant difference in operation time, blood loss, lymph node harvest and hospital stay, but length of vascular pedicle was significantly larger in SILS procedures. Although only 50% of SILS patients received opioids postoperatively, this was not significantly different from the 71% receiving opioids in the CLS group, and similarly no significant difference in number of administrations or amount of opioids were seen.

MATERIALS AND METHODS We retrospectively selected a cohort of 86 COVID-19 patients (with positive reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction test results) from March to May 2020 at a tertiary hospital in the northeastern United States, who underwent chest CT and CXR within 48 hours. The ground-truth volumetric percentage of COVID-19-related AD (POv) was established by manual AD segmentation on CT. The resulting 3-dimensional masks were projected into 2-dimensional anterior-posterior DRR to compute area-based AD percentage (POa). A CNN was trained with DRR images generated from a larger-scale CT dataset of COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients, automatically segmenting lungs, AD, and quantifying POa on CXR. The CNN POa results were compared with POa quantified on CXR by 2 expert readers and to the POv ground truth, by computing correlations and mean absolute errors. RESULTS Bootstrap mean absolute error and correlations between POa and POv were 11.98% (11.05%-12.47%) and 0.77 (0.70-0.82) for average of expert readers and 9.56% to 9.78% (8.83%-10.22%) and 0.78 to 0.81 (0.73-0.85) for the CNN, respectively.

Recently, the cardiological effects of the virus have also been striking. To the best of our knowledge, there are no SARS CoV-2 positive paediatric cases reported with sinus bradycardia in the literature. CASE PRESENTATION A 14-year-old male patient presented with complaints of abdominal pain and fatigue. The heart rate of the patient, whose grandmother was found to be positive for SARS CoV-2 test, ranged between 43 and 60/min, the heart sounds were normal. There was no known history of cardiological disorder in the patient and his family. His laboratory findings were; normal Troponin I, elevated C Reactive protein, normal Haemoglobin, normal CK-MB, mildly elevated D-Dimer. Electrocardiography of the patient was evaluated as sinus bradycardia. There was no pathological finding in his echocardiography. The SARS CoV-2 PCR test was positive. In his follow-up, the heart rate decreased to 50 beats per minute while awake and 43 beats per minute while sleeping. The patient had a bradycardic course until the 4th day of hospitalisation. Control SARS CoV-2 PCR test was negative. He was discharged on the 8th day. CONCLUSION It's understood that SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for multiple cardiac manifestations. The most common bradyarrhythmia associated with SARS CoV-2 reported worldwide is sinus bradycardia and complete heart block. In order to contribute to the literature, we present a 14-year-old paediatric patient with positive SARS CoV-2 PCR test who has normal cardiac tests and sinus bradycardia.","Kilicaslan, Onder; Isancli, Didem Kizmaz; Ulutas, Omer Yilmaz; Ergin, Selma Oktay; Karbuz, Adem",Infectious diseases,430,8

However, little is known regarding the immunometabolic defects of T cells in COVID-19 patients, which may contribute to the deregulated immune functions of these cells. In this study, we longitudinally characterized the metabolic profiles of resting and activated T cells from acutely infected and convalescent COVID-19 patients by flow cytometry and confirmed the metabolic profiles with a Seahorse analyzer. Non-COVID-19 and healthy subjects were enrolled as controls. We found that ex vivo T cells from acutely infected COVID-19 patients were highly activated and apoptotic and displayed more extensive mitochondrial metabolic dysfunction, especially cells in CD8+ T cell lineages, than those from convalescent COVID-19 patients or healthy controls, but slightly disturbed mitochondrial metabolic activity was observed in non-COVID-19 patients. Importantly, plasma IL-6 and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels positively correlated with mitochondrial mass and negatively correlated with fatty acid uptake in T cells from COVID-19 patients. Additionally, compared with those from healthy controls, in vitro-activated T cells from acutely infected COVID-19 patients showed signs of lower glycolysis, a reduced glycolytic capacity, and a decreased glycolytic reserve, accompanied by lower activation of mTOR signaling. Thus, newly identified defects in T cell mitochondrial metabolic functions and metabolic reprogramming upon activation might contribute to immune deficiency in COVID-19.","Liu, Xiaoju; Zhao, Juanjuan; Wang, Haiyan; Wang, Wan; Su, Xu; Liao, Xuejiao; Zhang, Shuye; Sun, Jian; Zhang, Zheng",Journal of immunology,430,32

The system includes Memorial Medical Center in Springfield, Abraham Lincoln Memorial Hospital in Lincoln, Taylorville Memorial Hospital in Taylorville, Passavant Area Hospital in Jacksonville, Decatur Memorial Hospital in Decatur, and the Memorial Physician Services, Memorial Home Services, and Memorial Behavioral Health network across central Illinois. The evolution of MHS from a system in name only-lacking full integration of organizational functions-to its current status as an optimized health system has been marked by challenges, from the initial doubts of employees and the community to the upheaval caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Systemness requires visionary and sure-handed leadership to identify and realize economies of scale, share best practices for operational improvements, and reduce unwanted variation to improve quality of care. As the MHS story illustrates, that all starts, grows, and endures with strategic planning.","Daily, Aimee",Frontiers of health services management,430,1

METHOD A search of current literature on the COVID-19 crisis, and topics relevant to the mental health components associated with the pandemic are reviewed. Telemental health (TMH) and PMHNP practice are discussed as they relate to the unfolding picture of the viral pandemic. RESULTS The COVID-19 crisis is having far-reaching implications for mental health treatment and in particular for PMHNPs in practice settings. There have been widespread consequences of the containment measures used for the protection and mitigation of the disease. One such result has been the inability of patients to have face-to-face contact with their providers. The role of TMH has become increasingly important as an adaptation in professional practice. CONCLUSION Technology has rapidly transformed traditional practice due to the COVID-19 crisis and there is strong evidence that it is well accepted by patients and providers. It is incumbent on PMHNPs to embrace TMH and become educated on best practices and TMH services.","Schroeder, Rebecca A",Journal of the American Psychiatric Nurses Association,430,22

White matter injury after TBI is characterized by axon damage and demyelination, resulting in neural network impairment and neurological deficit. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) can promote white matter repair. The activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) has been reported to promote microglia/macrophages towards anti-inflammatory state and therefore to promote axon regeneration. Bexarotene, an agonist of retinoid X receptor (RXR), can activate RXR/PPARγ heterodimers. The aim of the present study was to identify the effect of bexarotene on BDNF in microglia/macrophages and axon sprouting after TBI in mice. Bexarotene was administered intraperitoneally in C57BL/6 mice undergoing controlled cortical impact (CCI). PPARγ dependency was determined by intraperitoneal administration of a PPARγ antagonist T0070907. We found that bexarotene promoted axon regeneration indicated by increased growth associated protein 43 (GAP43) expression, myelin basic protein (MBP) expression, and biotinylated dextran amine (BDA)+ axon sprouting. Bexarotene also increased microglia/macrophages-specific brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression after TBI. In addition, bexarotene reduced the number of pro-inflammatory microglia/macrophages while increased the number of anti-inflammatory microglia/macrophages after TBI. Moreover, bexaortene inhibited pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion. In addition, bexarotene treatment improved neurological scores and cognitive function of CCI-injured mice. These effects of bexarotene were partially abolished by T0070907. In conclusion, bexarotene promotes axon sprouting, increases microglia/macrophages-specific BDNF expression, and induces microglia/macrophages from a pro-inflammatory state towards an anti-inflammatory one after TBI at least partially in a PPARγ-dependent manner.","He, Junchi; Huang, Yike; Liu, Han; Sun, Xiaochuan; Wu, Jingchuan; Zhang, Zhaosi; Liu, Liu; Zhou, Chao; Jiang, Shaoqiu; Huang, Zhijian; Zhong, Jianjun; Guo, Zongduo; Jiang, Li; Cheng, Chongjie",Experimental neurology,430,31

METHODS Participants (N=3,500) were recruited through Qualtrics Panels to participate in an online survey examining methods for self-protection. ANCOVAs were utilized to assess suicidal ideation. Multivariate ANCOVAs were used to examine firearm storage practices and storage changes during COVID-19. Data were collected in late June and early July 2020, and analyses were conducted in July 2020. RESULTS Individuals who purchased a firearm during COVID-19 more frequently reported lifetime, past-year, and past-month suicidal ideation than nonfirearm owners and firearm owners who did not make a purchase during COVID-19. COVID-19 purchasers with lifetime ideation were less likely to hide loaded firearms in a closet than those without lifetime ideation. COVID-19 purchasers with past-year or past-month ideation were more likely to use locking devices than COVID-19 purchasers without past-month ideation. CONCLUSIONS In contrast to firearm owners more generally, COVID-19 firearm purchasers appear far more likely to have experienced suicidal ideation and appear less likely to use certain unsafe firearm storage methods but also report a greater number of storage changes during COVID-19 that made firearms less secure. Future research should seek to further understand those who purchased a firearm during COVID-19 and determine ways to increase secure storage among firearm owners.","Anestis, Michael D; Bond, Allison E; Daruwala, Samantha E; Bandel, Shelby L; Bryan, Craig J",American journal of preventive medicine,430,27

In the present study, we established a one-step, single tube, real-time accelerated loop-mediated isothermal amplification (real-time LAMP) for quantitative detection of WSSV. MATERIALS AND METHODS A set of six specially designed primers that recognize eight distinct sequences of the target. The whole process can be completed in 1 h under isothermal conditions at 63 degrees C. Detection and quantification can be achieved by real-time monitoring in an inexpensive turbidimeter based on threshold time required for turbidity in the LAMP reaction. A standard curve was constructed by plotting viral titre against the threshold time (T(t)) using plasmid standards with high correlation coefficient (R(2) = 0.988). CONCLUSIONS Sensitivity analysis using 10-fold dilutions (equivalent to 35 ng microl(-1) to 35 ag microl(-1)) of plasmid standards revealed this method is capable of detecting upto 100 copies of template DNA. Cross-reactivity analysis with DNA/cDNA of IHHNV, TSV, YHV-infected and healthy shrimp showed this method is highly specific for quantitative detection of WSSV. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY WSSV real-time LAMP assay appears to be precise, accurate and a valuable tool for the detection and quantification of WSSV in large field samples and epidemiological studies.","Mekata, T; Sudhakaran, R; Kono, T; Supamattaya, K; Linh, N T H; Sakai, M; Itami, T",Letters in applied microbiology,430,22

They are essential in many biological assays and have emerged as an important class of therapeutics. Unfortunately, current methods for mapping antibody epitopes require costly synthesis or enrichment steps, and no low-cost universal platform exists. In order to address this, we tested a random-sequence peptide microarray consisting of over 330,000 unique peptide sequences sampling 83% of all possible tetramers and 27% of pentamers. It is a single, unbiased platform that can be used in many different types of tests, it does not rely on informatic selection of peptides for a particular proteome, and it does not require iterative rounds of selection. In order to optimize the platform, we developed an algorithm that considers the significance of k-length peptide subsequences (k-mers) within selected peptides that come from the microarray. We tested eight monoclonal antibodies and seven infectious disease cohorts. The method correctly identified five of the eight monoclonal epitopes and identified both reported and unreported epitope candidates in the infectious disease cohorts. This algorithm could greatly enhance the utility of random-sequence peptide microarrays by enabling rapid epitope mapping and antigen identification.","Richer, Josh; Johnston, Stephen Albert; Stafford, Phillip",Molecular & cellular proteomics : MCP,430,1

Addition of Fe2+ and Ag+ to the probe solution enhanced the fluorescence intensity by 6 and 5 fold, respectively. Addition of Fe3+, Hg2+ and Ni2+ caused slight increase in the fluorescence intensity of the probe. While addition of other common metal ions did not bring about substantial change of the fluorescence. Thus the probe can be used for fluorescence turn-on detection of Fe2+ ion in ethanol/water (9:1) medium. The detection limit of the probe for Fe2+ is 0.77 µM. The suitable pH range for the probe to detect Fe2+ was pH 3 - 9. Other metal ions including Li+, Na+, K+, Ag+, Cu2+, Zn2+, Co2+, Ni2+, Mn2+, Sr2+, Hg2+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Al3+, Cr3+, and Fe3+ did not cause marked interference with Fe2+ recognition. The color of the probe solution was yellow at pH 1 - 2 and colorless at other pH values. The fluorescence intensity of the probe was low at pH 1 - 12 and increased significantly when the pH was 13 and 14, indicating that the probe can be used as a colorimetric and fluorescent probe for sensing extremely acidic or extremely alkaline conditions through different channels.","Zhang, Dan; Qi, Youguo; Li, Yanjie; Song, Yanxi; Xian, Chunying; Li, Hongqi; Cong, Peihong",Journal of fluorescence,430,11

We propose a laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) procedure without mesenteric closure with several specific technical details to avoid IH. To support this view, we have reviewed the outcome of our LRYGB patients and have carried out an anatomical study on cadavers. METHODS A retrospective observational study was carried out using the Unit's prospective database. The patients selected were those who were operated on for morbid obesity using LRYGB and who presented to the Emergency Unit with symptoms of intestinal obstruction (IO). Data concerning demographics, weight progress, technical details of the surgery, follow-up percentage, morbidity, and mortality were collected. Furthermore, an anatomical model was made in order to recreate the surgery on cadavers. RESULTS Only 1.6 % of postoperative IO and very few (0.3 %) of IH cases were associated with our technique of LRYGB without mesenteric closure. The anatomical model showed two large potential hernia spaces, but their supramesocolic situation, the orientation of the bowel loops, leaving the mesentery and omentum undivided and the antecolic passage of the alimentary limb made intestinal herniation difficult even though the mesenteric spaces were not closed. CONCLUSIONS With a proper technique, the closure of mesenteric spaces after a LRYGB is not essential to avoid postoperative IH in bariatric patients, as evidenced in an anatomical model.","Ortega, Joaquin; Cassinello, Norberto; Sánchez-Antúnez, David; Sebastián, Consuelo; Martínez-Soriano, Francisco",Obesity surgery,430,1

Lipids are known to regulate the location and activity of signaling proteins under physiological and pathophysiological conditions. Membrane lipid therapies (MLTs) that gradually modify lipid content of plasma membranes have been developed to treat chronic disease; however, no MLTs have been developed to treat acute conditions such as reperfusion injury following myocardial infarction (MI) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). A fusogenic nanoliposome (FNL) that rapidly incorporates exogenous unsaturated lipids into endothelial cell (EC) membranes was developed to attenuate reperfusion-induced protein signaling. We hypothesized that administration of intracoronary (IC) FNL-MLT interferes with EC membrane protein signaling, leading to reduced microvascular dysfunction and infarct size (IS). METHODS Using a myocardial ischemia/reperfusion swine model, the efficacy of FNL-MLT in reducing IS following a 60-min coronary artery occlusion was tested. Animals were randomized to receive IC Ringer's lactate solution with or without 10 mg/mL/min of FNLs for 10 min prior to reperfusion (n = 6 per group). RESULTS The IC FNL-MLT reduced IS (25.45 ± 16.4% vs. 49.7 ± 14.1%, P < 0.02) and enhanced regional myocardial blood flow (RMBF) in the ischemic zone at 15 min of reperfusion (2.13 ± 1.48 mL/min/g vs. 0.70 ± 0.43 mL/min/g, P < 0.001). The total cumulative plasma levels of the cardiac injury biomarker cardiac troponin I (cTnI) were trending downward but were not significant (999.3 ± 38.7 ng/mL vs. 1456.5 ± 64.8 ng/mL, P = 0.1867). However, plasma levels of heart-specific fatty acid binding protein (hFABP), another injury biomarker, were reduced at 2 h of reperfusion (70.3 ± 38.0 ng/mL vs. 137.3 ± 58.2 ng/mL, P = 0.0115). CONCLUSION: The IC FNL-MLT reduced IS compared to vehicle in this swine model. The FNL-MLT maybe a promising adjuvant to PCI in the treatment of acute MI.","Maldonado, Claudio; Nguyen, Mai-Dung; Bauer, Phillip; Nakamura, Shunichi; Khundmiri, Syed J; Perez-Abadia, Gustavo; Stowers, Heather L; Wu, Wen-Jian; Tang, Xian-Liang",Cardiovascular drugs and therapy,430,31

Disturbed amygdala-frontal network functions are central to the pathophysiology of SAD, marked by hypoactivity of the lateral prefrontal cortex (PFC), and hypersensitivity of the medial PFC and the amygdala. The objective of this study was to determine whether modulation of the dorsolateral and medial PFC activity with a novel intensified stimulation protocol reduces SAD core symptoms, improves treatment-related variables, and reduces attention bias to threatening stimuli. METHODS In this randomized, sham-controlled, double-blind trial, we assessed the efficacy of an intensified stimulation protocol (20 min, twice-daily sessions with 20 min intervals, 5 consecutive days) in two intensities (1 vs 2 mA) compared to sham stimulations. 45 patients with SAD were randomized in three tDCS arms (1-mA, 2-mA, sham). SAD symptoms, treatment-related variables (worries, depressive state, emotion regulation, quality of life), and attention bias to threatening stimuli (dot-probe paradigm) were assessed before and right after the intervention. SAD symptoms were also assessed at 2-month follow-up. RESULTS Both 1-mA and 2-mA protocols significantly reduced fear/avoidance symptoms, worries and improved, emotion regulation and quality of life after the intervention compared to the sham group. Improving effect of the 2-mA protocol on avoidance symptoms, worries and depressive state was significantly larger than the 1-mA group. Only the 2-mA protocol reduced attention bias to threat-related stimuli, the avoidance symptom at follow-up, and depressive states, as compared to the sham group. CONCLUSIONS Modulation of lateral-medial PFC activity with intensified stimulation can improve cognitive control, motivation and emotion networks in SAD and might thereby result in therapeutic effects. These effects can be larger with 2-mA vs 1-mA intensities, though a linear relationship between intensity and efficacy should not be concluded. Our results need replication in larger trials.","Jafari, Eisa; Alizadehgoradel, Jaber; Pourmohseni Koluri, Fereshteh; Nikoozadehkordmirza, Ezzatollah; Refahi, Meysam; Taherifard, Mina; Nejati, Vahid; Hallajian, Amir-Homayun; Ghanavati, Elham; Vicario, Carmelo M; Nitsche, Michael A; Salehinejad, Mohammad Ali",Brain stimulation,430,7

We aimed to compare the impact of a neurology outpatient versus inpatient rotation setting on the grades obtained by medical students as an a proxy measure of the learning outcomes. METHODS We compared the results obtained by 4th year medical students in a practical (OSCE) and a multiple choice question (MCQ) exams in Neurology, between students whose main (total of 24 hours contact) teaching allocation was either the outpatient or inpatient setting, controlling for students' gender, teacher, academic year and student' previous achievement (measured by their scores on practical evaluation). RESULTS A total of 1127 students were included, of whom 644 (57.14%) were allocated mainly to the neurology ward and 483 (42.86%) to the outpatient clinic. Students placed in the ward obtained significantly higher grades in the OSCE and MCQ exams than those placed in the outpatient clinic. Teaching setting was an independent predictor of both classifications after adjustment. CONCLUSIONS The teaching setting had a significant impact on the learning outcomes. This may be due to a higher likelihood of observing abnormal neurological signs or to a more student-centered teaching in the ward. These results highlight the importance of a balanced distribution of students by different clinical settings.","Martins, Isabel Pavão; Fonseca, Ana Catarina; Pires, Luísa; Ferro, José M",European journal of neurology,430,1

Here, we have assessed the importance of CYTOR (linc00152) as a biomarker for the detection of breast cancer in both tumoral tissue and plasma. The relative expression of breast cancer-associated CYTOR was measured in 20 tumoral and paired margin tissues, and moreover, in 80 plasma samples by real-time-polymerase chain reaction. In addition, plasma levels of CA 15-3 were measured using the ELISA test. The receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) was applied for assessing the sensitivity and specificity of tested biomarkers.

Since the current pandemic of the SARS-CoV-2 virus is a great concern for everybody in the World, the frequently asked question is how and when the COVID-19 process will be concluded. The aim of this paper is to propose hypotheses in order to answer this essential question. As recently demonstrated, SARS-CoV-2 RNAs can be reverse-transcribed and integrated into the human genome. Our main hypothesis is that the ultimate aim of the SARS-CoV-2 virus is the incorporation to human genome and being an element of the intestinal virobiota. MATERIALS AND METHODS We propose that the SARS-CoV-2 genomic incorporation to be a part of human virobiota is essentially based on three pathobiological phases which are called as the ?induction?, ?consolidation? and ?maintenance phases?. The phase of ?recurrence? complicate any of these three disease phases based on the viral load, exposure time, and more contagious strains and/or mutants. We have performed the ?Random Walk Model? in order to predict the community transmission kinetics of the virus. RESULTS Chimerism-mediated immunotherapy at the individual and community level with the help of vaccination seems to be the only option for ending the COVID-19 process. After the SARS-CoV-2 virus integrated into the human genome via the induction, consolidation and maintenance phases as an element of intestinal virobiota, the chimerism would be concluded. The ?viral load?, the ?genomic strain of the SARS-CoV-2? and ?host immune reaction against the SARS-CoV-2? are the hallmarks of this long journey.

Consequently, when the effect of the practise of PA was evaluated in terms of the number of practises per week and in minutes per practise per week, a protective effect was observed, where moderate PA >150 min per week reported an inverse association with hospitalization for respiratory symptoms (RR: 95%CI: 0.24, 0.05-1.04, P = 0.05). Likewise, overweight (RR: 16.3, 95%CI: 1.93-137.9, P = 0.01), obesity (RR: 19.1, 95%CI: 1.63-222.5, P = 0.019) and non-performance of moderate PA (RR: 4.12, 95%CI; 0.95-17.76, P = 0.05) reported positive associations with hospitalization for respiratory symptoms. Thus, the practise of moderate PA (>150 min per week) is a protective factor against hospitalization for respiratory symptoms consistent with COVID-19 symptoms.","Latorre-Román, Pedro Ángel; Guzmán-Guzmán, Iris Paola; Delgado-Floody, Pedro; Herrador Sanchez, Julio; Aragón-Vela, Jerónimo; García Pinillos, Felipe; Párraga Montilla, Juan A",Research in sports medicine,430,1

We conducted a single-center observational study with the aim of analyzing the coagulation patterns of intensive care unit (ICU) COVID-19 patients with both standard laboratory and viscoelastic tests. The presence of coagulopathy at the onset of the infection and after seven days of systemic anticoagulant therapy was investigated. PATIENTS AND METHODS Forty consecutive SARS-CoV-2 patients, admitted to the ICU of a University hospital in Italy between 29th February and 30th March 2020 were enrolled in the study, providing they fulfilled the acute respiratory distress syndrome criteria. They received full-dose anticoagulation, including Enoxaparin 0.5 mg·kg-1 subcutaneously twice a day, unfractionated Heparin 7500 units subcutaneously three times daily, or low-intensity Heparin infusion. Thromboelastographic (TEG) and laboratory parameters were measured at admission and after seven days. RESULTS At baseline, patients showed elevated fibrinogen activity [rTEG-Ang 80.5° (78.7 to 81.5); TEG-ACT 78.5 sec (69.2 to 87.9)] and an increase in the maximum amplitude of clot strength [FF-MA 42.2 mm (30.9 to 49.2)]. No alterations in time of the enzymatic phase of coagulation [CKH-K and CKH-R, 1.1 min (0.85 to 1.3) and 6.6 min (5.2 to 7.5), respectively] were observed. Absent lysis of the clot at 30 minutes (LY30) was observed in all the studied population. Standard coagulation parameters were within the physiological range: [INR 1.09 (1.01 to 1.20), aPTT 34.5 sec (29.7 to 42.2), antithrombin 97.5% (89.5 to 115)]. However, plasma fibrinogen [512.5 mg·dl-1 (303.5 to 605)], and D-dimer levels [1752.5 ng·ml-1 (698.5 to 4434.5)], were persistently increased above the reference range. After seven days of full-dose anticoagulation, average TEG parameters were not different from baseline (rTEG-Ang p = 0.13, TEG-ACT p = 0.58, FF-MA p = 0.24, CK-R p = 0.19, CKH-R p = 0.35), and a persistent increase in white blood cell count, platelet count and D-dimer was observed (white blood cell count p < 0.01, neutrophil count p = 0.02, lymphocyte count p < 0.01, platelet count p = 0.13 < 0.01, D-dimer levels p= 0.02). CONCLUSIONS SARS-CoV-2 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome show elevated fibrinogen activity, high D-dimer levels and maximum amplitude of clot strength. Platelet count, fibrinogen, and standard coagulation tests do not indicate a disseminated intravascular coagulation. At seven days, thromboelastographic abnormalities persist despite full-dose anticoagulation.","Bocci, M G; Maviglia, R; Consalvo, L M; Grieco, D L; Montini, L; Mercurio, G; Nardi, G; Pisapia, L; Cutuli, S L; Biasucci, D G; Gori, C; Rosenkranz, R; De Candia, E; Carelli, S; Natalini, D; Antonelli, M; Franceschi, F",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,430,1

To this end, we compared in 18 healthy participants abductor pollicis brevis (APB) corticospinal excitability during MI, AO or MT, as well as MI combined with either AO or MT. In each condition, 15 motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) and three maximal M-wave were elicited in the right APB.

Upon HIV-1 infection, mouse T-cell lines fail to express viral proteins, but the underlying replication barrier has thus far not been unambiguously identified. Here, we performed a kinetic and quantitative assessment of consecutive steps in the early phase of the HIV-1 replication cycle in T-cells from mice and humans. RESULTS Both T-cell lines and primary T-cells from mice harbor a severe post-entry defect that is independent of potential species-specTR transactivation. Reverse transcription occurred efficiently following VSV-G-mediated entry of virions into mouse T-cells, and abundant levels of 2-LTR circles indicated successful nuclear import of the pre-integration complex. To probe the next step in the retroviral replication cycle, i.e. the integration of HIV-1 into the host cell genome, we established and validated a nested real-time PCR to specifically quantify HIV-1 integrants exploiting highly repetitive mouse B1 elements. Importantly, we demonstrate that the frequency of integrant formation is diminished 18- to > 305-fold in mouse T-cell lines compared to a human counterpart, resulting in a largely abortive infection. Moreover, differences in transgene expression from residual vector integrants, the transcription off which is cyclin T1-independent, provided evidence for an additional, peri-integrational deficit in certain mouse T-cell lines. CONCLUSION In contrast to earlier reports, we find that mouse T-cells efficiently support early replication steps up to and including nuclear import, but restrict HIV-1 at the level of chromosomal integration.","Tervo, Hanna-Mari; Goffinet, Christine; Keppler, Oliver T",Retrovirology,430,1

Findings in animals suggest that pro-inflammatory cytokines released by activated immune cells in the periphery evoke these behavioral symptoms by driving inflammatory changes in the brain. However, experimental data in humans are lacking. Here we demonstrate in healthy male volunteers (10 endotoxin treated, 8 placebo treated) that intravenous administration of low-dose endotoxin (0.8 ng/kg body weight), a prototypical pathogen-associated molecular pattern that activates the innate immune system, not only induces a significant increase in peripheral blood cytokine concentrations (that is, tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10) but also results, with some latency, in a robust and selective increase of IL-6 in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Moreover, we found a strong association between the endotoxin-induced increase of IL-6 in the CSF and the severity of mood impairment, with larger increases in CSF IL-6 concentration followed by a greater deterioration in mood. Taken together, these findings suggest that the appearance of depressive symptoms in inflammatory conditions might be primarily linked to an increase in central IL-6 concentration, identifying IL-6 as a potential therapeutic target in mood disorders.","Engler, H; Brendt, P; Wischermann, J; Wegner, A; Röhling, R; Schoemberg, T; Meyer, U; Gold, R; Peters, J; Benson, S; Schedlowski, M",Molecular psychiatry,430,31

Our aim was to compare the dilation-free period of patients who underwent dilation up to 16 mm with patients who were dilated up to 17 or 18 mm. METHODS We retrospectively analyzed adult patients who received bougie/balloon dilation for a benign anastomotic stricture after esophagectomy. An anastomotic stricture was defined as dysphagia in combination with a luminal diameter of ≤13 mm at endoscopy. We analyzed the dilation-free period using Kaplan-Meier and multivariable Cox regression analysis. RESULTS Eighty-eight patients were dilated up to a maximum diameter of 16 mm and 91 patients to a diameter >16 mm. The stricture recurrence rate was 79.5 % in the 16 mm group and 68.1 % in the >16 mm group (p = 0.083). The overall dilation-free period had a median of 41.5 (range 8-3233) days and 92 (range 17-1745) days, respectively (p < 0.001). For patients who developed a stricture recurrence, the median dilation-free period was 28 (range 8-487) days and 63 (range 17-1013) days, respectively (p = 0.001). Cox regression analysis showed a reduced risk of stricture recurrence for patients who were dilated up to >16 mm: crude hazard ratio (HR) 0.57 (95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.41-0.81) and adjusted HR 0.48 (95 % CI 0.33-0.70).

In the past years there has been disagreement on whether burnout and depression are the same or different constructs, as they appear to share some common features (e.g., loss of interest and impaired concentration). However, the results so far are inconclusive and researchers disagree with regard to the degree to which we should expect such overlap. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to examine the relationship between burnout and depression. Additionally, given that burnout is the result of chronic stress and that working environments can often trigger anxious reactions, we also investigated the relationship between burnout and anxiety. Method: We searched the online databases SCOPUS, Web of Science, MEDLINE (PubMed), and Google Scholar for studies examining the relationship between burnout and depression and burnout and anxiety, which were published between January 2007 and August 2018. Inclusion criteria were used for all studies and included both cross-sectional and longitudinal designs, published and unpublished research articles, full-text articles, articles written in the English language, studies that present the effects sizes of their findings and that used reliable research tools. Results: Our results showed a significant association between burnout and depression (r = 0.520, SE = 0.012, 95% CI = 0.492, 0.547) and burnout and anxiety (r = 0.460, SE = 0.014, 95% CI = 0.421, 0.497). However, moderation analysis for both burnout-depression and burnout-anxiety relationships revealed that the studies in which either the MBI test was used or were rated as having better quality showed lower effect sizes. Conclusions: Our research aims to clarify the relationship between burnout-depression and burnout-anxiety relationships. Our findings revealed no conclusive overlap between burnout and depression and burnout and anxiety, indicating that they are different and robust constructs. Future studies should focus on utilizing more longitudinal designs in order to assess the causal relationships between these variables.","Koutsimani, Panagiota; Montgomery, Anthony; Georganta, Katerina",Frontiers in psychology,430,6

However, genital ulcerations due to hydroxyurea therapy are a rare, and likely underrecognized, adverse effect with only a few cases reported in the literature to date. Ulcers of the lower legs caused by hydroxyurea are associated with a diagnostic delay, and this is likely exacerbated in cases of genital ulceration due to a lack of awareness.

STUDY DESIGN Prospective cohort with 125 women evaluated in the immediate postpartum period (before the pandemic - T1) in Hospital de Clínicas de Porto Alegre, 3 months (pandemic onset - T2) and 6 months (pandemic peak - T3) after birth by email and WhatsApp. The Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) and the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) were applied. RESULTS Fifty puerperal women participated in the three periods of the study. The median age was 25 years. There was an inverse correlation between the ​​ FSFI and EPDS values at T2 (p < 0.001) and T3 (p < 0.001), demonstrating that the worsening sexual response was secondary to the higher prevalence of depressive symptoms in the puerperium in the COVID-19 pandemic. There was an increase in EPDS scores in the three periods: at T1, the EPDS scores ​​were 5.0 (2.0-9.0), increasing to 7.0 (4.0-14.0) at T2 and 6.5 (3.0-13.0) at T3 (p = 0.004). There was no difference between the FSFI index at the three evaluated times.

Lack of skills and knowledge on the part of health care providers have a negative effect on their access to care and health outcomes. This study 1) explores the knowledge and attitudes of medical students regarding LGBT people, and 2) assesses the impact of a one-hour lecture targeting adolescent LGBT health needs. METHODS Fourth-year medical students attended a compulsory one-hour lecture on sexual orientation and gender identity development in adolescence, highlighting health issues. We created a questionnaire with items to elicit students' knowledge and attitudes about LGBT health issues. Students were invited to complete this questionnaire online anonymously one week before the lecture and one month after the lecture. RESULTS Out of a total of 157 students, 107 (68.2%) responded to the pre-intervention questionnaire and 96 (61.1%) to the post-intervention questionnaire. A significant proportion-13.7% of all respondents-identified as LGBT or questioning. Our results show that most medical students already show favorable attitudes towards LGBT people and a certain degree of knowledge of LGBT health needs. They demonstrated a large and significant increase in knowledge of LGBT health issues one month after the lecture. DISCUSSION A single one-hour lecture on sexual orientation and LGBT health issues may increase knowledge among medical students. Medical students and professionals should receive such training to increase their knowledge about LGBT patients as it, together with favorable attitudes, has the potential to improve health outcomes among this vulnerable population.","Wahlen, Raphaël; Bize, Raphaël; Wang, Jen; Merglen, Arnaud; Ambresin, Anne-Emmanuelle",PloS one,430,31

TECHNIQUE Following a failed arterial recanalization attempt, a balloon catheter is passed up to the tip of the guidewire. Venous access is gained distally, a 4-F sheath is antegradely passed, and a 4-mm GooseNeck snare is advanced through it. A fluoroscopic view that overlaps the snare and the inflated balloon is obtained. If the vein remains anterior with respect to the artery, a needle is inserted across the vein, passing through the snare loop and puncturing the intra-arterial balloon. A wire is inserted and placed inside the punctured balloon. The balloon is retrieved and the wire externalized through the femoral access. A catheter is advanced antegradely over this wire from the artery into the vein. If the vein remains posterior to the artery, a needle is inserted, puncturing the balloon and thereafter the vein (crossing through the snare). A wire is inserted, captured by the snare, and externalized through the vein sheath. A catheter is finally advanced over this wire from the vein into the artery. CONCLUSION This maneuver is a simple alternative to create an arteriovenous fistula during venous arterialization procedures in patients with no-option critical limb ischemia.","Ysa, August; Lobato, Marta; Mikelarena, Ederi; Arruabarrena, Amaia; Gómez, Roberto; Apodaka, Ana; Metcalfe, Matthew; Fonseca, Juan L",Journal of endovascular therapy : an official journal of the International Society of Endovascular Specialists,430,1

These analyses identified clinical factors related to resolution of reflux-related sleep disturbance in subjects treated with esomeprazole 20 mg for 14 days. METHODS Data from the first 14 days of 2 similar randomized, double-blind studies were pooled for subjects experiencing frequent heartburn and related sleep disturbances receiving esomeprazole 20 mg (n = 357) or placebo (n = 346). A stepwise logistic regression analysis was performed with pooled and individual study data to evaluate relationships between clinical factors [treatment (esomeprazole vs. placebo), run-in sleep disturbance frequency, occurrence (yes/no) of 24-h, daytime, and nighttime heartburn (yes: ≥1 episode in 14-day treatment period)] and complete sleep disturbance resolution (no disturbances for 7 consecutive days). RESULTS Absence of daytime (p = 0.0018) or nighttime (p < 0.0001) heartburn during treatment was a significant predictor of complete sleep disturbance resolution at 14 days for the total population, while higher run-in sleep disturbance frequency (p < 0.0001) was associated with a lower likelihood of resolution. Esomeprazole treatment was an independent significant predictor of improvement across all endpoints (p < 0.0001). A significant treatment by run-in sleep disturbance interaction was observed for complete resolution (p = 0.0231), indicating greater therapeutic benefit with esomeprazole in subgroups with higher run-in symptom frequency. CONCLUSIONS Lower run-in sleep disturbance frequency, no occurrence of daytime or nighttime heartburn during therapy, and esomeprazole treatment predicted complete reflux-related sleep disturbance resolution. The magnitude of therapeutic benefit for esomeprazole 20 mg over placebo increased with increasing baseline sleep disturbance.","Johnson, David A; Le Moigne, Anne; Li, Jing; Pollack, Charles; Nagy, Peter",Clinical drug investigation,430,16

As part of a wider suite of surveys, the European Federation of Radiographer Societies (EFRS) wanted to investigate the extent and scope of practice for radiographers practising ultrasound across Europe. This report details the results of the initial survey, exploring the views of the EFRS countries' National Radiographer Societies. METHODS An electronic survey was sent to representatives of the 43 national radiographer societies who were members of the EFRS. Questions asked about radiographer practice in ultrasound within individual countries, scope of the role, particularly report writing, in addition to investigating current ultrasound education, barriers and opinions on priorities for radiographer ultrasound practice. RESULTS Forty individual responses were received, from a total of 27 countries, covering 62.8% of the EFRS member societies invited to participate. Radiologists or specialised medical practitioners performed ultrasound in the majority of countries. Radiographers practise ultrasound in 48% of countries and 11% have some limited involvement in ultrasound. Countries without radiographer engagement in ultrasound reported legislative issues or lack of acceptance from the medical professions (52%) and/or limited specific ultrasound education (39%) as predominant factors. In most countries where radiographers practise ultrasound, clinical reporting is a descriptive report or checklist approved by a medical doctor/radiologist. CONCLUSION The results highlight the scope of practice and barriers faced in some EFRS countries to enabling radiographers to develop their skills and competencies in ultrasound. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE Priorities for radiographer societies to assist in the development of ultrasound as a pathway for radiographer progression in countries, where it is not yet available, include education programmes, acceptance by medical professionals and changes to legislation.","Harrison, G; Kraus, B; Martins Dos Santos, R; Noij-Rijkes, S; Pedersen, M R V",Radiography,430,17

Within a 1.5 T MRI operating room immediately prior to neurosurgery, a passive finger flexion sensorimotor paradigm was performed on each hand with the patients awake, and then immediately after the induction and maintenance of combined sevoflurane and propofol general anaesthesia. The depth of surgical anaesthesia was measured and confirmed with an EEG-derived technique, the Bispectral Index (BIS). The magnitude of the task-related BOLD response and BOLD sensitivity under anaesthesia were determined. The fMRI data were assessed by three fMRI expert observers who rated each activation map for somatotopy and usefulness for radiological neurosurgical guidance. The mean magnitudes of the task-related BOLD response under a BIS measured depth of surgical general anaesthesia were 25% (tumour affected hemisphere) and 22% (tumour free hemisphere) of the respective awake values. BOLD sensitivity under anaesthesia ranged from 7% to 83% compared to the awake state. Despite these reductions, somatotopic BOLD activation was observed in the sensorimotor cortex in all ten data acquisitions surpassing statistical thresholds of at least p < 0.001uncorr. All ten fMRI activation datasets were scored to be useful for radiological neurosurgical guidance. Passive task-related sensorimotor fMRI acquired in neurosurgical patients under multi-pharmacological general anaesthesia is reproducible and yields clinically useful activation maps. These results demonstrate the feasibility of the technique and its potential value if applied intra-operatively. Additionally these methods may enable fMRI investigations in patients unable to perform or lie still for awake paradigms, such as young children, claustrophobic patients and those with movement disorders.","Yamamoto, Adam Kenji; Magerkurth, Joerg; Mancini, Laura; White, Mark J; Miserocchi, Anna; McEvoy, Andrew W; Appleby, Ian; Micallef, Caroline; Thornton, John S; Price, Cathy J; Weiskopf, Nikolaus; Yousry, Tarek A",NeuroImage.

To control the epidemic, the Chinese government mandated a quarantine of the Wuhan city on January 23, 2020. To explore the effectiveness of the quarantine of the Wuhan city against this epidemic, transmission dynamics of COVID-19 have been estimated. METHODS A well-mixed ""susceptible exposed infectious recovered"" (SEIR) compartmental model was employed to describe the dynamics of the COVID-19 epidemic based on epidemiological characteristics of individuals, clinical progression of COVID-19, and quarantine intervention measures of the authority. RESULTS Considering infected individuals as contagious during the latency period, the well-mixed SEIR model fitting results based on the assumed contact rate of latent individuals are within 6-18, which represented the possible impact of quarantine and isolation interventions on disease infections, whereas other parameter were suppose as unchanged under the current intervention. CONCLUSION The present study shows that, by reducing the contact rate of latent individuals, interventions such as quarantine and isolation can effectively reduce the potential peak number of COVID-19 infections and delay the time of peak infection.

The environmental behavior and fate of SMX in agricultural soils are not well understood, especially when the adsorption behavior is disturbed by the dissolved organic matter (DOM) released by crop straw. As canola straw is one of the biomasses widely returned to farmlands, we characterized DOM derived from pristine and decomposed canola straw, and explored the effects and mechanisms of the DOMs on regulating SMX adsorption to purple paddy soils. The spectral analysis showed that the molecular weight, aromaticity, and hydrophobicity of canola straw-derived DOM increased as decomposition proceeded. These physicochemical properties collectively determined the effects of the DOM on SMX adsorption. The DOM derived from pristine canola straw increased SMX maximum adsorption capacity of the soils by approximately 2.6 times, but this positive effect gradually decreased to a steady state by day 90 in the straw decomposition period. Nevertheless, the SMX adsorption behavior in the soils was invariably determined by the DOM extracts. These adsorption processes of SMX were well fitted by the double-chamber kinetics model and the Langmuir and Freundlich thermodynamic models. Thermodynamic parameters indicated that SMX adsorption onto the soils was spontaneous and endothermic, and this adsorption characteristics was not significantly (p > 0.05) changed by the DOM extracts. However, the adsorption kinetics were altered by those DOMs, i.e., the fast and slow adsorption processes were both diminished. Correspondingly, co-adsorption and cumulative adsorption were identified as the main mechanisms determining SMX adsorption to the purple paddy soils in the presence of the straw-derived DOMs. These results collectively indicated that the DOMs released by straw in croplands may decrease the ecological risks of organic pollutants by inhibiting their migration processes.","Wang, Bin; Li, Ming; Zhang, Haiyang; Zhu, Jingping; Chen, Shu; Ren, Dong",Ecotoxicology and environmental safety,430,6

Its intention is to make a case for a contextually relevant, multisystemic understanding of the resilience of sub-Saharan children and youth with exposure to maltreatment. METHOD This discussion paper draws on a critical analysis of pertinent peer-reviewed publications. It also draws on our lifelong residence in sub-Saharan Africa and related insight into this region's situational and cultural dynamics. RESULTS We advance three assertions regarding the multisystemic nature of sub-Saharan young people's resilience to abuse and neglect : (i) family↔communities are pivotal to sub-Saharan child and youth resilience to maltreatment; (ii) institutional supports matter too, particularly when multiple systems interact to provide networks of institutional support; and (iii) the resilience-enabling potential of built and natural environments is yet to be fully harnessed. CONCLUSION Interacting social and ecological system factors and processes matter for the resilience of sub-Saharan children and youth who experience abuse and neglect.

However, the key genes involved in ccRCC metastasis remain largely unknown. Purpose The identification of the aberrant gene expression patterns associated with metastatic traits is of great clinical significance. The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical significance and function of PDE7B in ccRCC. Materials and Methods Expression profiling data for patient-matched primary and metastatic ccRCC tumors were obtained from GEO Dataset. Limma package was used to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the metastatic and the primary groups. Gene Ontology, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes Genomes (KEGG), and PPI network analysis were used to study the interacting activities and the interconnection of the DEGs. CCK-8 assays and Transwell assays were performed to detect the proliferation and migration of renal cancer cells. Results We obtained 163 DEGs, including 132 that were upregulated and 31 that were downregulated in metastatic ccRCC tissues. Both Gene Ontology function and KEGG pathway analysis showed that DEGs were involved in extracellular matrix (ECM) organization and cell adhesion. After utilizing PPI network to explore the interconnection among the DEGs, 22 genes were selected as the hub genes. Subsequently, survival analysis revealed that seven hub genes (SFN, NKX2-1, HP, MAPT, EPHA4, KCNAB1, and PDE7B) were significantly associated with overall survival disease-specific survival, and progression-free interval in ccRCC. Moreover, the low expression of PDE7B was found in clinical ccRCC samples and correlated with TNM stage and histologic grade. We further showed that knockdown of PDE7B increased cell growth and migration of renal cancer cells. Conclusion Our results implicated that PDE7B may play a key role in the development of metastatic RCC.","Sun, Yi; Zou, Junxia; Ouyang, Wei; Chen, Ke",Cancer management and research,430,26

Adequate oxygenation is very important during sedated esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD). Nasal breathing often shifts to oral breathing during open mouth EGD. A mandibular advancement bite block was developed for EGD using computer-assisted design and three-dimensional printing techniques. The mandible is advanced when using this bite block to facilitate airway opening. The device is composed of an oxygen inlet with one opening directed towards the nostril and another opening directed towards the oral cavity. The aim of this bench study was to compare the inspired oxygen concentration (FiO2) provided by the different nasal cannulas, masks, and bite blocks commonly used in sedated EGD. A manikin head was connected to one side of a two-compartment lung model by a 7.0 mm endotracheal tube with its opening in the nasopharyngeal position. The other compartment was driven by a ventilator to mimic ""patient"" inspiratory effort. Using this spontaneously breathing lung model, we evaluated five nasal cannulas, two face masks, and four new oral bite blocks at different oxygen flow rates and different mouth opening sizes. The respiratory rate was set at 12/min with a tidal volume of 500 mL and 8/min with a tidal volume of 300 mL. Several Pneuflo resistors of different sizes were used in the mouth of the manikin head to generate different degrees of mouth opening. FiO2 was evaluated continuously via the endotracheal tube. All parameters were evaluated using a Datex anesthesia monitoring system. The mandibular advancement bite block provided the highest FiO2 under the same supplemental oxygen flow. The FiO2 was higher for devices with oxygen flow provided via an oral bite block than that provided via the nasal route. Under the same supplemental oxygen flow, the tidal volume and respiratory rate also played an important role in the FiO2. A low respiratory rate with a smaller tidal volume has a relative high FiO2. The ratio of nasal to oral breathing played an important role in the FiO2 under hypoventilation but less role under normal ventilation. Bite blocks deliver a higher FiO2 during EGD. The ratio of nasal to oral breathing, supplemental oxygen flow, tidal volume, and respiratory rate influenced the FiO2 in most of the supplemental oxygen devices tested, which are often used for conscious sedation in patients undergoing EGD and colonoscopy.","Teng, Wei-Nung; Ting, Chien-Kun; Wang, Yu-Tzu; Yang, Kuang-Yao; Tsou, Mei-Yung; Orr, Joseph A; Burk, Kyle M; Chiang, Huihua; Lin, Chun-Li",Journal of clinical monitoring and computing,430,26

Recent studies have shown that several adult SCs express pluripotency markers. Our objective was to analyze the expression of key molecules of pluripotency in human ocular surface tissues as well as in cultivated limbal epithelium. METHODS Four samples of human corneal, limbal and on amniotic membrane cultivated limbal epithelium (HLEC-AM), as well as bulbar and fornical conjunctiva were analyzed. Human embryonic stem (ES) cells and human umbilical vein endothelial cells served as controls. Expression of corneal epithelial differentiation markers (K3, K12, Cx43), putative limbal SC markers (ABCG2, p63, K15), and molecules associated with pluripotency/multipotency (NANOG, OCT4, SOX2, KLF4, KIT, NESTIN, PAX6, NOTCH1) was examined using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and immunohistochemical staining. RESULTS Limbal epithelium showed a significantly (p < 0.05) higher expression of K15, ABCG2, OCT4, SOX2, NESTIN and NOTCH1, but a lower expression of K3 than corneal epithelium. Besides a higher expression of ABCG2 in fornix, the expression of pluripotency markers was similar in both conjunctival regions, although lower than in limbal epithelium. Expression of pluripotency factors in ES cells was significantly higher than in ocular surface SCs, whereas the expression in limbal epithelium was the closest to ES cells. HLEC-AM in comparison to limbal epithelium showed a lower expression of differentiation markers, a similar expression of ABCG2 but a significantly lower expression of pluripotency factors. CONCLUSION Human ocular surface epithelial cells and especially limbal epithelial cell express genes are important for pluripotency and may have preserved some common mechanisms with pluripotent SCs.","Pauklin, Mikk; Thomasen, Henning; Pester, Anne; Steuhl, Klaus-P; Meller, Daniel",Current eye research,430,1

Data Sources A comprehensive search was performed with the following databases: Ovid MEDLINE (1947 to November 2015), EMBASE (1974 to November 2015), Cochrane Review, and PubMed (1990 to November 2015). Review Method A meta-analysis was performed according to PRISMA guidelines. Results A total of 1314 nonduplicate studies were identified in our search. Twelve articles comprising 508 cases met inclusion criteria. Overall, use of LDs was not associated with significantly lower postoperative CSF leak recurrence rates following endoscopic repair of CSF rhinorrhea (odds ratio: 0.89, 95% confidence interval: 0.40-1.95) as compared with cases performed without LDs. Subgroup analysis of only CSF leaks associated with anterior skull base resections (6 studies, 153 cases) also demonstrated that lumbar drainage did not significantly affect rates of successful repair (odds ratio: 2.67, 95% confidence interval: 0.64-11.10). Conclusions There is insufficient evidence to support that adjunctive lumbar drainage significantly reduces postoperative CSF leak recurrence in patients undergoing endoscopic CSF leak repair. Subgroup analysis examining only those patients whose CSF leaks were associated with anterior skull base resections demonstrated similar results. More level 1 and 2 studies are needed to further investigate the efficacy of LDs, particularly in the setting of patients at high risk for CSF leak recurrence.","Ahmed, Omar H; Marcus, Sonya; Tauber, Jenna R; Wang, Binhuan; Fang, Yixin; Lebowitz, Richard A",Otolaryngology--head and neck surgery : official journal of American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery,430,31

This is achieved through teaching, whereby planned strategies, based on principles of how people learn, enable learning. Despite Learning Principles being the fundamental tenets of the learning process, how HPs perceive and use Learning Principles in their practice is neglected in the healthcare literature. Objective To identify, describe and map the existing literature on nurses' and HPs' perceptions and use of Learning Principles in parent education practice. Method A scoping review was performed using the Joanna Briggs Institute approach. A comprehensive search of 10 databases and the grey literature was undertaken between March and June 2017 to identify pertinent English-language publications. The search was limited to literature published between 1998 and 2017. Following a screening and inclusion criteria eligibility check, 89 articles were selected for inclusion. Results HPs' perceptions of Learning Principles were diverse, somewhat disorganised, divergent in meaning and implicit. This was until the Dimensions of Learning construct was applied to guide the analyses and mapping. This revealed that HPs, of whom 60.7% were nurses, used Learning Principles in parent education, but only referred to them in the context of Adult Learning. Enablers to HPs using Learning Principles included shared partnerships between parents and HPs, while barriers included parents' health beliefs, psychological issues and organisational assumptions about learning. Evaluation of parents' learning also represented implicit use of Learning Principles by HPs. Conclusion This scoping review is the first to examine HPs' perceptions and use of Learning Principles within parent education practice. The findings reveal a significant gap in this body of knowledge. The paucity of studies containing any explicit descriptions of Learning Principles strongly supports the need for further exploration and codification of Learning Principles, through qualitative methods, whereby a deeper understanding of what is happening in healthcare practice can be established.","Thompson, Deryn; Leach, Matthew; Smith, Colleen; Fereday, Jennifer; May, Esther",Heliyon,430,28

METHODS A retrospective study at a dedicated Covid-19 Hospital in Mumbai, India. Data were obtained from the PregCovid Registry of pregnant and postpartum women with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection from April to September, 2020. Data were also compared with a cohort of women with MGP attending the hospital pre-pandemic (n=63). RESULTS Data from 879 women (singleton pregnancy, n=859; MGP, n=20) with Covid-19 were assessed. The twinning rate was 34.2 per 1000 births. As compared with singleton pregnancies, a higher proportion of women with MGP and Covid-19 delivered preterm (P=0.001). Spontaneous abortions were also higher in the MGP group than in the singleton group (P=0.055). The incidence of pre-eclampsia/eclampsia was higher in the Covid-19 MGP group than in both the Covid-19 singleton (41.6% vs 7.9%) and pre-pandemic MGP (50.0% vs 12.7%) groups.

Gene and lifestyle factors are considered to be the major contributors. A dietary pattern is attributed to be one of the lifestyle risk factors favoring diabetes. The present study aims to find an association between fatty acid desaturase (FADS) gene polymorphism and glycemic profile in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Methodology A total of 429 subjects were included in the study on the basis of inclusion and exclusion criteria, of which 213 and 216 subjects were diabetic and control, respectively. Body mass index was calculated. Fasting plasma glucose, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and insulin were measured using commercially available kits. rs174575 of FADS2 was selected based on previous publications and identified using the dbSNP database. To compare the biochemical parameters with the genotype, the following three models were used: additive model (CC vs CG vs GG), dominant model (CC + CG vs GG), and recessive model (CC vs CG + GG). Results and Discussion FBS, HbA1c, insulin, HOMA-IR, and HOMA-B exhibited a high and statistically significant difference between subjects and controls. The three models exhibited a statistically significant difference between FBS, HOMA-IR, and HOMA- B (p<0.05). Conclusion The distribution of rs174575 genotype differed significantly between the subjects and controls in the present study. The study revealed that genetic variation in FADS2 is an additional facet to consider while studying the risk factors of T2DM.","Shetty, Shilpa S; Suchetha, Kumari N; Harshini, Devi; Sharmila, K P; Rai, Srinidhi",African health sciences,430,28

However, the majority of women do not have optimal preconception lifestyle behaviors. This systematic review explored enablers and barriers to women's preconception lifestyle behaviors using the Capability, Opportunity, Motivation, Behaviour (COM-B) model and Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF). Preconception was defined as the time before conception, capturing planned and unplanned pregnancies. Medline Complete, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and CINAHL were searched for peer-reviewed, quantitative and qualitative primary studies (English, 2006-2020) that explored enablers and barriers to lifestyle behaviors (diet, physical activity, smoking, alcohol use, supplement intake). Forty-two studies (of 3406) were included, assessing supplement use (n = 37), diet (n = 10), smoking (n = 10), alcohol use (n = 8), and physical activity (n = 5). All three COM-B components were identified only for diet and supplement use. Of the 14 TDF domains, 7 were identified: knowledge, beliefs about capabilities, beliefs about consequences, goals, intentions, social support, and environmental context and resources. The presence/absence of knowledge on healthy behaviors was the most commonly assessed enabler/barrier. Future studies should explore a wider range of factors influencing preconception women's capability, opportunity, and motivation to modify their lifestyle behaviors.","Kandel, Pragya; Lim, Siew; Pirotta, Stephanie; Skouteris, Helen; Moran, Lisa J; Hill, Briony",Obesity reviews : an official journal of the International Association for the Study of Obesity,430,1

These nanoparticles play critical roles in many physiological processes including cell-cell signaling, immune activation, and suppression and are associated with disease states such as tumor progression. The biological functions of EMVs are highly dependent on their protein composition, which can dictate pathogenicity. Although some mechanisms have been proposed for the regulation of EMV protein trafficking, little attention has been paid to N-linked glycosylation as a potential sorting signal. Previous work from our laboratory found a conserved glycan signature for EMVs, which differed from that of the parent cell membranes, suggesting a potential role for glycosylation in EMV biogenesis. In this study, we further explore the role of glycosylation in EMV protein trafficking. We identify EMV glycoproteins and demonstrate alteration of their recruitment as a function of their glycosylation status upon pharmacological manipulation. Furthermore, we show that genetic manipulation of the glycosylation levels of a specific EMV glycoprotein, EWI-2, directly impacts its recruitment as a function of N-linked glycan sites. Taken together, our data provide strong evidence that N-linked glycosylation directs glycoprotein sorting into EMVs.","Liang, Yaxuan; Eng, William S; Colquhoun, David R; Dinglasan, Rhoel R; Graham, David R; Mahal, Lara K",The Journal of biological chemistry,430,20

Minimally invasive approaches with the help of a microscope or endoscope using hemilaminectomy have been found to be safe and effective. We report our initial experience of 18 patients using the endoscopic technique. Material and Methods A retrospective study of intradural extramedullary tumors extending up to two vertebral levels was studied. Pre- and postoperative clinical status, magnetic resonance imaging was done in all patients. The Destandau technique was used, and resection of ipsilateral lamina, medial part of the facet joint, base of the spinous process, and undercutting of the opposite lamina was performed. Dura repair was done using an endoscopic technique. Fibrin glue was used to reinforce repair in the later part of the study. Results The sagittal and axial diameter of tumor ranged from 21 to 41 mm and 12 to 18 mm, respectively. There were four cervical, two cervicothoracic, five thoracic, three thoracolumbar, and four lumbar tumors, respectively. All 18 patients improved after total excision of tumor. Average duration of surgery and blood loss was 140 minutes and 60 mL, respectively. Postoperative stay and follow-up ranged from 3 to 7 days and 9 to 24 months, respectively. Conclusion Although the study is limited by the small number of patients with a short follow-up and is a technically demanding procedure, endoscopic management of intradural extramedullary tumors was an effective and safe alternative technique to microsurgery in such patients.","Parihar, Vijay Singh; Yadav, Nishtha; Yadav, Yad Ram; Ratre, Shailendra; Bajaj, Jitin; Kher, Yatin","Journal of neurological surgery.

METHODS We performed baseline CT angiography to identify LVO in AIS. Recanalization pre- and post-intra-arterial therapy (IAT) was categorized to none, partial, and global recanalization (GR). Modified Rankin Scale score ≤2 at 3 months was considered a favorable outcome. RESULTS Among 1610 patients with AIS, 286 received IV t-PA. Of these, 55 patients with LVO were included. The median time from IV t-PA to DSA was 120 min (interquartile range, 79-152). Recanalization post-IV t-PA was observed in seven patients (12.7%). By occlusion sites, the recanalization rates were as follows: extracranial internal carotid artery 2 of 14 (14.3%); intracranial internal carotid artery 3 of 24 (12.5%); M1 of middle cerebral artery 3 of 39 (7.7%); M2 of middle cerebral artery 1 of 40 (2.5%); vertebral artery 0 of 4; and basilar artery 0 of 7.

PACT facilitates the action of RIG-I in the activation of the type I IFN response, which is suppressed by the viral nonstructural protein NS1. PACT is also known to interact with the IAV RNA polymerase subunit PA. Exactly how PACT exerts its antiviral activity during IAV infection remains to be elucidated. In the current study, we demonstrated the interplay between PACT and IAV polymerase. Induction of IFN-β by the IAV RNP complex was most robust when both RIG-I and PACT were expressed. PACT-dependent activation of IFN-β production was suppressed by the IAV polymerase subunits, polymerase acidic protein, polymerase basic protein 1 (PB1), and PB2. PACT associated with PA, PB1, and PB2. Compromising PACT in IAV-infected A549 cells resulted in the augmentation of viral RNA (vRNA) transcription and replication and IFN-β production. Furthermore, vRNA replication was boosted by knockdown of PACT in both A549 cells and IFN-deficient Vero cells. Thus, the antiviral activity of PACT is mediated primarily via its interaction with and inhibition of IAV polymerase. Taken together, our findings reveal a new facet of the host-IAV interaction in which the interplay between PACT and IAV polymerase affects the outcome of viral infection and antiviral response.-Chan, C.-P., Yuen, C.-K., Cheung, P.-H.

The original scale of the WAQ was translated into Korean and then administered to 4,242 working people from a broad range of economic sectors. The nation-wide sample was a representative one from the 17th wave Korean Labor and Income Panel Study in 2014. The main body comprises two steps. First, through an exploratory factor analysis (EFA) as well as a reliability analysis, along with content validity examination among experts, thirteen items from the original WAQ were eliminated. The EFA yielded a four-factor solution with four items established in compulsive dependency (CD), four in illusion of control (IC), four in endurance of conflicts (EC), and four in withdrawal symptoms (WS). This process provided a succinct and convenient measure of workaholism, the KOWS with 16 items. The reliability coefficient (α) of the new scale was .90, and the split-half reliability coefficient was .72. Secondly, confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was performed by way of structural equation modeling to validate the new construct. This KOWS showed adequate convergent validity (AVE > .5), construct reliability (CR > .7), as well as discriminant validity (AVE > ρ2). Between four subscales of the KOWS and affective commitment (AC) to organizations there proved meager correlation. In conclusion, the KOWS with 16-item psychometric properties is a valid and reliable tool to measure workaholism in South Korea.","Kang, Sudol",Psychological reports,430,8

METHODS Data collection was prospective for LHJ cases from 2009 and retrospective for OHJ cases from 2003 to 2008. Data were compared with respect to HHDS. HHDS was incised longitudinally as required during hilar hepatic ductoplasty. RESULTS Fifty-eight subjects were studied (LHJ: n = 27, 4 boys, 23 girls; OHJ: n = 31; 6 boys, 25 girls). HHDS was present in 10 LHJ cases and 10 OHJ cases. Todani classification of choledochal cyst in LHJ patients was type 1A (n = 16) and type 4A (n = 11), and in OHJ patients, it was type 1A (n = 19) and type 4A (n = 12). There were significant differences between LHJ and OHJ with regard to mean operative time (386 vs 341 min), mean blood loss (5.9 vs 18.4 mL), recommencement of enteral feeding (3.9 vs 6.4 days), and hospital stay (11.7 vs 15.5 days) (all P < 0.05). Hepatic ductoplasty was performed in 23 LHJ patients and in 21 OHJ patients. There were no intraoperative complications and no conversions to OHJ. There were no significant differences between LHJ and OHJ, regardless of the presence of HHDS, for postoperative complications, which included minor bile leakage, anastomotic stricture, and intestinal obstruction. CONCLUSION LHJ is as effective as OHJ for the treatment of choledochal cysts irrespective of the presence of HHDS and the need for hepatic ductoplasty.","Miyano, Go; Koyama, Mariko; Miyake, Hiromu; Kaneshiro, Masakatsu; Morita, Keiichi; Nakajima, Hideaki; Yamoto, Masaya; Nouso, Hiroshi; Fukumoto, Koji; Urushihara, Naoto",Asian journal of endoscopic surgery,430,20

Predictors of perceived family impact were severity of the child's illness, total days of all admissions, and coping, accounting for 37% of the observed variance. CONCLUSIONS Families were moderately affected by children's hospitalizations; social functioning was most affected. Families' perceived coping effectiveness decreased as the readmissions increased. The higher risk category a child's diagnosis is, the longer a child's hospitalization is, and the less perceived coping effectiveness, the higher family perceived impact. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE The findings provide a direction for the development of family-centered supportive intervention programs. Nurses should be aware that the total days of admission and severity of a child's illness are significant factors associated with perceived family impact and likely justify special attention. Family coping enhancement interventions could alleviate perceived family impact.","Lyu, Qi-Yuan; Wong, Frances K Y; You, Li-Ming; Li, Xian-Wen",Cancer nursing,430,20

Using low temperature piezoresponse force microscopy, we revealed coexistence of piezoelectric and non-piezoelectric phases in CuInP2Se6, forming unusual domain walls with enhanced piezoelectric response. From systematic imaging experiments we have inferred the formation of a partially polarized antiferroelectric state, with inclusions of structurally distinct ferrielectric domains enclosed by the corresponding phase boundaries. The assignment is strongly supported by optical spectroscopies and density-functional-theory calculations. Enhanced piezoresponse at the ferrielectric/antiferroelectric phase boundary and the ability to manipulate this entity with electric field on the nanoscale expand the existing phenomenology of functional domain walls. At the same time, phase-coexistence in chalcogenophosphates may lead to rational strategies for incorporation of ferroic functionality into van der Waals heterostructures, with stronger resilience toward detrimental size-effects.","Dziaugys, Andrius; Kelley, Kyle; Brehm, John A; Tao, Lei; Puretzky, Alexander; Feng, Tianli; O'Hara, Andrew; Neumayer, Sabine; Chyasnavichyus, Marius; Eliseev, Eugene A; Banys, Juras; Vysochanskii, Yulian; Ye, Feng; Chakoumakos, Bryan C; Susner, Michael A; McGuire, Michael A; Kalinin, Sergei V; Ganesh, Panchapakesan; Balke, Nina; Pantelides, Sokrates T; Morozovska, Anna N; Maksymovych, Petro",Nature communications,430,11

Materials and Method Prospective study conducted in Amrita institute of medical sciences, Kochi, Kerala. Women planned for elective and scheduled caesarean section were included in the study from September 2020 to October 2020 and compared with women who underwent caesarean section in the same period receiving standard perioperative care. Women who underwent emergency and urgent caesarean section and patients with medical or surgical comorbidities were excluded. Surgical procedure was the same in both arms. Intravenous hydration was goal directed. Oral feeding was started with liquids after 2 hours, solids were given after 4 hours. Intravenous paracetamol and diclofenac were given routinely. Intravenous tramadol and fentanyl were given if needed apart from these analgesics. Foleys catheter was removed after 12 hours. Conventional care group observed 6 h of fasting pre- and post-operatively. Catheter was retained for 24 h, 2500 ml IV fluids were infused on the first day followed by 1000 ml on the second day. The duration of hospital stay was based on clinical criteria and care providers decision. Results In ERAS arm, post-operative hospital stay was significantly reduced in comparison with conventional care group. (53.91 vs 77.71 h-p = 0.00) Early feeding, early ambulation, early catheter removal, multimodal and preemptive analgesia all contributed to early recovery of the patient. Conclusion In ERAS pathway length of post-operative stay was significantly reduced as compared to conventional care.

This study aims to investigate the frequency, treatment, and complications of external ear canal injury in association with mandibular and temporal bone trauma. STUDY DESIGN Retrospective chart review. METHODS Computed tomography images with mandibular or temporal bone trauma were reviewed for EAC fractures. Patient data were collected from initial presentation and subsequent follow-up clinic visits. RESULTS Thirty-nine percent of temporal bone fractures and 3.3% of mandible trauma involved the EAC. In particular, 10% of condylar or subcondylar trauma included an EAC fracture (P = 0.0006). One patient sustained bilateral EAC fractures despite an isolated, unilateral condylar fracture. The most common presenting sign was blood in the external auditory canal. Two patients underwent exam under anesthesia and removal of debris and stenting as treatment, whereas 42% of the patients were placed on otic drops and 5% received packing or a stent. Follow-up data were only available for 16% of the patients. Hearing loss from otic capsule involvement or ossicular chain disruption were follow-up complaints, and one patient had persistent canal stenosis. CONCLUSIONS External auditory canal trauma is present in a significant proportion of mandibular and temporal bone trauma, including both condylar and noncondylar fractures with a higher incidence of condylar fractures. One case was seen with bilateral EAC fractures despite a unilateral mandibular fracture. Complications of these fractures can include hearing loss and canal stenosis; however, additional outpatient follow-up is needed to further elucidate long-term complications and shape treatment recommendations.","Burchhardt, Daniela M; David, John; Eckert, Robert; Robinette, Natasha L; Carron, Michael A; Zuliani, Giancarlo F",The Laryngoscope,430,1

However, there are often limited educational opportunities for medical doctors to achieve professional development in the field of psychiatry. Simulation training in psychiatry may be a useful tool to foster this development. OBJECTIVES To assess the effectiveness of simulation training in psychiatry for medical students, post-graduate trainees, and medical doctors. METHODS For this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched 8 electronic databases and trial registries up to August 31, 2018. We manually searched key journals and the reference lists of selected studies. We included randomised and non-randomised controlled studies and single group prepost-test studies. Our main outcomes were based on Kirkpatrick levels. We included data only from Randomised Controlled Trials (RCTs) using random-effects models. RESULTS From 46 571 studies identified, we selected 163 studies and combined 27 RCTs. Interventions included simulation by role-play (n=69), simulated patients (n=72), virtual reality (n=22), manikin (n=5) and voice simulation (n=2). Meta-analysis found significant differences at immediate post-test for simulation compared with active and inactive controls on attitudes (SMD=0.52 (95%CI [0.31; 0.73]; I2 = 0%) and 0.28 (95%CI [0.04; 0.53]; I2 = 52%), respectively); on skills (SMD=1.37 (95%CI [0.56; 2.18]; I2 =93%) and 1.49 (95%CI [0.39; 2.58]; I2 = 93%), respectively); on knowledge (SMD=1.22 (95%CI [0.57; 1.88]; I2 = 0%) and 0.72 (95%CI [0.14; 1.30]; I2 = 80%), respectively); and on behaviours (SMD= 1.07 (95%CI [0.49; 1.65]; I2 =68%) and 0.45 (95%CI [0.11; 0.79; I2 =41%), respectively. Significant differences were found at three-month follow-up for patient benefit and doctors' behaviours and skills.

This is especially true for the robotic approach and is one of the main reasons that has prevented its wider acceptance among hospitals and surgeons. The aim of our study was to evaluate the clinical outcomes and economic impact of robotic and open liver surgery in a single institution. METHODS Sixty-eight robotic and 55 open hepatectomies were performed at our institution between January 1, 2009 and December 31, 2013. Demographics, perioperative data, and postoperative outcomes were collected and compared between the two groups. An independent company performed the financial analysis. The economic parameters comprised direct variable costs, direct fixed costs, and indirect costs. RESULTS Mean estimated blood loss was significantly less in the robotic group (438 versus 727.8 mL; P = .038). Overall morbidity was significantly lower in the robotic group (22% versus 40%; P = .047). Clavien III/IV complications were also lower, with 4.4% in the robotic versus 16.3% in the open group (P = .043). The length of stay in the intensive care unit (ICU) was shorter for patients who underwent a robotic procedure (2.1 versus 3.3 days; P = .004). The average total cost, including readmissions, was $37,518 for robotic surgery and $41,948 for open technique. CONCLUSIONS Robotic liver resections had less overall morbidity, ICU, and hospital stay. This translates into decreased average costs for robotic surgery. These procedures are financially comparable to open resections and do not represent a financial burden to the hospital.","Daskalaki, Despoina; Gonzalez-Heredia, Raquel; Brown, Marc; Bianco, Francesco M; Tzvetanov, Ivo; Davis, Myriam; Kim, Jihun; Benedetti, Enrico; Giulianotti, Pier C",Journal of laparoendoscopic & advanced surgical techniques.

There have been anecdotal cases of very late-onset (VLO)-NMOSD, but case series reports are rare. The aim of this retrospective study was to clarify the clinical features of VLO-NMOSD. METHODS According to the age at onset, we classified patients with NMOSD into three subgroups: ≤ 49 years, early-onset NMOSD (EO-NMOSD); 50-69 years, late-onset NMOSD (LO-NMOSD); and ≥ 70 years, VLO-NMOSD. We evaluated the clinical characteristics, MRI findings, laboratory data, and immunotherapies of the groups. RESULTS Overall, 12 men and 64 women with a median (interquartile range) age at onset and duration of disease of 42.0 (29.0-55.8) years and 70.0 (16.3-143.0) months, respectively, were included. Eight (11%) patients had VLO-NMOSD, 22 (29%) had LO-NMOSD, and 46 (61%) had EO-NMOSD. Patients with EO-NMOSD had a significantly longer interval between episodes as well as time between the first symptom and diagnosis of NMOSD than did those with VLO-NMOSD and LO-NMOSD (p=0.046). Optic neuritis and nerve lesions on MRI were significantly less frequent in patients with VLO-NMOSD than in those with LO-NMOSD and EO-NMOSD (p=0.002 and p=0.028, respectively). In contrast, patients with VLO-NMOSD had higher nadir expanded disability status scale and Nurick scale scores and a significantly longer spinal lesion length than did those with LO-NMOSD and EO-NMOSD (p=0.029, p=0.049, and p=0.032, respectively). CONCLUSIONS Patients with VLO-NMOSD tend to develop severe myelitis with long cord lesions but not optic neuritis.","Nakahara, Keiichi; Nakane, Shunya; Nagaishi, Akiko; Narita, Tomoko; Matsuo, Hidenori; Ando, Yukio",European journal of neurology,430,29

METHODS In a cross-sectional survey, data were collected by sending a questionnaire to 2000 patients with a demyelinating disease through an online portal system. Collected data included the current MS DMT and patient-reported disability level, history of recent sick contact, recent fever, respiratory symptoms, diagnosis with COVID-19, and the disposition after the diagnosis. We defined a COVID-19-suspect group as patients having fever and cough or fever and shortness of breath, or a presumptive diagnosis based on suggestive chest computed tomography. We calculated the proportion of COVID-19-suspect patients and compared their demographics, clinical characteristics, and DMT categories with the rest of survey-responders, using univariable and multivariable models. RESULTS Out of 712 patients, 34 (4.8%) fulfilled our criteria for being in the COVID-19-suspect group. Only two patients required hospitalization. No patient required intensive care. In a multivariable model, disease duration (p-value=0.017), DMT category (p-value=0.030), and history of sick contact (p-values<0.001) were associated with the risk of being in the COVID-19-suspect group. Being on B-cell depleting antibodies (as compared to non-cell depleting, non-cell trafficking inhibitor DMTs) was associated with a 2.6-fold increase in the risk of being in the COVID-19-suspect group. (RR: 3.55, 95%CI: 1.45, 8.68, p-value=0.005). CONCLUSIONS The course of infection in patients with MS suspected of having COVID-19 was mild to moderate, and all patients had a full recovery.

Although reports of gastric remnant necrosis after gastrectomy have been rare, mortality rates remain substantially high when present. A double elementary diet (W-ED) tube, which can be used for both enteral feeding and gastrointestinal tract decompression, has been developed for anastomotic leakage and postoperative nutritional management after upper gastrointestinal surgery. The current report presents a case of gastric remnant necrosis after proximal gastrectomy that was successfully managed through conservative treatment with a W-ED tube. CASE PRESENTATION A 73-year-old male was referred to our hospital for an additional resection after endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) for gastric cancer. Endoscopic findings showed an ESD scar on the posterior wall of the upper portion of the stomach, while computed tomography (CT) showed no obvious regional lymph node enlargement and distant metastases. The patient subsequently underwent laparoscopic proximal gastrectomy and esophagogastrostomy but developed candidemia on postoperative day 7. On postoperative day 14, endoscopy revealed gastric ischemic changes around the anastomotic site, suggesting that the patient's candidemia developed due to gastric necrosis. His vital signs remained normal, while the gastric remnant ischemia was localized. Given that surgery in the presence of candidemia was considered extremely risky, conservative treatment was elected. A W-ED tube was placed nasally, after which enteral feeding was initiated along with gastrointestinal tract decompression. Although the patient subsequently developed anastomotic leakage due to gastric remnant necrosis, local control was achieved and conservative treatment was continued. On postoperative day 52, healing of the gastric remnant necrosis and anastomotic leakage was confirmed, after which the patient started drinking water. Although balloon dilation was required due to anastomotic stenosis, the patient was able to resume oral intake and was discharged on postoperative day 88. CONCLUSIONS Herein, we present our experience with a case of gastric remnant necrosis after proximal gastrectomy, wherein conservative management was achieved using a W-ED tube. In cases involving high operative risk, the management should be mindful of gastric remnant necrosis as a post-gastrectomy complication.","Gakuhara, Atsushi; Fukuda, Shuichi; Tsujimoto, Tomoyuki; Tomihara, Hideo; Ohta, Katsuya; Kitani, Kotaro; Hashimoto, Kazuhiko; Ishikawa, Hajime; Hida, Jin-Ichi; Yukawa, Masao",Surgical case reports,430,7

Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is a major surrogate of kidney function. The Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) Equation is a tool to estimate GFR. This protocol outlines a systematic-review, assessing the diagnostic accuracy of the CKD-EPI equation in adults with diabetes. METHODS AND ANALYSIS MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and grey literature will be searched for publications in English, Farsi, Dutch and Chinese from 2009 (when CKD-EPI was first introduced) to January 2019. Bridging searches will be conducted to capture literature published from January 2019 until final review publication. The inclusion criteria will be (1) study participants with diabetes; (2) age ≥18 years; (3) creatinine-based CKD-EPI eGFR as index test; (4) measured GFR using the clearance/plasma disappearance of inulin, iohexol, iothalamate, diethylenetriamine-pentaacetic acid (DTPA) or chromium labelled ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (Cr-EDTA) as reference test; (5) report of the diagnostic accuracy of the index test. Exclusion criteria will be participants with renal transplant, chronic use of corticosteroids, chronic inflammatory diseases, pregnancy, non-diabetes related kidney disease, thalassaemia, heart failure, pregnancy and potential kidney donors as well as critically ill patients. Screening, eligibility check, risk of bias assessment and data extraction will be carried out by two independent reviewers. Any discrepancies will be discussed, and third-party opinion will be sought. The risk of bias will be assessed using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 tool. A quantitative synthesis of the aggregated-data will be used if the included studies are homogenous. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION No ethics approval is required. The outcome will be published in a peer-reviewed journal.

METHODS All 25 children with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time reverse transcription-PCR (RNA-PCR) were admitted from the 4 designated treatment hospitals of 2019-nCoV in Chongqing from January 19 to March 12, 2020. Clinical data and epidemiological history of these patients were retrospectively collected and analyzed. RESULTS The diagnosis was confirmed through RNA-PCR testing. Among the 25 cases, 14 were males and 11 were females. The median age was 11.0 (6.3-14.5) years (range 0.6-17.0 years). All children were related to a family cluster outbreak, and 7 children (28%) with a travel or residence history in Hubei Province. These patients could be categorized into different clinical types, including 8 (32%) asymptomatic, 4 (16%) very mild cases and 13 (52%) common cases. No severe or critical cases were identified. The most common symptoms were cough (13 cases, 52%) and fever (6 cases, 24%). The duration time of clinical symptoms was 13.0 (8.0-25.0) days. In the 25 cases, on admission, 21 cases (84%) had normal white blood cell counts, while only 2 cases (8%) more than 10 × 10/L and 2 cases (8%) less than 4 × 10/L, respectively; 22 cases(88%) had normal CD4+ T lymphocyte counts, while in the remaining 3 cases(8%) this increased mildly; 23 cases had normal CD8+ T lymphocyte counts, while in the remaining 2 cases (8%) CD8+ T lymphocyte counts were mildly increased as well. All Lymphocyte counts were normal. There were no statistical differences of lab results between the groups of asymptomatic cases, mild cases and common cases. There were only 13 cases with abnormal CT imaging, most of which were located in the subpleural area of the bottom of the lung. All patients were treated with interferon, 6 cases combined with Ribavirin, and 12 cases combined with lopinavir or ritonavir. The days from onset to RNA turning negative was 15.20 ± 6.54 days. There was no significant difference of RNA turning negative between the groups of interferon, interferon plus ribavirin and interferon plus lopinavir or ritonavir treatment. All the cases recovered and were discharged from hospital. CONCLUSIONS The morbidity of 2019-nCoV infection in children is lower than in adults and the clinical manifestations and inflammatory biomarkers in children are nonspecific and milder than that in adults. RNA-PCR test is still the most reliable diagnostic method, especially for asymptomatic patients.","Bai, Ke; Liu, Wenjun; Liu, Chengjun; Fu, Yueqiang; Hu, Jun; Qin, Yanran; Zhang, Qiaoying; Chen, Hongyan; Xu, Feng; Li, Changda",The Pediatric infectious disease journal,430,7

This study aims to characterize the diagnostic outcome of HREM in a large cohort of consecutive patients in Mexico.This study was conducted in Monterrey, Mexico from March 1, 2013 to March 31, 2015. Our diverse study population included patients from a major academic institution and the community. HREM was done applying the Chicago Classification 3. Diagnostic outcome was grouped as weak peristaltic disorders, gastroesophageal junction disorders, and hypertensive/uncoordinated peristalsis.We studied 670 consecutive patients, 57% were women, mean age was 43.8 years. The majority (465 [69%]) were referred for preoperative evaluation of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), 365 (78%) of whom had a normal study. Overall, 193 (29%) patients had abnormal motility, the most common disorder being weak peristalsis (104 [54%]).

The purpose of this network meta-analysis (NMA) is to assess the efficacy on pain and function of the drugs that are most widely prescribed against knee OA. METHODS Medline, Scopus, and Cochrane database of systematic reviews were searched for randomized controlled trials published up to August 2019 and assessing the efficacy of knee OA treatments using a 6-month time horizon. Pain and function changes from baseline were the primary outcomes. A Bayesian network meta-analysis was run and standardized mean differences (SMDs) with 95% credibility intervals (95% CrIs) were calculated. RESULTS 9697 references were identified and 80 RCTs were concordant with our inclusion criteria (79 studies involving 15,609 individuals reported pain outcomes and 55 studies involving 13,655 individuals reported function outcomes). A significant decrease in pain was observed for the intra-articular (IA) combination of hyaluronic acid (HA) and triamcinolone (SMD - 0.49, 95% CrI - 0.78; - 0.19), vitamin D (SMD - 0.31, 95% CrI - 0.56; - 0.06), IA HA (SMD - 0.29, 95% CrI - 0.40; - 0.17), prescription-grade crystalline glucosamine sulfate (pCGS) (SMD - 0.29, 95% CrI - 0.58; - 0.004), and prescription-grade chondroitin sulfate (pCS) (SMD - 0.26, 95% CrI - 0.44; - 0.08). Significant improvements in physical function were found with pCGS (SMD - 0.44, 95% CrI - 0.66; - 0.21), vitamin D (SMD - 0.30, 95% CrIs - 0.49; - 0.11) and IA HA (SMD - 0.21, 95% CrIs - 0.31; - 0.11). CONCLUSION Six months of treatment with IA HA, pCGS, pCS, vitamin D and the combination of IA HA and triamcinolone improve pain and/or physical function in patients suffering from knee OA.","Beaudart, C; Lengelé, L; Leclercq, V; Geerinck, A; Sanchez-Rodriguez, D; Bruyère, O; Reginster, J Y",Drugs,430,14

A large proportion of travelers to tropical regions are not protected against vaccine-preventable illnesses, and a majority of these travelers demonstrate poor recall of actual vaccination status. Here we characterize self-perceived vaccination status among a large sample of ecotourists at the Sepilok Orangutan Rehabilitation Centre, Sabah, Malaysia. Despite their recognized travel itinerary to view endangered animals, tourists at wildlife sanctuaries are not adequately protected against vaccine-preventable illnesses. Of 633 surveys, over half reported being currently vaccinated against tuberculosis, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, polio, and measles. Fewer participants reported current vaccination status for influenza, rabies, and chickenpox. Despite the fact that the majority of visitors to Sepilok are from temperate regions where influenza is relatively more prevalent, 67.1% of those surveyed with medical-related occupations reported not being currently vaccinated for influenza. Ecotourists concerned about environmental protection are themselves largely unaware of their potential contribution to the spread of diseases to animals. The risks of negatively affecting animal populations must be communicated to all concerned parties, and this may begin by urging travelers to examine their actual vaccination status, particularly as the ecotourism industry continues its rapid expansion, and is seen increasingly as a possible tool to save great ape populations from extinction.","Muehlenbein, Michael P; Martinez, Leigh Ann; Lemke, Andrea A; Ambu, Laurentius; Nathan, Senthilvel; Alsisto, Sylvia; Andau, Patrick; Sakong, Rosman",EcoHealth,430,1

SFKs are anchored to the plasma membrane, Golgi membranes and lysosomal membranes through lipid modifications. Although the functions of SFKs being localized to the plasma membrane are intensively studied, those of SFKs being localized to organelle membranes are poorly understood. Here, we show that, among SFKs, c-Src in particular is involved in a decrease in the amount of LC3-II. c-Src and non-palmitoylated Lyn [Lyn(C3S) (cysteine-3 → serine-3)], which are localized onto lysosomes, decrease the amount of LC3-II and treatment with SFK inhibitors increases the amount of LC3-II, suggesting the importance of SFKs' lysosomal localization for a change of autophagic flux in a kinase activity-dependent manner. Colocalization of LC3-II with the lysosome-associated membrane protein LAMP1 shows that lysosome-localized SFKs promote the fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes. Lysosome-localized SFKs play a positive role in the maintenance of cell viability under starvation conditions, which is further supported by knockdown of c-Src. Therefore, our results suggest that autophagosome-lysosome fusion is promoted by lysosome-localized c-Src, leading to cell survival under starvation conditions.","Suzuki, Ko; Honda, Takuya; Akatsu, Aki; Yamaguchi, Noritaka; Yamaguchi, Naoto",Cellular signalling,430,16

Materials and Methods We retrospectively collected charts of all patients who underwent LESS procedures in our department from January 2013 to December 2016. Data included demographic characteristics, type of procedures, intraoperative details, hospital stay, and complications. The umbilicus was used as the surgical site in all cases. All procedures were performed with a homemade glove port and standard straight 3- or 5-mm laparoscopic instruments. Results Seventy-three patients (55 males, 18 females) were identifed. Procedures included 46 orchidop-exies, 21 pyeloplasties, 8 varicocelectomies, 3 nephrecto-mies, 3 nephroureterectomies, 3 orchiectomies, and 1 renal hydatid cyst treatment. Median operative time for the entire cohort was 47 min (range 26-156 min). There was no signifcant intraoperative blood loss. No conversion to conventional laparoscopy or open surgery was needed. All patients required paracetamol postoperatively. The mean follow-up was 18 months. Two patients had testicular atrophy after a Fowler-Stephens procedure and 1 patient had testicular reascension. Cosmetic results were excellent. Forty-five (62.5%) patients were discharged on the day of surgery. Conclusion Our study demonstrated that LESS surgery using our glove port technique and conventional laparoscopic instruments is a feasible and safe technique for the surgical management of various pediatric urological conditions.","Zouari, Mohamed; Ben Dhaou, Mahdi; Ammar, Saloua; Jallouli, Mohamed; Mhiri, Riadh",Current urology,430,30

METHODS Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses for Scoping Review (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines were followed. Eight databases were searched. Studies were independently screened and analyzed by two reviewers. Publications were included if pediatric hearing-impaired individuals and social isolation or loneliness were studied. Discrepancies were resolved by a team of five reviewers. RESULTS Thirty-three studies were included in this review. Sixty percent of studies (12/20) found that hearing loss was related to loneliness and 64.7% found that children with hearing loss experienced more social isolation (11/17). The Asher Loneliness and Dissatisfaction Questionnaire was commonly used to assess loneliness. No commonly used tool for assessing social isolation was found. Six articles found that school type was not associated with loneliness. Difficulty communicating was the most mentioned factor leading to loneliness and social isolation. Frequent recommendations to improve social integration included facilitating interactions with the hearing-impaired and educating the nonhearing-impaired to normalize the disability. CONCLUSION The majority of studies found that hearing impairment results in a higher prevalence of social isolation and loneliness. However, an association cannot be definitively claimed due to the lack of uniform assessment tools. This review emphasizes the need for standardized methods to assess loneliness and social isolation and highlights methods to improve social integration for the hearing impaired.

In this study, we evaluated the effects of different herbal extract nanoformulations (NFs) [mint (MENFs), thyme (TENFs), and curcumin (CENFs)], supplemented at either 50 or 100 μg into Tris-extender on the cryopreserved goat semen quality. The hydrothermal squeezing method was used for the preparation of the NFs extracts. The morphological evaluation of the NFs extracts was conducted by transmission electron microscopy. All NFs supplements improved (p < 0.05) the progressive motility, vitality, and plasma membrane integrity of sperm compared with the control extender after equilibration (5 °C for 2 h) and thawing (37 °C for 30 s), but had no effect on sperm abnormality and acrosome integrity. All NFs supplements decreased (p < 0.05) the apoptosis, malondialdehyde level, and chromatin decondensation of sperm cells, while increased (p < 0.05) the total antioxidant capacity and catalase activity in the frozen/thawed extender. Particularly, CENFs at a level of 100 μg showed improvement of sperm parameters and antioxidant status during cryopreservation of goat semen more than TENFs and MENFs. The CENFs improved the quality of goat spermatozoa in post-thawed semen in terms of preventing cryodamage and promoting the cryotolerance of spermatozoa when compared with TENFs and MENFs. Therefore, supplementation of Tris-extender with CENFs could enhance goat semen processing during cryopreservation.","Ismail, Aya A; Abdel-Khalek, Abdel-Khalek E; Khalil, Wael A; Yousif, Ahmed I; Saadeldin, Islam M; Alshammari, Ghedeir M; El-Harairy, Mostafa A",Cryobiology,430,1

Hence, transmission dynamics of influenza A/H1N1 were determined across space and time in Thailand. METHODS Dates of symptom onset were obtained for all daily laboratory-confirmed cases of influenza A/H1N1pdm in Thailand from 3 May 2009 to 26 December 2010 for four different geographic regions (Central, North, North-East, and South). These data were analysed using a probabilistic epidemic reconstruction, and estimates of the effective reproduction number, R(t), were derived by region and over time. RESULTS Estimated R(t) values for the first wave peaked at 1.54 (95% CI: 1.42-1.71) in the Central region and 1.64 (95% CI: 1.38-1.92) in the North, whilst the corresponding values in the North-East and the South were 1.30 (95% CI: 1.17-1.46) and 1.39 (95% CI: 1.32-1.45) respectively. As the R(t) in the Central region fell below one, the value of R(t) in the rest of Thailand increased above one. R(t) was above one for 30 days continuously through the first wave in all regions of Thailand. During the second wave R(t) was only marginally above one in all regions except the South. CONCLUSIONS In Thailand, the value of R(t) varied by region in the two pandemic waves. Higher R(t) estimates were found in Central and Northern regions in the first wave. Knowledge of regional variation in transmission potential is needed for predicting the course of future pandemics and for analysing the potential impact of control measures.","Meeyai, Aronrag; Cooper, Ben; Coker, Richard; Pan-Ngum, Wirichada; Akarasewi, Pasakorn; Iamsirithaworn, Sopon",WHO South-East Asia journal of public health,430,24

Vascular endothelial growth factor is of significant interest for targeted therapy in R/M HNSCC because of its central role in tumorigenesis and immunosuppression. Axitinib is a potent inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) 1 , VEGFR2, VEGFR3, platelet-derived growth factor receptor, as well as c-kit and offers such an approach. METHODS This article reports the results of a phase 2 trial evaluating axitinib in R/M HNSCC according to the Choi criteria for radiographic response assessment. The primary endpoint of this trial was 6-month overall survival. RESULTS Twenty-nine patients were enrolled, and 28 were evaluable for a response. Patients were heavily pretreated with 61% having had at least 1 previous systemic treatment in the metastatic setting (range, 0-5). The median overall survival of 9.8 months and the 6-month overall survival rate of 70% met the protocol-defined criteria for clinical efficacy. The best overall response rate was 42%. Correlative analyses demonstrated that PI3K signaling pathway alterations were associated with an increased response to therapy (75% vs 17%). A marked response to therapy was seen in a subgroup of patients who were treated with an immune checkpoint inhibitor after progression on axitinib. CONCLUSIONS Treatment with axitinib is associated with improved survival in patients with heavily pretreated head and neck cancer, and PI3K pathway alterations may serve as a biomarker for response. Further investigation is warranted to evaluate axitinib in biomarker-selected populations, especially in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. LAY SUMMARY Metastatic head and neck squamous cancer is an incurable disease with limited treatment options and a poor prognosis. This study is the first to demonstrate that the targeted oral drug axitinib improves survival in patients with heavily pretreated metastatic head and neck cancer.

However, ARFID remains poorly known by most pediatricians, but also by psychiatrists and primary care professionals. Despite the fact that patients with ARFID generally have a higher BMI than patients with anorexia nervosa, our purpose was to highlight the fact that they may present severe nutritional deficiencies and major somatic complications when the diagnosis is delayed. METHOD We describe here a case of a 16-year-old boy who presented with severe undernutrition (BMI = 11.5) leading to Ogilvie's syndrome, which resolved with enteral refeeding. Because of undernutrition, very bad dental condition, and encopresis, some physicians wrongly suspected child neglect, but retrospective analysis of his personal history revealed a long-term FED and sensory specificities that led to the final diagnosis of an ARFID-autism spectrum disorder (ASD) association. A literature review was conducted on the ARFID somatic complications. CONCLUSION The training of health professionals in the clinical forms of pediatric FED, including ARFID, is necessary, to promote early diagnosis and prevent poor nutritional outcomes. In this case the association of ARFID-ASD and the delay in access to specialized care favored by the disadvantaged social environment led to severe gastrointestinal complications.

The purpose of this prospective study is to examine the effect of shared buccal mucosal grafts for simultaneous repair of severe upper and lower eyelid cicatricial entropion on eyelid position. METHODS Patients at the University of Texas-Southwestern Medical Center Aston Ophthalmology clinic were identified who were diagnosed with cicatricial entropion. Patients found to have severe upper and lower eyelid cicatricial entropion were included in the study if they had undergone or were scheduled to undergo simultaneous upper and lower eyelid repair through the use of a shared mucosal graft. Pre-operative exams which included pre-operative photos and description of eyelid position were performed. Shared mucosal graft surgery was performed. At post-operative week 1, the patients had splitting of their shared mucosal grafts. Post-operative photos as well as post-operative description of eyelid position were made at 6 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months. RESULTS At 6 months after surgical repair of severe upper and lower eyelid cicatricial entropion by shared mucosal grafts, patients were found to have resolution of entropic eyelid position as well improvement in ocular surface irritation. No adverse events were found and no graft failures occurred. CONCLUSIONS The use of a shared mucosal graft for the repair of severe upper and lower eyelid entropion, when sufficient tarsal structural support is present, is effective for the correction of eyelid malpositions and ocular surface irritation.","Kerr, Trevor; Mancini, Ronald",Orbit,430,28

If it presents within 6 weeks to 9 months after therapy, it is called acute radiation proctitis/proctopathy (ARP), and if it occurs 9 months to a year after treatment, it is classified as chronic radiation proctitis/proctopathy (CRP). CRP occurs in 5%-20% of patients receiving pelvic radiation, depending on the radiation dose and the presence or absence of chemotherapy. In many cases, CRP resolves spontaneously, but in some, it can lead to persistent rectal bleeding. Other symptoms of CRP include diarrhea, mucoid discharge, urgency, tenesmus, rectal pain, and fecal incontinence. Despite the availability of several therapies, many patients fail to respond, and continue to suffer in their quality of life. Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is a newer endoscopic technique that uses radiofrequency energy to ablate tissue. This is an emerging way to treat radiation proctopathy and other mucosal telangiectasia. We present three cases of radiation proctopathy treated with RFA at our institute and review the literature on treatment modalities for CRP. We were also able to find 16 other cases of CRP that used RFA, and review their literature as well as literature on other treatment modalities.","Patel, Anish; Pathak, Rahul; Deshpande, Vrushak; Patel, Sunil H; Wickremesinghe, Prasanna C; Vadada, Deepak",Clinical and experimental gastroenterology,430,28

Several radiology departments have begun to create diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) committees to systematically address DEI issues in radiology. However, there are few articles that provide departments with guidance on how to create DEI committees to comprehensively address DEI issues in radiology. The purpose of this review is to provide readers with a framework and practical tips for creating a comprehensive, institutionally aligned radiology DEI committee. METHODS The authors describe key components of the strategic planning process and lessons learned in the creation of a radiology DEI committee, on the basis of the experience of an integrated, academic northeastern radiology department. RESULTS A hospital-based strategic planning process defining the DEI vision, mission, goals, and strategies was used to inform the formation of the radiology department DEI committee. The radiology department performed gap analyses by conducting internal and external research. Strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats analyses were performed on the basis of consultations with institutional and other departmental DEI leaders as well as DEI leaders from other academic medical centers. This framework served as the basis for the creation of the radiology departmental DEI committee, including a steering committee and four task forces (education, research, patient experience, and workforce development), each charged with addressing specific institutional goals and strategies. CONCLUSIONS This review provides academic radiology departments with a blueprint to create a comprehensive, institutionally aligned radiology DEI committee.","Narayan, Anand K; Schaefer, Pamela W; Daye, Dania; Alvarez, Carmen; Chonde, Daniel B; McLoud, Theresa C; Flores, Efren J; Brink, James A",Journal of the American College of Radiology : JACR,430,31

We describe here our approach to these demanding cases through a combined retro-rectus mesh placement and components separation and their overall functional outcome. METHODS A retrospective analysis of a prospectively collected data was carried out and 28 patients who underwent giant (≥15 cm) midline incisional hernia reconstruction were identified in a large district general hospital between 2007 and 2013 with a median follow-up of 34 (6-76) months. RESULTS Demographic data of our series include age of 60 (median) (30-87) years with a M:F ratio of 12:16, length of symptomatic hernia 18 (median) (12-36) months, more than two previous laparotomies (15), bowel obstructive symptoms (7) and recurrent herniation (7). BMI recorded was 32 (median) (24-46) and ASA of II (median) (I-III). Co-morbidities included cardiac disease (6), diabetes (6), respiratory disease (4) and systemic immunocompromise (2). Operative and technical details showed operative duration to be 180 (median) min, cranio-caudal rectus sheath defect 21 (median) cm, transverse rectus sheath defect 15 (median) cm, cross-sectional area of fascial defect 300 (median) cm(2) and size of mesh 690 (median) cm(2). Seven (25 %) developed short-term post operative complications: grade I seromata all resolving spontaneously (5); grade II superficial wound infections (2).

We aimed to evaluate the effect of amino acids (AAs) on expression of IGF1 and IGF1-dependent genes in human myotubes and skeletal muscle and supposed that AAs administration increases IGF1 levels in blood and expression of IGF1 and IGF1-dependent genes in trained skeletal muscle, thereby reducing training-induced muscle damage. DESIGN Human myotubes were incubated with Arg and Leu for 24 h. Then, the effects of long-term branched chain AAs administration (10 weeks, 0.1 g/kg body mass/day) to volunteers (six subjects per AAs and placebo groups) performing large training volumes regularly (cross country skiers, training twice a day) were examined. RESULTS Incubating the myotubes with AAs increases expression of IGF1 mRNA isoforms and IGF1 secretion by 2-3 times. In athletes, long-term AAs administration increased basal blood levels of IGF1 (~50%) and expression of IGF1Ea mRNA slightly in skeletal muscle. There is no marked increase in expression of COL1A1, COL3A1, COL5A1, and LOX genes in skeletal muscle after AAs administration. However, expression of these genes in the combined group (placebo + AAs; n = 12) significantly correlated with the expression of IGF1Ea mRNA in muscle and did not correlate with IGF1 levels in the blood. CONCLUSIONS AAs administration increases IGF1 expression in vitro and in vivo. To obtain more pronounced changes in expression of IGF1 and IGF1-dependent genes in skeletal muscle, it may be necessary to increase the dose and/or duration of AAs administration.","Lednev, Egor M; Kravchenko, Irina V; Furalyov, Vladimir A; Lysenko, Evgeny A; Lemesheva, Iulia S; Grushin, Alexandr A; Dubrov, Vadim E; Vinogradova, Olga L; Popov, Daniil V",Growth hormone & IGF research : official journal of the Growth Hormone Research Society and the International IGF Research Society,430,16

Viral infection is an established trigger for the onset of ME/CFS symptoms, raising the possibility of an increase in ME/CFS prevalence resulting from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Current treatments are largely palliative and limited to alleviating symptoms and addressing the psychological sequelae associated with long-term disability. While ME/CFS is characterized by broad heterogeneity, common features include immune dysregulation and mitochondrial dysfunction. However, the underlying mechanistic basis of the disease remains poorly understood. Herein, we review the current understanding, diagnosis and treatment of ME/CFS and summarize past clinical studies aimed at identifying effective therapies.

We hypothesized that high-dose preoperative methylprednisolone (MP) would improve analgesia compared to placebo. METHODS A total of 120 adult patients were randomized equally to 125 mg MP or placebo before the start of their elective video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery lobectomy. Group allocation was blinded to patients, investigators and caregivers, and all patients received standardized multimodal, opioid-sparing analgesia. Our primary outcome was area under the curve on a numeric rating scale from 0 to 10, for pain scores on the day of surgery and on postoperative days 1 and 2. Clinical follow-up was 2-3 weeks, and telephone follow-up was 12 weeks after surgery. RESULTS Ninety-six patients were included in the primary analysis. Methylprednisolone significantly decreased median pain scores on the day of surgery: at rest (numeric rating scale 1.6 vs 2.0, P = 0.019) and after mobilization to a sitting position (numeric rating scale 1.7 vs 2.5, P = 0.004) but not during arm abduction and coughing (P = 0.052 and P = 0.083, respectively). Nausea and fatigue were reduced on the day of surgery (P = 0.04 and 0.03), whereas no outcome was improved on postoperative Days 1 and 2. Methylprednisolone did not increase the risk of complications but increased blood glucose levels on the day of surgery (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS High-dose preoperative MP significantly reduced pain at rest and after mobilization to a sitting position on the day of surgery, without later analgesic effects. Nausea and fatigue were improved without side effects, except transient higher postoperative blood glucose levels.

With the current COVID-19 pandemic, an even greater need for remote monitoring exists. Mobile tools enhance ability to monitor patients virtually by enabling remote monitoring of VA and Amsler grid findings. DESIGN Prospective, multicenter reliability analysis PARTICIPANTS: : Patients (N=108) with near corrected VA better than 20/200 and a diagnosis of age-related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy or healthy patients without retinal disease (best corrected visual acuity [BCVA] 20/32 or better).

We aimed to identify clinical and imaging determinants that are associated with collateral grade on baseline computed tomography angiography in patients with acute ischemic stroke due to an anterior circulation large vessel occlusion. Methods- Patients included in the MR CLEAN trial (Multicenter Randomized Clinical Trial of Endovascular Treatment for Acute Ischemic Stroke in the Netherlands; n=500) and MR CLEAN Registry (n=1488) were studied. Collateral status on baseline computed tomography angiography was scored from 0 (absent) to 3 (good). Multivariable ordinal logistic regression analyses were used to test the association of selected determinants with collateral status. Results- In total, 1988 patients were analyzed. Distribution of the collateral status was as follows: absent (7%, n=123), poor (32%, n=596), moderate (39%, n=735), and good (23%, n=422). Associations for a poor collateral status in a multivariable model existed for age (adjusted common odds ratio, 0.92 per 10 years [95% CI, 0.886-0.98]), male (adjusted common odds ratio, 0.64 [95% CI, 0.53-0.76]), blood glucose level (adjusted common odds ratio, 0.97 [95% CI, 0.95-1.00]), and occlusion of the intracranial segment of the internal carotid artery with occlusion of the terminus (adjusted common odds ratio 0.50 [95% CI, 0.41-0.61]). In contrast to previous studies, we did not find an association between cardiovascular risk factors and collateral status. Conclusions- Older age, male sex, high glucose levels, and intracranial internal carotid artery with occlusion of the terminus occlusions are associated with poor computed tomography angiography collateral grades in patients with acute ischemic stroke eligible for endovascular treatment.","Wiegers, Eveline J A; Mulder, Maxim J H L; Jansen, Ivo G H; Venema, Esmee; Compagne, Kars C J; Berkhemer, Olvert A; Emmer, Bart J; Marquering, Henk A; van Es, Adriaan C G M; Sprengers, Marieke E; van Zwam, Wim H; van Oostenbrugge, Robert J; Roos, Yvo B W E M; Majoie, Charles B L M; Roozenbeek, Bob; Lingsma, Hester F; Dippel, Diederik W J; van der Lugt, Aad",Stroke,430,1

Recombinant human soluble thrombomodulin (rTM) has been reported to have anti-inflammatory effects as well as antithrombogenic effects. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of rTM in a rat NEC model. METHODS NEC was induced by enteral feeding with hyperosmolar formula, gavage administration of lipopolysaccharide and asphyxia stress. Controls were fed by their mother ad libitum. In the treatment group, rTM was administered subcutaneously twice (once each on the first and second day). All animals surviving beyond 96 h or that developed signs of distress were euthanized. The ileum was harvested for a histological evaluation and the measurement of the mRNA and protein expression. RESULTS The rate of NEC-like intestinal injury in the treatment group (9/25, 36%) was significantly lower than in the NEC group (25/34, 73.5%). Tissue levels of TNF-α, IL-6 and HMGB1 were significantly elevated in the NEC group, whereas those in the treatment group were decreased to similar values as in the control group. CONCLUSIONS Our experimental study showed that rTM is able to reduce the severity and incidence of NEC. It may be an alternative option for the treatment of NEC.","Li, Bo; Saka, Ryuta; Takama, Yuichi; Ueno, Takehisa; Tazuke, Yuko; Okuyama, Hiroomi",Surgery today,430,17

The review focuses primarily on scientific databases such as Google Scholar, Science Direct, IEEE Xplore, Web of Science, and ResearchGate. A total of 58 articles were obtained from which, after removing duplicates and applying the search criteria, 18 have been included in the review. In total, 44% of the articles were published in 2019, representing a significant growth in scientific work regarding these indicators. This study also evidenced the interest of several countries. In addition, 56% of the articles were found to base their study on regression methods, 33% in classification, and 11% in grouping. After this systematic review, the efficiency and usefulness of artificial neural networks in predicting absenteeism and temporary incapacity are demonstrated. The studies regarding absenteeism and temporary disability at work are mainly conducted in Brazil and India, which are responsible for 44% of the analyzed papers followed by Saudi Arabia, and Australia which represented 22%. ANNs are the most used method in both classification and regression models representing 83% and 80% of the analyzed works, respectively. Only 10% of the literature use SVM, which is the less used method in regression models. Moreover, Naïve Bayes is the less used method in classification models representing 17%.","Montano, Isabel Herrera; Marques, Gonçalo; Alonso, Susel Góngora; López-Coronado, Miguel; de la Torre Díez, Isabel",Journal of medical systems,430,16

Fifty-five camels were successfully anesthetized using medetomidine-ketamine (MK, n=27) and medetomidine-ketamine-butorphanol (MKB, n=28); the induction of anesthesia in 21 animals was considered unsuccessful. To produce reliable anesthesia for MK, medetomidine was administered at 0.22 mg/kg (± SD=0.05) and ketamine at 2.54 mg/kg (± 0.56), and for MKB, medetomidine was administered at 0.12 mg/kg (± 0.05), ketamine at 2.3 mg/kg (± 0.39), and butorphanol at 0.05 mg/kg (± 0.02). Median time-to-recumbency for MKB (8.5 min) was 2.5 min shorter than for MK (11 min) (P=0.13). For MK, the reversal atipamezole was administered at 0.24 mg/kg (± 0.10), and for MKB, atipamezole was administered at 0.23 mg/kg (± 0.13) and naltrexone at 0.17 mg/kg (± 0.16). Median time-to-recovery was 1 min shorter for MK (5 min) than MKB (6 min; P=0.02). Physiologic parameters during recumbency were not clinically different between the two regimes. Both regimes were suitable to safely anesthetize free-ranging camels; however, further investigation is required to find the safest, most consistent, and logistically practical combination.","Boardman, Wayne S J; Lethbridge, Mark R; Hampton, Jordan O; Smith, Ian; Woolnough, Andrew P; McEwen, Margaret-Mary; Miller, Graham W J; Caraguel, Charles G B",Journal of wildlife diseases,430,1

Micronutrient supplementation in healthy nonclinical adults has limited benefits for mood and anxiety symptoms, although may convey some subtle general improvements. The evidence for adults with physical or mental ill health is more positive although limited by small samples and variability in nutrients studied. Broad spectrum nutrient products may be more effective than a selected few. While an effect of micronutrients cannot be dismissed, the variability of the studies makes it extremely challenging to identify specific treatment benefits.","Blampied, Meredith; Bell, Caroline; Gilbert, Claire; Rucklidge, Julia J",Expert review of neurotherapeutics,430,1

This review analyzes their place as causal pathogens in ventilator-associated pneumonia, as well as their effects on ICU patients' outcomes. RECENT FINDINGS Herpesviruses, namely herpes simplex virus (HSV) and cytomegalovirus (CMV), are the most frequent viruses detected among nonimmunosuppressed ICU patients, as confirmed by recent prospective studies. Patients infected with these viruses show increased morbidity and, especially for CMV, mortality. An increase of bacterial or fungal superinfections was observed in ICU patients with CMV reactivation. A therapeutic trial of acyclovir (HSV antiviral) in ICU patients was negative. Concerning CMV, pathogenicity was suggested by histologic assessment in ICU patients, and recent murine models with a positive effect of prophylaxis with ganciclovir that prevented postseptic CMV reactivation and secondary lung damage. SUMMARY Using efficient and rapid virologic diagnostic tests (antigenemia or PCR), the identification of viruses in ICU patients is frequent. Their role in the occurrence of ventilator-acquired pneumonia and their impact on patient outcome depend on the virus. There is sufficient evidence suggesting CMV pathogenicity to conduct an interventional randomized trial using anti-CMV drugs.","Chiche, Laurent; Forel, Jean-Marie; Papazian, Laurent",Current opinion in infectious diseases,430,23

Recreational noise pollution, especially unpredictable and intermittent sounds, and its effects on wildlife and biodiversity have been poorly studied. Researchers have paid very little attention to the effect of noisy traditional festivals (fireworks and powder-guns). This study aimed to explore the effect of these recreational activities on the juvenile productivity of an urban avian bioindicator: the house sparrow. We studied five pairs of localities in the Valencia Region (E Spain) with noisy traditional festivals. Each pair was composed of one locality with festivals during the breeding season and the closest similar locality, but with festivals outside the reproductive period (controls). Both locality types were sampled twice each spring (May-June of 2019 and 2020). Sampling dates were selected as 15 and 30 days after noisy festivals ended, while the control localities were sampled 1 day after the census of their correspondent town pair with noisy breeding season festivals. The ratio of the juveniles/adults detected during surveys in the influence area of festivals (100-m buffer around the parades route) was used as a house sparrow breeding success proxy. Data were analysed using GLMM: year (2019/2020), festivals season (breeding/non-breeding), survey (15/30 days), and their interactions were included as fixed factors. Pair of localities and locality nested within the pair were random factors. In 2019, juvenile productivity was lower in the towns with noisy traditional festivals during the breeding season than in the control towns. The 2020 festivals were cancelled due to COVID-19. In spring 2020, house sparrow juvenile productivity was the same in both town groups. Lockdown did not increase this species' juvenile productivity in the control localities in 2020 versus 2019.","Bernat-Ponce, Edgar; Gil-Delgado, José A; López-Iborra, Germán M",Environmental pollution,430,1

For a rapidly developing field such as NOTES, a needs analysis must be conducted regularly to discover emerging research trends and areas of potential high impact for a virtual simulator. This paper presents a survey-based study which follows a similar study conducted by this group in 2011 (Sankaranarayanan et al. in Surg Endosc 27:1607-1616, 2013). METHODS A 32-point questionnaire was distributed at the 2012 Natural Orifice Surgery Consortium for Assessment and Research annual meeting. These data were subsequently augmented by an identical online survey, targeted at the members of the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy and the Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons, and analyzed. RESULTS Twenty-eight NOTES experts participated in the 2012 study. Cholecystectomy (CE) procedure remained the most commonly performed NOTES technique, with 18 positive responses (64%). In contrast to 2011, the popularity of the NOTES appendectomy (AE) was significantly lower, with only 2 (7%) instances (CE vs. AE, p < 0.001), while the number of peroral endoscopic myotomy (POEM, PE) cases had increased significantly, with 11 (39%) positive responses, respectively (PE vs. AE, p = 0.013). Strong preference toward hybrid rather than pure NOTES techniques (82 vs. 11%, p < 0.001) was also expressed. Other responses were similar to those in the 2011 study, with the VTEST™ utility in developing and testing new techniques and instruments ranked particularly high. CONCLUSION Based on the results of this study, a decision was made to focus exclusively on the transvaginal hybrid NOTES cholecystectomy procedure, including both rigid and flexible scope techniques. The importance of developing a virtual NOTES simulator was reaffirmed, with POEM identified as a promising candidate for future simulator development.","Schwaitzberg, Steven D; Dorozhkin, Denis; Sankaranarayanan, Ganesh; Matthes, Kai; Jones, Daniel B; De, Suvranu",Surgical endoscopy,430,1

Previously, it was showed that fractional Er:YAG laser was effective in the treatment of facial wrinkles. AIMS The aims of this study are to determine the effects of age, Glogau stage and smoking status on the treatment efficacy of fractional Er:YAG laser; and to compare the success of laser treatment on periorbital wrinkleswith perioral wrinkles. MATERIAL/METHOD Periorbital and perioral wrinkles of the same patient were treated with fractional Er:YAG laser (2940 nm) for 4 sessions with monthly intervals. Treatment parameters were afluence of 1.5J, a spot size of 7 mm and a frequency of 5 Hz. Treatment efficacy was evaluated by a blinded physician evaluation scale and patient satisfaction scale 2 months after the final treatment session. RESULTS Fifteen patients completed the study. The mean age of the patients was 42.8 years. The blinded physician evaluation of the improvement in the periorbital wrinkles decreased (p= 0.034) and the patient satisfaction in perioral wrinkles decreased (p=0.049) with increasing age. The relationship between smoking and patient satisfaction in the treatment of periorbital wrinkles was also statistically significant (p=0.014). No difference in terms of treatment efficacy was found between periorbital and perioral regions. CONCLUSION Fractional Er:YAG laser (2940 nm) is equally successful in the treatment of periorbital and perioral wrinkles. The treatment success decreases with smoking and increasing age.","Özkoca, D; Aşkın, Ö; Engin, B",Journal of cosmetic dermatology,430,16

METHODS A total of 155 cured COVID-19 patients admitted to designated hospitals in Yunnan Province, China, from February 1, 2020, to March 20, 2020, were included. All patients underwent pulmonary CT at discharge and at 2 weeks after discharge (during reexamination at hospital). A retrospective analysis was performed using these two pulmonary CT scans of the cured patients to observe changes in the number, distribution, morphology, and density of lesions. RESULTS At discharge, the lung CT images of 15 cured patients showed no obvious lesions, while those of the remaining 140 patients showed different degrees of residual lesions. Patients with moderate disease mostly had multiple pulmonary lesions, mainly in the lower lobes of both lungs. At reexamination, the lung lesions in the patients with moderate disease had significantly improved (P<0.05), and the lung lesions in the patients with severe disease had partially improved, especially in patients with multi-lobe involvement (χ 2 =3.956, P<0.05). At reexamination, the lung lesions of patients with severe disease did not show significant changes (P>0.05).

METHODS MERS-CoV-related microarray data was searched from Array Express database and analyzed by Agilent GeneSpring GX software. Target genes of ribavirin and interferon-α were acquired from Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD). PANTHER TOOL and DAVID platform were used for the analysis of GO and Pathway. RESULTS One set of MERS-CoV related microarray data and 27 target genes of ribavirin and interferon-α were acquired from the online databases. Data on Genes from microarray were divided into two time-related gene clusters by using the Unsupervised Hierarchical Clustering. Data from the GO analysis indicated that the target genes of ribavirin and interferon-α as well as the genes from the microarray were mainly enriched in 10 biological processes, including cellular process, metabolic process, immune system process and biological regulation, et al. Data on drug target genes, first and second cluster of microarray would involve 9, 3 and 23 signaling pathways respectively, and only the former two showed 7 common pathways, which were related to pathogen recognition, cytokine release and autoimmune response. CONCLUSION Ribavirin in combination with interferon-α might have therapeutic effects on MERS patients through several signaling pathways. Genes in the second cluster might serve as target genes to be used for screening of new drugs in treating the MERS-CoV infection.","Zheng, Y; Wang, Q Y",Zhonghua liu xing bing xue za zhi = Zhonghua liuxingbingxue zazhi,430,33

Published reports on complications associated with these surgical procedures are limited. The purpose of this study was to quantify the intra- and postoperative complications associated with the TLIF surgical approach in patients undergoing surgery for spinal stenosis and degenerative scoliosis correction. METHODS This study included patients undergoing TLIF for degenerative scoliosis with neurogenic claudication and painful lumbar degenerative disc disease. The TLIF technique was performed along with posterior pedicle screw instrumentation. The average follow-up time was 30 months (range, 15-47). RESULTS A total of 29 patients with an average age of 65.9 years (range, 49-83) were evaluated. TLIFs were performed at 2.2 levels on average (range, 1-4) in addition to 6.0 (range, 4-9) levels of posterolateral instrumented fusion. The preoperative mean lumbar lordosis was 37.6° (range, 16°-55°) compared to 40.5° (range, 26°-59.2°) postoperatively. The preoperative mean coronal Cobb angle was 32.3° (range, 15°-55°) compared to 15.4° (range, 1°-49°) postoperatively. The mean operative time was 528 min (range, 276-906), estimated blood loss was 1091.7 mL (range, 150-2500), and hospitalization time was 8.0 days (range, 3-28). A baseline mean Visual Analog Scale (VAS) score of 7.6 (range, 4-10) decreased to 3.6 (range, 0-8) postoperatively. There were a total of 14 (49%) hardware and/or surgical technique related complications, and 8 (28%) patients required additional surgeries. Five (17%) patients developed pseudoarthrosis. The systemic complications (31%) included death (1), cardiopulmonary arrest with resuscitation (1), myocardial infarction (1), pneumonia (5), and pulmonary embolism (1). CONCLUSION This study suggests that although the TLIF approach is a feasible and effective method to treat degenerative adult scoliosis, it is associated with a high rate of intra- and postoperative complications and a long recovery process.","Burneikiene, Sigita; Nelson, E Lee; Mason, Alexander; Rajpal, Sharad; Serxner, Benjamin; Villavicencio, Alan T",Surgical neurology international,430,1

Based on the integrated model of ruminative response style and the diathesis-stress model, it has been suggested that incorporating rumination and mindfulness may elucidate the potential mechanism underlying the aforementioned association. This study aimed to examine the mediating role of rumination and the moderating role of mindfulness in the association between social media exposure (SME) to COVID-19 information and psychological distress. The results from online questionnaire responses of 439 college students from two universities in Wuhan, Hubei Province, showed that rumination mediated the association between SME and psychological distress. Furthermore, mindfulness was revealed as a protective factor that buffered the adverse effect of SME on psychological distress through rumination. These findings advance a better understanding of the formation process of psychological symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic and provide insights regarding effective interventions for adverse mental health consequences in college students.","Hong, Wei; Liu, Ru-De; Ding, Yi; Fu, Xinchen; Zhen, Rui; Sheng, Xiaotian","Cyberpsychology, behavior and social networking",430,29

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials to investigate the efficacy and safety of fixed ratio combinations of basal insulin with glucagon like peptide 1 receptor agonists. METHODS We searched Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Library as well as conference abstracts up to December 2016. We assessed change in haemoglobin A1c, body weight, and incidence of hypoglycaemia and gastrointestinal adverse events. RESULTS We included eight studies with 5732 participants in the systematic review. Switch from basal insulin to fixed ratio combinations with a glucagon like peptide 1 receptor agonist was associated with 0.72% reduction in haemoglobin A1c [95% confidence interval -1.03 to -0.41; I 2 = 93%] and 2.35 kg reduction in body weight (95% confidence interval -3.52 to -1.19; I 2 = 93%), reducing also risk for hypoglycaemia [odds ratio 0.70; 95% confidence interval 0.57 to 0.86; I 2 = 85%] but increasing incidence of nausea (odds ratio 6.89; 95% confidence interval 3.73-12.74; I 2 = 79%). Similarly, switching patients from treatment with a glucagon like peptide 1 receptor agonist to a fixed ratio combination with basal insulin was associated with 0.94% reduction in haemoglobin A1c (95% confidence interval -1.11 to -0.77) and an increase in body weight by 2.89 kg (95% confidence interval 2.17-3.61).

We searched PUBMED/MEDLINE for publications reporting immunogenicity data following administration of one of the licensed HPV vaccines (2vHPV, 4vHPV, and 9vHPV) to females aged 9-26 years. We conducted non-inferiority analyses comparing alternative to standard schedules using mixed effects meta-regression controlling for baseline HPV status and disaggregated by vaccine, subtype, time point, and age group (9-14 and 15-26 years). Non-inferiority was defined as the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval (CI) for the geometric mean titer (GMT) ratio being greater than 0.5. Our search returned 2464 studies, of which 23 were included in data analyses. When evaluated against standard schedules, although robust immunogenicity was demonstrated across all multi-dose groups, non-inferiority of extended interval dosing was mixed across vaccines, subtypes, and time points. Single dose did not meet the criteria for non-inferiority in any comparisons. Sparse data limited the number of possible comparisons, and further research is warranted.","Secor, Andrew M; Driver, Matthew; Kharono, Brenda; Hergott, Dianna; Liu, Gui; Barnabas, Ruanne V; Dull, Peter; Hawes, Stephen E; Drain, Paul K",Vaccines,430,23

We conducted a search of country and development agency Web sites and partner and media reports describing disruptions to the civil registration of births and deaths associated with COVID-19 related restrictions.We found considerable intercountry variation and grouped countries according to the level of disruption to birth and particularly death registration. Only a minority of the 66 countries were able to maintain service continuity during the COVID-19 restrictions. In the majority, a combination of legal and operational challenges resulted in declines in birth and death registration.

We did not modify antiplatelet medication in patients with resistance. The relationships between antiplatelet resistance and the occurrence of acute symptomatic TEs, any diffusion-positive lesions, multiple diffusion-positive lesions, or delayed TEs were investigated. Ninety-nine endovascular treatments with stent-assisted technique were performed on 99 patients. The prevalence of aspirin resistance was 12% and clopidogrel resistance was 62.6%. Acute symptomatic TEs were demonstrated in 4 patients (4%). Diffusion-positive lesions were found in 82 patients [82.1%; 36 patients were group I (≤5) and 46 patients were group II (>5)]. Delayed TEs were demonstrated in 10 patients (10.1%). Neither aspirin resistance nor clopidogrel resistance was relevant to the development of acute symptomatic TEs, any diffusion-positive lesions, multiple diffusion-positive lesions, and delayed TEs (P logistic = not available, 0.448, 0.362, and 0.829 for aspirin resistance and P logistic = 0.607, 0.367, 0.278, and 0.245 for clopidogrel resistance).

Recently, we found large reductions in visceral and subcutaneous fat one month after gastric bypass (GBP), without any change in liver fat content. Purpose. Firstly to characterize weight loss-induced lipid mobilization after one month with preoperative low-calorie diet (LCD) and a subsequent month following GBP, and secondly, to discuss the observations with reference to our previous published findings after GBP intervention alone. Methods. 15 morbidly obese women were studied prior to LCD, at GBP, and one month after GBP. Effects on metabolism were measured by magnetic resonance techniques and blood tests. Results. Body weight was similarly reduced after both months (mean: -8.0 kg, n = 13). Relative body fat changes were smaller after LCD than after GBP (-7.1 ± 3.6% versus -10 ± 3.2%, P = .029, n = 13). Liver fat fell during the LCD month (-41%, P = .001, n = 13) but was unaltered one month after GBP (+12%). Conclusion. Gastric bypass seems to cause a greater lipid mobilization than a comparable LCD-induced weight loss. One may speculate that GBP-altered gastrointestinal signalling sensitizes adipose tissue to lipolysis, promoting the changes observed.","Kullberg, Joel; Sundbom, Magnus; Haenni, Arvo; Freden, Susanne; Johansson, Lars; Börnert, Peter; Ahlström, Anders; Ahlström, Håkan; Karlsson, Anders",Journal of obesity,430,11

Regulations provide additional protections for children participating in human subject research and limit the amount of risk to which children may be exposed without benefit (21 CFR 50, subpart D, Additional Safeguards for Children in Clinical Investigations). The objective of this paper is to describe the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) experience with placebo-controlled trials conducted as part of pediatric drug development programs including compliance with 21 CFR 50, subpart D. METHODS Pediatric drug development programs conducted under the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (BPCA) or the Pediatric Research Equity Act (PREA) between 2012 and 2018 were reviewed. Trials that utilized a placebo control were identified and trial characteristics and risk mitigation strategies were extracted from publicly available sources. RESULTS During this time frame, a total of 266 products were studied under pediatric product development initiatives. Of those, 67 products (25%) were studied in 96 individual placebo-controlled trials in pediatric patients. The majority of these studies included approaches to minimize risk to children in the placebo arm, including 49 trials that utilized placebo as an add-on to known effective therapy for the disease and 48 trials that included rescue therapy in the study protocol. CONCLUSIONS When designed and conducted appropriately, placebo-controlled trials meet requirements under current US federal regulations for the protection of children in research.","Momper, Jeremiah D; Green, Dionna J; Park, Kyunghun; Burckart, Gilbert J; Snyder, Donna L",Therapeutic innovation & regulatory science,430,1

Our objective was to report the safety and feasibility of the robotic approach in the treatment of surgical sequelae of CP, and provide insights into the technique, tricks, and pitfalls associated with the application of robotics to this challenging disease entity. METHODS A retrospective review of a prospectively maintained database of patients undergoing robotic-assisted resections and/or drainage procedures for CP at the University of Pittsburgh between May 2009 and January 2017 was performed. A video of a robotic Frey procedure is also shown. RESULTS Of 812 robotic pancreatic resections and reconstructions 39 were for CP indications. These included 11 total pancreatectomies [with and without auto islet transplantation], 8 Puestow procedures, 4 Frey procedures, 6 pancreaticoduodenectomies, and 10 distal pancreatectomies. Median age was 49, and 41% of the patients were female. The most common etiology for CP was idiopathic pancreatitis (n = 16, 46%). Median operative time was 324 min with a median estimated blood loss of 250 ml. None of the patients required conversion to laparotomy. A Clavien III-IV complication rate was experienced by 5 (13%) patients, including one reoperation. Excluding the eleven patients who underwent TP, rate of clinically relevant postoperative pancreatic fistula was 7% (Grade B = 2, Grade C = 0). No 30 or 90 day mortalities were recorded. The median length of hospital stay was 7 days.

Little is known about the perceptions of neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) healthcare professionals regarding the degree to which their NICU practices or values family-centered care. PURPOSE The aims of this study were to describe attitudes and beliefs of NICU healthcare professionals about family-centered care and to explore professional characteristics that might influence those views. METHODS Data were derived from the baseline phase of a multicenter quasi-experimental study comparing usual family-centered NICU care with mobile-enhanced family-integrated care. Neonatal intensive care unit healthcare professionals completed the Family-Centered Care Questionnaire-Revised (FCCQ-R), a 45-item measure of 9 core dimensions of Current Practice and Necessary Practice for family-centered care. RESULTS A total of 382 (43%) NICU healthcare professionals from 6 NICUs completed 1 or more of the FCCQ-R subscales, 83% were registered nurses. Total and subscale scores on the Necessary Practice scale were consistently higher than those on the Current Practice scale for all dimensions of family-centered care (mean: 4.40 [0.46] vs 3.61 [0.53], P < .001). Only years of hospital experience and NICU site were significantly associated with Current Practice and Necessary Practice total scores.

METHODS This study prospectively collected and retrospectively analyzed data from patients who had undergone either non-solo-SPLA (n = 150) or solo-SPLA (n = 150). Several devices were utilized for complete, skin-to-skin solo-SPSA, including a Lone Star Retractor System and an adjustable mechanical camera holder. RESULTS Operating times were not significantly different between solo- and non-solo-SPLA (45.0 ± 21.0 minutes vs. 46.7 ± 26.1 minutes, P = 0.646). Most postoperative variables were also comparable between groups, including the necessity for intravenous analgesics (0.7 ± 1.2 ampules [solo-SPLA] vs. 0.9 ± 1.5 ampules [non-solo-SPLA], P = 0.092), time interval to gas passing (1.3 ± 1.0 days vs. 1.4 ± 1.0 days, P = 0.182), and the incidence of postoperative complications (4.0% vs. 8.7%, P = 0.153). Moreover, solo-SPLA effectively lowered the operating cost by reducing surgical personnel expenses. CONCLUSION Solo-SPLA economized staff numbers and thus lowered hospital costs without lengthening of operating time.

Improvements in needling technique have led to increasing tissue yields. Blood clogging of the needle can cause difficulties with specimen handling and stylet passage, which improves when the needle is primed with heparin before use. However, the effect of heparin on cytology, histology or immunochemistry (IHC) of FNA and FNB specimens is unknown. The goal of the study was to evaluate heparin priming on cytologic/histologic appearance, IHC staining, ease of stylet passage, and specimen bloodiness. Patients and methods This was a retrospective study of patients undergoing EUS-FNA/FNB. Needle sizes were 25 gauge (g), 22 g, and 19 g. Heparin priming of the needle was done and the stylet replaced (""dry heparin"") or suction attached without replacing the stylet (""wet heparin""). Smears and cellblocks were examined by pathologists, and IHC staining were done as needed. Specimen bloodiness was compared with matched controls. Results Adequate tissue yields were obtained in all samples (37 heparin, 36 no heparin). Heparin priming did not exhibit negative effects on cytologic or histologic interpretation of the specimens, nor IHC. There was no difference in cellblock bloodiness between the heparin primed needle specimens and the non-heparin control group. . Conclusions Heparin priming of EUS-FNA or FNB needles does not negatively affect cytologic or histologic interpretation, nor interfere with IHC. In addition, heparin priming does not increase specimen bloodiness. When the ""wet suction"" technique is used for EUS-FNA, heparin priming can be used instead of saline priming of the EUS needle.","Diehl, David L; Mok, Shaffer R S; Khara, Harshit S; Johal, Amitpal S; Kirchner, H Lester; Lin, Fan",Endoscopy international open,430,17

Water samples from sites characterized by growing degrees of pollution were analyzed by culture-dependent methods, revealing the presence of multidrug-resistant bacteria and clinically relevant indicators of antimicrobial resistance, such as extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL). Isolates were identified by mass spectrometry, which indicated the presence of potential human pathogens such as Aeromonas spp. and Vibrio spp. Bacteria harboring beta-lactam resistance genes were also detected. Although Guanabara Bay is widely used as a recreational and fishing area, there is a substantial knowledge gap regarding the monitoring of antimicrobial resistance and the risk that exposure to these waters poses to public health.

We aimed to provide substantial evidence for the effect of BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine versus native infection on maternal humoral, as well as transplacentally acquired fetal immune response, potentially providing newborn protection. METHODS A multicenter study where parturients presenting for delivery were recruited at 8 medical centers across Israel and assigned to three study groups: vaccinated (n=86); PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infected during pregnancy (n=65), and unvaccinated non-infected controls (n=62). Maternal and fetal blood samples were collected from parturients prior to delivery and from the umbilical cord following delivery, respectively. Sera IgG and IgM titers were measured using Milliplex MAP SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Panel (for S1, S2, RBD and N). RESULTS BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine elicits strong maternal humoral IgG response (Anti-S and RBD) that crosses the placenta barrier and approaches maternal titers in the fetus within 15 days following the first dose. Maternal to neonatal anti-COVID-19 antibodies ratio did not differ when comparing sensitization (vaccine vs. infection). IgG transfer rate was significantly lower for third-trimester as compared to second trimester infection. Lastly, fetal IgM response was detected in 5 neonates, all in the infected group. CONCLUSIONS Antenatal BNT162b2 mRNA vaccination induces a robust maternal humoral response that effectively transfers to the fetus, supporting the role of vaccination during pregnancy.

STUDY DESIGN Retrospective study. ANIMALS Client-owned horses (n = 10). METHODS Medical records of horses with a history of thyroid enlargement were included in the study if thyroid gland enlargement was treated surgically via hemi- or bilateral thyroidectomy, with the horse standing and sedated. Data derived from follow-up clinical examination, performance level, recurrence, and cosmetic outcome were evaluated. RESULTS Thyroid enlargement was unilateral in 8 and bilateral in 2 horses. Histopathological findings included adenomas (5/10), adenocarcinomas (2/10), cystic hyperplasia (2/10), and C-cell adenoma (1/10). No major complications were encountered during or after surgery. All horses resumed their previous level of exercise within 6 weeks. Recurrence was diagnosed in 1 horse, 7 months after excision, and a second surgery was required. Recurrent laryngeal nerve neuropathy and seroma formation subsequent to surgery were not recorded in any of the cases. CONCLUSION Thyroidectomy can safely be performed with the horse standing and sedated with local anesthesia.

Recent evidence suggests that immune suppression and susceptibility to the malaria parasite, Plasmodium, is mediated by type I IFN; however, it is unclear how type I IFN suppresses immunity to blood-stage Plasmodium parasites. During experimental severe malaria, CD4+ Th cell responses are suppressed, and conventional DC (cDC) function is curtailed through unknown mechanisms. Here, we tested the hypothesis that type I IFN signaling directly impairs cDC function during Plasmodium infection in mice. Using cDC-specific IFNAR1-deficient mice, and mixed BM chimeras, we found that type I IFN signaling directly affects cDC function, limiting the ability of cDCs to prime IFN-γ-producing Th1 cells. Although type I IFN signaling modulated all subsets of splenic cDCs, CD8- cDCs were especially susceptible, exhibiting reduced phagocytic and Th1-promoting properties in response to type I IFNs. Additionally, rapid and systemic IFN-α production in response to Plasmodium infection required type I IFN signaling in cDCs themselves, revealing their contribution to a feed-forward cytokine-signaling loop. Together, these data suggest abrogation of type I IFN signaling in CD8- splenic cDCs as an approach for enhancing Th1 responses against Plasmodium and other type I IFN-inducing pathogens.","Haque, Ashraful; Best, Shannon E; Montes de Oca, Marcela; James, Kylie R; Ammerdorffer, Anne; Edwards, Chelsea L; de Labastida Rivera, Fabian; Amante, Fiona H; Bunn, Patrick T; Sheel, Meru; Sebina, Ismail; Koyama, Motoko; Varelias, Antiopi; Hertzog, Paul J; Kalinke, Ulrich; Gun, Sin Yee; Rénia, Laurent; Ruedl, Christiane; MacDonald, Kelli P A; Hill, Geoffrey R; Engwerda, Christian R",The Journal of clinical investigation,430,33

Technical success, ablation duration time, overall procedure time and safety were registered. To define the shape of the ablation zone, multiplanar reformatting (MPR) was performed. Roundness index transverse was calculated: a value near 1 represents a more spherical ablation zone shape, and a value distant from 1 implies an oval configuration. Technical success was 100%. Mean ablation time was of 3.85 min (range 3-5 min), mean overall procedure time was 30.5 min (range 25-40 min). No major complications were recorded. Roundness index transverse presented a mean value of 0.94, meaning that a spherical shape of ablation zone was achieved. One of the most promising innovations of the new microwave technology is the spherical shape of the ablation volume that could be related with an improving of the effectiveness and safety.","Ierardi, Anna Maria; Mangano, Alberto; Floridi, Chiara; Dionigi, Gianlorenzo; Biondi, Antonio; Duka, Ejona; Lucchina, Natalie; Lianos, Georgios D; Carrafiello, Gianpaolo",Updates in surgery,430,16

Recent findings from studies focusing on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), shifted our attention to a potential modulatory role of H2S in this viral respiratory disease. Recent Advances: H2S levels at hospital admission may be of importance since this gasotransmitter has been shown to be protective against lung damage through its antiviral, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory actions. Furthermore, many COVID-19 cases have been described demonstrating remarkable clinical improvement upon administration of high doses of N-acetylcysteine (NAC). NAC is a renowned pharmacological antioxidant substance acting as a source of cysteine, thereby promoting endogenous glutathione (GSH) biosynthesis as well as generation of sulfane sulfur species when desulfurated to H2S. Critical Issues: Combining H2S physiology and currently available knowledge of COVID-19, H2S is hypothesized to target three main vulnerabilities of SARS-CoV-2: 1) cell entry through interfering with functional host receptors, 2) viral replication through acting on RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (RdRp), and 3) the escalation of inflammation to a potentially lethal hyperinflammatory cytokine storm (TLR4 pathway and NLRP3 inflammasome). Future Directions: Dissecting the breakdown of NAC reveals the possibility of increasing endogenous H2S levels, which may provide a convenient rationale for the application of H2S-targeted therapeutics. Further randomized controlled trials (RCT) are warranted to investigate its definitive role.","Bourgonje, Arno R; Offringa, Annette K; van Eijk, Larissa E; Abdulle, Amaal E; Hillebrands, Jan-Luuk; van der Voort, Peter H J; van Goor, Harry; van Hezik, Ed J",Antioxidants & redox signaling,430,16

It evolves from the progressive miniaturization of follicles that leads to a subsequent decrease of hair density, leading to non-scarring diffuse alopecia, with characteristic clinical, dermoscopic, and histological patterns. Vitamin D receptor (VDR) is expressed in follicular keratinocytes and dermal papilla cells and is shown to have important role in hair growth and regulation of hair cycle. VDR polymorphism was not extensively investigated in hair disorders including FPHL. Aim To investigate the association between VDR gene polymorphism (Cdx-1 and Taq-1) and FPHL to explore if these polymorphisms affect the disease occurrence or influence its clinical presentation. Methods A case-control study was conducted on 30 female patients with FPHL and 30 age-matched female healthy subjects, as a control group. Degree of hair loss was assessed by Ludwig grading. VDR gene polymorphisms, Taq-1 and Cdx-1 were investigated by real time polymerase chain reaction. Results CC genotype, TC genotype, and T allele of Taq-1 were more prevalent in FPHL patients than in control group. They increased disease risk by 12.6, 2.1, and 2.9 folds, respectively. AA genotype, GA genotype, and G allele of Cdx-1 were significantly more prevalent among FPHL patients than in control group. They increased disease risk by 7.5, 5.2, and 5.5 folds, respectively. Conclusion Taq-1 and Cdx-1 can be considered as risk factors for FPHL. They may play role in disease persistence rather than disease initiation. This association may be explained by failure of new anagen growth and decreased proliferation of hair follicle stem cells. Further studies are recommended to confirm current findings.","Seleit, Iman; Bakry, Ola Ahmed; Badr, Eman; Mabrouk, Mai",Indian journal of dermatology,430,1

However, there is no consensus about the optimal flush interval for those patients. OBJECTIVE The purpose of this review was to evaluate whether the flush interval could be prolonged based on monthly interval for regular maintenance and to explore the optimal flush interval. DATA SOURCES We searched the following databases for articles published between 1 January 1982 and 21 February 2020: PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, EMBASE, CINAHL, and Ovid. STUDY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA Randomized controlled trials, retrospective and prospective cohort studies of flush interval less than 4 weeks versus longer than 4 weeks for patients who completed chemotherapy, were included. RESULTS Two reviewers extracted information and assessed the quality of the articles independently. In total, 389 articles were retrieved, and 4 studies including 862 cases fulfilled the inclusion criteria. There was no statistical heterogeneity (I2 = 0, p > 0.05) among the included studies. Hence, the fixed-effects model was used for the meta-analysis. The meta-analysis showed that the total complication rate associated with longer than 4-week interval was higher than that associated with less than 4-week interval. Nevertheless, there was no significant difference between the two groups (7.2% vs 7.6%, p = 0.83). Moreover, the meta-analysis showed that the total complication and catheter occlusion rates associated with the 4-week interval were higher than those associated with the 8-week interval. However, there was no significant difference between the two groups (total complications: 11.4% vs 9.5%, p = 0.68; catheter occlusions: 4.9% vs 4.1%, p = 0.89). LIMITATIONS Only four non-randomized controlled studies were included, and the outcomes of the included studies were reported incompletely. CONCLUSION Extending the flush interval to longer than 4 weeks is safe and feasible. Based on previous studies, extending the flush interval to 8 weeks might not increase the incidence of total complications and catheter occlusions. However, there is no conclusion on whether the flush interval could be extended to 3 months or longer.","Wu, Xiaohong; Zhang, Tiantian; Chen, Lichan; Chen, Xisui",The journal of vascular access,430,30

We aimed to review and synthesise available mortality data on international migrants. METHODS In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar databases for observational studies, systematic reviews, and randomised controlled trials published between Jan 1, 2001, and March 31, 2017, without language restrictions. We included studies reporting mortality outcomes for international migrants of any age residing outside their country of birth. Studies that recruited participants exclusively from intensive care or high dependency hospital units, with an existing health condition or status, or a particular health exposure were excluded. We also excluded studies limited to maternal or perinatal outcomes. We screened studies using systematic review software and extracted data from published reports. The main outcomes were all-cause and International Classification of Diseases, tenth revision (ICD-10) cause-specific standardised mortality ratios (SMRs) and absolute mortality rates. We calculated summary estimates using random-effects models. This study is registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42017073608. FINDINGS Of the 12 480 articles identified by our search, 96 studies were eligible for inclusion. The studies were geographically diverse and included data from all global regions and for 92 countries. 5464 mortality estimates for more than 15·2 million migrants were included, of which 5327 (97%) were from high-income countries, 115 (2%) were from middle-income countries, and 22 (<1%) were from low-income countries. Few studies included mortality estimates for refugees (110 estimates), asylum seekers (144 estimates), or labour migrants (six estimates). The summary estimate of all-cause SMR for international migrants was lower than one when compared with the general population in destination countries (0·70 [95% CI 0·65-0·76]; I2=99·8%). All-cause SMR was lower in both male migrants (0·72 [0·63-0·81]; I2=99·8%) and female migrants (0·75 [0·67-0·84]; I2=99·8%) compared with the general population. A mortality advantage was evident for refugees (SMR 0·50 [0·46-0·54]; I2=89·8%), but not for asylum seekers (1·05 [0·89-1·24]; I2=54·4%), although limited data was available on these groups. SMRs for all causes of death were lower in migrants compared with the general populations in the destination country across all 13 ICD-10 categories analysed, with the exception of infectious diseases and external causes. Heterogeneity was high across the majority of analyses. Point estimates of all-cause age-standardised mortality in migrants ranged from 420 to 874 per 100 000 population. INTERPRETATION Our study showed that international migrants have a mortality advantage compared with general populations, and that this advantage persisted across the majority of ICD-10 disease categories. The mortality advantage identified will be representative of international migrants in high-income countries who are studying, working, or have joined family members in these countries. However, our results might not reflect the health outcomes of more marginalised groups in low-income and middle-income countries because little data were available for these groups, highlighting an important gap in existing research. Our results present an opportunity to reframe the public discourse on international migration and health in high-income countries.

Thermal suit (T-Balance® ) is an option for passive warming perioperatively. We hypothesized that the thermal suit will not maintain normothermia more efficiently than conventional cotton clothes when also other preventive procedures against unintentional hypothermia are used. METHODS One hundred patients were recruited to this prospective, randomized trial. They were allocated to the Thermal Suit group or a Control group wearing conventional hospital cotton clothes. All patients received our institution's standard treatment against unintentional hypothermia including a warming mattress, a forced-air upper body warming blanket and a warming device for intravenous fluids. Eardrum temperature was measured pre-operatively. In the operating room and post-anaesthesia care unit temperatures were measured from four locations: oesophagus, left axilla, dorsal surface of the left middle finger and dorsum of the left foot. The primary outcome measure was temperature change during robotic-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy. RESULTS The temperatures of 96 patients were analysed. There was no difference in mean core temperatures, axillary temperatures or skin temperatures on the finger between the groups. Only foot dorsum temperatures were significantly lower in the Thermal Suit group. Intraoperative temperature changes were similar in both groups. In the post-anaesthesia care unit temperature changes were minimal and they did not differ between the groups. CONCLUSION Provided that standard preventive procedures in maintaining normothermia are effective the thermal suit does not provide any additional benefit over conventional cotton clothes during robotic-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy.","Lauronen, S-L; Kalliomäki, M-L; Aho, A J; Kalliovalkama, J; Riikonen, J M; Mäkinen, M-T; Leppikangas, H M; Yli-Hankala, A M",Acta anaesthesiologica Scandinavica,430,13

The present study aimed to evaluate the knowledge, attitude, and precautionary practices of HCPs towards COVID-19. METHODOLOGY The current study was a descriptive, cross-sectional, online study directed to the HCPs working in a metropolitan city of Karachi, during February 2020 and March 2020 using a self-administered questionnaire. A systematic random sampling approach was adopted. RESULTS A total of 286 completed surveys were incorporated in the investigation with a response rate of 74.28%. The median (interquartile range, IQR) knowledge score was 18.79 (17.64-19.57). Physicians were found to be more knowledgeable (OR: 1.32, 95% CI: 0.17-4.26, p = 0.003) as compared to other HCPs. Similarly, the HCPs working in private work settings (OR: 1.94, 95% CI: 1.54-2.79, p=0.001), having more experience (OR = 1.82; 95% CI = 1.64-2.78; p < 0.005) were found to be more well-informed than HCPs working in public sector (OR = 0.81; 95% CI = 0.63-0.72; p = 0.004). The correlation between the knowledge and attitude of respondents was found to be significantly correlated (correlation coefficient: 0.13, p < 0.005). CONCLUSIONS The findings of the study revealed that HCPs were well conversant and have an optimistic attitude towards COVID-19. Further contemplates are required to evaluate the understanding of HCPs at a national level so that viable mediations could be planned to combat this pandemic.","Shakeel, Sadia; Rehman, Hina; Hassali, Mohammad Azmi; Hashmi, Faraz",Journal of infection in developing countries,430,1

AREAS COVERED This manuscript reviews the efforts made in the development of small molecules for the treatment of influenza virus, primarily focused on patent applications in the last five years. Attention is paid to compounds targeting key functional viral proteins, such as the M2 channel, neuraminidase, and hemagglutinin, highlighting the evolution toward novel ligands and scaffolds motivated by the emergence of resistant strains. Finally, the discovery of compounds against novel viral targets, such as the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, is discussed. EXPERT OPINION The therapeutic potential of antiviral agents is limited by the increasing presence of resistant strains. This should encourage research on novel strategies for therapeutic intervention. In this context, the discovery of arbidol and JNJ7918 against hemagglutinin, and current efforts on RNA-dependent RNA polymerase have disclosed novel opportunities for therapeutic treatment. Future studies should attempt to expand the therapeutic arsenal of anti-flu agents, often in combined therapies, which might be relevant to prevent future health challenges caused by influenza virus.","Ginex, Tiziana; Luque, F Javier",Expert opinion on therapeutic patents,430,16

The primary aim of this study was to compare the diagnostic yield (DY) of endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) to endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle biopsy (EUS-FNB) for pancreatic and non-pancreatic masses. PATIENTS AND METHODS Consecutive patients referred for EUS-TA underwent randomization to EUS-FNA or EUS-FNB at four tertiary-care medical centers. A maximum of three passes were allowed for the initial method of EUS-TA and patients were crossed over to the other arm based on on-site specimen adequacy. RESULTS A total of 140 patients were enrolled. The overall DY was significantly higher with specimens obtained by EUS-FNB compared to EUS-FNA (90.0 % vs. 67.1 %, P = 0.002). While there was no difference in the DY between the two groups for pancreatic masses (FNB: 91.7 % vs. FNA: 78.4 %, P = 0.19), the DY of EUS-FNB was higher than the EUS-FNA for non-pancreatic lesions (88.2 % vs. 54.5 %, P = 0.006). Specimen adequacy was higher for EUS-FNB compared to EUS-FNA for all lesions (P = 0.006). There was a significant rescue effect of crossover from failed FNA to FNB in 27 out of 28 cases (96.5 %, P = 0.0003). Decision analysis showed that the strategy of EUS-FNB was cost saving compared to EUS-FNA over a wide range of cost and outcome probabilities. CONCLUSIONS RESULTS of this RCT and decision analysis demonstrate superior DY and specimen adequacy for solid mass lesions sampled by EUS-FNB.","Aadam, A Aziz; Wani, Sachin; Amick, Ashley; Shah, Janak N; Bhat, Yasser M; Hamerski, Christopher M; Klapman, Jason B; Muthusamy, V Raman; Watson, Rabindra R; Rademaker, Alfred W; Keswani, Rajesh N; Keefer, Laurie; Das, Ananya; Komanduri, Srinadh",Endoscopy international open,430,26

There are limited data on the frequency and risk factors for coexistent SVD and the effect of SVD on stroke recurrence in patients receiving medical treatment for ICAS. OBJECTIVE To investigate the frequency and risk factors for SVD and the effect of SVD on stroke recurrence in patients with ICAS. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A post hoc analysis of the Stenting and Aggressive Medical Management for Preventing Recurrent Stroke in Intracranial Stenosis (SAMMPRIS) study, a prospective, multicenter clinical trial. Among 451 participants, 313 (69.4%) had baseline brain magnetic resonance imaging scans read centrally for SVD that was defined by any of the following: old lacunar infarction, grade 2 to 3 on the Fazekas scale (for high-grade white matter hyperintensities), or microbleeds. Patient enrollment in SAMMPRIS began November 25, 2008, and follow-up ended on April 30, 2013. Data analysis for the present study was performed from May 13, 2014, to July 29, 2015. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Risk factors in patients with vs without SVD and the association between SVD and other baseline risk factors with any ischemic stroke and ischemic stroke in the territory of the stenotic artery determined using proportional hazards regression. RESULTS Of 313 patients, 155 individuals (49.5%) had SVD noted on baseline magnetic resonance imaging. Variables that were significantly higher in patients with SVD, reported as mean (SD), included age, 63.5 (10.5) years (P < .001), systolic blood pressure, 149 (22) mm Hg (P < .001), glucose level, 130 (50) mg/dL (P = .03), and lower Montreal Cognitive Assessment scores (median, ≥24 [interquartile range, 20-26]; P = .02).Other significant variables were the number of patients with diabetes mellitus (88 of 155 [56.8%]; P = .003), coronary artery disease (46 [29.7%]; P = .004), stroke before the qualifying event (59 [38.1%]; P < .001), old infarct in the territory of the stenotic intracranial artery (88 [56.8%]; P < .001), and receiving antithrombotic therapy at the time of the qualifying event (109 [70.3%]; P = .005). The association between SVD and any ischemic stroke was nearly significant in the direction of a higher risk (18 [23.7%]); P = .07) for patients with SVD. On bivariate analysis, SVD was not associated with an increased risk on multivariable analyses (hazard ratio, 1.7 [95% CI, 0.8-3.8]; P = .20). In addition, SVD was not associated with an increased risk of stroke in the territory on either bivariate or multivariable analyses. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Although SVD is common in patients with ICAS, the presence of SVD on baseline magnetic resonance imaging is not independently associated with an increased risk of stroke in patients with ICAS.

There is, therefore, considerable potential in nanoparticles which achieve delivery of the right drug(s) using the right route of administration to the right location at the right time, monitoring the process by non-invasive molecular imaging. A challenge is harnessing immunotherapy via activation of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) for the development of vaccines against major infectious diseases and cancer. In immunotherapy, delivery of the vaccine components to lymph nodes (LNs) is essential for effective stimulation of the immune response. Although some promising advances have been made, delivering therapeutics to LNs remains challenging. It is here shown that iron-oxide nanoparticles can be engineered to combine in a single and small (<50 nm) nanocarrier complementary multimodal imaging features with the immunostimulatory activity of polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly (I:C)). Whilst the fluorescence properties of the nanocarrier show effective delivery to endosomes and TLR3 in antigen presenting cells, MRI/SPECT imaging reveals effective delivery to LNs. Importantly, in vitro and in vivo studies show that, using this nanocarrier, the immunostimulatory activity of poly (I:C) is greatly enhanced. These nanocarriers have considerable potential for cancer diagnosis and the development of new targeted and programmable immunotherapies.","Cobaleda-Siles, Macarena; Henriksen-Lacey, Malou; Ruiz de Angulo, Ane; Bernecker, Anja; Gómez Vallejo, Vanessa; Szczupak, Boguslaw; Llop, Jordi; Pastor, Géraldine; Plaza-Garcia, Sandra; Jauregui-Osoro, Maite; Meszaros, Levente K; Mareque-Rivas, Juan C",Small,430,19

Occupational therapy can play a key role in promoting participation and engagement in work by persons with mental disabilities. OBJECTIVE This review sought to identify the barriers and facilitators to work participation for persons with mental disabilities globally in comparison to Zimbabwe, and to identify the competencies related to work practice in occupational therapy curricula internationally and regionally. METHODS A narrative literature review was conducted using the SALSA (Search, Appraisal, Synthesis and Analysis) framework which informed retrieval and analysis of articles published between 2012 and 2018. RESULTS Fifty-one out of 227 articles were selected to inform the review. A synthesis of the literature provided insights and ideas on facilitators and barriers to work for persons with mental disabilities and the competencies related to work practice in occupational therapy curricula. CONCLUSION Barriers to participation in work for persons with mental disabilities are real. However, occupational therapists from different contexts have a variety of competencies to facilitate participation in work.

The aim of the study was to analyze the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on patients and professionals in a radiation oncology department. Materials and methods We implement a plan with the objectives of maintaining radiotherapy treatment in those patients who need it and, at the same time, reducing the risk of spreading the virus to staff and patients. This plan included measures aimed at limiting the patient's stay in hospital, selecting those patients in whom radiotherapy cannot be delayed and protecting against infection through the use of physical protective measures. Results Between March 16 and May 31, 2020, 360 patients received radiotherapy in our department. In 14 patients (4.7%) the start of treatment was delayed by an average of 28 days. Four patients had a positive COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR ) (6.6% and 1.1% of tested and all patients, respectively). Among the professionals, two PCR s were positive (16.6% and 4% of tested and all individuals, respectively). In the serology analysis 4 out of 50 department members were IgG positive (8%). Conclusions Despite the fact that our department is located in a region with a high incidence of COVID-19 infection, the impact of the pandemic on our patients and staff has been moderate. The implementation of measures against infection and an adequate selection of patients for treatment allows radiation oncology departments to maintain clinical activity.","Romero, Jesús; Benlloch, Raquel; Obeso, Jorge; Engel, Olga; Gil, Beatriz; Córdoba, Sofía; Zapata, Irma; López, Marta; Portero, Francisca",Reports of practical oncology and radiotherapy : journal of Greatpoland Cancer Center in Poznan and Polish Society of Radiation Oncology,430,27

After its initial impact in Asia, the highest case growth is now in the Americas. The South American countries face a strong challenge due to the vulnerabilities of their health systems and the fragile socio-economic conditions of their population. This perspective looks at the impact of COVID-19 in South America and argues that the health critical care systems of these countries are particularly vulnerable due to the underestimation of the number of cases currently confirmed and the strong need for treatment of these patients in intensive care units (ICUs). In particular, Bolivia will need to increase the number of ICU beds 60-fold while Brazil will need to grow 12-fold to meet the growth rates of COVID-19 by the end of July 2020. In this sense, it is argued that national and transnational measures should be taken urgently to face this challenge. Furthermore, it is necessary to perform tests to detect COVID-19 cases earlier to alleviate the need for internment in ICUs.","Almeida, Fernando",International journal of health policy and management,430,17

Therapeutic hypothermia is one such co-therapy, but numerous issues have hampered its clinical use (e.g., pneumonia risk with whole-body cooling). Some problems may be avoided with brain-specific methods, such as intra-arterial selective cooling infusion (IA-SCI) into the arteries supplying the ischemic tissue. Objective: Our research question was about the efficacy of IA-SCI in animal middle cerebral artery occlusion models. We hypothesized that IA-SCI would be beneficial, but translationally-relevant study elements may be missing (e.g., aged animals). Methods: We completed a systematic review of the PubMed database following the PRISMA guidelines on May 21, 2020 for animal studies that administered IA-SCI in the peri-reperfusion period and assessed infarct volume, behavior (primary meta-analytic endpoints), edema, or blood-brain barrier injury (secondary endpoints). Our search terms included: ""focal ischemia"" and related terms, ""IA-SCI"" and related terms, and ""animal"" and related terms. Nineteen studies met inclusion criteria. We adapted a methodological quality scale from 0 to 12 for experimental design assessment (e.g., use of blinding/randomization, a priori sample size calculations). Results: Studies were relatively homogenous (e.g., all studies used young, healthy animals). Some experimental design elements, such as blinding, were common whereas others, such as sample size calculations, were infrequent (median methodological quality score: 5; range: 2-7). Our analyses revealed that IA-SCI provides benefit on all endpoints (mean normalized infarct volume reduction = 23.67%; 95% CI: 19.21-28.12; mean normalized behavioral improvement = 35.56%; 95% CI: 25.91-45.20; mean standardized edema reduction = 0.95; 95% CI: 0.56-1.34). Unfortunately, blood-brain barrier assessments were uncommon and could not be analyzed. However, there was substantial statistical heterogeneity and relatively few studies. Therefore, exploration of heterogeneity via meta-regression using saline infusion parameters, study quality, and ischemic duration was inconclusive. Conclusion: Despite convincing evidence of benefit in ischemic stroke models, additional studies are required to determine the scope of benefit, especially when considering additional elements (e.g., dosing characteristics). As there is interest in using this treatment alongside current ischemic stroke therapies, more relevant animal studies will be critical to inform patient studies.","Liddle, Lane J; Dirks, Christine A; Fedor, Brittany A; Almekhlafi, Mohammed; Colbourne, Frederick",Frontiers in neurology,430,1

Minimizing GHGs from agroecosystems without compromising crop yield for stabilization of green production systems remains a challenge. Being an integral component of wheat production technology, the nitrogen (N) application deems to be indispensable. Thus, to reduce the application of N fertilizer and keep in view the minimization of GHGs emission, without compromising soil fertility and wheat production, field experiments were performed with treatments included maize straw mulch (S1: 0, S2: 4500, S3: 9000 kg ha-1) and nitrogen fertilizer (N1: 0, N2: 192 and N3: 240 kg ha-1) during 2015-17. Results showed that the cumulative CO2 and N2O emission from 9000 kg ha-1 of maize straw mulch with 192 kg N ha-1 (S3N2) significantly decreased by 0.67% and 33.7%, respectively, averaged over two years compared with that of 9000 kg ha-1 of maize straw mulch with 240 kg N ha-1 (S3N3). Likewise, the average soil moisture content significantly increased by 10% and 10.6% for S3N2 and S3N3 treatments at 0-10 cm soil depth, respectively, compared to S1N1. Similarly, the S3N2 and S3N3 treatments had lowered the soil temperature by 0.2 and 0.1 °C, respectively, over S1N1 in wheat grown fields. The grain yield of wheat was increased by 45% and 45% under S3N3 and S3N2 treatments than S1N1, respectively. The S3N2 treatment was more economical than S3N3 for wheat crop. Therefore, maize straw mulch (S3) combined with 20% less N fertilizer (N2) from commercial source were considered as a viable production technology to improve crop yield, and reduce soil CO2 and N2O emissions.","Akhtar, Kashif; Wang, Weiyu; Ren, Guangxin; Khan, Ahmad; Enguang, Nie; Khan, Aziz; Feng, Yongzhong; Yang, Gaihe; Wang, Haiyan",The Science of the total environment,430,4

This study investigated the changes in the expression of ACE and ACE2 in the kidney in early diabetic rats. METHODS Streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats were examined. The concentrations of angiotensin II in plasma, urine, and renal cortex were measured by radioimmunoassay. The mRNA expression of ACE, ACE2, angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R), and Mas receptor (MasR) in glomeruli and cortex was assessed using real-time PCR. The glomerular and cortical expression of ACE and ACE2 was assessed by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS For renal cortical tissue, the angiotensin II level was more intensified in the 8-week diabetic rats. Immunohistochemical experiments showed that ACE was increased, but ACE2 was decreased in the glomeruli of 8-week diabetic rats, while both ACE and ACE2 in the tubules were increased. The AT1R mRNA in the glomeruli was decreased, while the MasR mRNA was increased in 2-week diabetic rats. CONCLUSION The combined effects of increased ACE and decreased ACE2 in glomeruli may be associated with the activation of the renin-angiotensin system in early diabetic rats, which is known to increase proteinuria.","Moon, Ju-Young; Jeong, Kyung-Hwan; Lee, Sang-Ho; Lee, Tae-Won; Ihm, Chun-Gyoo; Lim, Sung Jig",Nephron.

Are young people keeping well informed during the COVID-19 pandemic in Spain? Are the youth behaving responsibly? This document presents several results regarding these questions. In our introduction, we establish a theoretical framework for the following concepts: disinformation, responsibility, credibility, and youth responsibility variables. Our primary interest is in communication factors. The applied methods are a reference review of the national and international literature surrounding this subject and qualitative opinion research conducted through discussion groups with young university students from private and public communication schools in Madrid. A recent study, held in June 2021, provides valuable material for this paper. The main results and findings are as follows: not being satisfied with the information received about COVID-19;knowledge about the most credible news sources;the connection between information and responsibility;and the solutions that are claimed to more responsible in this context by various youth participants. In conclusion, this paper confirms the first hypothesis of considering disinformation as a variable that causes a lack of personal responsibility among youths in complying with public health expectations. Regarding the second hypothesis, we verify that young people consider communication one of the main solutions for being more responsible. In other words, when presented with more information about COVID-19 they feel more aware of the disease.","Farfán, Juana Mazo María Elena",Publications,430,1

We find that in 2020 grade 2 students lost between 57% and 70% of a year of learning relative to their pre-pandemic peers. Among a grade 4 sample, learning losses are estimated at between 62% and 81% of a year of learning. Considering that in 2020 students in the samples lost between 56% to 60% of contact teaching days due to school closures and rotational timetabling schedules compared to a pre-pandemic year, this implies learning to schooling loss ratios in the region of 1 to 1.4. There is some evidence from the grade 4 sample that the reading trajectories of children benefiting more from attending school pre-pandemic – namely girls and children with stronger initial reading proficiency - are more negatively impacted. Mitigating the long-run implications of these learning losses will require a significant pivoting of the education system to ensure that instructional practices are appropriately levelled to optimise learning.","Ardington, Cally Wills Gabrielle Kotze Janeli",International Journal of Educational Development,430,29

During level 4 lockdown, most New Zealanders (with exceptions such as essential service workers) were restricted to physical contact with members of their residence - a social unit the government referred to as the members of one’s “home, "" “household, "" or “bubble.” Not all care relations can, however, be reduced to a single home or household, nor are all households units of care. Regulations enabling bubble expansions in specific circumstances provided some means of addressing care needs that superseded households (e.g., singletons becoming “bubble buddies” to mitigate loneliness). But little was done for those consigned to bubbles whose members were unattached to one another, much less antagonistic. There is thus a need for bubble regulations to match more closely the flexibility inherent in the bubble as a concept when planning for future crises. © 2021 selection and editorial matter, J.

The functional dependence of the basic reproductive number R0 on the model's defining parameters reveals the role of spatial fluctuations and leads to a novel expression for R0. Special attention is given to simulations of inter-regional transmission of the contagion. The attack rate and the (growing) radius of gyration of the affected zones are used as measures of the severity of the outbreaks, in cases where R0 is not sufficiently prescriptive to chart the epidemic dynamics.","Chu, A.; Huber, G.; McGeever, A.; Veytsman, B.; Yllanes, D.",,430,1

This is a crucial problem since online courses have rapidly expanded from individual MOOCs to entire study programmes, also due to the pandemic. Early detection of students in difficulty is a challenging problem that can be mitigated with the support of state-of-the-art methods for data analytics and machine learning.

Methods: 2 surveys were sent to nurses working in the rheumatology area (Both in the Outpatient department and day care unit) during October 2020 in Spain. The first survey had 10 questions about what happened in the rheumatology units in the first wave of the COVID19 pandemic (March to June of 2020) and the second survey had 10 questions about the standards of quality of nursing care in times of pandemic. Google forms were used to collect and analyze data. Results: 32 nurses completed the survey (30 women (93.8%)) with an average age of 49.6 ± 10.2 years. 93.8% work in the outpatient clinics and 2(6.2%) in day care units. The main results of the effects of the first wave of the pandemic are as follow: 4(12.5%) nurses were transferred to other areas of the hospital, 27(84.4%) showed changes in their care activity;and in 12(37,5%) of the surveyed centers, (slightly less than half of the medical staff) left their usual activity to care for COVID-19 patients. In June 2020, at the end of the first wave, 17(53.1%) reported more decompensated patients and 22(68.8%) reported that they had both telephone and face-to-face consultations;15(46.9%) reported that their clinical activity had increased. Regarding the standards of quality during the pandemia: 27(84.4%) believed that rheumatology units should be strengthened,31(96.9%) reported the need to carry out COVID educational campaigns in rheumatic patients and 30(100%) stated that nursing education should lead that education;31(96.7%) believed that telephone consultation should be on demand and by telephone, 25 (78.1%) considered it necessary to include video calls and the possibility of receiving reports in non-face to face care and photos.

This pathology is mainly caused by viruses or bacteria. X-rays imaging analysis is one of the most used methods for pneumonia diagnosis. These clinical images can be analyzed using machine learning methods such as convolutional neural networks (CNN), which learn to extract critical features for the classification. However, the usability of these systems is limited in medicine due to the lack of interpretability, because of these models cannot be used to generate an understandable explanation (from a human-based perspective), about how they have reached those results. Another problem that difficults the impact of this technology is the limited amount of labeled data in many medicine domains. The main contributions of this work are two fold: the first one is the design of a new explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) technique based on combining the individual heatmaps obtained from each model in the ensemble. This allows to overcome the explainability and interpretability problems of the CNN""black boxes"", highlighting those areas of the image which are more relevant to generate the classification. The second one is the development of new ensemble deep learning models to classify chest X-rays that allow highly competitive results using small datasets for training. We tested our ensemble model using a small dataset of pediatric X-rays (950 samples) with low quality and anatomical variability (which represents one of the biggest challenges). We also tested other strategies such as single CNNs trained from scratch and transfer learning using CheXNet.

The learning process was assessed in terms of attitude, confidence and source credibility. One of the main findings was that the number of students and language had no impact on learning motivation and attitude towards climate change.

Additionally, the division of labor between specialist species found in natural consortia can lead to increased catalytic efficiency and stability relative to a monoculture or a community composed of generalists. In this work, we have designed a synthetic co-culture for phototrophic degradation of xenobiotics, composed of a cyanobacterium, (Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942) and a heterotrophic bacterium (Pseudomonas putida EM173). Cyanobacteria fix CO2 through photosynthetic metabolism and secrete sufficient carbohydrates to support the growth and active metabolism of P. putida, which has been engineered to consume sucrose as the only carbon source and to degrade the environmental pollutant 2,4-dinitrotoluene (2,4-DNT). The synthetic consortium is able to degrade 2,4-DNT with only light and CO2 as inputs for the system, and it was stable over time through repeated backdilutions. Furthermore, cycling this consortium through low nitrogen medium promoted the accumulation of polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA)–an added-value biopolymer–in P. putida, thus highlighting the versatility of this production platform. Altogether, the synthetic consortium allows for simultaneous bioproduction of PHA and remediation of the industrial pollutant 2,4-DNT, using light and CO2 as inputs. Importance In this study, we have created an artificial consortium composed of two bacterial species that enables the degradation of the industrially-produced environmental pollutant 2,4-DNT while simultaneously producing PHA bioplastic. In these co-cultures, the photosynthetic cyanobacteria fuel an engineered P. putida strain programmed both to use sucrose as a carbon source and to perform the biotransformation of 2,4-DNT. The division of labor in this synthetic co-culture is reminiscent of that commonly observed in microbial communities and represents a proof-of-principle example of how artificial consortia can be employed for bioremediation purposes. Furthermore, this co-culture system enabled the utilization of freshwater sources that could not be utilized in classical agriculture settings, reducing the potential competition of this alternative method of bioproduction with current agricultural practices, as well as remediation of contaminated water streams.","Fedeson, Derek T.; Saake, Pia; Calero, Patricia; Nikel, Pablo Iván; Ducat, Daniel C.",bioRxiv,430,1

Here, public scRNA-seq data from Drosophila melanogaster have been used to compare the differences in replication strategy and cellular response between two viruses, Thika virus (TV) and D. melanogaster Nora virus (DMelNV) in enteroendocrine cells (EEs). TV and DMelNV exhibited different patterns of replication and for TV, accumulation varied according to cell subtype. Cells infected with TV underwent down-regulation of genes that represent bottlenecks in the fruit fly interactome, while cells infected with DMelNV went through a down-expression of translation-related genes that represent both hubs and bottlenecks in the host interactome. In contrast, flies infected with DMelNV show only a systemic level down-regulation of bottleneck genes. Here, we use scRNA-seq to highlight the differences and commonalities between cellular response to TV and DMelNV and between cellular and systemic response to DMelNV.","Silva, João M.

Due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, some restrictions have been applied in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), causing parental concern about visiting healthcare facilities. Objectives To examine the attitudes and factors that influence parents' decisions regarding their children's vaccination during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods In this cross-sectional study, 1,704 caregivers from KSA participated. An implemented Arabic questionnaire directed to the caregivers of children at the age of routine immunizations was filled. It included questions on parent demographics, child data, the decision regarding the vaccines, cause-related questions, and the preferred means to receive the vaccines during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results A total of 1,360 participants were included. The majority were from the middle region of KSA. Thirty-nine point five percent (39.5%) of participants chose not to administer the scheduled vaccines to their children, and the main reason was the fear of COVID-19 infection. The main sources of information that encouraged administering the vaccines were the advice of physicians, Saudi Ministry of Health (SMOH) services, 937, and the Sehha application. The majority of the participants chose home immunization visits as the preferred means of vaccination during the COVID-19 pandemic (46.8%). The study showed that approximately 60% of the respondents believed that routine childhood immunizations had no role in spreading the COVID-19 infection, and 59% believed that despite the COVID-19 pandemic, routine childhood vaccines have to be administrated on time. Conclusion The study indicated the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the compliance of Saudi society toward routine pediatric immunization.","Alzaher, O. A.; Almutairi, G.

In the 20th century, widespread dermal vaccination with vaccinia virus (VACV) led to the eradication of smallpox but how VACV interacts with the microbiota and whether this influences the efficacy of vaccination are largely unknown. Here we report that intradermal vaccination with VACV induces a large increase in the number of commensal bacteria in infected tissue, which enhance recruitment of inflammatory cells, promote tissue damage and increase immunity. Treatment of vaccinated specific-pathogen-free (SPF) mice with antibiotic, or infection of genetically-matched germ-free (GF) animals caused smaller lesions without alteration in virus titre. Tissue damage correlated with enhanced neutrophil and T cell infiltration and levels of pro-inflammatory tissue cytokines and chemokines. One month after vaccination, GF mice had reduced VACV-neutralising antibodies compared to SPF mice; while numbers of VACV-specific CD8+ T cells were equal in all groups of animals. Thus, skin microbiota may provide an adjuvant-like stimulus during vaccination with VACV. This observation has implications for dermal vaccination with live vaccines. Author Summary Smallpox was caused by variola virus and was eradicated by widespread dermal vaccination with vaccinia virus (VACV), a related orthopoxvirus of unknown origin. Eradication was declared in 1980 without an understanding of the immunological correlates of protection, or knowledge of the effect of smallpox vaccination on the local microbiota. Here we demonstrate that intradermal infection of mice with VACV induces a ∼1000-fold expansion of commensal skin bacteria that influence the recruitment of inflammatory cells into the infected tissue and enhance the size of the vaccination lesion. Antibiotic treatment reduced lesion size without changing virus titres. The bacterial expansion also contributes to the level of neutralizing antibodies at one month post vaccination, because genetically matched germ-free mice developed lower neutralizing antibodies than specific pathogen free controls. Thus, dermal infection by VACV enhanced bacterial growth and these bacteria promote pathology and enhance the antibody response. This finding has implication for dermal vaccination with live vaccines.","Shmeleva, Evgeniya V.; de Agüero, Mercedes Gomez; Wagner, Josef; Enright, Anton J.; Macpherson, Andrew J.; Ferguson, Brian J.; Smith, Geoffrey L.",bioRxiv,430,16

Based on these experiences, Ghana passed the Petroleum Revenue Management Act (PRMA) in 2011. Among the provisions in the PRMA were the creation of a Stabilization Fund to cushion the budget in case of lower than expected oil revenues, debt repayment, and contingency purposes. In addition, the Ghana Heritage Fund (GHF) was created to serve as an endowment for future generation. However, there have been debates in recent times on whether the GHF should be used to fund the Government’s Free Senior High School or even to support the budget during the COVID-19 outbreak. So far, the government has not been successful in convincing civil society, the opposition in Parliament and academia on the need to use the GHF now.

Design/methodology/approach: Abiding by the participatory design tenets of creativity, learning-by-doing and mutual learning, the BD methodology was created for the specific purpose of fostering meaningful communication and interaction between two disparate groups. Previous iterations of BD are discussed, including its naissance with intergenerational teams, its adaptation to provide a framework for a university-wide initiative, the Faculty Information Technology (IT) Liaison Program that brought together faculty members and IT professional staff, and its current use in helping public librarians to develop with older adults, targeted library programming and services. Findings: Analysis of the findings from the assessment of the BD methodology in different physical contexts demonstrates that the flexibility in the makeup and order of design techniques (discussion, evaluation, brainstorming, prototyping, consensus-building) makes BD potentially adaptable to online spaces. Recommendations for implementing the BD methodology online are outlined. It is argued that BD’s adaptability makes it an ideal method for creating meaningful and productive collaborations within both physical and virtual environments. Originality/value: The proposed iteration of the BD methodology responds to a need for innovative practices to foster collaborative work in a virtual environment. BD is a unique, inclusive and cost-effective methodology to encourage meaningful interaction and communication between disparate groups in physical or online contexts. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Nesset, V.; Davis, E.

This effect is greater on people with ASD (ASD) and their families. Depression, attempts to cope with change, and having difficulty interacting with others are some of the challenges people with ASD often face. The aim of this study was to review the psycho-social consequences of COVID-19 in people with ASD and their families. Methods: This study is a Literature Review. Extensive electronic search results for the keywords ASD, COVID-19, Coronavirus, psychological, psychosocial, and consequence in Google Scholar, PubMed, Scopus, ProQuest, Science Direct, SID and Magiran in 2020, eventually provided a total of 130 articles. After reviewing the titles of the articles, we excluded 85 articles as they were duplicated and/or irrelevant. Finally, based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 17 articles remained. Results: In general, the change in routine and uncertainty caused by COVID-19 have caused distress for people with ASD and will worsen their symptoms and mental health. Excessive stress worsens the mental health of caregivers, and as this burden increases, they report higher rates of social harm, depression, and anxiety that affect their daily functioning. Conclusion: The COVID-19 epidemic affects all strata of society. People with ASD are particularly vulnerable to the psychosocial effects of this epidemic. COVID-19 increases anxiety, distress, depression, financial problems, loss of a job, and even marital conflict. Access to necessary services and transmission problems are also the result of rapid social and environmental changes. © Iran University of Medical Sciences","Aarabi, M. A.; Abdi, K.; Khanjani, M.

However, no COVID-19 prediction model in the existing literature has been found to be reliable. Models are commonly assessed to have a risk of bias, often due to insufficient reporting, use of non-representative data, and lack of large-scale external validation. In this paper, we present the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) analytics pipeline for patient-level prediction as a standardized approach for rapid yet reliable development and validation of prediction models. We demonstrate how our analytics pipeline and open-source software can be used to answer important prediction questions while limiting potential causes of bias (e.g., by validating phenotypes, specifying the target population, performing large-scale external validation and publicly providing all analytical source code). Methods: We show step-by-step how to implement the pipeline for the question: In patients hospitalized with COVID-19, what is the risk of death 0 to 30 days after hospitalization. We develop models using six different machine learning methods in a US claims database containing over 20,000 COVID-19 hospitalizations and externally validate the models using data containing over 45,000 COVID-19 hospitalizations from South Korea, Spain, and the US. Results: Our open-source tools enabled us to efficiently go end-to-end from problem design to reliable model development and evaluation. When predicting death in patients hospitalized for COVID-19 adaBoost, random forest, gradient boosting machine, and decision tree yielded similar or lower internal and external validation discrimination performance compared to L1-regularized logistic regression, whereas the MLP neural network consistently resulted in lower discrimination. L1-regularized logistic regression models were well calibrated. Conclusion: Our results show that following the OHDSI analytics pipeline for patient-level prediction can enable the rapid development towards reliable prediction models. The OHDSI tools and pipeline are open source and available to researchers around the world.","Khalid, S.; Yang, C.; Blacketer, C.; Duarte-Salles, T.; Fernandez-Bertolin, S.; Kim, C.; Park, R.

Here we present a statistical model for 1 year predictions of the GS path (represented by the GS northern wall-GSNW) between 75 degrees W and 65 degrees W incorporating both mechanisms in a combined framework. An existing model with multiple parameters including the previous year's GSNW index, center location, and amplitude of the Icelandic Low and the Southern Oscillation Index was augmented with basin-wide Ekman drift over the Azores High. The addition of the wind is supported by a validation of the simpler two-layer Parsons-Veronis model of GS separation over the last 40 years. A multivariate analysis was carried out to compare 1-year-in-advance forecast correlations from four different models. The optimal predictors of the best performing model include: (a) the GSNW index from the previous year, (b) gyre-scale integrated Ekman Drift over the past 2 years, and (c) longitude of the Icelandic Low center lagged by 3 years. The forecast correlation over the 27 years (1994-2020) is 0.65, an improvement from the previous multi-parameter model's forecast correlation of 0.52. The improvement is attributed to the addition of the wind-drift component. The sensitivity of forecasting the GS path after extreme atmospheric years is quantified. Results indicate the possibility of better understanding and enhanced predictability of the dominant wind-driven variability of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation and of fisheries management models that use the GS path as a metric.","Silver, A.; Gangopadhyay, A.; Gawarkiewicz, G.; Taylor, A.; Sanchez-Franks, A.",Journal of Geophysical Research-Oceans,430,16

However, a major challenge that has limited the effectiveness of current vaccine candidates is the extensive global diversity of HIV-1 Env, the sole target for HIV-neutralizing antibodies. To address this challenge, a variety of strategies to incorporate Env diversity into the vaccine formulation have been proposed. Here, we assessed the potential of two such strategies that utilize a nanoparticle-based vaccine platform to elicit broadly neutralizing antibody responses. The nanoparticle immunogens developed here consisted of different formulations of Envs from strains BG505 (clade A) and CZA97 (clade C), attached to the N-termini of bacterial ferritin. Single-antigen nanoparticle cocktails as well as mosaic nanoparticles bearing both Env trimers elicited high antibody titers in mice and guinea pigs. Furthermore, serum from guinea pigs immunized with nanoparticle immunogens achieved autologous, and in some cases heterologous, tier 2 neutralization, although significant differences between mosaic and single-antigen nanoparticles were not observed. These results provide insights into the ability of different vaccine strategies for incorporating Env sequence diversity to elicit neutralizing antibodies, with implications for the development of broadly protective HIV-1 vaccines.","Murji, Amyn A.; Qin, Juliana S.; Hermanus, Tandile; Morris, Lynn; Georgiev, Ivelin S.",bioRxiv,430,7

In the most critical moments, tourism activities were cancelled or reduced to their minimum operation, creating an extreme situation of separation of a country’s heritage from residents and tourists. The objective of this work is to propose new options and strategies to reconnect the public with heritage under any circumstance and, at the same time, offer tourism services in healthy, secure conditions. Thus, live-streaming experiences of online interpretative tourist guidance were developed in heritage spaces;those visits were led by real guide-interpreters in a real environment and transmitted for remote visitors. We have called this visiting model the “Avatar Tourist Visit”. It is based on tools associated with Heritage Interpretation, Interpersonal Communication, Filmmaking and Audio-Visual Language, and Information and Communication Technologies.

Emerging themes relate to ramification, transformation and adaptation. The aim of this paper is to contribute to the research cluster on adaptation by examining tourism business adaptive responses to COVID-19 through the lens of a case study destination in the global South, namely Bushbuckridge in Mpumalanga Province, South Africa. The methods implemented were qualitative, using semi-structured interviews. Data was analysed from 20 interviews conducted with enterprise owners or managers in a nature tourism destination which is one of South Africa's tourism-dependent areas and thus most exposed to the negative impacts of COVID-19. The results show that adaptation to the crisis has been challenging because of the financial impacts experienced by these enterprises in the wake of minimal government support. The enterprise adaptive responses included staff reductions and wage cuts, adjustments towards the domestic market through price cutting and changes in marketing as well as adjusted tourism product offerings towards an emerging Black middle class domestic market. Of critical importance is the finding that these adaptive measures cannot replace the revenues formerly generated from the international tourism market. Accordingly, without a change in government policy and the availability of direct government financial support, there is a danger that in the short term the tourism product base will be diminished as many lodges and other tourism businesses are in danger of permanent closure. © 2021 Editura Universitatii din Oradea.

The pandemic in fact burst into private, social and working lives of all human beings. In telling a year-long story, my intent is to share what happened in my subjective reality, and my work as an analyst in Italy. The unsettling storm in the beginning, the vortex of changes in the setting, and the inner earthquake of questions and uncertainties, are feelings and experiences that are likely to recall analogies, memories or nightmares. My therapeutic work, at the time, focused on the pondered yet unthought processing and transformation of the sessions, in a dance between an ancient certainty and a new uncertainty, yet to experiment. In the ancient certainty lies the therapeutic dyad with its own subjectivity, story, and the need to be empathic and affective witnesses when it’s the hardest. In the uncertainty of the new, I have discovered the capability and the fear of losing myself, searching for an opening to be with my patients again, in the various paths, in similarities and differences, in shared pain and surprise.

Time course analysis showed that cryoinjury of the gills triggered an inflammatory response, extensive cell death and collagen deposition at the site of injury. However, the inflammation was rapidly resolved, collagen accumulation dissipated and by 3 weeks after injury the affected gill tissue had begun to regenerate. RNA seq analysis of cryoinjured gills, combined with a comparison of zebrafish heart cryoinjury and caudal fin resection datasets, highlighted the differences and similarities of the transcriptional programmes deployed in response to injury in these three zebrafish models. Comparative RNA seq analysis of cryoinjured zebrafish gills with mouse pulmonary fibrosis datasets also identified target genes, including the understudied FIBIN, as differentially expressed in the two species. Further mining, including of human datasets, suggests that FIBIN may contribute to the successful resolution of tissue damage without fibrosis.","Ramel, Marie-Christine; Progatzky, Fränze; Rydlova, Anna; Wane, Madina; Schymeinsky, Jürgen; Williams, Cara; Jung, Birgit; Lamb, Jonathan; Thomas, Matthew J; Bugeon, Laurence; Dallman, Margaret J.",bioRxiv,430,1

This is especially true for those with cancer because they face higher morbidity and mortality from COVID-19. At the same time, the disproportionate impact of the pandemic on Latinx populations underscores the need for information to reach Spanishspeakers. Given the large proportion of Spanish-speakers in the U.S., healthcare institutions have a professional and moral obligation to meet this critical need. Methods: We conducted a multi-modal, mixed method document review study to evaluate the equity of online information about COVID and cancer available to English- and Spanish-speakers from seven north Texas healthcare institutions. We sampled 50 websites (33 English, 17 Spanish) over a one-week period in May 2020. Websites included 27 healthcare institutions and 23 external organizations (e.g. CDC). Thematic content was analyzed using a coding conversion process;literacy level was measured using Readability software;accessibility was measured using the Patient Education and Materials Assessment Tool (PEMAT);and video and diversity content were defined and counted. Results: Content on Spanish websites was sub-optimal compared to English. We observed significant differences in thematic content, poor linkage to external Spanish content, and errors in translation. Whether differences were intentional was unclear. Across all sites, content specifically about COVID and cancer was more prevalent in English than Spanish (58% vs. 43%). Three institutions' websites contained no information about COVID specifically for cancer patients, and three institutions included only a banner link to COVID updates or information from their main oncology page. Only one institution's website included comprehensive COVID-related information specifically for cancer patients, such as postponing treatment, oral cancer treatments, and extra assurances taken for protection during in-person care;however, this website was available in English only. Spanish websites scored on average at a lower literacy level than English (11 vs. 13 grade). Using the PEMAT, healthcare institutions' average accessibility of Spanish pages (n = 7) was slightly lower than that of English pages (n = 19) (77% vs. 81%, respectively), due mostly to discrepancies in English-only videos and visual aids;conversely, among external organizations' websites, the average accessibility score of Spanish pages (n = 10) was higher than that of English pages (n = 13) (86% vs. 83%, respectively). Conclusions: In one region, Spanish-speakers lack equitable access to information about COVID-19 and cancer compared with English-speakers, leaving an already vulnerable patient population at greater risk for poor health outcomes.

Immune polarization plays a major role in determining the outcome of Leishmania infections: hosts displaying M1-polarized macrophages are protected, while those biased on the M2 side acquire a chronic infection, that could develop into an overt and potentially deadly disease. The identification of the factors involved in M1 polarization is essential for the design of therapeutic and prophylactic interventions, including vaccines. Infection by the filarial nematode Dirofilaria immitis could be one of the factors that interfere with leishmaniasis in dogs. Indeed, filarial nematodes induce a partial skew of the immune response towards M1, likely caused by their bacterial endosymbionts, Wolbachia. Here we have examined the potential of AsaiaWSP, a bacterium engineered for the expression of the Wolbachia surface protein (WSP), as an inductor of M1 macrophage activation and Leishmania killing. Macrophages stimulated with AsaiaWSP displayed a strong leishmanicidal activity, comparable to that determined by the choice-drug amphotericin B. Additionally, AsaiaWSP determined the expression of markers of classical macrophage activation, including M1 cytokines, ROS and NO, and an increase in phagocytosis activity. Asaia not expressing WSP also induced macrophage activation, although at a lower extent compared to AsaiaWSP. In summary, our study, while providing a strong evidence for the immune-stimulating properties of Wolbachia, highlights the translational potential of AsaiaWSP in the areas of the immune-prophylaxis and therapy of leishmaniases, as well as of other diseases that could be subverted by M1 macrophage activation.","Varotto-Boccazzi, Ilaria; Epis, Sara; Arnoldi, Irene; Corbett, Yolanda; Gabrieli, Paolo; Paroni, Moira; Nodari, Riccardo; Basilico, Nicoletta; Sacchi, Luciano; Gramiccia, Marina; Gradoni, Luigi; Tranquillo, Vito; Bandi, Claudio",bioRxiv,430,1

As such, IgA plays a key role in protection against a variety of mucosal pathogens, including viruses. In addition to neutralizing viruses directly, IgA can also stimulate Fc-dependent effector functions via engagement of Fc alpha receptors (FcαRI) expressed on the surface of certain immune effector cells. Neutrophils are the most abundant leukocyte, express FcαRI, and are often the first to respond to sites of injury and infection. Here, we describe a novel function for IgA:virus immune complexes (ICs) during viral infections. We show that IgA:virus ICs potentiate NETosis – the programmed cell death pathway through which neutrophils release neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). Mechanistically, IgA:virus ICs potentiated a suicidal NETosis pathway via engagement of FcαRI on neutrophils through a toll-like receptor (TLR)-independent, NADPH oxidase complex-dependent pathway. NETs also were capable of trapping and inactivating viruses, consistent with an antiviral function.","Stacey, Hannah D.; Golubeva, Diana; Posca, Alyssa; Ang, Jann C.; Novakowski, Kyle E.; Zahoor, Muhammad Atif; Kaushic, Charu; Cairns, Ewa; Bowdish, Dawn M.

Recommendations have been introduced to reduce the transmission risk of virulent airborne viral particles by increasing ventilation rates, expressed in air-changes-per-hour (ACH), effectively improving the dilution of airborne pathogens via mechanical ventilation. However, the infrastructural and operational costs associated with upgrades of Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems make these solutions expensive. It is well documented that UVC disinfection can help lower exposure risks by inactivating viruses in shared enclosed spaces, and the performances of such solutions be translated into equivalent ventilation (equivalent ACH or eACH). Here, we present the first framework to extract the optimum UVC output requirements for a target eACH, and improve facilities ability to comply with ventilation guidelines at lower energy costs. The Kahn-Mariita (KM) model considers the air quality of a shared enclosed space over time by supplementing existing mechanical ventilation with localized UVC air treatment, whether in recirculating units or upper-air systems, and extracts the systems requirements based on end-user needs by incorporating variables such as room size, occupancy, existing ventilation, and target eACH. An example of a conference room shows that a UVC chamber with an air recirculation rate of 160m3/h increases the ventilation from ACH=3 to eACH=7.9 and reduce down-time from 46 minutes to <10 minutes with as little 1W of UVC output. A recirculation rate of 30m3/h however offers no noticeable benefits above 200mW, with a maximum reachable eACH=3.9 and down-time of approximately 31 minutes. The KM model is unique in that it allows for the first time to find the optimum UVC output needs to ensure air quality is maintained and transmission risk minimized, while increasing energy savings. Recent studies suggest mechanically increasing fresh air supply will more than double the energy costs of HVAC systems, while the use of UVC reduces energy demand as much as by 50%. The KM model approaches air quality and energy efficiency in a unified way by incorporating UVC as a supplement to existing ventilation to increase eACH, reduce down-time, and increase the closed space occupancy.","Kahn, K.; Mariita, R.

However, regulation of these tests is lacking, and the quality of services is variable, with potential short- and long-term personal, clinical and public health implications. This study aimed to evaluate online tests available in the UK against national standards. Methods: Providers of online STI tests (self-sampling and self-testing) in the UK were identified by an internet search of Google and Amazon (June 2020). Website information on tests and care was collected, and further information requested from providers via an online survey, sent twice (July 2020, April 2021). The information obtained was compared to British Association for Sexual Health and HIV (BASHH) guidelines for diagnostics and standards of STI management. Results: 31 providers were identified: 13 self-test, 18-self-sample, and two laboratories that serviced multiple providers. Seven responded to the online survey.

Three months later, the highly contagious coronavirus disease, Covid-19, was declared a pandemic. Covid-19 is caused by a novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, that in March 2021 has infected more than 120 million people worldwide and killed more than 2.7 million. Covid-19 has been the deadliest pandemic to arise since the 1918 Spanish flu, shutting down economies and societies worldwide. Covid-19 caused patients to neglect routine visitations to their healthcare providers, out of fear of catching the disease. Fortunately, within our arsenal exist great tools to limit transmission of Covid-19, including face masks and persistent decontamination of surfaces. They have allowed the population to safely return to work and feel safer when visiting their healthcare providers. Arguably, dental workers and patients face a great risk. Although dental workers are appropriately masked during procedures, patients cannot be masked. With 50% of Covid-19 patients presenting as asymptomatic, contamination of dental clinics with SARS-CoV-2 is a genuine concern. An unmasked patient undergoing routine dental procedures can easily spread saliva containing SARS-CoV-2 across dental clinics, which may facilitate transmission of Covid-19. Therefore, an effective decontamination method, such as ultraviolet C (UVC) light, capable of inactivating SARS-CoV-2 on different surfaces as well as within aerosols, may warranted lower the risk of transmission within the dental clinic. In this review, we propose to discuss the studies that have investigated the potential for UVC to decontaminate face masks, surfaces, and aerosols, with a focus on how these may be applied to the dental clinic.","Leanse, L.

The questions concerned evaluation of threats, risks and acute problems faced by the students and their closest people in the situation of COVID-19 spread. We determined the anxiety level of the students by the degree of their concern about high risk of COVID-19 infection.ResultsWe established that 17.1% of the students had maximal level of COVID-19-related anxiety that correlated with older age (r=.13), better academic performance (r=.12), expectation of higher COVID-19-related threat to their life (r=.57), to the closest people’s health (r=.44), to the aged people’s lives (r=.16). It correlated with a more serious approach to evaluating the COVID-19-related situation and dangers in the world (r=.19), in the country (r=.24), and in the region of their residence (r=.37). Students with a high anxiety level often saw in pandemic a threat to their way of life (r=.12), material wellbeing (r=.12), and plans for the future (r=.11).

Methods and Results Enveloped RNA bacteriophage Phi6 (Φ6) was dried on wiring insulation, aircraft performance coating (APC), polypropylene, and nylon at ≥ 8 log10 plaque-forming units (PFU) test coupon-1. Only 2.4 log10 inactivation was measured on APC at 70°Celsius (°C), 5% relative humidity (RH) after 24 h. In contrast, HHA RSM models showed a 90% probability of a 7-log10 inactivation at ≥63°C, 90% RH after 1 h, and decontamination kinetics were similar across different materials. HHA decontamination of C-130 and C-17 aircraft showed >7 log10 and ≥5.9 log10 inactivation of enveloped virus on 100 and 110 test indicators, respectively, with a 1-h treatment, excluding ramp-up and ramp-down times. Conclusions Enveloped RNA virus test indicators were successfully developed, lab tested for HHA decontamination, analyzed for RSM, and field-tested in aircraft demonstrations.

Although DEA-workflows are well established, preceding reliability-testing of the input material, which is crucial for consistent and strong results, is challenging and less straightforward. Here we present Biological Sequence Expression Kit (BiSEK), a graphical user interface-based platform for DEA, dedicated to a reliable inquiry. BiSEK is based on a novel algorithm to track discrepancies between the data and the statistical model design. Moreover, BiSEK enables differential-expression analysis of groups of genes, to identify affected pathways, without relying on the significance of genes comprising them. Using BiSEK, we were able to improve previously conducted analysis, aimed to detect genes affected by FUBP1 depletion in chronic myeloid leukemia cells of mice bone-marrow. We found affected genes that are related to the regulation of apoptosis, supporting in-vivo experimental findings. We further tested the host response following SARS-CoV-2 infection. We identified a substantial interferon-I reaction and low expression levels of TLR3, an inducer of interferon-III (IFN-III) production, upon infection with SARS-CoV-2 compared to other respiratory viruses. This finding may explain the low IFN-III response upon SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Negative attitude (perceived barriers) and others’ behavior (descriptive social norms) were revealed as significant predictors for both intention to over-purchase and the actual stockpiling behavior. The lack of significance obtained for perceived behavioral control (PBC) is also an important result, strengthening the evidence that factors’ contribution to TPB’s predictive power is strongly context-dependent, respectively that PBC is less relevant in settings dominated by uncertainty. The lack of significance is especially compelling when stockpiling behavior is regarded as deviant conduct from effective consumption.

Schools are legally bound (IDEA, 2004) to support eligible students with Individualized Education Program (IEP) informed instruction and related services (e.g. assistive technology, speechlanguage, physical, or occupational therapy) to foster academic success. However, these service provision were not designed under the constraints of remote learning. The COVID19 shift to remote learning is likely to extend beyond the pandemic especially for medically fragile students. This quality improvement project describes challenges for survivors during remote learning and recently developed related patient education materials. Methods: Interviews with families were used to identify themes around challenges during remote learning, which informed development of a 29-question survey disseminated via flyer in local oncology clinics and social media posts by local childhood cancer organizations in Fall 2020. Results: The survey was completed by 67 parents describing their affected child (mean age= 8.6 years;60% male;78% White, 12% Black, 95% non-Hispanic). Most children (74%) had completed therapy (43% for leukemia, 18% for brain tumor;39% other). The majority (86%) attended public school and 37% received special education or related services: speech-language (26%), occupational (23%), and physical (14%) therapies, and vision services (3%). Fully remote learning was reported for 73%, in-person 4%, and hybrid learning for 14%. The majority (57%) reported observing greater difficulty with attention and focus during RL, indicating difficulty occurred about half of the time during related services therapies, class and/or small group video instruction. Technologyrelated challenges included difficulty navigating online instruction/equipment (28%), reading difficulty (16%), and difficulty seeing materials/lack of vision supports (18%). Findings did not differ based on treatment or IEP status (p&gt;0.50). Few (14%) reported their school team discussed assistive technology options for online learning. Parents indicated the most helpful supports for addressing challenges included speech-to-text tools, screen readers, and audio books. Parents reported their oncology team was helpful in making referrals to neuropsychology and therapies and completing documentation necessary to secure supports. Conclusions:Childhood cancer survivors, irrespective of diagnosis or IEP status, report challenges with remote learning. Families find a lack of information or special accommodations as roadblocks to success.

METHODS The average medical cost per person/day was calculated on 1272 SARS cases with complete hospitalization data from the Beijing SARS clinical database. Factors associated with medical expenditure were explored by both single factor and multi-factor analyses. RESULTS The medical costs of SARS patients in Beijing were 18 767.50 RMB/case and 632.02 RMB/day/case. Expenses on medication accounted for the highest proportion (0.66%). The increase in expenses on medication was significantly associated to the increase in total expenditure. Analyses by single factor, factor stratification as well as multi-factor analyses showed that: the expenditure increased significantly with the following factors of the patients: prolonged days of hospitalization, severe symptoms and signs, hospitalization at the early stage of disease onset, being medical staff themselves, with baseline diseases, being applied mechanical ventilation, and with medical insurance. CONCLUSIONS The medical expenditure on SARS patients at the hospital was higher than that on patients with common diseases which was associated to the following factors as: days of hospitalization, severity of disease, stage of the disease break-out, patient's occupation, baseline disease status, medical insurance status etc.","Xiao, Feng; Chen, Bo-wen; Wu, Yang-feng; Wang, Yue-xiang; Han, De-min",Zhonghua liu xing bing xue za zhi = Zhonghua liuxingbingxue zazhi,430,23

The results indicated that Taiwanese IBV strains could be divided into two distinct lineages, Taiwan Group I and Taiwan Group II, with one Massachusetts strain and one Chinese strain. No recombination was found between H120 and the Taiwanese strains in the S1 gene. However, the S1 gene showed a noticeably higher divergence than the N gene.

We focused on visits for respiratory illness (SARS-like symptoms) and different age groups. METHODS This study is a retrospective review of ED discharge diagnoses obtained from a computerized database, examining the 4-week period starting March 28 for the years 2001-2004. We obtained the discharge diagnosis, age and visit date for each ED patient during the relevant time intervals, then compared visit data from 2003 and 2004 with a baseline derived from the average number of visits during 2001 and 2002. We constructed groupings based on age and respiratory-illness symptoms. RESULTS During the SARS outbreak in 2003, ED visits declined by 21% (95% confidence interval [CI], 18%-24%) over the 4-week study period. The greatest reduction was for combined infant and toddler visits (69%; 95% CI, 58%-79%); these did not recover the following year. However, during the SARS outbreak there was a large increase in the number of visits for respiratory illnesses in adults (61%; 95% CI, 46%-75%) and in teenagers (132%; 95% CI, 82%-182%). CONCLUSIONS During the SARS outbreak, total ED visits fell. The relative decline was most notable for infants and toddlers. By contrast, there was an increase in respiratory illness-related visits for adults and teenagers. In 2004, the year following the SARS outbreak, visit patterns shifted toward baseline levels, but ED visits by infants and toddlers remained depressed.","Heiber, Michael; Lou, W Y Wendy",CJEM,430,1

We now describe a series of patients that did not fit World Health Organisation (WHO) case definitions for SARS at initial assessment. METHODS The Ministry of Health, Singapore centralised SARS cases in the study hospital and its emergency department (ED) became the national screening centre. A screening questionnaire and a set of admission criteria based on WHO case definitions were applied. Patients discharged from ED were tracked via telephone surveillance and recalled if necessary. A retrospective review was done of patients who did not fit WHO definitions initially, were discharged and had re-attended. RESULTS During the outbreak, 11,461 people were screened for SARS. Among 10,075 (87.9 percent) discharged from the ED, there were 28 re-attendees diagnosed to have SARS later, giving an undertriage rate of 0.3 percent. Among the 28, six (21.4 percent) did not complain of fever and 22 (78.6 percent) had temperatures less than 38.0 degrees Celsius during their first ED visit. One patient was screened to have all three criteria but during consultation, the contact history was found to be unrelated to the known ""hot spots"". The initial mean temperature was 37.6 degrees Celsius (standard deviation [SD] 0.8), which increased significantly (p-value equals 0.04) to 38.0 degrees Celsius (SD 0.8) during their subsequent visit. Chest radiographs with infective changes increased significantly (p-value equals 0.009) from 16 percent to 52.4 percent over the two ED visits. CONCLUSION The WHO case definitions were helpful in evaluating majority of SARS patients initially. However under-triage at ED is inevitable, with a 0.3 percent under-triage in our study population. In this group and asymptomatic individuals who came for screening, a tracking and recall system helped to ensure their timely return to the ED.","Goh, H K; Tham, K Y; Seow, E",Singapore medical journal,430,17

Although glycyrrhizin which exhibited in vivo efficacy against HSV-1 replication showed moderate in vitro anti-HSV-1 activity, its sapogenol, glycyrrhetic acid, showed 10 times greater action than glycyrrhizin. Therefore, the in vivo anti-HSV-1 activity of glycyrrhizin administered orally could be reasonably attributed to glycyrrhetic acid generated by hydrolysis by intestinal bacteria. Since the activity of soyasapogenol A was less than 1/20 of that of soyasapogenol B, the hydroxylation at C-21 seemed to reduce anti-HSV-1 activity. Since kudzusapogenol A, abrisapogenols B and C lacked the activity, the C-29 hydroxy group would eliminate anti-HSV-1 activity. On the other hand, since the methylesters of kudzusapogenol B and glycyrrhetic acid exhibited greater action, a methoxy carboxy group at C-20 might enhance activity.","Ikeda, Tsuyoshi; Yokomizo, Kazumi; Okawa, Masafumi; Tsuchihashi, Ryota; Kinjo, Junei; Nohara, Toshihiro; Uyeda, Masaru",Biological & pharmaceutical bulletin,430,16

At their 3' ends, they contain a poly(A) tail. Although cellular and viral mRNAs are structurally similar, influenza virus promotes the selective translation of its mRNAs despite the inhibition of host cell protein synthesis. The viral polymerase performs the cap snatching and binds selectively to the 5' common viral sequence. As viral mRNAs are recognized by their own cap-binding complex, we tested whether viral mRNA translation occurs without the contribution of the eIF4E protein, the cellular factor required for cap-dependent translation. Here, we show that influenza virus infection proceeds normally in different situations of functional impairment of the eIF4E factor. In addition, influenza virus polymerase binds to translation preinitiation complexes, and furthermore, under conditions of decreased eIF4GI association to cap structures, an increase in eIF4GI binding to these structures was found upon influenza virus infection. This is the first report providing evidence that influenza virus mRNA translation proceeds independently of a fully active translation initiation factor (eIF4E). The data reported are in agreement with a role of viral polymerase as a substitute for the eIF4E factor for viral mRNA translation.","Burgui, Idoia; Yángüez, Emilio; Sonenberg, Nahum; Nieto, Amelia",Journal of virology,430,1

HPS has a mortality rate of 40% and, unlike many other severe respiratory diseases, often occurs in young, healthy adults. Infection is usually initiated after inhalation of rodent excreta containing virus particles, but human-to-human transmission has been documented. Postmortem tissue samples show high levels of viral antigen within the respiratory endothelium, but it is not clear how the virus can traverse the respiratory epithelium in order to initiate infection in the microvasculature. We have utilized Andes virus infection of primary, differentiated airway epithelial cells to investigate the ability of the virus to interact with and cross the respiratory epithelium. Andes virus infects the Clara and goblet cell populations but not the ciliated cells, and this infection pattern corresponds to the expression of beta(3) integrin, the viral receptor. The virus can infect via the apical or basolateral membrane, and progeny virus particles are secreted bidirectionally. There is no obvious cytopathology associated with infection, and beta(3) integrins do not appear to be critical for respiratory epithelial cell monolayer integrity. Our data suggest that hantavirus infection of the respiratory epithelium may play an important role in the early or prodrome phase of disease as well as serving as a source of virus involved in transmission.","Rowe, Regina K; Pekosz, Andrew",Journal of virology,430,9

However, post-HCT infections remain a concern for HCT recipients, particularly infections caused by community respiratory viruses (CRVs), which can lead to significant morbidity and mortality. These viruses can potentially cause lower respiratory tract illness, which is associated with a higher mortality rate among HCT recipients. Clinical management of CRV infections in HCT recipients includes supportive care and antiviral therapy, especially in high-risk individuals, when available. Directed antiviral therapy is only available for influenza infections, where successful use of neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir or zanamivir) and/or M2 inhibitors (amantadine or rimantadine) has been reported. Data on the successful use of ribavirin, with or without immunomodulators, for respiratory syncytial virus infections in HCT recipients has emerged over the past 2 decades but is still controversial at best because of a lack of randomized controlled trials. Because of the lack of directed antiviral therapy for most of these viruses, prevention should be emphasized for healthcare workers, patients, family, and friends and should include the promotion of the licensed inactivated influenza vaccine for HCT recipients, when indicated. In this review, we discuss the clinical management of respiratory viruses in this special patient population, focusing on commercially available antivirals, adjuvant therapy, and novel drugs under investigation, as well as on available means for prevention.","Shah, Dimpy P; Ghantoji, Shashank S; Mulanovich, Victor E; Ariza-Heredia, Ella J; Chemaly, Roy F",American journal of blood research,430,19

197633,197633,197633,COVID-19 Pandemic: Nephrology Experiences - Voices from the Frontlines: Part 1.,14.825287,4.792506,2020,"BACKGROUND The receptor for the murine coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV)-A59, called MHVR or Bgp1a, is a glycoprotein in the carcinoembryonic antigen family of the Ig superfamily. Biliary glycoprotein (Bgp) isoforms play a role in cell adhesion, bile acid transport, and ecto-ATPase activity. MHV-resistant SJL/J mice express a different allele of Bgp1 called Bgp1b. Analysis of the tissue and cellular distribution of Bgp1 proteins can therefore provide new insight on both cellular functions and MHV-A59--induced pathogenesis. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN Bgp1 expression was analyzed in the digestive, respiratory, endocrine, urinary, and central nervous systems of adult BALB/c and SJL/J mice by immunocytochemistry and immunoelectron microscopy using a monoclonal Ab specific for the N-terminal domain of the Bgp1a proteins and polyclonal rabbit anti-Bgp1, which recognizes both the Bgp1a and Bgp1b proteins. The function of Bgp1 proteins as viral receptors was tested on tissue sections by a virus binding assay. MHV-A59 replication was analyzed by immunocytochemistry. RESULTS Bgp1 expression was observed on membranes of epithelial cells (including hepatocytes, intestinal, endocrine, and respiratory epithelial cells), kidney proximal tubules, and endothelial cells in many tissues. It was usually localized at the apical pole of the cells and, when present, on the brush borders and the cilia. A new direct virus binding assay showed that MHV attachment onto cells correlates with Bgp1 expression. Viral infection was detected in hepatocytes, lymphoid tissue, and the exocrine pancreas but not in endocrine cells, enterocytes, kidney, or respiratory cells. In the central nervous system, no immunolabeling of neurons or glial cells was found with anti-Bgp1 Ab. CONCLUSIONS Bgp1 proteins are present on BALB/c and SJL/J epithelia and endothelia. These glycoproteins might be involved in cell-to-cell contacts, for example between hepatocytes. On BALB/c mice, Bgp1a expression is consistent with the tropism of MHV-A59 for the liver. However, Bgp1a was also expressed on cells that were not infected by MHV-A59.","Godfraind, C; Langreth, S G; Cardellichio, C B; Knobler, R; Coutelier, J P; Dubois-Dalcq, M; Holmes, K V",Laboratory investigation; a journal of technical methods and pathology,430,28

Previously, we showed that SARS-CoV PLpro processes the replicase polyprotein at three conserved cleavage sites. Here, we report the identification and characterization of a 316-amino-acid catalytic core domain of PLpro that can efficiently cleave replicase substrates in trans-cleavage assays and peptide substrates in fluorescent resonance energy transfer-based protease assays. We performed bioinformatics analysis on 16 papain-like protease domains from nine different coronaviruses and identified a putative catalytic triad (Cys1651-His1812-Asp1826) and zinc-binding site. Mutagenesis studies revealed that Asp1826 and the four cysteine residues involved in zinc binding are essential for SARS-CoV PLpro activity. Molecular modeling of SARS-CoV PLpro suggested that this catalytic core may also have deubiquitinating activity. We tested this hypothesis by measuring the deubiquitinating activity of PLpro by two independent assays. SARS CoV-PLpro hydrolyzed both diubiquitin and ubiquitin-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (AMC) substrates, and hydrolysis of ubiquitin-AMC is approximately 180-fold more efficient than hydrolysis of a peptide substrate that mimics the PLpro replicase recognition sequence. To investigate the critical determinants recognized by PLpro, we performed site-directed mutagenesis on the P6 to P2' residues at each of the three PLpro cleavage sites. We found that PLpro recognizes the consensus cleavage sequence LXGG, which is also the consensus sequence recognized by cellular deubiquitinating enzymes. This similarity in the substrate recognition sites should be considered during the development of SARS-CoV PLpro inhibitors.","Barretto, Naina; Jukneliene, Dalia; Ratia, Kiira; Chen, Zhongbin; Mesecar, Andrew D; Baker, Susan C",Journal of virology,430,1

The cytotoxicity of a tethered dimer HIV protease described previously is particularly severe that transformed Escherichia coli cells could not survive the bactericidal activity of the low-level protease produced under uninduced conditions. The presence of HIV protease inhibitors protected the transformed cells from cytotoxic effects and allowed the growth of these cells on plates and in broth. A high throughput screening method was developed to seek compounds that served as ""growth factors"" for the HIV protease restricted cells. Several compounds identified by this screening supported the growth of these cells, preserved their viability, and inhibited HIV protease. This assay could be used as a general method for screening for inhibitors of recombinant enzymes that produce a cytotoxic phenotype in host cells.","Cheng, Yih-Shyun E; Lo, Kien-Hock; Hsu, Hsien-Hua; Shao, Yi-Ming; Yang, Wen-Bin; Lin, Chun-Hung; Wong, Chi-Huey",Journal of virological methods,430,28

Following self-determination theory (SDT), the present research seeks to identify characteristics that relate to well-being in terms of positive emotion and intrinsic learning motivation under distance schooling conditions and whether SDT's core postulates hold true in this exceptional situation. Feeling competent and autonomous concerning schoolwork, and socially related to others were hypothesised to relate to positive emotion and intrinsic learning motivation. The role of self-regulated learning (SRL) as a moderator was considered. Self-reports were collected from 19,967 secondary school students in Austria (Study 1) and Germany (Study 2). In both studies, structural equation modelling revealed that all basic needs were associated with positive emotion, and that competence and autonomy were associated with intrinsic learning motivation. Moderation effects of SRL were identified in Study 1 only: The association of autonomy and both outcomes and the association of competence and intrinsic learning motivation varied with the level of SRL. The results highlight the relevance of basic psychological need satisfaction and SRL in a situation in which adolescents are confronted with a sudden loss of daily routines.","Holzer, Julia; Lüftenegger, Marko; Käser, Udo; Korlat, Selma; Pelikan, Elisabeth; Schultze-Krumbholz, Anja; Spiel, Christiane; Wachs, Sebastian; Schober, Barbara",,430,27

We build a simple susceptible-infected-recovered model with microeconomic foundations, which allows us to obtain qualitative results with economic implications. In our model, lockdown policies reduce (i) labour income by decreasing working hours and (ii) precautionary savings by decreasing susceptible agents’ probability of getting infected in the future. We qualitatively show that strengthening lockdown measures negatively impacts asset prices at the time of implementation. Our empirical analysis using data from advanced countries supports this finding. Depending on parameter values, our numerical analysis displays a V-shaped recovery of asset prices and an L-shaped recession of consumption. The rapid recovery of asset prices occurs only if the lockdown policies are insufficiently stringent to reduce the number of new periodic cases. This finding implies the possibility that lenient lockdowns have contributed to rapid stock market recovery at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Saito, Yuta Sakamoto Jun",Research in International Business and Finance,430,20

ARDS and systemic manifestations of COVID-19 are mainly due to an exaggerated immune response triggered by the viral infection. Cytokine release syndrome (CRS), an inflammatory syndrome characterized by elevated levels of circulating cytokines, and endothelial dysfunction are systemic manifestations of COVID-19. CRS is also an adverse event of immunotherapy (IMTX), the treatment of diseases using drugs, cells, and antibodies to stimulate or suppress the immune system. Graft-versus-host disease complications after an allogeneic stem cell transplant, toxicity after the infusion of chimeric antigen receptor-T cell therapy and monoclonal antibodies can all lead to CRS. It is hypothesized that anti-inflammatory drugs used for treatment of CRS in IMTX may be useful in reducing the mortality in COVID-19, whereas IMTX itself may help in ameliorating effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this paper, we focused on the potential shared mechanisms and differences between COVID-19 and IMTX-related toxicities. We performed a systematic review of the clinical trials testing anti-inflammatory therapies and of the data published from prospective trials. Preliminary evidence suggests there might be a benefit in targeting the cytokines involved in the pathogenesis of COVID-19, especially by inhibiting the interleukin-6 pathway. Many other approaches based on novel drugs and cell therapies are currently under investigation and may lead to a reduction in hospitalization and mortality due to COVID-19.","Iovino, Lorenzo; Thur, Laurel A; Gnjatic, Sacha; Chapuis, Aude; Milano, Filippo; Hill, Joshua A",J. immunotherap. cancer,430,10

COVID-19's emergence and rapid spread is a global public health and economic crisis. However, investigations into the disease, patient-tracking mechanisms, and case report transmissions are both labor-intensive and slow. OBJECTIVE: The pandemic has overwhelmed health care systems, forcing hospitals and medical facilities to find effective ways to share data. This study aims to design a global infectious disease surveillance and case tracking system that can facilitate the detection and control of COVID-19. METHODS: The International Patient Summary (IPS; an electronic health record that contains essential health care information about a patient) was used. The IPS was designed to support the used case scenario for unplanned cross-border care. The design, scope, utility, and potential for reuse of the IPS for unplanned cross-border care make it suitable for situations like COVID-19. The Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources confirmed that IPS data, which includes symptoms, therapies, medications, and laboratory data, can be efficiently transferred and exchanged on the system for easy access by physicians. To protect privacy, patient data are deidentified. All systems are protected by blockchain architecture, including data encryption, validation, and exchange of records. RESULTS: To achieve worldwide COVID-19 surveillance, a global infectious disease information exchange must be enacted. The COVID-19 surveillance system was designed based on blockchain architecture. The IPS was used to exchange case study information among physicians. After being verified, physicians can upload IPS files and receive IPS data from other global cases. The system includes a daily IPS uploading and enhancement plan, which covers real-time uploading through the interoperation of the clinic system, with the module based on the Open Application Programming Interface architecture. Through the treatment of different cases, drug treatments, and the exchange of treatment results, the disease spread can be controlled, and treatment methods can be funded. In the Infectious Disease Case Tracking module, we can track the moving paths of infectious disease cases. The location information recorded in the blockchain is used to check the locations of different cases. The Case Tracking module was established for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to track cases and prevent disease spread. CONCLUSIONS: We created the IPS of infectious diseases for physicians treating patients with COVID-19. Our system can help health authorities respond quickly to the transmission and spread of unknown diseases, and provides a system for information retrieval on disease transmission. In addition, this system can help researchers form trials and analyze data from different countries. A common forum to facilitate the mutual sharing of experiences, best practices, therapies, useful medications, and clinical intervention outcomes from research in various countries could help control an unknown virus. This system could be an effective tool for global collaboration in evidence-based efforts to fight COVID-19.","Lee, Hsiu-An; Kung, Hsin-Hua; Lee, Yuarn-Jang; Chao, Jane C-J; Udayasankaran, Jai Ganesh; Fan, Hueng-Chuen; Ng, Kwok-Keung; Chang, Yu-Kang; Kijsanayotin, Boonchai; Marcelo, Alvin B; Hsu, Chien-Yeh",JMIR Med Inform,430,10

Within this literature review, we highlight the importance, efficacy, and safely of influenza vaccination in individuals with autoimmune diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), Sjogren syndrome (SS), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in both vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals. Overall, vaccination is generally well tolerated by SLE patients and the literature recommends the inactivated influenza vaccine to SLE patients according to the recommendations and schedules for the general population and annually against seasonal influenza viruses. While the data are still unclear in patients with SS, there does seem to be a general consensus to vaccinate these individuals to prevent harmful risks of influenza disease. In patients with RA and IBD, vaccination efficacy with the inactivated influenza vaccine should be determined on a case-by-case basis, taking patient therapy into account. In light of the current pandemic and global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) crisis, it is crucial to emphasize the safety and immunogenicity of influenza vaccination in vulnerable individuals suffering from autoimmune diseases.

OBJECTIVE: To examine the contribution of the pandemic to parenting stress, exploring differences in parenting stress among new parents before and during the crisis, the role of background and personal variables, and the possibility that the study phase moderated the associations of gender and personal resources with parenting stress. METHOD: Israeli parents (n = 1591) whose first child was 3-12 months old were recruited twice through social media: in 2019, before the spread of COVID-19 (n = 985); and in March 2020, during the pandemic (n = 606). RESULTS: Sociodemographic variables, perception of the childbirth as traumatic, lower meaning in life, higher search for meaning, less marital satisfaction, and study phase all contributed to greater parenting stress. In addition, the association between gender and stress was moderated by study phase, with fathers reporting a greater increase in stress during the pandemic. Moreover, only during the pandemic did fathers report higher parenting stress than mothers. CONCLUSIONS: The findings highlight the vulnerability of new parents of young infants to parenting stress during the crisis, and the special attention which should be paid to fathers.

Our goal was to assess patients' perspectives regarding medication modifications and deviations from planned uses during the height of the pandemic. METHODS: Adult patients of 13 rheumatologists at an academic center with physician-diagnosed rheumatic disease and prescribed disease modifying medications were interviewed by telephone and asked open-ended questions about the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on their medications. Responses were analyzed with content and thematic analyses to generate categories that described patterns of medication modification. RESULTS: 112 patients (mean age 50, 86% women, 34% non-white race or Latino ethnicity) with diverse diagnoses (30% lupus, 26% rheumatoid arthritis, 44% other), taking various medications were enrolled. Patients reported clinically-relevant issues that were iteratively reviewed to generate unique categories of medication modification: medications and increased or decreased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection; role of hydroxychloroquine; maintaining medication status quo; role of glucocorticoids; increasing or decreasing existing medications in relation to clinical disease activity; postponing infusions; and medication plan if infected by SARS-CoV-2. Some modifications were suboptimal for disease control, but were made to mitigate infection risk and to minimize potential harm when patients were unable to obtain laboratory tests and physical examinations due to cessation of in-person office visits. CONCLUSION: During the height of the pandemic, substantial medication modifications were made that, in some cases, were temporizing measures and deviations from planned regimens. Future studies will assess short- and long-term sequelae of these medication modifications.","Mancuso, Carol A; Duculan, Roland; Jannat-Khah, Deanna; Barbhaiya, Medha; Bass, Anne R; Mandl, Lisa A; Mehta, Bella",Arthritis care &amp; research (2010 : Online),430,10

We aimed to determine the seroprevalence and kinetics of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies at population level in Wuhan to inform the development of vaccination strategies. METHODS: In this longitudinal cross-sectional study, we used a multistage, population-stratified, cluster random sampling method to systematically select 100 communities from the 13 districts of Wuhan. Households were systematically selected from each community and all family members were invited to community health-care centres to participate. Eligible individuals were those who had lived in Wuhan for at least 14 days since Dec 1, 2019. All eligible participants who consented to participate completed a standardised electronic questionnaire of demographic and clinical questions and self-reported any symptoms associated with COVID-19 or previous diagnosis of COVID-19. A venous blood sample was taken for immunological testing on April 14-15, 2020. Blood samples were tested for the presence of pan-immunoglobulins, IgM, IgA, and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein and neutralising antibodies were assessed. We did two successive follow-ups between June 11 and June 13, and between Oct 9 and Dec 5, 2020, at which blood samples were taken. FINDINGS: Of 4600 households randomly selected, 3599 families (78·2%) with 9702 individuals attended the baseline visit. 9542 individuals from 3556 families had sufficient samples for analyses. 532 (5·6%) of 9542 participants were positive for pan-immunoglobulins against SARS-CoV-2, with a baseline adjusted seroprevalence of 6·92% (95% CI 6·41-7·43) in the population. 437 (82·1%) of 532 participants who were positive for pan-immunoglobulins were asymptomatic. 69 (13·0%) of 532 individuals were positive for IgM antibodies, 84 (15·8%) were positive for IgA antibodies, 532 (100%) were positive for IgG antibodies, and 212 (39·8%) were positive for neutralising antibodies at baseline. The proportion of individuals who were positive for pan-immunoglobulins who had neutralising antibodies in April remained stable for the two follow-up visits (162 [44·6%] of 363 in June, 2020, and 187 [41·2%] of 454 in October-December, 2020). On the basis of data from 335 individuals who attended all three follow-up visits and who were positive for pan-immunoglobulins, neutralising antibody levels did not significantly decrease over the study period (median 1/5·6 [IQR 1/2·0 to 1/14·0] at baseline vs 1/5·6 [1/4·0 to 1/11·2] at first follow-up [p=1·0] and 1/6·3 [1/2·0 to 1/12·6] at second follow-up [p=0·29]). However, neutralising antibody titres were lower in asymptomatic individuals than in confirmed cases and symptomatic individuals. Although titres of IgG decreased over time, the proportion of individuals who had IgG antibodies did not decrease substantially (from 30 [100%] of 30 at baseline to 26 [89·7%] of 29 at second follow-up among confirmed cases, 65 [100%] of 65 at baseline to 58 [92·1%] of 63 at second follow-up among symptomatic individuals, and 437 [100%] of 437 at baseline to 329 [90·9%] of 362 at second follow-up among asymptomatic individuals). INTERPRETATION: 6·92% of a cross-sectional sample of the population of Wuhan developed antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, with 39·8% of this population seroconverting to have neutralising antibodies. Our durability data on humoral responses indicate that mass vaccination is needed to effect herd protection to prevent the resurgence of the epidemic.

Early reports describe high venous thromboembolism (VTE) and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) rates, but data are limited. This multicenter retrospective study describes the rate and severity of hemostatic and thrombotic complications of 400 hospital-admitted COVID-19 patients (144 critically ill) primarily receiving standard-dose prophylactic anticoagulation. Coagulation and inflammatory parameters were compared between patients with and without coagulation-associated complications. Multivariable logistic models examined the utility of these markers in predicting coagulation-associated complications, critical illness, and death. The radiographically confirmed VTE rate was 4.8% (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.9-7.3), and the overall thrombotic complication rate was 9.5% (95% CI, 6.8-12.8). The overall and major bleeding rates were 4.8% (95% CI, 2.9-7.3) and 2.3% (95% CI, 1.0-4.2), respectively. In the critically ill, radiographically confirmed VTE and major bleeding rates were 7.6% (95% CI, 3.9-13.3) and 5.6% (95% CI, 2.4-10.7), respectively. Elevated D-dimer at initial presentation was predictive of coagulation-associated complications during hospitalization (D-dimer >2500 ng/mL, adjusted odds ratio [OR] for thrombosis, 6.79 [95% CI, 2.39-19.30]; adjusted OR for bleeding, 3.56 [95% CI, 1.01-12.66]), critical illness, and death. Additional markers at initial presentation predictive of thrombosis during hospitalization included platelet count >450 × 109/L (adjusted OR, 3.56 [95% CI, 1.27-9.97]), C-reactive protein (CRP) >100 mg/L (adjusted OR, 2.71 [95% CI, 1.26-5.86]), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) >40 mm/h (adjusted OR, 2.64 [95% CI, 1.07-6.51]). ESR, CRP, fibrinogen, ferritin, and procalcitonin were higher in patients with thrombotic complications than in those without. DIC, clinically relevant thrombocytopenia, and reduced fibrinogen were rare and were associated with significant bleeding manifestations. Given the observed bleeding rates, randomized trials are needed to determine any potential benefit of intensified anticoagulant prophylaxis in COVID-19 patients.","Al-Samkari, Hanny; Karp Leaf, Rebecca S; Dzik, Walter H; Carlson, Jonathan C T; Fogerty, Annemarie E; Waheed, Anem; Goodarzi, Katayoon; Bendapudi, Pavan K; Bornikova, Larissa; Gupta, Shruti; Leaf, David E; Kuter, David J; Rosovsky, Rachel P",Blood,430,22

These webs involve health professionals, patient advocacy groups, medical professional societies, research universities, teaching hospitals, public health agencies, policymakers, and legislators. Opioid companies built these webs as part of corporate strategies of influence that were designed to expand the opioid market from cancer patients to larger groups of patients with acute or chronic pain, to increase dosage as well as opioid use, to downplay the risks of addiction and abuse, and to characterize physicians' concerns about the addiction and abuse risks as ""opiophobia."" In the face of these pervasive strategies, conflict of interest policies have proven insufficient for addressing corporate influence in medical practice, medical research, and public health policy. Governments, the academy, and civil society need to develop counterstrategies to insulate themselves from corporate influence and to preserve their integrity and public trust. These strategies require a paradigm shift-from partnerships with the private sector, which are ordinarily vehicles for corporate influence, to a norm of separation.","Marks, Jonathan H",J Bioeth Inq,430,1

AIM: Our goal was to assess the effect of COVID-19 pandemic on Hungarian acute ischemic stroke care. METHOD: We compared demographical and clinical characteristics, rate of intravenous and endovascular therapies and therapeutic time parameters of acute ischemic strokes admitted to a university stroke centre in a COVID-epidemic period (01/03/2020-30/04/2020) and an identical period of 2019. RESULTS: 86 patients were admitted during the COVID-period and 97 in the control period. Demographical and clinical characteristics of these periods were well-balanced. In the COVID-period, the proportion of patients arriving beyond 24 hours after onset increased by 13% (p = 0.046), the rate of endovascular interventions remained unchanged (8%), the rate of intravenous thrombolysis decreased from 26% to 16%, the mean onset-to-treatment time of thrombolysis increased by 20 minutes, while the mean door-to-treatment time increased by only 5 minutes. Behind the shift of arrival time categories, multivariable (year of examination, NIHSS, age) logistic regression shows that the year of examination might play a leading role (p = 0.096). CONCLUSION: In the COVID-period, admissions for acute ischemic strokes decreased by 11% and the proportion of cases certainly untreatable by reperfusion therapies (arriving beyond 24 hours after onset) increased significantly. While the rate of endovascular interventions remained unchanged, the absolute rate of intravenous thrombolysis decreased by 10% and the mean onset-to-treatment time showed a tendency to increase. In these changes, the COVID-epidemic itself and related out-of-hospital factors might play a leading role.

Reported COVID-19 infections may not have properly conveyed the full extent of attention to the pandemic. Furthermore, infection metrics are unlikely to illustrate the full scope of negative consequences of the pandemic and its associated risk to communities. METHODS: In an effort to better understand the impacts of COVID-19, we concurrently assessed the geospatial and longitudinal distributions of Twitter messages about COVID-19 which were posted between March 3rd and April 13th and compared these results with the number of confirmed cases reported for sub-national levels of the United States. Geospatial hot spot analysis was also conducted to detect geographic areas that might be at elevated risk of spread based on both volume of tweets and number of reported cases. RESULTS: Statistically significant aberrations of high numbers of tweets were detected in approximately one-third of US states, most of which had relatively high proportions of rural inhabitants. Geospatial trends toward becoming hotspots for tweets related to COVID-19 were observed for specific rural states in the United States. DISCUSSION: Population-adjusted results indicate that rural areas in the U.S. may not have engaged with the COVID-19 topic until later stages of an outbreak. Future studies should explore how this dynamic can inform future outbreak communication and health promotion.","Cuomo, Raphael E; Purushothaman, Vidya; Li, Jiawei; Cai, Mingxiang; Mackey, Timothy K",PLoS One,430,1

We use comparative genomics to provide a high-confidence protein-coding gene set, characterize evolutionary constraint, and prioritize functional mutations. We select 44 Sarbecovirus genomes at ideally-suited evolutionary distances, and quantify protein-coding evolutionary signatures and overlapping constraint. We find strong protein-coding signatures for ORFs 3a, 6, 7a, 7b, 8, 9b, and a novel alternate-frame gene, ORF3c, whereas ORFs 2b, 3d/3d-2, 3b, 9c, and 10 lack protein-coding signatures or convincing experimental evidence of protein-coding function. Furthermore, we show no other conserved protein-coding genes remain to be discovered. Mutation analysis suggests ORF8 contributes to within-individual fitness but not person-to-person transmission. Cross-strain and within-strain evolutionary pressures agree, except for fewer-than-expected within-strain mutations in nsp3 and S1, and more-than-expected in nucleocapsid, which shows a cluster of mutations in a predicted B-cell epitope, suggesting immune-avoidance selection. Evolutionary histories of residues disrupted by spike-protein substitutions D614G, N501Y, E484K, and K417N/T provide clues about their biology, and we catalog likely-functional co-inherited mutations.

Preventive medicine, as a specialty of medicine, trains students on both clinical medicine and public health and is of a particular need in battling against this pandemic. In China, preventive medicine plays a unique role in the disease control system where preventive medicine graduates represent a large share of the workforce. However, there is a shortage of qualified staff in the Chinese disease control system. The reasons for such a shortage are multifaceted. From the human resource perspective, the undergraduate preventive medicine curricula and exclusive public health training for preventive medicine postgraduates limit their clinical capacities. A series of disease control and public health education reforms may further incapacitate preventive medicine graduates' clinical skills, unintentionally widening the gap between public health and clinical medicine and thus posing threats to effective disease detection and control. The authors call for reforming and optimizing preventive medicine to bridge the gap between clinical medicine and public health by strengthening curricula on clinical medicine, diversifying curricula on public health, enhancing preventive medicine residency programs, and rectifying regulations that restrict preventive medicine graduates from practicing curative medicine.","Zeng, Wu; Li, Guohong; Turbat, Vincent; Hu, Guoqing; Ahn, Haksoon; Shen, Jie",Prev Med,430,20

With applications ranging from visual filters to voice assistants, intelligence on mobile comes in many forms and facets. However, Deep Neural Network (DNN) inference remains a compute intensive workload, with devices struggling to support intelligence at the cost of responsiveness.On the one hand, there is significant research on reducing model runtime requirements and supporting deployment on embedded devices. On the other hand, the strive to maximise the accuracy of a task is supported by deeper and wider neural networks, making mobile deployment of state-of-the-art DNNs a moving target. In this paper, we perform the first holistic study of DNN usage in the wild in an attempt to track deployed models and match how these run on widely deployed devices. To this end, we analyse over 16k of the most popular apps in the Google Play Store to characterise their DNN usage and performance across devices of different capabilities, both across tiers and generations. Simultaneously, we measure the models' energy footprint, as a core cost dimension of any mobile deployment. To streamline the process, we have developed gaugeNN, a tool that automates the deployment, measurement and analysis of DNNs on devices, with support for different frameworks and platforms. Results from our experience study paint the landscape of deep learning deployments on smartphones and indicate their popularity across app developers. Furthermore, our study shows the gap between bespoke techniques and real-world deployments and the need for optimised deployment of deep learning models in a highly dynamic and heterogeneous ecosystem.","Almeida, Mario; Laskaridis, Stefanos; Mehrotra, Abhinav; Dudziak, Lukasz; Leontiadis, Ilias; Lane, Nicholas D.",,430,16

Integration of research activities into routine clinical care is paramount to address this shortfall. Active engagement of patients, families and hospital administrations is required to reframe integrated clinical trials as a tenet of quality health-care delivery. Current research funding in health care is 1-2 orders of magnitude below that of other industries.

Appropriate triage and escalation of clinical care are critical for this patient group managed in community care facilities (CCFs). Purpose To evaluate the imaging guideline recommendations for COVID-19 from the Fleischner Society and analyze the clinical utility of chest radiograph screening for asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic patients with COVID-19. Materials and Methods In this retrospective study, patients with COVID-19 confirmed by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) who were admitted to Singapore Expo, a designated CCF, for continuation of their management during May 3-31, 2020 were identified. Upon admission, patients aged 36 and older without any baseline chest imaging received a chest radiograph. All chest radiographs and clinical outcomes of patients including those who were subsequently transferred to acute hospitals for escalation of care were reviewed. Key proportions of patients with findings of pulmonary infection and those requiring further inpatient treatment were calculated, and 95% binomial proportion confidence intervals obtained using the Clopper-Pearson method. Results The study included 5,621 patients: all men 100% (5,621/5,621), mean age 37 ± 8 years (range 17-60). A total of 1,964 chest radiographs were performed of which normal accounted for 98.0% (1,925/1,964) and findings of pulmonary infection represented 2.0% (39/1,964). Only 0.2% (4/1,964) with chest radiograph findings of pulmonary infection (all of whom were symptomatic) required supplemental oxygenation and inpatient treatment. None of the asymptomatic patients with findings of pulmonary infection required supplemental oxygenation, and they received only symptomatic treatment. Conclusion In accordance with Fleischner Society recommendations, chest radiograph screening for patients with COVID-19 aged 17-60 with mild or no symptoms is not indicated unless there is risk of clinical deterioration.

The patients were divided according to the severity of their infection: mild (N = 64), severe (N = 31), and fatal (N = 20). DNA was extracted from all samples, and HLA genotyping was performed for both class I (A, B, and C) and class II (DRB1, DQA1, and DQB1) using the PCR-rSSO (polymerase chain reaction-reverse sequence-specific oligonucleotide) molecular method. The frequency of HLA-B*51 was significantly higher among patients in the fatal group than among those in the mild infection group (15% vs. 4.7%, p = 0.027). Additionally, the frequency of HLA-B*35 was significantly higher in the mild infection group than in the fatal group (21.1% vs. 7.5%, p = 0.050 [a borderline p-value]). In terms of HLA class II, DRB1*13 was significantly observed in the fatal group than in the mild infection group (17.5% vs. 11.3%, p = 0.049). However, the p-value for all alleles became insignificant after a statistical correction for the p-values (pc = 0.216, pc = 0.4, and pc = 0.49, respectively). Compared with all published data, this study highlights that the association between the HLA system and the COVID-19 outcome might be ethnic-dependent. Genetic variation between populations must be examined on a wider scale to assess infection prognosis and vaccine effectiveness.","Naemi, Fatmah M A; Al-Adwani, Shurooq; Al-Khatabi, Heba; Al-Nazawi, Ashwaq",J Med Virol,430,18

However, clinical evidence suggests that the intestine may present another viral target organ. Indeed, the SARS-CoV-2 receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is highly expressed on differentiated enterocytes. In human small intestinal organoids (hSIOs), enterocytes were readily infected by SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, as demonstrated by confocal and electron microscopy. Enterocytes produced infectious viral particles, whereas messenger RNA expression analysis of hSIOs revealed induction of a generic viral response program. Therefore, the intestinal epithelium supports SARS-CoV-2 replication, and hSIOs serve as an experimental model for coronavirus infection and biology.","Lamers, Mart M; Beumer, Joep; van der Vaart, Jelte; Knoops, Kèvin; Puschhof, Jens; Breugem, Tim I; Ravelli, Raimond B G; Paul van Schayck, J; Mykytyn, Anna Z; Duimel, Hans Q; van Donselaar, Elly; Riesebosch, Samra; Kuijpers, Helma J H; Schipper, Debby; van de Wetering, Willine J; de Graaf, Miranda; Koopmans, Marion; Cuppen, Edwin; Peters, Peter J; Haagmans, Bart L; Clevers, Hans",Science,430,16

Investigating the chemical and physical properties of compounds used alone or in combination to combat the COVID-19 pandemic is of vital and pressing importance. The purpose of this study was to characterize the charge transfer (CT) complexation of AZM with iodine in four different solvents: CH2Cl2, CHCl3, CCl4, and C6H5Cl. AZM reacted with iodine at a 1:1â¯M ratio (AZM to I2) in the CHCl3 solvent and a 1:2â¯M ratio in the other three solvents, as evidenced by data obtained from an elemental analysis of the solid CT products and spectrophotometric titration and Job's continuous variation method for the soluble CT products. Data obtained from UV-visible and Raman spectroscopies indicated that AZM strongly interacted with iodine in the CH2Cl2, CCl4, and C6H5Cl solvents by a physically potent nâ&#963;* interaction to produce a tri-iodide complex formulated as [AZM·I+]I3 -. XRD and TEM analyses revealed that, in all solvents, the AZM-I2 complex possessed an amorphous structure composed of spherical particles ranging from 80 to 110â¯nm that tended to aggregate into clusters. The findings described in the present study will hopefully contribute to optimizing the treatment protocols for COVID-19.","Adam, Abdel Majid A; Saad, Hosam A; Alsuhaibani, Amnah M; Refat, Moamen S; Hegab, Mohamed S",J Mol Liq,430,16

The aim of this study was to conduct a nationwide survey regarding the appropriate timing of EPs during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This prospective study was performed through a nationwide electronic survey. The survey consisted of 15 questions divided into three sections. The first evaluated the agreement for EPs classified as ""time sensitive"" and ""not time sensitive"". Two other sections assessed ""high-priority"" and ""low-priority"" scenarios. Agreement was considered when > 75% of respondents answered a question in the same direction. RESULTS: The response rate was 27.2% (214/784). Among the respondents, agreement for the need to perform EP in < 72 h was only reached for variceal bleeding (93.4%). Dysphagia with alarm symptoms was the scenario in which the highest percentage of physicians (95.9%) agreed that an EP needed to be performed within a month. Less than 30% of endoscopists would perform an EP within the first 72 h for patients with mild cholangitis, non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding without hemodynamic instability, or severe anaemia without overt bleeding. In time-sensitive clinical scenarios suggestive of benign disease, none of the scenarios reached agreement in any sense. Among the time-sensitive clinical scenarios suggestive of malignancy, > 90% of the surveyed respondents considered that EP could not be postponed for > 8 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: There was no consensus among endoscopists about the timing of EPs in patients with pathologies considered time sensitive or in those with high-priority pathologies. Agreement was only reached in five (17%) of the evaluated clinical scenarios.","Marroquín-Reyes, José Daniel; Zepeda-Gómez, Sergio; Tepox-Padrón, Alejandra; Quintanar-Martínez, Mariana; Trujillo-Benavides, Omar Edel; Téllez-Avila, Félix I",Surg. endosc,430,20

The performance of artisanal-produced masks was compared with industry equivalents. Study design: Case report with comparative testing. Methods: A comparison was made between two parallel projects that produced single-use masks for healthcare workers and reusable masks for the community. Mask samples were tested for filtration efficiency (FE) and breathability (pressure drop). Results: Results for FE averaged 40-60% for healthcare masks and 10% for community masks; both types of masks were tested for particle sizes of 0.3µm. Conclusions: While performance was inferior to standard comparators, the masks investigated in this study afforded a level of protection in the absence of alternatives, especially in non-aerosol generating contexts. The findings of this study are useful for communities with limited resources in other developing countries. In addition, insights can be gained from the experiences in Ribeirão Preto in terms of how to respond to future health emergencies.","Leite, Karina F S; Cheng, Kezi; Kumar, Shailabh; Chayamiti, Emilia M P C; Costa, Marcia; Tung, Maryann C; Morejón, Karen M L; Salomão, Cátia H D; Lopes, Stella C; Pacini, Henrique",Public Health Pract (Oxf),430,33

Nowadays, age-related diseases come into prominence, and identifying age-related changes and developing proper therapeutic approaches are counted as some of the major issues regarding community health. Melatonin is the main hormone of the pineal gland. Melatonin is known to influence many biological processes in the body, including circadian rhythms, the immune system, and neuroendocrine and cardiovascular functions.Melatoninrhythms also reflect the biological process of aging. Aging is an extremely complex and multifactorial process. Melatonin levels decline considerably with aging and its decline is associated with several age-related diseases. Aging is closely associated with oxidative damage and mitochondrial dysfunction. Free radical reactions initiated by the mitochondria constitute the inherent aging process. Melatonin plays a pivotal role in preventing age-related oxidative stress. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) fatality rates increase with chronic diseases and age, where melatonin levels decrease. For this reason, melatonin supplementation in elderly could be beneficial in COVID-19 treatment.

Apart from its known acute respiratory involvements, the CNS manifestations of COVID-19 are common. These neurological symptoms are diverse and could range from mild nonspecific or specific symptoms such as the loss of various sensory perceptions, the worrying autoimmune Guillain-Barré syndrome, to the life-threatening acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, and the CNS-mediated respiratory distress. An autopsy report documented the presence of SARS-CoV2 in brain tissues of a COVID-19 patient. However, there is no definite conclusion on the mechanisms of SARS-CoV2 neuroinvasion. These proposed mechanisms include the direct viral invasion, the systemic blood circulation, or the distribution of infected immune cells. Concerning these different neuropathophysiologies, COVID-19 patients who are presenting with either the early-onset, multiple, and severe CNS symptoms or rapid respiratory deterioration should be suspected for the direct viral neuroinvasion, and appropriate management options should be considered. This article reviews the neurological manifestations, the proposed neuroinvasive mechanisms, and the potential neurological sequelae of SARS-CoV2.","Gasmi, Amin; Tippairote, Torsak; Mujawdiya, Pavan Kumar; Gasmi Benahmed, Asma; Menzel, Alain; Dadar, Maryam; Bjørklund, Geir",Mol.

We know that the elderly and people with chronic diseases contract the infection more easily and they develop clinically more serious and often lethal forms. To date, the reasons for this have been generically attributed to old age and underlying diseases. Most Covid-19 deaths occurred in long-term care facilities because the residents are elderly people with chronic illness living in close contact. Therefore, facilities have become epidemic outbreaks. Forensic knowledge is very limited because an autopsy is rarely performed. Post-mortem investigations can help increase knowledge about Covid-19 and identify any undiagnosed pathologies in life. Therefore, forensic investigations play a role in protecting a frail population.

The current novel coronavirus, COVID-19, has reduced face-to-face contact, and this has challenged how health professionals and clinical students can access training, accreditation and development. Online and other remote mechanisms are available to tutors and course designers; however, they might not feel comfortable with such affordances, in light of expectations to so rapidly change familiar teaching and delivery styles. This may result in the loss of interaction and disruption of peer learning, which are hallmarks of the small group tutorial. Collaborative learning is essential to develop and refine an emerging sense of belonging to a professional community through formal studies, and interactive learning is a requirement for some registered health professions to satisfy ongoing professional accreditation. Online media has been used to promote social learning in regional, rural and remote communities for some time. Strategies for learning activity design and tutor training are proposed to equip course designers and educators to support health professions education remotely, through the synchronous, online small group.

To investigate the prevalence of COVID-19 in Wuhan, we conducted serologic tests on 35,326 individuals from four different communities to estimate cumulative incidence of infection. Our results showed that 1,332 individuals (3.77%) showed positive COVID-19 antibody (either IgM or IgG). Males had a lower positivity rate than females (3.02% versus 4.52%). The antibody positivity rates showed a clear trend of increase according to patients' ages and varied among different communities. The results indicate that public health interventions may play important roles in the control of COVID-19.IMPORTANCE Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was first detected in December 2019 in Wuhan, China. Afterwards, a number of public health interventions were implemented, including lock-down, face mask ordinances, and social distancing. Studies that rely on viral RNA testing of symptomatic patients have shown that these multifaceted interventions contributed to the control of the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan and delayed the epidemic's progression. However, these estimates of confirmed cases may miss large numbers of asymptomatic patients and recovered symptomatic patients who were not tested. To investigate the prevalence of COVID-19 in Wuhan, we conducted serologic tests on 35,326 individuals to estimate the cumulative incidence of infection. The results suggest that public health interventions may play important roles in the control of COVID-19.","Han, Huan; Yi, Junzhu; Cheng, Gongbo; Jiang, Wuhui; Brozek, Grzegorz M; Jiang, Yingan; Zhu, Chengliang; Xia, Yuchen",MSphere,430,26

The objective of this trial was to determine the characteristics, clinical significance and therapeutic consequences of these arrhythmias in COVID-19 patients requiring intensive care unit (ICU) treatment. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 113 consecutive patients (mean age 64.1 ± 14.3 years, 30 (26.5%) female) with positive PCR testing for SARS-CoV2 as well as radiographically confirmed pulmonary involvement admitted to the ICU from March to May 2020 were included and observed for a cumulative time of 2321 days. Fifty episodes of sustained atrial tachycardias, five episodes of sustained ventricular arrhythmias and thirty bradycardic events were documented. Sustained new onset atrial arrhythmias were associated with hemodynamic deterioration in 13 cases (35.1%). Patients with new onset atrial arrhythmias were older, showed higher levels of Hs-Troponin and NT-proBNP, and a more severe course of disease. The 5 ventricular arrhythmias (two ventricular tachycardias, two episodes of ventricular fibrillation, and one torsade de pointes tachycardia) were observed in 4 patients. All episodes could be terminated by immediate defibrillation/cardioversion. Five bradycardic events were associated with hemodynamic deterioration. Precipitating factors could be identified in 19 of 30 episodes (63.3%), no patient required cardiac pacing. Baseline characteristics were not significantly different between patients with or without bradycardic events. CONCLUSION: Relevant arrhythmias are common in severely ill ICU patients with COVID-19. They are associated with worse courses of disease and require specific treatment. This makes daily close monitoring of telemetric data mandatory in this patient group.","Parwani, Abdul Shokor; Haug, Marcel; Keller, Theresa; Guthof, Tim; Blaschke, Florian; Tscholl, Verena; Biewener, Sebastian; Kamieniarz, Paul; Zieckler, Daniel; Kruse, Jan; Angermair, Stefan; Treskatsch, Sascha; Müller-Redetzky, Holger; Pieske, Burkert; Stangl, Karl; Landmesser, Ulf; Boldt, Leif-Hendrik; Huemer, Martin; Attanasio, Philipp",J Electrocardiol,430,9

Limited data exist to guide the intensity of antithrombotic prophylaxis. Objective: To evaluate the effects of intermediate-dose vs standard-dose prophylactic anticoagulation among patients with COVID-19 admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). Design, Setting, and Participants: Multicenter randomized trial with a 2 × 2 factorial design performed in 10 academic centers in Iran comparing intermediate-dose vs standard-dose prophylactic anticoagulation (first hypothesis) and statin therapy vs matching placebo (second hypothesis; not reported in this article) among adult patients admitted to the ICU with COVID-19. Patients were recruited between July 29, 2020, and November 19, 2020. The final follow-up date for the 30-day primary outcome was December 19, 2020. Interventions: Intermediate-dose (enoxaparin, 1 mg/kg daily) (n = 276) vs standard prophylactic anticoagulation (enoxaparin, 40 mg daily) (n = 286), with modification according to body weight and creatinine clearance. The assigned treatments were planned to be continued until completion of 30-day follow-up. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary efficacy outcome was a composite of venous or arterial thrombosis, treatment with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, or mortality within 30 days, assessed in randomized patients who met the eligibility criteria and received at least 1 dose of the assigned treatment. Prespecified safety outcomes included major bleeding according to the Bleeding Academic Research Consortium (type 3 or 5 definition), powered for noninferiority (a noninferiority margin of 1.8 based on odds ratio), and severe thrombocytopenia (platelet count <20 ×103/µL). All outcomes were blindly adjudicated. Results: Among 600 randomized patients, 562 (93.7%) were included in the primary analysis (median [interquartile range] age, 62 [50-71] years; 237 [42.2%] women). The primary efficacy outcome occurred in 126 patients (45.7%) in the intermediate-dose group and 126 patients (44.1%) in the standard-dose prophylaxis group (absolute risk difference, 1.5% [95% CI, -6.6% to 9.8%]; odds ratio, 1.06 [95% CI, 0.76-1.48]; P = .70). Major bleeding occurred in 7 patients (2.5%) in the intermediate-dose group and 4 patients (1.4%) in the standard-dose prophylaxis group (risk difference, 1.1% [1-sided 97.5% CI, -&#8734; to 3.4%]; odds ratio, 1.83 [1-sided 97.5% CI, 0.00-5.93]), not meeting the noninferiority criteria (P for noninferiority >.99). Severe thrombocytopenia occurred only in patients assigned to the intermediate-dose group (6 vs 0 patients; risk difference, 2.2% [95% CI, 0.4%-3.8%]; P = .01). Conclusions and Relevance: Among patients admitted to the ICU with COVID-19, intermediate-dose prophylactic anticoagulation, compared with standard-dose prophylactic anticoagulation, did not result in a significant difference in the primary outcome of a composite of adjudicated venous or arterial thrombosis, treatment with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, or mortality within 30 days. These results do not support the routine empirical use of intermediate-dose prophylactic anticoagulation in unselected patients admitted to the ICU with COVID-19.

The portable rescue device could be used in clinical applications in outbreaks of viral pneumonia such as SARS. To reduce energy consumption for battery-powered portable usage, NO micro-channel plasma reactions induced by a continuous discharge arc were employed. A single-use airway tube could be combined with an intubation tube in clinical applications. In the experiment, a switching transistor controlled high frequency DC (12.5 kHz) was used to create a continuous discharge arc between two stainless steel electrodes (1-mm separation) after high-voltage breakthrough. A rotate instrument was employed to change the direction angle between the airflow and discharge arc, tube filled with Calcium hydroxide connected with gas outlet for reducing NO2, gas flow rate and input voltage were evaluated separately with concentration of NO and NO2/NO ratio. Results showed that a 2 L/min air flow direction from the cathode to the anode of electrodes (direction angle was zero) under 4 V input voltages produced 32.5±3.8 ppm NO, and the NO2/NO ratio reduced to less than 10%, stable output of nitric oxide might be convenient and effective for NO inhalation therapy. Modularization of the design produced a portable NO inhalation device that has potential for use in clinical applications as it is low cost, easy to disinfect, consumes low levels of energy and is ready to use.","Qian, Li; Wenlu, Zhang; Hong, Wang; Juan, Deng; Xinli, Tian; Linlin, Wang; Hong, Sha",PLoS One,430,16

Cortical inhibitory interneurons (cINs) are born in the ventral forebrain and migrate into cortex, where their numbers are adjusted by programmed cell death. Here we show that loss of clustered gamma protocadherins (Pcdhg), but not of genes in the alpha or beta clusters, increased dramatically cIN BAX-dependent cell death in mice. Surprisingly, electrophysiological and morphological properties of Pcdhg-deficient and wild-type cINs during the period of cIN cell death were indistinguishable. Co-transplantation of wild-type with Pcdhg-deficient interneuron precursors further reduced mutant cIN survival, but the proportion of mutant and wild-type cells undergoing cell death was not affected by their density. Transplantation also allowed us to test for the contribution of Pcdhg isoforms to the regulation of cIN cell death.

Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 mediates viral entry into host cells by binding ACE2 through the receptor-binding domain (RBD). RBD is an important target for development of virus inhibitors, neutralizing antibodies, and vaccines. RBD expressed in mammalian cells suffers from low expression yield and high cost. E. coli is a popular host for protein expression, which has the advantage of easy scalability with low cost. However, RBD expressed by E. coli (RBD-1) lacks the glycosylation, and its antigenic epitopes may not be sufficiently exposed. In the present study, RBD-1 was expressed by E. coli and purified by a Ni Sepharose Fast Flow column. RBD-1 was structurally characterized and compared with RBD expressed by the HEK293 cells (RBD-2). The secondary structure and tertiary structure of RBD-1 were largely maintained without glycosylation. In particular, the major beta-sheet content of RBD-1 was almost unaltered. RBD-1 could strongly bind ACE2 with a dissociation constant (K-D) of 2.98 x 10(-8) M. Thus, RBD-1 was expected to apply in the vaccine development, screening drugs and virus test kit.","He, Y.

Reaching herd immunity status likely necessitates that children, as well as their parents, receive a vaccine targeting SARS-CoV-2. In this exploratory study, we investigated the demographic, experiential, and psychological factors associated with the anticipated likelihood and speed of having children receive a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine in a sample of 455 Canadian families (858 children; parents' mean age = 38.2 ± 6.82 years). Using linear mixed-effects and proportional odds logistic regression models, we demonstrated that older parental age, living in the Prairies (relative to Central Canada), more complete child vaccination history, and a greater tendency to prioritise the risks of the disease relative to the risks of side effects (i.e. lower omission bias) were associated with higher likelihoods of intention to vaccinate participants' children, with trend-level associations with lower perceived danger of the vaccine and higher psychological avoidance of the pandemic. Faster speed of intended vaccination was predicted by a similar constellation of variables with an additional predictor of a child in the family having a COVID-19 related health risk being associated with slower intended speed. Results are discussed concerning public health knowledge mobilisation and the unique Canadian health landscape.","Lackner, Christine L; Wang, Charles H",Vaccine X,430,1

For hospital environments, the products recommended and authorized by regulatory institutions for environmental cleaning and disinfection need to be highly effective. OBJECTIVE: To identify, systematically evaluate and summarize the best available scientific evidence on environmental cleaning to prevent COVID-19 infection. DESIGN AND SETTING: A systematic review of studies analyzing cleaning products that inactivate coronavirus, conducted within the evidence-based health program of a federal university in São Paulo (SP), Brazil. METHODS: A systematic search of the relevant literature was conducted in the PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, CINAHL and LILACS databases, for articles published up to May 27, 2020, relating to studies evaluating cleaning products that inactivate coronavirus in the environment. RESULTS: Seven studies were selected. These analyzed use of 70% alcohol, detergent, detergent containing iodine, household bleach, sodium hypochlorite, hydrogen peroxide, chlorine dioxide, glutaraldehyde, ultraviolet irradiation and plasma air purifier. The effectiveness of treating sewage with sodium hypochlorite and chlorine dioxide was also evaluated. CONCLUSION: Disinfection of environments, especially those in ordinary use, such as bathrooms, needs to be done constantly. Viral inactivation was achieved using chlorine-based disinfectants, alcohol, detergents, glutaraldehyde, iodine-containing detergents, hydrogen peroxide compounds and household bleaches. Alcohol showed efficient immediate activity. In sewage, sodium hypochlorite had better action than chlorine dioxide.

Prior studies show that pre-trained V&L models can significantly improve the model performance for downstream tasks such as Visual Question Answering (VQA). However, V&L models are less effective when applied in the medical domain (e.g., on X-ray images and clinical notes) due to the domain gap. In this paper, we investigate the challenges of applying pre-trained V&L models in medical applications. In particular, we identify that the visual representation in general V&L models is not suitable for processing medical data. To overcome this limitation, we propose BERTHop, a transformer-based model based on PixelHop++ and VisualBERT, for better capturing the associations between the two modalities. Experiments on the OpenI dataset, a commonly used thoracic disease diagnosis benchmark, show that BERTHop achieves an average Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 98.12% which is 1.62% higher than state-of-the-art (SOTA) while it is trained on a 9 times smaller dataset.","Monajatipoor, Masoud; Rouhsedaghat, Mozhdeh; Li, Liunian Harold; Chien, Aichi; Kuo, C.-C.

In three psychiatry case-control cohorts, we compared the perceived mental health impact and coping and changes in depressive symptoms, anxiety, worry, and loneliness before and during the COVID-19 pandemic between people with and without lifetime depressive, anxiety, or obsessive-compulsive disorders. METHODS: Between April 1 and May 13, 2020, online questionnaires were distributed among the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety, Netherlands Study of Depression in Older Persons, and Netherlands Obsessive Compulsive Disorder Association cohorts, including people with (n=1181) and without (n=336) depressive, anxiety, or obsessive-compulsive disorders. The questionnaire contained questions on perceived mental health impact, fear of COVID-19, coping, and four validated scales assessing depressive symptoms, anxiety, worry, and loneliness used in previous waves during 2006-16. Number and chronicity of disorders were based on diagnoses in previous waves. Linear regression and mixed models were done. FINDINGS: The number and chronicity of disorders showed a positive graded dose-response relation, with greater perceived impact on mental health, fear, and poorer coping. Although people with depressive, anxiety, or obsessive-compulsive disorders scored higher on all four symptom scales than did individuals without these mental health disorders, both before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, they did not report a greater increase in symptoms during the pandemic. In fact, people without depressive, anxiety, or obsessive-compulsive disorders showed a greater increase in symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic, whereas individuals with the greatest burden on their mental health tended to show a slight symptom decrease. INTERPRETATION: People with depressive, anxiety, or obsessive-compulsive disorders are experiencing a detrimental impact on their mental health from the COVID-19 pandemic, which requires close monitoring in clinical practice. Yet, the COVID-19 pandemic does not seem to have further increased symptom severity compared with their prepandemic levels.

Moreover, very little has been written about the rehabilitation needs of patients with COVID-19 after discharge from acute care. The objective of this report is to answer the question ""What rehabilitation services do survivors of COVID-19 require?"" The question was asked within the context of a subacute hospital delivering geriatric inpatient and outpatient rehabilitation services. Three areas relevant to rehabilitation after COVID-19 were identified. First, details of how patients may present have been summarized, including comorbidities, complications from an intensive care unit stay with or without intubation, and the effects of the virus on multiple body systems, including those pertaining to cardiac, neurological, cognitive, and mental health. Second, I have suggested procedures regarding the design of inpatient rehabilitation units for COVID-19 survivors, staffing issues, and considerations for outpatient rehabilitation. Third, guidelines for rehabilitation (physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech-language pathology) following COVID-19 have been proposed with respect to recovery of the respiratory system as well as recovery of mobility and function. A thorough assessment and an individualized, progressive treatment plan which focuses on function, disability, and return to participation in society will help each patient to maximize their function and quality of life.

We aimed to investigate the presence of conventional APAs used in the classification of antiphospholipid antibody syndrome in patients with severe lung infection with SARS-CoV-2 and to compare these results with non-COVID-19 critically ill patients. METHODS: Thirty-one COVID-19 patients (COVID group) and 28 non-COVID-19 critically ill patients (non-COVID group), were included in the study. Anti-cardiolipin (ACA) (IgG, IgM), anti-ß2-glycoprotein 1 (Anti-ß2GPI) (IgG, IgM, and IgA), and if the patient had not received any anti thrombotic agent before blood collection, lupus anticoagulant (LAC) tests were studied from the plasma of the patients. For testing ACA and Anti-ß2GPI, ELISA method was used, while fully automated coagulometer device was used for LAC test. RESULTS: APAs were positive in 25.81% in the COVID group (8/31) and 25% in the non-COVID group (7/28). LAC was the most common APA present in 23.08% of the COVID-19 group, who underwent measurement (6/26), while 3.57% of the non-COVID group was LAC positive (1/28) (p = .047). In the COVID group, ACA IgM, and IgG were positive in 6.45% and 0%, respectively (2/31 vs 0/31). In the non-COVID group, ACA IgM was not positive in any patient, while ACA IgG was positive in 7.14% (2/28).

Several probiotics have been confirmed to reduce the duration of bacterial or viral infections. Immune fitness may be one of the approaches by which protection against viral infections can be reinforced. In general, prevention is more efficient than therapy in fighting viral infections. Thus, probiotics have emerged as suitable candidates for controlling these infections.

DesignInterrupted time series analysis using a mixed effects zero-inflated Poisson model. Participants3,142 U.S. counties. InterventionsStay-at-home orders. Main MeasuresCOVID-19 daily incidence (primary) and mobility (secondary and intermediate measure of stay-at-home effectiveness) Key ResultsStay-at-home orders were implemented later (median March 30 vs. March 28) and were shorter (median 35 vs. 54 days) in rural than urban counties. Indoor mobility was, on average, 2.6-6.9% higher in rural than urban counties both during and after stay-at-home orders.

Results: Identified threads and responses resulted in three overarching themes: pharmacists having a positive role during the pandemic, taking additional responsibilities and services, and having passive or negative roles. A positive role was seen in pharmacists acting as first-line healthcare providers, creating public's awareness regarding COVID-19, and being responsible for chronic medication refill during the pandemic. Taking additional responsibilities was summarized in home deliveries and involvement in industrial and corporate efforts to deal with the pandemic. A passive/negative role was seen mostly among hospital pharmacists not being proactive during the pandemic and by pharmacists trying to maximize profits during pandemic time. Conclusions: Pharmacists perceived their role as a positive role during the coronavirus pandemic.

This led some economists to reconsider the taboo on seignorage. Following a brief documentation of the crisis impact and aggregate demand policies responses the paper discusses views of academics and policymakers on seignorage. Optimal taxation considerations imply that the decision on allocating deficit financing between debt and seignorage falls within the realm of fiscal authorities-a fact that infringes on central bank (CB) autonomy. The paper explores ideas aimed at improving the tradeoff between those two principles. Implication of cross-country variations in the need to use seignorage is discussed. Comparison of the indirect contribution of quantitative easing (QE) to deficit financing with the direct contribution of seignorage implies that QE is a substitute to seignorage that preserves central bank dominance without much change in existing monetary institutions. Comparison of empirical evidence from the USA during the global financial crisis with the post-WWI German inflation supports the view that for countries experiencing deflationary pressure seignorage is more potent in moving inflation toward its target than QE. Given the current outlook temporary use of seignorage does not appear to involve a substantial risk of inflation.,"Cukierman, Alex",Comp Econ Stud,430,24

We recruited COVID-19 patients who were hospitalized from January 1 to March 10, 2020, in three tertiary hospitals in Wuhan, met the discharge criteria and received at least one additional nucleic acid test before leaving the hospital. According to the RT-PCR results, patients were split into a recurrent positive group (RPos group) and a nonrecurrent positive group (non-RPos group). Clinical characteristics, therapeutic schedules and antibody titers were compared between the two groups. AI-assisted chest high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) technology was applied to investigate pulmonary inflammatory exudation and compare the extent of lung areas with different densities. This study involved 122 COVID-19 patients. There were no significant differences in age, sex, preexisting diseases, clinical symptoms, clinical classification, course of disease, therapeutic schedules or serum-specific antibodies between the two groups.

Whilst an evolving body of literature focuses on the impact of the pandemic on the mental health and wellbeing of children and young people, less attention has been paid to the collection of qualitative, exploratory data. The aim of this study was to examine young people in North East England's experiences of COVID-19 and associated control measures. Flexible, qualitative diaries were collected with 31 young people aged 13-17 for six weeks between July and October 2020. Diary extracts were curated using Instagram Direct Messaging (DM), email and text messaging. At the end of this study, participants took part in a follow-up interview (conducted by telephone or Zoom), asking them to reflect on their diary entries. Thematic analysis of diaries and interviews yielded three central themes: (1) impacts upon mental health and emotional wellbeing; (2) disruptions and changes to education and school life; and (3) frustration, burden and responsibility. These findings highlight acute mental health impacts (loneliness, isolation, anxiety) as well as longer-term repercussions from disrupted education (missed parts of curriculum, home schooling, cancelled exams, periods of isolation) on young people aged 13-17 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Scott, Stephanie; McGowan, Victoria J; Visram, Shelina",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),430,21

Especially for those bound for a career in pediatric emergency medicine (PEM), we designed a curriculum to proactively address this emerging learning gap, incorporating a wellness ""check-in"" at the beginning of each session. The objective of this report is to share the themes of this wellness check-ins with those engaged in pediatric emergency medicine education and mentorship. Additionally, we share our curricular approach as we plan to continue PEM Pals after the pandemic restrictions are lifted. METHODS: ""PEM Pals"" is a twice-weekly video conference meeting made up of pediatric residents with an expressed interest in PEM and those residents currently on rotation in the pediatric emergency department. Following a flipped classroom model, participants complete a presession learning activity and then core PEM topics are covered through literature review, case discussions, and telesimulations. Each meeting begins with a wellness ""check-in."" Themes generated from these check-ins were member checked by our core learning contingent. RESULTS: Nine residents make up our core learning contingent and we have had 11 ""PEM Pals"" sessions since March 2020. Three themes emerged from the wellness check-ins. The first was each postgraduate year's unique concern over professional transitions. The second was a pervasive sense of guilt. And the third was a grave concern about their ability to support and be supported from their personal communities. CONCLUSIONS: The goal of our curriculum was to supplement an anticipated knowledge gap. Through use of a wellness ""check-in,"" we elicited important themes for PEM educational leaders to consider as they mentor pediatric residents toward a career in PEM during the pandemic.","Goldman, Michael P; Rudd, Alexis V; Auerbach, Marc A",Pediatr Emerg Care,430,20

We described COVID-19 patients who underwent a surgery and the pandemic impact on surgical activities. METHODS: We conducted a multicenter cohort study between March 13 and June 192,020. We included all COVID-19 patients who underwent surgery in nine centres of the Province of Québec, the Canadian province most afflicted by the pandemic. We also included concomitant suspected COVID-19 (subsequently confirmed not to have COVID-19) patients and patients who had recovered from it. We collected data on baseline characteristics, postoperative complications and postoperative mortality. Our primary outcome was 30-day mortality. We also collected data on overall surgical activities during this first wave and during the same period in 2019. RESULTS: We included 44 COVID-19 patients, 18 suspected patients, and 18 patients who had recovered from COVID-19 at time of surgery. Among the 44 COVID-19 patients, 31 surgeries (71%) were urgent and 16 (36%) were major. In these patients, pulmonary complications were frequent (25%) and 30-day mortality was high (15.9%). This mortality was higher in patients with symptoms (23.1%) compared to those without symptoms (5.6%), although not statistically significant (p = 0.118). Of the total 22,616 cases performed among participating centres during the study period, only 0.19% had COVID-19 at the time of surgery. Fewer procedures were performed during the study period compared to the same period in 2019 (44,486 cases). CONCLUSION: In this Canadian cohort study, postoperative 30-day mortality in COVID-19 patients undergoing surgery was high (15.9%). Although few surgeries were performed on COVID-19 patients, the pandemic impact on surgical activity volume was important.

Bayesian phylogenetic inference usually explore the posterior distribution of trees via Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods, however assessing uncertainty and summarizing distributions or samples of such trees remains challenging. While labelled phylogenetic trees have been extensively studied, relatively less literature exists for unlabelled trees which are increasingly useful, for example when one seeks to summarize samples of trees obtained with different methods, or from different samples and environments, and wishes to assess stability and generalizability of these summaries. In our paper, we exploit recently proposed distance metrics of unlabelled ranked binary trees and unlabelled ranked genealogies (equipped with branch lengths) to define the Frechet mean and variance as summaries of these tree distributions. We provide an efficient combinatorial optimization algorithm for computing the Frechet mean from a sample of or distribution on unlabelled ranked tree shapes and unlabelled ranked genealogies.

METHODOLOGY: Distributions of incubation period and serial interval of Jiangxi epidemic data were fitted by ""fitdistrplus"" package of R software, and the meta-analysis was conducted by ""meta"" package of R software. RESULTS: Based on the epidemic data of Jiangxi, we found the median days of incubation period and serial interval were 5.9 days [IQR: 3.8 - 8.6] and 5.7 days [IQR: 3.6 - 8.3], respectively. The median days of the infectivity period at pre-symptomatic was 1.7 days [IQR: 1.1 - 2.4]. The meta-analysis based on 64 papers showed the pooled means of the incubation period and serial interval were 6.25 days (95% CrI: 5.75 - 6.75) and 5.15 days (95% CrI: 4.73 - 5.57), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our results contribute to a better understanding of COVID-19 and provide useful parameters for modelling the dynamics of disease transmission.

Recently, ferroelectric field-effect transistors (FeFETs), made from ferroelectric hafnium oxide (HfO2), have demonstrated promising SHG capabilities because of their unique symmetric transfer curves. In this paper, we illustrate how this symmetry is highly sensitive to material properties by varying the thickness of the ferroelectric layer and the doping of the silicon substrate. We show that the SHG conversion gain and the spectral purity are greatly increased (up to 96%) by precisely tuning the ferroelectric polarization reversal and the quantum tunneling currents. Based on this, we propose and experimentally demonstrate the generation of the difference and of the sum of two input frequencies (frequency mixing) with a single FeFET, which we attribute to the inherently strong quadratic component of the symmetric transfer characteristics. Because of the reversible and continuous ferroelectric switching in HfO2, our approach allows for an electrical control of the energy distribution of spectral components, thus opening up new and very promising paths for frequency manipulations with simple ferroelectric devices.","Mulaosmanovic, Halid; Dünkel, Stefan; Trentzsch, Martin; Beyer, Sven; Breyer, Evelyn T; Mikolajick, Thomas; Slesazeck, Stefan",ACS appl. mater. interfaces (Online),430,16

OBJECTIVE: To unravel the most challenging aspects of COVID-19 in a nonclinical adult population and identify predictors of lost balance and consequent allostatic overload (AO). We examined the role of regular, moderate-intensity formula aerobic exercise (312 meridian exercise) in preventing allostatic overload through increasing well-being. METHODS: An online survey was conducted to measure CO-VID-related allostatic overload according to clinimetric criteria. The Psychosocial Index (PSI), Kellner's Symptom Questionnaire (KSQ), short Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS-21), Public Health Surveillance Well-Being Scale -(PHS-WB), and Whiteley-7 were used to explore mental health characteristics. Univariate statistics logistic regression analysis and a general linear model were used. RESULTS: According to 442 valid answers, 217 adults practiced physical exercise (PE) frequently (fPE, 3-5 times/every day) while 120 did it less regularly (1-2 times/week), and 105 did not exercise/practiced irregularly (controls). Restriction-related stressors were most challenging, resulting in AO in 29% (n = 128) of the sample. The main predictors were additional stressors (p = 0.005) and anxiety symptoms (p < 0.001). The prevalence of AO was lower (p = 0.018) in the fPE group when compared to controls. KSQ distress symptoms were also lower in fPE (p < 0.0001), while total well-being was increased (p < 0.001) after adjusting for sex, age, and number of chronic diseases. According to the PHS-WB, both physical and mental well-being were higher (p = 0.003 and p = 0.004, respectively) in fPE.

We aimed to determine presence and impact of SUD in recently hospitalized patients with cirrhosis, which has not been previously described. METHODS: This is a retrospective study of consecutive patients with cirrhosis seen at a post-discharge hepatology clinic. The presence of clinically-recognized SUD and documented establishment of addiction treatment, as noted in routine clinical care, was determined through medical record review. Number of hospitalizations, 30-day readmissions, and all-cause mortality at 1 year were also examined. RESULTS: Among 99 patients, 72% were male and the median age was 55 years. The most common etiologies of cirrhosis were alcohol-related liver disease and hepatitis C infection. Alcohol use disorder was documented in 71%. Nearly all patients with clinically-recognized SUD underwent social work evaluation during hospitalization and 65% were referred to addiction treatment. Establishment of addiction care at follow up was documented in 35%. Documented SUD was associated with greater odds of hospitalization over 1 year (adjusted odds ratio 5.77, 95% confidence interval [1.36, 24.49], Pâ=â0.017), but not with 30-day readmissions or mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Clinically-recognized SUD was common in recently hospitalized patients with cirrhosis and associated with at least 1 other hospitalization within a year.

Cadmium stress stimulated endogenous melatonin production to a greater extent in the Cd-tolerant Malus baccata Borkh. than in the Cd-susceptible Malus micromalus 'qingzhoulinqin'. Melatonin application attenuated Cd-induced reductions in growth, photosynthesis and enzyme activity, as well as reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde accumulation. Melatonin treatment more effectively restored photosynthesis, photosynthetic pigments and biomass in Cd-challenged M. micromalus 'qingzhoulinqin' than in Cd-stressed M. baccata. Exogenous melatonin lowered root Cd2+ uptake, reduced leaf Cd accumulation, decreased Cd translocation factors and increased root, stem and leaf melatonin contents in both Cd-exposed rootstocks. Melatonin application increased both antioxidant concentrations and enzyme activities to scavenge Cd-induced ROS. Exogenous melatonin treatment altered the mRNA levels of several genes regulating Cd uptake, transport and detoxification including HA7, NRAMP1, NRAMP3, HMA4, PCR2, NAS1, MT2, ABCC1 and MHX. Taken together, these results suggest that exogenous melatonin reduced aerial parts Cd accumulation and mitigated Cd toxicity in Malus plants, probably due to the melatonin-mediated Cd allocation in tissues, and induction of antioxidant defense system and transcriptionally regulated key genes involved in detoxification.","He, Jiali; Zhuang, Xiaolei; Zhou, Jiangtao; Sun, Luyang; Wan, Huixue; Li, Huifeng; Lyu, Deguo",Tree Physiol,430,9

We compared product availability, nutritional information, front-of-pack (FOP) labelling, price and price promotions for food and drink products between physical and online supermarkets. DESIGN: For physical stores we collected data on price, price promotions, FOP nutrition labels and nutrition information from a random sample of food and drinks from six UK supermarkets. For online stores we used foodDB, a research-ready dataset of over 14 million observations of food and drink products available in online supermarkets. SETTING: Six large supermarket stores located near Oxford, United Kingdom. PARTICIPANTS: General sample with 295 food and drink products, plus boost samples for both fruit and vegetables, and alcohol. RESULTS: In the general sample, 85% (95% confidence intervals, 80,90%) of products found in physical stores could be matched with an online product. Nutritional information found in the two settings was almost identical e.g. concordance correlation coefficient for energy = 0.995 (0.993,0.996). Presence of FOP labelling and price promotions differed between the two settings (Cohen's kappa = 0.56 (0.45, 0.66) and 0.40 (0.26, 0.55) respectively). Prices were similar between online and physical supermarkets (concordance correlation coefficient > 0.9 for all samples). CONCLUSIONS: Product availability, nutritional information and prices sourced online for these 6 retailers is a good proxy of that found in physical stores. Price promotions and FOP labelling varies between the two settings. Further research should investigate whether this could impact on health inequalities.","Bhatnagar, Prachi; Scarborough, Peter; Kaur, Asha; Dikmen, Derya; Adhikari, Vyas; Harrington, Richard",Public Health Nutr,430,15

Likelihood ratios convert a clinical opinion of pre-test probability to post-test probability, independently of prevalence of disease in the test population. Methods: The authors examined results of PPA (Positive Percent Agreement, sensitivity) and NPA (Negative Percent Agreement, specificity) from 73 laboratory experiments for molecular tests for SARS-CoV-2 as reported to the FIND database, and for two manufacturers' claims in FDA EUA submissions.PPA and NPA were converted to likelihood ratios to calculate post-test probability of disease based on clinical opinion of pre-test probability. Confidence intervals were based on the number of samples tested. An online calculator was created to help clinicians identify false-positive, or false-negative SARS-CoV-2 test results for COVID-19 disease. Results: Laboratory results from the same test methods did not mirror each other or the manufacturer. Laboratory studies showed PPA from 17% to 100% and NPA from 70.4% to 100%. The number of known samples varied 8 to 675 known patient samples, which greatly impacted confidence intervals.

However, stigma and 'a culture of shame' are formidable barriers to mental health services and consequently many doctors and medical students with mental health difficulties continue to suffer in silence despite the availability of effective treatment. Indeed, a recent study on over 2100 female physicians who met the diagnostic criteria for a mental disorder revealed that 50% were reluctant to seek professional help due to fear of exposure to stigma. Left untreated or undertreated, mental health problems in doctors can result in impairment of occupational functioning, compromise patient safety and place considerable strain on the economy (by increasing the amount of sick leave taken). Moreover, the consequences of mental health stigma in the medical profession can be fatal. Dr Daksha Emson, a psychiatrist with bipolar affective disorder, tragically killed herself and her baby daughter during a psychotic episode. An independent inquiry into Dr Emson's death concluded that she was the victim of stigma in the National Health Service. The mental health of medical students and doctors, in all of its aspects, must therefore be addressed with the urgency that it demands. Stephanie Knaak and colleagues conducted a data synthesis of evaluative studies on anti-stigma programmes for healthcare providers and identified six key ingredients one of which was a personal testimony from a trained speaker who has lived experience of mental illness. In this paper we outline a study protocol with the aim of answering the following research question, 'Does attending an anti-stigma programme comprised of a medic with first-hand experience of a mental health condition cause immediate and sustained reductions in mental health stigma from medical students and doctors towards their peers with mental health difficulties?'","Hankir, Ahmed; Fletcher-Rogers, Jessica; Ogunmuyiwa, Julia; Carrick, Frederick R; Zaman, Rashid",Psychiatr Danub,430,1

During the COVID-19 pandemic, the Italian government imposed a strict lockdown for all citizens. People were forced to stay at home, and the length of the lockdown was uncertain. Previous studies analyzed the impact of social distance measures on individuals' mental health, whereas few studies have examined the interplay between the adults' functioning, as parents, during this period and the association with the child's adjustment. The present study tested if maternal distress/coping predicts children's behaviors during the COVID-19 lockdown, hypothesizing a mediation effect via children's emotional experience. Participants were 144 mothers (M age = 39.3, 25-52, SD = 5.6) with children aged 5-10 years (M age = 7.54, SD = 1.6, 82 boys); mothers answered to an online survey. Results indicated that mothers with higher exposure to COVID-19 showed higher levels of distress and higher display of coping attitudes, even if in the structural equation modeling model, the COVID-19 exposure was not a predictor of mothers' distress. Compared with mothers with good coping skills, mothers with higher stress levels were more likely to attribute negative emotions to their children at the expense of their positive emotions. Moreover, children's emotions acted as mediators between maternal distress/coping and children's adaptive/maladaptive behaviors. In conclusion, it is important to support parents during pandemic emergence, by providing them with adequate information to manage the relationship with their children, to reduce their level of distress and to enhance their coping abilities.","Petrocchi, Serena; Levante, Annalisa; Bianco, Federica; Castelli, Ilaria; Lecciso, Flavia",Front Public Health,430,10

The administration of propofol sedation increases the risk of most complications, especially hypoxemia. Nevertheless, propofol has been increasingly used in the United States, and the trend is likely to increase in the years to come. Patient satisfaction and endoscopist satisfaction along with rapid turnover are some of the touted reasons for this trend. However, propofol sedation generally implies deep sedation or general anesthesia. As a result, hypopnea and apnea frequently occur. Inadequate sedation and presence of irritable airway often cause coughing and laryngospasm, both leading to hypoxemia and potential cardiac arrest. Hence, prevention of hypoxemia is of paramount importance. Traditionally, standard nasal cannula is used to administer supplement oxygen. However, it cannot sufficiently provide continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or positive pressure ventilation. Device manufacturers have stepped in to fill this void and created many types of cannulas that provide apneic insufflation of oxygen and CPAP and eliminate dead space. Such measures decrease the incidence of hypoxemia. This review aimed to provide essential information of some of these devices.","Goudra, Basavana; Gouda, Gowri; Singh, Preet Mohinder",,430,16

The purpose of our study was to assess whether there is an economic and ecological difference in the application of reusable surgical masks versus disposable surgical masks. Methods: We developed a de novo model that took into account the characteristics of the Belgian hospital market: 52000 beds, 2 healthcare FTE per bed, and the ability to rely on a disposable surgical mask versus a reusable surgical mask that could be reused up to 35 times. We considered the following costs: product cost, medical waste, logistics, and washing. Results: From an ecological and supply chain point of view the implementation of reusable masks could result in a reduction of 92.000 Kilograms of medical waste and 90% less warehouse space required. From an economic point of view when the cost per disposable mask goes above 0.10 € per unit, material economic savings were identified. As from 0.15 € per unit of disposable masks, economic savings varied between 1.5 million and 10 million € per year. The critical factors that define the possible economic savings include: the base price of the reusable mask, the cost of washing, as well as the number of times that a mask could be reused. Conclusions: Health systems may benefit from the inclusion of reusable surgical masks versus disposable surgical masks. This benefit is fourfold. Gains could be achieved from an ecological, supply chain risk mitigation, warehousing optimization, as well as from an economic perspective.","Dierick, K.",Value in Health,430,2

Despite the infection causes a mild illness to most people, some patients are severely affected, demanding an urgent need to better understand how to risk-stratify infected subjects. DESIGN: This is a meta-analysis of observational studies evaluating cardiovascular (CV) complications in hospitalized COVID-19 patients and the impact of cardiovascular risk factors (RF) or comorbidities on mortality. METHODS: Data sources: PubMed, Scopus, and ISI from 1 December 2019 through 11 June 2020; references of eligible studies; scientific session abstracts; cardiology web sites. We selected studies reporting clinical outcomes of hospitalized patients with COVID-19. The main outcome was death. Secondary outcomes were cardiovascular symptoms and cardiovascular events developed during the COVID-19-related hospitalization. Extracted data were recorded in excel worksheets and analysed using statistical software (MedCalc, OpenMetanalyst, R). We used the proportion with 95% CI as the summary measure. A Freeman-Tukey transformation was used to calculate the weighted summary proportion under the random-effects model. Heterogeneity was assessed by using the Cochran Q test and I2 values. RESULTS: Among 77317 hospitalized patients from 21 studies, 12.86% had cardiovascular comorbidities or RF. Cardiovascular complications were registered in 14.09% of cases during hospitalization. At meta-regression analysis, pre-existing cardiovascular comorbidities or RF were significantly associated to cardiovascular complications in COVID-19 patients (p = 0.019). Pre-existing cardiovascular comorbidities or RF (p<0.001), older age (p<0.001), and the development of cardiovascular complications during the hospitalization (p = 0.038) had a significant interaction with death. CONCLUSIONS: Cardiovascular complications are frequent among COVID-19 patients, and might contribute to adverse clinical events and mortality, together with pre-existing cardiovascular comorbidities and RF. Clinicians worldwide should be aware of this association, to identifying patients at higher risk.","Sabatino, Jolanda; De Rosa, Salvatore; Di Salvo, Giovanni; Indolfi, Ciro",PLoS One,430,21

Strained healthcare providers make difficult decisions on patient triage, treatment and care management on a daily basis. Policy makers have imposed social distancing measures to slow the disease, at a steep economic price. We design analytical tools to support these decisions and combat the pandemic. Specifically, we propose a comprehensive data-driven approach to understand the clinical characteristics of COVID-19, predict its mortality, forecast its evolution, and ultimately alleviate its impact. By leveraging cohort-level clinical data, patient-level hospital data, and census-level epidemiological data, we develop an integrated four-step approach, combining descriptive, predictive and prescriptive analytics. First, we aggregate hundreds of clinical studies into the most comprehensive database on COVID-19 to paint a new macroscopic picture of the disease. Second, we build personalized calculators to predict the risk of infection and mortality as a function of demographics, symptoms, comorbidities, and lab values. Third, we develop a novel epidemiological model to project the pandemic's spread and inform social distancing policies. Fourth, we propose an optimization model to re-allocate ventilators and alleviate shortages. Our results have been used at the clinical level by several hospitals to triage patients, guide care management, plan ICU capacity, and re-distribute ventilators. At the policy level, they are currently supporting safe back-to-work policies at a major institution and vaccine trial location planning at Janssen Pharmaceuticals, and have been integrated into the US Center for Disease Control's pandemic forecast.","Bertsimas, Dimitris; Boussioux, Leonard; Cory-Wright, Ryan; Delarue, Arthur; Digalakis, Vassilis; Jacquillat, Alexandre; Kitane, Driss Lahlou; Lukin, Galit; Li, Michael; Mingardi, Luca; Nohadani, Omid; Orfanoudaki, Agni; Papalexopoulos, Theodore; Paskov, Ivan; Pauphilet, Jean; Lami, Omar Skali; Stellato, Bartolomeo; Bouardi, Hamza Tazi; Carballo, Kimberly Villalobos; Wiberg, Holly; Zeng, Cynthia",Health care manag. sci,430,16

The COVID-19 pandemic created disruptions in daily life; however, it is unknown whether the pandemic's disruptions affected the ability for adults with T2DM to control their condition. This study aims to fill the knowledge gap with the experiences of adults with T2DM in Arkansas, U.S. during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This study analyzed cross-sectional, observational survey data collected from adults (&#8805;18 years) who live, work, or receive healthcare in Arkansas; self-reported a diagnosis of T2DM; and completed the diabetes module of the Impact of COVID-19 online survey (n = 131) fielded in July-August 2020. Descriptive statistics were used to characterize the sample and survey responses, and multivariate regression was used to identify demographics, self-care behaviors, and access issues associated with uncontrolled T2DM (HbA1c &#8805; 9% or 74.9 mmol/mol) or with an increase in HbA1c. RESULTS: 28.2% reported an increase in their HbA1c since the pandemic began, and 18.2% had uncontrolled T2DM. Educational level, eating healthily, and weight gain were negatively associated with uncontrolled T2DM.

METHODS: Adults aged 18-64 years with current private (n=124,746), public (n=30,932), or no (n=31,802) insurance coverage were identified from the 2011-2018 National Health Interview Survey. Data were analyzed in 2020. Separate multivariable logistic regressions evaluated the associations of having coverage disruptions or being uninsured with care access, receipt, and affordability. RESULTS: Overall, 5.0% of currently insured adults with private and 10.7% with public insurance reported a coverage disruption in the previous year, representing nearly 9.1 million adults in 2018. Among currently uninsured, 24.9% reported coverage loss within the previous year, representing nearly 8.1 million adults in 2018. Among adults with current private or current public coverage, disruptions were associated with lower receipt of all preventive services (AOR=0.42, 95% CI=0.37, 0.46 and AOR=0.48, 95% CI=0.40, 0.58, respectively), with forgoing any needed care because of cost (AOR=4.79, 95% CI=4.44, 5.17 and AOR=4.28, 95% CI=3.86, 4.75), and with medication nonadherence because of cost (AOR=3.55, 95% CI=3.13, 4.03 and AOR=4.09, 95% CI=3.43, 4.88) compared with that among adults with continuous coverage (p<0.05). Longer disruptions among currently insured adults were significantly associated with worse care access, receipt, and affordability, with dose-response patterns. Currently uninsured adults, especially those with longer uninsured periods, reported significantly worse care access, receipt, and affordability than currently insured adults with coverage disruptions or continuous coverage. CONCLUSIONS: Findings highlight the importance of continuous insurance coverage; disruptions owing to the COVID-19 pandemic will likely have adverse consequences for care access and affordability.","Yabroff, K Robin; Zhao, Jingxuan; Halpern, Michael T; Fedewa, Stacey A; Han, Xuesong; Nogueira, Leticia M; Zheng, Zhiyuan; Jemal, Ahmedin",Am J Prev Med,430,29

In the present study, we used the COVIDSeq protocol, which involves multiplex-PCR, barcoding, and sequencing of samples for high-throughput detection and deciphering the genetic epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2. We used the approach on 752 clinical samples in duplicates, amounting to a total of 1536 samples which could be sequenced on a single S4 sequencing flow cell on NovaSeq 6000. Our analysis suggests a high concordance between technical duplicates and a high concordance of detection of SARS-CoV-2 between the COVIDSeq as well as RT-PCR approaches. An in-depth analysis revealed a total of six samples in which COVIDSeq detected SARS-CoV-2 in high confidence which were negative in RT-PCR. Additionally, the assay could detect SARS-CoV-2 in 21 samples and 16 samples which were classified inconclusive and pan-sarbeco positive respectively suggesting that COVIDSeq could be used as a confirmatory test. The sequencing approach also enabled insights into the evolution and genetic epidemiology of the SARS-CoV-2 samples. The samples were classified into a total of 3 clades. This study reports two lineages B.1.112 and B.1.99 for the first time in India. This study also revealed 1,143 unique single nucleotide variants and added a total of 73 novel variants identified for the first time.

The results indicate that the attenuation of soil gas concentration with lateral diffusion is observed to be the most significant if with a low-permeability soil layer at the bottom and a high-permeability layer on top, followed by the cases with the uniform soil properties, and the lateral attenuation is the least significant in cases with a high-permeability soil layer at the bottom and a low-permeability soil layer on top, regardless of the surface coverage. Compared to soil heterogeneity, the influences of surface conditions are less significant, and the capping effect of surface cover can only play a role in determining shallow soil gas concentration profiles.

We aimed to characterise and compare clinical, biochemical and haematological features, in addition to clinical outcomes, between these patients. METHODS: This multi-centre, retrospective, observational study enrolled 488 SARS-CoV-2 positive patients - 339 with CA infection and 149 with HA infection. All patients were admitted to a hospital within the University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay NHS Foundation Trust between March 7th and May 18th, 2020. RESULTS: The CA cohort comprised of a significantly younger population, median age 75 years, versus 80 years in the HA cohort (P = 0·0002). Significantly less patients in the HA group experienced fever (P = 0·03) and breathlessness (P < 0·0001). Furthermore, significantly more patients had anaemia and hypoalbuminaemia in the HA group, compared to the CA group (P < 0·0001 for both). Hypertension and a lower median BMI were also significantly more pronounced in the HA cohort (P = 0·03 and P = 0·0001, respectively). The mortality rate was not significantly different between the two cohorts (34% in the CA group and 32% in the HA group, P = 0·64). However, the CA group required significantly greater ICU care (10% versus 3% in the HA group, P = 0·009).

In the first COVID-19 year there was limited tapping of the private sectors potential to scale up testing in Kenya. In April 2020, we initiated a unique public-private partnership (PPP) project in Kisumu County connecting the private sector to centralized testing supported by the ministry of health (MoH), COVID-Dx, to accelerate the local response to COVID-19. Within COVID-Dx, we aimed to demonstrate this PPPs performance as a replicable model for effective public-private collaboration in responding to the COVID-19 pandemic in similar settings. METHODSKEMRI, Department of Health Kisumu County, PharmAccess Foundation, and local faith-based and private healthcare facilities collaborated in COVID-Dx. COVID-Dx was implemented from June 01, 2020, to March 31, 2021, in Kisumu County, Kenya. Trained laboratory technologists in participating healthcare facilities collected nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal samples from patients meeting the MoH COVID-19 case definition. Samples were tested at the central laboratory in KEMRI via SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR. Healthcare workers in participating facilities collected data using the digitized MoH COVID-19 Case Identification Form. We shared aggregated results from these data via (semi-) live dashboard to all relevant stakeholders. We did descriptive statistical analyses using Stata 16 to inform project processes. RESULTSNine facilities participated in the project. A total of 4,324 PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2 were done, with 425 positives. We noted differences in positivity rates between the facilities. Healthcare workers were the largest group tested in the project, 1009, representing 43% of the Kisumu healthcare workforce. CONCLUSIONCOVID-Dx can serve as a model for PPPs scale-up testing, especially LMICs, and digitizing the MoH case report form improved reporting efficiency, demonstrating that digital is the way forward.

Older adults (over age 65) are perceived as most physiologically vulnerable to COVID-19 and at risk of secondary mental health challenges related to social isolation imposed by virus containment strategies. To mitigate concerns regarding sampling bias we used a random sampling of older adults to understand uptake and acceptance of technologies to support socialization during the pandemic. OBJECTIVE: To conduct a population-based assessment of the barriers and facilitators to engaging in technology use for virtual socialization amongst older adults in the Canadian province of British Columbia during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional population-based regionally representative survey using random-digit dialing to participants over age 65 living in British Columbia. Data were analyzed using SPSS, with open-text responses analyzed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: Respondents included 400 older adults with an average age of 72 years old and 63.7% female. Most respondents (89.5%) were aware of how to use technology to connect with others and slightly more than half (56%) reported using technology differently to connect with others during the pandemic. 55.9% of respondents reported adopting new technology since the beginning of the pandemic. Older adults reported key barriers to using technology including: (1) lack of access (including finance, knowledge, and age); (2) lack of interest (including a preference for telephone, and a general lack of interest in computers); and (3) physical barriers (resultant of cognitive impairments, stroke, and arthritis). Older adults reported numerous facilitators, including: (1) knowledge of technologies (whether self-taught or via external courses); (2) reliance on others (family, friends, and general internet searching); (3) technology accessibility (including environments, user-friendly technology, and receiving clear instructions); and (4) social motivation (because everyone else is doing it). CONCLUSIONS: Much data on older adults use of technology is limited by sampling biases, but the current study that used random sampling demonstrated that older adults used technology to mitigate social isolation during the pandemic. Virtual socialization is most promising to mitigate potential mental health effects related to virus containment strategies. Addressing barriers by mobilizing telephone training and task lists, and mobilizing facilitators described by participants such as facilitated socialization activities are important strategies that can be implemented within and beyond the pandemic to bolster the mental health needs of older adults.","Haase, Kristen R; Cosco, Theodore; Kervin, Lucy; Riadi, Indira; O039,; Connell, Megan E",,430,15

We overcome this limitation using data from the U.S. Current Population Survey’s COVID-19 supplement to study pandemic-related labor-force outcomes in rural and urban areas from May 2020 through February 2021. We find the pandemic has generally had more severe labor-force impacts on urban adults than their rural counterparts. Urban adults were more often to go unpaid for missed hours, to be unable to work, and to be unable to look for work due to COVID-19. However, rural workers were less likely to work remotely than urban workers. These differences persist even when adjusting for adults’ socioeconomic characteristics and state-level factors. Our results suggest that rural-urban differences in the nature of work during the pandemic cannot be explained by well-known demographic and political differences between rural and urban America. © The Author(s) 2021.","Brooks, M.

This review will explore the data supporting the use of RPM via both implantable and wearable devices in the field of cardiology and the role of home monitoring using RPM in the era of COVID-19. RECENT FINDINGS: RPM using implantable cardiac devices is a safe alternative to in-person only visits which leads to enhanced patient satisfaction and improved clinical outcomes. Consumer-grade wearable sensors have drastically expanded RPM capabilities from just the sickest cardiac patients to the entire population aiding in early diagnosis and real-time disease management. Home monitoring enabled by automated alert systems tailored specifically to the needs of the patient by the provider will be the cornerstone of a more continuous, patent-centric healthcare model.","Miller, Jennifer C; Skoll, Devin; Saxon, Leslie A",Curr Cardiol Rep,430,29

Decontamination of PPE could be useful to maintain adequate supplies, but there is uncertainty regarding the efficacy of decontamination technologies. Methods: A modification of the American Society for Testing and Materials standard quantitative carrier disk test method (ASTM E-2197-11) was used to examine the effectiveness of 3 methods, including ultraviolet-C (UV-C) light, a high-level disinfection cabinet that generates aerosol-ized peracetic acid and hydrogen peroxide, and dry heat at 70°C for 30 minutes. We assessed the decontamination of 3 commercial N95 respirators inoculated with methicillin-resistant Staphy-lococcus aureus (MRSA) and bacteriophages MS2 and Phi6; the latter is an enveloped RNA virus used as a surrogate for coronaviruses. Three and 6 log10reductions on respirators were considered effective for decontamination and disinfection, respectively. Results: UV-C administered as a 1-minute cycle in a UV-C box or a 30-minute cycle by a room decontamination device reduced contamination but did not meet criteria for decontamination of the viruses from all sites on the N95s. The high-level disinfection cabinet was effective for decontamination of the N95s and achieved disinfection with an extended 31-minute cycle. Dry heat at 70°C for 30 minutes was not effective for decontamination of the bacteriophages. Conclusions: UV-C could be useful to reduce contamination on N95 respirators. However, the UV-C technologies studied did not meet pre-established criteria for decontamination under the test conditions used. The high-level disinfection cabinet was more effective and met criteria for disinfection with an extended cycle.","Cadnum, Jennifer L.; Li, Daniel F.; Redmond, Sarah N.; John, Amrita R.; Pearlmutter, Basya; Donskey, Curtis J.",Pathog.

Until now, few antiviral medications (e.g., remdesivir) or drugs that target inflammatory complications associated with SARS-CoV2 infection have been considered safe by public health authorities. By the end of November 2020, this crisis had led to >1 million deaths and revealed the high susceptibility of people with pre-existing comorbidities (e.g., obesity, diabetes, coronary heart disease, hypertension) to suffer from a severe form of the disease. Elderly people have also been found to be highly susceptible to SARS-CoV2 infection and morbidity. Gastrointestinal manifestations and gut microbial alterations observed in SARS-CoV2-infected hospitalized patients have raised awareness of the potential role of intestinal mechanisms in increasing the severity of the disease. It is therefore critically important to find alternative or complementary approaches, not only to prevent or treat the disease, but also to reduce its growing societal and economic burden. In this review, we explore potential nutritional strategies that implicate the use of polyphenols, probiotics, vitamin D, and &#969;-3 fatty acids with a focus on the gut microbiome, and that could lead to concrete recommendations that are easily applicable to both vulnerable people with pre-existing metabolic comorbidities and the elderly, but also to the general population.","Daoust, Laurence; Pilon, Geneviève; Marette, André",Adv Nutr,430,16

To this point, epidemiological, clinical and experimental evidence supports the existence of a unique disease entity termed ""obesity cardiomyopathy"", which develops independent of hypertension, coronary heart disease and other heart diseases. Our contemporary review evaluates the evidence for this pathological condition, examines putative responsible mechanisms, and discusses therapeutic options for this disorder. Clinical findings have consolidated the presence of left ventricular dysfunction in obesity. Experimental investigations have uncovered pathophysiological changes in myocardial structure and function in genetically-predisposed and diet-induced obesity. Indeed, contemporary evidence consolidates a wide array of cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the etiology of obesity cardiomyopathy including adipose tissue dysfunction, systemic inflammation, metabolic disturbances (insulin resistance, abnormal glucose transport, spillover of free fatty acids, lipotoxicity, and amino acid derangement), altered intracellular especially mitochondrial Ca2+ homeostasis, oxidative stress, autophagy/mitophagy defect, myocardial fibrosis, dampened coronary flow reserve, coronary microvascular disease (microangiopathy), and endothelial impairment. Given the important role of obesity in the increased risk of heart failure, especially that with preserved systolic function and the recent rises in COVID-19-associated cardiovascular mortality, this review should provide compelling evidence for the presence of obesity cardiomyopathy, independent of various comorbid conditions, underlying mechanisms, and offer new insights into potential therapeutic approaches (pharmacological and lifestyle modification) for the clinical management of obesity cardiomyopathy.","Ren, Jun; Wu, Ne N; Wang, Shuyi; Sowers, James R; Zhang, Yingmei",Physiol. rev,430,21

Significant clinical presentations of COVID-19 include respiratory symptoms and pneumonia. In a minority of patients, extrapulmonary organs (central nervous system, eyes, heart, and gut) are affected, with detection of viral RNA in bodily secretions (stool, tears, and saliva). Infection of such extrapulmonary organs may serve as a reservoir for SARS-CoV-2, representing a potential source of viral shedding after the cessation of respiratory symptoms in recovered patients or in asymptomatic individuals. It is extremely important to understand this phenomenon, as individuals with intermittent virus shedding could be falsely identified as reinfected and may benefit from ongoing antiviral treatment. The potential of SARS-CoV-2 infection to rapidly disseminate and infect extrapulmonary organs is likely mediated through the nonstructural and accessory proteins of SARS-CoV-2, which act as ligands for host cells, and through evasion of host immune responses. The focus of this perspective is the extrapulmonary tissues affected by SARS-CoV-2 and the potential implications of their involvement for disease pathogenesis and the development of medical countermeasures.","Kalkeri, Raj; Goebel, Scott; Sharma, Guru Dutt",Am J Trop Med Hyg,430,26

In April 2020, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent lockdown Connect Health had to cancel 10 student placements as we transitioned to virtual consultations for all clinics. This cancellation of student placements was replicated across the nation with many Higher Education Institutes reporting a backlog of student placements. Without the requisite placement hours students are unable to progress into the next academic year or are unable to graduate. This then reduces the flow of new-graduate physiotherapists into the workforce at a time when there is a plan to grow the physiotherapy workforce to meet primary care demand. In response to this problem a novel placement model to facilitate virtual student placements ('virtual placements') was developed, tested and then rolled out across Connect Health using the Plan-Do-Study-Act quality improvement methodology. The model combines shadowing a broad range of virtual clinics with delivery of patient-facing online exercise classes via the Facebook Live platform and completion of virtual projects to support knowledge consolidation. This virtual student placement model enabled an increase in student capacity of over 400% compared with 2018-2019 with 182 students starting between May and August 2020. The model runs using widely available technology, requires no additional investment and has enabled these students to continue their studies and progress towards qualifying as physiotherapists.","Twogood, Rory; Hares, Elly; Wyatt, Matthew; Cuff, Andrew",,430,21

We aimed at estimating this risk by age and sex, after the first dose of both adenovirus vector-based and mRNA-based Covid-19 vaccines, and after the second dose of m-RNA vaccines. MethodsIn this population-based retrospective cohort study, we examined three groups: 1 662 719 people 10 years of age and over vaccinated with the first dose of a Covid-19 vaccine, 622 778 with the second dose, and 190 616 diagnosed of Covid-19 in the same period (between1 January 2021 and 18 April 2021). The rates of various clinical presentations of VTE and TCP were compared with those in the reference population (7 013 040 people served by the health care system in 2919). The two primary outcomes were the observed 21 day rate of a composite variable of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, mesenteric thrombosis, portal vein thrombosis, or any venous thromboembolism (VTE) associated with thrombocytopenia (TCP), and the rate of any VTE associated with TCP (VTE+TCP). Analyses were standardised by age and sex. FindingsThe 21 day rate per 100 000 of the primary composite variable was 2{middle dot}15 in the reference population, 5{middle dot}65 following the first vaccine dose (standardised difference, 2{middle dot}53 (95 percent confidence interval, 1{middle dot}04- 4{middle dot}00), and 7{middle dot}23 following the second dose (standardised difference, 4{middle dot}07 (95 percent confidence interval, 1{middle dot}43-6{middle dot}70). The event rates of VTE+TCP and of all the secondary variables showed the same patterns. Excess event rates were higher in men than in women, and they were not especially increased in any particular age group. All Covid-19 vaccines were associated with increased rates of the outcome variables. Excess event rates were many-fold higher in the Covid-19 cohort. InterpretationWe observed small increases of rates of venous thromboembolism in usual and unusual anatomical sites and of thrombocytopenia in recipients of both adenovirus vector and mRNA vaccines against Covid-19. Excess rates were higher in men than in women and they were not particularly elevated in any specific age group. Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSCovid-19 increases the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in common and in unusual anatomical sites, and the risk of thrombocytopenia (TCP). This risk increases with age. Case reports of VTE and TCP after Covid-19 vaccination with VaxZevria(R), an adenovirus vector Covid-19 vaccine, suggested that the risk concentrates in young women. One study based on systematic ascertainment found 11 excess VTE events per 100 000 first doses, but people over 65 years were excluded. It is not known whether mRNA-based Covid-19 vaccines are associated with increased risks of VTE and TCP. What this study addsRecipients of Covid-19 vaccines had increased rates of VTE in usual and in unusual anatomical sites, of TCP, and of VTE associated with TCP. These rates were many-fold lower than those in Covid-19 patients, they were two fold in men compared with women, and they were not concentrated in any particular age group. Both recipients of adenovirus vector-based and of mRNA-based Covid-19 vaccines had increased rates of VTE, TCP, and VTE associated with TCP, after the first dose and after the second dose. Our data should be considered when designing selective targeting of the various Covid-19 vaccines to different age groups in vaccination campaigns.","Laporte, Joan-Ramon; Coma, Ermengol; Fina, Francesc; Garcia-Eroles, Luis; Vidal, Xavier; Medina, Manuel",,430,30

METHODS: After identification on February 28, 2020, of a confirmed case of Covid-19 in a skilled nursing facility in King County, Washington, Public Health-Seattle and King County, aided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, launched a case investigation, contact tracing, quarantine of exposed persons, isolation of confirmed and suspected cases, and on-site enhancement of infection prevention and control. RESULTS: As of March 18, a total of 167 confirmed cases of Covid-19 affecting 101 residents, 50 health care personnel, and 16 visitors were found to be epidemiologically linked to the facility. Most cases among residents included respiratory illness consistent with Covid-19; however, in 7 residents no symptoms were documented. Hospitalization rates for facility residents, visitors, and staff were 54.5%, 50.0%, and 6.0%, respectively. The case fatality rate for residents was 33.7% (34 of 101). As of March 18, a total of 30 long-term care facilities with at least one confirmed case of Covid-19 had been identified in King County. CONCLUSIONS: In the context of rapidly escalating Covid-19 outbreaks, proactive steps by long-term care facilities to identify and exclude potentially infected staff and visitors, actively monitor for potentially infected patients, and implement appropriate infection prevention and control measures are needed to prevent the introduction of Covid-19.","McMichael, Temet M; Currie, Dustin W; Clark, Shauna; Pogosjans, Sargis; Kay, Meagan; Schwartz, Noah G; Lewis, James; Baer, Atar; Kawakami, Vance; Lukoff, Margaret D; Ferro, Jessica; Brostrom-Smith, Claire; Rea, Thomas D; Sayre, Michael R; Riedo, Francis X; Russell, Denny; Hiatt, Brian; Montgomery, Patricia; Rao, Agam K; Chow, Eric J; Tobolowsky, Farrell; Hughes, Michael J; Bardossy, Ana C; Oakley, Lisa P; Jacobs, Jesica R; Stone, Nimalie D; Reddy, Sujan C; Jernigan, John A; Honein, Margaret A; Clark, Thomas A; Duchin, Jeffrey S",N Engl J Med,430,29

The results showed that the present method is effecttive to improve students' learning achievement, confirmed by the higher posttest results compared to than those of the pretest. The educational goals of SRL theories were developed through student-directed instructional design online where the students' guide made some input into their learning processes. The students' satisfaction in learning with the SRL framework for the COVID-19 crisis gained a high level, informing that the SRL framework for problem solving during the COVID-19 crisis was useful for teaching and career training. Teaching styles (such as the stable focus, orientation, or intent) constituted the entire patterns of teaching behaviors.

METHODS: We analyzed Instagram posts from five randomly selected days in February 2020. The hashtag, #ivfcommunity, was selected to identify public posts authored by Instagram's IVF community members from multiple treatment centers. Text, photos, hashtags, and emojis were collected from 452 included posts and entered into a study-specific database. Using thematic coding, a four-member team initially coded the first day in February. Common themes were agreed upon by all team members, and a preliminary codebook was created for further analysis. The remaining posts were coded by two-member teams who reached a consensus on the multiple themes assigned to each individual post. RESULTS: Analysis of posts led to the identification of five major themes: documentation of the medical and physical experience of IVF (76.1%), the emotional spectrum (43.1%), social support (49.2%), coping mechanisms (29.9%), and education (receipt, provision) (11.1%). CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that women undergoing IVF often utilize social media to document daily experiences, offer and recognize sources of community support, and provide and receive education regarding their treatments. Given the increased prevalence of mental health conditions, medical providers should explore challenges discussed on online platforms and consider harnessing the supportive nature of online communities to supplement care for IVF patients.","Perone, Hanna R; Herweck, Alexandra M; Stump, Hannah M; Levine, Hannah M; Wong, Adriana J; Carugno, Jose",J. assist. reprod. genet,430,19

In order to understand why this is the case, the opinions of users of engineering design tools were gathered. The results from a survey showing the attitudes of engineers and students with design experience with respect to optimisation algorithms are presented. A survey was designed to answer two research questions: To what extent is there a pre-existing sentiment (negative or positive) among students, engineers, and managers towards genetic algorithm-based design? and What are the requirements of practitioners with regards to design optimisation and the design optimisation process? A total of 23 participants (N = 23) took part in the 3-part mixed methods survey. Thematic analysis was conducted on the open-ended questions. A common thread throughout participants responses is that there is a question of trust towards genetic algorithms within industry. Perhaps surprising is that the key to gaining this trust is not producing good results, but creating algorithms which explain the process they take in reaching a result. Participants have expressed a desire to continue to remain in the design loop. This is at odds with the motivation of a portion of the genetic algorithms community of removing humans from the loop. It is clear we need to take a different approach to increase industrial uptake. Based on this, the following recommendations have been made to increase their use in industry: an increase of transparency and explainability of genetic algorithms, an increased focus on user experience, better communication between developers and engineers, and visualising algorithm behaviour.","Vincalek, Jakub; Walton, Sean; Evans, Ben",,430,32

DESIGN: Descriptive, cross-sectional study. STUDY SAMPLE: Individuals with permanent hearing loss (n = 278) answered a questionnaire designed to identify potential obstacles caused by using hearing aids during the COVID-19 pandemic, along with the reasons and deleterious effects associated with the devices. Each category reflected challenges in communicating, learning, and working during the pandemic. Different response categories were compared using descriptive and inferential statistics. RESULTS: The duration of daily device usage before the imposed lockdown was significantly higher than that during (Z = -2.01, p < 0.05), potentially attributable to the pandemic-induced difficulties faced by hearing-technology users. Such challenges include the shortage of batteries for hearing devices, limited access to repair or programming services of said devices and accessories, termination of speech therapy sessions, and obstacles to employment and education. CONCLUSIONS: Among audiologists, efficiency and professionalism are required to educate the public and private health sectors regarding the prevalent challenges and their harmful impact on hearing-technology users during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Anxiety was measured by the 8-item version of the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System. Resilience was evaluated by the 10-item Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale. Stress was assessed using a PRSF inventory. RESULTS: Physicians reported high levels of anxiety with a mean score of 59.20 ± 7.95. We found an inverse association between resilience and anxiety. Four salient PRSF (mental exhaustion, anxiety about being infected, anxiety infecting family members, and sleep difficulties) positively associated with anxiety scores. CONCLUSIONS: Our study identified specific PRSF including workload burden and fear of infection that are associated with increased anxiety and resilience that is associated with reduced anxiety among physicians.","Mosheva, Mariela; Hertz-Palmor, Nimrod; Dorman Ilan, Shirel; Matalon, Noam; Pessach, Itai M; Afek, Arnon; Ziv, Amitai; Kreiss, Yitshak; Gross, Raz; Gothelf, Doron",Depress. anxiety,430,1

Thus, our aim was to gather all available information regarding comorbidities, clinical signs and symptoms, outcomes, laboratory findings, imaging features, and treatments in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: EMBASE, PubMed/Medline, Scopus, and Web of Science were searched for studies published in any language between December 1st, 2019 and March 28th, 2020. Original studies were included if the exposure of interest was an infection with SARS-CoV-2 or confirmed COVID-19. The primary outcome was the risk ratio of comorbidities, clinical signs and symptoms, laboratory findings, imaging features, treatments, outcomes, and complications associated with COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. We performed random-effects pairwise meta-analyses for proportions and relative risks, I2, T2, and Cochrane Q, sensitivity analyses, and assessed publication bias. RESULTS: 148 studies met the inclusion criteria for the systematic review and meta-analysis with 12'149 patients (5'739 female) and a median age of 47.0 [35.0-64.6] years. 617 patients died from COVID-19 and its complication. 297 patients were reported as asymptomatic. Older age (SMD: 1.25 [0.78-1.72]; p < 0.001), being male (RR = 1.32 [1.13-1.54], p = 0.005) and pre-existing comorbidity (RR = 1.69 [1.48-1.94]; p < 0.001) were identified as risk factors of in-hospital mortality. The heterogeneity between studies varied substantially (I2; range: 1.5-98.2%). Publication bias was only found in eight studies (Egger's test: p < 0.05).

Our objective was to determine the pooled prevalence of AKI and KRT among hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Study Design: Systematic Review and Meta-analysis. Data sources: Medline, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and a registry of preprinted studies, published up to 14 Oct 2020. Study Selection: Eligible studies reported the prevalence of AKI in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 according to the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) definition. Data Extraction and Synthesis: We extracted data on patient characteristics, the proportion of patients developing AKI and commencing KRT, important clinical outcomes (discharge from hospital, ongoing hospitalization and death), and risk of bias. Outcomes and Measures: We calculated the pooled prevalence of AKI and receipt of KRT, along with 95% confidence intervals (CI) using a random effects model. We performed subgroup analysis based on admission to an intensive care unit (ICU). Results: Of 2,711 records reviewed, we included 53 published and 1 preprint study in the analysis, which comprised 30,657 hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Data on AKI were available for 30,639 patients (n=54 studies), and the receipt of KRT for 27,525 patients (n=48 studies). The pooled prevalence of AKI was 28% (95% CI 22% to 34%; I2=99%), and the pooled prevalence of KRT was 9% (95% CI 7% to 11%; I2=97). The pooled prevalence of AKI among patients admitted to the ICU was 46% (95% CI 35% to 57%, I2=99%) and 19% of all ICU patients with COVID-19 (95% CI 15% to 22%; I2=88%) commenced KRT. Limitations: There was significant heterogeneity among the included studies which remained unaccounted for in sub-group analysis. Conclusions: AKI complicated the course of nearly 1 in 3 patients hospitalized with COVID-19. The risk of AKI was higher in critically ill patients with a substantial number receiving KRT at rates higher than the general ICU population. Since COVID-19 will be a public health threat for the foreseeable future, these estimates should help guide KRT resource planning.","Silver, Samuel A; Beaubien-Souligny, William; Shah, Prakesh S; Harel, Shai; Blum, Daniel; Kishibe, Teruko; Meraz-Munoz, Alejandro; Wald, Ron; Harel, Ziv",,430,16

Esse composto passa para a prole através da placenta e do leite, causando redução da formação e do crescimento ósseo. A hipótese deste estudo é que as células tronco mesenquimais (CTMs), os osteoblastos e os condrócitos, responsáveis por originar o esqueleto, possam ser alvos da cafeína. Para tentar elucidar os mecanismos celulares e moleculares pelos quais a cafeína atua sobre essas células, foram realizados quatro experimentos distintos. O objetivo foi avaliar o efeito da cafeína sobre a diferenciação osteogênica das CTMs da medula óssea (experimento 1), atividade de síntese de osteoblastos da calvária (experimento 2) e a atividade de síntese de condrócitos (experimento 3), extraídos da prole de ratas mães que receberam 25, 50 e 100mg/Kg de cafeína durante a gestação (experimento 2 e 3) ou durante a gestação e lactação (experimento 1). No quarto experimento, o objetivo foi avaliar o efeito de diferentes concentrações de cafeína, adicionadas ao meio de cultura, sobre a atividade de síntese de condrócitos extraídos de ratos neonatos. No primeiro e segundo experimentos, foram avaliados a viabilidade celular, a atividade da fosfatase alcalina, a síntese de colágeno e de nódulos mineralizados e a expressão dos transcritos gênicos para osteocalcina, osteopontina, sialoproteína óssea, fosfatase alcalina, colágeno tipo I e Runx-2 por qRT-PCR. No terceiro e quarto experimentos, foram avaliados a viabilidade celular e a atividade de síntese por meio de análises citoquímicas, morfométricas e da quantificação dos transcritos gênicos para Sox-9, Runx-2, agrecano, colágeno tipo II e fosfatase alcalina por qRT-PCR. Os dados dos quatro experimentos foram submetidos a ANOVA com comparação das médias pelo teste SNK. Diferenças foram consideradas significativas se p0,05. Nas CTMs, as doses de 50 e 100mg/Kg de cafeína reduziram a atividade da fosfatase alcalina em todos os períodos estudados e a expressão de colágeno tipo I aos 21 dias. A expressão dos transcritos gênicos para fosfatase alcalina, Runx-2 e sialoproteína óssea e a síntese dos nódulos mineralizados reduziu em todas as doses de cafeína (experimento 1). Os osteoblastos extraídos de filhos de ratas que receberam cafeína na dose de 50mg/Kg durante a gestação apresentaram aumento da síntese de transcritos gênicos para osteocalcina, osteopontina, sialoproteína óssea, fosfatase alcalina e colágeno tipo I, resultando em aumento da síntese de nódulos mineralizados (experimento 2). Nas culturas de condrócitos de todos os grupos tratados com cafeína os efeitos não foram lineares ou dose-dependentes. As culturas de condrócitos extraídos dos grupos tratados com a dose de 25 mg/Kg foram as que apresentaram os menores valores, com redução da viabilidade e da porcentagem de células, da atividade da fosfatase alcalina, da síntese de colágeno e de matriz condrogênica, bem como da expressão de Sox-9, fosfatase alcalina e colágeno tipo I. Culturas de condrócitos do grupo tratado com 50 mg/Kg de cafeína apresentaram redução da síntese de colágeno e da expressão de Sox-9. A dose de 100 mg/Kg reduziu a síntese de colágeno, bem como a expressão de Sox-9 e de fosfatase alcalina (experimento 3). In vitro, a cafeína reduziu significativamente e de forma dose-dependente a redução do MTT em cristais de formazan, a porcentagem de células/campo, a síntese de colágeno, a atividade da fosfatase alcalina e a síntese de matriz condrogênica PAS+, safranina O+, alcian blue+, bem como a expressão dos transcritos gênicos para agrecano, Sox-9 e colágeno tipo II (experimento 4). Conclui-se que os efeitos da cafeína são variáveis de acordo com sua ação in vivo ou in vitro, com sua concentração ou dose e com o tipo de célula sob a qual ela esteja atuando. De forma geral, os efeitos in vivo da cafeína sobre as células tronco e os condrócitos e o efeito in vitro sobre os condrócitos é negativo e danoso, enquanto que seus efeitos in vivo sobre os osteoblastos, nas mesmas doses testadas sobre as CTMs e os condrócitos, são contrários, aumentando a viabilidade e a atividade de síntese dessas células.","REIS, AMANDA MARIA SENA",,430,1

We present an approach for forecasting mental health conditions and emotions of a given population during the COVID-19 pandemic based on language expressions used in social media. This approach permits anticipating high prevalence periods in short- to medium-term time horizons. Design. Mental health conditions and emotions are captured via markers, which link social media contents with lexicons. First, we build descriptive timelines for decision makers to monitor the evolution of markers, and their correlation with crisis events. Second, we model the timelines as time series, and support their forecasting, which in turn serve to identify high prevalence points for the estimated markers. Findings. Results showed that different time series forecasting strategies offer different capabilities. In the best scenario, the emergence of high prevalence periods of emotions and mental health disorders can be satisfactorily predicted with a neural network strategy, even when limited data is available in early stages of a crisis (e.g., 7 days). Originality. Although there have been efforts in the literature to predict mental states of individuals, the analysis of mental health at the collective level has received scarce attention. We take a step forward by proposing a forecasting approach for analyzing the mental health of a given population (or group of individuals) at a larger scale. Practical implications. We believe that this work contributes to a better understanding of how psychological processes related to crisis manifest in social media, being a valuable asset for the design, implementation and monitoring of health prevention and communication policies.","Tommasel, Antonela; Diaz-Pace, Andres; Rodriguez, Juan Manuel; Godoy, Daniela",,430,16

Many of the roles that staff are being allocated to in the intensive care unit and emergency department pose additional risks to themselves, and new policies for staff reallocation are causing distress and uncertainty to the professionals concerned. In this paper, we analyse a range of ethical issues associated with changes to staff allocation processes in the face of COVID-19. In line with a dominant view in the medical ethics literature, we claim, first, that no individual health professional has a specific, positive obligation to treat a patient when doing so places that professional at risk of harm, and so there is a clear ethical tension in any reallocation process in this context. Next, we argue that the changing asymmetries of health needs in hospitals means that careful consideration needs to be given to a stepwise process for deallocating staff from their usual duties. We conclude by considering how a justifiable process of reallocating professionals to high-risk clinical roles should be configured once those who are 'fit for reallocation' have been identified. We claim that this process needs to attend to three questions that we consider in detail: (1) how the choice to make reallocation decisions is made, (2) what justifiable models for reallocation might look like and (3) what is owed to those who are reallocated.","Dunn, Michael; Sheehan, Mark; Hordern, Joshua; Turnham, Helen Lynne; Wilkinson, Dominic",J Med Ethics,430,20

A Global Perspective""",15.07256,5.016843,2020,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly disrupted the food retail environment. However, its impact on fresh fruit and vegetable vendors remains unclear; these are often smaller, more community centered, and may lack the financial infrastructure to withstand supply and demand changes induced by such crises. OBJECTIVE: This study documents the methodology used to assess fresh fruit and vegetable vendor closures in New York City (NYC) following the start of the COVID-19 pandemic by using Google Street View, the new Apple Look Around database, and in-person checks. METHODS: In total, 6 NYC neighborhoods (in Manhattan and Brooklyn) were selected for analysis; these included two socioeconomically advantaged neighborhoods (Upper East Side, Park Slope), two socioeconomically disadvantaged neighborhoods (East Harlem, Brownsville), and two Chinese ethnic neighborhoods (Chinatown, Sunset Park). For each neighborhood, Google Street View was used to virtually walk down each street and identify vendors (stores, storefronts, street vendors, or wholesalers) that were open and active in 2019 (ie, both produce and vendor personnel were present at a location). Past vendor surveillance (when available) was used to guide these virtual walks. Each identified vendor was geotagged as a Google Maps pinpoint that research assistants then physically visited. Using the ""notes"" feature of Google Maps as a data collection tool, notes were made on which of three categories best described each vendor: (1) open, (2) open with a more limited setup (eg, certain sections of the vendor unit that were open and active in 2019 were missing or closed during in-person checks), or (3) closed/absent. RESULTS: Of the 135 open vendors identified in 2019 imagery data, 35% (n=47) were absent/closed and 10% (n=13) were open with more limited setups following the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. When comparing boroughs, 35% (28/80) of vendors in Manhattan were absent/closed, as were 35% (19/55) of vendors in Brooklyn. Although Google Street View was able to provide 2019 street view imagery data for most neighborhoods, Apple Look Around was required for 2019 imagery data for some areas of Park Slope. Past surveillance data helped to identify 3 additional established vendors in Chinatown that had been missed in street view imagery. The Google Maps ""notes"" feature was used by multiple research assistants simultaneously to rapidly collect observational data on mobile devices. CONCLUSIONS: The methodology employed enabled the identification of closures in the fresh fruit and vegetable retail environment and can be used to assess closures in other contexts. The use of past baseline surveillance data to aid vendor identification was valuable for identifying vendors that may have been absent or visually obstructed in the street view imagery data. Data collection using Google Maps likewise has the potential to enhance the efficiency of fieldwork in future studies.","Ali, Shahmir H; Imbruce, Valerie M; Russo, Rienna G; Kaplan, Samuel; Stevenson, Kaye; Mezzacca, Tamar Adjoian; Foster, Victoria; Radee, Ashley; Chong, Stella; Tsui, Felice; Kranick, Julie; Yi, Stella S",JMIR Form Res,430,1

With the increasing number of recovered patients, more attention should be paid to the follow-up of these patients. METHODS: In the study, 576 patients with COVID-19 discharged from hospital in Chongqing, China from January 24, 2020, to March 10, 2020 were evaluated by viral nucleic acid tests for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2(SARS-CoV-2) to determine if they could be released from quarantine. Among the 576 patients, 61 patients (10.6%) had positive RT-PCR test results of SARS-CoV-2. We aimed to analyze the demographics, clinical characteristics and treatment of 61 patients. RESULTS: These positive patients were characterized by older age, chronic medical illness and mild conditions. 38 (62.3%) patients who were asymptomatic without abnormalities on chest radiographs were found in the positive with COVID-19. Also, they showed positive results of stool or sputum specimens with negative results of nasal and pharyngeal swab specimens. The median duration of positive result of SARS-CoV-2 was varied from 3 days to 35 days in the patients discharged from hospital with no family member infection. CONCLUSIONS: Multi-site screening of SARS-CoV-2 including nasal and pharyngeal swabs, stool and sputum specimens could be considered to improve the diagnosis, treatment and infection control in patients with COVID-19.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A previously reported engineered replication-competent PR8 strain carrying luciferase reporter gene (IAV-luc) and multiple pseudotyped IAV and SARS-CoV-2 virus was used. To specifically evaluate the pH change of vesicles containing IAV, we constructed an A549 cell line with endosomal and lysosomal expression of pHluorin2. RESULTS: Here, we identified azithromycin (AZ) as an effective inhibitor against multiple IAV and SARS-CoV-2 strains. We found that AZ treatment could potently inhibit IAV infection in vitro. Moreover, using pseudotyped virus model, AZ could also markedly block the entry of SARS-CoV-2 in HEK293T-ACE2 and Caco2 cells. Mechanistic studies further revealed that such effect was independent of interferon signalling. AZ treatment neither impaired the binding and internalization of IAV virions, nor the viral replication, but rather inhibited the fusion between viral and vacuolar membranes. Using a NPC1-pHluorin2 reporter cell line, we confirmed that AZ treatment could alkalize the vesicles containing IAV virions, thereby preventing pH-dependent membrane fusion. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our findings demonstrate that AZ can exert broad-spectrum antiviral effects against IAV and SARS-CoV-2, and could be served as a potential clinical anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug in emergency as well as a promising lead compound for the development of next-generation anti-IAV drugs.","Du, Xiaohong; Zuo, Xiangyang; Meng, Fang; Han, Chenfeng; Ouyang, Wei; Han, Yu; Gu, Yayun; Zhao, Xin; Xu, Feng; Qin, Frank Xiaofeng",Cell Prolif,430,20

Starting in March, some patients who called 911 and required advanced life support (ALS) may have decompensated more rapidly than would have been expected, possibly because of concomitant COVID19 infection and/or delays in seeking medical care because of fear of exposure to the virus, and social isolation. In this study, our goal was to determine if there was an increase in prehospital ALS pronouncements and a decrease in ED visits for potentially serious conditions such as MI and stroke during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in northern NJ. METHODS STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort of prehospital patients pronounced dead by paramedics and patients with MI and stroke in the EDs of receiving hospitals of these paramedics. Study Setting and Population: Ten ground ALS units in northern NJ and nine receiving hospital EDs. Each ALS unit is staffed by two NJ-certified mobile intensive care paramedics and respond with a paramedic flycar in a two-tiered dispatch system. DATA ANALYSIS: We identified prehospital pronouncements using the EMSCharts electronic record (Zoll Medical, Chelmsford, Massachusetts). We tabulated the number of pronouncements by week from January 1 to June 30 in 2019 and 2020. We tabulated the combined total number of pronouncements and ED visits by month along with visits for MI and stroke and calculated the changes during the same timeframe. We used Chi-square to test for statistical significance for the monthly changes from 2019 to 2020. RESULTS: For January through June in 2019 and 2020, there were 12,210 and 13,200 ALS dispatches, and 366 and 555 prehospital pronouncements, respectively. In 2020, pronouncements rose from a weekly baseline of 13 in early March, reached a peak of 45 at the beginning of April, then returned to the baseline level by the end of May.

RESULTS: 1,028 participants, distributed in: 557 physicians (54.18%), 349 nurses (33.94%), 29 laboratory workers (2.82%), 27 paramedics (2.62%), 52 psychologists (5.05%) and 14 respiratory therapists (1.36%), from 16 of the 24 provinces of Ecuador. Of these, 27.3% presented symptoms of depression, 39.2% anxiety symptoms, 16.3% insomnia and 43.8% symptoms of PTSD, with the 4 types of symptoms ranging from moderate to severe. The most relevant associated factors were: working in Guayas (the most affected province) (OR = 2.18 for depressive symptoms and OR = 2.59 for PTSD symptoms); being a postgraduate doctor (OR = 1.52 for depressive symptoms and OR = 1.57 for insomnia), perception of not having the proper protective equipment (OR = 1.71 for symptoms of depression and OR = 1.57 for symptoms of anxiety) and being a woman (OR = 1.39 for anxiety). CONCLUSIONS: Healthcare professionals can suffer a significant mental condition that may require psychiatric and psychological intervention. The main associated factors are primarily related to living and working in cities with a higher number of cases and the characteristics of the job, such as being a postgraduate doctor, as well as the perception of security. The main risk factors are primarily related to geographical distribution and job characteristics, such as being a resident physician and self-perception of safety. Further studies are required as the pandemic evolves.","Pazmiño Erazo, Edgar Efraín; Alvear Velásquez, María José; Saltos Chávez, Ivonne Gisselle; Pazmiño Pullas, David Emanuel",,430,14

In particular, cash transfer programmes are currently being adapted or expanded in various low-income and middle-income countries to support individuals and families during the pandemic. We argue that the current crisis offers an opportunity for these programmes to focus on susceptible young people (aged 15-24 years), including those with mental health conditions. Young people living in poverty and with mental health problems are at particular risk of experiencing adverse health, wellbeing, and employment outcomes with long-term consequences. They are also at risk of developing mental health conditions during this pandemic. To support this population, cash transfer programmes should not only address urgent needs around food security and survival but expand their focus to address longer-term mental health impacts of pandemics and economic crises. Such an approach could help support young people's future life chances and break the vicious cycle between mental illness and poverty that spirals many young people into both socioeconomic and mental health disadvantage.","Bauer, Annette; Garman, Emily; McDaid, David; Avendano, Mauricio; Hessel, Philipp; Díaz, Yadira; Araya, Ricardo; Lund, Crick; Malvasi, Paulo; Matijasevich, Alicia; Park, A-La; Paula, Cristiane Silvestre; Ziebold, Carolina; Zimmerman, Annie; Evans-Lacko, Sara",Lancet Psychiatry,430,16

Following the first COVID-19 wave, we estimated the seroprevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) among blood donors across Canada. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: This serial cross-sectional study was conducted between May 9 and July 21, 2020 from blood donors donating at all Canadian Blood Services locations. We used the Abbott Architect assay to detect SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies from retention plasma. Seroprevalence was standardized to population-level demographics and assay characteristics were adjusted using the Rogan-Gladen equation. Results were stratified by region, age, ethnicity, ABO groups, and quantiles of material and social deprivation indices. Temporal trends were evaluated at 2-week intervals. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression compared SARS-CoV-2 reactive to non-reactive donors by sociodemographic variables. RESULTS: Overall 552/74642 donors, had detectable antibodies, adjusted seroprevalence was 7.0/1000 donors (95% CI; 6.3, 7.6). Prevalence was differential by geography, Ontario had the highest rate, 8.8/1000 donors (7.8, 9.8), compared to the Atlantic region 4.5/1000 donors (2.6, 6.4); adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 2.2 (1.5, 3.3). Donors that self-identified as an ethnic minority were more likely than white donors to be sero-reactive aOR 1.5 (1.2, 1.9). No temporal trends were observed. DISCUSSION: Worldwide, blood services have leveraged their operational capacity to inform public health. While >99% of Canadians did not show humoral evidence of past infection, we found regional variability and disparities by ethnicity. Seroprevalence studies will continue to play a pivotal role in evaluating public health policies by identifying trends and monitor disparities.","Saeed, Sahar; Drews, Steven J; Pambrun, Chantale; Yi, Qi-Long; Osmond, Lori; O039,; Brien, Sheila F",Transfusion,430,1

The strong correlation between a high body temperature and SARS-CoV-2 infection has motivated the governments of several countries to restrict access to public indoor places simply based on a person's body temperature. Negating/allowing entrance to a public place can have a strong impact on people. For example, a cancer patient could be refused access to a cancer centre because of an incorrect high temperature measurement. On the other hand, underestimating an individual's body temperature may allow infected patients to enter indoor public places where it is much easier for the virus to spread to other people. Accordingly, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the reliability of body temperature measurements has become fundamental. In particular, a debated issue is the reliability of remote temperature measurements, especially when these are aimed at identifying in a quick and reliable way infected subjects. Working distance, body-device angle, and light conditions and many other metrological and subjective issues significantly affect the data acquired via common contactless infrared point thermometers, making the acquisition of reliable measurements at the entrance to public places a challenging task. The main objective of this work is to sensitize the community to the typical incorrect uses of infrared point thermometers, as well as the resulting drifts in measurements of body temperature. Using several commercial contactless infrared point thermometers, we performed four different experiments to simulate common scenarios in a triage emergency room. In the first experiment, we acquired several measurements for each thermometer without measuring the working distance or angle of inclination to show that, for some instruments, the values obtained can differ by 1 °C. In the second and third experiments, we analysed the impacts of the working distance and angle of inclination of the thermometers, respectively, to prove that only a few cm/degrees can cause drifts higher than 1 °C. Finally, in the fourth experiment, we showed that the light in the environment can also cause changes in temperature up to 0.5 °C. Ultimately, in this study, we quantitatively demonstrated that the working distance, angle of inclination, and light conditions can strongly impact temperature measurements, which could invalidate the screening results.","Piccinini, Filippo; Martinelli, Giovanni; Carbonaro, Antonella",Sensors (Basel),430,1

The goal of our study was to determine whether there was a significant change in overall volume and proportion of emergency department (ED) encounters since SIP measures began. METHODS: This was a retrospective, observational, cross-sectional study using billing data from January 1, 2017-April 20, 2020. We received data from 141 EDs across 16 states, encompassing a convenience sample of 26,223,438 ED encounters. We used a generalized least squares regression approach to ascertain changes for overall ED encounters, hospital admissions, and New York University ED visit algorithm categories. RESULTS: ED encounters decreased significantly in the post-SIP period. Overall, there was a 39.6% decrease in ED encounters compared to expected volume in the pre-SIP period. Emergent encounters decreased by 35.8%, while non-emergent encounters decreased by 52.1%. Psychiatric encounters decreased by 30.2%. Encounters related to drugs and alcohol decreased the least, by 9.3% and 27.5%, respectively. CONCLUSION: There was a significant overall reduction in ED utilization in the post-SIP period. There was a greater reduction in lower acuity encounters than higher acuity encounters. Of all subtypes of ED encounters, substance abuse- and alcohol-related encounters reduced the least, and injury-related encounters reduced the most.","Lucero, Anthony D; Lee, Andre; Hyun, Jenny; Lee, Carol; Kahwaji, Chadi; Miller, Gregg; Neeki, Michael; Tamayo-Sarver, Joshua; Pan, Luhong",West J Emerg Med,430,26

Design/methodology/approach: This paper employed a mixed method involving a cross-disciplinary literature review along with reflections from experts in TCM and health communication to inform tourism management. Specifically, this paper examines TCM and its potential benefits as a medical tourism drawcard to combat COVID-19. The selected literature focusses on the image and merits of TCM to frame how this medical philosophy can be used to position China as a tourist destination. Reflections on the use of TCM as a tourism marketing tool can guide promotional strategies from the Chinese government and destination managers during and after COVID-19. Findings: The Chinese government, the tourism industry (e.g. destination managers), the media and tourists must focus on three aspects of the role of TCM: to provide medical benefits to travellers amid COVID-19 and beyond, elevate China as a destination for global medical tourists and be leveraged as a tool for economic recovery. Practical implications: The paper builds a tourism recovery framework for stakeholders to adopt tailored TCM communication strategies to boost its inbound tourism programme.

The purpose of this study was to compare first year (M1) and second year (M2) medical student perceptions and exam performance between ASYNCH and SYNCH-delivered anatomy content. Materials/Methods University of Ottawa M1 and M2 perceptions were surveyed (with both close- and open-ended items) regarding musculoskeletal (MSK;delivered to M1) and gastrointestinal/reproductive (GI/REPRO;delivered to M2) anatomy content delivery in Fall 2020. In both cohorts, approximately 50% of the sessions were delivered in each of ASYNCH (prerecorded lectures) and SYNCH (real-time Microsoft Teams lectures) formats. Final examinations were also analyzed, comparing items that related to content from ASYNCH and SYNCH formats, with 50% of exam items tied to each approach. For both M1 and M2 cohorts, both ASYNCH- and SYNCH-related examination components featured image-based, multiple choice question (MCQ) items, with similar proportions of structure identification items and clinical application items. Results In M1 (n=101;response rate = 62%) and M2 (n=66;response rate = 40%) groups, the percentage of students indicating a preference for ASYNCH, a preference for SYNCH, or no preference regarding content delivery, was 45%, 38%, and 18%, for M1 students, and 48%, 32%, and 20% for M2 students, respectively. Thematic analysis of open-ended feedback revealed strengths (more engaging formative assessment;being part of a learning community) and limitations (technical issues;time-inefficient;more difficult to review) of SYNCH delivery. Similarly, commentary also revealed strengths (time efficiency;flexibility/control) and limits (less engaging formative assessment) of ASYNCH delivery. Commentary also revealed that many students were fine with either approach. While some students noted their preferred approach was beneficial to their learning, assessment data revealed no statistical differences in class performance between ASYNCH- vs. SYNCH-delivered content, for either M1 (MSK) or M2 (GI/REPRO) anatomy. Conclusion While medical students may have indicated a slight preference for ASYNCH (vs. SYNCH) anatomy learning, medical students were generally satisfied with both approaches. While open-ended commentary revealed strengths and limitations regarding both formats, the perceived notion that either SYNCH or ASYNCH was more beneficial to student learning was not supported by assessment data. Significance/Implication This study provides evidence to suggest that both ASYNCH and SYNCH approaches are appropriate for delivering anatomy content to medical students, given unique strengths attributed to each format, and that both approaches lead to similar performance on knowledge assessments. As such, medical anatomy educators should feel confident in choosing either ASYNCH and/or SYNCH formats when delivering their lectures.","Ramnanan, Christopher Di Lorenzo Gabrielle Dong Selina Pak Victor Visva Samantha",The FASEB Journal,430,16

The prospective study included men 21 years and older recovering from COVID-19 with nasopharyngeal swab negative for SARS-CoV-2 or at least two weeks from the last COVID RT-PCR positivity. After clinical evaluation, freshly ejaculated semen sample by masturbation was collected in a sterile container. Samples were processed for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR. Twenty-one patients were contacted for the study, 11 of which consented to provide a semen sample. The mean age of the cohort was 29.72 ± 4.52 years. None of the patients gave a history of epididymo-orchitis or sexual dysfunction at the time of assessment. None of the semen samples demonstrated SARS-CoV-2 on RT-PCR. Median duration of semen sample collection from the COVID positivity was 44 days (Range 19-59 days).

Reagents that can be used to screen for protease inhibitors and for identifying the replicase products of SARS-CoV-2 are urgently needed. Here we describe a luminescence-based biosensor assay for evaluating small molecule inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro/main protease. We also document that a polyclonal rabbit antiserum developed against SARS-CoV 3CLpro cross reacts with the highly conserved 3CLpro of SARS-CoV-2.

One hundred and eighteen patients with COVID-19 pneumonia diagnosed by RT-PCR were analyzed retrospectively. The correlation between chest CT PII, clinical symptoms and laboratory examinations during the entire hospitalization period was compared. The average age of the patients was 46.0 ± 15 (range: 1-74) years. Of the 118 patients, 62 are male (52.5%) and 56 are female (47.5%). Among them, 116 patients recovered and were discharged, 2 patients died, and the median length of hospital stay was 22 (range: 9-41) days. On admission, 76.3% of the patients presented with fever, and the laboratory studies showed a decrease in lymphocyte (LYM) count and an increase in lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels, C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). Within the studies' chest CTs, the median number of involved lung lobes was 4 (range: 0-5) and the median number of involved lung segments was 9 (range 0-20). The left lower lobe and the right lower lobe were the most likely areas to be involved (89.0% and 83.9%), and 84.7% of the patients had inflammatory changes in both lungs. The main manifestations on chest CT were ground glass opacities (31.4%), ground glass opacities and consolidation (20.3%), ground glass opacities and reticular patterns (32.2%), mixed type (13.6%), and white lungs (1.7%); common accompanying signs included linear opacities (55.9%), air bronchograms (46.6%), thick small vessel shadows (36.4%), and pleural hypertrophy (13.6%). The chest CT at discharge showed complete absorption of lesions in 19 cases (16.1%), but not in the remaining 99 cases. Lesions remained in a median of 3 lung lobes (range: 0-5). Residual lesions remained in a median of 5 lung segments (range: 0-20). The residual lesions mainly presented as ground glass opacities (61.0%), and the main accompanying sign was linear opacities (59.3%). Based on chest CT, the median maximum PII of lungs was 30.0% (range: 0-97.5%), and the median PII after discharge in the patients excluding the two deaths was 12.5% (range: 0-53.0%). PII was significantly negatively correlated with the LYM count and significantly positively correlated with body temperature, LDH, CRP, and ESR. There was no significant correlation between the PII and the white blood cell count, but the grade of PII correlated well with the clinical classification.

However, the heterogeneity of cohorts and the lack of consideration of confounding in the published literature raise potential biases. The aim of this study was to pool all available matched data comparing outcomes of mitral valve repair and replacement in the setting of primary mitral regurgitation. RECENT FINDINGS: We searched Medline, Embase and the Cochrane Library Central Register of Controlled Trials to identify propensity-matched studies or reports with multivariable adjustment comparing repair and replacement in patients with primary mitral regurgitation. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality. DerSimonian and Laird random effects were used to perform the meta-analysis. Eight observational studies were selected including 4599 patients (3064 mitral repairs and 1535 replacements). Mean age ranged from 62 to 69 years, and the mean follow-up duration ranged between 3 and 9 years. Replacement was associated with an increased risk of long-term all-cause mortality compared to repair (HR of 1.68, 95% confidence interval 1.35-2.09, p < 0.001, &#964;2 = 0.03). Surgical era and atrial fibrillation impacted the risk of mortality but not mitral anatomy. Neither repair nor replacement impacted significantly on the risk of re-operation after mitral surgery (HR 1.18, 95% CI 0.85-1.63, p = 0.33, &#964;2 < 0.01). Mitral valve replacement is possibly associated with higher long-term mortality than mitral valve repair in primary mitral regurgitation but often used as a bailout option in more complex anatomy. Despite this observation, both techniques have similar risk of re-operation.","Overtchouk, P; Ben-Ali, W; Prendergast, B; Conradi, L; Hahn, R; Granada, J; Modine, T",Curr Cardiol Rep,430,16

We conducted a large-scale HLA analysis of Israeli individuals who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection by PCR. Overall, 72,912 individuals with known HLA haplotypes were included in the study, of whom 6413 (8.8%) were found to have SARS-CoV-2 by PCR. A total of 20,937 subjects were of Ashkenazi origin (at least 2/4 grandparents). One hundred eighty-one patients (2.8% of the infected) were hospitalized due to the disease. None of the 66 most common HLA loci (within the five HLA subgroups: A, B, C, DQB1, DRB1) was found to be associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection or hospitalization in the general Israeli population. Similarly, no association was detected in the Ashkenazi Jewish subset. Moreover, no association was found between heterozygosity in any of the HLA loci and either infection or hospitalization. We conclude that HLA haplotypes are not a major risk/protecting factor among the Israeli population for SARS-CoV-2 infection or severity. Our results suggest that if any HLA association exists with the disease it is very weak, and of limited effect on the pandemic.","Ben Shachar, Shay; Barda, Noam; Manor, Sigal; Israeli, Sapir; Dagan, Noa; Carmi, Shai; Balicer, Ran; Zisser, Bracha; Louzoun, Yoram",J Clin Immunol,430,13

METHODS: A 40-year-old man with bilateral acute conjunctivitis and no suspicious signs of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) presented to the hospital. A detailed ophthalmic examination was performed. Samples obtained from conjunctival and nasopharyngeal swabs were tested by reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) for detection of SARS-CoV-2 virus. Ocular findings and duration of the presence of viral RNA in the conjunctival specimens were evaluated at follow-up visits. RESULTS: Slit-lamp biomicroscopy revealed bilateral acute follicular conjunctivitis. The RT-PCR assay demonstrated the presence of viral RNA in the nasopharyngeal and conjunctival specimens at the initial visit and at the 4-day follow up. Conjunctivitis findings were decreased after 4 days and recovered completely without any sequelae within10 days. The PCR results of both nasopharyngeal and conjunctiva specimens were negative for the viral RNA at 10 days. CONCLUSIONS: Bilateral conjunctivitis is rare in patients infected with COVID-19.

The impetuous entrance of the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy in March 2020, after the onset and diffusion in China, found the health system widely unfit to face the large amount of infected patients. The matter of this investigation was to evaluate how pandemic fear and guidelines for limiting the diffusion of SARS-CoV-2 virus could have impacted the regular supply of radiotherapy (RT) and the outcome of the treatments. Materials and Methods. From March 9, 2020, to May 29, 2020, a register has been established to record patients that cancelled or postponed the RT appointment. The reasons were as follows: (1) patients whose appointments were postponed by the staff according to national guidelines;(2) patients who asked themselves to postpone the appointment;(3) patients who interrupted the treatment for causes directly or indirectly related to the pandemic;(4) patients who cancelled their care path. Results. A total number of 277 patients started regular RT, and 384 respected their computed tomography (CT) simulation appointment, but 60 of them had alteration of their therapeutic pathway. Among these, 18 cancelled their appointment. 42 patients asked to postpone their procedure. Twenty-seven out of 42 adduced directly or indirectly SARS-CoV-2 infection-related reasons. Conclusions. The COVID-19 pandemic affected the regular RT delivery to oncologic patients, owing to the delay or cancellation of procedures with the likely effect to observe worsening of local disease control and reduced survival rates in the future.

Thus, information on the sero-status of nephrology personnel might be crucial for patient protection; however, limited information exists about the presence of SARS-CoV­2 antibodies in asymptomatic individuals. METHODS: We examined the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV­2 IgG and IgM antibodies among healthcare workers of a tertiary care kidney center during the the first peak phase of the corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) crisis in Austria using an orthogonal test strategy and a total of 12 commercial nucleocapsid protein or spike glycoprotein-based assays as well as Western blotting and a neutralization assay. RESULTS: At baseline 60 of 235 study participants (25.5%, 95% confidence interval, CI 20.4-31.5%) were judged to be borderline positive or positive for IgM or IgG using a high sensitivity/low specificity threshold in one test system. Follow-up analysis after about 2 weeks revealed IgG positivity in 12 (5.1%, 95% CI: 2.9-8.8%) and IgM positivity in 6 (2.6%, 95% CI: 1.1-5.6) in at least one assay. Of the healthcare workers 2.1% (95% CI: 0.8-5.0%) showed IgG nucleocapsid antibodies in at least 2 assays. By contrast, positive controls with proven COVID-19 showed antibody positivity among almost all test systems. Moreover, serum samples obtained from healthcare workers did not show SARS-CoV­2 neutralizing capacity, in contrast to positive controls. CONCLUSION: Using a broad spectrum of antibody tests the present study revealed inconsistent results for SARS-CoV­2 seroprevalence among asymptomatic individuals, while this was not the case among COVID-19 patients.

People were asked to stay at home and were largely unable to do many of the activities that they derived meaning from. Since meaning is often related to mental health, these restrictions were likely to decrease mental health. The current study aimed to examine these effects and additionally benefit individuals' mental health by making their meaning salient. Specifically, the goal of the research was to design an intervention that could counter the potential negative effects of social distancing. We recruited a total of 96 U.S.A. residents (M age = 34.45, 92.7% Female) and assigned them to either the control group or to a meaning salience intervention. That is, participants either focused on the meaning of their daily activities (n = 45) or did not participate in any study-related activities during the week (n = 51). They completed various measures of mental health before and after this experimental period. Results suggested that the control group reported significantly greater anxiety, depression, and stress at the end of the week. In contrast, the experimental group reported less anxiety and trended toward less depression and stress at the end of that same week. In all, results suggest that simply focusing on one's daily activities and the meaning found in them protected people from the otherwise detrimental effects of the restrictions. This provides a promising and simple intervention that may assist both individuals and practitioners aiming to improve mental health, especially in challenging times.","Klussman, Kristine; Nichols, Austin Lee; Langer, Julia",Curr Psychol,430,26

Children are more likely to be asymptomatic or have milder symptoms and less likely to present for healthcare and be tested for SARS-CoV-2. Thus, our current estimates are likely under-representative of the true burden of SARS-CoV-2 in children. Given the potential direct benefit of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine in children and the substantial indirect benefit through community protection, or ""herd immunity,"" we argue that planning and implementation of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines should include children. Furthermore, community protection occurred after widespread implementation of prior childhood vaccines against Streptococcus pneumoniae, rubella, and rotavirus.

However, whether CURB-65 can be applicable to COVID-19 patients for the decision of outpatient treatment is still unknown. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective single-centre study assessing the performance of the CURB-65 to predict the risk of poor outcome, defined as the need for mechanical ventilation and/or death, among patients hospitalized for COVID-19. The association between the CURB-65 and the outcome was assessed by a univariable Cox proportional hazard regression model. RESULTS: A total of 279 patients were hospitalized between March 15th and April 14th, 2020. According to the CURB-65, 171 (61.3%) patients were considered at low risk (CURB-65 01), 66 (23.7%) at intermediate risk (CURB-65=2), and 42 (15.1%) had high risk of 30-day mortality (CURB-65 35). During the study period, 88 (31.5%) patients had a poor outcome. The CURB-65 was strongly associated with a poor outcome (Pfor linear trend <0.001). However, among patients with a CURB-65 of 01, thus considered at low risk, 36/171 (21.1%) had a poor outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that the applicability of CURB-65 to guide the decision of inpatient or outpatient care is scarce, as it does not safely identify patients who could be managed as outpatients.","Nguyen, Yann; Corre, Félix; Honsel, Vasco; Curac, Sonja; Zarrouk, Virginie; Fantin, Bruno; Galy, Adrien",J Infect,430,31

Given the adverse impacts of air pollution, many responses have been taken, including migration to another city. The current study explores the psychological process and demographic predictors of migration intention among urban people in Hanoi, Vietnam - one of the most polluted capital cities in the world. The Bayesian Mindsponge Framework (BMF) was used to construct the model and perform Bayesian analysis on a stratified random sampling dataset of 475 urban people. We found that the migration intention was negatively associated with the individual's satisfaction with air quality. The association was moderated by the perceived availability of a better alternative (or nearby city with better air quality). However, the high migration cost due to geographical distance made the moderation effect of the perceived availability of a better alternative negligible. Moreover, it was also found that male and young people were more likely to migrate, but the brain drain hypothesis was not validated. The results hint that without air pollution mitigation measures, the dislocation of economic forces might occur and hinder sustainable urban development. Therefore, collaborative actions among levels of government, with the semi-conducting principle at heart, are recommended to reduce air pollution.","Vuong, Quan-Hoang; Le, Tam-Tri; Nguyen, Quang-Loc; Nguyen, Quang-Trung; Nguyen, Minh-Hoang",,430,20

But, throughout the world, many citizens don't understand well how these measures are taken and even question the decisions taken by their government. Should the measures be more (or less) restrictive? Are they taken for a too long (or too short) period of time? To provide some quantitative elements of response to these questions, we consider the well-known SEIR model for the Covid-19 epidemic propagation and propose a pragmatic model of the government decision-making operation. Although simple and obviously improvable, the proposed model allows us to study the tradeoff between health and economic aspects in a pragmatic and insightful way. Assuming a given number of phases for the epidemic (namely, 4 in this paper) and a desired tradeoff between health and economic aspects, it is then possible to determine the optimal duration of each phase and the optimal severity level (i.e., the target transmission rate) for each of them. The numerical analysis is performed for the case of France but the adopted approach can be applied to any country. One of the takeaway messages of this analysis is that being able to implement the optimal 4-phase epidemic management strategy in France would have led to 1.05 million of infected people and a GDP loss of 231 billions  instead of 6.88 millions of infected and a loss of 241 billions . This indicates that, seen from the proposed model perspective, the effectively implemented epidemic management strategy is good economically, whereas substantial improvements might have been obtained in terms of health impact. Our analysis indicates that the lockdown/severe phase should have been more severe but shorter, and the adjustment phase occurred earlier. Due to the natural tendency of people to deviate from the official rules, updating measures every month over the whole epidemic episode seems to be more appropriate.","Lasaulce, Samson; Zhang, Chao; Varma, Vineeth; Morarescu, Irinel Constantin",Front Public Health,430,16

Here, we summarize and discuss current studies regarding COVID-19 and anti-cancer treatment with an emphasis on ICI. Importantly, several lines of evidence suggest that patients currently treated with ICI do not display an increased vulnerability to infection with SARS-CoV-2. Data regarding morbidity and mortality associated with COVID-19 in cancer patients receiving ICI are less clear and often conflicting. Although mostly based on experimental data, it is possible that ICI can promote the exacerbated immune response associated with adverse outcome in COVID-19 patients. On the other hand, mounting evidence suggests that ICI might even be useful in the treatment of viral infections by preventing or ameliorating T cell exhaustion. In this context, the right timing of treatment might be essential. Nevertheless, some cancer patients treated with ICI experience autoimmune-related side effects that require the use of immunosuppressive therapies, which in turn may promote a severe course of infection with SARS-CoV-2. Although there is clear evidence that withholding ICI will have more serious consequences, further studies are urgently needed in to better evaluate the effects of ICI in patients with COVID-19 and the use of ICI during the corona pandemic in general.","Gambichler, Thilo; Reuther, Judith; Scheel, Christina H; Susok, Laura; Kern, Peter; Becker, Jürgen C",,430,9

A multiplexed peptide-MHC tetramer approach was used to screen 408 SARS-CoV-2 candidate epitopes for CD8+ T cell recognition in a cross-sectional sample of 30 coronavirus disease 2019 convalescent individuals. T cells were evaluated using a 28-marker phenotypic panel, and findings were modelled against time from diagnosis and from humoral and inflammatory responses. There were 132 SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cell responses detected across 6 different HLAs, corresponding to 52 unique epitope reactivities. CD8+ T cell responses were detected in almost all convalescent individuals and were directed against several structural and nonstructural target epitopes from the entire SARS-CoV-2 proteome. A unique phenotype for SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells was observed that was distinct from other common virus-specific T cells detected in the same cross-sectional sample and characterized by early differentiation kinetics. Modelling demonstrated a coordinated and dynamic immune response characterized by a decrease in inflammation, increase in neutralizing antibody titer, and differentiation of a specific CD8+ T cell response. Overall, T cells exhibited distinct differentiation into stem cell and transitional memory states (subsets), which may be key to developing durable protection.","Kared, Hassen; Redd, Andrew D; Bloch, Evan M; Bonny, Tania S; Sumatoh, Hermi; Kairi, Faris; Carbajo, Daniel; Abel, Brian; Newell, Evan W; Bettinotti, Maria P; Benner, Sarah E; Patel, Eshan U; Littlefield, Kirsten; Laeyendecker, Oliver; Shoham, Shmuel; Sullivan, David; Casadevall, Arturo; Pekosz, Andrew; Nardin, Alessandra; Fehlings, Michael; Tobian, Aaron Ar; Quinn, Thomas C",J. clin. invest,430,16

This paper reviews alternative interdisciplinary curriculum models that break down artificial barriers between subject disciplines through the use of 'Rich Tasks', interdisciplinary tasks which integrate subject knowledge with developing student skills in the 4C's collaboration, critical thinking, communication, and creativity. The paper suggests that 'Rich Tasks' provide a futureproof methodology as they focus learning on the global, emotionally resilient skills that children need to adapt to a changing digital world where they may change jobs many times. Historic and current interdisciplinary learning models are explored. Interviews with key practitioners and learners who were and are involved in these were conducted. Significantly positive responses to interdisciplinary learning from both groups of respondents are found. A development of the form of learning called 'Rich Tasks' (See Moulds 2004 for definitions) can be constructed through the enhanced knowledge and utilisation of digital technology which teachers have gained worldwide in order to continue teaching during the pandemic.","Harris, C.",Pixel-Bit- Revista De Medios Y Educacion,430,16

Neurological manifestations may be due to direct viral effect on neurons and glial cells, to an immune-mediated response to the virus, or to a hypercoagulable state and associated endothelial damage, as well as to severe systemic disease with prolonged intensive care unit stay. OBJECTIVE: To describe two patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection and delayed recovery of consciousness after sedation withdrawal, in whom MRI disclosed multifocal white matter brain lesions, compatible with the diagnosis of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis. METHODS: Observational report of two cases of severe COVID-19 infection in patients from two tertiary hospitals in São Paulo, Brazil. RESULTS: These patients underwent neurologic and systemic evaluation for delayed awakening after sedation withdrawal. MRI displayed multifocal centrum semiovale lesions, suggestive of demyelinating inflammation. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for SARS-CoV-2 was negative in both cases. CONCLUSION: A recurrent pattern of multifocal white matter lesions can occur in COVID-19 patients, possibly associated with delayed awakening.

These measures affect individuals, communities, cities, countries, and the entire planet. In this paper, we propose that the tremendous consequences of the corona crisis invite environmental psychology to focus more strongly on research questions that address major societal challenges from a collective psychology perspective. In particular, we stress that the corona crisis may affect how people appraise – and potentially respond to – the looming climate crisis. By consistently pointing out systemic links and their human factor, environmental psychology can become central to a scientific agenda of a sustainable ‘post-corona society’. In order to provide a framework for future research towards a sustainable societal transformation, we build on the Social Identity Model of Pro-Environmental Action (SIMPEA) and extend its scope to understand people's responses following the corona crisis. The model allows predictions of previously not explicitly included concepts of place attachment, nature connectedness, basic psychological needs, and systems thinking. It may serve as a guiding framework for a better understanding of the transformation towards a sustainable future.","Reese, Gerhard; Hamann, Karen R.S.; Heidbreder, Lea M.; Loy, Laura S.; Menzel, Claudia; Neubert, Sebastian; Tröger, Josephine; Wullenkord, Marlis C.",J.

Before critical care becomes a necessity, identifying patients who are likely to become critically ill and providing prompt treatment is a strategy to avoid ICU oversaturation. There is a consensus that a hyperinflammatory syndrome or a ""cytokine storm"" is responsible for poor outcomes in COVID-19. Measuring cytokine levels at the point of care is required in order to better understand this process. In this Perspective, we summarize the main events behind the cytokine storm in COVID-19 as well as current experimental treatments. We advocate for a new biosensor-enabled paradigm to personalize the management of COVID-19 and stratify patients. Biosensor-guided dosing and timing of immunomodulatory therapies could maximize the benefits of these anti-inflammatory treatments while minimizing deleterious effects. Biosensors will also be essential in order to detect complications such as coinfections and sepsis, which are common in immunosuppressed patients. Finally, we propose the ideal features of these biosensors using some prototypes from the recent literature as examples. Multisensors, lateral flow tests, mobile biosensors, and wearable biosensors are seen as key players for precision medicine in COVID-19.","Russell, Steven M; Alba-Patiño, Alejandra; Barón, Enrique; Borges, Marcio; Gonzalez-Freire, Marta; de la Rica, Roberto",ACS Sens,430,16
348488,348488,348488,Why are COVID-19 vaccines still in short supply?,14.932037,4.8348775,2021,"COVID-19, also known as SARS-CoV-2, is a new emerging zoonotic corona virus of the SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) and the MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome) family. COVID-19 originated in China and spread world-wide, resulting in the pandemic of 2020. For some reason, COVID-19 shows a considerably higher mortality rate in patients with advanced chronological age. This begs the question as to whether there is a functional association between COVID-19 infection and the process of chronological aging. Two host receptors have been proposed for COVID-19. One is CD26 and the other is ACE-2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2). Interestingly, both CD26 and the angiotensin system show associations with senescence. Similarly, two proposed therapeutics for the treatment of COVID-19 infection are Azithromycin and Quercetin, both drugs with significant senolytic activity. Also, Chloroquine-related compounds inhibit the induction of the well-known senescence marker, Beta-galactosidase. Other anti-aging drugs should also be considered, such as Rapamycin and Doxycycline, as they behave as inhibitors of protein synthesis, blocking both SASP and viral replication. Therefore, we wish to speculate that the fight against COVID-19 disease should involve testing the hypothesis that senolytics and other anti-aging drugs may have a prominent role in preventing the transmission of the virus, as well as aid in its treatment. Thus, we propose that new clinical trials may be warranted, as several senolytic and anti-aging therapeutics are existing FDA-approved drugs, with excellent safety profiles, and would be readily available for drug repurposing efforts. As Azithromycin and Doxycycline are both commonly used antibiotics that inhibit viral replication and IL-6 production, we may want to consider this general class of antibiotics that functionally inhibits cellular protein synthesis as a side-effect, for the treatment and prevention of COVID-19 disease.","Sargiacomo, Camillo; Sotgia, Federica; Lisanti, Michael P",Aging (Albany NY),430,16

PURPOSE: In the absence of a vaccine, public health messaging to mitigate risks for COVID-19 primarily focuses on social distancing. Because people living with HIV commonly experience mistreatment associated with HIV, their response to social distancing may be complicated by psychosocial attitudes associated with COVID-19. METHODS: To evaluate these relationships, we conducted a rapid-response, cross-sectional survey with people living with HIV (N = 149) to assess social distancing practices, COVID-19 discriminatory attitudes, COVID-19 xenophobic attitudes, HIV microaggressions, and concern over contracting COVID-19. Data were collected from participants enrolled in a larger ongoing study between March 30, 2020 and April 17, 2020. RESULTS: Results indicated that choosing to socially distance to reduce COVID-19 exposure was associated with COVID-19 discriminatory attitudes, concerns of contracting COVID-19, and identifying as transgender. Likewise, social distancing imposed by others (e.g., cancelations and restrictions) was associated with concerns of contracting COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Findings demonstrate that social distancing measures are related to concerns of contracting the virus and discriminatory attitudes toward those who are presumed to be living with COVID-19. These potentially negative psychosocial attitudes toward people perceived to have COVID-19 echo the discriminatory actions and attitudes that we continue to observe in HIV social sciences research.","Berman, Marcie; Eaton, Lisa A; Watson, Ryan J; Andrepont, J L; Kalichman, Seth",Ann Behav Med,430,16

Group differences in COVID-19 impact on families were also examined based on race and ethnicity, being medically and/or geographically underserved, and insurance status. METHODS: Participants (nâ¯=â¯131) included children with epilepsy and their families from two clinical trials. The Impact of COVID-19 on Pediatric Epilepsy Management (ICPEM) measure was developed and administered to caregivers online from April 2020 to September 2020 across four large pediatric hospitals. Administration of the ICPEM occurred both during routine study assessments and an additional acute time point to obtain information early in the pandemic (e.g., April and May 2020). Descriptive statistics and t-tests were used for analyses. RESULTS: Data indicate minor to moderate impact of COVID-19 on pediatric epilepsy management. Caregivers of children with epilepsy reported the most impact on education and social functioning. Adherence to CDC guidelines was reported to be high. Those having public insurance reported greater difficulties obtaining daily anti-seizure medications compared to those with private insurance. CONCLUSIONS: This study presents important initial data regarding the impact of COVID-19 epilepsy management and daily functioning in children with epilepsy and their families. While the acute impact of COVID-19 restrictions appear to be mild to moderate, it is unclear what the long-term impact of the pandemic will be on families of children with epilepsy.","Modi, Avani C; Patel, Anup D; Stevens, Jack; Smith, Gigi; Huszti, Heather; Guilfoyle, Shanna M; Mara, Constance A; Schmidt, Matthew; Wagner, Janelle L",Epilepsy Behav,430,24

The use of Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) has been recognised as a management option for severe COVID-19 (NHS, Specialty guides for patient management during the coronavirus pandemic Guidance for the role and use of non-invasive respiratory support in adult patients with coronavirus (confirmed or suspected), https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng159 ). We offered ward-based CPAP to COVID-19, dialysis patients not suitable for escalation to ICU. The aim of the study was to evaluate the use of CPAP for COVID-19 dialysis patients compared to non-dialysis COVID-19 patients outside of the intensive care setting. We further aimed to investigate factors associated with improved outcomes. METHODS: Data was collected from a single centre (Royal Preston Hospital, UK), from March to June 2020. Treatment outcomes were compared for dialysis and non-dialysis dependent patients who received CPAP with limitations on their escalation and resuscitation status. Kaplan-Meier survival curves and Cox regression models were used to compare outcomes. The primary study outcome was 30 day mortality. Confounders including length of admission, systemic anticoagulation and ultrafiltration volumes on dialysis were also analysed. RESULTS: Over the study period, 40 dialysis patients tested positive for COVID-19, with 30 requiring hospital admission. 93% (n = 28) required supplementary oxygen and 12% (n = 9) required CPAP on the ward. These patients were compared to a serial selection of 14 non-dialysis patients treated with CPAP during the same period. Results showed a significant difference in 30 day survival rates between the two groups: 88.9% in the dialysis group vs. 21.4% in the non-dialysis group. Statistical modelling showed that anticoagulation was also an important factor and correlated with better outcomes. CONCLUSION: This is to the best of our knowledge, the largest series of COVID-19 dialysis patients treated with CPAP in a ward-based setting. In general, dialysis dependent patients have multiple co-morbidities including cardiovascular disease and diabetes mellitus making them vulnerable to COVID-19 and not always suitable for treatment in ICU. We showed a significantly lower 30 day mortality rate with the use of CPAP in the dialysis group (11.1%) compared to the non-dialysis group (78.6%). Despite a small sample size, we believe this study provides impetus for further work clarifying the role of CPAP in treating COVID-19 dialysis dependent patients.","Floyd, Lauren; Stauss, Madelena; Storrar, Joshua; Vanalia, Parthvi; France, Anna; Dhaygude, Ajay",BMC Nephrol,430,20

The aim of this study was to report the epidemiologic characteristics of surgically-treated fractures during the COVID-19 outbreak over a six-month period, and to describe the variation in volumes and types of injuries, by comparing them with fractures which occurred during the same period in 2019. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed all surgically-treated fractures which were admitted from the January 1st 2020 to June 30th 2020, and compared these data to those of the corresponding timeframe in 2019. The collected data of interest included demographics, such as age and gender, fracture location, time lapse between presentation at Emergency Department and admission in the ward, length of stay. RESULTS: A total of 117 patients were admitted with a diagnosis of facture and surgically treated, with no cases of COVID-19 positive patients. In the corresponding period of 2019, the number of patients admitted for the same reasons was 129. This decrease was more significant in the period between March and April (-30.6%), during which time prevention measures were more stringent. The only statistically significant discrepancy between the two study groups was the mean age, which was significantly higher in 2020. The location of examined injuries were similar in the two study groups, with proximal femur fractures representing the most frequent injuries. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated significant changes of epidemiologic patterns of fractures during COVID-19 outbreak. These data should provide support for clinicians and government to evaluate the management and prevention strategies of traumatic not only during outbreak but also in non-outbreak period.","Costa, Giuseppe Gianluca; Fanzone, Giuseppe; Graceffa, Angelo; Lauria, Michele; Zocco, Gianluca; Cassarà, Antonino; Campailla, Alberto; Saccà, Alessia; Santanna, Enrico; Caputo, Gianclaudio; Russo, Arcangelo",Acta Biomed,430,26

We aimed to compare the innate immunity transcriptome signature between COVID-19 and KD, and to analyze the interactions of these molecules with genes known to predispose to KD. METHODS: Transcriptome datasets of COVID-19 and KD cohorts (E-MTAB-9357, GSE-63881, GSE-68004) were downloaded from ArrayExpress for innate immune response analyses. Network analysis was used to determine enriched pathways of interactions. RESULTS: Upregulations of IRAK4, IFI16, STING, STAT3, PYCARD, CASP1, IFNAR1 and CD14 genes were observed in blood cells of acute SARS-CoV-2 infections with moderate severity. In the same patient group, increased expressions of TLR2, TLR7, IRF3, and CD36 were also noted in blood drawn a few days after COVID-19 diagnosis. Elevated blood PYCARD level was associated with severe COVID-19 in adults. Similar gene expression signature except differences in TLR8, NLRP3, STING and IRF3 levels was detected in KD samples. Network analysis on innate immune genes and genes associated with KD susceptibility identified enriched pathways of interactions. Furthermore, higher expression levels of KD susceptibility genes HLA-DOB, PELI1 and FCGR2A correlated with COVID-19 of different severities. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that most enriched innate immune response pathways were shared between transcriptomes of KD and COVID-19 with moderate severity. Genetic polymorphisms associated with innate immune dysregulation and KD susceptibility, together with variants in STING and STAT3, might predict COVID-19 severity and potentially susceptibility to COVID-19 related MIS-C.","Yang, Chin-An; Huang, Ya-Ling; Chiang, Bor-Luen",J.

Resilience and psychopathological symptoms of nurses in the isolation ward was assessed by Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC) and the Symptom Checklist 90 (SCL-90). A total resilience score was 87.04 ± 22.78. The SCL-90 score was 160- to 281 (202.5 ± 40.79). Only 8.70% of the nurses (n = 8) had a total SCL-90 score >160, suggesting positive symptoms. The majority of nurses had 0 to 90 positive self-assessment items (median 14); 19.57% (n = 18) had > 43 positive items. Interpersonal sensitivity, depression, hostility, and paranoid ideation scores were below national averages (p=0.000, 0.040, 0.002, 0.004, respectively). SCL-90 items reflecting diet and sleep conditions were higher(P = 0.009), and somatization, obsessive-compulsive, anxiety, phobic anxiety, and psychoticism domains and scores were similar to national averages (P>0.3). With exception of somatization and other domains, the mean resilience score was negatively associated with the scores of other SCL-90 domains. High resilience promotes physical and mental health, and may be improved by training, psychological interventions and full use of hospital resources.","Ou, Xiuli; Chen, Yantang; Liang, Zhonghuan; Wen, Shaoxia; Li, Shuzhen; Chen, Yuzhen",Psychol Health Med,430,1

To date, no data have ever been reported to reflect the prevalence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) among these outpatients. Moreover, it is almost unknown to discriminate COVID-19 and nucleic acid negative patients based on clinical features in the fever clinics. METHODS: The infectious status of SARS-CoV-2 was estimated among the outpatients. The epidemiological and clinical characteristics were compared between COVID-19 and nucleic acid negative patients. RESULTS: The nucleic acid positive rate for SARS-CoV-2 in the outpatients from our fever clinic was 67·1%, while the majority of patients with COVID-19 were mild cases. The predominant initial symptom in those patients with COVID-19 was fever (78.2%), followed by cough (15.6%). Very significantly lower number of eosinophils was characterized in patients with COVID-19 as compared with that of nucleic acid negative patients. More importantly, the proportion of subjects with eosinophil counts lower than normal levels in patients with COVID-19 was much higher than that of nucleic acid negative patients. Fever combined with bilateral ground-glass opacities in computed tomography imaging and eosinophil count below the normal level are probably a valuable indicator of COVID-19 infection in those outpatients. CONCLUSIONS: Those findings may provide critical information for the regions, such as Europe and United States that are facing the same situation as Wuhan experienced, and could be valuable to prevent those nucleic acid negative patients from misdiagnosis before antibody testing.","Wei, Yanqiu; Lu, Yanjun; Xia, Liming; Yuan, Xianglin; Li, Gang; Li, Xinying; Liu, Li; Liu, Wenhua; Zhou, Peng; Wang, Cong-Yi; Zhang, Huilan",J. med. virol,430,20

Since its emergence in December 2019, the virus has infected millions of people, caused the deaths of hundreds of thousands, and resulted in incalculable social and economic damage. Understanding the infectivity and transmission dynamics of the virus is essential to determine how best to reduce mortality while ensuring minimal social restrictions on the lives of the general population. Anecdotal evidence is available, but detailed studies have not yet revealed whether infection with the virus results in immunity. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to use mathematical modeling to investigate the reinfection frequency of COVID-19. METHODS: We have used the SIR (Susceptible, Infected, Recovered) framework and random processing based on empirical SARS-CoV-2 infection and fatality data from different regions to calculate the number of reinfections that would be expected to occur if no immunity to the disease occurred. RESULTS: Our model predicts that cases of reinfection should have been observed by now if primary SARS-CoV-2 infection did not protect individuals from subsequent exposure in the short term; however, no such cases have been documented. CONCLUSIONS: This work concludes that infection with SARS-CoV-2 provides short-term immunity to reinfection and therefore offers useful insight for serological testing strategies, lockdown easing, and vaccine development.","McMahon, Andrew; Robb, Nicole C",JMIR Public Health Surveill,430,12

The cardiovascular and renal benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors are likely largely independent of their glycaemic effects, and this understanding is central to the use of these agents in the high-risk population of people with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease. There are a number of potential safety issues associated with the use of SGLT2 inhibitors. These include the rare but serious risks of diabetic ketoacidosis and necrotising fasciitis of the perineum. The data regarding a possibly increased risk of lower limb amputation and fracture with SGLT2 inhibitor therapy are conflicting. This article aims to explore the potential safety issues associated with the use of SGLT2 inhibitors, with a particular focus on the safety of these drugs in people with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease. We discuss strategies that clinicians can implement to minimise the risk of adverse effects including diabetic ketoacidosis and volume depletion. Risk mitigation strategies with respect to SGLT2 inhibitor-associated diabetic ketoacidosis are of particular importance during the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.","Milder, Tamara Y; Stocker, Sophie L; Day, Richard O; Greenfield, Jerry R",Drug Saf,430,29

Desperate times have called for desperate measures to detect the disease at an early stage via various medically proven methods like chest computed tomography (CT) scan, chest X-Ray, etc., in order to prevent the virus from spreading across the community. Developing deep learning models for analysing these kinds of radiological images is a well-known methodology in the domain of computer based medical image analysis. However, doing the same by mimicking the biological models and leveraging the newly developed neuromorphic computing chips might be more economical. These chips have been shown to be more powerful and are more efficient than conventional central and graphics processing units. Additionally, these chips facilitate the implementation of spiking neural networks (SNNs) in real-world scenarios. To this end, in this work, we have tried to simulate the SNNs using various deep learning libraries. We have applied them for the classification of chest CT scan images into COVID and non-COVID classes. Our approach has achieved very high F1 score of 0.99 for the potential-based model and outperforms many state-of-the-art models.

It also regulates immunological functions, acting on the cells of innate and adaptive immune systems. Magnesium deficiency primes phagocytes, enhances granulocyte oxidative burst, activates endothelial cells and increases the levels of cytokines, thus promoting inflammation. Consequently, a low magnesium status, which is often underdiagnosed, potentiates the reactivity to various immune challenges and is implicated in the pathophysiology of many common chronic diseases. Here we summarize recent advances supporting the link between magnesium deficiency, inflammatory responses and diseases, and offer new hints towards a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms.","Maier, Jeanette A; Castiglioni, Sara; Locatelli, Laura; Zocchi, Monica; Mazur, André",Semin. cell dev. biol,430,24

Therefore, non-toxic antiviral nanoparticles (NPs) have been under development for clinical application to prevent and treat COVID-19. NPs showed great promise to provide nano vaccines against viral infections. Here, we discuss the potentials of NPs that may be applied as a drug itself or as a platform for the aim of drug and vaccine repurposing and development. Meanwhile, the advanced strategies based on NPs to detect viruses will be described with the goal of encouraging scientists to design effective and cost-benefit nanoplatforms for prevention, diagnosis, and treatment.","Tavakol, Shima; Zahmatkeshan, Masoumeh; Mohammadinejad, Mohammad R; Mehrzadi, Saeed; Joghataei, Mohammad T; Alavijeh, Mo S; Seifalian, Alexander",Heliyon,430,16

Due to the lack of typical clinical manifestations, the disease is often missed or mistaken for another condition. The clinical signs and symptoms depend on the speed and volume of embolized gas entering the blood and the patient's condition. In particular, patent foramen ovale has been found to be associated, in rare cases, with the intraoperative entry of gas into the arterial system. PATIENT CONCERNS: In this report, we present the case of a 35-year-old woman with kidney cancer who underwent laparoscopic right partial nephrectomy. DIAGNOSIS: After the laparoscopic surgery, the patient was initially diagnosed with acute cerebral infarction. INTERVENTIONS: The patient was treated according to the standard method for treatment of acute cerebrovascular disease. OUTCOMES: Three days after the laparoscopic procedure, the patient gained consciousness, and she was discharged without any neurologic sequelae on postoperative day 12. LESSONS SUBSECTIONS AS PER STYLE: Due to the low incidence and sudden occurrence of CCDE, there is a strong likelihood of missed diagnosis or misdiagnosis, and it is; therefore, important to be aware of the risk. The findings from this report would be highly useful as a reference to clinicians in the future.","Li, Yuan; Zhang, Enlong; Yuan, Huishu",Medicine (Baltimore),430,2

Understanding the incidence of secondary pulmonary infections and the associated bacterial and fungal microorganisms identified can improve patient outcomes. OBJECTIVE: This narrative review aims to determine the incidence of secondary bacterial and fungal pulmonary infections in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, and describe the bacterial and fungal microorganisms identified. METHOD: We perform a literature search and select articles with confirmed diagnoses of secondary bacterial and fungal pulmonary infections that occur 48 h after admission, using respiratory tract cultures in hospitalized adult COVID-19 patients. We exclude articles involving co-infections defined as infections diagnosed at the time of admission by non-SARS-CoV-2 viruses, bacteria, and fungal microorganisms. RESULTS: The incidence of secondary pulmonary infections is low at 16% (4.8-42.8%) for bacterial infections and lower for fungal infections at 6.3% (0.9-33.3%) in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Secondary pulmonary infections are predominantly seen in critically ill hospitalized COVID-19 patients. The most common bacterial microorganisms identified in the respiratory tract cultures are Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella species, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. Aspergillus fumigatus is the most common microorganism identified to cause secondary fungal pulmonary infections. Other rare opportunistic infection reported such as PJP is mostly confined to small case series and case reports. The overall time to diagnose secondary bacterial and fungal pulmonary infections is 10 days (2-21 days) from initial hospitalization and 9 days (4-18 days) after ICU admission. The use of antibiotics is high at 60-100% involving the studies included in our review. CONCLUSION: The widespread use of empirical antibiotics during the current pandemic may contribute to the development of multidrug-resistant microorganisms, and antimicrobial stewardship programs are required for minimizing and de-escalating antibiotics. Due to the variation in definition across most studies, a large, well-designed study is required to determine the incidence, risk factors, and outcomes of secondary pulmonary infections in hospitalized COVID-19 patients.","Chong, Woon H; Saha, Biplab K; Chopra, Amit",Infection,430,16

Thus, new therapeutic strategies and effective vaccines are urgently needed to cope with this severe pandemic. The development of a broadly neutralizing antibody against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is one of the attractive treatment strategies for COVID-19. Currently, the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike (S) protein is the main target of neutralizing antibodies when SARS-CoV-2 enters human cells through an interaction between the S protein and the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 expressed on various human cells. A single monoclonal antibody (mAb) treatment is prone to selective pressure due to increased possibility of targeted epitope mutation, leading to viral escape. In addition, the antibody-dependent enhancement effect is a potential risk of enhancing the viral infection. These risks can be reduced using multiple mAbs that target nonoverlapping epitopes. Thus, a cocktail therapy combining two or more antibodies that recognize different regions of the viral surface may be the most effective therapeutic strategy.","Lai, Rongtao; Zhou, Tianhui; Xiang, Xiaogang; Lu, Jie; Xin, Haiguang; Xie, Qing",Front.

In this process protoporphyrin (PpIX) is released. METHODS: The decrease in the hemoglobin levels observed in patients with Covid-19 is frequently accompanied by an increase in PpIX levels. This evidence was confirmed by the quantification of PpIX by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). PpIX emission is observed in its two characteristic bands at approximately 635 nm and 705 nm. RESULTS: This paper searches to understand the role of heme and PpIX inside the cells. Perspectives on the use of PpIX fluorescence as a sensor to monitor the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the tissue, blood, urine, or feces to map the evolution and severity of the disease or to monitor the response of the Covid-19 treatment modalities were described. CONCLUSION: Fluorescence spectroscopy could be adopted as an excellent diagnostic technique for Covid-19, of low cost and high sensitivity. This method can potentially be used as a marker to monitor the response to the treatments. Photodynamic and sonodynamic therapies using the endogenous PpIX increased in the acute phase of the disease, could be employed for Covid-19 treatment.","Courrol, Lilia Coronato; de Oliveira Silva, Flávia Rodrigues; Masilamani, Valdivel",Photodiagnosis Photodyn Ther,430,30

OBJECTIVE: To provide a contemporary picture of the risks from delayed treatment for urologic cancers to assist with triage. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: A collaborative review using literature published as of April 2, 2020. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Patients with low-grade non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer are unlikely to suffer from a 3-6-month delay. Patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer are at risk of disease progression, with radical cystectomy delays beyond 12 wk from diagnosis or completion of neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Prioritization of these patients for surgery or management with radiochemotherapy is encouraged. Active surveillance should be used for low-risk prostate cancer (PCa). Treatment of most patients with intermediate- and high-risk PCa can be deferred 3-6 mo without change in outcomes. The same may be true for cancers with the highest risk of progression. With radiotherapy, neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is the standard of care. For surgery, although the added value of neoadjuvant ADT is questionable, it may be considered if a patient is interested in such an approach. Intervention may be safely deferred for T1/T2 renal masses, while locally advanced renal tumors (&#8805;T3) should be treated expeditiously. Patients with metastatic renal cancer may consider vascular endothelial growth factor targeted therapy over immunotherapy. Risks for delay in the treatment of upper tract urothelial cancer depend on grade and stage. For patients with high-grade disease, delays of 12 wk in nephroureterectomy are not associated with adverse survival outcomes. Expert guidance recommends expedient local treatment of testis cancer. In penile cancer, adverse outcomes have been observed with delays of &#8805;3 mo before inguinal lymphadenectomy. Limitations include a paucity of data and methodologic variations for many cancers. CONCLUSIONS: Patients and clinicians should consider the oncologic risk of delayed cancer intervention versus the risks of COVID-19 to the patient, treating health care professionals, and the health care system. PATIENT SUMMARY: The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has led to delays in the treatment of patients with urologic malignancies. Based on a review of the literature, patients with high-grade urothelial carcinoma, advanced kidney cancer, testicular cancer, and penile cancer should be prioritized for treatment during these challenging times.","Wallis, Christopher J D; Novara, Giacomo; Marandino, Laura; Bex, Axel; Kamat, Ashish M; Karnes, R Jeffrey; Morgan, Todd M; Mottet, Nicolas; Gillessen, Silke; Bossi, Alberto; Roupret, Morgan; Powles, Thomas; Necchi, Andrea; Catto, James W F; Klaassen, Zachary",Eur Urol,430,20

COVID-19 impacted countries worldwide and generated a global crisis resulting in impacts on daily life, however, it's effect on IFCSA is unknown. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to compare professional perspectives and experiences working with IFCSA with respect to the context of the COVID-19 pandemic within the United States and Israel. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: Participants were therapeutic, child welfare and legal professionals, who provided services to children involved in IFCSA. METHODS: This qualitative cross-cultural comparative study analyzes professional experiences of IFCSA during COVID-19 based on an open-ended questionnaire answered online, with 37 responses from the US and 23 responses from Israel. RESULTS: Findings reveal mostly negative changes in the dynamics of IFCSA families during COVID-19, including financial, environmental, and emotional hardships, as well as some positive changes in the relationships among family members. In terms of professional interventions, concerns were raised that COVID-19 has been detrimental to the disclosure of IFCSA, with plummeting child abuse reports. Further, risk and benefits of transferring to internet based or telephonic therapeutic interventions were shared. CONCLUSIONS: Governmental and community efforts are needed to develop a safety net of protective factors to reduce IFCSA risks and increase resiliency during the COVID-19 pandemic and future global crises. Moreover, enhanced strategies to accessing and supporting families remotely such as using technology could improve identification and response to IFCSA.","Tener, Dafna; Marmor, Amitai; Katz, Carmit; Newman, Abbie; Silovsky, Jane F; Shields, Jennifer; Taylor, Erin",Child Abuse Negl,430,33

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this cross-sectional study was to examine the content and characteristics of TikTok videos that are related to an important aspect of community mitigation-the use of masks as a method for interrupting the transmission of SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: In total, 100 trending videos with the hashtag #WearAMask (ie, a campaign on TikTok), along with 32 videos that were posted by the World Health Organization (WHO) and involved masks in any way (ie, all related WHO videos at the time of this study), were included in our sample. We collected the metadata of each post, and created content categories based on fact sheets that were provided by the WHO and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. We used these fact sheets to code the characteristics of mask use. RESULTS: Videos that were posted on TikTok and had the hashtag #WearAMask garnered almost 500 million views, and videos that were posted by the WHO garnered almost 57 million views. Although the ratio of the number of trending #WearAMask videos to the number of WHO videos was around 3:1, the #WearAMask videos received almost 10 times as many cumulative views as the WHO videos. In total, 68% (68/100) of the trending #WearAMask videos involved humor and garnered over 355 million cumulative views. However, only 9% (3/32) of the WHO videos involved humor. Furthermore, 27% (27/100) of the trending #WearAMask videos involved dance and garnered over 130 million cumulative views, whereas none of the WHO videos involved dance. CONCLUSIONS: This study is one of the first to describe how TikTok is being used to mitigate the community spread of COVID-19 by promoting mask use. Due to the platform's incredible reach, TikTok has great potential in conveying important public health messages to various segments of the population.","Basch, Corey H; Fera, Joseph; Pierce, Isabela; Basch, Charles E",JMIR Public Health Surveill,430,24

Almost overnight, Italian behavior analysts were faced with the challenge of setting up remotely whole-family systems aimed at maintaining adaptive skills and low levels of challenging behavior to be carried out solely by caregivers. Given these extraordinary circumstances, the protocols available from the applied behavior-analytic, parent training, and autism literature did not appear to fully meet the needs of parents having to be with their children under extreme levels of stress in a confined space with limited reinforcers for 24 hr a day, 7 days a week. To meet this unprecedented challenge, we developed a dynamic and holistic protocol that extended to the full day and that recognized the need for sustainable intervention delivered solely by parents, who were often looking after more than one child. These practices are presented in this article, together with a discussion of lessons we have learned thus far, which may be useful for behavior analysts working in other regions in which the effects of the pandemic are not yet fully realized. Although somewhat unorthodox, we include some parent comments at the end with the goal of sharing the parent perspective in real time as this pandemic unfolds across the world.","Degli Espinosa, Francesca; Metko, Alma; Raimondi, Marta; Impenna, Michele; Scognamiglio, Elena",Behav Anal Pract,430,1

Even after lockdown, the pandemic fear created additional barriers to access the health services. The aim of our study is to evaluate the economic impact of the lockdown for COVID-19 on public health in Italy, focusing on its effects on diabetic population. Materials and Methods: We analyzed the impact of the lockdown on excess mortality and morbidity in the Italian diabetic population during 2020. The analysis was divided into several steps: a quantification of specialist visit reduction, the calculation of excess mortality in the diabetic population, the economic evaluation of the slowdown in the use of innovative diabetic therapies. Furthermore, the impact of the lockdown on the reduction of procedures and follow-up visits in diabetic population was evaluated. The overall impact of the pandemic and lockdown effects on costs and quality of life was then calculated. Results: During 2020, a drop of 28% in patient access has been observed. Diabetic patients recorded a twice higher mortality value compared to general population (20.4% vs 10.2%). The analysis of market data revealed a slowdown in consumption of new antidiabetic therapies (-14%, 27% vs 41%). We estimated an expense of 26.6 million for NHS and a loss of 257 utilities in diabetic population due to the missed benefits related to slowdown in innovative antidiabetic drugs use and non-optimal follow-up and control of diabetes complications. In simulation scenarios, we also estimated an overall expenditure ranging from 38.7 to 94.0 million and a loss of 294-836 utilities. Conclusion: Diabetic population paid a high tribute to pandemic and lockdown, both in terms of number of deaths and burden of diabetic complications, together with an overall deterioration of quality of life.","Torre, E.; Colombo, G.

Whether there is an association between lifestyle behaviors and the acquisition of COVID-19 remains unclear. METHODS: In this case-control study, we recruited 105 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection as a case group from the Wuhan Tongji Hospital (Wuhan, China). For each case two control subjects were recruited. Participants were randomly selected from communities in Wuhan and matched for sex, age (± 2yrs), and pre-existing comorbidities (hypertension and diabetes). RESULTS: A total of 105 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and 210 controls were included. Compared with control group, the case group had higher proportions of lack of sleep (30.5% vs. 14.8%, P = 0.001) and increased physical activities (56.2% vs. 32.9%, P < 0.001).

In April 2020, clinicians at 56 Dean Street sexual health and advice clinic in central London described social isolation as 'a unique window of opportunity' to 'break the chain' in HIV transmission. This was followed by critical responses within HIV prevention circles. Drawing from these responses, this article examines the implications of the clinic's 'Test Now, Stop HIV' campaign by asking how has the early COVID-19 pandemic reshaped institutional responses and strategies to end HIV transmission in England? We assess how campaign messages developed between April and May 2020. We analyse materials related to the campaign, including the clinic's Twitter account, the campaign website, and journalism in mainstream media. Based on this information, we discuss three themes: testing and issues of access; the biopolitics of testing; and the idealism of quarantine. We draw on sociology, cultural theory and science and technology studies to describe how the 'end of HIV' was constructed through the link between COVID-19 and HIV. We suggest the campaign reinscribes historical perceptions of abstinence and quarantine as idealised HIV prevention strategies, and thus fails to address safer sex in the time of Coronavirus.","Ledin, Chase; Weil, Benjamin",Cult Health Sex,430,24

However, data on pre-existing disparities in telemedicine utilization is currently lacking. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to study: (1) the prevalence of outpatient telemedicine visits before the COVID-19 pandemic by patient subgroups based on age, comorbidity burden, residence rurality, and median household income; and (2) associated diagnosis categories. RESEARCH DESIGN: This was a retrospective cohort study. SUBJECT: Commercial claims data from the Truven MarketScan database (2014-2018) representing n=846,461,609 outpatient visits. MEASURES: We studied characteristics and utilization of outpatient telemedicine services before the COVID-19 pandemic by patient subgroups based on age, comorbidity burden, residence rurality, and median household income. Disparities were assessed in unadjusted and adjusted (regression) analyses. RESULTS: With overall telemedicine uptake of 0.12% (n=1,018,092/846,461,609 outpatient visits) we found that pre-COVID-19 disparities in telemedicine use became more pronounced over time with lower use in patients who were older, had more comorbidities, were in rural areas, and had lower median household incomes (all trends and effect estimates P<0.001). CONCLUSION: These results contextualize pre-existing disparities in telemedicine use and are crucial in the monitoring of potential disparities in telemedicine access and subsequent outcomes after the rapid expansion of telemedicine during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Poeran, Jashvant; Cho, Logan D; Wilson, Lauren; Zhong, Haoyan; Mazumdar, Madhu; Liu, Jiabin; Memtsoudis, Stavros G",Med. care,430,16

Currently, the world is concerned about the 2019 novel CoV (SARS-CoV-2) that was initially identified in the city of Wuhan, China in December 2019. Patients presented with severe viral pneumonia and respiratory illness. The number of cases has been mounting since then. As of late February 2020, tens of thousands of cases and several thousand deaths have been reported in China alone, in addition to thousands of cases in other countries. Although the fatality rate of SARS-CoV-2 is currently lower than SARS-CoV, the virus seems to be highly contagious based on the number of infected cases to date. In this review, we discuss structure, genome organization, entry of CoVs into target cells, and provide insights into past and present outbreaks. The future of human CoV outbreaks will not only depend on how the viruses will evolve, but will also depend on how we develop efficient prevention and treatment strategies to deal with this continuous threat.","Ashour, Hossam M; Elkhatib, Walid F; Rahman, Md Masudur; Elshabrawy, Hatem A",,430,33

American Indian and Alaska Native persons are more likely to be infected, experience complications, and die from coronavirus. Evidence suggests that Indigenous persons have 3.5 times the incidence rate of non-Hispanic/Latinx whites. Unfortunately, this is likely a gross underestimate because of a lack of reliable and accurate COVID-19 data for American Indian and Alaska Native populations. Multiple factors contribute to poor data quality including the lack of Indigenous representation in the data and rampant racial misclassification at both the individual and group levels. The current pandemic has shed light on multiple pre-existing issues related to Indigenous data sovereignty in data collection and management. We discuss the importance of centring Indigenous data sovereignty in the systemic efforts to increase COVID-19 data availability and quality. The federal and state governments must support and promote Tribes' rights to access data. Federal and state governments should also focus on bolstering their data availability and quality for aggregated data on AIAN populations and for providing disaggregated Tribal data to Tribes. Given the pivotal moment in the United States with ongoing and parallel pandemics of coronavirus and racism, we urge demographers and population scientists to reflect on the role of structural racism in data, data collection and analysis.","Yellow Horse, Aggie J; Huyser, Kimberly R",J Popul Res (Canberra),430,26

The incidence of infection with acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) during the first wave of the COVID-19 epidemic was 3.3% among dialysis patients-13 times higher than in the general population. The corresponding mortality rate was high, reaching 21%. As of 19th April, 2021, the cumulative prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in French dialysis patients was 14%. Convergent scientific data from France, Italy, the United Kingdom and Canada show that home dialysis reduces the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection by a factor of at least two. Unfortunately, home dialysis in France is not sufficiently developed: the proportion of dialysis patients being treated at home is only 7%. The obstacles to the provision of home care for patients with end-stage kidney disease in France include (i) an unfavourable pricing policy for home haemodialysis and nurse visits for assisted peritoneal dialysis (PD), (ii) insufficient training in home dialysis for nephrologists, (iii) the small number of administrative authorizations for home dialysis programs, and (iv) a lack of structured, objective information on renal replacement therapies for patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD). We propose a number of pragmatic initiatives that could be simultaneously enacted to improve the situation in three areas: (i) the provision of objective information on renal replacement therapies for patients with advanced CKD, (ii) wider authorization of home dialysis networks and (iii) price increases in favour of home dialysis procedures.","Rostoker, Guy; Issad, Belkacem; Fessi, Hafedh; Massy, Ziad A",J. nephrol,430,16

When validated using plasma samples that are positive or negative for SARS-CoV-2, the agglutination assay detected antibodies against the receptor-binding domain of the spike (S-RBD) or the nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2 with 100% specificity and ∼98% sensitivity. Furthermore, we found that the strength of the S-RBD antibody response measured by the agglutination assay correlated with the efficiency of the plasma in blocking RBD binding to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 in a surrogate neutralization assay, suggesting that the agglutination assay might be used to identify individuals with virus-neutralizing antibodies. Intriguingly, we found that &gt;92% of patients had detectable antibodies on the day of a positive viral RNA test, suggesting that the agglutination antibody test might complement RNA testing for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Esmail, Sally Knauer Michael J.; Abdoh, Husam Voss Courtney Chin-Yee Benjamin Stogios Peter Seitova Almagul Hutchinson Ashley Yusifov Farhad Skarina Tatiana Evdokimova Elena Ackloo Suzanne Lowes Lori Hedley Benjamin D.; Bhayana, Vipin Chin-Yee Ian Li Shawn S.

Our primary outcome was mortality. Intensive care unit (ICU) admission, intubation, vasopressor, and renal replacement therapy requirements were secondary outcomes. Multivariate regression analysis determined whether MT-DNA levels were independent of other reported COVID-19 risk factors. Receiver operating characteristic and area under the curve assessments were used to compare MT-DNA levels with established and emerging inflammatory markers of COVID-19.ResultsCirculating MT-DNA levels were highly elevated in patients who eventually died or required ICU admission, intubation, vasopressor use, or renal replacement therapy. Multivariate regression revealed that high circulating MT-DNA was an independent risk factor for these outcomes after adjusting for age, sex, and comorbidities. We also found that circulating MT-DNA levels had a similar or superior area under the curve when compared against clinically established measures of inflammation and emerging markers currently of interest as investigational targets for COVID-19 therapy.ConclusionThese results show that high circulating MT-DNA levels are a potential early indicator for poor COVID-19 outcomes.FundingWashington University Institute of Clinical Translational Sciences COVID-19 Research Program and Washington University Institute of Clinical Translational Sciences (ICTS) NIH grant UL1TR002345.","Scozzi, Davide; Cano, Marlene; Ma, Lina; Zhou, Dequan; Zhu, Ji Hong; O039,; Halloran, Jane A; Goss, Charles; Rauseo, Adriana M; Liu, Zhiyi; Sahu, Sanjaya K; Peritore, Valentina; Rocco, Monica; Ricci, Alberto; Amodeo, Rachele; Aimati, Laura; Ibrahim, Mohsen; Hachem, Ramsey; Kreisel, Daniel; Mudd, Philip A; Kulkarni, Hrishikesh S; Gelman, Andrew E",JCI insight,430,7

Lipids, particularly ceramides, cholesterol, and free fatty acids, together form lamellar membranes in the extracellular spaces of the SC that limit the loss of water and electrolytes. In addition to preventing water and electrolyte loss, the SC as a permeability barrier prevents the entry of harmful irritants, allergens, and microorganisms into the skin. Disruption of the epidermal barrier leads to skin that is irritated, more reactive, and more sensitive than normal skin. SC thickness, lipid profile, and barrier function vary with different ethnic groups, which is also reflected the differences in prevalence and manifestation of diverse skin conditions related to the skin barrier function such as atopic dermatitis and sensitive skin. In addition to these compromised skin barrier related conditions, we are just now starting to understand the direct and indirect impact of COVID-19 on the skin and how current preventative measures are contributing to skin barrier disorders. Our understanding of various approaches for restoration of skin barrier, especially the role of topically applied mixtures of cholesterol, ceramides, and essential/nonessential free fatty acids (FFAs) allows for the strengthening of the compromised skin barrier and alleviation of symptoms and discomfort associated with skin barrier disorders. Ceramide containing products on the market are commonly available and offer protection and reparative benefits to the skin barrier.

Key disturbances comprise abnormal cytokine production (increased type I IFN, IL-6, IL-17, IL-12 and IL-23, BAFF) and B lineage cell abnormalities. In the light of the recent SARS-Cov2 pandemic, the role of type I IFN and humoral immunity became of great interest and a number of similarities, but also subtle differences, to SLE became apparent and will be addressed based on recent data. Inflammatory cytokines or their corresponding cytokine receptors have been identified as therapeutic targets. Since these cytokines activate various intracellular pathways, such as Jak/Stat signaling, activation of the NfkB or BCR signaling pathways (i.e. spleen tyrosine kinase [Syk]), Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK), small molecules inhibiting these pathways are being investigated in various clinical studies permitting a concept of multiple targeting therapy.1 Recent study experiences blocking Jak1/Jak2 pathways with baricitinib showed clinical improvements over 24 weeks2 and identified a number of molecules downstream of Stat1, Stat2, and Stat4 correlating with SLE activity.3 A Phase Ib/IIa trial using tofacitinib as Jak1/Jak3 selective inhibitor in SLE has also been reported limited to safety but also mechanistic insights.4 The recent identification of hyporesponsive but not hyperresponsive B cell functions among SLE and other autoimmune diseases (RA, Sjögren's) require consideration of anergic postactivated (APA) B cells with increased phosphatase activity and responding to CD40 stimulation most pronounced in SLE.5 As a result, inhibitors of preferred B cell activation pathways (BTK4, Syk etc.) that generated hope based on experiences with anti-CD20 therapy failed in various SLE and rheumatoid arthritis trials, including a Phase 2 study with the BTK inhibitor fenebrutinib (GDC-0853)4 and evobrutinib (e-ACR 2020). Notably, evobrutinib was very efficacious in RRMS5 which also opens new avenues of the understanding of a differential pathogenesis6 of the two diseases. Thus, consideration of APA B cells in certain autoimmune diseases responding to CD40 activation may guide the development of successful new therapies in SLE and other diseases. Learning Objectives •Discuss the translational rationale and distinct mechanisms of action for novel therapeutic targets in SLE within the context of APA B cells •Explain the significance of certain signaling pathways, especially Jak/Stat and BCR/TLR signaling as potential treatment targets in SLE.","Dörner, T.",Lupus Science and Medicine,430,26

Meanwhile, many others were laid off or worked reduced hours, and some front line workers were required to work longer hours. Concurrently, a surge in reports of ""pandemic baking"" suggested a cascade effect on eating behaviors, which may be an inadvertent strategy to cope with stress. We conducted an online survey of people living in Canada or the United States (N = 680) to assess how employment change may have been experienced as stressful and linked to a shift in food choices. Regression models suggested that reduced hours and being laid off were associated with greater stress appraisals, avoidant- and emotion-focused coping responses, and negative affect. In turn, negative affect was associated with eating to cope and unhealthy snack choices, like salty or sweet treats. Our study emphasizes that under stressful conditions, such as those experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic, some coping strategies may contribute to the greater vulnerability to downstream effects, particularly those relating to eating choices and nutritional balances.","Chee, Melissa J; Koziel Ly, Nikita K; Anisman, Hymie; Matheson, Kimberly",Nutrients,430,1

MATERIAL AND METHOD: Data were compiled from the Norwegian Surveillance System for Communicable Diseases, the Norwegian Cardiovascular Disease Registry and the Cancer Registry of Norway. Univariable and multivariable regression models were used to calculate both relative and absolute risk. RESULTS: In the first half of 2020, 8 809 people tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and 260 COVID-19-associated deaths were registered. Increasing age, male sex (relative risk (RR): 1.5; confidence interval (CI): 1.2-2.0), prior stroke (RR: 1.5; CI: 1.0-2.1) and cancer with distant metastasis at the time of diagnosis (RR: 3.0; CI: 1.1-8.2) were independent risk factors for death after a diagnosis of COVID-19. After adjusting for age and sex, myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation, heart failure, hypertension, and non-metastatic cancer were no longer statistically significant risk factors for death. INTERPRETATION: The leading risk factor for death among individuals who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 was age. Male sex, and a previous diagnosis of stroke or cancer with distant metastasis were also associated with an increased risk of death after a COVID-19 diagnosis.","Kvåle, Rune; Bønaa, Kaare Harald; Forster, Rachel; Gravningen, Kirsten; Júlíusson, Pétur Benedikt; Myklebust, Tor Åge",Tidsskr. nor. laegeforen.,430,28

Second year, Doctor of Physical Therapy (DPT) students were surveyed regarding their learning experiences during an online Foundational Sciences course that included a mix of anatomy, physiology, pathology and pharmacology instruction. The purpose was to gain perceptions into best strategies for online instruction for those content areas that promoted course objective competency with an emphasis on learner engagement. Fifty-four DPT students were surveyed following the completion of an 8-week summer semester Foundational Sciences course at the University of the Incarnate Word, School of Physical Therapy, DPT program. The 7-question anonymous survey addressed content delivered both synchronously (live) and asynchronously (prerecorded or self-regulated) with regard to time, synchronous class size and format (large group vs. breakout room), use of asynchronous voiceovers and video tutorials, and rating of specific activities promoting engagement. Open feedback questions addressed virtual course elements that students identified as most and least supportive of content mastery. Fifty responses were collected (93% response rate). Findings from the survey indicated a preference for synchronous sessions of 1.5 hr (94%) in length with the combination of both large and small group (breakout room) sessions (90%). Sixty percent of respondents preferred having a mix of synchronous classes with the entire cohort of 54 learners and smaller synchronous sessions with half the cohort. While 50% indicated a preference for more asynchronous PowerPoint voiceovers, 46% indicated that they preferred not having asynchronous voiceovers that aligned with every synchronous class. Activities promoting engagement received mixed ratings overall using a 5-point Likert scale ranging from poor to excellent. Activities that received majority satisfactory ratings included Poll Everywhere (44%), Zoom annotation tool (40%), Zoom breakout room activities (44%) and StudyMate flashcards (56%). Activities with roughly equivalent ratings for satisfactory, very good and excellent included asynchronous voiceovers (28-36%) and Kahoot quizzes (26-38%). The inclusion of guest speakers was least favorable (32% combined poor and fair responses) out of all the activities utilized to enhance engagement. Respondent open feedback indicated that accessibility to recorded synchronous sessions and asynchronous voiceovers were most valuable to their learning. Question interruptions during synchronous sessions and discussion-based breakout room sessions with less structure was least helpful to their learning. Respondents consistently identified optimal duration and format of online instructional delivery but varied in their responses related to activities promoting learner engagement. This finding could be attributed to variations in learning styles and merits further study.

We learned that both SARS and COVID-19 patients had thyroid abnormalities. In the limited number of SARS cases, where it was examined, decreased serum T3, T4 and TSH levels were detected. In a study of survivors of SARS approximately 7% of the patients had hypothyroidism. In the previous evaluation evidence was found that pituitary function was also affected in SARS. Others suggested a hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis dysfunction. One result published recently indicates that a primary injury to the thyroid gland itself may play a key role in the pathogenesis of thyroid disorders in COVID-19 patients, too. Subacute thyroiditis, autoimmune thyroiditis and an atypical form of thyroiditis are complications of COVID-19. Thyroid hormone dysfunction affects the outcome by increasing mortality in critical illnesses like acute respiratory distress syndrome, which is a leading complication in COVID-19. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is a membrane-bound enzyme, which is also expressed in the thyroid gland and the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) uses it for docking, entering as well as replication. Based on the available results obtained in the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, beside others, we suggest that it is necessary to monitor thyroid hormones in COVID-19.","Speer, Gábor; Somogyi, Péter",Endocr J,430,28

Covid-19 has fundamentally challenged the global health care system in all aspects. However, there is a growing concern for the subsequent detrimental effects of continuing delays or adjustments on time-dependent treatments for Covid-19 negative patients. Patients arriving to the ED with STEMIs and acute CVA are currently presumed to have delays due to Covid-19 related concerns. The objective of this paper is to evaluate the implications of the Covid-19 pandemic on non-Covid19 patients in emergency care settings. We conducted a retrospective study from February 2020 to April 2020 and compared this to a parallel period in 2019 to assess the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on three distinct non-Covid-19 ED diagnosis that require immediate intervention. Our primary outcome measures were time to primary PCI in acute STEMI, time to fibrinolysis in acute CVA, and time to femoral hip fracture correction surgery. Our secondary outcome measure included a composite outcome of length of stay in hospital and mortality. From 1 February 2020 to 30 April 2020, the total referrals to ED diagnosed with STEMI, Hip fracture and CVA of which required intervention were 197 within Covid-19 group 2020 compared to 250 in the control group 2019. Mean duration to intervention (PCI, surgery and tPA, respectively) did not differ between COVID-19 group and 2019 group. Among femoral hip fracture patients', the referral numbers to ED were significantly lower in Covid-19 era (p = 0.040) and the hospitalization stay was significantly shorter (p = 0.003). Among CVA patients', we found statistical differences among the number of referrals and the patients' age. Coping with the Covid-19 pandemic presents a challenge for the general healthcare system. Our results suggest that with proper management, despite the obstacles of isolation policies and social distancing, any negative impact on the quality of health care for the non-Covid-19 patients can be minimized in the emergency department setting.","Ben-Haim, Gal; Zabatani, Amit; Orion, David; Leshem, Eyal; Irony, Avinoah; Katorza, Eldad",Intern. emerg. med,430,16

Moreover, in this paper, we employ the quantile regression model to investigate the impact of leverage on different level of stock price synchronicity, which provides us a more comprehensive picture. Our empirical results show, operating and financing leverage have negative impact on stock price synchronicity. Moreover, the higher the stock price synchronicity becomes, the higher this impact is. Furthermore, the marginal effect of financing leverage will be attenuated as the profitability of firms becomes higher, but the interaction effect doesn't exist for operating leverage. On the contrary, the marginal effect of financing leverage will be enhanced as the market capitalization of firms becomes larger, again, it doesn't exist for operating leverage.

As a case study we selected the Republic of Ireland. We use data provided by Ireland's COVID-19 Data-Hub and simulate the evolution of the pandemic with and without the vaccination in place for two different scenarios, one representative of a national lockdown situation and the other indicating looser restrictions in place. One of the main findings of our work is that the optimal approach would involve a vaccination programme where the older population is vaccinated in larger numbers earlier while simultaneously part of the younger population also gets vaccinated to lower the risk of transmission between groups.","Zavrakli, Eleni; Parnell, Andrew; Malone, David; Duffy, Ken; Dey, Subhrakanti",,430,16

Our first objective was to identify behavioral language and speech markers of early-stage PPA. Our second objective was to identify the electrophysiological correlates of the language and speech characteristics in PPA. Method The databases MEDLINE, Web of Science, and Embase were searched for relevant articles. To identify behavioral markers, the initial subjective complaints and the language and speech deficits detected during the initial diagnostic evaluation were summarized for PPA in general and each clinical variant according to the 2011 consensus diagnostic criteria (nonfluent variant [NFV], semantic variant, and logopenic variant [LV]). To identify electrophysiological markers, the studies in which event-related potentials (ERPs) were elicited by a language or speech paradigm in patients with PPA were included. Results In total, 114 relevant studies were identified, including 110 behavioral studies and only four electrophysiological studies. This review suggests that patients with the semantic variant could be accurately differentiated from the NFV and LV in the initial stages based on the consensus criteria. Nonetheless, the early differentiation between the NFV and LV is not straightforward. In the four electrophysiological studies, differences in the latency, amplitude, and topographical distribution of the semantic N400 component were found between patients with PPA and healthy controls. Conclusions To accurately differentiate the NFV from the LV, it could be important to assess the language and speech degeneration by more specific assessments and by more objective diagnostic methods that offer insights into the language-related processes. Electrophysiological markers of PPA were not identified in this review due to the low number of studies that investigated language-related ERPs. More controlled ERP studies in larger patient cohorts are needed to investigate the diagnostic applicability of language-related ERPs in PPA.

High-dimensional flow cytometric characterization of immune cell subsets was performed at admission, 30 systemic cytokines/chemokines levels were sequentially measured, thirteen endothelial markers were determined at admission and at the zenith of the cytokines. Computed tomography scans on admission were quantified for lung damage and hepatic steatosis (n = 23). Abnormal BMI (> 25) observed in 72.6% of patients, was associated with a higher rate of intensive care unit hospitalization (p = 0.044). SARS-CoV-2 RNAaemia, peripheral immune cell subsets and cytokines/chemokines were similar among BMI groups. A significant association between inflammatory cytokines and liver, renal, and endothelial dysfunctions was observed only in patients with obesity (BMI > 30). In contrast, early signs of lung damage (ground-glass opacity) correlated with Th1/M1/inflammatory cytokines only in normal weight patients.

The first 500 patients who were tested positive for COVID 19 and getting treated in our hospital were included in the study after taking written informed consent from the patients who were willing to participate in the study. A detailed history was taken from all the patients and more stress was given on the ENT symptoms with respect to its onset, duration and time taken for the relief of symptoms. The ENT symptoms were compared with the category of the disease as well as the blood group of the patients. Statistical analysis was done using Chi square test and Statistical Package for Social Sciences [SPSS] for Windows Version 22.0 Released 2013. Armonk, NY: IBM Corp., was used to perform statistical analyses. In our study 310 (62.0%) were males and 190 (38.0%) patients were females (38%), of age group ranging from 2 years to 87 years. In our study 367 (73.3%) patients were symptomatic and the rest 133 (26.6%) were asymptomatic. There were 335 (67.0%) patients in category A, 140 (28.0%) in category B and 25 (5.0%) in category C. The most common ENT presentation was headache and its prevelance was more in category C and it was of statistical significance. On comparing the blood group and the ENT symptoms occurrence of sore throat was of statistical significance and its prevelance was more among the O blood group patients. In terms of recovery from the disease the patients with blood group O had good recovery rate. Covid 19 pandemic is still an on going problem and newer strains of the virus are arising as well hence. In our study we found out that isolated ENT symptoms such as aguesia and anosmia were the only presentation of the disease.

Generally, relatives are recognized as vital partners in health care, but in-depth knowledge on how these family involvement processes take place in the everyday practices of EDs is sparse. The aim of this study is to explore the practice of involving relatives in the acute ambulatory clinical pathway in the ED, as seen from the perspectives of patients and relatives. METHODS: The study was conducted as ethnographic fieldwork in an ED at a Danish Regional Hospital. Two months of participant-observation were carried out focusing on 43 patients. Of these, 18 patients and/or relatives were selected for telephone interviews after 1 week, and of these 11 were selected for in-depth interviews 3 weeks later. RESULTS: Unpredictability is a basic condition of any ED. For the patients and relatives, who are unfamiliar with the routines in the ED, unpredictability translates to a sense of temporal and existential unpredictability, reinforced by a sense of not knowing when the examinations will be completed or if/when they will be sent home. Relatives' involvement in the ED is affected by this sense of unpredictability and by the existing relations between patients and their relatives prior to entering the ED. The stay in the ED is only one 'stop' in the complete acute ambulatory clinical pathway but relatives' involvement also concerns the time before and after the stay in the ED. Practices of involving relatives leave (some) relatives invisible in the clinical pathway. As a consequence, they are often not addressed, which un-enables their involvement. CONCLUSION: Involvement of relatives presupposes recognizing the relatives as participants if they are to be involved in the patient's clinical pathway in the ED. As a start, it is advisable that the medical staff ask the patients on arrival who has accompanied them in the ED, and if and in what way they want their companions involved in the ED. There is a need for a more integrated and contextualized understanding of relatives' involvement, as it takes place along an extended acute ambulatory clinical pathway.","Sagoo, Susanne Nissen; Grytnes, Regine",BMC Health Serv Res,430,24

Data pertaining to patient census, presenting complaints, surgical procedures and resource consumption were compared in the 6-month period (March 25 to September 30, 2020) following national lockdown and subsequent gradual unlock to data of same time period last year. Results: A total of 1152 new patients visited Ophthalmology emergency service, whereas 324 sought tele-ophthalmology consultation.Majority were males (61.8%, n = 712), whereas average age of presentation was 34 ± 7.2 years. The number.of patients seeking emergency ophthalmic care reduced by 23.9% in the current year, in-patient record reduced by 96.53% and number of surgeries reduced by 98.13%. Tele-ophthalmology services comprised 21.95% of the total patient load. Use of triple layered surgical masks increased by 85.7%, use of disposable gloves increased by 89.5% but interestingly the availability of chlorhexidine hand rub fell by 15.9%, in the current year compared to last year. Conclusion: COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown have reduced the number of patients visiting tertiary health care facility for ophthalmic care. As manpower and resource consumption has increased, smart management is needed to tackle the current scenario efficiently. Tele-ophthalmology must be promoted and we must understand the changing trends to plan for the future accordingly.","Rehman, Obaidur; Ichhpujani, Parul; Nayyar, Shifali; Kumar, Suresh",Indian J Ophthalmol,430,26

This study evaluates the levels of dietary energy intake and the energy contributions of macronutrients, major food sources, and various eating occasions and processed food among Chinese adults. METHODS: The study examined a cross-sectional sample from CHNS and CNTCS 2015 that used three 24 h recalls and calculated energy intake and food sources based on the China Food Composition Table. After excluding extreme values, the analyses included 11,974 subjects aged 18-64. RESULTS: The estimated energy intake was 2063.3 kcal/d (2243.8 kcal/d for males and 1902.4 kcal/d for females), and 39.1% of subjects met the gender-age-PA-based Estimated Energy Requirement. The proportion of energy from fats was 35.8% without significant age or gender differences. Adults of lower socioeconomic statuses, indicated by lower education levels and lower household incomes per capita, consumed lower percentages of energy from fats and higher percentages from carbohydrates. The study population as a whole reported an average energy density of 1.88 kcal/g and an energy contribution from restaurant foods of 1.8%. CONCLUSIONS: The study reports a lower energy intake level than CHNS 2009. Adults living in southern China or urban areas, which are relatively developed regions, or with higher socioeconomic statuses consumed less energy from carbohydrates, moderate amounts from proteins, and more from fats, indicating a need for dietary guidelines or interventions that take into account socio-demographic factors.","Jiang, Hongru; Zhang, Ji; Du, Wenwen; Su, Chang; Zhang, Bing; Wang, Huijun",Eur. j. clin. nutr,430,24

This study aims to investigate the effect and safety of CZP in moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis. We performed a retrospective observational analysis of the moderate-to-severe psoriasis patients under ceratolizumab pegol therapy. Primer endpoints were efficacy of CZP, defined as statistically significant improvement of Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI), Physician's Global Assessment (PGA), and clinical Disease Activity index for Psoriatic Arthritis (cDAPSA) in the 24 week of therapy. Secondary endpoints were safety of CZP especially during COVID-19 pandemic. Fifty-six moderate-to-severe psoriasis patients treated with CZP were evaluated retrospectively. We observed a rapid and significant reduction of PASI, PGA, and cDAPSA scores in W4. After loading dose, we observed loss of clinical efficacy of CZP in eight patients and optimized therapy by increasing the dosing of CZP. Dose escalation of CZP permitted the achievement and long-term maintenance of clinical improvement in these patients. We compare the clinical efficacy of CZP between naive and patients who has been treated with other biologic agents. There were no statistical differences in efficacy between these two groups. No side effects were observed during CZP treatment. There were no cases of death from COVID-related disease in our study population or patients hospitalized for COVID-19 related disease. Our results demonstrate that CZP is an effective and safe therapeutic option for patients with moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis.","Turkmen, Meltem; Dogan, Sinan",Dermatol Ther,430,16

Invasive mechanical ventilation IMV can support gas exchange in patients failing non-invasive ventilation, but its reported outcome is highly variable between countries. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis on IMV for COVID-associated ARDS to study its outcome among different countries. METHODS: CENTRAL, MEDLINE/PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Scopus were systematically searched up to August 8, 2020. Studies reporting five or more patients with end point outcome for severe COVID 19 infection treated with IMV were included. The main outcome assessed was mortality. Baseline, procedural, outcome, and validity data were systematically appraised and pooled with random-effect methods. Subgroup analysis for different countries was performed. Meta-regression for the effect of study timing and patient age and were tested. Publication bias was examined. This trial was registered with PROSPERO under registration number CRD42020190365. FINDINGS: Our electronic search retrieved 4770 citations, 103 of which were selected for full-text review. Twenty-one studies with a combined population of 37359 patients with COVID-19 fulfilled the inclusion criteria. From this population, 5800 patients were treated by invasive mechanical ventilation. Out of those, 3301 patients reached an endpoint of ICU discharge or death after invasive mechanical ventilation while the rest were still in the ICU. Mortality from IMV was highly variable among the included studies ranging between 21% and 100%. Random-effect pooled estimates suggested an overall in-hospital mortality risk ratio of 0.70 (95% confidence interval 0.608 to 0.797; I2 = 98%). Subgroup analysis according to country of origin showed homogeneity in the 8 Chinese studies with high pooled mortality risk ratio of 0.97 (I2 = 24%, p = 0.23) (95% CI = 0.94-1.00), similar to Italy with a low pooled mortality risk ratio of 0.26 (95% CI 0.08-0.43) with homogeneity (p = 0.86) while the later larger studies coming from the USA showed pooled estimate mortality risk ratio of 0.60 (95% CI 0.43-0.76) with persistent heterogeneity (I2 = 98%, p<0.001). Meta-regression showed that outcome from IMV improved with time (p<0.001). Age had no statistically significant effect on mortality (p = 0.102). Publication bias was excluded by visualizing the funnel plot of standard error, Egger's test with p = 0.714 and Begg&Mazumdar test with p = 0.334. INTERPRETATION: The study included the largest number of patients with outcome findings of IMV in this current pandemic. Our findings showed that the use of IMV for selected COVID 19 patients with severe ARDS carries a high mortality, but outcome has improved over the last few months and in more recent studies. The results should encourage physicians to use this facility when indicated for severely ill COVID-19 patients.","Elsayed, Hany Hasan; Hassaballa, Aly Sherif; Ahmed, Taha Aly; Gumaa, Mohammed; Sharkawy, Hazem Youssef; Moharram, Assem Adel",PLoS One,430,20

LAMP multiplexing with reverse transcription allows for the single-tube amplification of several RNA fragments, including an internal control sample, which provides the option of controlling all analytical steps. We developed a method of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA detection based on multiplex reverse-transcription LAMP, with single-tube qualitative analysis of SARS-CoV-2 RNA and MS2 phage used as a control RNA. The multiplexing is based on the differences in characteristic melting peaks generated during the amplification process. The developed technique detects at least 20 copies of SARS-CoV-2 RNA per reaction on a background of 12,000 MS2 RNA copies. The total time of analysis does not exceed 40 min. The method validation, performed on 125 clinical samples of patients' nasal swabs, showed a 97.6% concordance rate with the results of real-time (RT)-PCR assays.

Whereas these devices provide excellent protection of the user, there is an added element of risk during doffing and cleaning of the device. An additional layer of barrier protection, in the form of a polypropylene gown, to be worn over the hood and motor belt, can be used to minimise this risk. However, the device entrains air perpendicular to the lie of the gown, resulting in the impermeable material being sucked into the air intake, and partial occlusion of flow. In this report, we describe a clinical-academic partnership whereby a bespoke filter guard was designed to disrupt airflow and prevent gown entrainment, thereby enabling full barrier protection of both the device and user. This intervention was simple, cheap, scalable and able to be mass produced.","Miles, L F; Chuen, J; Edwards, L; Hohmann, J D; Williams, R; Peyton, P; Grayden, D B",Anaesth Rep,430,16

We conducted an online study during the epidemic to explore the mental state of tumor patients and their families during this extraordinary time. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was carried out. Questionnaires were distributed through the WeChat ""Questionnaire Star"" network. The snowball sampling technique was adopted and further promoted by subjects who had completed the questionnaire. RESULTS: A total of 1,030 valid questionnaires were collected. There were 609 (59.13%) tumor patients and 421 (40.87%) family members. One hundred and fifty-six (15.15%) subjects had anxiety, among which 65 (6.31%) had moderate to severe anxiety. Single-factor analysis indicated that age (>60 years old), the farmer occupation, and a high sleep disorder assessment score were risk factors for anxiety, while the latter two might also be independent risk factors, as suggested by multi-factor analysis. Infrequent contact with doctors was an independent risk factor for cancer patients, while uninterrupted anti-tumor therapy was an independent protective factor. 40.19% of the subjects expressed a need for psychosocial support during the COVID-19 period.

413536,413536,413536,Video-Based Telehealth Visits Decrease With Increasing Age,14.979283,4.9651866,2020,"BACKGROUND: The SARS-CoV-2 variant B.1.1.7 was first identified in December, 2020, in England. We aimed to investigate whether increases in the proportion of infections with this variant are associated with differences in symptoms or disease course, reinfection rates, or transmissibility. METHODS: We did an ecological study to examine the association between the regional proportion of infections with the SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 variant and reported symptoms, disease course, rates of reinfection, and transmissibility. Data on types and duration of symptoms were obtained from longitudinal reports from users of the COVID Symptom Study app who reported a positive test for COVID-19 between Sept 28 and Dec 27, 2020 (during which the prevalence of B.1.1.7 increased most notably in parts of the UK). From this dataset, we also estimated the frequency of possible reinfection, defined as the presence of two reported positive tests separated by more than 90 days with a period of reporting no symptoms for more than 7 days before the second positive test. The proportion of SARS-CoV-2 infections with the B.1.1.7 variant across the UK was estimated with use of genomic data from the COVID-19 Genomics UK Consortium and data from Public Health England on spike-gene target failure (a non-specific indicator of the B.1.1.7 variant) in community cases in England. We used linear regression to examine the association between reported symptoms and proportion of B.1.1.7. We assessed the Spearman correlation between the proportion of B.1.1.7 cases and number of reinfections over time, and between the number of positive tests and reinfections. We estimated incidence for B.1.1.7 and previous variants, and compared the effective reproduction number, Rt, for the two incidence estimates. FINDINGS: From Sept 28 to Dec 27, 2020, positive COVID-19 tests were reported by 36 920 COVID Symptom Study app users whose region was known and who reported as healthy on app sign-up. We found no changes in reported symptoms or disease duration associated with B.1.1.7. For the same period, possible reinfections were identified in 249 (0·7% [95% CI 0·6-0·8]) of 36 509 app users who reported a positive swab test before Oct 1, 2020, but there was no evidence that the frequency of reinfections was higher for the B.1.1.7 variant than for pre-existing variants. Reinfection occurrences were more positively correlated with the overall regional rise in cases (Spearman correlation 0·56-0·69 for South East, London, and East of England) than with the regional increase in the proportion of infections with the B.1.1.7 variant (Spearman correlation 0·38-0·56 in the same regions), suggesting B.1.1.7 does not substantially alter the risk of reinfection. We found a multiplicative increase in the Rt of B.1.1.7 by a factor of 1·35 (95% CI 1·02-1·69) relative to pre-existing variants. However, Rt fell below 1 during regional and national lockdowns, even in regions with high proportions of infections with the B.1.1.7 variant. INTERPRETATION: The lack of change in symptoms identified in this study indicates that existing testing and surveillance infrastructure do not need to change specifically for the B.1.1.7 variant. In addition, given that there was no apparent increase in the reinfection rate, vaccines are likely to remain effective against the B.1.1.7 variant.

In January 2020, the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) announced air traffic restriction in response to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. This study's aim is to empirically examine the policy effectiveness. METHOD: The data from 2 third-party platforms are used in this investigation. The COVID-19 data from the platform DXY and the air traffic data from Airsavvi are matched to each other. The robust panel regression with controlling city effect and time effect is conducted. RESULTS: The curvilinear relations are found between the air traffic restriction and the existing cases, and the recovery rate (quadratic term = 9.006 and -0.967, respectively). As the strength of air traffic restriction is growing, the negative effect (-8.146) of air traffic restriction on the existing cases and the positive effect (0.961) of air traffic restriction on the recovery rate, respectively, begin decreasing. CONCLUSION: On the macro level, the air traffic restriction may help alleviate the growth of existing cases and help raise the recovery rate of COVID-19 in megacities of China, but both these effects will marginally recede as the restriction strength is intensifying.","Li, Jiannan; Wang, Zhaoguo; Yuan, Bocong; Liang, Haixuan; Liang, Wenqi",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,430,16

RESEARCH QUESTION: What is the global point estimate of deaths and risk factors for patients who are admitted to ICUs with severe COVID-19? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: In this systematic review and meta-analysis Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane library were searched up to August 1, 2020. Pooled prevalence of participant characteristics, clinical features, and outcome data was calculated with the use of random effects models. Subgroup analyses were based on geographic distribution, study type, quality assessment, sample size, end date, and patient disposition. RESULTS: Forty-five studies with 16,561 patients from 17 countries across four continents were included. Patients with COVID-19 who were admitted to ICUs had a mean age of 62.6 years (95% CI, 60.4-64.7). Common comorbidities included hypertension (49.5%; 95% CI, 44.9-54.0) and diabetes mellitus (26.6%; 95% CI, 22.7-30.8). More than three-quarters of cases experienced the development of ARDS (76.1%; 95% CI, 65.7-85.2). Invasive mechanical ventilation was required in 67.7% (95% CI, 59.1-75.7) of case, vasopressor support in 65.9% (95% CI, 52.4-78.4) of cases, renal replacement therapy in 16.9% (95% CI, 12.1-22.2) of cases, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in 6.4% (95% CI, 4.1-9.1) of cases. The duration of ICU and hospital admission was 10.8 days (95% CI, 9.3-18.4) and 19.1 days (95% CI, 16.3-21.9), respectively, with in-hospital mortality rate of 28.1% (95% CI, 23.4-33.0; I2 = 96%). No significant subgroup effect was observed.

To this end, lower limb functional electrical stimulation (FES) cycling holds promise. OBJECTIVE: To investigate pain reduction in a sample of patients with SCI by means of lower limb rehabilitation using FES cycling. DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Sixteen patients with incomplete and complete SCIs, attending the Neurorobotic Unit of our research institute and reporting pain at or below the level of their SCI were recruited to this exploratory study. INTERVENTIONS: Patients undertook two daily sessions of FES cycling, six times weekly, for 6 weeks. OUTCOME MEASURES: Pain outcomes were measured using the 0-10 numerical rating scale (NRS), the Multidimensional Pain Inventory for SCI (MPI-SCI), and the 36-Item Short Form Survey (SF-36). Finally, we assessed the features of dorsal laser-evoked potentials (LEPs) to objectively evaluate AÎ´ ï¬ber pathways. RESULTS: All participants tolerated the intervention well, and completed the training without side effects. Statistically significant changes were found in pain-NRS, MPI-SCI, and SF-36 scores, and LEP amplitudes. Following treatment, we found that three patients experienced high pain relief (an NRS decrease of at least 80%), six individuals achieved moderate pain relief (an NRS decrease of about 30-70%), and five participants had mild pain relief (an NRS decrease of less than 30%). CONCLUSION: Our preliminary results suggest that FES cycling training is capable of reducing the pain reported by patients with SCI, regardless of American Spinal Injury Association scoring, pain level, or the neurological level of injury. The neurophysiological mechanisms underlying such effects are likely to be both spinal and supraspinal.","Calabrò, Rocco Salvatore; Portaro, Simona; Tomasello, Provvidenza; Porcari, Bruno; Balletta, Tina; Naro, Antonino",J Spinal Cord Med,430,16

Nrf2 activity declines with age, making the elderly more susceptible to oxidative stress-mediated diseases, which include type 2 diabetes, chronic inflammation, and viral infections. Published evidence suggests that Nrf2 activity may regulate important mechanisms affecting viral susceptibility and replication. We examined gene expression levels by GeneChip microarray and by RNA-seq assays. We found that the potent Nrf2-activating composition PB125® downregulates ACE2 and TMPRSS2 mRNA expression in human liver-derived HepG2 cells. ACE2 is a surface receptor and TMPRSS2 activates the spike protein for SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells. Furthermore, in endotoxin-stimulated primary human pulmonary artery endothelial cells, we report the marked downregulation by PB125 of 36 genes encoding cytokines. These include IL-1beta, IL-6, TNF-α, the cell adhesion molecules ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and E-selectin, and a group of IFN-γ-induced genes. Many of these cytokines have been specifically identified in the “cytokine storm” observed in fatal cases of COVID-19, suggesting that Nrf2 activation may significantly decrease the intensity of the storm.","McCord, Joe M.; Hybertson, Brooks M.; Cota-Gomez, Adela; Geraci, Kara P.; Gao, Bifeng",Antioxidants,430,24

Case Presentation: We report two cases of cardiac emergency associated with COVID-19. Case 1 is a 50-year-old female patient with chronic hypertension and chronic renal failure. Case 2 is a 64-year-old female with atrial fibrillation and recent stroke. Both were admitted to an isolation intensive care unit that was designated specifically to patients with COVID-19. Conclusions: During admission, both patients had sudden deterioration characterized by oxygen desaturation and hypotension necessitating inotropic support. As a result, for both patients, bedside echocardiography was performed by the attending inten-sivist. Echocardiographic findings showed cardiac tamponade and acute pulmonary embolism, respectively, which were confirmed by a cardiologist through telemedicine technology. Proper emergency management was initiated, and both patients recovered well. Limited bedside transthoracic echocardiography had a front-line impact on the treatment and outcome of the two patients with COVID-19.

Countries around the world have employed several measures in order to control the spread of the disease. In spite of the poor state of the healthcare delivery system in West Africa, the spread of the pandemic is relatively low compared to reported cases in other regions of the world. The study addresses this phenomenon by asking the question: is the low incidence of COVID-19 in the West African sub-region a mitigating healthcare delivery system or just a matter of time? Methods: The study adopted a cross-sectional time series method. Data for Ghana, Nigeria, Burkina Faso, Ivory Coast, Senegal, Niger Republic, and global data were extracted from the World Health Organization COVID-19 databank. Data were extracted in intervals of 7 days from March 15 through April 19, 2020. Data regarding the incidence growth rate and fatalities arising from COVID-19 complications were generated from the total reported cases and fatalities over specified periods. Descriptive and inferential statistical analyses were carried out using Stata version 14. Results: Results showed that the trends in growth patterns of COVID-19 for Senegal, Nigeria, Ghana, Republic of Niger, and West Africa generally followed the same fluctuating curves. The COVID-19 pandemic accounted for 92.3%, 97.8%, 90.3%, 65%, 90.4%, 93.6%, and 97% of complications that led to deaths of patients in Burkina Faso, Nigeria, Senegal, Ghana, Niger Republic, Ivory Coast, and West Africa, respectively. Also, the results established that there was a significant positive association between increased incidence of COVID-19 and percentage increase in fatalities arising from its complications in West Africa (ß = 0.032; t = 12.70; p < 0.001). Conclusion: The threat presently posed by COVID-19 seems to be minimal in West Africa despite the poor state of the healthcare delivery system in the region. It is unlikely, however, that the region is well prepared for the pandemic in the event that it escalates out of control with time.","Bankole, Taofik Olatunji; Omoyeni, Olajide Bamidele; Oyebode, Abiodun Oluwaseun; Akintunde, David Olumide",Z Gesundh Wiss,430,17

We hypothesize that the shifts in travel demand varied by socioeconomic status, and we assess the differential impact of COVID-19 in the Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) patronage across various socioeconomic groups in Bogotá. We built a database of frequent transit users with data collected by smartcards in Bogota’s BRT system between January and October 2020. For each user in the database, we labeled their home and work stations. Transactions at other stations are classified as “other.” The stratum (a government socioeconomic classification of residential units in Colombia) of a BRT station’s service area was assigned using an estimated probability vector for each user belonging to a specific stratum;this data is validated with aggregate strata distributions in the 2019 household travel survey. Our study found that the reduction in transactions for lower-strata users is significantly less than that of the middle and high strata. The magnitude of this difference varies over time but stabilizes after the end of the lockdown. The growth rate of “other” transactions per thousand people is greater than the growth for home and work locations, especially for the lowest strata. Other studies have shown that the radius of gyration (Rg) (a measure of how far individuals travel away from home) has decreased about 50% after the lockdowns. Our study shows that when measuring Rg only for users who continued using BRT, the Rg slightly decreased for lower and medium strata but increased for high strata. The contribution of this study is a method to classify BRT transactions of frequent users by strata, as well as a description of trends in BRT use by strata to expand our understanding of the COVID-19 lockdowns impacts in the Global South context. These results are a starting point to inform policy and decision-makers to guide the recovery efforts to improve transit accessibility and level of service for captive users such as low-stratum users. © Copyright © 2021 Caicedo, Walker and González.","Caicedo, J.

Methods: In this single center, retrospective case-control study, we included all COVID-19 inpatients transferred or admitted to Wuhan Tongji Hospital from January 3 to March 30 2020 who had definite clinical outcomes (cured or deceased) with complete laboratory and radiological results. Clinical data were extracted from the electronic medical records, and compared between the cured and deceased patients. ROC curves were used to evaluate the prognostic value of the clinical parameters, and multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to explore the risk factors for mortality. The correlation between the variables was evaluated by Spearman correlation analysis. Results: 208 patients were included in this study, 182 patients were cured and discharged, 26 patients died from COVID-2019. Most patients had comorbidities, with hypertension as the most common chronic disease (80; 38%). The most common symptoms at onset were fever (149; 72%), cough (137; 66%), and dyspnea (113; 54%). Elevated leucocytes, neutrophils, inflammatory biomarkers (CRP, ferritin, IL6, IL8, procalcitonin), PT, D-dimer, myocardial enzymes, BUN, decreased lymphocyte and subsets (T cells, CD4 T cells, CD8 T cells, NK cells, T cells + B cells + NK cells), and immunological factors (C3, C4) indicated poor outcome. PT, C3, and T cells were confirmed as independent prognostic factors for mortality by logistic regression models. IL6 and CPR were positively correlated with neutrophils, but negatively with lymphocytes and lymphocyte subsets except B cells. IL8 and ferritin were negatively related to T cells and CD4 T cells. Positive associations existed between C3 and T cells, CD4 T cells, and CD8 T cells, whereas there was no significant correlation between C4 and lymphocyte subsets. PT was found positively correlated with IL6, IL8, and CRP. Reverse correlations were explored between C3, C4, and PT, CK-MB, total bilirubin. Conclusions: T cells, C3, and PT were identified as independent prognostic factors for mortality.

SETTING: School structure was parametrized to reflect average U.S. classrooms, with elementary schools of 638 students and high schools of 1451 students. Daily local incidence was varied from 1 to 100 cases per 100 000 persons. PARTICIPANTS: Students, faculty, staff, and adult household members. INTERVENTION: Isolation of symptomatic individuals, quarantine of an infected individual's contacts, reduced class sizes, alternative schedules, staff vaccination, and weekly asymptomatic screening. MEASUREMENTS: Transmission was projected among students, staff, and families after a single infection in school and over an 8-week quarter, contingent on local incidence. RESULTS: School transmission varies according to student age and local incidence and is substantially reduced with mitigation measures. Nevertheless, when transmission occurs, it may be difficult to detect without regular testing because of the subclinical nature of most children's infections. Teacher vaccination can reduce transmission to staff, and asymptomatic screening improves understanding of local circumstances and reduces transmission. LIMITATION: Uncertainty exists about the susceptibility and infectiousness of children, and precision is low regarding the effectiveness of specific countermeasures, particularly with new variants. CONCLUSION: With controlled community transmission and moderate mitigation, elementary schools can open safety, but high schools require more intensive mitigation. Asymptomatic screening can facilitate reopening at higher local incidence while minimizing transmission risk.

Following these drastic cutbacks, a cautious resumption of elective care is planned. This also applies to the delivery of inpatient and day-care interdisciplinary multimodal pain therapy (IMPT). Since the majority of pain medicine centers have been closed to date, the question has arisen as to whether a resumption of regular care can be easily provided under the required protective measures. To answer this question, the authors conducted a survey among patients that were in a position to make a direct comparison between IMPT under normal conditions as well as under the currently required protective measures. The survey recorded the level of disruption caused by the different protective measures in the various treatment modules. An evaluation of the questionnaires, which were completed by two patient groups and all therapists involved, revealed that interdisciplinary multimodal pain therapy is possible without significant impairments even under the required protective measures. In particular, wearing protective masks proved to be the protective measure with the greatest negative impact. However, options like the use of protective visors or relocating treatment modules to the outdoors offer practicable alternative solutions for protection. Both patient and therapist satisfaction was high despite these constraints, and personal concern regarding possible infection low.","Luchting, Benjamin",Schmerz,430,15

METHODS: A comprehensive systematic literature search of the databases of PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Medline, Cochrane and MedRxiv, was carried out. RESULTS: The presence of orchitis as a potential complication of the infection by SARS-CoV-2 has not yet been confirmed. One study reported that 19% of males with COVID-19 infection had scrotal symptoms suggestive of viral orchitis which could not be confirmed. It is possible that the virus, rather than infecting the testes directly, may induce a secondary autoimmune response leading to autoimmune orchitis. COVID-19 has been associated with coagulation disorders and thus the orchitis could be the result of segmental vasculitis. Existing data concerning the presence of the virus in semen are contradictory. Only one study reported the presence of RNA in 15.8% of patients with COVID-19. However, the presence of nucleic acid or antigen in semen is not synonyms of viral replication capacity and infectivity. It has been reported an increase in serum levels of LH in males with COVID-19 and a significant reduction in the T/LH and FSH/LH ratios, consistent with subclinical hypogonadism. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of recent reports related to the potential effects of COVID-19 infection on the male reproductive system are based on poorly designed, small sample size studies that provide inconclusive, contradictory results. Since there still exists a theoretical possibility of testicular damage and male infertilty as a result of the infection by COVID-19, males of reproductive age should be evaluated for gonadal function and semen analysis. With regard to the sexual transmission of the virus, there is not sufficient evidence to recommend asymptomatic couples to abstein from having sex in order to protect themselves from being infected by the virus. Additional studies are needed to understand the long-term effects of SARS-CoV-2 on male reproductive function, including male fertility potential and endocrine testicular function.","José, Ferran García; González, Juan G Álvarez; Molina, Juan Manuel Corral; Arnau, Lluis Bassas; Iribarren, Ignacio Moncada; Jabaloyas, José Maria Martínez; Rico, Fernando Meijide; García-Baquero, Rodrigo; Gayá, Mariano Rosselló; García, Enrique Lledó; López, Carmen Luque; Castro, Rafael Prieto; Salamanca, Juan Ignacio Martinez",Rev Int Androl,430,1

Existing quarantine policies led to large-scale lock-downs because of the slow tracking of the infection paths, and indeed we see new waves of the disease. This can be solved by contact tracing combined with efficient testing policies. Since the number of daily tests is limited, it is crucial to exploit them efficiently to improve the outcome of contact tracing (technological or human-based epidemiological investigations). We develop a controlled testing framework to achieve this goal. The key is to test individuals with high probability of being infected to identify them before symptoms appear. These probabilities are updated based on contact tracing and test results. We demonstrate that the proposed method could reduce the quarantine and morbidity rates compared to existing methods by up to a 50%. The results clearly demonstrate the necessity of accelerating the epidemiological investigations by using technological contact tracing. Furthermore, proper use of the testing capacity using the proposed controlled testing methodology leads to significantly improved results under both small and large testing capacities. We also show that for small new outbreaks controlled testing can prevent the large spread of new waves.

DESIGN: Repeated cross-sectional survey. Between 17 July and 10 September 2020, mother-child pairs who were enrolled in a population-based survey in 2017 were re-contacted by telephone for consent and to complete a telephonic COVID-19 survey. We used the Brazilian Food Insecurity Scale to assess food security and the Self Reporting Questionnaire-20 to assess MMD. McNemar's test for paired data that also accounted for clustering was used. Logistic regression was used to assess the relationship of unemployment and receipt of government assistance with food insecurity and MMD in 2020. SETTING: Ceará, Brazil. PARTICIPANTS: Five hundred and seventy-seven mother-child pairs completed the 2017 and 2020 surveys. At the time of the 2020 interview, the child cohort was 36-108 months of age. RESULTS: The proportion of mothers reporting food insecurity was 15·5 % higher (95 % CI 5·9, 25·1, P value < 0·001) during the pandemic in July-August 2020 as compared with November 2017, while the prevalence of MMD was 40·2 % higher during the pandemic (95 % CI 32·6, 47·8, P value < 0·001). Loss of formal employment was associated with increased risk of food insecurity, but not with the risk of MMD.

Systematic analysis of lung cancer survivors at molecular and clinical levels is warranted to understand the disease course and clinical characteristics. Methods: A single-center, retrospective cohort study was conducted in 65 patients with COVID-19 from Wuhan Huoshenshan Hospital, of which 13 patients were diagnosed with lung cancer. The study was conducted from February 4 to April 11, 2020. Results: During the course of treatment, lung cancer survivors infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2) had shorter median time from symptom onset to hospitalization (P = 0.016) and longer clinical symptom remission time (P = 0.020) than non-cancer individuals. No differences were observed among indicators such as time from symptom onset to hospitalization and symptom remission time between medium-term and short-term survivors. The expression of ACE2 (P = 0.013) and TMPRSS2 (P &lt;0.001) was elevated in lung cancer survivors as compared with that in non-cancer individuals. Conclusions: ACE2 and TMPRSS2 levels were higher at resection margins of lung cancer survivors than those in normal tissues of non-cancerous individuals and may serve as factors responsible for the high susceptibility to COVID-19 among lung cancer survivors.

Social capital and a sense of social cohesion are known to have roles in buffering against the effects of adverse life circumstances. Our study sought to investigate the association of a range of social attitudes and activities - as proxies for social capital - with loneliness while taking into account socio-demographic factors. We undertook a national survey on a stratified random sample of the New Zealand (NZ) adult population aged 18+ in 2017 (n = 1,358), data from which included the requisite variables. The prevalence of loneliness was highest in young adults (18-30), falling with age until a slight rise in older people (76+). Loneliness was associated with socio-demographic factors, being more prevalent in the more disadvantaged groups: the deprived, Maori (the indigenous people of NZ), the non-partnered, and the less educated. Controlling for these socio-demographic factors, pro-social attitudes (that is towards political efficacy, trust in others, not feeling exploited, or being committed to family) and participation in social activities (that is being employed or being involved in recreation groups) - were protective against loneliness. Our study supports asset-based approaches to tackling loneliness - with implications for health and social care - that emphasise mobilising existing social resources, building social capital, and raising social cohesion in our communities. Such intervention on loneliness would help to prevent and ameliorate its detrimental consequences for public health.","Lay-Yee, Roy; Campbell, David; Milne, Barry",Heal. soc. care community,430,20

There is growing evidence of the reduction of stroke admissions and higher prevalence of severe clinical presentation. Yet, no studies have investigated the perfusion pattern of acute strokes admitted during the lockdown. We aimed to evaluate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on hyper-acute stroke CT perfusion (CTP) pattern during the first months of the pandemic in Italy. METHODS: In this retrospective observational study, we analyzed CTP images and clinical data of ischemic stroke patients admitted between 9 March and 2 June 2020 that underwent CTP (n = 30), to compare ischemic volumes and clinical features with stroke patients admitted during the same period in 2019 (n = 51). In particular, CTP images were processed to calculate total hypoperfused volumes, core volumes, and mismatch. The final infarct volumes were calculated on follow-up CT. RESULTS: Significantly higher total CTP hypoperfused volume (83.3 vs 18.5 ml, p = 0.003), core volume (27.8 vs 1.0 ml, p < 0.001), and unfavorable mismatch (0.51 vs 0.91, p < 0.001) were found during the COVID-19 period compared to no-COVID-19 one. The more unfavorable perfusion pattern at admission resulted in higher infarct volume on follow-up CT during COVID-19 (35.5 vs 3.0 ml, p < 0.001). During lockdown, a reduction of stroke admissions (- 37%) and a higher prevalence of severe clinical presentation (NIHSS &#8805; 10; 53% vs 36%, p = 0.029) were observed. CONCLUSION: The results of CTP analysis provided a better insight in the higher prevalence of major severity stroke patients during the COVID-19 period.","Furlanis, Giovanni; Ajcevic, Milos; Scali, Ilario; Buoite Stella, Alex; Olivo, Sasha; Lugnan, Carlo; Caruso, Paola; Pozzi Mucelli, Roberta Antea; Accardo, Agostino; Cova, Maria Assunta; Naccarato, Marcello; Manganotti, Paolo",Neuroradiology,430,25

METHODS: Consecutive patients meeting the inclusion criteria from 2010 to 2018 were identified. Patients were classified as confirmed, probable autoimmune, non-autoimmune, or unknown. RESULTS: One-hundred and nine patients were included, 64 (48.7 %) women, mean age 55.2 years (SD 17.9). ASS were reported by 61 patients (56 %), while 48 presented epilepsy (44 %). During follow-up 18 patients died (16.5 %). Final diagnosis was autoimmune-relatedepilepsy (confirmed + probable) in 22 cases and ASS secondary to autoimmune encephalitis (confirmed or probable) in 27, non-autoimmune aetiologies or other diagnosis in 49 (44 %), and unknown aetiology in 11 (10.2 %). Neuronal antibodies (ab) were found in 27 patients (24.7 %). T-lymphocyte infiltration in temporal lobes was observed in 2/8 patients (20 %). Neuronal ab were more frequent in the autoimmune groups: 17 patients (29.8 %) vs 1(2.3 %), p:0.001, and they suffered more autoimmune diseases: 37 (75.5 %) vs 12 (24.48 %), p:0.0001, and 34 (69 %) vs 22 (44.9 %) p:0.027, respectively. All patients with GAD ab 17/17 (100 %) evolved to chronic disease. Four patients (29 %) with ASS secondary to autoimmune encephalitis developed epilepsy. SIGNIFICANCE: ASS secondary to autoimmune encephalitis or autoimmune-related epilepsy will be diagnosed in nearly half of patients who have been suspected of it. The only diagnostic clue is neuronal ab.

The COVID-19 pandemic hindered dental education, as school buildings were closed. Online dental teaching provided an alternative teaching tool for dental education. However, the efficiency of online dental teaching and student preferences for online dental teaching are unclear. AIM: To investigate the satisfaction with online dental teaching practices among undergraduate dental students and standardized resident physician training students during the COVID-19 pandemic in China. METHODS: A total of 104 undergraduate dental students and 57 standardized resident physician training students from Zhejiang University participated in the study. A 12-item survey was conducted. This investigation included the teaching methods received, frequency of classes, degree of satisfaction, preferred teaching method, whether to participate in a course regarding COVID-19 prevention, and the effects of teaching. The percentages were then calculated and evaluated for each item. RESULTS: A total of 161 students (104 undergraduate dental students and 57 standardized resident physician training students) participated in this survey. All students had online dental classes during the COVID-19 pandemic. Lecture-based learning (LBL), case-based learning (CBL), problem-based learning (PBL), team-based learning (TBL), and research-based learning (RBL) were selected as teaching methods. Students were more satisfied with LBL and CBL than PBL, RBL, and TBL. The majority of students had more than four classes per week. The most selected protective measures were hand washing, wearing masks, and wearing gloves. A total of 46.6% of students participated in courses on COVID-19. After training, the students consciously chose to wear face shields and protective clothing. CONCLUSIONS: Dental students accepted online dental learning during the COVID-19 pandemic. Students preferred LBL and CBL and were satisfied with the classes. Courses on COVID-19 helped students understand how to prevent COVID-19 transmission in the dental clinic.","Jiang, Zhiwei; Zhu, Danji; Li, Jialu; Ren, Lingfei; Pu, Rui; Yang, Guoli",BMC Oral Health,430,12

The purpose of the present study was to explore the potential mental health impact of this forced quarantine and widespread shutdown among small business owners and the self-employed. A semi-structured interview was employed among 14 participants from three different cities in China. Grounded Theory was employed to analyze the data using Nvivo11 plus. Based on a qualitative analysis, 9 categories of responses emerged to describe the experience and actions of participants towards the quarantine: enjoyment of life, emotional disturbance, hope, comparisons to others, social support, patriotism, making changes, and obedience. Further analysis suggested that the mental state of participants was either positive or negative depending on enjoyment of life, loss, emotional disturbance, and hope, and that these were impacted by intervening conditions (national measures, social support, patriotism), personal strategies (exercising, studying, comparisons to others), and personal consequences (making change, obedience). Rather than observing a linear pattern of negative outcomes, mental state was found to be variable in that positive outcomes were experienced earlier in the quarantine (making connections with family), negative states were encountered midway through the quarantine (fear of financial loss, anxiety), and more positive mental states (hope) emerged towards the end of the quarantine depending on intervening conditions, personal strategies, and consequences. It can be concluded that the nature of the impact of mandatory quarantine in China among small business owners and the self-employed is complex and depends on a variety of personal and situational factors.","Wang, Wei; Huang, Wenjing; Liu, Xiaoxue; Hennessy, Dwight A",Curr Psychol,430,16

Moench) is a widely used medicinal and ornamental plant. In the present study, the callus embryogenesis was examined using benzyl adenine (BA) at three levels (3, 4, 5 mg L-1), 1-Naphthalene acetic acid (NAA) at three levels (0.1, 0.2 and 0.5 mg L-1) with or without activated charcoal (1 g L-1), coconut milk (50 ml L-1) and casein hydrolysate (50 mg L-1) in the MS (Murashige and Skoog 1962) medium. The embryogenesis indirectly occurred with the production of callus. The calli were observed in three forms: undifferentiated, embryogenic and organogenic. The embryogenic calli were dark green and coherent with a faster growth rate. The highest embryogenesis (100%) and embryonic regeneration (plantlet production) were obtained in the combined BA + NAA treatments with the activated charcoal, coconut milk and casein hydrolysate. However, the combined treatments of growth regulators failed to produce somatic embryos without the use of coconut milk and casein hydrolysate. The maximum amount of protein, peroxidase and catalase activity of embryogenic calli (2.02, 1.79 and 6.62&#916;OD/Min/mg.protein, respectively), and highest percentage of acclimatization success (29.3% of plants) were obtained in the combined treatment of 5 mg L-1 BA + 0.5 mg L-1 NAA + activated charcoal + coconut milk + casein hydrolysate. The highest amount of chlorophyll content (33.3 SPAD value) and growth characteristics of acclimatized plantlets were observed in the media containing 3 mg L-1 BA + 0.1 and 0.2 mg L-1 NAA + 1 g. L-1 combined activated charcoal, coconut milk, casein hydrolysate. The histological studies confirmed the somatic embryogenesis in purple coneflower.

METHODS: A retrospective analysis on daily viral positive tests and daily ED visits and hospitalizations between 01/01/2003 to 31/12/2013 in Ontario, Canada. Viral data was collected from the Centre for Immunization and Respiratory Infectious Diseases (CIRID). The Canadian Institute for Health Information reports daily ED visits and hospitalizations for RTIs, COPD and asthma as a primary diagnosis. RESULTS: There were 4,365,578 ED visits with RTIs of which 321,719 (7.4%) were admitted to hospital; 817,141 ED visits for COPD of which 260,665 (31.9%) were admitted and 649,666 ED visits with asthma of which 68,626 (10.6%) were admitted. The percentage of positive tests to influenza A and B, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza and adenovirus prevalence explained 57.4% of ED visits and 63.8% of hospitalizations for RTI, 41.4% of ED visits and 39.2% of hospitalizations with COPD but only 1.5% of ED visits and 2.7% of hospitalizations for asthma. The further addition of human metapneumovirus, rhinovirus and coronavirus over the final 3 years accounted for 66.7% of ED visits and 74.4% of hospitalizations for RTI, 52.5% of visits and 48.2% of hospitalizations for COPD, and only 13.3% of visits and 10.4% of hospitalizations for asthma. CONCLUSIONS: Community respiratory viral epidemics are major drivers of ED visits and hospitalizations with RTIs and COPD but only a modest contributor to asthma.","Satia, Imran; Cusack, Ruth; Greene, Justina M; O039,; Byrne, Paul M; Killian, Kieran J; Johnston, Neil",PLoS One,430,16

The lockdown effect on carbon emissions has been studied by many researchers using statistical approaches. However, the lockdown effect on atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) on an urban scale remains unclear. Here we present CO2 concentration and carbon isotopic (Î´13C) measurements to assess the impact of COVID-19 control measures on atmospheric CO2 in Xi'an, China. We find that CO2 concentrations during the lockdown period were 7.5% lower than during the normal period (prior to the Spring Festival, Jan 25 to Feb 4, 2020). The observed CO2excess (total CO2 minus background CO2) during the lockdown period was 52.3% lower than that during the normal period, and 35.7% lower than the estimated CO2excess with the effect of weather removed. A Keeling plot shows that in contrast CO2 concentrations and Î´13C were weakly correlated (R2 = 0.18) during the lockdown period, reflecting a change in CO2 sources imposed by the curtailment of traffic and industrial emissions. Our study also show that the sharp reduction in atmospheric CO2 during lockdown were short-lived, and returned to normal levels within months after lockdown measures were lifted.","Wu, Shugang; Zhou, Weijian; Xiong, Xiaohu; Burr, G S; Cheng, Peng; Wang, Peng; Niu, Zhenchuan; Hou, Yaoyao",Environ Res,430,16

METHODS: This cross-sectional internet-based survey included 1239 workers (mean age [standard deviation], 44.7 [13.7] years; 59.2% men) living in the Tokyo Metropolitan Area. Time spent sitting (SB), standing (light-intensity PA; LPA), walking, and engaging in heavy labor (moderate-to-vigorous PA; MVPA) during work time was measured using the Work-related Physical Activity Questionnaire. Workers reported weekly WFH percentages (eg, 0% implies no WFH and 100% implies full WFH), and WFH percentages were categorized into no WFH (0% WFH) and WFH (1%-100% WFH) groups. The WFH group was further subcategorized into 1%-25%, 26%-50%, 51%-75%, and 76%-100% subgroups. RESULTS: Overall, 494 workers (39.9%) worked from home. During working hours, SB time was longer in the WFH group than in the no WFH group (mean minutes [% working-time SB]: 335.7 vs 224.7 min [74% vs 50%]). Significantly shorter LPA and MVPA times (%) were reported in the WFH group than in the no WFH group (LPA, 59.6 vs 122.9 min [14% vs 29%]; MVPA, 55.3 vs 91.9 min [13% vs 22%], all P < .001). Among the WFH subgroups, longer SB time and shorter LPA and MVPA times were observed in the highest WFH group (WFH 76%-100%) than in the WFH 1%-25% and 26%-50% subgroups. CONCLUSIONS: Workers who telecommuted were less physically active and had longer sedentary during work time than those who worked at the workplaces.","Fukushima, Noritoshi; Machida, Masaki; Kikuchi, Hiroyuki; Amagasa, Shiho; Hayashi, Toshio; Odagiri, Yuko; Takamiya, Tomoko; Inoue, Shigeru",J Occup Health,430,5

To unravel the clinical heterogeneity of the SARS-CoV-2 infection in these patients, we designed the prospective observational Maastricht Intensive Care COVID cohort (MaastrICCht). We incorporated serial measurements that harbour aetiological, diagnostic and predictive information. The study aims to investigate the heterogeneity of the natural course of critically ill patients with a SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Mechanically ventilated patients admitted to the intensive care with a SARS-CoV-2 infection will be included. We will collect clinical variables, vital parameters, laboratory variables, mechanical ventilator settings, chest electrical impedance tomography, ECGs, echocardiography as well as other imaging modalities to assess heterogeneity of the course of a SARS-CoV-2 infection in critically ill patients. The MaastrICCht is also designed to foster various other studies and registries and intends to create an open-source database for investigators. Therefore, a major part of the data collection is aligned with an existing national intensive care data registry and two international COVID-19 data collection initiatives. Additionally, we create a flexible design, so that additional measures can be added during the ongoing study based on new knowledge obtained from the rapidly growing body of evidence. The spread of the COVID-19 pandemic requires the swift implementation of observational research to unravel heterogeneity of the natural course of the disease of SARS-CoV-2 infection in mechanically ventilated patients. Our study design is expected to enhance aetiological, diagnostic and prognostic understanding of the disease. This paper describes the design of the MaastrICCht. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval has been obtained from the medical ethics committee (Medisch Ethische Toetsingscommissie 2020-1565/3 00 523) of the Maastricht University Medical Centre+ (Maastricht UMC+), which will be performed based on the Declaration of Helsinki. During the pandemic, the board of directors of Maastricht UMC+ adopted a policy to inform patients and ask their consent to use the collected data and to store serum samples for COVID-19 research purposes. All study documentation will be stored securely for fifteen years after recruitment of the last patient. The results will be published in peer-reviewed academic journals, with a preference for open access journals, while particularly considering deposition of the manuscripts on a preprint server early.

BACKGROUND: Given the high incidence of coronavirus and shortage of nurses in Iranian hospitals, learning about nurses' intention to care for patients with COVID-19 is important. DESIGN: In this cross-sectional study, 648 Iranian nurses were surveyed during March 2020. The online questionnaire consisted of two parts. The mediating role was explored for the following: job satisfaction and commitment in the association of workload, quality of supervisor, extra-role behaviours, and pay satisfaction with the intention to care. The study adhered to STROBE checklist for cross-sectional studies. RESULTS: The results of this study show that job satisfaction and organisational commitment mediated the relationship of nurses' workload, quality of supervisor, extra-role behaviours, and pay satisfaction with the intention to care for patients with COVID-19. CONCLUSION: The results of the study indicate the importance of job satisfaction and organisational commitment as mechanisms that help to understand the association of nurses' workload, quality of supervisor, extra-role behaviours and pay satisfaction with the intention to care during the COVID-19 pandemic. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Hospital managers need to attend to the role of nurses' job satisfaction and other organisational factors to ensure that they can cope with the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Sharif Nia, Hamid; Arslan, Gökmen; Naghavi, Navaz; Sivarajan Froelicher, Erika; Kaveh, Omolhoda; Pahlevan Sharif, Saeed; Rahmatpour, Pardis",J Clin Nurs,430,21

The latest guidelines recommend hands-only cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and facemask use. However, public willingness in this setup remains unknown. METHODS: A cross-sectional, unrestricted volunteer Internet survey was conducted to assess individuals' attitudes and behaviors toward performing BCPR, pre-existing CPR training, occupational identity, age group, and gender. The raking method for weights and a regression analysis for the predictors of willingness were performed. RESULTS: Among 1,347 eligible respondents, 822 (61%) had negative attitudes toward performing BCPR. Healthcare providers (HCPs) and those with pre-existing CPR training had fewer negative attitudes (p < 0.001); HCPs and those with pre-existing CPR training and unchanged attitude showed more positive behaviors toward BCPR (p < 0.001). Further, 9.7% of the respondents would absolutely refuse to perform BCPR. In contrast, 16.9% would perform BCPR directly despite the outbreak. Approximately 9.9% would perform it if they were instructed, 23.5%, if they wore facemasks, and 40.1%, if they were to perform hands-only CPR. Interestingly, among the 822 respondents with negative attitudes, over 85% still tended to perform BCPR in the abovementioned situations. The weighted analysis showed similar results. The adjusted predictors for lower negative attitudes toward BCPR were younger age, being a man, and being an HCP; those for more positive behaviors were younger age and being an HCP. CONCLUSIONS: Outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases, such as COVID-19, have negative impacts on attitudes and behaviors toward BCPR. Younger individuals, men, HCPs, and those with pre-existing CPR training tended to show fewer negative attitudes and behaviors. Meanwhile, most individuals with negative attitudes still expressed positive behaviors under safer measures such as facemask protection, hands-only CPR, and available dispatch instructions.","Chong, Kah-Meng; Chen, Jiun-Wei; Lien, Wan-Ching; Yang, Mei-Fen; Wang, Hui-Chih; Liu, Sot Shih-Hung; Chen, Yen-Pin; Chi, Chien-Yu; Wu, Marvin Chih-Hsien; Wu, Cheng-Yi; Liao, Edward Che-Wei; Huang, Edward Pei-Chuan; He, Hsien-Chin; Yang, Hsiang-Wen; Huang, Chien-Hua; Ko, Patrick Chow-In",PLoS One,430,30

It appears that such preventive measures are critical to ""flattening the curve"" of the spread of COVID-19. The public's adoption of such behaviors is an essential component in the battle against what has been referred to as the ""invisible enemy."" OBJECTIVE: The primary objective of this study was to develop a model for predicting COVID-19 preventive behaviors among US college students. The Health Belief Model has a long history of use and empirical support in predicting preventive health behaviors, but it is not without its purported shortcomings. This study identifies a more optimal and defensible combination of variables to explain preventive behaviors among college students. This segment of the US population is critical in helping slow the spread of COVID-19 because of the relative reluctance of college students to perform the needed behaviors given they do not feel susceptible to or fearful of COVID-19. METHODS: For this study, 415 US college students were surveyed via Qualtrics and asked to answer questions regarding their fear of COVID-19, information receptivity (seeking relevant information), perceived knowledge of the disease, self-efficacy, and performance of preventive behaviors. The PROCESS macro (Model 6) was used to test our conceptual model, including predictions involving sequential mediation. RESULTS: Sequential mediation results show that fear of COVID-19 leads individuals to seek out information regarding the disease, which increases their perceived knowledge and fosters self-efficacy; this is key to driving preventive behaviors. CONCLUSIONS: Self-imposed preventive measures can drastically impact the rate of infection among populations. Based on this study's newly created sequential mediation model, communication strategies for encouraging COVID-19 preventive behaviors are offered. It is clear that college students, and very possibly adults of all ages, must have a healthy fear of COVID-19 to set in motion a process where concerned individuals seek out COVID-19-related information, increasing their store of knowledge concerning the disease, their self-efficacy, and ultimately their likelihood of performing the needed preventive behaviors.","Roberts, James A; David, Meredith E",J Med Internet Res,430,22

Soon after, increasing numbers of cases were detected in other parts of China, eventually leading to a disease outbreak in China. As this dreadful disease spreads rapidly, the mass media has been active in community education on COVID-19 by delivering health information about this novel coronavirus, such as its pathogenesis, spread, prevention, and containment. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to collect media reports on COVID-19 and investigate the patterns of media-directed health communications as well as the role of the media in this ongoing COVID-19 crisis in China. METHODS: We adopted the WiseSearch database to extract related news articles about the coronavirus from major press media between January 1, 2020, and February 20, 2020. We then sorted and analyzed the data using Python software and Python package Jieba. We sought a suitable topic number with evidence of the coherence number. We operated latent Dirichlet allocation topic modeling with a suitable topic number and generated corresponding keywords and topic names. We then divided these topics into different themes by plotting them into a 2D plane via multidimensional scaling. RESULTS: After removing duplications and irrelevant reports, our search identified 7791 relevant news reports. We listed the number of articles published per day. According to the coherence value, we chose 20 as the number of topics and generated the topics' themes and keywords. These topics were categorized into nine main primary themes based on the topic visualization figure. The top three most popular themes were prevention and control procedures, medical treatment and research, and global or local social and economic influences, accounting for 32.57% (n=2538), 16.08% (n=1258), and 11.79% (n=919) of the collected reports, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Topic modeling of news articles can produce useful information about the significance of mass media for early health communication. Comparing the number of articles for each day and the outbreak development, we noted that mass media news reports in China lagged behind the development of COVID-19. The major themes accounted for around half the content and tended to focus on the larger society rather than on individuals. The COVID-19 crisis has become a worldwide issue, and society has become concerned about donations and support as well as mental health among others. We recommend that future work addresses the mass media's actual impact on readers during the COVID-19 crisis through sentiment analysis of news data.","Liu, Qian; Zheng, Zequan; Zheng, Jiabin; Chen, Qiuyi; Liu, Guan; Chen, Sihan; Chu, Bojia; Zhu, Hongyu; Akinwunmi, Babatunde; Huang, Jian; Zhang, Casper J P; Ming, Wai-Kit",J Med Internet Res,430,28

Despite the prevalence of COVID-19 pandemic and ongoing research, the nature of the antibody response against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is unclear. Here we longitudinally profile the early humoral immune response against SARS-CoV-2 in hospitalized coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients and quantify levels of pre-existing immunity to OC43, HKU1 and 229E seasonal coronaviruses, and find a strong back-boosting effect to conserved but not variable regions of OC43 and HKU1 betacoronaviruses spike protein. However, such antibody memory boost to human coronaviruses negatively correlates with the induction of IgG and IgM against SARS-CoV-2 spike and nucleocapsid protein. Our findings thus provide evidence of immunological imprinting by previous seasonal coronavirus infections that can potentially modulate the antibody profile to SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Aydillo, Teresa; Rombauts, Alexander; Stadlbauer, Daniel; Aslam, Sadaf; Abelenda-Alonso, Gabriela; Escalera, Alba; Amanat, Fatima; Jiang, Kaijun; Krammer, Florian; Carratala, Jordi; García-Sastre, Adolfo",Nat Commun,430,16

The complete national lockdown that was implemented in Peru produced statistically significant reductions in the in-air pollutant (PM10 (-40% and -58%), PM2.5 (-31% and -43%) and NO2 (-46% and -48%)), as recorded by the by the ground-based air quality monitoring network throughout the metropolitan area, compared with the corresponding concentrations for the previous weeks and over the same period for 2017-2019.

RECENT FINDINGS: Evidence to date does not suggest that people living with HIV (PLWH) have a markedly higher susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection, with disparities in the social determinants of health and comorbidities likely having a greater influence. The majority of literature has not supported a higher risk for severe disease among PLWH in Europe and the United States, although a large, population-based study in South Africa reported a higher rate of death due to COVID-19. Higher rates of comorbidities associated with COVID-19 disease severity among PLWH is an urgent concern. COVID-19 is leading to decreased access to HIV prevention services and HIV testing, and worsening HIV treatment access and virologic suppression, which could lead to worsening HIV epidemic control. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 is threatening gains against the HIV epidemic, including the U.S. Ending the HIV Epidemic goals. The ongoing collision of these two global pandemics will continue to need both study and interventions to mitigate the effects of COVID-19 on HIV efforts worldwide.","Brown, Lillian B; Spinelli, Matthew A; Gandhi, Monica",Curr Opin HIV AIDS,430,1

Main concern was to prevent overwhelming of the healthcare systems, mainly of the intensive care units (ICUs) by decreasing the spreading of the disease. In Greece, the Government, after consulting with experts in the fields of infectious disease and epidemiology, implemented a rather aggressive stance with an early lockdown. Aim of our study, is to identify and compare the characteristics of cases referred for autopsy during the first month of the lockdown period for the COVID-19 outbreak, versus the cases referred during the same period in 2019. 231 autopsy cases were included in our study, 125 in 2019 and 106 in 2020. Regarding gender, age and nationality, no significant differences were detected between the two time periods. Age subgroup analysis demonstrated increased number of cases within the age group 70-79 years, in 2020. As to the place of death, the increase in the percentage of out-of-hospital deaths was not confirmed as statistically significant. Regarding type of death (violent, sudden/unexpected), the drop of violent deaths in the 2020 examined period, was not confirmed as statistically significant; however, further subgroup analysis showed a significant drop of fatal injuries resulting from road traffic accidents in the 2020 period. The slight increase of sudden/unexpected deaths, especially myocardial infarction cases, did not reach statistical significance. One month after lockdown, we cannot detect significant differences in the two time periods examined. Further study should be conducted soon when more data will become available. Frequency of fatal myocardial infarction seems to remain unaffected by the COVID-19 pandemic while deaths resulting from road traffic accidents exhibit a significant decrease. Homicides and suicides remain at low levels, in our jurisdiction area, seemingly unaffected by the COVID-19 outbreak and the subsequent lockdown. It appears that since sudden/unexpected deaths, statistically remain unaffected, the preventive measures taken by the Greek authorities prevented overwhelming of the healthcare system, which could function properly.","Sakelliadis, Emmanouil I; Katsos, Konstantinos D; Zouzia, Evmorfili I; Spiliopoulou, Chara A; Tsiodras, Sotirios",Forensic Sci Int,430,26

SARS-CoV-2 translates its own proteins by using the host tRNAs, so that its GC or codon usage should fit that of the host cells. It is necessary to study both the virus and human genomes in the light of evolution and adaptation. The SARS-CoV-2 virus has significantly lower GC content and GC3 as compared to human. However, when we selected a set of human genes that have similar GC properties to SARS-CoV-2, we found that these genes were enriched in particular pathways. Moreover, these human genes have the codon composition perfectly correlated with the SARS-CoV-2, and were extraordinarily highly expressed in human lung tissues, demonstrating that the SARS-CoV-2 genes have similar GC usage as compared to the lung expressed human genes. RSCU (relative synonymous codon usage) and CAI (codon adaptation index) profiles further support the matching between SARS-CoV-2 and lungs. Our study indicates that SARS-CoV-2 might have adapted to the human lung environment by observing the high correlation between GC usage of SARS-CoV-2 and human lung genes, which suggests the GC content of SARS-CoV-2 is optimized to take advantage of human lung tissues.","Li, Yue; Yang, Xinai; Wang, Na; Wang, Haiyan; Yin, Bin; Yang, Xiaoping; Jiang, Wenqing",Mol. genet. genomics,430,1

Aim of this study was to videopolysomnographically evaluate sleep and sleep disorders after SARS-Cov2 infection. METHODS: Patients with suspected sleep disorders after acute COVID-19 underwent video-polysomnography (v-PSG) at the Sleep Disorders Clinic, Department of Neurology, Medical University Innsbruck. V-PSG was conducted 4.2 (SD = 1.3) months after diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS: Eleven patients [nine men, age 52.5 (SD = 11.7) years; BMI 29 (SD = 5.2) kg/m2] were included. At 60 days follow-up after diagnosis, persisting breathing complaints were present in 7/11 (64%) patients. After v-PSG four patients (36%) were diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Respiratory frequency during sleep was normal and no tachypnea, thoracoabdominal asynchrony, or periodic deep sighing were detected. Four patients (36%) showed REM sleep without atonia (RWA), and two additional patients showed an RWA index within the highest range of normality. CONCLUSION: We report videopolysomnographic findings in a series of eleven patients after acute COVID-19. A major finding of this study was the presence of isolated RWA, a recognized prodromal stage of RBD, in more than one third of the patients. Future videopolysomnographic investigations including quantification of RWA in patients after COVID-19 will give more insights into a possible acute or post-infectious CNS pathology related to the SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Heidbreder, Anna; Sonnweber, Thomas; Stefani, Ambra; Ibrahim, Abubaker; Cesari, Matteo; Bergmann, Melanie; Brandauer, Elisabeth; Tancevski, Ivan; Löffler-Ragg, Judith; Högl, Birgit",Sleep Med,430,32

We assessed the prevalence and determinants of tobacco use among undergraduate women students of the University of Delhi with special emphasis on hookah use. Methods.: Using an anonymous self-administered questionnaire, we conducted a survey among the undergraduate women students of four colleges of the University of Delhi during March 2016. The tool was adapted from standard global surveys and had specific sections on tobacco use and patterns-use of shisha (hookah), smokeless tobacco as well as cessation and exposure to media and awareness about the harmful health effects of tobacco use. Point estimates along with 95% confidence intervals were estimated. Multivariate logistic regression was done to identify the determinants of current tobacco use and hookah use. Results.: Of the 780 respondents (mean [SD] age 19.3 [1.08] years), 22.9% (20.1-26.0) used tobacco in any form, with hookah being the most prevalent form (20.3%). One-third of the respondents believed that hookah smoking was less harmful than cigarette smoking. The major determinants of hookah use were-attending a private school (1.84; 1.11-3.01) or all-women college (2.79; 1.80-4.33); tobacco use by friends (2.47; 1.61-3.77); belief that smoking is a sign of women empowerment (2.09; 1.05-4.1 7) and the belief that hookah smoking is less harmful than cigarette smoking (2.81; 1.92-4.13).

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is the most common sleep-associated breathing disease and is represented by repetitive experiences of constraint of the respiratory tract prompting to reduced or deficient breathing during sleep. Auto-Continuous positive airway pressure (Auto-CPAP) is a modality of respiratory ventilation used as gold standart in the treatment of OSA. OBJECTIVE: This study was performed to conclude the alteration of Auto-CPAP levels in OSA patients who had COVID-19 history. METHODS: Nineteen OSA patients who had cured COVID-19 and used Auto-CPAP were included in this study. Nightly Auto-CPAP 95th percentile pressure (95thpp), median CPAP pressure and AHI before COVID-19 disease and one month after COVID therapy were recorded from electronic cards of Auto-CPAP devices. RESULTS: Before COVID infection, average Auto-CPAP 95thpp was 8.56 ± 0.17 cm H2O. One month after COVID-19, average Auto-CPAP 95thpp was 9.78 ± 0.21 cm H2O (P < 0.01). While Median CPAP pressure was 7.49 ± 0.16 cm H2O before COVID, it was found to be 8.15 ± 0.19 cm H2O after the disease (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The increase in need of average Auto-CPAP 95thpp and median CPAP pressure in OSA patients who have had COVID-19 disease and use Auto-CPAP shows that this disease causes problems in both the lower and upper airways.","Fidan, Vural; Koyuncu, Handan; Akin, Okan",Am J Otolaryngol,430,1

Using a measles virus (rMeV) vaccine strain as the backbone, we developed a series of recombinant attenuated vaccine candidates expressing various forms of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein and its receptor binding domain (RBD) and evaluated their efficacy in cotton rat, IFNAR-/-mice, IFNAR-/--hCD46 mice, and golden Syrian hamsters. We found that rMeV expressing stabilized prefusion S protein (rMeV-preS) was more potent in inducing SARS-CoV-2-specific neutralizing antibodies than rMeV expressing full-length S protein (rMeV-S), while the rMeVs expressing different lengths of RBD (rMeV-RBD) were the least potent. Animals immunized with rMeV-preS produced higher levels of neutralizing antibody than found in convalescent sera from COVID-19 patients and a strong Th1-biased T cell response. The rMeV-preS also provided complete protection of hamsters from challenge with SARS-CoV-2, preventing replication in lungs and nasal turbinates, body weight loss, cytokine storm, and lung pathology. These data demonstrate that rMeV-preS is a safe and highly efficacious vaccine candidate, supporting its further development as a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine.","Lu, Mijia; Dravid, Piyush; Zhang, Yuexiu; Trivedi, Sheetal; Li, Anzhong; Harder, Olivia; Kc, Mahesh; Chaiwatpongsakorn, Supranee; Zani, Ashley; Kenney, Adam; Zeng, Cong; Cai, Chuanxi; Ye, Chengjin; Liang, Xueya; Shimamura, Masako; Liu, Shan-Lu; Mejias, Asuncion; Ramilo, Octavio; Boyaka, Prosper N; Qiu, Jianming; Martinez-Sobrido, Luis; Yount, Jacob S; Peeples, Mark E; Kapoor, Amit; Niewiesk, Stefan; Li, Jianrong",Proc.

In addition to the development of an effective vaccine, it is imperative to understand how SARS-CoV-2 hijacks host cellular machineries on a system-wide scale so that potential host-directed therapies can be developed. In situ proteome-wide abundance and thermal stability measurements using thermal proteome profiling (TPP) can inform on global changes in protein activity. Here we adapted TPP to high biosafety conditions amenable to SARS-CoV-2 handling. We discovered pronounced temporal alterations in host protein thermostability during infection, which converged on cellular processes including cell cycle, microtubule and RNA splicing regulation. Pharmacological inhibition of host proteins displaying altered thermal stability or abundance during infection suppressed SARS-CoV-2 replication. Overall, this work serves as a framework for expanding TPP workflows to globally important human pathogens that require high biosafety containment and provides deeper resolution into the molecular changes induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Selkrig, Joel; Stanifer, Megan; Mateus, André; Mitosch, Karin; Barrio-Hernandez, Inigo; Rettel, Mandy; Kim, Heeyoung; Voogdt, Carlos G P; Walch, Philipp; Kee, Carmon; Kurzawa, Nils; Stein, Frank; Potel, Clément; Jarzab, Anna; Kuster, Bernhard; Bartenschlager, Ralf; Boulant, Steeve; Beltrao, Pedro; Typas, Athanasios; Savitski, Mikhail M",Mol Syst Biol,430,1

This study aimed to describe the clinical outcomes and risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection in HCW. METHODS: Three databases were surveyed and 328 articles were identified. Of these, 225 articles did not meet inclusion criteria; therefore, 97 full-text article were reviewed. Finally, after further revision, 30 articles were included in the systematic review and 28 were used for meta-analysis. RESULTS: Twenty-eight studies were identified involving 119,883 patients. The mean age of the patients was 38.37 years (95% CI 36.72-40.03) and males comprised 21.4% (95% CI 12.4-34.2) of the population of HCW. The percentage of HCW who tested positive for COVID-19 was 51.7% (95% CI 34.7-68.2). The total prevalence of comorbidities in seven studies was 18.4% (95% CI 15.5-21.7). The most prevalent symptoms were fever 27.5% (95% CI 17.6-40.3) and cough 26.1% (95% CI 18.1-36).

Methods: Cross-sectional evaluation of subjects with SARS-CoV-2 at Indiana University Health. We performed two separate analyses, first evaluating likelihood of COVID-19 diagnosis by race (Caucasian, African American, Asian, or other) and ethnicity (Hispanic vs. non-Hispanic) in the cohort encompassing the entire state of Indiana. Subsequently, patient data was geolocated with zip codes in Marion County and the immediate surrounding counties, and descriptive statistical analyses were used to calculate the number of COVID-19 cases per 10,000 persons for each of these zip codes. Results: Indiana had a total of 3,892 positive COVID-19 cases from January 1 to April 30, 2020. The odds of testing positive for COVID-19 were four-fold higher in African Americans than non-African Americans (OR 4.58, 95% CI 4.25-4.94, P < 0.0001).

Ambient PM-bound SARS-CoV-2 was analyzed quantitatively and the air concentrations of the virus ranged from 0.1 copies/m3 to 23 copies/m3. The highest percentages of virus detection on PM samples were from hospital gardens in Tekirdag, Zonguldak, and Istanbul, especially in PM2.5 mode. Findings of this study have suggested that SARS-CoV-2 may be transported by ambient particles, especially at sites close to the infection hot-spots.

Background: Air-powered costumes use a small motor to create positive pressure within the costume. This mechanism is similar to Powered Air Purifying Respirator (PAPR).1 However, unlike a PAPR the air-powered costume does not filter the incoming air through a HEPA filter. Nor does it capture the air inside a contained space and filter it before it is released into the environment. The affect is that droplets from the person in the costume or from air that is drawn into the costume, which would normally be too heavy to travel farther than 6 feet, are aerosolized by traveling through the turbulent blower. These small particles can easily penetrate the thin fabric that makes the costume. This creates an infection control problem by aerosolizing the particles and then propelling them with the force of positive pressure."" Case Description: In January of 2021, a Covid-19 outbreak in San Jose, CA, was contact traced back to a surprising source. On Christmas day, a worker wishing to lift spirits, unknowingly spread Covid-19 via an air-powered Christmas tree costume. The worker did not have symptoms of SARS-COV-2 and did not know they were infected. The result is tragic. In San Jose, at least 60 people were infected, and one person died."" Conclusion: This case manifests a tragic outcome to what was meant to be a benevolent action. All evidence points to lack of information guiding this well-intentioned action. What was meant to decrease the stress and burden of the pandemic, became a greater stress and burden. Tragically with a loss of life and unknown morbidity. Further, there is the potential for a psychologic toll on the person who thought they were helping others, only to learn that they had harmed them. Given that these costumes in hospitals are rare, further tragedies such as this one should be preventable. Covid-19 is not the only pathogen that could theoretically be spread by this mechanism. Hospital should have a policy that restricts the use of these costumes. Education about the danger of these costumes should be provided to staff. Given that personal may act by finding replacement, risk management and infection control should create an adequate policy to address the mental health needs of staff and patients, while maintain appropriate infection control. Now that there is documentation of this methods of pathogenic spread, hospitals may face liability if they fail to establish a reasonable policy and education regarding turbulent flow air-powered costumes.","Diekman, Sarah J.

The antimicrobial efficacy of cleaning procedures can be considered particularly important for young, old, pregnant, immunocompromised people, but may also concern other groups, particularly with regards to the COVID-19 pandemics. This study aimed to show that acetic acid exhibit an antibacterial and antifungal activity when used for cleaning purposes and is able to destroy certain viruses. Furthermore, a disinfecting effect of laundry in a simulated washing cycle has been investigated. RESULTS: At a concentration of 10% and in presence of 1.5% citric acid, acetic acid showed a reduction of > 5-log steps according to the specifications of DIN EN 1040 and DIN EN 1275 for the following microorganisms: P. aeruginosa, E. coli, S. aureus, L. monocytogenes, K. pneumoniae, E. hirae and A. brasiliensis. For MRSA a logarithmic reduction of 3.19 was obtained. Tests on surfaces according to DIN EN 13697 showed a complete reduction (> 5-log steps) for P. aeruginosa, E. coli, S. aureus, E. hirae, A. brasiliensis and C. albicans at an acetic acid concentration of already 5%. Virucidal efficacy tests according to DIN EN 14476 and DIN EN 16777 showed a reduction of &#8805;4-log-steps against the Modified Vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) for acetic acid concentrations of 5% or higher. The results suggest that acetic acid does not have a disinfecting effect on microorganisms in a dosage that is commonly used for cleaning. However, this can be achieved by increasing the concentration of acetic acid used, especially when combined with citric acid. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show a disinfecting effect of acetic acid in a concentration of 10% and in presence of 1.5% citric acid against a variety of microorganisms. A virucidal effect against enveloped viruses could also be proven. Furthermore, the results showed a considerable antimicrobial effect of acetic acid when used in domestic laundry procedures.","Zinn, Marc-Kevin; Bockmühl, Dirk",BMC Microbiol,430,10

This article analyses 3,038,026 English tweets about COVID-19 from March 10 to 23, 2020. It focuses on one relevant aspect of public reaction: gender differences. The results show that females are more likely to tweet about the virus in the context of family, social distancing and healthcare whereas males are more likely to tweet about sports cancellations, the global spread of the virus and political reactions. Thus, women seem to be taking a disproportionate share of the responsibility for directly keeping the population safe. The detailed results may be useful to inform public information announcements and to help understand the spread of the virus.

Improvements to the analysis of EEG and GSR data may create models that perform as well, or better than, traditional tools. A challenge to analyzing the EEG and GSR data is the large amount of training data required due to a large number of variables in the measurements. Researchers have routinely used standard machine-learning classifiers like artificial neural networks (ANN), support vector machines (SVM), and K-nearest neighbors (KNN). Traditionally, these have provided few insights into which features of the EEG and GSR data facilitate the more and least accurate predictions - thus making it harder to improve the HMI and human-machine trust relationship. A key ingredient to applying trust-sensor research results to practical situations and monitoring trust in work environments is the understanding of which key features are contributing to trust and then reducing the amount of data needed for practical applications. We used the Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) model as a process to reduce the volume of data required to monitor and enhance trust in HMI systems - a technology that could be valuable for governmental and public sector applications. Explainable AI can make HMI systems transparent and promote trust. From customer service in government agencies and community-level non-profit public service organizations to national military and cybersecurity institutions, many public sector organizations are increasingly concerned to have effective and ethical HMI with services that are trustworthy, unbiased, and free of unintended negative consequences.","Faruqe, Farhana; Watkins, Ryan; Medsker, Larry",,430,5

As the supply of mass-produced masks has decreased, the use of homemade masks has become more prevalent. It is important to quantify the effectiveness of different types of materials to provide useful information, which should be considered for homemade masks. METHODS: Filtration effects of different types of common materials were studied by measuring the aerosol droplet concentrations in the upstream and downstream regions. Flow-field characteristics of surrounding regions of tested materials were investigated using a laser-diagnostics technique, i.e., particle image velocimetry. The pressure difference across the tested materials was measured. RESULTS: Measured aerosol concentrations indicated a breakup of large-size particles into smaller particles. Tested materials had higher filtration efficiency for large particles. Single-layer materials were less efficient, but they had a low pressure-drop. Multilayer materials could produce greater filtering efficiency with an increased pressure drop, which is an indicator of comfort level and breathability. The obtained flow-fields indicated a flow disruption downstream of the tested materials as the velocity magnitude noticeably decreased. CONCLUSIONS: The obtained results provide an insight into flow-field characteristics and filtration efficiency of different types of household materials commonly used for homemade masks. This study allows comparison with mass-produced masks under consistent test conditions while employing several well-established techniques.","Maher, Blake; Chavez, Reynaldo; Tomaz, Gabriel C Q; Nguyen, Thien; Hassan, Yassin",Int J Infect Dis,430,9

489848,489848,489848,Critical community size for COVID-19 -- a model based approach to provide a rationale behind the lockdown,15.119531,5.0365,2020-04-07,"Background: Many countries worldwide are faced with the choice between the (re)surgence of COVID-19 and endangering the economic and mental well-being of their citizens. While infection numbers are monitored and measures adjusted, a systematic strategy for balancing contact restrictions and socioeconomic life in the absence of a vaccine is currently lacking. Methods: In a mathematical model, we determine the efficacy of regional containment strategies, where contact restrictions are triggered locally in individual regions upon crossing critical infection number thresholds. Our stochastic meta-population model distinguishes between contacts within a region and cross-regional contacts. We use current data on the spread of COVID-19 in Germany, Italy, England, New York State and Florida, including the effects of their individual national lockdowns, and county population sizes obtained from census data to define individual regions. As a performance measure, we determine the number of days citizens will experience contact restrictions over the next 5 years ('restriction time') and compare it to an equivalent national lockdown strategy. To extract crucial parameters, we vary the proportion of cross-regional contacts (between 0% and 100%), the thresholds for initiating local measures (between 5 and 20 active infections per 100,000 inhabitants) as well as their duration after infection numbers have returned below the threshold (between 7 and 28 days). We compare performance across the five different countries and test how further subdivision of large counties into independently controlled regions of up to 100,000 or 200,000 inhabitants affects the results. Findings: Our numerical simulations show a substantially reduced restriction time for regional containment, if the effective reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2 without restrictions, R 0, is only slightly larger than 1 and the proportion of cross-regional contacts (the so-called leakiness) is low. In Germany, specifically, for R 0=1.14, a leakiness of 1% is sufficiently low to reduce the mean restriction time from 468 days (s.d. 3 days) for the national containment strategy to 43 days (s.d. 3 days across simulations) for the regional strategy, when local measures are initiated at 10 infections per 100,000 inhabitants in the past 7 days. For R 0=1.28, the allowed leakiness for minimal restriction time reduces to approximately 0.3%. The dependence of the restriction time on the leakiness is threshold-like only for regional containment, due to cooperative effects. It rises to levels similar to the national containment strategy for a leakiness > 10% (517 days national vs. 486 days regional for leakiness 32% and R 0=1.14). We find a strong correlation between the population size of each region and the experienced restriction time. For countries with large counties, this can result in only a mild reduction in restriction time for regional containment, which can only be partly compensated by lower thresholds for initiating local measures and increasing their duration. In contrast, further subdividing large counties into smaller units can ensure a strong reduction of the restriction time for the regional strategy. Interpretation: The leakiness, i.e. the proportion of cross-regional contacts, and the regional structure itself were crucial parameters for the performance of the regional strategy. Therefore, regional strategies could offer an adaptive way to contain the epidemic with fewer overall restrictions, if cross-regional infections can be kept below the critical level, which could be achieved without affecting local socioeconomic freedom. Maintaining general hygiene and contact tracing, testing should be intensified to ensure regional measures can be initiated at low infection thresholds, preventing the spread of the disease to other regions before local elimination. While such tight control could lead to more restrictions in the short run, restrictions necessary for long-term containment could be reduced by up to a factor of 10. Our open-source simulation code is freely available and can be readily adapted to other countries.

So it is not surprising that several cases have been described during the actual SARS-CoV-2 infection pandemic. Most of the descriptions are patients suffering a severe GBS in the setting of a severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. We described five patients with mild forms of COVID-19. After 2-4 weeks, these patients develop mild neurological symptoms. The clinical and neurophysiological studies supported a diagnosis of an acute polyneuropathy. Symptoms resolved without specific treatment and primary care physicians managed all patients outpatiently. Mild SARS-CoV-2 infection could associate mild neurological complications too. So patients complaining about mild neurological symptoms, a SARS-CoV-2 infection may be excluded.

As a result, post-lockdown COVID-19 dynamics are heterogeneous and difficult to interpret. We describe a set of contact surveys performed in four Chinese cities (Wuhan, Shanghai, Shenzhen, and Changsha) during the pre-pandemic, lockdown and post-lockdown periods to quantify changes in contact patterns. In the post-lockdown period, the mean number of contacts increased by 5 to 17% as compared to the lockdown period. However, it remains three to seven times lower than its pre-pandemic level sufficient to control SARS-CoV-2 transmission. We find that the impact of school interventions depends nonlinearly on the intensity of other activities. When most community activities are halted, school closure leads to a 77% decrease in the reproduction number; in contrast, when social mixing outside of schools is at pre-pandemic level, school closure leads to a 5% reduction in transmission.","Zhang, Juanjuan; Litvinova, Maria; Liang, Yuxia; Zheng, Wen; Shi, Huilin; Vespignani, Alessandro; Viboud, Cecile; Ajelli, Marco; Yu, Hongjie",Sci.

OBJECTIVE: We examined the parameters of activation of different leukocyte subsets in COVID-19-infected patients in relation to disease severity. METHODS: We analyzed plasma levels of myeloperoxidase (a marker of neutrophil activation), soluble (s) CD25 (sCD25) and soluble T-cell immunoglobulin mucin domain-3 (sTIM-3) (markers of T-cell activation and exhaustion), and sCD14 and sCD163 (markers of monocyte/macrophage activation) in 39 COVID-19-infected patients at hospital admission and 2 additional times during the first 10 days in relation to their need for intensive care unit (ICU) treatment. RESULTS: Our major findings were as follows: (1) severe clinical outcome (ICU treatment) was associated with high plasma levels of sTIM-3 and myeloperoxidase, suggesting activated and potentially exhausted T cells and activated neutrophils, respectively; (2) in contrast, sCD14 and sCD163 showed no association with need for ICU treatment; and (3) levels of sCD25, sTIM-3, and myeloperoxidase were inversely correlated with degree of respiratory failure, as assessed by the ratio of Pao2 to fraction of inspired oxygen, and were positively correlated with the cardiac marker N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that neutrophil activation and, in particular, activated T cells may play an important role in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 infection, suggesting that T-cell-targeted treatment options and downregulation of neutrophil activation could be of importance in this disorder.","Ueland, Thor; Heggelund, Lars; Lind, Andreas; Holten, Aleksander R; Tonby, Kristian; Michelsen, Annika E; Jenum, Synne; Jørgensen, Marthe J; Barratt-Due, Andreas; Skeie, Linda G; Nordøy, Ingvild; Aanensen Fraz, Mai Sasaki; Quist-Paulsen E, Else; Pischke, Søren E; Johal, Simreen K; Hesstvedt, Liv; Bogen, Mette; Fevang, Børre; Halvorsen, Bente; Müller, Fredrik; Bekken, Gry Kloumann; Mollnes, Tom E; Dudman, Susanne; Aukrust, Pål; Dyrhol-Riise, Anne M; Holter, Jan C",J. allergy clin. immunol,430,16

Our study showed that protein corona formation is governed by protein-surface and protein-protein interactions, as well as the surface hydrophobic effect. The corona structure was found to be dependent on protein types and the size of nanoparticles. Ovispirin proteins form homogeneous single-layered adsorption in comparison with the lysozyme's inhomogeneous multilayered aggregates on gold NP surfaces. The decrease in nanoparticle size leads to more angular degrees of freedom for protein adsorption orientation. Subsequent atomistic molecular dynamics simulations further demonstrate the loss of secondary structure of ovispirin upon adsorption and the heterogeneity of its local structure.","Jahan Sajib, Md Symon; Sarker, Pranab; Wei, Yong; Tao, Xiuping; Wei, Tao",Langmuir,430,16

A critical element involves essential workforce management since current protocols recommend release from duty for symptomatic individuals, including essential personnel. Testing capacity is also problematic in several countries, where diagnosis demand outnumbers available local testing capacity. Purpose: This work describes a machine learning model derived from hemogram exam data performed in symptomatic patients and how they can be used to predict qRT-PCR test results. Methods: Hemogram exams data from 510 symptomatic patients (73 positives and 437 negatives) were used to model and predict qRT-PCR results through Naïve-Bayes algorithms. Different scarcity scenarios were simulated, including symptomatic essential workforce management and absence of diagnostic tests. Adjusts in assumed prior probabilities allow fine-tuning of the model, according to actual prediction context. Results: Proposed models can predict COVID-19 qRT-PCR results in symptomatic individuals with high accuracy, sensitivity and specificity, yielding a 100% sensitivity and 22.6% specificity with a prior of 0.9999; 76.7% for both sensitivity and specificity with a prior of 0.2933; and 0% sensitivity and 100% specificity with a prior of 0.001. Regarding background scarcity context, resources allocation can be significantly improved when model-based patient selection is observed, compared to random choice. Conclusions: Machine learning models can be derived from widely available, quick, and inexpensive exam data in order to predict qRT-PCR results used in COVID-19 diagnosis. These models can be used to assist strategic decision-making in resource scarcity scenarios, including personnel shortage, lack of medical resources, and testing insufficiency.","Avila, Eduardo; Kahmann, Alessandro; Alho, Clarice; Dorn, Marcio",PeerJ,430,26

During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, in Italy the population was forced into a lockdown. With this study, we aimed to describe the lockdown impact on NT1 symptom management, according to different patients' working schedule. METHODS: In the period between 10 April and 15 May 2020, we performed routine follow-up visits by telephone (as recommended during the COVID-19 emergency) to 50 patients >18 years old (40% males) under stable long-term treatment. We divided patients into three groups: unchanged working schedule, forced working/studying at home, and those who lost their job (""lost occupation""). Current sleep-wake habit and symptom severity were compared with prelockdown assessment (six months before) in the three patient groups. RESULTS: At assessment, 20, 22, and eight patients belonged to the unchanged, working/studying at home, and lost occupation groups, respectively. While in the lost occupation group, there were no significant differences compared with prepandemic assessment, the patients with unchanged schedules reported more nocturnal awakenings, and NT1 patients working/studying at home showed an extension of nocturnal sleep time, more frequent daytime napping, improvement of daytime sleepiness, and a significant increase in their body mass index. Sleep-related paralysis/hallucinations, automatic behaviors, cataplexy, and disturbed nocturnal sleep did not differ. CONCLUSIONS: Narcolepsy type 1 patients working/studying at home intensified behavioral interventions (increased nocturnal sleep time and daytime napping) and ameliorated daytime sleepiness despite presenting with a slight, but significant, increase of weight.","Postiglione, Emanuela; Pizza, Fabio; Ingravallo, Francesca; Vignatelli, Luca; Filardi, Marco; Mangiaruga, Anastasia; Antelmi, Elena; Moresco, Monica; Oriolo, Claudia; Pagotto, Uberto; Plazzi, Giuseppe",Brain Behav,430,16

The presence of angiotensin converting enzyme-2 receptors in the intestinal enterocytes, the receptors primarily involved in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 pneumonia, maybe the key factor contributing to the pathogenesis of GI manifestations. Ischemic colitis, although the most common ischemic pathology of the GI tract, is relatively rare, occurring as a result of colonic hypoperfusion. The innumerable causes of colonic ischemia are categorized into occlusive and nonocclusive pathologies. Here, we have discussed a case of severe COVID-19 pneumonia, developing ischemic colitis, as a rare GI complication. The cause of ischemia in COVID-19 pneumonia is multifactorial, including hypercoagulable state, coagulopathy leading to thromboembolic complications, and use of vasopressors in severely ill patients with hemodynamic compromise.","Paul, Theresa; Joy, Antony Raphel; Alsoub, Hussam Abdel Rahman S; Parambil, Jessiya Veliyankodan",Am. j. trop. med. hyg,430,16

BACKGROUND: School closures and homeworking during the Covid-19 crisis have resulted in an immediate increase in unpaid care work, which draws new attention to gender inequality in divisions of unpaid care work. METHODS: Data come from the wave 9 (2017-19) of Understanding Society and the following April (n = 15,426) and May (n = 14,150) waves of Understanding Society Covid-19 study. Psychological distress was measured using the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ) at both before and during the lockdown, and unpaid care work was measured during the lockdown. Linear regression models were used. RESULTS: Women spent much more time on unpaid care work than men during lockdown, and it was more likely to be the mother than the father who reduced working hours or changed employment schedules due to increased time on childcare. Women who spent long hours on housework and childcare were more likely to report increased levels of psychological distress. Working parents who adapted their work patterns increased more psychological distress than those who did not. This association was much stronger if he or she was the only member in the household who adapted their work patterns, or if she was a lone mother. Fathers increased more psychological distress if they reduced work hours but she did not, compared to neither reducing work hours. CONCLUSION: There are continued gender inequalities in divisions of unpaid care work. Juggling home working with homeschooling and childcare as well as extra housework is likely to lead to poor mental health for people with families, particularly for lone mothers.","Xue, Baowen; McMunn, Anne",PLoS One,430,5

This process is crucial for sperm transport, as demonstrated in knockout mouse studies where simultaneous genetic deletion of P2X1-purinoceptors and &#945;1A-adrenoceptors resulted in male infertility. We hypothesize that dual pharmacological antagonism of these two receptors could inhibit sperm transport sufficiently to provide a novel nonhormonal method of male contraception. To generate a suitable P2X1-purinoceptor antagonist, substituents were introduced on the phenyl moiety of 2-phenyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydroquinoxaline to create a series of analogues that were tested for P2X1-purinoceptor antagonism in isolated preparations of rat vas deferens. Novel compounds were initially screened for their ability to attenuate contractile responses to electrical field stimulation (EFS: 60 V, 0.5 ms, 0.2 Hz). The addition of polar substituents to the meta, but not ortho, position markedly increased the inhibition of contractions, as did the addition of both polar and aliphatic substituents to the para position. Di-substituted compounds were also synthesized and tested, resulting in a compound 31 (2-hydroxy, 4-fluoro), which exhibited the greatest potency, with an IC50 of 14 µM (95% confidence limits: 12-16 µM). Additionally, compound 31 noncompetitively antagonized contractions mediated by exogenously administered &#945;ß-methylene ATP (10 nM-30 µM) but had no inhibitory effect on contractions mediated by exogenously administered noradrenaline (30 nM-100 µM) or acetylcholine (30 nM-100 µM). These results have contributed to a structure-activity relationship profile for the P2X1-purinoceptor that will inform future designs of more potent antagonists.","Mathiew, Mitch; Dennis, Belinda M; Bennetts, Felix; Su, N N Eunice; Nguyen, Nghi; Botteon, Antony; Baell, Jonathan B; Ventura, Sabatino",Biol Reprod,430,16

METHODS: We linked COVID-19-related deaths, screening and infection rates to our RD population (1.2.20-1.5.20) and audited active rheumatology follow-up patients through survey data communicated via a linked mobile phone SMS message. We assessed epidemiology, effect of stringent social distancing (shielding) and quality of life (HRQoL) by Short Form 12 (SF12). RESULTS: There were 10,387 active follow-up patients, 7911 had linked mobile numbers. 12/10,387 RD patients died from COVID-19 (0.12%); local population 4131/7,415,149 (0.12%).

In the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence has been reported in specific regions, but an extensive nationwide study has not been reported. Here, we report a nationwide study to determine the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in the population of KSA during the pandemic, using serum samples from healthy blood donors, non-COVID patients and healthcare workers (HCWs) in six different regions of the kingdom, with addition samples from COVID-19 patients. METHODS: A total of 11,703 serum samples were collected from different regions of the KSA including; 5395 samples from residual healthy blood donors (D); 5877 samples from non-COVID patients collected through residual sera at clinical biochemistry labs from non-COVID patients (P); and 400 samples from consented HCWs. To determine the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2, all serum samples, in addition to positive control sera from RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 patients, were subjected to in-house ELISA with a sample pooling strategy, which was further validated by testing individual samples that make up some of the pools, with a statistical estimation method to report seroprevalence estimates. RESULTS: Overall (combining D and P groups) seroprevalence estimate was around 11% in Saudi Arabia; and was 5.1% (Riyadh), 1.5% (Jazan), 18.4% (Qassim), 20.8% (Hail), 14.7% (ER; Alahsa), and 18.8% in Makkah. Makkah samples were only D group and had a rate of 24.4% and 12.8% in the cities of Makkah and Jeddah, respectively. The seroprevalence in Saudi Arabia across the sampled areas would be 12 times the reported COVID-19 infection rate. Among HCWs, 7.5% (4.95-10.16 CI 95%) had reactive antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 without reporting any previously confirmed infection. This was higher in HCWs with hypertension. The study also presents the demographics and prevalence of co-morbidities in HCWs and subset of non-COVID-19 population. INTERPRETATION: Our study estimates the overall national serological prevalence of COVID-19 in Saudi Arabia to be 11%, with an apparent disparity between regions. This indicates the prevalence of asymptomatic or mild unreported COVID-19 cases.","Alharbi, Naif Khalaf; Alghnam, Suliman; Algaissi, Abdullah; Albalawi, Hind; Alenazi, Mohammed W; Albargawi, Areeb M; Alharbi, Abdullah G; Alhazmi, Abdulaziz; Al Qarni, Ali; Alfarhan, Ali; Zowawi, Hosam M; Alhatmi, Hind; Alghamdi, Jahad; Alroqi, Fayhan; Batarfi, Khalid; Arabi, Yaseen M; Hashem, Anwar M; Bosaeed, Mohammed; Aldibasi, Omar",J Infect Public Health,430,1

As with any airborne viral respiratory infection, surgical and non-surgical patients may be affected. Methods: Review and synthesis of pertinent English-language literature pertaining to COVID-19 infection among adult patients. Results: COVID-19 disease that requires hospitalization results in critical illness approximately 25% of the time and requires mechanical ventilation with positive airway pressure. Acute kidney injury, a marked hypercoagulable state, and sometimes myocarditis can be features of COVID-19 in addition to the characteristic severe acute lung injury. Even if not among the most seriously afflicted, older patients with medical comorbidities are both predisposed to infection and risk increased morbidity and mortality, however, all persons presenting for surgical intervention should be suspected of infection (and thus transmissibility) even if asymptomatic. Although most elective surgery has been curtailed by administrative or governmental fiat, patients will still need urgent or emergency operative intervention for time-sensitive disease processes such as malignant neoplasia or for true emergencies such as perforated viscus or traumatic injury. It is possible to provide safe surgical care for SARS-CoV-2-positive patients and minimize nosocomial transmission to healthcare workers. Conclusions: This guidance will facilitate appropriate protection of patients and staff, and maintenance of infection control measures to assist surgical personnel and facilities to prepare for COVID-19-infected adult patients requiring urgent or emergent operative intervention and to provide optimal patient care.","Heffernan, Daithi S; Evans, Heather L; Huston, Jared M; Claridge, Jeffrey A; Blake, David P; May, Addison K; Beilman, Greg S; Barie, Philip S; Kaplan, Lewis J",Surg Infect (Larchmt),430,30

HFNC devices produced by different manufacturers may have varied performance. Whether there is a difference in these devices and the extent of the differences in performance remain unknown. Methods: Four HFNC devices (AIRVO 2, TNI softFlow 50, HUMID-BH, and OH-70C) and a ventilator with an HFNC module (bellavista 1000) were evaluated. The flow was set at 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 60, 70, and 80 L/min, and the FiO2 was set at 21%, 26%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, and 90%. Then, one side of the cannulas was clipped to simulate the compression, bending, or blocking of the nasal cannulas. The flow and FiO2 of the delivered gas were recorded and compared among settings and devices. Results: The actual-flow and actual-FiO2 delivered by different settings and devices varied. AIRVO 2 had superior performance in flow and FiO2 accuracy. bellavista 1000 and OH-70C had good performance in the accuracy of actual-flows and actual-FiO2, respectively. bellavista 1000 and HUMID-BH had a larger flow range from 10 to 80 L/min, but only bellavista 1000 could provide a stable flow with an excessive resistance up to 60 L/min. TNI softFlow 50 had the best flow compensation and could provide sufficient flow with excessive resistance at 20-50 L/min. Conclusions: The variation in flow, FiO2 settings, and devices could influence the actual-flow and actual-FiO2 delivered. AIRVO 2 and OH-70C showed better FiO2 accuracy. TNI softFlow 50, bellavista 1000, and HUMID-BH could lower the risk of insufficient flow support due to accidental compression or blocking of the cannulas. In addition, ventilators with HFNC modules provided comparable flow and FiO2 and could be an alternative to standalone HFNC devices.","Zhou, Yuyan; Ni, Zhong; Ni, Yuenan; Liang, Binmiao; Liang, Zongan",Can Respir J,430,22

We hypothesized that timely government implementation of stringent measures to reduce viral transmission would benefit mental health, as evidenced by reduced rates of depressive symptoms (i.e., Patient Health Questionnaire [PHQ]-9&#8805;10, PHQ-2&#8805;3). METHODS: The systematic review herein (PROSPERO CRD42020200647) evaluated to what extent differences in government-imposed stringency and timeliness of response to COVID-19 moderate the prevalence of depressive symptoms across 33 countries (k=114, N=640,037). We included data from six lower-middle-income countries, nine upper-middle-income countries, and 18 higher-income countries. Government-imposed stringency and timeliness in response were operationalized using the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response (""Stringency"") Index. RESULTS: The overall proportion of study participants with clinically significant depressive symptoms was 21.39% (95% CI 19.37-23.47). The prevalence of clinically significant depressive symptoms was significantly lower in countries wherein governments implemented stringent policies promptly. The moderating effect of government response remained significant after including the national frequency of COVID cases at the time of study commencement, Healthcare Access and Quality index, and the inclusion of COVID patients in the study. LIMITATIONS: Factors that may have confounded our results include, for example, differences in lockdown duration, lack of study participant and outcome assessor blinding, and retrospective assessment of depressive symptom severity.

It is necessary to understand public knowledge and behaviors if we are to effectively address the pandemic. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to test the hypothesis that knowledge about COVID-19 influences participation in different behaviors including self-reports of purchasing more goods than usual, attending large gatherings, and using medical masks. METHODS: This study was funded and approved by the Institutional Review Board on March 17, 2020. The cross-sectional online survey of 1034 US residents aged 18 years or older was conducted on March 17, 2020. RESULTS: For every point increase in knowledge, the odds of participation in purchasing more goods (odds ratio [OR] 0.88, 95% CI 0.81-0.95), attending large gatherings (OR 0.87, 95% CI 0.81-0.93), and using medical masks (OR 0.56, 95% CI 0.50-0.62) decreased by 12%, 13%, and 44%, respectively. Gen X and millennial participants had 56% and 76% higher odds, respectively, of increased purchasing behavior compared to baby boomers. The results suggest that there is a politicization of response recommendations. Democrats had 30% lower odds of attending large gatherings (OR 0.70, 95% CI 0.50-0.97) and 48% lower odds of using medical masks (OR 0.52, 95% CI 0.34-0.78) compared to Republicans. CONCLUSIONS: This survey is one of the first attempts to study determinants of knowledge and behaviors in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. A national, coordinated effort toward a pandemic response may ensure better compliance with behavioral recommendations to address this public health emergency.","Clements, John M",JMIR Public Health Surveill,430,16

At the post-secondary level, very few courses dedicated to serious game design and development exist. At the K-12 level, although (entertainment) game design and programming instruction are becoming more widespread, serious game design and development is ignored. This study aims to present a series of lesson plans that allow K-12 teachers to introduce students to serious game design and development. Design/methodology/approach The lesson plans include both a didactic and applied component and are intended to provide students with an introduction to serious games and their design and development while making students aware of the many career paths within this exciting growing domain. They can also be completed entirely remotely lending themselves nicely to online instruction to facilitate the COVID-19 shutdowns and the resulting move to e-learning. Findings Although several high-school teachers and several elementary school children were consulted during the development of the lesson plans, the lesson plans have only recently been made available, and therefore, there is a lack of any teacher or student feedback available regarding their use. Informally, several elementary school children found the lessons to be fun, interesting and informative.

Acute respiratory distress syndrome due to SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Corona Virus 2) often requires intensive care follow-up. As well as respiratory failure, the SARS-CoV-2 may cause central nervous system (CNS) involvement. The pandemic has raised many challenges in managing critically ill older adults, a population preferentially killed by COVID-19. The mortality and morbidity rates are extremely high in critically ill patients with COVID-19. Recent studies have reported the potential development of a hypercoagulable state in COVID-19. Viral infections and hypoxia may cause these state. It is increasingly reported that thromboembolic events are associated with a poor prognosis. Due to these thromboembolic complications, COVID-19 patients often have neurological symptoms. These symptoms may not be observed in intensive care patients who are sedated. We report one case who was sedated COVID-19 pneumonia and who was later diagnosed with cerebral venous thrombosis with cranial imaging when he could not awaken even though sedation was discontinued. Since COVID-19 causes intense thrombotic susceptibility due to cytokine storm, cerebrovascular thromboembolic complications associated with COVID-19 infection should be considered first and foremost for unconsciousness ventilated patients.

Engineered biomaterials from the nano to macro scale can provide targeted drug delivery, controlled drug release, local immunomodulation, enhanced immunity, and other desirable functions to coordinate appropriate immune responses and repair tissues. Based on the understanding of COVID-19 disease progression and immune responses to SARS-CoV-2, we discuss possible immuno-therapeutic strategies and highlight biomaterial approaches from the perspectives of preventive immunization, therapeutic immunomodulation, and tissue healing and regeneration. Successful development of biomaterial platforms for immunization and immunomodulation will not only benefit COVID-19 patients, but also have broad applications for a variety of infectious diseases.","Zarubova, Jana; Zhang, Xuexiang; Hoffman, Tyler; Hasani-Sadrabadi, Mohammad Mahdi; Li, Song",,430,33

Here, we evaluated the inactivation of two representative human enteric viruses (adenovirus type 40 [AdV] and coxsackievirus B5 [CV]) by thermal or free-chlorine disinfection. In addition, we compared the infectivity reduction ratio of a plant virus (pepper mild mottle virus [PMMoV], a recently proposed novel surrogate for human enteric viruses for the assessment of virus removal by coagulationârapid sand filtration and membrane filtration) with that of the two human enteric viruses to assess the suitability of PMMoV as a human enteric virus surrogate for use in thermal and free-chlorine disinfection processes. Finally, we examined whether conventional or enhanced viability polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis using propidium monoazide (PMA) or improved PMA (PMAxx) with or without an enhancer could be used as alternatives to infectivity assays (i.e., plaque-forming unit method for AdV and CV; local lesion count assay for PMMoV) for evaluating virus inactivation by disinfection processes. We found that PMMoV was more resistant to heat treatment than AdV and CV, suggesting that PMMoV is a potential surrogate for these two enteric viruses with regard to thermal disinfection processes. However, PMMoV was much more resistant to chlorine treatment compared with AdV and CV (which is chlorine-resistant) (CT value for 4-log10 inactivation: PMMoV, 84.5 mg-Cl2·min/L; CV, 1.15-1.19 mg-Cl2·min/L), suggesting that PMMoV is not useful as a surrogate for these enteric viruses with regard to free-chlorine disinfection processes. For thermal disinfection, the magnitude of the signal reduction observed with PMAxx-Enhancer-PCR was comparable with the magnitude of reduction in infectivity, indicating that PMAxx-Enhancer-PCR is a potential alternative to infectivity assay. However, for free-chlorine disinfection, the magnitude of the signal reduction observed with PMAxx-Enhancer-PCR was smaller than the magnitude of the reduction in infectivity, indicating that PMAxx-Enhancer-PCR underestimated the efficacy of virus inactivation (i.e., overestimated the infectious virus concentration) by chlorine treatment. Nevertheless, among the PCR approaches examined in the present study (PCR alone, PMA-PCR or PMAxx-PCR either with or without enhancer), PMAxx-Enhancer-PCR provided the most accurate assessment of the efficacy of virus inactivation by thermal or free chlorine disinfection processes.","Shirasaki, N; Matsushita, T; Matsui, Y; Koriki, S",Water Res,430,10

METHODS: Human conjunctiva and primary pterygium tissues were collected from pterygium patients who underwent surgery. The expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 genes was determined in human primary conjunctival and pterygium cells, human ocular and other tissue cell lines, mesenchymal stem cells as well as mouse ocular and other tissues by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and SYBR green PCR. RESULTS: RT-PCR analysis showed consistent expression by 2 ACE2 gene primers in 2 out of 3 human conjunctival cells and pterygium cell lines. Expression by 2 TMPRSS2 gene primers could only be found in 1 out of 3 pterygium cell lines, but not in any conjunctival cells. Compared with the lung A549 cells, similar expression was noted in conjunctival and pterygium cells. In addition, mouse cornea had comparable expression of Tmprss2 gene and lower but prominent Ace2 gene expression compared with the lung tissue. CONCLUSION: Considering the necessity of both ACE2 and TMPRSS2 for SARS-CoV-2 infection, our results suggest that conjunctiva would be less likely to be infected by SARS-CoV-2, whereas pterygium possesses some possibility of SARS-CoV-2 infection. With high and consistent expression of Ace2 and Tmprss2 in cornea, cornea rather than conjunctiva has higher potential to be infected by SARS-CoV-2. Precaution is necessary to prevent possible SARS-CoV-2 infection through ocular surface in clinical practice.","Ma, Di; Chen, Chong-Bo; Jhanji, Vishal; Xu, Ciyan; Yuan, Xiang-Ling; Liang, Jia-Jian; Huang, Yuqiang; Cen, Ling-Ping; Ng, Tsz Kin",Eye (Lond),430,1

However, observing generation times-the time interval between the infection of an infector and an infectee in a transmission pair-requires data on infection times, which are generally unknown. The timing of symptom onset is more easily observed; generation times are therefore often estimated based on serial intervals-the time interval between symptom onset of an infector and an infectee. This estimation follows one of two approaches: (i) approximating the generation time distribution by the serial interval distribution or (ii) deriving the generation time distribution from the serial interval and incubation period-the time interval between infection and symptom onset in a single individual-distributions. These two approaches make different-and not always explicitly stated-assumptions about the relationship between infectiousness and symptoms, resulting in different generation time distributions with the same mean but unequal variances. Here, we clarify the assumptions that each approach makes and show that neither set of assumptions is plausible for most pathogens. However, the variances of the generation time distribution derived under each assumption can reasonably be considered as upper (approximation with serial interval) and lower (derivation from serial interval) bounds. Thus, we suggest a pragmatic solution is to use both approaches and treat these as edge cases in downstream analysis. We discuss the impact of the variance of the generation time distribution on the controllability of an epidemic through strategies based on contact tracing, and we show that underestimating this variance is likely to overestimate controllability.","Lehtinen, Sonja; Ashcroft, Peter; Bonhoeffer, Sebastian",J R Soc Interface,430,16

We investigated the association between receipt of tocilizumab and mortality in a large cohort of hospitalized patients. METHODS: In this cohort study of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in Spain, the primary outcome was time to death and the secondary outcome time to intensive care unit (ICU) admission or death. We used inverse probability weighting to fit marginal structural models adjusted for time-varying covariates to determine the causal relationship between receipt of tocilizumab and outcome. RESULTS: Data from 1229 patients were analysed, with 261 patients (61 deaths) in the tocilizumab group and 969 patients (120 deaths) in the control group. In the adjusted marginal structural models, a significant interaction between receipt of tocilizumab and high C-reactive protein (CRP) levels was detected. Tocilizumab was associated with decreased risk of death (adjusted hazard ratio 0.34, 95% confidence interval 0.16-0.72, p 0.005) and ICU admission or death (adjusted hazard ratio 0.39, 95% confidence interval 0.19-0.80, p 0.011) among patients with baseline CRP >150 mg/L but not among those with CRP &#8804;150 mg/L. Exploratory subgroup analyses yielded point estimates that were consistent with these findings. CONCLUSIONS: In this large observational study, tocilizumab was associated with a lower risk of death or ICU admission or death in patients with higher CRP levels. While the results of ongoing clinical trials of tocilizumab in patients with COVID-19 will be important to establish its safety and efficacy, our findings have implications for the design of future clinical trials.","Martínez-Sanz, Javier; Muriel, Alfonso; Ron, Raquel; Herrera, Sabina; Pérez-Molina, José A; Moreno, Santiago; Serrano-Villar, Sergio",Clin. microbiol. infect,430,1

STUDY DESIGN: 12 anonymised CTG traces from 2 hospitals in Spain were retrospectively analysed by 2 independent assessors. CTG parameters were studied based on fetal pathophysiological responses to inflammation and hypoxia that would be expected based on the pathogenesis of COVID-19 patients. Correlation was made with perinatal outcomes (Apgar score at 5 min and umbilical cord pH). RESULTS: All fetuses showed an increased baseline FHR > 10 percent compared to the initial recording, in addition to absence of accelerations. 10 out of 12 CTG traces (83.3 percent) demonstrated late or prolonged decelerations and 7 out of 12 fetuses (58.3 percent) showed absence of cycling. Not a single case of sinusoidal pattern was observed. ZigZag pattern was found in 4 CTG traces (33 percent). Excessive uterine activity was observed in all CTG traces where uterine activity was monitored (10 out of 12). Apgar scores at 5 min were normal (>7) and absence of metabolic acidosis was found in the umbilical cord arterial pH (pH > 7.0) in the cases that were available (11 and 9, respectively). CONCLUSION: Fetuses of COVID-19 patients showed a raised baseline FHR (>10 percent), loss of accelerations, late decelerations, ZigZag pattern and absence of cycling probably due to the effects of maternal pyrexia, maternal inflammatory response and the ""cytokine storm"". However, the perinatal outcomes appear to be favourable.

Statements from front-line experts in the field of intensive care are urgently needed. Methods: Sixteen front-line experts in China fighting against the COVID-19 epidemic in Wuhan were organized to develop an expert statement after 5 rounds of expert seminars and discussions to provide trustworthy recommendation on the management of critically ill COVID-19 patients. Each expert was assigned tasks within their field of expertise to provide draft statements and rationale. Parts of the expert statement are based on epidemiological and clinical evidence, without available scientific evidences. Results: A comprehensive document with 46 statements are presented, including protection of medical personnel, etiological treatment, diagnosis and treatment of tissue and organ functional impairment, psychological interventions, immunity therapy, nutritional support, and transportation of critically ill COVID-19 patients. Among them, 5 recommendations were strong (Grade 1), 21 were weak (Grade 2), and 20 were experts’ opinions. A strong agreement from voting participants was obtained for all recommendations. Conclusion: There are still no targeted therapies for COVID-19 patients. Dynamic monitoring and supportive treatment for the restoration of tissue vascularization and organ function are particularly important.","Shang, You; Pan, Chun; Yang, Xianghong; Zhong, Ming; Shang, Xiuling; Wu, Zhixiong; Yu, Zhui; Zhang, Wei; Zhong, Qiang; Zheng, Xia; Sang, Ling; Jiang, Li; Zhang, Jiancheng; Xiong, Wei; Liu, Jiao; Chen, Dechang",Ann.

The current study evaluated the relationship between aldosterone and tissue damage in the brains of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) and whether the RAS inhibitor eplerenone can mitigate the damage seen in these rats. SHRs were randomly divided into eplerenone (n = 10) and SHR (n = 10) groups, and Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats (n = 10) were used as controls. Eplerenone 50 mg/kg/day was administered orally to the eplerenone group. Pathological changes to the hippocampal formation, plasma and encephalic aldosterone, and plasma potassium levels were compared among the groups. After 10 weeks, rats in the eplerenone and SHR groups showed higher systolic BP (p = .01) than the control group. Aldosterone levels in the brain were higher in the SHR group (0.20 ± 0.06 pg/ml) than in the eplerenone (0.14 ± 0.05 pg/ml, p = .044) or control (0.12 ± 0.07 pg/ml, p = .007) groups. Plasma aldosterone levels in the SHR group were 1.7 times higher than those in the control group (p = .006). Cerebral cortex was thinner in the SHR group (225.18 ± 15.43 µm) than in the eplerenone (240.38 ± 12.85 µm, p < .01) or control (244.72 ± 18.92 µm, p < .01) groups. Thickness did not differ between the latter two groups. The SHR group exhibited apoptotic cells in the hippocampal formation, which were rare in the eplerenone and control groups. Plasma potassium levels were higher in the eplerenone group than those in the other two groups (p < .05). Our results showed that eplerenone can alleviate brain damage (thinning of cortex and increased apoptosis) caused by aldosterone in a rat model of hypertension.","Wang, Xue; Zhu, Yuhai; Wang, Shuanglin; Wang, Zhuoqun; Sun, Haonan; He, Yujie; Yao, Wei",Clin Exp Hypertens,430,25

We aimed to systematically evaluate the risk of COVID-19 infection and the risk of severe COVID-19 disease associated with previous exposure to (ACEi) and/or ARB). Methods: MEDLINE, CENTRAL, PsycINFO, Web of Science Core Collection were searched in June 2020 for controlled studies. Eligible studies were included and random-effects meta-analyses were performed. The estimates were expressed as odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI). Heterogeneity was assessed with I2 test. The confidence in the pooled evidence was appraised using the GRADE framework. Results: Twenty-seven studies were included in the review. ACEi/ARB exposure did not increase the risk of having a positive test for COVID-19 infection (OR 0.99, 95%CI 0.89-1.11; I2=36%; 5 studies, GRADE confidence moderate). The exposure to ACEi/ARB did not increase the risk of all-cause mortality among patients with COVID-19 (OR 0.91, 95%CI 0.74-1.11; I2=20%; 17 studies; GRADE confidence low) nor severe/critical COVID-19 disease (OR 0.90, 95%CI 0.74-1.11; I2=55%; 17 studies; GRADE confidence very low). Exploratory analyses in studies enrolling hypertensive patients showed a association of ACEi/ARB with a significant decrease of mortality risk. Conclusions: ACEi/ARB exposure does not seem to increase the risk of having the SARS-CoV-2 infection or developing severe stages of the disease including mortality. The potential benefits observed in mortality of hypertensive patients reassure safety, but robust studies are required to increase the confidence in the results.","Caldeira, Daniel; Alves, Mariana; Gouveia E Melo, Ryan; Silvério António, Pedro; Cunha, Nélson; Nunes-Ferreira, Afonso; Prada, Luisa; Costa, João; Pinto, Fausto J",Int J Cardiol Heart Vasc,430,1

Our objective was to describe the novel application and effect of a telemedicine medical screening evaluation (Tele-MSE) at triage on quality metrics in the pediatric emergency department (PED). METHODS: We conducted a retrospective quasi-experimental pre-post intervention study of patients presenting to an urban PED from December 2017 to November 2019 who received a Tele-MSE at triage. We analyzed 4 diagnostic cohorts: gastroenteritis, psychiatry evaluation, burn injury, and extremity fracture. We matched cases with controls who received standard triage, from December 2015 to November 2017, by age, diagnosis, weekday versus weekend, and season of presentation. Outcome measures included door-to-provider time, time-to-intervention order, and PED length of stay (LOS). RESULTS: We included 557 patients who received Tele-MSE during the study period. Compared with controls, patients who received a Tele-MSE at triage had a shorter median door-to-provider time (median difference [MD], 8.4 minutes; 95% confidence interval [CI], 6.0-11.0), time-to-medication order (MD, 27.3 minutes; 95% CI, 22.9-35.2), time-to-consult order (MD, 10.0 minutes; 95% CI, 5.3-12.7), and PED LOS (MD, 0.4 hours; 95% CI, 0.3-0.6). CONCLUSIONS: A Tele-MSE is an innovative modality to expedite the initiation of emergency care and reduce PED LOS for children. This novel intervention offers potential opportunities to optimize provider and patient satisfaction and safety during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Friedman, Jonathan; Lame, Maria; Clark, Sunday; Gogia, Kriti; Platt, Shari L; Kim, Ji Won",Pediatr Emerg Care,430,30

Frailty is becoming increasinglycommon, with up to 50% of older adults being diagnosedwith mild, moderate or severe frailty (35%, 12% and 3%respectively) (2). Community pharmacists may often bethe primary healthcare professional with whom frail olderpeople have most frequent contact due to their convenienceand accessibility. Therefore, it is hypothesised that community pharmacists could play a wider role in frailty identification and medicines optimisation for frail older people.Aim: To explore community pharmacists' knowledge of frailtyand its assessment, their experiences and contact with frail olderpatients in the community pharmacy setting, and their perceptions of their role in optimising medicines for frail older people.Methods:Two strategies were used to recruit community pharmacists registered in Northern Ireland (NI). Community pharmacists were recruited through the Pharmacy Forum NI bi-monthlynewsletter and the School of Pharmacy Undergraduate PlacementNetwork, followed by snowballing. The interview topic guidewas developed based on the published literature, current frailtyguidelines and through discussion within the research team;itwas piloted with four pharmacists. Semi-structured interviewscommenced in March 2020. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic,face-to-face interviews were logistically not possible, thereforetelephone interviews were conducted at a time convenient to participants. All interviews were recorded, transcribed verbatim andanalysed using inductive thematic analysis. Results: To date, 14 interviews have been conducted,lasting between 24 and 72 minutes. Apart from one interview, all were conducted over the telephone. Participant characteristics are summarised in Table 1. Analysis of interviewtranscripts is ongoing. Findings to date have highlighted thekey role community pharmacists feel they play in assistingfrail older patients with their medicines (especially duringthe current pandemic). Many saw themselves as a 'point ofcontact' for frail older people and highlighted the holistic approaches they used to care of such patients: ""It's easier to getin contact with us than other healthcare professionals and wetend to be the first port of call really"" [CP2]. Interviews highlighted a lack of pharmacist knowledge surrounding frailtyas a condition and its assessment, with participants primarilyfocusing on the physical aspects of frailty (e.g. weight loss,weakness) when observing or 'informally assessing' patients.None of the participants reported formally assessing theirpatients using validated frailty tools or checklists: ""It's notsomething that I've ever thought about. We don't have anytools readily available to us that I know of and certainlynothing that would be standardised"" [CP1].Conclusion: This study has highlighted that communitypharmacists felt they could contribute to optimising medicines for frail older people. However, the findings emphasisethe need for more formal training for community pharmacists about the clinical aspects of frailty, frailty assessmentand future interventions to address the medicines-relatedissues they have encountered with this patient population.","Faulkner, L.; Hughes, C.

In this article, we provide an overview of human rights challenges that forced migrants currently face during this pandemic. While we do not address all dimensions of the impact COVID-19, we highlight several troubling situations that have emerged for refugees and asylum seekers. These include entry restrictions into some countries that had formerly welcomed asylum seekers, overt and covert forms of exclusion of migrants from labor markets due to rising unemployment and economic hardship, and implementing new deportation policies, as well as new exclusionary policies for immigrants who would have been authorized to work in past. Without concerted efforts to amplify solidarity with all forced migrants and ensure their human rights, discriminatory and restrictionist policies enacted in the Global North over the past decade will become entrenched. As a result, fewer refugees and asylum seekers will be accorded protection and continue to face violence and persecution in their home countries.","Libal, Kathryn; Harding, Scott; Popescu, Marciana; Berthold, S Megan; Felten, Grace",J Hum Rights Soc Work,430,17

The purpose of this study was to investigate the functional role of circular RNA ITCH (circ-ITCH) in OSCC and the underlying mechanisms. Methods: RT-qPCR analysis was applied to detect the expression levels of circ-ITCH in OSCC tissues and cell lines. MTT assay and flow cytometer analysis were used to evaluate the effects of circ-ITCH overexpression on the proliferation and apoptosis of OSCC cells. Bioinformatics analysis and dual-luciferase reporter assay were applied to determine the binding relation between circ-ITCH and miR-421 as well as PDCD4 mRNA and miR-421. Results: Our results showed that circ-ITCH expression was remarkably decreased in OSCC tissues and cell lines. Low circ-ITCH expression was strongly associated with adverse clinicopathological characteristics of OSCC patients. Moreover, functional assays demonstrated that circ-ITCH overexpression significantly inhibited OSCC cell proliferation and induced cell apoptosis. Our data further uncovered that circ-ITCH could bind directly to miR-421 and block its repression on PDCD4 in OSCC. MiR-421 expression was significantly increased in OSCC tissues and was inversely correlated with circ-ITCH expression. Notably, miR-421 restoration blocked the tumor-suppressive role of circ-ITCH in OSCC cells. Conclusion: In conclusion, our study reveals that circ-ITCH serves as a tumor suppressor in OSCC partly by regulating miR-421/PDCD4 axis.","Hao, Chunbo; Wangzhou, Kaixin; Liang, Zhengeng; Liu, Cheng; Wang, Linlin; Gong, Lei; Tan, Yi; Li, Conghui; Lai, Zhiying; Hu, Guangwei",Cancer Manag Res,430,26

Though the number of OAT patients increased modestly, the proportion receiving take-home dosing increased from 57.5% to 82.2%, which translates on average to 963,952 fewer clinic interactions annually (range: 728,652-1,016,895) and potentially 80,329 (range: 60,721-84,741) fewer hours of in-person clinical encounters. During the transition, narcologists (addiction specialists) expressed concerns about overdoses, the guidance contradicting existing legislation, and patient dropout, either from incarceration or inadequate public transportation. Though clinicians did observe some overdoses, short-term overall mortality remained similar to the previous year. As the country relaxes the interim guidance, we do not know to what extent governmental guidance or clinical practice will change to adopt the new guidance permanently or revert to pre-guidance regulations. Some future considerations that have come from COVID-19 are should dosing schedules continue to be flexible, should clinicians adopt telehealth, and should there be more overdose education and naloxone distribution? OAT delivery has improved and become more efficient, but clinicians should plan long-term should COVID-19 return in the near future. If the new efficiencies are maintained, it will free the workforce to further scale up OAT.","Meteliuk, Anna; Galvez de Leon, Samy J; Madden, Lynn M; Pykalo, Iryna; Fomenko, Tatiana; Filippovych, Myroslava; Farnum, Scott O; Dvoryak, Sergii; Islam, Zahedul M; Altice, Frederick L",J Subst Abuse Treat,430,1

We screened 586 outpatients (median age 5, range 1–77) presenting with influenza-like-illness (ILI) at 4 sentinel sites in western Cambodia between May 2010 and December 2012. Real-time reverse transcriptase (rRT) PCR for influenza was performed on combined nasal and throat specimens followed by viral culture, antigenic analysis, antiviral susceptibility testing and full genome sequencing for phylogenetic analysis. ILI-specimens negative for influenza were cultured, followed by rRT-PCR for enterovirus and rhinovirus (EV/RV) and EV71. Influenza was found in 168 cases (29%) and occurred almost exclusively in the rainy season from June to November. Isolated influenza strains had close antigenic and phylogenetic relationships, matching vaccine and circulating strains found elsewhere in Cambodia. Influenza vaccination coverage was low (<20%). Western Cambodian H1N1(2009) isolate genomes were more closely related to 10 earlier Cambodia isolates (94.4% genome conservation) than to 13 Thai isolates (75.9% genome conservation), despite sharing the majority of the amino acid changes with the Thai references. Most genes showed signatures of purifying selection. Viral culture detected only adenovirus (5.7%) and parainfluenza virus (3.8%), while non-polio enteroviruses (10.3%) were detected among 164 culture-negative samples including coxsackievirus A4, A6, A8, A9, A12, B3, B4 and echovirus E6 and E9 using nested RT-PCR methods. A single specimen of EV71 was found. Despite proximity to Thailand, influenza epidemiology of these western Cambodian isolates followed patterns observed elsewhere in Cambodia, continuing to support current vaccine and treatment recommendations from the Cambodian National Influenza Center. Amino acid mutations at non-epitope sites, particularly hemagglutinin genes, require further investigation in light of an increasingly important role of permissive mutations in influenza virus evolution. Further research about the burden of adenovirus and non-polio enteroviruses as etiologic agents in acute respiratory infections in Cambodia is also needed.","Timmermans, Ans; Melendrez, Melanie C.; Se, Youry; Chuang, Ilin; Samon, Nou; Uthaimongkol, Nichapat; Klungthong, Chonticha; Manasatienkij, Wudtichai; Thaisomboonsuk, Butsaya; Tyner, Stuart D.; Rith, Sareth; Horm, Viseth Srey; Jarman, Richard G.; Bethell, Delia; Chanarat, Nitima; Pavlin, Julie; Wongstitwilairoong, Tippa; Saingam, Piyaporn; El, But Sam; Fukuda, Mark M.; Touch, Sok; Sovann, Ly; Fernandez, Stefan; Buchy, Philippe; Chanthap, Lon; Saunders, David",PLoS One,430,5

The SARS-CoV-2 spike (S), a surface-anchored trimeric class-I fusion glycoprotein essential for entry into host cells, represents a key target for developing vaccines and therapeutics capable of blocking virus invasion. The emergence of several SARS-CoV-2 spike variants that facilitate virus spread and may affect the efficacy of recently developed vaccines, creates great concern and highlights the importance of identifying antiviral drugs to reduce SARS-CoV-2-related morbidity and mortality. Nitazoxanide, a thiazolide originally developed as an antiprotozoal agent with recognized broad-spectrum antiviral activity in-vitro and in clinical studies, was recently shown to be effective against several coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2. Using biochemical and pseudovirus entry assays, we now demonstrate that nitazoxanide interferes with the SARS-CoV-2 spike biogenesis, hampering its maturation at an endoglycosidase H-sensitive stage, and hindering its fusion activity in human cells. Besides membrane fusion during virus entry, SARS-CoV-2 S-proteins in infected cells can also trigger receptor-dependent formation of syncytia, observed in-vitro and in COVID-19 patients tissues, facilitating viral dissemination between cells and possibly promoting immune evasion. Utilizing two different quantitative cell-cell fusion assays, we show that nitazoxanide is effective in inhibiting syncytia formation mediated by different SARS-CoV-2 spike variants in human lung, liver and intestinal cells. The results suggest that nitazoxanide may represent a useful tool in the fight against COVID-19 infections, inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 replication and preventing spike-mediated syncytia formation.","Riccio, Anna; Santopolo, Silvia; Rossi, Antonio; Piacentini, Sara; Rossignol, Jean-Francois; Gabriella Santoro, M.",bioRxiv,430,18

Nevertheless, its high recombination rate may result in the loss of the full-length foreign gene, limiting their use as vectors. Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) was engineered to express porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) small protein domains, as a strategy to improve heterologous gene stability. After serial passage in tissue cultures, stable expression of small PRRSV protein antigenic domains was achieved. Therefore, size reduction of the heterologous genes inserted in CoV-derived vectors led to the stable expression of antigenic domains. Immunization of piglets with these TGEV vectors led to partial protection against a challenge with a virulent PRRSV strain, as immunized animals showed reduced clinical signs and lung damage.

To address this issue, we developed a computational method that identifies the conserved viral sequences at the genus level for all viral genomes available in GenBank, and established a virus probe library. The virus probes are used not only to identify known viruses but also for discerning the genera of emerging or uncharacterized ones. RESULTS: Using the microarray approach, the identity of the virus in a test sample is determined by the signals of both genus and species-specific probes. The genera of emerging and uncharacterized viruses are determined based on hybridization of the viral sequences to the conserved probes for the existing viral genera. A detection and classification procedure to determine the identity of a virus directly from detection signals results in the rapid identification of the virus. CONCLUSION: We have demonstrated the validity and feasibility of the above strategy with a small number of viral samples. The probe design algorithm can be applied to any publicly available viral sequence database. The strategy of using separate genus and species probe sets enables the use of a straightforward virus identity calculation directly based on the hybridization signals. Our virus identification strategy has great potential in the diagnosis of viral infections.

AIM: To describe characteristics of patients who died and the care they received, and to examine how patient characteristics, setting and visiting restrictions are related to provided care and evaluation of the dying process. DESIGN: An open observational online survey among healthcare professionals about their experience of end-of-life care that was provided to a patient with or without COVID-19 who died between March and July 2020. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Healthcare professionals (nurses, physicians and others) in the Netherlands from all settings: home (n = 163), hospital (n = 249), nursing home (n = 192), hospice (n = 89) or elsewhere (n = 68). RESULTS: Of patients reported on, 56% had COVID-19. Among these patients, 358 (84.4%) also had a serious chronic illness. Having COVID-19 was negatively, and having a serious chronic illness was positively associated with healthcare staff’s favourable appreciation of end-of-life care. Often there had been visiting restrictions in the last 2 days of life (75.8%). This was negatively associated with appreciation of care at the end of life and the dying process. Finally, care at the end of life was less favourably appreciated in hospitals and especially nursing homes, and more favourably in home settings and especially hospices.

It provides an opportunity to examine the effect of the lockdown and of other events on the dynamics of the epidemic. In particular, it has been suggested that municipal elections held just before lockdown was ordered may have helped spread the virus. In this manuscript we use a Bayesian model of the number of deaths through time to study the epidemic in 13 regions of France. We found that the model accurately predicts the number of deaths 2 to 3 weeks in advance, and recovers estimates that are in agreement with recent models that rely on a different structure and different input data. We found that the lockdown had a similar effect on the reproduction rate in all 13 regions, decreasing it by 80 %. Our model predicts that 2.09 (95% CI : 1.69-2.66) million people had been infected by May 11, and that there were 2793 (95% CI : 1761-4543) new infections on May 11. We found no evidence that the reproduction rates differ between week-ends and week days, and no evidence that the reproduction rates increased on the election day. Finally, we evaluated counterfactual scenarios showing that ordering the lockdown 1 to 7 days sooner would have resulted in 18% to 85% fewer deaths, but that ordering it 1 to 7 days later would have resulted in 21% to 262% more deaths. Overall, the predictions of the model indicate that holding the elections on March 15 did not have a detectable impact on the total number of deaths, unless it motivated a delay in imposing the lockdown.","Duchemin, L.; Veber, P.; Boussau, B.",,430,22

Automatic detection from computed tomography (CT) scans is a classic method to detect lung infection, but it faces problems such as high variations in intensity, indistinct edges near lung infected region and noise due to data acquisition process. Therefore, this article proposes a new COVID-19 pulmonary infection segmentation depth network referred as the Attention Gate-Dense Network- Improved Dilation Convolution-UNET (ADID-UNET). The dense network replaces convolution and maximum pooling function to enhance feature propagation and solves gradient disappearance problem. An improved dilation convolution is used to increase the receptive field of the encoder output to further obtain more edge features from the small infected regions. The integration of attention gate into the model suppresses the background and improves prediction accuracy. The experimental results show that the ADID-UNET model can accurately segment COVID-19 lung infected areas, with performance measures greater than 80% for metrics like Accuracy, Specificity and Dice Coefficient (DC). Further when compared to other state-of-the-art architectures, the proposed model showed excellent segmentation effects with a high DC and F1 score of 0.8031 and 0.82 respectively.","Joseph Raj, Alex Noel; Zhu, Haipeng; Khan, Asiya; Zhuang, Zhemin; Yang, Zengbiao; Mahesh, Vijayalakshmi G.

Here, we evaluated the passive immunity transferred from dams immunised with commercial inactivated gE-deleted marker vaccines to calves. We vaccinated 12 pregnant cattle devoid of neutralising antibodies against Bovine alphaherpesvirus 1 (BoHV-1) and divided them into two groups with 6 animals each. Both groups were injected with a different inactivated gE-deleted marker vaccine administrated via intranasal or intramuscular routes. An additional 6 pregnant cattle served as the unvaccinated control group. After calving, the number of animals in each group was increased by the newborn calves. In the dams, the humoral immune response was evaluated before calving and, subsequently, at different times until post-calving day 180 (PCD180). In addition, the antibodies in colostrum, milk, and in serum samples from newborn calves were evaluated at different times until PCD180. The results indicated that inactivated glycoprotein E (gE)-deleted marker vaccines are safe and produce a good humoral immune response in pregnant cattle until calving and PCD180.

In this article, we propose a set of ethical criteria for evaluating participant‐selection strategies for such trials. We argue that the pandemic context—in particular, great urgency to develop safe and effective treatments, uncertainty surrounding Covid‐19, and strain on the health care system that limits the time and effort available for trial enrollment—favors participant‐selection strategies that optimize the ease of enrollment and, ideally, social value.

The paper utilises data collected from a representative sample of 10–17-year-old adolescents in Ireland. Physical activity in the study is measured using moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and vigorous physical activity (VPA). Mental health was measured using the Cantril Leader of Life Satisfaction, the WHO-5 index, Mental Health Inventory (MHI-5) and the Health Behaviour in School-Aged Children (HBSC) Symptom Checklist (HBSC-SCL). Data were analysed using bivariate (Pearson Correlation, t-test, one-way ANOVA) and multivariate (two-way ANOVA, ordinary least squares (OLS) regressions) analyses. In total, 8636 adolescents were included in this analysis. Higher participation in physical activity was associated with higher scores on the positive mental health indicators and lower scores on the mental health problems indicators. When modelled together, VPA was a stronger predictor of mental health than MVPA, especially in girls. For example, standardised beta coefficients for predicting MHI-5 were −0.09 for MVPA (p < 0.001) and −0.13 for VPA (p < 0.001) To our knowledge, this is the first study that looks at levels of physical activity as well as both positive mental health and mental health problems.

In light of the global shortage of PPE and concerns regarding the safety of healthcare providers, clinicians have resorted to the use of novel protective barriers, such as aerosol boxes and plastic sheets, during aerosol generating procedures, especially tracheal intubation. We compared the effect of these barriers on the tracheal intubation of simulated patients with severe COVID-19 in a crossover study. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of King Faisal Specialist Hospital, and the procedures were compliant with the COVID-19 airway management guidelines of the Saudi Anesthesia Society. The time to intubation was our primary outcome. Secondary outcomes included number of optimization maneuvers, number of intubation attempts, time to glottic view and ventilation of the lungs, and damage to PPE. Thirteen consultant anesthetists performed 39 tracheal intubations on a manikin using each of three approaches (aerosol box, plastic sheet, and no-barrier). Data were collected via direct and video observation. The plastic sheet approach demonstrated the highest time to intubation (mean ± StE [95% CI]: 33.3s ± 3.5 [25.8– 40.9]) compared to the aerosol box (22.0s ± 2.5 [16.5 – 27.5], P < 0.01) and no-barrier approaches (16.1s ± 1.1 [13.7 – 18.4], P < 0.0001). Similarly, the plastic sheet approach had the highest time to glottic view, and ventilation intervals compared to the other two approaches, while the no-barrier approach had the shortest time intervals. There were no failed intubations or damage to the PPE sustained during the use of any of the three approaches. The aerosol box does not impose a significant delay in tracheal intubation using video laryngoscopy, unlike the plastic sheet barrier.

AIMS: To discuss how the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic affected the health management of NCD patients, identify which aspects should be carried forward into future NCD management, and propose collaborative efforts among public–private institutions to effectively shape NCD care models. METHODS: The NCD Partnership, a collaboration between Upjohn and the European Innovation Partnership on Active and Healthy Ageing, held a virtual Advisory Board in July 2020 with multiple stakeholders; healthcare professionals (HCPs), policymakers, researchers, patient and informal carer advocacy groups, patient empowerment organizations, and industry experts. RESULTS: The Advisory Board identified barriers to NCD care during the COVID-19 pandemic in four areas: lack of NCD management guidelines; disruption to integrated care and shift from hospital-based NCD care to more community and primary level care; infodemics and a lack of reliable health information for patients and HCPs on how to manage NCDs; lack of availability, training, standardization, and regulation of digital health tools. CONCLUSIONS: Multistakeholder partnerships can promote swift changes to NCD prevention and patient care. Intra- and inter-communication between all stakeholders should be facilitated involving all players in the development of clinical guidelines and digital health tools, health and social care restructuring, and patient support in the short-, medium- and long-term future. A comprehensive response to NCDs should be delivered to improve patient outcomes by providing strategic, scientific, and economic support.","Monaco, Alessandro; Casteig Blanco, Amaia; Cobain, Mark; Costa, Elisio; Guldemond, Nick; Hancock, Christine; Onder, Graziano; Pecorelli, Sergio; Silva, Mitchell; Tournoy, Jos; Trevisan, Caterina; Votta, Mariano; Yfantopoulos, John; Yghemonos, Stecy; Clay, Vincent; Mondello Malvestiti, Franco; De Schaetzen, Karine; Sykara, Georgia; Donde, Shaantanu",Aging Clin Exp Res,430,24

This online, cross-sectional survey used questionnaires, such as the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) questionnaire, the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-2), the Connor–Davidson Resilience Scale, stress-related questions, and Brief Coping Orientation to Problems Experienced (Brief-COPE), to determine the psychological impact of COVID-19 on licensed full-time practicing nurses undertaking part-time studies in higher education. Recruitment commenced from August to September 2020; 385 students were approached, and 124 completed the survey (response rate: 32%). Most of the respondents were frontline nurses working in public sectors (89.5%), 29% of whom reported symptoms of depression, and 61.3% reported mild to severe levels of anxiety. The GAD-7 was significantly associated with the resilience score (β = −0.188; p = 0.008) and exhaustion (β = 0.612; p < 0.001). The PHQ-2 was significantly associated with ‘anxiety about infection’ (β = 0.071; p = 0.048). A lower anxiety level was significantly associated with a higher resilience level and a lower level of exhaustion, and a lower depression level was significantly associated with a lower anxiety about infection. Nursing programs incorporating resilience building may mitigate psychological distress of the study population.","Chan, Siu-Ling; Takemura, Naomi; Chau, Pui-Hing; Lin, Chia-Chin; Wang, Man-Ping",Int J Environ Res Public Health,430,1

A rapid and highly sensitive detection and quantification method for TSV and YHV was developed using the GeneAmp® 5700 Sequence Detection System and SYBR Green chemistry. The reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) mixture contained a fluorescent dye, SYBR Green, which exhibits fluorescence enhancement upon binding to double strand cDNA. The enhancement of fluorescence was found to be proportional to the initial concentration of the template cDNA. A linear relationship was observed between input plasmid DNA and cycle threshold (C T) values for 106 down to a single copy of both viruses. To control for the variation in sample processing and in reverse transcription reaction among samples, shrimp β-actin and elongation factor-1α (EF-1α) genes were amplified in parallel with the viral cDNA. The sensitivity and the efficiency of amplification of EF-1α was greater than β-actin when compared to TSV and YHV amplification efficiency suggesting that EF-1α is a better internal control for the RT-PCR detection of TSV and YHV. In addition, sample to sample variation in EF-1α C T value was lower than the variation in β-actin C T value of the corresponding samples. The specificity of TSV, YHV, EF-1α and β-actin amplifications was confirmed by analyzing the dissociation curves of the target amplicon. The C T values of TSV and YHV samples were normalized against EF-1α C T values for determining the absolute copy number from the standard curve of the corresponding virus. The method described here is highly robust and is amenable to high throughput assays making it a useful tool for diagnostic, epidemiological and genetic studies in shrimp aquaculture.","Dhar, Arun K.; Roux, Michelle M.; Klimpel, Kurt R.",Journal of Virological Methods,430,16

A key step involved in the preparation of Pd-Ir nanocubes is the synthesis of Pd nanocubes. However, the traditional method to synthesize Pd nanocubes requires sophisticated and expensive equipment to precisely control the reaction temperature and highly skilled technicians to achieve satisfactory and reproducible product yields. Herein, we report a simple, cost-effective, high-yield (> 99%) and one-pot strategy to synthesize Pd nanocubes with sizes of 7, 18, and 51 nm for the preparation of Pd-Ir nanocubes. The resulting 18 nm Pd-Ir nanocubes display three orders of magnitude higher peroxidase activity compared to horseradish peroxidase, leading to a significantly increased detection sensitivity when applied in the immunoassay of nucleocapsid protein from SARS-CoV-2. Due to the simplicity in both material synthesis and assaying procedures and the excellent detection sensitivity, our method should allow for the generalized application of Pd-Ir nanocube-based immunoassays for the diagnosis of human diseases.

With existing prevention and treatment modalities, cervical cancer elimination is now within reach for high-income countries. Despite limited financing and capacity constraints in low-and-middle-income countries (LMICs), prevention and control efforts can be supported through integrated services and new technologies. We conducted this scoping review to outline a roadmap toward cervical cancer elimination in LMICs and highlight evidence-based interventions and research priorities to accelerate cervical cancer elimination. We reviewed and synthesized literature from 2010 to 2020 on primary and secondary cervical cancer prevention strategies. In addition, we conducted expert interviews with gynecologic and infectious disease providers, researchers, and LMIC health officials. Using these data, we developed a logic model to summarize the current state of science and identified evidence gaps and priority research questions for each prevention strategy. The logic model for cervical cancer elimination maps the needs for improved collaboration between policy makers, production and supply, healthcare systems, providers, health workers, and communities. The model articulates responsibilities for stakeholders and visualizes processes to increase access to and coverage of prevention methods. We discuss the challenges of contextual factors and highlight innovation needs. Effective prevention methods include HPV vaccination, screening using visual inspection and HPV testing, and thermocoagulation. However, vaccine coverage remains low in LMICs. New strategies, including single-dose vaccination could enhance impact. Loss to follow-up and treatment delays could be addressed by improved same-day screen-and-treat technologies. We provide a practical framework to guide cervical cancer elimination in LMICs. The scoping review highlights existing and innovative strategies, unmet needs, and collaborations required to achieve elimination across implementation contexts.","Shin, Michelle B.; Liu, Gui; Mugo, Nelly; Garcia, Patricia J.; Rao, Darcy W.; Bayer, Cara J.; Eckert, Linda O.; Pinder, Leeya F.; Wasserheit, Judith N.; Barnabas, Ruanne V.",Front Public Health,430,11

Platypus Bay is unique in repeatedly producing ciguateric fishes in Australia, with ciguatoxins produced by benthic dinoflagellates (Gambierdiscus spp.) growing epiphytically on free-living, benthic macroalgae. The Gambierdiscus are consumed by invertebrates living within the macroalgae, which are preyed upon by small carnivorous fishes, which are then preyed upon by Spanish mackerel (Scomberomorus commerson). We hypothesise that Gambierdiscus and/or Fukuyoa species growing on turf algae are the main source of ciguatoxins entering marine food chains to cause ciguatera on the Great Barrier Reef. The abundance of surgeonfish that feed on turf algae may act as a feedback mechanism controlling the flow of ciguatoxins through this marine food chain. If this hypothesis is broadly applicable, then a reduction in herbivory from overharvesting of herbivores could lead to increases in ciguatera by concentrating ciguatoxins through the remaining, smaller population of herbivores. Modelling the dilution of ciguatoxins by somatic growth in Spanish mackerel and coral trout (Plectropomus leopardus) revealed that growth could not significantly reduce the toxicity of fish flesh, except in young fast-growing fishes or legal-sized fishes contaminated with low levels of ciguatoxins. If Spanish mackerel along the east coast of Australia can depurate ciguatoxins, it is most likely with a half-life of ≤1-year. Our review and conceptual models can aid management and research of ciguatera in Australia, and globally.","Holmes, Michael J.; Venables, Bill; Lewis, Richard J.",Toxins (Basel),430,1

Nurse Practitioners (NPs) represent an efficient solution to human resource challenges. During the current pandemic, many Medical Directors in LTC homes worked virtually to reduce the risk of transmission. In contrast, NPs were present for in-person care. This study aims to understand the NPs’ roles in optimizing resident care and supporting LTC staff during the pandemic. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This exploratory qualitative study employed a phenomenological approach. A purposive sample of 14 NPs working in LTC homes in Ontario, Canada was recruited. Data was generated using semi-structured interviews and examined using thematic analysis. RESULTS: Four categories relating to the NPs’ practices and experiences during the pandemic were identified: a) containing the spread of COVID-19; b) stepping in where needed; c) supporting staff and families; and d) establishing links between fragmented systems of care by acting as a liaison. DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: The findings suggest that innovative models of care that include NPs in LTC homes are required moving forward. NPs embraced a multitude of roles in LTC homes, but the need to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 was central to how they prioritized their days. The pandemic clearly accentuated that NPs have a unique scope of practice, which positions them well to act as leaders and build capacity in LTC home.","McGilton, Katherine S; Krassikova, Alexandra; Boscart, Veronique; Sidani, Souraya; Iaboni, Andrea; Vellani, Shirin; Escrig-Pinol, Astrid",Gerontologist,430,1

It is vital to devise a reliable, simple, cost-saving, and easy-to-use assay for detecting the N. gonorrhoeae agent. In the current study, we firstly report a novel approach, loop-mediated isothermal amplification linked with a polymer nanoparticle–based biosensor (LAMP-PNB), that was used for identifying N. gonorrhoeae in clinical samples. The results showed that the LAMP primers based on the orf1 gene were valid for development of the N. gonorrhoeae-LAMP-PNB assay. The detection system with optimal conditions could be performed at a fixed temperature of 64°C for 40 min. The whole process, including genomic DNA preparation (approximately 10 min), LAMP reaction (40 min), and PNB reporting (approximately 2 min), could be accomplished within 60 min. The limit of detection (LoD) of the N. gonorrhoeae-LAMP-PNB assay was 50 copies per test. The specificity of the current assay was 100%, and no cross-reactions to non–N. gonorrhoeae isolates were observed. These results confirmed that the N. gonorrhoeae-LAMP-PNB technique is a reliable, specific, sensitive, rapid, low-cost, and easy-to-use method for detecting gonococci isolates. More importantly, this assay has great potential to develop a point-of-care (POC) testing method in clinical practice, especially in resource-constrained regions.","Chen, Xu; Zhou, Qingxue; Wu, Xueli; Wang, Shuoshi; Liu, Rui; Dong, Shilei; Yuan, Wei",Front Mol Biosci,430,16

METHODS: Two-week wait referrals were stratified into low, intermediate and high risk. Low risk patients were referred back to primary care with advice; intermediate and high risk patients underwent investigation. Clinical encounters and aerosol generating procedures were minimised. A combined diagnostic and therapeutic surgical approach was undertaken where possible. RESULTS: Forty-one patients were used to assess feasibility. Thirty-one per cent were low risk, 35 per cent were intermediate and 33 per cent were high risk. Thirty-three per cent were discharged with no imaging. CONCLUSION: Implementing this protocol reduces the future burden on tertiary services, by empowering primary care physicians to re-refer low risk patients.

ERP provide new ideas for the orderly recovery of society. However, there have been studies that often pay attention to individual factors, and less concerned about the external environment. In fact, ERP will be affected by the external environment and individual factors. We used a Python script to collect 65,277 valid Weibo comments during the COVID-19 epidemic in China to assess urban residents’ environmental risk perception (ERP). SnowNLP emotion analysis was used to measure the ERP of 366 urban in China, and the structural proportion characteristics and spatial-temporal differentiation of ERP were analyzed. Then, an order logistic regression model was used to investigate the relationship between economic level, social security, medical facilities and ERP. The study investigated the Chinese cities have a higher ERP during the COVID-19 period, and it shows marked fluctuations. As COVID-19 spreads, the ERP shows a distribution pattern of “high in the southeast and low in the northwest” with Hu line as the boundary and “from high to low” with Wuhan as the high value center. COVID-19 serves as catalysts for ERP, the impact of COVID-19 is enhanced after socioeconomic factors are considered. The economic level effectively regulates ERP, except the stage of accelerating diffusion. ERP is effectively stabilized by social security and medical facilities. After considering all the variables simultaneously, we found that the mitigation effect of social security and medical facilities on ERP has improved.","Zhang, Jingfei; Zheng, Zhicheng; Zhang, Lijun; Qin, Yaochen; Duan, Jieran; Zhang, Anyi",Int J Environ Res Public Health,430,16

A recently discovered class of human monoclonal antibodies with the ability to neutralize a broad spectrum of influenza viruses (including H1, H2, H5, H6 and H9 subtypes) has the potential to prevent and treat influenza in humans. Here we report the latest efficacy data for a representative antibody of this novel class. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We evaluated the prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy of the human monoclonal antibody CR6261 against lethal challenge with the highly pathogenic avian H5N1 virus in ferrets, the optimal model of human influenza infection. Survival rates, clinically relevant disease signs such as changes in body weight and temperature, virus replication in lungs and upper respiratory tract, as well as macro- and microscopic pathology were investigated. Prophylactic administration of 30 and 10 mg/kg CR6261 prior to viral challenge completely prevented mortality, weight loss and reduced the amount of infectious virus in the lungs by more than 99.9%, abolished shedding of virus in pharyngeal secretions and largely prevented H5N1-induced lung pathology. When administered therapeutically 1 day after challenge, 30 mg/kg CR6261 prevented death in all animals and blunted disease, as evidenced by decreased weight loss and temperature rise, reduced lung viral loads and shedding, and less lung damage. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These data demonstrate the prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy of this new class of human monoclonal antibodies in a highly stringent and clinically relevant animal model of influenza and justify clinical development of this approach as intervention for both seasonal and pandemic influenza.","Friesen, Robert H.

Pestiviral antigens were detected by immunohistochemistry in most tissues with remarkable signals in lungs and kidneys. PI lambs were constantly viremic, shed the virus through the nasal secretions and feces and, in all cases but one, did not have detectable HoBi-like pestivirus antibodies before the assumption of colostrum. The single seropositive infected lamb showed low-titer viremia and viral shedding that ceased only several weeks after the 3-month observation period.

Method: A scan was performed of provincial and territorial reporting of five data elements (cumulative totals of tests, cases, hospitalizations, deaths and population size) across three units of aggregation (province or territory-level, health regions, and local areas) (15 ""overall"" indicators), and for two vulnerable settings (long term care and detention facilities) and six social markers (age, sex, immigration status, race/ethnicity, essential worker status, and income) (120 ""equity-related"" indicators). Per indicator, one point was awarded if case-delimited data were released, 0.7 points if only summary statistics were reported, and 0 if neither was provided. Results were presented using a scorecard approach. Results: Overall, information on cases and deaths was more complete than for tests, hospitalizations and population size denominators needed for rate estimation. Information provided on jurisdictions and their regions, overall, tended to be more available (average score of 53%, ""B"") than for equity-related indicators (average score of 21%, ""D""). Only British Columbia and Alberta provided case-delimited data, and only Alberta provided information for local areas. No jurisdiction reported on outcomes according to patients' individual-level immigration status, race, or income. Only Ontario and Quebec provided detailed information for long-term care settings and detention facilities. Conclusion: Socially stratified reporting for COVID-19 outcomes is sparse in Canada. However, several best practices in health equity-oriented reporting were observed and set a relevant precedent for all jurisdictions to follow for this pandemic and future ones.","Blair, A.; Warsame, K.; Naik, H.; Byrne, W.; Parnia, A.; Siddiqi, A.",,430,32

Three primary factors influence transfer: trainee characteristics, training design and work environment influences. Within medical education, the work environment factors influencing transfer of training remain underexplored. Burke and Hutchins’ review of training transfer outlined five work environment influences: opportunity to perform, supervisor/peer support, strategic link, transfer climate and accountability. This study aimed to explore the ways in which work environment factors influence the transfer of training for medical trainees. METHODS: Internal Medicine Training in Scotland includes a three-day boot camp involving simulation-based mastery learning of procedural skills, immersive simulation scenarios and communication workshops. Following ethical approval, trainees were invited to take part in interviews at least three months after following their boot camp. Interviews were semi-structured, anonymised, transcribed verbatim and analysed using template analysis. Member checking interviews were performed to verify findings. RESULTS: A total of 26 trainees took part in interviews between January 2020 and January 2021. Trainees reported a lack of opportunities to perform procedures in the workplace and challenges relating to the transfer climate, including a lack of appropriate equipment and resistance to change in the workplace. Trainees described a strong sense of personal responsibility to transfer and they felt empowered to change practice in response to the challenges faced. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights barriers to transfer of training within the clinical workplace including procedural opportunities, a transfer climate with challenging equipment availability and, at times, an unsupportive workplace culture. Trainees are driven by their own sense of personal responsibility; medical educators and healthcare leaders must harness this enthusiasm and take heed of the barriers to assist in the development of strategies to overcome them.

Nonetheless, the pandemic experience has been very different across provinces, and the objective of this paper is to investigate these differences focusing on two extreme cases. We contrast the mortality experience of British Columbia with that of Québec to understand how large differences in mortality during the first wave of the pandemic emerged across these two provinces. We find that most of the differences can be found in excess mortality in institutions (nursing homes) and that travel restrictions, differences in how deaths are recorded, differences in the seasonality of the flu, or differences in how the pandemic spread across different economic segments of the population are unlikely explain these large differences. We document that the reported death toll from COVID-19 is about 30% larger than excess mortality in Quebec due to lower mortality from other causes of death, in particular malignant tumors, heart disease, and respiratory problems. We do not find evidence of an income gradient (measured by postal code level income) in relative excess death for the first wave.","Décarie, Yann; Michaud, Pierre-Carl",Can Stud Popul,430,1

Users are able to interact with the visualization by changing the attributes being displayed, comparing the overlaps of multiple fields, and extracting data, as a way to refine their search. The solutions being proposed in this work were tested against each other in comparable 2D and 3D interactive visualizations of the same data in a series of data-extraction assessments with users, as a means to validate the approaches. Results exposed a correctness-time trade-off between the interaction methods. The hand-based techniques (Hand Slider and Touch Lens) were the least error-prone, being near to half as error-inducing as the gaze-based method. Touch Lens also performed as the least time-consuming method, taking in average less than half of the average time required by the others. For the visualization methods tested, the 2D ray casts presented a higher usability score and lesser workload index than the 3D topology view, however exposing over two times the error ratio.

Organotypically differentiated EC ranging from continuous, barrier-forming endothelium to discontinuous, fenestrated endothelium perform organ-specific functions such as the maintenance of the tightly sealed blood–brain barrier or the clearance of macromolecular waste products from the peripheral blood by liver EC-expressed scavenger receptors. The microvascular bed of the liver, composed of discontinuous, fenestrated liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSEC), is a prime example of organ-specific angiodiversity. Anatomy and development of LSEC have been extensively studied by electron microscopy as well as linage-tracing experiments. Recent advances in cell isolation and bulk transcriptomics or single-cell RNA sequencing techniques allowed the identification of distinct LSEC molecular programs and have led to the identification of LSEC subpopulations. LSEC execute homeostatic functions such as fine tuning the vascular tone, clearing noxious substances from the circulation, and modulating immunoregulatory mechanisms. In recent years, the identification and functional analysis of LSEC-derived angiocrine signals, which control liver homeostasis and disease pathogenesis in an instructive manner, marks a major change of paradigm in the understanding of liver function in health and disease. This review summarizes recent advances in the understanding of liver vascular angiodiversity and the functional consequences resulting thereof.","Koch, Philipp-Sebastian; Lee, Ki Hong; Goerdt, Sergij; Augustin, Hellmut G.",Angiogenesis,430,16

Our objective is to estimate the maternal mortality ratio in 1 year and analyze the clinical course of pregnant women hospitalized due to acute respiratory distress syndrome and COVID-19. METHODS: A retrospective surveillance study of the national maternal mortality was performed from February 2020–February 2021 in Mexico related to COVID-19 cases in pregnant women, including their outcomes. Comparisons were made between patients who died and those who survived to identify prognostic factors and underlying health conditions distribution. RESULTS: Maternal Mortality Ratio increased by 56.8% in the studied period, confirmed COVID-19 was the cause of 22.93% of cases. Additionally, unconfirmed cases represented 4.5% of all maternal deaths. Among hospitalized pregnant women with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome consistent with COVID-19, smoking and cardiovascular diseases were more common among patients who faced a fatal outcome. They were also more common in the age group of < 19 or > 38. In addition, pneumonia was associated with asthma and immune impairment, while diabetes and increased BMI increased the odds for death (Odds Ratio 2.30 and 1.70, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Maternal Mortality Ratio in Mexico increased over 60% in 1 year during the pandemic; COVID-19 was linked to 25.4% of maternal deaths in the studied period. Lethality among pregnant women with a diagnosis of COVID-19 was 2.8%, and while asthma and immune impairment increased propensity for developing pneumonia, obesity and diabetes increased the odds for in-hospital death. Measures are needed to improve access to coordinated well-organized healthcare to reduce maternal deaths related to COVID-19 and pandemic collateral effects.","Mendez-Dominguez, Nina; Santos-Zaldívar, Karen; Gomez-Carro, Salvador; Datta-Banik, Sudip; Carrillo, Genny",BMC Public Health,430,16

Since the coup d’état in 1973, Chile has experienced a series of structural economic changes framed by neoliberal ideas cemented in the “Constitution of Pinochet.” Precarious work in Chile is a direct consequence of these ideas. This multidimensional phenomenon has progressively been entering employment areas where it was not previously present. As a result, there has been a rise in work precarization and its full impact on health is not well known. The goal of this study was to estimate the association of work precariousness with mental health outcomes in Chilean workers. METHODS: Data were obtained from the Chilean Survey of Work and Health 2009–2010 (ENETS). Only valid records of salaried workers (excluding hourly-only or commission-only workers) in the private sector without missing values were included (n = 1900). After applying appropriate sampling weights, 1,461,727 workers were represented. Mental health was estimated as anxiety/depression levels using the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12). A multilevel multivariate generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) with negative binomial and log link distribution was used to study the association between precariousness and depression/anxiety. RESULTS: Looking at the overall precariousness scale (range from zero to four), we observed an increase of approximately 34% in the depression/anxiety score (scale range from 0 to 36) for every unit on the precarious work overall scale (Relative Risk = 1.34, 95% CI = 1.28, 1.42) controlling for age, sex, and occupational group. CONCLUSION: Precarious work was associated with anxiety and depression as measured with the 12-item General Health Questionnaire.

In India, migration has been dominated by people from Eastern and Central regions moving to western and northwestern regions. On the other hand, Northeast has been known for in-migration and the conflicts arising from influx of migrants, but studies are lacking on the out-migration from the region. This study makes an attempt to study both inflow and outflow from the region and covers both internal and international migration. In this study, the Northeast India consists of the seven states of Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland and Tripura. Each state of the region shares an international boundary. The paper uses data from Census 2011 and has tried to study the magnitude of inflows to the region as well as the outflows from the region at the state level and also the reasons for migration. The state of Manipur is unique in the entire Northeast as outflow is three times higher than the inflow in the state. Assam is losing population due to internal migration to other states of India but compensated by international migration. The state of Assam presents a balanced ratio of inflow and outflow as stands in 2011 contrary to the popular perception that the state is gaining population inundated by immigration. The rest of the states of Northeast are gaining population predominantly due to internal migration, whereas Tripura gained population more from international compared to internal migration. The paper throws light on the combined impact of internal and international migration in the Northeast region which is generally lacking in migration studies on Northeast relevant for economic policy and political decision making. It also makes an assessment of reverse flows during the pandemic and lockdown.","Lusome, R.; Bhagat, R. B.",Indian J Labour Econ,430,16

MAIN BODY: Emerging novel COVID-19 is a global health emergency on a pandemic scale that represents a terror to human health through its ability to escape anti-viral measures. Such viral infections impose a great socioeconomic burden, besides global health challenges. This imposes a pressing need for the development of anti-viral therapeutic agents and diagnostic tools that demonstrate multifunctional, target-specific, and non-toxic properties. Nanotheranostics is regarded as a promising approach for the management of different viral infections. Nanotheranostics facilitates targeted drug-delivery of anti-viral therapeutics as well as contributing to the development of diagnostic systems. Multifunctional metallic nanoparticles (NPs) have emerged as innovative theranostic agents that enable sustainable treatment and effective diagnosis. Here we have reviewed current advances in the use of theranostic metallic NPs to fight against COVID-19, and discussed the application as well as limitations associated with nanotechnology-based theranostic approaches. CONCLUSION: This review verified the potential use of some metal-based NPs as anti-viral nanotheranostic agents. Metal-based NPs could act as carriers that enable the sustainable and targeted delivery of active anti-viral molecules, or as diagnostic agents that allow rapid and sensitive diagnosis of viral infections.","Ibrahim Fouad, Ghadha",Bull Natl Res Cent,430,22

METHODS: In this prospective, single centre, diagnostic accuracy cohort study, consecutive adults (≥ 18 years) presenting with symptoms consistent with COVID-19 or previous contact to infected individuals, admitted to the emergency department and supposed to be referred to general ward were included in March and April 2020. All participants underwent low-dose chest CT. RT-PCR- and specific antibody tests were used as reference standard. Main outcome measures were sensitivity and specificity of chest CT. Predictive values were calculated based on the theorem of Bayes using Fagan’s nomogram. RESULTS: Of 165 participants (56.4% male, 71 ± 16 years) included in the study, the diagnosis of COVID-19 was confirmed with RT-PCR and AB tests in 13 participants (prevalence 7.9%). Sensitivity and specificity of chest CT were 84.6% (95% confidence interval [CI], 54.6–98.1) and 94.7% (95% CI, 89.9–97.7), respectively. Positive and negative likelihood ratio of chest CT were 16.1 (95% CI, 7.9–32.8) and 0.16 (95% CI, 0.05–0.58) and positive and negative predictive value were 57.9% (95% CI, 40.3–73.7) and 98.6% (95% CI, 95.3–99.6), respectively.

On the contrary, immuno-compromised patients are prone to progress into severe or critical types underpinned by the entanglement of an overexuberant proinflammatory response and injured immune function. Therefore, well-coordinated innate and adaptive immune systems are pivotal to viral eradication and tissue repair.

This paper assesses the likely consequences for medical schools in particular, beginning with an overview of the research literature on predicted grades, concluding that calculated grades are likely to correlate strongly with the predicted grades that schools currently provide on UCAS applications. A notable absence from the literature is evidence on whether predicted grades are better or worse than actual grades in predicting university outcomes. This paper provides such evidence on the reduced predictive validity of predicted A-level grades in comparison with actual A-level grades. The present study analyses the extensive data on predicted and actual grades which are available in UKMED (United Kingdom Medical Education Database), a large-scale administrative dataset containing longitudinal data from medical school application, through undergraduate and then postgraduate training. In particular, predicted A-level grades as well as actual A-level grades are available, along with undergraduate outcomes and postgraduate outcomes which can be used to assess predictive validity of measures collected at selection. This study looks at two UKMED datasets. In the first dataset we compare actual and predicted A-level grades in 237,030 A-levels taken by medical school applicants between 2010 and 2018. 48.8% of predicted grades were accurate, grades were over-predicted in 44.7% of cases and under-predicted in 6.5% of cases. Some A-level subjects, General Studies in particular, showed a higher degree of over-estimation. Similar over-prediction was found for Extended Project Qualifications, and for SQA Advanced Highers. The second dataset considered 22,150 18-year old applicants to medical school in 2010 to 2014, who had both predicted and actual A-level grades. 12,600 students entered medical school and had final year outcomes available. In addition there were postgraduate outcomes for 1,340 doctors. Undergraduate outcomes are predicted significantly better by actual, attained A-level grades than by predicted A-level grades, as is also the case for postgraduate outcomes. Modelling the effect of selecting only on calculated grades suggests that because of the lesser predictive ability of predicted grades, medical school cohorts for the 2020 entry year are likely to under-attain, with 13% more gaining the equivalent of the current lowest decile of performance, and 16% fewer gaining the equivalent of the current top decile, effects which are then likely to follow through into postgraduate training. The problems of predicted/calculated grades can to some extent, although not entirely, be ameliorated, by taking U(K)CAT, BMAT, and perhaps other measures into account to supplement calculated grades.

In this retrospective study, serum calcium levels, hormone levels and clinical laboratory parameters on admission were recorded. The clinical outcome variables were also recorded. From February 10 to February 28, 2020, 241 patients were enrolled. Of these patients, 180 (74.7%) had hypocalcemia on admission. The median serum calcium levels were 2.12 (IQR, 2.04-2.20) mmol/L, median parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels were 55.27 (IQR, 42.73-73.15) pg/mL, and median 25-hydroxy-vitamin D (VD) levels were 10.20 (IQR, 8.20-12.65) ng/mL. The serum calcium levels were significantly positively correlated with VD levels (P =0.004) but negatively correlated with PTH levels (P =0.048). Patients with lower serum calcium levels (especially ≤2.0 mmol/L) had worse clinical parameters, higher incidences of organ injury and septic shock, and higher 28-day mortality. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, septic shock, and 28-day mortality were 0.923 (P <0.001), 0.905 (P =0.001), and 0.929 (P <0.001), respectively. In conclusion, serum calcium was associated with the clinical severity and prognosis of patients with COVID-19.

Traditionally, telemedicine has been used for acute events (e.g., stroke, used to relay essential information to the emergency department) and chronic disease management (e.g., diabetes and chronic kidney disease management). Though the utilization of telemedicine in gastroenterology and hepatology has been modest at best, especially for inflammatory bowel diseases and chronic liver disease management, since the onset of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, utilization of telemedicine in gastroenterology increased by 4000% in the first two weeks, equivalent to the last six years of growth before the pandemic. The Center for Medicare and Medicaid (CMS) relaxed rules for the use of telemedicine with easing restrictions on reimbursements, location, licensing requirements (across state lines), and the need for a prior provider-patient relationship. These changes increased the use of telemedicine in inpatient and outpatient settings for gastroenterology-related referrals. The use of inpatient telephonic or video consults helps provide timely care during the pandemic while conserving personal protective equipment and decreasing provider and patient exposure. Nevertheless, telehealth use comes at the cost of no direct patient contact and lesser reimbursements. The appropriate use of technology and equipment, training of healthcare providers, use of platforms that can be integrated into the electronic health record while protecting the privacy and the flow of information are essential components of telemedicine. Furthermore, encouraging patients to seek medical care remotely with the proper equipment and improving digital literacy without the need for physical examinations is a challenge, further compounded in elderly or hard-of-hearing patients and in patients who are more comfortable with in-person visits. The authors will systematically review and discuss how telemedicine can be integrated into the practice of gastroenterology and hepatology, with emphasis placed on discussing barriers to success and the ways they can be mitigated.","Perisetti, Abhilash; Goyal, Hemant",Dig Dis Sci,430,23

Here, we review techniques for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in municipal wastewater, and disinfectants used to control viral spread. For detection, concentration of ribonucleic acid involves ultrafiltration, ultracentrifugation and polyethylene glycol precipitation. Identification is done by reverse transcriptase amplification, nucleic acid sequence-based amplification, helicase dependent amplification, loop-mediated isothermal amplification, recombinase polymerase amplification, high throughput screening and biosensor assays. Disinfectants include ultraviolet radiations, ozone, chlorine dioxide, hypochlorites and hydrogen peroxide. Wastewater surveillance data indicates viral presence within longer detection window, and provides transmission dynamics earlier than classical methods.

The Achilles tendon is known to be particularly vulnerable in this population cohort but during the COVID-19 lockdowns in Ireland and all over the world there has been a certain level of detraining and deconditioning among all age groups and populations. Throughout the worldwide restrictions, viral internet challenges and dances have encapsulated the spirit of a global community with the ‘Jerusalema’ dance being no exception. The rise of this particular viral sensation was at the detriment of the Achilles tendons of three middle aged gentlemen on who we base our case series. PRESENTATION OF CASES: Over the space of ten days three cases of Achilles tendon rupture repair presented to the emergency department in Midlands Regional Hospital Tullamore (MRHT) with the mechanism of tendon rupture being through the ‘Jerusalema’ dance. These patients were surgically managed in line with local institution practice and postoperative outcomes were good with no complications noted. Follow up is ongoing. CLINICAL DISCUSSION: This retrospective case series is based on the impact of the ‘Jerusalema Dance’ on presentations of Achilles tendon rupture to the Emergency Department in a single regional hospital from January to March 2021. We used these cases in conjunction with a review of current literature to highlight the benefit of an integrated Achilles Tendon rehabilitation programme in this at-risk patient cohort. CONCLUSION: This paper highlights the dangers inherent when well intentioned, but physically deconditioned individuals endeavour to perform a physical exercise which is deceptively demanding. Going forward, viral challenges such as the ‘Jerusalema’ may contribute to new and interesting mechanisms of injuries in our ‘weekend warrior’ cohort. In addition to this, given the global deconditioning seen due to the COVID 19 pandemic and subsequent lockdowns we may see a higher rate of Achilles tendon injuries in the near future across a multitude of patient cohorts. Level one evidence suggests that conservative treatment is just as effective as surgical treatments in the majority of patients with an Achilles tendon rupture, as long as a protocol of rehabilitation with early weightbearing is performed. Our accelerated rehabilitation programme in MRHT is in line with others however internal audit and new literature in the future may enable us to refine it further.","Roopnarinesingh, Ryan; Kenyon, Robert; Turley, Luke; Feeley, Aoife; Bayer, Thomas; Merghani, Khalid",Int J Surg Case Rep,430,17

Endometriosis, the main cause for chronic pelvic pain (CPP), is a highly prevalent disease characterized by the presence of endometrial tissue in locations outside the uterine cavity that affects up to 10% of women in their reproductive age. This study aimed to explore the effects of the global COVID-19 pandemic on patients suffering from endometriosis across multiple countries, and to investigate the different approaches to the medical management of these patients based on their self- reported experiences. Methods A cross-sectional survey, partially based on validated quality of life questionnaires for endometriosis patients, was initially created in English, which was then reviewed by experts. Through the process of assessing face and content validity, the questionnaire was then translated to fifteen different languages following the WHO recommendations for medical translation. After evaluation, the questionnaire was converted into a web form and distributed across different platforms. An analysis of 2964 responses of participants from 59 countries suffering from self-reported endometriosis was then conducted. Results The data shows an association between COVID-19 imposed compromises with the reported worsening of the mental state of the participants, as well as with the aggravation of their symptoms. For the 1174 participants who had their medical appointments cancelled, 43.7% (n=513) reported that their symptoms had been aggravated, and 49.3% (n=579) reported that their mental state had worsened. In comparison, of the 1180 participants who kept their appointments, only 29.4% (n=347) stated that their symptoms had been aggravated, and 27.5% (n=325) stated their mental health had worsened. 610 participants did not have medical appointments scheduled, and these participants follow a similar pattern as the participants who kept their appointments, with 29.0% (n=177) reporting aggravation of symptoms and 28.2% (n=172) reporting that their mental state had worsened. Conclusions These findings suggest that COVID-19 pandemic has had a clinically significant negative effect on the mental and physical well-being of participants suffering from endometriosis based on their self-reported experiences. Thus, they show the importance of further assessment and reevaluation of the current and future management of this condition in medical practices worldwide.

In this study, we described a new member of alphaCoV (BtCoV/Rh/YN2012) in bats with unique genome features. Unique accessory genes, ORF4a and ORF4b were found between the spike gene and the envelope gene, while ORF8 gene was found downstream of the nucleocapsid gene. All the putative genes were further confirmed by reverse-transcription analyses. One unique gene at the 3’ end of the BtCoV/Rh/YN2012 genome, ORF9, exhibits ~30% amino acid identity to ORF7a of the SARS-related coronavirus. Functional analysis showed ORF4a protein can activate IFN-β production, whereas ORF3a can regulate NF-κB production. We also screened the spike-mediated virus entry using the spike-pseudotyped retroviruses system, although failed to find any fully permissive cells. Our results expand the knowledge on the genetic diversity of bat coronaviruses.

We begin by developing an over‐representative item list in a qualitative study, wherein participants’ responses are used to develop items to ensure content relevance. This item list is then reduced via exploratory factor analysis in a second study, and the eight dimensions of the scale are supported. We also support the validity of the FMPS, as the scale significantly relates to both face mask wearing and health perceptions. We lastly confirm the factor structure of the FMPS in a third study via confirmatory factor analysis. From these efforts, we identify an avenue that social scientists can aid in preventing coronavirus and illness more broadly – by studying face mask perceptions and behaviours.","Howard, Matt C.",Br J Health Psychol,430,22

We conducted two meta-analyses to evaluate the association between HCQ (with or without azithromycin (AZM)) and total mortality in COVID-19 patients. Methods: Articles were retrieved until October 20th, 2020 by searching in seven databases. Data were combined using the general variance-based method on relative risk estimates. Results: A total of 26 articles were found (N=44,521 COVID-19 patients, including N=7,324 from 4 randomized clinical trials (RCTs)); 10 studies were valuable for analysing the association of HCQ+AZM. Overall, the use of HCQ was associated with 21% lower mortality risk (pooled risk ratio: 0.79, 95%CI: 0.67 to 0.93; high level of heterogeneity: I2=82%, random effects). This association vanished (1.10, 95%CI: 0.99 to 1.23 and 1.10, 95%CI: 0.99 to 1.23) when daily dose >400 mg or total dose >4,400 mg were used, respectively).

As detailed in the IHR, the World Health Organization drew on official reports from Member States as well as unofficial sources (e.g. media alerts) to quickly report and disseminate information about the appearance of the novel influenza virus. The pre-existing Global Influenza Surveillance Network for virological surveillance also provided crucial information for rapid development of a vaccine and for detection of changes in the virus. However, the pandemic also highlighted a number of shortcomings in global epidemiological surveillance for respiratory disease. These included the lack of standards for reporting illness, risk factor and mortality data, and a mechanism for systematic reporting of epidemiological data. Such measures would have facilitated direct comparison of data between countries and improved timely understanding of the characteristics and impact of the pandemic.

Results: A total of 398 HCWs completed the questionnaire. Only 45% of the participants had correct knowledge about the agent while about 97% knew that close contact with infected person is the most important risk factor. Only 63% had correct knowledge about the role of antibiotics in COVID-19 treatment. Majority of the HCWs were worried and most frequently reported worry was risk to family. Carrying infection to home was most commonly reported fear, 92%. Cleaning hands often or always was 11.5% and 87% respectively. About 71% wore mask during work. Knowledge was better among physicians compared to non-physicians while attitude and practices were comparable between the two groups. Conclusion: We found that there was poor knowledge about causative agent and role of antibiotics for COVID-19 but for mode of transmission and prevention there was good knowledge.

The interactions between passengers and drivers facilitated by rideshare platforms such as Uber are, essentially, a series of partially standardized, random experiments of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Rideshare companies share data with government health agencies, but no statistical method is available to aggregate these data for the systematic study of the transmission dynamics of COVID-19. Methods: We develop a proof-of-concept model for the analysis of data from rideshare interactions merged with COVID-19 diagnosis records. Using simulated data with rideshare volumes, disease prevalence, and diagnosis rates based on a large US city, we use the model to test hypotheses about the emergence of viral strains and their transmission characteristics in the presence of non-pharmaceutical interventions and superspreaders. Findings: Data from 10 simulated trials of SARS-CoV-2 propagation within the Los Angeles rideshare network resulted in an average of 190,387.1 potentially infectious rideshare interactions. Assuming access to data on 25% of the total estimated infections (Partial Reporting), these interactions resulted in an average of 409.0 diagnosed rideshare infections given our transmission model assumptions. For each of the 10 simulated trials, analysis given Partial Reporting could consistently differentiate between a baseline strain and an emergent, more infectious viral strain, enabling hypothesis testing about transmission characteristics. Interpretation: Simulated evaluation of a novel statistical model suggests that rideshare data combined with COVID-19 diagnosis data have the potential to automate continued surveillance of emergent novel strains of SARS-CoV-2 and their transmission characteristics.","Safranek, C.

The aim of our study was to determine risk factors for different liver injury patterns and to evaluate the relationship between liver injury patterns and prognosis in patients with COVID-19. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed patients admitted between January 1st to March 10th, with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and followed them up to April 20th, 2020. Information of clinical features of patients was collected for analysis. Results: As a result, a total of 838 hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19, including 48.8% (409/838) patients with normal liver function and 51.2% (429/838) patients with liver injury were analyzed. Abnormal liver function tests are associated with organ injuries, hypoxia, inflammation, and the use of antiviral drugs. Hepatocellular injury pattern was associated with hypoxia. The mortality of the hepatocellular injury pattern, cholestatic pattern and mixed pattern were 25, 28.2, and 22.3%, respectively, while the death rate was only 6.1% in the patients without liver injury. Multivariate analyses showed that liver injury with cholestatic pattern and mixed pattern were associated with increased mortality risk. Conclusions: Our study confirmed that hepatocellular injury pattern that may be induced by hypoxia was not risk factor for mortality in SARS-COV-2 infection, while liver injury with mixed pattern and cholestatic pattern that might be induced by SARS-CoV-2 directly might be potential risk factors for increased mortality in COVID-19 patients.","Chu, Huikuan; Bai, Tao; Chen, Liuying; Hu, Lilin; Xiao, Li; Yao, Lin; Zhu, Rui; Niu, Xiaohui; Li, Zhonglin; Zhang, Lei; Han, Chaoqun; Song, Shuangning; He, Qi; Zhao, Ying; Zhu, Qingjing; Chen, Hua; Schnabl, Bernd; Yang, Ling; Hou, Xiaohua",Front Med (Lausanne),430,20

COVID-19 has spread across the world since early 2020, becoming a serious global health threat to life, safety, and social and economic activities. However, insufficient RWD from patients was available to help clinicians efficiently diagnose and treat patients with COVID-19, or to provide necessary information to the government for policy-making. Countries that saw a rapid surge of infections had to focus on leveraging medical professionals to treat patients, and the circumstances made it even more difficult to promptly use COVID-19 RWD. Against this backdrop, the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service (HIRA) of Korea decided to open its COVID-19 RWD collected through Korea’s universal health insurance program, under the title of the COVID-19 International Collaborative Research Project. The dataset, consisting of 476 508 claim statements from 234 427 patients (7590 confirmed cases) and 18 691 318 claim statements of the same patients for the previous 3 years, was established and hosted on HIRA’s in-house server. Researchers who applied to participate in the project uploaded analysis code on the platform prepared by HIRA, and HIRA conducted the analysis and provided outcome values.

However, tissue biopsies are invasive and limited by inaccuracies due to sampling locations, restricted sampling frequency, and poor representation of tissue heterogeneity. Liquid biopsies are emerging as a complementary approach to traditional tissue biopsies to detect dynamic changes in specific cell populations. Cell-free DNA (cfDNA) fragments released into the circulation from dying cells can be traced back to the tissues and cell types they originated from using DNA methylation, an epigenetic regulatory mechanism that is highly cell-type specific. Decoding changes in the cellular origins of cfDNA over time can reveal altered host tissue homeostasis due to local cancer invasion and metastatic spread to distant organs as well as treatment responses. In addition to host-derived cfDNA, changes in cancer cells can be detected from cell-free, circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) by monitoring DNA mutations carried by cancer cells. Here, we will discuss computational approaches to identify and validate robust biomarkers of changed tissue homeostasis using cell-free, methylated DNA in the circulation. We highlight studies performing genome-wide profiling of cfDNA methylation and those that combine genetic and epigenetic markers to further identify cell-type specific signatures. Finally, we discuss opportunities and current limitations of these approaches for implementation in clinical oncology.","Barefoot, Megan E.; Loyfer, Netanel; Kiliti, Amber J.; McDeed, A.

This survey aimed to assess the psychological impact of the state of emergency. We estimated changes in mental health, quality of life, and unemployment experience for general workers during the first COVID-19 outbreak in Japan. METHODS: We conducted a nationwide follow-up study. During the periods of March 26 to April 6, 2020 and June 26 to July 2, 2020, we used the internet to survey general workers aged 15 to 59 years in Japan. The questionnaire items covered employment status and socioeconomic factors, and we used the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) and EQ-5D-5L to assess depression and health-related quality of life (HR-QOL), respectively. The differences in outcomes of permanent and non-permanent workers were analyzed using propensity score analysis. A multiple linear regression analysis was performed to examine the relationship between unemployment and CES-D scores. RESULTS: We included 2351 subjects in the analysis. Changes in both CES-D scores and utility were not significantly different between the two groups. However, a significant difference was found regarding the rate of unemployment, which was associated with higher CES-D scores. CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrated that the mental health of non-permanent workers was not negatively affected following the state of emergency due to COVID-19 in Japan. Unemployment is an important factor that influences the mental health of general workers.","Saito, Shota; Tran, Huyen Thi Thanh; Qi, Ruan; Suzuki, Kenji; Takiguchi, Toru; Ishigami, Kazuo; Noto, Shinichi; Ohde, Sachiko; Takahashi, Osamu",BMC Public Health,430,32

By identifying further overlaps with association signals influencing gene expression and cell surface protein levels, it has also been possible, in several cases, to identify causal genes and infer candidate proteins affecting immune cell traits linked to autoimmune disease risk. Overall, these results provide a more detailed picture of how genetic variation affects the human immune system and autoimmune disease risk. They also highlight druggable proteins in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases; predict the efficacy and side effects of existing therapies; provide new indications for use for some of them; and optimize the research and development of new, more effective and safer treatments for autoimmune diseases.

At present it is unknown whether the risk for respiratory disease (BRD) or neonatal calf diarrhea (NCD) in the veal herd is associated with total immunoglobulin (Ig) and/or on the serostatus for respiratory pathogens measured at arrival. Therefore, the first objective of this prospective longitudinal cohort study was to determine associations between serum protein fractions as determined by routine electrophoresis (total protein, albumin, alpha-1 and -2 globulins, beta-globulins and Ig's) at arrival and BRD and NCD in the first 3 weeks of the production cycle. The second objective was to determine whether the serostatus (seropositive/seronegative) of seven respiratory pathogens (bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), parainfluenzavirus-3, bovine coronavirus (BCV), bovine herpesvirus-1, bovine viral diarrhea virus, Mannheimia haemolytica and Mycoplasma bovis) of these arrival serum samples could be associated with the risk of having BRD. The third objective was to determine which of the electrophoresis proteins and respiratory serostatuses were associated with average daily gain (ADG) in the study period. The study population consisted of 150 rosé veal calves housed in a single air–space. The study period ended at day 18 post arrival, when BRD incidence was judged to be too high to further postpone a group treatment. A Cox regression model was used to determine the effect of the studied protein fractions and antibodies on the time to BRD and NCD occurrence. The effect of the studied predictors on ADG was determined by linear regression. Calves with Ig levels under 7.5 g/L had an increased BRD hazard (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.9 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.2–3.0)). NCD was only positively associated with the alpha-2 globulin concentration. Calves with a negative serostatus for BCV (HR = 1.7 (95% CI = 1.0–2.8)) or BRSV (HR = 2.0 (95% CI = 1.0–3.9)) had an increased BRD hazard. Average daily gain (ADG) was 0.242 kg/day (SD = 0.142) and was not related to the occurrence of BRD or NCD. Calves with Ig's below 7.5 g/L and with increased levels of alpha-2 globulins showed a decrease in ADG. This study showed the importance of providing sufficient colostrum to veal calves and the potential benefit of the presence of BCV and BRSV antibodies at arrival to reduce the BRD hazard in the first 3 weeks.","Pardon, Bart; Alliët, Jeroen; Boone, Randy; Roelandt, Sophie; Valgaeren, Bonnie; Deprez, Piet",Prev Vet Med,430,30

We aimed to further clarify the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 2019-nCoV pneumonia. METHODS: In this retrospective, single-centre study, we included all confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV in Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital from Jan 1 to Jan 20, 2020. Cases were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR and were analysed for epidemiological, demographic, clinical, and radiological features and laboratory data. Outcomes were followed up until Jan 25, 2020. FINDINGS: Of the 99 patients with 2019-nCoV pneumonia, 49 (49%) had a history of exposure to the Huanan seafood market. The average age of the patients was 55·5 years (SD 13·1), including 67 men and 32 women. 2019-nCoV was detected in all patients by real-time RT-PCR. 50 (51%) patients had chronic diseases. Patients had clinical manifestations of fever (82 [83%] patients), cough (81 [82%] patients), shortness of breath (31 [31%] patients), muscle ache (11 [11%] patients), confusion (nine [9%] patients), headache (eight [8%] patients), sore throat (five [5%] patients), rhinorrhoea (four [4%] patients), chest pain (two [2%] patients), diarrhoea (two [2%] patients), and nausea and vomiting (one [1%] patient). According to imaging examination, 74 (75%) patients showed bilateral pneumonia, 14 (14%) patients showed multiple mottling and ground-glass opacity, and one (1%) patient had pneumothorax. 17 (17%) patients developed acute respiratory distress syndrome and, among them, 11 (11%) patients worsened in a short period of time and died of multiple organ failure. INTERPRETATION: The 2019-nCoV infection was of clustering onset, is more likely to affect older males with comorbidities, and can result in severe and even fatal respiratory diseases such as acute respiratory distress syndrome. In general, characteristics of patients who died were in line with the MuLBSTA score, an early warning model for predicting mortality in viral pneumonia. Further investigation is needed to explore the applicability of the MuLBSTA score in predicting the risk of mortality in 2019-nCoV infection.

Cultures take several days to return a result and organisms frequently fail to grow. In critically ill patients this leads to the use of empiric, broad-spectrum antimicrobials and mitigates against stewardship. Methods Single ICU observational cohort study with contemporaneous comparator group. We developed and implemented a TaqMan array card (TAC) covering 52 respiratory pathogens in ventilated patients undergoing bronchoscopic investigation for suspected pneumonia. The time to result was compared against conventional culture, and sensitivity compared to conventional microbiology and metagenomic sequencing. We observed the clinician decisions in response to array results, comparing antibiotic free days (AFD) between the study cohort and comparator group. Findings 95 patients were enrolled with 71 forming the comparator group. TAC returned results 61 hours (IQR 42-90) faster than culture. The test had an overall sensitivity of 93% (95% CI 88-97%) compared to a combined standard of conventional culture and metagenomic sequencing, with 100% sensitivity for most individual organisms. In 54% of cases the TAC results altered clinical management, with 62% of changes leading to de-escalation, 30% to an increase in spectrum, and investigations for alternative diagnoses in 9%. There was a significant difference in the distribution of AFDs with more AFDs in the TAC group (p=0.02).

The current mortality rate is 5.4%, with 1 056 159 people infected worldwide. The disease is reminiscent of SARS in 2002, from which the healthcare system of Singapore has garnered many lessons and applied them in the current climate. As a result of the high transmissibility of the virus, hospitals in Singapore have reduced clinic loads and elective treatments to halt propagation of the virus and also to allow redistribution of healthcare workforce to the frontline. Cancer patients, who are often immunocompromised, are at risk of contracting the disease and becoming seriously ill.

Low viral load in the nasal cavity due to open air ventilation is a plausible reason for this difference. The transmission of SARS-CoV-2 occurs through respiratory droplets and fomites. There is ample evidence that the virus is airborne as well. The biggest factor in the transmission of SARS-C-V-2 are asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic carriers. Lack of open air ventilation is a major compounding factor as the virus remains in the environment, especially on fomites, leading to regular and repeated exposure to the virus. As a result, people living in developed countries tend to build up high viral load in their nasal cavity and nasopharynx. Studies have clearly shown that the severity of COVID-19 is directly proportional to the viral load harbored in the upper respiratory tract. These factors indicate a strong association between high viral load and poor ventilation, which, in turn, leads to high mortality from COVID-19 in developed Western nations.","Aggarwal, Shyam; Aggarwal, Shreyas; Aggarwal, Anita; Jain, Kriti; Minhas, Sachin",Asia Pac J Public Health,430,30

This paper presents an epidemiological analysis of the first phase of the COVID-19 epidemic in Poland. MATERIAL/METHODS: This cross-sectional study was carried out between 3 and 27 March 2020 on a sample of 1389 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases in Poland. Data were obtained from epidemiological reports collected by the Chief Sanitary Inspectorate. Analysis includes the number of COVID-19 cases, number of deaths, number of hospitalizations, number of people quarantined, and number of laboratory tests performed. RESULTS: The first case was confirmed on 4 March 2020. Over 24 days after the first case, the total number of confirmed infections rose to 1389 (34,000 laboratory tests were performed). The highest incidence rates (over 5 per 100,000) were observed in the 2 central administrative regions (Mazowieckie and Łódzkie) and in the south-western region of Dolnośląskie, which borders the Czech Republic and Germany. Based on available data about age and sex, a clearly higher incidence was observed in the 20–29 years (4.0 per 100,000), 40–49 years (4.1 per 100,000), and 50–59 years (4.3 per 100,000) age groups. In the period analyzed (24 days), there were 16 confirmed deaths (average age 65.5 years; 81.2% males). CONCLUSIONS: The proportion of women and men with confirmed COVID-19 infection was similar to the sex ratio in the general population. Infections were relatively less common in those aged under 20 years. The largest numbers of confirmed cases were detected in 3 of the 4 largest cities, each of which has an international airport.","Gujski, Mariusz; Raciborski, Filip; Jankowski, Mateusz; Nowicka, Paulina Maria; Rakocy, Kamil; Pinkas, Jarosław",Med Sci Monit,430,26

Empirical evidence on the dynamics of reliance on scientists and public health authorities during the early phases of an epidemic outbreak is limited. We examine these processes during the COVID-19 outbreak in Italy by leveraging data from Twitter and two online surveys, including a survey experiment. We find that reliance on experts followed a curvilinear path. Both Twitter and survey data showed initial increases in information-seeking from expert sources in the three weeks after the detection of the first case. Consistent with these increases, knowledge about health information linked to COVID-19 and support for containment measures was widespread, and better knowledge was associated with stronger support for containment policies. Both knowledge and containment support were positively associated with trust in science and public health authorities. However, in the third week after the outbreak, we detected a slowdown in responsiveness to experts. These processes were corroborated with a survey experiment, which showed that those holding incorrect beliefs about COVID-19 gave no greater – or even lower – importance to information when its source was stated as coming from experts than when the source was unstated. Our results suggest weakened trust in public health authorities with prolonged exposure to the epidemic as a potential mechanism for this effect. Weakened responsiveness to expert sources may increase susceptibility to misinformation and our results call for efforts to sustain trust in adapting public health response.","Battiston, Pietro; Kashyap, Ridhi; Rotondi, Valentina",SSM Popul Health,430,16

Although the microbiology of the nasopharynx is an important determinant of the complications of URI, little is known of the nasopharyngeal (NP) microbiota of children, the factors that affect its composition, and its precise relationship with URI. RESULTS: Healthy children (n = 47) aged 49–84 months from a prospective cohort study based in Wisconsin, USA, were examined. Demographic and clinical data and NP swab samples were obtained from participants upon entry to the study. All NP samples were profiled for bacterial microbiota using a phylogenetic microarray, and these data were related to demographic characteristics and upper respiratory health outcomes. The composition of the NP bacterial community of children was significantly related prior to the history of acute sinusitis (R(2) = 0.070, P < 0.009). History of acute sinusitis was associated with significant depletion in relative abundance of taxa including Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and Akkermansia spp. and enrichment of Moraxella nonliquefaciens. Enrichment of M. nonliquefaciens was also a characteristic of baseline NP samples of children who subsequently developed acute sinusitis over the 1-year study period. Time to develop URI was significantly positively correlated with NP diversity, and children who experienced more frequent URIs exhibited significantly diminished NP microbiota diversity (P ≤ 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary data suggest that previous history of acute sinusitis influences the composition of the NP microbiota, characterized by a depletion in relative abundance of specific taxa. Diminished diversity was associated with more frequent URIs.

We selected COVID-19 observational studies from eight countries, including, China, Italy, Australia, Canada, Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, and the USA, comprising a total of 13 studies and performed a meta-analysis for age, gender, fatality rate, and clinical symptoms of fever, cough, shortness of breath, and diarrhea. The meta-analysis shows that there are differences in symptoms and other characteristics reported by the patients of COVID-19 inside and outside China. Patients in China have a higher proportion of fever, cough, and shortness of breath as compared to patients outside of China. However, we found the opposite results for the gastrointestinal symptoms such as Diarrhea. Patients outside of China have a significantly higher proportion of Diarrhea as compared to patients within China. We also observed gender disparity among our studies, with the male population being more susceptible than the female population. Moreover, the analysis suggests that the fatality rate in China is relatively lower as compared to the fatality rate in other countries. These findings also suggest that the clinical symptoms of COVID-19 should not be generalized to fever, shortness of breath, and cough only but other symptoms such as diarrhea are also prevalent in patients with COVID-19.","Ahmed, Ali; Ali, Areeba; Hasan, Sana",Front Public Health,430,6

The highest concentration of APPs was detected in affected cats, confirming the role of these proteins in supporting a clinical diagnosis of FIP. Repeated samplings from both FIP affected and FCoV-exposed cats showed that when FIP appeared in the group, all the cats had increased APP levels. This increase persisted only in cats that developed FIP (in spite of a decrease in α(2)-globulins) but it was only transient in FCoV-exposed cats, in which a long lasting increase in α(2)-globulins was observed.

This qualitative study sought to understand the impact of the early stages of the pandemic (February-August 2020) from AL administrators’ perspectives. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Semi-structured phone interviews were conducted with 40 AL administrators in Oregon. A stratified sampling method emphasizing rurality, profit status, Medicaid acceptance, and memory care (MC) designation was used to maximize variation in perspectives. We asked eight questions aimed at understanding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on their roles and AL residents and their families, as well as AL operations, such as staffing and resource procurement. Audio-recorded interviews were transcribed and analyzed using an iterative thematic analysis. RESULTS: We identified three themes that characterize AL administrators’ response to COVID-19: emotion and burn-out management, information management, and crisis management. Based on their experiences, administrators made suggestions for managing future crises. DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Our findings demonstrate the slow-burning but devastating impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in AL communities similar to recent findings in nursing homes. Coupled with the limited resources, perceived external pressures, and the ongoing pandemic, many administrators were managing but not thriving in these domains. AL as a care setting, and the role of administrators, requires more scholarly and policy attention, especially regarding emergency preparedness and response.","Kyler-Yano, Jason Z; Tunalilar, Ozcan; Hasworth, Serena; Kohon, Jacklyn; Winfree, Jaclyn; Wilton, Riley; Tuttle, Aliza; Carder, Paula",Gerontologist,430,31

Although social support could relief burnout syndrome, its effect on learning burnout in medical students remains unclear. The objectives of the study are to evaluate the association between learning burnout and social support in Chinese medical students. Methods: A cross-sectional online survey was distributed to students who participated in online learning in a medical college in Wuhan during the COVID-19 epidemic. We used the Lian version of the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) to assess learning burnout and the Social Support Rating Scale (SSRS) to assess social support. Chi-square tests were used to analyze factors associated with burnout. Independent t-test and multiple logistic regression were explored to analyze the relationship between social support and burnout. Results: A total of 684 students have completed the survey (response rate: 30.9%), of which 315 (46.12%) met standard criteria for learning burnout. Multiple logistic regression analysis has revealed that seniors, low family income and low social support were significant predictors of learning burnout (χ(2) = 41.983, p < 0.001). After adjusting for the grade and family income, there was a significant and relevant association between social support and learning burnout (OR = 0.937; 95% CI: 0.905–0.970; p < 0.001). Conclusions: Learning burnout was highly prevalent in medical students at our college. Senior students and low family income might be risk factors for learning burnout. Social support, especially subjective support and utilization of support might play a protective role in reducing the risk of learning burnout.","Zhang, Jia-Yu; Shu, Tao; Xiang, Ming; Feng, Zhan-Chun",Front Psychol,430,16

The major protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2 is considered a promising target, based on previous results from related CoVs with lopinavir (LPV), an HIV protease inhibitor. However, limited evidence exists for other clinically approved antiretroviral protease inhibitors, such as atazanavir (ATV). ATV is of high interest because of its bioavailability within the respiratory tract. Our results show that ATV could dock in the active site of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, with greater strength than LPV. ATV blocked Mpro activity. We confirmed that ATV inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication, alone or in combination with ritonavir (RTV) in Vero cells, human pulmonary epithelial cell line and primary monocytes, impairing virus-induced enhancement of IL-6 and TNF-α levels.

As a result, “small” independent retailers operating in urban environments have suffered a substantial reduction of their turnover. This situation could be presumably reversed if retailers were to establish business “alliances” targeting economies of scale and engage themselves in providing innovative digital services. The SMARTBUY ecosystem realizes the concept of a “distributed shopping mall”, which allows retailers to join forces and unite in a large commercial coalition that generates added value for both retailers and customers. Along this line, the SMARTBUY ecosystem offers several novel features: (i) inventory management of centralized products and services, (ii) geo-located marketing of products and services, (iii) location-based search for products offered by neighboring retailers, and (iv) personalized recommendations for purchasing products derived by an innovative recommendation system.

We sought to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on Hungarian IS care during the two epidemic waves. This retrospective observational study was based on a nationwide reimbursement database that encompasses all IS admissions and all reperfusion interventions, i.e., intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) and endovascular therapy (EVT) from 2 January 2017 to 31 December 2020 in Hungary. COVID-19 pandemic’s effect on the number of IS admissions and reperfusion interventions were analyzed using different statistics: means, medians, trends, relative rates, and linear relationships. The mean and median values of IS admissions and reperfusion interventions decreased only in some measure during the COVID-periods. However, trend analysis demonstrated a significant decline from the trends. The decline’s dynamic and amplitude have differed for each variable. In contrast to IVT, the number of IS admissions and EVTs negatively correlated with the epidemic waves’ amplitude. Besides, the decrease in the number of IS admissions was more pronounced than the decrease in the number of reperfusion interventions.

We hypothesized that a combination of inflammatory markers would differentiate between severe and mild disease in RSV-infected children. METHODS: Blood and nasopharyngeal samples from 52 RSV-infected children were collected during acute infection and after recovery. Retrospectively, patients were categorized into three groups based on disease severity: mild (no supportive treatment), moderate (supplemental oxygen and/or nasogastric feeding), and severe (mechanical ventilation). Clinical data, number of flow-defined leukocyte subsets, and cytokine concentrations were compared. RESULTS: Children with severe RSV infection were characterized by young age; lymphocytopenia; increased interleukin (IL)-8, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), and IL-6 concentrations; and decreased chemokine (C-C motif) ligand (CCL-5) concentrations in plasma. The combination of plasma levels of IL-8 and CCL-5, and CD4(+) T-cell counts, with cutoff values of 67 pg/ml, 13 ng/ml, and 2.3 × 10(6)/ml, respectively, discriminated severe from mild RSV infection with 82% sensitivity and 96% specificity.

Although RT-qPCR is rapid and sensitive, there is no standard method yet, there are no certified quantification standards, and experiments are conducted using different assays, reagents, instruments, and data analysis protocols. These variations can induce errors in quantitative data reports, thereby potentially misleading interpretations, and conclusions. We review the SARS-CoV-2 wastewater surveillance literature focusing on variability of RT-qPCR data as revealed by inconsistent standard curves and associated parameters.

It can have extensive impacts on peoples’ lives that may occur through the living environment, health and mental well-being, and which are requiring constant adaptation. OBJECTIVES: The overall purpose of this research was to evaluate the impacts of climate change and permafrost thaw on mental wellness in Disko Bay, Greenland. It contained two parts: multidisciplinary fieldwork and a questionnaire survey. The aim of the fieldwork was to learn about life and living conditions and to understand what it is like to live in a community that faces impacts of climate change and permafrost thaw. For the questionnaire the aim was to find out which perceived environmental and adaptation factors relate to very good self-rated well-being, quality of life and satisfaction with life. ANALYSIS: Fieldwork data was analyzed by following a thematic analysis, and questionnaire data statistically by cross-tabulation. First, the associations between perceived environmental and adaptation factors were studied either by the Pearson χ(2) test or by Fisher's exact test. Second, binary logistic regression analysis was applied to examine more in depth the associations between perceived environmental/adaptation variables and self-rated very good well-being, satisfaction with life and quality of life. The binary logistic regression analysis was conducted in two phases: as univariate and multivariate analyses. RESULTS: Nature and different activities in nature were found to be important to local people, and results suggest that they increase mental wellness, specifically well-being and satisfaction with life. Challenges associated with permafrost thaw, such as changes in the physical environment, infrastructure and impacts on culture were recognized in everyday life.

Concern regarding potential aerosolisation during invasive procedures have been raised – including the use of pneumoperitoneum to facilitate laparoscopy. The aim of this study is to systematically review the data available to date regarding the potential risk posed to theatre staff by laparoscopy. METHOD: A systematic review and meta-analysis was carried out in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. Only publications in peer-reviewed journals were considered.

RESULTS: 4209 records were identified, resulting in 9 unique studies being selected. The included studies examined viral DNA aerosoliation generated by electrosurgery and CO(2) laser ablation, with one study examining viral DNA aerosolisation following laparoscopy. Each of these demonstrated that viral DNA (Hepatitis B Virus and Human Papilloma Virus) was detectable in the surgical smoke plume. CONCLUSION: The data and analysis reported in this study reflect the most up-to-date evidence available for the surgeon to assess risk towards healthcare staff.

On the one hand, there is the chronic demyelinating inflammation caused by the autoimmune cascade of multiple sclerosis, while on the other hand, according to the latest research, it has been shown that obesity shares an inflammatory component with most chronic diseases. Methods: The authors performed independent research of the available literature in the most important electronic databases (PubMed, Google Scholar, Embase, and Science Direct) in February 2021. After applying the exclusion criteria, the reviewers focused on the most relevant articles published during the last 10 years with respect to epidemiology and pathophysiology. Results: The data presented are a step forward in trying to elucidate the intricate relationship between obesity and MS, especially the causal relationship between childhood and adolescent obesity and MS, focusing on the epidemiological associations observed in the most relevant observational studies conducted in recent years. In the second part, the authors comment on the latest findings related to the pathophysiological mechanisms that may explain the correlations between obesity and multiple sclerosis, focusing also on the role of adipokines. Conclusions: Based on available epidemiological data, obesity in early life appears to be strongly associated with a higher risk of MS development, independent of other risk factors. Although much research has been done on the pathophysiology of obesity, MS, their possible common mechanism, and the role of adipokines, further studies are needed in order to explain what remains unknown. No relevant data were found regarding the association between obesity, disability (high EDSS score), and mortality risk in MS patients. Thus, we consider that this topic should be elucidated in future research.","Schreiner, Thomas-Gabriel; Genes, Tudor-Marcel",J Clin Med,430,1

In the epidemic of COVID-19, many patients admitted to hospitals for other reasons may be silent carriers of COVID-19 and have the risk of infecting medical personnel. Thus, meticulous personal protection measures should be considered in suspicious patients, especially when close contact with the patient’s airway is anticipated. We introduce two airway trauma patients suspected of COVID-19 who required emergency tracheostomy. Patient one was a 29-year-old man who suffered facial trauma following a car accident. A chest CT scan showed peripheral ground-glass opacities suggestive for COVID-19. The second patient was a young elevator mechanic who experienced maxillofacial trauma after an elevator crash.

However, to date there has been limited research that has explored teen girls’ experiences of receiving unwanted penis images in depth. To address this gap we draw upon our findings from a qualitative study using focus group interviews and arts based drawing methods to explore social media image sharing practices with 144 young people aged 11–18 in seven secondary schools in England. We argue that being bombarded with unwanted dick pics on social media platforms like Snapchat normalises harassing practices as signs of desirability and popularity for girls, but suggest that being sent unsolicited dick pics from boys at school is more difficult for girls to manage or report than ignoring or blocking random older senders. We also found that due to sexual double standards girls were not able to leverage dick pics for status in the same way boys can use girls’ nudes as social currency, since girls faced the possibility of being shamed for being known recipients of dick pics. Finally we explore how some girls challenge abusive elements of toxic masculinity in the drawing sessions and our conclusion argues that unwanted dick pics should always be understood as forms of image based sexual harassment.","Ringrose, Jessica; Regehr, Kaitlyn; Whitehead, Sophie",Sex Roles,430,16

Multiple reports note delayed COVID-19 arterial and venous thromboembolic complications. However, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of such a simultaneous finding after COVID-19. CASE SUMMARY: A 60-year-old male patient, with a history of Type II diabetes and no risk factors for thromboembolism, experienced simultaneous acute myocardial infarction, bilateral pulmonary embolism, and acute ischaemic stroke. The occurrence of these multi-systemic thromboembolic events made us rule out differential diagnoses of thrombophilia, systemic lupus erythematosus, antiphospholipid syndrome, vasculitis, cancer, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and paradoxical embolism through a patent foramen ovale. On laboratory analysis, the patient was positive for IgG SARS-COV2 antibodies, but negative for IgM antibodies and had two negative nasal polymerase chain reaction swab tests. After thorough aetiological investigation, the most probable diagnosis was thought to be delayed complications of COVID-19 infection. DISCUSSION: Multiple mechanisms, such as endothelial dysfunction, complement activation, and virus-induced antiphospholipid syndrome, may explain the hypercoagulable state related to COVID-19. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of concomitant multi-systemic thrombosis development, recognized as a delayed complication of COVID-19 infection. This highlights a need among cardiologists for an increased awareness of such late-onset complications. It also emphasizes the importance of identifying the optimal duration and dose of prophylactic anticoagulation as well as the characteristics of the population that would benefit from it after COVID-19.","Chakir, Mariame; El Jamili, Mohammed; Boudhar, Zainab; El Hattaoui, Mustapha",Eur Heart J Case Rep,430,33

This motif is a generalized feature of viral fusion proteins and has been exploited in generating antiviral fusion agents. In the present paper, we report structural characters of Env protein from another lentivirus, bovine immunodeficiency virus (BIV), which contributes to a good animal model of HIV. BIV HR1 and HR2 regions are predicted by two different programs and expressed separately or conjointly in Escherichia coli. Biochemical and biophysical analyses show that the predicted HRs of BIV Env can form a stable trimer-of-hairpins or six-helix bundle just like that formed by feline immunodeficiency virus Env. Cell fusion assay demonstrates that the HR2 peptide of BIV can efficiently inhibit the virus-mediated cell fusion.","Li, Shu; Zhu, Jieqing; Peng, Yu; Cui, Shanshan; Wang, Chunping; Gao, George F.; Tien, Po",Biochem Biophys Res Commun,430,16

Infection possesses unique characteristics that account for this disproportionate degree of fear: it is transmitted rapidly and invisibly; historically, it has accounted for major morbidity and mortality; old forms re-emerge and new forms emerge; and both the media and society are often in awe. Because, in an outbreak, the patient is both a victim and a vector, and because there exists the potential for infringement of personal rights in order to control an outbreak, infection may be viewed (and has been depicted in popular culture) as a foreign invasion. During recent outbreaks, fear, denial, stigmatization and loss have been recorded in the implicated individuals. Stigmatization and discrimination may further involve ethical correlations, and attempts to adress these issues through activism may also have unwarranted effects. Public health initiatives can address the public's fears by increasing health literacy, which can contribute to reducing stigmatization.","Pappas, G.; Kiriaze, I.J.; Giannakis, P.; Falagas, M.E.",Clin Microbiol Infect,430,20

Recent data suggests a high concentration of SARS-Cov2 receptors, ACE2 or TMPRSS2, in nasal epithelium and cornea, which explains person-to-person transmission. We investigated the prevalence of SARS-CoV2 receptors among reproductive tissues by exploring the single-cell sequencing datasets from uterus, myometrium, ovary, fallopian tube, and breast epithelium. We did not detect significant expression of either ACE2 or TMPRSS2 in the normal human myometrium, uterus, ovaries, fallopian tube, or breast. Furthermore, none of the cell types in the female reproductive organs we investigated, showed the co-expression of ACE2 with proteases, TMPRSS2, Cathepsin B (CTSB), and Cathepsin L (CTSL) known to facilitate the entry of SARS2-CoV2 into the host cell. These results suggest that myometrium, uterus, ovaries, fallopian tube, and breast are unlikely to be susceptible to infection by SARS-CoV2. Our findings suggest that COVID-19 is unlikely to contribute to pregnancy-related adverse outcomes such as preterm birth, transmission of COVID-19 through breast milk, oogenesis and female fertility.","Goad, Jyoti; Rudolph, Joshua; Rajkovic, Aleksandar",bioRxiv,430,22

This particularly affected D/deaf healthcare professionals (HCPs), who faced significant communication challenges at work due to the lack of transparent masks or other reasonable adjustments. AIMS: To determine the impact that a lack of transparent masks and reasonable adjustments had on communication, confidence at work and well-being among D/deaf HCPs during the coronavirus pandemic. METHODS: A survey was sent to all members of the ‘UK Deaf Healthcare Professionals Group’ on Facebook, the ‘Healthcare Professionals with Hearing Loss’ listserver and promoted on Social Media. RESULTS: Eighty-three responses were received. Nine (11%) individuals had access to transparent masks. Over three-quarters of respondents reported feeling anxious and fearful of making a mistake due to communication difficulties. Fourteen (17%) were removed from clinical roles due to a lack of reasonable adjustments. One-third felt they would need to consider an alternative career if improvements were not made. Seventy-eight per cent felt the communication needs of D/deaf HCPs had not been met during the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: D/deaf HCPs felt left behind, isolated and frustrated by a lack of transparent masks and reasonable adjustments to meet their communication needs. Loss of experienced, qualified HCPs has a significant economic and workforce impact, particularly during a pandemic.

The current studies were designed to examine whether other activated TLR signals are similarly inhibited by 3α,5α-THP. We report that 3α,5α-THP inhibits selective agonist-mediated activation of TLR2 and TLR7, but not TLR3 signaling in the RAW246.7 macrophage cell line. The TLR4 and TLR7 signals are innately activated in the amygdala and NAc from P rat brains and inhibited by 3α,5α-THP. The TLR2 and TLR3 signals are not activated in P rat brain and they are not affected by 3α,5α-THP. Co-immunoprecipitation studies indicate that 3α,5α-THP inhibits the binding of MyD88 with TLR4 or TLR7 in P rat brain, but the levels of TLR4 co-precipitating with TRIF are not altered by 3α,5α-THP treatment. Collectively, the data indicate that 3α,5α-THP inhibits MyD88- but not TRIF-dependent TLR signal activation and the production of pro-inflammatory mediators through its ability to block TLR-MyD88 binding. These results have applicability to many conditions involving pro-inflammatory TLR activation of cytokines, chemokines, and interferons and support the use of 3α,5α-THP as a therapeutic for inflammatory disease.","Balan, Irina; Aurelian, Laure; Schleicher, Riana; Boero, Giorgia; O’Buckley, Todd; Morrow, A.

Since the first reports of its existence in Africa in the 1950s, more than 1500 scientific publications on the different aspects of the disease and its causative agent have been produced. Analysis of these publications shows that, following a number of studies in the 1960s and 1970s, and in the absence of autochthonous cases in developed countries, the interest of the scientific community remained low. However, in 2005 chikungunya fever unexpectedly re-emerged in the form of devastating epidemics in and around the Indian Ocean.

METHODS: We searched PubMed, Embase, medRxiv, and Cochrane Library for articles published between January 1, 2020, and April 13, 2020. We statistically analyzed the risk factors of the COVID-19 deceased with meta-analysis. RESULTS: A total of 2401 patients in 15 articles were included in this study. Meta-analysis showed that 66.6% of COVID-19 deceased were male, with a median age of 69.9 years. Common symptoms of deceased included fever (70.6–100%), dyspnea (38.89–85.7%), cough (22.4–78%), and fatigue (22–61.9%).

The basic reproduction number, R0, provides a quantitative measure of the transmission potential of a pathogen. Objective: Conduct a scoping review of the available literature providing estimates of R0 for SARS-CoV-2, provide an overview of the drivers of variation in R0 estimates and the considerations taken in the calculation of the parameter. Design: Scoping review of available literature between the 01 December 2019 and 07 May 2020. Data sources: Both peer-reviewed and pre-print articles were searched for on PubMed, Google Scholar, MedRxiv and BioRxiv. Selection criteria: Studies were selected for review if (i) the estimation of R0 represented either the initial stages of the outbreak or the initial stages of the outbreak prior to the onset of widespread population restriction (lockdown), (ii) the exact dates of the study period were provided and (iii) the study provided primary estimates of R0. Results: A total of 20 R0 estimates were extracted from 15 studies. There was substantial variation in the estimates reported. Estimates derived from mathematical models fell within a wider range of 1.94-6.94 than statistical models which fell between the range of 2.2 to 4.4. Several studies made assumptions about the length of the infectious period which ranged from 5.8-20 days and the serial interval which ranged from 4.41-14 days. For a given set of parameters a longer duration of infectiousness or a longer serial interval equates to a higher R0. Several studies took measures to minimise bias in early case reporting, to account for the potential occurrence of super-spreading events, and to account for early sub-exponential epidemic growth. Conclusions: The variation in reported estimates of R0 reflects the complex nature of the parameter itself, including the context (i.e. social/spatial structure), the methodology used to estimate the parameter, and model assumptions. R0 is a fundamental parameter in the study of infectious disease dynamics however it provides limited practical applicability outside of the context in which it was estimated, and should be calculated and interpreted with this in mind.","Barber, A.; Griffin, J.

In addition to managing acute cases, post-COVID-19 persisting symptoms/complaints and different hematological values are of great concern. These have an impact on the patient's well-being and are yet to be evaluated. Therefore, clinical and primary diagnosis based on routine laboratory findings bears high importance during the initial period of COVID-19, especially in regions with fewer diagnostic facilities. Methods: Clinical information and associated complaints of the COVID-19 illness confirmed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were collected directly from the patients. Regular follow-ups were obtained on the phone every 2 weeks following recovery for 20 weeks. Initial hematological and radiology findings of the hospitalized patients except for intensive care unit (ICU) and high dependency units (HDUs) and a follow-up evaluation after 4 weeks following recovery were analyzed. Results: The post-COVID-19 persisting symptoms/complaints were found among 21.4% of symptomatic patients, which persisted for ≥20 weeks and had a significant relationship with the duration of COVID-19 illness and the existing comorbidity (p < 0.05). Post-COVID-19 primary type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM, 0.64%) and hypertension (HTN, 1.28%) and unstable DM (54.55%) and HTN (34.78%) to the pre-existing diabetic and hypertensive patients were observed. Post-recovery remarkable changes in the laboratory values included leukocytosis (16.1%), lymphocytosis (14.5%), and an increased prothrombin time (PT, 25.8%). Abnormalities in the D-dimer, serum ferritin, hemoglobin, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) levels were present to an extent. Laboratory findings like chest X-ray, ESR, white blood cell (WBC) count, lymphocyte count, C-reactive protein (CRP), serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT), serum ferritin, PT, D-dimer, and serum creatinine are important markers for the diagnosis and prognosis of COVID-19 illness (p < 0.05). Conclusion: Post-COVID-19 persisting symptoms and the changes in the laboratory values need to be considered with importance and as a routine clinical measure. Post-COVID-19 periodic follow-up for evaluating the patient's physical condition and the biochemical values should be scheduled with care and managed accordingly to prevent future comorbidity in patients with the post-COVID-19 syndrome.","Mohiuddin Chowdhury, Abu Taiub Mohammed; Karim, Md Rezaul; Ali, Md.

Adults with PH are at potential risk for severe complications and high mortality due to associated comorbidities. It is difficult to extrapolate the outcomes of COVID-19 in adults to pediatric PH patients. Overall, a small number of COVID-19 cases is reported in patients with preexisting PH. Several factors may be responsible for the low incidence of COVID-19 in children with PH. Pulmonary hypertension is a rare disease, testing is not universal, and patients may have followed more rigorously the Center for Disease Control’s guidelines recommended for personal protection with mask-wearing, social distancing, and hand sanitization through ongoing health education. The small number of COVID-19 cases in patients with preexisting PH does not support that PH is protective for COVID-19. However, medications used to treat PH may have some protection against COVID-19. This review discusses the pathophysiology of PH occurring with COVID-19, differences between children and adults with COVID-19, strategies for management of preexisting PH in children during the ongoing pandemic, and its impact within the field of PH.","Das, Bibhuti B",Medicina (Kaunas),430,28

An application of spatial temporal model,15.106756,5.025544,2020-09-14,"Unlike widely perceived, resveratrol (RSV) decreased the average lifespan and extended only the replicative lifespan in yeast. Similarly, although not widely discussed, RSV is also known to evoke neurite degeneration, kidney toxicity, atherosclerosis, premature senescence, and genotoxicity through yet unknown mechanisms. Nevertheless, in vivo animal models of diseases and human clinical trials demonstrate inconsistent protective and beneficial effects. Therefore, the mechanism of action of RSV that elicits beneficial effects remains an enigma. In a previously published work, we demonstrated structural similarities between RSV and tyrosine amino acid. RSV acts as a tyrosine antagonist and competes with it to bind to human tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase (TyrRS). Interestingly, although both isomers of RSV bind to TyrRS, only the cis-isomer evokes a unique structural change at the active site to promote its interaction with poly-ADP-ribose polymerase 1 (PARP1), a major determinant of cellular NAD(+)-dependent stress response. However, retention of trans-RSV in the active site of TyrRS mimics its tyrosine-bound conformation that inhibits the auto-poly-ADP-ribos(PAR)ylation of PARP1. Therefore, we proposed that cis-RSV-induced TyrRS-regulated auto-PARylation of PARP1 would contribute, at least in part, to the reported health benefits of RSV through the induction of protective stress response. This observation suggested that trans-RSV would inhibit TyrRS/PARP1-mediated protective stress response and would instead elicit an opposite effect compared to cis-RSV. Interestingly, most recent studies also confirmed the conversion of trans-RSV and its metabolites to cis-RSV in the physiological context. Therefore, the finding that cis-RSV and trans-RSV induce two distinct conformations of TyrRS with opposite effects on the auto-PARylation of PARP1 provides a potential molecular basis for the observed dichotomic effects of RSV under different experimental paradigms. However, the fact that natural RSV exists as a diastereomeric mixture of its cis and trans isomers and cis-RSV is also a physiologically relevant isoform has not yet gained much scientific attention.","Jhanji, Megha; Rao, Chintada Nageswara; Sajish, Mathew",GeroScience,430,30

Behavioral factors and lifestyle variables may also contribute to different food dietary trends. In this way, the present study intended to investigate the consumption habits of the most relevant types of dairy products around the world and relate them to sociodemographic factors, for example, age, sex, education and country as well as with some anthropometric and behavioral aspects, for example, body mass index, satisfaction with body weight and exercise or sedentary lifestyles. One other objective of the study was to categorize the lifestyles of the participants, according to measured variables linked with hours of inactivity or exercise, in order to use these as possible differentiating variables for the consumption of dairy products. The study involved a questionnaire survey undertaken on a non-probabilistic convenience sample of participants from Portugal (PT) and Brazil (BR), and participation was voluntary and anonymous. The data analysis involved different statistical techniques: basic statistics, chi-square tests, factor analysis, cluster analysis and tree classification analysis. The results showed that semi skimmed milk is never consumed by about half of the participants (47.4% for PT and 46.7 for BR), and those numbers increase for skimmed (64.8% for PT and 50.9% for BR), chocolate flavored milk (82.6% for PT and 65.6% for BR) and enriched milks (94.8% for PT and 85.3% for BR). Cheeses are also consumed in the two countries by small numbers of people. The number of participants consuming imported cheeses in both countries was particularly low (only 4.0% consume these more than once a week in both countries), suggesting national products may be preferred. It was further observed that those who consume cheese do it seldom (once a week) or sometimes (2–3 times per week). Butter is also consumed by only about half of the adult population (43.8% for PT and 49.5% for BR), but the percentage of those who never consume butter increases for skimmed butter (66.0% for PT and 82.6% for BR) and unsalted butter (70.2% for PT and 69.1% for BR). The consumption of yogurts also follows similar low consumption patterns. The most frequently consumed yogurt types in Portugal are liquid (30.5% consume regularly) and natural yogurts (34.8% consume regularly), while in Brazil the most frequent are creamy fruit pulp yogurt (14.4% consume regularly), liquid (13.7% consume regularly) and Greek type yogurt (10.2% consume regularly). A factor analysis and a cluster analysis established groups according to lifestyles, as follows: 1—Screeners, 2—Exercisers, 3—Travelers and 4—Others. These lifestyles were found to be influential in the consumption of dairy products for all classes of dairy tested: milk, cheese, yogurt and butter. For example, the screeners were found to consume more milk, more butter, more cheese and more yogurt. Additionally, other influential factors were age, sex, education, BMI and satisfaction with body weight. Nevertheless, country was not a meaningfully discriminant variable in relation to the other variables included in the classification analysis. The results concluded that, despite some small differences in the patterns of consumption of dairy products in both countries, the levels of consumption of dairy products are extremely low, for all classes studied (milk, cheese, yogurt or butter). Additionally, it was concluded that some factors are influential on the level of consumption of dairy products, and therefore decision makers can plan their interventions according to the characteristics of the targeted segments of the population, according to lifestyle, age, sex, education, BMI and satisfaction with body weight.","Guiné, Raquel P.

One approach is neutralizing monoclonal antibodies. Bamlanivimab and etesevimab are monoclonal antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. AREAS COVERED: This evaluation is of the phase 3 BLAZE-1 clinical trial, which was of bamlanivimab plus etesevimab in adult ambulatory participants with a risk factor for, and mild to moderate, Covid-19 illness. The primary outcome was Covid 19 related hospitalization of ≥ 24 hours or death from any cause by day 29, and this occurred in 2.1% subjects in the bamlanivimab/etesevimab group, compared to 7.0% in the placebo group. EXPERT OPINION: In the pandemic, the attempts by the FDA to shorten approval processes for medicines and by journals to make information available in a timely manner are admirable. However, these shortened processes made negotiating the details of BLAZE-1 and producing accurate and critical appraisals difficult. It seems to me that if there are any benefits of bamlanivimab alone in Covid-19, they are not clear-cut. Bamlanivimab has limited effects against the beta and gamma variants and is not effective against the delta variant. Thus, the benefits of bamlanivimab/etesevimab in the phase 3 of the BLAZE-1 may be solely due to etesevimab, and this needs to be tested.","Doggrell, Sheila A.",Expert Opin Biol Ther,430,5

During last years, there has been a dramatic evolution in several key concepts of immune pathophysiology of MS and in the treatment of this disease. The demonstration of the strong efficacy and good safety profile of selective B-cell-depleting therapies (such as anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies) has significantly expanded the therapeutic scenario for both relapsing and progressive MS patients with the identification of a new therapeutic target. The key role of B cells in triggering MS disease has been also pointed out, determining a shift from the traditional view of MS activity as largely being ‘T-cell mediated’ to the notion that MS-related pathological processes involve bi-directional interactions between several immune cell types, including B cells, both in the periphery and in the CNS. This review provides an updated overview of the involvement of B cells in the immune pathophysiology and pathology of MS. We summarize the rationale regarding the use of anti-CD20 therapies and the results of the main randomized controlled trials and observational studies investigating the efficacy and safety profile of rituximab, ocrelizumab, ofatumumab and ublituximab. Suggestions regarding vaccinations and management of MS patients during COVID-19 pandemic with anti-CD20 therapies are also discussed.

COVID-19 is a new additional and immediate risk to a patient’s morbidity and mortality and there is a need for an accurate assessment as to the potential impact on of this syndrome on GU cancer patients. The aim of this work was to develop a risk tool to identify GU cancer patients at risk of diagnosis, hospitalization, intubation, and mortality from COVID-19. A retrospective case showed a series of GU cancer patients screened for COVID-19 across the Mount Sinai Health System (MSHS). Four hundred eighty-four had a GU malignancy and 149 tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Demographic and clinical variables of >38,000 patients were available in the institutional database and were utilized to develop decision aides to predict a positive SARS-CoV-2 test, as well as COVID-19-related hospitalization, intubation, and death. A risk tool was developed using a combination of machine learning methods and utilized BMI, temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation. The risk tool for predicting a diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 had an AUC of 0.83, predicting hospitalization for management of COVID-19 had an AUC of 0.95, predicting patients requiring intubation had an AUC of 0.97, and for predicting COVID-19-related death, the risk tool had an AUC of 0.79.

However, their role in circulation and transmission of both endemic and emerging disease is a source of concern in a region considered a hotspot of disease emergence. In the Lao People's Democratic Republic (Lao PDR, Laos), live and dead wild animals are frequently found in wet markets, despite legislation against the bushmeat trade. This is generally considered to increase the risk of disease transmission and emergence, although whether or not wildlife vendors themselves have indeed increased incidence of zoonotic disease has rarely been assessed. In preparation for a future longitudinal study of market vendors investigating vendors’ exposure to zoonotic pathogens, we conducted a pilot survey of Lao market vendors of wildlife meat, livestock meat and vegetables, to identify demographic characteristics and potential control groups within markets. We also investigated baseline risk perception for infectious diseases among market vendors and assessed the association between risk perception and risk mitigation behaviours. The surveys conducted with 177 vendors revealed similar age, sex, ethnic background and geographical origin between vendor types, but differences in professional background and work history for livestock meat vendors. The perception of disease risk was very low across all vendors, as was the reported use of personal protective equipment, and the two appeared unrelated. Personal risk discounting and assumptions about transmission routes may explain this lack of association.

Classic lesion studies cite frontal lobe damage in executive dysfunction, but more recent lesion symptom-mapping studies in chronic aphasia present mixed results. In this study, we compared executive control abilities of acute stroke survivors with and without aphasia and investigated lesion correlates of linguistic and non-linguistic cognitive tasks. Twenty-nine participants with acute left hemisphere stroke resulting in aphasia (n = 14) or no aphasia (n = 15) completed clinical MRI and testing, including three NIH Toolbox Cognition Batteries (Pattern Comparison Processing Speed, Flanker Inhibitory Control and Attention, and Dimensional Change Card Sort Tests) and the Boston Naming Test. We compared performance between groups using Wilcoxon rank sum tests. We used Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator Regression to identify neural markers (percent regional damage, hypoperfusion within vascular territories, and total lesion volume) of executive control deficits and anomia. Group performance was comparable on the Pattern Comparison Processing Speed Test, but people with aphasia had poorer standard scores, lower accuracy, and slower response times on the Dimensional Change Card Sort Test than people without aphasia. Damage to extrasylvian regions (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, intraparietal sulcus) was related to executive control deficits, whereas language network damage (to inferior frontal and superior and posterior middle temporal gyri) was linked to naming impairments. These results suggest people with aphasia can exhibit comorbid executive control impairments linked to damage outside classic language network areas.

The early identification and timely treatment of severe patients are crucial to reducing the mortality of COVID-19. This study aimed to investigate the clinical characteristics and early predictors for severe COVID-19, and to establish a prediction model for the identification and triage of severe patients. METHODS: All confirmed patients with COVID-19 admitted by the Second Affiliated Hospital of Air Force Medical University were enrolled in this retrospective non-interventional study. The patients were divided into a mild group and a severe group, and the clinical data were compared between the two groups. Univariate and multivariate analysis were used to identify the independent early predictors for severe COVID-19, and the prediction model was constructed by multivariate logistic regression analysis. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to evaluate the predictive value of the prediction model and each early predictor. RESULTS: A total of 40 patients were enrolled in this study, of whom 19 were mild and 21 were severe. The proportions of patients with venerable age (≥60 years old), comorbidities, and hypertension in severe patients were higher than that of the mild (P < 0.05). The duration of fever and respiratory symptoms, and the interval from illness onset to viral clearance were longer in severe patients (P < 0.05). Most patients received at least one form of oxygen treatments, while severe patients required more mechanical ventilation (P < 0.05). Univariate and multivariate analysis showed that venerable age, hypertension, lymphopenia, hypoalbuminemia and elevated neutrophil lymphocyte ratio (NLR) were the independent high-risk factors for severe COVID-19. ROC curves demonstrated significant predictive value of age, lymphocyte count, albumin and NLR for severe COVID-19. The sensitivity and specificity of the newly constructed prediction model for predicting severe COVID-19 was 90.5% and 84.2%, respectively, and whose positive predictive value, negative predictive value and crude agreement were all over 85%. CONCLUSIONS: The severe COVID-19 risk model might help clinicians quickly identify severe patients at an early stage and timely take optimal therapeutic schedule for them.","Hu, Haifeng; Du, Hong; Li, Jing; Wang, Yage; Wu, Xiaoqing; Wang, Chunfu; Zhang, Ye; Zhang, Gufen; Zhao, Yanyan; Kang, Wen; Lian, Jianqi",Journal of global health,430,16

Receptor binding often involves protein-protein interactions, but carbohydrates may serve as receptor determinants as well. In fact, many different viruses use members of the sialic acid family either as their main receptor or as an initial attachment factor. Sialic acids (Sias) are 9-carbon negatively-charged monosaccharides commonly occurring as terminal residues of glycoconjugates. They come in a large variety and are differentially expressed in cells and tissues. By targeting specific Sia subtypes, viruses achieve host cell selectivity, but only to a certain extent. The Sia of choice might still be abundantly present on non-cell associated molecules, on non-target cells (including cells already infected) and even on virus particles themselves. This poses a hazard, as high-affinity virion binding to any of such “false'' receptors would result in loss of infectivity. Some enveloped RNA viruses deal with this problem by encoding virion-associated receptor-destroying enzymes (RDEs). These enzymes make the attachment to Sia reversible, thus providing the virus with an escape ticket. RDEs occur in two types: neuraminidases and sialate-O-acetylesterases. The latter, originally discovered in influenza C virus, are also found in certain nidoviruses, namely in group 2 coronaviruses and in toroviruses, as well as in infectious salmon anemia virus, an orthomyxovirus of teleosts. Here, the structure, function and evolution of viral sialate-O-acetylesterases is reviewed with main focus on the hemagglutinin-esterases of nidoviruses.","de Groot, Raoul J.",Glycoconj J,430,26

In this study we co-designed a way of involving people affected by a rare genomic disease in shaping future genomic research about the condition. The aim was to report the process, experiences and outcomes of involving people in genomic research in a standardised way, in order to inform future methods of involvement in research co-production. METHOD: Participants were recruited from an online community hosted by an Australian-based rare disease charity and were over the age 18 years. Once people gave consent, we shared learning resources with participants and invited them to complete an online survey before joining a two-week facilitated online discussion, followed by a second online survey. We used the novel tool ‘Standardised Data on Initiatives - Alpha Version 0.1’ (STARDIT) to map preferences, plan involvement and report any outcomes from the process, with quantitative data analysed descriptively and qualitative data thematically analysed. RESULTS: Of the 26 people who gave consent and completed the initial survey, 15 participated in the online discussion and 12 completed the follow-up survey. STARDIT was used to report six outcomes from the process, including 60% of participants’ responses showing a change towards ‘widening’ their view of who should be involved in research to include more people. Outcomes also included an improved understanding of research and how to be involved.

Significant pre-post online PR improvements were achieved in 1 min sit-to-stand (CI 2.1 to 9 (p=0.004)), Generalised Anxiety Disorder (CI −0.3 to −2.6 (p=0.023)), Primary Health Questionnaire-9 (CI −0.3 to −5.1 (p=0.029)), Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire dyspnoea (CI 0.5 to 1.3 (p=0.001)), fatigue (CI 0.7 to 2 (p=0.0004)), emotion (CI 0.7 to 1.7 (p=0.0002)), mastery (CI 0.4 to 1.3 (p=0.001)). Interviews indicated that patient PR inclusion was made possible with digital support and a PR introduction session improved participant engagement and safety. Incremental progression of exercise was perceived as more successful online compared with face-to-face PR. However, perceptions were that education sessions were less successful. Online-PR required significant staff time resource. DISCUSSION: Online-PR improves patient outcomes and is feasible and acceptable for individuals referred for face-to-face PR in the context of a requirement for social distancing. Face-to-face programmes can be adapted in a rapid fashion with both staff and participants perceiving benefit. Future pragmatic trials are now warranted comparing online-PR including remote assessments to centre-based PR with suitably matched outcomes, and patient and staff perceptions sought regarding barriers and facilitators of online delivery.","Lewis, Adam; Knight, Ellena; Bland, Matthew; Middleton, Jack; Mitchell, Esther; McCrum, Kate; Conway, Joy; Bevan-Smith, Elaine",BMJ Open Respir Res,430,16

To understand the factors associated with a worse evolution of COVID-19, we analyzed comorbidities, indicators of inflammation such as CRP and the ratio of neutrophils/lymphocytes, as well as the count of blood cells with T-lymphocyte subtypes in 172 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. Patients were grouped according to their needs for mechanical ventilation (ICU care) or not. Within the comorbidities studied, obesity was the only associated with greater severity and ICU admission. Both the percentage and the absolute number of neutrophils were higher in patients needing ICU care than non-ICU patients, whereas absolute lymphocyte count, and especially the percentage of lymphocytes, presented a deep decline in critical patients. There was no difference between the two groups of patients for CD4 T-lymphocytes, neither in percentage of lymphocyte nor in absolute number, however for CD8 T-cells the differences were significant for both parameters which were in decline in ICU patients. There was a firm correlation between the highest values of inflammation indicators with the decrease in percentage of CD8 T-lymphocytes. This effect was not seen with CD4 cells. Obesity together with lymphopenia, especially whether preferentially affects to CD8 T- lymphocytes, are factors that can predict a poor prognosis in patients with COVID-19.","Urra, J.M.; Cabrera, C.M.; Porras, L.; Ródenas, I.",Clin Immunol,430,26

We take into account the presence of asymptomatic infections and the main policies that have been adopted so far to contain the epidemic: social distancing, isolation of a portion of the population, quarantine for confirmed cases and testing. We refer to quarantine as strict isolation, and it is applied to confirmed infected cases. In the proposed model, the proportion of people in isolation, the level of contact reduction and the testing rate are control parameters that can vary in time, representing policies that evolve in different stages. We obtain an explicit expression for the basic reproduction number [Formula: see text] in terms of the parameters of the disease and of the control policies. In this way we can quantify the effect that isolation and testing have in the evolution of the epidemic. We present a series of simulations to illustrate different realistic scenarios. From the expression of [Formula: see text] and the simulations we conclude that isolation (social distancing) and testing among asymptomatic cases are fundamental actions to control the epidemic, and the stricter these measures are and the sooner they are implemented, the more effective they are in flattening the curve of infections. Additionally, we show that people that remain in isolation significantly reduce their probability of contagion, so risk groups should be recommended to maintain a low contact rate during the course of the epidemic.","Aronna, M.S.; Guglielmi, R.; Moschen, L.M.",Epidemics,430,16

METHOD: As published peer-reviewed research pertaining to memorialisation practices during the COVID-19 pandemic is lacking, this rapid review includes academic literature from the pre-COVID-19 period and international media reports during the pandemic. FINDINGS: Changes to memorialisation practices were under way before COVID-19, as consumer preferences shifted towards secularisation and personalisation of ritual and ceremony. However, several key changes to memorialisation practices connected with body preparation, funerals, cremation, burials and rituals have taken place as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic. DISCUSSION: Although boundaries between public and private memorialisation practices were already blurred, the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated this process. Without access to public memorialisation, practices are increasingly private in nature. A number of implications are considered for the bereaved, service providers and policy makers. CONCLUSION: Forms of memorialisation and bereavement support emerging during the pandemic that blend the public and the private are likely to persist in a post-pandemic world.","Lowe, Jennifer; Rumbold, Bruce; Aoun, Samar M.",Palliat Care Soc Pract,430,20

A volunteer clinic supported by medical students in northeastern Pennsylvania provides shelter and healthcare to adolescents seeking refuge. We set out to determine the immunization status of youth in the shelter and evaluate for associations of immunization deficiency with demographics or biopsychosocial factors. Methods After IRB approval, a retrospective cohort study was performed from existing clinical records at the shelter 2/2015-9/2019. Chart abstraction included variables such as demographics (including age, sex, and race/ethnicity), biopsychosocial factors (including childhood trauma/abuse history, substance abuse history, and sexual activity), and immunization history. Results A total of 440 charts were analyzed. When comparing demographics of patients that had complete vaccine regimens versus those who did not, the race was statistically significant (p=.006). The most prominent difference in race was seen for Black/African American patients; only 19.57% had a completed vaccine regimen documented. Regarding immunization history, vaccine schedules of hepatitis B, measles mumps rubella (MMR), inactivated polio vaccine (IPV), and varicella were most likely to be complete; pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) 13, rotavirus, influenza, and human papillomavirus vaccine (HPV) were least likely. There was no association found between a completed vaccine regimen and biopsychosocial variables. A larger portion of females (37.35%) completed the HPV vaccine compared to males (23.14%) (p=.009). Conclusions In this single-site study, this vulnerable, at-risk population of sheltered adolescents lacked the vaccinations recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Racial disparities further compounded this vulnerability for Black/African American teens. Additionally, a significantly greater number of female patients received the HPV vaccine compared to males.","Zemanek, Cecilia E; Liu, Nina; Sablak, Ceyda H; Gaudet, Brittney A; Jarvill, Taylor L; Kayne, Allison N; Downen, Jeffrey M; Kincaid, Hope; Smith, Amy B; Barraco, Robert D; Cuadrado, Hoonani M; Greenberg, Marna R",Cureus,430,10

It is caused by a novel coronavirus (n-CoV) generally distinguished as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It has exploited human vulnerabilities to coronavirus outbreak. SARS-CoV-2 promotes fatal chronic respiratory disease followed by multiple organ failure which ultimately puts an end to human life. No proven vaccine for n-CoV is available till date in spite of significant research efforts worldwide. International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) has reached to a consensus that the virus SARS-CoV-2 is highly genetically similar to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) outbreak of 2003. It has been reported that SARS-CoV has ∼89% genetic similarities with n-CoV. With this hypothesis, the current work focuses on the identification of spreader nodes in SARS-CoV protein interaction network. Various network characteristics like edge ratio, neighborhood density and node weight have been explored for defining a new feature spreadability index by virtue of which spreader nodes and edges are identified. The selected top spreader nodes having high spreadability index have been also validated by Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) disease model. Initially, the proposed method is applied on a synthetic protein interaction network followed by SARS-CoV-human protein interaction network. Hence, key spreader nodes and edges (ranked edges) are unmasked in SARS-CoV proteins and its connected level 1 and level 2 human proteins. The new network attribute spreadability index along with generated SIS values of selected top spreader nodes when compared with the other network centrality based methodologies like Degree centrality (DC), Closeness centrality (CC), Local average centrality (LAC) and Betweeness centrality (BC) is found to perform relatively better than the existing-state-of-art.","Saha, Sovan; Chatterjee, Piyali; Basu, Subhadip; Nasipuri, Mita",bioRxiv,430,9

GLOBOCAN 2020 has newly updated the estimates of cancer burden. This study summarizes the most recent changing profiles of cancer burden worldwide and in China and compares the cancer data of China with those of other regions. METHODS: We conducted a descriptive secondary analysis of the GLOBOCAN 2020 data. To depict the changing global profile of the leading cancer types in 2020 compared with 2018, we extracted the numbers of cases and deaths in 2018 from GLOBOCAN 2018. We also obtained cancer incidence and mortality from the 2015 National Cancer Registry Report in China when sorting the leading cancer types by new cases and deaths. For the leading cancer types according to sex in China, we summarized the estimated numbers of incidence and mortality, and calculated China's percentage of the global new cases and deaths. RESULTS: Breast cancer displaced lung cancer to become the most leading diagnosed cancer worldwide in 2020. Lung, liver, stomach, breast, and colon cancers were the top five leading causes of cancer-related death, among which liver cancer changed from the third-highest cancer mortality in 2018 to the second-highest in 2020. China accounted for 24% of newly diagnosed cases and 30% of the cancer-related deaths worldwide in 2020. Among the 185 countries included in the database, China's age-standardized incidence rate (204.8 per 100,000) ranked 65th and the age-standardized mortality rate (129.4 per 100,000) ranked 13th. The two rates were above the global average. Lung cancer remained the most common cancer type and the leading cause of cancer death in China. However, breast cancer became the most frequent cancer type among women if the incidence was stratified by sex. Incidences of colorectal cancer and breast cancer increased rapidly. The leading causes of cancer death varied minimally in ranking from 2015 to 2020 in China. Gastrointestinal cancers, including stomach, colorectal, liver, and esophageal cancers, contributed to a massive burden of cancer for both sexes. CONCLUSIONS: The burden of breast cancer is increasing globally. China is undergoing cancer transition with an increasing burden of lung cancer, gastrointestinal cancer, and breast cancers. The mortality rate of cancer in China is high. Comprehensive strategies are urgently needed to target China's changing profiles of the cancer burden.","Cao, Wei; Chen, Hong-Da; Yu, Yi-Wen; Li, Ni; Chen, Wan-Qing",Chin Med J (Engl),430,15

Thus, the aim of this study was to further confirm whether azithromycin can drive M2 polarisation in lupus and ultimately alleviate systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in vivo. Lymphocyte-derived DNA (ALD-DNA)-induced mice (induced lupus model) and MRL-Fas(lpr) mice (spontaneous lupus model) were both used in the experiment. First, we observed symptoms of lupus by assessing the levels of serum anti-dsDNA antibodies and serum creatinine and renal pathology. We found that both murine models showed increased levels of serum anti-dsDNA antibodies and creatinine, enhanced glomerular fibrosis and cell infiltration, basement membrane thickening and elevated IgG deposition. After azithromycin treatment, all these medical indexes were alleviated, and kidney damage was effectively reversed. Next, macrophage polarisation was assessed in the spleen and kidneys. Macrophage infiltration in the spleen was notably decreased after azithromycin treatment in both murine models, with a remarkably elevated proportion of M2 macrophages. In addition, the expression of interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), CD86, toll-like receptor (TLR)2 and TLR4 was extremely downregulated, while the expression of transforming growth factor (TGF)-β, arginase-1 (Arg-1), chitinase-like 3 (Ym-1), found in inflammatory zone (Fizz-1) and mannose receptor (CD206) was significantly upregulated in the kidneys after azithromycin treatment. Taken together, our results indicated for the first time that azithromycin could alleviate lupus by promoting M2 polarisation in vivo. These findings exploited the newly discovered potential of azithromycin, a conventional drug with verified safety, affordability and global availability, which could be a novel treat-to-target strategy for SLE via macrophage modulation.","Wang, Jie; Chen, Qian; Zhang, Zhixiong; Wang, Shangshang; Wang, Yilun; Xiang, Mengmeng; Liang, Jun; Xu, Jinhua",Cell Death Discov,430,1

Objective: to examine the most recent CLZ data on (a) side effects concerning (b) recent pharmacological mechanisms, (c) therapy benefits, and (d) the particularities of the COVID-19 pandemic. Data sources: a search was performed in two databases (PubMed and Web of Science) using the specific keywords “clozapine” and “schizophrenia”, “side effects”, “agranulocytosis”, “TRS”, or “bipolar affective disorder (BAF)” for the last ten years. Study eligibility criteria: clinical trials on adults with acute symptoms of schizophrenia or related disorders. Results: we selected 37 studies, randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and clinical case series (CCS), centered on six main topics in the search area: (a) CLZ in schizophrenia, (b) CLZ in bipolar disorder, (c) side effects during the clozapine therapy, (d) CLZ in pregnancy, (e) CLZ in early-onset schizophrenia, and (f) CLZ therapy and COVID-19 infection. Limitations: we considered RCTs and CCS from two databases, limited to the search topics. Conclusions and implications of key findings: (a) clozapine doses should be personalized for each patient based on pharmacogenetics testing when available; the genetic vulnerability postulates predictors of adverse reactions’ severity; patients with a lower genetic risk could have less frequent hematological monitoring; (b) a CLZ-associated risk of pulmonary embolism imposes prophylactic measures for venous thromboembolism; (c) convulsive episodes are not an indication for stopping treatment; the plasma concentration of clozapine is a better side effect predictor than the dosage; (d) COVID-19 infection may enhance clozapine toxicity, generating an increased risk of pneumonia. Therapy must be continued with the proper monitoring of the white blood count, and the clozapine dose decreased by half until three days after the fever breaks; psychiatrists and healthcare providers must act together.","Dragoi, Ana Miruna; Radulescu, Ioana; Năsui, Bogdana Adriana; Pop, Anca Lucia; Varlas, Valentin Nicolae; Trifu, Simona",Brain Sci,430,10

As previously shown, a lower pre-existing anti-MHV antibody level was found in susceptible HIII mice as compared to resistant LIII mice. Mortality rates of the F1 (H×L) hybrids and F2 and backcross segregants reflected co-dominance of both characters and the survivors had higher pre-existing anti-MHV antibody titers. The present data show that both lines had the potential to synthesize antibodies and that the resistance acquired by the susceptible HIII mice paralleled the antibody synthesis. Nevertheless, higher antibody titers were necessary to confer resistance in HIII mice than in LIII ones. When compared to uvMHV3, a single immunization with a related infectious MHV strain induced a higher antibody synthesis and led the HIII mice to resist the MHV3 challenge. A direct correlation between the antibody level and resistance to infection was always observed in HIII mice. Although mounting a Th2 response as indicated by IgG1 responses, they were also able to readily synthesize large amounts of IgG2a antibodies after immunization or during infection, reflecting a Th1 response. The transfer of anti-MHV antibodies to susceptible HIII mice was capable of conferring resistance to MHV3, providing the antibodies were present before virus infection and in large amounts. The resistance and the survival time of these animals increased with the level of antibody administered. If these direct and clear data suggest that HIII mice can acquire resistance through antibodies, the basis of the resistance of the resistant LIII mice may rely on mechanisms less dependent on antibodies.","Vassão, Ruth C.; Consales, Cleide A.; Sant'Anna, Osvaldo A.; Pereira, Carlos A.",Immunobiology,430,1

Segmentation of the regions that contain the actual lesions is one of the most widely used steps for achieving an automated diagnostic process of skin lesions. However, accurate segmentation of skin lesions has proven to be a challenging task in medical imaging because of the intrinsic factors such as the existence of undesirable artifacts and the complexity surrounding the seamless acquisition of lesion images. In this paper, we have introduced a novel algorithm based on gamma correction with clustering of keypoint descriptors for accurate segmentation of lesion areas in dermoscopy images. The algorithm was tested on dermoscopy images acquired from the publicly available dataset of Pedro Hispano hospital to achieve compelling equidistant sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy scores of 87.29%, 99.54%, and 96.02%, respectively. Moreover, the validation of the algorithm on a subset of heavily noised skin lesion images collected from the public dataset of International Skin Imaging Collaboration has yielded the equidistant sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy scores of 80.59%, 100.00%, and 94.98%, respectively.

In this study, we aimed to assess the current deployment of infection control medical personnel in Okayama prefecture, who are supposed to play an essential role to prevent the outbreak of infectious diseases, and the current prevalence of antimicrobial-resistant (AMR) bacteria isolated in Okayama. Materials and methods This was a descriptive study using publicly available data. The numbers of infectious disease (ID)-doctors and the certified nurses in infection control (CNIC) per 100,000 population in 47 prefectures in Japan were calculated. We then compared the detected proportions of AMR pathogens among the prefectures in 2019 to be employed as a comparative parameter, which was obtained from Japan Nosocomial Infections Surveillance (JANIS) data. Results The number of ID-doctors was the 11th( )highest in Japan; however, they were unevenly distributed in southern Okayama, particularly at three tertiary hospitals.

A Narrative Review,14.867023,4.864841,2020-08-18,"Even apparently similar hosts can respond differently to the same parasites. Some individuals or specific groups of individuals disproportionately affect disease dynamics. Understanding the sources of among-host heterogeneity in the ability to transmit parasites would improve disease management. A major source of host variation might be phenotypic plasticity – the tendency for phenotypes to change across different environments. Plasticity might be as important as, or even more important than, genetic change, especially in light of human modifications of the environment, because it can occur on a more rapid timescale than evolution. We argue that variation in phenotypic plasticity among and within species strongly contributes to epidemiological dynamics when parasites are shared among multiple hosts, which is often the case.","Gervasi, Stephanie S.; Civitello, David J.; Kilvitis, Holly J.; Martin, Lynn B.",Trends in Parasitology,430,10

In this study a low molecular weight fucoidan (LMWF) with unique structural was obtained from Laminaria japonica, and its anti- PF and anti-epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) bioactivity were investigated both in vivo and in vitro. After LWMF treatment the fibrosis and inflammatory factors stimulated by Bleomycin (BLM) were in lung tissue. Immunohistochemical and Western-blot results found the expression of COL2A1, ß-catenin, TGF-ß, TNF-α and IL-6 were declined in mice lung tissue. Besides, the phosphorylation of PI3K and Akt were inhibited by LMWF. In addition, the progression of EMT induced by TGF-ß1 was inhibited by LMWF through down-regulated both TGF-ß/Smad and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways. These data indicate that unique LMWF can protect the lung from fibrosis by weakening the process of inflammation and EMT, and it is a promising therapeutic option for the treatment of PF.","Wu, Ning; Li, Zhi; Wang, Jing; Geng, Lihua; Yue, Yang; Deng, Zhenzhen; Wang, Qingchi; Zhang, Quanbin",Carbohydr Polym,430,1

Owing to the fact that isolation centre, in general, always contained a constant number of 200 COVID-19 patients, the prime objective of the study was to check if several drains carrying RNA of coronavirus are actually getting diluted or accumulated along with the sewage network. Our finding suggested that while the temporal variation of the genetic load decreased in small drains over the span of 50 days, the main sewer exhibited accumulation of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Other interesting finding displays that probably distance of sampling location in meters is not likely to have a significant impact on gene detection concentration, although the quantity of the RNA extracted in the downstream of the drain was higher. These findings are of immense value from the perspective of wastewater surveillance of COVID-19, as they largely imply that we do not need to monitor every wastewater system, and probably major drains monitoring may illustrate the city health. Perhaps, we are reporting the accumulation of SARS-CoV-2 genetic material along with the sewer network i.e. from primary to tertiary drains. The study sought further data collection in this line to simulate conditions prevailed in the most of developing countries and to shed further light on decay/accumulation processes of the genetic load of the SARS-COV-2.","Ahmed, Firoz; Islam, Md.

In people, fecal S100/calgranulin concentrations are affected by age, obesity, diet and other lifestyle factors. Knowledge about the effects of such factors on fecal S100/calgranulin concentrations in dogs is currently scarce. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between several factors and fecal S100/calgranulin concentrations in a large cohort of healthy adult dogs. METHODS: Single‐spot fecal samples from 181 healthy pet dogs and data derived from a standard questionnaire served to evaluate the effect of age, sex, reproductive status, body weight and body condition, breed type and size, vaccination, endoparasite treatment, diet, environment and travel history on fecal S100/calgranulin concentrations and the fecal calgranulin ratio (fCalR). RESULTS: Univariate analysis showed a significant association of reproductive status (in female dogs) and breed size with fecal S100A12, fecal calprotectin and fCalR. Breed type was linked to fecal S100A12 concentrations and fCalR; recent vaccination (particularly with a vaccine against canine parvovirus) to fCalR. In multivariate models, breed size was linked to fecal S100A12 and calprotectin concentrations, and recent vaccination affected S100A12 concentrations. CONCLUSIONS: Breed size, recent vaccination and reproductive status in female dogs can affect fecal S100/calgranulin concentrations, and these biomarkers should be interpreted in light of those confounding factors. The utility of reference intervals for fecal canine S100/calgranulin concentrations might be improved through stratification by sex/reproductive status and breed size. Fecal canine S100/calgranulin concentrations are not confounded by age, body condition, deworming, diet, environment or travel history.","Heilmann, Romy M.; Guard, Melissa M.; Toresson, Linda; Unterer, Stefan; Grellet, Aurélien; Grützner, Niels; Suchodolski, Jan S.; Steiner, Joerg M.",Vet Med Sci,430,20

The lockdown data were compared with 2018 and 2019 observed data. PM(10) values during lockdown were reduced by 3.75 to 4.5 times as compared with previous 2 years. Similarly, four-fold reduction of PM(2.5) and SPM values was observed during lockdown. The gaseous pollutants like NO(2) and O(3) are within safe limit. Overall air quality index (AQI) improved significantly during lockdown. Similarly, there was drastic reduction in the majority of the nutrient parameters in the coastal water. Different heavy metal concentration in the coastal sediments samples also showed strong reduction during lockdown sampling in comparison with other two sampling. This proves that the coastal environment has its efficient self-cleaning potentials if there is considerable reduction in the anthropogenic as well as industrial activities.

In urban areas, technological challenges are gradually being overcome, and advances in this area are exponential. Unfortunately, isolated territories such as northern Quebec do not beneficiate from this technological progress. Yet, northern Quebec relies on abundant natural resources, with notably its huge hydroelectric dams and iron mines, and therefore, the region's economic life revolves essentially around the exploitation of these resources and is heavily reliant on rail transportation. However, according to Transport Canada, 1246 railroad accidents were reported in 2019 to the Transportation Safety Board (TSB). Thirty-eight people described as trespassers lost their lives, and five railroad employees were fatally injured. In this context, we present the implementation of a security system in an isolated environment for employees intervening on the railroad track to warn them of the imminent arrival of a train. Due to the context of the isolated environment, i.e., without an electrical network, without internet, and without an LTE network, a solution for employees has been developed using a Zigbee telecommunication system and a connected watch. A case study on a train operating in a remote and isolated area in northern Quebec is presented to validate the performance of the proposed system based on an open-source and customizable solution.","Ferrier, Laurent; Ibrahim, Hussein; Issa, Mohamad; Ilinca, Adrian",Sensors,430,1

This study aimed to characterize the association between clinical outcomes in patients with obesity and inflammatory markers. METHODS: We analyzed data for patients aged ≥18 years admitted with a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test. We used multivariate logistic regression to determine the association between BMI and intensive care unit (ICU) transfer and all-cause mortality. Inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein [CRP], lactate dehydrogenase [LDH], ferritin, and D-dimer) were compared between patients with and without obesity (body mass index [BMI] ≥30 kg/m(2)). RESULTS: Of 791 patients with Covid-19, 361 (45.6%) had obesity. In multivariate analyses, BMI ≥35 was associated with a higher odds of ICU transfer (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 2.388 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.074–5.310) and hospital mortality (aOR = 4.3, 95% CI: 1.69–10.82).

Integration of these two strategies endowed the CRISPR/Cas12a and aptamer-based method with ultra-sensitive, fast, and stable antigen detection. In a demonstration of this method, the limit of detection was at the single virus level (0.17 fM, approximately two copies/L) in SARS-CoV-2 antigen nucleocapsid protein analysis of saliva or serum samples. The entire procedure required only 20 minutes.

In the emergency department, VMN plus mouthpiece (no supplemental oxygen) was seen to deliver (29.02 ± 1.41%) versus low flow nasal therapy (10 L per minute (LPM) oxygen) (1.81 ± 0.47%) and high flow nasal therapy (50 LPM oxygen) (3.36 ± 0.34%). In the ward/intensive care unit, non-invasive ventilation recorded 19.02 ± 0.28%, versus 22.64 ± 1.88% of the dose delivered during invasive mechanical ventilation. These results will have application in the design of intervention-appropriate aerosol therapy strategies and will be of use to researchers developing new therapeutics for application in cystic fibrosis and beyond.","Fernández Fernández, Elena; Joyce, Mary; O’Sullivan, Andrew; MacLoughlin, Ronan",Antibiotics (Basel),430,1

From medical schools’ use of enslaved bodies as cadavers to the widespread hospital practice of reporting suspected drug users who seek medical help to the police, the institutional practices and policies that have shaped U.S. healthcare systems as we know them cannot be minimized as coincidence. Rather, the very foundations of medical discovery, diagnosis, and treatment are built on racist contempt for Black people and have become self-perpetuating. Yet, I argue that bioethics and bioethicists have a role in combatting racism. However, in order to do so, bioethicists have to understand the workings of contemptuous racism and how that particular form of racism manifests in U.S. healthcare institutions.

In a prospective cohort study, performing arts students (N = 213) from Codarts Rotterdam, University of the Arts, were invited to monitor their health during one academic year (September 2019–May 2020). Every month, students completed items on mental health complaints, stress, and sleep quality. Chi-square tests and repeated-measures ANOVA with deviation contrasts were performed to investigate whether COVID-19 preventive measures were associated with changes in mental health complaints, stress scores, and sleep quality. During the COVID-19 lockdown, subjective mental health, Mental Health Inventory-5 (MHI-5), and items on loneliness were additionally completed by the respondents. A total of 98 students (46.0%) were included in the analyses. The 3-month prevalence of mental health complaints was significantly higher during the COVID-19 lockdown compared to the two pre-COVID-19 periods (p < 0.001). Mean stress scores were significantly lower for February (35.20) and March (36.41) when compared to the overall mean (40.38). Sleep quality scores (mean) were significantly higher for April (6.90), and May (6.89) when compared to overall mean (6.58). Furthermore, at least 75.5% of the participants dealt with moderate to very severe loneliness in all 3 months during the COVID-19 lockdown. During lockdown, performing arts students perceived less stress and their sleep quality increased. However, the prevalence of mental health complaints increased. Besides, 3 out 4 students dealt with moderate to very severe loneliness.","Stubbe, Janine H.; Tiemens, Annemiek; Keizer-Hulsebosch, Stephanie C.; Steemers, Suze; van Winden, Diana; Buiten, Maurice; Richardson, Angelo; van Rijn, Rogier M.",Front Psychol,430,19

There has been a proliferation of research examining characteristics that can be targeted by public health interventions. This rapid review sought to identify predictors of attitudes toward and adherence to COVID-19 public health guidelines, and identify interventions aiming to improve adherence. METHODS: Articles were retrieved from multiple databases (e.g. MEDLINE, CINAHL and medRxiv) on 6 August 2020. Studies were limited to samples collected from Western countries. Studies were classified according to the types of factor (s) examined as independent variables. The consistency of evidence for each factor was scored by two reviewers. RESULTS: In total, 1323 unique articles were identified in the initial search, resulting in 29 studies in the final synthesis. The available evidence suggests individuals who are older, identify as women, trust governments, perceive COVID-19 as threatening and access information through traditional news media are more likely to adhere with COVID-19 public health guidelines. Interventions for improving adherence have not yet been investigated thoroughly, and this review identified only three experimental studies. CONCLUSIONS: This review has identified several characteristics that impact attitudes and adherence to COVID-19 public health guidelines.","Moran, Chelsea; Campbell, David J T; Campbell, Tavis S; Roach, Pamela; Bourassa, Lyne; Collins, Zoe; Stasiewicz, Marysia; McLane, Patrick",J Public Health (Oxf),430,32

We evaluated the impact of high- versus low-dose intravenous iron isomaltoside on the probability of retreatment with intravenous iron in iron-deficient ND-CKD patients. METHODS: This real-world, prospective, observational study collected data from 256 ND-CKD patients treated for anaemia in the UK. Following an initial course of iron isomaltoside, patients were followed for ≥12 months. Iron dose and the need for retreatment were determined at the investigators’ discretion. The primary study outcome was the need for retreatment at 52 weeks compared between patients who received >1000 mg of iron during Course 1 and those who received ≤1000 mg. Safety was evaluated through adverse drug reactions. RESULTS: The probability of retreatment at Week 52 was significantly lower in the >1000 mg iron group (n = 58) versus the ≤1000 mg group (n = 198); hazard ratio (95% confidence interval [CI]): 0.46 (0.20, 0.91); p = 0.012. Mean (95% CI) haemoglobin increased by 6.58 (4.94, 8.21) g/L in the ≤1000 mg group and by 10.59 (7.52, 13.66) g/L in the >1000 mg group (p = 0.024). Changes in other blood and iron parameters were not significantly different between the two groups. Administering >1000 mg of iron isomaltoside saved 8.6 appointments per 100 patients compared to ≤1000 mg. No serious adverse drug reactions were reported. Of the patients who received ≤1000 mg of iron in this study, 82.3% were eligible for a dose >1000 mg. CONCLUSIONS: The >1000 mg iron isomaltoside regimen reduced the probability of retreatment, achieved a greater haemoglobin response irrespective of erythropoiesis-stimulating agent treatment, and reduced the total number of appointments required, compared to the ≤1000 mg regimen. Many of the patients who received ≤1000 mg of iron were eligible for >1000 mg, indicating that there was considerable underdosing in this study.

The standard strategies for depletion of the highest abundant proteins currently rely on multiple-use HPLC columns or multiple-use spin columns. Here we evaluate the performance of single-use spin columns for plasma depletion and show that the single-use spin reduces handling time by allowing parallelization and is easily adapted to a nonspecialized lab environment without reducing the high plasma proteome coverage and reproducibility. In addition, we evaluate the effect of viral heat inactivation on the plasma proteome, an additional step in the plasma preparation workflow that allows the sample preparation of SARS-Cov2-infected samples to be performed in a BSL3 laboratory, and report the advantage of performing the heat inactivation postdepletion. We further show the possibility of expanding the use of the depletion column cross-species to macaque plasma samples. In conclusion, we report that single-use spin columns for high abundant protein depletion meet the requirements for reproducibly in in-depth plasma proteomics and can be applied on a common animal model while also reducing the sample handling time.","Cao, Xiaofang; Sandberg, AnnSofi; Araújo, José Eduardo; Cvetkovski, Filip; Berglund, Erik; Eriksson, Lars E.; Pernemalm, Maria",J Proteome Res,430,24

We aimed to explore and compare the associations between HCoVs’ epidemic and environmental factors globally. Four common HCoVs’ data were collected by a systematic literature review, and data of MERS, SARS, and COVID-19 were collected from the World Health Organization’s reports. Monthly positive rates of common HCoVs and incidence rates of MERS, SARS, and COVID-19 were calculated. Geographical coordinates were used to link virus data and environmental data. Generalized additive models (GAMs) were used to quantitatively estimate the association of environmental factors with HCoVs’ epidemic. We found that there are wide associations between HCoVs and environmental factors on a global scale, and some of the associations were nonlinear. In addition, COVID-19 has the most similarities in associations’ direction with common HCoVs, especially for HCoV-HKU1 in four environmental factors including the significantly negative associations with average temperature, precipitation, vegetation coverage (p<0.05), and the U-shaped association with temperature range. This study strengthened the relevant research evidences and provided significant insights into the epidemic rules of HCoVs in general. The similarities between COVID-19 and common HCoVs indicated that it is critically important to strengthen surveillance on common HCoVs and pay more attention to environmental factors’ role in surveillance and early warning of HCoVs’ epidemic.

The spectrum of COVID-19 symptoms is broad, ranging from a mild, self-limiting respiratory tract illness to severe progressive pneumonia, multi-organ failure and possible death. Despite much effort and multiple clinical trials, there are, to date, no specific therapeutic agents to treat or cure the coronavirus infection. CASE REPORTS: The present paper presents 5 cases of patients with moderate to severe COVID-19 infections, 2 of them hospitalized in the intensive care unit, who were successfully treated with homeopathy. RESULTS: All 5 patients responded to homeopathic treatment in an unexpectedly short time span, improving both physically and mentally. CONCLUSION: The present case series emphasizes the rapidity of response among moderate to severely ill patients to homeopathic treatment, when conventional medical options have been unable to relieve or shorten the disease. The observations described should encourage use of homeopathy in treating patients with COVID-19 during the acute phase of the disease.","Kurd, Ramzi; Freed, Yakov; Jarjoui, Amir; Izbicki, Gabriel; Levin, Philip; Helvitz, Yigal; Sherr, Jeremy; Oberbaum, Menachem",Complement Med Res,430,15

Previous studies investigating gender differences in digital learning largely used biological sex as the only indicator of gender. This study includes both biological sex and gender role self-concept in order to investigate the role of gender in different components of this stereotyped domain in a more differentiated way.

Results showed higher perceived teacher support, intrinsic value, and learning engagement among girls than boys, while no significant sex differences were found in competence beliefs regarding digital learning. Furthermore, our results indicated clear benefits of an androgynous gender role self-concept for all studied components of digital learning.

Promoting respiratory hygiene may reduce infection transmission. This formative research explored community perceptions about respiratory infections. METHODS: We conducted 34 in-depth interviews and 16 focus group discussions with community members and school children to explore respiratory hygiene related perceptions, practices, and social norms in an urban and a rural setting. We conducted unstructured observations on respiratory hygiene practices in public markets. RESULTS: Informants were not familiar with the term ""respiratory infection""; most named diseases that had no relation to respiratory dysfunction. Informants reported that their community identified a number of 'good behaviors' related to respiratory hygiene, but they also noted, and we observed, that very few people practiced these. All informants cited hot/cold weather changes or using cold water as causes for catching cold. They associated transmission of respiratory infections with close contact with a sick person's breath, cough droplets, or spit; sharing a sick person's utensils and food. Informants suggested that avoiding such contact was the most effective method to prevent respiratory infection. Although informants perceived that handwashing after coughing or sneezing might prevent illness, they felt this was not typically feasible or practical. CONCLUSION: Community perceptions of respiratory infections include both concerns with imbalances between hot and cold, and with person-to-person transmission. Many people were aware of measures that could prevent respiratory infection, but did not practice them. Interventions that leverage community understanding of person-to-person transmission and that encourage the practice of their identified 'good behaviors' related to respiratory hygiene may reduce respiratory disease transmission.","Nizame, Fosiul A; Nasreen, Sharifa; Unicomb, Leanne; Southern, Dorothy; Gurley, Emily S; Arman, Shaila; Kadir, Mohammad A; Azziz-Baumgartner, Eduardo; Luby, Stephen P; Winch, Peter J",BMC Public Health,430,1

As of 19 June 2015, a total of 1,338 MERS-CoV infections have been notified to the World Health Organization (WHO). Clinical illness associated with MERS-CoV ranges from mild upper respiratory symptoms to rapidly progressive pneumonia and multi-organ failure. A significant proportion of patients present with non-respiratory symptoms such as headache, myalgia, vomiting and diarrhoea. A few potential therapeutic agents have been identified but none have been conclusively shown to be clinically effective. Human to human transmission is well documented, but the epidemic potential of MERS-CoV remains limited at present. Healthcare-associated clusters of MERS-CoV have been responsible for the majority of reported cases. The largest outbreaks have been driven by delayed diagnosis, overcrowding and poor infection control practices. However, chains of MERS-CoV transmission can be readily interrupted with implementation of appropriate control measures. As with any emerging infectious disease, guidelines for MERS-CoV case identification and surveillance evolved as new data became available. Sound clinical judgment is required to identify unusual presentations and trigger appropriate control precautions. Evidence from multiple sources implicates dromedary camels as natural hosts of MERS-CoV. Camel to human transmission has been demonstrated, but the exact mechanism of infection remains uncertain. The ubiquitously available social media have facilitated communication and networking amongst healthcare professionals and eventually proved to be important channels for presenting the public with factual material, timely updates and relevant advice.","Omrani, A.S.; Shalhoub, S.",J Hosp Infect,430,15

However, during this period, the virus has mutated to adapt to the different environmental conditions in the world and made the task of vaccine design more challenging. In this situation, the identification of virus strains is very much timely and important task. We have performed genome-wide analysis of 10664 SARS-CoV-2 genomes of 73 countries to identify and prepare a Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) dataset of SARS-CoV-2. Thereafter, with the use of this SNP data, the advantage of hierarchical clustering is taken care of in such a way so that Average Linkage and Complete Linkage with Jaccard and Hamming distance functions are applied separately in order to identify the virus strains as clusters present in the SNP data. In this regard, the consensus of both the clustering results are also considered while Silhouette index is used as a cluster validity index to measure the goodness of the clusters as well to determine the number of clusters or virus strains. As a result, we have identified five major clusters or virus strains present worldwide. Apart from quantitative measures, these clusters are also visualized using Visual Assessment of Tendency (VAT) plot. The evolution of these clusters are also shown. Furthermore, top 10 signature SNPs are identified in each cluster and the non-synonymous signature SNPs are visualised in the respective protein structures. Also, the sequence and structural homology-based prediction along with the protein structural stability of these non-synonymous signature SNPs are reported in order to judge the characteristics of the identified clusters. As a consequence, T85I, Q57H and R203M in NSP2, ORF3a, Nucleocapsid respectively are found to be responsible for Cluster 1 as they are damaging and unstable non-synonymous signature SNPs. Similarly, F506L and S507C in Exon are responsible for both Clusters 3 and 4 while Clusters 2 and 5 do not exhibit such behaviour due to the absence of any non-synonymous signature SNPs. In addition to all these, the code, SNP dataset, 10664 labelled SARS-CoV-2 strains and additional results as supplementary are provided through our website for further use.","Ghosh, Nimisha; Saha, Indrajit; Sharma, Nikhil; Nandi, Suman; Plewczynski, Dariusz",Virus Res,430,16
