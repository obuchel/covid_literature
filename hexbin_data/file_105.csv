197,197,197,Key Role of Splenic Myeloid DCs in the IFN-αβ Response to Adenoviruses In Vivo,12.0784235,7.3109474,2008-11-14,"The early systemic production of interferon (IFN)-αβ is an essential component of the antiviral host defense mechanisms, but is also thought to contribute to the toxic side effects accompanying gene therapy with adenoviral vectors. Here we investigated the IFN-αβ response to human adenoviruses (Ads) in mice. By comparing the responses of normal, myeloid (m)DC- and plasmacytoid (p)DC-depleted mice and by measuring IFN-αβ mRNA expression in different organs and cells types, we show that in vivo, Ads elicit strong and rapid IFN-αβ production, almost exclusively in splenic mDCs. Using knockout mice, various strains of Ads (wild type, mutant and UV-inactivated) and MAP kinase inhibitors, we demonstrate that the Ad-induced IFN-αβ response does not require Toll-like receptors (TLR), known cytosolic sensors of RNA (RIG-I/MDA-5) and DNA (DAI) recognition and interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-3, but is dependent on viral endosomal escape, signaling via the MAP kinase SAPK/JNK and IRF-7. Furthermore, we show that Ads induce IFN-αβ and IL-6 in vivo by distinct pathways and confirm that IFN-αβ positively regulates the IL-6 response. Finally, by measuring TNF-α responses to LPS in Ad-infected wild type and IFN-αβR(−/−) mice, we show that IFN-αβ is the key mediator of Ad-induced hypersensitivity to LPS. These findings indicate that, like endosomal TLR signaling in pDCs, TLR-independent virus recognition in splenic mDCs can also produce a robust early IFN-αβ response, which is responsible for the bulk of IFN-αβ production induced by adenovirus in vivo. The signaling requirements are different from known TLR-dependent or cytosolic IFN-αβ induction mechanisms and suggest a novel cytosolic viral induction pathway. The hypersensitivity to components of the microbial flora and invading pathogens may in part explain the toxic side effects of adenoviral gene therapy and contribute to the pathogenesis of adenoviral disease.","Fejer, György; Drechsel, Lisa; Liese, Jan; Schleicher, Ulrike; Ruzsics, Zsolt; Imelli, Nicola; Greber, Urs F.; Keck, Simone; Hildenbrand, Bernd; Krug, Anne; Bogdan, Christian; Freudenberg, Marina A.",PLoS Pathog,105,1
213,213,213,Avian Influenza: Should China Be Alarmed?,12.09542,7.6575813,2007-08-31,"Avian influenza has emerged as one of the primary public health concern of the 21st century. Influenza strain H5N1 is capable of incidentally infecting humans and other mammals. Since their reemergence in 2003, highly pathogenic avian influenza A (H5N1) viruses have been transmitted from poultry to humans (by direct or indirect contact with infected birds) in several provinces of Mainland China, which has resulted in 22 cases of human infection and has created repercussions for the Chinese economy. People have been concerned whether a new pandemic will occur in the future. The eradication of pathogenic avian influenza viruses appears to be the most effective way to prevent an influenza pandemic. This paper will examine the features of H5N1, including incidence, infection, immunity, clinical management, prevention and control, and therapy in Mainland China.","Su, Zhaoliang; Xu, Huaxi; Chen, Jianguo",Yonsei Med J,105,22
231,231,231,On the significance of Surfactant Protein-A within the human lungs,12.24519,7.662911,2009-03-12,"Surfactant Protein-A (SP-A) is the most prominent among four proteins in the pulmonary surfactant-system. SP-A is expressed by alveolar epithelial cells type II as well as by a portion of non small cell lung carcinomas (NSCLC). The expression of SP-A is complexly regulated on the transcriptional and the chromosomal level. SP-A is a major player in the pulmonary cytokine-network and moreover has been described to act in the pulmonary host defense. By the use of cell culture or animal models the functional properties have been repeatedly shown in many aspects, often bearing surprising properties which strongly indicate the physiological importance of SP-A. To date SP-A is recognized as a molecule essential for pulmonary development, structure and function. An upcoming number of reports deals with the role of SP-A for pulmonary pathology. This article gives an overview about the state of knowledge on SP-A focused in applications for human pulmonary disorders and points out the importance for pathology-orientated research approaches using immunohistochemistry or in situ hybridization as promising methods to further elucidate the role of this molecule in adult lung diseases.","Goldmann, Torsten; Kähler, Daniel; Schultz, Holger; Abdullah, Mahdi; Lang, Dagmar S; Stellmacher, Florian; Vollmer, Ekkehard",Diagn Pathol,105,11
281,281,281,A host type I interferon response is induced by cytosolic sensing of the bacterial second messenger cyclic-di-GMP,12.030188,7.695201,2009-08-31,"The innate immune system responds to unique molecular signatures that are widely conserved among microbes but that are not normally present in host cells. Compounds that stimulate innate immune pathways may be valuable in the design of novel adjuvants, vaccines, and other immunotherapeutics. The cyclic dinucleotide cyclic-di–guanosine monophosphate (c-di-GMP) is a recently appreciated second messenger that plays critical regulatory roles in many species of bacteria but is not produced by eukaryotic cells. In vivo and in vitro studies have previously suggested that c-di-GMP is a potent immunostimulatory compound recognized by mouse and human cells. We provide evidence that c-di-GMP is sensed in the cytosol of mammalian cells via a novel immunosurveillance pathway. The potency of cytosolic signaling induced by c-di-GMP is comparable to that induced by cytosolic delivery of DNA, and both nucleic acids induce a similar transcriptional profile, including triggering of type I interferons and coregulated genes via induction of TBK1, IRF3, nuclear factor κB, and MAP kinases. However, the cytosolic pathway that senses c-di-GMP appears to be distinct from all known nucleic acid–sensing pathways. Our results suggest a novel mechanism by which host cells can induce an inflammatory response to a widely produced bacterial ligand.","McWhirter, Sarah M.; Barbalat, Roman; Monroe, Kathryn M.; Fontana, Mary F.; Hyodo, Mamoru; Joncker, Nathalie T.; Ishii, Ken J.; Akira, Shizuo; Colonna, Marco; Chen, Zhijian J.; Fitzgerald, Katherine A.; Hayakawa, Yoshihiro; Vance, Russell E.",J Exp Med,105,22
439,439,439,Generation of Human Antigen-Specific Monoclonal IgM Antibodies Using Vaccinated “Human Immune System” Mice,12.272218,7.6141586,2010-10-04,"BACKGROUND: Passive transfer of antibodies not only provides immediate short-term protection against disease, but also can be exploited as a therapeutic tool. However, the ‘humanization’ of murine monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) is a time-consuming and expensive process that has the inherent drawback of potentially altering antigenic specificity and/or affinity. The immortalization of human B cells represents an alternative for obtaining human mAbs, but relies on the availability of biological samples from vaccinated individuals or convalescent patients. In this work we describe a novel approach to generate fully human mAbs by combining a humanized mouse model with a new B cell immortalization technique. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: After transplantation with CD34(+)CD38(−) human hematopoietic progenitor cells, BALB/c Rag2(−/−)IL-2Rγc(−/−) mice acquire a human immune system and harbor B cells with a diverse IgM repertoire. “Human Immune System” mice were then immunized with two commercial vaccine antigens, tetanus toxoid and hepatitis B surface antigen. Sorted human CD19(+)CD27(+) B cells were retrovirally transduced with the human B cell lymphoma (BCL)-6 and BCL-XL genes, and subsequently cultured in the presence of CD40-ligand and IL-21. This procedure allows generating stable B cell receptor-positive B cells that secrete immunoglobulins. We recovered stable B cell clones that produced IgM specific for tetanus toxoid and the hepatitis B surface antigen, respectively. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: This work provides the proof-of-concept for the usefulness of this novel method based on the immunization of humanized mice for the rapid generation of human mAbs against a wide range of antigens.","Becker, Pablo D.; Legrand, Nicolas; van Geelen, Caroline M.

638,638,638,Leukocyte- and Platelet-Derived Microvesicle Interactions following In Vitro and In Vivo Activation of Toll-Like Receptor 4 by Lipopolysaccharide,12.296867,7.613359,2011-09-26,"BACKGROUND: Pro-coagulant membrane microvesicles (MV) derived from platelets and leukocytes are shed into the circulation following receptor-mediated activation, cell-cell interaction, and apoptosis. Platelets are sentinel markers of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) activation. Experiments were designed to evaluate the time course and mechanism of direct interactions between platelets and leukocytes following acute activation of TLR4 by bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS). METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Blood from age-matched male and female wild type (WT) and TLR4 gene deleted (dTLR4) mice was incubated with ultra-pure E. coli LPS (500 ng/ml) for up to one hour. At designated periods, leukocyte antigen positive platelets, platelet antigen positive leukocytes and cell-derived MV were quantified by flow cytometry. Numbers of platelet- or leukocyte-derived MV did not increase within one hour following in vitro exposure of blood to LPS. However, with LPS stimulation numbers of platelets staining positive for both platelet- and leukocyte-specific antigens increased in blood derived from WT but not dTLR4 mice. This effect was blocked by inhibition of TLR4 signaling mediated by My88 and TRIF. Seven days after a single intravenous injection of LPS (500 ng/mouse or 20 ng/gm body wt) to WT mice, none of the platelets stained for leukocyte antigen. However, granulocytes, monocytes and apoptotic bodies stained positive for platelet antigens. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Within one hour of exposure to LPS, leukocytes exchange surface antigens with platelets through TLR4 activation. In vivo, leukocyte expression of platelet antigen is retained after a single exposure to LPS following turn over of the platelet pool. Acute expression of leukocyte antigen on platelets within one hour of exposure to LPS and the sustained expression of platelet antigen on leukocytes following a single acute exposure to LPS in vivo explains, in part, associations of platelets and leukocytes in response to bacterial infection and changes in thrombotic propensity of the blood.","Xiong, Jing; Miller, Virginia M.; Hunter, Larry W.; Li, Yunman; Jayachandran, Muthuvel",PLoS One,105,1
782,782,782,Common Variants in CDKN2B-AS1 Associated with Optic-Nerve Vulnerability of Glaucoma Identified by Genome-Wide Association Studies in Japanese,12.061846,7.3995643,2012-03-12,"BACKGROUND: To date, only a small portion of the genetic variation for primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG), the major type of glaucoma, has been elucidated. METHODS AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We examined our two data sets of the genome-wide association studies (GWAS) derived from a total of 2,219 Japanese subjects. First, we performed a GWAS by analyzing 653,519 autosomal common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 833 POAG patients and 686 controls. As a result, five variants that passed the Bonferroni correction were identified in CDKN2B-AS1 on chromosome 9p21.3, which was already reported to be a significant locus in the Caucasian population. Moreover, we combined the data set with our previous GWAS data set derived from 411 POAG patients and 289 controls by the Mantel-Haenszel test, and all of the combined variants showed stronger association with POAG (P<5.8×10(−10)). We then subdivided the case groups into two subtypes based on the value of intraocular pressure (IOP)—POAG with high IOP (high pressure glaucoma, HPG) and that with normal IOP (normal pressure glaucoma, NPG)—and performed the GWAS using the two data sets, as the prevalence of NPG in Japanese is much higher than in Caucasians. The results suggested that the variants from the same CDKN2B-AS1 locus were likely to be significant for NPG patients. CONCLUSIONS AND SIGNIFICANCE: In this study, we successfully identified POAG-associated variants in the CDKN2B-AS1 locus using a Japanese population, i.e., variants originally reported as being associated with the Caucasian population. Although we cannot rule out that the significance could be due to the differences in sample size between HPG and NPG, the variants could be associated specifically with the vulnerability of the optic nerve to IOP, which is useful for investigating the etiology of glaucoma.","Nakano, Masakazu; Ikeda, Yoko; Tokuda, Yuichi; Fuwa, Masahiro; Omi, Natsue; Ueno, Morio; Imai, Kojiro; Adachi, Hiroko; Kageyama, Masaaki; Mori, Kazuhiko; Kinoshita, Shigeru; Tashiro, Kei",PLoS One,105,1
875,875,875,Lipid Rafts and Alzheimer’s Disease: Protein-Lipid Interactions and Perturbation of Signaling,12.212402,7.4398646,2012-06-22,"Lipid rafts are membrane domains, more ordered than the bulk membrane and enriched in cholesterol and sphingolipids. They represent a platform for protein-lipid and protein–protein interactions and for cellular signaling events. In addition to their normal functions, including membrane trafficking, ligand binding (including viruses), axonal development and maintenance of synaptic integrity, rafts have also been implicated in the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Lipid rafts promote interaction of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) with the secretase (BACE-1) responsible for generation of the amyloid β peptide, Aβ. Rafts also regulate cholinergic signaling as well as acetylcholinesterase and Aβ interaction. In addition, such major lipid raft components as cholesterol and GM1 ganglioside have been directly implicated in pathogenesis of the disease. Perturbation of lipid raft integrity can also affect various signaling pathways leading to cellular death and AD. In this review, we discuss modulation of APP cleavage by lipid rafts and their components, while also looking at more recent findings on the role of lipid rafts in signaling events.","Hicks, David A.; Nalivaeva, Natalia N.; Turner, Anthony J.",Front Physiol,105,17
938,938,938,A Novel Vaccine Using Nanoparticle Platform to Present Immunogenic M2e against Avian Influenza Infection,12.231452,7.6964893,2012-01-12,"Using peptide nanoparticle technology, we have designed two novel vaccine constructs representing M2e in monomeric (Mono-M2e) and tetrameric (Tetra-M2e) forms. Groups of specific pathogen free (SPF) chickens were immunized intramuscularly with Mono-M2e or Tetra-M2e with and without an adjuvant. Two weeks after the second boost, chickens were challenged with 107.2 EID50 of H5N2 low pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI) virus. M2e-specific antibody responses to each of the vaccine constructs were tested by ELISA. Vaccinated chickens exhibited increased M2e-specific IgG responses for each of the constructs as compared to a non-vaccinated group. However, the vaccine construct Tetra-M2e elicited a significantly higher antibody response when it was used with an adjuvant. On the other hand, virus neutralization assays indicated that immune protection is not by way of neutralizing antibodies. The level of protection was evaluated using quantitative real time PCR at 4, 6, and 8 days post-challenge with H5N2 LPAI by measuring virus shedding from trachea and cloaca. The Tetra-M2e with adjuvant offered statistically significant (P < 0.05) protection against subtype H5N2 LPAI by reduction of the AI virus shedding. The results suggest that the self-assembling polypeptide nanoparticle shows promise as a potential platform for a development of a vaccine against AI.","Babapoor, Sankhiros; Neef, Tobias; Mittelholzer, Christian; Girshick, Theodore; Garmendia, Antonio; Shang, Hongwei; Khan, Mazhar I.; Burkhard, Peter",Influenza Res Treat,105,1
969,969,969,Discovery and Targeted LC-MS/MS of Purified Polerovirus Reveals Differences in the Virus-Host Interactome Associated with Altered Aphid Transmission,11.893942,7.3141046,2012-10-30,"Circulative transmission of viruses in the Luteoviridae, such as cereal yellow dwarf virus (CYDV), requires a series of precisely orchestrated interactions between virus, plant, and aphid proteins. Natural selection has favored these viruses to be retained in the phloem to facilitate acquisition and transmission by aphids. We show that treatment of infected oat tissue homogenate with sodium sulfite reduces transmission of the purified virus by aphids. Transmission electron microscopy data indicated no gross change in virion morphology due to treatments. However, treated virions were not acquired by aphids through the hindgut epithelial cells and were not transmitted when injected directly into the hemocoel. Analysis of virus preparations using nanoflow liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry revealed a number of host plant proteins co-purifying with viruses, some of which were lost following sodium sulfite treatment. Using targeted mass spectrometry, we show data suggesting that several of the virus-associated host plant proteins accumulated to higher levels in aphids that were fed on CYDV-infected plants compared to healthy plants. We propose two hypotheses to explain these observations, and these are not mutually exclusive: (a) that sodium sulfite treatment disrupts critical virion-host protein interactions required for aphid transmission, or (b) that host infection with CYDV modulates phloem protein expression in a way that is favorable for virus uptake by aphids. Importantly, the genes coding for the plant proteins associated with virus may be examined as targets in breeding cereal crops for new modes of virus resistance that disrupt phloem-virus or aphid-virus interactions.","Cilia, Michelle; Peter, Kari A.; Bereman, Michael S.; Howe, Kevin; Fish, Tara; Smith, Dawn; Gildow, Fredrick; MacCoss, Michael J.; Thannhauser, Theodore W.; Gray, Stewart M.",PLoS One,105,28
985,985,985,Evolutionary Dynamics of the Interferon-Induced Transmembrane Gene Family in Vertebrates,12.1282625,7.68252,2012-11-15,"Vertebrate interferon-induced transmembrane (IFITM) genes have been demonstrated to have extensive and diverse functions, playing important roles in the evolution of vertebrates. Despite observance of their functionality, the evolutionary dynamics of this gene family are complex and currently unknown. Here, we performed detailed evolutionary analyses to unravel the evolutionary history of the vertebrate IFITM family. A total of 174 IFITM orthologous genes and 112 pseudogenes were identified from 27 vertebrate genome sequences. The vertebrate IFITM family can be divided into immunity-related IFITM (IR-IFITM), IFITM5 and IFITM10 sub-families in phylogeny, implying origins from three different progenitors. In general, vertebrate IFITM genes are located in two loci, one containing the IFITM10 gene, and the other locus containing IFITM5 and various numbers of IR-IFITM genes. Conservation of evolutionary synteny was observed in these IFITM genes. Significant functional divergence was detected among the three IFITM sub-families. No gene duplication or positive selection was found in IFITM5 sub-family, implying the functional conservation of IFITM5 in vertebrate evolution, which is involved in bone formation. No IFITM5 locus was identified in the marmoset genome, suggesting a potential association with the tiny size of this monkey. The IFITM10 sub-family was divided into two groups: aquatic and terrestrial types. Functional divergence was detected between the two groups, and five IFITM10-like genes from frog were dispersed into the two groups. Both gene duplication and positive selection were observed in aquatic vertebrate IFITM10-like genes, indicating that IFITM10 might be associated with the adaptation to aquatic environments. A large number of lineage- and species-specific gene duplications were observed in IR-IFITM sub-family and positive selection was detected in IR-IFITM of primates and rodents. Because primates have experienced a long history of viral infection, such rapid expansion and positive selection suggests that the evolution of primate IR-IFITM genes is associated with broad-spectrum antiviral activity.","Zhang, Zhao; Liu, Jun; Li, Meng; Yang, Hui; Zhang, Chiyu",PLoS One,105,1
1058,1058,1058,Differential Response of Primary Alveolar Type I and Type II Cells to LPS Stimulation,12.380663,7.560578,2013-01-31,"The alveolar epithelium serves as a barrier between organism and environment and functions as the first line of protection against potential respiratory pathogens. Alveolar type II (TII) cells have traditionally been considered the immune cells of the alveolar epithelium, as they possess immunomodulatory functions; however, the precise role of alveolar type I (TI) cells, which comprise ∼95% of the alveolar epithelial surface area, in lung immunity is not clear. We sought to determine if there was a difference in the response of TI and TII cells to lung injury and if TI cells could actively participate in the alveolar immune response. TI cells isolated via fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) from LPS-injured rats demonstrated greater fold-induction of multiple inflammatory mediators than TII cells isolated in the same manner from the same animals. Levels of the cytokines TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-1β from cultured primary rat TI cells after LPS stimulation were significantly increased compared to similarly studied primary rat TII cells. We found that contrary to published reports, cultured TII cells produce relatively small amounts of TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-1β after LPS treatment; the higher levels of cytokine expression from cultured TII cells reported in the literature were likely from macrophage contamination due to traditional non-FACS TII cell isolation methods. Co-culture of TII cells with macrophages prior to LPS stimulation increased TNF-α and IL-6 production to levels reported by other investigators for TII cells, however, co-culture of TI cells and macrophages prior to LPS treatment resulted in marked increases in TNF-α and IL-6 production. Finally, exogenous surfactant blunted the IL-6 response to LPS in cultured TI cells. Taken together, these findings advocate a role for TI cells in the innate immune response and suggest that both TI and TII cells are active players in host defense mechanisms in the lung.","Wong, Mandi H.; Johnson, Meshell D.",PLoS One,105,1
1188,1188,1188,TRAF molecules in cell signaling and in human diseases,12.157452,7.3206816,2013-06-13,"The tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNF-R)-associated factor (TRAF) family of intracellular proteins were originally identified as signaling adaptors that bind directly to the cytoplasmic regions of receptors of the TNF-R superfamily. The past decade has witnessed rapid expansion of receptor families identified to employ TRAFs for signaling. These include Toll-like receptors (TLRs), NOD-like receptors (NLRs), RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs), T cell receptor, IL-1 receptor family, IL-17 receptors, IFN receptors and TGFβ receptors. In addition to their role as adaptor proteins, most TRAFs also act as E3 ubiquitin ligases to activate downstream signaling events. TRAF-dependent signaling pathways typically lead to the activation of nuclear factor-κBs (NF-κBs), mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), or interferon-regulatory factors (IRFs). Compelling evidence obtained from germ-line and cell-specific TRAF-deficient mice demonstrates that each TRAF plays indispensable and non-redundant physiological roles, regulating innate and adaptive immunity, embryonic development, tissue homeostasis, stress response, and bone metabolism. Notably, mounting evidence implicates TRAFs in the pathogenesis of human diseases such as cancers and autoimmune diseases, which has sparked new appreciation and interest in TRAF research. This review presents an overview of the current knowledge of TRAFs, with an emphasis on recent findings concerning TRAF molecules in signaling and in human diseases.","Xie, Ping",J Mol Signal,105,8

So far there are no effective therapeutic strategies to control this disease. Although the canine transferrin receptor (TfR) was identified as a receptor for CPV infection, whether extracellular domain of TfR (called soluble TfR (sTfR)) possesses anti-CPV activities remains elusive. Here, we used the recombinant sTfR prepared from HEK293T cells with codon-optimized gene structure to investigate its anti-CPV activity both in vitro and in vivo. Our results indicated that codon optimization could significantly improve sTfR expression in HEK293T cells. The prepared recombinant sTfR possessed a binding activity to both CPV and CPV VP2 capsid proteins and significantly inhibited CPV infection of cultured feline F81 cells and decreased the mortality of CPV-infected dogs, which indicates that the sTfR has the anti-CPV activity both in vitro and in vivo.","Wen, Jiexia; Pan, Sumin; Liang, Shuang; Zhong, Zhenyu; He, Ying; Lin, Hongyu; Li, Wenyan; Wang, Liyue; Li, Xiujin; Zhong, Fei",Biomed Res Int,105,1
1278,1278,1278,Caveolin-1 Associated Adenovirus Entry into Human Corneal Cells,11.9104395,7.502664,2013-10-11,"The cellular entry of viruses represents a critical area of study, not only for viral tropism, but also because viral entry dictates the nature of the immune response elicited upon infection. Epidemic keratoconjunctivitis (EKC), caused by viruses within human adenovirus species D (HAdV-D), is a severe, ocular surface infection associated with corneal inflammation. Clathrin-mediated endocytosis has previously been shown to play a critical role in entry of other HAdV species into many host cell types. However, HAdV-D endocytosis into corneal cells has not been extensively studied. Herein, we show an essential role for cholesterol rich, lipid raft microdomains and caveolin-1, in the entry of HAdV-D37 into primary human corneal fibroblasts. Cholesterol depletion using methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD) profoundly reduced viral infection. When replenished with soluble cholesterol, the effect of MβCD was reversed, allowing productive viral infection. HAdV-D37 DNA was identified in caveolin-1 rich endosomal fractions after infection. Src kinase activity was also increased in caveolin-1 rich endosomal fractions after infection, and Src phosphorylation and CXCL1 induction were both decreased in caveolin-1-/- mice corneas compared to wild type mice. siRNA knock down of caveolin-1 in corneal cells reduced chemokine induction upon viral infection, and caveolin-1-/- mouse corneas showed reduced cellular entry of HAdV-D37. As a control, HAdV-C2, a non-corneal pathogen, appeared to utilize the caveolar pathway for entry into A549 cells, but failed to infect corneal cells entirely, indicating virus and cell specific tropism. Immuno-electron microscopy confirmed the presence of caveolin-1 in HAdV-D37-containing vesicles during the earliest stages of viral entry. Collectively, these experiments indicate for the first time that HAdV-D37 uses a lipid raft mediated caveolin-1 associated pathway for entry into corneal cells, and connects the processes of viral entry with downstream proinflammatory cell signaling.","Yousuf, Mohammad A.; Zhou, Xiaohong; Mukherjee, Santanu; Chintakuntlawar, Ashish V.; Lee, Jeong Yoon; Ramke, Mirja; Chodosh, James; Rajaiya, Jaya",PLoS One,105,11

VacA induces apoptotic cell death, which is potentiated by ammonia. VacA also causes cell death by mitochondrial damage, via signaling pathways that are not fully defined. Our aim was to determine whether endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is associated with VacA-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis. We found that C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), a key signaling protein of ER stress-induced apoptosis, was transcriptionally up-regulated following incubation of gastric epithelial cells with VacA. The effect of VacA on CHOP induction was significantly enhanced by co-incubation with ammonium chloride. Phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2)-alpha, which is known to occur downstream of the ER stress sensor PKR-like ER-localized eIF2-alpha kinase (PERK) and to regulate CHOP expression, was also observed following incubation with VacA in the presence of ammonium chloride. Knockdown of CHOP by siRNA resulted in inhibition of VacA-induced apoptosis. Further studies showed that silencing of the PERK gene with siRNA attenuated VacA-mediated phosphorylation of eIF2-alpha, CHOP induction, expression of BH3-only protein Bim and Bax activation, and cell death induced by VacA with ammonium chloride, indicating that ER stress may lead to mitochondrial dysfunction during VacA-induced toxicity. Activation of ER stress and up-regulation of BH3-only proteins were also observed in human H. pylori-infected gastric mucosa.

Oct4 of maternal origin is postulated to play critical role in defining totipotency and inducing pluripotency during embryonic development.

These results indicate that Oct4 is not essential for the initiation of pluripotency, in contrast to its critical role in maintaining pluripotency. This conclusion is further supported by the formation of Oct4-GFP– and Nanog- expressing inner cell masses (ICMs) in embryos with complete inactivation of both maternal and zygotic Oct4 expression and the reprogramming of fibroblasts into fully pluripotent cells by Oct4-deficient oocytes.","Wu, Guangming; Schöler, Hans R",Cell Regen (Lond),105,8
1648,1648,1648,The discriminative capacity of soluble Toll-like receptor (sTLR)2 and sTLR4 in inflammatory diseases,12.097213,7.7406216,2014-11-19,"BACKGROUND: The extracellular domains of cytokine receptors are released during inflammation, but little is known about the shedding of Toll-like receptors (TLR) and whether they can be used as diagnostic biomarkers. METHODS: The release of sTLR2 and sTLR4 was studied in in-vitro stimulations, as well as in-vivo during experimental human endotoxemia (n = 11, 2 ng/kg LPS), and in plasma of 394 patients with infections (infectious mononucleosis, measles, respiratory tract infections, bacterial sepsis and candidemia) or non-infectious inflammation (Crohn’s disease, gout, rheumatoid arthritis, autoinflammatory syndromes and pancreatitis). Using C-statistics, the value of sTLR2 and sTLR4 levels for discrimination between infections and non-infectious inflammatory diseases, as well as between viral and bacterial infections was analyzed. RESULTS: In-vitro, peripheral blood mononuclear cells released sTLR2 and sTLR4 by exposure to microbial ligands. During experimental human endotoxemia, plasma concentrations peaked after 2 hours (sTLR4) and 4 hours (sTLR2). sTLR4 did not correlate with cytokines, but sTLR2 correlated positively with TNFα (r(s) = 0.80, P < 0.05), IL-6 (r(s) = 0.65, P < 0.05), and IL-1Ra (r(s) = 0.57, P = 0.06), and negatively with IL-10 (r(s) = -0.58, P = 0.06), respectively. sTLR4 had a similar area under the ROC curve [AUC] for differentiating infectious and non-infectious inflammation compared to CRP: 0.72 (95% CI 0.66-0.79) versus 0.74 (95% CI 0.69-0.80) [P = 0.80], while sTLR2 had a lower AUC: 0.60 (95% CI 0.54-0.66) [P = 0.0004]. CRP differentiated bacterial infections better from viral infections than sTLR2 and sTLR4: AUC 0.94 (95% CI 0.90-0.96) versus 0.58 (95% CI 0.51-0.64) and 0.75 (95% CI 0.70-0.80), respectively [P < 0.0001 for both].

1695,1695,1695,Minimal within-host dengue models highlight the specific roles of the immune response in primary and secondary dengue infections,12.386352,7.678782,2015-02-06,"In recent years, the within-host viral dynamics of dengue infections have been increasingly characterized, and the relationship between aspects of these dynamics and the manifestation of severe disease has been increasingly probed. Despite this progress, there are few mathematical models of within-host dengue dynamics, and the ones that exist focus primarily on the general role of immune cells in the clearance of infected cells, while neglecting other components of the immune response in limiting viraemia. Here, by considering a suite of mathematical within-host dengue models of increasing complexity, we aim to isolate the critical components of the innate and the adaptive immune response that suffice in the reproduction of several well-characterized features of primary and secondary dengue infections. By building up from a simple target cell limited model, we show that only the innate immune response is needed to recover the characteristic features of a primary symptomatic dengue infection, while a higher rate of viral infectivity (indicative of antibody-dependent enhancement) and infected cell clearance by T cells are further needed to recover the characteristic features of a secondary dengue infection. We show that these minimal models can reproduce the increased risk of disease associated with secondary heterologous infections that arises as a result of a cytokine storm, and, further, that they are consistent with virological indicators that predict the onset of severe disease, such as the magnitude of peak viraemia, time to peak viral load, and viral clearance rate. Finally, we show that the effectiveness of these virological indicators to predict the onset of severe disease depends on the contribution of T cells in fuelling the cytokine storm.","Ben-Shachar, Rotem; Koelle, Katia",J R Soc Interface,105,1

Recent studies in mouse models have revealed an indispensable role for the innate immune system in defense against influenza virus. Recognition of the virus by innate immune receptors in a multitude of cell types activates intricate signaling networks, functioning to restrict viral replication. Downstream effector mechanisms include activation of innate immune cells and, induction and regulation of adaptive immunity. However, uncontrolled innate responses are associated with exaggerated disease, especially in pandemic influenza virus infection. Despite advances in the understanding of innate response to influenza in the mouse model, there is a large knowledge gap in humans, particularly in immunocompromised groups such as infants and the elderly. We propose here, the need for further studies in humans to decipher the role of innate immunity to influenza virus, particularly at the site of infection. These studies will complement the existing work in mice and facilitate the quest to design improved vaccines and therapeutic strategies against influenza.","Pulendran, Bali; Maddur, Mohan S.",Influenza Pathogenesis and Control - Volume II,105,1

The placenta releases an immunosuppressive endogenous retroviral protein syncytin-1. We hypothesised that exposure of peripheral monocytes (PBMCs) to syncytin-1 would impair responses to H1N1pdm09 influenza. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Recombinant syncytin-1 was produced. PBMCs from non-pregnant women (n=10) were exposed to H1N1pdm09 in the presence and absence of syncytin-1 and compared to responses of PBMCs from pregnant women (n=12). PBMCs were characterised using flow cytometry, release of interferon (IFN)-α, IFN-λ, IFN-γ, IL-10, IL-2, IL-6 and IL-1β were measured by cytometric bead array or ELISA. Exposure of PBMCs to H1N1pdm09 resulted in the release of IFN-α, (14,787 pg/mL, 95% CI 7311-22,264 pg/mL) IFN-λ (1486 pg/mL, 95% CI 756-2216 pg/mL) and IFN-γ (852 pg/mL, 95% CI 193-1511 pg/mL) after 48 hours. This was significantly impaired in pregnant women (IFN-α; p<0.0001 and IFN-λ; p<0.001). Furthermore, in the presence of syncytin-1, PBMCs demonstrated marked reductions in IFN-α and IFN-λ, while enhanced release of IL-10 as well as IL-6 and IL-1β. CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicates that a placental derived protein, syncytin-1 may be responsible for the heightened vulnerability of pregnant women to influenza.","Tolosa, Jorge M.; Parsons, Kristy S.; Hansbro, Philip M.; Smith, Roger; Wark, Peter A.

In this study, we characterize 21 GM-CSF autoantibodies from PAP patients and find that somatic mutations critically determine their specificity for the self-antigen. Individual antibodies only partially neutralize GM-CSF activity using an in vitro bioassay, depending on the experimental conditions, while, when injected in mice together with human GM-CSF, they lead to the accumulation of a large pool of circulating GM-CSF that remains partially bioavailable. In contrast, a combination of three non-cross-competing antibodies completely neutralizes GM-CSF activity in vitro by sequestering the cytokine in high-molecular-weight complexes, and in vivo promotes the rapid degradation of GM-CSF-containing immune complexes in an Fc-dependent manner. Taken together, these findings provide a plausible explanation for the severe phenotype of PAP patients and for the safety of treatments based on single anti-GM-CSF monoclonal antibodies.","Piccoli, Luca; Campo, Ilaria; Fregni, Chiara Silacci; Rodriguez, Blanca Maria Fernandez; Minola, Andrea; Sallusto, Federica; Luisetti, Maurizio; Corti, Davide; Lanzavecchia, Antonio",Nat Commun,105,1

EGCG has been extensively investigated as a multi-targeting anti-tumor and anti-inflammatory compound. In this study, we demonstrated a novel mechanism by which EGCG reverses the neutrophil elastase-induced migration of A549 cells. We found that neutrophil elastase directly triggered human adenocarcinoma A549 cell migration and that EGCG suppressed the elevation of tumor cell migration induced by neutrophil elastase. We observed that EGCG directly binds to neutrophil elastase and inhibits its enzymatic activity based on the CDOCKER algorithm, MD stimulation by GROMACS, SPR assay and elastase enzymatic activity assay. As the natural inhibitor of neutrophil elastase, α1-antitrypsin is synthesized in tumor cells. We further demonstrated that the expression of α1-antitrypsin was up-regulated after EGCG treatment in neutrophil elastase-treated A549 cells. We preliminarily discovered that the EGCG-mediated induction of α1-antitrypsin expression might be correlated with the regulatory effect of EGCG on the PI3K/Akt pathway. Overall, our results suggest that EGCG ameliorates the neutrophil elastase-induced migration of A549 cells. The mechanism underlying this effect may include two processes: EGCG directly binds to neutrophil elastase and inhibits its enzymatic activity; EGCG enhances the expression of α1-antitrypsin by regulating the PI3K/AKT pathway.","Xiaokaiti, Yilixiati; Wu, Haoming; Chen, Ya; Yang, Haopeng; Duan, Jianhui; Li, Xin; Pan, Yan; Tie, Lu; Zhang, Liangren; Li, Xuejun",Sci Rep,105,11
1947,1947,1947,The NLRP3 Inflammasome and IL-1β Accelerate Immunologically Mediated Pathology in Experimental Viral Fulminant Hepatitis,12.005657,7.6887355,2015-09-14,"Viral fulminant hepatitis (FH) is a severe disease with high mortality resulting from excessive inflammation in the infected liver. Clinical interventions have been inefficient due to the lack of knowledge for inflammatory pathogenesis in the virus-infected liver. We show that wild-type mice infected with murine hepatitis virus strain-3 (MHV-3), a model for viral FH, manifest with severe disease and high mortality in association with a significant elevation in IL-1β expression in the serum and liver. Whereas, the viral infection in IL-1β receptor-I deficient (IL-1R1 (-/-)) or IL-1R antagonist (IL-1Ra) treated mice, show reductions in virus replication, disease progress and mortality. IL-1R1 deficiency appears to debilitate the virus-induced fibrinogen-like protein-2 (FGL2) production in macrophages and CD45(+)Gr-1(high) neutrophil infiltration in the liver. The quick release of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by the infected macrophages suggests a plausible viral initiation of NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Further experiments show that mice deficient of p47 (phox), a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase subunit that controls acute ROS production, present with reductions in NLRP3 inflammasome activation and subsequent IL-1β secretion during viral infection, which appears to be responsible for acquiring resilience to viral FH. Moreover, viral infected animals in deficiencies of NLRP3 and Caspase-1, two essential components of the inflammasome complex, also have reduced IL-1β induction along with ameliorated hepatitis. Our results demonstrate that the ROS/NLRP3/IL-1β axis institutes an essential signaling pathway, which is over activated and directly causes the severe liver disease during viral infection, which sheds light on development of efficient treatments for human viral FH and other severe inflammatory diseases.","Guo, Sheng; Yang, Chengying; Diao, Bo; Huang, Xiaoyong; Jin, Meihua; Chen, Lili; Yan, Weiming; Ning, Qin; Zheng, Lixin; Wu, Yuzhang; Chen, Yongwen",PLoS Pathog,105,1

Metapneumovirus fusion (F) protein mediates the fusion of host cells with the virus membrane for infection. Trypsin- and/or low pH-induced membrane fusion is a strain-dependent phenomenon for hMPV. Here, we demonstrated that three subtypes of aMPV (aMPV/A, aMPV/B, and aMPV/C) F proteins promoted cell-cell fusion in the absence of trypsin. Indeed, in the presence of trypsin, only aMPV/C F protein fusogenicity was enhanced. Mutagenesis of the amino acids at position 100 and/or 101, located at a putative cleavage region in aMPV F proteins, revealed that the trypsin-mediated fusogenicity of aMPV F proteins is regulated by the residues at positions 100 and 101. Moreover, we demonstrated that aMPV/A and aMPV/B F proteins mediated cell-cell fusion independent of low pH, whereas the aMPV/C F protein did not. Mutagenesis of the residue at position 294 in the aMPV/A, aMPV/B, and aMPV/C F proteins showed that 294G played a critical role in F protein-mediated fusion under low pH conditions.

Studies have suggested that the excessive activation of the innate immunity by IFV is responsible for severe pathologies. In this study, we focused on CARD9, a signaling adaptor known to regulate innate immune activation through multiple innate sensor proteins, and investigated its role in anti-IFV defense and lung pathogenesis in a mouse model recapitulating severe influenza pneumonia with ARDS. We found that influenza pneumonia was dramatically attenuated in Card9-deficient mice, which showed improved mortality with reduced inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in the infected lungs. However, viral clearance, type-I interferon production, and the development of anti-viral B and T cell immunity were not compromised by CARD9 deficiency. Syk or CARD9-deficient DCs but not macrophages showed impaired cytokine but not type-I interferon production in response to IFV in vitro, indicating a possible role for the Syk-CARD9 pathway in DCs in excessive inflammation of IFV-infected lungs. Therefore, inhibition of this pathway is an ideal therapeutic target for severe influenza pneumonia without affecting viral clearance.","Uematsu, Takayuki; Iizasa, Ei’ichi; Kobayashi, Noritada; Yoshida, Hiroki; Hara, Hiromitsu",Sci Rep,105,1
2128,2128,2128,Impact of selenium supplementation on fish antiviral responses: a whole transcriptomic analysis in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) fed supranutritional levels of Sel-Plex®,12.010387,7.51688,2016-02-16,"BACKGROUND: Selenium (Se) is required for the synthesis of proteins (selenoproteins) with essential biological functions. Selenoproteins have a crucial role in the maintenance of cellular redox homeostasis in nearly all tissues, and are also involved in thyroid hormone metabolism, inflammation and immunity. Several immune processes rely on Se status and can be compromised if this element is present below the required level. Previous work has supported the notion that when Se is delivered at levels above those deemed to be the minimal required but below toxic concentrations it can have a boosting effect on the organism’s immune response. Based on this concept Se-enriched supplements may represent a valuable resource for functional feeds in animal farming, including aquaculture. RESULTS: In this study we tested the effects of Se supplemented as Sel-Plex during an immune challenge induced by polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C)), a pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) that mimics viral infection. Trout were fed two diets enriched with 1 or 4 mg Se Kg(−1) of feed (dry weight) by Sel-Plex addition and a commercial formulation as control. The whole trout transcriptomic response was investigated by microarray and gene ontology analysis, the latter carried out to highlight the biological processes that were influenced by Sel-Plex supplementation in the head kidney (HK) and liver, the main immune and metabolic organs in fish. Overall, Sel-Plex enrichement up to 4 mg Se Kg(−1) induced an important response in the trout HK, eliciting an up-regulation of several genes involved in pathways connected with hematopoiesis and immunity. In contrast, a more constrained response was seen in the liver, with lipid metabolism being the main pathway altered by Se supplementation. Upon stimulation with poly(I:C), supplementation of 4 mg Se Kg(−1) increased the expression of principal mediators of the antiviral defences, especially IFN-γ, and down-stream molecules involved in the cell-mediated immune response. CONCLUSIONS: Supplementation of diets with 4 mg Se Kg(−1) using Sel-Plex remarkably improved the fish response to viral PAMP stimulation. Sel-Plex, being a highly bioavailable supplement of organic Se, might represent a suitable option for supplementation of fish feeds, to achieve the final aim of improving fish fitness and resistance against immune challenges.

In this study, we investigated the relationship between induction of IFN and IFN-stimulated gene responses in vivo and the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of NS1-truncated LAIV. Our data demonstrates that accelerated antibody induction and protective efficacy of NS1-truncated LAIV correlates well with upregulation of IFN-stimulated genes.

In the coleoid cephalopods, a lens with a graded refractive index provides good vision and is required for survival. Cephalopod S-crystallin is thought to have evolved from glutathione S-transferase (GST) with various homologs differentially expressed in the lens. However, there is no direct structural information that helps to delineate the mechanisms by which S-crystallin could have evolved. Here we report the structural and biochemical characterization of novel S-crystallin-glutathione complex. The 2.35-Å crystal structure of a S-crystallin mutant from Octopus vulgaris reveals an active-site architecture that is different from that of GST. S-crystallin has a preference for glutathione binding, although almost lost its GST enzymatic activity. We’ve also identified four historical mutations that are able to produce a “GST-like” S-crystallin that has regained activity. This protein recapitulates the evolution of S-crystallin from GST. Protein stability studies suggest that S-crystallin is stabilized by glutathione binding to prevent its aggregation; this contrasts with GST-σ, which do not possess this protection. We suggest that a tradeoff between enzyme activity and the stability of the lens protein might have been one of the major driving force behind lens evolution.","Tan, Wei-Hung; Cheng, Shu-Chun; Liu, Yu-Tung; Wu, Cheng-Guo; Lin, Min-Han; Chen, Chiao-Che; Lin, Chao-Hsiung; Chou, Chi-Yuan",Sci Rep,105,1

The molecular basis of this striking difference in the response to filovirus infections is not well understood. We report a systematic overview of differentially expressed genes, activity motifs and pathways in human and bat cells infected with the Ebola and Marburg viruses, and we demonstrate that the replication of filoviruses is more rapid in human cells than in bat cells. We also found that the most strongly regulated genes upon filovirus infection are chemokine ligands and transcription factors. We observed a strong induction of the JAK/STAT pathway, of several genes encoding inhibitors of MAP kinases (DUSP genes) and of PPP1R15A, which is involved in ER stress-induced cell death.

Changes in the tissue-specific exosomal protein expression may underlie pathological conditions whereby extracellular matrix turnover and homeostasis is disrupted. Ocular hypertension due to extracellular matrix accumulation in the trabecular meshwork is a hallmark of glucocorticoid-induced glaucoma. In the trabecular meshwork, exosomal fibronectin mediates cell matrix interactions at cellular structures called “invadosomes”. Trabecular meshwork cells use invadosomes to turn over their surrounding matrix and maintain passageways for flow of aqueous humor. In this study, we observed that human trabecular meshwork explants treated with dexamethasone released exosomes with significantly reduced amounts of fibronectin bound per exosome. Further, we found that exosome-fibronectin binding is heparan sulfate-dependent, consistent with our observation that trabecular meshwork exosomes are enriched in the heparin/heparan sulfate binding annexins A2 and A6. In this way, dexamethasone-treated explants released exosomes with a significant reduction in annexin A2 and A6 per exosome. Interestingly, we did not detect exosomal matrix metalloproteinases, but we identified abundant dipeptidyl peptidase 4, a serine protease whose activity was reduced on exosomes isolated from dexamethasone-treated explants.

During ADE, DENV is opsonized with non- or sub-neutralizing antibody levels that augment entry into monocytes and dendritic cells through Fc-gamma receptors (FcγRs). We previously reported that co-ligation of leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor-B1 (LILRB1) by antibody-opsonized DENV led to recruitment of SH2 domain-containing phosphatase-1 (SHP-1) to dephosphorylate spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) and reduce interferon stimulated gene induction. Here, we show that LILRB1 also signals through SHP-1 to attenuate the otherwise rapid acidification for lysosomal enzyme activation following FcγR-mediated uptake of DENV.

2551,2551,2551,Expression and bioactivity of human α-fetoprotein in a Bac-to-Bac system,12.115743,7.720536,2017-01-17,"α-fetoprotein (AFP) is an early serum growth factor in foetal embryonic development and hepatic oncogenesis. A growing number of investigations of AFP as a tumour-specific biomarker have concluded that AFP is an important target for cancer treatment. AFP also plays an immunomodulatory role in the treatment of several autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, myasthenia gravis and thyroiditis. In an effort to support biochemical screening and drug design and discovery, we attempted to express and purify human AFP in a Bac-to-Bac system. Two key factors affecting the expression of recombinant human AFP (R-AFP), namely the infectious baculovirus inoculum volume and the culturing time post-infection, were optimized to maximize the yield. We achieved a high yield of approximately 1.5 mg/l of harvested medium with a 72–96 h incubation period after infection and an inoculum volume ratio of 1:100. We also assessed the role of R-AFP in the proliferation of the human liver cancer cell line Bel 7402, and the results indicated that R-AFP promoted the growth of hepatoma cells. We concluded that this method can produce high yields of R-AFP, which can be used for studies related to AFP.","Lin, Bo; Liu, Kun; Wang, Wenting; Li, Wei; Dong, Xu; Chen, Yi; Lu, Yan; Guo, Junli; Zhu, Mingyue; Li, Mengsen",Biosci Rep,105,11

The polygenic responses to these external stimuli are temporally and coordinately regulated. Specific lncRNAs are induced to modulate innate and adaptive immune responses which can function through various target interactions like RNA-DNA, RNA-RNA, and RNA-protein interaction and hence affect the immunogenic regulation at various stages of gene expression. LncRNA are found to be present in various immune cells like monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, neutrophils, T cells and B cells. They have been shown to be involved in many biological processes, including the regulation of the expression of genes, the dosage compensation and genomics imprinting, but the knowledge how lncRNAs are regulated and how they alter cell differentiation/function is still obscure. Further dysregulation of lncRNA has been seen in many diseases, but as yet very less research has been carried out to understand the role of lncRNAs in regulation during host-pathogens interactions. In this review, we summarize the functional developments and mechanism of action of lncRNAs, in immunity and defense of host against pathogens.","Mumtaz, Peerzada Tajamul; Bhat, Shakil Ahmad; Ahmad, Syed Mudasir; Dar, Mashooq Ahmad; Ahmed, Raashid; Urwat, Uneeb; Ayaz, Aadil; Shrivastava, Divya; Shah, Riaz Ahmad; Ganai, Nazir Ahmad",Biol Proced Online,105,1

We previously demonstrated exacerbation of JE following CD11c(hi) dendritic cell (DC) ablation in CD11c-DTR transgenic mice. Moreover, CD11c(hi) DC ablation led to abnormal differentiation of CD11b(+)Ly-6C(hi) monocytes and enhanced permeability of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), resulting in promoting the progression of JE. Here, we examined changes in lymphoid and myeloid-derived leukocyte subpopulations associated with pro- and anti-inflammation during JE progression. The analyses of this study focused on regulatory CD4(+)Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells (Tregs), IL-17(+)CD4(+) Th17 cells, and CD11b(+)Ly-6C(hi) and Ly-6C(lo) monocytes. CD11c(hi) DC ablation resulted in the accumulation of IL-17(+)CD4(+) Th17 cells in the CNS, thereby leading to lower ratio of Tregs to Th17 cells. This result was corroborated by the higher expression levels of IL-17 and RORγT in CD4(+) T cells from the brains of CD11c(hi) DC-ablated mice. In addition, CD11c(hi) DC-ablated mice showed higher frequency and total number of inflammatory CD11b(+)Ly-6C(hi) monocytes, whereas CD11b(+)Ly-6C(lo) monocytes were detected with lower frequency and total number in CD11c(hi) DC-ablated mice. Furthermore, CD11c(hi) DC ablation altered the phenotype and function of CD11b(+)Ly-6C(lo) monocytes, resulting in lower levels of activation marker and anti-inflammatory cytokine (IL-10 and TGF-β) expression. Collectively, these results indicate that CD11c(hi) DC ablation caused an imbalance in CD4(+) Th17/Treg cells and CD11b(+)Ly-6C(hi)/Ly-6C(lo) monocytes in the lymphoid tissue and CNS during JE progression. This imbalanced orchestration of pro- and anti-inflammatory leukocytes following CD11c(hi) DC ablation may contribute to the exacerbation of JE.","Choi, Jin Young; Kim, Jin Hyoung; Patil, Ajit Mahadev; Kim, Seong Bum; Uyangaa, Erdenebelig; Hossain, Ferdaus Mohd Altaf; Eo, Seong Kug",Immune Netw,105,8

Phylogenetic analysis of these two novel avian influenza viruses (AIVs) suggested that their genomes reassorted between the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) and Pearl River Delta (PRD) clades. Molecular clock analysis indicated that they emerged several months before the HP human strains.

Here we show that local lung hypoxia, through hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF1α), drives Notch signalling and Krt5(pos) basal-like cell expansion. Single-cell transcriptional profiling of human AEC2s from fibrotic lungs revealed a hypoxic subpopulation with activated Notch, suppressed surfactant protein C (SPC), and transdifferentiation toward a Krt5(pos) basal-like state. Activated murine Krt5(pos) LNEPs and diseased human AEC2s upregulate strikingly similar core pathways underlying migration and squamous metaplasia. While robust, HIF1α-driven metaplasia is ultimately inferior to AEC2 reconstitution in restoring normal lung function. HIF1α deletion or enhanced Wnt/β-catenin activity in Sox2(pos) LNEPs blocks Notch and Krt5 activation, instead promoting rapid AEC2 differentiation and migration and improving the quality of alveolar repair.

2929,2929,2929,Telomere Dynamics in Immune Senescence and Exhaustion Triggered by Chronic Viral Infection,12.065584,7.6259403,2017-10-05,"The progressive loss of immunological memory during aging correlates with a reduced proliferative capacity and shortened telomeres of T cells. Growing evidence suggests that this phenotype is recapitulated during chronic viral infection. The antigenic volume imposed by persistent and latent viruses exposes the immune system to unique challenges that lead to host T-cell exhaustion, characterized by impaired T-cell functions. These dysfunctional memory T cells lack telomerase, the protein capable of extending and stabilizing chromosome ends, imposing constraints on telomere dynamics. A deleterious consequence of this excessive telomere shortening is the premature induction of replicative senescence of viral-specific CD8+ memory T cells. While senescent cells are unable to expand, they can survive for extended periods of time and are more resistant to apoptotic signals. This review takes a closer look at T-cell exhaustion in chronic viruses known to cause human disease: Epstein–Barr virus (EBV), Hepatitis B/C/D virus (HBV/HCV/HDV), human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I), human papillomavirus (HPV), herpes simplex virus-1/2 (HSV-1/2), and Varicella–Zoster virus (VZV). Current literature linking T-cell exhaustion with critical telomere lengths and immune senescence are discussed. The concept that enduring antigen stimulation leads to T-cell exhaustion that favors telomere attrition and a cell fate marked by enhanced T-cell senescence appears to be a common endpoint to chronic viral infections.","Bellon, Marcia; Nicot, Christophe",Viruses,105,1

The re-emergence of CHIKV and the continual risk of new epidemics have reignited research in CHIKV pathogenesis. Virus-specific antibodies have been shown to control virus clearance, but antibodies present at sub-neutralizing concentrations can also augment virus infection that exacerbates disease severity. To explore this occurrence, CHIKV infection was investigated in the presence of CHIKV-specific antibodies in both primary human cells and a murine macrophage cell line, RAW264.7. Enhanced attachment of CHIKV to the primary human monocytes and B cells was observed while increased viral replication was detected in RAW264.7 cells. Blocking of specific Fc receptors (FcγRs) led to the abrogation of these observations. Furthermore, experimental infection in adult mice showed that animals had higher viral RNA loads and endured more severe joint inflammation in the presence of sub-neutralizing concentrations of CHIKV-specific antibodies. In addition, CHIKV infection in 11 days old mice under enhancing condition resulted in higher muscles viral RNA load detected and death. These observations provide the first evidence of antibody-mediated enhancement in CHIKV infection and pathogenesis and could also be relevant for other important arboviruses such as Zika virus.","Lum, Fok-Moon; Couderc, Thérèse; Chia, Bing-Shao; Ong, Ruo-Yan; Her, Zhisheng; Chow, Angela; Leo, Yee-Sin; Kam, Yiu-Wing; Rénia, Laurent; Lecuit, Marc; Ng, Lisa F.

However, the exact molecular pathways underlying these effects remain poorly clarified. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the cytotoxic effect of emodin on HepaRG cells and to define the underlying mechanism. The results demonstrated that emodin evidently inhibited HepaRG cell growth in a dose- and time-dependent manner by blocking cell cycle progression in the S and G2/M phase and by inducing apoptosis. Emodin treatment also resulted in generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which abrogated mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP). The above effects were all suppressed by antioxidants, such as N-acetylcysteine (NAC). Further studies by western blot analysis howed that emodin upregulated p53, p21, Bax, cyclin E, cleaved caspase-3, 8 and 9, and cleaved poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase (PARP). However, the protein expression of Bcl-2, cyclin A and CDK2 was downregulated.

Since the inhibition of v-ATPase resulted in anti-tumor and anti-metastatic effects in different tumor models, this enzyme has emerged as promising strategy against cancer. Here, we used the well-established v-ATPase inhibitor archazolid, a natural product first isolated from the myxobacterium Archangium gephyra, to study the consequences of v-ATPase inhibition in endothelial cells (ECs), in particular on the interaction between ECs and cancer cells, which has been neglected so far. Human endothelial cells treated with archazolid showed an increased adhesion of tumor cells, whereas the transendothelial migration of tumor cells was reduced. The adhesion process was independent from the EC adhesion molecules ICAM-1, VCAM-1, E-selectin and N-cadherin. Instead, the adhesion was mediated by β1-integrins expressed on tumor cells, as blocking of the integrin β1 subunit reversed this process. Tumor cells preferentially adhered to the β1-integrin ligand collagen and archazolid led to an increase in the amount of collagen on the surface of ECs. The accumulation of collagen was accompanied by a strong decrease of the expression and activity of the protease cathepsin B. Overexpression of cathepsin B in ECs prevented the capability of archazolid to increase the adhesion of tumor cells onto ECs. Our study demonstrates that the inhibition of v-ATPase by archazolid induces a pro-adhesive phenotype in endothelial cells that promotes their interaction with cancer cells, whereas the transmigration of tumor cells was reduced. These findings further support archazolid as a promising anti-metastatic compound.","Luong, Betty; Schwenk, Rebecca; Bräutigam, Jacqueline; Müller, Rolf; Menche, Dirk; Bischoff, Iris; Fürst, Robert",PLoS One,105,8

Estimating the transmissibility, which is usually characterized by the basic reproductive number R(0), the mean number of secondary infectious cases generated by a single primary infectious case introduced into a totally susceptible population, provides crucial information for the effort required to stop infection spreading. Hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted indirectly through contaminated food and environment. An outbreak from March to June 2011 was reported to have occurred at an elementary school of 698 pupils in China and it was found that the outbreak was due to direct transmission between school children. Based on the symptom onset date and the social contact network of the children, in this study we estimate the serial interval (i.e. the gap in symptom onset between an infectee and its infector) and use different statistical methods to estimate R(0). Combining with the positivity of IgG antibodies tests, we develop a compartmental transmission dynamics model which includes both asymptomatic and symptomatic infections to estimate the overall R(0). Our analysis suggests a serial interval of mean = 23.9 days and standard deviation = 20.9 days. The different statistical methods suggest estimates for R(0) in the outbreak varying from 2.1 to 2.8, and the estimates from the transmission dynamics model are consistent with this range. Our estimates are in agreement with that from one study in England but are higher than that from one study in the United States. Our transmission dynamics model suggests that the proportion of symptomatic infections is about 9%, implying that there were about 344 asymptomatic infections along with the 32 observed symptomatic cases. Furthermore, it is shown that the inclusion of asymptomatic infection in the epidemic process increases the estimate of R(0) but does not do so greatly provided that the proportion of symptomatic infections is constant over the outbreak and there is no difference in transmissibility between symptomatic and asymptomatic infections.","Zhang, Xu-Sheng; Iacono, Giovanni Lo",PLoS One,105,11

In this study, we examined whether combining TLR-Ls with HVT can boost host immunity against MD and improve its efficacy. Results demonstrated that HVT alone or HVT combined with encapsulated CpG-ODN partially protected chickens from tumor incidence and reduced virus replication compared to the control group. However, encapsulated CpG-ODN only moderately, but not significantly, improved HVT efficacy and reduced tumor incidence from 53% to 33%.

IL-35 plays a pivotal role in the development and the function of both regulatory B (Bregs) and T cells (Tregs). In order to further its therapeutic potential, a dairy Lactococcus lactis strain was engineered to express murine IL-35 (LL-IL35), and this recombinant strain was applied to suppress collagen-induced arthritis (CIA). Oral administration of LL-IL35 effectively reduced the incidence and disease severity of CIA. When administered therapeutically, LL-IL35 abruptly halted CIA progression with no increase in disease severity by reducing neutrophil influx into the joints. LL-IL35 treatment reduced IFN-γ and IL-17 3.7- and 8.5-fold, respectively, and increased IL-10 production compared to diseased mice. Foxp3(+) and Foxp3(−) CD39(+) CD4(+) T cells were previously shown to be the Tregs responsible for conferring protection against CIA.

Apoptosis is an initiative cell death process that is controlled by genes and is mainly divided into endogenous pathways (mitochondrial pathway), exogenous pathways (death receptor pathway), and apoptotic pathways induced by endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. The homeostasis imbalance in ER results in ER stress. Under specific conditions, ER stress can be beneficial to the body; however, if ER protein homeostasis is not restored, the prolonged activation of the unfolded protein response may initiate apoptotic cell death via the up-regulation of the C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP). CHOP plays an important role in ER stress-induced apoptosis and this review focuses on its multifunctional roles in that process, as well as its role in apoptosis during microbial infection. We summarize the upstream and downstream pathways of CHOP in ER stress induced apoptosis.

A significant number of people chronically infected with HCV develop cirrhosis and/or liver cancer. The pathophysiologic mechanisms of hepatocyte damage associated with chronic HCV infection are not fully understood yet, mainly due to the lack of an in vitro system able to recapitulate the stages of infection in vivo. Several studies underline that HCV virus replication depends on redox-sensitive cellular pathways; in addition, it is known that virus itself induces alterations of the cellular redox state. However, the exact interplay between HCV replication and oxidative stress has not been elucidated. In particular, the role of reduced glutathione (GSH) in HCV replication and infection is still not clear. We set up an in vitro system, based on low m.o.i. of Huh7.5 cell line with a HCV infectious clone (J6/JFH1), that reproduced the acute and persistent phases of HCV infection up to 76 days of culture. We demonstrated that the acute phase of HCV infection is characterized by the elevated levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) associated in part with an increase of NADPH-oxidase transcripts and activity and a depletion of GSH accompanied by high rates of viral replication and apoptotic cell death. Conversely, the chronic phase is characterized by a reestablishment of reduced environment due to a decreased ROS production and increased GSH content in infected cells that might concur to the establishment of viral persistence. Treatment with the prooxidant auranofin of the persistently infected cultures induced the increase of viral RNA titer, suggesting that a prooxidant state could favor the reactivation of HCV viral replication that in turn caused cell damage and death. Our results suggest that targeting the redox-sensitive host-cells pathways essential for viral replication and/or persistence may represent a promising option for contrasting HCV infection.","Anticoli, Simona; Amatore, Donatella; Matarrese, Paola; De Angelis, Marta; Palamara, Anna Teresa; Nencioni, Lucia; Ruggieri, Anna",Oxid Med Cell Longev,105,8

In cells infected with Singapore grouper iridovirus (SGIV), EcAtg5 expression declined during the early stage of infection and increased in the late stage. Fluorescence microscopy revealed that EcAtg5 mainly localized with a dot-like pattern in the cytoplasm of grouper cells. Overexpression of EcAtg5 significantly increased the replication of RGNNV and SGIV at different levels of detection, as indicated by increased severity of the cytopathic effect, transcription levels of viral genes, and levels of viral proteins. Knockdown of EcAtg5 decreased the replication of RGNNV and SGIV. Further studies showed that overexpression EcAtg5 activated autophagy, decreased expression levels of interferon related cytokines or effectors and pro-inflammatory factors, and inhibited the activation of nuclear factor κB, IFN-sensitive response element, and IFNs. In addition, ectopic expression of EcAtg5 affected cell cycle progression by hindering the G1/S transition. Taken together, our results demonstrated that fish Atg5 exerted a crucial role in virus replication by promoting autophagy, down-regulating antiviral IFN responses, and affecting the cell cycle.","Li, Chen; Liu, Jiaxin; Zhang, Xin; Wei, Shina; Huang, Xiaohong; Huang, Youhua; Wei, Jingguang; Qin, Qiwei",Front Immunol,105,1

It is a devastating brain cancer that often results in death within approximately 12 to 15 months after diagnosis. In this work, optimal control theory was applied to regulate intracellular signaling pathways of miR-451–AMPK–mTOR–cell cycle dynamics via glucose and drug intravenous administration infusions. Glucose level is controlled to activate miR-451 in the up-stream pathway of the model. A potential drug blocking the inhibitory pathway of mTOR by AMPK complex is incorporated to explore regulation of the down-stream pathway to the cell cycle. Both miR-451 and mTOR levels are up-regulated inducing cell proliferation and reducing invasion in the neighboring tissues. Concomitant and alternating glucose and drug infusions are explored under various circumstances to predict best clinical outcomes with least administration costs.","Jung, Eunok; de los Reyes V, Aurelio A.; Pumares, Kurt Jan A.; Kim, Yangjin",PLoS One,105,1

Three methods to quantify chloroquine and its metabolite in blood matrices were developed and validated. METHODOLOGY & RESULTS: Different high-throughput extraction techniques were used to recover the drugs from whole blood (50 μl), plasma (100 μl) and dried blood spots (15 μl as punched discs) followed by quantification with LC–MS/MS. The intra- and inter-batch precisions were below 15%, and thus meet regulatory acceptance criteria. CONCLUSION: The developed methods demonstrated satisfactory validation performance with high sensitivity and selectivity. The assays used simple and easy to automate extraction techniques. All methods were reliable with robust performance and demonstrated to be suitable to implement into high-throughput routine analysis of clinical pharmacokinetic samples.","Kaewkhao, Karnrawee; Chotivanich, Kesinee; Winterberg, Markus; Day, Nicholas PJ; Tarning, Joel; Blessborn, Daniel",Bioanalysis,105,11

In this study, among 576 respiratory specimens from 476 mammals and 100 chickens, genogroup I PBVs were detected in three cattle and three monkeys, and a genogroup II PBV-positive sample was collected from one cattle specimen. More than one PBV sequence type was observed in two and one genogroup I PBV-positive samples from cattle and monkeys, respectively. Twenty-four complete/near-complete segments 2 (nine from respiratory and 15 from alimentary samples) from the cattle and monkey genogroup I PBVs and one complete segment 2 from the cattle genogroup II PBV were sequenced. Similar to other studies, the cattle PBVs also showed a high diversity. In contrast, the monkey PBVs observed in this study were clustered into three distinct clades. Within each clade, all the sequences showed >99% amino acid identities. This unique phenomenon is probably due to the fact that monkeys in our locality reside in separated troops with minimal inter-troop contact.","Woo, Patrick C. Y.; Teng, Jade L.

Here, we show that airway and interstitial T(RM) cells have distinct effector functions and that CXCR6 controls the partitioning of T(RM) cells within the lung by recruiting CD8 T(RM) cells to the airways. The absence of CXCR6 significantly decreases airway CD8 T(RM) cells due to altered trafficking of CXCR6(−/−) cells within the lung, and not decreased survival in the airways. CXCL16, the ligand for CXCR6, is localized primarily at the respiratory epithelium, and mice lacking CXCL16 also had decreased CD8 T(RM) cells in the airways. Finally, blocking CXCL16 inhibited the steady-state maintenance of airway T(RM) cells. Thus, the CXCR6/CXCL16 signaling axis controls the localization of T(RM) cells to different compartments of the lung and maintains airway T(RM) cells.","Wein, Alexander N.; McMaster, Sean R.; Takamura, Shiki; Dunbar, Paul R.; Cartwright, Emily K.; Hayward, Sarah L.; McManus, Daniel T.; Shimaoka, Takeshi; Ueha, Satoshi; Tsukui, Tatsuya; Masumoto, Tomoko; Kurachi, Makoto; Matsushima, Kouji; Kohlmeier, Jacob E.",J Exp Med,105,22

Sepsis consequently has a high mortality rate and a high rate of complications for survivors, despite modern medical advances. Therefore, drug identification and validation for the treatment of sepsis is of the utmost importance. As a selective phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor, rolipram also exhibits the abilities of inhibiting multiple pro-inflammatory cytokines production in macrophages and toxin-induced inflammation in mice. However, this drug has never been studied as a sepsis treatment method. We found that rolipram significantly improves survival in mice challenged with gram-negative bacterium E. coli, CLP, or E. coli derived lipopolysaccharide. We have also found that rolipram inhibits organ damage, pro-inflammatory cytokine production, and intracellular migration of early-stage inflammatory elements. Our results also show that rolipram increases anti-inflammatory cytokine production. The protective effects of rolipram on septic mice may result from inhibition of the MAP kinase and NF-κB signaling pathways. Rolipram may therefore be a potential novel sepsis treatment, one that would bypass the time-consuming and costly drug-discovery process.","Lu, Xiaying; Wang, Juan; Chen, Xiaohuan; Jiang, Yong; Pan, Zhixing K.",Sci Rep,105,1
4456,4456,4456,Insights Into the Role of Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress in Infectious Diseases,11.925279,7.62336,2020-01-31,"Since cancer stem cells (CSCs) were first identified in leukemia in 1994, they have been considered promising therapeutic targets for cancer therapy. These cells have self-renewal capacity and differentiation potential and contribute to multiple tumor malignancies, such as recurrence, metastasis, heterogeneity, multidrug resistance, and radiation resistance. The biological activities of CSCs are regulated by several pluripotent transcription factors, such as OCT4, Sox2, Nanog, KLF4, and MYC. In addition, many intracellular signaling pathways, such as Wnt, NF-κB (nuclear factor-κB), Notch, Hedgehog, JAK-STAT (Janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription), PI3K/AKT/mTOR (phosphoinositide 3-kinase/AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin), TGF (transforming growth factor)/SMAD, and PPAR (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor), as well as extracellular factors, such as vascular niches, hypoxia, tumor-associated macrophages, cancer-associated fibroblasts, cancer-associated mesenchymal stem cells, extracellular matrix, and exosomes, have been shown to be very important regulators of CSCs. Molecules, vaccines, antibodies, and CAR-T (chimeric antigen receptor T cell) cells have been developed to specifically target CSCs, and some of these factors are already undergoing clinical trials. This review summarizes the characterization and identification of CSCs, depicts major factors and pathways that regulate CSC development, and discusses potential targeted therapy for CSCs.","Yang, Liqun; Shi, Pengfei; Zhao, Gaichao; Xu, Jie; Peng, Wen; Zhang, Jiayi; Zhang, Guanghui; Wang, Xiaowen; Dong, Zhen; Chen, Fei; Cui, Hongjuan",Signal Transduct Target Ther,105,1

Here we consider the invasion of a novel directly transmissible infection and perform an extensive, systematic and transparent comparison of models with explicit age and/or household structure, to determine the accuracy loss in predictions in the absence of interventions when ignoring either or both social components. We conclude that, with heterogeneous and assortative contact patterns relevant to respiratory infections, the model’s age stratification is crucial for accurate predictions. Conversely, the household structure is only needed if transmission is highly concentrated in households, as suggested by an empirical but robust rule of thumb based on household secondary attack rate. This work serves as a template to guide the simplicity/accuracy trade-off in designing models aimed at initial, rapid assessment of potential epidemic severity.","Pellis, Lorenzo; Cauchemez, Simon; Ferguson, Neil M.; Fraser, Christophe",Nat Commun,105,13

However, expression of recombinant rARU in E. coli using the standard vaccine production process was very low. Transcriptome and proteome analyses showed that at restricted dissolved oxygen (DO) the numbers of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) was 2.5-times lower than those expressed at unrestricted oxygen. Additionally, a 7.4-times smaller number of ribosome formation genes (needed for translation) were down-regulated as compared with unrestricted DO. Higher rARU expression at restricted DO was associated with up-regulation of 24 heat shock chaperones involved in protein folding and with the up-regulation of the global regulator RNA chaperone hfq. Cellular stress response leading to down-regulation of transcription, translation, and energy generating pathways at unrestricted DO were associated with lower rARU expression. Investigation of the C. difficile DNA sequence revealed the presence of cell wall binding profiles, which based on structural similarity prediction by BLASTp, can possibly interact with cellular proteins of E. coli such as the transcriptional repressor ulaR, and the ankyrins repeat proteins. At restricted DO, rARU mRNA was 5-fold higher and the protein expression 27-fold higher compared with unrestricted DO. The report shows a strategy for improved production of C. difficile vaccine candidate in E. coli by using restricted DO growth. This strategy could improve the expression of recombinant proteins from anaerobic origin or those with cell wall binding profiles.","Sharma, Ashish K.; Phue, Jenie; Khatipov, Emir; Dalal, Nimish; Anderson, Eric D.; Shiloach, Joseph",Sci Rep,105,11

A major virulence factor of P. gulae consists of a 41-kDa filamentous appendage (FimA) on the cell surface, which is classified into three genotypes: A, B, and C. Thus far, inhibition of periodontal disease in dogs remains difficult. The present study assessed the inhibitory effects of a combination of clindamycin and interferon alpha (IFN-α) formulation against P. gulae and periodontal disease. Growth of P. gulae was significantly inhibited by clindamycin; this inhibition had a greater effect on type C P. gulae than on type A and B isolates. In contrast, the IFN-α formulation inhibited the expression of IL-1β and COX-2 elicited by type A and B isolates, but not that elicited by type C isolates. Furthermore, periodontal recovery was promoted by the administration of both clindamycin and IFN-α formulation to dogs undergoing periodontal treatment; moreover, this combined treatment reduced the number of FimA genotypes in oral specimens from treated dogs. These results suggest that a combination of clindamycin and IFN-α formulation inhibit P. gulae virulence and thus may be effective for the prevention of periodontal disease induced by P. gulae.","Nomura, Ryota; Inaba, Hiroaki; Yasuda, Hidemi; Shirai, Mitsuyuki; Kato, Yukio; Murakami, Masaru; Iwashita, Naoki; Shirahata, So; Yoshida, Sho; Matayoshi, Saaya; Yasuda, Junya; Arai, Nobuaki; Asai, Fumitoshi; Matsumoto-Nakano, Michiyo; Nakano, Kazuhiko",Sci Rep,105,1

After biotinylation of apical or basolateral surfaces of confluent monolayers grown on polycarbonate filters, GPI-anchored proteins are identified by their shift from a Triton X-114 detergent-rich phase to a detergent-poor phase in the presence of phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C. All GPI-anchored proteins detected (3–9 per cell type, at least 13 different proteins) are found to be apically polarized; no GPI-anchored protein is observed preferentially localized to the basal surface. One of the GPI-anchored proteins is identified as carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). Survey of MDCK II-RCA(r), a mutant cell line with a pleiotropic defect in galactosylation of glycoproteins and glycolipids (that presumably affects GPI anchors) also reveals an apical polarization of all GPI-anchored proteins. In contrast, analysis of MDCK II-ConA′ (a mutant cell line with an unknown defect in glycosylation) revealed five GPI-anchored proteins, two of which appeared relatively unpolarized.

Given the potency of the molecule to regulate death and survival of many different cell types, the control of CD95L production, transport, storage, shedding and inactivation is of tremendous biological and clinical interest. This review summarizes the current knowledge, hypotheses and controversies about CD95L as a multifunctional ligand and receptor. It considers the different roles of membrane and soluble forms of CD95L and the complex networks of intracellular dynamics of protein trafficking, as well as the potential bidirectional signal transduction capacity of CD95L, with a focus on molecular interactions that have been worked out over the past years.","Janssen, O; Qian, J; Linkermann, A; Kabelitz, D",Cell Death Differ,105,28

Especially with the growing elderly population delirium occurs more frequently, often due to multiple causes. Although its prognosis is known to be unfavourable, delirium too often remains undiagnosed or untreated. Medications, neurological diseases, infections as well as metabolic and other medical conditions have to be ruled out in the differential diagnosis using the patient’s history, physical examination, laboratory results and imaging procedures. First-time psychiatric symptoms of an unknown medical disease as well as co-occurring psychiatric symptoms in chronic diseases provoke a challenging diagnostic decision, as reactive psychiatric symptoms have to be distinguished which is not always possible. In psychiatric disorders confirmed to be due to a medical condition, therapeutic implications are primarily geared to the causes of the disease. Only in a second step psychiatric medication is warranted with antipsychotic, antidepressant or sedation-inducing properties depending on the patient’s symptoms.","Thomas, C.; Driessen, M.; Arolt, V.",Nervenarzt,105,1

They pinpoint passion and compassion, promote servant leadership, acknowledge the unfamiliar, the ambiguous, and the paradoxical, communicate succinctly to reframe, and understand the «public» part of public health leadership. By working between and above the levels of leadership of self, others and organizations, these transcendent leaders can ultimately shift the paradigm from «no hope» to «new hope» and create a renewed sense of community. Such leadership will be vital as the 21st century progresses. Beginning the journey to new hope may start by motivating underdogs who nurture the spirit, discover a passion to serve, cultivate interdependence, and create uncommon bonds.

For this, we devise a multi-regions discrete-time model with the three classical SIR compartments, describing the spatial-temporal behaviors of homogenous susceptible, infected and removed populations. We suppose a large geographical domain, presented by a grid of colored cells, to exhibit at each instant i the spatial propagation of an epidemic which affects its different parts or sub-domains that we call here cells or regions. In order to minimize the number of infected individuals in some regions, we suggest an optimal control approach based on a travel-blocking vicinity strategy which aims to control a group of cells, or a patch, by restricting movements of infected people coming from its neighboring cells. We apply a discrete version of Pontryagin’s maximum principle to state the necessary conditions and characterization of the travel-blocking optimal controls. We provide cellular simulations based on discrete progressive-regressive iterative schemes associated with the obtained multi-points boundary value problems. For illustrating the modeling and optimal control approaches, we consider an example of 100 regions.","Zakary, Omar; Rachik, Mostafa; Elmouki, Ilias; Lazaiz, Samih",Adv Differ Equ,105,1

The decisive factor for treatment failure is inadequate previous antibiotic treatment. Broad spectrum and sufficiently high dosed initial treatment is crucial. To prevent further resistances, the antibiotic treatment must be evaluated early. Depending on the treatment success, treatment has to be changed or terminated. Deescalation is possible and sensible after three days. A treatment period of seven days should not routinely be exceeded. The treatment recommendations should be adapted to local resistances and the local statistics of frequent pathogens. A further factor for treatment decision-making is the risk analysis of the patient (previous treatment, stays in hospitals or nursing homes, concomitant diseases).","Welte, T.",Intensivmed Notfallmed,105,22

So, this study was conducted to explore the effects of L-theanine on the intestinal microbiome and immune response in a broiler. A total of 400-d-old chicks were randomly divided into four treatment groups (A, B, C, and D) using a complete randomized design. Treatments were as follows: A, control (basal diet); B, basal diet + 100 mg L-theanine/kg diet; C, basal diet + 200 mg L-theanine/kg diet; and D, basal diet + 300 mg L-theanine/kg diet. Mucosal samples from ileum and jejunum of broiler chicken were extracted at 21 and 42 d of age. Extraction of genomic DNA was followed by amplification of V3 and V4 hypervariable regions of 16S ribosomal RNA. After Illumina sequencing, results revealed that treatment with L-theanine significantly increased the population of Lactobacillus in ileum and jejunum as compared to a control group, but the higher population was observed in jejunum at both 21 and 42 d of age. The overall diversity of the jejunum microbiome in the treatment group was significantly lower than that of the ileum and control group (P < 0.05). Results of this study revealed that mRNA expression of TLRs (TLR-2 and TLR-4) and cytokines (TNF-α, IFN-γ, and IL-2) was decreased in response to treatment with L-theanine. Moreover, the negative correlation of abundance of Lactobacillus was observed with expression of IL-2 and IFN-γ in the intestine and these effects were highly significant (P < 0.01). In summary, our finding revealed that dietary supplementation of L-theanine exhibited a positive influence on intestinal bacteria by supporting beneficial microbes like Lactobacillus while decreasing harmful microbes like Clostridium.","Saeed, Muhammad; Yatao, Xu; Tiantian, Zhang; Qian, Ren; Chao, Sun",Poult Sci,105,1

The first set of samples was taken between 24 and 48 h after birth and quantified for IgG(1) concentration. A second set was taken immediately prior to vaccination for infectious bovine rhinotracheitis virus (IBRV; at an average age of 164 d) and a third set taken 60 d post-vaccination. These later samples were quantified for antibodies specific to IBRV. Level of complement C3 was also quantified in the samples taken immediately prior to vaccination. Three hundred sixty-seven calves were from four Hereford lines; three lines were previously selected for growth traits and the fourth was a randomly selected control line. There were no consistent differences in immune traits among these lines. The second group of 165 animals were Angus, Hereford and Red Poll calves. While Angus calves had a higher mean IgG(1) concentration at 24 to 48 h of age than Hereford or Red Poll calves, no differences among breeds were found for the other immune traits measured. Calves from older dams (>3 yr old) tended to have higher mean IgG(1) concentrations, pre-vaccination IBRV antibody titers and complement C3 levels than calves from 2- and 3-yr-old cows. However, these calves had lower 60-d post-vaccination IBRV titers than calves from the younger cows (P<.05). As pre-vaccination IBRV antibody titer increased, post-vaccination IBRV antibody titer decreased (P<.05). All pooled heritability estimates did not differ significantly from 0 (range −.06 ± .08 to .21 ± .12), nor were there significant pheno-typic associations between the immune traits and growth performance.","Muggli, N.

Here, symbolic transfer entropy (STE), a measure developed to identify asymmetric transfer of information between stochastic processes, is presented as a way to reveal asymmetric transmission patterns between age groups in an epidemic. STE provides a ranking of which age groups may dominate transmission, rather than a reconstruction of the explicit between-age-group transmission matrix. Using simulations, we establish that STE can identify which age groups dominate transmission even when there are differences in reporting rates between age groups and even if the data are noisy. Then, the pairwise STE is calculated between time series of influenza-like illness for 12 age groups in 884 US cities during the autumn of 2009. Elevated STE from 5 to 19 year-olds indicates that school-aged children were likely the most important transmitters of infection during the autumn wave of the 2009 pandemic in the USA. The results may be partially confounded by higher rates of physician-seeking behaviour in children compared to adults, but it is unlikely that differences in reporting rates can explain the observed differences in STE.","Kissler, Stephen M.; Viboud, Cécile; Grenfell, Bryan T.; Gog, Julia R.",J R Soc Interface,105,1

Intact and inactivated virions as well as the nucleocapsid fraction did not differ significantly in their IFN-inducing capacity. In contrast, genomic RNA as well as M protein fraction and envelopes induced IFN titres to a level of about 10% of those achieved with virions. NDV-induced IFN production could be blocked specifically by incubation with polychonal anti-NDV-monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and with two of three anti-HN-mAbs, but not with anti-NDV-mAbs directed against the F, M or NP protein. In addition, IFN induction by fixed MDBK cells, expressing NDV surface proteins after infection with NDV Ulster, was inhibited by one of two anti-F-mAbs. The results suggest that the induction of IFN synthesis in human PBML is a complex process involving not only the HN protein but also the uncleaved F protein precursor, a component of the M protein fraction and — once having entered the cell — the genomic RNA.","Wertz, Karin; Büttner, Mathias; Mayr, Anton; Kaaden, O.-R.",Vet Microbiol,105,1

The acute phase response is comprised of reactions localized at the site of infection, as well as the initiation of systemic responses, which include a rapid increase in the serum concentration of some proteins, known as acute phase proteins (APP). Using polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, we detected two APP of approximately 22 and 37 kDa molecular weight in sera obtained from cattle with bovine respiratory disease (BRD). Based on their presence in the sera of sick, but not normal animals, the molecular weights, N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis, and the ability to bind hemoglobin, we identified these proteins as the α and β subunits of haptoglobin. The haptoglobin molecule and the α subunit were isolated from serum, purified, and used to produce monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies. With these reagents, an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay was developed to measure the concentration of haptoglobin in bovine serum. Using an experimental model of BRD induced by a sequential challenge of calves with bovine herpesvirus type-1 and Pasteurella haemolytica, we observed a temporal relationship between the increase in haptoglobin concentration in serum and the onset of bacterial infection. The haptoglobin concentration ranged from undetectable in the serum of most calves prior to challenge, to greater than 1 mgml(−1) in over one-third of the calves at the height of disease. Furthermore, the concentration of haptoglobin was associated significantly with other measures of the severity of disease. Together, these results indicate that quantification of acute phase proteins in animals with BRD could be a valuable diagnostic and prognostic aid.","Godson, Dale L.; Campos, Manuel; Attah-Poku, Samuel K.; Redmond, Mark J.; Cordeiro, Daphne M.; Sethi, Manjeet S.; Harland, Richard J.; Babiuk, Lorne A.",Vet Immunol Immunopathol,105,1

An early induction of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I antigens as well as an infiltration of macrophage-like and cytotoxic T-cells was detected with immunohistochemical techniques in circumventricular organs, such as the median eminence, neurohypophosis, subformical organ, pineal gland and area postrema. These areas, which lack a blood-brain barrier, correspond to those showing early invasion of trypanosomes. In addition, there was a marked induction of MHC class I in neurons in two hypothalamic nuclei, The paraventricular and supraoptic nuclei. Neurons in these two nuclei are located behind the blood-brain, but project to the neurohypophysis and to the medain eminence, thereby exposing their axon terminals to factors circulating in the blod or released locally from invading trypanosomes or from macrophages or cytotoxic T-cells.

Fourteen out of 16 MBP-specific TCLs also responded, to a minor degree, to rubella antigen and/or actin.

Severe falciparum malaria requires rapid parasitological diagnosis by microscopy or rapid diagnostic test (RCT) and prompt initiation of parenteral artesunate. Fluid bolus therapy should be avoided in patients without hypotensive shock, and we suggest initial (24 h) crystalloid fluid therapy of 2–4 mL/kg/h, which may subsequently be reduced to 1 mL/kg/h in patients receiving additional fluids, e.g., through enteral tube feeding. In the minority of those patients presenting with hypotensive shock, we suggest fluid bolus therapy (30 mL/kg) with an isotonic crystalloid and early initiation of vasopressor support. Enteral feeding in non-intubated adult patients with cerebral malaria can start after 60 h, to avoid aspiration pneumonia. There are insufficient data to suggest this in pediatric cerebral malaria. The diagnosis of severe dengue is commonly with a combined dengue antigen (NS1) and antibody RDT. No antiviral treatment is currently available. Dengue shock results from capillary leakage, although hemorrhage or depression of myocardial contractility can contribute. The World Health Organization guidelines recommend restoration of the circulation guided by pulse pressure, capillary refill time, hematocrit, and urine output. Large (>15 mL/kg) rapid (<30 min) fluid boluses should be avoided, but prompt fluid administration with crystalloids is essential and should be restricted as soon as the critical phase is over to avoid pulmonary edema. Corticosteroids are not recommended, neither is platelet transfusion for thrombocytopenia in the absence of active bleeding or other risk factors.","Dondorp, Arjen M.; Hoang, Mai Nguyen Thi; Mer, Mervyn; Dünser, Martin W.; Mohanty, Sanjib; Nakibuuka, Jane; Schultz, Marcus J.; Thwaites, C.

A research priority of the World Health Organization is to develop oral rehydration solutions containing amino acids or other additives that will stimulate intestinal absorption more efficiently than the current glucose-based oral rehydration solutions. Glutamine is the principal metabolic fuel of the small bowel and a putative stimulator of mucosal repair. This report describes the transport response to mucosal l-glutamine following intestinal injury caused by porcine rotavirus. Peak symptoms and mucosal damage were observed 2–7 days after oral rotavirus inoculation. In vitro transport studies of the maximally injured region, the midjejunum (80% reduction in lactase), surprisingly, showed transport responses to l-glutamine (30 mmol/L) Sand l-alanine (30 mmol/L) that were similar qualitatively and quantitatively to those observed in control tissue. Subsequent application of mucosal d-glucose (30 mmol/L) caused additional stimulation of electrogenic Na(+) transport, but the response to glucose was blunted (P < 0.05) in the infected tissues. Glutamine and alanine enhanced Na(+) absorption to a similar degree (2–2.5 μEq · cm(−2) · h(−1)), but glutamine stimulated equal amounts of electrogenic and electroneutral NaC1 absorption, whereas alanine had no significant effect on net Cl(−) flux.

It has been suggested that the lamellae may be involved in the sorting of malarial proteins to the cytoplasm and the cell membrane of the host erythrocyte. We have previously shown that the lamellae accumulate sphingolipids by virtue of their lipid composition in a manner similar to the trans-Golgi and the trans-Golgi network in mammalian cells. In this paper, we show by immunofluorescence microscopy that a monoclonal antibody to the lamellae labelled a perinuclear organelle that colocalized with WGA and the mannose-6-phosphate receptor in cultured mammalian cells. Immunoelectron microscopy experiments revealed that LWLI labels cisternae of the trans-face and the trans-Golgi network. Western blot analysis of subcellular fractions using LWLI detected a 170 kD protein which is associated with the luminal side of Golgi membranes of rat liver and is conserved in all cell lines studied. Our results indicate that (i) the 170 kD protein is a novel marker of the mammalian trans-Golgi and the trans-Golgi network and (ii) in addition to similarities in their morphological and lipid characteristics, the lamellae induced by P. falciparum in erythrocytes share proteinaceous determinants with the Golgi apparatus of mammalian cells.","Li, Wenlu; Keller, Gilbert-André; Haldar, Kasturi",Tissue Cell,105,8

This chapter describes that the immune aggregate should be incubated for 1 hour at 37°C and then left in the cold overnight. This is the optimum approach for a system, where the concentration of neither the antigen nor the antiserum is known, and maximum clumping is needed. However, with many systems these parameters have been established, and if it is known that clumping can be obtained readily, for example, as with the avian infectious bronchitis system, then incubation for 1 hour at 37°C is sufficient, followed by spinning at 10,000 rpm for half an hour. Viruses in the small to intermediate size range are ideal for immune studies, as the particles are not disproportionately larger than the antibody molecules attached to them, and interaction between them can be visualized with better than 10 a resolution. Particles as large as the poxviruses are becoming too large for good resolution of antibody molecules to be obtained, and aggregates of poxvirus particles are usually too dense to be recorded photographically except at low power. In the field of clinical virology, there is a possibility that the electron microscope technique of negative staining will become a standard method of diagnosis. As far as research is concerned, the present article seems to have described the beginnings that have been made in the visualization of several aspects of antigen-antibody interaction. Each line investigated has yielded a few answers, but of much greater importance, has led to a better understanding of what questions should be asked. At present, viral antigens can only occasionally be obtained in pure form, such that there are only a very few systems where controlled and specific virus-antigen-antibody systems can be visualized.","Almeida, June D.; Waterson, A.P.",Adv Virus Res,105,1

The rigorous characterizations of receptor–ligand interactions have been derived from binding studies of radiolabeled ligands in neuropharmacology and endocrinology. The definition of viral recognition sites as receptors involves three major criteria that are derived from models of ligand–receptor interactions: saturability, specificity, and competition. A variety of approaches have been used to study the interaction of viral particles with cell surface receptors or reception sites. A rigorous study of viral–receptor interactions requires the use of more than one technique as different approaches provide complementary information about viral binding. The chapter discusses membrane components that interact with viruses. The identification of the subviral components that are responsible for the binding of viruses to cell surfaces has preceded the structural understanding of the cellular receptors themselves. The chapter summarizes current data concerning the viral attachment protein (VAP) of selected viruses.","Tardieu, Marc; Epstein, Rochelle L.; Weiner, Howard L.",Int Rev Cytol,105,1

A total of 50 cassava fields distributed among 18 municipalities were visited and intensity of anthracnose evaluated. The highest disease incidence (DI) (83.3%) was in samples collected in São Félix, and the lowest (34.4%), in Varzedo. Municipalities that presented the highest values for DI were located within the ‘Af’ Köppen–Geiger eco-zone, also presenting the highest values for the estimated McKinney disease index. Based on previous studies of multilocus phylogeny, seven different species of Colletotrichum were identified (Colletotrichum fructicola, Colletotrichum tropicale, Colletotrichum gloeosporioides s.s, Colletotrichum theobromicola, Colletotrichum siamense, Colletotrichum brevisporum and Colletotrichum plurivorum) and a new approach based on ERIC-PCR was used aiming to group the 82 isolates according to these findings. The highest percentage of genetic variance (> 78%) was among isolates within fields. Based on the survey and genetic analysis, C. fructicola is probably the main causal agent of cassava anthracnose in the Recôncavo Region, since this species was present with highest incidence in all eco-zones, 47.61, 42.86 and 57.14% for Af (tropical rainforest climate), As (tropical dry savanna climate) and Aw (tropical wet savanna climate), respectively. This study is the first report of C. fructicola lineages as the most likely pathogen causing anthracnose disease of cassava in Brazil, and these findings may be used to guide the selection of resistant varieties.","de Oliveira, Saulo Alves Santos; da Silva, Leandro Lopes; Nascimento, Daniela de Souza; Diamantino, Maria Selma Alves Silva; Ferreira, Claudia Fortes; de Oliveira, Thiago Alves Santos",J Plant Dis Prot (2006),105,1

Students are drawn to the calling of medicine because of altruistic values, dedication to service, and the desire to alleviate suffering and promote healing. Despite a dedication to these values, altruism in medicine is threatened by empathy erosion that develops in the clinical years of medical school and an increasing rate of medical student burnout. Currently, there are two widespread movements in medicine aimed at addressing the dual loss of altruism and physician and student burnout—professionalism and wellness. Despite widespread recognition of the problems and programs aimed at improving them, there has been little headway, and even calls to abandon altruism in the modern marketplace of medicine. What is needed is not an abandonment of a fundamental, defining value of the profession, but a re-evaluation of the meaning of altruism in medicine and a framework that allows for students and physicians to provide altruistic care for a sustainable, rewarding career in the healing profession. This paper proposes the Enlightened Self-Interest in Altruism (ESIA) model as an ethical framework to allow medical students to synergize the interests of the self with those they serve in a mutually beneficial relationship to improve patient care and the healthcare system at large. The ESIA model acknowledges that egoism and altruism are intertwined, dynamic motivators of behavior. In the enlightened self-interest approach, the interests of the group are also the interests of the self. The physician–patient relationship is a dyad in which egoism and altruism may converge in an enlightened way that acknowledges that the interests of one are the interests of the whole. This is a paradigm shift from the historical view of egoism and altruism as opposing motivations. This paper will present the threats to altruism, explore the interface of egoism and altruism in a clinical vignette, and then present the ESIA framework as an educational approach to aligning the interests of providers and patients to prevent burnout and promote altruism.","Vearrier, Laura",HEC Forum,105,8

Doxycycline is widely reported to possess immunomodulatory activity through inhibition of various inflammatory pathways. Considering the broad spectrum of anti-inflammatory activity, protective effect of doxycycline was evaluated in clinically relevant murine polymicrobial sepsis model induced by caecal ligation and puncture (CLP). In this model, sepsis is accompanied with infection and therefore ceftriaxone at sub-protective dose was combined to retard the bacterial growth. Three hours after CLP challenge, mice were administered vehicle, ceftriaxone (100 mg/kg subcutaneously) alone and in combination with immunomodulatory dose of doxycycline (50 mg/kg, intraperitoneal) and survival were monitored for 5 days. Bacterial count in blood and peritoneal fluid along with cytokines [interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1β, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α] and myeloperoxidase (MPO) in plasma and lung homogenate were measured at 18 h post-CLP. Plasma glutathione (GSH) was also determined. Doxycycline in presence of ceftriaxone improved survival of septic mice by significantly reducing the plasma and lung pro-inflammatory cytokines and MPO levels. It also increased plasma GSH levels. Doxycycline did not improve antibacterial effect of ceftriaxone in combination, suggesting that the protective effect of doxycycline was due to its immunomodulatory activity. Doxycycline in the presence of ceftriaxone demonstrated improved survival of septic mice by modulating the immune response.","Patel, Anasuya; Khande, Hemant; Periasamy, Hariharan; Mokale, Santosh",Inflammation,105,1

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this review is to assess the research on the use of blockchain technology for patient care and the associated challenges and to provide a research agenda for future research. METHODS: This review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines. We queried the Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), PubMed, Excerpta Medica dataBASE (EMBASE), and Web of Science databases for peer-reviewed research articles published up to December 2019 that examined the implementation of blockchain technology in health care settings. We identified 800 articles from which we selected 70 empirical research articles for a detailed review. RESULTS: Blockchain-based patient care applications include medical information systems, personal health records, mobile health and telemedicine, data preservation systems and social networks, health information exchanges and remote monitoring systems, and medical research systems. These blockchain-based health care applications may improve patient engagement and empowerment, improve health care provider access to information, and enhance the use of health care information for medical research. CONCLUSIONS: Blockchain health information technology (HIT) provides benefits such as ensuring data privacy and security of health data, facilitating interoperability of heterogeneous HIT systems, and improving the quality of health care outcomes. However, barriers to using blockchain technology to build HIT include security and privacy vulnerabilities, user resistance, high computing power requirements and implementation costs, inefficient consensus algorithms, and challenges of integrating blockchain with existing HIT. With 51% of the research focused on medical information systems such as electronic health record and electronic medical record, and 53% of the research focused on data security and privacy issues, this review shows that HIT research is primarily focused on the use of blockchain technologies to address the current challenges HIT faces.

However, the role of the adrenergic system in protection of the nervous system against sodium nitroprusside (SNP) injury remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the effect of ganoderic acid A (GA A) against SNP injury in neural cells and the role of adrenergic receptors in GA A neuroprotection. We found that SNP (0.125−2 mM) dose-dependently decreased the viability of both SH-SY5Y and PC12 cells and markedly increased NO contents. Pretreatment with GA A (10 μM) significantly attenuated SNP-induced cytotoxicity and NO increase in SH-SY5Y cells, but not in PC12 cells. Furthermore, pretreatment with GA A caused significantly higher adrenaline content in SH-SY5Y cells than in PC12 cells. In order to elucidate the mechanism of GA A-protecting SH-SY5Y cells, we added adrenaline, phentolamine, metoprolol, or ICI 118551 1 h before GA A was added to the culture medium. We found that addition of adrenaline (10 μM) significantly improved GA A protection in PC12 cells. The addition of β1-adrenergic receptor antagonist metoprolol (10 μM) or β2-adrenergic receptor antagonist ICI 118551 (0.1 μM) blocked the protective effect of GA A, whereas the addition of α-adrenergic receptor antagonist phentolamine (0.1 μM) did not affect GA A protection in SH-SY5Y cells. These results suggest that β-adrenergic receptors play an important role in the protection of GA A in SH-SY5Y cells against SNP injuries, and excessive adrenaline system activation caused great damage to the nervous system.","Yu, Zi-ru; Jia, Wei-hua; Liu, Chao; Wang, Hong-qing; Yang, Hai-guang; He, Guo-rong; Chen, Ruo-yun; Du, Guan-hua",Acta Pharmacol Sin,105,19

However, both its specific role and the precise molecular mechanism of de-ADP-ribosylation across specific viral families remains to be elucidated. Here we investigate by X-ray crystallography the mechanism of ADPr reactivity in the active site of Getah virus macro domain, which displays a peculiar substitution of one of the conserved residues in the catalytic loop. ADPr adopts distinct poses including a covalent bond between the C′′1 of the ADPr and a conserved Togaviridae-specific cysteine.

METHODS: This single-center retrospective cohort study included adult OHCA survivors who underwent hypothermic TTM from December 2011 to December 2019. High HbA1c at admission was defined as a level higher than 6%. Poor neurological outcomes were defined as cerebral performance category scores of 3–5. The primary outcome was 6-month mortality. The secondary outcome was the 6-month neurological outcome. Descriptive statistics, log-rank tests, and multivariable regression modeling were used for data analysis. RESULTS: Of the 302 patients included in the final analysis, 102 patients (33.8%) had HbA1c levels higher than 6%.

The etiology of PD is still not clear but systemic inflammation is proved to trigger and exacerbate DA neurons degeneration. Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) is a pattern-recognition receptor (PRR) and plays a major role in promoting the host immune. TLR4-mediated signal pathways induce the release of many inflammatory cytokines. It is reasonable to hypothesize that TLR4 is the mediator in microglia contributing to the damage of DA neurons in the SNpc. In this study, we evaluated the role of TLR4 in the chronic 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)/probenecid mouse model. Both TLR4-deficient and wild-type (WT) mice were injected with probenecid (250 mg/kg, i.p.) followed by injection of MPTP (25 mg/kg, s.c.) every 4 days for 10 times. From D43 to D47, the behavioral performance in pole test and wire hang test was assessed. Then the mice were euthanized, and SN and striatum were dissected out for biochemical tests. We showed that compared with MPTP-treated WT mice, TLR4 deficiency significantly attenuated MPTP-induced motor deficits and TH-protein expression reduction in SNpc and striatum, suppressed MPTP-induced α-synuclein abnormality and neuroinflammation mediated through oxidative stress, glial activation, NF-κB and the NLRP3 inflammasome signaling pathways. These findings highlight the neuroprotective effect of TLR4-pathways in the chronic MPTP-induced PD mouse model.","Shao, Qian-hang; Chen, Ying; Li, Fang-fang; Wang, Shuo; Zhang, Xiao-ling; Yuan, Yu-he; Chen, Nai-hong",Acta Pharmacol Sin,105,1

However, HIV-1 evades vaccine-induced memory CD8(+)T cell response by mechanisms that are not fully understood. METHODS: We analyzed the temporal dynamics of CD8(+)T cell recall activity and function during EcoHIV infection in a potent PD1-based vaccine immunized immunocompetent mice. FINDINGS: Upon intraperitoneal EcoHIV infection, high levels of HIV-1 GAG-specific CD8(+)T lymphocytes recall response reduced EcoHIV-infected cells significantly. However, this protective effect diminished quickly after seven days, followed by a rapid reduction of GAG-specific CD8(+)T cell number and activity, and viral persistence. Mechanistically, EcoHIV activated dendritic cells (DCs) and myeloid cells. Myeloid cells were infected and rapidly expanded, exhibiting elevated PD-L1/-L2 expression and T cell suppressive function before day 7, and were resistant to CD8(+)T cell-mediated apoptosis. Depletion of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) reduced EcoHIV infection and boosted T cell responses. INTERPRETATION: This study provides an overview of the temporal interplay of persistent virus, DCs, MDSCs and antigen-specific CD8(+)T cells during acute infection. We identify MDSCs as critical gatekeepers that restrain antiviral T cell memory responses, and highlight MDSCs as an important target for developing effective vaccines against chronic human infections.

METHODS: On the basis of the already existing NGS analysis workflows for the identification of malignant gene variants at the Institute of Pathology of the University Hospital Erlangen, we defined basic requirements on an NGS processing and analysis pipeline and implemented a pipeline based on the GEMINI (GEnome MINIng) open source genetic variation database. For the purpose of validation, this pipeline was applied to data from the 1000 Genomes Project and subsequently to NGS data derived from 206 patients of a local hospital. We further integrated the pipeline into existing structures of data integration centers at the University Hospital Erlangen and combined NGS data with local nongenomic patient-derived data available in Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources format. RESULTS: Using data from the 1000 Genomes Project and from the patient cohort as input, the implemented system produced the same results as already established methodologies. Further, it satisfied all our identified requirements and was successfully integrated into the existing infrastructure. Finally, we showed in an exemplary analysis how the data could be quickly loaded into and analyzed in KETOS, a web-based analysis platform for statistical analysis and clinical decision support. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that the GEMINI open source database can be augmented to create an NGS analysis pipeline. The pipeline generates high-quality results consistent with the already established workflows for gene variant annotation and pathological evaluation. We further demonstrate how NGS-derived genomic and other clinical data can be combined for further statistical analysis, thereby providing for data integration using standardized vocabularies and methods. Finally, we demonstrate the feasibility of the pipeline integration into hospital workflows by providing an exemplary integration into the data integration center infrastructure, which is currently being established across Germany.","Gruendner, Julian; Wolf, Nicolas; Tögel, Lars; Haller, Florian; Prokosch, Hans-Ulrich; Christoph, Jan",J Med Internet Res,105,1

Plasma leakage, hemorrhage, and shock in severe cases were caused by immunological derangement from secondary heterotypic infection. Flavanone, commonly found in medicinal plants, previously showed potential as anti-dengue inhibitors for its direct antiviral effects and suppressing the pro-inflammatory cytokine from dengue immunopathogenesis. Here, we chemically modified flavanones, pinocembrin and pinostrobin, by halogenation and characterized them as potential dengue 2 inhibitors and performed toxicity tests in human-derived cells and in vivo animal model. Dibromopinocembrin and dibromopinostrobin inhibited dengue serotype 2 at the EC(50)s of 2.0640 ± 0.7537 and 5.8567 ± 0.5074 µM with at the CC(50)s of 67.2082 ± 0.9731 and >100 µM, respectively. Both of the compounds also showed minimal toxicity against adult C57BL/6 mice assessed by ALT and Cr levels in day one, three, and eight post-intravenous administration. Computational studies suggested the potential target be likely the NS5 methyltransferase at SAM-binding pocket. Taken together, these two brominated flavanones are potential leads for further drug discovery investigation.","Boonyasuppayakorn, Siwaporn; Saelee, Thanaphon; Visitchanakun, Peerapat; Leelahavanichkul, Asada; Hengphasatporn, Kowit; Shigeta, Yasuteru; Huynh, Thao Nguyen Thanh; Chu, Justin Jang Hann; Rungrotmongkol, Thanyada; Chavasiri, Warinthorn",Molecules,105,1

This research proposed the deep learning-based comparative evaluation for the classification of plant disease in two steps. Firstly, the best convolutional neural network (CNN) was obtained by conducting a comparative analysis among well-known CNN architectures along with modified and cascaded/hybrid versions of some of the DL models proposed in the recent researches. Secondly, the performance of the best-obtained model was attempted to improve by training through various deep learning optimizers. The comparison between various CNNs was based on performance metrics such as validation accuracy/loss, F1-score, and the required number of epochs. All the selected DL architectures were trained in the PlantVillage dataset which contains 26 different diseases belonging to 14 respective plant species. Keras with TensorFlow backend was used to train deep learning architectures. It is concluded that the Xception architecture trained with the Adam optimizer attained the highest validation accuracy and F1-score of 99.81% and 0.9978 respectively which is comparatively better than the previous approaches and it proves the novelty of the work. Therefore, the method proposed in this research can be applied to other agricultural applications for transparent detection and classification purposes.","Saleem, Muhammad Hammad; Potgieter, Johan; Arif, Khalid Mahmood",Plants (Basel),105,1

Marine mycoplankton are likely functionally analogous to their terrestrial counterparts, including performing saprotrophy and degrading high-molecular weight organic substrates using carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes). We investigated the prevalence of transcribed oceanic fungal CAZyme genes using the Marine Atlas of Tara Ocean Unigenes database. We revealed an abundance of unique transcribed fungal glycoside hydrolases in the open ocean, including a particularly high number that act upon cellulose in surface waters and the deep chlorophyll maximum (DCM). A variety of other glycoside hydrolases acting on a range of biogeochemically important polysaccharides including β-glucans and chitin were also found.

METHODS: Patients were identified retrospectively. Baseline and follow-up data were recorded. The diagnosis of DSM, and presence or absence of SRF and intra-retinal fluid (IRF) was confirmed using Spectral Domain-Optical Coherence Tomography (SD-OCT). Decisions to treat oedema were based on clinician preference. RESULTS: 193 eyes of 106 patients (71 female) were confirmed to have DSM. Overall mean duration of follow-up for this cohort was 3.5 years. Mean BRVA for all eyes at baseline was 0.38 (range: −0.20 to ‘light perception’). A significant difference was noted in mean baseline BRVA between those eyes with SRF compared with those without SRF at baseline (0.48 vs. 0.31, p < 0.001). Intra-retinal fluid moderately correlated with poorer baseline BRVA (r = 0.31, p < 0.003). No significant change in BRVA was noted during follow-up. No significant effect of treatment on BRVA was observed. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of SRF at baseline was associated with poorer vision. Vision appears to remain stable irrespective of the presence or absence of SRF at baseline. The treatments administered in this cohort did not affect final vision or SRF.","Burke, Tomas R.; Wu, Angela Ding; Shen, Yuening; Rajendram, Ranjan",Eye (Lond),105,8

Protecting from the related risks requires updates to laws and procedures by justice systems. These updates depend to a large extent on what the key stakeholders—the judiciary—know and think about the use of genetic information. This study used a battery of 25 genetic knowledge items to collect data from 73 supreme court judges from the same country (Romania) on their knowledge of genetic information. Their responses were compared with those of two other groups: lawyers (but not judges; N = 94) and non-lawyers (N = 116) from the same country. The data were collected at approximately the same time from the three groups. The judges’ results were also compared to the results obtained from a general population data collection (N = 5310). The results showed that: (1) judges had overall better knowledge of genetics than the other groups, but their knowledge was uneven across different genetic concepts; (2) judges were overall more confident in their knowledge than the other two groups, but their confidence was quite low; and (3) the correlation between knowledge and confidence was moderate for judges, weak for lawyers and not significant for non-lawyers. Finally, 100% of the judges agreed that information on gene-environment processes should be included in judges’ training. Increasing genetic expertise of the justice stakeholders is an important step towards achieving adequate legal protection against genetic data misuse.","Selita, Fatos; Smereczynska, Vanessa; Chapman, Robert; Toivainen, Teemu; Kovas, Yulia",Eur J Hum Genet,105,8

Sample pooling methods improve the efficiency of large-scale pathogen screening campaigns by reducing the number of tests and reagents required to accurately categorize positive and negative individuals. Such methods rely on group testing theory which mainly focuses on minimizing the total number of tests; however, many other practical concerns and tradeoffs must be considered when choosing an appropriate method for a given set of circumstances. Here we use computational simulations to determine how several theoretical approaches compare in terms of (a) the number of tests, to minimize costs and save reagents, (b) the number of sequential steps, to reduce the time it takes to complete the assay, (c) the number of samples per pool, to avoid the limits of detection, (d) simplicity, to reduce the risk of human error, and (e) robustness, to poor estimates of the number of positive samples. We found that established methods often perform very well in one area but very poorly in others. Therefore, we introduce and validate a new method which performs fairly well across each of the above criteria making it a good general use approach.","Furstenau, Tara N.; Cocking, Jill H.; Hepp, Crystal M.; Fofanov, Viacheslav Y.",PLoS One,105,8

How they proceed to regulate the locomotor rhythm remained unknown. Here, in neonatal rodents, we identified a persistent potassium current critical in regulating pacemakers and locomotion speed. This current recapitulates features of the M-current (I(M)): a subthreshold noninactivating outward current blocked by 10,10-bis(4-pyridinylmethyl)-9(10H)-anthracenone dihydrochloride (XE991) and enhanced by N-(2-chloro-5-pyrimidinyl)-3,4-difluorobenzamide (ICA73). Immunostaining and mutant mice highlight an important role of Kv7.2-containing channels in mediating I(M). Pharmacological modulation of I(M) regulates the emergence and the frequency regime of both pacemaker and CPG activities and controls the speed of locomotion. Computational models captured these results and showed how an interplay between I(M) and I(NaP) endows the locomotor CPG with rhythmogenic properties. Overall, this study provides fundamental insights into how I(M) and I(NaP) work in tandem to set the speed of locomotion.","Verneuil, Jérémy; Brocard, Cécile; Trouplin, Virginie; Villard, Laurent; Peyronnet-Roux, Julie; Brocard, Frédéric",PLoS Biol,105,28

We experimentally compared three clinically approved intravenous β-blockers. METHODS AND RESULTS: Mice undergoing 45 min/24 h ischaemia–reperfusion (I/R) received vehicle, metoprolol, atenolol, or propranolol at min 35. The effect on neutrophil infiltration was tested in three models of exacerbated inflammation. Neutrophil migration was evaluated in vitro and in vivo by intravital microscopy. The effect of β-blockers on the conformation of the β1 adrenergic receptor was studied in silico. Of the tested β-blockers, only metoprolol ameliorated I/R injury [infarct size (IS) = 18.0% ± 0.03% for metoprolol vs. 35.9% ± 0.03% for vehicle; P < 0.01]. Atenolol and propranolol had no effect on IS. In the three exacerbated inflammation models, neutrophil infiltration was significantly attenuated only in the presence of metoprolol (60%, 50%, and 70% reductions vs. vehicle in myocardial I/R injury, thioglycolate-induced peritonitis, and lipopolysaccharide-induced acute lung injury, respectively). Migration studies confirmed the particular ability of metoprolol to disrupt neutrophil dynamics. In silico analysis indicated different intracellular β1 adrenergic receptor conformational changes when bound to metoprolol than to the other two β-blockers. CONCLUSIONS: Metoprolol exerts a disruptive action on neutrophil dynamics during exacerbated inflammation, resulting in an infarct-limiting effect not observed with atenolol or propranolol. The differential effect of β-blockers may be related to distinct conformational changes in the β1 adrenergic receptor upon metoprolol binding. If these data are confirmed in a clinical trial, metoprolol should become the intravenous β-blocker of choice for patients with ongoing infarction.","Clemente-Moragón, Agustín; Gómez, Mónica; Villena-Gutiérrez, Rocío; Lalama, Doménica V; García-Prieto, Jaime; Martínez, Fernando; Sánchez-Cabo, Fátima; Fuster, Valentín; Oliver, Eduardo; Ibáñez, Borja",Eur Heart J,105,1

The leading cause of death worldwide by cancer is that of the lung, which, in large part, is a result of the disease often not being detected until a late stage. Although COPD and asthma are conditions with considerably lower mortality, they are extremely distressful to people and involve high healthcare overheads. Moreover, for these diseases, diagnostic methods are not only costly but are also invasive, thereby adding to people’s stress. It has been appreciated for many decades that the analysis of trace volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in exhaled breath could potentially provide cheaper, rapid, and non-invasive screening procedures to diagnose and monitor the above diseases of the lung. However, after decades of research associated with breath biomarker discovery, no breath VOC tests are clinically available. Reasons for this include the little consensus as to which breath volatiles (or pattern of volatiles) can be used to discriminate people with lung diseases, and our limited understanding of the biological origin of the identified VOCs. Lung disease diagnosis using breath VOCs is challenging. Nevertheless, the numerous studies of breath volatiles and lung disease provide guidance as to what volatiles need further investigation for use in differential diagnosis, highlight the urgent need for non-invasive clinical breath tests, illustrate the way forward for future studies, and provide significant guidance to achieve the goal of developing non-invasive diagnostic tests for lung disease. This review provides an overview of these issues from evaluating key studies that have been undertaken in the years 2010–2019, in order to present objective and comprehensive updated information that presents the progress that has been made in this field. The potential of this approach is highlighted, while strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats are discussed.

During diagnosis, it is important to distinguish primary CCS of bone from bone metastasis of melanoma because this difference fundamentally changes the therapeutic options. Recently, characteristic fusion genes of CCS have been detected using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or direct sequencing which allowed to distinguish CCS from melanoma. However, there was no study applying these analyses with positive results. In this case, we describe the use of fusion gene analysis to diagnose a primary CCS of the bone. CASE PRESENTATION: A 36-year-old male presented with a four-months history of left knee pain. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a lesion in the left femoral medial epicondyle. Histological examination of the biopsy specimen revealed proliferating oval or rounded cells. These cells had clear cytoplasm arranged in fascicles or compact nests with frequent deposits of brown pigment. Furthermore, immunohistochemistry analysis revealed that tumor cells were positive for S-100 protein, HMB-45, Melan-A, and SOX10. It stained negative for CD34 and BRAF v600e. Conclusively, detection of the EWSR1/ATF1 fusion gene using RT-PCR and direct sequencing confirmed that the lesion was a primary CCS of the bone. Wide-margin resection and reconstruction with a tumor endoprosthesis were performed. CONCLUSIONS: Herein, we diagnosed a rare case of primary CCS of the bone by detecting EWSR1/ATF1 fusion gene using RT-PCR and direct sequencing. Since fluorescence-in situ hybridization (FISH) and RT-PCR could show false positive by mainly due to technical problems, it is better to perform direct sequencing to confidently diagnose the tumor as a primary CCS especially at very rare site such as bone.","Kubota, Yuta; Tanaka, Kazuhiro; Hisaoka, Masanori; Daa, Tsutomu; Iwasaki, Tatsuya; Kawano, Masanori; Itonaga, Ichiro; Tsumura, Hiroshi",BMC Musculoskelet Disord,105,8

Using inverse distance weighted (IDW) interpolation, point data were spatially distributed by their geographic significance. The results revealed that the composite system identified more stable and vulnerable areas than the additive system; the two systems identified 48,600 km(2) and 36,450 km(2) of stable areas, respectively, for a difference of 12,150 km(2), and 3,729 km(2) and 3,007 km(2) of vulnerable areas, for a difference of 722 km(2).

Vaccination has been proposed as a preventive approach against STEC infection; however, there is no vaccine for humans and those used in animals reduce but do not eliminate the intestinal colonization of STEC. The OmpT, Cah and Hes proteins are widely distributed among clinical STEC strains and are recognized by serum IgG and IgA in patients with HUS.

By 2018, the same could be seen with the maternal mortality rate in the United States at 17.4 maternal deaths per 100 000 live births. When factoring in race/ethnicity, this number was more than double among non-Hispanic Black women who experienced 37.1 maternal deaths per 100 000 live births. More than half of these deaths and near deaths were from preventable causes, with cardiovascular disease being the leading one. In an effort to amplify the magnitude of this epidemic in the United States that disproportionately plagues Black women, on June 13, 2020, the Association of Black Cardiologists hosted the Black Maternal Heart Health Roundtable—a collaborative task force to tackle the maternal health crisis in the Black community. The roundtable brought together diverse stakeholders and champions of maternal health equity to discuss how innovative ideas, solutions and opportunities could be implemented, while exploring additional ways attendees could address maternal health concerns within the health care system. The discussions were intended to lead the charge in reducing maternal morbidity and mortality through advocacy, education, research, and collaborative efforts. The goal of this roundtable was to identify current barriers at the community, patient, and clinician level and expand on the efforts required to coordinate an effective approach to reducing these statistics in the highest risk populations.

Positive test results were as follows: Ehrlichia spp. IFAT 73 out of 624 (12%), Leishmania spp. IFAT 22 out of 624 (4%), Hepatozoon spp. PCR 53 out of 618 (9%), Dirofilaria spp. PCR 1 out of 618 cats (0.2%), and Rickettsia spp. IFAT 52 out of 467 cats (11%) tested from July 2015 onwards. Three cats had positive test results for more than one pathogen before 2015. After testing for Rickettsia spp. was included in 2015, 19 cats had positive test results for more than one pathogen (Rickettsia spp. were involved in 14 out of these 19 cats). CONCLUSIONS: At least one pathogen could be detected in 175 out of 624 cats (28%) via indirect and/or direct detection methods. Four percent had positive test results for more than one pathogen. These data emphasize the importance of considering the above-mentioned vector-borne infections as potential differential diagnoses in clinically symptomatic cats.

Here, we examined the binding potential of these natural compounds to inhibit the constitutive phosphorylation of epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFRs). Exon 20 insertion mutants of EGFR, which show resistance to various FDA approved drugs and are linked to poor prognosis of lung cancer patients, were the primary focus of this study. Apart from exon 20 insertion mutants, the potential of natural compounds to serve as ATP competitive inhibitors of wildtype protein and other common mutants of EGFR, namely L858R and exon19del, were also examined. The potential of natural compounds was compared to the positive controls such as erlotinib, TAS6417 and poziotinib. Similar to known inhibitors, Wi-A and Wi-N could displace and binds at the ATP orthosteric site of exon19del, L858R and exon20, while CAPE was limited to wildtype EGFR and exon 20 insertion mutants only. Moreover, the binding free energy of the natural drugs against EGFRs was also comparable to the positive controls. This computational study suggests that Wi-A and Wi-N have potential against multiple mutated EGFRs, warranting further in vitro and in vivo experiments.","Malik, Vidhi; Kumar, Vipul; Kaul, Sunil C.; Wadhwa, Renu; Sundar, Durai",Biomolecules,105,22

However, few studies have assessed the use and appropriateness of these measurements for older populations. OBJECTIVE: This systematic review aims to identify and critically appraise studies assessing digital literacy among older adults and to evaluate how digital literacy instruments used in existing studies address the elements of age-appropriate digital literacy using the European Commission’s Digital Competence (DigComp) Framework. METHODS: Electronic databases were searched for studies using validated instruments to assess digital literacy among older adults. The quality of all included studies was evaluated using the Crowe Critical Appraisal Tool (CCAT). Instruments were assessed according to their ability to incorporate the competence areas of digital literacy as defined by the DigComp Framework: (1) information and data literacy, (2) communication and collaboration, (3) digital content creation, (4) safety, and (5) problem-solving ability, or attitudes toward information and communication technology use. RESULTS: Searches yielded 1561 studies, of which 27 studies (17 cross-sectional, 2 before and after, 2 randomized controlled trials, 1 longitudinal, and 1 mixed methods) were included in the final analysis. Studies were conducted in the United States (18/27), Germany (3/27), China (1/27), Italy (1/27), Sweden (1/27), Canada (1/27), Iran (1/27), and Bangladesh (1/27). Studies mostly defined older adults as aged ≥50 years (10/27) or ≥60 years (8/27). Overall, the eHealth Literacy Scale (eHEALS) was the most frequently used instrument measuring digital literacy among older adults (16/27, 59%). Scores on the CCAT ranged from 34 (34/40, 85%) to 40 (40/40, 100%). Most instruments measured 1 or 2 of the DigComp Framework’s elements, but the Mobile Device Proficiency Questionnaire (MDPQ) measured all 5 elements, including “digital content creation” and “safety.” CONCLUSIONS: The current digital literacy assessment instruments targeting older adults have both strengths and weaknesses, relative to their study design, administration method, and ease of use. Certain instrument modalities like the MDPQ are more generalizable and inclusive and thus, favorable for measuring the digital literacy of older adults. More studies focusing on the suitability of such instruments for older populations are warranted, especially for areas like “digital content creation” and “safety” that currently lack assessment. Evidence-based discussions regarding the implications of digitalization for the treatment of older adults and how health care professionals may benefit from this phenomenon are encouraged.","Oh, Sarah Soyeon; Kim, Kyoung-A; Kim, Minsu; Oh, Jaeuk; Chu, Sang Hui; Choi, JiYeon",J Med Internet Res,105,1

The aim of this consultant-delivered service is to manage referrals more efficiently by providing active triage of all referrals, daily rapid access clinics and easily accessible advice for primary healthcare professionals. This study presents an evaluation of this service. DESIGN: Mixed-methods service evaluation with analysis of data for every contact with the PDM service over a 2-year period. For each patient, the method of contact, reason for contact, presenting complaint and triage outcome were recorded. Feedback from general practitioners (GPs) and patients was gathered. RESULTS: Data were analysed for 7162 patients. More than a quarter (2034; 28%) of all referrals were managed with advice only. Of the 4703 outpatient clinic referrals, 1285 (27%) were managed without a clinic appointment. More than half (54%) of the requests for paediatric assessment unit (PAU) admission were managed alternatively, typically with advice only or a rapid access clinic appointment. This has reversed the increasing trend of PAU admissions from primary care of preceding years. Financial analysis suggested the avoidance of these clinic appointments, and PAU admissions provided a substantial cost saving. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that the PDM service has succeeded in reducing unnecessary hospital attendances by managing patients more effectively and strengthening partnerships with primary care. The service has received overwhelmingly positive feedback from GPs. This service could be replicated in other Trusts and developed in the future to facilitate further management of paediatric cases in a primary care setting.","Hodgson, Heather Sharon; Webb, Nicholas; Diskin, Lynn",BMJ Paediatr Open,105,1

Tick salivary proteins secreted to the host at the feeding interface play critical roles for tick feeding and may contribute to host infection by tick-borne pathogens; accordingly, these proteins represent interesting antigen targets for the development of vaccines aimed at the control and prevention of tick infestations and tick-borne diseases. METHODS: To identify these proteins, the transcriptome of the salivary glands of O. erraticus was de novo assembled and the salivary gene expression dynamics assessed throughout the trophogonic cycle using Illumina sequencing. The genes differentially upregulated after feeding were selected and discussed as potential antigen candidates for tick vaccines. RESULTS: Transcriptome assembly resulted in 22,007 transcripts and 18,961 annotated transcripts, which represent 86.15% of annotation success. Most salivary gene expression took place during the first 7 days after feeding (2088 upregulated transcripts), while only a few genes (122 upregulated transcripts) were differentially expressed from day 7 post-feeding onwards. The protein families more abundantly overrepresented after feeding were lipocalins, acid and basic tail proteins, proteases (particularly metalloproteases), protease inhibitors, secreted phospholipases A2, 5′-nucleotidases/apyrases and heme-binding vitellogenin-like proteins. All of them are functionally related to blood ingestion and regulation of host defensive responses, so they can be interesting candidate protective antigens for vaccines. CONCLUSIONS: The O. erraticus sialotranscriptome contains thousands of protein coding sequences—many of them belonging to large conserved multigene protein families—and shows a complexity and functional redundancy similar to those observed in the sialomes of other argasid and ixodid tick species. This high functional redundancy emphasises the need for developing multiantigenic tick vaccines to reach full protection. This research provides a set of promising candidate antigens for the development of vaccines for the control of O. erraticus infestations and prevention of tick-borne diseases of public and veterinary health relevance, such as TBRF and ASF. Additionally, this transcriptome constitutes a valuable reference database for proteomics studies of the saliva and salivary glands of O. erraticus.

OBJECTIVE: Aim of the present study was to evaluate potential risk factors for mortality of infants with congenital diaphragmatic hernia. METHODS: A single-center chart review of all patients treated with congenital diaphragmatic hernia over a period of 16 years, at the Medical University of Vienna, was performed. A comparison of medical parameters between survivors and non-survivors, as well as to published literature was conducted. RESULTS: During the observational period 66 patients were diagnosed with congenital diaphragmatic hernia. Overall survival was 84.6%. Left-sided hernia occurred in 51 patients (78.5%) with a mortality of 7.8%. In comparison, right-sided hernia occurred less frequently (n = 12) but showed a higher mortality (33.3%, p = 0.000). Critically instable patients were provided with venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO, 32.3%, n = 21). Survival rate among these patients was 66.7%. Right-sided hernia, treatment with inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) over 15 days and the use of ECMO over 10 days were significant risk factors for mortality. CONCLUSION: The survival rate in this cohort is comparable to the current literature. Parameters such as the side of the diaphragmatic defect, duration of ECMO and inhaled nitric oxide were assessed as mortality risk factors. This analysis of patients with congenital diaphragmatic hernia enhances understanding of risk factors for mortality, helping to improve management and enabling further evaluation in prospective clinical trials.","Brandt, Jennifer Bettina; Werther, Tobias; Groth, Erika; Küng, Erik; Golej, Johann; Berger, Angelika",Wien Klin Wochenschr,105,28

In this study, we investigated hyperglycaemia‐induced inflammation mediating high‐mobility group box 1 activation, which is involved in a novel form of cell death, pyroptosis, diabetic sarcopenia, atrophy, and adverse muscle remodelling. Furthermore, we investigated the therapeutic potential of bone morphogenetic protein‐7 (BMP‐7), an osteoporosis drug, to treat pyroptosis, and diabetic muscle myopathy. METHODS: C57BL6 mice were treated with saline (control), streptozotocin (STZ), or STZ + BMP‐7 to generate diabetic muscle myopathy. Diabetes was established by determining the increased levels of glucose. Then, muscle function was examined, and animals were sacrificed. Gastrocnemius muscle or blood samples were analysed for inflammation, pyroptosis, weight loss, muscle atrophy, and adverse structural remodelling of gastrocnemius muscle using histology, enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay, immunohistochemistry, western blotting, and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: A significant (P < 0.05) increase in hyperglycaemia leads to an increase in inflammasome (high‐mobility group box 1, toll‐like receptor‐4, and nucleotide‐binding oligomerization domain, leucine‐rich repeat and pyrin domain containing protein 3) formation in diabetic muscle cells. Further analysis showed an up‐regulation of the downstream pyroptotic pathway with significant (P < 0.05) number of positive muscle cells expressing pyroptosis‐specific markers [caspase‐1, interleukin (IL)‐1β, IL‐18, and gasdermin‐D]. Pyroptotic cell death is involved in further increasing inflammation by releasing pro‐inflammatory cytokine IL‐6. Structural analysis showed the loss of muscle weight, decreased myofibrillar area, and increased fibrosis leading to muscle dysfunction. Consistent with this finding, BMP‐7 attenuated hyperglycaemia (~50%), pyroptosis, inflammation, and diabetic adverse structural modifications as well as improved muscle function. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, we report for the first time that increased hyperglycaemia and inflammation involve cellular pyroptosis that induces significant muscle cell loss and adverse remodelling in diabetic myopathy. We also report that targeting pyroptosis with BMP‐7 improves diabetic muscle pathophysiology and muscle function. These findings suggest that BMP‐7 could be a potential therapeutic option to treat diabetic myopathy.","Aluganti Narasimhulu, Chandrakala; Singla, Dinender K.",J Cachexia Sarcopenia Muscle,105,11

We hypothesized that the CNS parenchyma may acquire protection from the reactive astrocytic Glia Limitans not only during neuroinflammation but also when BBB integrity is compromised in the resting state. Previous studies found that astrocyte-derived Sonic hedgehog (SHH) stabilizes the BBB during CNS inflammatory disease, while endothelial-derived desert hedgehog (DHH) is expressed at the BBB under resting conditions. Here, we investigated the effects of endothelial Dhh on the integrity of the BBB and Glia Limitans. We first characterized DHH expression within endothelial cells at the BBB, then demonstrated that DHH is down-regulated during experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Using a mouse model in which endothelial Dhh is inducibly deleted, we found that endothelial Dhh both opens the BBB via the modulation of forkhead box O1 (FoxO1) transcriptional activity and induces a tight junctional barrier at the Glia Limitans. We confirmed the relevance of this glial barrier system in human multiple sclerosis active lesions. These results provide evidence for the novel concept of “chronic neuroinflammatory tolerance” in which BBB opening in the resting state is sufficient to stimulate a protective barrier at the Glia Limitans that limits the severity of subsequent neuroinflammatory disease. In summary, genetic disruption of the BBB generates endothelial signals that drive the formation under resting conditions of a secondary barrier at the Glia Limitans with protective effects against subsequent CNS inflammation. The concept of a reciprocally regulated CNS double barrier system has implications for treatment strategies in both the acute and chronic phases of multiple sclerosis pathophysiology.","Mora, Pierre; Hollier, Pierre-Louis; Guimbal, Sarah; Abelanet, Alice; Diop, Aïssata; Cornuault, Lauriane; Couffinhal, Thierry; Horng, Sam; Gadeau, Alain-Pierre; Renault, Marie-Ange; Chapouly, Candice",PLoS Biol,105,17

Humans, animals, and the environment are the reservoirs that contribute and allow AMR to propagate in interconnected ecosystems. The emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and antibiotic-resistant genes in the water environment has become an important environmental health issue. One of the major influencers from environment sector is the pharmaceutical industry which is growing globally to meet the ever-increasing demand of antibiotics, especially in low- and middle-income countries. The pharmaceutical effluent has a mix of large concentrations of antibiotics and antibiotic resistance genes, and these sites act as hotspots for environmental contamination and the spread of AMR. Inadequate treatment of the effluent and its irresponsible disposal leads to unprecedented antibiotic contamination in the environment and their persistent presence in the environment significantly modulates the bacterial genomes’ expression that is responsible for increase and spread of AMR. However, not much interventions are suggested in the National Action Plan developed on AMR by many countries. There are no regulations across the globe till date for the level of antibiotic residues in pharmaceutical effluent for the growing pharmaceutical industry.

Increasing energy and nutritional efficiency while simultaneously reducing negative environmental impacts of pork production requires the adoption of precision nutrition practices in global pork production systems. Precision swine nutrition can only be achieved by using more accurate and comprehensive methods and measures to determine the true nutri-physiological value of feed ingredients used in swine diets. There are several characteristics in some types of feed ingredients that are detrimental to swine health and performance, but they are seldom measured and deserve greater consideration. Likewise, there are also several value-added benefits provided by some functional feed ingredients that are not given enough consideration when formulating swine diets. The purpose of this review is to provide a holistic assessment of the benefits and limitations of existing chemical analysis methods and measures used to evaluate feed ingredients for swine and explore the benefits of using additional measurements to more accurately assess their true nutri-physiological value. ABSTRACT: Many types of feed ingredients are used to provide energy and nutrients to meet the nutritional requirements of swine. However, the analytical methods and measures used to determine the true nutritional and physiological (“nutri-physiological”) value of feed ingredients affect the accuracy of predicting and achieving desired animal responses. Some chemical characteristics of feed ingredients are detrimental to pig health and performance, while functional components in other ingredients provide beneficial health effects beyond their nutritional value when included in complete swine diets. Traditional analytical procedures and measures are useful for determining energy and nutrient digestibility of feed ingredients, but do not adequately assess their true physiological or biological value. Prediction equations, along with ex vivo and in vitro methods, provide some benefits for assessing the nutri-physiological value of feed ingredients compared with in vivo determinations, but they also have some limitations. Determining the digestion kinetics of the different chemical components of feed ingredients, understanding how circadian rhythms affect feeding behavior and the gastrointestinal microbiome of pigs, and accounting for the functional properties of many feed ingredients in diet formulation are the emerging innovations that will facilitate improvements in precision swine nutrition and environmental sustainability in global pork-production systems.","Shurson, Gerald C.; Hung, Yuan-Tai; Jang, Jae Cheol; Urriola, Pedro E.",Animals (Basel),105,1

Focusing on a panel of validated sex-phenotype dependent male- and female-biased sDMRs, we tested the developmental dynamics of sex bias in liver methylation and the impacts of mutations in the androgen receptor, estrogen receptor alpha, or the transcriptional repressor Bcl6 gene. True hermaphrodites that carry both unilateral ovaries and contralateral testes were also tested. Our data show that sex bias in methylation either coincides with or follows sex bias in the expression of sDMR-proximal genes, suggesting that sex bias in gene expression may be required for demethylation at certain sDMRs. Global ablation of AR, ESR1, or a liver-specific loss of BCL6, all alter sDMR methylation, whereas presence of both an ovary and a testis delays the establishment of male-type methylation levels in hermaphrodites. Moreover, the Bcl6-LKO shows dissociation between expression and methylation, suggesting a distinct role of BCL6 in demethylation of intragenic sDMRs.","AlOgayil, Najla; Bauermeister, Klara; Galvez, Jose Hector; Venkatesh, Varun S.; Zhuang, Qinwei Kim-wee; Chang, Matthew L.; Davey, Rachel A.; Zajac, Jeffrey D.; Ida, Kinuyo; Kamiya, Akihide; Taketo, Teruko; Bourque, Guillaume; Naumova, Anna K.",Sci Rep,105,8

The OP-Fe(2+) chelate could also improve the hypertrophy of the spleen, serum iron (SI), total iron and binding capacity, and serum ferritin levels in the IDA rats. In addition, the OP-Fe(2+) treatment significantly increased the antioxidant activities of super oxidase and glutathione in the liver homogenate of the IDA rats. Therefore, the OP-Fe(2+) chelate is an effective type of iron supplement for IDA rats, which could be a promising source with anti-anemia and antioxidant activity.","Yuanqing, He; Pengyao, Yang; Yangyang, Ding; Min, Chen; Rui, Guo; Yuqing, Duan; Haihui, Zhang; Haile, Ma",Front Nutr,105,8

MATERIALS AND METHODS: MRI of the knee and standardized radiographs were obtained at baseline and after 2 years in 186 patients (81% female; aged 43–76 years; mean 60 years). MRI was analyzed for bone marrow lesions, cysts, osteophytes, hyaline cartilage defects, joint effusion, and meniscal pathology in the medial compartment. Radiographs were scored semiquantitatively for JSN in the medial tibiofemoral joint using the Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OARSI) atlas. Radiological progression was defined as ≥1 grade increase. Associations between baseline magnetic resonance (MR) parameters and subsequent radiographic JSN changes were assessed using logistic regression. Relative risk (RR) was then calculated. RESULTS: Radiographic progression of JSN was observed in 17 (9.1%) of 186 patients. Eleven patients had a Kellgren and Lawrence (KL) score of ≥2. A significant association was observed between all patients and meniscal tears (RR 3.57; confidence interval (CI) 1.08–10.0) and meniscal subluxation (RR 2.73; CI 1.20–5.41), between KL < 2 and meniscal subluxation (RR 11.3; CI 2.49–29.49) and KL ≥ 2 and meniscus tears (RR 8.91; CI 1.13–22.84) and radiographic JSN 2 years later. Follow-up MR in 15 of 17 patients with progressive JSN showed only new meniscal abnormalities and no progression of cartilage loss. CONCLUSION: Meniscal pathology (tears and/or meniscal subluxation) was the only MRI parameter to be associated with subsequent radiographic progression of JSN in the medial tibiofemoral compartment on a radiograph 2 years later, as assessed by the OARSI score.","Madan-Sharma, Ruby; Kloppenburg, Margreet; Kornaat, Peter R.; Botha-Scheepers, Stella A.; Le Graverand, Marie-Pierre Hellio; Bloem, Johannes L.; Watt, Iain",Skeletal Radiol,105,8

Disparities in SARI death in children aged <5 years exist in urban and rural areas. OBJECTIVE: To compare the factors associated with in-hospital death among children aged <5 years hospitalized with SARI in an urban vs. a rural setting in South Africa from 2009–2013. METHODS: Data were collected from hospitalized children with SARI in one urban and two rural sentinel surveillance hospitals. Nasopharyngeal aspirates were tested for ten respiratory viruses and blood for pneumococcal DNA using polymerase chain reaction. We used multivariable logistic regression to identify patient and clinical characteristics associated with in-hospital death. RESULTS: From 2009 through 2013, 5,297 children aged <5 years with SARI-associated hospital admission were enrolled; 3,811 (72%) in the urban and 1,486 (28%) in the rural hospitals. In-hospital case-fatality proportion (CFP) was higher in the rural hospitals (6.9%) than the urban hospital (1.3%, p<0.001), and among HIV-infected than the HIV-uninfected children (9.6% vs. 1.6%, p<0.001). In the urban hospital, HIV infection (odds ratio (OR):11.4, 95% confidence interval (CI):5.4–24.1) and presence of any other underlying illness (OR: 3.0, 95% CI: 1.0–9.2) were the only factors independently associated with death. In the rural hospitals, HIV infection (OR: 4.1, 95% CI: 2.3–7.1) and age <1 year (OR: 3.7, 95% CI: 1.9–7.2) were independently associated with death, whereas duration of hospitalization ≥5 days (OR: 0.5, 95% CI: 0.3–0.8) and any respiratory virus detection (OR: 0.4, 95% CI: 0.3–0.8) were negatively associated with death. CONCLUSION: We found that the case-fatality proportion was substantially higher among children admitted to rural hospitals and HIV infected children with SARI in South Africa. While efforts to prevent and treat HIV infections in children may reduce SARI deaths, further efforts to address health care inequality in rural populations are needed.","Ayeni, Oluwatosin A.; Walaza, Sibongile; Tempia, Stefano; Groome, Michelle; Kahn, Kathleen; Madhi, Shabir A.; Cohen, Adam L.; Moyes, Jocelyn; Venter, Marietjie; Pretorius, Marthi; Treurnicht, Florette; Hellferscee, Orienka; von Gottberg, Anne; Wolter, Nicole; Cohen, Cheryl",PLoS One,105,1

We sought to characterize heterogeneity in postoperative pain experiences. METHODS: We enrolled patients undergoing a cardiac surgery at a tertiary care center between January 2019 and February 2020. Participants received an electronically-delivered questionnaire every 3 days for 30 days to assess incision site pain level. We evaluated the variability in pain trajectories over 30 days by the cohort-level mean with confidence band and latent classes identified by group-based trajectory model. Group-based trajectory model estimated the probability of belonging to a specific trajectory of pain. RESULTS: Of 92 patients enrolled, 75 provided ≥3 questionnaire responses. The cohort-level mean showed a gradual and consistent decline in the mean pain level, but the confidence bands covered most of the pain score range. The individual-level trajectories varied substantially across patients. Group-based trajectory model identified 4 pain trajectories: persistently low (n=9, 12%), moderate declining (initially mid-level, followed by decline; n=26, 35%), high declining (initially high-level, followed by decline; n=33, 44%), and persistently high pain (n=7, 9%). Persistently high pain and high declining groups did not seem to be clearly distinguishable until approximately postoperative day 10. Patients in persistently low pain trajectory class had a numerically lower median age than the other 3 classes and were below the lower confidence band of the cohort-level approach. Patients in the persistently high pain trajectory class had a longer median length of hospital stay than the other 3 classes and were often higher than the upper confidence band of the cohort-level approach. CONCLUSIONS: We identified 4 trajectories of postoperative pain that were not evident from a cohort-level mean, which has been a common way of reporting pain level. This study provides key information about the patient experience and indicates the need to understand variation among sites and surgeons and to investigate determinants of different experience and interventions to mitigate persistently high pain.","Mori, Makoto; Brooks, Cornell; Dhruva, Sanket S.; Lu, Yuan; Spatz, Erica S.; Dey, Pranammya; Zhang, Yawei; Chaudhry, Sarwat I.; Geirsson, Arnar; Allore, Heather G.; Krumholz, Harlan M.",Circ Cardiovasc Qual Outcomes,105,1

Intensive interventions implemented since 2004 have reduced prevalence, but progress has stalled in recent years. A challenge for elimination has been malaria infections in residents acquired during travel to mainland Equatorial Guinea. The present article quantifies how off-island contributes to remaining malaria prevalence on Bioko Island, and investigates the potential role of a pre-erythrocytic vaccine in making further progress towards elimination. METHODS: Malaria transmission on Bioko Island was simulated using a model calibrated based on data from the Malaria Indicator Surveys (MIS) from 2015 to 2018, including detailed travel histories and malaria positivity by rapid-diagnostic tests (RDTs), as well as geospatial estimates of malaria prevalence. Mosquito population density was adjusted to fit local transmission, conditional on importation rates under current levels of control and within-island mobility. The simulations were then used to evaluate the impact of two pre-erythrocytic vaccine distribution strategies: mass treat and vaccinate, and prophylactic vaccination for off-island travellers. Lastly, a sensitivity analysis was performed through an ensemble of simulations fit to the Bayesian joint posterior probability distribution of the geospatial prevalence estimates. RESULTS: The simulations suggest that in Malabo, an urban city containing 80% of the population, there are some pockets of residual transmission, but a large proportion of infections are acquired off-island by travellers to the mainland. Outside of Malabo, prevalence was mainly attributable to local transmission. The uncertainty in the local transmission vs. importation is lowest within Malabo and highest outside. Using a pre-erythrocytic vaccine to protect travellers would have larger benefits than using the vaccine to protect residents of Bioko Island from local transmission. In simulations, mass treatment and vaccination had short-lived benefits, as malaria prevalence returned to current levels as the vaccine’s efficacy waned. Prophylactic vaccination of travellers resulted in longer-lasting reductions in prevalence. These projections were robust to underlying uncertainty in prevalence estimates. CONCLUSIONS: The modelled outcomes suggest that the volume of malaria cases imported from the mainland is a partial driver of continued endemic malaria on Bioko Island, and that continued elimination efforts on must account for human travel activity.

Widespread antibiotic resistance in K. pneumoniae—either through intrinsic mechanisms or via acquisition from different species, especially in hospital environments—limits the therapeutic options against this pathogen, further aggravating the disease burden. To date, there are no vaccines available against K. pneumoniae infection. Although formulations based on capsular polysaccharides have been proposed, the high variability in capsular serotypes limits vaccine coverage. Recombinant vaccines based on surface exposed bacterial antigens are a promising alternative owing to their conservation among different serotypes and accessibility to the immune system. Many vaccine candidates have been proposed, some of which have reached clinical trials. The present review summarizes the current status of K. pneumoniae vaccine development. Different strategies including whole cell vaccines, outer membrane vesicles (OMVs), ribosome, polysaccharide, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and protein-based formulations are discussed. The contribution of antibody and cell-mediated responses is also presented. In summary, K. pneumoniae vaccines are feasible and a promising strategy to prevent infections and to reduce the antimicrobial resistance burden worldwide.","Assoni, Lucas; Girardello, Raquel; Converso, Thiago Rojas; Darrieux, Michelle",Infect Dis Ther,105,1

No meta-analysis has ever addressed this issue. METHODS: “Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses” (PRISMA) and “Meta-analysis Of Observational Studies in Epidemiology” (MOOSE)–compliant meta-analysis. PubMed and Web of Science were searched until November 2020 (PROSPERO:CRD42021229223). We included nonoverlapping longitudinal studies (RCTs-control condition and observational cohorts) reporting the transition to psychosis in CHR-P individuals. The primary effect size measure was the cumulative risk of transition at 0.5, 1, and 2 years follow-up in RCTs compared to observational cohorts. Random effects meta-analyses, heterogeneity assessment, quality assessment, and meta-regressions were conducted. RESULTS: Ninety-four independent studies (24 RCTs, 70 observational cohorts) and 9,243 individuals (mean age = 20.1 ± 3.0 years; 43.7% females) were included. The meta-analytical risk of transitioning to psychosis from a CHR-P stage was 0.091 (95% confidence intervals [CI] = 0.068–0.121) at 0.5 years, 0.140 (95% CI = 0.101–0.191) at 1 year and 0.165 (95% CI = 0.097–0.267) at 2 years follow-up in RCTs, and 0.081 (95% CI = 0.067–0.099) at 0.5 years, 0.138 (95% CI = 0.114–0.167) at 1 year, and 0.174 (95% CI = 0.156–0.193) at 2 years follow-up in observational cohorts. There were no between-group differences in transition risks (p > 0.05).

This systematic review aimed to assess the impacts of school feeding on educational and health outcomes of children and adolescents in LMICs. METHODS: Interventional studies on the effects of school feeding on nutritional and health outcomes of children and adolescents receiving primary or secondary education in LMICs were included. MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, the Cochrane Library, and grey literature were searched (through December 2019) to identify eligible studies. We included randomized controlled trials and controlled before-after studies on school feeding conducted in LMICs among children and adolescents aged 6 to 19 who received primary or secondary education. Two reviewers independently conducted study selection, data extraction, and risk of bias assessment. Meta-analyses were performed for outcomes available in three or more independent studies. Subgroup analyses were conducted by study design and school feeding modality whenever possible. RESULTS: Fifty-seven articles met the inclusion criteria for the review, including 44 randomized controlled trials and 13 controlled before-after studies; 19 articles were included in the meta-analysis. School feeding resulted in a significant increase in height (mean difference = 0.32 cm; confidence interval (CI) = 0.03, 0.61; P = 0.032) and weight (mean difference: 0.58 kg; 95% 95% CI = 0.22, 0.93; P = 0.001) over 12 months, compared to those in the control groups. School feeding also resulted in a significant increase in the percentage of school days attended (2.6%; 95% CI = 1.2%, 3.9%; P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: School feeding is an important approach to improving the health and education outcomes of children and adolescents living in LMICs.

To improve the antitumor activity of BA, a polyvinyl caprolactam–polyvinyl acetate–polyethylene glycol (PVCL–PVA–PEG) graft copolymer (Soluplus) encapsulated BA micelle (Soluplus-BA) was fabricated. The Soluplus-BA micelles presented a mean size of 54.77 ± 1.26 nm and a polydispersity index (PDI) of 0.083. The MTT assay results showed that Soluplus-BA micelles increased the inhibitory effect of BA on MDA-MB-231 cells, mainly due to the enhanced accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the destruction of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP). Soluplus-BA micelles induced the DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) as the γH2AX foci increased. Moreover, Soluplus-BA also inhibited the tube formation and migration of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), and inhibited the neovascularization of the chicken chorioallantoic membrane (CAM). This angiogenesis inhibitory effect may be accomplished by regulating the HIF-1/VEGF-FAK signaling pathway.

Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) with fully myeloablative conditioning may be curative but has been associated with poor outcomes. Reports of reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) and reduced-toxicity conditioning (RTC) regimens suggest these approaches are well tolerated, but outcomes are not well established. Retrospective data were collected from an international cohort of 40 patients with XIAP deficiency who underwent HCT with RIC or RTC. Thirty-three (83%) patients had a history of HLH, and thirteen (33%) patients had IBD. Median age at HCT was 6.5 years. Grafts were from HLA-matched (n = 30, 75%) and HLA-mismatched (n = 10, 25%) donors. There were no cases of primary graft failure. Two (5%) patients experienced secondary graft failure, and three (8%) patients ultimately received a second HCT. Nine (23%) patients developed grade II–IV acute GVHD, and 3 (8%) developed extensive chronic GVHD. The estimated 2-year overall and event-free survival rates were 74% (CI 55–86%) and 64% (CI 46–77%), respectively.

These experiments are frequently used for in vitro assessment of lung injury. The data derived from ECIS experiments consists of repeated measures of resistance across an endothelial monolayer. As such, these data reflect the dynamic changes in electrical resistance that occur over time. Currently methodologies for assessing ECIS data rely on single point assessments of barrier function, such as the maximal drop in trans‐endothelial electrical resistance (TER(Max)). However, this approach ignores the myriad of changes in resistance that occur before and after the TER(Max) data point. Herein, we utilize polynomial curve fitting on experimentally generated ECIS data, thus allowing for comparing ECIS experiments by examining the mean polynomial coefficients between groups. We show that polynomial curves accurately fit a variety of ECIS data, and that concordance between TER(Max) and coefficient analysis varies by type of stimulus, suggesting that TER(Max) differences may not always correlate with a significant difference in the overall shape of the ECIS profile. Lastly, we identify factors that impact coefficient values obtained in our analyses, including the length of time devoted to baseline measurements before addition of stimuli. Polynomial coefficient analysis is another tool that can be used for more comprehensive interrogation of ECIS data to better understand the biological underpinnings that lead to changes in barrier dysfunction in vitro.","Suresh, Karthik; Servinsky, Laura; Johnston, Laura; Punjabi, Naresh M.; Dudek, Steven M.; Damarla, Mahendra",Physiol Rep,105,8

None of the 29 European Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies member states that responded have a developed a formally adopted first aid program to train the elderly. A tailored first aid training program for the elderly could be one of the many steps that should be taken to ensure adequate health care for the elderly population.","Dolenc, Eva; Slabe, Damjan; Kovačič, Uroš",PLoS One,105,1

Cells were cultured at different temperatures and membrane changes involving the Golgi apparatus and Golgi apparatus-associated membrane structures were monitored by electron microscopy and quantitated. With 30 min of incubation, membranes of the Golgi apparatus stack increased in amount at temperatures of 16°C and below compared to temperatures above 18°C. The increase was greatest along the major polarity axis as evidenced by an increased stack height. Neither the number of cisternae per stack nor the average stack diameter (width) was affected by temperature. The response was maximal between 15 and 30 min of low temperature treatment of the cells. Results with cells infected and uninfected with feline immunodeficiency virus were similar. The increase in stack height was due primarily to an increase of membranes at the cis face (cis Golgi apparatus network). At 18°C, membranes of the trans Golgi apparatus network accumulated suggesting that import from the cis Golgi network could proceed at this temperature, whereas exit from the trans Golgi network was still at least partially blocked. Also increased at 16°C and below were numbers of transition vesicles in the space between the Golgi apparatus and the transitional endoplasmic reticulum associated with the cis Golgi apparatus face. The results suggested interruption of the orderly flux of membranes into the Golgi apparatus at 16°C and below. Moreover, the block appeared to be reversible. Upon transfer from 16°C to 37°C, there was a time-dependent decrease in the accumulations of cis compartment membrane accompanied by a corresponding equivalent increase in the membranes of the trans Golgi apparatus compartment.","Morré, D.

The PK of ERV in subjects with end stage renal disease (ESRD) or hepatic impairment (HI) were investigated. METHODS: Two multi-center studies were completed; one in subjects with ESRD and one in subjects with mild, moderate or severe HI based upon Child-Pugh scoring. Each included a cohort of healthy subjects (HS) matched by gender, age and BMI. A single IV dose of 1.5 mg/kg ERV was administered. PK parameters were calculated using standard non-compartmental methods and within study comparisons of PK for the ESRD and HI subjects were made with HS. RESULTS: The following comparative AUC(inf) and C(max) values for ERV were observed: CONCLUSION: Following a single IV dose of ERV, the systemic exposures in subjects with ESRD and mild or moderate hepatic impairment were similar to those observed in HS. The 2-fold increase in AUC(inf) observed in subjects with severe HI did not result in increased adverse events. Therefore, no dose adjustment should be required when ERV is given to subjects with either renal or hepatic impairment.

Ventilation of aircraft has several significant variables that require control measures that are seldom of concern for occupied space at ground level. The principal of these special requirements are the need to compensate for the substantial difference between cabin and outside pressures, the much lower available space per occupant in aircraft cabins, and the need for coping with more extreme external temperatures than are common at ground level. The breadth of these concerns is of interest in the policies and regulatory aspects of a number of agencies which are briefly described, and their roles and areas of potential interest outlined. Types of possible contaminants are listed, and the limits which have been set by several of these agencies for many of these potential contaminants are tabulated. In addition recent measured aircraft cabin concentrations of several key contaminants are listed.

Any kind of impairment in protein production, such as production of mutated protein, or misfolded protein, leads to disruption of the pathway controlled by that protein. This may manifest in the form of the disease. However, these diseases can be treated, by supplying the protein from outside or exogenously. The supply of active exogenous protein requires its production on large scale to fulfill the growing demand. The process is complex, requiring higher protein expression, purification, and processing. Each product needs unique settings or standardizations for large-scale production and purification. As only large-scale production can fulfill the growing demand, thus it needs to be cost-effective. The tools of genetic engineering are utilized to produce the proteins of human origin in bacteria, fungi, insect, or mammalian host. Usage of recombinant DNA technology for large-scale production of proteins requires ample amount of time, labor, and resources, but it also offers many opportunities for economic growth. After reading this chapter, readers would be able to understand the basics about production of recombinant proteins in various hosts along with the advantages and limitations of each host system and properties and production of some of the important pharmaceutical compounds and growth factors.","Gupta, Varsha; Sengupta, Manjistha; Prakash, Jaya; Tripathy, Baishnab Charan",Basic and Applied Aspects of Biotechnology,105,28

Xenotransplantation is one possible solution for the organ donor shortage in the area of transplant medicine(77). However, there is still a ban on this type of procedure because of the lack of clarity about the sort of risks entailed. The natural rejection responses to cross–species components still create insurmountable problems. The transfer of viral DNA with, as yet, unpredictable consequences is also another matter that requires due attention.

The enzymatic breakdown of kinins affects the duration of their biological actions as the plasma half-life of intravenously injected BK is in the range of seconds. Kinins are cleaved in vitro and in vivo by enzymes that belong to families, such as zinc-metallopeptidases, astacin-like metallopeptidases, and catheptic enzymes. Vane noted the importance of the pulmonary circulation in the metabolism of vasoactive substances, such as BK as well as angiotensin 1 and 5- hydroxytryptamine. It is clear after decades of research that angiotensin 1-converting enzyme (ACE) on the vascular endothelial cell surface is the most important inactivator of blood-borne BK. BK may act primarily in an autocrine and paracrine fashion, establishing the importance of local regulation of its activity by enzymes on cell surfaces. Thus, the assortment of other enzymes that can inactivate BK is important in a variety of physiological and pathological situations. Most physiological systems have redundant pathways of metabolism so that the abolishment of one pathway is compensated for by the presence of others. This is demonstrated by the pharmacological inhibition of ACE in hypertension.","Erdös, Ervin G.; Skidgel, Randal A.",The Kinin System,105,1

As the list of viruses capable of infecting the CNS expanded rapidly during the earlier part of the 20th century, so too did the recognition that individual viruses exhibited specific affinities for particular regions of the nervous system, and often for particular cell types within these regions. In this part of our review we will focus specifically on the role played by the interaction between specific viral proteins (‘cell attachment proteins’) and receptors on target cells in determining the tropism of certain viruses for the CNS. In a subsequent article, the role of host genes, the site of entry and route of spread of virus, and the contribution of tissue-specific viral genes (enhancers) to viral neurotropism will be reviewed.","Tyler, Kenneth L.",Trends Neurosci,105,1

This pattern of resistance is due mainly to dissemination of carbapenemase genes. Molecular characterization of carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CR-KP) strains was performed over a three-year period. In-depth analysis was performed on a subset of emerging CR-KP ST101 and ST307 clones. METHODS: A prospective study was performed on 691 patients with CR-KP bloodstream infections hospitalized in 19 hospitals located in three large provinces in Southern Italy. Carbapenemase genes were identified via genotyping methods. Multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) and Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) were carried out on ST101 and ST307 isolates. RESULTS: Among the CR-KP isolates, bla(KPC) was found in 95.6%, bla(VIM) was found in 3.5%, bla(NDM) was found in 0.1% and bla(OXA-48) was found in 0.1%. The bla(KPC-3) variant was identified in all 104 characterized KPC-KP isolates. MLST of 231 representative isolates revealed ST512 in 45.5%, ST101 in 20.3% and ST307 in 18.2% of the isolates. cgMLST of ST307 and ST101 isolates revealed presence of more than one beta-lactam resistance gene. Amino acid substitution in the chromosomal colistin-resistance gene pmrB was found in two ST101 isolates. CONCLUSIONS: ST512 is widespread in Southern Italy, but ST101 and ST307 are emerging since they were found in a significant proportion of cases. Aggressive infection control measures and a continuous monitoring of these high-risk clones are necessary to avoid rapid spread of CR-KP, especially in hospital settings.","Loconsole, Daniela; Accogli, Marisa; De Robertis, Anna Lisa; Capozzi, Loredana; Bianco, Angelica; Morea, Anna; Mallamaci, Rosanna; Quarto, Michele; Parisi, Antonio; Chironna, Maria",Ann Clin Microbiol Antimicrob,105,11

To date, through mainly self-reporting methodology, metacognition assessment lacks objective evidence and therefore hinder the discussion of its subjective and implicit nature. In exploring ME, eye-tracking and skin conductance response (SCR) offer certain advantages over self-reporting methods. However, to date, most studies tend to focus on utilizing these measures to explore metacognitive skills (MS) rather than ME. Also, while some studies do explore ME with these measures tend to utilize the data from a summative perspective rather than aligning the data with the real-time ME behaviours. Based on previous works in this field, this research will discuss how feeling of difficulty (i.e. a type of ME) functions in real-time based on the hypothesis that eye-tracking and SCR data can provide objective measures. Through such, a better understanding of how FOD functions could be gained and therefore contribute to the support of learners’ metacognitive competencies.","Ching-En, Chou; Porayska-Pomsta, Kaska",Artificial Intelligence in Education,105,8

Poor sleep quality is associated with adverse outcomes, chiefly cardiovascular, in young and middle-aged subjects, possibly because of its association with metabolic syndrome (MetS). However, the correlates of sleep quality in oldest populations are unknown. We evaluated the association of sleep quality with MetS in a cohort of subjects aged 90+. METHODS AND RESULTS: We analysed data of 343 subjects aged 90+ living in the Mugello area (Tuscany, Italy). Quality of sleep was assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Assessment Index (PSQI). Good quality of sleep was defined by a PSQI score < 5. MetS was diagnosed according to the National Cholesterol Education Program’s ATP-III criteria; 83 (24%) participants reported good quality of sleep. MetS was diagnosed in 110 (24%) participants. In linear and logistic models, MetS was inversely associated with PSQI score ((B = − 1.04; 95% CI − 2.06 to − .03; P = .044), with increased probability of good sleep quality (OR = 2.52; 95% CI 1.26–5.02; P = .009), and with a PSQI below the median (OR = 2.11; 95% CI 1.11–3.40, P = .022), after adjusting. None of the single components of MetS were associated with PSQI (all P values > .050). However, an increasing number of MetS components was associated with increasing probability of good quality of sleep (P for trend = .002), and of PSQI below the median (P for trend = .007). Generalized Additive Model analysis documented no smoothing function suggestive of nonlinear association between PSQI and MetS. CONCLUSION: Our results confirm a high prevalence of poor sleep quality in oldest age; however, in these subjects, MetS seems to be associated with better sleep quality. Additional larger, dedicated studies are required to confirm our results, and, if so, to identify the subsystems involved and the potential therapeutic implications of such an association.","Laudisio, Alice; Giovannini, Silvia; Finamore, Panaiotis; Navarini, Luca; Margiotta, Domenico Paolo Emanuele; Vannetti, Federica; Macchi, Claudio; Coraci, Daniele; Imbimbo, Isabella; Molino-Lova, Raffaello; Loreti, Claudia; Antonelli Incalzi, Raffaele; Zuccalà, Giuseppe; Padua, Luca",Diabetol Metab Syndr,105,8

In this work, we use a static analysis by abstract interpretation and model counting to construct probabilistic analysis of deterministic programs with uncertain input data, which can be used for estimating the probabilities of assertions (program reliability). In particular, we automatically infer necessary preconditions in order a given assertion to be satisfied/violated at run-time using a combination of forward and backward static analyses. The focus is on numeric properties of variables and numeric abstract domains, such as polyhedra. The obtained preconditions in the form of linear constraints are then analyzed to quantify how likely is an input to satisfy them. Model counting techniques are employed to count the number of solutions that satisfy given linear constraints. These counts are then used to assess the probability that the target assertion is satisfied/violated. We also present how to extend our approach to analyze non-deterministic programs by inferring sufficient preconditions. We built a prototype implementation and evaluate it on several interesting examples.","Dimovski, Aleksandar S.; Legay, Axel",Fundamental Approaches to Software Engineering,105,1

In a compositional verification setting, where the system consists of processes executing in parallel, this partition allows us to decide whether each individual process can be minimized for either divergence-preserving branching (if the process contains only weak actions) or strong (otherwise) bisimilarity, while preserving the truth value of the formula. In this paper, we refine this idea by devising a family of bisimilarity relations, named sharp bisimilarities, parameterized by the set of strong actions. We show that these relations have all the nice properties necessary to be used for compositional verification, in particular congruence and adequacy with the logic. We also illustrate their practical utility on several examples and case-studies, and report about our success in the RERS 2019 model checking challenge.","Lang, Frédéric; Mateescu, Radu; Mazzanti, Franco",Tools and Algorithms for the Construction and Analysis of Systems,105,28

Previously, we designed a publicly available platform for the ultra-high-throughput screening (uHTS) of the specificity of surface-exposed receptors of the living eukaryotic cells, which was done by consolidating the phage display and flow cytometry techniques. Here, we significantly improved this methodology and designed the fADL-1e-based phage vectors that do not require a helper hyperphage for the virion assembly. The enhanced screening procedure was tested on soluble human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II molecules and transgenic antigen-specific B cells that express recombinant lymphoid B-cell receptor (BCR).

Commonly used electronic data collection systems lack a myriad of critical features, including a modern technology stack, new data encryption and security standards, study workflows, and reporting algorithms. Moreover, these systems do not have multilingual mapping functionalities of survey and consent forms. All of these components ultimately increase selection bias while simultaneously reducing the security and quality of the response data. In order to directly address the aforementioned issues, we have developed a multilingual and highly secure data management platform. Our application is built using stable, tested, and modular programming frameworks and design patterns targeted at accommodating intricately complex structures of polyglot mapping, large volume of data, encryption and granular user authorization. The statistical accuracy along with the multilingual mapping are the core highlights of this system. The multilingual function of this platform has the ability to eliminate selection biases while creating a well-balanced cross-section of society. Modern survey design workflows and validation checks ultimately prevent data loss and help reduce data collection errors. The platform design was initiated in April 1, 2020 and has been pilot tested for use in multilingual populations. The currently active application version of the system is capable of supporting in-person and telephone interviews, emailing survey links to every registered participant, building family tree architecture, and online consent management.

In a previous study, we mapped the use of ORS treatment subnationally and found that ORS coverage increased over time, while the use of home-made alternatives or recommended home fluids (RHF) decreased, in many countries. These patterns were particularly striking within Senegal, Mali, and Sierra Leone. It was unclear, however, whether ORS replaced RHF in these locations or if children were left untreated, and if these patterns were associated with health policy changes. METHODS: We used a Bayesian geostatistical model and data from household surveys to map the percentage of children with diarrhea that received (1) any ORS, (2) only RHF, or (3) no oral rehydration treatment between 2000 and 2018. This approach allowed examination of whether RHF was replaced with ORS before and after interventions, policies, and external events that may have impacted healthcare access. RESULTS: We found that RHF was replaced with ORS in most Sierra Leone districts, except those most impacted by the Ebola outbreak. In addition, RHF was replaced in northern but not in southern Mali, and RHF was not replaced anywhere in Senegal. In Senegal, there was no statistical evidence that a national policy promoting ORS use was associated with increases in coverage. In Sierra Leone, ORS coverage increased following a national policy change that abolished health costs for children. CONCLUSIONS: Children in parts of Mali and Senegal have been left behind during ORS scale-up. Improved messaging on effective diarrhea treatment and/or increased ORS access such as through reducing treatment costs may be needed to prevent child deaths in these areas.

This research formulated a big data center sustainability evaluation model that integrates multiple-criteria decision-making methods based on the analytic network process and fuzzy technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution (TOPSIS). Furthermore, a case study was used to examine the proposed model. The refrigeration system, layout and ventilation, data center location, data volume, and server power consumption are the five most crucial factors in determining the sustainability level of a big data center. The areas that require further development are the balancing of tasks on different IT equipment, renewable energy use, and waste heat utilization. This research provides a method or guide that can be used by managers when they build new big data centers or upgrade and optimize existing big data centers to make them more sustainable. This study is the first to assess the sustainability of a big data center according to multiple criteria decision-making methods, in which fuzzy theory is applied to evaluate the imprecise and subjective judgments of decision-makers. This study provides a systematic evaluation framework that is based on qualitative and quantitative criteria and comprises the four factors of big data level, equipment level, room level, and data center level.

Thus, EIII may constitute a virulence factor for endothelial damage. In this study, we examined endothelial cell death induced by treatment with DENV and EIII in vitro. Notably, pyroptosis, the major type of endothelial cell death observed, was attenuated through treatment with Nlrp3 inflammasome inhibitors. EIII injection effectively induced endothelial abnormalities, and sequential injection of EIII and DENV-NS1 autoantibodies induced further vascular damage, liver dysfunction, thrombocytopenia, and hemorrhage, which are typical manifestations in DHF. Under the same treatments, pathophysiological changes in the Nlrp3 inflammasome–deficient mice were notably reduced compared with those in the wild-type mice. These results suggest that the Nlrp3 inflammasome constitutes a potential therapeutic target for treating DENV-induced hemorrhage in DHF.","Lien, Te-Sheng; Sun, Der-Shan; Wu, Cheng-Yeu; Chang, Hsin-Hou",Front Immunol,105,4

To investigate if there are differences in language use across the One Health domains, we examined the peer-reviewed literature using a combination of text data mining and natural language processing techniques on 20,000 open-access articles related to AMR and One Health. Evaluating AMR key term frequency from the European PubMed Collection published between 1990 and 2019 showed distinct AMR language usage within each domain and incongruent language usage across domains, with significant differences in key term usage frequencies when articles were grouped by the One Health sub-specialties (2-way ANOVA; p < 0.001). Over the 29-year period, “antibiotic resistance” and “AR” were used 18 times more than “antimicrobial resistance” and “AMR”. The discord of language use across One Health potentially weakens the effectiveness of interdisciplinary research by creating accessibility issues for researchers using search engines. This research was the first to quantify this disparate language use within One Health, which inhibits collaboration and crosstalk between domains. We suggest the following for authors publishing AMR-related research within the One Health context: (1) increase title/abstract searchability by including both antimicrobial and antibiotic resistance related search terms; (2) include “One Health” in the title/abstract; and (3) prioritize open-access publication.","Wind, Lauren L.; Briganti, Jonathan S.; Brown, Anne M.; Neher, Timothy P.; Davis, Meghan F.; Durso, Lisa M.; Spicer, Tanner; Lansing, Stephanie",Antibiotics (Basel),105,1

In this study, we address the role of Apilimod, a pharmacological inhibitor of the lipid kinase PIKfyve, in the regulation of cardiac pathological fibrotic remodeling and TGFβ signaling pathway. Methods: The effects of Apilimod treatment on myocardial fibrosis, hypertrophy and cardiac function were assessed in vivo in a mouse model of pressure overload-induced heart failure. Primary cardiac fibroblasts and HeLa cells treated with Apilimod as well as genetic mutation of PIKfyve in mouse embryonic fibroblasts were used as cell models. Results: When administered in vivo, Apilimod reduced myocardial interstitial fibrosis development and prevented left ventricular dysfunction. In vitro, Apilimod controlled TGFβ-dependent activation of primary murine cardiac fibroblasts. Mechanistically, both Apilimod and genetic mutation of PIKfyve induced TGFβ receptor blockade in intracellular vesicles, negatively modulating its downstream signaling pathway and ultimately dampening TGFβ response. Conclusions: Altogether, our findings propose a novel function for PIKfyve in the control of myocardial fibrotic remodeling and the TGFβ signaling pathway, therefore opening the way to new therapeutic perspectives to prevent adverse fibrotic remodeling using Apilimod treatment.","Cinato, Mathieu; Guitou, Laurie; Saidi, Amira; Timotin, Andrei; Sperazza, Erwan; Duparc, Thibaut; Zolov, Sergey N.; Giridharan, Sai Srinivas Panapakkam; Weisman, Lois S.; Martinez, Laurent O.; Roncalli, Jerome; Kunduzova, Oksana; Tronchere, Helene; Boal, Frederic",Theranostics,105,1

It is unclear whether this is driven by an increased risk of infection or complications. We therefore aimed to investigate the incidence of clinically diagnosed influenza/influenza-like illness (ILI) by ethnicity in England from 2008-2018. Methods: We used linked primary and secondary healthcare data (from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink [CPRD] GOLD and Aurum databases and Hospital Episodes Statistics Admitted Patient Care [HES APC]). We included patients with recorded ethnicity who were aged 40-64 years and did not have a chronic health condition that would render them eligible for influenza vaccination. ILI infection was identified from diagnostic codes in CPRD and HES APC. We calculated crude annual infection incidence rates by ethnic group. Multivariable Poisson regression models with random effects were used to estimate any ethnic disparities in infection risk. Our main analysis adjusted for age, sex, and influenza year. Results: A total of 3,735,308 adults aged 40-64 years were included in the study; 87.6% White, 5.2% South Asian, 4.2% Black, 1.9% Other, and 1.1% Mixed. We identified 102,316 ILI episodes recorded among 94,623 patients. The rate of ILI was highest in the South Asian (9.6 per 1,000 person-years), Black (8.4 per 1,000 person-years) and Mixed (6.9 per 1,000 person-years) ethnic groups. The ILI rate in the White ethnic group was 5.7 per 1,000 person-years. After adjustment for age sex and influenza year, higher incidence rate ratios (IRR) for ILI were seen for South Asian (1.70, 95% CI 1.66-1.75), Black (1.48, 1.44-1.53) and Mixed (1.22, 1.15-1.30) groups compared to White ethnicity.

Consequently, chest high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) demands are increasing, regarding patients’ screening, initial evaluation and follow up. This study aims to evaluate the detection accuracy of ultra-low-dose chest CT in comparison with the routine low-dose chest CT to reduce the irradiation exposure hazards. RESULTS: This study was prospectively conducted on 250 patients during the period from 15th December 2020 to 10th February 2021. All of the included patients were clinically suspected of COVID-19 infection. All patients were subjected to routine low-dose (45 mAs) and ultra-low-dose (22 mAs) chest CT examinations. Finally, all patients had confirmatory PCR swab tests and other dedicated laboratory tests. They included 149 males and 101 females (59.6%:40.4%). Their age ranged from 16 to 84 years (mean age 50 ± 34 SD). Patients were divided according to body weight; 104 patients were less than 80 kg, and 146 patients were more than 80 kg. HRCT findings were examined by two expert consultant radiologists independently, and data analysis was performed by other two expert specialist and consultant radiologists. The inter-observer agreement (IOA) was excellent (96–100%). The ultra-low-dose chest CT reached 93.53–96.84% sensitivity and 90.38–93.84% accuracy. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is 12.8:16.1; CTDIvol (mGy) = 1.1 ± 0.3, DLP (mGy cm) = 42.2 ± 7.9, mean effective dose (mSv/mGy cm) = 0.59 and absolute cancer risk = 0.02 × 10(-4). CONCLUSION: Ultra-low-dose HRCT can be reliably used during the second wave of COVID-19 pandemic to reduce the irradiation exposure hazards.","Samir, Ahmed; El-Husseiny, Reham Mohamed; Sweed, Rania Ahmed; El-Maaboud, Nermeen Abd El-Monsef Abd; Masoud, Mohamed",Egypt J Radiol Nucl Med,105,11

Despite public awareness that certain medical conditions exacerbate COVID-19 illness severity, little is known about whether these patients have unique concerns and/or engage in unsafe practices to prevent COVID-19 infection. We compared the concerns and practices between adults with and without underlying medical conditions associated with greater COVID-19 severity. METHODS: An online survey was distributed among urban residents between July-August 2020 to inquire about food handling concerns and practices. Participants were included in the “higher-risk” group if they had ≥1 medical condition known to aggravate COVID-19 severity. Participants without any of these underlying medical conditions were included in the comparison group. Food handling concerns were rated on a 5-point scale (1 = never, 5 = always) and practices were determined using “yes/no” responses. Between-group differences in food handling beliefs and practices were analyzed with independent t-tests and Fisher's exact tests. RESULTS: Participants (n = 437) had a mean age of 34.2 ± 0.5 years. The higher-risk group (n = 132) was more concerned about foodborne transmission of COVID-19, regardless of food vehicle, than the comparison group (all ps < 0.0001). The higher-risk group also washed produce with cleaning agents (e.g., soap, hydrogen peroxide) more frequently [3.1 ± 1.6 vs. 2.5 ± 1.7; P = 0.001]. Relative to the comparison group, the higher-risk group left perishable food items outside for >1 hour (P < 0.0001) and washed raw meats with water and/or cleaning agents more often (P = 0.0001), while washing their hands before food preparation less often (P = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Those at higher risk of greater COVID-19 severity were more concerned with foodborne COVID-19 transmission and more frequently engaged in unsafe food handling practices than those without underlying conditions. Effective methods are needed to correct misinformation surrounding COVID-19 foodborne transmission, especially among those with underlying medical conditions.

Related to orthopedic surgery and traumatology, a decrease of up to a third has been observed according to published series. But a secondary center may need more adjustments than a first level one. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Retrospective study, comparing data from the first Sate of Alarm (03/14/20 – 06/21/20) with the same period of 2019. The number of surgeries, hospitalizations and diagnoses were selected as primary outcomes, and injury mechanisms, kind of surgeries and differences in time to surgery as secondary outcomes. RESULTS: Surgical activity went from 462 cases in 2019 to 190 cases in 2020 (59% less). The main reason for intervention during the State of Alarm was fractures, with 129 cases out of the total (compared to 167 in 2019); being orthopedics in 2019 (178 cases compared to 40).The most frequent fracture in both groups was the hip fracture, with 71 cases in 2019 compared to 59 in 2020.Accidents on public places, associated with sports practice and related to traffic, were reduced by 1/3. CONCLUSIONS: A more striking reduction in surgical activity is observed than that reflected in other series, probably due to the case of programmed surgery. Perhaps in centers with greater capacity this measure is not that necessary. In the same circumstances, up to 50% of the ORTR staff could be used to treat other pathologies safely.","García Arias, A; Lanuza Lagunilla, L; García Cuello, L; Suárez-Anta Rodríguez, P; Camblor Valladares, A; Meneses Gutiérrez, A; Cabria Fernández, J; Mateo Negreira, J",Br J Surg,105,4

Main funding source(s): Non-conditioning grant from Sanofi Italia. BACKGROUND. Awareness and risk knowledge are the first steps along the complex journey leading to effective primordial, primary and secondary cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention. Interactions among people significantly influence awareness and personal beliefs and favour behavioral changes. Given the increased use of Internet to search information and share experiences on health, Web and social media represent innovative health-information-gathering sources, facilitating interactions and information exchanges able to influence health-related behaviour. PURPOSE. This study is based on a longitudinal Web listening analysis approach, aimed at analyzing and comparing Web discussions collected before the COVID-19 pandemic (February 2018–February 2020) with those occurred during the first pandemic wave in Italy (March–July 2020). METHODS. A preliminary analysis of the data indexed by prominent search engines (i.e., Google) was performed, followed by a systematic process of data collection. Automated data identification was analyzed using data mining techniques, machine learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithms. This analysis was integrated by a qualitative analysis. RESULTS. In Italy, over the entire study timeframe, Web conversations associated to health topics were primarily focused on vaccines and tumors, and discussions on CVDs (about 235,000 conversations) were only at the 5th place. The main topics of the conversations concerned symptoms (25%), treatments (18%), causes of disease (14%), quality of life (13%). Conversations on prevention were marginal (only 5%). During the pandemic timeframe discussion topics were focused on the growing COVID-19 risk for people with CV comorbidities, the risk linked to CVD therapies and the difficulties and delays in accessing hospitals. Over 80% of patients were not satisfied about their caring experience and such dissatisfaction grew stronger during the pandemic. In this period, anxiety, frustration, fear and depression were the mainly mentioned feelings. A good relationship with physicians (empathy, understanding) was mentioned by patients as a key factor of a positive caring experience. CONCLUSIONS. The limited attention to CVDs and their prevention registered through the conversations on the Web is not consistent with the epidemiological relevance of such diseases in terms of health risks and mortality. Given the crucial role of Web interactions in influencing beliefs and health-related behaviours, this study highlights the urgency to promote novel prevention strategies and to engage people leveraging digital channels and social media. The COVID-19 pandemic worsened the quality of relationship and contact with physicians. Such evidence underlines further the need to develop novel models of patient management - even remotely (digital tools, telemedicine), to encourage citizen/patient involvement and empowerment.","Magni, P; Cecchini, I; Fortunati, M; Biroli, M; Massaroni, K; Folco, E; Giudice, D; Montebelli, M; Ciancamerla, G",Eur J Prev Cardiol,105,28

The results show that the evolution of herding behavior reduces information asymmetry and improves market efficiency, especially when the borrowing is allowed. In addition, the fundamental strategy is diffused by herding evolution, but TGC market efficiency may be remarkably reduced by herding with borrowing mechanism. Moreover, the herding behavior may evolve to an equilibrium where the revenue of market players is comparable, thus the fairness in TGC market is improved.","Zuo, Yi; Zhao, Xingang",Front,105,1

To help answer this question, this article provides an historic overview of NATO’s policy approaches towards China. Contrary to the belief of many officials and commentators, China is not a new topic for the Alliance. In fact, China has regularly featured in NATO policies since the early Cold War, alternating between adversary to ally and back again.

New strategies and methods for prevention and management of CMV infection are urgently needed. We aim to review the new developments in diagnostics, prevention, and management strategies of CMV infection in Allo-HSCT recipients. RECENT FINDINGS: The approval of the novel anti-CMV drug letermovir in 2017 has led to an increase in the use of antiviral prophylaxis as a preferred approach for prevention in many centers. Real-world studies have shown efficacy similar to the clinical trial. CMV-specific T cell-mediated immunity assays identify patients with immune reconstitution and predict disease progression. Phase 2 trials of maribavir have shown its efficacy as preemptive therapy and treatment of resistant and refractory CMV infections. Adoptive T cell therapy is an emerging option for treatment of refractory and resistant CMV. Of the different CMV vaccine trials, PepVax has shown promising results in a phase 1 trial. SUMMARY: CMV cell-mediated immunity assays have potential to be used as an adjunctive test to develop individualized management plan by identifying the patients who develop immune reconstitution; however, further prospective interventional studies are needed. Maribavir and adoptive T cell therapy are promising new therapies for treatment of CMV infections. CMV vaccine trials for prevention are also under way.","Jakharia, Niyati; Howard, Dianna; Riedel, David J.",Curr Treat Options Infect Dis,105,1

Intravenous injection of camels with a single dose of lornoxicam induced a significant change in the camel leukogram, which is characterized by reduced cell numbers of all leukocyte subpopulations. In vitro analysis of cell vitality revealed a pro-apoptotic effect of lornoxicam on camel leukocytes, which may be responsible for the lornoxicam-induced leukocytopenia in vivo. Functional ex vivo and in vitro analysis of the key antimicrobial functions, phagocytosis and ROS production indicates inhibitory effects of lornoxicam on the antimicrobial capacity of the blood phagocytes, monocytes and neutrophils. Furthermore, lornoxicam induced an anti-inflammatory phenotype of monocytes, characterized by reduced expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules and increased expression of CD163 molecules. The present study identified for the first time inhibitory effects of the COX-inhibitor lornoxicam on some phenotypic and functional properties of camel blood immune cells and recommends considering these effects when using lornoxicam in camel medicine. ABSTRACT: (1) Background: Lornoxicam is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) with analgesic, antiphlogistic and antipyretic effects. The improved tolerance of lornoxicam due to the relatively shorter elimination half-life in comparison to other members of the oxicams may favor its application in the management of pain and inflammation in race dromedary camels. There are no studies conducted yet on the immunomodulatory or immunotoxilogic effect of lornoxicam in camels. Therefore, the current study aimed to evaluate the immunomodulatory effects of the cyclooxygenase inhibitor lornoxicam on some phenotypic and functional properties of camel blood leukocytes; (2) Methods: Using flow cytometry, blood leukocyte composition, monocyte phenotype, and antimicrobial functions of neutrophils and monocytes were analyzed ex vivo after a single dose injection with lornoxicam. In addition, the effect of in vitro incubation of camel blood with lornoxicam on leukocyte cell vitality and antimicrobial functions were evaluated; (3) Results: The injection of camels with a single dose of lornoxicam resulted in a significant change in their leukogram with reduced numbers of total leukocytes, neutrophils, eosinophils, monocytes, and lymphocytes. Within the lymphocyte population, the numbers of CD4(+) T cells, γδ T cells, and B cells decreased significantly in blood after injection of camels with lornoxicam. In addition, injection of lornoxicam resulted in decreased abundance of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules and increased abundance of the scavenger receptor CD163 on blood monocytes, indicating an anti-inflammatory phenotype of monocytes. Functionally, administration of lornoxicam decreased the capacity of camel neutrophils and monocytes to uptake bacteria and to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) after bacterial stimulation. Similarly, the in vitro whole blood incubation with lornoxicam resulted in reduced phagocytosis and ROS production activity of the camel blood phagocytes. Flow cytometric analysis of cell vitality, including cell necrosis and apoptosis, revealed a pro-apoptotic effect of lornoxicam on camel leukocytes; (4) Conclusions: Lornoxicam administration, at the dose and intervals utilized herein, induces significant changes in the phenotype and function of camel blood leukocytes. The reduced cell numbers of all studied leukocyte subpopulations in lornoxicam-treated camels, which seems to be a result of enhanced cell apoptosis, indicates an inhibitory effect rather than a modulatory effect of lornoxicam on the camel immune system, which need to be considered when using lornoxicam in camel medicine.","Hussen, Jamal; Kandeel, Mahmoud; Shawaf, Turke; Al-Mubarak, Abdullah I.

Lack of preventive vaccines and rampant drug resistance phenomenon has rendered patients vulnerable. As new antimicrobials are in the preclinical stages of development, mining for the unexploited drug targets is also crucial. In the present study, we designed a B- and T-cell multi-epitope vaccine against P. aeruginosa using a subtractive proteomics and immunoinformatics approach. A total of five proteins were shortlisted based on essentiality, extracellular localization, virulence, antigenicity, pathway association, hydrophilicity, and low molecular weight. These include two outer membrane porins; OprF (P13794) and OprD (P32722), a protein activator precursor pra (G3XDA9), a probable outer membrane protein precursor PA1288 (Q9I456), and a conserved hypothetical protein PA4874 (Q9HUT9). These shortlisted proteins were further analyzed to identify immunogenic and antigenic B- and T-cell epitopes. The best scoring epitopes were then further subjected to the construction of a polypeptide multi-epitope vaccine and joined with cholera toxin B subunit adjuvant. The final chimeric construct was docked with TLR4 and confirmed by normal mode simulation studies. The designed B- and T-cell multi-epitope vaccine candidate is predicted immunogenic in nature and has shown strong interactions with TLR-4. Immune simulation predicted high-level production of B- and T-cell population and maximal expression was ensured in E. coli strain K12. The identified drug targets qualifying the screening criteria were: UDP-2-acetamido-2-deoxy-d-glucuronic acid 3-dehydrogenase WbpB (G3XD23), aspartate semialdehyde dehydrogenase (Q51344), 2-amino-4-hydroxy-6-hydroxymethyldihydropteridine pyrophosphokinase (Q9HV71), 3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonic-acid transferase (Q9HUH7), glycyl-tRNA synthetase alpha chain (Q9I7B7), riboflavin kinase/FAD synthase (Q9HVM3), aconitate hydratase 2 (Q9I2V5), probable glycosyltransferase WbpH (G3XD85) and UDP-3-O-[3-hydroxylauroyl] glucosamine N-acyltransferase (Q9HXY6). For druggability and pocketome analysis crystal and homology structures of these proteins were retrieved and developed. A sequence-based search was performed in different databases (ChEMBL, Drug Bank, PubChem and Pseudomonas database) for the availability of reported ligands and tested drugs for the screened targets. These predicted targets may provide a basis for the development of reliable antibacterial preventive and therapeutic options against P. aeruginosa.

Although SEM can determine relationships amongst unobserved constructs (i.e. independent, mediator, moderator, control and dependent variables), it is insufficient for providing non-compensatory relationships amongst constructs. In contrast with previous studies, a newly proposed methodology that involves a dual-stage analysis of SEM and ANN was performed to provide linear and non-compensatory relationships amongst constructs. Consequently, numerous distinct types of studies in diverse sectors have conducted hybrid SEM–ANN analysis. Accordingly, the current work supplements the academic literature with a systematic review that includes all major SEM–ANN techniques used in 11 industries published in the past 6 years. This study presents a state-of-the-art SEM–ANN classification taxonomy based on industries and compares the effort in various domains to that classification. To achieve this objective, we examined the Web of Science, ScienceDirect, Scopus and IEEE Xplore(®) databases to retrieve 239 articles from 2016 to 2021. The obtained articles were filtered on the basis of inclusion criteria, and 60 studies were selected and classified under 11 categories. This multi-field systematic study uncovered new research possibilities, motivations, challenges, limitations and recommendations that must be addressed for the synergistic integration of multidisciplinary studies. It contributed two points of potential future work resulting from the developed taxonomy. First, the importance of the determinants of play, musical and art therapy adoption amongst autistic children within the healthcare sector is the most important consideration for future investigations. In this context, the second potential future work can use SEM–ANN to determine the barriers to adopting sensing-enhanced therapy amongst autistic children to satisfy the recommendations provided by the healthcare sector. The analysis indicates that the manufacturing and technology sectors have conducted the most number of investigations, whereas the construction and small- and medium-sized enterprise sectors have conducted the least. This study will provide a helpful reference to academics and practitioners by providing guidance and insightful knowledge for future studies.","Albahri, A. S.; Alnoor, Alhamzah; Zaidan, A.

However, laparoscopic surgery for rectal cancer, particularly cancer of the lower rectum, is still challenging because of limited accessibility. Robotic surgery overcomes the limitations of laparoscopy associated with anatomy and offers certain advantages, including 3-D imaging, dexterity and ambidextrous capability, lack of tremors, motion scaling, and a short learning curve. Robotic rectal surgery has been reported to reduce conversion rates, particularly in low anterior resection, but it is associated with longer operative times than the conventional laparoscopic approach. Postoperative morbidities are similar between the robotic and conventional laparoscopic approaches, and oncological outcomes such as the quality of the mesorectum and the status of resection margins are also equivalent. The possible superiority of robotic surgery in terms of the preservation of autonomic function has yet to be established in research based on larger numbers of patients. Although robotic rectal surgery is safe, feasible, and appears to overcome some of the technical limitations associated with conventional laparoscopic surgery, the advantages provided by this technical innovation are currently limited. To justify its expensive cost, robotic surgery is more suitable for select patients, such as obese patients, men, those with cancer of the lower rectum, and those receiving preoperative chemoradiotherapy.","Nozawa, Hiroaki; Watanabe, Toshiaki",Asian journal of endoscopic surgery,105,1

Cannabidiol (CBD) has recently been proposed in the management of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) respiratory symptoms because of its anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory activity exerted in the lung. In this study, we demonstrated the in vitro PPAR-γ-dependent efficacy of CBD (10-9 -10-7 M) in preventing epithelial damage and hyperinflammatory response triggered by SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (SP) in a Caco-2 cells. Immunoblot analysis revealed that CBD was able to reduce all the analyzed proinflammatory markers triggered by SP incubation, such as tool-like receptor 4 (TLR-4), ACE-2, family members of Ras homologues A-GTPase (RhoA-GTPase), inflammasome complex (NLRP3), and Caspase-1. CBD caused a parallel inhibition of interleukin 1 beta (IL-1β), IL-6, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), and IL-18 by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) assay. By immunofluorescence analysis, we observed increased expression of tight-junction proteins and restoration of transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) following CBD treatment, as well as the rescue of fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-dextran permeability induced by SP. Our data indicate, in conclusion, that CBD is a powerful inhibitor of SP protein enterotoxicity in vitro.","Corpetti, Chiara; Del Re, Alessandro; Seguella, Luisa; Palenca, Irene; Rurgo, Sara; De Conno, Barbara; Pesce, Marcella; Sarnelli, Giovanni; Esposito, Giuseppe",Phytotherapy research : PTR,105,20

Anemia was defined as serum hemoglobin <12 g/dl in women or <13 g/dl in men in 2 large trials of patients with ACS. We plotted hazard functions for major bleeding at 30 days and all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, and stent thrombosis at 1 year according to baseline hemoglobin. Among 16,318 patients, 3070 (18.8%) had anemia at baseline. All-cause death at 1 year (2.9% vs 1.5%), major bleeding (7.6% vs 3.6%, p <0.001), and transfusions (6.7% vs 1.5%, p <0.001) were more common in patients with baseline anemia. Spline transformations of the hazard for adverse events as a function of hemoglobin level on admission showed that adverse outcomes increased in a nonlinear fashion with lower levels of baseline hemoglobin; the lowest rates were observed at a level of ∼14 g/dl. Baseline hemoglobin and anemia were independent predictors of major bleeding and death. In conclusion, in patients with ACS, baseline hemoglobin carries important independent prognostic information and demonstrates a nonlinear association with major bleeding and mortality.","Brener, Sorin J; Mehran, Roxana; Dangas, George D; Ohman, Edwin Magnus; Witzenbichler, Bernhard; Zhang, Yiran; Parvataneni, Rupa; Stone, Gregg W",The American journal of cardiology,105,29

We report on the initial descriptive study of the capacity for and quality of exchange of whole-panel, standardized quality measures from health systems. METHODS Family physicians were recruited from 4 health systems with mature quality measurement programs and agreed to submit standardized, physician-level quality measures for consenting physicians. Identified measure or transfer errors were captured and evaluated for root-cause problems. RESULTS The health systems varied considerably by patient demographics and payer mix. From the 4 systems, 256 family physicians elected to participate. Of 19 measures negotiated for use, 5 were used by all systems. There were more than 15 types of identified errors including breaks in data delivery, changes in measures, and nonsensical measure results. Only 1 system had no identified errors. CONCLUSIONS The secure transfer of standardized, physician-level quality measures from 4 health systems with mature measure processes proved difficult. There were many errors that required human intervention and manual repair, precluding full automation. This study reconfirms an important problem, namely, that despite widespread health information technology adoption and federal meaningful use policies, we remain far from goals to make clinical quality reporting a reliable by-product of care.","Phillips, Robert L; Peterson, Lars; Palen, Ted E; Fields, Scott A; Parchman, Michael L; Johannides, John",Annals of family medicine,105,29

We conducted an online survey (N = 1954) regarding individuals' perceptions and use of UGS and their SWB, evaluated through the short version of the Warwick-Edinburgh mental well-being scale. Multilevel mixed-effects regression analyses were performed to investigate the association between the frequency of UGS use and SWB, including individual and municipal level characteristics as covariates. Our results suggest that respondents who used UGS once or more per week during the pandemic reported higher SWB scores (8.7%) than those with zero visits. These findings have public policy implications that could enhance the role of UGS in urban environments during times of crisis.","Mayen Huerta, Carolina; Utomo, Ariane",Health & place,105,29

Anticipation of future reward, such as an upcoming vacation, can often be more gratifying than the experience itself. Theories suggest the utility of anticipation underpins various behaviors, ranging from beneficial information-seeking to harmful addiction. However, how neural systems compute anticipatory utility remains unclear. We analyzed the brain activity of human participants as they performed a task involving choosing whether to receive information predictive of future pleasant outcomes. Using a computational model, we show three brain regions orchestrate anticipatory utility. Specifically, ventromedial prefrontal cortex tracks the value of anticipatory utility, dopaminergic midbrain correlates with information that enhances anticipation, while sustained hippocampal activity mediates a functional coupling between these regions. Our findings suggest a previously unidentified neural underpinning for anticipation's influence over decision-making and unify a range of phenomena associated with risk and time-delay preference.","Iigaya, Kiyohito; Hauser, Tobias U; Kurth-Nelson, Zeb; O'Doherty, John P; Dayan, Peter; Dolan, Raymond J",Science advances,105,26

Metal artifact reduction has been successfully demonstrated in coil mass cases, but only in a small series. We attempted to objectively and subjectively evaluate the feasibility of metal artifact reduction with various metallic objects and coil lengths. MATERIALS AND METHODS We retrospectively reprocessed the flat detector CT data of 28 patients (15 men, 13 women; mean age, 55.6 years) after they underwent endovascular treatment (20 coiling ± stent placement, 6 liquid embolizers) or shunt drainage (n = 2) between January 2009 and November 2011 by using a metal artifact reduction correction algorithm. We measured CT value ranges and noise by using region-of-interest methods, and 2 experienced neuroradiologists rated the degrees of improved imaging quality and artifact reduction by comparing uncorrected and corrected images. RESULTS After we applied the metal artifact reduction algorithm, the CT value ranges and the noise were substantially reduced (1815.3 ± 793.7 versus 231.7 ± 95.9 and 319.9 ± 136.6 versus 45.9 ± 14.0; both P < .001) regardless of the types of metallic objects and various sizes of coil masses. The rater study achieved an overall improvement of imaging quality and artifact reduction (85.7% and 78.6% of cases by 2 raters, respectively), with the greatest improvement in the coiling group, moderate improvement in the liquid embolizers, and the smallest improvement in ventricular shunting (overall agreement, 0.857). CONCLUSIONS The metal artifact reduction algorithm substantially reduced artifacts and improved the objective image quality in every studied case. It also allowed improved diagnostic confidence in most cases.","Hung, S-C; Wu, C-C; Lin, C-J; Guo, W-Y; Luo, C-B; Chang, F-C; Chang, C-Y",AJNR. American journal of neuroradiology,105,16

METHODS Forty HCCs (22 iso-echoic and 18 unclear margin lesions) with mean diameters of 13.7 mm were treated using RFA under the guidance of fusion imaging with CEUS. The adequacy of RFA was evaluated using fusion imaging with CEUS 1 day after RFA. CECT or EOB-MRI was performed 1 month after RFA. We reviewed the images obtained using both modalities. RESULTS When the 1-month CECT or EOB-MRI scans were used as the reference standard, the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of the 1-day fusion imaging for the diagnosis of the adequate ablation of these HCCs were 97, 100, and 98%, respectively; the kappa value for the agreement between the findings using the two modalities was 0.655. CONCLUSION Fusion imaging with CEUS appears to be a useful method for the early evaluation of the efficacy of RFA for the treatment of HCCs with iso-echoic or unclear margins on conventional US.","Nishigori, Shuhei; Numata, Kazushi; Irie, Kuniyasu; Fukuda, Hiroyuki; Chuma, Makoto; Maeda, Shin",Journal of medical ultrasonics,105,16

METHODS We assessed the impact of diabetes mellitus on the outcomes of percutaneous coronary intervention for chronic total occlusion among 1308 people who underwent such procedures at 11 US centres between 2012 and 2015. RESULTS The participants' mean ± sd age was 66 ± 10 years, 84% of the participants were men and 44.6% had diabetes. As compared with participants without diabetes, participants with diabetes were more likely to have undergone coronary artery bypass graft surgery (38 vs 31%; P = 0.006), and to have had previous heart failure (35 vs 22%; P = 0.0001) and peripheral arterial disease (19 vs 13%; P = 0.002). They also had a higher BMI (31 ± 6 kg/m2 vs 29 ± 6 kg/m2 ; P = 0.001), similar Japanese chronic total occlusion scores (2.6 ± 1.2 vs 2.5 ± 1.2; P = 0.82) and similar final successful crossing technique: antegrade wire escalation (46 vs 47%; P = 0.66), retrograde (30 vs 28%; P = 0.66) and antegrade dissection re-entry (24 vs 25%; P = 0.66). Technical (91 vs 90%; P = 0.80) and procedural (89 vs 89%; P = 0.93) success was similar in the two groups, as was the incidence of major adverse cardiac events (2.2 vs 2.5%; P = 0.61).

Methods Cardiorespiratory signals obtained from overnight polysomnographic recordings of 28 children with SDB and 34 healthy nonsnoring children were analyzed. We employed an autoregressive closed-loop model with heart period (RR) and pulse transit time (PTT) as outputs and respiration as an external input to obtain estimates of respiratory gain and baroreflex gain. Results Mean and variability of PTT were increased in children with SDB across all stages of sleep. Low frequency power of RR and PTT were attenuated during non-rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Baroreflex sensitivity was reduced in children with SDB in stage 2 sleep, while respiratory gain was increased in slow wave sleep. After adenotonsillectomy, these indices normalized in the SDB group attaining values comparable to those of healthy children.

The objective of the current study, therefore, was to model the association between cow-level metabolic indicators and conceptus growth during early pregnancy (day 33-45 after AI) and to determine if an association (if present) is large enough to cause pregnancy loss. Metabolic indicators included milk production, changes in body weight and body condition score, parity, and concentrations of circulating hormones and metabolites (glucose, non-esterified fatty acids, growth hormone, IGF1, progesterone, and pregnancy-associated glycoproteins). One-hundred cows were enrolled. Cows that became pregnant with single conceptus pregnancies (n=53) weighed more (P<0.007) and had fewer uterine polymorphonuclear neutrophils (uterine health indicator; P<0.051) compared with cows that failed to become pregnant. The embryo and amniotic vesicle were measured by using ultrasound on day 33, 35, 38, 40, 42, and 45 of pregnancy. Most of the cow-level indicators that were included in the model of conceptus growth failed to achieve statistical significance. Day of pregnancy had the largest effect on conceptus growth (size and cross-sectional area of the embryo and amniotic vesicle; P<0.001). There were effects of sex of fetus (male fetuses larger than female), insulin (negative association), and body weigh change (positive association) on embryo length and cross-sectional area but these effects were small when compared with the range in conceptus length or area that we observed. The conclusion was that the capacity of the cow to become pregnant was associated with body weight and uterine health but we failed to find a large association with metabolic status on conceptus growth from day 33 to 45 of pregnancy in lactating dairy cows.","Stratman, T J; Moore, S G; Lamberson, W R; Keisler, D H; Poock, S E; Lucy, M C",Animal reproduction science,105,1

Tracheal allotransplantation maintains cartilage and epithelium viability but requires immunosuppression because of epithelial immunogenicity. We aimed to obtain an epithelium-decellularized allograft that maintains cartilage viability and to evaluate long-term outcomes of such allografts implanted on dog backs without immunosuppressants. METHODS Twenty-five tracheas harvested from mongrel dogs were used to explore the period of epithelium decellularization by combined use of 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate and an organ preservation solution and to assess the chondrocyte viability and immunogenicity of the tracheas after decellularization. Sixteen epithelium-decellularized tracheal allografts and 10 fresh tracheal segments (6 cm long) were implanted in 26 beagles for durations of 10 days and 1, 3, 6, and 12 months. Macroscopic and microscopic examinations were used to evaluate the morphology, viability, and immune rejection of the allografts. Safranin-O staining was used to detect glycosaminoglycans. RESULTS The epithelium disappeared after 24 hours of decellularization. At 72 hours, almost no nuclei remained in the mucosa, while the mean survival rate of chondrocytes was 88.1%. Histological analysis demonstrated that the allograft retained intact tracheal rings and viable cartilage after heterotopic implantation for 1 year, with no immunological rejection. There were no significant differences in the glycosaminoglycan contents among the implanted epithelium-decellularized allografts. CONCLUSIONS Epithelium-decellularized tracheal allografts with chondrocyte viability can be achieved by combined use of a detergent and organ preservation solution, which showed satisfactory cartilage viability and structural integrity after long-term heterotopic transplantation. Further studies on orthotopic transplantation are needed to assess the feasibility of allografts in reconstructing long segmental tracheal defects.","Cui, Pengcheng; Liu, Pengfei; Li, Shuqin; Ma, Ruina","The Annals of otology, rhinology, and laryngology",105,4

The aim of this study is to report how this situation forces surgeons to consider a nonoperative management as an alternative choice. This is a retrospective monocentric study and we collected data from 60 patients, splitted in two groups: info from Group A, 28 patients (March 11th to April 11th 2020) were compared with info from Group B, 32 patients (March 11th to April 11th 2019). The most relevant difference between the groups is related to patients clinical management. The two groups had a considerably different number of cases that were treated with an operative management: 18 cases (64,7%) in Group A vs 28 cases (87,5%) in Group B. Otherwise, non-perative approach occurred in 10 cases (35,7%) in group A and only in 4 patients (12,5%) in group B.

It finds that characteristics associated with NPI support vary widely by region, possibly because of cultural variation and prior experience, and that minority groups tend to be less supportive of NPIs when arrest is the consequence of noncompliance. Prior experience of face-mask usage also results in increased support for future usage, as well as other NPIs.

This study evaluated PROGRESS, a web-based intervention designed to improve adaptive coping among PCa survivors. METHODS Localized PCa patients (N=431) within one year of treatment completion were randomized to receive educational booklets or PROGRESS + educational booklets. Surveys completed at baseline, 1-, 3-, and 6-months assessed patient characteristics; functional quality of life and coping (primary outcomes); and psychosocial outcomes (e.g., self-efficacy, marital communication; secondary outcomes). Intent-to-treat and as-treated analyses were completed to assess change in outcomes from baseline to 6 months using linear mixed effects regression models. RESULTS In the intent-to-treat analyses, participants randomized to the intervention group had improved diversion coping (i.e., healthy redirection of worrying thoughts about their cancer), but more difficulties in marital communication (ps<.05). However, PROGRESS usage was low among those randomized to the intervention group (38.7%). The as-treated analyses found PROGRESS users reported fewer practical concerns but had worse positive coping compared to PROGRESS non-users (ps<.05). CONCLUSIONS The findings suggest PROGRESS may improve certain aspects of adaptive coping among PCa survivors that use the website, but does not adequately address the remaining coping and psychosocial domains. Additional research is needed to better understand the gaps in intervention delivery contributing to low engagement and poor improvement across all domains of functional quality of life and adaptive coping.

Hand trauma represents the most common acute emergency department presentation internationally. This study prospectively evaluates the COVID-19 related patient risk, when undergoing management within one of the largest specialist tertiary referral centres in Europe, which rapidly implemented national COVID-19 safety guidelines. MATERIALS AND METHODS A prospective cohort study was undertaken in all patients referred to the integrated hand trauma service, during the UK COVID-19 pandemic peak (April-May 2020); all were evaluated for 30-day COVID-19 related death. Random selection was undertaken for patients with hand trauma who either underwent non-operative (control group) or operative (surgery group) management; these groups were prospectively followed-up within a controlled cohort study design and telephoned at 30 days following first intervention (control group) or postoperatively (surgery group). RESULTS Of 731 referred patients (566 operations), there were no COVID-19 related deaths. Both groups were matched for sex, age, ethnicity, body mass index, comorbidities, smoking, preoperative/first assessment COVID-19 symptoms, pre- and postoperative/first assessment isolation and positive COVID-19 contact (p > 0.050). There were no differences in high service satisfaction (10/10 compared with 10/10; p = 0.067) and treatment outcome (10/10 compared with 10/10; p = 0.961) scores, postoperative/first assessment symptoms (1%, 1/100 compared with 0.8%, 2/250; p = 1.000) or proportion of positive tests (7.1%, 1/14 compared with 2.2%, 2/92; p = 0.349), between the control (n = 100) and surgery (n = 250) groups. CONCLUSION These data support continued and safe service provision and no increased risk to patients who require surgical management.

We previously showed that a single inducible phospholipase, PLA2G2D, is associated with a proresolving/antiinflammatory response in the lungs, and increases with age. Survival was increased in naive Pla2g2d-/- mice infected with SARS-CoV resulting from augmented respiratory dendritic cell (rDC) activation and enhanced priming of virus-specific T cells. Here, in contrast, we show that intranasal immunization provided no additional protection in middle-aged Pla2g2d-/- mice infected with any of the 3 pathogenic human coronaviruses because virtually no virus-specific antibodies or follicular helper CD4+ T (Tfh) cells were produced. Using MERS-CoV-infected mice, we found that these effects did not result from T or B cell intrinsic factors. Rather, they resulted from enhanced, and ultimately, pathogenic rDC activation, as manifested most prominently by enhanced IL-1β expression. Wild-type rDC transfer to Pla2g2d-/- mice in conjunction with partial IL-1β blockade reversed this defect and resulted in increased virus-specific antibody and Tfh responses. Together, these results indicate that PLA2G2D has an unexpected role in the lungs, serving as an important modulator of rDC activation, with protective and pathogenic effects in respiratory coronavirus infections and immunization, respectively.","Zheng, Jian; Meyerholz, David; Wong, Lok-Yin Roy; Gelb, Michael; Murakami, Makoto; Perlman, Stanley",The Journal of clinical investigation,105,1

DESIGN Network meta-analysis. DATA SOURCES Medline, Embase, and Cochrane CENTRAL up to 11 August 2020. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR SELECTING STUDIES Randomised controlled trials comparing SGLT-2 inhibitors or GLP-1 receptor agonists with placebo, standard care, or other glucose lowering treatment in adults with type 2 diabetes with follow up of 24 weeks or longer. Studies were screened independently by two reviewers for eligibility, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Frequentist random effects network meta-analysis was carried out and GRADE (grading of recommendations assessment, development, and evaluation) used to assess evidence certainty. Results included estimated absolute effects of treatment per 1000 patients treated for five years for patients at very low risk (no cardiovascular risk factors), low risk (three or more cardiovascular risk factors), moderate risk (cardiovascular disease), high risk (chronic kidney disease), and very high risk (cardiovascular disease and kidney disease). A guideline panel provided oversight of the systematic review. RESULTS 764 trials including 421 346 patients proved eligible. All results refer to the addition of SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists to existing diabetes treatment. Both classes of drugs lowered all cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and kidney failure (high certainty evidence). Notable differences were found between the two agents: SGLT-2 inhibitors reduced mortality and admission to hospital for heart failure more than GLP-1 receptor agonists, and GLP-1 receptor agonists reduced non-fatal stroke more than SGLT-2 inhibitors (which appeared to have no effect). SGLT-2 inhibitors caused genital infection (high certainty), whereas GLP-1 receptor agonists might cause severe gastrointestinal events (low certainty). Low certainty evidence suggested that SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists might lower body weight. Little or no evidence was found for the effect of SGLT-2 inhibitors or GLP-1 receptor agonists on limb amputation, blindness, eye disease, neuropathic pain, or health related quality of life. The absolute benefits of these drugs vary substantially across patients from low to very high risk of cardiovascular and renal outcomes (eg, SGLT-2 inhibitors resulted in 5 to 48 fewer deaths in 1000 patients over five years; see interactive decision support tool (https://magicevidence.org/match-it/200820dist/#!/) for all outcomes. CONCLUSIONS In patients with type 2 diabetes, SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists reduced cardiovascular and renal outcomes, with notable differences in benefits and harms.

The deregulated expression of microRNAs has been shown to aid classification of tumors and predict outcome in many tumors including breast PTs. The aim of our study is to investigate the clinical significance and prognostic value of microRNAs in PTs to identify a biomarker which has the potential for predicting prognosis and target therapy. METHODS Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was used to detect the expression level of microRNA20b in 123 breast PTs patients. The correlations between the expression of microRNA20b and clinicopathological parameters were investigated. The prognostic significance of microRNA20b was investigated by the Kaplan-Meier survival and Cox proportional hazards regression model. RESULTS The expression level of microRNA20b increased with the increase in the tumor grade (p < 0.05). High expression of microRNA20b correlated with stromal overgrowth, marked stromal cellularity, high atypia of stromal cells, infiltrative tumor margin, high mitotic activity, tumor grade, local recurrence and metastasis (p < 0.05). High expression of microRNA20b correlated with the shorter disease-free survival (DFS) (log-rank test, p < 0.001). Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that microRNA20b was an independent prognostic indicator for breast PTs patients. CONCLUSION The study demonstrated the promising potential of applying microRNA20b as a prognostic biomarker in PT patients.","Lei, Ting; Yin, Lijuan; Zhang, Hongying; Wei, Bing; Chen, Huijiao; Pu, Tianjie; Yang, Libo; Ye, Feng; Zhang, Zhang; Bu, Hong",International journal of clinical oncology,105,20

Nevus-resident CD4+ T helper 1 cells, which exhibited a massive clonal expansion to melanocyte-specific antigens, were responsible for nevus rejection. Boosting regulatory T cell suppressive function with low-dose exogenous human interleukin-2 injection or treatment with a human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II-blocking antibody prevented nevus rejection. Notably, mice with rejected nevus PDXs were protected from melanoma tumor growth. We detected a parallel CD4+ T cell-dominant immunity in clinically regressing melanocytic nevi. These findings reveal a mechanistic explanation for spontaneous nevus regression in humans and posit the activation of nevus-resident CD4+ effector T cells as a novel strategy for melanoma immunoprevention and treatment.","Schiferle, Erik B; Cheon, Se Yun; Ham, Seokjin; Son, Heehwa G; Messerschmidt, Jonathan L; Lawrence, Donald P; Cohen, Justine V; Flaherty, Keith T; Moon, James J; Lian, Christine G; Sullivan, Ryan J; Demehri, Shadmehr",Science advances,105,1

METHODS A comprehensive literature search was undertaken in the MEDLINE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and Scopus electronic databases. Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trials that assessed adverse events (AEs) with topical NSAIDs in patients with OA were eligible for inclusion. Authors and/or study sponsors were contacted to obtain the full report of AEs. The primary outcomes were overall severe and serious AEs, as well as the following MedDRA System Organ Class (SOC)-related AEs: gastrointestinal, vascular, cardiac, nervous system, skin and subcutaneous tissue, musculoskeletal and connective tissue. RESULTS The search strategy identified 1209 records, from which 25 papers were included in the qualitative synthesis and 19 were included in the meta-analysis, after exclusions. Overall, more total AEs (odds ratio [OR] 1.16, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.04-1.29; I2 = 0.0%) and more withdrawals due to AEs (OR 1.49, 95% CI 1.15-1.92; I2 = 0.0%) were observed with topical NSAIDs compared with placebo. The same results were achieved with topical diclofenac, largely driven by an increase in skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders (OR 1.73, 95% CI 0.96-3.10), although the difference was not statistically significant compared with placebo. No significant difference in the odds for gastrointestinal disorders was observed between topical NSAIDs and placebo (OR 0.96, 95% CI 0.73-1.27). CONCLUSIONS Topical NSAIDs may be considered safe in the management of OA, especially with regard to low gastrointestinal toxicity. The use of topical NSAIDs in OA should be considered, taking into account their risk: benefit profile in comparison with other anti-OA treatments.","Honvo, Germain; Leclercq, Victoria; Geerinck, Anton; Thomas, Thierry; Veronese, Nicola; Charles, Alexia; Rabenda, Véronique; Beaudart, Charlotte; Cooper, Cyrus; Reginster, Jean-Yves; Bruyère, Olivier",Drugs & aging,105,19

METHODS Ten consecutive patients suffering from a HRVF benefited from the described technique. Location and time frame were east of the Democratic Republic of Congo and September 2012 through January 2014. By laparoscopy, dissection of the mesorectum in the ""holy plane"" is taken posteriorly as distally on the sacrum as possible. Dissection subsequently continues laterally beyond the fistula in an effort to maximally circumvene the fistulous area where no plane of cleavage can be found. If the cleavage plane beyond the fistula addresses a healthy rectum, a suture of vaginal and rectal defect is performed. If the cleavage plane beyond the fistula involves significant laceration of the rectum, while leaving at least 2 cm of healthy rectum above the sphincter, rectal resection and colorectal anastomosis are performed. If the rectal laceration involves the distal 2 cm but halts short of the sphincter (large fistula), the pull-through technique is performed. RESULTS Of ten participants, four had large HRVF and two presented significant fibrosis. Three underwent simple suture of rectal and vaginal defect, one rectal resection and six a ""pull-through"" technique. The median procedure time was 1h50 (1h00-3h30). There was no morbidity. None of the patients required protective ileostomy or colostomy. Nine patients were declared clinically cured with a median follow-up of 14.3 months (11-36). The Cleveland Clinic Incontinence Score was 20 in all patients before the treatment and was significantly (p = 0.004) reduced to 2.6 [0-20] after the treatment. CONCLUSIONS This minimally invasive technique allowed us to treat HRVF, including complex ones in ten patients without significant morbidity.

Over the last few years, numerous mobile apps have been developed to challenge the brain with cognitive exercises; however, little is currently known about how age influences capacity for performance improvement when playing cognitive mobile games. OBJECTIVE The objective of this study was to analyze the score data of cognitive mobile games over a period of 100 gaming sessions to determine age-related learning ability for new cognitive tasks by measuring the level of score improvement achieved by participants of different ages. METHODS Scores from 9000 individuals of different ages for 7 cognitive mobile games over 100 gaming sessions were analyzed. Scores from the first session were compared between age groups using one-way analysis of variance. Mixed models were subsequently used to investigate the progression of scores over 100 sessions. RESULTS Statistically significant differences were found between age groups for the initial scores of 6 of the 7 games (linear trend, P<.001). Cognitive mobile game scores increased for all participants (P<.001) suggesting that all participants were able to improve their performance. The rate of improvement was, however, strongly influenced by the age of the participant with slower progression for older participants (P<.001). CONCLUSIONS This study provides evidence to support two interesting insights-cognitive mobile game scores appear to be sensitive to the changes in cognitive ability that occur with advancing age; therefore, these games could be a convenient way to monitor cognitive function over long-term follow-up, and users who train with the cognitive mobile games improve regardless of age.","Bonnechère, Bruno; Bier, Jean-Christophe; Van Hove, Olivier; Sheldon, Sally; Samadoulougou, Sékou; Kirakoya-Samadoulougou, Fati; Klass, Malgorzata",JMIR serious games,105,25

METHODS Retrospective cost data were collected from the accounting records of a single institution. A direct comparison of LC and SILC was conducted. Data on the SILC cases converted to LC were included. The total operating room (OR) cost (actual cost to the hospital for equipment, time, and personnel) and the total OR charges (total derived from the OR cost plus a margin to cover overhead costs beyond material costs) were examined. The total hospital charges (OR charges plus hospital charges accrued in the perioperative period) also were included. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze the data, with p values less than 0.05 considered statistically significant. RESULTS Over a period of 19 months, 116 cases of minimally invasive cholecystectomy were evaluated. Of the 116 patients, 48 underwent LC during the first half of that period, and 68 patients underwent SILC during the second half of that period. Nine of the single-incision procedures were converted to traditional LC, for a 13% conversion rate. The groups were well matched from a demographics standpoint, with no significant differences in age, gender, body mass index (BMI), diagnoses, American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA) class, or payment. Comparison of all attempted SILCs, including those converted, with all LCs showed no significant difference in cost category totals. A significant difference among all cost variables was found when SILCs were compared with SILCs that required conversion to LC. A significant difference among the cost variables also was found when LCs were compared with converted SILCs. CONCLUSION The cost for SILC did not differ significantly from that for LC when standard materials were used and the duration of the procedure was considered. Converted cases were significantly more expensive than completed SILC and LC cases.","Love, Katie M; Durham, Christopher A; Meara, Michael P; Mays, Ashley C; Bower, Curtis E",Surgical endoscopy,105,1

METHODS In a systematic literature search, we identified randomised controlled trials (RCTs) reporting on the efficacy of nurse-led follow-up on disease control in patients with RA compared with physician-led follow-up. Primary outcome was disease activity indicated by Disease Activity Score (DAS)-28. Secondary outcomes were: patient satisfaction, physical disability, fatigue, self-efficacy and quality of life. Outcomes were assessed after 1-year and 2 year follow-ups. RESULTS Seven studies representing five RCTs, including a total of 723 participants, were included. All but one study included stable patients in low disease activity or remission at baseline. No difference in DAS-28 was found after 1 year (mean difference (MD) -0.07 (95% CI -0.23 to 0.09)). After 2 years, a statistically significant difference was seen in favour of nurse-led follow-up (MD -0.28 (95% CI -0.53 to -0.04)). However, the difference did not reach a clinically relevant level. No difference was found in patient satisfaction after 1 year (standard mean difference (SMD) -0.17 (95 % CI -1.0 to 0.67), whereas a statistical significant difference in favour of nurse-led follow-up was seen after 2 years (SMD: 0.6 (95% CI -0.00 to 1.20)).

METHODOLOGY All patients confirmed as having COVID-19 between 23 January and 25 March 2020 by RT-PCR assay in the clinical lab of Shantou CDC were included and divided into three groups based on the source of identification: hospital diagnosis, contact tracing, and community screening. Collected data was analyzed and compared among these three groups. RESULTS A total of 25 COVID-19 cases were identified in Shantou. The first case was identified on 14 January 2020 at one of two COVID-19 dedicated hospitals in Shantou. The majority of the cases were either imported from Wuhan or linked to Wuhan/Hubei. The median lag time for diagnosis (i.e., the time between symptom onset and case confirmation) was 2 days (IQR, 2.0-4.0) for all cases, 9 days (IQR, 7.0-10.0) for the cases diagnosed in hospitals, 2 days (IQR, 1.5-2.0) for the cases in contact tracing, and 4 days (IQR, 2.5-4.5) for cases in community screening, with a significantly longer diagnosis lag time in hospitals (p = 0.003). Multivariate linear regression models showed larger family size and severe cases as the significant predictor for increasing number of close contacts. CONCLUSIONS The current pandemic appears to exist for an uncertain period. The early containment measures applied in Shantou, a city with insufficient healthcare resources for COVID-19, seems to be appropriate for cities or areas with similar profiles.","Zhang, Xubin; Zhang, Dangui; Zhang, Chi; Yao, Lijun; Xu, Lu; Chen, Gengna; Liao, Zhaohui; Zhu, Xunyi; Yang, Wenda; Li, Weinan",Journal of infection in developing countries,105,1

However, few studies have focused on AKI treated with RRT (AKI-RRT). METHODS We conducted a multicenter cohort study of 3099 critically ill adults with COVID-19 admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) at 67 hospitals across the United States. We used multivariable logistic regression to identify patient-and hospital-level risk factors for AKI-RRT and to examine risk factors for 28-day mortality among such patients. RESULTS A total of 637 of 3099 patients (20.6%) developed AKI-RRT within 14 days of ICU admission, 350 of whom (54.9%) died within 28 days of ICU admission. Patient-level risk factors for AKI-RRT included CKD, men, non-White race, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, higher body mass index, higher d-dimer, and greater severity of hypoxemia on ICU admission. Predictors of 28-day mortality in patients with AKI-RRT were older age, severe oliguria, and admission to a hospital with fewer ICU beds or one with greater regional density of COVID-19. At the end of a median follow-up of 17 days (range, 1-123 days), 403 of the 637 patients (63.3%) with AKI-RRT had died, 216 (33.9%) were discharged, and 18 (2.8%) remained hospitalized. Of the 216 patients discharged, 73 (33.8%) remained RRT dependent at discharge, and 39 (18.1%) remained RRT dependent 60 days after ICU admission. CONCLUSIONS AKI-RRT is common among critically ill patients with COVID-19 and is associated with a hospital mortality rate of >60%. Among those who survive to discharge, one in three still depends on RRT at discharge, and one in six remains RRT dependent 60 days after ICU admission.","Gupta, Shruti; Coca, Steven G; Chan, Lili; Melamed, Michal L; Brenner, Samantha K; Hayek, Salim S; Sutherland, Anne; Puri, Sonika; Srivastava, Anand; Leonberg-Yoo, Amanda; Shehata, Alexandre M; Flythe, Jennifer E; Rashidi, Arash; Schenck, Edward J; Goyal, Nitender; Hedayati, S Susan; Dy, Rajany; Bansal, Anip; Athavale, Ambarish; Nguyen, H Bryant; Vijayan, Anitha; Charytan, David M; Schulze, Carl E; Joo, Min J; Friedman, Allon N; Zhang, Jingjing; Sosa, Marie Anne; Judd, Eric; Velez, Juan Carlos Q; Mallappallil, Mary; Redfern, Roberta E; Bansal, Amar D; Neyra, Javier A; Liu, Kathleen D; Renaghan, Amanda D; Christov, Marta; Molnar, Miklos Z; Sharma, Shreyak; Kamal, Omer; Boateng, Jeffery Owusu; Short, Samuel A P; Admon, Andrew J; Sise, Meghan E; Wang, Wei; Parikh, Chirag R; Leaf, David E",Journal of the American Society of Nephrology : JASN,105,31

Self-reported outcomes are cost-effective; however, they are subject to error. Diagnosis of silent events may also occur through the use of imperfect laboratory-based diagnostic tests. In this paper, we describe an approach for variable selection in high dimensional datasets for settings in which the outcome is observed with error. METHODS We adapt the spike and slab Bayesian Variable Selection approach in the context of error-prone, self-reported outcomes. The performance of the proposed approach is studied through simulation studies. An illustrative application is included using data from the Women's Health Initiative SNP Health Association Resource, which includes extensive genotypic (>900,000 SNPs) and phenotypic data on 9,873 African American and Hispanic American women. RESULTS Simulation studies show improved sensitivity of our proposed method when compared to a naive approach that ignores error in the self-reported outcomes. Application of the proposed method resulted in discovery of several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are associated with risk of type 2 diabetes in a dataset of 9,873 African American and Hispanic participants in the Women's Health Initiative. There was little overlap among the top ranking SNPs associated with type 2 diabetes risk between the racial groups, adding support to previous observations in the literature of disease associated genetic loci that are often not generalizable across race/ethnicity populations. The adapted Bayesian variable selection algorithm is implemented in R. The source code for the simulations are available in the Supplement. CONCLUSIONS Variable selection accuracy is reduced when the outcome is ascertained by error-prone self-reports. For this setting, our proposed algorithm has improved variable selection performance when compared to approaches that neglect to account for the error-prone nature of self-reports.","Gu, Xiangdong; Tadesse, Mahlet G; Foulkes, Andrea S; Ma, Yunsheng; Balasubramanian, Raji",BMC medical informatics and decision making,105,1

Neck circumference is a simple and low-cost measure that can estimate this risk precociously. OBJECTIVE To evaluate whether the cardiovascular risk obtained by Neck Circumference (NC) is associated with the main cardiometabolic risk factors in patients on hemodialysis treatment on waiting list for transplantation. METHODS cross-sectional study including 96 patients in a single transplantation center. Sociodemographic, clinical-laboratory and anthropometric data were collected. NC was considered as a dependent variable and the independent variables were body mass index (BMI), biochemical tests of fasting glycemia and lipid profile, triglyceride ratio and high density lipoprotein cholesterol (TGL / HDL-C) and triglyceride Index and glycemia (TyG). For the comparison of averages, we used the Mann Whitney and Students t Tests, as well as the one-way ANOVA and Kruskal Wallis tests. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression was performed for the association between NC and cardiometabolic risk factors. A significance level of 5% was assumed. RESULTS There were higher BMI averages, blood glucose, triglycerides (TGL), TGL/HDL-C ratio and TyG index in the tertile 3 of the NC, whereas the HDL-c decreased as the tertile increased. There was a statistically significant risk of cardiovascular disease, according to NC, with overweight, high levels of TGL, TGL/HDL-c, TyG index, and low HDL-c.

BACKGROUND Short-term symptomatic results of LPHR are often excellent. However, a high recurrence rate is detected at objective radiographic follow-up. METHODS Retrospective review of a prospectively gathered database of consecutive patients undergoing LPHR with and without reinforced crural repair at a single institution. Subjective and objective outcomes were assessed by using a structured symptoms questionnaire, Gastrointestinal Quality-of-Life Index, satisfaction score, and barium esophagogram. RESULTS From September 1991 to September 2005, LPHR was performed in 85 patients (median age, 66 years) with (25 patients) and without (60 patients) reinforced crural repair. Two patients (3%) underwent laparoscopic reoperation, for severe dysphagia and for symptomatic recurrence, respectively. Subjective outcome, available for 64 patients (75%), improved significantly at median follow-up of 118 months with a postoperative median Gastrointestinal Quality-of-Life Index score of 116. Radiographic recurrence (median follow-up, 99 months) occurred in 23 (66%) of the 35 patients, independently of age at operation, type of paresophageal hiatal hernias, and crural reinforcement, and showed no impact on quality of life. CONCLUSIONS Although providing excellent symptomatic results, long-term objective evaluation of LPHR reveals a high recurrence rate even with reinforced cruroplasty. A tailored, lengthening gastroplasty and reinforced cruroplasty based on objective intraoperative evaluation, and not only on surgeon's personal judgment, may be the answer to recurrences.","Dallemagne, Bernard; Kohnen, Laurent; Perretta, Silvana; Weerts, Joseph; Markiewicz, Serge; Jehaes, Constant",Annals of surgery,105,30

We apply a biological anthropological approach to examine how ecological sensing has been shaped by these stimuli through human evolution for complex interkingdom communication between a host and pathological and symbiotic bacteria, focusing on population-specific genetic diversity. We then focus on how these sensory receptors play a major role in inflammatory processes that form the basis of many modern common metabolic diseases such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, and aging.

Although some variation is expected, unwarranted variation in healthcare impacts patient outcomes and equity of care. The aim of this systematic review was to: i) summarise current evidence on regional and inter-hospital variation in the clinical outcomes and process of care measures of patients hospitalised with CAP and ii) assess the strength of this evidence. Methods Databases were systematically searched from inception to February 2018 for relevant studies and data independently extracted by two investigators in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) statement. Included studies enrolled adults hospitalised with CAP and reported a measure of variation between two or more units in healthcare outcomes or process of care measures. Outcomes of interest were mortality, length of hospital stay (LOS) and re-admission rates. A structured synthesis of the studies was performed. Results Twenty-two studies were included in the analysis. The median number of units compared across studies was five (IQR 4-15). Evidence for variation in mortality between units was inconsistent; of eleven studies that performed statistical significance testing, five found significant variation. For LOS, of nine relevant studies, all found statistically significant variation. Four studies reported site of admission accounted for 1-24% of the total observed variation in LOS. A shorter LOS was not associated with increased mortality or readmission rates. For readmission, evidence was mixed; of seven studies, 4 found statistically significant variation. There was consistent evidence for variation in the use of intensive care, obtaining blood cultures on admission, receiving antibiotics within 8 h of admission and duration of intravenous antibiotics. Across all outcome measures, only one study accounted for natural variation between units in their analysis. Conclusion There is consistent evidence of moderate quality for significant variation in length of stay and process of care measures but not for in-patient mortality or hospital re-admission. Evidence linking variation in outcomes with variation in process of care measures was limited; where present no difference in mortality was detected despite POC variation. Adjustment for natural variation within studies was lacking; the proportion of observed variation due to chance is not quantified by existing evidence.","Lawrence, H; Lim, W S; McKeever, T M",Pneumonia,105,7

Interconnections between multiple values nested within four domains of value, i.e. environmental, economic, technical and social, mean that changes in the one domain (in the co-firing case, the technical one) can have considerable implications in the other domains as well. In this study, using a systematic and flexible approach to conceptualising multi-dimensional aspects associated with the co-firing of biomass and SRF with coal, we unveil examples of such interconnections and implications on overall value delivered through the use and recovery of waste resources. Such an analysis could underpin the selection of useful metrics (quantitative or semi-quantitative descriptors) for enabling a systemic multi-dimensional value assessment, and value's distribution amongst interconnected parts of resource recovery systems; key in enabling sound analysis and decision-making.","Iacovidou, Eleni; Hahladakis, John; Deans, Innes; Velis, Costas; Purnell, Phil",Waste management,105,16

Nasal epithelial cells are an important site for SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication. The purpose of this review is to summarize recent findings on the endotypes of chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) and the potential impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection. RECENT FINDINGS Endotypes of CRSwNP are characterized by type 1, type 2 and type 3 inflammation according to patterns of inflammatory cells and the cytokines expressed in nasal tissue. Nasal epithelial cells show the highest expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the receptor for attachment and entry of SARS-CoV-2 into host cells, among all investigated cells in the respiratory tree. SARS-CoV-2 infection likely leads to increased activation of T-helper-1 (Th1) cell responses. Recent studies further suggest that ACE2 may be upregulated by type 1 and downregulated by type 2 inflammatory cytokines in nasal epithelial cells. SUMMARY Expression of ACE2 in nasal epithelial cells is influenced by inflammatory endotypes of CRSwNP. Type 1 inflammation in nasal tissue may increase the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection by upregulating ACE2 expression. However, clinical association between CRSwNP and COVID-19 is still unclear.","Wang, Ming; Wang, Chengshuo; Zhang, Luo",Current opinion in allergy and clinical immunology,105,31

The behavior of the resulting systems-level model was tested for fit against reference behavior data. After the base model was tested, logic to represent three educational interventions was added and the impact of each intervention on simulated overdose deaths was evaluated over a 7-year evaluation period, 2008 to 2015. Principal findings were that a prescriber education intervention not only reduced total overdose deaths in the model but also reduced the total number of persons who receive opioid analgesic therapy, medical user education not only reduced overdose deaths among medical users but also resulted in increased deaths from nonmedical use, and a ""popularity"" intervention sharply reduced overdose deaths among nonmedical users while having no effect on medical use.

METHODS Ten online focus groups with 61 adults from the Atlanta, GA area were held in October-November 2020: four with exclusive smokers (n=16), three with Electronic Nicotine Delivery System (ENDS) users (dual and exclusive, n=22), and three with transitioning (recently quit or currently quitting) smokers and/or ENDS users (n=23). RESULTS Exclusive smokers reported smoking more frequently, driven by COVID-19-related stress, time at home, and boredom. They were not motivated to quit during the pandemic, and some considered smoking to be protective against COVID-19. ENDS users reported vaping less, with dual users often increasing their smoking; many were concerned about health effects of smoking and ENDS use during the pandemic. Transitioning smokers/ENDS users worried about their health and wanted to quit, but many found the stress of COVID-19 unbearable without tobacco use. CONCLUSIONS There were some similarities among the groups, but also pronounced differences. Educational campaigns should capitalize on the teachable moment of COVID-19 to increase perceived risk of smoking. Smokers need access to more adaptive ways to deal with stress (such as mindfulness training) in lieu of smoking and systems-level approaches should address structural determinants of health that cause high levels of stress. The proposed policy to lower nicotine in combusted tobacco products might help smokers choose other means of coping instead of cigarettes by reducing the stress-relieving properties of smoking particularly salient during the pandemic. IMPLICATIONS Smokers believe that cigarettes help them deal with the stresses and challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. This needs to be counteracted by educational campaigns to increase perceived harm of smoking, alternative stress-relief strategies, and mandated changes to the combusted tobacco products to make them less appealing.","Popova, Lucy; Henderson, Katherine; Kute, Nikita; Singh-Looney, Manu; Ashley, David L; Reynolds, Reed M; Nayak, Pratibha; Spears, Claire Adams",Nicotine & tobacco research : official journal of the Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco,105,5

The aim of the present study was to investigate PTSD, Burnout and global functioning in a sample of emergency healthcare workers (HCWs) of a major University Hospital of Italy, exploring possible correlations between the two constructs. METHODS The study sample included 137 medical and nursing Emergency Room and Intensive Care Unit staff of a major University Hospital in Italy (Pisa), all assessed by means of the Trauma and Loss Spectrum-Self Report (TALS-SR), for post-traumatic stress spectrum, the Professional Quality of Life Scale - Revision IV (ProQOL R-IV), for Burnout related to work activities, and the Work and Social Adjustment Scale (WSAS), for global functioning. RESULTS Fourty-nine subjects reported a full (18, 14.3%) or partial (31, 24.6%) symptomatological DSM-5 PTSD. HCWs with PTSD reported significantly higher Burnout scores and global functioning impairment compared to those without PTSD. Mean to good significant correlations emerged between the TALS-SR total and domains scores, the ProQOL subscales and the WSAS scores. CONCLUSIONS This work, conducted before the COVID-19 pandemic, underlines a positive correlation between Burnout and Post-Traumatic Stress Spectrum symptoms in Emergency HCWs, showing the need for a deeper assessment of work-related posttraumatic stress symptoms in such population in order to improve the well-being and to prevent Burnout.","Carmassi, Claudia; Malacarne, Paolo; Dell'Oste, Valerio; Bertelloni, Carlo A; Cordone, Annalisa; Foghi, Claudia; Dell'Osso, Liliana",Minerva anestesiologica,105,1

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus responsible for the 2020 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and pandemic, is present in 215 countries, and is described as a pathogen that is most deadly to individuals 65 years and older. However, it is unclear if the majority of COVID-19-related deaths are targeting individuals above or below life expectancy. Methods Through seven months of the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, an association between life expectancy and COVID-19 related deaths was assessed. The reported age of those suffering from COVID-19-related deaths was evaluated across eight countries (United States, Germany, Italy, Hungary, Poland, South Africa, Sweden, and Switzerland), and placed into binary categories depending on whether or not the death occurred above or below the country's life expectancy. Results Given this dataset, it was observed that there was a greater proportion of COVID related deaths above life expectancy (M=64.58%, SD=6.46) as opposed to below life expectancy (M=35.41%, SD=6.46), as these differences were significant (95%CI [18.518, 42.881], p<0.001). In contrast, an insignificant trend was observed when examining the relationship between deaths above life expectancy and Gini index (Pearson correlation coefficient r= -0.62, n=8, p=0.09). The disparity, or percent difference in death occurring above versus below life expectancy was greatest in the countries with life expectancies of 80+ (Sweden, Switzerland, Germany). Conclusions Considering life expectancy may be an appropriate approach for reporting COVID-19-related deaths, as well as planning responses to localized COVID-19 outbreaks, prioritizing drug treatment, and assessing ICU capacity.","Malik, Rondy J",Germs,105,19

In the present study, we investigated the effects of one native opioid peptide, opioid growth factor ([Met(5)]-enkephalin), on the onset and progression of EAE. C57Bl/6 mice injected with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) received daily injections of 10 mg/kg OGF (MOG+OGF) or saline (MOG+Vehicle). Over 60% of the MOG+OGF animals did not exhibit behavioral signs of disease (EAE) in contrast to 100% of the mice in the MOG+Vehicle group. The severity and disease indices of EAE in the OGF-treated mice were markedly reduced from MOG+Vehicle cohorts. By day 30, 60% of MOG+OGF mice had a remission, relative to 4% in the MOG+Vehicle group. MOG-injected mice receiving OGF had significant reductions in activated astrocytes and damaged neurons compared to MOG+Vehicle animals. Unlike MOG+Vehicle and MOG+OGF mice with behavioral signs of disease, MOG+OGF animals without manifestation of disease had no lumbar spinal cord demyelination. Both OGF and OGF receptor were detected in splenic-derived T lymphocytes by immunohistochemistry. OGF treatment decreased both DNA synthesis and cell proliferation in comparison to vehicle-treated T cell lymphocyte cultures. These results indicate that an endogenous opioid, OGF, inhibits the onset and progression of EAE, and suggest that clinical studies on the use of OGF treatment for MS are merited.","Zagon, Ian S; Rahn, Kristen A; Bonneau, Robert H; Turel, Anthony P; McLaughlin, Patricia J",Brain research,105,1

METHODS Clinical procedures were simulated in cadaveric heads whose oral and nasal cavities were coated with fluorescent tracer (vitamin B2) and breathing was manually simulated through retrograde intubation. A cascade impactor placed adjacent to the nares collected generated particles with aerodynamic diameters ≤14.1 µm. The 3D printed models and syringes were used to simulate middle and external ear suctioning as well as open suctioning, respectively. Provider's personal protective equipment (PPE) and procedural field contamination were also recorded for all trials using vitamin B2 fluorescent tracer. RESULTS The positive controls of nebulized vitamin B2 produced aerosol particles ≤3.30 µm and endonasal drilling of a 3D model generated particles ≤14.1 µm. As compared with positive controls, aerosols and small droplets with aerodynamic diameter ≤14.1 µm were not detected during rigid nasal endoscopy, flexible fiberoptic laryngoscopy, and rigid nasal suction of cadavers with simulated breathing. There was minimal to no field contamination in all 3 scenarios. Middle and external ear suctioning and open container suctioning did not result in any detectable droplet contamination. The clinic suction unit contained all fluorescent material without surrounding environmental contamination. CONCLUSION While patients' coughing and sneezing may create a baseline risk for providers, this study demonstrates that nasal endoscopy, flexible laryngoscopy, and suctioning inherently do not pose an additional risk in terms of aerosol and small droplet generation. An overarching generalization cannot be made about endoscopy or suctioning being an aerosol generating procedure.

Acute viral bronchiolitis is associated with airway obstruction and turbulent gas flow. Heliox, a mixture of oxygen and the inert gas helium, may improve gas flow through high-resistance airways and decrease the work of breathing. In this review, we selected trials that objectively assessed the effect of the addition of heliox to standard medical care for acute bronchiolitis. OBJECTIVES To assess heliox inhalation therapy in addition to standard medical care for acute bronchiolitis in infants with respiratory distress, as measured by clinical endpoints (in particular the rate of endotracheal intubation, the rate of emergency department discharge, the length of treatment for respiratory distress) and pulmonary function testing (mainly clinical respiratory scores). SEARCH METHODS We searched CENTRAL (2015, Issue 2), MEDLINE (1966 to March week 3, 2015), EMBASE (1974 to March 2015), LILACS (1982 to March 2015) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) website (May 2009). SELECTION CRITERIA Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs of heliox in infants with acute bronchiolitis. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed trial quality. MAIN RESULTS We included seven trials involving 447 infants younger than two years with respiratory distress secondary to viral bronchiolitis. All children were recruited from a paediatric intensive care unit (PICU; 378 infants), except in one trial (emergency department; 69 infants). All children were younger than two (under nine months in two trials and under three months in one trial). Positive tests for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) were required for inclusion in five trials. The two other trials were carried out in the bronchiolitis seasons. Seven different protocols were used for inhalation therapy with heliox.When heliox was used in the PICU, we observed no significant reduction in the rate of intubation: risk ratio (RR) 2.73 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.96 to 7.75, four trials, 408 infants, low quality evidence). When heliox inhalation was used in the emergency department, we observed no increase in the rate of discharge: RR 0.51 (95% CI 0.17 to 1.55, one trial, 69 infants, moderate quality evidence).There was no decrease in the length of treatment for respiratory distress: mean difference (MD) -0.19 days (95% CI -0.56 to 0.19, two trials, 320 infants, moderate quality evidence). However, in the subgroup of infants who were started on nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP) right from the start, because of severe respiratory distress, heliox therapy reduced the length of treatment: MD -0.76 days (95% CI -1.45 to -0.08, one trial, 21 infants, low quality evidence). No adverse events related to heliox inhalation were reported.We found that infants treated with heliox inhalation had a significantly lower mean clinical respiratory score in the first hour after starting treatment when compared to those treated with air or oxygen inhalation: MD -1.04 (95% CI -1.60 to -0.48, four trials, 138 infants, moderate quality evidence). This outcome had statistical heterogeneity, which remained even after removing the study using a standard high-concentration reservoir mask. Several factors may explain this heterogeneity, including first the limited number of patients in each trial, and the wide differences in the baseline severity of disease between studies, with the modified Wood Clinical Asthma Score (m-WCAS) in infants treated with heliox ranging from less than two to more than seven. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS Current evidence suggests that the addition of heliox therapy may significantly reduce a clinical score evaluating respiratory distress in the first hour after starting treatment in infants with acute RSV bronchiolitis. We noticed this beneficial effect regardless of which heliox inhalation protocol was used. Nevertheless, there was no reduction in the rate of intubation, in the rate of emergency department discharge, or in the length of treatment for respiratory distress. Heliox could reduce the length of treatment in infants requiring CPAP for severe respiratory distress. Further studies with homogeneous logistics in their heliox application are needed. Inclusion criteria must include a clinical severity score that reflects severe respiratory distress to avoid inclusion of children with mild bronchiolitis who may not benefit from heliox inhalation. Such studies would provide the necessary information as to the appropriate place for heliox in the therapeutic schedule for severe bronchiolitis.","Liet, Jean-Michel; Ducruet, Thierry; Gupta, Vineet; Cambonie, Gilles",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,105,33

While this practice has improved livestock production, it is a major cause of antimicrobial resistance in microbes affecting livestock and humans. This has led to the banning of prophylactic antibiotic use in animals in many countries. To compensate for this, alternatives have been sought from natural sources such as plants. While many studies have reported the antimicrobial activity of medicinal plants with potential for use as phytogenic/botanical feed additives, little information exists on their mode of action. This study is based on our earlier work and describes ultrastructural damage induced by acetone crude leaf extracts of Syzygium legatii and Eugenia zeyheri (Myrtaceae) active against diarrhoeagenic E. coli of swine origin using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and fluorescent microscopy (FM). Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was used to investigate the chemical composition of plant extracts. RESULTS The extracts damaged the internal and external anatomy of the cytoplasmic membrane and inner structure at a concentration of 0.04 mg/mL. Extracts also led to an increased influx of propidium iodide into treated bacterial cells suggesting compromised cellular integrity and cellular damage. Non-polar compounds such as α-amyrin, friedelan-3-one, lupeol, and β-sitosterol were abundant in the extracts. CONCLUSIONS The extracts of S. legatii and E. zeyheri caused ultrastructural damage to E. coli cells characterized by altered external and internal morphology. These observations may assist in elucidating the mode of action of the extracts.","Famuyide, Ibukun M; Fasina, Folorunso O; Eloff, Jacobus N; McGaw, Lyndy J",BMC veterinary research,105,16

During general anesthesia, isoflurane in contrast to sevoflurane has been associated with increased fluid extravasation and edema generation. In this study, we tested sevoflurane against isoflurane with focus on vascular compliance and fluid shifts in an experimental cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) model. METHODS Sixteen pigs underwent 120 min of cardiopulmonary bypass with isoflurane or sevoflurane anesthesia. Net fluid balance, plasma volume, serum-electrolytes, serum-albumin, serum-protein, colloid osmotic pressures in plasma and interstitial fluid, hematocrit levels, and total tissue water content were recorded. Intra-abdominal and intracranial pressures were measured directly, and fluid extravasation rates were calculated. RESULTS Fluid extravasation rate increased dramatically in both groups during initiation of cardiopulmonary bypass, with no group differences. The animals of the sevoflurane group needed significantly more fluid supplementation to maintain a constant reservoir volume in the CPB circuit during bypass. Plasma volumes prior to bypass were 56.5 ± 7.9 ml/kg (mean ± SD) and 58.7 ± 3.8 ml/kg in the isoflurane group and sevoflurane group, respectively. During bypass, plasma volumes in the isoflurane group decreased about 25%, and remained significantly lowered when compared to the sevoflurane group, where the values remained stable. CONCLUSIONS No differences in fluid extravasation rates were observed between sevoflurane and isoflurane. The increased net fluid balance in the sevoflurane group during cardiopulmonary bypass was not associated with edema generation. Plasma volume was retained in the sevoflurane group, in contrast to the isoflurane group.","Svendsen, Ø S; Elvevoll, B; Mongstad, A; Stangeland, L B; Kvalheim, V L; Husby, P",Acta anaesthesiologica Scandinavica,105,5

The increasing worldwide incidence of both asthma and obesity over the last few decades, their current high prevalence and the challenges in treating obese asthmatic patients all highlight the importance of a better understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms in obese asthma. While it is well established that patients with obesity are at an increased risk of developing asthma, the mechanisms by which obesity drives the onset of asthma, and modifies existing asthma, remain unclear. Here, we will focus on mechanisms by which obesity alters immune function in asthma. RECENT FINDINGS Lung parenchyma has an altered structure in some pediatric obese asthmatics, known as dysanapsis. Central adiposity is linked to reduced pulmonary function and a better predictor of asthma risk in children than BMI. Obesity in young children is associated with an increased risk of developing asthma, as well as early puberty, and hormonal alterations are implicated in obese asthma. Obesity and asthma each yield immunometabolic dysregulation separately and we are learning more about alterations in these pathways in pediatric obese asthma and the potential impact of bariatric surgery on those processes. SUMMARY The recent progress in clarifying the connections between childhood obesity and asthma and their combined impacts on immune function moves us closer to the goals of improved understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms underpinning obese asthma and improved therapeutic target selection. However, this common inflammatory disease remains understudied, especially in children, and much remains to be learned.","Hay, Ceire; Henrickson, Sarah E",Current opinion in allergy and clinical immunology,105,33

To minimize the spread of contaminated air exhaled by occupants efficiently, a novel personalized ventilation (PV)-personalized exhaust (PE) system has been developed, which aims to exhaust the exhaled air as much as possible from around the infected person (IP). The PV-PE system was studied experimentally for a particular healthcare setting based on a typical consultation room geometry and four different medical consultation positions of an IP and a healthy person (HP). Experiments using two types of tracer gases were conducted to evaluate two types of PE: Top-PE and Shoulder-PE under two different background ventilation systems: Mixing Ventilation and Displacement Ventilation. Personalized exposure effectiveness, intake fraction (iF) and exposure reduction (ε) were used as indices to evaluate the PV-PE system. The results show that the combined PV-PE system for the HP achieves the lowest intake fraction; and the use of PE system for the IP alone shows much better performance than using PV system for the HP alone.","Yang, J; Sekhar, S C; Cheong, K W D; Raphael, B",Indoor air,105,20

While short-term chondrocyte viability and chondrosupportive matrix modification have been demonstrated within tissue contiguous to targeted removal of damaged articular cartilage, longer term tissue responses require evaluation to further clarify treatment efficacy. The purpose of this study was to examine surface chondrocyte responses within contiguous tissue after lesion stabilization. METHODS Nonablation radiofrequency lesion stabilization of human cartilage explants obtained during knee replacement was performed for surface fibrillation. Time-dependent chondrocyte viability, nuclear morphology and cell distribution, and temporal response kinetics of matrix and chaperone gene transcription indicative of differentiated chondrocyte function were evaluated in samples at intervals to 96 hours after treatment. RESULTS Subadjacent surface articular cartilage chondrocytes demonstrated continued viability for 96 hours after treatment, a lack of increased nuclear fragmentation or condensation, persistent nucleic acid production during incubation reflecting cellular assembly behavior, and transcriptional up-regulation of matrix and chaperone genes indicative of retained biosynthetic differentiated cell function. CONCLUSIONS The results of this study provide further evidence of treatment efficacy and suggest the possibility to manipulate or induce cellular function, thereby recruiting local chondrocytes to aid lesion recovery. Early surgical intervention may be viewed as a tissue rescue, allowing articular cartilage to continue displaying biological responses appropriate to its function rather than converting to a tissue ultimately governed by the degenerative material property responses of matrix failure. Early intervention may positively impact the late changes and reduce disease burden of damaged articular cartilage.","Ganguly, Kumkum; McRury, Ian D; Goodwin, Peter M; Morgan, Roy E; Augé, Wayne K",Cartilage,105,31

Recent advances in single-cell technologies provide an unrestricted, high-resolution view of fibroblast heterogeneity that exists within and across tissues. In this review, we summarize a compendium of single-cell transcriptomic studies and provide a comprehensive accounting of fibroblast subsets, many of which have been described to occupy specific niches in tissues at homeostatic and pathologic states. Understanding this heterogeneity is particularly important in the context of cancer, as the diverse cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF) phenotypes in the tumor microenvironment (TME) are directly impacted by the expression phenotypes of their predecessors. Relationships between these heterogeneous populations often accompany and influence response to therapy in cancer and fibrosis. We further highlight the importance of integrating single-cell studies to deduce common fibroblast phenotypes across disease states, which will facilitate the identification of common signaling pathways, gene regulatory programs, and cell surface markers that are going to advance drug discovery and targeting.","Pradhan, Rachana N; Krishnamurty, Akshay T; Fletcher, Anne L; Turley, Shannon J; Müller, Sören",Immunological reviews,105,19

BACKGROUND Bowel obstruction is one of the main and the clinically and economically most relevant complication following closure of loop ileostomy after low anterior resection. The best surgical technique for closure of loop ileostomy has not been defined yet. METHODS HASTA trial is a multicenter pragmatic randomized controlled surgical trial with 2 parallel groups to compare hand suture versus stapling for closure of loop ileostomy. The primary endpoint was the rate of bowel obstruction within 30 days after ileostomy closure. RESULTS A total of 337 randomized patients undergoing closure of loop ileostomy after low anterior resection because of rectal cancer in 27 centers were included. The overall rate of postoperative ileus after ileostomy closure was 13.4%. Seventeen of 165 (10.3%) patients in the stapler group and 27 of 163 (16.6%) in the hand suture group developed bowel obstruction within 30 days postoperatively [odds ratio (OR) = 1.72; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.89-3.31 = 0.10]. Duration of surgical intervention was significantly shorter in the stapler group (15 minutes; P < 0.001). Multivariable analysis of potential risk factors did not reveal any significant correlation with development of postoperative ileus. Rate of anastomotic leakage (stapler: 3.0%, hand suture: 1.8%, P = 0.48) did not differ significantly as well as all other secondary endpoints. CONCLUSIONS Hand-sewn anastomosis versus stapler ileo-ileostomy for ileostomy closure are equally effective in terms of postoperative bowel obstruction, with stapler anastomosis leading to a shorter operation time. Postoperative ileus after ileostomy reversal remains a relevant complication.","Löffler, Thorsten; Rossion, Inga; Bruckner, Thomas; Diener, Markus K; Koch, Moritz; von Frankenberg, Moritz; Pochhammer, Julius; Thomusch, Oliver; Kijak, Thomas; Simon, Thomas; Mihaljevic, André L; Krüger, Matthias; Stein, Erwin; Prechtl, Gerald; Hodina, René; Michal, Walter; Strunk, Roland; Henkel, Karl; Bunse, Jörg; Jaschke, Gregor; Politt, Dirk; Heistermann, Hans Peter; Fußer, Mathis; Lange, Claas; Stamm, Achim; Vosschulte, Andreas; Holzer, Ralf; Partecke, Lars Ivo; Burdzik, Emanuel; Hug, Hubert M; Luntz, Steffen P; Kieser, Meinhard; Büchler, Markus W; Weitz, Jürgen",Annals of surgery,105,24

We examined a large multihospital data base to determine how practice is evolving with regard to the use of CT angiography and DSA in patients with ruptured cerebral aneurysm. MATERIALS AND METHODS The Premier Perspective data base was used to identify hospitalizations of patients treated with clipping or coiling of ruptured cerebral aneurysms from 2006-2011. Billing information was used to determine pretreatment and posttreatment use of DSA and CT angiography during hospitalization. RESULTS A total of 4972 patients (1022 clipping, 3950 coiling) at 116 hospitals were identified. The percentage of patients with SAH who underwent pretreatment CT angiography significantly increased from 20% in 2006 to 44% in 2011 (P < .0001), whereas the percentage of patients who underwent DSA remained unchanged from 96-94% (P = .28). This CT angiography trend was observed in coiling patients (17-42%, P < .0001) and clipping patients (32-54%, P < .0001). There was a significant increase in the percentage of patients who underwent posttreatment imaging from 41% in 2006 to 48% in 2011 (P = .0037). This trend was observed in clipping patients (33-65%, P < .0001) but not coiling patients (43-45%, P = .62). CONCLUSIONS For the pretreatment evaluation of ruptured aneurysms, the use of CT angiography increased from 2006-2011 without a corresponding decrease in the use of DSA. These results raise the question of potential redundancy without added clinical value of the second test.","McDonald, J S; Kallmes, D F; Lanzino, G; Cloft, H J",AJNR.

The treatment regimens have long-term effects detrimental to the patient's quality of life. Hence, this review was aimed to determine the overall HRQOL and its associated among prostate cancer patients. METHODS The review was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The databases searched were PubMed, Embase, Google Scholar and Cumulative Index to the Nursing and Allied Literature (CINAHL), which provided articles that were critically examined, yielding 52 studies that met the inclusion criteria for the systematic review. RESULTS Out of 52 studies, 30 studies reported poor overall HRQOL in various domains after prostate cancer treatment. Contrastingly, 15 studies reported good overall quality of life after treatment. Among the various domains, sexual function was the most grossly affected functional score by the treatment modalities of prostate cancer. Nonetheless, seven studies showed that the absence of a significant change in the overall quality of life after treatment. According to the studies, older age, comorbidities, higher clinical stage, higher Gleason score, greater cancer severity, African American race, impaired mental health, neoadjuvant hormonal therapy and lower level of education were the major poor predictors of HRQOL among prostate cancer patients. CONCLUSION The overall HRQOL in prostate cancer patients was generally poor in various functional domains after treatment. Among the various domains, sexual function was the most grossly affected functional score by the treatment modalities of prostate cancer.","Odeo, Sharon; Degu, Amsalu",Journal of oncology pharmacy practice : official publication of the International Society of Oncology Pharmacy Practitioners,105,1

NOSE minimizes surgical injury, involving a low risk of wound complications, fewer incisional hernias, faster recovery and less postoperative pain. Laparoscopic gastrectomy combined with NOSE is a procedure that can potentiate the advantages of both minimal invasive techniques. We aim to demonstrate the feasibility of laparoscopic subtotal gastrectomy with transvaginal specimen extraction in advanced gastric cancer. CASE A 72-year-old woman with a 2cm adenocarcinoma in gastric antrum was treated by laparoscopic subtotal gastrectomy and lymph node dissection. A totally laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastrojejunostomy was constructed. Specimen was extracted through the posterior fornix of vagina without difficulty. Histopathology confirmed pT3pN0 tumor. After a 10-month follow-up the patient was asymptomatic and getting adjuvant chemoradiotherapy. CONCLUSIONS Transvaginal specimen extraction after laparoscopic gastric resection for advanced gastric cancer is a feasible procedure. It is offered to selected patients and of course only to female patients.

METHODS In March 2020, we searched 5 databases for literature exploring the psychological consequences of the crisis. Main findings were extracted. RESULTS 32 citations were screened and 11 included in the review. Results suggest a negative psychological effect caused by the water crisis, including anxiety and health worries, exacerbated by lowered trust in public health officials, uncertainty about the long-term impacts of the crisis, financial hardships, stigma, and difficulties seeking help. There was evidence that concerns about tap water continued even after the state of emergency was lifted.

We aim to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis assessing headache severity after treatment of unruptured intracranial aneurysm. Methods- MEDLINE and EMBASE were systematically reviewed. Results- Data from 7 studies met inclusion criteria (309 nonduplicated patients). The standard mean difference in pre- and post-intervention headache severity was estimated at -0.448 (95% CI, -0.566 to -0.329) under a random effects model. No significant heterogeneity was noted nor was any significant publication bias demonstrated. Conclusions- This is the first systematic review assessing postoperative headache severity following treatment of unruptured intracranial aneurysm. While a significant reduction in headache severity was observed, further investigation into this phenomenon is recommended before it influences clinical practice. Future study should stratify headache outcomes by aneurysm size, location, and treatment modality.","Dandurand, Charlotte; Parhar, Harman S; Naji, Faysal; Prakash, Swetha; Redekop, Gary; Haw, Charles S; Prisman, Eitan; Gooderham, Peter A",Stroke,105,25

Although regularly included as a process variable in clinical trials, there have been no comprehensive reviews of how it can be modified. Using a registered protocol (PROSPERO 2016 CRD42016042761), we searched MEDLINE, PsychINFO, EMBASE, CINAHL, and CENTRAL up to November 2016 for all randomized controlled trials measuring PC in adults with chronic noncancer pain. Two authors independently screened studies and assessed bias risk using the Cochrane tool. Quality of evidence was rated according to Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation criteria. We included 79 studies (n = 9,914), which mostly recruited participants with musculoskeletal pain and had low risk of bias. Meta-analyses (standardized mean difference) showed 9 interventions had efficacy compared with waitlist/usual care or active control, although evidence quality was often low. The best evidence (moderate-high quality) was found for cognitive-behavioral therapy, multimodal treatment, and acceptance and commitment therapy. Effects were generally of medium strength and had questionable clinical significance. When only the 8 studies targeting people with high PC were included, effects were larger and more consistent. Multimodal treatment showed the strongest effects when all studies were considered, whereas cognitive-behavioral therapy had the best evidence among targeted studies.

The burden of stroke is increasing despite incredible progress and advancements in evidence-based acute care therapies and despite the substantial changes being made in acute care stroke systems, processes, and quality metrics. Although there has been increased global emphasis on the importance of postacute stroke care, stroke system changes have not expanded to include postacute care and outcome follow-up. Our objectives are to describe the gaps and challenges in postacute stroke care and suboptimal stroke outcomes; to report on stroke survivors' and caregivers' perceptions of current postacute stroke care and their call for improvements in follow-up services for recovery and secondary prevention; and, ultimately, to make the case that a paradigm shift is needed in the definition of comprehensive stroke care and the designation of Comprehensive Stroke Center. Three recommendations are made for a paradigm shift in comprehensive stroke care: (1) criteria should be established for designation of rehabilitation readiness for Comprehensive Stroke Centers, (2) The American Heart Association/American Stroke Association implement an expanded Get With The Guidelines-Stroke program and criteria for comprehensive stroke centers to be inclusive of rehabilitation readiness and measure outcomes at 90 days, and (3) a public health campaign should be launched to offer hopeful and actionable messaging for secondary prevention and recovery of function and health. Now is the time to honor the patients' and caregivers' strongest ask: better access and improved secondary prevention, stroke rehabilitation, and personalized care.","Duncan, Pamela W; Bushnell, Cheryl; Sissine, Mysha; Coleman, Sylvia; Lutz, Barbara J; Johnson, Anna M; Radman, Meghan; Pvru Bettger, Janet; Zorowitz, Richard D; Stein, Joel",Stroke,105,28

Our results suggest that at the broad scale, the likelihood of transmission occurring through any one pathway is approximately equal. However, the major transmission pathways for zoonoses differ widely according to the specific underlying drivers of EID events (e.g., land-use change, agricultural intensification). These results can be used to develop better targeting of surveillance for, and more effective control of newly emerged zoonoses in regions under different underlying pressures that drive disease emergence.","Loh, Elizabeth H; Zambrana-Torrelio, Carlos; Olival, Kevin J; Bogich, Tiffany L; Johnson, Christine K; Mazet, Jonna A K; Karesh, William; Daszak, Peter",Vector borne and zoonotic diseases,105,8

In this study, we discuss the potential mechanisms that justify the possible impact of COVID-19 on male fertility. The main point of entry of SARS-CoV-2 into the host cells appears to be through the viral spike protein which permits entry into cells via the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2 receptor). In human testes, ACE2 is enriched in Sertoli and Leydig cells and spermatogonia. Also, it seems that there is a mild or severe cytokine storm in patients with severe COVID-19, and such changes may affect fertility. It should also be mentioned that the orchitis caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus may have an important impact on fertility. Prolonged and high fever may lead to changes in testicular temperature and destroy germ cells. In general, there is little evidence for a definite conclusion, but there are facts that suggest that COVID-19 may affect male fertility. It is prudent for men of reproductive age who have recovered from COVID-19 to be evaluated for the presence of the virus in semen and fertility-related items. There is an urgent need to conduct quality studies on, in particular, the long-term effects of COVID-19 on the fertility of recovered males.","Vahedian-Azimi, Amir; Karimi, Leila; Makvandi, Somayeh; Jamialahmadi, Tannaz; Sahebkar, Amirhossein",Advances in experimental medicine and biology,105,1

This work sought to mathematically model infarct growth and determine whether infarct volume growth can be predicted by angiographic assessment of pial collateral recruitment in an experimental MCA occlusion animal model. MATERIALS AND METHODS Pial collateral recruitment was quantified by using DSA, acquired 15 minutes following permanent MCA occlusion in 6 canines based on a scoring system (average pial collateral score) and arterial arrival time. MR imaging-based infarct volumes were measured 60, 90, 120, 180, 240 and 1440 minutes following MCA occlusion and were parameterized in terms of the growth rate index and final infarct volume (VFinal) as V(t) = VFinal [1 - e(-G × t)] (t = time). Correlations of the growth rate index and final infarct volume to the average pial collateral score and arterial arrival time were assessed by linear bivariate analysis. Correlations were used to generate asymptotic models of infarct growth for average pial collateral score or arterial arrival time values. Average pial collateral score- and arterial arrival time-based models were assessed by F tests and residual errors. RESULTS Evaluation of pial collateral recruitment at 15 minutes postocclusion was strongly correlated with 24-hour infarct volumes (average pial collateral score: r2 = 0.96, P < .003; arterial arrival time: r2 = 0.86, P < .008). Infarct growth and the growth rate index had strong and moderate linear relationships to the average pial collateral score (r2 = 0.89; P < .0033) and arterial arrival time (r2 = 0.69; P < .0419), respectively. Final infarct volume and the growth rate index were algebraically replaced by angiographically based collateral assessments to model infarct growth. The F test demonstrated no statistical advantage to using the average pial collateral score- over arterial arrival time-based predictive models, despite lower residual errors in the average pial collateral score-based model (P < .03). CONCLUSIONS In an experimental permanent MCA occlusion model, assessment of pial collaterals correlates with the infarct growth rate index and has the potential to predict asymptotic infarct volume growth.","Christoforidis, G A; Vakil, P; Ansari, S A; Dehkordi, F H; Carroll, T J",AJNR.

The goal of this article is to demonstrate a method for placing bilateral venous interposition grafts in a rabbit, then transducing the grafts with a gene transfer vector that achieves durable transgene expression. The method allows the investigation of the biological roles of genes and their protein products in normal vein graft homeostasis. It also allows the testing of transgenes for the activities that could prevent vein graft failure, e.g., whether the expression of a transgene prevents the neointimal growth, reduces the vascular inflammation, or reduces atherosclerosis in rabbits fed with a high-fat diet. During an initial survival surgery, the segments of right and left external jugular vein are excised and placed bilaterally as reversed end-to-side common carotid artery interposition grafts. During a second survival surgery, performed 28 days later, each of the grafts is isolated from the circulation with vascular clips and the lumens are filled (via an arteriotomy) with a solution containing a helper-dependent adenoviral (HDAd) vector. After a 20-min incubation, the vector solution is aspirated, the arteriotomy is repaired, and flow is restored. The veins are harvested at time points dictated by individual experimental protocols. The 28-day delay between the graft placement and the transduction is necessary to ensure the adaptation of the vein graft to the arterial circulation. This adaptation avoids rapid loss of transgene expression that occurs in vein grafts transduced before or immediately after grafting. The method is unique in its ability to achieve durable, stable transgene expression in grafted veins. Compared to other large animal vein graft models, rabbits have advantages of low cost and easy handling. Compared to rodent vein graft models, rabbits have larger and easier-to-manipulate blood vessels that provide abundant tissue for analysis.","Bi, Lianxiang; Wacker, Bradley K; Dichek, David A",Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,105,24

Quality of life (QOL) and functional outcome are important aspects when valuing a new technique. The aim of this prospective study was to assess both functional outcome and QOL after TAMIS. METHODS From 2011 to 2013, patients were prospectively studied prior to and at least 6 months after TAMIS for rectal adenomas and low-risk T1 carcinomas using a single-site laparoscopy port. Functional outcome was determined using the Faecal Incontinence Severity Index (FISI). Quality of life was measured using functional [Faecal Incontinence Quality of Life (FIQL)] and generic (EuroQol EQ-5D) questionnaires. RESULTS The study population consisted of 24 patients 13 men, median age 59 (range 42-83) with 24 tumours [median distance from the dentate line 8 cm (range 2-17 cm); median tumour size 6 cm(2) (range 0.25-51 cm(2)); 20 adenomas; 4 low-risk T1 carcinomas]. Post-operative complications occurred in one patient (4 %; grade IIIb according to Clavien Dindo classification). Compared to baseline, FISI remained unaffected (9.8 vs 7.3; P = 0.26), FIQL remained unaffected, and EuroQol EQ-5D improved (EQ-VAS: 77 vs 83; P = 0.04). CONCLUSION There was no detrimental effect of TAMIS on anorectal function. Overall QOL was improved after TAMIS, probably due to removal of the tumour, and at 6 months was equal to the general population.","Verseveld, Maria; Barendse, Renée M; Gosselink, Martijn P; Verhoef, Cornelis; de Graaf, Eelco J R; Doornebosch, Pascal G",Surgical endoscopy,105,11

Because of the pressure on mediastinal structures it can be the cause of non-immune hydrops fetalis and polyhydramnion. The development of hydrops fetalis leads to fetal death or premature delivery in most reported cases. Early surgical removal is important, but, the result of treatment depends on the stage of development of mediastinal organs and complications in the postoperative period. CASE REPORT A 31-year-old gravida carrying twins, with spontaneous membrane rupture at 32 weeks gestation underwent urgent caesarean section after antenatal ultrasound revealed severe polyhydramnion and hydrops fetalis in geminus A. The child was intubated immediately after birth due to severe respiratory distress. Ultrasound and X-ray revealed a tumour mass in the right hemithorax. Tumour resection was performed at the age of 7 days. Histology examination revealed an encapsulated immature teratoma. The postoperative course was complicated with respiratory insufficiency which turned into chronic at the age of eight months. CONCLUSION This is the fifth reported child with fetal mediastinal teratoma and severe hydrops fetalis that survived the neonatal period. Additional diagnostic search revealed abnormal course of both pulmonary arteries, which was probably one of the main causes of respiratory insufficiency.","Simoncic, Milanka; Kopriva, Silvo; Zupancic, Ziva; Jerse, Maja; Babnik, Janez; Srpcic, Matevz; Grosek, Stefan",Radiology and oncology,105,19

Due to the rapid spread, strong contagion, high incidence of lethality in severe cases, and the lack of a pharmaceutical prevention or cure, COVID-19 has posed a serious threat to human life and health. It has also had a tremendous impact on mental health, including fear and worry, difficulty sleeping or concentrating, and increased use of poor coping mechanisms. Osteopathic medical students have had additional concerns regarding the interruption of their studies, closing of clinical rotations, and postponed licensing exams. To date, few reports have focused on osteopathic medical students and their reactions to the outbreak. OBJECTIVES To assess resilience, coping, health behaviors, and emotional wellbeing of osteopathic medical students during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS In this cross-sectional study, we distributed an anonymous online survey to all medical students enrolled at Nova Southeastern University in May 2020 (n=1,310) via an e-mail invitation using the institution's student listservs. Our major study variables were based on published reports and anecdotal evidence; we subsequently developed the Emotional Wellbeing in Healthcare Professions Students Questionnaire (EWB-Q). This EWB-Q contained validated scales to assess the contribution of levels of coping strategies used, personal resilience, and health behaviors on the emotional wellbeing of osteopathic medical students. Multiple linear regression and other statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS v0.26. RESULTS Of the 1,310 students invited to participate, 335 (25.5%) surveys were returned. Of those, 133 had more than 33% of the necessary data missing and were removed, resulting in 202 (15.4%) completed questionnaires. The mean age of the participants was 26.7 years. About half (n=92; 45.5%) were in the clinical phase (years 3 and 4) of their medical school training (in rotations). A significant regression equation was found (F[4,171]=17.481, p<0.000, R 2 =0.290, R 2adjusted=0.274), indicating that levels of coping, personal resilience, and health behaviors (i.e., not sleeping more than usual, not exercising less than usual) accounted for a significant amount of the variance in emotional wellbeing scores in osteopathic medical students. Higher levels of resilience, greater use of coping strategies, not sleeping more than usual, and not exercising less than usual were predictors of emotional wellbeing. CONCLUSIONS Cultivating positive mental health should be a high priority for medical educators as they develop and implement curriculum-based initiatives to help medical students bolster their personal resilience and to encourage healthy coping behaviors during times of crisis and beyond. A proactive position that assists with building personal resilience and developing stress management habits is paramount in assisting students who are grappling not only with the challenges of rigorous medical training, but also with the uncertainty and stress that exists during any major global health or socioeconomic crisis.","Jacobs, Robin; Lanspa, Michelle; Kane, Michael; Caballero, Joshua",Journal of osteopathic medicine,105,12

However, the in vivo tissue effects of RFA on the esophageal wall are uncertain. Methods We prospectively enrolled eight patients with flat-type early ESCNs who were treated with balloon-based RFA. We evaluated the in vivo tissue effect on the esophagus using endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) and the histology of retrieved coagulum. Results The mean tumor length was 6.1 cm, and six of the eight patients achieved a complete response after primary RFA. Real-time evaluation of the tissue effect showed that the mucosa and submucosal layer were more edematous and thicker after RFA than before the procedure (mean 4.89 vs. 2.04 mm, p<.001), suggesting that the thermal effect of RFA may injure the submucosa. Histological evaluation of retrieved coagulum showed a severe cauterization (burning) effect with extensive cell necrosis; however, four cases had some residual viable neoplastic cells. Even though there were viable cells in the sloughed coagulum, half of the patients still achieved complete remission after RFA.

We questioned whether the PneuX low-volume fold-free cuff design would prevent cuff leakage and maintain the same tracheal wall pressure as high-volume, low-pressure (HVLP) cuffs. METHODS We evaluated 4 HVLP-cuffed endotracheal tubes (ETTs), Hi-Lo (polyvinyl chloride [PVC]), Microcuff (polyurethane [PU]), SealGuard (PU + tapered), and TaperGuard (PVC + tapered), and the PneuX with its dedicated tracheal seal monitor. In Part 1, we determined tracheal wall pressure using each cuff's capacity to support water columns across recommended intracuff pressures. In Part 2, we evaluated the tracheal seal monitor function at recommended settings. In Part 3, we compared leakage volumes of all ETTs during 30 min of simulated mechanical ventilation or during 8 h if no leak occurred. Parts 1 and 3 were performed with/without lubrication and PEEP. RESULTS In Part 1, PneuX cuffs exerted an average tracheal wall pressure of 27.4 ± 2.4 cm H2O at the recommended intracuff pressure of approximately 80 cm H2O. Tracheal wall pressure did not differ among HVLP cuffs (19.6 ± 1.4 to 29.5 ± 1.4 cm H2O). In Part 2, preinflation intracuff pressure affected the time to obtain tracheal seal monitor pressure attainment (P < .01). The tracheal seal monitor generated average calculated tracheal wall pressure of 33.4 ± 1.2 cm H2O. In Part 3, PneuX ETT showed no leak across 8 h for all trials. Overall, leakage volume was lower with PU (P < .01) and PneuX (P < .01) than with PVC cuffs, regardless of shape, and lower with lubrication and/or PEEP (all P < .01). In each HVLP cuff, lubrication alone eliminated leak at an intracuff pressure of ≤30 cm H2O. CONCLUSIONS The PneuX cuff generally exerted acceptable tracheal wall pressure, but the tracheal wall pressure monitor allowed pressures exceeding 30 cm H2O in some trials and was the only ETT to prevent leak in all tests. For HVLP cuffs, leak was reduced by PU and PEEP and eliminated by lubrication.","Chenelle, Christopher T; Itagaki, Taiga; Fisher, Daniel F; Berra, Lorenzo; Kacmarek, Robert M",Respiratory care,105,6

SOURCES Electronic searches were performed in Scopus, Embase, and Web of Science databases for the identification of relevant studies, from 1980 until 2nd August 2019. STUDY SELECTION The review protocol was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42018096959) and the review was conducted according to PRISMA guidelines. Observational studies which examined the association between erosive toothwear, and GERD/S were included and categorised according to the use of objective or subjective measures of GERD/S. Where possible, odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were derived and pooled in a meta-analysis. DATA 27 studies were considered relevant for the qualitative synthesis and 19 studies were pooled. Significantly increased odds of erosive toothwear were observed in individuals with GERD/S. This trend was more strongly associated with objectively measured GERD/S (OR 4.13, 95% CI 1.68-10.13), compared to subjectively measured GERD/S (OR 2.69, 95% CI 1.13-6.38). Whilst heterogeneity was very high these trends remained in most sensitivity and subgroup analyses conducted. CONCLUSION Individuals with GERD/S have a 2-4 fold increased odds ratio of also presenting with evidence of erosive toothwear compared with individuals who do not have GERD/S. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE This review suggests the need for a multidisciplinary medical and dental approach to managing individuals who present with erosive toothwear or GERD/S.

Pregnant women are currently experiencing elevated anxiety and depression symptoms, which may increase risk of substance use, and potentially result in poor perinatal and neurodevelopmental outcomes for children. METHODS Survey results were analyzed from an ongoing study of 7470 pregnant individuals in Canada: Pregnancy during the COVID-19 Pandemic. Participants were asked about current use of alcohol and substances, symptoms of depression and anxiety, and COVID-19 concerns: how much they worry about COVID-19 threatening their baby's life, threatening their own life, care for themselves or the baby, feelings of social isolation, and financial difficulties. RESULTS The percentage of participants who reported use during pregnancy was 6.7 % for alcohol, 4.3 % for cannabis, 4.9 % for tobacco, and 0.3 % for illicit drugs; 2.6 % were using multiple substances. Higher depression symptoms and financial difficulties were associated with more cannabis and/or tobacco use as well as the co-use of substances. There were no associations between alcohol use and mental health or COVID-19 concerns. CONCLUSIONS Self-reported rates of use and co-use were lower or comparable to previous research, perhaps reflecting pandemic-related circumstances or the demographics of this sample. Depression symptoms and pandemic-related financial difficulties were associated with more tobacco use, cannabis use, and substance co-use. It remains important to maintain access to perinatal, mental health, and financial supports during the pandemic to mitigate prenatal alcohol and substance use and prevent poor perinatal and long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes for children.","Kar, Preeti; Tomfohr-Madsen, Lianne; Giesbrecht, Gerald; Bagshawe, Mercedes; Lebel, Catherine",Drug and alcohol dependence,105,28

However, NAs are not limited to pathogens, but are also present within the host. As such, the immune system has evolved an elaborate set of pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs) that employ various strategies to recognize distinct types of NAs, while reliably distinguishing between self and non-self. The here-employed strategies encompass the positioning of NA-sensing PRRs in certain subcellular compartments that potentially come in contact with pathogens but not host NAs, the existence of counterregulatory measures that keep endogenous nucleic acids below a certain threshold, and also the specific identification of certain non-self patterns. Here, we review recent advances in the molecular mechanisms of NA recognition by TLRs, RLRs, and the cGAS-STING axis. We highlight the differences in NA-PRR interfaces that confer specificity and selectivity toward an NA ligand, as well as the NA-dependent induced conformational changes required for signal transduction.

Next, a SILS Port (Covidien, Tokyo, Japan) was inserted. A flexible 5-mm laparoscope was inserted through the port with a grasper (SILS Clinch, Covidien) and a normal 5-mm scalpel. The fundus of the gallbladder was tied by the ENDOLOOP. The Lapaherclosure was then directly inserted through a right lower intercostal space to capture and pull the Lapaherclosure out. After the cystic artery and duct were cut, the resected gallbladder was directly extracted from the umbilical incision. DISCUSSION Several methods and devices have been developed to perform single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy, including the suturing method, the Mini Loop Retractor II (Covidien), and the EndoGrab (Virtual Ports, Caesarea, Israel). However, considering medical costs and safety, our retraction method seems to be feasible and comparable to existing methods.","Funamizu, Naotake; Okamoto, Tomoyoshi; Kumamoto, Tomotaka; Kazama, Takashi; Watanabe, Atsushi; Fujioka, Shuichi; Yanaga, Katsuhiko",Asian journal of endoscopic surgery,105,1

Mouse hepatitis coronavirus (MHV) uses the N-terminal domain (NTD) of its spike protein as its receptor-binding domain. Here we present the crystal structure of MHV NTD complexed with its receptor murine carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1a (mCEACAM1a). Unexpectedly, MHV NTD contains a core structure that has the same β-sandwich fold as human galectins (S-lectins) and additional structural motifs that bind to the N-terminal Ig-like domain of mCEACAM1a. Despite its galectin fold, MHV NTD does not bind sugars, but instead binds mCEACAM1a through exclusive protein-protein interactions. Critical contacts at the interface have been confirmed by mutagenesis, providing a structural basis for viral and host specificities of coronavirus/CEACAM1 interactions. Sugar-binding assays reveal that galectin-like NTDs of some coronaviruses such as human coronavirus OC43 and bovine coronavirus bind sugars. Structural analysis and mutagenesis localize the sugar-binding site in coronavirus NTDs to be above the β-sandwich core. We propose that coronavirus NTDs originated from a host galectin and retained sugar-binding functions in some contemporary coronaviruses, but evolved new structural features in MHV for mCEACAM1a binding.","Peng, Guiqing; Sun, Dawei; Rajashankar, Kanagalaghatta R; Qian, Zhaohui; Holmes, Kathryn V; Li, Fang",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,105,1

Here we determined potential correlation between COVID-19 and spice consumption. The data from 163 countries including total cases, total deaths, and total recovered were analyzed. It was observed that there is a clear interrelated prevalence between the total number of COVID-19 cases per million population tested and the gram of spice supply per capita per day. Nations with lower consumptions of spices per capita showed greater number of COVID-19 cases per million population. This is not surprising as herbs and spices are well-known to boost immunity. Although the precise molecular mechanisms associated with spices and immunity are not completely understood, our findings led us to hypothesize that spice consumption plays a role in our ability to fight COVID-19; however, intensive research is needed to determine the translational value of these findings.","Elsayed, Yehya; Khan, Naveed Ahmed",ACS chemical neuroscience,105,1

METHODS ASCO convened an Expert Panel to conduct a systematic review of published phase III randomized controlled trials (2007-2020) on systemic therapy for advanced HCC and provide recommended care options for this patient population. RESULTS Nine phase III randomized controlled trials met the inclusion criteria. RECOMMENDATIONS Atezolizumab + bevacizumab (atezo + bev) may be offered as first-line treatment of most patients with advanced HCC, Child-Pugh class A liver disease, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG PS) 0-1, and following management of esophageal varices, when present, according to institutional guidelines. Where there are contraindications to atezolizumab and/or bevacizumab, tyrosine kinase inhibitors sorafenib or lenvatinib may be offered as first-line treatment of patients with advanced HCC, Child-Pugh class A liver disease, and ECOG PS 0-1. Following first-line treatment with atezo + bev, and until better data are available, second-line therapy with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor may be recommended for appropriate candidates. Following first-line therapy with sorafenib or lenvatinib, second-line therapy options for appropriate candidates include cabozantinib, regorafenib for patients who previously tolerated sorafenib, or ramucirumab (for patients with α-fetoprotein ≥ 400 ng/mL), or atezo + bev where patients did not have access to this option as first-line therapy. Pembrolizumab or nivolumab are also reasonable options for appropriate patients following sorafenib or lenvatinib. Consideration of nivolumab + ipilimumab as an option for second-line therapy and third-line therapy is discussed.

We hypothesized that there would be a strong correlation between the degree of reperfusion achieved and clinical outcomes in target mismatch (TMM) patients. METHODS The degree of reperfusion was calculated on the basis of the difference in perfusion-weighted imaging volumes (time to maximum of tissue residue function [Tmax]>6 s) between the baseline MRI and the early post-treatment follow-up scan. Patients were grouped into quartiles, on the basis of degree of reperfusion achieved, and the association between the degree of reperfusion and clinical outcomes in TMM and no TMM patients was assessed. Favorable clinical response was determined at day 30 on the basis of the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale and good functional outcome was defined as a modified Rankin Scale score ≤2 at day 90. RESULTS This study included 121 patients; 98 of these had TMM. The median degree of reperfusion achieved was not different in TMM patients (60%) versus No TMM patients (64%; P=0.604). The degree of reperfusion was strongly correlated with both favorable clinical response (P<0.001) and good functional outcome (P=0.001) in TMM patients; no correlation was present in no TMM. The frequency of achieving favorable clinical response or good functional outcome was significantly higher in TMM patients in the highest reperfusion quartile versus the lower 3 quartiles (88% versus 41% as odds ratio, 10.3; 95% confidence interval, 2.8-37.5; and 75% versus 34% as odds ratio, 5.9; 95% confidence interval, 2.1-16.7, respectively). A receiver operating characteristic curve analysis identified 90% as the optimal reperfusion threshold for predicting good functional outcomes. CONCLUSION The degree of reperfusion documented on perfusion-weighted imaging after reperfusion therapies corresponds closely with clinical outcomes in TMM patients. Reperfusion of ≥90% of the perfusion lesion is an appropriate goal for reperfusion therapies to aspire to.","Inoue, Manabu; Mlynash, Michael; Straka, Matus; Kemp, Stephanie; Jovin, Tudor G; Tipirneni, Aaryani; Hamilton, Scott A; Marks, Michael P; Bammer, Roland; Lansberg, Maarten G; Albers, Gregory W",Stroke,105,5

However, patients with primarily neurological symptoms are often overlooked and tested later. OBJECTIVE We aim to summarise all the neurological manifestations which are reported so far to aid in early diagnosis and preventingze all the neurological manifestations that are reported so far to aid in early diagnosis and prevent further complication of the disease. METHODS AND MATERIAL We did a literature search on the topic using Google search engine through Google Scholar, PubMed, and WHO resources by keywords including Coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19, Clinical features, Stroke, Transverse myelitis, Encephalitis, Encephalopathy, Guillain-Barre syndrome, Hypogeusia, Hyposmia, Anosmia, and Neurological manifestations. DISCUSSION SARS-CoV-2 can affect the neuronal cells by both direct and indirect mechanisms. This can lead to various neurological manifestations ranging from subtle symptoms of myalgia, headache, dizziness, hypogeusia, hyposmia to dreaded complications like stroke, encephalitis, demyelinating disease like Guillain-Barre syndrome. CONCLUSIONS Presentation of COVID-19 with neurological features is not uncommon, and these patients should be tested earlier to help in the prevention of transmission, early diagnosis, and management.","Gupta, Amit; Yadav, Prakrati; Kumar, Deepak",Infectious disorders drug targets,105,1

In contrast, data from emergency medical services (EMS) provide a source of information nearly in real time that may be useful for rapid and more granular surveillance of overdose mortality. Objective To describe racial/ethnic, social, and geographic trends in EMS-observed overdose-associated cardiac arrests during the COVID-19 pandemic through December 2020 and assess the concordance with CDC-reported provisional total overdose mortality through May 2020. Design, Setting, and Participants This cohort study included more than 11 000 EMS agencies in 49 US states that participate in the National EMS Information System and 83.7 million EMS activations in which patient contact was made. Exposures Year and month of occurrence of overdose-associated cardiac arrest; patient race/ethnicity; census region and division; county-level urbanicity; and zip code-level racial/ethnic composition, poverty, and educational attainment. Main Outcomes and Measures Overdose-associated cardiac arrests per 100 000 EMS activations with patient contact in 2020 were compared with a baseline of values from 2018 and 2019. Aggregate numbers of overdose-associated cardiac arrests and percentage increases were compared with provisional total mortality in CDC records from rolling 12-month windows with end months spanning January 2018 through July 2020. Results Among 33.4 million EMS activations in 2020, 16.8 million (50.2%) involved female patients and 16.3 million (48.8%) involved non-Hispanic White individuals. Overdose-associated cardiac arrests were elevated by 42.1% nationally in 2020 (42.3 per 100 000 EMS activations at baseline vs 60.1 per 100 000 EMS activations in 2020). The highest percentage increases were seen among Latinx individuals (49.7%; 38.8 per 100 000 activations at baseline vs 58.1 per 100 000 activations in 2020) and Black or African American individuals (50.3%; 21.5 per 100 000 activations at baseline vs 32.3 per 100 000 activations in 2020), people living in more impoverished neighborhoods (46.4%; 42.0 per 100 000 activations at baseline vs 61.5 per 100 000 activations in 2020), and the Pacific states (63.8%; 33.1 per 100 000 activations at baseline vs 54.2 per 100 000 activations in 2020), despite lower rates at baseline for these groups. The EMS records were available 6 to 12 months ahead of CDC mortality figures and showed a high concordance (r = 0.98) for months in which both data sets were available. If the historical association between EMS-observed and total overdose mortality holds true, an expected total of approximately 90 632 (95% CI, 85 737-95 525) overdose deaths may eventually be reported by the CDC for 2020. Conclusions and Relevance In this cohort study, records from EMS agencies provided an effective manner to rapidly surveil shifts in US overdose mortality. Unprecedented overdose deaths during the pandemic necessitate investments in overdose prevention as an essential aspect of the COVID-19 response and postpandemic recovery. This is particularly urgent for more socioeconomically disadvantaged and racial/ethnic minority communities subjected to the compounded burden of disproportionate COVID-19 mortality and rising overdose deaths.","Friedman, Joseph; Mann, N Clay; Hansen, Helena; Bourgois, Philippe; Braslow, Joel; Bui, Alex A T; Beletsky, Leo; Schriger, David L",JAMA psychiatry,105,31

Infectious diseases were seen as a minor problem. This, however, changed in 2020 when the global COVID-19 pandemic broke out and a new danger emerged. The latest events generated a lot of discussion on health hazards associated with international tourism and uncontrolled spread of pathogens across the borders. The major health problems of travelers to developing countries with harsh environmental conditions and endemic infectious diseases include gastrointestinal disorders, dermatoses, respiratory infections and fevers of unknown origin. A medical interview by an experienced physician is the foundation of the post-travel screening process both in symptomatic and asymptomatic travelers; the interview should focus on identifying exposure to risk factors (endemic infectious diseases, failure to adopt disease prevention measures, consumption of food or water from unsafe sources, insect bites, animal bites, travelling in large groups, unsafe sex with casual partners). While physical examination (identification of abnormalities) and diagnostic tests (identification of pathogens) can be useful for detecting illnesses and asymptomatic infections as well as assessing the general health condition of a patient, including his immune system. The aim of the article is to provide information on the post-travel screening process in symptomatic and asymptomatic travelers who have returned from areas with harsh climate conditions and low sanitation standards.","Korzeniewski, Krzysztof",International maritime health,105,1

MATERIALS AND METHODS One hundred one patients enrolled in the study were separated into two groups. Fifty-one patients with 65 hepatocellular carcinomas underwent prospective virtual CT sonography as guidance for radiofrequency ablation. Fifty patients with 63 hepatocellular carcinomas managed with B-mode sonographic guidance were retrospectively selected under the same conditions as the virtual CT sonography group to act as a historical control group. RESULTS In the virtual CT sonography group, technically successful ablation was achieved in a single session in 92% (47/51) of the patients and in two sessions in 8% (4/51). In the B-mode sonography group, technical success was achieved in a single session in 72% (36/50) of the patients, in two sessions in 24% (12/50), and in three sessions in 4% (2/50). Treatment analysis showed that the technical success rate after a single treatment session was significantly (p = 0.017) higher for the virtual CT sonography group. The number of treatment sessions was significantly (p = 0.021) lower for the virtual CT sonography group (mean, 1.1 +/- 0.1 vs 1.3 +/- 0.3 sessions).

Moreover, many clinician teachers today are not specifically trained in and/or comfortable in delivering effective BST. Resucitating this valuable educational format may require a new approach to preparing teachers and setting the stage for effective BST. Framing BST as an entrustable professional activity (EPA) for teachers may be one strategy to enhance its application and quality. METHODS We aimed to redefine, describe essential features and effective practices for high-quality BST, based on clinical teacher participant perspectives through a focus group discussion and open-ended questionnaires via e-mail, supplemented by insights from literature. RESULTS Based on data collected, we generated a definition of BST and a list of suggested strategies to optimise BST, for example, preparation, safe learning environment, flexible teaching and patient's benefits. A structured EPA description was created based on this definition.

Moreover, the typical Ark vaccine subpopulations emerging in chickens vaccinated with commercial Ark vaccines were not detected in chickens vaccinated with CEKp7, indicating that kidney-cell adaptation drastically increased the stability of the vaccine virus population in chickens. In the current study both conventional and next-generation sequencing results show that the changes achieved during CEK adaptation remained after five back passages in embryonated chicken egg (ECE). In a first protection study 1-day-old chickens were vaccinated with 104.0 or 105.0 50% embryo infectious doses (EID50)/chicken of the second ECE back passage of CEKp7 (CEKp7e2) and demonstrated protection against Ark virulent (106.0 EID50) challenge. In a second protection trial, protection by CEKp7e2 was compared with protection conferred by an attenuated commercial ArkDPI-derived vaccine different from that which the CEK-adapted virus originated. All vaccinated chicken groups showed a significant reduction of respiratory signs and viral load after Ark virulent challenge compared to unvaccinated-challenged controls. In CEKp7e2 vaccinated chickens viral subpopulations different from the challenge virus were detected after challenge in a marginal number (7%-8%) of chickens. In contrast, IBV S1 sequences that differed from the predominant population in the challenge virus were detected after challenge in a large number (77%) of chickens vaccinated with the commercial Ark attenuated vaccine. The CEK-adapted IBV ArkDPI-derived vaccine is a stable and effective vaccine, which drastically reduces the emergence of Ark-like viruses both at vaccination and after challenge.","Zegpi, R A; Breedlove, C; van Santen, V L; Rasmussen-Ivey, C R; Toro, H",Avian diseases,105,16

This suggests a need for coupled social-climate models that capture pervasive real-world asymmetries in the population distribution of the consequences of anthropogenic climate change and climate (in)action. Here, we use evolutionary game theory to develop a social-climate model with group structure to investigate how anthropogenic climate change and population heterogeneity coevolve. We find that greater homophily and resource inequality cause an increase in the global peak temperature anomaly by as much as 0.7°C. Also, climate change can structure human populations by driving opinion polarization. Finally, climate mitigation achieved by reducing the cost of mitigation measures paid by individuals tends to be contingent upon socio-economic conditions, whereas policies that achieve communication between different strata of society show climate mitigation benefits across a broad socio-economic regime. We conclude that advancing climate change mitigation efforts can benefit from a social-climate systems perspective.","Menard, Jyler; Bury, Thomas M; Bauch, Chris T; Anand, Madhur",Proceedings.

Good correlations at statistically significant levels between the daily values of EER and the daily G were found. The seasonal variability of EER/G is also discussed and the correction factors are determined for inclusion of vertical column ozone and solar zenith angle (SZA) cycles. The comparison of the estimated daily EER against the independent observed EER revealed that under clear sky conditions the estimations are accurate to 10% or better over SZA of 10-60 degrees and column ozone of 250-350 Dobson. The comparison of the results with the similar works that have used shorter period of experimental data showed more accurate estimates. The deduced relations could be used to a rough estimate of the daily EER from G in arid climate regions, where there is no measured UV radiation or there are instrumental and other difficulties encountered in measuring UV radiation.","Sabziparvar, Ali A; Farahani, M M",International journal of biometeorology,105,24

Their incidence increases with age, and males are more often affected. First-line management includes maximum safe surgical resection followed by involved-field radiotherapy plus concomitant and six cycles of maintenance temozolomide chemotherapy. Standards of care at recurrence are much less well defined. Minorities of patients are offered second surgery or re-irradiation, but data on a positive impact on survival from randomized trials are lacking. The majority of patients who are eligible for salvage therapy receive systemic treatment, mostly with nitrosourea-based regimens or, depending on availability, bevacizumab alone or in various combinations. In clinical trials, lomustine alone has been increasingly used as a control arm, assigning this drug a standard-of-care position in the setting of recurrent glioblastoma. Here we review the activity of lomustine in the treatment of diffuse gliomas of adulthood in various settings. The most compelling data for lomustine stem from three randomized trials when lomustine was combined with procarbazine and vincristine as the PCV regimen in the newly diagnosed setting together with radiotherapy; improved survival with PCV was restricted to patients with isocitrate dehydrogenase-mutant tumors. No other agent with the possible exception of regorafenib has shown superior activity to lomustine in recurrent glioblastoma, but activity is largely restricted to patients with tumors with O6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation.

On this basis, we would like to focus a specific application of EVT: the dehiscence of the duodenal stump after upper gastrointestinal surgery. Standard EVT is not applicable in these cases because of technical limitations (length of overtube and devices). However, vacuum stimulates the healing of leaks and fistulas through granulation tissue's formation and would be effective also in this setting. MATERIALS AND METHODS Between October 2019 and January 2020, 7 consecutive patients (4 M, 3 F, 62±9 y old) affected by duodenal stump's dehiscence were endoscopically treated by the placement of a large-bore (14 to 18 Ch) suction tube across the wall's defect into the peritoneal cavity. Continuous aspiration at -80/-100 mm Hg was applied. Clinical success was established both by fluoroscopic check injecting contrast medium from the tube to verify the fistula's closure and by abdominal computed tomography scan to exclude residual fluid collections. RESULTS Technical and clinical success were achieved in all the patients. The suction tube was maintained in site for 12±5 days in continuous aspiration. The drainage's output became null in 2±1 days without any intra-abdominal residual fluid collection. The principle of this technique is to let the duodenal walls' stump to collapse on the intraluminal part of the tube (with subsequent mucosal intussusception into the holes of the tube itself) creating a sort of vacuum-packed barrier to interrupt the outflow of enteric materials into the fistula's path. It guarantees the fistula's closure by the gradual formation of granulation tissue. CONCLUSIONS The present technique offers a safe and viable endoscopic alternative to treat duodenal stump's leaks after upper gastrointestinal surgery.","Mutignani, Massimiliano; Dioscoridi, Lorenzo; Massad, Mutaz; Bonato, Giulia; Pugliese, Francesco; Cintolo, Marcello; Forti, Edoardo","Surgical laparoscopy, endoscopy & percutaneous techniques",105,16

METHODS The study was carried out as a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data from 51 patients who underwent closure of diverting stoma following resections of lower rectal cancer between January 2008 and December 2008. This study attempted to determine whether there was an association between the type of skin closure and the incidence of incisional SSI. Moreover, risk factors for incisional SSI after closure of diverting stoma were identified using a multivariate analysis. RESULTS An incisional SSI occurred in 12 of the 51 patients (23.5%). The rate of incisional SSI with subcuticular sutures was 11.1% (3/27) in comparison to 37.5% (9/24) with transdermal suture and skin stapler. A subcuticular skin closure was the only favorable factor that was significantly associated with a lower incidence of incisional SSI (odds ratio: 0.19; 95% confidence interval: 0.04-0.92). CONCLUSIONS A subcuticular skin closure has a protective effect against incisional SSI after closure of diverting stoma. A larger study is necessary to further define the role of subcuticular suture on the prevention of incisional SSI in cases of gastrointestinal surgery.","Kobayashi, Shin; Ito, Masaaki; Sugito, Masanori; Kobayashi, Akihiro; Nishizawa, Yusuke; Saito, Norio",Surgery today,105,1

Community-wide genetic diversity of Metarhizium species among 480 soil isolates from 14 states of western USA was investigated to assess the contributions of clonality and recombination in determining each species' population structure. Seven species, varying >100-fold in relative abundance, were identified by phylogenetic analysis of 5' EF1-α (5TEF), including M. robertsii (n=372), M. guizhouense (n=37), M. brunneum (n=37), M. lepidiotae (n=14), M. pemphigi (n=11), M. anisopliae (n=7) and M. pingshaense (n=2). Analyses of composite multilocus genotypes integrating 5TEF sequences, multilocus microsatellites and mating type idiomorphs conducted on a subset of 239 isolates revealed that all species populations display pronounced clonal structure. Following clone-correction procedures to remove redundant clonal genotypes and collapse clonal lineages, each species' population sample was determined to be composed of a dozen or fewer genetically unique individuals. Thus, the Metarhizium community inhabiting western USA is conservatively estimated to comprise as few as 34 distinct genetic individuals, with a single, geographically ubiquitous clonal lineage of M. robertsii constituting 45% of total isolates. M. robertsii was the only population determined to be in linkage equilibrium. However, the high proportion of private alleles differentiating most M. robertsii clonal lineages argues against contemporary panmixia, thus the recombination signal detected may be historical. Nevertheless, within M. robertsii, M. brunneum and M. guizhouense there are closely related genotypes of opposite mating type, which suggests that if recombination is contemporary, it likely occurs between closely related individuals. The restricted number of genetic individuals observed throughout western North American Metarhizium species may signify these represent peripheral populations descended from limited numbers of founders among whom there has been little recombination relative to the extent of clone expansion and within-clone genetic divergence.","Rehner, Stephen A",Journal of invertebrate pathology,105,24

METHODS Using electronic medical record data, we conducted a retrospective cohort study of nursing home patients treated with in-SNF hemodialysis from January 1, 2018 through June 20, 2020 within a dialysis organization across eight states. A dialytic episode began with the first in-SNF dialysis and was ended by hospitalization, death, transfer, or cessation of treatment. The clinical characteristics and natural history of these patients and their dialytic episodes are described. FINDINGS Four thousand five hundred and ten patients experienced 9274 dialytic episodes. Dialytic episodes had a median duration of 18 days (IQR: 8-38) and were terminated by a hospitalization n = 5747 (62%), transfer n = 2638 (28%), death n = 568 (6%), dialysis withdrawal n = 129 (1.4%), recovered function n = 2 (0.02%), or other cause n = 6 (0.06%). Increased patient mortality was associated with advancing age, low serum creatinine, albumin, or sodium, and low pre-dialytic systolic blood pressure (sBP). U-shaped relationships to mortality were observed for intradialytic hypotension frequency and for post- > pre-hemodialysis sBP frequency. Prescription of dialysis five times weekly in the first 2 weeks was associated with better survival in the first 90 days (HR 0.77, CI 0.62-0.96; p < 0.02). DISCUSSION Provision of in-SNF dialysis by an external dialysis organization enables discharge from the acute care setting for appropriate treatment with increased nursing contact time in an otherwise under-resourced environment.

To determine if robot-assisted myomectomy (RAM) is feasible for women with large uterine myomas. Methods. Retrospective review of one gynecologic surgeon's RAM cases between May 2010 and July 2013. Large uterine myomas, defined as the largest myoma ≥9 cm by preoperative magnetic resonance imaging, was age- and time-matched to controls with the largest myoma <9 cm. Primary surgical outcomes compared were operative time and estimated blood loss (EBL). Results. 207 patients were included: 66 (32%) patients were in the ≥9 cm group, while 141 (68%) patients were in the <9 cm group. There was a statistically significant increase in the operative time (130 min versus 92 min) and EBL (100 mL versus 25 mL) for the ≥9 cm group compared to the <9 cm group. Ten (4.8%) patients had the largest myoma measuring ≥15 cm, and 11 (5.3%) patients had a specimen weight >900 gm, of which no major adverse outcomes were observed. All patients in the study cohort were discharged on the same day after surgery. Conclusion. RAM is a feasible surgical approach for patients with myomas ≥9 cm. Patients with large myomas undergoing RAM are also candidates for same-day discharge after surgery.","Gunnala, Vinay; Setton, Robert; Pereira, Nigel; Huang, Jian Qun",Minimally invasive surgery,105,16

We sought CCP donations from: a) ""volunteers"" responding to advertisements in social media, press releases and websites, and b) ""referred"" individuals directed to the program or identified from hospitalization records. We determined the proportions of donor candidates who passed initial telephone health screening, who qualified after diagnostic testing, who presented to the regional CCP donation center, and who completed CCP donation. RESULTS There were 900 CCP donor candidates, including 363 volunteers and 537 referred donors. Of 360 contacted volunteers, 186 (5.7%) were excluded by interview; 133 were referred for additional diagnostic screening, 97 completed donor antibody and antigen testing, and 87 were qualified for CCP donation, resulting in 35 CCP donations (9.7% of initial telephone contacts). Among 533 referred donors, 448 (84.1%) were excluded by interview, 71 were referred for additional screening, 48 completed donor antibody and antigen testing, and 40 were qualified for CCP donation, resulting in 1 CCP donation (0.2% of initial telephone contacts).

We applied the dynamic push-pull technique to manipulate the flow-diverter mesh density at the aneurysm orifice to maximize flow diversion. This study investigated the hemodynamic impact of the dynamic push-pull technique on patient-specific aneurysms by using the developed high-fidelity virtual-stenting computational modeling technique combined with computational fluid dynamics. MATERIALS AND METHODS We deployed 2 Pipeline Embolization Devices into 2 identical sidewall anterior cerebral artery aneurysm phantoms by using the dynamic push-pull technique with different delivery-wire advancements. We then numerically simulated these deployment processes and validated the simulated mesh geometry. Computational fluid dynamics analysis was performed to evaluate detailed hemodynamic changes by deployed flow diverters in the sidewall aneurysm and a fusiform basilar trunk aneurysm (deployments implemented previously). Images of manipulated flow diverter mesh from sample clinical cases were also evaluated. RESULTS The flow diverters deployed in silico accurately replicated in vitro geometries. Increased delivery wire advancement (21 versus 11 mm) by using a dynamic push-pull technique produced a higher mesh compaction at the aneurysm orifice (50% metal coverage versus 36%), which led to more effective aneurysmal inflow reduction (62% versus 50% in the sidewall aneurysm; 57% versus 36% in the fusiform aneurysm). The dynamic push-pull technique also caused relatively lower metal coverage along the parent vessel due to elongation of the flow diverter. High and low mesh compactions were also achieved for 2 real patients by using the dynamic push-pull technique. CONCLUSIONS The described dynamic push-pull technique increases metal coverage of pure braided flow diverters over the aneurysm orifice, thereby enhancing the intended flow diversion, while reducing metal coverage along the parent vessel to prevent flow reduction in nearby perforators.","Ma, D; Xiang, J; Choi, H; Dumont, T M; Natarajan, S K; Siddiqui, A H; Meng, H",AJNR.

Their biogenesis mostly utilizes exoribonucleases of host cells that degrade viral genomic or subgenomic RNAs in the 5'-to-3' direction until being stalled by well-defined RNA structures. Here we report a viral lncRNA that is produced by a novel replication-dependent mechanism. This lncRNA corresponds to the last 283 nucleotides of the turnip crinkle virus (TCV) genome, hence is designated tiny TCV subgenomic RNA (ttsgR). ttsgR accumulated to high levels in TCV-infected Nicotiana benthamiana cells when the TCV-encoded RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), also known as p88, was overexpressed. Both (+) and (-) strand forms of ttsgR were produced in a manner dependent on the RdRp functionality. Strikingly, templates as short as ttsgR itself were sufficient to program ttsgR amplification, as long as the TCV-encoded replication proteins, p28 and p88, were provided in trans. Consistent with its replicational origin, ttsgR accumulation required a 5' terminal carmovirus consensus sequence (CCS), a sequence motif shared by genomic and subgenomic RNAs of many viruses phylogenetically related to TCV. More importantly, introducing a new CCS motif elsewhere in the TCV genome was alone sufficient to cause the emergence of another lncRNA. Finally, abolishing ttsgR by mutating its 5' CCS gave rise to a TCV mutant that failed to compete with wildtype TCV in Arabidopsis. Collectively our results unveil a replication-dependent mechanism for the biogenesis of viral lncRNAs, thus suggesting that multiple mechanisms, individually or in combination, may be responsible for viral lncRNA production. Importance Many positive strand (+) RNA viruses produce long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) during the process of cellular infections, and mobilize these lncRNAs to counteract antiviral defenses, as well as coordinate the translation of viral proteins. Most viral lncRNAs arise from 5'-to-3' degradation of longer viral RNAs being stalled at stable secondary structures. We report a viral lncRNA that is produced by the replication machinery of turnip crinkle virus (TCV). This lncRNA, designated ttsgR, shares the terminal characteristics with TCV genomic and subgenomic RNAs, and over-accumulates in the presence of moderately overexpressed TCV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). Furthermore, templates that are of similar sizes as ttsgR itself are readily replicated by TCV replication proteins (p28 and RdRp) provided from non-viral sources. In summary, this study establishes an approach for uncovering low abundance viral lncRNAs, and characterizes a replicating TCV lncRNA. Similar investigations on human-pathogenic (+) RNA viruses could yield novel therapeutic targets.","Zhang, Shaoyan; Sun, Rong; Perdoncini Carvalho, Camila; Han, Junping; Zheng, Limin; Qu, Feng",Journal of virology,105,5

No t-fastener-related complications, such as abscesses, fluid collections, or fistulae, were identified. CONCLUSIONS Following gastropexy for percutaneous transgastric feeding tube placement, t-fastener migration into the abdominal wall frequently occurred soon after the tube insertion. Therefore, recent t-fastener deployment does not guarantee an intact gastropexy.","Sydnor, Ryan H; Schriber, Stacey M; Kim, Charles Yoon",Gut and liver,105,33

Here we quantify the impact of 6,068 hierarchically coded NPIs implemented in 79 territories on the effective reproduction number, Rt, of COVID-19. We propose a modelling approach that combines four computational techniques merging statistical, inference and artificial intelligence tools. We validate our findings with two external datasets recording 42,151 additional NPIs from 226 countries. Our results indicate that a suitable combination of NPIs is necessary to curb the spread of the virus. Less disruptive and costly NPIs can be as effective as more intrusive, drastic, ones (for example, a national lockdown). Using country-specific 'what-if' scenarios, we assess how the effectiveness of NPIs depends on the local context such as timing of their adoption, opening the way for forecasting the effectiveness of future interventions.","Haug, Nils; Geyrhofer, Lukas; Londei, Alessandro; Dervic, Elma; Desvars-Larrive, Amélie; Loreto, Vittorio; Pinior, Beate; Thurner, Stefan; Klimek, Peter",Nature human behaviour,105,16

N-specific T cells were observed in SARS-CoV-2 N immunized mice and COVID-19 convalescents. It is of importance to identify the T cell responses triggered by SARS-CoV-2 N protein. Intradermal immunization with SARS-CoV N protein was demonstrated to elicit non-protective T cell responses which may be avoided by intranasal vaccination. Therefore, we conducted intranasal vaccination of BALB/c mice with recombinant adenovirus type-5 expressing SARS-CoV-2 N protein. Such procedure induced CD8 T cell responses in the lung. Meanwhile CD4 T cell responses were observed in the spleen, which was associated with robust antibody production. Our study further supports the notion that SARS-CoV-2 N protein can work as a target for vaccine development. This article is protected by copyright.

Physical distancing interventions and economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic have resulted in unprecedented reductions in many of the constraints on substance use and in critical evolutionarily salient sources of alternative reward, such as social interaction, physical activity, leisure activities and hobbies, and academic and occupational pursuits. Thus, behavioral economics suggests that the pandemic and necessary public health response have created a ""perfect storm"" for exacerbation of individual-level and population-level substance use problems and also points to multilevel intervention strategies. We summarize this perspective and research by highlighting 3 critical behavioral processes that will influence drug and alcohol consumption. First, the sudden absence of many effective constraints on substance use (work, school, community, or service obligations) will reduce the actual and perceived cost of use. Second, physical distancing measures will reduce the availability, and increase the cost, of many rewarding substance-free activities and commodities. Third, increased uncertainty around current and future events increases discounting of delayed rewards. These effects will be especially pernicious among populations with existing health disparities. Next, we outline interventions suggested by behavioral economics to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on substance use that are aimed at increasing perceived costs of use; increasing access to substance-free activities, including treatment; and lengthening the timeframe for behavioral allocation and altering environmental contexts to promote healthy choices.

However, the amount of literature on data quality challenges, specifically those for person-generated wearable device data, is sparse. OBJECTIVE This study aims to systematically review the literature on factors affecting the quality of person-generated wearable device data and their associated intrinsic data quality challenges for research. METHODS The literature was searched in the PubMed, Association for Computing Machinery, Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, and Google Scholar databases by using search terms related to wearable devices and data quality. By using PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines, studies were reviewed to identify factors affecting the quality of wearable device data. Studies were eligible if they included content on the data quality of wearable devices, such as fitness trackers and sleep monitors. Both research-grade and consumer-grade wearable devices were included in the review. Relevant content was annotated and iteratively categorized into semantically similar factors until a consensus was reached. If any data quality challenges were mentioned in the study, those contents were extracted and categorized as well. RESULTS A total of 19 papers were included in this review. We identified three high-level factors that affect data quality-device- and technical-related factors, user-related factors, and data governance-related factors. Device- and technical-related factors include problems with hardware, software, and the connectivity of the device; user-related factors include device nonwear and user error; and data governance-related factors include a lack of standardization. The identified factors can potentially lead to intrinsic data quality challenges, such as incomplete, incorrect, and heterogeneous data. Although missing and incorrect data are widely known data quality challenges for wearable devices, the heterogeneity of data is another aspect of data quality that should be considered for wearable devices. Heterogeneity in wearable device data exists at three levels: heterogeneity in data generated by a single person using a single device (within-person heterogeneity); heterogeneity in data generated by multiple people who use the same brand, model, and version of a device (between-person heterogeneity); and heterogeneity in data generated from multiple people using different devices (between-person heterogeneity), which would apply especially to data collected under a bring-your-own-device policy. CONCLUSIONS Our study identifies potential intrinsic data quality challenges that could occur when analyzing wearable device data for research and three major contributing factors for these challenges. As poor data quality can compromise the reliability and accuracy of research results, further investigation is needed on how to address the data quality challenges of wearable devices.","Cho, Sylvia; Ensari, Ipek; Weng, Chunhua; Kahn, Michael G; Natarajan, Karthik",JMIR mHealth and uHealth,105,1

Premature MI is a major contributor to cardiovascular disease (CVD), which claimed 17.6 million lives globally in 2016. Reducing premature MI and CVD is a key priority for all nations; however, there is sparse synthesis of information on risk factors associated with premature MI. To address this knowledge gap, we are conducting a systematic review to describe the association between risk factors (demographics, lifestyle factors and biomarkers) and premature MI. METHODS AND ANALYSIS The following databases were searched from inception to June 2018: CENTRAL, CINAHL, Clinical Trials, EMBASE and MEDLINE. We will include original research articles (case-control, cohort and cross-sectional studies) that report a quantitative relationship between at least one risk factor and premature MI. Two investigators will use predetermined selection criteria and independently screen articles based on title and abstract (primary screening). Articles that meet selection criteria will undergo full-text screening based on criteria used for primary screening (secondary screening). Data will be extracted using predetermined data extraction forms. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for case-control and cohort studies will be used to evaluate the risk of bias and will be adapted for cross-sectional studies. Whenever feasible, data will be summarised into a random-effects meta-analysis. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION To our knowledge, this will be the first study to synthesise results on the relationship between risk factors and premature MI. These findings will inform healthcare providers on factors associated with risk of premature MI and potentially improve primary prevention efforts by guiding development of interventions. These findings will be summarised and presented at conferences and through publication in a peer-reviewed journal.

One of the ER structures observed in plants is known as 'organised smooth endoplasmic reticulum' (OSER), consisting of symmetrically stacked ER membrane arrays. In plants, these structures were first described in certain specialised tissues, e.g. the sieve elements of the phloem, and more recently in transgenic plants overexpressing ER membrane resident proteins. To date, much of the investigation of OSER focused on yeast and animal cells but research into plant OSER has started to grow. In this update, we give a succinct overview of research into the OSER phenomenon in plant cells with case studies highlighting both native and synthetic occurrences of OSER. We also assess the primary driving forces that trigger the formation of OSER, collating evidence from the literature to compare two competing theories for the origin of OSER: that OSER formation is initiated by oligomerizing protein accumulation in the ER membrane or that OSER is the result of ER membrane proliferation. This has long been a source of controversy in the field and here we suggest a way to integrate arguments from both sides into a single unifying theory. Finally, we discuss the potential biotechnological uses of OSER as a tool for the nascent plant synthetic biology field with possible applications as a synthetic microdomain for metabolic engineering and as an extensive membrane surface for synthetic chemistry or protein accumulation.","Sandor, Andras; Fricker, Mark David; Kriechbaumer, Verena; Sweetlove, Lee J",Plant physiology,105,20

Progressive tension sutures (PTS) have been shown to be an effective approach to reduce the dead space by point-wise mechanical fixation, allowing for drain-free procedures. Lysine-derived urethane surgical adhesive provides an alternative approach for mechanical fixation and reduction of dead space, and may reduce surgery time compared to PTS. Objectives This prospective, controlled, single center clinical study compared progressive tension suture wound closure technique without drains (control) to tissue adhesive wound closure technique without drains (test) during abdominoplasty surgery. The objective was to determine if lysine-derived urethane surgical adhesive is an effective alternative to PTS for drain-free abdominoplasty procedures. Methods Patients undergoing abdominoplasty who met the established inclusion/exclusion criteria were consented and enrolled in the study. Ten PTS (control) cases were performed, followed immediately by 10 tissue adhesive (test) cases. Results Surgeries were completed over an 8-month period. No statistical differences were identified between the two groups with regard to age, BMI, dissection surface area or flap weight. No clinical seroma formation was observed in either group. In the control (PTS) group, two patients developed small areas of dermal closure suture abscess requiring removal of suture material. One control patient developed drainage and fat necrosis thought to be related to PTS above the incision and later required a scar revision. One tissue adhesive patient developed hypertrophic scars of both her breast reduction and abdominoplasty scars requiring additional treatment. Conclusions Lysine-derived urethane surgical adhesive was applied in less time than PTS, even after accounting for holding pressure for 5 minutes. The tissue adhesive provided four times the number of attachment points compared to PTS, although the significance of this is not clear. Based on these results, the use of lysine-derived urethane surgical adhesive was found to be a safe and effective alternative to PTS to reduce seroma formation in drain-free abdominoplasty procedures.

Methods As of April 1, 2020, 23 mothers confirmed with COVID-19, 15 mothers suspected with COVID-19 but with negative polymerase chain reaction tests, and 33 mothers without COVID-19 (Control Group) were recruited for a study from Hubei Province in China. The Maternal Postnatal Attachment Scale (MPAS), the Zung Self-rating Anxiety Scale, and the Zung Self-rating Depression Scale were applied to investigate the attachment of mothers to their neonates and the postpartum mental health of mothers within the first 3 months after delivery (between 20 to 89 days). Results The period of mother-child separation among the confirmed group (33.9±20.9 days) was significantly longer than that of suspected group (16.7±12.2 days) and control group (10.7±8.4 days). The total score of the MPAS in mothers confirmed with COVID-19 (45.5±4.2) was significantly lower (indicating less mother-child attachment) than that in the suspected (50.5±4.7) and control (48.8±4.6) groups. A negative correlation was noted between the mother-child separation time and the MPAS scores, including the subscale scores of attachment (MPAS acore: Spearman's ρ =-0.33, 95% CI: -0.095 to -0.538, P=0.005; Subscale score of attachment: Spearman's ρ =-0.40, 95% CI: -0.163 to -0.592, P=0.001). The incidence of postpartum anxiety in the confirmed, suspected and control groups was 4.3%, 6.7% and 12.1%, respectively; and the incidence of postpartum depression was 39.1%, 33.3% and 30.3%, respectively. No significant difference was found with regards to maternal postpartum anxiety and depression among the three groups. Conclusions Decreased mother-child attachment found among mothers confirmed with COVID-19, indicates that further intervention is needed to ensure mother-child interaction to appropriately develop attachment. Mother-child attachment experienced disruption due to prolonged mother-child separation necessitated by the COVID-19 management protocol, which needs to be revised to reduce prolonged mother-child separation. Additionally, mothers with and without COVID-19 suffered a high incidence of depression, which warrants further mental health investment for pregnant mothers during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Peng, Sicong; Zhang, Yi; Liu, Hongyan; Huang, Xiaona; Noble, Douglas James; Yang, Lixia; Lu, Wei; Luo, Yahui; Zhu, Huaping; Cao, Li; Liu, Chunhua; Chen, Yang; Zhang, Pei; Xia, Shiwen; Narayan, Anuradha",Annals of translational medicine,105,6

However, the timing of the magmatism in the Okinawa Trough (OT) is not well constrained by the age spectra of zircons. Here, for the first time, we carry out an integrated study combining in situ analysis of zircon U-Th-Pb and Hf-O isotopes, and trace element compositions of zircons from the volcanic rocks from the southernmost part of the OT. We found that the young (< 100 ka) zircons in these volcanic rocks have old (108 Ma to 2.7 Ga) inherited cores, which were captured as the magma ascended through the rifting continental crust. In particular, the inherited Archean zircons strongly suggest that remnants of the old East Asian continental blocks underlie the embryonic crustal rifting zone. Moreover, the ages of most of the inherited zircons correspond to five supercontinent amalgamation events. Specifically, the Archaean inherited zircons, which have positive εHf(t) and low δ18O values, correspond to the formation of juvenile continental crust. In contrast, the negative εHf(t) and high δ18O values of the post-Archaean inherited zircons indicate that their parental magma contained recycled older crust due to the enhanced crust-mantle interactions during the evolution of the early continental crust. Therefore, the inherited zircons in the back-arc volcanic rocks not only reflect the evolution of the local magmatism, but they also contain a record of the Archaean crustal fragment and of several global continental amalgamation events.","Zeng, Zhi-Gang; Chen, Zu-Xing; Zhang, Yu-Xiang",Scientific reports,105,24

Data Sources In June 2016 and January 2017, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PsycINFO databases were searched. Study Selection Cohort studies exploring preoperative predictors of stair climbing, walking speed, and gait speed measured ≥6 months after primary TKA were included. Screening of abstracts and selection of full texts were undertaken by 2 independent reviewers. Data Extraction Information on study design, patient characteristics, analysis, and results was extracted using pilot-tested forms. Two independent reviewers assessed risk of bias using modified Quality in Prognostic Studies criteria. Data Synthesis Of the eligible 12 studies involving 6 prospective cohorts, 10 studies reported information on baseline predictors. Meta-analysis of predictors was not possible because of missing information on effect size or standard errors. Narrative synthesis of evidence of predictors was therefore performed. Limitations The quality of evidence was low because of the risk of bias and heterogeneity of included studies as well as nonreporting of measures of effect. Conclusions Low-quality evidence exists for an association of preoperative functional ability and quadriceps muscle strength with functionality at 6 months after TKA. Improved reporting of predictor analyses is needed to enable evidence generation for clinical management.","Devasenapathy, Niveditha; Maddison, Ralph; Malhotra, Rajesh; Zodepy, Sanjay; Sharma, Saket; Belavy, Daniel L",Physical therapy,105,6
136820,136820,136820,Sequences of Previously Unknown Rhabdoviruses Detected in Bat Samples from the Republic of the Congo.,12.23128,7.517485,2021-05-19,"Reaction rates (fluxes) in a metabolic network can be analyzed using constraint-based modeling which imposes a steady state assumption on the system. In a deterministic formulation of the problem the steady state assumption has to be fulfilled exactly, and the observed fluxes are included in the model without accounting for experimental noise. One can relax the steady state constraint, and also include experimental noise in the model, through a stochastic formulation of the problem. Uniform sampling of fluxes, feasible in both the deterministic and stochastic formulation, can provide us with statistical properties of the metabolic network, such as marginal flux probability distributions. In this study we give an overview of both the deterministic and stochastic formulation of the problem, and of available Monte Carlo sampling methods for sampling the corresponding solution space. We apply the ACHR, OPTGP, CHRR and Gibbs sampling algorithms to ten metabolic networks and evaluate their convergence, consistency and efficiency. The coordinate hit-and-run with rounding (CHRR) is found to perform best among the algorithms suitable for the deterministic formulation. A desirable property of CHRR is its guaranteed distributional convergence. Among the three other algorithms, ACHR has the largest consistency with CHRR for genome scale models. For the stochastic formulation, the Gibbs sampler is the only method appropriate for sampling at genome scale. However, our analysis ranks it as less efficient than the samplers used for the deterministic formulation.","Fallahi, Shirin; Skaug, Hans J; Alendal, Guttorm",PloS one,105,33

Videofluoroscopic Swallow Study (VFSS) and Fiberoptic Endoscopic Evaluation of Swallowing (FEES) are the most objective studies to define swallowing function. The presence of tracheal aspiration during VFSS or FEES in children with dysphagia is associated with an increased risk of aspiration pneumonia. However, the association of laryngeal penetration with aspiration pneumonia remains unclear. This systematic review aims to assess the risk of aspiration pneumonia in children with dysphagia with laryngeal penetration on VFSS/FEES and compare it with children with tracheal aspiration and children with neither tracheal aspiration nor laryngeal penetration. METHODS AND ANALYSIS This study will be a systematic review and meta-analysis. Systematic electronic searches will be conducted on PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, CINHAL, Scopus, Cochrane CENTRAL, LILACS and WHO Global Index Medicus. We will include studies published through 6 October 2021. Primary outcome will be the incidence of aspiration pneumonia. Secondary outcomes will be incidence of hospitalisation, paediatric intensive care unit admission, enteral tube requirement, growth, symptoms improvement and mortality. The Cochrane Risk of Bias In Non-Randomised Studies of Interventions tool will be used to assess the risk of bias. Meta-analysis will be used to pool the studies. We will pool dichotomous outcomes to obtain an odd ratio (OR) and report with 95% CI. Continuous outcomes will be pooled to obtain mean difference and reported with 95% CI. Overall grade of evidence will be assessed using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria, and findings will be presented in a summary of findings table. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION This study is a systematic review without contact with patients. Therefore, IRB approval is not required. Authors consent to publishing this review. Data will be kept for review by editors and peer reviewers. Data will be available to general public on request.

Part 2: Inhibitors of intracellular life cycle.,12.123243,7.649347,2009,"Health advice for overweight patients in primary care has been a focus of obesity guidelines. Primary care doctors and nurses are well placed to provide evidence based preventive health advice. This literature review addressed two research questions: 'When do primary care doctors and nurses provide health advice for weight management?' and 'What health advice is provided to overweight patients in primary care settings?' The study was conducted in the first half of 2018 and followed Arksey and O'Malley (2005) five stage framework to conduct a comprehensive scoping review. The following databases were searched: Emcare, Ovid, Embase, The Cochrane library, Proquest family health, Health source (nursing academic), Joanna Briggs Institute EBP database, Medline, PubMed, Rural and remote, Proquest (nursing and allied health) and TRIP using search term parameters. Two hundred and forty-eight (248) articles were located and screened by two reviewers. Twenty-three research papers met the criteria and data were analysed using a content analysis method. The results show that primary care doctors and nurses are more likely to give advice as BMI increases and often miss opportunities to discuss weight with overweight patients. Body Mass Index (BMI) is often wrongly categorised as overweight, when in fact it is in the range of obese, or not recorded and when health advice is given, it can be of poor quality. Few studies on this topic included people under 40 years, practice nurses as the focus and those with a BMI of 25-29.9 without a risk factor. A 'toolkit' approach to improve advice and adherence to evidence based guidelines should be explored in future research.","Walsh, Kristina; Grech, Carol; Hill, Kathy",Preventive medicine reports,105,5

Multiplying the number of well-trained healthcare workers through innovative ways such as eLearning is highly recommended in solving this shortage. However, high heterogeneity of learning outcomes in eLearning systematic reviews reveals a lack of consistency and agreement on core learning outcomes in eLearning for medical education. In addition, there seems to be a lack of validity evidence for measurement instruments used in these trials. This undermines the credibility of these outcome measures and affects the ability to draw accurate and meaningful conclusions. The aim of this research is to address this issue by determining the choice of outcomes, measurement instruments and the prevalence of measurement instruments with validity evidence in randomised trials on eLearning for pre-registration medical education. METHODS We will conduct a systematic mapping and review to identify the types of outcomes, the kinds of measurement instruments and the prevalence of validity evidence among measurement instruments in eLearning randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in pre-registration medical education. The search period will be from January 1990 until August 2017. We will consider studies on eLearning for health professionals' education. Two reviewers will extract and manage data independently from the included studies. Data will be analysed and synthesised according to the aim of the review. DISCUSSION Appropriate choice of outcomes and measurement tools is essential for ensuring high-quality research in the field of eLearning and eHealth. The results of this study could have positive implications for other eHealth interventions, including (1) improving quality and credibility of eLearning research, (2) enhancing the quality of digital medical education and (3) informing researchers, academics and curriculum developers about the types of outcomes and validity evidence for measurement instruments used in eLearning studies. The protocol aspires to assist in the advancement of the eLearning research field as well as in the development of high-quality healthcare professionals' digital education.

The porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) emerged in the United States in 2013, causing severe economic damage to the pork industry. The primary goal of this study was to develop methods to reduce the lead time for serological assay development. An approach involving the computational prediction of diagnostic targets, followed by a rapid synthesis of antigens, was adopted to achieve this objective. To avoid cross-reactivity with other closely related swine coronaviruses, the N protein sequences of PEDV were analyzed to identify sequences unique to PEDV. The potential antigenicity of the identified sequence was predicted computationally using the Jameson-Wolf method. A sequence with a high antigenic index was rapidly synthesized using an in vitro transcription and translation system to yield the diagnostic antigen. The computationally designed enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was validated using 169 field sera, whose statuses were determined by a PEDV-specific immunofluorescence assay. Comparison of the computationally designed ELISA to a conventionally developed ELISA, using bacterially expressed N protein, and to the immunofluorescence assay showed a high degree of agreement among the three tests (mean kappa statistic, 0.842). The sensitivity and specificity, compared to the conventionally developed assay, were 90.62 and 95.18, respectively. Therefore, the described approach is useful in reducing the development time for serological assays in the face of an infectious disease outbreak.","Song, Yunfeng; Singh, Pankaj; Nelson, Eric; Ramamoorthy, Sheela",Journal of clinical microbiology,105,7

Alkaloids are considered to be responsible for its pharmacological effects. In this investigation, Huanglian and its six alkaloids (coptisine, epiberberine, berberine, jateorrhizine, palmatine and magnoflorine) were systematically evaluated for their inhibition of six cytochrome P450 isoforms (CYP1A2, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4) in human liver microsomes by the LC-MS/MS method. Huanglian showed the strongest inhibition of CYP2D6, followed by CYP1A2 and CYP3A4_T. The IC₅₀ values were 5.8 µg/mL, 36.8 µg/mL and 59.2 µg/mL, respectively. Of the constituents tested, coptisine and epiberberine showed strong inhibition of CYP2D6 with IC₅₀ values of 4.4 µM and 7.7 µM; berberine, jateorrhizine and palmatine showed weak inhibition of CYP2D6 with IC₅₀ values of 45.5 µM, 49.4 µM and 92.6 µM, respectively; jateorrhizine showed moderate inhibition of CYP3A4_T with an IC₅₀ value of 13.3 µM; coptisine showed weak inhibition of CYP1A2 with an IC₅₀ value of 37.3 µM. In addition, activation was observed in coptisine/CYP2C9 and palmatine/CYP2C9/CYP2C19. Other CYP450 isoforms were not affected markedly by the six alkaloids. In conclusion, Huanglian showed in vitro inhibition of CYP2D6, the inhibition might be contributed mostly by protoberberine alkaloids, especially coptisine and epiberberine. Herb-drug interactions may occur through the CYP2D6 inhibition.","Han, Yong-Long; Yu, Hong-Liang; Li, Dan; Meng, Xiang-Le; Zhou, Zhi-Yong; Yu, Qi; Zhang, Xiao-You; Wang, Fu-Jing; Guo, Cheng",Phytotherapy research : PTR,105,7

A total of 186 COVID-19 inpatients were enrolled in this multicentre retrospective analysis. Detailed clinical data of each patient were collected, and the factors that affected the duration of viral shedding were retrospectively analysed. The median duration of viral shedding in the 186 COVID-19 patients was 13 days. The median duration of viral shedding was 12 days in non-severe patients, and 17 days in severe patients, and there was a significant difference between the two groups (P<0.001). Multi-factor regression analysis suggested that the onset-hospitalization interval [odds ratio (OR), 1.27; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.15-1.41; P<0.001] and comorbidity with a chronic disease (OR, 2.43; 95% CI, 1.14-5.17; P=0.021) were independent risk factors for prolonged viral shedding, whereas lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) was an independent protective factor (OR, 0.28; 95% CI, 0.11-0.75; P=0.011). Spearman's rank correlation analysis showed that the onset-drug interval was positively correlated with the duration of viral shedding (r=0.446; P<0.0001). Umifenovir, and low and short courses of glucocorticoids were not associated with prolonged viral shedding. The prolonged viral shedding was the initial causative factor of persistent aggravation of the patient's conditions. The interval between presentation of symptoms and hospitalization as well as complications with a comorbid chronic disease were independent risk factors for prolonged viral shedding. LPV/r shortened the duration of viral shedding, and the smaller the interval between presentation and LPV/r onset was, the faster viral shedding occurred.","Pan, Yanfeng; Li, Qingqing; Yu, Xue; Luo, Qiankun; Qin, Tao; Xin, Ningbo; Zhang, Qian; Li, Xianyang; Du, Xinwei; Zhao, Qingxia; Sun, Li",Biomedical reports,105,1

This study aimed to explore the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic in non-COVID-19 patients with ESRD undergoing in-center hemodialysis (HD). A mixed-methods study was conducted with a purposive sample recruited from one dialysis unit in Portugal. Quantitative data were collected retrospectively from patients' medical records from February 2020 (T1-before the outbreak) and from April 2020 (T2-during lockdown). Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 20 patients (66.9 ± 11.9 years old) undergoing HD for an average of 46.1 months (±39.5) in April 2020. Overall results suggested that dialysis adequacy and serum albumin levels decreased significantly at T2, while phosphorus levels increased. The findings from thematic analysis suggested several psychosocial negative impacts and impacts on disease and treatment-related health behaviors (eg, difficulties managing dietary restrictions during the lockdown and diminished physical activity), which can partially explain these quantitative results. However, some patients were also able to find positive impacts in this experience and problem-focused and emotional strategies were identified to cope with the demands of COVID-19. Several recommendations have been made to mitigate patients' emotional, relational, and educational unmet needs during the current pandemic and in the event of new outbreaks.","Sousa, Helena; Ribeiro, Oscar; Costa, Elísio; Frontini, Roberta; Paúl, Constança; Amado, Leonilde; Miranda, Vasco; Ribeiro, Fernando; Figueiredo, Daniela",Seminars in dialysis,105,31

CLT has intuitive applicability to workplace settings, yet how CLT should inform teaching, learning, and research in health professions workplaces is unclear. METHOD To map the existing literature, we performed a scoping review of studies involving cognitive load, mental effort and/or mental workload in professional workplace settings within and outside of the health professions. We included actual and simulated workplaces and workplace tasks. RESULT Searching eight databases, we identified 4571 citations, of which 116 met inclusion criteria. Studies were most often quantitative. Methods to measure cognitive load included psychometric, physiologic, and secondary task approaches. Few covariates of cognitive load or performance were studied. Overall cognitive load and intrinsic load were consistently negatively associated with the level of experience and performance. Studies consistently found distractions and other aspects of workplace environments as contributing to extraneous load. Studies outside the health professions documented similar findings to those within the health professions, supporting relevance of CLT to workplace learning. CONCLUSION The authors discuss implications for workplace teaching, curricular design, learning environment, and metacognition. To advance workplace learning, the authors suggest future CLT research should address higher-level questions and integrate other learning frameworks.","Sewell, Justin L; Maggio, Lauren A; Ten Cate, Olle; van Gog, Tamara; Young, John Q; O'Sullivan, Patricia S",Medical teacher,105,1

This study aimed to define the impact of extraction incision length on the postoperative outcomes of laparoscopic left-sided colon and rectal resections. METHODS Consecutive patients undergoing laparoscopic left-sided colorectal resection from 1991 to 2007 were retrieved from a prospectively collected database. The association between incision length and patient characteristics, diagnosis, and perioperative outcomes were analyzed using logistic regression, Spearman correlation, Wilcoxon test, and chi-square test. RESULTS A total of 494 laparoscopic colorectal resections (left, sigmoid, anterior, and low anterior resections) were retrieved. Patients with conversions to open surgery (n = 59) and missing data (n = 53) were excluded. As a result, 382 cases were included in the study. A slight majority of the patients had malignant disease (n = 202, 53%). The median incision length was 5 cm (interquartile range, 4-6 cm). Increasing weight was positively correlated with incision length (p = 0.0001). Male patients had modestly larger mean incisions than female patients (5.5 vs. 5.0 cm; p = 0.0075). Age, previous surgery, diagnosis, days to resumption of normal diet, and days to discharge from hospital showed no significant relationship with incision length. No association was observed between the incision length and intraoperative or postoperative complications. CONCLUSIONS Patients undergoing laparoscopic colorectal surgery appear to achieve the same perioperative outcomes irrespective of their extraction incision lengths. To maintain the short-term benefits of laparoscopy, surgeons should consider pursuing a minimally invasive technique, even when a larger extraction incision will ultimately be required.","Bouchard, Alexandre; Martel, Guillaume; Sabri, Elham; Poulin, Eric C; Mamazza, Joseph; Boushey, Robin P",Surgical endoscopy,105,31

However, the relationship between IARS2 and melanoma is still unclear. To evaluate the role of IARS2 in melanoma, we constructed a stable A375 cell line with IARS2 knockdown via lentivirus-mediated small interfering RNAs. The expression of IARS2 was measured by real time-quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction and western blot analysis. Cell counting, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay, and colony formation assay were conducted to assess the effect of IARS2 on melanoma cell proliferation. Flow cytometry assay was used to determine cell apoptosis and cell cycle distribution in melanoma A375 cells. Finally, immunohistochemistry was employed to validate the expression of IARS2 protein in melanoma tissues. In this study it was found that IARS2 was highly expressed in melanoma cell lines. Furthermore, IARS2 protein also exhibited elevated expression in the tumour tissues obtained from melanoma patients. After suppression of the mRNA expression of IARS2, the proliferation and colony formation ability of the A375 cells were significantly inhibited, while the proportion of apoptotic A375 cells increased significantly, as indicated by an enhanced phosphatidylserine externalization and caspase 3/7 activity after IARS2 knockdown. Further investigations found that knockdown of IARS2 arrested cells in the G1 phase. The results suggested that IARS2 is critical for proliferation and apoptosis of melanoma cells.","Ma, Dongmei; Li, Song; Nie, Xiaojuan; Chen, Lamei; Chen, Nan; Hou, Dongsheng; Liu, Xiuhong; Gao, Binbin",Oncology letters,105,7

METHODOLOGY Bacterial samples from root canals associated with teeth having persistent apical periodontitis were taken from 24 patients undergoing root canal retreatment. Bacterial DNA was extracted, and V3-V4 variable regions of the 16S rRNA gene were amplified. The amplification was deep sequenced by Illumina technology to establish the metagenetic relationships among the bacterial species identified. The composition and diversity of microbial communities in the root canal and their relationships with clinical features were analysed. Parametric and nonparametric tests were used to analyse differences between patient characteristics and microbial data. RESULTS A total of 86 different operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were identified and Good's nonparametric coverage estimator method indicated that 99.9 ± 0.00001% diversity was recovered per sample. The largest number of bacteria belonged to the phylum Proteobacteria. According to the medical history from the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) Classification System, ASA II-III had higher richness estimates and distinct phylogenetic relationships compared to ASA I individuals (P < 0.05). Periapical index (PAI) score 5 was associated with increased microbiota diversity in comparison to PAI score 4, and this index was reduced in symptomatic patients.

As barriers to adoption of telemedicine are rapidly decreasing, it is important to recognize the need for practical and immediately deployable information that can improve doctor-patient interactions, facilitate accurate documentation, and increase confidence in the transition to virtual visits. In this article we aim to outline the components of an outpatient telemedicine visit for physiatrists with a particular focus on an adapted virtual physical examination. Uses of telemedicine may include future largescale concerns such as natural disasters or climate change. We describe a general approach to the visit, review definitions of terms commonly used in telemedicine, and offer tips for optimizing the encounter. This article is protected by copyright.

An essential component of this procedure is the pre-transplant conditioning regimen, which should facilitate engraftment and reduce or eliminate tumor cells. The recognition of the substantial association of a graft-versus- tumor effect and the high toxicity of the commonly used conditioning regimen led to the introduction of more differentiated intensity strategies, with the aim of making hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation less toxic and safer, and thus more applicable to broader populations such as older or unfit patients. In general, prospective and retrospective studies suggest a correlation between increasing intensity and nonrelapse mortality and an inverse correlation with relapse incidence. In this review, we will summarize traditional and updated definitions for conditioning intensity strategies and the landscape of comparative prospective and retrospective studies, which may help to find the balance between the risk of non-relapse mortality and relapse. We will try to underscore the caveats regarding these definitions and analyses, by missing complex differences between intensity and toxicity as well as the broad influences of other factors in the transplantation procedure. We will summarize evidence regarding several confounders which may influence decisions when selecting the intensity of the conditioning regimen for any given patient, according to the individual risk of relapse and non-relapse mortality.","Gagelmann, Nico; Kröger, Nicolaus",Haematologica,105,19

Since 2013, the concentration decline of CFC-11 slowed unexpectedly owing to increasing emissions, probably from unreported production, which, if sustained, would delay the recovery of the stratospheric ozone layer1-12. Here we report an accelerated decline in the global mean CFC-11 concentration during 2019 and 2020, derived from atmospheric concentration measurements at remote sites around the world. We find that global CFC-11 emissions decreased by 18 ± 6 gigagrams per year (26 ± 9 per cent; one standard deviation) from 2018 to 2019, to a 2019 value (52 ± 10 gigagrams per year) that is similar to the 2008-2012 mean. The decline in global emissions suggests a substantial decrease in unreported CFC-11 production. If the sharp decline in unexpected global emissions and unreported production is sustained, any associated future ozone depletion is likely to be limited, despite an increase in the CFC-11 bank (the amount of CFC-11 produced, but not yet emitted) by 90 to 725 gigagrams by the beginning of 2020.","Montzka, Stephen A; Dutton, Geoffrey S; Portmann, Robert W; Chipperfield, Martyn P; Davis, Sean; Feng, Wuhu; Manning, Alistair J; Ray, Eric; Rigby, Matthew; Hall, Bradley D; Siso, Carolina; Nance, J David; Krummel, Paul B; Mühle, Jens; Young, Dickon; O'Doherty, Simon; Salameh, Peter K; Harth, Christina M; Prinn, Ronald G; Weiss, Ray F; Elkins, James W; Walter-Terrinoni, Helen; Theodoridi, Christina",Nature,105,16

Although the essential factors known for AM development have been identified, currently an optimal in vitro culture system that can be used for studying the development and functions of AMs is still lacking. In this study, we report the development of an optimized culture system for generating AM-like cells from adult mouse bone marrow and fetal liver cells on in vitro culture in the presence of a combination of GM-CSF, TGF-β, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPAR-γ) agonist rosiglitazone. These AM-like cells expressed typical AM surface markers sialic acid-binding Ig-like lectin-F (Siglec-F), CD11c, and F4/80, and AM-specific genes, including carbonic anhydrase 4 (Car4), placenta-expressed transcript 1 (Plet1), eosinophil-associated RNase A family member 1 (Ear1), cell death-inducing DNA fragmentation factor A-like effector c (Cidec), and cytokeratin 19 (Krt19). Similar to primary AMs, the AM-like cells expressed alternative macrophage activation signature genes and self-renewal genes. Moreover, this culture system could be used for expansion of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid-derived AMs in vitro. The AM-like cells generated from bone marrow resembled the expanded bronchoalveolar lavage fluid-derived AMs in inflammatory responses and phagocytic activity. More importantly, these AM-like cells could be obtained in sufficient numbers that allowed genetic manipulation and functional analysis in vitro. Taken together, we provide a powerful tool for studying the biology of AMs.","Luo, Maocai; Lai, Wenlong; He, Zhimin; Wu, Li",Journal of immunology,105,1

Monitoring of driving pressure during assisted ventilation, similar to controlled ventilation, could be a tool to identify patients at risk of ventilator-induced lung injury. The aim of this study was to describe driving pressure over time and to identify whether and when high driving pressure occurs in critically ill patients during assisted ventilation. METHODS Sixty-two patients fulfilling criteria for assisted ventilation were prospectively studied. Patients were included when the treating physician selected proportional assist ventilation (PAV+), a mode that estimates respiratory system compliance. In these patients, continuous recordings of all ventilator parameters were obtained for up to 72 h. Driving pressure was calculated as tidal volume-to-respiratory system compliance ratio. The distribution of driving pressure and tidal volume values over time was examined, and periods of sustained high driving pressure (≥ 15 cmH2O) and of stable compliance were identified and analyzed. RESULTS The analysis included 3200 h of ventilation, consisting of 8.8 million samples. For most (95%) of the time, driving pressure was < 15 cmH2O and tidal volume < 11 mL/kg (of ideal body weight). In most patients, high driving pressure was observed for short periods of time (median 2.5 min). Prolonged periods of high driving pressure were observed in five patients (8%). During the 661 periods of stable compliance, high driving pressure combined with a tidal volume ≥ 8 mL/kg was observed only in 11 cases (1.6%) pertaining to four patients. High driving pressure occurred almost exclusively when respiratory system compliance was low, and compliance above 30 mL/cmH2O excluded the presence of high driving pressure with 90% sensitivity and specificity. CONCLUSIONS In critically ill patients fulfilling criteria for assisted ventilation, and ventilated in PAV+ mode, sustained high driving pressure occurred in a small, yet not negligible number of patients. The presence of sustained high driving pressure was not associated with high tidal volume, but occurred almost exclusively when compliance was below 30 mL/cmH2O.","Vaporidi, Katerina; Psarologakis, Charalambos; Proklou, Athanasia; Pediaditis, Emmanouil; Akoumianaki, Evangelia; Koutsiana, Elisavet; Chytas, Achilleas; Chouvarda, Ioanna; Kondili, Eumorfia; Georgopoulos, Dimitris",Annals of intensive care,105,24

Hand washing is the primary barrier to prevent transmission of enteric pathogens via cross-contamination from infected persons. Conventional hand washing involves the use of water, soap, and friction to remove dirt and microorganisms. The availability of hand sanitizing products for use when water and soap are unavailable has increased in recent years. The aim of this systematic review was to collate scientific information on the efficacy of hand sanitizers compared with washing hands with soap and water for the removal of foodborne pathogens from the hands of food handlers. An extensive literature search was carried out using three electronic databases: Web of Science, Scopus, and PubMed. Twenty-eight scientific publications were ultimately included in the review. Analysis of this literature revealed various limitations in the scientific information owing to the absence of a standardized protocol for evaluating the efficacy of hand products and variation in experimental conditions. However, despite conflicting results, scientific evidence seems to support the historical skepticism about the use of waterless hand sanitizers in food preparation settings. Water and soap appear to be more effective than waterless products for removal of soil and microorganisms from hands. Alcohol-based products achieve rapid and effective inactivation of various bacteria, but their efficacy is generally lower against nonenveloped viruses. The presence of food debris significantly affects the microbial inactivation rate of hand sanitizers.","Foddai, Antonio C G; Grant, Irene R; Dean, Moira",Journal of food protection,105,19

This includes surveillance systems for zoonoses, where enhanced cross-sectoral integration and sharing of information are seen as key to improved public health outcomes. Yet, there is a lack of evidence on the economic returns of such collaboration, particularly in the development and implementation of surveillance programmes. The economic assessment of surveillance in this context needs to be underpinned by the understanding of the links between zoonotic disease surveillance in animal populations and the wider public health disease mitigation process and how these relations impact on the costs and benefits of the surveillance activities. This study presents a conceptual framework of these links as a basis for the economic assessment of cross-sectoral zoonoses surveillance with the aim of supporting the prioritization of resource allocation to surveillance. In the proposed framework, monetary, non-monetary and intermediate or intangible cost components and benefit streams of three conceptually distinct stages of zoonotic disease mitigation are identified. In each stage, as the final disease mitigation objective varies so does the use of surveillance information generated in the animal populations for public health decision-making. Consequently, the associated cost components and benefit streams also change. Building on the proposed framework and taking into account these links, practical steps for its application are presented and future challenges are discussed.","Babo Martins, S; Rushton, J; Stärk, K D C",Zoonoses and public health,105,15

Whilst much has been published on one-to-one video consultations, little literature exists on use of this technology to facilitate group interventions. Group pain management programmes are a core treatment provided by many pain services. This rapid review aimed to identify the extent of use of video conferencing technology for delivery of group pain management programmes and provide an overview of its use. Methods A rapid review of the literature published up to April 2020 (PubMed, PsycINFO and PEDro) was performed. The search string consisted of three domains: pain/CP (MeSH term) AND Peer group[MeSH] AND Videoconferencing[MeSH]/Telemedicine[MeSH]/Remote Consultation[MeSH]. The studies were of poor methodological quality and study design, and interventions and chronic pain conditions were varied. Results Literature searching yielded three eligible papers for this review. All studies had low methodological quality and risk of bias. Heterogeneity and variability in outcome reporting did not allow any pooling of data. The results demonstrated that videoconferencing for delivery of group programmes is possible, yet there is little extant literature on how to develop, deliver and measure outcomes of such programmes. Conclusions This review demonstrates that there is little evidence to support or guide the use of synchronous videoconferencing to deliver pain management programmes. We present issues to consider, informed by this review and our experience, when implementing video conferencing.

Understanding institutional volume patterns allows training directors to create a schedule that maximizes learning opportunities while also adequately staffing the ED. Our primary objective of this study was to utilize heat-mapping software to optimize resident staffing in an academic ED. Methods Heat-mapping tools within Microsoft Excel were utilized to overlay ED patient arrival patterns on top of the potential patients per hour based on published productivity data for trainees and historical averages for advanced practice providers at our institution. Time frames for under- and overstaffing were identified and color-coded. This analysis informed a revised schedule template and the same heat-mapping process was used to determine the appropriateness of the revised staffing template. Results The heat map for the original schedule template revealed understaffing in the morning and overstaffing the rest of the day. Informed by these findings, schedule adjustments were made. There was no net increase in the number of resident or advanced practice provider coverage hours. Prior to implementation, the ED was understaffed by 5% or more during 18.4% of operating hours. Following changes to the staffing template, only 5.9% of operating hours were understaffed (p < 0.001). Furthermore, significant understaffing (20% or more) decreased from 16.6% to 3.1% (p < 0.001). Conclusions Novel use of heat-mapping software has the potential to successfully match ED patient arrival patterns to an optimal resident staffing template.

This study aimed to investigate the impact of treatment (radiation therapy ± concurrent chemotherapy) on (i) muscle strength, muscle cross-sectional area and patient-reported outcomes, and (ii) central and peripheral alterations during a whole-body exercise task. METHODS Ten people with head and neck cancer (4 female; 50 ± 9 years) completed a lab visit before and after (56 ± 30 days) completion of treatment. Participants performed a neuromuscular assessment (involving maximal isometric voluntary contractions in the knee extensors and electrical stimulation of the femoral nerve) before and during intermittent cycling to volitional exhaustion. Anthropometrics and patient-reported outcomes were also assessed. RESULTS From before to after treatment, maximal isometric muscle strength was reduced (P = 0.002, d = 0.73), as was potentiated twitch force (P < 0.001, d = 0.62), and muscle cross-sectional area (e.g., vastus lateralis: P = 0.010, d = 0.64). Exercise time was reduced (P = 0.008, d = 0.62) and peripheral processes contributed to a reduction in maximal force due to cycling. After treatment, the severity of self-reported fatigue increased (P = 0.041, r = - 0.65) and health-related quality of life decreased (P = 0.012, r = - 0.79). CONCLUSION Neuromuscular function was impaired in patients with head and neck cancer after treatment. Whole-body exercise tolerance was reduced and resulted in predominantly peripheral, rather than central, disturbances to the neuromuscular system. Future research should evaluate strength training after treatment for head and neck cancer, with the overall aim of reducing fatigue and improving health-related quality of life.","Lavigne, Colin; Lau, Harold; Francis, George; Culos-Reed, S Nicole; Millet, Guillaume Y; Twomey, Rosie",European journal of applied physiology,105,1

Fatty acid composition, and vitamin and carotenoid concentrations in the milk samples were determined. In Central and Tokachi areas, corn silage was used as the main forage. In North area, fresh herbage was the dominant feed in the summer season, and grass hay was the main feed in the winter season. Discriminant analysis revealed that the composition of milk samples differed among the areas and seasons. Milk from Central and Tokachi areas contained a higher ratio of linoleic acid compared with that from North area, but there were only slight differences in the composition of milk between Central and Tokachi areas.

Objective To describe the clinical characteristics and geographic and temporal distribution of the largest cohort of patients with MIS-C in the United States to date. Design, Setting, and Participants Cross-sectional analysis was conducted on clinical and laboratory data collected from patients with MIS-C. The analysis included patients with illness onset from March 2020 to January 2021 and met MIS-C case definition. Main Outcomes and Measures Geographic and temporal distribution of MIS-C was compared with that of COVID-19 nationally, by region, and level of urbanicity by county. Clinical and laboratory findings and changes over time were described by age group and by presence or absence of preceding COVID-19. Results A total of 1733 patients with MIS-C were identified; 994 (57.6%) were male and 1117 (71.3%) were Hispanic or non-Hispanic Black. Gastrointestinal symptoms, rash, and conjunctival hyperemia were reported by 53% (n = 931) to 67% (n = 1153) of patients. A total of 937 patients (54%) had hypotension or shock, and 1009 (58.2%) were admitted for intensive care. Cardiac dysfunction was reported in 484 patients (31.0%), pericardial effusion in 365 (23.4%), myocarditis in 300 (17.3%), and coronary artery dilatation or aneurysms in 258 (16.5%). Patients aged 0 to 4 years had the lowest proportion of severe manifestations, although 171 patients (38.4%) had hypotension or shock and 197 (44.3%) were admitted for intensive care. Patients aged 18 to 20 years had the highest proportions with myocarditis (17 [30.9%]), pneumonia (20 [36.4%]), acute respiratory distress syndrome (10 [18.2%]), and polymerase chain reaction positivity (39 [70.9%]). These older adolescents also had the highest proportion reporting preceding COVID-19-like illness (63%). Nationally, the first 2 MIS-C peaks followed the COVID-19 peaks by 2 to 5 weeks. The cumulative MIS-C incidence per 100 000 persons younger than 21 years was 2.1 and varied from 0.2 to 6.3 by state. Twenty-four patients (1.4%) died. Conclusions and Relevance In this cross-sectional study of a large cohort of patients with MIS-C, 2 peaks that followed COVID-19 peaks by 2 to 5 weeks were identified. The geographic and temporal association of MIS-C with the COVID-19 pandemic suggested that MIS-C resulted from delayed immunologic responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection. The clinical manifestations varied by age and by presence or absence of preceding COVID-19.","Belay, Ermias D; Abrams, Joseph; Oster, Matthew E; Giovanni, Jennifer; Pierce, Timmy; Meng, Lu; Prezzato, Emily; Balachandran, Neha; Openshaw, John J; Rosen, Hilary E; Kim, Moon; Richardson, Gillian; Hand, Julie; Tobin-D'Angelo, Melissa; Wilson, Siri; Hartley, Amanda; Jones, Cassandra; Kolsin, Jonathan; Mohamed, Hani; Colles, Zachary; Hammett, Teresa; Patel, Pragna; Stierman, Bryan; Campbell, Angela P; Godfred-Cato, Shana",JAMA pediatrics,105,16

Diagnosis can usually be made with radiography and ultrasonography; however, in some cases, these techniques are inconclusive and additional imaging is necessary. No studies describing computed tomography (CT) features of different tarsal lesions in horses with tarsal lameness are reported. OBJECTIVES Our aims were as follows: 1) to characterise CT abnormalities in horses with tarsal lameness; 2) to compare CT findings with those from other imaging techniques; and 3) to assess whether CT can help to diagnose tarsal pathology. STUDY DESIGN Retrospective case series. METHODS Computed tomography of the tarsus was performed on 15 horses (n = 17 joints) with tarsal lameness. The horses were divided into 3 groups depending on the reason for CT examination, as follows: 1) other imaging techniques were inconclusive; 2) evaluation of a fracture; or 3) other imaging techniques showed tarsal lesions, and CT was performed to assess whether additional lesions were present. RESULTS Group 1 included 7 horses. Lesions detected with CT included subchondral cyst-like lesions (2 horses); an osteolytic lesion in the cochlea tibiae (one horse); degenerative changes of the distal tarsal joints (2 horses); osteolytic lesions tarsometatarsal joint (one horse); and sclerosis of the third tarsal bone with a lesion of the tarsometatarsal interosseous ligament (one horse). In this group, CT provided information on the character and extent of the lesion that was not available with other imaging techniques. Computed tomography revealed more information about the extent and complexity of the fracture than radiography in Group 2, whereas CT did not provide extra information in Group 3. CONCLUSIONS Focal lesions located between the tarsal bone surfaces are difficult or even impossible to detect with radiography and ultrasonography, but they can be detected and characterised with CT. POTENTIAL RELEVANCE Computed tomography of the tarsus should be considered when radiography and ultrasonography are inconclusive, or for further evaluation of tarsal fractures.","Raes, E; Bergman, H J; Van Ryssen, B; Vanderperren, K; Stock, E; Saunders, J H",Equine veterinary journal,105,1

Failure may be due to the lack of consideration for the complexity of dose and its articulation within research trials. Prior to commencing the scoping review, we identified two research gaps to be addressed. Firstly, transparent application of a multidimensional definition of dose to clinical trial phases and secondly, the development of a quality tool to critique the articulation of dose across the pipeline. Building on this, we present the protocol for a scoping review that aims to synthesis what is known about dose articulation in stroke recovery in preclinical and clinical populations, and characterize research designs and statistical approaches used in dose articulation trials, and the associated advantages and disadvantages. Methods: The scoping review will apply Arksey and O'Malley's methodological framework. Two systematic searches that target preclinical and clinical literature will be run in Medline and Embase, which will be complimented by consultation with field experts and hand searching of included trials and relevant reviews. Search results will be imported into Covidence for transparent management. One reviewer will screen all abstracts and titles. Two reviewers will screen full text and a third reviewer included to resolve discrepancies. A standardized data charting form will be used to extract information and appraise the intervention description, risk of bias, and quality of both preclinical and clinical studies. Results will be summarized in tabular and narrative format to inform the development of recommendations for future research. Ethics approval is not required as data used will be secondary and de-identified.

The most appropriate management of culture-negative PJI is not known, and there is immense variability in the treatment outcome of this condition. The purpose of this study was to elucidate the characteristics, outcomes, and risk factors for failure of treatment of culture-negative PJI. Methods A retrospective review of 219 patients (138 hips and 81 knees) who had undergone surgery for the treatment of culture-negative PJI was performed utilizing a prospectively collected institutional PJI database. PJIs for which the results of culture were unavailable were excluded. An electronic query and manual review of the medical records were completed to obtain patient demographics, treatment, microbiology data, comorbidities, and other surgical characteristics. Treatment failure was assessed using the Delphi consensus criteria. Results The prevalence of suspected culture-negative PJI was 22.0% (219 of 996), and the prevalence of culture-negative PJI as defined by the Musculoskeletal Infection Society (MSIS) was 6.4% (44 of 688). Overall, the rate of treatment success was 69.2% (110 of 159) in patients with >1 year of follow-up. Of the 49 culture-negative PJIs for which treatment failed, 26 (53.1%) subsequently had positive cultures; of those 26, 10 (38.5%) were positive for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus. The rate of treatment success was greater (p = 0.019) for patients who had 2-stage exchange than for those who underwent irrigation and debridement. Conclusions The present study demonstrates that culture-negative PJI is a relatively frequent finding with unacceptable rates of treatment failure. Every effort should be made to isolate the infecting organism prior to surgical intervention, including extending the incubation period for cultures, withholding antibiotics prior to obtaining culture specimens, and possibly using newly introduced molecular techniques.

OBJECTIVE After improvements in thrombectomy methods, to reassess whether this relationship holds true with a more contemporary thrombectomy approach: a direct aspiration first pass technique (ADAPT). METHODS We retrospectively studied a database of patients with AIS who underwent ADAPT thrombectomy for large vessel occlusions. Patients were dichotomized into two groups: 'early recan', in which recanalization (recan) was achieved in ≤35 min, and 'late recan', in which procedures extended beyond 35 min. RESULTS 197 patients (47.7% women, mean age 66.3 years) were identified. We determined that after 35 min, a poor outcome was more likely than a good (modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score 0-2) outcome. The baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score was similar between 'early recan' (n=122) (14.7±6.9) and 'late recan' patients (n=75) (15.9±7.2). Among 'early recan' patients, recanalization was achieved in 17.8±8.8 min compared with 70±39.8 min in 'late recan' patients. The likelihood of achieving a good outcome was higher in the 'early recan' group (65.2%) than in the 'late recan' group (38.2%; p<0.001). Patients in the 'late recan' group had a higher likelihood of postprocedural hemorrhage, specifically parenchymal hematoma type 2, than those in the 'early recan' group. Logistic regression analysis showed that baseline NIHSS, recanalization time, and atrial fibrillation had a significant impact on 90-day outcomes. CONCLUSIONS Our findings suggest that extending ADAPT thrombectomy procedure times beyond 35 min increases the likelihood of complications such as intracerebral hemorrhage while reducing the likelihood of a good outcome.","Alawieh, Ali; Pierce, Alyssa K; Vargas, Jan; Turk, Aquilla S; Turner, Raymond D; Chaudry, M Imran; Spiotta, Alejandro M",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,105,17

Accurate noninvasive alternatives to DSA for follow-up after Pipeline Embolization Device treatment are desirable. This study evaluated the accuracy of contrast-enhanced time-resolved MRA for this purpose, hypothesizing that contrast-enhanced time-resolved MRA will be comparable with DSA and superior to 3D-TOF MRA. MATERIALS AND METHODS During a 24-month period, 37 Pipeline Embolization Device-treated intracranial aneurysms in 26 patients underwent initial follow-up by using 3D-TOF MRA, contrast-enhanced time-resolved MRA, and DSA. MRA was performed on a 1.5T unit by using 3D-TOF and time-resolved imaging of contrast kinetics. All patients underwent DSA a median of 0 days (range, 0-68) after MRA. Studies were evaluated for aneurysm occlusion, quality of visualization of the reconstructed artery, and measurable luminal diameter of the Pipeline Embolization Device, with DSA used as the reference standard. RESULTS The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of contrast-enhanced time-resolved MRA relative to DSA for posttreatment aneurysm occlusion were 96%, 85%, 92%, and 92%. Contrast-enhanced time-resolved MRA demonstrated superior quality of visualization (P = .0001) and a higher measurable luminal diameter (P = .0001) of the reconstructed artery compared with 3D-TOF MRA but no significant difference compared with DSA. Contrast-enhanced time-resolved MRA underestimated the luminal diameter of the reconstructed artery by 0.965 ± 0.497 mm (27% ± 13%) relative to DSA. CONCLUSIONS Contrast-enhanced time-resolved MRA is a reliable noninvasive method for monitoring intracranial aneurysms following flow diversion and vessel reconstruction by using the Pipeline Embolization Device.","Boddu, S R; Tong, F C; Dehkharghani, S; Dion, J E; Saindane, A M",AJNR.

Therefore, mental health promotion (MHP) initiatives are advocated. In 2014, the ABCs of mental health (ABCs) partnership was established in Denmark; in the partnership, partner organisations, e.g., municipalities and NGOs, use a research-based framework for MHP, the ABC-framework, to develop and implement MHP initiatives. This paper has two aims: (1) to outline the overall characteristics of these MHP initiatives; and (2) to explore local coordinator and stakeholder perceptions of the implementation processes and the impact of the MHP initiatives. Questionnaire surveys, individual interviews and group interviews were conducted during 2017-2020. The MHP initiatives were grouped according to three strategies: building MHP capacity, campaign activities to promote mental health awareness and knowledge and establishing and promoting opportunities to engage in mentally healthy activities. The ABC-framework was positively received and viewed as providing relevant knowledge for working with MHP as well as fostering intersectoral and interprofessional collaborations. However, using a bottom-up approach to develop and implement MHP initiatives can be time-consuming and resource demanding, and it requires a deliberate balancing of local adaptability and concrete guidance when engaging stakeholders and implementers. Overall, using the ABC-framework to develop and implement MHP initiatives holds great promise for advancing and promoting MHP practice.","Hinrichsen, Carsten; Koushede, Vibeke Jenny; Madsen, Katrine Rich; Nielsen, Line; Ahlmark, Nanna Gram; Santini, Ziggi Ivan; Meilstrup, Charlotte",International journal of environmental research and public health,105,24

We developed a custom gene expression panel, which could provide a snapshot of gene expression variation under challenging conditions. Ileum gene expression studies were performed through high throughput reverse transcription quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. A deep review on the bibliography was done and genes related to intestinal health were selected for barrier function, immune response, oxidation, digestive hormones, nutrient transport, and metabolism. The panel was firstly tested by using a nutritional/Clostridium perfringens model of intestinal barrier failure (induced using commercial reused litter and wheat-based diets without exogenous supplementation of enzymes) and the consistency of results was evaluated by another experiment under a coccidiosis challenge (orally gavaged with a commercial coccidiosis vaccine, 90× vaccine dose). Growth traits and intestinal morphological analysis were performed to check the gut barrier failure occurrence. Results of ileum gene expression showed a higher expression in genes involved in barrier function and nutrient transport in chickens raised in healthy conditions, while genes involved in immune response presented higher expression in C.perfringens-challenged birds. On the other hand, the Eimeria challenge also altered the expression of genes related to barrier function and metabolism, and increased the expression of genes related to immune response and oxidative stress. The panel developed in the current study gives us an overview of genes and pathways involved in broiler response to pathogen challenge. It also allows us to deep into the study of differences in gene expression pattern and magnitude of responses under either a coccidial vaccine or a NE.","Criado-Mesas, L; Abdelli, N; Noce, A; Farré, M; Pérez, J F; Solà-Oriol, D; Martin-Venegas, R; Forouzandeh, A; González-Solé, F; Folch, J M",Scientific reports,105,1

Patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in hemodialysis facilities require specific protocols to be planned and promptly executed for the management of suspected/confirmed cases of COVID-19 with respect to prevention, protection, screening, and isolation. MATERIALS AND METHODS In order to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in our Hemodialysis Unit, we adopted individual protection measures accompanied by measures to minimize contacts among hemodialysis patients with suspicious symptoms as well as other patients and medical staff. We provided our patients detailed instructions to be followed in the event of their having symptoms compatible with SARS-CoV-2 infection or having contacts with SARS-CoV-2-positive subjects. Ultimately, four possible scenarios and care paths were developed and implemented in collaboration with the Infectious Diseases and Emergency Units at the Padua University Hospital. RESULTS The application of this strategy has resulted in the nearly 200 patients treated in our hemodialysis facilities while there were only 2 cases of COVID-19 (1% incidence rate) with no deaths. CONCLUSION We attribute the low COVID-19 incidence noted so far for patients in our hemodialysis facilities to the early detection and prompt isolation of suspected patients per our specific plan along with the prompt application of preventive measures.","Dian, Silvia; Simeone, Monica; Rossi, Barbara; Scaparrotta, Giuseppe; Fragasso, Antonio; Carretta, Giovanni; Capizzi, Alfio; Donato, Daniele; Cianci, Vito; Cattelan, Anna Maria; Calò, Lorenzo A",Clinical nephrology,105,1

Presently, discussions are mostly concerned with the importance of achieving CE and the benefits associated therewith, with the various barriers surrounding its implementation being less debated. Understanding the context in which circularity can flourish is a prerequisite in building the capabilities to deal with the multi-faceted challenges that currently hamper progress in closing the material, component and product loops. In this study, we discuss the importance of systems thinking in understanding the way resource recovery systems operate, and in promoting deep transformational change. We suggest that transformational change needs to go beyond closing materials, components and products (MCPs) loops, and promote sustainability in the way resources are exploited, used and managed throughout the system. By adopting a system of systems approach, we postulate that there are five interconnected sub-systems that need to be considered for supporting transitions to CE, namely, resource flows and provisioning service; governance, regulatory framework and political landscape; business activities and the marker; infrastructure and innovation; and user practices. This holistic approach provides a useful means to cutting through systemic complexity, and focuses on the dynamics between processes, values and actors in the value chain, and their dependence on cultural, spatial and temporal characteristics. We conclude that a systems-based approach can build up the capabilities required to identify and understand persistent linear trends and, in turn, support forward-thinking and time investment in enabling sustainable transitions. This, in turn, can help to align priorities and transform our current practices, speeding up the process of closing the MCP loops in a sustainable manner.

The modifications ensure an increased molecular and functional diversity at protein- and peptide-level. Prohormones are small pro-proteins that are expressed in many cell types, for instance endocrine cells, immune cells, myocytes and neurons. Here they mature to bioactive peptides (cytokines, hormones, growth factors, and neurotransmitters) that are released from the cells in an often regulated manner. The posttranslational processing of prohormones is cell-specific, however, and may vary during evolution and disease. Therefore, it is often inadequate to measure just a single peptide fragment as marker of endocrine, immune, and neuronal functions. In order to meet this challenge, we developed years back a simple ""processing-independent analysis"" (PIA) for accurate quantification of the total pro-protein product - irrespective of the degree and nature of the posttranslational processing.

Research has demonstrated a gender-specific response of cardiomyocytes to ischemia and a potential increase in myocardial salvage in women compared with men. Myocardial blush grade (MBG), an angiographic surrogate of myocardial perfusion, is an independent predictor of early and late survival after AMI. Whether the incidence and prognosis of myocardial perfusion differs according to gender among patients with AMI undergoing PCI is unknown. MBG and short- and long-term mortality were evaluated in 1,301 patients (male = 935; female = 366) with AMI randomized to primary angioplasty ± abciximab versus stent ± abciximab. Following PCI, >96% of patients achieved final Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction 3 flow, of which MBG 2/3 was present in 58.3% of women versus 51.1% of men (p = 0.02). Worse MBG was an independent predictor of mortality in women at 30 days (7.4% for MBG 0/1 vs 2.4% for MBG 2/3, p = 0.04) and at 1-year (11.0% for MBG 0/1 vs 3.4% for MBG 2/3, p = 0.01); however, MBG was not associated with differences in mortality for men. In conclusion, impaired myocardial perfusion following PCI for AMI, indicated by worse MBG, is an independent predictor of early and late mortality in women but not in men. These findings imply an enhanced survival benefit from restoring myocardial perfusion for women compared with men during primary angioplasty and may have clinical implications for interventional strategies in women.","Meller, Stephanie M; Lansky, Alexandra J; Costa, Ricardo A; Soffler, Morgan; Costantini, Costantino O; Brodie, Bruce R; Cox, David A; Stuckey, Thomas D; Fahy, Martin; Grines, Cindy L; Stone, Gregg W",The American journal of cardiology,105,1

However, authentic QI partnerships are not commonplace. A lack of patient and staff capability to deliver successful partnerships may be a barrier to meaningful QI collaboration. OBJECTIVES The research questions for this scoping review were: What is known regarding the capabilities required for healthcare staff and patients to effectively partner in QI at the service level?; and What is known regarding the best practice learning and development strategies required to build and support those capabilities? METHODS A six-stage scoping review was completed. Five electronic databases were searched for publications from January 2010 to February 2020. The database searches incorporated relevant terms for the following concepts: capabilities for PPI in healthcare QI; and best practice learning and development strategies to support those capabilities. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics and qualitative content analysis. RESULTS Forty-nine papers were included. Very little peer-reviewed literature focused explicitly on capabilities for QI partnerships and thus implicit paper content was analysed. A Capability framework for successful partnerships in healthcare quality improvement was developed. It includes knowledge, skills and attitudes across three capability domains: Personal Attributes; Relationships and Communication; and Philosophies, Models and Practices, and incorporates 10 capabilities. Sharing power and leadership was discussed in many papers as fundamental and was positioned across all of the domains. Most papers discussed staff and patients' co-learning (n=28, 57.14%). Workshops or shorter structured training sessions (n=36, 73.47%), and face-to-face learning (n=34, 69.38%) were frequently reported. CONCLUSION The framework developed here could guide individualised development or learning plans for patient partners and staff, or could assist organisations to review learning topics and approaches such as training content, mentoring guidelines or community of practice agendas. Future directions include refining and evaluating the framework. Development approaches such as self-reflection, communities of practice, and remote learning need to be expanded and evaluated.","Cox, Ruth; Molineux, Matthew; Kendall, Melissa; Tanner, Bernadette; Miller, Elizabeth",BMJ quality & safety,105,11

METHODS We used PubMed to primarily identify papers, reviews, case series and editorials published in English from 2000 until 31 January 2020. Based on this, we report the prevalence, clinical manifestations, diagnostic approaches and management of GI involvement in each vasculitis. RESULTS Vasculitides are inflammatory blood vessel diseases and the majority can affect the GI system with vascular, GI tract or solid organ involvement. GI involvement can sometimes complicate and delay the correct diagnosis. Clinical findings are usually nonspecific symptoms, such as fever, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. Bleeding should alert paediatricians to the possibility of severe, complicated vasculitis. Diagnosis relies mostly on imaging. If it goes unrecognised, GI involvement in paediatric vasculitis is a serious cause of morbidity and even mortality, related to bowel ischaemia and perforation. Treatment of GI symptoms depends on the type of vasculitis and usually involves high-dose steroids and immunosuppressants. CONCLUSION GI manifestations in the most common paediatric primary vasculitides.were usually nonspecific, diagnosis mostly relied on imaging and treatment usually involved high-dose corticosteroids and immunosuppressants.","Trapani, Sandra; Rubino, Chiara; Indolfi, Giuseppe",Acta paediatrica,105,27

In the present study, we propose a compartmental epidemic model incorporating quarantine and isolation compartments to (i) describe the current transmission patterns of COVID-19 in India, (ii) assess the impact of currently implemented NPIs, and (iii) predict the future course of the pandemic with various scenarios of NPIs in India. For R0<1, the system has a globally asymptotically stable disease free equilibrium, while for R0>1, the system has one unstable disease free equilibrium and a unique locally stable endemic equilibrium. By using the method of least squares and the best fit curve, we estimate the model parameters to calibrate the model with daily new confirmed cases and cumulative confirmed cases in India for the period from May 1, 2020 to June 25, 2020. Our result shows that the implementation of an almost perfect isolation in India and 33.33% increment in contact-tracing on June 26, 2020 may reduce the number of cumulative confirmed cases of COVID-19 in India by around 53.8% at the end of July 2020. Nationwide lockdown with high efficiency can diminish COVID-19 cases drastically, but combined NPIs may accomplish the strongest and most rapid impact on the spreading of COVID-19 in India.","Bajiya, Vijay Pal; Bugalia, Sarita; Tripathi, Jai Prakash",Chaos,105,1

We discuss factors that should be taken into account in the perioperative period and neurocritical care management of neurosurgical patients during a pandemic emergency; in particular, we will focus on the decision on whether to operate or not a patient during the COVID-19 pandemic and where and how to provide neurointensive care treatment. METHODS A multidisciplinary expert panel composed by specialists with direct experience in COVID-19 management discussed and reviewed the criteria that should be taken into account in the decision to operate or not a patient during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS Disease-related factors should be first taken into account in order to precisely know the enemy we are facing. Patient-related factors should be then evaluated to understand the battleground on which we are facing the enemy. After these considerations, we must ascertain costs and expected outcomes of our surgical intervention by evaluation of surgery-related factors. Finally, the last factor that need to be evaluated before surgery is the availability of resources, staff and ward availability for perioperative care in particular. All these considerations will lead to the optimal organization and management of neurosurgical emergencies during pandemic times, taking into account the community and not only the single patient. CONCLUSIONS We provided schematic preoperative considerations that we hope will help neurosurgeons to guide their decisions in these challenging times.","Balestrino, Alberto; Robba, Chiara; Ceraudo, Marco; Anania, Pasquale; Melloni, Ilaria; Negrini, Simone; Pelosi, Paolo; Zona, Gianluigi; Fiaschi, Pietro",Journal of neurosurgical sciences,105,9

The solar system is littered, however, with distorted polyhedra-shards of rock and ice produced by ubiquitous fragmentation. We apply the theory of convex mosaics to show that the average geometry of natural two-dimensional (2D) fragments, from mud cracks to Earth's tectonic plates, has two attractors: ""Platonic"" quadrangles and ""Voronoi"" hexagons. In three dimensions (3D), the Platonic attractor is dominant: Remarkably, the average shape of natural rock fragments is cuboid. When viewed through the lens of convex mosaics, natural fragments are indeed geometric shadows of Plato's forms. Simulations show that generic binary breakup drives all mosaics toward the Platonic attractor, explaining the ubiquity of cuboid averages. Deviations from binary fracture produce more exotic patterns that are genetically linked to the formative stress field. We compute the universal pattern generator establishing this link, for 2D and 3D fragmentation.","Domokos, Gábor; Jerolmack, Douglas J; Kun, Ferenc; Török, János",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,105,27

However, there is an intrinsic conflict between filtration efficiency, air resistance, and service life. In this study, a two-stage electrostatically assisted air (EAA) filtration device is designed and the efficiency-air resistance-filter life envelope is significantly improved by a thin coating of polydopamine (PDA) on the polyethylene terephthalate (PET) coarse filter by in situ dopamine polymerization. The 8 mm thick EAA PDA-140@PET filter has a high filtration efficiency of 99.48% for 0.3 µm particles, low air resistance of 9.5 Pa at a filtration velocity of 0.4 m s-1 , and steady performance up to 30 d. Compared with the bare PET filter, the penetration rate for 0.3 µm particles is lowered by 20×. The coated PDA is of submicron thickness, 10-3 × the gap distance between filter fibers, so low air resistance could be maintained. The filter shows steadily high filtration efficiency and an acceptable increase of air resistance and holds nearly as many particles as its own weight in a 30 day long-term test. The working mechanism of the EAA coarse filter is investigated, and the materials design criteria are proposed.","Tian, Enze; Yu, Qipeng; Gao, Yilun; Wang, Hua; Wang, Chao; Zhang, Yinping; Li, Baohua; Zhu, Meifang; Mo, Jinhan; Xu, Guiyin; Li, Ju",Small,105,29

Compared with the use of live streaming activities in entertainment, shopping, sport, e-sport, religious, educational, and academic settings, the tourism context has yet to be explored. This study takes China as a case to examine tourism practices related to live streaming. Specifically, 48,114 social media posts were subjected to systematic content analysis. The dataset contained live streaming content related to 147 countries and 34 Chinese provincial administrative regions between 2010 and 2021. Findings revealed the following: (1) the development of tourism live streaming in China can be classified into germination, exploration, and opportunity stages;(2) live content mainly evoked positive emotions, whereas negative sentiment resulted from illegal or boring content;(3) users’ perceptions of tourism live streaming content involved institutions, live streaming tools, live streaming attractions, the live streaming economy, people, facilities and information, time, and regions;and (4) live streaming tools and attractions constituted the core of the identified semantic network and had the strongest regulation capabilities in tourism live streaming activities.

Here, we engineered a panel of diverse, membrane-resident native HIV-1 trimers vulnerable to two broad targets of neutralizing antibodies (NAbs), the V2 apex and fusion peptide (FP). Selection criteria included i) high expression and ii) infectious function, so that trimer neutralization sensitivity can be profiled in pseudovirus assays. Initially, we boosted the expression of 17 candidate trimers by truncating gp41 and introducing a gp120-gp41 SOS disulfide to prevent gp120 shedding. “Repairs” were made to fill glycan holes and other strain-specific aberrations. A new neutralization assay allowed PV infection when our standard assay was insufficient. Trimers with exposed V3 loops, a target of non-neutralizing antibodies, were discarded. To try to increase V2-sensitivity, we removed clashing glycans and modified the V2 loop’s C-strand. Notably, a 167N mutation improved V2-sensitivity. Glycopeptide analysis of JR-FL trimers revealed near complete sequon occupation and that filling the N197 glycan hole was well-tolerated. In contrast, sequon optimization and inserting/removing other glycans in some cases had local and global “ripple” effects on glycan maturation and sequon occupation in the gp120 outer domain and gp41. V2 mAb CH01 selectively bound trimers with small high mannose glycans near the base of the V1 loop, thereby avoiding clashes. Knocking in a N49 glycan perturbs gp41 glycans via a distal glycan network effect, increasing FP NAb sensitivity - and sometimes improving expression. Finally, a biophysical analysis of VLPs revealed that i) ∼25% of particles bear Env spikes, ii) spontaneous particle budding is high and only increases 4-fold upon Gag transfection, and iii) Env+ particles express ∼30-40 spikes. Overall, we identified 7 diverse trimers with a range of sensitivities to two targets that should enable rigorous testing of immunofocusing vaccine concepts. Author Summary Despite almost 40 years of innovation, an HIV vaccine to induce antibodies that block virus infection remains elusive. Challenges include the unparalleled sequence diversity of HIV’s surface spikes and its dense sugar coat that limits antibody access. However, a growing number of monoclonal antibodies from HIV infected donors provide vaccine blueprints. To date, these kinds of antibodies have been difficult to induce by vaccination. However, two antibody targets, one at the spike apex and another at the side of the spikes are more forgiving in their ‘demands’ for unusual antibodies. Here, we made a diverse panel of HIV spikes vulnerable at these two sites for later use as vaccines to try to focus antibodies on these targets. Our selection criteria for these spikes were: i) that the spikes, when expressed on particles, are infectious, allowing us to appraise our vaccine designs in an ideal manner; ii) that spikes are easy to produce by cells in quantities sufficient for vaccine use. Ultimately, we selected 7 trimers that will allow us to explore concepts that could bring us closer to an HIV vaccine.","Crooks, Emma T; Almanza, Francisco; D’addabbo, Alessio; Duggan, Erika; Zhang, Jinsong; Wagh, Kshitij; Mou, Huihui; Allen, Joel D; Thomas, Alyssa; Osawa, Keiko; Korber, Bette T; Tsybovsky, Yaroslav; Cale, Evan; Nolan, John; Crispin, Max; Verkoczy, Laurent K; Binley, James M",bioRxiv,105,24

Subjects and methods. A multicenter prospective observational study included 90 COVID-19 patients treated in ICU whose transcutaneous saturation (SpO2) values were below 93% despite treatment. Depending on the degree of impaired oxygenation, patients underwent oxygen therapy through a mask or nasal cannula, high-flow oxygenation or non-invasive ventilation, while it was not always possible to achieve the target values of oxygenation parameters. The patients were divided into the following groups: Group 1 - SpO2 above 93%, Group 2 - SpO2 within 93-90%, Group 3 - SpO2 within 85-89%, Group 4- SpO2 within 80-84%, Group 5 - SpO2 within 75-79%, and Group 6 - below 75%. Results. It was revealed that during ARF management by noninvasive methods, different values of transcutaneous saturation and corresponding changes in the acid-base balance (ABB) and blood gas composition were determined When transcutaneous saturation (SpO2) decreased to 85%, there was a corresponding moderate decrease in PaO2 while no metabolic changes occurred. As a rule, there were no obvious clinical signs of respiratory failure (silent hypoxia). In patients with SpO2 reduction down 80-85%, clinical signs of respiratory failure (dyspnea, tachypnea, agitation) and, as a rule, a moderate increase in PаCO2 with the development of respiratory acidosis and compensatory metabolic alkalosis were noted. When SpO2 decreased down to 75-79%, arterial hypoxemia was usually accompanied by moderate hypercapnia and the development of decompensated mixed acidosis and venous desaturation as well as increased lactate levels. With transcutaneous saturation going below 74%, these changes were even more pronounced and were observed in all patients of this group. Conclusion. The revealed changes are mostly consistent with generally accepted ideas about the relationship between values of transcutaneous saturation and blood gas composition and parameters of blood ABB in the case of ARF. Reduction of transcutaneous saturation down to 85% not accompanied by pronounced clinical signs of respiratory failure (dyspnea, tachypnea, agitation), development of acidosis and venous desaturation, and the elevated lactate level can be regarded as relatively safe. © 2021 Serbian Chemical Society.

Design/methodology/approach: This case study of technology savvy P-12 school principals provides insights into how building leaders overcome digital technology innovation challenges. In the summer of 2017, the authors interviewed 12 of the 18 recipients of the NASSP Digital Principal Award. These principals serve as examples of how to lead schools in the digital age. Findings: Using Bolman and Deal's (2013) conceptual framework, the authors analyzed the data around the four frames (i.e., political, structural, human resources, and symbolic) to understand the challenges of being a digital principal. Bolman and Deal posited leaders who function predominantly in a single frame may miss essential organizational change elements. Research limitations/implications: The authors recognize several limitations in this study. First, the nominating process for the NASSP Digital Principals award involves an application process. Thus, while these principals were recognized for meeting these criteria, it is possible that these awardees were selected based on their nomination materials rather than on actual longitudinal evidence. Second, this study's data were gathered through interviews. The authors did not gather data through student work samples, teacher and staff interviews, or other data points, but rather the single data point of principal perspectives through interviews. Originality/value: One silver lining from the pandemic is that leading schools cannot be detangled from the digital needs of diverse stakeholders. As such, digital principalship has become the new norm where the principal leads on a screen, teachers teach on a screen, and students learn on a screen. The award-winning digital principals in this study played an integral role in how they message their school's story, how they navigate and design structures, how they overcome political realities, and how they invest in addressing the needs of individuals.","Richardson, Jayson W.; Watts, Jeremy Lucian Daniel Sterrett William L.",Journal of Educational Administration,105,1

Instead, the Ministry of Public Affairs officials have declared some parts of the capital city and a few other districts as red zones or high-risk areas based on the number of people infected in the late June 2020. Nonetheless, the COVID-19 infection rate had been increasing in almost every other part of the country. Ironically, rather than ensuring rapid tests and isolation of COVID-19 patients, from the beginning of July 2020, the Directorate General of Health Services restrained the maximum number of tests per laboratory. Thus, the health experts have raised the question of whether the government is heading toward achieving herd immunity instead of containing the COVID-19 pandemic.

This tool has been successfully implemented in different specialties. It is useful for providing quick solutions, improving the overload of the medical care and for the early detection of inflammatory diseases1. In our centre, virtual consultation from Primary Care (PC) to Hospital Care (HC) has been implemented. Objectives: The main objective is to describe our experience with the use of virtual consultation and its value as a new modality of specialised medical care. The second aim is to identify the most frequent reasons for consultation and diagnoses, to assess the concordance between the two and to analyse the trend over time of the number of virtual consultations and their relationship with the different waves of the COVID 19 pandemic. Methods: Retrospective observational study. The virtual consultations made from PC (47 centres) to Rheumatology during 2020 were analysed. They were carried out through a computer programme, using the “Andalusian Health Service Virtual Consultation Platform” tool. A specific agenda was established for virtual consultations. The reason for the referral and the rheumatologist's diagnosis were collected. The response given to the PC was divided into four models: NON-TRIBUTARY (not related to the speciality), DISCHARGE (a diagnosis and therapeutic response is concluded), APPOINTMENT FOR CONSULTATION and FOLLOW-UP (new contact is requested, completing the information). The reasons for consultation, diagnoses, time and type of response were analysed. Results: 47 virtual consultations were carried out. 54.5% (n 298) were closed as DISCHARGE. 27.4% (n 150) were APPOINTMENT FOR CONSULTATION, and 17.7% (n 97) indicated FOLLOW-UP. Only 0.4% (n 2) were NOT TRIBUTARY. The average response time was 2 days 15 hours and 56 min. The most frequent reason for consultation was polyarthralgias (26.7%, n 146) and after the rheumatologist's assessment a diagnosis was established in 89% of them. Inflammatory arthropathy accounted for 30.8% (n 45), osteoarthritis for 19.9% (n 29), fibromyalgia for 12.3% (n 18), polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) for 6.9% (n 10), osteoporosis for 2.7% (n 4) and connective tissue disease for 2.1% (n 3). Another frequent reason for consultation was osteoporosis (13.5% n 74), of which 85.1% (n 63) had a confirmed diagnosis and/or need for revision. A diagnosis could be made via telematics in 89.6% of the consultations. 15.5% were osteoporosis (n 85), 14.9% osteoarthritis (n 81), 10.5% soft tissue injuries, 8.8% mechanical/ nonspecific pain (n 47), 7.1% rheumatoid arthritis (n 39), 6.5% fibromyalgia (n 34), 6.2% connective tissue disease (n 34), 5.7% PMR (n 31), 4.9% suspected spondyloarthritis (n 26), 4.2% psoriatic arthritis (n 23) and 4.2% microcrystalline arthritis (n 23). 27.4% (n 150) of the virtual consultations were required for assessment in a face-to-face appointment. We analysed the distribution over time (Figure 1). In the COVID 19 confinement phase (14 March -21 June), the number of consultations increased, peaking in June, a behaviour that has persisted in the other mobility phases (October/November). Conclusion: More than half of the virtual consultations carried out were resolved without face-to-face assessment, with a diagnosis being established in almost 90%. It is an effective tool for rapid access to Rheumatology, detecting pathology requiring preferential attention, with a face-to-face appointment, as well as for the early diagnosis of inflammatory arthropathy, which was detected in a quarter of the consultations, as well as for the diagnosis and follow-up of osteoporosis. Virtual consultation facilitates a quick response, playing an even more relevant role in the current SARS CoV-2 pandemic situation. (Figure Presented).","Garcia Hernandez, I.; Mendoza Mendoza, D.

Antimicrobials, such as tetracyclines, are used widely used across agriculture, medicine, and in bee keeping, and bees can be directly or indirectly exposed to tetracycline residues in the environment. In European honey bees, tetracycline exposure has been linked with shifts in the gut microbiota that negatively impact bee health. However, the effects of antimicrobials on Africanized honey bee gut microbiota have not been examined. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of tetracycline exposure on the gut microbial community of Africanized honey bees (Apis mellifera scutellata x spp), which are important pollinators in South, Central, and North America. Bees (n=1,000) were collected from hives in Areia-PB, Northeastern Brazil, placed into plastic chambers and kept under controlled temperature and humidity conditions. The control group (CON) was fed daily with syrup (10g) consisting of a 1:1 solution of demerara sugar and water, plus a solid protein diet (10g) composed of 60% soy extract and 40% sugar syrup. The tetracycline group (TET) was fed identically but with the addition of tetracycline hydrochloride (450 µg/g) to the sugar syrup. Bees were sampled from each group before (day 0), and after tetracycline exposure (days 3, 6 and 9). Abdominal contents dissected out of each bee underwent DNA extraction and 16S rRNA sequencing (V3-V4) on an Illumina MiSeq. Sequences were filtered and processed through QIIME2 and DADA2. Microbial community composition and diversity and differentially abundant taxa were evaluated by treatment and time. Bee gut microbial composition (Jaccard) and diversity (Shannon) differed significantly and increasingly over time and between CON and TET groups. Tetracycline exposure was associated with decreased relative abundances of Bombella and Fructobacillus, along with decreases in key core microbiota such as Snodgrassella, Gilliamella, Rhizobiaceae, and Apibacter. These microbes are critical for nutrient metabolism and pathogen defense, and decreased abundances of these microbes could negatively affect bee health. Considering the global ecological and economic importance of honey bees as pollinators, it is critical to understand the effects of agrochemicals including antimicrobials on honey bees.","Soares, Kilmer Oliveira; de Oliveira, Celso José Bruno; Rodrigues, Adriana Evangelista; Vasconcelos, Priscylla Carvalho; da Silva, Núbia Michelle Vieira; da Cunha Filho, Octavio Gomes; Madden, Christopher; Hale, Vanessa L.",bioRxiv,105,20

It employed both quantitative and qualitative research methods to assess the functional skills of LSENs amidst the pandemic as rated by the parents. The respondents were selected through purposive sampling technique. The study utilised an adapted the research tool. The findings show that most of the learners were aged 10 years old or older, male, non-graded and with intellectual disabilities, while most of the parents were poor, housewives and had a high school level. The result also revealed that parents rated LSENs with moderate functional skills. The challenges encountered by parents include lack of relevant training, lack of knowledge about child care and lacks of time. With this, the school administrators should design responses with specific contexts and consider implementation of the functional skills of learners. Hence, the adoption of the parental intervention plan for LSENs is recommended. © 2021 Birlesik Dunya Yenilik Arastirma ve Yayincilik Merkezi. All rights reserved.","Padillo, G. G.; Espina, R.

Children are less affected and have a mild form of the illness. The association between SARS-CoV-2 disease, COVID-19 and late symptoms of vasculitis is often suspected, in particular in young asymptomatic patients, especially due to the post-viral immune response. Objective: The aim of the review is to describe the characteristics of children and adolescents affected by the development of Kawasaki-like mult-system inflammatory syndrome (KD) (MISC), and assesses its possible temporal association with SARS-CoV-2 infection Brief description of the state of knowledge: A group of children who presented with KD-type MISC during the COVID-19 pandemic have been identified in the United Kingdom, the United States, and Italy. Some children were diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection by real-time polymerase chain reaction and IgG antibodies. SARS-CoV-2 infection and hyperinflammation in COVID-19 can serve as an ‘initial trigger’ for KD. IVIG should be administered within seven days of onset of illness until KD symptoms disappear and COVID-19 test is negative. Large numbers of children in African countries with the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic are likely to be affected by KD, and in such cases, a shortage of IVIG supplies is expected. Conclusions: This article suggests a correlation between COVID-19 and Kawasaki-like MISC, which is important for the care of sick children. However, the definitive relationship between childhood KD and COVID-19 needs to be confirmed by a large cohort study on a large numbers of infant and children patients worldwide.","Manal Fouad, Elshamaa",Medycyna Środowiskowa = Environmental Medicine,105,24

Under appropriate management of EV charging and discharging, the grid can currently satisfy the energy requirements of a considerable number of EVs. Furthermore, EVs can help enhance the reliability and stability of the energy grid through ancillary services such as energy storage. This paper proposes the EV routing problem with time windows under time-variant electricity prices (EVRPTW-TP) which optimizes the routing of an EV fleet that are delivering products to customers, jointly with the scheduling of the charging and discharging of the EVs from/to the grid. The proposed model is a multiperiod vehicle routing problem where EVs can stop at charging stations to either recharge their batteries or inject stored energy to the grid. Given the energy costs that vary based on time-of-use, the charging and discharging schedules of the EVs are optimized to benefit from the capability of storing energy by shifting energy demands from peak hours to off-peak hours when the energy price is lower. The vehicles can recover the energy costs and potentially realize profits by injecting energy back to the grid at high price periods. EVRPTW-TP is formulated as an optimization problem. A Lagrangian relaxation approach and a hybrid variable neighborhood search/tabu search heuristic are proposed to obtain high quality lower bounds and feasible solutions, respectively. Numerical experiments on instances from the literature are provided. The proposed heuristic is also evaluated on a case study of an EV fleet providing grocery delivery at the region of Kitchener-Waterloo in Ontario, Canada. Insights on the impacts of energy pricing, service time slots, range reduction in winter as well as fleet size are presented.","Lin, Bo; Ghaddar, Bissan; Nathwani, Jatin",,105,1

Based on the spatiotemporal graph neural network and mobility data, this paper attempts to offer a novel prediction by building a high-resolution graph with the characteristics such as willingness to wear masks, daily infection, and daily death. This model is different from the time series prediction model. The method learns from the multivariate spatiotemporal graph, the nodes represent the region with daily confirmed cases and death, and edges represent the inter-regional contacts based on mobility. Simultaneously, the transmission model is built by a time margin as the characteristic of the time change. This paper builds the COVID-19 model by using STGNNs and tries to predict and verify the virus's infection. Finally, the model has an absolute Pearson Correlation of 0.9735, far from the expected value of 0.998. The predicted value on the first and second day is close to the real situation, while the value gradually deviates from the actual situation after the second day. It still shows that the graph neural network uses much temporal and spatial information to enable the model to learn complex dynamics. In the future, the model can be improved by tuning hyper-parameter such as modulation numbers of convolution, or construction of graphs that suitable for smaller individuals such as institutions, buildings, and houses, as well as assigning more features to each node.

The article focuses on examining the difference between the level of health consciousness at the time of the decline of the first wave and the release of measures against coronavirus and the second upcoming wave of the mutated version of the virus. The main goal of the state is to examine the level of health consciousness and follow the recommendations of W.H.O. against the spread of coronavirus in Slovakia and Hungary during the decline and re-emergence of coronavirus. The research consisted of two phases - the first phase after the first wave of the pandemic and the second during the onset of the second phase. The one-way ANOVA test and linear regression analysis were used to explore the relationship between health consciousness and W.H.O's recommendations in the fight against coronavirus. The results indicate a close connection in the conditions of Slovakia and Hungary. At the same time, we concluded that health consciousness changes due to the acuteness of the situation. The results can be used in many fields (medicine, sociology, psychology, marketing), both theories and practice. Implications for Central European audience: European countries, as well as the whole world, are fighting the coronavirus. Preliminary results suggest that the second wave will bring more infected. Health consciousness and prevention provide the best opportunity to fight coronavirus in times without an effective vaccine. It is, therefore, the role of the responsible authorities to examine the level of health consciousness and to try to influence it positively.

Lungs are one of the most commonly affected organ in RA, and the lung involvement in RA results in a various clinical features including interstitial lung disease (ILD) and organizing pneumonia (OP). OP is a histologic term characterized by the presence of buds of granulation tissue in bronchioles and alveoli. OP can be either idiopathic (cryptogenic organizing pneumonia) or secondary to underlying disease such as infection, drugs or connective tissue disease including RA. Lung biopsy is usually recommended for the diagnosis, but the following criteria fulfilled by patients can lead to the diagnosis: (1) specific radiological manifestations (nonsegmental randomized consolidation with/without ground grass opacities in chest CT), (2) no causative infectious agent, (3) no response to antibiotics and (4) good response to corticosteroid therapy. We describe here the case of organized pneumonia discovered in a pregnant woman with known rheumatoid arthritis during COVID-19 pandemic. Case description A 39-year old moroccan woman, gravida 4, para 1, was admitted during COVID-19 pandemic at 30 weeks' gestation to maternity hospital with a 1-week history of cough, dyspnea and fever. Her medical history included rheumatoid arthritis and gestational diabetes. She was treated with 5mg of prednisolone daily for her RA. Blood sample showed white blood cell count and C reactive protein at a level of 6860/mm3 and 42mg/L respectively. Chest CT performed at her admission revealed diffuse irregular nodular condensations associated with ground glass infiltrates and a right lower lobe parenchymal condensation with airbronchogram in favor of superinfection. Given circumstances, she was tested twice for SARS-Cov-2 48 hours apart by PCR on nasopharyngeal sample and results came back negative. She was treated empirically with ceftriaxone and azithromycin during the first week and described an improvement in her clinical condition but symptoms reappeared 4 days after stopping treatment. During the 2 following months, until the delivery, the patient remained subpyretic with a nonproductive cough and moderate dyspnea. 5 days after the delivery, duesimilar image findings but some of the irregular nodular condensations showed a reversed halo sign and had a migrating character. Considering this typical image findings, the absence of causative infectious agents (excluded by bronchoalveaolar lavage performed after delivery) and the absence of response to antibiotics, we concluded with a diagnosis of OP secondary to RA without performing lung biopsy samples. A treatment with 48mg of methylprednisolone (and 100mg of azathioprine a few weeks later) was initiated. One month later, she showed a spectacular improvement in her clinical condition. A new chest CT highlighted disappearance of the majority of the ground glass areas and of all the condensations previously described. Methylprednisolone was then progressively tapered. Conclusion OP is a common pulmonary complication that can develop in RA. However, despite ou research, we have not found any other clinical case describing this disorder during pregnancy with RA. Since OP is a non-specific inflammatory response to an aggression of the organism, could we consider that the pregnancy is a state of aggression capable of causing such a response In addition, this clinical case illustrates the diagnostic challenge of this pathology during the Covid-19 pandemic.","Cornillie, A.; Grivegnee, C.",Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases,105,1

Experiences in defeating SARS, which infested during 2002-2003, can be used in treating the new disease. However, comparative genomics and epidemiology studies have shown much difference between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, which underlies the different clinical features and therapies in between those two diseases. Further studies comparing transcriptomes infected by these two viruses to uncover the differences in host responses would be necessary. Here we conducted a comprehensive transcriptome analysis of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2-infected human cell lines, including Caco-2, Calu-3, H1299. Clustering analysis and expression of ACE2 show that SARS-CoV-2 has broader but weaker infection, where the largest discrepancy occurs in the epithelial lung cancer cell, Calu-3. SARS-CoV-2 genes also show less tissue specificity than SARS-CoV genes. Furthermore, we detected more general but moderate immune responses in SARS-CoV-2 infected transcriptomes by comparing weighted gene co-expression networks and modules. Our results suggest a different immune therapy and treatment scheme for COVID-19 patients than the ones used on SARS patients. The wider but weaker permissiveness and host responses of virus infection may also imply a long-term existence of SARS-CoV-2 among human populations.","Leung, Chi Sum; Xie, Songhong; Feng, Jiali; Chen, Dongjing; Dai, Aimei",,105,27

Each of them is characterised by a genetic defect affecting a metabolic pathway. Only few of them have curative treatments, that target the respective metabolic pathway. Commonly, treatment examples include diet, substrate reduction therapies, enzyme replacement therapies, gene therapy and biologicals, enabling IMD-patient now to survive to adulthood. About 30 % of all IMDs involve the musculoskeletal system and are here referred to as rare metabolic RMDs. Generally, IMDs are very heterogenous with respect to symptoms and severity, often being systemic and affecting more children than adults. Thus, challenges include certified advanced training of adult metabolic experts, standardised transition plans, social support and development of therapies for diseases that do not have any cure yet. Objectives: Introduction of MetabERN, its structure and objectives, highlighting on the unique features and challenges of metabolic RMDs and describing the involvement of patient representation in MetabERN. Methods: MetabERN is stratified in 7 subnetworks (SNW) according to the respective metabolic pathways and 9 work packages (WP), including administration, dissemination, guidelines, virtual counselling framework, research/ clinical trials, continuity of care, education and patient involvement. The patient board involves a steering committee and single point of contacts for each subnetwork and work package, respectively2. Projects include identifying the need of implementing social science to assess the psycho-socio-economic burden of IMDs, webinars on IMDs and their transition as well as surveys on the impact of COVID-193 on IMD-patients and health care providers (HCPs), social assistance for IMD-patients and analysing the transition landscape within Europe. Results: The MetabERN structure enables bundling of expertise, capacity building and knowledge transfer for faster diagnosis and better health care. Rare metabolic RMDs are present in all SNWs that require unique treatments according to their metabolic pathways. Implementation of social science to assess the psycho-socio-economic burden of IMDs is still underused. Involvement of patient representatives is essential for a holistic healthcare not only focusing on clinical care, but also on the quality of life for IMD-patients. Surveys identified unmet needs of patient care, patients having little information on national support systems and structural deficits of healthcare systems to ensure HCP can provide adequate clinical care during transition phases. These results are collected by MetabERN and forwarded to the Directorate-General for Health and Food Safety (DG SANTE) of the European Commission (EC) to be addressed further. Conclusion: MetabERN offers an infrastructure of virtual healthcare for patients with IMDs. Thus, in collaboration with ERN ReCONNET, MetabERN can assist in identifying rare metabolic disorders of RMDs to shorten the odyssey of diagnosis and advise on their respective therapies. On the other hand, MetabERN can benefit from EULAR's longstanding experience regarding issues affecting the quality of life, all RMD patients are facing, such as pain, stiffness, fatigue, rehabilitation, maintaining work and disability claims.","Wagner, L.; Sestini, S.; Brown, C.; Finglas, A.; Francisco, R.; Bond, S.; Lampe, C.; Belettato, C.; Van Lingen, C.; Scarpa, M.",Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases,105,16

The widespread expansion of oil palm cultivation, and associated urbanization, alters land‐use patterns, ecological processes, economic relationships, access to land and social practices.In particular, we focus on the socio‐ecological dynamics between Kadazandusun‐Murut (KDM) hunters in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo, and bearded pigs (Sus barbatus;Malay: ‘babi hutan’), the favoured game animal for non‐Muslim communities throughout much of Borneo. We conducted 38 semi‐structured interviews spanning over 50 hr with bearded pig hunters, asking them about contemporary hunting practices and motivations, changes in hunting practices, changes in pig behaviour, and patterns of animal protein consumption in village and urban contexts.Amidst widespread land‐use change, primarily driven by oil palm expansion, respondents reported substantially different characteristics of hunting in oil palm plantations as compared to hunting in forests. Additionally, 17 of 38 hunters—including 71% (10/14) of hunters who started hunting before 1985, compared to 26% (6/23) of hunters who started hunting in 1985 or later—mentioned that bearded pigs are behaving in a more skittish or fearful way as compared to the past. Our respondents also reported reductions in hunting frequency and wild meat consumption in urban contexts as compared to rural contexts.However, despite these substantial changes in hunting and dietary practices, numerous KDM hunting motivations, hunting techniques and socio‐cultural traditions have endured over the last several decades. For some, bearded pig meat remains deeply tied to food provision, gifting and sharing customs, and cultural components of celebrations and feasts.Oil palm has cultivated new hunting practices that differ from those in forests, and has potentially contributed to altered bearded pig behaviour due to increased hunting accessibility. Together, oil palm and urbanization are helping reshape the KDM‐bearded pig socio‐ecological system. In light of these reshaped connections, we recommend location‐specific management approaches that ensure fair access to the dietary and social benefits of bearded pig hunting while preserving the critical conservation needs of bearded pig populations and habitat. These twin goals are particularly urgent given the confirmed outbreak of African Swine Fever (ASF), and mass deaths of domestic pigs and wild bearded pigs, in Sabah and Kalimantan in 2021.A free Plain Language Summary can be found within the Supporting Information of this article.","Kurz, David J.; Saikim, Fiffy Hanisdah Vanielie Terrence Justine Bloem Jordan Libassi Matthew Luskin Matthew Scott Withey Lauren S.; Goossens, Benoît Brashares Justin S.; Potts, Matthew D.",People and Nature,105,13

In response to these inevitabilities, the industries that make up the consumer design sector - interior design, decor, architecture, fashion and so on - quickly turned their attention to aestheticizing our new, increasingly private and isolationist realities, launching advertising campaigns and editorials to address these new realities. Work-from-home edits, new 'home office' collections, wardrobes for video conferencing and 'digital gallery hopping' campaigns all began encouraging consumers to accessorize their domestic spaces as a bulwark against the threats marking urban environments and their contaminated bodies;bodies that, through the notion of `contamination', drag along a set of inescapable racial and class-based assumptions. Echoing the ways in which interior design, architecture and media enabled America's 'white flight' and suburbanization in the 1950s, luxury retailers are again inviting privileged populations to retreat and design their homes as comfortable bunkers, full of the accessories of art, travel and public life, without the risk of actual encounter. In this article, I argue that these luxury industries are complicit in renewing a post-pandemic racialization of urban space. In the contemporary moment, the luxury design industry's entreaties to (re)design our homes to accommodate a newly public life led in private amounts to a symbolic suburbanization founded in the fear of 'contaminated' racialized bodies.","Arzumanova, I.",Architecture_Mps,105,1

At July 2020, the patient asked for help due to worsening of symptoms. Before the appointment, he was waiting outside because he didn’t feel comfortable in the waiting room. When he touch anything unintentionally, he wash his hands immediately. Since the COVID-19 pandemic began, he stopped working because he was too afraid of being infected. He started to think a lot about SARS-COV2 contamination, avoiding all public places, depending on his mother and friends to do basic daily tasks.

One of the main error sources that reduce the final accuracy of the task is the pose deviation between the end effector (EF) of the robot and its manipulated target object (TO). In this paper, to improve the accuracy, an end effector and its affiliated measurement system, which can measure the relative pose deviation between the TO and the EF, was designed for the precise pick-and-place of the square TOs. In the design, an additional measurement frame (“Frame” for short) with CCD laser displacement sensors was established as a media to transform the pose of the TO to the expression in the coordinate system (CS) of the EF by both describing the pose of the EF and of the TO in the Frame’s CS separately. The geometric model of the entire design, in which the pose deviation of the TO was expressed as a function of the readings of the 16 CCD displacement sensors, was also established. To verify the effectiveness of the design and of the accuracy of the geometric model, an experiment was performed on an ABB irb4600 robot to compensate the error between the EF and its grasped TO in a pick-and-place task. Results show that the average errors can be reduced by around 85%.","Li, Fengchun; Jiang, Yao; Li, Tiemin; Feng, Yixiao; Chen, Shuqing",Procedia Manufacturing,105,1

This event has caused disruptions to many aspects of normal life. An important aspect in reducing the impact of the pandemic is to control its spread. Studies have shown that one effective method in reducing the transmission of COVID-19 is to wear masks. Strict mask-wearing policies have been met with not only public sensation but also practical difficulty. We cannot hope to manually check if everyone on a street is wearing a mask properly. Existing technology to help automate mask checking uses deep learning models on real-time surveillance camera footages. The current dominant method to perform real-time mask detection uses Mask-R-CNN with ResNet as backbone. While giving good detection results, this method is computationally intensive and its efficiency in real-time face mask detection is not ideal. Our research proposes a new approach to the mask detection by replacing Mask-R-CNN with a more efficient model ""YOLO"" to increase the processing speed of real-time mask detection and not compromise on accuracy. Besides, given the small volume as well as extreme imbalance of the mask detection datasets, we adopt a latest progress made in few-shot visual classification, simple CNAPs, to improve the classification performance.","Liu, R.; Ren, Z.

Online materials are increasingly relevant in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic as patients weigh risk of clinic visits against risk of inaction. Internet resources can promote patient agency in shared decision-making. However this requires resources to be accessible, and disparities exist for non-native English speakers. The National Institutes of Health recommends that patient educational materials be written at a reading level between sixth and eighth grade. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the readability of patient educational materials for gynecologic malignancies. Commonly searched keywords related to gynecologic oncology were sorted by primary malignancy. Location-agnostic searches were performed by cancer diagnosis using public internet search engines to identify the top ten websites for endometrial, ovarian, cervical, vaginal, and vulvar cancers with English and Spanish material. Readability was assessed using five validated methods. One-way ANOVA with post-hoc Tukey's tests were performed as appropriate to detect differences by publisher. Over 80% of patient educational materials on gynecologic cancers were written at a tenth grade reading level or higher. Articles written below tenth grade reading level tended to discuss simpler topics such as risk factors, symptoms, and staging;articles on treatment or complications tended to be at university freshman reading level or above. Materials from governmental and non-governmental non-profit organizations were significantly more difficult than materials from the Society for Gynecologic Oncology but were similar in level to those from academic medical centers. Primarily only governmental and non-governmental non-profit organizations had Spanish patient-directed resources easily searchable on their websites, whereas fewer than seven academic medical centers did in the first four levels of their websites. The average for Spanish resources was thirteenth grade level whereas the average for English resources was eleventh grade level with a wider range. Patient educational materials about gynecologic cancers exceed recommended reading levels. This discrepancy is evident in Spanish-language resources, which may relate to suboptimal translation of English materials. While variation in readability allows physicians to direct patients to appropriate English-language sources, there remains a paucity of accessible Spanish-language materials for patients with low health literacy. This is particularly challenging given many Spanish-speaking communities have only sparse or intermittent internet access with limited time for complex searches. Modification to existing materials and creation of new materials is an urgent public health priority.

This course is designed to use the quadcopter drone as an example to teach knowledge in manufacturing processes and systems, illustrate potential impacts of manufacturing to society, and stimulate learning in innovation, teamwork, and communication in a real-world engineering environment. It is also designed to teach students how to best communicate their findings and conclusions. This course is built on two team-based projects. Students practiced and timed the assembly of a state-of-the-art drone, the DJI Spark, and created a mid-term project presentation and report of their plan to setup an assembly plant in Michigan for this drone. Students learned the assembly line design, cycle time balancing, time study, automation, robotics, ergonomics, process capability index, and plant layout. The final project is the design and manufacture of an attachment to a hobby drone, DJI F330, for a mission that will benefit society. Students learned the social-aspects of manufacturing, computer-aided design, additive manufacturing, fabrication skills, and manufacturing processes. Each team identified a societal need, designed an attachment to the DJI F330 drone, reviewed the design with experienced engineers, manufactured components, assembled the attachment, and evaluated them in drone test flights. This course was implemented in close collaboration with a local community college to share the lecture and lab materials as well as pedagogy in manufacturing to benefit the same cohort of high school graduates. This approach of integrated social science, manufacturing, and technical communication to teach manufacturing using drones and connect manufacturing and society were demonstrated to be effective for an introductory freshman engineering course.

The sample which was obtained by using the snowball sampling method consists of 1515 adults (70.4% females) from the Republic of Srpska, entity of Bosnia and Herzegovina, aged between 18 and 65 who filled a relatively short form of an online. Attachment dimensions were measured by the Relationship Questionnaire (RQ), affect by the Negative and Positive Affect Scale (NAPAS), and psychological flexibility by the Acceptance and Action Questionnaire (AAQ-II). The results indicate that attachment anxiety and attachment avoidance correlate positively with the negative affect and correlate negatively with the positive affect. Furthermore, the results showed that the relationships between attachment dimensions and negative affect can be explained through psychological flexibility higher values of attachment dimensions contribute to lower psychological flexibility, which then leads to higher negative affect. The mediatory role of psychological flexibility is not determined in the relation between attachment dimensions and positive affect. The obtained findings have been considered in the light of theoretical and practical importance.","Hadzic, A.; Kantar, D.",Primenjena Psihologija,105,11

With the increasing genomic surveillance of pathogens, especially amid the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, new practical questions about their use are emerging. Point 2 One such question focuses on the inclusion of un-sequenced case occurrence data alongside sequenced data to improve phylodynamic analyses. This approach can be particularly valuable if sequencing efforts vary over time. Point 3 Using simulations, we demonstrate that birth-death phylodynamic models can employ occurrence data to eliminate bias in estimates of the basic reproductive number due to misspecification of the sampling process. In contrast, the coalescent exponential model is robust to such sampling biases, but in the absence of a sampling model it cannot exploit occurrence data. Subsequent analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in the northwest USA supports these results. Point 4 We conclude that occurrence data are a valuable source of information in combination with birth-death models. These data should be used to bolster phylodynamic analyses of infectious diseases and other rapidly spreading species in the future.","Featherstone, Leo A.; Di Giallonardo, Francesca; Holmes, Edward C.; Vaughan, Timothy G.; Duchêne, Sebastián",bioRxiv,105,16

Immunization through large-scale vaccination is the cornerstone of infection prevention in this population. This study aims to identify risk factors for low response to the BNT-162b2 (Pfizer BioNTech) vaccine in a HD cohort. Materials and Methods Observational prospective study of a HD group followed in a Portuguese Public Founded Hemodialysis Center who received BNT-162b2 vaccination. Specific anti-Spike IgG was evaluated as arbitrary units per milliliter (AU/mL) on two separate occasions: 3 weeks after the first dose and 3 weeks after the second. IgG titers, Non-Responders (NR), and Weak-Responders (WR) after each dose were evaluated against risk factors that included demographic, clinical and analytical variables. Results Humoral response evaluated by IgG anti-Spike levels showed a strong correlation with Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) and intact parathormone (iPTH) after each inoculation (1st dose: {rho}=-0.64/0.54; 2nd dose: {rho}=-0.66/0.63, respectively; p<0.01 throughout). After completing both doses: 1) NR were associated with female sex (p<0.01), lower albumin and iPTH (p=0.01); 2) WR showed higher CCI, older age, lower iPTH and lower albumin (p=<0.01, p=0.03, p<0.01, p=0.05, respectively) and, consistently, associated with CCI over 8, age over 75, iPTH under 150 ng/L, female sex, dialysis vintage under 24 months and central venous catheter (CVC) over arteriovenous fistula (p=0.01, p=0.03, p<0.01, p=0.01, p=0.01, p<0.01, respectively). A binary regression model using CCI, sex (male) and CVC was statistically significant in prediction of WR after the 2nd dose with OR (95% CI): 1.81 (1.06-3.08); 0.05 (0.01-0.65); 13.55 (1.06-174.18), respectively (p=0.01). Conclusion Older age, higher CCI, lower iPTH and albumin, CVC as vascular access and recent hemodialysis initiation (less than 2 years) associate with lower response to vaccination in our study. A higher comorbidity burden is suggested as a more significant surrogate marker for low immunogenicity rather than age alone. Identifying HD patients as a population at high-risk for low response to vaccination is essential for proper policy-making, facilitating the implementation of adequate and individualized contingency protocols.","Duarte, R.

Despite the stringent scientific criteria applied to the development of vaccines and other ‘biomedical countermeasures’ in responding to the pandemic, digital contact tracing has been widely recommended despite being an unproven public health intervention. Evidence for its effectiveness is thin, based on theoretical mathematical modelling and unsystematic observations across diverse country contexts. Establishing evidence of effectiveness is complicated by the fact that two private corporations, Apple and Google, own the technology upon which most government contact‐tracing apps are based and which, by design, restricts access to needed data on privacy grounds. In this policy insight, we make the case for why public health authorities urgently need to establish the effectiveness and societal implications of this big digital contact‐tracing experiment.","Antoine de Bengy, Puyvallée Katerini Tagmatarchi Storeng",Global Policy,105,16

RNase2 is also expressed in other leukocyte cells and is the member of the human ribonuclease A family most abundant in macrophages. The protein is endowed with a high ribonucleolytic activity and participates in the host antiviral activity. Although RNase2 displays a broad antiviral activity, it is mostly associated to the targeting of single stranded RNA viruses. To explore RNase2 mechanism of action in antiviral host defence we knocked out RNase2 expression in the THP1 monocyte cell line and characterized the cell response to human Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV). We observed that RSV infection induced the RNase2 expression and protein secretion in THP1 macrophage-derived cells, whereas the knockout (KO) of RNase2 resulted in higher RSV burden and reduced cell viability. Next, by means of the cP-RNAseq methodology, which uniquely amplifies the RNA 2’3’cyclic-phosphate-end products released by an endonuclease cleavage, we compared the ncRNA population in native and RNase2-KO cell lines. Among the ncRNAs accumulated in WT versus KO cells, we found mostly tRNA-derived fragments and secondly miRNAs. Analysis of the differential sequence coverage of tRNAs molecules in native and KO cells identified fragments derived from only few parental tRNAs, revealing a predominant cleavage at anticodon loops and secondarily at D-loops. Inspection of cleavage region identified U/C and A, at 5’ and 3’ sides of cleavage sites respectively (namely RNase B1 and B2 base binding subsites). Likewise, only few selected miRNAs were significantly more abundant in WT versus RNase2-KO cells, with cleavage sites located at the end of stem regions with predominance for pyrimidines at B1 but following an overall less defined nucleotide specificity. Complementarily, by screening of a tRF&tiRNA PCR array we identified an enriched population of tRNA-derived fragments associated to RNase2 expression and RSV infection. The present results confirm the contribution of the protein in macrophage response against virus infection and provide the first evidence of its cleavage selectivity against ncRNA population. A better understanding of the mechanism of action of RNase2 recognition of cellular RNA during the antiviral host defence should pave the basis for the design of novel antiviral drugs.","Lu, Lu; Li, Jiarui; Wei, Ranlei; Guidi, Irene; Cozzuto, Luca; Ponomarenko, Julia; Prats-Ejarque, Guillem; Boix, Ester",bioRxiv,105,16

Developing efficacious therapeutics for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 is of high priority. Therefore, in this study, the chemical constituents obtained from Tinospora cordifolia are investigated for their in-silico interaction with protein targets crucial for SARSCoV-2 infection and cytokine storm. The five important targets chosen for SARSCoV-2 were the main protease (Mpro), Spike receptor binding domain (Spike-RBD), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp or Nsp12), nonstructural protein 15 (Nsp15) of SARS-CoV-2 and the host angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) spike-RBD binding domain and cytokine receptors TNF-α (Tumor Necrosis Factor-α) and IL-6 (Interleukine-6). This was accomplished using Maestro 12.4 (Schrodinger Suite) to obtain docking scores. Also, the absorption, distribution, metabolism, elimination, and toxicity parameters (ADMET) were determined using Maestro QikProp modules. The results of computational study revealed that four constituents Cordifolioside-A, Palmatoside-E, Tinocordioside and Tinosporaside significantly antagonize the five targets of SARS-CoV-2 by binding in the binding pocket with docking score ranging from −9.664 to −6.488 kcal/mol and shows drug-like property and also effectively inhibit cytokine storm by antagonizing the TNF-α and IL-6 receptors. Promising drug-like properties, excellent docking scores, and binding pose against each target makes the screened compounds as possible lead candidate which can be further evaluated in future studies to assess their in vitro and in vivo efficacy against SARS-CoV-2. The structure of these compounds can be used further for optimization and design of drugs against COVID-19.

This is likely due to a combination of immune dysfunction, immunosuppressive therapy and excess co-morbidities. Little is known about the impact of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in patients with inflammatory autoimmune systemic diseases. Objectives: The aim of this study is to describe clinical characteristics of patients with autoimmune systemic diseases and COVID-19, and to identify baseline variables associated with a severe infection requiring hospitalization. Methods: A telephone survey investigating the impact of COVID-19 on patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), systemic sclerosis (SSc), inflammatory arthritis (rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis), idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIM), ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV) was administered. Data extraction included diagnosis, disease activity status, demographics, disease duration, occupational exposure, adherence to social distancing advise, therapy, comorbidities, and laboratory tests. COVID-19 was classified as definite diagnosis of COVID-19 disease: presence of symptomatic COVID-19 infection, confirmed by a nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction test. Comparisons between patients with or without hospitalization were performed. Results: 512 patients (median age 53,4 ± 14,3 years) with autoimmune systemic diseases (234 IA, 182 SLE, 42 SSc, 31 IIM, 23 AAV) were included in the study. 89 patients (58 woman, 31 men) developed at least one symptom (fever, asthenia, chills, cough, sore throat, dyspnea, chest pain, headaches, arthralgias, myalgias, odynophagia, diarrhea, conjunctivitis, hypo-, ageusia, hypo-, anosmia) of COVID-19 and were PCR test positive.

This emergency scenario produced a conflict between personal freedom and public health, highlighting differences in individual behaviours influenced by psychological traits and moral considerations. In this context, a detailed characterisation of the psychological variables predicting adherence to containment measures is crucial to enhance public awareness and compliance. During the first virus outbreak in Italy, we assessed whether adherence to government measures was explained by the interacting effects of personality traits and moral dispositions. Through an online questionnaire, we collected data on individual endogenous variables related to personality traits, locus of control, and moral dispositions, alongside the tendency to breach the lockdown for outdoor physical activity. The results showed that individual measures of novelty-seeking, harm-avoidance and authority concerns interacted in driving the adherence to the national lockdown: MFQ-Authority moderated the facilitatory effect of novelty-seeking on lockdown violation, but this moderation was itself moderated by higher TCI-harm-avoidance. By assessing a model forecasting the likelihood of violating restrictive norms, these findings show the potential of personality and moral foundation assessments in informing prevention policies and emergency interventions by political and scientific institutions.","Lo Presti, Sara Mattavelli Giulia Canessa Nicola Gianelli Claudia",Personality and Individual Differences,105,22

The existence or nonexistence of burnout has significant implications for individuals, families, organizations, communities, and societies. There is an urgent need for further descriptive research to determine consensus-driven diagnostic criteria that will aid in high-quality research to guide nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic treatment and to aid in the development of individual, organizational, and societal prevention strategies. This urgency is driven by recent changes in the occupational-social contract and highlighted by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. To address this need, the authors performed a narrative, nonsystematic review to obtain an overview of the current body of literature regarding the symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment of burnout symptoms. A literature search was conducted in PubMed for relevant articles in English since 1974 with the following search terms: ""occupational burnout,"" ""professional burnout,"" ""career burnout,"" ""assessment,"" ""inventory,"" ""measure,"" ""instrument,"" ""diagnosis,"" ""treatment,"" ""guideline"" in different combinations. Hand searching was also performed. Retrieved records were reviewed, and the relevant studies were summarized.

Local anaesthetic medical thoracoscopy (LAT) is a well-established diagnostic, therapeutic and preventative procedure in undiagnosed pleural effusions. Patients were traditionally admitted for a mean of 3.4 days and had a large bore drain inserted post LAT and pleurodesis was performed. The Covid-19 pandemic has forced us to provide day case LAT with IPC placement without pleurodesis to minise transmission risk. We thus describe our local experience. LAT is performed in theatre under conscious sedation. Methods: All the notes of patients requiring day case LAT between July 2020-Dec 2020 were analysed. Basic demographics were collected as well as diagnoses and what interventions were performed. A descriptive analysis of the data was performed. Results: 13 patients underwent day case LAT. All had negative preoperative Covid-19 swabs. Mean age was 69.7 years (range 24–82). 10 were male and 3 female. Definite diagnoses included 5 lung cancers, 4 mesotheliomas and 2 fibrinous pleuritis. The lung did not deflate, not allowing for biopsies in 2 patients. Non-malignant diagnoses are currently presumed. 10 IPCs and 1 large bore drain were inserted due to 1 immedidate complication (surgical emphysema). 1 patient developed an empyema within 30days. 8 out of the 10 IPCs have already been removed due to pleurodesis occuring (mean number of days 27.5, range 16–72). All patients were discharged on the same day except 1 patient who required a large bore drain and stayed overnight. Conclusions: We have thus transformed our service after more than a decade of providing LAT as an inpatient service. This is a small cohort of patients but proves the feasibility and safety of day case LAT with massive reduction in inpatient stay. The Covid-19 pandemic has transformed our service but for the better. Further qualitative work should elucidate the acceptability of such a pathway for patients.

In stable conditions where vertical temperature gradients are positive, would prevent the vertical motion of fluid flows, thus the initial inertia motions are maintained, whereas in unstable conditions where vertical temperature gradients are negative, fluids experience intensive convection, thus the initial inertia motions are more easily to get disturbed. This study experimentally and numerically investigated the dispersion of exhaled contaminants and body thermal plume in a displacement-ventilated room integrated with unstable and stable conditions. Two real-human subjects participated in the full-scale experiments. The effects of participants' relative position with reference to the ventilation vents and of ventilation rates on the flow field were examined. Results show that the thermal stratification associated with the displacement ventilation system was disturbed by unstable conditions, resulting in a uniformly distributed contaminants and thermal fields, therefore a reduced exposure level;whereas the thermal stratification was enhanced by stable conditions so that the transport of contaminants and thermal more inclined to follow their initially released direction and led to a relatively high exposure level in the breathing microenvironment. Air distribution in unstable conditions, when compared with stable conditions, was more sensitive to the relative position between the participants and the vents. Increasing the ventilation rate could greatly reduce the contaminant level of unstable conditions but may not achieve as good results in stable conditions. This paper has practical significance in controlling the transmission of exhaled contaminants and preventing the spread of infectious diseases.","Deng, Xiaorui Gong Guangcai",International Journal of Thermal Sciences,105,24

It argues that knowledge of local languages can help disseminate health-related information on a regional level. This addresses two problems simultaneously: the problems raised by the intelligibilty of governmental healthcare protocols and the functions of the use of local languages. The article is a case study presenting a number of interventions in the languages of East Kalimantan and can be seen as an inclusive, grassroots example of health communication. The study was initially a modest attempt to generate on-the-ground examples of health information in the dominant languages of the region of East Kalimantan. These studies demonstrate that the local communities of these languages are very enthusiastic about getting involved in the interventions. They also reveal that communication using IT and social media is thriving. One of our observations was that information about this pandemic tends to be understood only by highly educated urban people. This happens because it is conveyed by the government in standard Indonesian, which includes many foreign loanwords. The application of local languages is not just using local language vocabulary, it is instead a trigger to revive the collective memory of disaster management based on local culture. In this case, local languages are recognized and considered useful in helping to break the chain of virus transmission to free Indonesia of the Covid-19 outbreak. There were a number of unexpected developments. We found support for the intervention being rolled out on a national level by Special Task Force for Covid-19 under National Disaster Management Agency (Badan Nasional Penanggulangan Bencana/BNPB). We also welcomed the online publication by the National Agency for Language Development and Cultivation (Badan Bahasa) of the Handbook for managing behavior about health protocols in seventy-seven local languages. The main thrust of this article should therefore be of interest to anyone working to empower local languages and language vitality. © 2021 Faculty of Humanities, Universitas Indonesia","Lauder, A.

Cases of pregnancy/hospitalizations in 2019/2020, factors that affect interpretation of glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and/or SARS-CoV-2 infections were excluded. The participants were stratified into groups of WA after the SE: g1 (telework/lay-off/students), g2 (retired/unemployed) and g3 (WA without lockdown). HbA1c were obtained from 4 periods: t3 (4/1-6/1/2020);t4 (7/1-9/1/2020);t1 and t2 (homologous periods of 2019). Differences in HbA1c were calculated in both years and compared to each other in the same group and between groups in the same year. Hypoglycemia and insulin regimens (insulin pump and multiple injections daily) were analyzed in intragroup (t3 vs. t4) and intergroup (t3 and t4) comparisons. Results: Two hundred and seven participants were included [106 (51.2%) men;median age of 35 (25;47) years]: 144 (69.6%) in g1, 44 (21.3%) in g2 and 19 (9.2%) in g3. HbA1c increased significantly between t4 and t3 (vs. t2 and t1) in g1 (p=0.001), but not in g2 (p=0.077) and g3 (p=0.744). In 2020, HbA1c raised significantly in the analysis ""g1 vs. g3"" (p=0.004), but not in ""g1 vs. g2"" (p=0.213) and ""g2 vs. g3"" (p=0.083). No differences were reported in 2019, along with all the comparisons involving hypoglycemia and insulin regimens. Conclusions: This study found an overall worsening of GC in participants who returned to higher levels of activity after a total lockdown. This is probably explained by the time spent on T1DM self-care during the lockdown.","Ramalho, Diogo Correia Sara Almeida Lúcia Alves Helena Rocha Gustavo Ferreira Marta Oliveira Maria J.",Diabetes,105,22

During a pandemic, the entire PPDB process is carried out through one route. As for the difficulty, prospective students can come to school by sticking to health protocols and research in June 2020. The research location is one of the favorite high schools in Bekasi. Primary data sources were obtained from in-depth interviews directly with informants. Secondary data sources are taken from books, journals, and other official documents from informants. The selection of informants was selected by purposive non-probability sampling: data collection techniques used online observation, in-depth interviews, and documentation. The data validity used source triangulation—this research analysis using descriptive method. The data collection technique was carried out through interviews with parents, school representatives, and related agencies and was also supported by literature studies related to school zoning policies. The results showed that the application of PPDB zoning was more effective online during the pandemic. Because it can minimize parents' arrival and optimize the functions of the existing PPDB system. The implementation of the school zoning policy caused turmoil in the community. Limited time for socialization, lack of understanding of the PPDB mechanism with the zoning system, and uneven educational standards are some of the obstacles in its implementation in the field.","Rachmadhany, Fitri; Sugiarto, Sugiarto; Matin, Matin; en,",Journal Of Education Research And Evaluation,105,8

With repercussions on working conditions and the public image of journalists, these variables are, however, only the most visible face of threats to an activity that, according to Nelson Traquina (2002), has a symbiotic relationship with democracy. Beyond these economic, social and cultural circumstances are also the expectations of the professionals themselves. In an occupation so often described as passionate, the professional situation seems to be less and less rewarding, not only due to the decrease in job opportunities, with newsrooms increasingly empty, but also due to the lack of perspective on career progression. This is one of the results of the “Study on the Effects of the State of Emergency on Journalism in the Context of the Covid-19 Pandemic”, conducted between May and June 2020. With a particular focus on reading journalists’ expectations, in this article we analyse the symbolic representations of a job that founded its social legitimacy on an idea of public service. Based on studies about the profession and its representations, we tried to find answers to understand why the acceptance of precariousness and abandonment of the profession can still be understood as places of resistance. © 2021.

The impact of the increase in COVID-19 cases and deaths in the country and the increase in the number of cases and deaths outside the country may vary. To examine this, the study employs the bootstrap ARDL cointegration approach from March 8, 2020 to May 24, 2020. According to the bootstrap ARDL results, a long-run equilibrium relationship is confirmed for five out of the ten models. The long-term coefficients obtained from the ARDL models suggest that an increase in COVID-19 cases and deaths outside of the UK and the US has a significant effect on economic policy uncertainty. The US is more affected by the increase in the number of COVID-19 cases. The UK, on the other hand, is more negatively affected by the increase in the number of COVID-19 deaths outside the country than the increase in the number of cases. Moreover, another significant finding from the study demonstrates that COVID-19 is a factor of great uncertainty for both countries in the short-term. Copyright © 2020 Ugur Korkut Pata.

Because of its strong infection rate, people avoided gathering. In these circumstances, public worship, which is the heartbeat of the church, has declined. The decline in participation is especially true among one group of marginalized people: the people who are cognitively challenged. Traditionally, the Korean Church has not had much concern about the matter of public worship and the sacraments for those who are cognitively challenged, except for a few churches which have special departments for ministries to special populations. During the COVID-19 situation, these ministries have slowed, which means that those who benefited have had few opportunities to join worship services or participate in religious education. Going forward, there is a high possibility of another pandemic. Therefore, it is time to prepare for the future. Some churches have utilized online worship and Zoom meetings, showing that the cognitively challenged can effectively participate in online worship and religious education if family members can help them.

Prokaryotic Argonaute proteins (pAgos) share a high degree of structural homology with eukaryotic Argonaute proteins (eAgos) and eAgos are considered to evolve from pAgos. However, the majority of studied pAgos prefer to cleave DNA targets, and eAgos exclusively cleave RNA targets. Here, we characterize a novel pAgo, MbpAgo, from psychrotolerant bacteria Mucilaginibacter paludis that can be programmed with DNA guides and prefers to cleave RNA targets rather than DNA targets. MbpAgo can be active at a wide range of temperatures (4-65°C). In comparison with previously studied pAgos, MbpAgo is able to utilize 16-nt long 5’phosphorylated and 5’hydroxylated DNA guides for efficient and precise cleavage and displays no obvious preference for the 5’end nucleotide of a guide. Furthermore, the cleavage efficiency can be regulated by mismatches in the central and 3’supplementary regions of the guide. MbpAgo can efficiently cleave highly-structured RNA targets using both 5’phosphorylated and 5’hydroxylated DNA guides in the presence of Mg2+ or Mn2+. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that MbpAgo is a unique programmable nuclease that has a strong preference for RNA targets, with great potential applications in the field of nucleic acid biotechnology.","Li, Wenqiang; Liu, Yang; Wang, Fei; Ma, Lixin",bioRxiv,105,15

This paper considers the key challenge of reimagining securitization in the aftermath of COVID-19 and makes two core arguments. The first is that in addressing precarity a key starting point lies in being mindful of how it is differentially experienced across multiple social hierarchies in the human world. The paper draws upon Judith Butler’s work on ‘frames of seeing’ to consider how our current moment can elicit a contrapuntal concern for those who have always been precarious but not in view. The second core argument is that it is vital to move beyond a concern for human precarity to a concern for a broader sense of planetary precarity, which in turn prompts the need to strategize for a ‘more-than-human’ sense of security. Developing the concept of ‘human security’, the paper reflects on how we can usefully envision a ‘more-than-human security’ for a more biologically stable and sustainable planet. © 2021 by the authors;licensee Librello, Switzerland.","Morrissey, J.",Journal of Human Security,105,19

The benefits of measuring PCT in the Emergency Department (ED) are not yet fully characterised. 2. PCT is widely used in the intensive care setting to guide antimicrobial prescribing. WHAT THIS ADDS? Measurement of PCT as a routine in the emergency department for all patients treated for possible sepsis identifies a high-risk cohort. KEY IMPROVEMENT IN PATIENT CARE: 1. A PCT measurement of >0.2ug/L in the Emergency Department identifies a patient at increased risk of deterioration and of in-hospital death. BACKGROUND: Early recognition and management of sepsis in the Emergency Department (ED) is a clinical challenge. Our aim was to determine if measuring the biomarker PCT in patients with suspected sepsis enables the identification of patients at increased risk of deterioration or in-hospital death in the ED setting of a district general hospital in the United Kingdom. METHODS: A prospective observational study was conducted on all patients aged 18 and over presenting to ED fulfilling NICE criteria for moderate to high risk of sepsis admitted to hospital. Patients had a PCT test alongside the sepsis six protocol. PCT was measured using Brahms’s chemiluminescent micro particle assay (CMIA) for the quantitative determination of PCT in human serum and plasma on the Abbott Alinity I analytical platform. The cost per test was approximately 13 GBP. The analysis was performed on patients having a PCT in ED over a 7-month period, with in-depth scrutiny of an appropriate subgroup. A high level quality improvement (QI) approach was used in the study. RESULTS: A total of 1242 patients were included in the study. Mean/median age was 67.9/72, (range 18-102). 88.7% of deaths occurred in patients over 65 years of age. 42.4% (n=532) had a PCT level in ED of >0.2 ug/L. This identified a high risk group with a 2.4 fold increase in mortality rate (7.7%:18.2% p value <0.001). The median length of stay (LOS) was 5 (IQR 9) and 8 days (IQR 11) in patients with a first PCT of ≤0.2 ug/L versus >0.2 ug/L respectively. CONCLUSION: An immediate PCT on patients presenting to ED with signs of sepsis in a non-specialised acute trust identifies those patients at an increased risk of deterioration and in hospital death.","Lucas, Georgia; Bartolf, Angela; Kroll, Nicholas; De Thabrew, Agampodi-Umanda; Murtaza, Zoya; Kumar, Siddarth; Gani, Abrar; Annoni, Andrea; Parsons, Marie; Pardoe, Helen",EJIFCC,105,1

Using preinitiation RNA replication complexes formed in these reactions, we demonstrated that the 3' NTR of poliovirus RNA was insufficient, by itself, to recruit the viral replication proteins required for negative-strand RNA synthesis. The 5'-terminal cloverleaf of poliovirus RNA was required in cis to form functional preinitiation RNA replication complexes capable of uridylylating VPg and initiating the synthesis of negative-strand RNA. These results are consistent with a model in which the 5'-terminal cloverleaf and 3' NTRs of poliovirus RNA interact via temporally dynamic ribonucleoprotein complexes to coordinately mediate and regulate the sequential translation and replication of poliovirus RNA.","Lyons, T; Murray, K E; Roberts, A W; Barton, D J",Journal of virology,105,1

187747,187747,187747,Antisense oligonucleotides: the state of the art.,12.1064625,7.206433,2005,"Citrus tristeza virus (CTV), a member of the Closteroviridae, has a 19.3-kb positive-stranded RNA genome that is organized into 12 open reading frames (ORFs) with the 10 3' genes expressed via a nested set of nine or ten 3'-coterminal subgenomic mRNAs (sgRNAs). Relatively large amounts of negative-stranded RNAs complementary to both genomic and sgRNAs accumulate in infected cells. As is characteristic of RNA viruses, wild-type CTV produced more positive than negative strands, with the plus-to-minus ratios of genomic and sgRNAs estimated at 10 to 20:1 and 40 to 50:1, respectively. However, a mutant with all of the 3' genes deleted replicated efficiently, but produced plus to minus strands at a markedly decreased ratio of 1 to 2:1. Deletion analysis of 3'-end genes revealed that the p23 ORF was involved in asymmetric RNA accumulation. A mutation which caused a frameshift after the fifth codon resulted in nearly symmetrical RNA accumulation, suggesting that the p23 protein, not a cis-acting element within the p23 ORF, controls asymmetric accumulation of CTV RNAs. Further in-frame deletion mutations in the p23 ORF suggested that amino acid residues 46 to 180, which contained RNA-binding and zinc finger domains, were indispensable for asymmetrical RNA accumulation, while the N-terminal 5 to 45 and C-terminal 181 to 209 amino acid residues were not absolutely required. Mutation of conserved cysteine residues to alanines in the zinc finger domain resulted in loss of activity of the p23 protein, suggesting involvement of the zinc finger in asymmetric RNA accumulation. The absence of p23 gene function was manifested by substantial increases in accumulation of negative-stranded RNAs and only modest decreases in positive-stranded RNAs. Moreover, the substantial decrease in the accumulation of negative-stranded coat protein (CP) sgRNA in the presence of the functional p23 gene resulted in a 12- to 15-fold increase in the expression of the CP gene. Apparently the excess negative-stranded sgRNA reduces the availability of the corresponding positive-stranded sgRNA as a messenger. Thus, the p23 protein controls asymmetric accumulation of CTV RNAs by downregulating negative-stranded RNA accumulation and indirectly increases expression of 3' genes.","Satyanarayana, Tatineni; Gowda, Siddarame; Ayllón, María A; Albiach-Martí, María R; Rabindran, Shailaja; Dawson, William O",Journal of virology,105,7

The aim of this study was the characterization of COVID-19 cases detected during this period. METHODS We analyzed certain variables of interest coming from the epidemiological surveys carried out in an area of Madrid during May 2020, and stratified the results depending on its temporal relation with the deescalation. Prevalence for each category of response and average duration in minutes of the telephonic call were calculated. Confidence intervals were estimated at 95%. RESULTS We included 167 cases, being 30.5% of them incident and 49.1% prevalent. The main source of infection was home (38.0%; CI 95% 31.4-46.2). Regarding healthcare and social care workers, the main source of infection was workplace (93.0%; 85.4-100). Average number of close contacts per case was 2.0 (1.8-2.2), being 1.5 (1.0-2.0) among pre-deescalation incident cases and 2.4 (1.8-3.0) among those post-deescalation. Average duration of each survey was 35.9 minutes (32.2-38.9), being 32.1 (24.4-39.8) among pre-deescalation incident cases and 37.0 (29.6-44.4) among those post-deescalation. Most of the contacts were household, both before and after beginning of deescalation. CONCLUSIONS Home is the most prevalent place for the acquisition of the infection among general population, while workplace is the most prevalent among healthcare and social care workers. The initial phase of deescalation do not represents a change regarding sources of infection, but it may increase the number of close contacts.","Pérez Romero, César; Serrano Pareja, Manuela; Rumayor Zarzuelo, Mercedes; Mata Pariente, Nelva; Hernando García, Margarita",Revista espanola de salud publica,105,12

METHODS Using the decomposition method of life expectancy, the contribution of each disease category to the life expectancy gap was quantitatively expressed as the number of years of life. The smoking attributable fraction (SAF) was calculated for each city and county based on their respective smoking prevalence and relative risk for each smoking related disease. The smoking attributable gap (SAG) in life expectancy between two sites is the sum of the difference in SAF between two sites for each smoking related disease multiplied by the number of years this disease contributed to the life expectancy gap. RESULTS Significant health and smoking disparities were present among the 23 cities and counties in Taiwan. These health disparities and smoking disparities were highly correlated (R2 = 0.3676). Generally, the health gap increased with increasing smoking disparity. The disparity in smoking prevalence and intensity among cities and counties in Taiwan was responsible for up to 19% of the health disparity. The health disparity is also highly correlated (R2 = 0.3745) with SAG in life expectancy. CONCLUSIONS Reducing smoking is important to health, and reducing the smoking disparity is also important for reducing the health disparity observed in Taiwan. The larger the health disparity is, the more important the smoking attributable disparity could be. The reduction of smoking disparities could be a realistic and cost effective way toward reducing health disparities.","Cheng, T Y; Wen, C P; Tsai, S P; Chung, W S I; Hsu, C C",Tobacco control,105,20

Over-the-counter zinc lozenges are used commonly by the general population, including people with diabetes. The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of sugar-free Cold-Eeze (The Quigley Corp., Doylestown, PA), a commonly used zinc preparation, on glucose control in patients maintained on stable antidiabetic therapy. Forty-eight patients with either type 1 (n = 3) or type 2 (n = 45) diabetes were randomized in a 3:1 ratio to receive either zinc lozenges (four to six lozenges/day for 10 days) or matching placebo. The primary endpoint was change in serum fructosamine concentration. Secondary endpoints included daily home glucose and fasting blood glucose monitoring (baseline, days 10 and 21). The mean age for all patients was 54 years (range, 25 to 76), with slightly more women (60%). The treatment groups did not differ with respect to age, sex, body mass index, duration of diabetes, baseline hemoglobin A1C level, or fasting plasma glucose level. The patients treated with placebo (n = 13) and zinc (n = 34) had similar fructosamine levels (mean +/- SD) at baseline (318 +/- 90 versus 297 +/- 86 micromol/l, respectively). After 10 days of dosing, both groups showed modest reductions in serum fructosamine (-7 +/- 42 and -9 +/- 90 micromol/l). These changes were not statistically significant. In conclusion, these findings suggest that sugar-free zinc lozenges can be administered safely to patients with diabetes without deleterious effects on glycemic control.","Schwartz, S L; Fischer, J S; Kipnes, M S",American journal of therapeutics,105,1

In animal cells, TMD length is a major factor in Golgi retention. In yeast, the role of TMD signals is less clear; it has been proposed that membrane proteins travel by default to the vacuole, and are prevented from doing so by cytoplasmic signals. We have investigated the targeting of the yeast endoplasmic reticulum (ER) t-SNARE Ufe1p. We show that the amino acid sequence of the Ufe1p TMD is important for both function and ER targeting, and that the requirements for each are distinct. Targeting is independent of Rer1p, the only candidate sorting receptor for TMD sequences currently known. Lengthening the Ufe1p TMD allows transport along the secretory pathway to the vacuole or plasma membrane. The choice between these destinations is determined by the length and composition of the TMD, but not by its precise sequence. A longer TMD is required to reach the plasma membrane in yeast than in animal cells, and shorter TMDs direct proteins to the vacuole. TMD-based sorting is therefore a general feature of the yeast secretory pathway, but occurs by different mechanisms at different points.","Rayner, J C; Pelham, H R",The EMBO journal,105,31

Healthcare workers assigned low importance to personal protective equipment and showed mixed attitudes (anxious but accepting) to the potential risk. Institutional gaps existed in preparedness across hospitals and most hospitals lacked the specificity to cope with a pandemic. A higher level of institutional preparedness, as determined by expertise as well as general and specific countermeasures, was an important predictor of individual recognition of preventive measures, perception of institutional measures, and attitude toward coping with risk. A higher level of institutional preparedness stood out to be an important predictor of individual preparedness.

In this paper, we develop an inferential method based on ideas from conformal prediction, which can wrap around any survival prediction algorithm to produce calibrated, covariate-dependent lower predictive bounds on survival times. In the Type I right-censoring setting, when the censoring times are completely exogenous, the lower predictive bounds have guaranteed coverage in finite samples without any assumptions other than that of operating on independent and identically distributed data points. Under a more general conditionally independent censoring assumption, the bounds satisfy a doubly robust property which states the following: marginal coverage is approximately guaranteed if either the censoring mechanism or the conditional survival function is estimated well. Further, we demonstrate that the lower predictive bounds remain valid and informative for other types of censoring. The validity and efficiency of our procedure are demonstrated on synthetic data and real COVID-19 data from the UK Biobank.","Candès, Emmanuel J; Lei, Lihua; Ren, Zhimei",ArXiv,105,1

Accumulation of the viral envelope proteins at this compartment is a prerequisite for virus assembly. Previously, we reported the identification of a dibasic motif (KxHxx) in the cytoplasmic tail of the SARS CoV spike (S) protein that was similar to a canonical dilysine ER retrieval signal. Here we demonstrate that this motif is a novel and functional ER retrieval signal which reduced the rate of traffic of the full-length S protein through the Golgi complex. The KxHxx motif also partially retained two different reporter proteins in the ERGIC region and reduced their rates of trafficking, although the motif was less potent than the canonical dilysine signal. The dibasic motif bound the coatomer complex I (COPI) in an in vitro binding assay, suggesting that ER retrieval may contribute to the accumulation of SARS CoV S protein near the virus assembly site for interaction with other viral structural proteins. In support of this, we found that the dibasic motif on the SARS S protein was required for its localization to the ERGIC/Golgi region when coexpressed with SARS membrane (M) protein. Thus, the cycling of SARS S through the ER-Golgi system may be required for its incorporation into assembling virions in the ERGIC.","McBride, Corrin E; Li, Jie; Machamer, Carolyn E",Journal of virology,105,28

It also examines the current state of health care for older people. Long-term stays characterize hospital care. Most geriatric syndromes are less common in hospitalized older people (e.g., delirium, falls), but some (e.g., polypharmacy) are more common. A high volume of patients and brief targeted visits characterize outpatient care. Nursing homes exist in China, but relatively fewer than in the most developed countries. Geriatric departments in university-based hospitals primarily have developed out of a need to care for retired government officials and workers. There are no formal geriatric fellowships or national board certifications in geriatrics Health care is primarily based on fee for service. Not all elderly have healthcare insurance. Although costs of health care and medications are less expensive than in the United States, they are relatively high for lower- and middle-class Chinese and have increased more quickly than has the standard of living in the past 20 years. Family and community support for older people is strong in China. Some older people have one-to-one care from a baomu (literally ""protection"" (bao) ""mother"" (mu)), a type of live-in maid who also provides care for the older person. Some of the challenges facing China in the care of its aging population are how to increase geriatric research and training, how to care for the uninsured or underinsured, and how to handle the inevitable growth of disabled and frail older people.","Flaherty, Joseph Henry; Liu, Mei Lin; Ding, Lei; Dong, Birong; Ding, Qunfang; Li, Xia; Xiao, Shifu",Journal of the American Geriatrics Society,105,1

Herein, we report our initial experience and short-term outcomes of the first 100 robotic hepatectomies. With Institutional Review Board approval, all patients undergoing robotic hepatectomy were prospectively followed up. Patient demographics, operative outcomes, complications, and 30-day readmissions were collected and analyzed. Data are presented as median (mean ± SD). One hundred consecutive patients underwent robotic hepatectomy. Patients were aged 62 (63 ± 13.6) years, 66 per cent were women, and BMI was 29 (29 ± 6.4) kg/m². In all, 76 per cent of the hepatectomies were undertaken for malignancy [metastatic colorectal cancer (28%), hepatocellular carcinoma (21%), and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (15%)], and 20 per cent for benign lesions; 66 per cent of patients underwent nonanatomical partial hepatectomies, 17 per cent right hepatectomies, 16 per cent left hepatectomies, and 1 per cent trisegmentectomy. Operative time was 233 (268 ± 109.3) minutes, and the estimated blood loss was 123 (269 ± 322.1) mL. Conversion to ""open"" approach was necessary in one patient. The length of stay was 3 (5 ± 4.6) days. There were no intraoperative complications. Twelve patients experienced postoperative complications. Six patients required readmission to the hospital within 30 days of discharge. Robotic hepatectomy is safe and feasible with favorable short-term outcomes.

This structure is the result of a combination of four sub-units called globin and indicates the dynamic interaction between them. Each subunit has a ring-shaped organic molecule called a heme that contains an iron atom; Heme is a group that mediates the reversible binding of oxygen by hemoglobin. This research was performed to observe the image of Hb by an atomic force microscope (AFM) and measure the physical function of athletes. For this purpose, based on the principle of AFM imaging, the hemoglobin crosslinking method was used to measure the morphology and size of cross-linked Hb, glutaraldehyde and Hb diameter were detected to prepare cross-linked Hb samples with different molar ratio, the activity of peroxidase was detected by Trinder reaction. The AFM was used to detect the influence of physiological environment changes such as pH, temperature, oxygen partial pressure and osmotic pressure on the absorption spectrum of Hb imaging. Results showed that the size of the uncrosslinked Hb was 6.64 nm. With the increase of the molar ratio of glutaraldehyde to Hb, the number of Hb molecules involved in the crosslinking increased, and the molecular size increased. During the crosslinking process, the aggregation of the cross-linked molecules would make the particle size of some Hb molecules reach 80-100 nm. The peak height, peak position and peak shape of the characteristic absorption peaks of pH to hemoglobin at 550 and 589 nm occurred. When the temperature changes continuously in the range of 30-55℃, the peak height of Hb absorption spectrum of normal red blood cells at 550 nm and 589 nm decreases gradually with the increase of temperature, and the peak shape at 610 nm changes obviously at 42℃, which indicates that the molecular structure of Hb changes; the absorption spectrum curve of deoxygenation disappears at 500 nm, the oxygen-binding capacity of Hb is very low, and the oxygen affinity and oxygenated hemoglobin are low (The concentration of HbO2) decreased, the osmotic pressure increased, the RBC dehydrated, the volume decreased, and the concentration of Hb increased. Conclusion: It is more accurate and comprehensive to use AFM to observe athletes' hemoglobin.","Zhang, Guojun; Luo, Weidong; Hajee, Shereen Ismail; Gong, HanCheng",Cellular and molecular biology,105,17

Although both factors were important during the first and the largest hospital outbreak in Hong Kong, the relative importance of different routes of infection has not yet been quantified. We estimated the parameters of a novel mathematical model of hospital infection using SARS episode data. These estimates described levels of transmission between the index super-spreader, staff and patients, and were used to compare three plausible hypotheses. The broadest of the supported hypotheses ascribes the initial surge in cases to a single super-spreading individual and suggests that the per capita risk of infection to patients increased approximately one month after the start of the outbreak. Our estimate for the number of cases caused by the SSE is substantially lower than the previously reported values, which were mostly based on self-reported exposure information. This discrepancy suggests that the early identification of the index case as a super-spreader might have led to biased contact tracing, resulting in too few cases being attributed to staff-to-staff transmission. We propose that in future outbreaks of SARS or other directly transmissible respiratory pathogens, simple mathematical models could be used to validate preliminary conclusions concerning the relative importance of different routes of transmission with important implications for infection control.","Kwok, Kin On; Leung, Gabriel M; Lam, Wai Yee; Riley, Steven",Proceedings.

Little is known about the control measures implemented during this outbreak. OBJECTIVE To describe and evaluate the measures undertaken to control the SARS outbreak. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Data were reviewed from standardized surveillance forms from SARS cases (2521 probable cases) and their close contacts observed in Beijing between March 5, 2003, and May 29, 2003. Procedures implemented by health authorities were investigated through review of official documents and discussions with public health officials. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Timeline of major control measures; number of cases and quarantined close contacts and attack rates, with changes in infection control measures, management, and triage of suspected cases; and time lag between illness onset and hospitalization with information dissemination. RESULTS Health care worker training in use of personal protective equipment and management of patients with SARS and establishing fever clinics and designated SARS wards in hospitals predated the steepest decline in cases. During the outbreak, 30 178 persons were quarantined. Among 2195 quarantined close contacts in 5 districts, the attack rate was 6.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 5.3%-7.3%), with a range of 15.4% (95% CI, 11.5%-19.2%) among spouses to 0.36% (95% CI, 0%-0.77%) among work and school contacts. The attack rate among quarantined household members increased with age from 5.0% (95% CI, 0%-10.5%) in children younger than 10 years to 27.6% (95% CI, 18.2%-37.0%) in adults aged 60 to 69 years. Among almost 14 million people screened for fever at the airport, train stations, and roadside checkpoints, only 12 were found to have probable SARS. The national and municipal governments held 13 press conferences about SARS. The time lag between illness onset and hospitalization decreased from a median of 5 to 6 days on or before April 20, 2003, the day the outbreak was announced to the public, to 2 days after April 20 (P<.001). CONCLUSIONS The rapid resolution of the SARS outbreak was multifactorial, involving improvements in management and triage in hospitals and communities of patients with suspected SARS and the dissemination of information to health care workers and the public.","Pang, Xinghuo; Zhu, Zonghan; Xu, Fujie; Guo, Jiyong; Gong, Xiaohong; Liu, Donglei; Liu, Zejun; Chin, Daniel P; Feikin, Daniel R",JAMA,105,16

The clinical symptoms are non-specific and during the first few days in particular, are not clinically distinguishable from those of many other viral or bacterial infections. The majority of infected patients develop pneumonia within a week of the first symptoms appearing. Since November 2002 the virus has spread from South China to almost 30 other countries, where about 8500 infected individuals have been registered; about 800 people have already died from the disease (9.5%). The number of infected persons includes a noticeably high percentage of health workers. This fact underlines the importance of good infection prevention measures for each patient contact. The implementation of hygienic measures requires attention, because the infection of personnel in Toronto hospitals still occurred after the virus and transmission routes were known. It appears that transmission can be prevented with relatively simple precautions, as long as these are consistently implemented. Early recognition and isolation of a possible source are an essential part of this. SARS is a group A notifiable disease (report if suspected). In the Netherlands the general practitioner has a prominent role in assessing and treating individuals who are infected or might be infected with SARS-CoV.

Mice were inoculated intranasally with isolate 771076 of Sendai virus, then killed at 2-day intervals beginning on day 4 post-inoculation. Clinical signs were evident beginning at 8 to 10 days post-inoculation, and all animals remaining were killed in extremis by 14 to 17 days post-inoculation. Lesions in inoculated mice were confined to the respiratory tract. In the nasal passages, a nonresolving rhinitis, with epithelial hyperplasia/metaplasia occurred. Cranioventral bronchopneumonitis was characterized by marked hyperplasia and necrosis of epithelial cells lining airways and with leukocytic infiltration. At the alveolar level, there was marked hypertrophy and hyperplasia of type II pneumocytes, mobilization of alveolar macrophages, and obliteration of the normal architecture in severely affected areas. Viral antigen was evident beginning at 4 days post-inoculation and persisted in affected areas throughout the duration of the study. Because immunocompetent C57BL/6 mice are known to be genetically resistant to Sendai virus, the susceptibility of C57BL/6 SCID-beige to Sendai virus was then compared to that of C.B-17 SCID-beige mice. In age-matched animals of the two strains, there was no evidence of natural resistance to Sendai virus infection in the immunodeficient C57BL/6 strain compared to the C.B-17 mice. These studies indicate that the genetic differences in susceptibility of two strains of immunocompetent mice to Sendai virus infection are eliminated by expression of the mutations scid and beige.","Percy, D H; Auger, D C; Croy, B A",Veterinary pathology,105,28

The availability of random peptide libraries (RPL) displayed on phage has provided a powerful tool for selecting sequences that mimic epitopes from microorganisms that are useful for diagnostic and vaccine development purposes. In this paper, we describe peptides that resemble the antigenic structure of B-cell epitopes of dengue virus identified from a phage-peptide library using human sera containing polyclonal antibodies against dengue virus. MATERIALS AND METHODS Eighteen phage clones were isolated from the phage-display peptide library, J404, by affinity selection using human antisera against dengue virus type 3. These clones were tested for reactivity by ELISA with a panel of hyperimmune ascitic fluids (HAFs) containing antibodies either against all four dengue serotypes, West Nile virus (WNV) or Eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV) with control ascitic fluid (NAF) used as a negative control. RESULTS Eight clones were recognized by HAFs against the four dengue serotypes, of which four significantly inhibited binding of anti-dengue antibodies to the virus. Two peptides with similar sequences to regions of NS3 and NS4B non-structural dengue virus proteins were identified. CONCLUSION Our results suggest that these peptides could be used for the development of diagnostic tools for the detection of dengue virus infection and for a potential vaccine against this pathogen.","Amin, Nevis; Aguilar, Alicia; Chamacho, Frank; Vázquez, Yaime; Pupo, Maritza; Ramirez, Juan Carlos; Izquierdo, Luis; Dafhnis, Felix; Stott, David Ian; Perez, Ela Maria; Acosta, Armando",The Malaysian journal of medical sciences : MJMS,105,16

Patients in the control group received the general anesthesia, while those in the observation group received spinal-epidural anesthesia, and intravenous injection of dexmedetomidine. For maintenance of anesthesia, ropivacaine was adopted for both groups. Before anesthesia, at 30 min and 60 min after anesthesia, we measured the heart rate (HR), bispectral index (BIS) and sedative effect. Before anesthesia, HR, BIS and Ramsay scores were compared between two groups, and the results showed that differences had no statistical significance (p>0.05); but at 30 min after anesthesia, HR and BIS of patients in the observation group were significantly lower than those in the control group (p<0.05), and Ramsay score was higher than the control group (p<0.05). No statistical significance was found in differences of the incidence rate of adverse reactions between two groups (p>0.05). Application of dexmedetomidine in spinal-epidural anesthesia gains promising sedative effect and safety in hysteromyomectomy, which is worthy of being promoted in clinical treatment.","Liu, Xin-Fa; Gao, Yong-Tao",Pakistan journal of pharmaceutical sciences,105,16

DESIGN The process included a modified Delphi method, a consensus conference, several subsequent smaller meetings of subgroups and key individuals, teleconferences, and electronic-based discussion among subgroups and among the entire committee. METHODS The modified Delphi methodology used for grading recommendations built on a 2001 publication sponsored by the International Sepsis Forum. We undertook a systematic review of the literature graded along five levels to create recommendation grades from A to E, with A being the highest grade. Pediatric considerations to contrast adult and pediatric management are in the article by Parker et al. on p. S591. CONCLUSION Immunosuppressed patients, by definition, are susceptible to a wider spectrum of infectious agents than immunologically normal patients and, thus, require a broader spectrum antimicrobial regimen when they present with sepsis or septic shock. Special expertise managing immunosuppressed patient populations is needed to predict and establish the correct diagnosis and to choose appropriate empiric and specific agents and maximize the likelihood that patients will survive these microbial challenges.","Gea-Banacloche, Juan C; Opal, Steven M; Jorgensen, James; Carcillo, Joseph A; Sepkowitz, Kent A; Cordonnier, Catherine",Critical care medicine,105,16

AIM: To reveal the symptoms of musculoskeletal system in COVID-19 patients, to evaluate myalgia, arthralgia and physical/mental fatigue, to assess handgrip muscle strength, and to examine the relations of these parameters with the severity and laboratory values of the disease. DESIGN: This study was designed as a cross-sectional, single-center case series. SETTING: This study took place from May 15,2020, to June 30, 2020 at the Istanbul University-Cerrahpasa, Cerrahpasa Pandemia Services. POPULATION: Hospitalized 150 adults with laboratory and radiological confirmation of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) according to WHO interim guidance were included in the study. METHODS: The disease severity 2007 idsa/ats guidelines for community acquired pneumonia was used. Myalgia severity was assessed by numerical rating scale (NRS). Visual analog scale and Chalder Fatigue Scale (CFS) were used for fatigue severity determination. Handgrip strength (HGS) was measured by Jamar hand dynamometer. RESULTS: 103 patients (68.7%) were non-severe and 47 patients (31.3%) were severe. The most common musculoskeletal symptom was fatigue (133 [85.3%]), followed by myalgia (102 [68.0%]), arthralgia (65 [43.3%]) and back pain (33 [22.0%]). Arthralgia, which was mostly notable at wrist (25 [16.7%]), ankle (24 [16.0%]) and knee (23 [15.3%]) joints, was significantly higher among the severe group. Severe myalgia was prevalent among myalgia sufferers regardless of COVID-19 severity. The physical fatigue severity score was significantly higher in severe cases, whereas this difference was not significant in mental fatigue score. Female patients with severe infection had ""lower"" grip strength, whereas grip strength among males did not differ significantly between non-severe and severe COVID-19 cases. Nevertheless the mean values in both genders and in age decades were below the specified normative values. CRP, ferritin, and LDH levels were significantly higher in women with ""lower"" grip strength compared to the ""normal"" group. CONCLUSIONS: Aside from other multi-systemic symptoms, musculoskeletal symptoms are quite common in patients with COVID-19. Patients have severe ischemic myalgia regardless of disease activity. Although there is a muscle weakness in all patients, the loss of muscle function is more of a problem among women in connection with disease severity. Muscular involvement in coronavirus disease is a triangle of myalgia, physical fatigue, and muscle weakness. CLINICAL REHABILITATION IMPACT: Muscle involvement in COVID-19 patients does not mean only myalgia but also a combination of physical fatigue and muscle weakness, and this should be considered in planning the rehabilitation strategies of COVID-19 patients.","Tuzun, Sansin; Keles, Aslinur; Okutan, Dilara; Yildiran, Tugbay; Palamar, Deniz",Eur. j. phys. rehabil. med.

The average size of Ag nanoparticles is shown to be increased with decreasing of the activity of reducing agent (E0) and equals to 3.8 nm, 4.3 nm, and 15.8 nm, respectively, when engaging sodium borohydride (-1.24 V), hydrazine (-1.15 V) and ascorbic acid (-0.35 V). Moreover, it was found that the crystallite size of Ag nanoparticles also had the smallest value for nanocomposites obtained involving NaBH4 as reducing agent. Ag-containing nanocomposites prepared by reduction of silver ions in interpolyelectrolyte-metal complexes while applying a range of reducing agents are characterized by different electrical properties and polymer matrix' glass transition temperature. The influence of silver nanoparticles' size incorporated in the polymer matrix on the antimicrobial activity of nanocomposites has been established. The inhibition zone diameter of Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli was higher for nanocomposites obtained using sodium borohydride and hydrazine compared to nanocomposites where ascorbic acid was used as the reducing agent.","Demchenko, V; Riabov, S; Kobylinskyi, S; Goncharenko, L; Rybalchenko, N; Kruk, A; Moskalenko, O; Shut, M",Sci Rep,105,24

Increasing evidence suggests that neutralizing antibody (NAb) responses are a primary mechanism of protection against infection. However, little is known about the extent and mechanisms by which natural immunity acquired during the early COVID-19 pandemic confers cross-neutralization of emerging variants. In this study, we investigated cross-neutralization of the B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 SARS-CoV-2 variants in a well-characterized cohort of early pandemic convalescent subjects. We observed modestly decreased cross-neutralization of B.1.1.7 but a substantial 4.8-fold reduction in cross-neutralization of B.1.351. Correlates of cross-neutralization included receptor binding domain (RBD) and N-terminal domain (NTD) binding antibodies, homologous NAb titers, and Membrane-directed T cell responses. These data shed light on cross-neutralization of emerging variants by early pandemic convalescent immune responses.IMPORTANCEWidespread immunity to SARS-CoV-2 will be necessary to end the COVID-19 pandemic. Neutralizing antibody (NAb) responses are a critical component of immunity that can be stimulated by natural infection as well as vaccines. However, SARS-CoV-2 variants are emerging that contain mutations in the Spike gene that promote evasion from NAb responses. These variants may therefore delay control of the COVID-19 pandemic. We studied whether NAb responses from early COVID-19 convalescent patients are effective against the two SARS-CoV-2 variants B.1.1.7 and B.1.351. We observed that the B.1.351 variant demonstrates significantly reduced susceptibility to early pandemic NAb responses. We additionally characterized virologic, immunologic, and clinical features that correlate with cross-neutralization. These studies increase our understanding of emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants.","Vidal, Samuel J; Collier, Ai-Ris Y; Yu, Jingyou; McMahan, Katherine; Tostanoski, Lisa H; Ventura, John D; Aid, Malika; Peter, Lauren; Jacob-Dolan, Catherine; Anioke, Tochi; Chang, Aiquan; Wan, Huahua; Aguayo, Ricardo; Ngo, Debby; Gerszten, Robert E; Seaman, Michael S; Barouch, Dan H",J. virol,105,1

However, when the crisis evolved into a more enduring one, a more contested policy arena emerged in which decision-makers had a hard time composing and defending a united decision-making strategy. Measures have become increasingly debated on all policy levels as well as among experts, and conflicts are widely covered in the Dutch media.

Blood samples were tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay D-5501 SARS-Cov-2-IgG-EIA-BEST and D-5502 SARS-Cov-2-IgM-EIA-BEST (AO Vector-Best, Novosibirsk, Russia). The overall seropositivity rate was 28.33–28.53%.

Higher IgG and IgM titers were observed in women compared to men, as well as in participants in the symptomatic group compared to those in the high-risk group. The results indicate that the seroprevalence among residents in several Russian regions is low (28.38%) and inadequate to provide herd immunity. The lower seroprevalence among participants in the high-risk group may be attributed to the enforcement of healthcare protocols and the use of adequate personal protective equipment.","Zurochka, Alexandr Dobrinina Maria Zurochka Vladimir Hu Desheng Solovyev Alexandr Ryabova Liana Kritsky Igor Ibragimov Roman Sarapultsev Alexey",Vaccines,105,1

In March 2020 Australian universities were forced into a shutdown, which prompted an unanticipated, sudden shift in education, from on-campus and face-to-face to an off-campus and online mode of teaching and learning. This paper describes the experiences of two Sydney-based university unit coordinators, from two different institutions, who rapidly shifted their units online as a result of COVID-19. In particular, it applies reflection as a research method, to share what the authors’ encountered as successful, and what was challenging about teaching online. Motivating and retaining students was a key challenge identified by the authors. Therefore, the paper discusses the authors’ application of various digital programs and tools in their response to this challenge of motivation and engagement. It is hoped that our experiences might benefit those looking to integrate programs and tools in the online teaching and learning space. Although Australia is currently one of the most successful countries in their handling of COVID-19, there is still great uncertainty about the future. Globally the pandemic shows no signs of abating, as many countries struggle to manage high levels of transmission and infection rates, which in turn have an impact on the education sector more broadly. Consequently, online learning may be the ‘new normal’ for many institutions in the near future. Therefore, it is important for educators to share their online teaching experiences that can contribute to greater understandings of this space. © 2021, The International Academic Forum (IAFOR).

Here, we determined the expression of the SARS-CoV2 receptor, angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and its associated cellular serine protease TPMRSS2 in the dental pulp under normal and inflamed conditions. Next, we explored the relationship between the SARS-CoV-2/human interactome and genes expressed in pulpitis. Using existing datasets we show that both ACE2 and TPMRSS2 are expressed in the dental pulp and, that their expression does not change under conditions of inflammation. Furthermore, Master Regulator Analysis of the SARS-CoV2/human interactome identified 75 relevant genes whose expression values are either up-regulated or down-regulated in both the human interactome and pulpitis. Our results suggest that the dental pulp is vulnerable to SARS-CoV2 infection and that SARS-CoV-2 infection of the dental pulp may contribute to worse outcomes of pulpitis.","Galicia, Johnah C; Guzzi, Pietro H; Giorgi, Federico M; Khan, Asma A",Genes Immun,105,15

DESIGN: Retrospective case series. SETTING: Tongji Hospital in Wuhan, China. PARTICIPANTS: Among a cohort of 799 patients, 113 who died and 161 who recovered with a diagnosis of covid-19 were analysed. Data were collected until 28 February 2020. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinical characteristics and laboratory findings were obtained from electronic medical records with data collection forms. RESULTS: The median age of deceased patients (68 years) was significantly older than recovered patients (51 years). Male sex was more predominant in deceased patients (83; 73%) than in recovered patients (88; 55%). Chronic hypertension and other cardiovascular comorbidities were more frequent among deceased patients (54 (48%) and 16 (14%)) than recovered patients (39 (24%) and 7 (4%)). Dyspnoea, chest tightness, and disorder of consciousness were more common in deceased patients (70 (62%), 55 (49%), and 25 (22%)) than in recovered patients (50 (31%), 48 (30%), and 1 (1%)). The median time from disease onset to death in deceased patients was 16 (interquartile range 12.0-20.0) days. Leukocytosis was present in 56 (50%) patients who died and 6 (4%) who recovered, and lymphopenia was present in 103 (91%) and 76 (47%) respectively. Concentrations of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, creatinine, creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, cardiac troponin I, N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide, and D-dimer were markedly higher in deceased patients than in recovered patients. Common complications observed more frequently in deceased patients included acute respiratory distress syndrome (113; 100%), type I respiratory failure (18/35; 51%), sepsis (113; 100%), acute cardiac injury (72/94; 77%), heart failure (41/83; 49%), alkalosis (14/35; 40%), hyperkalaemia (42; 37%), acute kidney injury (28; 25%), and hypoxic encephalopathy (23; 20%). Patients with cardiovascular comorbidity were more likely to develop cardiac complications. Regardless of history of cardiovascular disease, acute cardiac injury and heart failure were more common in deceased patients. CONCLUSION: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection can cause both pulmonary and systemic inflammation, leading to multi-organ dysfunction in patients at high risk. Acute respiratory distress syndrome and respiratory failure, sepsis, acute cardiac injury, and heart failure were the most common critical complications during exacerbation of covid-19.","Chen, Tao; Wu, Di; Chen, Huilong; Yan, Weiming; Yang, Danlei; Chen, Guang; Ma, Ke; Xu, Dong; Yu, Haijing; Wang, Hongwu; Wang, Tao; Guo, Wei; Chen, Jia; Ding, Chen; Zhang, Xiaoping; Huang, Jiaquan; Han, Meifang; Li, Shusheng; Luo, Xiaoping; Zhao, Jianping; Ning, Qin",BMJ,105,24

Previously, the accuracy of the quantitative LUMIPULSE SARS-CoV-2 antigen test was demonstrated using samples collected retrospectively. In this study, the LUMIPULSE antigen test was clinically validated using prospective samples. METHODS: In total, 1033 nasopharyngeal swab samples were collected from 1033 individuals, and an additional 275 follow-up samples were collected from 43 patients who subsequently tested positive for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). All 1308 samples were subjected to quantitative RT-PCR (RT-qPCR) and the antigen test. The antibody response was investigated for patients with discordant results to clarify if seroconversion had occurred. RESULTS: RT-qPCR identified 990 samples as negative and 43 as positive, while the antigen test identified 992 samples as negative, 37 as positive and four as inconclusive. The overall concordance rate was 99.7% (1026/1029). Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of the antigen test were 92.5% (37/40), 100% (989/989), 100% (37/37) and 99.7% (989/992), respectively, after exclusion of the four inconclusive results. The kappa coefficient was 0.960 (95% confidence interval 0.892-0.960), suggesting excellent agreement between the two tests. Seropositivity in five of seven patients with discordant results suggested that the discrepancy was caused by samples collected during the late phase of infection. Using follow-up samples, correlation was observed between the antigen level and the viral load or cycle threshold value. The concordance rate between these test results tended to be high among samples collected 0-9 days after symptom onset, but this decreased gradually in samples collected thereafter. CONCLUSIONS: This prospective study demonstrated that the LUMIPULSE antigen test is a highly accurate diagnostic test for SARS-CoV-2.","Hirotsu, Yosuke; Maejima, Makoto; Shibusawa, Masahiro; Amemiya, Kenji; Nagakubo, Yuki; Hosaka, Kazuhiro; Sueki, Hitomi; Hayakawa, Miyoko; Mochizuki, Hitoshi; Tsutsui, Toshiharu; Kakizaki, Yumiko; Miyashita, Yoshihiro; Omata, Masao",Int J Infect Dis,105,1

Based on their plasticity potential, they are divided into totipotent (morula stage cells), pluripotent (embryonic stem cells), multipotent (hematopoietic stem cells, multipotent adult progenitor stem cells, and mesenchymal stem cells [MSCs]), and unipotent (progenitor cells that differentiate into a single lineage) cells. Though bone marrow is the primary source of multipotent stem cells in adults, other tissues such as adipose tissues, placenta, amniotic fluid, umbilical cord blood, periodontal ligament, and dental pulp also harbor stem cells that can be used for regenerative therapy. In addition, induced pluripotent stem cells also exhibit fundamental properties of self-renewal and differentiation into specialized cells, and thus could be another source for regenerative medicine. Several diseases including neurodegenerative diseases, cardiovascular diseases, autoimmune diseases, virus infection (also coronavirus disease 2019) have limited success with conventional medicine, and stem cell transplantation is assumed to be the best therapy to treat these disorders. Importantly, MSCs, are by far the best for regenerative medicine due to their limited immune modulation and adequate tissue repair. Moreover, MSCs have the potential to migrate towards the damaged area, which is regulated by various factors and signaling processes. Recent studies have shown that extracellular calcium (Ca2+) promotes the proliferation of MSCs, and thus can assist in transplantation therapy. Ca2+ signaling is a highly adaptable intracellular signal that contains several components such as cell-surface receptors, Ca2+ channels/pumps/exchangers, Ca2+ buffers, and Ca2+ sensors, which together are essential for the appropriate functioning of stem cells and thus modulate their proliferative and regenerative capacity, which will be discussed in this review.","Ahamad, N.; Singh, B.

It has been sufficiently shown that sex differences have a critical influence on the shaping of immune response, which then leads to different pathogenesis in infectious diseases.

METHODS: We carried out public involvement and pilot testing in 315 volunteers to improve usability. Feedback was obtained through online discussions, questionnaires, observations and interviews of people who tried the test at home. This informed the design of a nationally representative survey of adults in England using two LFIAs (LFIA1 and LFIA2) which were sent to 10,600 and 3,800 participants, respectively, who provided further feedback. RESULTS: Public involvement and pilot testing showed high levels of acceptability, but limitations with the usability of kits. Most people reported completing the test; however, they identified difficulties with practical aspects of the kit, particularly the lancet and pipette, a need for clearer instructions and more guidance on interpretation of results. In the national study, 99.3% (8,693/8,754) of LFIA1 and 98.4% (2,911/2,957) of LFIA2 respondents attempted the test and 97.5% and 97.8% of respondents completed it, respectively. Most found the instructions easy to understand, but some reported difficulties using the pipette (LFIA1: 17.7%) and applying the blood drop to the cassette (LFIA2: 31.3%). Most respondents obtained a valid result (LFIA1: 91.5%; LFIA2: 94.4%). Overall there was substantial concordance between participant and clinician interpreted results (kappa: LFIA1 0.72; LFIA2 0.89).

RECENT FINDINGS: Currently, there is a large debate on the use of antimalarials for prophylaxis and treatment of SARS-CoV-2-induced disease based on preclinical in-vitro data, small case series and extrapolation from earlier studies of their effect on intracellular pathogens, including many viruses. Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) or chloroquine have not demonstrated robust efficacy in prior randomized controlled studies against several other viruses. In-vitro data indicate a reduced viral replication of SARS-CoV-2. Especially immunomodulatory effects of antimalarials might also contribute to a clinical efficacy. For SARS-CoV-2 various large studies will provide answers as to whether antimalarials have a place in prophylaxis or treatment of the acute virus infection with SARS-CoV-2 but compelling data are missing so far. SUMMARY: In-vitro data provide a theoretical framework for an efficacy of antimalarials in SARS-CoV-2-induced disease but clinical proof is currently missing.","Schrezenmeier, Eva V; Burmester, Gerd R; Eckardt, Kai-Uwe; Dörner, Thomas",Curr Opin Rheumatol,105,24

Animal coronaviruses rarely infect humans with the exceptions of the Middle East respiratory syndrome ( MERS-CoV ), the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus (SARS-CoV), and now SARS-CoV-2, which is the cause of the ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Several studies suggested that genetic variants in the ACE2 gene may influence the host susceptibility or resistance to SARS-CoV-2 infection according to the functional role of ACE2 in human pathophysiology. However, many of these studies have been conducted in silico based on epidemiological and population data. We therefore investigated the occurrence of ACE2 variants in a cohort of 131 Italian unrelated individuals clinically diagnosed with COVID-19 and in an Italian control population, to evaluate a possible allelic association with COVID-19, by direct DNA analysis. METHODS: As a pilot study, we analyzed, by whole-exome sequencing, genetic variants of ACE2 gene in 131 DNA samples of COVID-19 patients hospitalized at Tor Vergata University Hospital and at Bambino Gesù Children's Hospital, Rome. We used a large control group consisting of 1000 individuals (500 males and 500 females). RESULTS: We identified three different germline variants: one intronic c.439+4G>A and two missense c.1888G>C p.(Asp630His) and c.2158A>G p.(Asn720Asp) in a total of 131 patients with a similar frequency in male and female. Thus far, only the c.1888G>C p.(Asp630His) variant shows a statistically different frequency compared to the ethnically matched populations. Therefore, further studies are needed in larger cohorts, since it was found only in one heterozygous COVID-19 patient. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that there is no strong evidence, in our cohort, of consistent association of ACE2 variants with COVID-19 severity. We might speculate that rare susceptibility/resistant alleles could be located in the non-coding regions of the ACE2 gene, known to play a role in regulation of the gene activity.","Novelli, Antonio; Biancolella, Michela; Borgiani, Paola; Cocciadiferro, Dario; Colona, Vito Luigi; D039,; Apice, Maria Rosaria; Rogliani, Paola; Zaffina, Salvatore; Leonardis, Francesca; Campana, Andrea; Raponi, Massimiliano; Andreoni, Massimo; Grelli, Sandro; Novelli, Giuseppe",Hum Genomics,105,24

PARTICIPANTS: 676 participants comprising nearly an equal number of females (n 341) and males (n 335) and a majority (58·6 %) from households whose income was <£30 000. RESULTS: Our findings showed that nearly 40 % of respondents were exposed to some or a lot of CNI. We found that while exposure to CNI from TV and online news increased nutrition confusion, CNI from health professionals increased backlash. Exposure to CNI from social media and health websites was associated with reduced backlash. We also found that nutrition confusion and backlash were negatively associated with exercise behaviour and fruit and vegetable consumption, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our study supports the theoretical pathways that explain the influence of CNI exposure on nutrition-related cognitive and behavioural outcomes. Additionally, different types of online information sources are associated with these outcomes to varying degrees. In the context of obesity and diabetes rates in the UK, our findings call for (a) further experimental research into the effects of CNI on consumers' diet-related cognitions and behaviours and (b) multi-stakeholder, interdisciplinary approaches to address this problem.","Vijaykumar, Santosh; McNeill, Andrew; Simpson, Joshua",Public Health Nutr,105,18

Few studies have explored nurse perspectives regarding this communication modality for rural pediatric cohorts. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this qualitative study was to learn from the experiences of rural hospice nurses caring for children at the end of life using telehealth modalities to inform palliative communication. METHODS: Voice-recorded qualitative interviews with rural hospice nurse telehealth users inquiring on nurse experiences with telehealth. Semantic content analysis was used. RESULTS: About 15 hospice nurses representing nine rural hospice agencies were interviewed. Nurses participated in an average of eight telehealth visits in the three months prior. Nurses were female with a mean age of 38 years and an average of seven years of hospice nursing experience. Five themes about telehealth emerged: accessible support, participant inclusion, timely communication, informed and trusted planning, and familiarity fostered. Each theme had both benefits and cautions associated as well as telehealth suggestions. Nurses recommended individualizing communication, pacing content, fostering human connection, and developing relationships even with technology use. CONCLUSION: The experiences of nurses who use telehealth in their care for children receiving end-of-life care in rural regions may enable palliative care teams to understand both the benefits and challenges of telehealth use. Nurse insights on telehealth may help palliative care teams better honor the communication needs of patients and families while striving to improve care access.","Weaver, Meaghann S; Neumann, Marie L; Navaneethan, Hema; Robinson, Jacob E; Hinds, Pamela S",J. pain symptom manage,105,16

BLV DNA is generally found at higher rates in humans who have or will develop breast cancer, according to research done with subjects from several countries.

Because infection may be spread by people who are pre-symptomatic or asymptomatic, substantial undetected transmission is likely to occur before clinical cases are diagnosed. Thus, when outbreaks occur there is a need to anticipate which populations and locations are at heightened risk of exposure. In this work, we evaluate the utility of aggregate human mobility data for estimating the geographical distribution of transmission risk. We present a simple procedure for producing spatial transmission risk assessments from near-real-time population mobility data. We validate our estimates against three well-documented COVID-19 outbreaks in Australia. Two of these were well-defined transmission clusters and one was a community transmission scenario. Our results indicate that mobility data can be a good predictor of geographical patterns of exposure risk from transmission centres, particularly in outbreaks involving workplaces or other environments associated with habitual travel patterns. For community transmission scenarios, our results demonstrate that mobility data add the most value to risk predictions when case counts are low and spatially clustered. Our method could assist health systems in the allocation of testing resources, and potentially guide the implementation of geographically targeted restrictions on movement and social interaction.","Zachreson, Cameron; Mitchell, Lewis; Lydeamore, Michael J; Rebuli, Nicolas; Tomko, Martin; Geard, Nicholas",J R Soc Interface,105,29

When COVID-19 ad hoc programs are analyzed, the coverage and replacement rates of regular labor income among households in the first quintile of the country's labor income distribution increase substantially. Yet, these programs present substantial coverage challenges among families composed of fundamentally informal workers who are non-poor, but are at a high risk of poverty.

Compared to the age-matched NCs, both young and old male and female non-comorbid COVID-19 patients had lower lymphocyte counts and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) concentration, and only young male and female patients had lower neutrophil counts. Compared to young patients, both old males and females had significantly higher plasma ALT and AST concentrations. Compared to young and old females, age-matched males had higher plasma ALT and AST concentrations, but only young males had higher C-reactive protein (CRP) concentration. Compared to females, old males, but not young males, showed higher incidence of critical illness. Compared to young patients, old females had more leukocyte and neutrophil counts above the normal upper limit and B cell count below the normal lower limit (NLL), while old males had more lymphocyte and natural killer (NK) cell counts below the NLL. No sex or age associations with B cell and NK cell counts were observed. However, there were age-dependent decreases in CD8+ T-cell counts in both male and female COVID-19 patients. Age was negatively associated with CD8+ T cell counts but positively associated with neutrophil count, CRP, ALT, and AST concentrations, and sex (females) was negatively associated with neutrophil count, CRP, ALT, and AST concentrations. The present study suggests that SARS-CoV-2 infection mainly induced 1) beneficial sex (female)-related differences regarding reduced COVID-19 disease severity and negative associations with inflammatory responses and liver damage, and 2) harmful age-related differences relating to negative associations with CD8+ T cell count and positive associations with inflammatory responses and liver damage. Thus, sex and age are biological variables that should be considered in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19.","Jin, Shengwei; An, Hui; Zhou, Tong; Li, Ting; Xie, Mengzhen; Chen, Saijing; Chen, Chengshui; Ying, Binyu; Xu, Zhangye; Li, Xiaokun; Li, Ming",PLoS Pathog,105,1

This study analysed suspected suicide rates in 2020 relative to 2015-19 to assess any early effects of the COVID-19 pandemic in Queensland, Australia. METHODS: We analysed data from the interim Queensland Suicide Register (iQSR), a state-wide real-time suicide surveillance system, using an interrupted time-series design. The data source for the iQSR is the Form 1 police report of a death to a coroner. Two QSR staff independently classed the probability of a death by suicide as possible, probable, or beyond reasonable doubt. The analysis included the probable or beyond reasonable doubt categories as suspected suicides. The primary outcome was the monthly suspected suicide rate. We applied Poisson and negative binomial regressions to assess whether Queensland's Public Health Emergency Declaration on Jan 29, 2020, affected suspected suicides from Feb 1 to Aug 31, 2020. Secondary outcomes included absolute or relative changes in police-reported motives of recent unemployment, financial problems, domestic violence, and relationship breakdown. FINDINGS: 3793 suspected suicides were recorded with an unadjusted monthly rate of 14·85 deaths per 100â000 people (from Jan 1, 2015, to Jan 1, 2020) before the declaration, and 443 suspected suicides were recorded with an unadjusted monthly rate of 14·07 deaths per 100â000 people (Feb 1, 2020, onwards) after the declaration. An interrupted time-series Poisson regression model unadjusted (rate ratio [RR] 0·94, 95% CI 0·82-1·06) and adjusted for overdispersion, seasonality, and pre-exposure trends (RR 1·02, 95% CI 0·83-1·25) indicated no evidence of a change in suspected suicide rates. We found no absolute or relative increases in the motives for suspected suicides, including recent unemployment, financial problems, relationship breakdown, or domestic violence from February to August, 2020, compared with the pre-exposure period. INTERPRETATION: There does not yet appear to be an overall change in the suspected suicide rate in the 7 months since Queensland declared a public health emergency. Despite this, COVID-19 has contributed to some suspected suicides in Queensland. Ongoing community spread and increasing death rates of COVID-19, and its impact on national economies and mental health, reinforces the need for governments to maintain the monitoring and reporting of suicide mortality in real time.

Thus, this study investigates the hospital preparedness, psychological burden, and resilience of clinical nurses in addressing COVID-19 in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. A total of 281 clinical nurses participated in the survey from April 2020 to June 2020. Results show that clinical nurses perceived a high self-assessed COVID-19 hospital preparedness (49.65, SD = 2.30); high self-assessed nurses' resilience (4.03, SD = 0.36); and most have normal levels of depression, anxiety, and stress. The variables were predicted to be statistically significant (F 18,262 = 4.14, p = 0.001) and accounted for 16.8% of the variance in the nurses' perception of hospital preparedness (R 2 = 0.221; adjusted R 2 = 0.168). The regression analysis was statistically significant (F 30,250 = 6.71, p = 0.001) and accounted for 38% of the variance in nurses' resilience (R 2 = 0.446, Adjusted R 2 = 0.380).

Quantifying the risk of coronavirus infection associated with workplace activities is an urgent need. METHODS: We assessed the association of worker characteristics, occupational roles and behaviors, and participation in procedures with the risk of endemic coronavirus infection among healthcare personnel who participated in the Respiratory Protection Effectiveness Trial (ResPECT), a cluster randomized trial to assess personal protective equipment to prevent respiratory infections and illness conducted from 2011 to 2016. RESULTS: Among 4,689 HCP-seasons, we detected coronavirus infection in 387 (8%). HCP who participated in an aerosol generation procedure (AGP) at least once during the viral respiratory season were 105% (95% CI 21%, 240%) more likely to be diagnosed with a laboratory-confirmed coronavirus infection. Younger individuals, those who saw pediatric patients and those with household members under the age of five were at increased risk of coronavirus infection. CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis suggests the risk of HCP becoming infected with an endemic coronavirus increases approximately two-fold with exposures to AGP.

Little is known about the challenges to advance care planning in this context, or the changes services made to adapt. AIM: Describe the challenges that UK specialist palliative care services experienced regarding advance care planning during COVID-19 and changes made to support timely conversations. DESIGN: Online survey of UK palliative/hospice services' response to COVID-19. Closed-ended responses are reported descriptively. Open-ended responses were analysed using a thematic Framework approach using the Social Ecological Model to understand challenges. RESPONDENTS: Two hundred and seventy-seven services. RESULTS: More direct advance care planning was provided by 38% of services, and 59% provided more support to others. Some challenges to advance care planning pre-dated the pandemic, whilst others were specific to/exacerbated by COVID-19. Challenges are demonstrated through six themes: complex decision making in the face of a new infectious disease; maintaining a personalised approach; COVID-19-specific communication difficulties; workload and pressure; sharing information; and national context of fear and uncertainty. Two themes demonstrate changes made to support: adapting local processes and adapting local structures. CONCLUSIONS: Professionals and healthcare providers need to ensure advance care planning is individualised by tailoring it to the values, priorities, and ethnic/cultural/religious context of each person. Policymakers need to consider how high-quality advance care planning can be resourced as a part of standard healthcare ahead of future pandemic waves.

An appropriate virality metric should be able to disambiguate between a shallow, broadcast-like diffusion process and a deep, multi-generational branching process. Although several valuable works have been dedicated to this field, most of them fail to take the position of the diffusion source into consideration, which makes them fall into the trap of graph isomorphism and would result in imprecise estimation of cascade virality inevitably under certain circumstances. In this paper, we propose a root-aware approach to quantify the virality of cascades with proper consideration of the root node in a diffusion tree. With applications on synthetic and empirical cascades, we show the property and potential utility of the proposed virality measure. Based on preferential attachment mechanism, we further introduce a model to mimic the growth of cascades. The proposed model enables the interpolation between broadcast and viral spreading during the growth of cascades. Through numerical simulations, we show the effectiveness of the proposed model in characterizing the virality of growing cascades. Our work contributes to the scientific understanding of cascade virality and growth, and could offer practical implications in a range of policy domains including viral marketing, infectious disease and information diffusion.","Zhang, Yafei; Wang, Lin; Zhu, Jonathan J.

However, no prior studies examined temporal trends and differential effects of social vulnerability on COVID-19 incidence and death rates. Therefore, we examined temporal trends among counties with high and low social vulnerability to quantify disparities in trends over time. METHODS: We conducted a longitudinal analysis examining COVID-19 incidence and death rates from March 15 to December 31, 2020, for each US county using data from USAFacts. We classified counties using the Social Vulnerability Index (SVI), a percentile-based measure from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, with higher values indicating more vulnerability. Using a Bayesian hierarchical negative binomial model, we estimated daily risk ratios (RRs) comparing counties in the first (lower) and fourth (upper) SVI quartiles, adjusting for rurality, percentage in poor or fair health, percentage female, percentage of smokers, county average daily fine particulate matter (PM2.5), percentage of primary care physicians per 100,000 residents, daily temperature and precipitation, and proportion tested for COVID-19. RESULTS: At the outset of the pandemic, the most vulnerable counties had, on average, fewer cases per 100,000 than least vulnerable SVI quartile. However, on March 28, we observed a crossover effect in which the most vulnerable counties experienced higher COVID-19 incidence rates compared to the least vulnerable counties (RR = 1.05, 95% PI: 0.98, 1.12). Vulnerable counties had higher death rates starting on May 21 (RR = 1.08, 95% PI: 1.00,1.16). However, by October, this trend reversed and the most vulnerable counties had lower death rates compared to least vulnerable counties. CONCLUSIONS: The impact of COVID-19 is not static but can migrate from less vulnerable counties to more vulnerable counties and back again over time.","Neelon, Brian; Mutiso, Fedelis; Mueller, Noel T; Pearce, John L; Benjamin-Neelon, Sara E",PLoS One,105,16

COVID-19 has already resulted in > 1,600,000 deaths worldwide and the fear of a global economic collapse. SARS-CoV-2 is notorious for causing acute respiratory distress syndrome, however emerging literature suggests various dreaded cardiac manifestations associated with high mortality. The mechanism of myocardial damage in COVID-19 is unclear but thought to be multifactorial and mainly driven by the host's immune response (cytokine storm), hypoxemia and direct myocardial injury by the virus. Cardiac manifestations from COVID-19 include but are not limited to, acute myocardial injury, cardiac arrhythmias, congestive heart failure and acute coronary syndrome. Cardiac imaging is paramount to appropriately diagnose and manage the cardiac manifestations of COVID-19. Herein, we present cardiac imaging findings of COVID-19 patients with biomarker and imaging confirmed myocarditis to provide insight regarding the variable manifestations of COVID-19 myocarditis via Cardiac MRI (CMR) coupled with CMR-edema education along with recommendations on how to incorporate advanced CMR into the clinicians' COVID-19 armamentarium.","Panchal, Ankur; Kyvernitakis, Andreas; Mikolich, J Ronald; Biederman, Robert W W",Int. j. cardiovasc. imaging,105,1

Method: Virtual OTVs were piloted at two centers, and within one week expanded to 4 additional centers. Patients participating in vOTVs were surveyed about their satisfaction with vOTVs, quality of vOTVs, and confidence in their physician's ability to manage their care through vOTVs, as well as their support of, and preferences related to vOTVs. Participating physicians were also surveyed about their comfort and satisfaction with vOTVs. Medical Directors at non-participating centers within our network were surveyed regarding their reasoning for not using vOTVs. Results: In week 1, 72 of 81 patients between 2 pilot centers were seen using vOTVs. In week 2, 189 of 211 patients were seen using vOTVs at 6 centers. Patient satisfaction and confidence in their physician's ability to address their concerns through the vOTV was high at 4.75 on a 5-point scale. Patients were overall very supportive (4.67) and found the quality of the visits to be as good as, or better, than their prior in person weekly OTV (3.75). Physicians participating in the vOTVs felt very comfortable in their ability to manage patients though this platform (5.0), and on average did not report any difference in terms of efficiency of visits (3.0). Conclusions: Virtual OTVs were easy to implement and well received by patients and participating physicians. Our experience suggests that vOTVs can be implemented rapidly using available technology, and with a high degree of patient and physician satisfaction during this pandemic with similar efficiency to in person OTVs.","Roof, Kevin S; Butler, Jerome M; Thakkar, Vipul V; Doline, Robert M; Kuremsky, Jeffrey G; Konefal, John B; McCammon, Robert J",,105,26

However, most studies in this area have been based on laboratory experiments and retrospective surveys, rather than actual situations in which people are experiencing stress. Moreover, few studies have examined whether age moderates the benefits of gratitude. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused enormous psychological distress worldwide. Evidence-based strategies are needed to enhance well-being during this stressful time. This study attempted to fill these gaps by examining the benefits of feeling gratitude every day during the COVID-19 outbreak. METHOD: A sample of 231 participants from mainland China aged 18 to 85 years participated in a 14-day daily diary study. After a pretest to collect demographic data, information on gratitude, daily positive and negative affect, perceived stress related to COVID-19, and subjective health were measured using daily questionnaires on 14 consecutive days. One month after the daily diary period, information on affective experiences, life satisfaction, and subjective health was collected as a follow-up survey. RESULTS: On days when individuals feel more gratitude than usual, they report more positive affect, a lower level of perceived stress related to COVID-19, and better subjective health on the concurrent day (Day N). Individuals also report a lower level of stress related to COVID-19 on the following day (Day N+1), when they feel more gratitude than usual on Day N. Higher levels of gratitude across the 14-day study period was associated with a higher level of positive affect and a lower level of negative affect, but was not associated with life satisfaction or subjective health at the one-month follow-up assessment. DISCUSSION: These findings demonstrate the benefits of gratitude in a naturalistic situation that induced stress and anxiety.","Jiang, Da",,105,10

In the past 50 years, attention was almost exclusively given to low dimensional systems and calibration of their resilience functions and indicators of early warning signals without considerations for the interactions between the components. Only in recent years, taking advantages of the network theory and lavish real data sets, network scientists have directed their interest to the real-world complex networked multidimensional systems and their resilience function and early warning indicators. This report is devoted to a comprehensive review of resilience function and regime shift of complex systems in different domains, such as ecology, biology, social systems and infrastructure.

There is a diverse range of SARS-CoV-2 detection rates in reported studies, with uncertainty as to the optimal sampling strategy for COVID-19 diagnosis and monitoring. METHODS: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies comparing respiratory sampling strategies for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. The inclusion criteria were studies that assessed at least two respiratory sampling sites (oropharyngeal swab, nasopharyngeal swab, and sputum) in participants with COVID-19. The percentage positive tests were compared between sampling modalities by constructing a Z-test assuming independence and using the standard errors obtained from the random effects meta-analysis. FINDINGS: From 1039 total studies, we identified 11 studies that met our inclusion criteria, with SARS-CoV-2 testing results from a total of 3442 respiratory tract specimens. Compared to nasopharyngeal swab sampling, sputum testing resulted in significantly higher rates of SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection while oropharyngeal swab testing had lower rates of viral RNA detection. Earlier sampling after symptom onset was associated with improved detection rates, but the differences in SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection by sampling method was consistent regardless of the duration of symptoms. INTERPRETATION: The results support sputum sampling as a valuable method of COVID-19 diagnosis and monitoring, and highlight the importance of early testing after symptom onset to increase the rates of COVID-19 diagnosis. FUNDING: This study was funded in part by the NIH grants U01AI106701 and by the Harvard University for AIDS Research (NIAID 5P30AI060354).","Mohammadi, Abbas; Esmaeilzadeh, Elmira; Li, Yijia; Bosch, Ronald J; Li, Jonathan Z",EBioMedicine,105,3

The nonpharmaceutical policies imposed as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic may also have adverse effects on fatigue. OBJECTIVE: This study has two aims: to examine the changes in sedentary behaviors and physical activity of company workers in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan and to examine relationships between changes in these sedentary behaviors and physical activity and changes in fatigue. METHODS: Data from a nationwide prospective online survey conducted in 2019 and 2020 were used. On February 22, 2019, an email with a link to participate in the study was sent to 45,659 workers, aged 20 to 59 years, who were randomly selected from a database of approximately 1 million individuals. A total of 2466 and 1318 participants, who self-reported their occupation as company workers, answered the baseline and follow-up surveys, respectively. Surveys captured fatigue, workday and daily domain-specific sedentary behaviors and physical activity, and total sedentary behaviors and physical activity. We used multivariable linear regression models to estimate associations of changes in sedentary behaviors and physical activity with changes in fatigue. RESULTS: Increases in public transportation sitting during workdays, other leisure sitting time during workdays, and other leisure sitting time were associated with an increase in the motivation aspect of fatigue (b=0.29, 95% CI 0-0.57, P=.048; b=0.40, 95% CI 0.18-0.62, P<.001; and b=0.26, 95% CI 0.07-0.45, P=.007, respectively). Increases in work-related sitting time during workdays, total sitting time during workdays, and total work-related sitting time were significantly associated with an increase in the physical activity aspect of fatigue (b=0.06, 95% CI 0-0.12, P=.03; b=0.05, 95% CI 0.01-0.09, P=.02; and b=0.07, 95% CI 0-0.14, P=.04, respectively). The motivation and physical activity aspects of fatigue increased by 0.06 for each 1-hour increase in total sitting time between baseline and follow-up (b=0.06, 95% CI 0-0.11, P=.045; and b=0.06, 95% CI 0.01-0.10, P=.009, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrated that sedentary and active behaviors among company workers in Japan were negatively affected during the COVID-19 outbreak. Increases in several domain-specific sedentary behaviors also contributed to unfavorable changes in workers' fatigue. Social distancing and teleworking amid a pandemic may contribute to the sedentary lifestyle of company workers. Public health interventions are needed to mitigate the negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic or future pandemics on sedentary and physical activity behaviors and fatigue among company workers.","Koohsari, Mohammad Javad; Nakaya, Tomoki; McCormack, Gavin R; Shibata, Ai; Ishii, Kaori; Oka, Koichiro",JMIR Public Health Surveill,105,26

The efforts for time-series narration hitherto are domain-specific and use predefined templates that offer consistency but lead to mechanical narratives. We present TCube (Time-series-to-text), a domain-agnostic neural framework for time-series narration, that couples the representation of essential time-series elements in the form of a dense knowledge graph and the translation of said knowledge graph into rich and fluent narratives through the transfer-learning capabilities of PLMs (Pre-trained Language Models). TCube's design primarily addresses the challenge that lies in building a neural framework in the complete paucity of annotated training data for time-series. The design incorporates knowledge graphs as an intermediary for the representation of essential time-series elements which can be linearized for textual translation. To the best of our knowledge, TCube is the first investigation of the use of neural strategies for time-series narration. Through extensive evaluations, we show that TCube can improve the lexical diversity of the generated narratives by up to 65.38% while still maintaining grammatical integrity. The practicality and deployability of TCube is further validated through an expert review (n=21) where 76.2% of participating experts wary of auto-generated narratives favored TCube as a deployable system for time-series narration due to its richer narratives.

This stemmed initially from the discovery that antigen presenting cells such as macrophages could actively metabolise precursor 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25D) to active 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25D). Parallel observation that activated cells from the immune system expressed the intracellular vitamin D receptor (VDR) for 1,25D suggested a potential role for vitamin D as a localised endogenous modulator of immune function. Subsequent studies have expanded our understanding of how vitamin D exerts effects on both the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system. At an innate level, intracrine synthesis of 1,25D by macrophages and dendritic cells (DC) stimulates expression of antimicrobial proteins such as cathelicidin, as well as lowering intracellular iron concentrations via suppression of hepcidin. By potently enhancing autophagy, 1,25D may also play an important role in combatting intracellular pathogens such as M. tuberculosis and viral infections. Local synthesis of 1,25D by macrophages and DC also appears to play a pivotal role in mediating T cell responses to vitamin D, leading to suppression of inflammatory T helper (Th)1 and Th17 cells, and concomitant induction of immunotolerogenic T regulatory (Treg) responses. The aim of this review is to provide an update on our current understanding of these prominent immune actions of vitamin D, as well as highlighting new, less well-recognised immune effects of vitamin D. The review also aims to place this mechanistic basis for the link between vitamin D and immunity with studies in vivo that have explored a role for vitamin D supplementation as a strategy for improved immune health. This has gained prominence in recent months with the global COVID-19 health crisis and highlights important new objectives for future studies of vitamin D and immune function.

Lung transplantation (LT) as the sole therapy for end-stage pulmonary fibrosis related to acute respiratory distress syndrome has been considered as the ultimate rescue therapy for these patients. METHODS: From February 10 to March 10, 2020, three male patients were urgently assessed and listed for transplantation. After conducting a full ethical review and after obtaining assent from the family of the patients, we performed three LT procedures for COVID-19 patients with illness durations of more than one month and extremely high sequential organ failure assessment scores. RESULTS: Two of the three recipients survived post-LT and started participating in a rehabilitation program. Pearls of the LT team collaboration and perioperative logistics were summarized and continually improved. The pathological results of the explanted lungs were concordant with the critical clinical manifestation, and provided insight towards better understanding of the disease. Government health affair systems, virology detection tools, and modern communication technology all play key roles towards the survival of the patients and their rehabilitation. CONCLUSIONS: LT can be performed in end-stage patients with respiratory failure due to COVID-19-related pulmonary fibrosis. If confirmed positive-turned-negative virology status without organ dysfunction that could contraindicate LT, LT provided the final option for these patients to avoid certain death, with proper protection of transplant surgeons and medical staffs. By ensuring instant seamless care for both patients and medical teams, the goal of reducing the mortality rate and salvaging the lives of patients with COVID-19 can be attained.","Chen, Jing-Yu; Qiao, Kun; Liu, Feng; Wu, Bo; Xu, Xin; Jiao, Guo-Qing; Lu, Rong-Guo; Li, Hui-Xing; Zhao, Jin; Huang, Jian; Yang, Yi; Lu, Xiao-Jie; Li, Jia-Shu; Jiang, Shu-Yun; Wang, Da-Peng; Hu, Chun-Xiao; Wang, Gui-Long; Huang, Dong-Xiao; Jiao, Guo-Hui; Wei, Dong; Ye, Shu-Gao; Huang, Jian-An; Zhou, Li; Zhang, Xiao-Qin; He, Jian-Xing",Chin Med J (Engl),105,0

Two specific modifiable components included in the Israeli program from which the US can learn are (a) a national (not individual state-based) strategy for vaccine distribution and administration and (b) a functioning public health infrastructure. As a federal government, the US maintains an often complex web of state and national authorities and responsibilities. The federal government assumed responsibility for the ordering, payment and procurement of COVID vaccine from manufacturers. In designing the subsequent steps in their COVID-19 vaccine distribution and administration plan, the Trump administration decided to rely on the states themselves to determine how best to implement guidance provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). This strategy resulted in 50 different plans and 50 different systems for the dissemination of vaccine doses, all at the level of each individual state. State health departments were neither financed, experienced nor uniformly possessed the expertise to develop and implement such plans. A national strategy for the distribution, and the workforce for the provision, of vaccine beyond the state level, similar to that which occurred in Israel, would have provided for greater efficiency and coordination across the country. The US public health infrastructure was ill-prepared and ill-staffed to take on the responsibility to deliver > 450 million doses of vaccine in an expeditious fashion, even if supply of vaccine was available. The failure to adequately invest in public health has been ubiquitous across the nation at all levels of government. Since the 2008 recession, state and local health departments have lost > 38,000 jobs and spending for state public health departments has dropped by 16% per capita and spending for local health departments has fallen by 18%. Hopefully, COVID-19 will be a wakeup call to the US with regard to the need for both a national strategy to address public health emergencies and the well-maintained infrastructure to make it happen.","Freed, Gary L",Isr J Health Policy Res,105,30

However, there is paucity of data regarding the association between the severity of COVID-19 and HTN phenotypes and HTN mediated organ damage (HMOD). Design and method: In a cohort of patients (n=501, mean age 53.5±14.6) attending a specialist hypertension clinic at King Abdulaziz Cardiac Center, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, we identified patients diagnosed with COVID-19 between January and November, 2020. We compared HTN phenotypes and HMOD in patients admitted with severe COVID-19 infection to those with mild disease and without disease. Data were analysed using JMP version 13 Pro(SAS for Windows). Results: Twenty-seven patients developed COVID-19 (5.38%), 8 of whom were admitted (29.6%), with one fatality (3.8%). Patients admitted with COVID-19 were more likely to have refractory HTN (43% vs. 15% vs. 8.9%, p&lt;0.01), body mass index &gt;30 (85.7% vs. 46% vs. 47%, p&lt;0.05), left ventricular hypertrophy (28.6% vs. 7.7% vs. 6.5%, p&lt;0.01), high hs-CRP (7.8±1.1 vs. 2.1±2 vs. 5±1.5, p&lt;0.01) and greater central systolic pressure (132±5 vs. 122±7 vs. 110±13, p&lt;0.01) with no difference in age and gender. Conclusions: In hypertensive patients, severe COVID-19 is associated with severe uncontrolled hypertension with HMOD and stiff arteries. While this is a small single center study, it does highlight aspects of COVID-19 in hypertensive patients which warrant further investigation.","Mahmud, A.; Alhabdan, N. A.; Alkhdiri, M.

When there are many targets, it is not easy to efficiently map these coordinates to locations. Therefore, we propose a GNSS-based crowd-sensing strategy for specific geographical areas that can be used to calculate how many targets are in specific geographical areas or whether a target is in a specific area. This strategy is based on the coordinates of latitude and longitude provided by GNSS to find the locations of these coordinates. As simulated data, the data records containing latitude and longitude in a well-known social networking service platform are used.

However, in the United States race and temperature correlate with various other social determinants of health, comorbidities, and environmental influences that could be responsible for noted effects. This study investigates the independent effects of race and environmental temperature on COVID-19 incidence and mortality in United States counties. METHODS: Data on COVID-19 and risk factors in all United States counties was collected. 661 counties with at least 50 COVID-19 cases and 217 with at least 10 deaths were included in analyses. Upper and lower quartiles for cases/100,000 people and halves for deaths/100,000 people were compared with t-tests. Adjusted linear and logistic regression analyses were performed to evaluate the independent effects of race and environmental temperature. RESULTS: Multivariate regression analyses demonstrated Black race is a risk factor for increased COVID-19 cases (OR=1.22, 95% CI: 1.09-1.40, P=0.001) and deaths independent of comorbidities, poverty, access to health care, and other risk factors. Higher environmental temperature independently reduced caseload (OR=0.81, 95% CI: 0.71-0.91, P=0.0009), but not deaths. CONCLUSIONS: Higher environmental temperatures correlated with reduced COVID-19 cases, but this benefit does not yet appear in mortality models. Black race was an independent risk factor for increased COVID-19 cases and deaths. Thus, many proposed mechanisms through which Black race might increase risk for COVID-19, such as socioeconomic and healthcare-related predispositions, are inadequate in explaining the full magnitude of this health disparity.","Li, Adam Y; Hannah, Theodore C; Durbin, John R; Dreher, Nickolas; McAuley, Fiona M; Marayati, Naoum Fares; Spiera, Zachary; Ali, Muhammad; Gometz, Alex; Kostman, J T; Choudhri, Tanvir F",Am. j. med. sci,105,3

PURPOSE: To review multiple streams of evidence regarding the benefits and harms of ventilation techniques for coronavirus infections, including that causing COVID-19. DATA SOURCES: 21 standard, World Health Organization-specific and COVID-19-specific databases, without language restrictions, until 1 May 2020. STUDY SELECTION: Studies of any design and language comparing different oxygenation approaches in patients with coronavirus infections, including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), or with hypoxemic respiratory failure. Animal, mechanistic, laboratory, and preclinical evidence was gathered regarding aerosol dispersion of coronavirus. Studies evaluating risk for virus transmission to health care workers from aerosol-generating procedures (AGPs) were included. DATA EXTRACTION: Independent and duplicate screening, data abstraction, and risk-of-bias assessment (GRADE for certainty of evidence and AMSTAR 2 for included systematic reviews). DATA SYNTHESIS: 123 studies were eligible (45 on COVID-19, 70 on SARS, 8 on MERS), but only 5 studies (1 on COVID-19, 3 on SARS, 1 on MERS) adjusted for important confounders. A study in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 reported slightly higher mortality with noninvasive ventilation (NIV) than with invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), but 2 opposing studies, 1 in patients with MERS and 1 in patients with SARS, suggest a reduction in mortality with NIV (very-low-certainty evidence). Two studies in patients with SARS report a reduction in mortality with NIV compared with no mechanical ventilation (low-certainty evidence). Two systematic reviews suggest a large reduction in mortality with NIV compared with conventional oxygen therapy. Other included studies suggest increased odds of transmission from AGPs. LIMITATION: Direct studies in COVID-19 are limited and poorly reported.

Organizations, therefore, invest in approaches to improve the likelihood of positive patient responses. Evidence suggests that nurse communication as measured by HCAHPS influences overall patient satisfaction, yet little is known regarding what patients believe constitutes effective communication with nurses. In this qualitative descriptive study, we conducted phone interviews with 49 recently hospitalized patients to better understand patients' perceptions of their communication with nurses. Our findings indicate that patients perceived their communication with nurses to unfold via nurses' behaviors. Namely, nurses' engagement with patients, anticipation of patients' needs, responsiveness to patients' concerns, and teaching practices positively influence patient satisfaction with communication with nurses. These behaviors resonated most strongly with patients during particularly memorable moments of uncertainty and vulnerability over the course of a hospital stay. These findings suggest that focusing on the development of nurses' behaviors, ensuring processes are in place to support positive behaviors and creating organizational environments that position nurses to consistently apply these behaviors, can improve patients' perceptions of their communication with nurses. These findings also provide a foundation for further research focused on developing and testing specific behavioral interventions and their effect on communication perception.","Trotta, Rebecca L; Rao, Aditi D; McHugh, Matthew D; Yoho, Margaret; Cunningham, Regina S",Res Nurs Health,105,1

This study aimed to investigate the role of COVID-19 associated coagulopathy (CAC) to preview and triage. METHODS AND RESULTS: A cohort study was designed from government designated COVID-19 treatment center. CAC was defined as International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) score &#8805;2. Data from 117 patients COVID-19 were reviewed on admission. The primary and secondary outcomes were admission to Intensive Care Unit (ICU), the use of mechanical ventilation, vital organ dysfunction, discharges of days 14, 21 and 28 from admission and hospital mortality. Among them, admission to ICU was increased progressively from 16.1% in patients with non-CAC to 42.6% in patients with CAC (P < 0.01). Likely, invasive ventilation and noninvasive ventilation were increased from 1.8%, 21.4% in patients with non-CAC to 21.3%, 52.5% in patients with CAC, respectively (P < 0.01). The incidences of acute hepatic injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome in non-CAC and CAC were 28.6% vs. 62.3%, 8.9% vs. 27.9%, respectively (P < 0.01). The discharges of days 14, 21 and 28 from admission were more in non-CAC than those of CAC (P < 0.05). Multiple logistic regression results showed that ISTH score &#8805;2 was obviously associated with the admission to ICU (OR 4.07, 95% CI 1.47-11.25 P = 0.007) and the use of mechanical ventilation (OR 5.54, 95% CI 2.01-15.28 P = 0.001) in patients with COVID-19. CONCLUSION: All results show ISTH score &#8805;2 is an important indicator to preview and triage for COVID-19 patients.","Luan, Ying-Yi; Liu, Yan; Liu, Xue-Yan; Yu, Bao-Jun; Chen, Rong-Ling; Peng, Mian; Ren, Di; Li, Hao-Li; Huang, Lei; Liu, Yong; Li, Jin-Xiu; Feng, Yong-Wen; Wu, Ming",Thromb Res,105,33

To curb COVID-19 transmission, mitigation measures such as travel restrictions, border closures, curfews, lockdowns, and social distancing have been implemented. However, these measures may directly and indirectly affect the delivery and utilization of essential health services, including malaria services. The suspension of indoor residual spraying (IRS) and insecticide-treated net (ITN) distribution, shortages of malaria commodities, and reduced demand for health services have hindered the continued delivery of malaria services. The overall goal of this analysis was to describe the trends in malaria incidence and mortality in Zimbabwe prior to and during the pandemic to understand the consequences of COVID-19-related changes in the delivery and utilization of malaria services. METHODS: Monthly data on the number of malaria cases and deaths by district for the period January 2017 to June 2020 were obtained from the national health management information system (HMIS). District-level population data were obtained from the 2012 Census. Malaria incidence per 1000 population and malaria deaths per 100,000 population were calculated for 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2020 and mapped to describe the spatial and temporal variation of malaria at the district level. RESULTS: Compared to the same period in 2017, 2018 and 2019, there was an excess of over 30,000 malaria cases from January to June 2020. The number of malaria deaths recorded in January to June 2020 exceeded the annual totals for 2018 and 2019. District level maps indicated that areas outside high malaria burden provinces experienced higher than expected malaria incidence and mortality, suggesting potential outbreaks. CONCLUSIONS: The observed surge in malaria cases and deaths in January to June 2020 coincided with the onset of COVID-19 in Zimbabwe. While further research is needed to explore possible explanations for the observed trends, prioritizing the continuity of essential malaria services amid the COVID-19 pandemic remains crucial.","Gavi, Samuel; Tapera, Oscar; Mberikunashe, Joseph; Kanyangarara, Mufaro",Malar J,105,32

System A is hybridized with an auxiliary biomass boiler that complements the solar system’s thermal production, providing a constant heat supply to the ORC, which operates at full load during the operating hours of the solar system. In contrast, system B is not hybridized with biomass, so the ORC is fully driven by the solar system, operating at partial load according to the solar resource availability. Both systems are connected to the electrical grid, allowing electricity purchases and sales when needed. The design procedure involves the sizing of the equipment as well as the modelling of the hourly behavior of each system throughout the year. The physical analysis is complemented by an economic assessment, which considers investment and variable costs, as well as an estimate of the significant environmental benefits of the proposed plants. The solar plants are compared to a conventional system in which all the electrical consumption is covered with electricity purchased from the grid. The costs of the electricity produced by systems A and B are estimated at 0.2030 EUR/kWh and 0.1458 EUR/kWh, which are about 49% and 7% higher than the electricity purchase price in Spain (0.1363 EUR/kWh). These results indicate that while none of the solar plants are presently competitive with the conventional system, system B (without biomass hybridization) is actually closer to economic feasibility in the short and medium term than system A (with biomass hybridization).","Pina, Eduardo A.; Lozano, Miguel A.; Hernández, Adrián Lázaro Ana",Energies,105,21

However, there is a paucity of RJMS techniques that can solve key technical challenges associated with those new requirements, particularly when they are coupled. In this paper, we propose a novel dynamic and multi-level resource model approach to address three key well-known challenges individually and in combination: i.e., 1) RJMS dynamism to facilitate job and workflow adaptability, 2) integration of specialized external resources (e.g. user-centric cloud bursting), and 3) scheduling cloud orchestration framework tasks. The core idea is to combine a dynamic directed graph resource model with fully hierarchical scheduling to provide a unified solution to all three key challenges. Our empirical and analytical evaluations of the solution using our prototype extension to Fluxion, a production hierarchical graph-based scheduler, suggest that our unified solution can significantly improve flexibility, performance and scalability across all three problems in comparison to limited traditional approaches.","Milroy, Daniel J.; Misale, Claudia; Herbein, Stephen; Ahn, Dong H.",,105,24

Mounting evidence shows that the characteristics of the age-related clinical severity of COVID-19 are attributed to insufficient antiviral immune function and excessive self-damaging immune reaction, involving T cell immunity and associated with pre-existing basal inflammation in the elderly. Age-related changes to T cell immunosenescence is characterized by not only restricted T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire diversity, accumulation of exhausted and/or senescent memory T cells, but also by increased self-reactive T cell- and innate immune cell-induced chronic inflammation, and accumulated and functionally enhanced polyclonal regulatory T (Treg) cells. Many of these changes can be traced back to age-related thymic involution/degeneration. How these changes contribute to differences in COVID-19 disease severity between young and aged patients is an urgent area of investigation. Therefore, we attempt to connect various clues in this field by reviewing and discussing recent research on the role of the thymus and T cells in COVID-19 immunity during aging (a synergistic effect of diminished responses to pathogens and enhanced responses to self) impacting age-related clinical severity of COVID-19. We also address potential combinational strategies to rejuvenate multiple aging-impacted immune system checkpoints by revival of aged thymic function, boosting peripheral T cell responses, and alleviating chronic, basal inflammation to improve the efficiency of anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunity and vaccination in the elderly.","Wang, Weikan; Thomas, Rachel; Oh, Jiyoung; Su, Dong-Ming",,105,21

A plethora of contact tracing apps have been developed and deployed in several countries around the world. However, people are rightfully concerned about the security and privacy risks of such applications. To this end, the contribution of this work is twofold. First, we present an in-depth analysis of the security and privacy characteristics of the most prominent contact tracing protocols, under both passive and active adversaries. The results of our study indicate that all protocols are vulnerable to a variety of attacks, mainly due to the deterministic nature of the underlying cryptographic protocols. Our second contribution is the design of SpreadMeNot, a novel contact tracing protocol that can defend against most passive and active attacks, thus providing strong (provable) security and privacy guarantees that are necessary for such a sensitive application. Moreover, we experimentally demonstrate that SpreadMeNot---while being built on asymmetric crypto primitives---sports little overhead. Our detailed analysis, both formal and experimental, shows that SpreadMeNot satisfies security, privacy, and performance requirements, hence being an ideal candidate for building a contact tracing solution that can be adopted by the majority of the general public, as well as to serve as an open source reference for further developments in the field.","Tedeschi, Pietro; Bakiras, Spiridon; Pietro, Roberto Di",,105,1

SARS-CoV-2 cannot infect mice due to incompatibility between its receptor binding domain and the murine ACE2 receptor. Through molecular modeling and empirical in vitro validation, we identified 5 key amino acid differences between murine and human ACE2 that mediate SARS-CoV-2 infection, generating a chimeric humanized murine ACE2. Additionally, we examined the ability of the humanized murine ACE2 receptor to permit infection by an additional preemergent group 2B coronavirus, WIV-1, providing evidence for the potential pan-virus capabilities of this chimeric receptor. Finally, we predicted the ability of these determinants to inform host range identification of preemergent coronaviruses by evaluating hot spot contacts between SARS-CoV-2 and additional potential host receptors. Our results identify residue determinants that mediate coronavirus receptor usage and host range for application in SARS-CoV-2 and emerging coronavirus animal model development.IMPORTANCE SARS-CoV-2 (the causative agent of COVID-19) is a major public health threat and one of two related coronaviruses that have caused epidemics in modern history. A method of screening potential infectible hosts for preemergent and future emergent coronaviruses would aid in mounting rapid response and intervention strategies during future emergence events. Here, we evaluated determinants of SARS-CoV-2 receptor interactions, identifying key changes that enable or prevent infection. The analysis detailed in this study will aid in the development of model systems to screen emergent coronaviruses as well as treatments to counteract infections.","Adams, Lily E; Dinnon, Kenneth H; Hou, Yixuan J; Sheahan, Timothy P; Heise, Mark T; Baric, Ralph S",mBio (Online),105,24

The impacts include changes in the quantity of waste, composition, timing/frequency (temporal), distribution (spatial), and risk, which affect handling practices and care. So, the global dynamics of waste generation have changed, and special attention has therefore been required. The unexpected variations in the composition and amount of waste often need policymakers to react dynamically. This study underlines the challenges faced by the solid waste management sector during the pandemic and the prospects underlying the framework to resolve current lacunae.

It is pandemic and has affected more than 21 million people and resulted in more than 750,000 deaths worldwide (https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/#countries; 14/08/20). Our research group initiated a study to ascertain the knowledge, attitude and practices (KAP) of Jordanians toward COVID-19 prior to any initial case report in Jordan. This project was underway when the first Jordanian case was reported. We extended our study to identify how case reporting would alter public KAP towards COVID-19. This cross-sectional study randomly selected and recruited 2104 Jordanian adults. A four-section questionnaire was devised to address the sociodemographic characteristics of the subjects and their KAP toward COVID-19. The mean knowledge score for the study population was 15.9 ± 2.2 (out of the 20 knowledge questions), with 60.9% of the participants having good knowledge about COVID-19. Participants' practices to prevent transmission of COVID-19 were adequate in more than 60% of participants. Most participants had positive attitudes regarding their role in preventing COVID-19 and many of the participants' attitudes and practices changed to more appropriate ones after reporting the first case of COVID-19 in Jordan. The percentage of participants who trust the government in confronting COVID-19 increased significantly (p value < 0.001). However, one alarming and unexpected finding was that the prevention practice score of participants working in the medical field was similar to those from the general population. This may necessitate stricter training and guidelines for this group who will be in the frontline in combating the disease. Impact of this study: The data generated from this study shows that when cases of disease were reported, the public's attitudes and practices improved in many aspects, and that confidence in the government to contain the disease was boosted. We believe that this study is important in allowing other, international governments to develop an understanding of public KAP during pandemic disease outbreaks.","Elayeh, Eman; Aleidi, Shereen M; Ya039,; acoub, Rawan; Haddadin, Randa N",PLoS One,105,10

The present study is an attempt at investigating the psychological challenges and issues which the families of COVID-19 victims are faced with. The present study aims to identify the Mental Health crises which the families of COVID-19 deceased victims are going through. METHODS: A qualitative research, the present study uses a conventional content analysis design. The participants were 16 members of the families of COVID-19 victims selected from medical centers in Iran from February to May 2020 via purposeful sampling. Sampling continued to the point of data saturation Data were collected via semi-structured individual interviews conducted online. The collected data were analyzed according to the conventional qualitative content analysis approach. RESULTS: Analyses of the data yielded two main themes and seven categories. Emotional shock included (feelings of guilt and rumination, bitter farewell, strange burial and concern about unreligious burial), and fear of the future included (instability in the family, lack of job security and difficult financial conditions, Stigmatization and complications in social interactions). CONCLUSION: The families of COVID-19 deceased victims are affected by various psychological crises which have exposed them to a deep sense of loss and emotional shock. Therefore, there is an urgent need for a cultural context which recognizes and supports all the various aspects of the mental health of these families.","Mohammadi, Fateme; Oshvandi, Khodayar; Shamsaei, Farshid; Cheraghi, Fateme; Khodaveisi, Masoud; Bijani, Mostafa",BMC Fam Pract,105,5

All measures, especially in the first wave of the pandemic, were in combination with recommendations provided by professional and scientific organizations. Similar measures were applied to specific procedures, such as the management of infertility, including in vitro fertilization-embryo transfer (IVF-ET) treatments. Although there is no clear scientific evidence yet that the SARS-CoV-2 may exert negative effects on IVF outcome, especially at the early stages, several clinical reports indicate that the virus may impact male fertility through specific receptors presented at the somatic cells of the testis and used by the virus in order to gain entry to the respective cells. Nevertheless, it is not unreasonable to suspect that the virus may affect sperm function as well as oocyte performance directly through specific receptors or indirectly through other signaling pathways. Despite the good practice of IVF laboratory techniques, culture media may also be contaminated during equilibration when airborne virus's particles can contaminate culture media from an already infected embryology area or staff. Furthermore, although there is no clinical evidence, liquid nitrogen could be a route of infection for gametes and embryos when it has been contaminated during production or transportation. Therefore, cryopreservation of gametes and embryos must be virus-free. This communication aims to provide some aspects of the possible impact of the virus on gametes and embryos and how it may affect the cryopreservation procedures.Abbreviations: ACE2: angiotensin- converting enzyme 2; ART: assisted reproductive technology; ASRM: American Society for Reproductive Medicine; CDC: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; COVID-19: coronavirus disease 2019; ESHRE: European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology; ET: embryo transfer; FSH: follicle stimulating hormone; IFFS: International Federation of Fertility Societies; IVF: in vitro fertilization; LH: luteinizing hormone; LN: liquid nitrogen; SARS-CoV-2: severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; T: testosterone; WHO: World Health Organization.","Anifandis, George; Messini, Christina I; Simopoulou, Mara; Sveronis, George; Garas, Antonios; Daponte, Alexandros; Messinis, Ioannis E",Syst Biol Reprod Med,105,20

The recommendations cover musculoskeletal conditions (e.g., do not recommend platelet-rich plasma injections for rotator cuff disease or knee osteoarthritis), respiratory disease (e.g., in clinically stable patients with community-acquired pneumonia, antibiotics can be stopped after five days), screening or preventive care (e.g., patients who take their blood pressure at home or in a pharmacy should know what to do when they have an elevated reading), and miscellaneous topics (e.g., in healthy adults treated for dermatophyte infection, do not obtain baseline or follow-up alanine transaminase level, aspartate transaminase level, or complete blood count).

Methods: We analyzed retrospective data regarding general characteristics, epidemiologic history, underlying chronic diseases, clinical symptoms and complications, chest computed tomography findings, biochemical monitoring, disease severity, treatments, and outcomes among 37 adult patients with COVID-19. According to the duration from symptom onset to release from quarantine, the patients were divided into the ≤20 and &gt;20-day groups, and the similarities and differences between them were compared. Results: Among the 37 patients, five had mild disease, 30 had moderate disease, one had severe disease, and one was critically ill.

On admission, 86.5% of patients showed pneumonia in chest CT scans, including some asymptomatic patients, while 68.8% of patients showed bilateral infiltration. In the &gt;20-day group, the average age was 49.9 ± 1.38 years, and the average duration from symptom onset to hospitalization was 5.5 ± 3.9 days. Compared with the ≤20-day group, patients in the &gt;20-day group were older and the duration was longer (P &lt; 0.05). All of the seven asymptomatic patients belonged to the ≤20-day group. When the 37 patients were released from quarantine, the white blood cell count of 16.2% of the patients was &lt;4.0 × 109/L, the lymphocyte count of 59.5% of the patients was &lt;1.1 × 109/L, and the absolute counts of white blood cells and lymphocytes were 5.02 ± 1.34 × 109/L and 1.03 ± 0.34 × 109/L, respectively, compared with those recorded on admission (P &gt; 0.05). Conclusion: The majority of COVID-19 cases in the study area were mild and moderate, with good clinical outcomes. There were some special characteristics in the clinical course. The reasons for differences in the duration from symptom onset to release from quarantine were complex. There was no significant change in the number of granulocytes at the time of release from quarantine compared to that at the time of admission.","Tian, Suochen; Chang, Zhenqin; Wang, Yunxia; Wu, Min; Zhang, Wenming; Zhou, Guijie; Zou, Xiuli; Tian, Hui; Xiao, Tingfang; Xing, Junmin; Chen, Juan; Han, Jian; Ning, Kang; Wu, Tiejun",Front.

Non-local fractional operators are one of the most efficient tools in order to understand the dynamics of the disease spread. For this purpose, we intend as an attempt at investigating the fractional COVID-19 model through Caputo operator with order &#967; &#8712; ( 0 , 1 ) . Employing the fixed point theorem, it is shown that the solutions of the proposed fractional model are determined to satisfy the existence and uniqueness conditions under the Caputo derivative. On the other hand, its iterative solutions are indicated by making use of the Laplace transform of the Caputo fractional operator. Also, we establish the stability criteria for the fractional COVID-19 model via the fixed point theorem. The invariant region in which all solutions of the fractional model under investigation are positive is determined as the non-negative hyperoctant R + 7 . Moreover, we perform the parameter estimation of the COVID-19 model by utilizing the non-linear least squares curve fitting method. The sensitivity analysis of the basic reproduction number R 0 c is carried out to determine the effects of the proposed fractional model's parameters on the spread of the disease. Numerical simulations show that all results are in good agreement with real data and all theoretical calculations about the disease.","Inc, Mustafa; Acay, Bahar; Berhe, Hailay Weldegiorgis; Yusuf, Abdullahi; Khan, Amir; Yao, Shao-Wen",Results Phys,105,23

However, the existing models independently process the 3D lesion segmentation and disease classification, ignoring the inherent correlation between these two tasks. In this paper, we propose a joint deep learning model of 3D lesion segmentation and classification for diagnosing COVID-19, called DeepSC-COVID, as the first attempt in this direction. Specifically, we establish a large-scale CT database containing 1,805 3D CT scans with fine-grained lesion annotations, and reveal 4 findings about lesion difference between COVID-19 and community acquired pneumonia (CAP). Inspired by our findings, DeepSC-COVID is designed with 3 subnets: a cross-task feature subnet for feature extraction, a 3D lesion subnet for lesion segmentation, and a classification subnet for disease diagnosis. Besides, the task-aware loss is proposed for learning the task interaction across the 3D lesion and classification subnets. Different from all existing models for COVID-19 diagnosis, our model is interpretable with fine-grained 3D lesion distribution. Finally, extensive experimental results show that the joint learning framework in our model significantly improves the performance of 3D lesion segmentation and disease classification in both efficiency and efficacy.","Wang, Xiaofei; Jiang, Lai; Li, Liu; Xu, Mai; Deng, Xin; Dai, Lisong; Xu, Xiangyang; Li, Tianyi; Guo, Yichen; Wang, Zulin; Dragotti, Pier Luigi",IEEE. trans. med. imaging,105,20

During previous viral pandemics, reported co-infection rates and implicated pathogens have varied. In the 1918 influenza pandemic, a large proportion of severe illness and death was complicated by bacterial co-infection, predominantly Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus.Gap statement. A better understanding of the incidence of co-infection in patients with COVID-19 infection and the pathogens involved is necessary for effective antimicrobial stewardship.Aim. To describe the incidence and nature of co-infection in critically ill adults with COVID-19 infection in England.Methodology. A retrospective cohort study of adults with COVID-19 admitted to seven intensive care units (ICUs) in England up to 18 May 2020, was performed. Patients with completed ICU stays were included. The proportion and type of organisms were determined at <48 and >48 h following hospital admission, corresponding to community and hospital-acquired co-infections.Results. Of 254 patients studied (median age 59 years (IQR 49-69); 64.6â% male), 139 clinically significant organisms were identified from 83 (32.7â%) patients. Bacterial co-infections/ co-colonisation were identified within 48 h of admission in 14 (5.5â%) patients; the commonest pathogens were Staphylococcus aureus (four patients) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (two patients). The proportion of pathogens detected increased with duration of ICU stay, consisting largely of Gram-negative bacteria, particularly Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli. The co-infection/ co-colonisation rate >48 h after admission was 27/1000 person-days (95â% CI 21.3-34.1). Patients with co-infections/ co-colonisation were more likely to die in ICU (crude OR 1.78,95â% CI 1.03-3.08, P=0.04) compared to those without co-infections/ co-colonisation.Conclusion. We found limited evidence for community-acquired bacterial co-infection in hospitalised adults with COVID-19, but a high rate of Gram-negative infection acquired during ICU stay.","Baskaran, Vadsala; Lawrence, Hannah; Lansbury, Louise E; Webb, Karmel; Safavi, Shahideh; Zainuddin, Nurul I; Huq, Tausif; Eggleston, Charlotte; Ellis, Jayne; Thakker, Clare; Charles, Bethan; Boyd, Sara; Williams, Tom; Phillips, Claire; Redmore, Ethan; Platt, Sarah; Hamilton, Eve; Barr, Andrew; Venyo, Lucy; Wilson, Peter; Bewick, Tom; Daniel, Priya; Dark, Paul; Jeans, Adam R; McCanny, Jamie; Edgeworth, Jonathan D; Llewelyn, Martin J; Schmid, Matthias L; McKeever, Tricia M; Beed, Martin; Lim, Wei Shen",J. medical microbiol,105,9

Our 2.85-angstrom cryo-electron microscopy structure of SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein reveals that the receptor binding domains tightly bind the essential free fatty acid linoleic acid (LA) in three composite binding pockets. A similar pocket also appears to be present in the highly pathogenic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). LA binding stabilizes a locked S conformation, resulting in reduced angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) interaction in vitro. In human cells, LA supplementation synergizes with the COVID-19 drug remdesivir, suppressing SARS-CoV-2 replication. Our structure directly links LA and S, setting the stage for intervention strategies that target LA binding by SARS-CoV-2.","Toelzer, Christine; Gupta, Kapil; Yadav, Sathish K N; Borucu, Ufuk; Davidson, Andrew D; Kavanagh Williamson, Maia; Shoemark, Deborah K; Garzoni, Frederic; Staufer, Oskar; Milligan, Rachel; Capin, Julien; Mulholland, Adrian J; Spatz, Joachim; Fitzgerald, Daniel; Berger, Imre; Schaffitzel, Christiane",Science,105,25

METHODS: Using data from a nationally representative cross-sectional survey conducted in October 2020 among 855 adults (&#8805;18 years) in Greece, we estimated support rates for mandatory vaccination and respondents' intention to get vaccinated for COVID-19 as well as associations thereof with individual sociodemographic, clinical and contextual characteristics. RESULTS: About 74% of respondents supported mandatory vaccination and 62% intended to get vaccinated for COVID-19. The most prevalent reasons against COVID-19 vaccination were safety concerns related to the duration of clinical trials and potential side effects. Individuals who reported increased trust in healthcare authorities' recommendations, who revealed that their trust in the State increased due to the way the COVID-19 pandemic was handled, who used preventive services more often, and those with higher income were more likely to both support mandatory vaccination and to indicate intention to get vaccinated for COVID-19. Participants with worse or better self-reported health status (compared to average), younger adults, and females were less likely to intend to get vaccinated for COVID-19. CONCLUSION: The survey revealed that the majority of the Greek citizens favour mandatory vaccination overall and intend to get vaccinated for COVID-19, driven mostly by utilization of preventive services and trust in healthcare authorities. However, intention to get vaccinated for COVID-19 was lower relative to mandatory vaccination support. This suggests a need to intensify evidence-based yet simplified messaging by esteemed healthcare providers to inform the public on the risks and benefits of vaccines.","Giannouchos, Theodoros V; Steletou, Evaggelia; Saridi, Maria; Souliotis, Kyriakos",J Eval Clin Pract,105,21

We treat the problem by adopting a partial differential equation (PDE) version of the Susceptible, Infected, Recovered, Deceased (SIRD) compartmental model of epidemiology, which is achieved by replacing compartmental populations by their densities. Building on our recent work (Computational Mechanics, 66, 1177, 2020), we replace our earlier use of global polynomial basis functions with those having local support, as epitomized in the finite element method, for the spatial representation of the SIRD parameters. The time dependence is treated by inferring constant parameters over time intervals that coincide with the time step in semi-discrete numerical implementations. In combination, this amounts to a scheme of field inversion of the SIRD parameters over each time step. Applied to data over ten months of 2020 for the pandemic in the US state of Michigan and to all of Mexico, our system inference via field inversion infers spatio-temporally varying PDE SIRD parameters that replicate the progression of the pandemic with high accuracy. It also produces accurate predictions, when compared against data, for a three week period into 2021. Of note is the insight that is suggested on the spatio-temporal variation of infection, recovery and death rates, as well as patterns of the population's mobility revealed by diffusivities of the compartments.","Wang, Zhenlin; Teja, Mariana Carrasco; Zhang, Xiaoxuan; Teichert, Gregory; Garikipati, Krishna",,105,33

Specifically, our PFNet contains two key modules, i.e., the positioning module (PM) and the focus module (FM). The PM is designed to mimic the detection process in predation for positioning the potential target objects from a global perspective and the FM is then used to perform the identification process in predation for progressively refining the coarse prediction via focusing on the ambiguous regions.

Our aim was to examine the impact of the technique among factors influencing RT-PCR result, a far surrogate of 'viral load' in the heterogeneous environment of respiratory specimens.","Schnuriger, Aurélie; Perrier, Marine; Marinho, Valérie; Michel, Yanne; Saloum, Kenda; Boukli, Narjis; Lambert-Niclot, Sidonie; Amiel, Corinne; Fofana, Djeneba Bocar; Gozlan, Joël; Morand-Joubert, Laurence",Diagn Microbiol Infect Dis,105,1

In this study, we sought to explore the psychological distress and COVID-19-related anxiety of pregnant women during the crisis. METHODS: Israeli Jewish and Arab pregnant women (n = 336) aged 20-47 completed a set of questionnaires during the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020. RESULTS: The levels of all COVID-19-related anxieties were quite high (much or very much), with the highest regarding public places and transportation (87.5%, 70%, respectively), followed by concerns over the possible infection of other family members and the health of the foetus (71.7%, 70%, respectively), going for pregnancy check-ups (68.7%,), being infected themselves, and the delivery (59.2%, 55.4%, respectively). Although COVID-19-related anxieties were shared by pregnant women characterised by diverse sociodemographic variables, with very small nuances, Arab women were more anxious about each of the issues than Jewish women. DISCUSSION: Our findings highlight the importance of assessing anxiety and distress in pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the need to be attentive to the double stress of pregnant women in times of crisis and to the potential vulnerability of subgroups, such as cultural minorities.","Taubman-Ben-Ari, Orit; Chasson, Miriam; Abu Sharkia, Salam; Weiss, Efrat",J Reprod Infant Psychol,105,24

This trial will evaluate a brief, evidence-based, online, group-based expressive writing intervention to reduce COVID-19-related distress in people living with IBD at the time of pandemic. METHODS: A parallel double-blind randomised controlled trial will be conducted. Overall, up to 154 adult participants with IBD and mild-moderate distress will be recruited via patient organisations. Participants will be allocated to the expressive writing intervention or an active control group. All participants will complete questionnaires including measures of distress, quality of life, resilience, self-efficacy, social support and disease activity before and after the intervention (1 week) and at 3 months post-intervention. The expressive writing group will participate in the evidenced-based 4-day writing program adapted from Pennebaker and Beall, 1986. The active control group will write about untherapeutic topics provided by researchers. Statistical analysis will be carried out on an intention-to-treat basis and will involve linear mixed effects models. CONCLUSIONS: If successful, this simple intervention may bring personal and societal benefits, particularly because it is low cost, can be easily implemented online, ensuring social distancing, and be made widely available, during future disasters and to help with trauma-related distress in IBD. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The trial has been prospectively registered in the Australian New Zealand Trial Registry - ACTRN12620000448943p.","Mikocka-Walus, Antonina; Olive, Lisa; Skvarc, David; Beswick, Lauren; Massuger, Wayne; Raven, Leanne; Emerson, Catherine; Evans, Subhadra",J Psychosom Res,105,26

The potential for causing severe illness, COVID-19, calls for strict observance of preventive measures aimed to mitigate the spread of the virus. The threat of COVID-19 is particularly serious as there is no vaccine and no specific antiviral therapy. Further complications are introduced by shortages of personal protective equipment for healthcare workers who have direct contact with patients and effective testing to identify infected patients, raising the need for delaying some testing and therapies. Certain vulnerable segments of the general population have been identified (advanced age and certain comorbidities), which should heighten further their preventive efforts.

However, despite the medical consensus, many citizens have resisted adhering to and/or supporting its implementation. While this resistance may stem from the non-negligible personal economic costs of implementing social distancing, we argue that it may also reside in more fundamental differences in normative principles and belief systems, as reflected by political orientation. In a study conducted in Brazil, we test the relative importance of these explanations by examining whether and how support for social distancing varies according to self-identified political orientation and personal economic vulnerability. Results show that while economic vulnerability does not influence support for social distancing, conservatives are systematically less supportive of these practices than liberals. Discrepancies in sensitivity to threats to the economic system help explain the phenomenon.","Ramos, Guilherme; Vieites, Yan; Jacob, Jorge; Andrade, Eduardo B",Rev. adm. pública (Online),105,16

METHODS: We performed a systematic search resulting in 10 studies reporting stroke frequency among COVID-19 patients, which were pooled with one unpublished series from Canada. We applied random-effects meta-analyses to estimate the proportion of stroke among COVID-19. We performed an additional systematic search for cases series of stroke in COVID-19 patients (n=125) and we pooled these data with 35 unpublished cases from Canada, USA, and Iran. We analyzed clinical characteristics and in-hospital mortality stratified into age groups (<50, 50-70, >70 years). We applied cluster analyses to identify specific clinical phenotypes and their relationship with death. RESULTS: The proportion of COVID-19 patients with stroke (1.8%, 95%CI 0.9-3.7%) and in-hospital mortality (34.4%, 95%CI 27.2-42.4%) were exceedingly high. Mortality was 67% lower in patients <50 years-old relative to those >70 years-old (OR 0.33, 95%CI 0.12-0.94, P=0.039). Large vessel occlusion was twice as frequent (46.9%) as previously reported and was high across all age groups, even in the absence of risk factors or comorbidities. A clinical phenotype characterized by older age, a higher burden of comorbidities, and severe COVID-19 respiratory symptoms, was associated with the highest in-hospital mortality (58.6%) and a 3x higher risk of death than the rest of the cohort (OR 3.52, 95%CI 1.53-8.09, P=0.003). CONCLUSIONS: Stroke is relatively frequent among COVID-19 patients and has devastating consequences across all ages. The interplay of older age, comorbidities, and severity of COVID-19 respiratory symptoms is associated with an extremely elevated mortality.","Fridman, Sebastian; Bullrich, Maria Bres; Jimenez-Ruiz, Amado; Costantini, Pablo; Shah, Palak; Just, Caroline; Vela-Duarte, Daniel; Linfante, Italo; Sharifi-Razavi, Athena; Karimi, Narges; Bagur, Rodrigo; Debicki, Derek B; Gofton, Teneille E; Steven, David A; Sposato, Luciano A",Neurology,105,1

Susceptibility to stress can entail damaging behaviours, a common problem in pig production. Breeding animals with increased stress resilience is difficult for various reasons. First, studies on neuroendocrine and behavioural stress responses in farm animals are scarce, as it is difficult to record adequate phenotypes under field conditions. Second, damaging behaviours and stress susceptibility are complex traits, and their biology is not yet well understood. Dissecting complex traits into biologically better defined, heritable and easily measurable proxy traits and developing biomarkers will facilitate recording these traits in large numbers. High-throughput molecular technologies (""omics"") study the entirety of molecules and their interactions in a single analysis step. They can help to decipher the contributions of different physiological systems and identify candidate molecules that are representative of different physiological pathways.

This study addresses the clinical and immunopathological characteristics of severe COVID-19. METHODS: Sixty-nine patients with COVID-19 were classified into severe and nonsevere groups to analyze their clinical and laboratory characteristics. A panel of blood cytokines was quantified over time. Biopsy specimens from 2 deceased cases were obtained for immunopathological, ultrastructural, and in situ hybridization examinations. RESULTS: Circulating cytokines, including IL-8, IL-6, TNF-&#945;, IP10, MCP1, and RANTES, were significantly elevated in patients with severe COVID-19. Dynamic IL-6 and IL-8 were associated with disease progression. SARS-CoV-2 was demonstrated to infect type II and type I pneumocytes and endothelial cells, leading to severe lung damage through cell pyroptosis and apoptosis. In severe cases, lymphopenia, neutrophilia, depletion of CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes, and massive macrophage and neutrophil infiltrates were observed in both blood and lung tissues. CONCLUSIONS: A panel of circulating cytokines could be used to predict disease deterioration and inform clinical interventions. Severe pulmonary damage was predominantly attributed to both cytopathy caused by SARS-CoV-2 and immunopathologic damage.

Prevention is of paramount importance to protect the high-risk group of the elderly when specific treatments for COVID-19 are not yet available, despite that, little work has been done to explore factors that promote preventive behaviors among this population. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate the knowledge, perceived beliefs, and preventive behaviors of elderly population in China towards COVID-19 and determine factors that influence the practice of preventive behaviors. METHODS: From February 19 to March 19, 2020, a cross-sectional, internet-based survey was administered to Chinese elderly in all of the 31 provinces in mainland China using a convenience sampling method to assess their knowledge, perceived beliefs, and preventive behaviors towards COVID-19. Standard descriptive statistics and hierarchical linear regression analyses were conducted to analyze the data. RESULTS: A total of 1501 participants responded to the survey, with 1263 valid responses left for further analysis. The overall correct rate on the knowledge questionnaire was 87%, an overall positive belief towards COVID-19 was found and the mean score of behavior was 13.73(SD 1.62, range 5-15).

At the time of writing of this paper, severe acute respiratory syndrome caused by coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been responsible - according to modest estimations - for around 4 million of infections and 300 000 deaths. Unveiling details of patomechanism, in fatal cases the role of immune dysregulation, namely cytokine release syndrome (CRS) has been discovered. Based on the current knowledge, interleukin-6 (IL6) plays a pivotal role in COVID-19 associated CRS. Case reports and result of small case series suggest efficacy of an IL6 inhibitor monoclonal antibody (tocilizumab) in treating CRS. Authors describe a case and review recent knowledge on the treatment of COVID-19. To our knowledge, the first case of severe COVID-19-associated cytokine storm syndrome - treated succesfully with IL6 monoclocal antibody at a Hungarian department of infectology - is presented here.

Adults over 65 years of age represent 80% of hospitalizations and have a 23-fold greater risk of death than those under 65. In the clinic, COVID-19 patients most commonly present with fever, cough and dyspnea, and from there the disease can progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome, lung consolidation, cytokine release syndrome, endotheliitis, coagulopathy, multiple organ failure and death. Comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes and obesity increase the chances of fatal disease, but they alone do not explain why age is an independent risk factor. Here, we present the molecular differences between young, middle-aged and older people that may explain why COVID-19 is a mild illness in some but life-threatening in others. We also discuss several biological age clocks that could be used in conjunction with genetic tests to identify both the mechanisms of the disease and individuals most at risk. Finally, based on these mechanisms, we discuss treatments that could increase the survival of older people, not simply by inhibiting the virus, but by restoring patients' ability to clear the infection and effectively regulate immune responses.","Mueller, Amber L; McNamara, Maeve S; Sinclair, David A",Aging (Albany NY),105,16

When applied to a sample of size $n$, the smoothing spline estimator can be expressed as a linear combination of $n$ basis functions, requiring $O(n^3)$ computational time when the number of predictors $d\geq 2$. Such a sizable computational cost hinders the broad applicability of smoothing splines. In practice, the full sample smoothing spline estimator can be approximated by an estimator based on $q$ randomly-selected basis functions, resulting in a computational cost of $O(nq^2)$. It is known that these two estimators converge at the identical rate when $q$ is of the order $O\{n^{2/(pr+1)}\}$, where $p\in [1,2]$ depends on the true function $\eta$, and $r>1$ depends on the type of spline. Such $q$ is called the essential number of basis functions. In this article, we develop a more efficient basis selection method. By selecting the ones corresponding to roughly equal-spaced observations, the proposed method chooses a set of basis functions with a large diversity. The asymptotic analysis shows our proposed smoothing spline estimator can decrease $q$ to roughly $O\{n^{1/(pr+1)}\}$, when $d\leq pr+1$. Applications on synthetic and real-world datasets show the proposed method leads to a smaller prediction error compared with other basis selection methods.","Meng, Cheng; Zhang, Xinlian; Zhang, Jingyi; Zhong, Wenxuan; Ma, Ping",,105,19

The effects of safety measures on neurosurgical training remain unclear. To understand how neurosurgical residents have been affected, we analyzed the operative experience in the months leading up to and during the pandemic. METHODS: The resident and institutional case totals were tallied for a single residency program in Miami-Dade County from January 1, 2019 to June 30, 2020. A matched cohort analysis was performed before and during the pandemic to assess the effects on resident surgical training. RESULTS: The case totals for all levels of training were lower when restrictions were placed on elective surgeries. An average of 11 cases was logged in April 2020, a decrease from 26 cases in April 2019 (95% confidence interval, 8.7-22; P < 0.01). An average of 20 cases was logged in May 2020, a decrease from 25 cases in May 2019 (95% confidence interval, 1.2-8.8; P = 0.01). In April and May 2020, 299 (66%) and 148 (50%) fewer cases had been performed at our institution compared with April and May 2109. CONCLUSIONS: Operative experience was reduced for residents during the months when the performance of elective cases was restricted. Our data suggest experience in some areas of neurosurgery were more affected than were others, and residents at different levels of training were also affected differently. However, the extent of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic on neurosurgical training is unlikely to be understood in the short term.","Burks, Joshua D; Luther, Evan M; Govindarajan, Vaidya; Shah, Ashish H; Levi, Allan D; Komotar, Ricardo J",World Neurosurg,105,16

In this study, we applied a zero-valent nanosilver/titania-chitosan (nano-Ag0/TiO2-CS) filter bed, whose broad-spectrum antimicrobial efficacy has been proven previously, for the removal of viral aerosols to minimize the risk of airborne transmission. Methods: The photochemical deposition method was used to synthesize the nano-Ag0/TiO2-CS antiviral material. The surface morphology, elemental composition, and microstructure of the nano-Ag0/TiO2-CS were analyzed by a scanning electron microscopy/energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and a transmission electron microscopy, respectively. The MS2 bacteriophages were used as surrogate viral aerosols. The antiviral efficacy of nano-Ag0/TiO2-CS was evaluated by the MS2 plaque reduction assay (PRA) and filtration experiments. In the filtration experiments, the MS2 aerosols passed through the nano-Ag0/TiO2-CS filter, and the MS2 aerosol removal efficiency was evaluated by an optical particle counter and culture method. Results and Conclusions: In the MS2 PRA, 3 g of nano-Ag0/TiO2-CS inactivated 97% of MS2 bacteriophages in 20 mL liquid culture (2 ± 0.5 × 1016 PFU/mL) within 2 hours. The removal efficiency of nano-Ag0/TiO2-CS filter (thickness: 6 cm) for MS2 aerosols reached up to 93%. Over 95% of MS2 bacteriophages on the surface of the nano-Ag0/TiO2-CS filter were inactivated within 20 minutes. The Wells-Riley model predicted that when the nano-Ag0/TiO2-CS filter was used in the ventilation system, airborne infection probability would reduce from 99% to 34.6%. The nano-Ag0/TiO2-CS filter could remain at 50% of its original antiviral efficiency after continuous operation for 1 week, indicating its feasibility for the control of the airborne transmission.","Wang, I-Jen; Chen, Yen-Chi; Su, Chien; Tsai, Ming-Hsuan; Shen, Wan-Tien; Bai, Chun-Hsuan; Yu, Kuo-Pin",J. aerosol med. pulm. drug deliv,105,17

In order to assess the effects of COVID-19 on care of patients with acromegaly, we conducted an international online survey of endocrinologists. The questionnaire was drafted by a Steering Committee of acromegaly experts and covered both respondent demographics, contact and communication with patients, and patient care. Respondent awareness was generated through social media campaigns and the survey completed online using Google forms. The majority of endocrinologists who responded (N = 84) were based in Europe (67.9%) and were female (58.3%). Slightly more than half of respondents worked in a specialized pituitary center (52.4%) and a large minority cared for more than 50 acromegaly patients (47.6%). Most respondents (85.7%) indicated surgery was their first-line treatment, with only 14.3% indicating medical therapy as a first-choice treatment option. One-third (33.3%) of respondents reported having delayed a planned surgery due to a lack of COVID-19 testing provision and 54.8% due to a lack of surgical provision; 19.1% indicated that a lack of personal protective equipment had reduced their ability to treat patients with acromegaly. Just 21.4% of respondents reported no negative effects from the pandemic on diagnostic practice patterns, and just 19.1% reported no negative effect on patient follow-up practices. Many respondents (55.9%) indicated that remote methods had improved their ability to communicate with their patients and 69.0% indicated that they would continue to use methods of consultation necessitated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Our data suggest the COVID-19 pandemic is substantially affecting the care of acromegaly. However, these results also suggest that endocrinologists are embracing aspects of the 'new normal' to create a novel continuum of care better suited to the presumed post-COVID-19 environment. The goal of these changes must be both to improve care while shielding patients from more severe involvement in concomitant acute illnesses such COVID-19.","Giustina, Andrea; Legg, Ewen; Cesana, Bruno Mario; Frara, Stefano; Mortini, Pietro; Fleseriu, Maria",Endocrine,105,24

Identification of factors contributing to severe disease is important to enable stratification of risk, optimize the reallocation of hospital resources, and guide public health recommendations and interventions. Subacute thyroiditis is an inflammatory thyroid disease characterized by neck pain and is usually preceded by an upper respiratory tract infection. It may be caused by a viral infection or a post-viral inflammatory reaction, and many viruses have been linked to the disease. We present case of atypical thyroiditis associated with COVID-19 infection. Case Report: 27-year-old female with no significant past medical history apart from recent COVID-19 infection is referred to endocrinology for evaluation of abnormal thyroid function test. Patient states around three months ago she was experiencing the symptoms like unintentional weight loss, nausea, palpitation, insomnia, anxiety, fatigue similar to symptoms she experienced 9 years ago while she was pregnant with her daughter so she thought she is pregnant again and visited her gynecologist. But patient had pregnancy test was done and she was found to be negative but her thyroid function test showed low TSH 0.32mIU/ml (0.47-4.68mIU/ml). Patient states around same time she was diagnosed with COVID-19 infection and she lost 5 pounds during that time but even after recovery from the infection she continued to lose weight and lost a total of 18 pounds in 3 months. Patient states during the time of COVID-19 infection she was having difficulty swallowing and painful swallowing but following infection patient denied any current difficulty swallowing or breathing, headache, vision changes, cold or heat intolerance, diarrhea or constipation, tremors, proximal muscle weakness, bulging of her eyes. Patient continue to have regular monthly menstrual cycles. Three months following infection patients repeat thyroid function tests were done and it showed normal TSH 0.56mIU/ml(0.47-4.68mIU/ml),free T4 1.05ng/dL(0.78-2.19ng/dL) and negative thyroid antibodies like TSI index&amp;lt;1.0, Thyroid peroxidase Antibodies 1.4 IU/mL, Thyrotropin Receptor Ab &amp;lt;1.00 IU/L. Patient also had normal thyroid ultrasound. Patient had complete resolution of hyperthyroid symptoms and did not require any medications. Conclusion: In conclusion, physicians should be engaged in close monitoring of thyroid disease in patients with suspected COVID-19, for timely detecting signs of disease progression.

In particular, MXene shows a 13.4 times higher removal efficiency over traditional activated carbon absorbents. Molecular-level investigations reveal that MXene exhibits a strong chemisorption mechanism for immobilizing cytokine interleukin-6 molecules, which is different from activated carbon absorbents. MXene sheet also demonstrates excellent blood compatibility without any deleterious side influence on the composition of human blood.

In this study, we investigated the cytotoxicity induced by PARP inhibitor olaparib in FLCN deficient RCC cells, and the interaction between FLCN and BRCA1 A complex-regulated DNA repair pathway. METHODS AND MATERIALS: FLCN expressing (ACHN and UOK257-F) and FLCN deficient (ACHN-2 and UOK257) cell lines were used in this research. Cell viability was detected by clonogenic assay and MTT assay. Flow cytometry and TUNEL assay were used to detect apoptosis. Autophagy in cells was measured by MDC assay, western blot, and transmission electron microscopy. Co-immunoprecipitation, immunofluorescence and western blot experiments were performed to determine the interaction between FLCN protein and BRCA1 A complex. The in vivo experiments were performed in a xenograft model by inoculating UOK 257 in nude mice. RESULTS: RCC cells with FLCN protein deficiency were more sensitive to olaparib treatment than the cells with FLCN expression. Olaparib treatment led to more severe autophagy and apoptosis in FLCN deficient ACHN-2 and UOK257 cells compared to the FLCN expressing ACHN and UOK257-F cells. Decreased BRCA1 A complex expression and disruption of DNA repair ability were detected in FLCN-deficient cells, suggesting that FLCN deficiency impaired BRCA1 A complex expression and sensitized cells to PARP inhibitor olaparib. CONCLUSIONS: RCC cells deficient in FLCN are sensitive to olaparib treatment due to the impairment of BRCA1 A complex associated DNA repair ability. The results suggest that PARP inhibitor, such as olaparib, may be a potentially effective therapeutic approach for kidney tumors with deficiency of FLCN protein.","Zhang, Qi; Xu, Yingkun; Zhang, Zhiyu; Li, Jianyi; Xia, Qinghua; Chen, Yougen",Gene,105,30

This problem leads to ensure giving specific cares to people in need either in illness or disability in their own homes. Home Health Care (HHC) proposes this kind of services for patients demanding it. These services have to be done at the request of the patient which appears to be the client in a way that gives satisfaction to the requester of the service. Often, these demands are bound by a specific time that the workforce (caregivers) are obligated to respect in addition to the precedence (priority) constraint. The main purpose of the HHC structures is to provide a service that is good in term of quality, minimize the overall costs and shorten the losses. To reduce the costs of these HHC structures, it is mandatory to find comprehensible and logical ways to do it, for it is not permissible to touch the caregiver salary, HHC structures find themselves in the obligation to optimize by other means such as reducing the travel cost. Note that these structures give cares in one's home, which means that the travel aspect is important and is considered the core spending charges of the institution. Another fact is the satisfaction of the patients toward caregivers;this is an essential element to optimize in order to obtain a good quality service, to give a realistic aspect for the problem the lunch break of caregivers is introduced as a parameter. For those arguments, a conception of an efficient planning of caregivers involves using decision tools and optimization methods. A caregiver (vehicle) is attributed to a patient (customer) to do a number of cares with several options in accordance to the customer wishes like time windows requirement often specified by the client, the priority or precedence constraints are usually performed if a care have to be performed before another and could need the intervention of more than one caregiver and must have at least one lunch break a day and it is not always taken at a set time of the day and must be versatile to optimize customer demand satisfaction. To resolve this issue which is called VRPTW-SPLB, a mathematical model of the problem is proposed and explained as a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) and a greedy heuristic based on a Greedy Randomized Adaptive Procedure (GRASP) is proposed, two strategies based on local search and two metaheuristics, and a metaheuristic resultant of an hybridization of the two metaheuristics.

While coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is bestowed with a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations, involving the vital organs, the respiratory system transpires as the main route of entry for SARS-CoV-2, with the lungs being its primary target. Of those infected, up to 20% require hospitalization on account of severity, while the majority of patients are either asymptomatic or exhibit mild symptoms. Exacerbation in the disease severity and complications of COVID-19 infection have been associated with multiple comorbidities, including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disorders, cancer, and chronic lung disease. Interestingly, a recent body of evidence indicated the pulmonary and gut microbiomes as potential modulators for altering the course of COVID-19, potentially via the microbiome-immune system axis.

However, results from clinical trials in adults with ARDS have demonstrated that HFOV does not improve clinical outcomes.

Reimbursement policies have been historically limited due to concerns of over-utilization of visits and testing. Additionally, there is limited literature on endocrinology care delivered via TH for conditions other than diabetes. OBJECTIVE: Assess real-world use of TH for endocrinology in a pre-pandemic environment with hypothesis that TH would not increase utilization of total visits or related ancillary testing services compared to conventional face-to-face office visits (CVL). METHODS: A single-institution retrospective cohort study assessing the pre-pandemic use of TH in endocrinology, consisting of 75 patients seen via TH and 225 patients seen in CVL visits. For the majority of patients, TH was conducted via a clinic-to-clinic model. Outcomes measured were total endocrine visit frequency and frequency of related laboratory and radiology testing per patient, Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), microalbumin, low density lipoprotein (LDL), thyroid stimulation hormone (TSH), thyroglobulin, and thyroid ultrasounds. RESULTS: For all endocrine visits, TH patients had a median of 0.24 (IQR 0.015-0.36) visits per month. CVL patients had median of 0.20 visits per month (IQR 0.11-0.37). Total visits per month did not vary significantly between groups (p=0.051). HbA1c outcomes were equivalent and there was no increase in ancillary lab testing for the TH group. CONCLUSIONS: Our observations demonstrate that in a pre-pandemic healthcare setting, TH visits can provide equivalent care for endocrinology patients, without increasing utilization of total visits or ancillary services.","Williams, Alexander; Walsh, Colin G; Griffith, Michelle L",Endocr. pract,105,16

FACESEC evaluation is performed along four dimensions of adversarial modeling: the nature of perturbation (e.g., pixel-level or face accessories), the attacker's system knowledge (about training data and learning architecture), goals (dodging or impersonation), and capability (tailored to individual inputs or across sets of these). We use FACESEC to study five face recognition systems in both closed-set and open-set settings, and to evaluate the state-of-the-art approach for defending against physically realizable attacks on these. We find that accurate knowledge of neural architecture is significantly more important than knowledge of the training data in black-box attacks. Moreover, we observe that open-set face recognition systems are more vulnerable than closed-set systems under different types of attacks. The efficacy of attacks for other threat model variations, however, appears highly dependent on both the nature of perturbation and the neural network architecture. For example, attacks that involve adversarial face masks are usually more potent, even against adversarially trained models, and the ArcFace architecture tends to be more robust than the others.","Tong, Liang; Chen, Zhengzhang; Ni, Jingchao; Cheng, Wei; Song, Dongjin; Chen, Haifeng; Vorobeychik, Yevgeniy",,105,1

Such emerging epidemic viruses come again and again over years, leading to similar destructive consequences. Air-borne transmission among humans is the main reason for the rapid spreading of the virus. Blocking the air-borne transmission should be a significant measure to suppress the spreading of the pandemic. Considering the hospital is the most ""dangerous"" place to occur massive cross-infection among patients as emerging virus usually comes in a disguised way, an air distribution optimization of a general three-bed hospital ward in China is carried out in this paper. Using the Eulerian-Lagrangian method, sneeze process from patients who are assumed to be the virus carrier, which is responsible for a common event to trigger cross-infection, is simulated. The trajectory of the released toxic particle and the probability of approaching others in the same ward are calculated. Two evaluation parameter, total maximum time (TMT) and overall particle concentration (OPC) to reflect the particle mobility and probability to cause cross-infection respectively, are developed to evaluate the proposed ten air distributions in this paper. A relatively optimized air distribution proposal with the lowest TMT and OPC is distinguished through a three-stage actively analysis. Results show that a bottom-in and top-out air distribution proposal is recommended to minimize the cross-infection.","Wang, Ji-Xiang; Cao, Xiang; Chen, Yong-Ping",J Clean Prod,105,20

STUDY DESIGN: International Classification of Diseases codes were used to identify children with Kawasaki disease admitted to a tertiary center in the southeastern US. Subjects diagnosed and treated according to American Heart Association criteria were included. Demographic, laboratory, clinical, and echocardiographic data from the electronic medical record (2000-2015) were compared between Blacks and Whites. RESULTS: Data from 369 subjects (52% Whites and 48% Blacks) were included in our analysis. No significant differences related to timely admission, IVIG treatment, or coronary artery (CA) abnormalities during hospitalization were observed. Blacks showed lower IVIG response rates than Whites for patients administered IVIG within 10 days of fever onset (86.6% vs 95.6%; P = .007). Blacks received more ancillary drugs (9.6% vs 2.6%; P = .003), and endured longer hospitalizations (mean, 5 ± 3.9 days vs 3.4 ± 2.2 days; P = .001). Blacks presented with higher C-reactive protein level and erythrocyte sedimentation rate and lower hemoglobin, albumin, and sodium levels. Blacks had a higher proportion of persistent CA abnormalities than Whites at second follow-up echocardiogram (14.5% vs 6.3%; P = .03), and at third follow-up echocardiogram (21.2% vs 6.9%; P = .01). CONCLUSIONS: Compared with White children, Black children with Kawasaki disease had higher IVIG refractory prevalence, more severe inflammation, more ancillary treatments, and longer hospitalizations. Despite no racial differences in time to diagnosis or initial treatment, there was greater CA abnormality persistence among Black children at follow-up.","Padilla, Luz A; Collins, Jacqueline L; Idigo, Adeniyi J; Lau, Yung; Portman, Michael A; Shrestha, Sadeep",J. pediatr.

Many studies have used RT-PCR analysis to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA on surfaces but seldom has viable virus been detected. This paper investigates the viability over time of SARS-CoV-2 dried onto a range of materials and compares viability of the virus to RNA copies recovered, and whether virus viability is concentration dependant.Viable virus persisted for the longest time on surgical mask material and stainless steel with a 99.9% reduction in viability by 122 and 114 hours respectively. Viability of SARS-CoV-2 reduced the fastest on a polyester shirt, with a 99.9% reduction within 2.5 hours. Viability on the bank note was reduced second fastest, with 99.9% reduction in 75 hours. RNA on all the surfaces exhibited a one log reduction in genome copy recovery over 21 days.The findings show that SARS-CoV-2 is most stable on non-porous hydrophobic surfaces. RNA is highly stable when dried on surfaces with only one log reduction in recovery over three weeks. In comparison, SARS-CoV-2 viability reduced more rapidly, but this loss in viability was found to be independent of starting concentration. Expected levels of SARS-CoV-2 viable environmental surface contamination would lead to undetectable levels within two days. Therefore, when RNA is detected on surfaces it does not directly indicate presence of viable virus even at high CT values.ImportanceThis study shows the impact of material type on the viability of SARS-CoV-2 on surfaces. It demonstrates that the decay rate of viable SARS-CoV-2 is independent of starting concentration. However, RNA shows high stability on surfaces over extended periods. This has implications for interpretation of surface sampling results using RT-PCR to determine the possibility of viable virus from a surface, where RT-PCR is not an appropriate technique to determine viable virus. Unless sampled immediately after contamination it is difficult to align RNA copy numbers to quantity of viable virus on a surface.","Paton, Susan; Spencer, Antony; Garratt, Isobel; Thompson, Katy-Anne; Dinesh, Ikshitaa; Aranega-Bou, Paz; Stevenson, David; Clark, Simon; Dunning, Jake; Bennett, Allan; Pottage, Thomas",,105,1

COVID-19 pathology is characterized by extreme inflammation and amplified immune response with activation of a cytokine storm. A subsequent progression to acute lung injury (ALI) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) can take place, which is often followed by death. The causes of these strong inflammatory responses in SARS-CoV-2 infection are still unknown. As uncontrolled pulmonary inflammation is likely the main cause of death in SARS-CoV-2 infection, anti-inflammatory therapeutic interventions are particularly important. Fenretinide N-(4-hydroxyphenyl) retinamide is a bioactive molecule characterized by poly-pharmacological properties and a low toxicity profile. Fenretinide is endowed with antitumor, anti-inflammatory, antiviral, and immunomodulating properties other than efficacy in obesity/diabetic pathologies. Its anti-inflammatory and antiviral activities, in particular, could likely have utility in multimodal therapies for the treatment of ALI/ARDS in COVID-19 patients. Moreover, fenretinide administration by pulmonary delivery systems could further increase its therapeutic value by carrying high drug concentrations to the lungs and triggering a rapid onset of activity. This is particularly important in SARS-CoV-2 infection, where only a narrow time window exists for therapeutic intervention.","Orienti, Isabella; Gentilomi, Giovanna Angela; Farruggia, Giovanna",Int J Mol Sci,105,0

Psychological stress, anxiety and depression are affecting not only COVID-19 patients but also health professionals, and general population. Fear of contracting COVID-19, forced restrictive social measures, and economic hardship are causing mental trauma. Nepal is a developing country from South Asia where the COVID-19 pandemic is still evolving. This online survey has been carried out to understand impact of COVID- 19 on mental health of Nepalese community dwellers. METHODS: The COVID-19 Peritraumatic Distress Index (CPDI) questionnaire adapted from the Shanghai Mental Health Centre was used for online data collection from 11 April-17 May 2020. Collected data were extracted to Microsoft excel-13 and imported and analyzed using SPSS (Statistical Package for Social Sciences) version-22. An initial univariate analysis was conducted for all variables to assess the distribution. Logistic regression analyses were done to estimate the odds ratios of relevant predicting variables. RESULTS: A total of 410 participants completed the self-rated questionnaires. Mean age of study participants was 34.8 ± 11.7 years with male preponderance. 88.5% of the respondents were not in distress (score less than 28) while, 11% had mild to moderate distress and 0.5% had severe distress. The prevalence of distress is higher among age group > 45 years, female gender, and post-secondary education group. Health professional were more likely to get distressed. Respondents with post-secondary education had higher odds (OR = 3.32; p = 0.020) of developing distress as compared to respondents with secondary education or lower. CONCLUSION: There is lower rate of psychological distress in city dwellers and people with low education. Adequate intervention and evaluation into mental health awareness, and psychosocial support focused primarily on health care workers, female and elderly individuals is necessary.","Shrestha, Dhan Bahadur; Thapa, Bikash Bikram; Katuwal, Nagendra; Shrestha, Bikal; Pant, Chiranjibi; Basnet, Bina; Mandal, Pankaj; Gurung, Amol; Agrawal, Ankita; Rouniyar, Ramhari",BMC Psychiatry,105,5

AIM: To analyze differences among age groups in terms of triggering factors and seasonality and to identify those with higher risk of severe exacerbations. METHODS: We retrospectively revised the files of children admitted for acute asthma in 2016 in our Pediatric ED. RESULTS: Visits for acute asthma were 603/23197 (2.6%). 76% of the patients were <6 years old and 24% ≥6. Infections were the main trigger of exacerbations in both groups; 33% of the school-aged children had a triggering allergic condition (versus 3% in <6 years; p < .01). 191 patients had a previous history of asthma; among them, 95 were ≥6 years, 67% of whom were not using any controller medication, showing a higher risk of a moderate-to-severe exacerbation than those under long-term therapy (p < .01). Exacerbations peaked in autumn and winter in preschoolers and in spring and early autumn in the school-aged children. CONCLUSIONS: Infections are the main trigger of acute asthma in children of any age, followed by allergy in the school-aged children. Efforts for an improved management of patients affected by chronic asthma might go through individualized action plans and possibly vaccinations and allergen-avoidance measures.","Dondi, Arianna; Calamelli, Elisabetta; Piccinno, Valentina; Ricci, Giampaolo; Corsini, Ilaria; Biagi, Carlotta; Lanari, Marcello",Biomed Res Int,105,20

SARS is caused by a novel species of coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and is the most severe coronavirus-mediated human disease that has been described so far. On the basis of similarities with other coronavirus infections, SARS might, in part, be immune mediated. As discussed in this Review, studies of animals that are infected with other coronaviruses indicate that excessive and sometimes dysregulated responses by macrophages and other pro-inflammatory cells might be particularly important in the pathogenesis of disease that is caused by infection with these viruses. It is hoped that lessons from such studies will help us to understand more about the pathogenesis of SARS in humans and to prevent or control outbreaks of SARS in the future.","Dandekar, Ajai A.; Perlman, Stanley",Nat Rev Immunol,105,16

The presented research focuses on utilizing a built-in magnetic field sensor, whose readouts are intentionally affected by moving a strong permanent magnet around a smartphone device. Different approaches for supporting magnet-based Around-Device Interaction are applied, including magnetic field fingerprinting, curve-fitting modeling, and machine learning. We implemented the corresponding proof-of-concept applications that incorporate magnet-based interaction. Namely, text entry is achieved by discrete positioning of the magnet within a keyboard mockup, and free-move pointing is enabled by monitoring the magnet’s continuous movement in real-time. The related solutions successfully expand both the interaction language and the interaction space in front of the device without altering its hardware or involving sophisticated peripherals. A controlled experiment was conducted to evaluate the provided text entry method initially. The obtained results were promising (text entry speed of nine words per minute) and served as a motivation for implementing new interaction modalities. The use of neural networks has shown to be a better approach than curve fitting to support free-move pointing. We demonstrate how neural networks with a very small number of input parameters can be used to provide highly usable pointing with an acceptable level of error (mean absolute error of 3 mm for pointer position on the smartphone display).","Ljubic, Sandi; Hržić, Franko; Salkanovic, Alen; Štajduhar, Ivan",Sensors (Basel),105,27

However, limited evidence exists on how frequency and duration of exercise affect the risk of hypoglycemia. The study aimed to compare the percentage of time spent in hypoglycemia between two 5-day periods with different frequency and duration of physical activity. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In this outpatient randomized crossover study, 26 participants aged 18–65 years with type 1 diabetes for ≥2 years and insulin pump use for ≥1 year were included. After a 7-day observation period, participants completed two 5-day intervention periods separated by a washout period of at least 14 days. One period included five exercise sessions on 5 consecutive days (5S), each consisting of 4 min of resistance training and 30 min of aerobic exercise. Another period included two exercise sessions on 2 days with at least 2 days in between (2S), each consisting of 10 min of resistance training and 75 min of aerobic exercise. During each period, participants performed in total 150 min of aerobic exercise and 20 min of resistance training and wore continuous glucose monitors (Dexcom G6) and accelerometers (ActiGraph wGT3X-BT). RESULTS: Twenty insulin pump-treated adults (10 women) with type 1 diabetes completed the study. The baseline median (range) age was 48 (24–64) years, glycated hemoglobin 55 (44–66) mmol/mol, diabetes duration 24 (8–57) years, and body mass index 28.4 (22.3–35.8) kg/m(2). No differences were observed between 5S and 2S in the percentage (mean±SD) of time spent below 3.9 mmol/L (3.5%±2.8% vs 4.5%±4.2%, p=0.28), time spent in 3.9–10.0 mmol/L (65.3%±15.0% vs 68.5%±13.6%, p=0.31), time spent above 10.0 mmol/L (31.2%±16.4% vs 27.3%±14.5%, p=0.15), mean glucose (8.7±1.3 mmol/L vs 8.5±1.2 mmol/L, p=0.33) and glycemic variability (35.8%±5.3% vs 35.8%±6.6%, p=0.97).

Of 437 Americans and their travel companions on the ship, 114 (26%) tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). METHODS: We interviewed 229 American passengers and crew after disembarkation following a ship-based quarantine to identify risk factors for infection and characterize transmission onboard the ship. RESULTS: The attack rate for passengers in single-person cabins or without infected cabinmates was 18% (58/329), compared with 63% (27/43) for those sharing a cabin with an asymptomatic infected cabinmate, and 81% (25/31) for those with a symptomatic infected cabinmate. Whole genome sequences from specimens from passengers who shared cabins clustered together. Of 66 SARS-CoV-2-positive American travelers with complete symptom information, 14 (21%) were asymptomatic while on the ship. Among SARS-CoV-2-positive Americans, 10 (9%) required intensive care, of whom 7 were ≥70 years. CONCLUSION: Our findings highlight the high risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission on cruise ships. High rates of SARS-CoV-2 positivity in cabinmates of individuals with asymptomatic infections suggest that triage by symptom status in shared quarters is insufficient to halt transmission. A high rate of intensive care unit admission among older individuals complicates the prospect of future cruise travel during the pandemic, given typical cruise passenger demographics. The magnitude and severe outcomes of this outbreak were major factors contributing to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s decision to halt cruise ship travel in U.S. waters in March 2020.","Plucinski, Mateusz M; Wallace, Megan; Uehara, Anna; Kurbatova, Ekaterina V; Tobolowsky, Farrell A; Schneider, Zachary D; Ishizumi, Atsuyoshi; Bozio, Catherine H; Kobayashi, Miwako; Toda, Mitsuru; Stewart, Andrea; Wagner, Riley L; Moriarty, Leah F; Murray, Rachel; Queen, Krista; Tao, Ying; Paden, Clinton; Mauldin, Matthew R; Zhang, Jing; Li, Yan; Elkins, Christopher A; Lu, Xiaoyan; Herzig, Carolyn T A; Novak, Ryan; Bower, William; Medley, Alexandra M; Acosta, Anna M; Knust, Barbara; Cantey, Paul T; Pesik, Nicki T; Halsey, Eric S; Cetron, Martin S; Tong, Suxiang; Marston, Barbara J; Friedman, Cindy R",Clin Infect Dis,105,1

There is still a lack of a comprehensive model describing these complex associations. We present a Bayesian disease model that provides insight in the spatiotemporal distribution of KD in Canada from 2004 to 2017. The disease model including environmental factors had improved Watanabe-Akaike information criterion (WAIC) compared to the base model which included only spatiotemporal and demographic effects and had excellent performance in recapitulating the spatiotemporal distribution of KD in Canada (98% and 86% spatial and temporal correlations, respectively). The model suggests an association between the distribution of KD and population composition, weather-related factors, aeroallergen exposure, pollution, atmospheric concentration of spores and algae, and the incidence of healthcare encounters for bacterial pneumonia or viral intestinal infections. This model could be the basis of a hypothetical data-driven framework for the spatiotemporal distribution of KD. It also generates novel hypotheses about the etiology of KD, and provides a basis for the future development of a predictive and surveillance model.","Low, Tisiana; McCrindle, Brian W.; Mueller, Brigitte; Fan, Chun-Po S.; Somerset, Emily; O’Shea, Sunita; Tsuji, Leonard J.

In this research note, we integrate insights from cross-cultural research with inquiry in social psychology and public health literatures to advance a theoretically grounded and culturally derived explanation of cross-national variance in the growth rate of COVID-19. Our multi-level analyses, based on longitudinal time series data from 107 nations, and focused on the first 91 days of this pandemic in different nations, illustrate the direct and interactive effects of culture. Specifically, we find that individualism and uncertainty avoidance have a positive impact, while power distance and masculinity have a negative impact, on the growth rate of COVID-19 cases. Three-way interaction analyses between time, government stringency, and culture indicate that early government stringency attenuated pandemic growth, and this attenuation effect was more significant in collectivistic than in individualistic nations, and in high rather than low power distance nations. Our findings provide evidence that can enable policymakers and organizations to develop strategies that not only conform to science but that also consider the cultural orientation of nations.","Dheer, Ratan J.

During a pandemic, laboratories play a key role in helping healthcare providers and public health authorities detect active infection, a task most commonly achieved using nucleic acid-based assays. While the landscape of diagnostics is rapidly evolving, PCR remains the gold-standard of nucleic acid-based diagnostic assays, in part due to its reliability, flexibility and wide deployment. To address a critical local shortage of testing capacity persisting during the COVID-19 outbreak, our hospital set up a molecular-based laboratory developed test (LDT) to accurately and safely diagnose SARS-CoV-2.

But, some people, especially those younger in age, have flouted restrictions, harming themselves and the community. We explore the moral foundations underlying people's compliance with the three behaviors. Our study with 1033 Americans revealed that caring and fairness concerns predict complying with all behaviors, while sanctity concerns only predict compliance with wearing face masks and social distancing. A deeper investigation revealed age differences in loyalty and sanctity concerns for staying-at-home and social distancing, and in sanctity concerns only for wearing face masks. The findings document the innate intuitions that guide one's decision to comply with such behaviors. They also provide governments and policy officials with implications on possible message frames to use in communicating the importance of the three behaviors in order to protect one's and the public's health from COVID-19 and other flu-like illnesses in the future.","Chan, Eugene Y.",Pers Individ Dif,105,26

Important sensors for the detection of virus infection are the RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs), which, in turn, are antagonized by many RNA viruses and DNA viruses. Among the different escape strategies are viral mechanisms to dysregulate the post-translational modifications (PTMs) that play pivotal roles in RLR regulation. In this review, we present the current knowledge of immune evasion by viral pathogens that manipulate ubiquitin- or ISG15-dependent mechanisms of RLR activation. Key viral strategies to evade RLR signaling include direct targeting of ubiquitin E3 ligases, active deubiquitination using viral deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs), and the upregulation of cellular DUBs that regulate RLR signaling. Additionally, we summarize emerging new evidence that shows that enzymes of certain coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of the current COVID-19 pandemic, actively deISGylate key molecules in the RLR pathway to escape type I interferon (IFN)-mediated antiviral responses. Finally, we discuss the possibility of targeting virally-encoded proteins that manipulate ubiquitin- or ISG15-mediated innate immune responses for the development of new antivirals and vaccines.","Chiang, Cindy; Liu, Guanqun; Gack, Michaela U.",Viruses,105,29

In this study, we found that CD147 expression was primarily increased in mouse and human atherosclerotic lesions that were rich in macrophages and could be upregulated by ox-LDL. High-throughput compound screening indicated that ox-LDL-induced CD147 upregulation in macrophages was achieved through PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling. Genetic deletion of macrophage CD147 protected against foam cell formation by impeding cholesterol uptake, probably through the scavenger receptor CD36. The opposite effect was observed in primary macrophages isolated from macrophage-specific CD147-overexpressing mice. Moreover, bioinformatics results indicated that CD147 suppression might exert an atheroprotective effect via various processes, such as cholesterol biosynthetic and metabolic processes, LDL and plasma lipoprotein clearance, and decreased platelet aggregation and collagen degradation.

The dimeric enzyme dissociated at guanidinium chloride concentration of <0.4 M, at which the enzymatic activity loss showed close correlation with the subunit dissociation. Further increase in guanidinium chloride induced a reversible biphasic unfolding of the enzyme. The unfolding of the C-terminal domain-truncated enzyme, on the other hand, followed a monophasic unfolding curve. Different mutants of the full-length protease (W31 and W207/W218), with tryptophanyl residue(s) mutated to phenylalanine at the C-terminal or N-terminal domain, respectively, were constructed. Unfolding curves of these mutants were monophasic but corresponded to the first and second phases of the protease, respectively. The unfolding intermediate of the protease thus represented a folded C-terminal domain but an unfolded N-terminal domain, which is enzymatically inactive due to loss of regulatory properties.

A mega-review of literature reviews, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses on interventions using aided augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) interventions for children with intellectual and developmental disabilities from 2000 to mid-2020 was conducted. Participant and interventionist demographics, interventions, settings, outcomes, and recommendations of each review were reported and summarized. A MeaSurement Tool to Assess systematic Reviews Revised (AMSTAR 2; Shea et al., 2017) was used to examine the methodological rigor of 84 included reviews. Over the past 20 years, published reviews have increased slightly in methodological rigor but demonstrate a number of methodological weaknesses that detract from the strength of evidence for AAC interventions with this population.

A systematic literature search was performed for English language articles and conference papers indexed in Pubmed, PsycInfo, ERIC, CINAHL, WoS, IEEE, and ACM digital libraries up until January 2020. A follow-up search was conducted to cover the literature published until December 2020 for the usefulness and interest in this area of research during the Covid-19 emergency. In total, 2427 articles were initially retrieved from databases search. Additional 481 articles were retrieved from follow-up search. Finally, 28 articles met the inclusion criteria and were included in the review. The studies included involved four main interface modalities: Natural User Interface (e.g., eye trackers), PC or mobile, Wearable, and Robotics. Most of the papers included (n = 20) involved the use of Level 1 screening tools. Notwithstanding the variability of the solutions identified, psychometric information points to considering available technologies as promising supports in clinical practice to detect early sign of ASD in young children.

SARS-CoV-2 infection can lead to elevated markers of endothelial dysfunction associated with higher risk of mortality. It is unclear whether endothelial dysfunction is caused by direct infection of endothelial cells or is mainly secondary to inflammation. Here, we investigate whether different types of endothelial cells are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2. Human endothelial cells from different vascular beds including umbilical vein endothelial cells, coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAEC), cardiac and lung microvascular endothelial cells, or pulmonary arterial cells were inoculated in vitro with SARS-CoV-2. Viral spike protein was only detected in HCAECs after SARS-CoV-2 infection but not in the other endothelial cells tested. Consistently, only HCAEC expressed the SARS-CoV-2 receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), required for virus infection. Infection with the SARS-CoV-2 variants B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and P.2 resulted in significantly higher levels of viral spike protein. Despite this, no intracellular double-stranded viral RNA was detected and the supernatant did not contain infectious virus. Analysis of the cellular distribution of the spike protein revealed that it co-localized with endosomal calnexin. SARS-CoV-2 infection did induce the ER stress gene EDEM1, which is responsible for clearance of misfolded proteins from the ER. Whereas the wild type of SARS-CoV-2 did not induce cytotoxic or pro-inflammatory effects, the variant B.1.1.7 reduced the HCAEC cell number. Of the different tested endothelial cells, HCAECs showed highest viral uptake but did not promote virus replication. Effects on cell number were only observed after infection with the variant B.1.1.7, suggesting that endothelial protection may be particularly important in patients infected with this variant.

The objective of this study was to determine the early effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the surgical care of patients with cleft lip and/or palate at a high-volume cleft center. METHODS: A retrospective comparative cohort study of patients with cleft lip and/or palate undergoing lip adhesion, cleft lip and nose repair, and palatoplasty before and during the pandemic was conducted. There were 50 patients in the prepandemic cohort and 53 in the pandemic cohort. RESULTS: Mean age at lip adhesion was 3.1 ± 1.1 months prepandemic (n = 8) and 3.5 ± 2.5 months in the pandemic cohort (n = 8) (P = 0.75). One lip adhesion was delayed by 1.6 months. Mean age at cleft lip and nose repair was 6.6 ± 1.9 months prepandemic (n = 23) and 8.0 ± 2.1 months in the pandemic cohort (n = 23) (P = 0.03). Six pandemic cleft lip and nose repairs were delayed; the mean delay was 2.6 ± 1.8 months. The mean age at palatoplasty was 13.9 ± 2.2 months prepandemic (n = 26) and 14.1 ± 2.9 months in the pandemic cohort (n = 26) (P = 0.79). Seven pandemic palatoplasties were delayed; the mean delay was 3.3 ± 1.4 months. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic caused delays at each stage of repair for cleft lip and/or palate-related procedures; however, only cleft lip and nose repair were significantly affected.

Relatively few studies have longitudinally investigated OD in ambulatory patients with objective methods. METHODS: We performed a longitudinal study to investigate OD among COVID-19 ambulatory patients compared to symptomatic controls who test negative. Out of 81 patients enrolled, 45 COVID-19 positive patients and an age- and sex-matched symptomatic control group completed the BSIT and a questionnaire about smell, taste and nasal symptoms. These were repeated at 1 month for all COVID-19 positive patients, and again at 3 months for those who exhibited persistent OD. Analysis was performed by mixed-effects linear and logistic regression. RESULTS: 46.7% of COVID-19 patients compared to 3.8% of symptomatic controls exhibited OD at 1-week post diagnosis (p<0.001). At 1 month, 16.7%, (6 of 36), of COVID-19 patients had persistent OD. Mean improvement in BSIT score in COVID-19 patients between 1-week BSIT and 1 month follow-up was 2.0 (95% CI 1.00 - 3.00, p<0.001). OD did not correlate with nasal congestion (r= -0.25, 95% CI, -0.52 to 0.06, p=0.12). CONCLUSIONS: Ambulatory COVID-19 patients exhibited OD significantly more frequently than symptomatic controls. Most patients regained normal olfaction by 1 month. The BSIT is a simple validated and objective test to investigate the prevalence of OD in ambulatory patients.

Previous work demonstrated that cells infected with vhs mutants display enhanced activation of the host double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-activated protein kinase R (PKR), implying that vhs limits dsRNA accumulation in infected cells. Confirming this hypothesis, we show that partially complementary transcripts of the UL23/UL24 and UL30/31 regions of the viral genome increase in abundance when vhs is inactivated, giving rise to greatly increased levels of intracellular dsRNA formed by annealing of the overlapping portions of these RNAs. Thus, vhs limits accumulation of dsRNA at least in part by reducing the levels of complementary viral transcripts. We then asked if vhs also destabilizes dsRNA after its initial formation. Here, we used a reporter system employing two mCherry expression plasmids bearing complementary 3’ UTRs to produce defined dsRNA species in uninfected cells. The dsRNAs are unstable, but are markedly stabilized by co-expressing the HSV dsRNA-binding protein US11. Strikingly, vhs delivered by super-infecting HSV virions accelerates the decay of these pre-formed dsRNAs in both the presence and absence of US11, a novel and unanticipated activity of vhs. Vhs binds the host RNA helicase eIF4A, and we find that vhs-induced dsRNA decay is attenuated by the eIF4A inhibitor hippuristanol, providing evidence that eIF4A participates in the process. Our results show that a herpesvirus host shutoff RNase destabilizes dsRNA in addition to targeting partially complementary viral mRNAs, raising the possibility that the mRNA destabilizing proteins of other viral pathogens dampen the host response to dsRNA through similar mechanisms.","Dauber, Bianca; Saffran, Holly A.; Smiley, James R.",PLoS Pathog,105,1

Originally suspected of having suffered an opiate overdose, it became clear that they were the victims of anti‐cholinesterase poisoning—the Soviet era poison Novichok. Twenty‐five days later, two further patients were admitted with the same symptoms. One of these patients died 8 days later and the second remained in hospital for 3 weeks. A Clinical Psychologist was present on the unit throughout the major incident and all staff directly involved received psycho‐educational support regarding self‐care. AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To examine the psychological impact of the longest running major incident in NHS history on the staff directly involved. DESIGN: A cross‐sectional design was used, with structured questionnaires administered retrospectively. METHODS: A link to an electronic survey was emailed to every member of staff in the organization. The survey included the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, the Maslach Burnout Inventory, the Impact of Events Scale—Revised (to both the March and June events). RESULTS: 540/4000 hospital staff responded (13.5% response rate) with a 29/59 (49%) response rate in intensive care staff. Frontline staff had significantly lower scores on anxiety (P < .05 for the June incident), depressive symptoms (P < .05 March and June) and subscales of burnout than managers (depersonalization P < .05). On the remaining two burnout subscales and on anxiety scores for those involved in March, results trended towards significance (P < .1).

In such a scenario, electronic health records (EHRs) should provide a timely response to healthcare needs and to data uses that go beyond direct medical care and are known as secondary uses, which includes biomedical research. However, it is usual for each data analysis initiative to define its own information model in line with its requirements. These specifications share clinical concepts, but differ in format and recording criteria, something that creates data entry redundancy in multiple electronic data capture systems (EDCs) with the consequent investment of effort and time by the organization. Objective This study sought to design and implement a flexible methodology based on detailed clinical models (DCM), which would enable EHRs generated in a tertiary hospital to be effectively reused without loss of meaning and within a short time. Material and methods The proposed methodology comprises four stages: (1) specification of an initial set of relevant variables for COVID-19; (2) modeling and formalization of clinical concepts using ISO 13606 standard and SNOMED CT and LOINC terminologies; (3) definition of transformation rules to generate secondary use models from standardized EHRs and development of them using R language; and (4) implementation and validation of the methodology through the generation of the International Severe Acute Respiratory and emerging Infection Consortium (ISARIC-WHO) COVID-19 case report form. This process has been implemented into a 1,300-bed tertiary Hospital for a cohort of 4,489 patients hospitalized from 25 February 2020 to 10 September 2020. Results An initial and expandable set of relevant concepts for COVID-19 was identified, modeled and formalized using ISO-13606 standard and SNOMED CT and LOINC terminologies. Similarly, an algorithm was designed and implemented with R, and then applied to process EHRs, in accordance with standardized concepts, and transforming them into secondary use models. Lastly, these resources were applied to obtain a data extract conforming to the ISARIC-WHO COVID-19 case report form, without requiring manual data collection. The methodology allowed obtaining the observation domain of this model with a coverage of over 85% of patients in the majority of concepts. Conclusion This study has furnished a solution to the difficulty of rapidly and efficiently obtaining EHR-derived data for secondary use in COVID-19, capable of adapting to changes in data specifications and applicable to other organizations and other health conditions. The conclusion to be drawn from this initial validation is that this DCM-based methodology allows the effective reuse of EHRs generated in a tertiary Hospital during COVID-19 pandemic, with no additional effort or time for the organization and with a greater data scope than that yielded by conventional manual data collection process in ad-hoc EDCs.","Pedrera Jiménez, Miguel; García Barrio, Noelia; Cruz Rojo, Jaime; Isabel Terriza Torres, Ana; Ana López Jiménez, Elena; Calvo Boyero, Fernando; Jesús Jiménez Cerezo, María; Javier Blanco Martínez, Alvar; Roig Domínguez, Gustavo; Luis Cruz Bermúdez, Juan; Luis Bernal Sobrino, José; Serrano Balazote, Pablo; Muñoz Carrero, Adolfo",J Biomed Inform,105,29

Mature defense mechanisms represent the high adaptive group, including suppression, which allows the subject to distance disturbing contents from consciousness. In line with general defensive intents, suppression would preserve stable mood states, as in the case of euthymia. Clinical issues usually disturb homeorhesis, so that the study of subjects’ suppressive tendencies would suggest possible existing relations among defense mechanisms, mood states, and clinical issues. The study highlighted the significant existing relations among factors such as suppression, euthymia, mood states, and clinical psychological phenomena. Methods: The observation group was composed of 150 participants, 51 males (34%) and 99 females (66%), aged from 25 to 30 years old, with a mean age of 26.63 years old (SD = 1.51). The study was conducted through the use of measures related to subjects’ characteristics, euthymia, psychological flexibility and psychological well-being (Euthymia Scale), suppression (Suppression Mental Questionnaire), well-being (Who-5), and compassion (ProQol-5). Results: The performed analyses consisted of descriptive statistics, correlations, differences, and regressions among the considered variables. Starting from the first hypothesis, SMQ factors appeared to be significantly and positively correlated with Euthymia factors, rather than Regression in the Ego service (-). In line with the previous result, significant and positive correlations emerged among SMQ and Well-being (WHO-5) variables, maintaining an inverse relation with Regression in the Ego service. Significant differences emerged between male and female groups concerning SMQ total score and rationalization, with higher male group scores. Finally, significant dependencies emerged among the selected predictors (SMQ variables) and Compassion satisfaction. Conclusion: The emerged results highlighted significant relations among the considered variables so that it was possible to highlight the common directions assumed by suppression variables, well-being, and euthymia. Moreover, suppression appeared as a significant predictor with a causal role in clinical satisfaction. The results that have emerged allow us to consider defenses through an empirical perspective, useful to suggest an extension to other groups, phenomena, and conditions.","Merlo, Emanuele Maria; Stoian, Anca Pantea; Motofei, Ion G.; Settineri, Salvatore",Front Psychol,105,16

These IL‐10(+)CD8(+) T cells possessed a strong inhibitory effect on the CD4(+) T cell proliferation in an IL‐10‐dependent and cell contact‐dependent fashion. In comparison with IL‐10(−)CD8(+) T cells, IL‐10(+)CD8(+) T cells expressed an array of Th2‐like cytokines (IL‐4, IL‐5), perforin, and granzymes, as well as the cell cycle regulatory protein Cdkn2a. Interestingly, knockdown of cdkn2a using siRNA reduced IL‐4‐induced IL‐10 production significantly. Furthermore, CD8(+) T cells from Cdkn2a(−/−) mice produced a significantly lower amount of IL‐10, and the effect was limited to CD8(+) T cells but not observed in CD4(+) T cells and APCs.

Most faithful and orthodox Catholic moral theologians, among whom I count myself, have concluded that their use is not intrinsically evil. Therefore, like every other decision that falls into the category of actions that are not intrinsically evil, the decision to be vaccinated with these morally controversial vaccines has to be governed by the virtue of prudence. It is a decision that calls for a wisdom that properly sees this action within the constellation of actions that propels the human agent to the heights of holiness. This is why prayer is so essential for authentic moral judgment. With prayer, we ask the Holy Spirit who is the all-prudent one to guide our actions so that we can choose and act well not only for our only well-being but for the well-being of all. Acts that are not themselves intrinsically evil are deemed virtuous or not within the narrative of the individual person’s life.","Austriaco, Nicanor Pier Giorgio",Linacre Q,105,5

Adding on to the already existing burnout, an increase in incidents of violence and aggression against HCWs was seen in Pakistan and globally. OBJECTIVES: Primarily to review cases of violence against HCWs in Pakistan, highlighting and comparing the instigating factors seen within the country and globally. Secondly, to enlist possible interventions to counter workplace violence in healthcare during a pandemic and in general. METHODS: Incidents of violence towards HCWs in Pakistan during the COVID-19 pandemic occurring between April 7, 2020, and August 7, 2020, were included. The incidents reported from local newspapers were reviewed. FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION: A total of 29 incidents were identified, with perpetrators of violence most commonly being relatives of COVID-19 patients. Most frequent reasons included mistrust in HCWs, belief in conspiracy theories, hospitals’ refusal to admit COVID-19 patients due to limited space, COVID-19 hospital policies, and the death of the COVID-19 patients. Protests by doctors and other HCWs for provision of adequate PPE, better quarantine conditions for doctors with suspected COVID-19, and better compensation for doctors on COVID-19 patient duty resulted in police violence towards HCWs. To avoid such incidents in the future, institutions, healthcare policymakers, media organisations, and law enforcement agencies must work together for widespread public awareness to counter misconceptions and to exhibit responsible journalism. In hospitals, measures such as de-escalation training and increased security must be implemented. Furthermore, law enforcement agencies must be trained in non-violent methods of crowd dispersal and control to manage peaceful protests by HCWs over legitimate issues.","Bhatti, Omaima Anis; Rauf, Hareem; Aziz, Namrah; Martins, Russell Seth; Khan, Javaid A.",Annals of global health,105,14

Anesthesia machines have been used as alternatives to traditional ICU mechanical ventilators. However, the outcomes for patients with COVID-19 respiratory failure cared for with Anesthesia Machines is currently unknow. We hypothesized that COVID-19 patients receiving care with Anesthesia Machines would have worse outcomes compared to standard practice.MethodsWe designed a retrospective study of patients admitted with a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis at a large tertiary urban hospital in northern Italy. Two care units were included: a 27-bed standard ICU and a 15-bed temporary unit emergently opened in an operating room setting. Intubated patients assigned to Anesthesia Machines (AM group) were compared to a control cohort treated with standard mechanical ventilators (ICU-VENT group). Outcomes were assessed at 60-day follow-up. A multivariable Cox regression analysis of risk factors between survivors and non-survivors was conducted to determine the adjusted risk of death for patients assigned to AM group.ResultsComplete daily data from 89 mechanically ventilated patients consecutively admitted to the two units were analyzed. Seventeen patients were included in the AM group, whereas 72 were in the ICU-VENT group. Disease severity and intensity of treatment were comparable between the two groups. The 60-day mortality was significantly higher in the AM group compared to the ICU-vent group (12/17 vs. 27/72, 70.6% vs. 37.5%, respectively, p = 0.016). Allocation to AM group was associated with a significantly increased risk of death after adjusting for covariates (HR 4.05, 95% CI: 1.75–9.33, p = 0.001). Several incidents and complications were reported with Anesthesia Machine care, raising safety concerns.ConclusionsOur results support the hypothesis that care associated with the use of Anesthesia Machines is inadequate to provide long-term critical care to patients with COVID-19. Added safety risks must be considered if no other option is available to treat severely ill patients during the ongoing pandemic.Clinical Trial NumberNot applicable","Bottiroli, Maurizio; Calini, Angelo; Pinciroli, Riccardo; Mueller, Ariel; Siragusa, Antonio; Anelli, Carlo; Urman, Richard; Nozari, Ala; Berra, Lorenzo; Mondino, Michele; Fumagalli, Roberto",Res Sq,105,33

In this study, we carried out detailed phylogenetic analysis and sequence comparisons based on 74 complete nucleotide sequences of the IBV S1 gene, including strain I0636/16 and 73 representative sequences from each genotype and lineage. The results showed that strain I0636/16 represented a novel genotype, designated as lineage 1 within genotype VII (GVII-1). Further comparative genomic analysis revealed at least two recombination sites that replaced the spike gene in a lineage 18 within genotype I (GI-18)-like virus with an as-yet-unidentified sequence, likely derived from another IBV strain, resulting a novel serotype with a lower affinity to the respiratory tract in chickens. To the best of our knowledge, this provides the first evidence for recombination leading to replacement of the complete spike gene and the emergence of a novel genotype/serotype with a lower affinity to the respiratory tract in chickens comparing to one of its parental virus ck/CH/LGX/111119. These results emphasize the importance of limiting exposure to novel IBVs that may serve as a source of genetic material for emerging viruses, as well as the importance of IBV surveillance in chicken flocks.","Ma, Tianxin; Xu, Liwen; Ren, Mengting; Shen, Jie; Han, Zongxi; Sun, Junfeng; Zhao, Yan; Liu, Shengwang",Vet Microbiol,105,29

METHODS: The suite of existing pandemic preparedness generic epidemiological early investigation protocols was rapidly adapted for COVID-19, branded the 'UNITY studies' and promoted globally for the implementation of standardized and quality studies. Ten protocols were developed investigating household (HH) transmission, the first few cases (FFX), population seroprevalence (SEROPREV), health facilities transmission (n = 2), vaccine effectiveness (n = 2), pregnancy outcomes and transmission, school transmission, and surface contamination. Implementation was supported by WHO and its partners globally, with emphasis to support building surveillance and research capacities in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). RESULTS: WHO generic protocols were rapidly developed and published on the WHO website, 5/10 protocols within the first 3 months of the response. As of 30 June 2021, 172 investigations were implemented by 97 countries, of which 62 (64%) were LMIC. The majority of countries implemented population seroprevalence (71 countries) and first few cases/household transmission (37 countries) studies. CONCLUSION: The widespread adoption of UNITY protocols across all WHO regions indicates that they addressed subnational and national needs to support local public health decision-making to prevent and control the pandemic.","Bergeri, Isabel; Lewis, Hannah C; Subissi, Lorenzo; Nardone, Anthony; Valenciano, Marta; Cheng, Brianna; Glonti, Ketevan; Williams, Bridget; Abejirinde, Ibukun-Oluwa Omolade; Simniceanu, Alice; Cassini, Alessandro; Grant, Rebecca; Rodriguez, Angel; Vicari, Andrea; Al Ariqi, Lubna; Azim, Tasnim; Wijesinghe, Pushpa Ranjan; Rajatonirina, Soatiana Cathycia; Okeibunor, Joseph Chukwudi; Le, Linh-Vi; Katz, Mark; Vaughan, Aisling; Jorgensen, Pernille; Freidl, Gudrun; Pebody, Richard; Van Kerkhove, Maria D",Influenza other respir. viruses,105,20

However, the prevalence of malnutrition and its outcomes is uncertain. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence and outcome of malnutrition among patients with COVID-19. Method A comprehensive search was conducted in PubMed/Medline; Science direct and LILACS from December 29, 2019 to September, 2020 without language restriction. All observational studies reporting the prevalence of malnutrition were included while case reports and reviews were excluded. The data were extracted with two independent authors with a customized format and the disagreements were resolved by the other authors. The methodological quality of included studies was evaluated using a standardized critical appraisal tool. Results A total of 511 articles were identified from different databases and 27 articles were selected for evaluation after the successive screening. Fourteen articles with 4187 participants were included. The pooled prevalence of malnutrition among hospitalized patients with COVID-19 was 49.11% (95% CI: 31.67 to 66.54). The odd of mortality among patients COVID-19 with malnutrition was 10 times more likely as compared to those who were well-nourished. Conclusion The prevalence of malnutrition and mortality associated with malnutrition among COVID-19 hospitalized patients was very high which entails a mitigating strategy by different stakeholders to prevent and manage malnutrition and its outcomes.

The nucleotide sequence of the E2 gene for wild-type strain MHV-4 was found to be very similar to that of MHV-JHM but had an insertion of 423 nucleotides resulting in the addition of a stretch of 141 unique amino acids in the amino-terminal domain of E2.

We focus on Peru, a country that imposed a strict nationwide lockdown starting in mid-March and where nearly 60% of women already experienced violence before COVID-19. Using administrative data on phone calls to the helpline for domestic violence (Línea 100), we find that the incidence rate of the calls increased by 48 percent between April and July 2020, with effects increasing over time. The rise in calls is found across all states and it is not driven by baseline characteristics, including previous prevalence of violence against women.

The susceptibility for PRRSV varies between the different breeds of swine. In cell culture, PRRSV virus can be propagated in primary porcine alveolar macrophages and some African green monkey kidney cell lines, such as MARC-145 cells. Previous studies have shown that 3' untranslated region (UTR) RNAs of the arteriviruses play an important role in the replication of the virus through interactions with cellular proteins. To better understand the differences in the replication capability of PRRSV in different cell lines, we sought to identify the host cellular proteins interacting with PRRSV 3' UTR RNA. We constructed a cDNA library of MARC-145 cell line in lambda ZAP Express vector and screened the library with the positive sense 3' UTR RNA of PRRSV. RESULTS: We found that CD151, a host cellular protein, interacting with PRRSV 3' UTR RNA. The specificity of the interaction between CD151 and PRRSV 3' UTR RNA was examined by gel shift assay as well as North-Western hybridization. The transfection of CD151 expression clone into BHK-21 rendered these cells susceptible to PRRSV infection, and the transfection of siRNA against CD151 into MARC-145 significantly reduced the level of PRRSV infection. Also, anti-CD151 antibody treatment to MARC-145 completely blocked PRRSV infection. CONCLUSION: Based on our results, we suggest that CD151 should cooperate in PRRSV infection in vitro in MARC-145 and BHK-21 cells.","Shanmukhappa, Kumar; Kim, Jeong-Ki; Kapil, Sanjay",Virol J,105,1

It is caused by SARS-CoV-2 that requires the ACE2 receptor and serine proteases to enter airway epithelial cells (AECs). Objective: To determine what factors are associated with ACE2 expression particularly in patients with asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Methods: We obtained upper and lower AECs from 145 people from two independent cohorts, aged 2-89, Newcastle (n=115), and from Perth (n= 30) Australia. The Newcastle cohort was enriched with people with asthma (n=37) and COPD (n=38). Gene expression for ACE2 and other genes potentially associated with SARS-CoV-2 cell entry were assessed by quantitative PCR, protein expression was confirmed with immunohistochemistry on endobronchial biopsies and cultured AECs. Results: Increased gene expression of ACE2 was associated with older age (p=0.02) and male sex (p=0.03), but not pack-years smoked. When we compared gene expression between adults with asthma, COPD and healthy controls, mean ACE2 expression was lower in asthma (p=0.01). Gene expression of furin, a protease that facilitates viral endocytosis, was also lower in asthma (p=0.02), while ADAM-17, a disintegrin that cleaves ACE2 from the surface was increased (p=0.02). ACE2 protein levels were lower in endobronchial biopsies from asthma patients. Conclusions: Increased ACE2 expression occurs in older people and males. Asthma patients have reduced expression. Altered ACE2 expression in the lower airway may be an important factor in virus tropism and may in part explain susceptibility factors and why asthma patients are not over-represented in those with COVID-19 complications.","Wark, P.; Pathinyake, P.; Kaiko, G.; Nichol, K.; Ali, A.; Chen, L.; Suntanto, E.; Garrat, L.; Sohal, S.

Currently, there are no clinical or laboratory markers that predict thrombotic risk. Circulating immature platelets are hyper-reactive platelets, which are associated with arterial thrombotic events. The aim of this study was to assess whether the proportion of circulating immature platelets is associated with disease severity in Covid-19 patients. Patients admitted with Covid-19 disease were prospectively assessed. Immature platelet count (IPC) and immature platelet fraction (IPF) were measured at admission and at additional time points during the hospital course using the Sysmex XN-3000 auto-analyzer. A total of 136 consecutive patients with Covid-19 were recruited [mean age 60 ± 19 years, 49% woman, 56 (41%) had mild-moderate disease and 80 (59%) had severe disease at presentation].

OBJECTIVE: Is to describe this antibiotic misuse and its contributing factors. Also, to measure the pharmacists' application of infection preventive practices during the pandemic. METHODS: A cross‐sectional study was conducted among randomly selected Egyptian community pharmacists (Center, East, Delta, and Upper Egypt) using a questionnaire and direct interviews from 1 to 30 August 2020. The questionnaire consisted of two parts, the first covered pharmacist's demographic data and their application of basic infection preventive practices (eg, wearing face masks, regular hand sanitization, etc), and the other part was related to antibiotic dispensing patterns. Data were descriptively analyzed and the impact of participant experience on the responses was evaluated using the χ(2) test. RESULTS: From 480 randomly selected Egyptian community pharmacists, 413 (87%) consented to participate in the study. 86.7% of the participants were keen to wear face masks (n = 358) and 86.2% kept regular hand sanitization (n = 356); whereas, 46.9% (n = 194) maintained adequate antibiotic stock supply during the pandemic. Nearly 67% (n = 275) of the pharmacists reported that patients were more likely to be given antibiotics for showing any sign or symptom of COVID‐19 infection, and 82% (n = 74 278) of the dispensed antibiotics were given upon physician recommendation. Azithromycin, Ceftriaxone, and Linezolid were the major antibiotics dispensed to COVID‐19 presumptive patients Azithromycin was given to ~40% of presumptive patients showing only mild or moderate symptoms for 5‐10 days. Additionally, antibiotic combinations were given to 74% (n = 62 479) of home‐isolated patients for a maximum of 2 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: Pharmacists applied suitable sanitation and infection control protocols. Meanwhile, antibiotics were dispensed heavily during this pandemic without proper clinical indication and for long durations supporting the idea of antibiotic misuse.","Elsayed, Asmaa A.; Darwish, Samar F.; Zewail, Moataz B.; Mohammed, Marwa; Saeed, Haitham; Rabea, Hoda",Int J Clin Pract,105,9

In this study, we aim to estimate the rate of change in average daily travel distance from a participant's registered address before and after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. Method: Participants were recruited into Virus Watch starting in June 2020. Weekly surveys were sent out to participants and vaccination status was collected from January 2021 onwards. Between September 2020 and February 2021, we invited 13,120 adult Virus Watch participants to contribute towards our tracker sub-cohort which uses the Global Positioning System (GPS) to collect data on movement. We used segmented linear regression to estimate the median daily travel distance before and after the first self-reported SARS-CoV-2 vaccine dose. Results: We analysed the daily travel distance of 228 vaccinated adults. Between 157 days prior to vaccination until the day before vaccination, the median daily travel distance travelled was 8.9km (IQR: 3.50km, 24.17km). Between the day of vaccination and 100 days after vaccination, the median daily travel distance travelled was 10.30km (IQR: 4.11, 27.53km). Between 157 days prior to vaccination and the vaccination date, there was a daily median decrease in mobility of 40m (95%CI: -51m, -31m, p-value <0.001) per day. After the removal of outlier data, and between the vaccination date and 99 days after vaccination, there was a median daily increase in movement of 45.0m (95%CI: 25m, 65m, p-value = <0.001). Restricting the analysis to the 3rd national lockdown (4th of January 2021 to the 5th of April 2021), we found a median daily movement increase of 9m (95%CI: -25m, 45m, p = 0.57) in the 30 days prior to vaccination and the vaccination date, and a median daily movement increase of 10m (95%CI: -60m, 94m, p-value = 0.69) in the 30 days after vaccination. Conclusions: Our study demonstrates the feasibility of collecting high volume geolocation data as part of research projects, and the utility of these for understanding public health issues. Our results are consistent with both an increase and decrease in movement after vaccination and suggest that, amongst Virus Watch participants, any changes in movement distances post-vaccination are small.","Nguyen, V.; Liu, Y.; Mumford, R.; Flanagan, B.; Patel, P.; Braithwaite, I.; Shrotri, M.; Byrne, T.

Assuming an equally proportional change in the output/input ratio, we can estimate how many additional medical resource health service units would be required if the number of hospitalizations was expected to increase during an epidemic outbreak. This assessment proposes a two-step methodology for hospital beds vacancy and reallocation during the COVID-19 pandemic. The framework determines the production capacity of hospitals through data envelopment analysis and incorporates the complexity of needs in two categories for the reallocation of beds throughout the medical specialties. As a result, we have a set of inefficient healthcare units presenting less complex bed slacks to be reduced, that is, to be allocated for patients presenting with more severe conditions. The first results in this work, in collaboration with state and municipal administrations in Brazil, report 3772 beds feasible to be evacuated by 64% of the analyzed health units, of which more than 82% are moderate complexity evacuations. The proposed assessment and methodology can provide a direction for governments and policymakers to develop strategies based on a robust quantitative production capacity measure.","Nepomuceno, Thyago C.

This study analysed suspected suicide rates in 2020 relative to 2015–19 to assess any early effects of the COVID-19 pandemic in Queensland, Australia. METHODS: We analysed data from the interim Queensland Suicide Register (iQSR), a state-wide real-time suicide surveillance system, using an interrupted time-series design. The data source for the iQSR is the Form 1 police report of a death to a coroner. Two QSR staff independently classed the probability of a death by suicide as possible, probable, or beyond reasonable doubt. The analysis included the probable or beyond reasonable doubt categories as suspected suicides. The primary outcome was the monthly suspected suicide rate. We applied Poisson and negative binomial regressions to assess whether Queensland's Public Health Emergency Declaration on Jan 29, 2020, affected suspected suicides from Feb 1 to Aug 31, 2020. Secondary outcomes included absolute or relative changes in police-reported motives of recent unemployment, financial problems, domestic violence, and relationship breakdown. FINDINGS: 3793 suspected suicides were recorded with an unadjusted monthly rate of 14·85 deaths per 100 000 people (from Jan 1, 2015, to Jan 31, 2020) before the declaration, and 443 suspected suicides were recorded with an unadjusted monthly rate of 14·07 deaths per 100 000 people (Feb 1, 2020, onwards) after the declaration. An interrupted time-series Poisson regression model unadjusted (rate ratio [RR] 0·94, 95% CI 0·82–1·06) and adjusted for overdispersion, seasonality, and pre-exposure trends (RR 1·02, 95% CI 0·83–1·25) indicated no evidence of a change in suspected suicide rates. We found no absolute or relative increases in the motives for suspected suicides, including recent unemployment, financial problems, relationship breakdown, or domestic violence from February to August, 2020, compared with the pre-exposure period. INTERPRETATION: There does not yet appear to be an overall change in the suspected suicide rate in the 7 months since Queensland declared a public health emergency. Despite this, COVID-19 has contributed to some suspected suicides in Queensland. Ongoing community spread and increasing death rates of COVID-19, and its impact on national economies and mental health, reinforces the need for governments to maintain the monitoring and reporting of suicide mortality in real time.

They are mainly expressed in mammalian phagocytic leukocytes and play important roles in inflammatory and immune responses. N-formyl peptides produced by Gram-negative bacteria were among the first chemotactic factors identified for two FPRs in human beings: FPR1 (originally termed FPR) and FPR2 (originally termed FPRL1). During the past few years, a variety of novel pathogen- and host-derived agonists as well as antagonists for the FPR family have been identified, indicating a broader spectrum of the biological significance of these receptors. Activation of FPRs in leukocytes by agonists induces cell chemotaxis, phagocytosis, release of proinflammatory mediators and gene transcription. Despite these new developments, the in vivo functions of FPRs and their ligands in disease states are not yet fully understood. This chapter summarizes the pharmacological characterization of FPR ligands and their implications in pathophysiological conditions.","Liu, Ying; Chen, Keqiang; Wang, Ji Ming",Handbook of Biologically Active Peptides,105,16

The current COVID-19 pandemic is no different. While there have been ample studies describing racial disparities in COVID-19 outcomes, relatively few have established an empirical link between these disparities and structural racism. Such empirical analyses are critically important to help defuse “victim-blaming” narratives about why minority communities have been badly hit by COVID-19. In this paper, we explore the empirical link between structural racism and disparities in county-level COVID-19 outcomes by county racial composition. Using negative binomial regression models, we examine how five measures of county-level residential segregation and racial disparities in socioeconomic outcomes as well as incarceration rates are associated with county-level COVID-19 outcomes. We find significant associations between higher levels of measured structural racism and higher rates of COVID-19 cases and deaths, even after adjusting for county-level population sociodemographic characteristics, measures of population health, access to healthcare, population density, and duration of the COVID-19 outbreak. One percentage point more Black residents predicted a 1.1% increase in county case rate. This association decreased to 0.4% when structural racism indicators were included in our model. Similarly, one percentage point more Black residents predicted a 1.8% increase in county death rates, which became non-significant after adjustment for structural racism. Our findings lend empirical support to the hypothesis that structural racism is an important driver of racial disparities in COVID-19 outcomes, and reinforce existing calls for action to address structural racism as a fundamental cause of health disparities.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to present three case reports that highlight the capability of RPM to enable early identification of viral infection with COVID-19 in patients with chronic respiratory disease. METHODS: Patients at a large pulmonary practice who were enrolled in a respiratory RPM program and who had contracted COVID-19 were identified. The RPM system (Spire Health) contains three components: (1) Health Tags (Spire Health), undergarment waistband-adhered physiologic monitors that include a respiratory rate sensor; (2) an app on a smartphone; and (3) a web dashboard for use by respiratory therapists. The physiologic data of 9 patients with COVID out of 1000 patients who were enrolled for monitoring were retrospectively reviewed, and 3 instances were identified where the RPM system had notified clinicians of physiologic deviation due to the viral infection. RESULTS: Physiologic deviations from respective patient baselines occurred during infection onset and, although the infection manifested differently in each case, were identified by the RPM system. In the first case, the patient was symptomatic; in the second case, the patient was presymptomatic; and in the third case, the patient varied from asymptomatic to mildly symptomatic. CONCLUSIONS: RPM systems intended for long-term use and that use patient-specific baselines can highlight physiologic changes early in the course of acute disease, such as COVID-19 infection. These cases demonstrate opportunities for earlier diagnosis, treatment, and isolation. This study supports the need for further research into how RPM can be effectively integrated into clinical practice.","Polsky, Michael; Moraveji, Neema",Interact J Med Res,105,22

Here, we describe a molecular nanotechnology that enables direct and sensitive detection of viral RNA targets in native clinical samples. The technology, termed catalytic amplification by transition-state molecular switch (CATCH), leverages DNA-enzyme hybrid complexes to form a molecular switch. By ratiometric tuning of its constituents, the multicomponent molecular switch is prepared in a hyperresponsive state—the transition state—that can be readily activated upon the binding of sparse RNA targets to turn on substantial enzymatic activity. CATCH thus achieves superior performance (~8 RNA copies/μl), direct fluorescence detection that bypasses all steps of PCR (<1 hour at room temperature), and versatile implementation (high-throughput 96-well format and portable microfluidic assay). When applied for clinical COVID-19 diagnostics, CATCH demonstrated direct and accurate detection in minimally processed patient swab samples.","Sundah, Noah R.; Natalia, Auginia; Liu, Yu; Ho, Nicholas R.

Toward this objective, we conducted a large population study in Clalit Health Services (CHS), the largest healthcare provider in Israel, insuring over 4.7 million members. METHODS: Two case-control matched cohorts were assembled to assess which medications, acquired in the last month, decreased the risk of COVID-19 hospitalization. Case patients were adults aged 18 to 95 hospitalized for COVID-19. In the first cohort, five control patients, from the general population, were matched to each case (n=6202); in the second cohort, two non-hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 positive control patients were matched to each case (n=6919). The outcome measures for a medication were: odds ratio (OR) for hospitalization, 95% confidence interval (CI), and the p-value, using Fisher’s exact test. False discovery rate was used to adjust for multiple testing. RESULTS: Medications associated with most significantly reduced odds for COVID-19 hospitalization include: ubiquinone (OR=0.185, 95% CI [0.058 to 0.458], p<0.001), ezetimibe (OR=0.488, 95% CI [0.377 to 0.622], p<0.001), rosuvastatin (OR=0.673, 95% CI [0.596 to 0.758], p<0.001), flecainide (OR=0.301, 95% CI [0.118 to 0.641], p<0.001), and vitamin D (OR=0.869, 95% CI [0.792 to 0.954], p<0.003). Remarkably, acquisition of artificial tears, eye care wipes, and several ophthalmological products were also associated with decreased risk for hospitalization. CONCLUSIONS: Ubiquinone, ezetimibe, and rosuvastatin, all related to the cholesterol synthesis pathway were associated with reduced hospitalization risk. These findings point to a promising protective effect which should be further investigated in controlled, prospective studies.

The highly contagious COVID-19 disease has spread to 216 countries in less than six months. Though several vaccine candidates are being claimed, an effective vaccine is yet to come. In present study we have designed and theoretically validated novel Multi-Patch Vaccines against SARS-CoV-2. Methodology A novel reverse epitomics approach, “overlapping-epitope-clusters-to-patches” method is utilized to identify multiple antigenic regions from the SARS-CoV-2 proteome. These antigenic regions are here termed as “Ag-Patch or Ag-Patches”, for Antigenic Patch or Patches. The identification of Ag-Patches is based on clusters of overlapping epitopes rising from a particular region of SARS-CoV-2 protein. Further, we have utilized the identified Ag-Patches to design Multi-Patch Vaccines (MPVs), proposing a novel methodology for vaccine design and development. The designed MPVs were analyzed for immunologically crucial parameters, physiochemical properties and cDNA constructs. Results We identified 73 CTL (Cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte), 49 HTL (Helper T-Lymphocyte) novel Ag-Patches from the proteome of SARS-CoV-2. The identified Ag-Patches utilized to design MPVs cover 768 (518 CTL and 250 HTL) overlapping epitopes targeting different HLA alleles. Such large number of epitope coverage is not possible for multi-epitope vaccines. The large number of epitopes covered implies large number of HLA alleles targeted, and hence large ethnically distributed human population coverage. The MPVs:Toll-Like Receptor ectodomain complex shows stable nature with numerous hydrogen bond formation and acceptable root mean square deviation and fluctuation. Further, the cDNA analysis favors high expression of the MPVs constructs in human cell line. Conclusion Highly immunogenic novel Ag-Patches are identified from the entire proteome of SARS CoV-2 by a novel reverse epitomics approach. We conclude that the novel Multi-Patch Vaccines could be a highly potential novel approach to combat SARS-CoV-2, with greater effectiveness, high specificity and large human population coverage worldwide.

Methods With a phenomenological approach, this qualitative study was adopted semi-structured interviews by phone or video calls. A total of 9 male nurses newly recruited for the COVID-19 wards in Chinese hospitals were interviewed for this study. And Colaizzi's method was applied for evaluation in the data analysis. Results Based on our findings, three themes were extracted. Firstly, the newly recruited male nurses showed negative emotions at the beginning of COVID-19 epidemic, which was caused by changesin working conditions and content, but also prompted the nurses to change the way of coping with the crisis. Secondly, they gradually mastered the working skills and psychological training tocope with COVID-19, and developed a positive attitude towards life and a high sense of professional responsibility. Finally, we learned about their needs to respond to public health emergencies such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Conclusion COVID-19 is a disaster for all of humanity. The newly recruited male nurses are an important force in emergency rescue. Although they suffered from short-term negative emotions, they quickly adapted to the crisis. In order to better prepare for future emergencies, the disaster response capacity of newly recruited male nurses needs to be further improved. In addition, newly recruited male nurses have a strong demand for timely and personalized career development guidance.","Zhou, Huiyue; Wang, Xin; Du, Ruofei; Cheng, Xiang; Zheng, Kexin; Dong, Shiqi; Henri, Justin; Chen, Changying; Wang, Tao",Asian Nurs Res (Korean Soc Nurs Sci),105,16

METHODS: We studied patients with proven COVID-19 disease in the intensive care unit of Jinyintan Hospital, Wuhan, China from 30 to 2019 to 31 March 2020. RESULTS: Of 180 patients, 89 (49.44 %) had died, 85 (47.22 %) had been discharged alive, and 6 (3.33 %) were still hospitalised by the end of data collection. A D-dimer concentration of > 0.5 mg/L on admission was significantly associated with 30 day mortality, and a D-dimer concentration of > 5 mg/L was found in a much higher proportion of non-survivors than survivors. Sepsis-induced coagulopathy (SIC) and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) scoring systems were dichotomised as < 4 or ≥ 4 and < 5 or ≥ 5, respectively, and the mortality rate was significantly different between the two stratifications in both scoring systems. Enoxaparin was administered to 68 (37.78 %) patients for thromboembolic prophylaxis, and stratification by the D-dimer concentration and DIC score confirmed lower mortality in patients who received enoxaparin when the D-dimer concentration was > 2 than < 2 mg/L or DIC score was ≥ 5 than < 5. A low platelet count and low serum calcium concentration were also related to mortality. CONCLUSIONS: A D-dimer concentration of > 0.5 mg/L on admission is a risk factor for severe disease. A SIC score of > 4 and DIC score of > 5 may be used to predict mortality. Thromboembolic prophylaxis can reduce mortality only in patients with a D-dimer concentration of > 2 mg/L or DIC score of ≥ 5.","Zheng, Runhui; Zhou, Jing; Song, Bin; Zheng, Xia; Zhong, Ming; Jiang, Li; Pan, Chun; Zhang, Wei; Xia, Jiaan; Chen, Nanshan; Wu, Wenjuan; Zhang, Dingyu; Xi, Yin; Lin, Zhimin; Pan, Ying; Liu, Xiaoqing; Li, Shiyue; Xu, Yuanda; Li, Yimin; Tan, Huo; Zhong, Nanshan; Luo, Xiaodan; Sang, Ling",Exp Hematol Oncol,105,24

However, ministries of health lack clear policies, strategic plans or dedicated funding to implement anti-FGM interventions. Along with limited relevant knowledge and skills to prevent the practice of FGM and care for girls and women living with FGM, health providers have limited interpersonal communication skills and self-efficacy, while some may have supportive attitudes towards FGM and its medicalization. We propose to test the effectiveness of a health system strengthening intervention that includes training antenatal care (ANC) providers on person-centred communication (PCC) for FGM prevention. METHODS: This will be a two-level, hybrid, effectiveness-implementation research study using a cluster randomized trial design in Guinea, Kenya and Somalia conducted over a 6 months period. In each country, within pre-selected regions/counties, 60 ANC clinics will be randomized to intervention and control arms. At baseline, all clinics will receive the level one intervention involving provision of FGM-related clinical guidelines and handbook as well as anti-FGM policies and posters. At month 3, intervention clinics will receive the level two intervention comprising of a training for ANC providers on PCC to challenge their FGM-related attitudes and build their communication skills to effectively provide FGM prevention counselling. A process evaluation will be conducted to understand ‘how’ and ‘why’ the intervention package achieves intended results. Multi-level regression modelling will be used for quantitative data analysis while qualitative data will be assessed using thematic content analysis to determine the effectiveness, feasibility and acceptability of the different intervention levels.

However, uncontrolled inflammation and the “cytokine storm” are hallmarks of immunopathology in severe infection. Cytokine storm is a broad term for a phenomenon with diverse characteristics and drivers, depending on host genetics, age, and other factors. Taking advantage of the differential use of virus-sensing systems by different cell types, we test the hypothesis that specifically blocking TLR7-dependent, immune cell–produced cytokines reduces influenza-related immunopathology. In a mouse model of severe influenza characterized by a type I interferon (IFN-I)–driven cytokine storm, TLR7 antagonist treatment leaves epithelial antiviral responses unaltered but acts through pDCs and monocytes to reduce IFN-I and other cytokines in the lung, thus ameliorating inflammation and severity. Moreover, even in the absence of IFN-I signaling, TLR7 antagonism reduces inflammation and mortality driven by monocyte-produced chemoattractants and neutrophil recruitment into the infected lung. Hence, TLR7 antagonism reduces diverse types of cytokine storm in severe influenza.","Rappe, Julie C.F.; Finsterbusch, Katja; Crotta, Stefania; Mack, Matthias; Priestnall, Simon L.; Wack, Andreas",J Exp Med,105,16

The coronavirus pandemic brought vast quantities of new information to the public for rapid consumption. This study explored how people most impacted by the pandemic have judged and perceived the quality of information regarding COVID-19 and regulated the information flow. Methods. This was a qualitative study of semi-structured interviews developed as a pragmatic study targeting several groups most impacted by the pandemic. Participants were identified through convenience, purposive, and snowball sampling methods. They were interviewed by phone or video conference. Results. Twenty-five participants were interviewed between 6 April 2020 and 1 May 2020. In terms of verifying information and judging its quality, people judged information by the source. People compared information across sources and attempted to verify the quality. Most felt self-assured about their capacity to judge information. Regarding the quality of information, many participants felt the information was skewed or inaccurate. Contradictory information was confusing, especially with a strong suspicion of ulterior motives of information sources impacting trust in the provided information. Yet, some recognized the iterative process of healthcare-related information. In terms of regulating information flow, many participants perceived flooding with information. To counter information overload, some became selective with types of information input. Many developed the habit of taking breaks periodically. Conclusion. Improving risk communication in a pandemic is of paramount importance. Organizations working in public health must develop ways to regulate information flow in collaboration with trusted community partners. Individuals also must develop strategies to improve information management.","Al Achkar, Morhaf; Thompson, Matthew J.; Nguyen, Diem; Hoeft, Theresa J.",Int J Environ Res Public Health,105,6

Our previous study has shown that cytokine storm occurred during SARS-CoV-2 infection, while the detailed role of cytokines in the disease severity and progression remained unclear due to the limited case number. In this study, we examined 48 cytokines in the plasma samples from 53 COVID-19 cases, among whom 34 were severe cases, and the others moderate. Results showed that 14 cytokines were significantly elevated upon admission in COVID-19 cases. Moreover, IP-10, MCP-3, and IL-1ra were significantly higher in severe cases, and highly associated with the PaO2/FaO2 and Murray score. Furthermore, the three cytokines were independent predictors for the progression of COVID-19, and the combination of IP-10, MCP-3 and IL-1ra showed the biggest area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver-operating characteristics (ROC) calculations. Serial detection of IP-10, MCP-3 and IL-1ra in 14 severe cases showed that the continuous high levels of these cytokines were associated with disease deterioration and fatal outcome. In conclusion, we report three cytokines that closely associated with disease severity and outcome of COVID-19. These findings add to our understanding of the immunopathologic mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 infection, which suggested novel therapeutic targets and strategy.","Yang, Yang; Shen, Chenguang; Li, Jinxiu; Yuan, Jing; Yang, Minghui; Wang, Fuxiang; Li, Guobao; Li, Yanjie; Xing, Li; Peng, Ling; Wei, Jinli; Cao, Mengli; Zheng, Haixia; Wu, Weibo; Zou, Rongrong; Li, Delin; Xu, Zhixiang; Wang, Haiyan; Zhang, Mingxia; Zhang, Zheng; Liu, Lei; Liu, Yingxia",,105,4

A straightforward way to assess this is to tally the active cases and the recovered ones throughout the epidemic. Here, we show how epidemic control can be assessed with molecular information during a well characterized epidemic in Iceland. We demonstrate how the viral concentration decreased in those newly diagnosed as the epidemic transitioned from exponential growth phase to containment phase. The viral concentration in the cases identified in population screening decreased faster than in those symptomatic and considered at high risk and that were targeted by the healthcare system. The viral concentration persists in recovering individuals as we found that half of the cases are still positive after two weeks. We demonstrate that accumulation of mutations in SARS-CoV-2 genome can be exploited to track the rate of new viral generations throughout the different phases of the epidemic, where the accumulation of mutations decreases as the transmission rate decreases in the containment phase. Overall, the molecular signatures of SARS-CoV-2 infections contain valuable epidemiological information that can be used to assess the effectiveness of containment measures.","Jonsson, Hakon; Magnusson, Olafur T.; Melsted, Pall; Berglund, Jonas; Agustsdottir, Arna B.; Eiríksdottir, Berglind; Fridriksdottir, Run; Garðarsdottir, Elisabet Eir; Georgsson, Gudmundur; Gretarsdottir, Olafia S.; Guðmundsson, Kjartan R.; Gunnarsdottir, Thora Rosa; Eggertsson, Hannes; Gylfason, Arnaldur; Holm, Hilma; Jensson, Brynjar O.; Jonasdottir, Aslaug; Jonsson, Frosti; Josefsdottir, Kamilla S.; Thordardottir, Marianna; Kristinsson, Karl G.; Kristjánsson, Þórður; Magnusdottir, Droplaug N.; Roux, Louise le; Saemundsdottir, Jona; Sigurdsson, Asgeir; Sigmundsdottir, Gudrun; Sveinbjornsson, Gardar; Rognvaldsson, Solvi; Eiriksson, Ogmundur; Magnusson, Magnus Karl; Sveinsdottir, Kristin Eva; Sveinsdottir, Maney; Thorarensen, Emil Aron; Thorbjornsson, Bjarni; Löve, Arthur; Norddahl, Gudmundur L.; Jonsdottir, Ingileif; Sulem, Patrick; Masson, Gisli; Moller, Alma; Gudnason, Thorolfur; Kristjansson, Mar; Helgason, Agnar; Gudbjartsson, Daniel F.; Thorsteinsdottir, Unnur; Stefansson, Kari",Nat Commun,105,24

Though the event took place behind closed doors and in a context of national public health restrictive measures, it counted almost 6,000 participants. METHODS: A rigorous “Covid-19 Prevention and Hygiene Protocol” was drawn up by the local and regional health authorities together with the organizing committee, in order to contain the risk of viral circulation within the venue. RESULTS: Overall about 20,000 rapid antigen nasal swabs were performed to screen-detect sars-cov2 cases: only 22 of these were found positive, whereas 25 people were quarantined as close contacts. CONCLUSIONS: The experience of “Cortina2021” proves that mass gatherings can take place even in times of epidemic threats, if adequately planned and by providing public health recommendations tailored on the viral circulation foreseen by the time the event is due. If new epidemics should arise in the future, hopefully the public health management of “Cortina2021” may be a template for next mass gatherings to be held, as far as possible, despite the viral circulation.","Anna, De Polo; Luigi, Pais Dei Mori; Michele, Mongillo; Giuseppe, De Luca; Giacomo, Facchin; Giangiacomo, Marchesan; Matteo, Stevanato; Michele, Di Gallo; Andrea, Apollonio; Giacomo, Volpe; Eliana, Modolo; Francesca, Russo; Sandro, Cinquetti",J Public Health (Oxf),105,18

We investigate relaxation scenarios using an age-structured transmission model that has been fitted to age-specific seroprevalence data, hospital admissions, and projected vaccination coverage for Portugal. Our analyses suggest that the pressing need to restart socioeconomic activities could lead to new pandemic waves, and that substantial control efforts prove necessary throughout 2021. Using knowledge on control measures introduced in 2020, we anticipate that relaxing measures completely or to the extent as in autumn 2020 could launch a wave starting in April 2021. Additional waves could be prevented altogether if measures are relaxed as in summer 2020 or in a step-wise manner throughout 2021. We discuss at which point the control of COVID-19 would be achieved for each scenario.","Viana, João; van Dorp, Christiaan H.; Nunes, Ana; Gomes, Manuel C.; van Boven, Michiel; Kretzschmar, Mirjam E.; Veldhoen, Marc; Rozhnova, Ganna",Nat Commun,105,22

We scanned over 182,000 SARS-CoV-2 genomes for selective sweep signatures and found a distinct footprint of positive selection located around a non-synonymous change (A1114G; T372A) within the Spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD), predicted to remove glycosylation and increase binding to human ACE2 (hACE2), the cellular receptor. This change is present in all human SARS-CoV-2 sequences but not closely related viruses from bats and pangolins. As predicted, T372A RBD bound hACE2 with higher affinity in experimental binding assays. We engineered the reversion mutant (A372T) and found that A372 (WT-SARS-CoV-2) enhanced replication in human lung cells relative to its putative ancestral variant (T372), an effect which was 20x greater than the well-known D614G mutation. Our findings suggest that this mutation likely contributed to SARS-CoV-2’s emergence from animal reservoirs or enabled sustained human-to-human transmission.","Kang, Lin; He, Guijuan; Sharp, Amanda K.; Wang, Xiaofeng; Brown, Anne M.; Michalak, Pawel; Weger-Lucarelli, James",Cell,105,24

Natural SARS-COV-2 infection has been detected in dogs, cats and tigers. However, the symptoms in canines and felines were mild. The underlying mechanisms are unknown. Excessive activation of inflammasome pathways can trigger cytokine storm and severe damage to host. In current study, we performed a comparative genomics study of key components of inflammasome and pyroptosis pathways in dogs, cats and tigers. Cats and tigers do not have AIM2 and NLRP1. Dogs do not contain AIM2, and encode a short form of NLRC4. The activation sites in GSDMB were absent in dogs, cats and tigers, while GSDME activation sites in cats and tigers were abolished.

Such public attention will in turn reinforce tactics to control the outbreak. In classical epidemiological models, effects of such tactics can be incorporated in standard parameters of transmission, recovery, and mortality. Unfortunately, early in an outbreak those individual parameters may be poorly known, hence corresponding models can get lost in uncertainty. This makes it difficult to determine whether the disease is spreading exponentially or logistically, or along another path. Examining cases over time is also problematic, as a logistically growing infection that is leveling off appears exponential in early phases. Here we report on the most basic mechanistic, ecological model we can imagine, which can help distinguish growth that is and is not under control. This approach did a satisfactory job predicting the final outcome of the Ebola outbreak of 2014-15. The model's two parameters were computable in real time, well before the outcome was actually known. The first parameter is an intrinsic rate of increase in cumulative deaths or reported cases. The second parameter is related to the human social system and represents all tactics that combine to control the outbreak. That parameter is coupled to the number of cumulative deaths or cases. We examine the basic mechanisms operating in this model and show the predictions made during the Ebola outbreak. We also consider how this basic model is performing for the Covid-19 pandemic and highlight ecological models that align with popularly discussed concepts such as flatten-the-curve, exponential growth, and inflection points of curves.","Loberg, Shelby W; Lehman, Clarence",,105,16

We developed a strategy for overcoming this bias to obtain more plausible estimates of the true values of key epidemiological variables. We fit mechanistic Bayesian latent-variable SIR models to confirmed COVID-19 cases, deaths, and recoveries, for all regions (countries and US states) independently. Bayesian averaging over models, we find that the raw infection incidence rate underestimates the true rate by a factor, the case ascertainment ratio CAR(t) that depends upon region and time. At the regional onset of COVID-19, the predicted global median was 13 infections unreported for each case confirmed (CAR(t) = 0.07 C.I. (0.02, 0.4)). As the infection spread, the median CAR(t) rose to 9 unreported cases for every one diagnosed as of April 15, 2020 (CAR(t) = 0.1 C.I. (0.02, 0.5)). We also estimate that the median global initial reproduction number R(0) is 3.3 (C.I (1.5, 8.3)) and the total infection fatality rate near the onset is 0.17% (C.I. (0.05%, 0.9%)). However the time-dependent reproduction number R(t) and infection fatality rate as of April 15 were 1.2 (C.I. (0.6, 2.5)) and 0.8% (C.I. (0.2%,4%)), respectively. We find that there is great variability between country- and state-level values. Our estimates are consistent with recent serological estimates of cumulative infections for the state of New York, but inconsistent with claims that very large fractions of the population have already been infected in most other regions. For most regions, our estimates imply a great deal of uncertainty about the current state and trajectory of the epidemic.","Chow, Carson C.; Chang, Joshua C.; Gerkin, Richard C.; Vattikuti, Shashaank",medRxiv,105,26

Currently, there is no vaccine to prevent infection nor any approved drug for the treatment. The development of a new drug is time-consuming and cannot be relied on as a solution in combatting the immediate global challenge. In such a situation, the drug repurposing becomes an attractive solution to identify the potential of COVID-19 treatment by existing drugs, which are approved for other indications. Here, we review the potential use of rapamycin, an mTOR (Mammalian Target of Rapamycin) inhibitor that can be repurposed at low dosages for the treatment of COVID-19. Rapamycin inhibits protein synthesis, delays aging, reduces obesity in animal models, and inhibits activities or expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-2, IL-6 and, IL-10. Overall, the use of rapamycin can help to control viral particle synthesis, cytokine storms and contributes to fight the disease by its anti-aging and anti-obesity effects. Since, rapamycin targets the host factors and not viral machinery, it represents a potent candidate for the treatment of COVID-19 than antiviral drugs as its efficacy is less likely to be dampened with high mutation rate of viral RNA. Additionally, the inhibitory effect of rapamycin on cell proliferation may aid in reducing viral replication. Therefore, by drug repurposing, low dosages of rapamycin can be tested for the potential treatment of COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Husain, Amjad; Byrareddy, Siddappa N.",Chem Biol Interact,105,20

Conclusion Optimization of surgical services scheduling to increase the proportion of elective surgical cases started before 3 PM has the potential to decrease post-surgical LOS for adult patients undergoing Orthopedic or Neurosurgical procedures.","Cifarelli, Christopher P; McMichael, John P; Forman, Alex G; Mihm, Paul A; Cifarelli, Daniel T; Lee, Mark R; Marsh, Wallis",Cureus,105,9

Both inoculation routes resulted in the isolation of virus from the caudal small intestine. Viral replication, however, was only observed upon inoculation into the digestive tract in quantities of ≥ 103 TCID50. Replication remained limited to a few unidentified cells located in or underneath the epithelial layer at villus- or crypt-sites. Virus was excreted in the faeces for several days but infection of the respiratory tract occured rarely in the same pigs. The results of this study indicate that small changes in molecular structure between PRCV and transmissible gastroenteritis virus have resulted in important changes in host cell tropism.","Cox, E.; Pensaert, M.

We have developed an anchor primer (AP)-based assay to improve viral RNA stability by bioinformatics identification of RNase-binding site of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA and implementing AP dually targeting the N gene of SARS-CoV-2 RNA and RNase 1, 3, 6. The arbitrarily primed polymerase chain reaction (AP-PCR) improvement of viral RNA integrity was supported by (a) the AP increased resistance of the targeted gene (N gene) of SARS-CoV-2 RNA to RNase treatment; (b) the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by AP-PCR with lower cycle threshold values (−2.7 cycles) compared to two commercially available assays; (c) improvement of the viral RNA stability of the ORF gene upon targeting of the N gene and RNase. Furthermore, the improved sensitivity by AP-PCR was demonstrated by detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in 70–80% of sputum, nasal, pharyngeal swabs and feces and 36% (4/11) of urine of the confirmed cases (n = 252), 7% convalescent cases (n = 54) and none of 300 negative cases. Lastly, AP-PCR analysis of 306 confirmed and convalescent cases revealed prolonged presence of viral loading for >20 days after the first positive diagnosis. Thus, the AP dually targeting SARS-CoV-2 RNA and RNase improves molecular detection by preserving SARS-CoV-2 RNA integrity and reveals the prolonged viral loading associated with older age and male gender in COVID-19 patients.","Xu, Tao; Wang, Jingu; Hu, Bingjie; Zhang, Guosi; Zhou, Wu; Zheng, Meiqin; Shen, Bo; Sun, Baochang; Zhang, Yanjun; Chen, Yin; Yu, Jian; Liang, Min; Pan, Jingye; Chen, Chengshui; Chen, Haixiao; Jiang, Minghua; Xu, Liangde; Qu, Jia; Chen, Jiang-Fan",Brief Bioinform,105,16

Although the disease is asymptomatic in most cases, some patients develop life-threatening disease characterised by acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, multisystem organ failure (MSOF), extrapulmonary manifestations, thromboembolic disease and associated cytokine release syndrome. The rationale for applying therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) early in the course of fulminant COVID-19 is the suppression of thromboinflammation and amelioration of microangiopathy, thus preventing the ensuing MSOF. In the course of complicated critical illness due to COVID-19, immune dysregulation may be as important as viral replication itself. Moreover, the natural course of SARS-CoV-2 infection remains obscure, as re-infections and/or recurrently positive real-time PCR results have been reported. Although concerns still exist regarding its potential immunosuppressive effects and safety, TPE shows promise in the management of life-threatening COVID-19 as documented by various pilot studies, which remain to be confirmed by future randomised controlled trials. However, current data suggest that TPE could be an adjunctive rescue therapy in complex COVID-19 critical illness.","Memish, Ziad A.; Faqihi, Fahad; Alharthy, Abdulrahman; Alqahtani, Saleh A.; Karakitsos, Dimitrios",Int J Antimicrob Agents,105,28

METHODS: : Suspected and non-suspected cases of VOC B.1.1.7 were defined according to the VirSNiP assay, which detects N501Y and deletion H69-V70. For pre-screening, the Allplex™ and TaqPath assays were used. RESULTS: : One hundred and sixteen suspected and 113 non-suspected cases were included. In the suspected cases, the Allplex assay showed N-gene dropout, or delayed Ct values of 6.27±1.21 and 6.66±1.41 compared with those of the RdRP and S-gene target, respectively. Agreement between the Allplex and TaqPath assays was 100% when the RdRP and S-gene targets had Ct values <35. Agreement between the Allplex and VirSNiP assays was 100% with Ct value <30.

When CHWs have been trained to engage with patients, typically such trainings have been for short term grant funded projects, focusing on a specific health intervention and not for long term, ongoing engagement of CHWs employed in clinical settings. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first such effort to describe the development of a standards-based training curriculum for clinic-based CHWs using a novel conceptual framework. Methods: Our conceptual approach for curricular development has several innovative features including: (1) a foundational consultation process with CHW national experts to inform curricular development approach, process and content; (2) utilization of the CHW Consensus Project (C3 Project) to provide curricular standards and guide learning objectives; (3) integration of three key stakeholder group perspectives (patients, healthcare teams, and healthcare systems); (4) use of popular education principles, aiming to foster a collaborative learning process; (5) integration of adult learning principles which build on learners' experiences, culminating in a modified apprenticeship model and (6) collaboration with clinical partners throughout planning and development of the curriculum. Results: The resulting standards-based curriculum is comprised of 10 modules, which span three areas of focus: (1) Establishing a professional CHW identity and competencies; (2) Outlining the context, processes and key actors in health care settings with whom CHWs will engage; and (3) Identifying the main forces that shape health and health care outcomes of patients/families and communities. Discussion: We highlight four lessons from our curriculum development process that may help other such efforts. First, curricular development should utilize CHW standards, existing training materials, and community-focused principles to inform curricular content and learning outcomes. Second, curricula should support training delivery using experience-based, participatory approaches, consistent with adult education and popular education principles. Third, training development for clinical settings should also draw from clinical CHW experiences and input. Fourth, curricula should support training for key stakeholders and champions in clinical organizations to improve organizational readiness for integrating CHWs into healthcare teams and health systems. Our results contribute to growing research on effective CHW training methods for clinical settings.","George, Sheba; Silva, Lucero; Llamas, Myra; Ramos, Irma; Joe, Justin; Mendez, Juan; Salazar, Rosalva; Tehan, Jim; Vasquez, Tatiana; Nealy, Schetema; Balcazar, Hector",Front Public Health,105,28

The aim of this study was to evaluate how the pandemic influenced the emergency department and urgent surgical activity in a medium-size hospital in the province of Bergamo. Methods: In this retrospective observational study, we analyzed the number of admissions to the medical and surgical Emergency Room and their severity compared with those in the same period in previous years (2011-2019). Admission in the medical and surgical department and urgent surgical operation was also assessed. Results: From March 7th to April 5th, 2020, we observe a reduction in emergency department access (-53%) when compared with the corresponding period of previous years. The number of medical admissions was similar to the past years (+0.9%), we observed a drastic reduction of surgical patients (-82.5%). We experienced a significant increase in hospitalizations in the medical department (+359%) and a reduction of admission in the surgical department (- 71.2%). Conclusion: SARS-CoV2 disease has spread so suddenly and severely that it has stressed Italian health system, in particular the Lombard one. Our data show the rise of critical medical ER accesses and the significant expansion in hospitalisation in the medical department with the necessary hospital reorganisation to face COVID-19 emergency.

Although Chinese officials announced in December 2014 that the country would completely cease using organs harvested from prisoners, no regulatory adjustments or changes in China’s organ donation laws followed. As a result, the use of prisoner organs remains legal in China if consent is obtained. DISCUSSION: We have collected and analysed available evidence on human rights violations in the organ procurement practice in China. We demonstrate that the practice not only violates international ethics standards, it is also associated with a large scale neglect of fundamental human rights. This includes organ procurement without consent from prisoners or their families as well as procurement of organs from incompletely executed, still-living prisoners. The human rights critique of these practices will also address the specific situatedness of prisoners, often conditioned and traumatized by a cascade of human rights abuses in judicial structures. CONCLUSION: To end the unethical practice and the abuse associated with it, we suggest to inextricably bind the use of human organs procured in the Chinese transplant system to enacting Chinese legislation prohibiting the use of organs from executed prisoners and making explicit rules for law enforcement. Other than that, the international community must cease to abet the continuation of the present system by demanding an authoritative ban on the use of organs from executed Chinese prisoners.

Robinson, London, 2017). Research participants were supplied with a single scenario based in 2030, where—as a result of Artificial Intelligence technology implementation—employees were going to be displaced. Using Torbert’s (Organizational wisdom and executive courage, New Lexington Press, San Francisco, 1998) ‘first, second and third person’ research theory, participants were asked to independently review their thoughts, sense, and image of the future from a fixed mindset position (considered to be the worst case), then from a growth mindset perspective (best case), and then do the same collectively. Five key findings are outlined which support the principle that having a growth mindset is a key component of adaptive capacity and futures literacy. The five key findings conclude that AI adaptation processes need to include compassion and authenticity, embodiment, fundamental needs and motivations, mutual learning and considering what lies beyond the edges of the organisation (Bateson in Small arcs of larger circles: framing through other patterns, Triarchy Press, Axminster, 2018).","Farrow, Elissa",AI Soc,105,24

Although the vaccine is free, rollout might still be compromised by hesitancy or concerns about COVID-19 vaccines. METHODS: We conducted two online surveys of Australian adults in April (during national lockdown; convenience cross-sectional sample) and November (virtually no cases of COVID-19; nationally representative sample) 2020, prior to vaccine rollout. We asked about intentions to have a potential COVID-19 vaccine (If a COVID-19 vaccine becomes available, I will get it) and free-text responses (November only). RESULTS: After adjustment for differences in sample demographics, the estimated proportion agreeing to a COVID-19 vaccine if it became available in April (n=1146) was 76.3%. In November (n=1941) this was estimated at 71.5% of the sample; additional analyses identified that the variation was driven by differences in perceived public health threat between April and November. Across both surveys, female gender, being younger, having inadequate health literacy and lower education were associated with reluctance to be vaccinated against COVID-19. Lower perceived susceptibility to COVID-19, belief that data on the efficacy of vaccines is ‘largely made up’, having lower confidence in government, and lower perception of COVID-19 as a public health threat, were also associated with reluctance to be vaccinated against COVID-19. The top three reasons for agreeing to vaccinate (November only) were to protect myself and others, moral responsibility, and having no reason not to get it. For those who were indifferent or disagreeing to vaccinate, safety concerns were the top reason, followed by indecision and lack of trust in the vaccine respectively. CONCLUSIONS: These findings highlight some factors related to willingness to accept a COVID-19 vaccine prior to one being available in Australia. Now that the vaccine is being offered, this study identifies key issues that can inform public health messaging to address vaccine hesitancy.","Dodd, Rachael H; Pickles, Kristen; Cvejic, Erin; Cornell, Samuel; MJ Isautier, Jennifer; Copp, Tessa; Nickel, Brooke; Bonner, Carissa; Batcup, Carys; Muscat, Danielle M; Ayre, Julie; McCaffery, Kirsten J",Vaccine,105,20

In the simulation we also take into account the stochastic character of the individuals in a finite population and given densities of people. On the other hand, we include in the simulation the appropriate statistical distributions for the parameters characterizing this disease. An important outcome of our work, apart of the produced epidemic curves, is the methodology of determination of the effective reproductive number during the main part of the new daily cases of the epidemic. Because this quantity constitutes a fundamental parameter of the SIR-based epidemic models, we also studied how it is affected by small variations of the incubation time and the crucial distance distributions, and furthermore, by the degree of quarantine measures.

The quadruplex definitions of the algorithm were optimized for 2019-nCoV. Using a lax quadruplex definition ruleset, which accepts amongst other parameters two residue G- and C-tracks, hundreds of potential quadruplex candidates were discovered. These sequences were evaluated by their in vitro formation probability, their position in the viral RNA, their uniqueness and their conservation rates (calculated in over three thousand different COVID-19 clinical cases and sequenced at different times and locations during the ongoing pandemic). These results were compared sequentially to other Coronaviridae members, other Group IV (+)ssRNA viruses and the entire realm. Sequences found in common with other species were further analyzed and characterized. Sequences with high scores unique to the 2019-nCoV were studied to investigate the variations amongst similar species. Quadruplex formation of the best candidates was then confirmed experimentally.

This combined, cost-effective test can be performed in 384-well plates with detection sensitivity suitable for clinical reporting, and will aid in future sample pooling efforts, thus improving throughput of SARS-CoV-2 detection.","Stahl, Elizabeth C.; Tsuchida, Connor A.; Hamilton, Jennifer R.; Lin-Shiao, Enrique; McDevitt, Shana L.; Moehle, Erica A.; Witkowsky, Lea B.; Tsui, C.

This study evaluated the association between the detection of multiple viruses by RT‐PCR and disease severity in children with bronchiolitis. METHODS: Children less than 2 years of age with clinical symptoms of bronchiolitis were prospectively included during three winter seasons. Patients were categorized in three groups based on disease severity; mild (no supportive treatment), moderate (supplemental oxygen and/or nasogastric feeding), and severe (mechanical ventilation). Multiplex RT‐PCR of 15 respiratory viruses was performed on nasopharyngeal aspirates. RESULTS: In total, 142 samples were obtained. Respiratory Syncytial virus (RSV) was the most commonly detected virus (73%) followed by rhinovirus (RV) (30%). In 58 samples (41%) more than one virus was detected, of which 41% was a dual infection with RSV and RV. In RSV infected children younger than 3 months, disease severity was not associated with the number of detected viruses. Remarkably, in children older than 3 months we found an association between more severe disease and RSV mono‐infections. CONCLUSION: Disease severity in children with bronchiolitis is not associated with infection by multiple viruses. We conclude that other factors, such as age, contribute to disease severity to a larger extent. Pediatr Pulmonol. 2012; 47:393–400. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Brand, H.

The measures were widely believed to increase women’s risk of violent victimization, most of which is by an intimate partner. We examined help-seeking during this period in a large U.S. city and used an interrupted time series analysis to assess the effects of three government interventions on domestic violence and sexual assault hotline calls and on “911” calls regarding domestic violence, assault, and rape. Declaration of an emergency appeared to reduce victim calls to the rape crisis hotline and the few “911” calls about rape. School closure was associated with a reduction in “911” calls about assault and rape and victim calls to the domestic violence hotline. Implementation of stay-at-home orders was associated with a gradual increase in domestic violence hotline calls. Although “911” calls regarding assault fell by nearly half, calls to police for domestic violence were unchanged. In sum, there was a decrease in help-seeking for sexual assault and assault in general but not for domestic violence during the initial phases of the COVID-19 outbreak. The analysis underscores the importance of distinguishing between the violence itself, calls to police, and calls to helplines when claims are made about changes over time in violence against women. The opportunities and constraints for each can differ widely under usual circumstances, circumstances that were altered by public health interventions related to the pandemic.","Sorenson, Susan B.; Sinko, Laura; Berk, Richard A.",J Interpers Violence,105,1

BACKGROUND: There is much discussion and concern about the COVID-19 pandemic impact on nurses' health and the nursing workforce. METHODS: More than 5000 nurses from a national sample participated in a cross-sectional, descriptive study. Participants rated their perceptions of the pandemic impact on their practice and their intent to leave their position and profession. RESULTS: Pandemic impact was rated high overall and was highest in nurses with 25+ years of experience and in managers/directors. Eleven percent of the total sample indicated they intended to leave their position, and 20% were undecided. Nurses who rated pandemic impact at the highest level had higher intent to leave their position. Of the respondents, less than 2% indicated they were leaving the nursing profession, whereas 8% were undecided. CONCLUSIONS: This is the 1st quantitative report of perceived level of pandemic impact on direct care nurses and nurse managers/directors at the time of this writing. The combination of those who intend to leave and those who are uncertain about leaving their positions could cause instability in the workforce if not reversed.

Methods that do not explicitly account for disease prevalence and uncertainty therein can lead to significant classification errors. We present a novel method that leverages optimal decision theory to address this problem. As a preliminary step, we develop an analysis that uses an assumed prevalence and conditional probability models of diagnostic measurement outcomes to define optimal (in the sense of minimizing rates of false positives and false negatives) classification domains. Critically, we demonstrate how this strategy can be generalized to a setting in which the prevalence is unknown by either (i) defining a third class of hold-out samples that require further testing or (ii) using an adaptive algorithm to estimate prevalence prior to defining classification domains. We also provide examples for a recently published SARS-CoV-2 serology test and discuss how measurement uncertainty (e.g. associated with instrumentation) can be incorporated into the analysis. We find that our new strategy decreases classification error by up to a decade relative to more traditional methods based on confidence intervals. Moreover, it establishes a theoretical foundation for generalizing techniques such as receiver operating characteristics by connecting them to the broader field of optimization.","Patrone, Paul N; Kearsley, Anthony J",Math Med Biol,105,20

Uveitis is common in these cats. It was the aim of this study to evaluate sensitivity and specificity of an immunocytochemical assay (ICC) in aqueous humor of cats suspected of having FIP. ANIMALS STUDIED: The study included 26 cats with immunohistochemically confirmed FIP and 12 control cats for which FIP was suspected due to similar clinical or laboratory changes, but which suffered from other diseases confirmed via histopathology. PROCEDURES: All aqueous humor samples were collected postmortem by paracentesis. ICC was carried out as avidin–biotin complex method. Sensitivity, specificity, and the overall accuracy including 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated. RESULTS: Immunocytochemistry was positive in 16 of 25 cats with FIP and 2 of 11 control cats (one cat with lymphoma, one with pulmonary adenocarcinoma). Aqueous humor samples of one cat with FIP and of one control cat were excluded from statistical analysis. Sensitivity was 64.0% (95% CI: 42.5–82.0); specificity 81.8% (95% CI: 48.2–97.7); and overall accuracy 69.4% (95% CI: 51.9–83.7). CONCLUSIONS: As false‐positive results occurred and specificity is most important in the diagnosis of FIP, the diagnostic utility of ICC in aqueous humor is limited. Further studies are required to clarify the origin of false‐positive ICC results.","Felten, Sandra; Matiasek, Kaspar; Gruendl, Stefanie; Sangl, Laura; Hartmann, Katrin",Vet Ophthalmol,105,1

Two general types of RNA granules are conserved from yeast to mammals: stress granules (SGs), which contain many translation initiation factors, and processing bodies (P-bodies, PBs), which are enriched for proteins involved in RNA turnover. Because of the inverse relationship between appearance of RNA granules and persistence of translation, many viruses must subvert RNA granule function for replicative purposes. Here we discuss the viruses and mechanisms that manipulate stress granules and P-bodies to promote synthesis of viral proteins. Several themes have emerged for manipulation of RNA granules by viruses: (1) disruption of RNA granules at the mid-phase of infection, (2) prevention of RNA granule assembly throughout infection and (3) co-opting of RNA granule proteins for new or parallel roles in viral reproduction. Viruses must employ one or multiple of these routes for a robust and productive infection to occur. The possible role for RNA granules in promoting innate immune responses poses an additional reason why viruses must counteract the effects of RNA granules for efficient replication.","Reineke, Lucas C.; Lloyd, Richard E.",Virology,105,24

Beyond frailty, social vulnerability to environmental stressors, such as the social distancing enforced to reduce the SARS-CoV2 contagion, can modify long-term disease risk and induce health status changes in the general population. We assessed frailty and social vulnerability indices in 1,258 Italian residents during the first lockdown phase via an on-line survey. We compared indices taking into account age categories and gender. While frailty showed a linear increase with age and was greater in females than in males, social vulnerability was higher in young adults and elders compared to middle aged and older adults, and in males than females. Both frailty and social vulnerability contributed in explaining the individual perception of the impact of Covid-19 emergency on health, which was further influenced by proactive attitudes/behaviors and social isolation. Social isolation and loneliness following the Covid-19 outbreak may exert dramatic psychosocial effects in the general population. The early detection of vulnerable categories, at risk to become ill and develop long-lasting health status changes, would help to prevent consequences on general well-being by allocating resources to targeted interventions managing psychosocial distress and increasing young adults and elderly resilience toward the post-Covid-19 crisis.","Cerami, Chiara; Canevelli, Marco; Santi, Gaia Chiara; Galandra, Caterina; Dodich, Alessandra; Cappa, Stefano F.; Vecchi, Tomaso; Crespi, Chiara",Front Psychiatry,105,0

Africa is still early in this epidemic, therefore the extent of disease severity is not yet clear. We used a mathematical model to fit to the observed cases of COVID-19 in South Africa to estimate the basic reproductive number and critical vaccination coverage to control the disease for different hypothetical vaccine efficacy scenarios. We also estimated the percentage reduction in effective contacts due to the social distancing measures implemented. Early model estimates show that COVID-19 outbreak in South Africa had a basic reproductive number of 2.95 (95% credible interval [CrI] 2.83–3.33). A vaccine with 70% efficacy had the capacity to contain COVID-19 outbreak but at very higher vaccination coverage 94.44% (95% Crl 92.44–99.92%) with a vaccine of 100% efficacy requiring 66.10% (95% Crl 64.72–69.95%) coverage. Social distancing measures put in place have so far reduced the number of social contacts by 80.31% (95% Crl 79.76–80.85%).

Relative to 2019, the peak PM(2.5) concentrations on July 4th and 5th 2020 were, on average, over 50% higher in California, likely due to the COVID-19-related increase in the use of household-level fireworks. This increase was most pronounced in southern counties, which tend to have less strict firework-related regulations and a greater use of illegal fireworks. Los Angeles County experienced the highest July 4th daily PM(2.5) levels both in 2019 (29.9 µg·m(−3)) and 2020 (42.6 µg·m(−3)). Spatial hot spot analyses generally showed these southern counties (e.g., Los Angeles County) to be regional air pollution hotspots, whereas the opposite pattern was seen in the north (e.g., San Francisco). The results also showed PM(2.5) peaks that were over two-times higher among communities with lower SES, higher minority group populations, and higher asthma rates. Our findings highlight the important role that policy and enforcement can play in reducing firework-related air pollution and protecting public health, as exemplified by southern California, where policy was more relaxed and air pollution was higher (especially in 2020 when the 4th of July coincided with the COVID-19-lockdown period), and in disadvantaged communities where disparities were greatest.","Mousavi, Amirhosein; Yuan, Yiting; Masri, Shahir; Barta, Greg; Wu, Jun",Int J Environ Res Public Health,105,10
641099,641099,641099,Molecular Mechanism of Parosmia,12.061195,7.360543,2021-02-08,"BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 virus is largely transmitted via respiratory droplets and the highest transmission risks arise when undertaking aerosol generating procedures like laparoscopy. Most national societies had advised the urgent suspension of elective surgery with the focus shifting to emergency and cancer surgery only during this pandemic. However very little is known regarding the risks to the health care professionals undertaking emergency laparoscopic procedures. AIMS AND OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate safety at laparoscopy by modifying the technique for safe management of patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN AND SETTING: This is an observational cohort study. This study was done at a tertiary care reference hospital for minimal access gynaecological surgery. Safety of 42 semi-urgent and emergency laparoscopic surgeries in patients was evaluated for a period of 5 months after taking informed written consent of patients to participate in the study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Use of double closed circuit laparoscopic suction evacuation and filtration systems with closed circuit anaesthesia with specialized Heat and Moisture Exchangers (HME) bacterial & viral (BV) filters to make laparoscopic surgery safe. RESULTS: 57.14% of the patients were 41 years or more. 47.6% presented either with menorrhagia, irregular vaginal bleeding or post-menopausal vaginal bleeding and 26.19 % patients were keen to conceive. In 50% patients, surgery was done in 60 minutes or less. Post-operatively, none of the patients had any complications and all were followed up for 14 days for COVID-19 infection. No staff, doctors or anaesthetist were detected COVID-19 positive during the follow up period. The limitation of the study was, that it was an observational study done in COVID-19 negative patients only. CONCLUSIONS: Safety at laparoscopy can be maintained when it is performed by an experienced surgeon who has full knowledge of safe laparoscopic techniques and performs it in the shortest time possible and with all due precautions.","Trivedi, Prakash Harikant; Trivedi, Soumil Prakash; Ghadge, Nilesh Maruti; Bajani, Dinesh Popatlal; Trivedi, Aditi Soumil",J Hum Reprod Sci,105,10

The present study aimed to determine socioeconomic inequality in the burden of 25 groups of diseases between countries around the world in 2019. METHODS: In the current study data according to 204 countries in the world was gathered from the Human Development Report and the Global Burden of Diseases study. Variables referring to incidence, prevalence, years of life lost (YLL), years lived with disability (YLD) and disability adjusted life years (DALY) resulting by 25 groups of diseases and injuries also human development index was applied for the analysis. For measurement of socioeconomic inequality, concentration index (CI) and curve was applied. CI is considered as one of the popular measures for inequality measurement. It ranges from − 1 to + 1. A positive value implies that a variable is concentrated among the higher socioeconomic status population and vice versa. RESULTS: The findings showed that CI of the incidence, prevalence, YLL, YLD and DALY for all causes were − 0.0255, − 0.0035, − 0.1773, 0.0718 and − 0.0973, respectively. CI for total Communicable, Maternal, Neonatal, and Nutritional Diseases (CMNNDs) incidence, prevalence, YLL, YLD and DALY were estimated as − 0.0495, − 0.1355, − 0.5585, − 0.2801 and − 0.5203, respectively. Moreover, estimates indicated that CIs of incidence, prevalence, YLL, YLD and DALY for Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs) were 0.1488, 0.1218, 0.1552, 0.1847 and 0.1669, respectively. Regarding injuries, the CIs of incidence, prevalence, YLL, YLD and DALY were determined as 0.0212, 0.1364, − 0.1605, 0.1146 and 0.3316, respectively. In the CMNNDs group, highest and lowest CI of DALY were related to the respiratory infections and tuberculosis (− 0.4291) and neglected tropical diseases and malaria (− 0.6872). Regarding NCDs, the highest and lowest CI for DALY is determined for neoplasms (0.3192) and other NCDs (− 0.0784). Moreover, the maximum and minimum of CI of DALY for injuries group were related to the transport injuries (0.0421) and unintentional injuries (− 0.0297). CONCLUSIONS: The distribution of all-causes and CMNNDs burden were more concentrated in low-HDI countries and there are pro-poor inequality. However, there is a pro-rich inequality for NCDs’ burden i.e. it was concentrated in high-HDI countries. On the other hand, the concentration of DALY, YLD, prevalence, and incidence in injuries was observed in the countries with higher HDI, while YLL was concentrated in low-HDI countries.","Emadi, Mehrnoosh; Delavari, Sajad; Bayati, Mohsen",BMC Public Health,105,1

In this study, PEGylated micelles were designed and both micelles and Levofloxacin were radiolabeled with (99m)TcO(4)(-) to develop potential radiotracers for detection of infection/inflammation. Radiolabeling efficiency, in vitro stability and bacterial binding of (99m)Tc-Levofloxacin and (99m)Tc-micelles were compared. The aim of this study is to formulate and compare (99m)Tc-Levofloxacin and (99m)Tc-micelles as infection and inflammation agents having different mechanisms for the accumulation at infection and inflammation site. PEGylated micelles were designed with a particle size of 80 ± 0.7 nm and proper characterization properties. High radiolabeling efficiency was achieved for (99m)Tc-Levofloxacin (96%) and (99m)Tc-micelles (87%). The radiolabeling efficiency was remained stable with some insignificant alterations for both radiotracers at 25 °C for 24 h. Although in vitro bacterial binding of (99m)Tc-levofloxacine was higher than (99m)Tc-micelles, (99m)Tc-micelles may also be evaluated potential agent due to long circulation and passive accumulation mechanisms at infection/inflammation site. Both radiopharmaceutical agents exhibit potential results in design, characterization, radiolabeling efficiency and in vitro bacterial binding point of view.","Silindir-Gunay, Mine; Ozer, Asuman Yekta",J Drug Deliv Sci Technol,105,24

METHODS: All orthopedic consults and surgeries at an urban level 1 trauma center from 3/22/20-4/30/2020 were retrospectively reviewed (the social distancing period). Data from the same dates in 2019 were reviewed for comparison. Age, gender, Score for Trauma Triage in the Geriatric and Middle Aged (STTGMA) score and injury type were queried. Operating room data collected included: type of surgery performed, inpatient or outpatient status, and if the cases were categorized as elective, trauma or infectious cases. RESULTS: Compared to 2019, there was a 48.3% decrease in consult volume in 2020. The 2020 population was significantly older (44.0 vs 52.6 years-old, p = 0.001) and more male (65% vs 35%, p = 0.021). There were 23 COVID positive patients, 10 of which died within the collection period. Consult distribution dramatically changed, with decreases in ankle fractures, distal radius fractures and proximal humerus fractures of 76.5%, 77.4% and 55.0%, respectively. However, there was no significant difference in volume of hip, tibial shaft and femoral shaft fractures (p > 0.05). In 2020, there was a 41.4% decrease in operating room volume, no elective cases were performed, and cases were primarily trauma related. CONCLUSIONS: During a period of pandemic and social distancing, the overall volume of orthopedic consults and surgeries significantly declined. However, hip fracture volume remained unchanged. Patients presenting with orthopedic injuries were older, and at higher risk for inpatient mortality.","Haskel, Jonathan D.; Lin, Charles C.; Kaplan, Daniel J.; Dankert, John F.; Merkow, David; Crespo, Alexander; Behery, Omar; Ganta, Abhishek; Konda, Sanjit R.",Geriatr Orthop Surg Rehabil,105,3

This study aimed to investigate the value of chest CT radiomics for diagnosing COVID-19 pneumonia compared with clinical model and COVID-19 reporting and data system (CO-RADS), and develop an open-source diagnostic tool with the constructed radiomics model. METHODS: This study enrolled 115 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and 435 non-COVID-19 pneumonia patients (training dataset, n = 379; validation dataset, n = 131; testing dataset, n = 40). Key radiomics features extracted from chest CT images were selected to build a radiomics signature using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression. Clinical and clinico-radiomics combined models were constructed. The combined model was further validated in the viral pneumonia cohort, and compared with performance of two radiologists using CO-RADS. The diagnostic performance was assessed by receiver operating characteristics curve (ROC) analysis, calibration curve, and decision curve analysis (DCA). RESULTS: Eight radiomics features and 5 clinical variables were selected to construct the combined radiomics model, which outperformed the clinical model in diagnosing COVID-19 pneumonia with an area under the ROC (AUC) of 0.98 and good calibration in the validation cohort. The combined model also performed better in distinguishing COVID-19 from other viral pneumonia with an AUC of 0.93 compared with 0.75 (P = 0.03) for clinical model, and 0.69 (P = 0.008) or 0.82 (P = 0.15) for two trained radiologists using CO-RADS. The sensitivity and specificity of the combined model can be achieved to 0.85 and 0.90. The DCA confirmed the clinical utility of the combined model. An easy-to-use open-source diagnostic tool was developed using the combined model. CONCLUSIONS: The combined radiomics model outperformed clinical model and CO-RADS for diagnosing COVID-19 pneumonia, which can facilitate more rapid and accurate detection.","Liu, Huanhuan; Ren, Hua; Wu, Zengbin; Xu, He; Zhang, Shuhai; Li, Jinning; Hou, Liang; Chi, Runmin; Zheng, Hui; Chen, Yanhong; Duan, Shaofeng; Li, Huimin; Xie, Zongyu; Wang, Dengbin",J Transl Med,105,15

Methods: Demographics, clinical characteristics, and laboratory tests data from 726 patients with serious COVID-19 at Tongji Hospital (Wuhan, China) were analyzed. Patients were classified into critical group (n = 174) and severe group (n= 552), the critical group was sub-divided into survivors (n = 47) and non-survivors (n = 127). Results: Multivariable analyses revealed the risk factors associated with critical illness in serious patients were: Advanced age, high respiratory rate (RR), high lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level, high hypersensitive cardiac troponin I (hs-cTnI) level, and thrombocytopenia on admission. High hs-cTnI level was the independent risk factor of mortality among critically ill patients in the unadjusted and adjusted models. ROC curves demonstrated that hs-cTnI and LDH were predictive factors for critical illness in patients with serious COVID-19 whereas procalcitonin and D-Dimer with hs-cTnI and LDH were predictive parameters in mortality risk. Conclusions: Advanced age, high RR, LDH, hs-cTnI, and thrombocytopenia, constitute risk factors for critical illness among patients with serious COVID-19, and the hs-cTnI level helps predict fatal outcomes in critically ill patients.","Chen, Huilong; Li, Xinjie; Marmar, Tuohutaerbieke; Xu, Qiang; Tu, Jing; Li, Tong; Han, Jun; Xu, Dong; Shen, Tao",Int J Med Sci,105,1

We validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach by studying the disease outbreak in Qatar and the proposed model prediction from December 1st until December 31st, 2020. The quantitative evaluation shows that the proposed technique outperforms state-of-art forecasting approaches.","Said, Ahmed Ben; Erradi, Abdelkarim; Aly, Hussein Ahmed; Mohamed, Abdelmonem",Environ Sci Pollut Res Int,105,2

There is a physiological rationale for the use of Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP), and CPAP could keep some patients off mechanical ventilation. We aimed to examine the physiological response to CPAP and the outcome of this treatment. Methods: Data from all patients admitted with COVID-19 and treated with CPAP, from March to July 2020 were collected retrospectively. CPAP was initiated on a medical ward when oxygen supplementation exceeded 10 liters/min to maintain oxygen saturation (SpO(2)) ≥92%. CPAP was administered with full face masks on a continuous basis until stable improvement in oxygenation or until intubation or death. Results: CPAP was initiated in 53 patients (35 men, 18 women) with a median (IQR) age of 68 (57–78) years. Nine patients were not able to tolerate the CPAP treatment. Median duration for the 44 patients receiving CPAP was 3 (2–6) days. The PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio was severely reduced to an average of 101 mmHg at initiation of treatment. A positive response of CPAP was seen on respiratory rate (p = 0.002) and on oxygenation (p < 0.001). Of the 44 patients receiving CPAP, 12 (27%) avoided intubation,13 (29%) were intubated, and 19 (43%) died. Of the patients with a ceiling of treatment in the ward (26 of 53) only 2 survived. Older age and high initial oxygen demand predicted treatment failure. Discussion: CPAP seems to have positive effect on oxygenation and respiratory rate in most patients with severe respiratory failure caused by COVID-19. Treatment with CPAP to severely hypoxemic patients in a medical ward is possible, but the prognosis for especially elderly patients with high oxygen requirement and with a ceiling of treatment in the ward is poor.","Kofod, Linette Marie; Nielsen Jeschke, Klaus; Kristensen, Morten Tange; Krogh-Madsen, Rikke; Monefeldt Albek, Carsten; Hansen, Ejvind Frausing",European clinical respiratory journal,105,8

Our objectives are to assess the case fatality risk (CFR) among COVID-19 patients detected in mainland China, stratified by clinical category and age group. Method We collected individual information on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases from publicly available official sources from December 29, 2019 to February 23, 2020. We explored the risk factors associated with mortality. We used methods accounting for right-censoring and survival analyses to estimate the CFR among detected cases. Results Of 12,863 cases reported outside Hubei, we obtained individual records for 9,651 cases, including 62 deaths and 1,449 discharged cases. The deceased were significantly older than discharged cases (median age: 77 vs 39 years, p<0.001). 58% (36/62) were male. Older age (OR 1.18 per year; 95%CI: 1.14 to 1.22), being male (OR 2.02; 95%CI: 1.02 to 4.03), and being treated in less developed economic regions (e.g., West and Northeast vs. East, OR 3.93; 95%CI: 1.74 to 8.85) were mortality risk factors. The estimated CFR was 0.89-1.24% among all cases. The fatality risk among critical patients was 2-fold higher than that among severe and critical patients, and 24-fold higher than that among moderate, severe and critical patients. Conclusions Our estimates of CFR based on laboratory-confirmed cases ascertained outside of Hubei suggest that COVID-19 is not as severe as severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome, but more similar to the mortality risk of 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic in hospitalized patients. The fatality risk of COVID-19 is higher in males and increases with age. Our study improves the severity assessment of the ongoing epidemic and can inform the COVID-19 outbreak response in China and beyond.","Deng, Xiaowei; Yang, Juan; Wang, Wei; Wang, Xiling; Zhou, Jiaxin; Chen, Zhiyuan; Li, Jing; Chen, Yinzi; Yan, Han; Zhang, Juanjuan; Zhang, Yongli; Wang, Yan; Qiu, Qi; Gong, Hui; Wei, Xianglin; Wang, Lili; Sun, Kaiyuan; Wu, Peng; Ajelli, Marco; Cowling, Benjamin J.; Viboud, Cecile; Yu, Hongjie",medRxiv : the preprint server for health sciences,105,16

Here, we investigate how trans-regulatory mutations are distributed within the genome and within a gene regulatory network by identifying and characterizing 69 mutations with trans-regulatory effects on expression of the same focal gene in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Relative to 1766 mutations without effects on expression of this focal gene, we found that these trans-regulatory mutations were enriched in coding sequences of transcription factors previously predicted to regulate expression of the focal gene. However, over 90% of the trans-regulatory mutations identified mapped to other types of genes involved in diverse biological processes including chromatin state, metabolism, and signal transduction. These data show how genetic changes in diverse types of genes can impact a gene’s expression in trans, revealing properties of trans-regulatory mutations that provide the raw material for trans-regulatory variation segregating within natural populations.","Duveau, Fabien; Vande Zande, Petra; Metzger, Brian PH; Diaz, Crisandra J; Walker, Elizabeth A; Tryban, Stephen; Siddiq, Mohammad A; Yang, Bing; Wittkopp, Patricia J",eLife,105,0

To maximize the success probability of future anti-viral vaccines, the anti-viral vaccines successful in the past are summarized here by virus type and vaccine type. The primary focus is on viruses with both single-stranded RNA genomes and a membrane envelope, given the pandemic past of influenza viruses and coronaviruses. The following conclusion is reached, assuming that success of future strategies is positively correlated with strategies successful in the past. The primary strategy, especially for emerging pandemic viruses, should be development of vaccine antigens that are live-attenuated viruses; the secondary strategy should be development of vaccine antigens that are inactivated virus particles. Support for this conclusion comes from the complexity of immune systems. These conclusions imply the need for a revision in current strategic planning.","Serwer, Philip",Vaccines (Basel),105,16

Some chronic diseases may also affect individuals’ susceptibility to infectious diseases. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association of the host genetic factors mostly involved in inflammation, as well as hypercholesterolemia and diabetes with mild flu in an Iranian population. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, nasopharyngeal swab samples were collected from 93 patients referred to primary care centers of Markazi, Semnan, and Zanjan provinces (central Iran) due to flu-like symptoms between March 2015 and December 2018. Of these, PCR test identified 49 influenza A/H1N1 and 44 flu-negative individuals. Twelve single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in RPAIN, FCGR2A, MBL-2, CD55, C1QBP, IL-10, TNF-α and an unknown gene were genotyped using iPLEX GOLD SNP genotyping analysis. Hypercholesterolemia and diabetes status was determined based on the physician diagnosis. Association of the host genetic variants, hypercholesterolemia and diabetes with mild A/H1N1 flu was assessed with univariable and multivariable logistic regression analysis as implemented in Stata software (v.14). Statistical tests were considered as significant at 0.05 levels. RESULTS: Frequency of diabetes and hypercholesterolemia, as well as participants mean age was significantly higher in the flu-negative rather than the flu-positive group. Of 12 SNPs, nine did not show any significant association with mild flu in our study (rs1801274, rs1800451, rs2564978, rs361525, rs1800450, rs1800871, rs1800872, rs1800896, rs1800629). Possessing G vs. A allele in two SNPs (rs3786054 and rs8070740) was associated with a threefold increase in the chance of mild flu when compared to flu-negative patients (95% CI: 1.1, 22.0). Possessing C allele (vs. A) in the rs9856661 locus also increased the chance of mild flu up to 2 folds (95% CI: 1.0, 10.0). CONCLUSION: The results showed that possessing the G allele in either rs3786054 or rs8070740 loci in C1QBP and RPAIN genes, respectively, increased the risk of H1N1 infection up to 3.3 folds, regardless of the patient’s age, BMI, diabetes, and hypercholesterolemia. Complementary functional genomic studies would shed more light on the underlying mechanism of human immunity associated with these genetic markers. The identified genetic factors may have the same role in susceptibility to similar respiratory infections with RNA viruses, like SARS, MERS and COVID-19. Future genetic association studies targeting these RNA viruses, especially COVID-19 is recommended. Studies on other ethnic groups would also shed light on possible ethnic variations in genetic susceptibility to respiratory RNA viruses.

The frequency of these outbreaks, their mortality and associated disruption to normal life calls for concerted efforts to understand their occurrence and fate in different environments. There is an increased interest in the occurrence of coronaviruses in wastewater from the perspective of wastewater-based epidemiology. However, there is no comprehensive review of the knowledge on coronavirus occurrence, fate and potential transmission in wastewater. This paper, provides a review of the literature on the occurrence of coronaviruses in wastewater treatment processes. We discuss the presence of viral RNA in feces as a result of gastrointestinal infections resulting in diarrhoea. We also review the literature on their presence, survival and potential removal in common wastewater treatment processes. The detection of infectious viral particles in feces of patients raises questions on the potential risks of infection for people exposed to untreated sewage/wastewater. We, therefore, discuss the potential risk of infection with coronaviruses for workers in wastewater treatment plants and the public that may be exposed through faulty plumbing or burst sewer networks. The disruption of life and mortalities warrants a much more focused research on the role of environments, such as wastewater and surface water, in disease transmission. The current wealth of knowledge on coronaviruses in wastewater based on the reviewed literature is scant and therefore calls for further studies.","Dennis Amoah, Isaac; Kumari, Sheena; Bux, Faizal",Environ Int,105,16

We present a case of a patient with COVID-19 who developed severe ITP associated with fatal hemorrhage. CASE PRESENTATION: A 50-year-old-female with history of treated breast and renal cancers presented to the emergency department with cough and fever for 10 days. Nasopharyngeal swab was positive for SARS-CoV-2. The patient was administered supplemental oxygen and empiric broad spectrum antibiotics. Her respiratory status rapidly declined necessitating invasive mechanical ventilation and admission to the ICU on Day 1 for severe ARDS. IV Remdesivir, Dexamethasone 6 mg IV daily, convalescent plasma and IV unfractionated heparin infusion were administered. Platelets were 219 x 109/L, fibrinogen 980 and D-dimer level 11.2. On Day 18 platelets fell to < 2 x 109/L, without evidence of schistocytes on peripheral blood smear. Coagulation and liver function tests, and autoimmune disease markers were normal. Heparin was discontinued. Anti-platelet factor 4 heparin antibodies and platelet autoantibodies were not detected. ITP secondary to COVID-19 was considered and methylprednisolone 1 mg/kg IV and IV immune globulin (IVIG) daily for 5 days and platelet transfusions to keep platelets >5 x 109/L were administered with improvement in platelets to >150 x 109/L on Day 23. On Day 25, platelets decreased to < 2 x 109/L, with melena and leg petechiae requiring red cell and platelet transfusions. She was re-treated with IVIG for 5 days, dexamethasone 40 mg IV daily and Romiplostim 2mcg/kg subcutaneous weekly with rise in platelets to >150 x 109/L on Day 31. She remained ventilator dependent and underwent tracheostomy on Day 32. Platelet counts remained >200 x 109/L and Romiplostim was discontinued on Day 73. On Day 85, platelets again fell to < 5 x 109/L, associated with massive gastrointestinal hemorrhage and fatal hemorrhagic shock. DISCUSSION: We believe that severe ITP with multiple relapses associated with COVID-19 was the most likely cause of the significant drop in platelet count that caused significant bleeding and death in our patient. We also observed a delayed onset in the clinical presentation of ITP and symptomatic COVID, unlike previous reports. The initial episode of severe thrombocytopenia was responsive to glucocorticoids and IVIG and later required higher doses of steroids and Romiplostim but recurred upon discontinuation of therapy. Fatal hemorrhage due to COVID-19-associated ITP is rare. A review of 45 cases of ITP in COVID-19 patients reported the majority of cases (75%) occurring in moderate-to-severe COVID-19. Severe life-threatening bleeding was uncommon with one death attributed to intracranial hemorrhage. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians need to be aware of ITP as a severe complication of COVID-19 that should be diagnosed and treated promptly to avoid fatal bleeding complications, as was observed in our patient.

A case control study was conducted to investigate the potential role of breastfeeding in protecting children <1 year of age from VRI. Methods: Patients admitted for a respiratory tract infections routinely underwent a nasopharyngeal aspirate, which was tested with an RT-PCR for 14 respiratory viruses. Hospitalized infants positive for viruses were enrolled as cases; healthy controls were enrolled among patients admitted for ultrasound hip screening. The effect of breastfeeding on pertussis was investigated through multivariable analysis. Results: We enrolled a total of 496 patients: 238 cases and 258 healthy controls. Among cases, eighty-six patients (36.1%) had a rinovirus, 78 (32.8%) an RSV, 22 (9.2%) an adenovirus, and 37 (15.5%) a coinfections with multiple viruses. The number of households was significantly higher in cases (mean in cases 4.5; mean 3.7 in controls, p < 0.001) and the proportion of infants having siblings (79% in cases vs. 43% in controls, p < 0.001). Proportion of smoking mothers was higher in cases than in controls (21.4 vs. 10.1%, p = 0.001). Among cases 44.5% were exclusively breastfed at symptoms onset vs. 48.8% of healthy controls. According to the multivariable analysis, being exclusively breastfed at symptom onset was associated with a higher risk of viral respiratory infection (3.7; 95% CI 1.64–8.41), however a longer breastfeeding duration was protective (OR 0.98; 95% CI 0.97–0.99). Also having at least one sibling was associated to a higher risk (OR 3.6; 95% CI 2.14–5.92) as well as having a smoking mother (OR 2.6; 95% CI 1.33–4.89). Conclusions: Breastfeeding remains a mainstay of prevention for numerous diseases and its protective role increases with duration. However, being breastfed when mothers carry a respiratory infection may increase the risk of transmission, acting as a proxy for closer contacts. In future studies, potential confounding variables as pattern of contacts with other individuals, should be taken into account.","Pandolfi, Elisabetta; Gesualdo, Francesco; Rizzo, Caterina; Carloni, Emanuela; Villani, Alberto; Concato, Carlo; Linardos, Giulia; Russo, Luisa; Ferretti, Beatrice; Campagna, Ilaria; Tozzi, Alberto",Front Pediatr,105,23

The Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score has been used to predict the clinical outcomes of patients with multiple organ failure requiring intensive care. Therefore, we retrospectively analyzed the clinical characteristics, risk factors, and relationship between the SOFA score and the prognosis of COVID-19 patients. We retrospectively included all patients ≥18 years old who were diagnosed with COVID-19 in the laboratory continuously admitted to Jingzhou Central Hospital from January 16, 2020 to March 23, 2020. The demographic, clinical manifestations, complications, laboratory results, and clinical outcomes of patients infected with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 were collected and analyzed. Clinical variables were compared between patients with mild and severe COVID-19. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to identify the risk factors for severe COVID-19. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to analyze risk factors for hospital-related death. Survival analysis was performed by the Kaplan–Meier method, and survival differences were assessed by the log-rank test. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves of the SOFA score in different situations were drawn, and the area under the ROC curve was calculated. A total of 117 patients with confirmed diagnoses of COVID-19 were retrospectively analyzed, of which 108 patients were discharged and 9 patients died. The median age of the patients was 50.0 years old (interquartile range [IQR], 35.5–62.0). 63 patients had comorbidities, of which hypertension (27.4%) was the most frequent comorbidities, followed by diabetes (8.5%), stroke (4.3%), coronary heart disease (3.4%), and chronic liver disease (3.4%). The most common symptoms upon admission were fever (82.9%) and dry cough (70.1%). Regression analysis showed that high SOFA scores, advanced age, and hypertension were associated with severe COVID-19. The median SOFA score of all patients was 2 (IQR, 1–3). Patients with severe COVID-19 exhibited a significantly higher SOFA score than patients with mild COVID-19 (3 [IQR, 2–4] vs 1 [IQR, 0–1]; P < .001). The SOFA score can better identify severe COVID-19, with an odds ratio of 5.851 (95% CI: 3.044–11.245; P < .001). The area under the ROC curve (AUC) was used to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of the SOFA score in predicting severe COVID-19 (cutoff value = 2; AUC = 0.908 [95% CI: 0.857–0.960]; sensitivity: 85.20%; specificity: 80.40%) and the risk of death in COVID-19 patients (cutoff value = 5; AUC = 0.995 [95% CI: 0.985–1.000]; sensitivity: 100.00%; specificity: 95.40%). Regarding the 60-day mortality rates of patients in the 2 groups classified by the optimal cutoff value of the SOFA score (5), patients in the high SOFA score group (SOFA score ≥5) had a significantly greater risk of death than those in the low SOFA score group (SOFA score < 5). The SOFA score could be used to evaluate the severity and 60-day mortality of COVID-19. The SOFA score may be an independent risk factor for in-hospital death.","Yang, Zheng; Hu, Qinming; Huang, Fei; Xiong, Shouxin; Sun, Yi",Medicine (Baltimore),105,3

FeMV has been associated with chronic kidney disease of cats characterized by tubulointerstitial nephritis (TIN), although this aspect is still controversial and not demonstrated with certainty. To investigate FeMV prevalence and genomic characteristics, an epidemiological survey was conducted in a total number of 127 household cats originating from two Italian regions, Abruzzi and Emilia-Romagna. A total number of 69 cats originating from three feline colonies were also enrolled for the study. Correlation with TIN was investigated by employing a total number of 35 carcasses. Prevalence of FeMV RNA was higher in urine samples collected from cats of colonies (P = 31.8%, CI 95% 22.1–43.6) compared to household cats (P = 8.66%, CI 95% 4.9–14.9) and in young and middle-aged cats while prevalence of FeMV Abs was higher in old cats. Sequences obtained straight from infected biological samples, either partial or complete, cluster into two clades within FeMV genotype 1, distantly related to FeMV genotype 2. Immunohistochemistry analysis of kidney sections of FeMV RNA positive cats revealed immunoreactivity within epithelial cells of renal tubuli and inflammatory cells. However, statistically significant association between FeMV and renal damages, including TIN, was not demonstrated (p= 0.0695, Fisher exact test). By virus histochemistry performed with FeMV-negative feline tissues and a FeMV isolate, tropism for different cellular types such as inflammatory cells residing in blood vessels of kidney and brain, airway epithelial cells, alveolar macrophages and to a lesser extent, the central nervous system, was demonstrated. Additional studies are warranted in order to establish viral tropism and immune response during the early phases of infection and to disentangle the role of FeMV in co-infection processes.","De Luca, Eliana; Crisi, Paolo Emidio; Marcacci, Maurilia; Malatesta, Daniela; Di Sabatino, Daria; Cito, Francesca; D’Alterio, Nicola; Puglia, Ilaria; Berjaoui, Shadia; Colaianni, Maria Loredana; Tinelli, Antonella; Ripà, Paola; Vincifori, Giacomo; Di Teodoro, Giovanni; Dondi, Francesco; Savini, Giovanni; Boari, Andrea; Lorusso, Alessio",Vet Microbiol,105,21

Secondarily, the report highlights the importance of assessing cognitive and emotional health in patients with post–COVID syndrome. METHODS (CASE DESCRIPTION): A 37-year-old woman tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and developed mild COVID-19 disease but did not require supplemental oxygen or hospitalization. The patient experienced persistent symptoms including dyspnea, headaches, and cognitive fog. On day 62, she participated in an outpatient physical therapist evaluation that revealed deficits in exercise capacity, obtaining 50% of her age-predicted 6-minute walk distance (6MWD). She had minor reductions in muscle strength and cognitive function. Self-reported quality of life (QoL) was 50, and she scored above established cut-off scores for provisional diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). RESULTS: The patient participated in biweekly physical therapist sessions for 8 weeks, which included aerobic training, strengthening exercises, diaphragmatic breathing techniques, and mindfulness training. Metabolic equivalent for task (METS) levels increased with variability over the course of the program. The patient’s muscle strength, physical function, and exercise capacity improved. 6MWD increased by 199 m, equating to 80% of her age-predicted distance. QoL and PTSD scores did not improve. At evaluation after physical therapy, the patient was still experiencing migraines, dyspnea, fatigue, and cognitive dysfunction. CONCLUSION: This case report described the clinical presentation and physical therapist management of a person with post–COVID syndrome, a novel health condition for which little evidence exists to guide rehabilitation examination and interventions. Physical therapists should consider cognitive function and emotional health in their plan of care for patients with post–COVID syndromes. IMPACT: This case alerts physical therapists to post–COVID syndrome—which can include debilitating symptoms of decreased aerobic tolerance, anxiety, PTSD, and cognitive dysfunction—and to the role that therapists can play in assessing these symptoms and managing these patients.","Mayer, Kirby P; Steele, Angela K; Soper, Melissa K; Branton, Jill D; Lusby, Megan L; Kalema, Anna G; Dupont-Versteegden, Esther E; Montgomery, Ashley A",Phys Ther,105,1

In particular, stay-at-home orders and social distancing kept survivors in close proximity to their abusers and restricted access to resources and care. We aimed to understand and characterize the impact of the pandemic on delivery of IPV care in Boston. METHODS: We conducted individual interviews with providers of IPV care and support in the Greater Boston area, including healthcare workers, social workers, lawyers, advocates, and housing specialists, who continued to work during the COVID-19 pandemic. Using thematic analysis, we identified themes describing the challenges and opportunites providers faced in caring for survivors during the pandemic. RESULTS: Analysis of 18 interviews yielded four thematic domains, encompassing 18 themes and nine sub-themes. Thematic analysis revealed that the pandemic posed an increased threat to survivors of IPV by exacerbating external stressors and leading to heightened violence. On a system level, the pandemic led to widespread uncertainty, strained resources, amplified inequities, and loss of community. On an individual level, COVID-19 restrictions limited survivors’ abilities to access resources and to be safe, and amplified pre-existing inequities, such as limited technology access. Those who did not speak English or were immigrants experienced even more difficulty accessing resources due to language and/or cultural barriers. To address these challenges, providers utilized video and telephone interactions, and stressed the importance of creativity and cooperation across different sectors of care. CONCLUSIONS: While virtual care was essential in allowing providers to care for survivors, and also allowed for increased flexibility, it was not a panacea. Many survivors faced additional obstacles to care, such as language barriers, unequal access to technology, lack of childcare, and economic insecurity. Providers addressed these barriers by tailoring services and care modalities to an individual’s needs and circumstances. Going forward, some innovations of the pandemic period, such as virtual interactions and cooperation across care sectors, may be utilized in ways that attend to shifting survivor needs and access, thereby improving safe, equitable, and trauma-informed IPV care.

Little effort, however, has been made to study the risk of isolation patients acquiring secondary infections from contaminated air migrating into negatively pressurized isolation rooms from adjacent spaces. As a result, an actual hospital was used to observe the transport of aerosol from a nursing station and general patient room to a nearby airborne infectious isolation room (AIIR). Aerosols ≤3.0μm (viruses and most airborne bacteria) were found to be capable of migrating 14.5m from a general patient room to an AIIR anteroom entrance in <14minutes at concentrations 2-5 times greater than ambient (e.g. background). Concentrations of aerosols within the anteroom and isolation room, however, remained virtually unchanged from ambient levels, indicating the effectiveness of door position and (or) ventilation. In contrast, gravitational settling and surface deposition appeared to limit the migration of aerosols >3.0μm to the entrance of the general patient room (4.5m).","Mousavi, Ehsan S.; Grosskopf, Kevin R.",Energy Procedia,105,16

This study aimed to compare the effects of losartan and amlodipine in patients with primary HTN and COVID‐19. METHODS: In this randomised clinical trial, hospitalised patients with COVID‐19 and primary HTN were enrolled in the study. One arm received losartan, 25 mg, twice a day and the other arm received amlodipine, 5 mg per day for 2 weeks. The main outcomes were compare 30‐day mortality rate and length of hospital stay. RESULTS: The mean age of patients treated with losartan (N = 41) and amlodipine (N = 39) was 67.3 ± 14.8 and 60.1 ± 17.3 years, respectively (P value = .068).

Therefore, laboratory tests were carried out to examine the susceptibility of ten rice brands to rice weevil, Sitophilus oryzae L. (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), infestation under temperature and relative humidity of 25 ± 2 °C and 75 ± 5%, respectively. The specific objectives of the study were to identify some commercially available rice brands with resistance to S. oryzae, by determining whether brand difference influences insect body weight at emergence and whether infestation is related to brand palatability and appearance. The ten brands used for the study were royale stallion, Mama royale, parboiled rice, Mama gold, white rice, Super eagle, Indian rice, champion rice, Abakiliki rice and Mama Africa, and standard methods were used to achieve the objectives. The indices measured were F(1) progeny emergence, grain weight loss and frass accumulation. RESULTS: The results showed that Abakiliki rice was poor in both palatability and appearance, whereas Super eagle was the most palatable and white rice was visually excellent. The results further showed that no brand was resistant to infestation and damage by S. oryzae. Males that were bred on the different rice brands did not differ in weight at emergence, but the weight of females at emergence was influenced by brand difference, and this suggests that female insects are more sensitive to brand difference at weight gain. CONCLUSION: Palatability and appearance were important in the susceptibility of rice brands to S. oryzae. The proliferation of diverse genotypes of rice (branded) with enhanced resistance to S. oryzae should be strongly encouraged to reduce susceptibility and increase rice security.","Okpile, Chilee; Zakka, Usman; Nwosu, Luke Chinaru",Bull Natl Res Cent,105,20

Distancing directives are represented by rates of flow into these compartments, as well as by a reduction in contacts that lessens disease transmission. The dynamical behavior of this system is analyzed, under various different rate control strategies, and the sensitivity of the basic reproduction number to various parameters is studied. One of the striking features of this model is the existence of a critical implementation delay (CID) in issuing distancing mandates: while a delay of about two weeks does not have an appreciable effect on the peak number of infections, issuing mandates even slightly after this critical time results in a far greater incidence of infection. Thus, there is a nontrivial but tight “window of opportunity” for commencing social distancing in order to meet the capacity of healthcare resources. However, if one wants to also delay the timing of peak infections – so as to take advantage of potential new therapies and vaccines – action must be taken much faster than the CID. Different relaxation strategies are also simulated, with surprising results. Periodic relaxation policies suggest a schedule which may significantly inhibit peak infective load, but that this schedule is very sensitive to parameter values and the schedule’s frequency. Furthermore, we considered the impact of steadily reducing social distancing measures over time. We find that a too-sudden reopening of society may negate the progress achieved under initial distancing guidelines, but the negative effects can be mitigated if the relaxation strategy is carefully designed.","Gevertz, Jana L.; Greene, James M.; Sanchez-Tapia, Cynthia H.; Sontag, Eduardo D.",J Theor Biol,105,16

The treatment of critically ill COVID-19 patients without rationing may improve the outcome. We therefore analyzed ICU resources allocated to COVID-19 patients with respiratory failure and their outcomes. Methods: Retrospectively, we enrolled severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-positive patients with respiratory failure from 03/08/2020 to 04/08/2020 and followed until 05/28/2020 in the university hospital of Freiburg, Germany. Results: In the defined interval, 34 COVID-19 patients were admitted to the ICU with median age of 67±13 (31-86) years. Six of 34 (17.6%) were female. All patients suffered from moderate or severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), 91.2% of the patients were intubated and 23.5% required extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Proning was performed in 67.6%, renal replacement therapy (RRT) was required in 35.3%. Ninety-six percent required more than 20 nursing hours per day. Mean ICU stay was 21±19 (1-81) days.

Low-and-middle resource countries face even larger challenges, as their resources are stretched and often insufficient under normal circumstances. A village in the Papuan highlands of Indonesia; small, isolated, accessed only by small plane or trekking has experienced an outbreak typical of COVID-19. Methodology/Principal Findings This description was compiled from patient care records by lay healthcare workers in M20 (a pseudonym) during and after an outbreak and from medical doctors responding to online requests for help. We assume that, for reasons given, the outbreak that has been described was COVID-19. The dense social structure of the village resulted in a rapid infection of 90-95% of the population. Physical distancing and isolation measures were used, but probably implemented suboptimal and too late, and their effect on the illness course was unclear. The relatively young population, with a majority of women, probably influenced the impact of the epidemic, resulting in only two deaths so far. Conclusions/Significance This outbreak pattern of suspected SARS-CoV-2 in a village in the highlands of Papua (Indonesia) presents a unique report of the infection of an entire village population over five weeks. The age distribution, common in Papuan highland villages may have reduced case fatality rate (CFR) in this context and that might be the case in similar remote areas since survival to old age is already very limited and CFR among younger people is lower.","van Burg, E.; van Burg-Verhage, W.",,105,22

When presenting with severe respiratory complications, COVID-19 results in markedly high death rates, particularly among patients with comorbidities such as cancer. Motivated by the ongoing global health crisis, we leveraged a growing in-house cohort of pulmonary tissues from lung cancer patients to analyze, at high resolution, the expression of host proteins implicated in the entryway of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) into lung epithelial cells. Our results identify key pathways in lung pathobiology and inflammation that offer the potential to identify novel markers and therapeutic targets that can be repurposed for clinical management of COVID-19, particularly among lung cancer patients, a population that represents over half a million individuals in the United States alone. ABSTRACT: The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is the causative agent of the COVID-19 pandemic. Severely symptomatic COVID-19 is associated with lung inflammation, pneumonia, and respiratory failure, thereby raising concerns of elevated risk of COVID-19-associated mortality among lung cancer patients. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the major receptor for SARS-CoV-2 entry into lung cells. The single-cell expression landscape of ACE2 and other SARS-CoV-2-related genes in pulmonary tissues of lung cancer patients remains unknown. We sought to delineate single-cell expression profiles of ACE2 and other SARS-CoV-2-related genes in pulmonary tissues of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) patients. We examined the expression levels and cellular distribution of ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2-priming proteases TMPRSS2 and TMPRSS4 in 5 LUADs and 14 matched normal tissues by single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis. scRNA-seq of 186,916 cells revealed epithelial-specific expression of ACE2, TMPRSS2, and TMPRSS4. Analysis of 70,030 LUAD- and normal-derived epithelial cells showed that ACE2 levels were highest in normal alveolar type 2 (AT2) cells and that TMPRSS2 was expressed in 65% of normal AT2 cells. Conversely, the expression of TMPRSS4 was highest and most frequently detected (75%) in lung cells with malignant features. ACE2-positive cells co-expressed genes implicated in lung pathobiology, including COPD-associated HHIP, and the scavengers CD36 and DMBT1. Notably, the viral scavenger DMBT1 was significantly positively correlated with ACE2 expression in AT2 cells. We describe normal and tumor lung epithelial populations that express SARS-CoV-2 receptor and proteases, as well as major host defense genes, thus comprising potential treatment targets for COVID-19 particularly among lung cancer patients.","Han, Guangchun; Sinjab, Ansam; Hara, Kieko; Treekitkarnmongkol, Warapen; Brennan, Patrick; Chang, Kyle; Bogatenkova, Elena; Sanchez-Espiridion, Beatriz; Behrens, Carmen; Solis, Luisa M.; Gao, Boning; Girard, Luc; Zhang, Jianjun; Sepesi, Boris; Cascone, Tina; Byers, Lauren A.; Gibbons, Don L.; Chen, Jichao; Moghaddam, Seyed Javad; Ostrin, Edwin J.; Scheet, Paul; Fujimoto, Junya; Shay, Jerry; Heymach, John V.; Minna, John D.; Dubinett, Steven; Wistuba, Ignacio I.; Stevenson, Christopher S.; Spira, Avrum E.; Wang, Linghua; Kadara, Humam",Cancers (Basel),105,8

Methods: A total of 1,015 canine serum samples were randomly selected from submissions to a diagnostic laboratory between March and December 2014, and were analysed for CRCoV antibodies using a competitive ELISA. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine associations between seroprevalence of CRCoV and breed category, age, sex, sampling month, region, and reported health status of dogs. Results: Overall, 538/1,015 (53.0%) samples were seropositive for CRCoV, with 492/921 (53.4%) positive dogs in the North Island and 46/94 (49%) in the South Island. Age of dog, sampling month, region, and presence of abnormal respiratory signs were included in the initial logistic regression model. Seroprevalence was higher in dogs aged ≥3 compared with ≤2 years (p < 0.01). The lowest seroprevalence was observed in July (30/105; 28.5%) and August (32/100; 32%), and the highest in June (74/100; 74%). Seroprevalence in dogs from Auckland was higher than in dogs from the Hawkes Bay, Manawatu, Marlborough, and Waikato regions (p < 0.05).

Seroprevalence for CRCoV tended to be higher among dogs with respiratory signs (67.9 (95% CI = 47.6–83.4)%) than dogs with no reported respiratory signs (52.6 (95% CI = 49.5–55.7)%). Conclusions: Serological evidence of infection with CRCoV was present in more than half of the dogs tested from throughout New Zealand. Differences in CRCoV seroprevalence between regions and lack of seasonal pattern indicate that factors other than external temperatures may be important in the epidemiology of CRCoV in New Zealand. Clinical relevance: Our data suggest that CRCoV should be included in investigations of cases of infectious canine tracheobronchitis, particularly if these occur among dogs vaccinated with current vaccines, which do not include CRCoV antigens.","More, GD; Dunowska, M; Acke, E; Cave, NJ",N Z Vet J,105,16

Many have since resumed services with an emphasis on catch-up vaccinations. This paper evaluated immunization disruptions during India’s March-May 2020 lockdown and the extent to which subsequent catch-up efforts reversed them in Rajasthan, India. METHODS: In this retrospective observational study, we conducted phone surveys to collect immunization details for 2,144 children that turned one year old between January and October 2020. We used logistic regressions to compare differences in immunization timeliness and completed first-year immunization status among children that were due immunizations just before (unexposed), during (heavily exposed), and after (post-exposure) the lockdown. RESULTS: Relative to unexposed children, heavily exposed children were significantly less likely to be immunized at or before 9 months (OR 0.550; 95% CI 0.367–0.824; p = 0.004), but more likely to be immunized at 10–12 months (OR 1.761; 95% CI 1.196–2.591; p = 0.004). They were also less likely to have completed their key first-year immunizations (OR 0.624; 95% CI 0.478–0.816; p = 0.001) by the time of survey. In contrast, post-exposure children showed no difference in timeliness or completed first-year immunizations relative to unexposed children, despite their younger age. First-year immunization coverage among heavily exposed children decreased by 6.9 pp to 10.4 pp (9.7% to 14.0%). Declines in immunization coverage were larger among children in households that were poorer, less educated, lower caste, and residing in COVID red zones, although subgroup comparisons were not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: Disruptions to immunization services resulted in children missing immunization during the lockdown, but catch-up efforts after it was eased ensured many children were reached at later ages. Nevertheless, catch-up was incomplete and children due their immunizations during the lockdown remained less likely to be fully immunized 4–5 months after it lifted, even as younger cohorts due immunizations in June or later returned to pre-lockdown schedules.","Jain, Radhika; Chopra, Ambika; Falézan, Camille; Patel, Mustufa; Dupas, Pascaline",Vaccine,105,1

At the same time, in order to manage the pandemic, the health authorities around the world are advising people to stay at home. This results in decreased physical activity and an increased consumption of an unhealthy diet, which often leads to an increase in body weight, risk for diabetes, insulin resistance, and metabolic syndrome, and thus, paradoxically, to a high risk of morbidity and mortality due to COVID-19 complications. Here we summarize the evidence demonstrating that the promotion of a healthy life style, including physical activity and a dietary intake of natural polyphenols present in coffee and tea, has the potential to improve the prevention and management of insulin resistance and diabetes in the time of COVID-19 pandemic. Particularly, it would be pertinent to evaluate further the potential positive effects of coffee beverages, rich in natural polyphenols, as an adjuvant therapy for COVID-19, which appear not to be studied sufficiently.","Semiz, Sabina; Serdarevic, Fadila",Front Nutr,105,1

To examine antibody response in a patient infected with ZIKV, we used single-cell PCR to clone 31 heavy and light chain-paired monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that bind to ZIKV envelope (E) proteins isolated from memory B cells of a ZIKV-infected patient. Three mAbs (7B3, 1C11, and 6A6) that showed the most potent and broad neutralization activities against the African, Asian, and American strains were selected for further analysis. mAb 7B3 showed an IC50 value of 11.6 ng/mL against the circulating American strain GZ02. Epitope mapping revealed that mAbs 7B3 and 1C11 targeted residue K394 of the lateral ridge (LR) epitope of the EDIII domain, but 7B3 has a broader LR epitope footprint and recognizes residues T335, G337, E370, and N371 as well. mAb 6A6 recognized residues D67, K118, and K251 of the EDII domain. Interestingly, although the patient was seronegative for DENV infection, mAb 1C11, originating from the VH3-23 and VK1-5 germline pair, neutralized both ZIKV and DENV1. Administration of the mAbs 7B3, 1C11, and 6A6 protected neonatal SCID mice infected with a lethal dose of ZIKV. This study provides potential therapeutic antibody candidates and insights into the antibody response after ZIKV infection.","Niu, Xuefeng; Zhao, Lingzhai; Qu, Linbing; Yao, Zhipeng; Zhang, Fan; Yan, Qihong; Zhang, Shengnan; Liang, Renshan; Chen, Peihai; Luo, Jia; Xu, Wei; Lv, Huibin; Liu, Xinglong; Lei, Hui; Yi, Changhua; Li, Pingchao; Wang, Qian; Wang, Yang; Yu, Lei; Zhang, Xiaoyan; Bryan, L.

The objective of this study is to evaluate the quality of the diagnosis and treatment guidelines on COVID‐19 and analyze the consistency of the recommendations of these guidelines. METHODS: We searched for guidelines on diagnosis and/or treatment of COVID‐19 through PubMed, CBM, CNKI, and WanFang Data, from January 1, 2020 to August 31, 2020. In addition, we also searched official websites of the US CDC, European CDC and WHO, and some guideline collection databases. We included diagnosis and/or treatment guidelines for COVID‐19, including rapid advice guidelines and interim guidelines. Two trained researchers independently extracted data and four trained researchers evaluated the quality of the guidelines using the AGREE II instruments. We extracted information on the basic characteristics of the guidelines, guideline development process, and the recommendations. We described the consistency of the direction of recommendations for treatment and diagnosis of COVID‐19 across the included guidelines. RESULTS: A total of 37 guidelines were included. Most included guidelines were assessed as low quality, with only one of the six domains of AGREE II (clarity of presentation) having a mean score above 50%. The mean scores of three domains (stakeholder involvement, the rigor of development and applicability) were all below 30%. The recommendations on diagnosis and treatment were to some extent consistent between the included guidelines. Computed tomography (CT), X‐rays, lung ultrasound, RT‐PCR, and routine blood tests were the most commonly recommended methods for COVID‐19 diagnosis. Thirty guidelines were on the treatment of COVID‐19. The recommended forms of treatment included supportive care, antiviral therapy, glucocorticoid therapy, antibiotics, immunoglobulin, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), convalescent plasma, and psychotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: The methodological quality of currently available diagnosis and treatment guidelines for COVID‐19 is low. The diagnosis and treatment recommendations between the included guidelines are highly consistent. The main diagnostic methods for COVID‐19 are RT‐PCR and CT, with ultrasound as a potential diagnostic tool. As there is no effective treatment against COVID‐19 yet, supportive therapy is at the moment the most important treatment option.","Luo, Xufei; Liu, Yunlan; Ren, Mengjuan; Zhang, Xianzhuo; Janne, Estill; Lv, Meng; Wang, Qi; Song, Yang; Mathew, Joseph L.; Ahn, Hyeong Sik; Lee, Myeong Soo; Chen, Yaolong",J Evid Based Med,105,24

METHODS: Participants (n=3207, aged 2–90 years), enrolled from a previously established nationwide serosurveillance study, provided a self-collected fingerstick blood sample and completed a questionnaire (median inclusion date 3 April 2020). IgG antibodies targeted against the spike S1-protein of SARS-CoV-2 were quantified using a validated multiplex-immunoassay. Seroprevalence was estimated controlling for survey design, individual pre-pandemic concentration, and test performance. Random-effects logistic regression identified risk factors for seropositivity. RESULTS: Overall seroprevalence in the Netherlands was 2.8% (95% CI 2.1 to 3.7), with no differences between sexes or ethnic background, and regionally ranging between 1.3 and 4.0%. Estimates were highest among 18–39 year-olds (4.9%), and lowest in children 2–17 years (1.7%). Multivariable analysis revealed that persons taking immunosuppressants and those from the Orthodox-Reformed Protestant community had over four times higher odds of being seropositive compared to others. Anosmia/ageusia was the most discriminative symptom between seropositive (53%) and seronegative persons (4%, p<0.0001). Antibody concentrations in seropositive persons were significantly higher in those with fever or dyspnoea in contrast to those without (p=0.01 and p=0.04, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: In the midst of the first epidemic wave, 2.8% of the Dutch population was estimated to be infected with SARS-CoV-2, that is, 30 times higher than reported.

Mobile tracking technologies register nearby contacts of a user and notifies them if one later tests positive to the virus, potentially solving this issue; however, the effectiveness of these technologies depends on their acceptance by the public. The current study assessed attitudes towards three tracking technologies (telecommunication network tracking, a government app, and Apple and Google’s Bluetooth exposure notification system) among four samples of young Taiwanese adults (aged 25 years or younger).

This type of strict measures caused an outcome, the reduction of urban air pollution, around the world. The present study aims to investigate the reduction of the concentration of pollutants in the air of Dhaka City and the reduction of the Air Quality Index (AQI). Necessary time-series data of the concentration of PM(2.5), NO(2), SO(2), and CO have been collected from the archive of the Air Quality Monitoring Station of the US Embassy in Dhaka and Sentinel-5P. The time-series data have been analyzed by descriptive statistics, and AQI was calculated following an appropriate formula suggested by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) based on the criteria pollutants. The study found that the concentrations of PM(2.5), NO(2), SO(2), and CO during April–May 2020 have been reduced by 26, 30, 07, and 07%, respectively, compared with the preceding year’s concentrations. Moreover, the AQI has also been reduced by about 35% on average during the lockdown period than the same times of the previous year. However, the magnitude of pollution reduction in Dhaka is lower than in other cities and countries globally, including Delhi, Sao Paulo, Wuhan, Spain, Italy, the USA. The main reasons may include, among others, the poor implementation of lockdown (especially in the first week of April and the second fortnight of May), pre-existing pollution, transboundary pollution, incineration of solid waste, etc. This study will help policymakers figure out how to regulate pollution sources and improve the air quality of Dhaka.

ACLF frequently occurs in close temporal relationship to a precipitating event, such as acute alcoholic, drug-induced or viral hepatitis or bacterial infection and, in cases without precipitating events, probably related to intestinal translocation of bacterial products. Dysbalanced immune function is central to its pathogenesis and outcome with an initial excessive systemic inflammatory response that drives organ failure and mortality. This hyperinflammatory state ultimately impairs the host defensive mechanisms of immune cells, rendering ACLF patients immunocompromised and more vulnerable to secondary infections, and therefore to higher organ dysfunction and mortality. In this review, we describe the prevailing characteristics of the hyperinflammatory state in patients with acutely decompensated cirrhosis developing ACLF, with special emphasis on cells of the innate immune system (i.e., monocytes and neutrophils), their triggers (pathogen- and damage-associated molecular patterns [PAMPs and DAMPs]), their effector molecules (cytokines, chemokines, growth factors and bioactive lipid mediators) and the consequences on tissue immunopathology. In addition, this review includes a chapter discussing new emerging therapies based on the modulation of leukocyte function by the administration of pleiotropic proteins such as albumin, Toll-like receptor 4 antagonists, interleukin-22 or stem cell therapy. Finally, the importance of finding an appropriate intervention that reduces inflammation without inducing immunosuppression is highlighted as one of the main therapeutic challenges in cirrhosis.","Casulleras, Mireia; Zhang, Ingrid W.; López-Vicario, Cristina; Clària, Joan",Cells,105,26

The aim of the research was to investigate the relation between distance education and teachers’ well-being, and their close relations and other social relations during the first two waves of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: The research was conducted in two stages on 285 Polish primary and secondary school teachers who were recruited by means of the chain referral method. The following measures were used: The Depression Anxiety & Stress Scales-21, Berlin Social Support Scales, The Relationship Satisfaction Scale and The Injustice Experience Questionnaire. RESULTS: The teachers experienced at least mild levels of stress, anxiety and depression, both during the first as well as the second waves of the COVID-19 pandemic in Poland. It has been confirmed that there is a negative relation between relationship quality change and social relations quality change, and stress, anxiety and depression. The variables taken into consideration in the research have provided the explanation for the variation of stress—from 6% in the first stage of the research to 47% in the second stage; for the variation of anxiety—from 21% to 31%; and for the variation of depression—from 12% to 46%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The research results show that due to distance work the distinction between professional work and family life might have been blurred, and as a consequence teachers’ well-being could have been worsened. The isolation put on to stop the spreading of the virus might have contributed to changes in social relations, in close relations in particular, and at the same time negatively influenced teachers’ abilities to effectively cope with the crisis situations.","Jakubowski, Tomasz Daniel; Sitko-Dominik, Magdalena Maja",PLoS One,105,1

The international system of coordination established through the World Health Organization via the International Health Regulations largely relies on governments to communicate timely and accurate information about health risk during an outbreak. This information supports WHO’s decision making process for declaring a public health emergency of international concern. It also aides the WHO to work with governments to coordinate efforts to contain cross-border outbreaks. Given the importance of information sharing by governments, it is not surprising that governments that withhold or delay sharing information about outbreaks within their borders are often condemned by the international community for non-compliance with the International Health Regulations. The barriers to rapid and transparent information sharing are numerous. While governments must be held accountable for delaying or withholding information, in many cases non-compliance may be a rational response to real and perceived risks rather than a problem of technical incapacity or a lack of political commitment. Improving adherence to the International Health Regulations will require a long-term process to build trust that incorporates recognizing and mitigating the potential and perceived risks of information sharing.","Lencucha, Raphael; Bandara, Shashika",Global Health,105,16

The first involves the growing use of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) for the profound clinical cytokine storm and severe pneumonia in COVID‐19 patients. Instead, it is recommended to treat alternatively with their MSC‐released exosomes. This is because many reports in the literature and our data have shown that the release of exosomes from the in vivo administered MSC is actually responsible for their beneficial effects. Further, the exosomes are superior, simpler and clinically more convenient compared to their parental MSC. Additionally, in the context of COVID‐19, the known tendency of MSC to intravascularly aggregate causing lung dysfunction might synergize with the pneumonia aspects, and the tendency of MSC peripheral vascular micro aggregates might synergize with the vascular clots of the COVID‐19 disease process, causing significant central or peripheral vascular insufficiency. The second exosome therapeutic area for severe COVID‐19 involves use of convalescent plasma for its content of acquired immune antibodies that must consider the role in this therapy of contained nearly trillions of exosomes. Many of these derive from activated immune modulating cells and likely can function to transfer miRNAs that acting epigenetically to also influence the convalescent plasma recipient response to the virus. There is sufficient evidence, like recovery of patients with antibody deficiencies, to postulate that the antibodies actually have little effect and that immune resistance is principally due to T cell mechanisms. Further, COVID‐19 convalescent plasma has remarkably weak beneficial effects if compared to what was expected from many prior studies. This may be due to the dysfunctional immune response to the infection and resulting weak Ab that may be impaired further by antagonistic exosomes in the convalescent plasma. At the least, pre selection of plasma for the best antibodies and relevant exosomes would produce the most optimum therapy for very severely affected COVID‐19 patients.","Askenase, Philip W.",J Extracell Vesicles,105,25

Despite the implementation of aggressive measures to curb infection spread, gaps remain in the understanding of the clinical and epidemiologic features of the regional pandemic. METHODS: We did a retrospective, observational cohort study of patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 hospitalized in Kazakhstan between February and April 2020. We compared demographic, clinical, laboratory and radiological data of patients with different COVID-19 severities on admission. Logistic regression was used to assess factors associated with disease severity and in-hospital death. Whole-genome SARS-CoV-2 analysis was performed in 53 patients. FINDINGS: Of the 1072 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in March-April 2020, the median age was 36 years (IQR 24–50) and 484 (45%) were male. On admission, 683 (64%) participants had asymptomatic/mild, 341 (32%) moderate, and 47 (4%) severe-to-critical COVID-19 manifestation; 20 in-hospital deaths (1•87%) were reported by 5 May 2020. Multivariable regression indicated increasing odds of severe disease associated with older age (odds ratio 1•05, 95% CI 1•03-1•07, per year increase; p<0•001), the presence of comorbidities (2•34, 95% CI 1•18-4•85; p=0•017) and elevated white blood cell count (WBC, 1•13, 95% CI 1•00-1•27; p=0•044) on admission, while older age (1•09, 95% CI 1•06-1•13, per year increase; p<0•001) and male sex (5•63, 95% CI 2•06-17•57; p=0•001) were associated with increased odds of in-hospital death. The SARS-CoV-2 isolates grouped into seven phylogenetic lineages, O/B.4.1, S/A.2, S/B.1.1, G/B.1, GH/B.1.255, GH/B.1.3 and GR/B.1.1.10; 87% of the isolates were O and S sub-types descending from early Asian lineages, while the G, GH and GR isolates were related to lineages from Europe and the Americas. INTERPRETATION: Older age, comorbidities, increased WBC count, and male sex were risk factors for COVID-19 disease severity and mortality in Kazakhstan. The broad SARS-CoV-2 diversity suggests multiple importations and community-level amplification predating travel restriction.

The objective of this study was to investigate anxiety symptoms and use of preventive measures against COVID-19. The study also compared the association between preventive measures and anxiety symptoms during the week immediately preceding the study and those symptoms and measures at the beginning of the outbreak. METHODS: A cross-sectional population survey using an online questionnaire commenced on 14 February 2020. The study participants were residents of Taiwan ages 20 to 70 years. The 6-item state version of the State–Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-6) was used to assess anxiety symptoms. The questions about preventive measures asked participants about their personal protection, cough etiquette, contact precautions, voluntary quarantine, and prompt reporting. Multivariable logistic regression was used to determine the factors influencing an increase in the preventive measures scores. RESULTS: Of a total of 3555 completed responses, a total of 52.1% (95% confidence interval [CI] 50.4–53.7) of the respondents reported moderate to severe levels of anxiety symptoms in the past week, whereas 48.8% (95%CI 47.2–50.5) reported moderate to severe anxiety symptoms at the beginning of the outbreak. With a higher score indicating greater anxiety, the median scores for anxiety symptoms in the past week and at the beginning of the outbreak were 46.7 (IQR [interquartile range] 36.7–53.3) and 43.3 (IQR 36.7–53.3), respectively. The median scores for the preventive measures taken in the past week and at the beginning of the outbreak were 26.0 (IQR 21.0–30.0) and 24.0 (IQR 19.0–28.0), respectively, out of a maximum score of 36. In the multivariable analysis, an increased anxiety symptom score from the beginning of the outbreak to the past week (adjusted OR = 7.38, 95%CI 6.28–8.66) was a strongly significant determinant of an increased preventive measures score in the past week compared with the score at the beginning of the outbreak. CONCLUSIONS: Anxiety and preventive measures scores were high and increased with the epidemic rate. Higher anxiety was associated with an increased use of preventive measures against COVID-19.","Wong, Li Ping; Hung, Chia-Chun; Alias, Haridah; Lee, Tony Szu-Hsien",BMC Psychiatry,105,16

Although a growing number of studies have examined the effects of macroprudential policy on credit growth, few empirical studies have analyzed its effect on the probability of a banking crisis. Does macroprudential policy actually affect the probability of a banking crisis? Do other macroeconomic policies matter for the effectiveness of macroprudential policy? To answer these questions, this paper empirically investigates the effect of macroprudential policy on the probability of a banking crisis and its relationship with other macroeconomic policies. Specifically, using data on 65 countries from 2000 to 2016, we employ a probit model to analyze the effect of changes in the loan-to-value (LTV) ratio on crisis probability. Our results show that macroprudential policy is effective in changing the probability of a banking crisis via a credit channel and that its effectiveness depends on other macroeconomic policies. Changes in the LTV ratio are found to be effective in influencing the probability of a banking crisis in countries that have inflation targeting frameworks, floating exchange rate regimes, and/or no capital controls. Our results underscore the importance of policy coordination among different government bodies to design an appropriate macroprudential policy, especially in the current context of the Covid-19 crisis.","Ryota, Nakatani",J Policy Model,105,1

Therefore, this study was designed to analyze the trends of symptoms in Indian patients during COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted on 100 patients (73 males, 24 females, and 3 transgenders) admitted under institutional isolation at a tertiary care center in India using a self-designed survey-based questionnaire. A descriptive analysis of results done based on age and sex. RESULTS: COVID incidence recorded is high in male (73%) as compared to female (24%), yet female patients have a higher prevalence of symptoms as compared to male patients. CONCLUSION: Male patients are more as far as COVID incidence is concerned, while female patients show high prevalence of symptoms as compared to male patients. Patients presenting with COVID-positive report suffer a significant burden of symptoms, and timely recognition of symptoms and their management can significantly reduce morbidity and mortality due to COVID-19.","Kumar, Sanjeev; Rathore, Puneet; Choudhary, Nandan; Singh, Neha; Thankachan, Alice; Kumar, Balbir; Bhopale, Shweta; Mohan, Anant; Bhatnagar, Sushma",Indian J Palliat Care,105,1

Additionally, pregnant women with COVID-19 might have an increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes. To investigate the effects of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on mortality of pregnant and postpartum women, we performed a systematic review of available published literature on pregnancies affected by COVID-19. METHODS: Web of Science, SCOPUS, and MEDLINE- databases were searched for original studies concerning the effect of COVID-19 on mortality of pregnant and postpartum women published by July 10, 2020. Meta-analyses of proportions were used to combine data and report pooled proportions. RESULTS: 117 studies with a total of 11758 pregnant women were included. The age ranged between 15 and 48 years. Most subjects were infected with SARS-CoV-2 in the third trimester. Disease severity was not reported in 1125 subjects. Maternal mortality was 1.3%. In 100% of fatal cases with adequate data, fever alone or with cough was one of the presenting symptoms. Also, dyspnea (58.3%) and myalgia (50%) were the most common symptoms. Sore throat (8.3%) and gastrointestinal symptoms (anorexia, nausea) (8.3%) were rare. The rate of comorbidities was 20% among COVID-19 deaths. The majority of COVID-19-infected women who died had cesarean section (58.3%), 25% had a vaginal delivery, and 16.7% of patients were not full term. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 infection in pregnant women was associated with higher rates (and pooled proportions) of cesarean section and mortality. Because new data are continuously being generated and published, the findings of this study can be complete and updated with new researches. The results of this study can guide and improve prenatal counseling of COVID-19-infected pregnant women.","Karimi, Leila; Makvandi, Somayeh; Vahedian-Azimi, Amir; Sathyapalan, Thozhukat; Sahebkar, Amirhossein",J Pregnancy,105,24

Yet, dynamic changes in IL-6 levels and their prognostic value as an indicator of lung injury in COVID-19 patients have not been fully elucidated. OBJECTIVE: To validate whether IL-6 levels are associated with disease severity and mortality and to investigate whether dynamic changes in IL-6 levels might be a predictive factor for lung injury in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: This retrospective, single-center study included 728 adult COVID-19 patients and used data extracted from electronic medical records for analyses. RESULTS: The mortality rate was higher in the elevated IL-6 group than in the normal IL-6 group (0.16 vs 5%). Cox proportional hazards and logistic regression analyses for survival (adjusted hazard ratio, 10.39; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.09–99.23; p = 0.042) and disease severity (adjusted odds ratio, 3.56; 95% CI, 2.06–6.19; p < 0.001) revealed similar trends. Curve-fitting analyses indicated that patient computed tomography (CT) scores peaked on days 22 and 24. An initial decline in IL-6 levels on day 16 was followed by resurgence to a peak, nearly in tandem with the CT scores. CONCLUSION: Increased IL-6 level may be an independent risk factor for disease severity and in-hospital mortality and dynamic IL-6 changes may serve as a potential predictor for lung injury in Chinese COVID-19 patients. These findings may guide future treatment of COVID-19 patients.","Liu, Zeming; Li, Jinpeng; Chen, Danyang; Gao, Rongfen; Zeng, Wen; Chen, Sichao; Huang, Yihui; Huang, Jianglong; Long, Wei; Li, Man; Guo, Liang; Wang, Xinghuan; Wu, Xiaohui",Front Pharmacol,105,3

In the developing nations with scarce healthcare resources, the reliance on healthcare workers who are amply prepared to withstand the prevailing scenario is indispensable. Our study aimed to assess the level of preparedness of doctors working in various hospitals across Pakistan to combat coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Methods We conducted an online questionnaire-based survey in May 2020 to estimate the level of preparedness of doctors working in various departments of various private and public hospitals across Pakistan. The survey comprised 36 questions, with items evaluating the provision of adequate protective equipment, training, mental health resources, and sound collaboration between healthcare workers and the hospital management during the COVID-19 crisis. Results A total of 346 doctors responded to the survey, among whom 56.4% were working in public sector hospitals and 46.5% were working more than five days per week. Of those included, 87.6% were being provided with disposable gloves, but 72.8% and 43.4% of respondents professed to having no access to eye protective equipment and gowns, respectively. Only 35.3% of respondents claimed to be trained regarding the use of personal protective equipment and 28.95% were being tested. Of the physicians, 43.4% claimed to have no proper triage system for the suspected patients and 98.3% were concerned about transmitting the disease to their family members. Of the doctors, 53.5% reported that there was sound collaboration between the hospital management and healthcare staff. Conclusion The survey provided evidence of inadequate delivery of personal protective equipment and training to doctors working in various hospitals across Pakistan. A sound collaboration between the hospital management and departments needs to be addressed.","Hashim, Laila; Khan, Hamza R; Ullah, Irfan; Khalid, Maida; Almas, Talal; Zaidi, Syed Muhammad Jawad; Ehtesham, Maryam; Niaz, Muhammad Ali; Akbar, Absam; Haadi, Abdul",Cureus,105,23

Lack of effective clinical drug for most of the viruses emphasizes the rapid and accurate diagnosis at early stages of infection to prevent rapid spread of the pathogens. Nanotechnology is an emerging field with applications in various domains, where nano‐biomedical science has many significant contributions such as effective delivery of drugs/therapeutic molecules to specific organs, imaging, sensitive detection of virus, and their accurate tracking in host cells. The nanomaterials reported for virus detection and tracking mainly include magnetic and gold NPs, ZnO/Pt‐Pd, graphene, and quantum dots (QDs). In addition, the single virus tracking technology (SVT) allowed to track the life cycle stages of an individual virus for better understanding of their dynamics within the living cells. Inorganic as well as non‐metallic fluorescent materials share the advantages of high photochemical stability, a wide range of light absorption curves and polychromatic emission. Hence, are considered as potential fluorescent nano‐probes for SVT. However, there are still some challenges: (i) clinical false positive rate of some detection methods is still high; (ii) in the virus tracking process, less adaptability of QDs owing to larger size, flicker, and possible interference with virus function; and (iii) in vivo tracking of a single virus, in real time needs further refinement. In the future, smaller, non‐toxic, and chemically stable nanomaterials are needed to improve the efficiency and accuracy of detection, and monitoring of virus infections to curb the mortalities.

However, the term “aerosol” covers most particle sizes of suspended particulates because of information asymmetry in different disciplines, which may lead to misunderstandings in the selection of epidemic prevention and control strategies for the public. In this review, the time when these droplets are exhaled by a patient was taken as the initial time. Then, all available viral loads and numerical distribution of the exhaled droplets was analyzed, and the evaporation model of droplets in the air was combined with the deposition model of droplet nuclei in the respiratory tract. Lastly, the perspective that physical spread affects the transmission risk of different size droplets at different times was summarized for the first time. The results showed that although the distribution of exhaled droplets was dominated by small droplets, droplet volume was proportional to the third power of particle diameter, meaning that the viral load of a 100 μm droplet was approximately 10(6) times that of a 1 μm droplet at the initial time. Furthermore, the exhaled droplets are affected by heat and mass transfer of evaporation, water fraction, salt concentration, and acid-base balance (the water fraction > 98%), which lead them to change rapidly, and the viral survival condition also deteriorates dramatically. The time required for the initial diameter (d(o)) of a droplet to shrink to the equilibrium diameter (d(e), about 30% of d(o)) is approximately proportional to the second power of the particle diameter, taking only a few milliseconds for a 1 μm droplet but hundreds of milliseconds for a 10 μm droplet; in other words, the viruses carried by the large droplets can be preserved as much as possible. Finally, the infectious droplet nuclei maybe inhaled by the susceptible population through different and random contact routes, and the droplet nuclei with larger d(e) decompose more easily into tiny particles on account of the accelerated collision in a complex airway, which can be deposited in the higher risk alveolar region. During disease transmission, the infectious droplet particle size varies widely, and the transmission risk varies significantly at different time nodes; therefore, the fuzzy term “aerosol” is not conducive to analyzing disease exposure risk. Recommendations for epidemic prevention and control strategies are: 1) Large droplets are the main conflict in disease transmission; thus, even if they are blocked by a homemade mask initially, it significantly contains the epidemic. 2) The early phase of contact, such as close-contact and short-range transmission, has the highest infection risk; therefore, social distancing can effectively keep the susceptible population from inhaling active viruses. 3) The risk of the fomite route depends on the time in contact with infectious viruses; thus, it is important to promote good health habits (including frequent hand washing, no-eye rubbing, coughing etiquette, normalization of surface cleaning), although blind and excessive disinfection measures are not advisable. 4) Compared with the large droplets, the small droplets have larger numbers but carry fewer viruses and are more prone to die through evaporation.","Mao, N.; An, C.K.; Guo, L.Y.; Wang, M.; Guo, L.; Guo, S.R.; Long, E.S.",Build Environ,105,1

Here, we investigated the effect of obesity on disease severity following SARS-CoV-2 infection using a well-established mouse model of diet-induced obesity. Diet-induced obese and lean control C57BL/6N mice, transduced for ACE2 expression using replication-defective adenovirus, were infected with SARS-CoV-2, and monitored for lung pathology, viral titers, and cytokine expression. No significant differences in tissue pathology or viral replication was observed between AdV transduced lean and obese groups, infected with SARS-CoV-2, but certain cytokines were expressed more significantly in infected obese mice compared to the lean ones. Notably, significant weight loss was observed in obese mice treated with the adenovirus vector, independent of SARS-CoV-2 infection, suggesting an obesity-dependent morbidity induced by the vector.

The first laboratory-confirmed case of COVID-19 in Austria was announced on February 27, 2020. Since then, the incidence of infection followed an exponential increase until a complete lockdown in March 2020. Thereafter easing of restrictions was gradually introduced and until mid-August daily infections remained mostly below 5 per 100.000 population. Objectives: The aims of this study are to determine i) how many employees in Austrian trauma hospitals and rehabilitation facilities have virus specific IgG and IgM, and/or neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, ii) how many are active virus carriers (symptomatic and asymptomatic) during the study, iii) the antibody decline in seropositive subjects over a period of around six months, and iv) the utility of rapid antibody tests for outpatient screening. Study Design: Open uncontrolled observational cross-sectional study. Setting/Participants: A total of 3301 employees in 11 Austrian trauma hospitals and rehabilitation facilities of the Austrian Social Insurance for Occupational Risks (AUVA) participated in the study. Study Interventions and Measures: Rapid antibody tests for SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG and IgM antibodies, and RT-PCR tests based on oropharyngeal swab samples, as well as laboratory-based antibody tests using ELISA/PRNT were performed. The tests were conducted twice, with an interval of 42.4{+/-}7.7 (Min=30, Max=64) days. Additionally, participants filled out a questionnaire including questions related to personal health, traveling activities, living situation, as well as inquiries of symptoms and comorbidities. Antibody positive tested participants were re-tested with ELISA/PRNT tests at a third time point on average 188.0{+/-}12.8 days after their initial test. Results: In our study cohort, only 27 out of 3301 participants (0.81%) had a positive antibody test at any time point during the study confirmed via neutralization test. Among participants who had positive test results in either of the antibody tests, 50.4% did not report any symptoms consistent with common manifestations of COVID-19 during the study period or within the preceding six weeks. In the group who tested positive during or prior to study inclusion the most common symptoms of an acute viral illness were rhinitis (21.9%), and loss of taste and olfactory sense (21.9%).

In this review, we will summarize the molecular mechanism for entry of SARS-CoV-2 into host cells, the basis for the failure of the lungs and other organs in severe acute cases, and the evidence for congenital transmission.","Zhang, Hui; Zhang, Hong",J Mol Cell Biol,105,8

Although the pandemic has an all-round impact on medical work, the degree of its impact on endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) for patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) is unclear. METHODS: We continuously included AIS patients with large artery occlusion who underwent EVT in a comprehensive stroke center before and during the Wuhan shutdown. The protected code stroke (PCS) for screening and treating AIS patients was established during the pandemic. The efficacy and safety outcomes including the rate of successful reperfusion (defined as modified Thrombolysis In Cerebral Infarction (mTICI) graded 2b or 3) and time intervals for reperfusion were compared between two groups: pre-pandemic and pandemic. RESULTS: A total of 55 AIS patients who received EVT were included. The baseline characteristics were comparable between the two groups. The time from hospital arrival to puncture (174 vs 125.5 min; p=0.002) and time from hospital arrival to reperfusion (213 vs 172 min; p=0.047) were significantly prolonged in the pandemic group compared with the pre-pandemic group. The rate of successful reperfusion was not significantly different between the two groups (85.7% (n=18) vs 88.2% (n=30); OR 0.971, 95% CI 0.785 to 1.203; p=1.000). CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggest a proper PCS algorithm which combines the COVID-19 screening and protection measures could decrease the impact of the disease on the clinical outcomes of EVT for AIS patients to the lowest extent possible during the pandemic.","Yang, Bin; Wang, Tao; Chen, Jian; Chen, Yanfei; Wang, Yabing; Gao, Peng; Li, Guilin; Chen, Fei; Li, Long; Wang, Zheng; Zhang, Hongqi; Song, Haiqing; Ma, Qingfeng; Jiao, Liqun",J Neurointerv Surg,105,24

Our observations suggest that by the time SARS-CoV-2 was first detected in late 2019, it was already pre-adapted to human transmission to an extent similar to late epidemic SARS-CoV. However, no precursors or branches of evolution stemming from a less human-adapted SARS-CoV-2-like virus have been detected. The sudden appearance of a highly infectious SARS-CoV-2 presents a major cause for concern that should motivate stronger international efforts to identify the source and prevent near future re-emergence. Any existing pools of SARS-CoV-2 progenitors would be particularly dangerous if similarly well adapted for human transmission. To look for clues regarding intermediate hosts, we analyze recent key findings relating to how SARS-CoV-2 could have evolved and adapted for human transmission, and examine the environmental samples from the Wuhan Huanan seafood market. Importantly, the market samples are genetically identical to human SARS-CoV-2 isolates and were therefore most likely from human sources. We conclude by describing and advocating for measured and effective approaches implemented in the 2002-2004 SARS outbreaks to identify lingering population(s) of progenitor virus.","Zhan, Shing Hei; Deverman, Benjamin E.; Chan, Yujia Alina",bioRxiv,105,24

One month after lockdown commenced (T2), we assessed 30 psychological and behavioural traits in 4,000 twins in their mid-twenties and compared their responses to the same traits assessed in 2018 (T1). Mean changes from T1 to T2 were modest and inconsistent: just as many changes were in a positive as negative direction. Twin analyses revealed that genetics accounted for about half of the reliable variance at T1 and T2. Genetic factors correlated on average .86 between T1 and T2 and accounted for over half of the phenotypic stability. Systematic environmental influences had negligible impact on T1, T2 or T2 change. Rather than the crisis fundamentally changing people psychologically, our results suggest that genetic differences between individuals play a fundamental role in shaping psychological and behavioural responses to the COVID-19 crisis.","Rimfeld, Kaili; Malancini, Margherita; Allegrini, Andrea; Packer, Amy E.; McMillan, Andrew; Ogden, Rachel; Webster, Louise; Shakeshaft, Nicholas G.; Schofield, Kerry L.; Pingault, Jean-Baptiste; Stringaris, Argyris; von Stumm, Sophie; Plomin, Robert",Res Sq,105,22

As of May 30, 2021, approximately one half of U.S. adults were fully vaccinated, with the lowest coverage and lowest reported intent to get vaccinated among young adults aged 18-39 years (1-4). To examine attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccination and vaccination intent among adults in this age group, CDC conducted nationally representative household panel surveys during March-May 2021. Among respondents aged 18-39 years, 34.0% reported having received a COVID-19 vaccine. A total of 51.8% were already vaccinated or definitely planned to get vaccinated, 23.2% reported that they probably were going to get vaccinated or were unsure about getting vaccinated, and 24.9% reported that they probably or definitely would not get vaccinated. Adults aged 18-24 years were least likely to report having received a COVID-19 vaccine and were most likely to report being unsure about getting vaccinated or that they were probably going to get vaccinated. Adults aged 18-39 years with lower incomes, with lower educational attainment, without health insurance, who were non-Hispanic Black, and who lived outside of metropolitan areas had the lowest reported vaccination coverage and intent to get vaccinated. Concerns about vaccine safety and effectiveness were the primary reported reasons for not getting vaccinated. Vaccination intent and acceptance among adults aged 18-39 years might be increased by improving confidence in vaccine safety and efficacy while emphasizing that vaccines are critical to prevent the spread of COVID-19 to friends and family and for resuming social activities (5).","Baack, Brittney N.; Abad, Neetu; Yankey, David; Kahn, Katherine E.; Razzaghi, Hilda; Brookmeyer, Kathryn; Kolis, Jessica; Wilhelm, Elisabeth; Nguyen, Kimberly H.; Singleton, James A.",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,105,1

We aimed to determine whether clinical phenotypes of patients with COVID-19 can be derived from clinical data, to assess the reproducibility of these phenotypes and correlation with prognosis, and to derive and validate a simplified probabilistic model for phenotype assignment. Phenotype identification was not primarily intended as a predictive tool for mortality. METHODS: In this study, we used data from two cohorts: the COVID-19@Spain cohort, a retrospective cohort including 4035 consecutive adult patients admitted to 127 hospitals in Spain with COVID-19 between Feb 2 and March 17, 2020, and the COVID-19@HULP cohort, including 2226 consecutive adult patients admitted to a teaching hospital in Madrid between Feb 25 and April 19, 2020. The COVID-19@Spain cohort was divided into a derivation cohort, comprising 2667 randomly selected patients, and an internal validation cohort, comprising the remaining 1368 patients. The COVID-19@HULP cohort was used as an external validation cohort. A probabilistic model for phenotype assignment was derived in the derivation cohort using multinomial logistic regression and validated in the internal validation cohort. The model was also applied to the external validation cohort. 30-day mortality and other prognostic variables were assessed in the derived phenotypes and in the phenotypes assigned by the probabilistic model. FINDINGS: Three distinct phenotypes were derived in the derivation cohort (n=2667)—phenotype A (516 [19%] patients), phenotype B (1955 [73%]) and phenotype C (196 [7%])—and reproduced in the internal validation cohort (n=1368)—phenotype A (233 [17%] patients), phenotype B (1019 [74%]), and phenotype C (116 [8%]). Patients with phenotype A were younger, were less frequently male, had mild viral symptoms, and had normal inflammatory parameters. Patients with phenotype B included more patients with obesity, lymphocytopenia, and moderately elevated inflammatory parameters. Patients with phenotype C included older patients with more comorbidities and even higher inflammatory parameters than phenotype B. We developed a simplified probabilistic model (validated in the internal validation cohort) for phenotype assignment, including 16 variables. In the derivation cohort, 30-day mortality rates were 2·5% (95% CI 1·4–4·3) for patients with phenotype A, 30·5% (28·5–32·6) for patients with phenotype B, and 60·7% (53·7–67·2) for patients with phenotype C (log-rank test p<0·0001). The predicted phenotypes in the internal validation cohort and external validation cohort showed similar mortality rates to the assigned phenotypes (internal validation cohort: 5·3% [95% CI 3·4–8·1] for phenotype A, 31·3% [28·5–34·2] for phenotype B, and 59·5% [48·8–69·3] for phenotype C; external validation cohort: 3·7% [2·0–6·4] for phenotype A, 23·7% [21·8–25·7] for phenotype B, and 51·4% [41·9–60·7] for phenotype C). INTERPRETATION: Patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19 can be classified into three phenotypes that correlate with mortality. We developed and validated a simplified tool for the probabilistic assignment of patients into phenotypes. These results might help to better classify patients for clinical management, but the pathophysiological mechanisms of the phenotypes must be investigated.

We conducted a head-to-head evaluation of 10 point-of-care (POC) style lateral flow assays (LFAs) and two laboratory-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) to detect anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies by 5-day time intervals from symptom onset and the specificity of each assay in pre-COVID-2019 specimens. The percent of seropositive individuals increased with time, peaking in the latest time interval tested (>20 days after symptom onset). Test specificity was heterogeneous (ranging from 84.3–100.0%) and was predominantly affected by variability in IgM results. LFA specificity could be increased by considering weak bands as negative, but this decreased detection of antibodies in a subset of SARS-CoV-2 real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-positive cases. Our results indicate the importance of seropositivity threshold determination and reader training for reliable LFA deployment. Informed use of serology will require evaluations covering the full spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 infections, from asymptomatic and mild infection to severe disease, and later convalescence. Well-designed studies to elucidate the mechanisms and serological correlates of protective immunity will be crucial to guide rational clinical and public health policies.","Whitman, Jeffrey D.; Hiatt, Joseph; Mowery, Cody T.; Shy, Brian R.; Yu, Ruby; Yamamoto, Tori N.; Rathore, Ujjwal; Goldgof, Gregory M.; Whitty, Caroline; Woo, Jonathan M.; Gallman, Antonia E.; Miller, Tyler E.; Levine, Andrew G.; Nguyen, David N.; Bapat, Sagar P.; Balcerek, Joanna; Bylsma, Sophia A.; Lyons, Ana M.; Li, Stacy; Wong, Allison Wai-yi; Gillis-Buck, Eva Mae; Steinhart, Zachary B.; Lee, Youjin; Apathy, Ryan; Lipke, Mitchell J.; Smith, Jennifer Anne; Zheng, Tina; Boothby, Ian C.; Isaza, Erin; Chan, Jackie; Acenas, Dante D.; Lee, Jinwoo; Macrae, Trisha A.; Kyaw, Than S.; Wu, David; Ng, Dianna L.; Gu, Wei; York, Vanessa A.; Eskandarian, Haig Alexander; Callaway, Perri C.; Warrier, Lakshmi; Moreno, Mary E.; Levan, Justine; Torres, Leonel; Farrington, Lila A.; Loudermilk, Rita; Koshal, Kanishka; Zorn, Kelsey C.; Garcia-Beltran, Wilfredo F.; Yang, Diane; Astudillo, Michael G.; Bernstein, Bradley E.; Gelfand, Jeffrey A.; Ryan, Edward T.; Charles, Richelle C.; Iafrate, A.

Analytical and numerical studies are undertaken. The models ascertain the range, distribution and settling time of the particles under the influence of gravity and drag from the surrounding air. Beyond qualitative trends that illustrate that large particles travel far and settle quickly, while small particles do not travel far and settle slowly, the models provide quantitative results for distances travelled and settling times, which are needed for constructing social distancing policies and workplace protocols.","Zohdi, T.

The current article provides an overview of the cellular mechanisms involved in the pathogenetic roles of PARP1 in ALI and provides an overview of the preclinical data supporting the efficacy of PARP (poly[ADP-ribose] polymerase) inhibitors. In recent years, several ultrapotent PARP inhibitors have been approved for clinical use (for the therapy of various oncological diseases): these newly-approved PARP inhibitors were recently reported to show efficacy in animal models of ALI. These observations offer the possibility of therapeutic repurposing of these inhibitors for patients with ALI. The current article lays out a potential roadmap for such repurposing efforts.

Most deaths occurred in severe and critically cases, but information on prognostic risk factors for severe ill patients is incomplete. Further research is urgently needed to guide clinicians, so we prospectively evaluate the clinical outcomes of 114 severe ill patients with COVID-19 for short-term in the Union Hospital in Wuhan, China. Methods. In this single-centered, prospective and observational study, we enrolled 114 severe ill patients with confirmed COVID-19 from Jan 23, 2020 to February 22, 2020. Epidemiological, demographic and laboratory information were collected at baseline, data on treatment and outcome were collected until the day of death or discharge or for the first 28 days after severe ill diagnosis, whichever was shorter. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard models were used to determine hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of poor outcome. Results. Among enrolled 114 patients, 94 (82.5%) had good outcome while 20 (17.5%) had poor outcome. No significant differences were showed in age, gender and the prevalence of coexisting disorders between outcome groups. Results of multivariate Cox analyses indicated that higher levels of oxygen saturation (HR, 0.123; 95% CI, 0.041-0.369), albumin (HR, 0.060; 95% CI, 0.008-0.460) and arterial partial pressure of oxygen (HR, 0.321; 95% CI, 0.106-0.973) were associated with decreased risk of developing poor outcome within 28 days.

RESULTS: 146 ERCP procedures (common bile duct (CBD) cannulation rate of naïve papilla 89.2%, complete CBD stone extraction rate at first ERCP 88.2%, biliary stricture decompression rate 91%) and 87 EUS procedures (diagnostic accuracy of EUS-fine needle aspiration 92%) were carried out during this period. ERCP-related complications included pancreatitis (4.8%), bleeding (0.68%) and cholangitis (0.68%). 30-day ERCP procedure-related mortality was 0.68%. There were no complications or procedure-related mortality in the EUS group. CONCLUSION: This is the first study looking at the impact of COVID-19 on KPIs and procedure-related complications in ERCP and EUS in the literature. Our study confirms that a high-quality PB endoscopy service can be delivered safely and effectively during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Esmaily, Shiran; Yau, Chia Chuin; Dwarakanath, Deepak; Hancock, John; Mitra, Vikramjit",Frontline Gastroenterol,105,19

The objective of the present study is to further investigate the wind induced inter-flat pollutant transmission and cross contamination routes in typical buildings in Shanghai. In this paper, a set of experiments was carried out in a boundary layer wind tunnel using a 1:30 reduced scale model that represented the typical configuration of rectangular multi-storey residential buildings. Sulfur hexafluoride (SF(6)) was employed as a tracer gas in the wind tunnel tests. Two natural ventilation modes, single-sided ventilation and cross ventilation were considered. The conditions under prevailing wind direction with different source locations on the windward side were compared. The pressure coefficients on all of the building façades and tracer gas concentration distributions were monitored and analysed. The experimental results elucidated that contaminant released from windward units could spread vertically and horizontally to other units on the source façade and downstream units. The source location was a significant influence factor on the pollutant concentration in various units. In the single-sided ventilated building, the infected risks of leeward units were even higher than those in some windward units. In the cross ventilated building, the vertical transmission could be suppressed and the horizontal transmission was reinforced. The study is helpful for further understanding of the inter-flat airborne transmission within an isolated building.","Mu, Di; Shu, Chang; Gao, Naiping; Zhu, Tong",Build Environ,105,26

This disease occurrs the first day after hatching and lasts more than 30 days, resulting in approximately 70% morbidity and 30% mortality in broilers. The objective of this study was to isolate and identify the pathogens that are responsible for the progressive pneumonia and establish an animal model for drug screening. RESULTS: 193 serum samples were collected from 8 intensive farms from 5 provinces in China and analysed in the current research. Our clinical survey showed that 65.2% to 100% of breeding broilers, breeding layers, broilers and laying hens were seropositive for ORT antibodies. From 8 intensive farms, six ORT isolates were identified by PCR and biochemical assays, and two H9N2 viruses were isolated. Newcastle Disease Virus (NDV) and Infectious BronchitisVirus (IBV) were excluded. Typical pneumonia and airsacculitis were observed both in broilers inoculated intraperitoneally with an ORT isolate alone and in those co-infected with ORT and H9N2 virus isolates. Specifically, the survival rate was 30%, 20%, 70%, 50% and 90% in birds inoculated with ORT+H9N2 virus, ORT followed by H9N2 virus, H9N2 virus followed by ORT, and ORT or H9N2 virus alone, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that ORT infections of domestic poultry have been occurring frequently in China. ORT infection can induce higher economic losses and mortality if H9N2 AIV is also present. Although the isolation of ORT and H9N2 virus has been reported previously, there have been no reported co-infections of poultry with these two pathogens. This is the first report of co-infection of broilers with ORT and H9N2 virus, and this co-infection is probably associated with the outbreak of broiler airsacculitis in China, which has caused extensive economic losses.","Pan, Qing; Liu, Aijing; Zhang, Faming; Ling, Yong; Ou, Changbo; Hou, Na; He, Cheng",BMC Vet Res,105,1

From February 9, all blood establishments in Hubei province, China, implemented nucleic acid testing (NAT) for SARS‐CoV‐2 RNA among blood donors to ensure blood safety. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Nucleic acid test screening individually (ID) or by minipool (MP) testing was performed according to the manufacturerʼs instructions. Inactivated culture supernatant of SARS‐CoV‐2–infected Vero cells was quantified by droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) and series diluted with negative plasma to evaluate the assayʼs performance. RESULTS: The limit of detection of the kit for MP testing was 62.94 and 33.14 copies/mL for N and ORF1ab region, respectively. ID testing could achieve 3.87 and 4.85 copies/mL for two regions using 1600 μL of plasma. Coefficients of variations of two different concentrations of reference samples were all less than 5% in MP testing. As of April 30, 2020, a total of 98,342 blood donations including 87,095 whole blood donations and 11,247 platelet donations were tested by ID or MP testing, and no RNAemia was found. In addition, Hubei province suffered precipitously decreased blood supply, especially in February: 86% reduction compared with the same period of 2019. CONCLUSION: Nucleic acid test screening of SARS‐CoV‐2 on blood donations is suitable in blood establishments using the commercial real‐time PCR detection kit based on available instruments. The negative result indicated that SARS‐CoV‐2 appears to be no direct threat to blood safety but raises some serious issues for general blood supply.","Chang, Le; Yan, Ying; Zhao, Lei; Hu, Guibin; Deng, Lijuan; Su, Dan; Peng, Dongju; Nie, Xinjiao; Wang, Song; Li, Yuanyuan; Wang, Jundao; Ruan, Zhong; Gao, Shouliang; Yang, Huasong; Guo, Fei; Wang, Lunan",Transfusion,105,20

In response to the onset of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, multidisciplinary pain clinics either rapidly built telehealth infrastructure from the ground up or ramped up existing services. As the use of telehealth increases, it is critical to develop data collection frameworks that guide implementation. This applied review provides a theoretically-based approach to capitalize on existing data sources and collect novel data to inform virtually delivered care in the context of pediatric pain care. Reviewed multisource data are (1) healthcare administrative data; (2) electronic chart review; (3) clinical health registries; and (4) stakeholder feedback. Preliminary telehealth data from an interdisciplinary pediatric chronic pain management clinic (PPMC) serving youth ages 8–17 years are presented to illustrate how relevant implementation outcomes can be extracted from multisource data. Multiple implementation outcomes were assessed, including telehealth adoption rates, patient clinical symptoms, and mixed-method patient-report telehealth satisfaction. This manuscript provides an applied roadmap to leverage existing data sources and incorporate stakeholder feedback to guide the implementation of telehealth in pediatric chronic pain settings through and beyond COVID-19. Strengths and limitations of the modeled data collection approach are discussed within the broader context of implementation science.","Richardson, Patricia A.; Parker, Delana M.; Chavez, Krystal; Birnie, Kathryn A.; Krane, Elliot J.; Simons, Laura E.; Cunningham, Natoshia R.; Bhandari, Rashmi P.",Children (Basel),105,2

The findings revealed shortages in staff, particularly direct care providers, were greatly accelerated in rural NHs as the pandemic wore on over time. Conversely, staffing shortages in urban NHs were relatively stable despite the fluctuating COVID-19 cases over the same time period.

However, such interventions come with immense social and economic costs and the relative effectiveness of different mobility restrictions are not well understood. This study analyzed uniquely comprehensive datasets for the entirety of a small country, consisting of serology data, telecoms data, and COVID-19 case reports, in order to examine the relationship between mobility and transmission of COVID-19. Andorra is a small European country where tourism is a large part of the economy. Stringent mobility restrictions were put in place in Spring 2020. Additionally, 91% of the population participated in a voluntary COVID-19 serology testing programme and those data were made available for this study. Furthermore, high resolution telecoms data for the entire population were available for analysis of mobility and proximity patterns. A set of mobility metrics were developed to indicate levels of crowding, stay-at-home rates, trip-making and contact with tourists. Mobility metrics were compared to infection rates across communities and transmission rate over time. Several of these metrics were highly correlated with transmission rate, with a lead time of approximately 18 days, with some metrics more highly correlated than others. There was a stronger correlation for measures of crowding and inter-community trip-making, and a weaker correlation for total trips (including intra-community trips) and stay-at-homes rates.","Doorley, R.

The ‘complexity turn’ has drawn attention to the limitations of relying on causal inference from randomised controlled trials alone for understanding whether, and under which conditions, interventions in complex systems improve health services or the public health, and what mechanisms might link interventions and outcomes. We argue that case study research—currently denigrated as poor evidence—is an under-utilised resource for not only providing evidence about context and transferability, but also for helping strengthen causal inferences when pathways between intervention and effects are likely to be non-linear. MAIN BODY: Case study research, as an overall approach, is based on in-depth explorations of complex phenomena in their natural, or real-life, settings. Empirical case studies typically enable dynamic understanding of complex challenges and provide evidence about causal mechanisms and the necessary and sufficient conditions (contexts) for intervention implementation and effects. This is essential evidence not just for researchers concerned about internal and external validity, but also research users in policy and practice who need to know what the likely effects of complex programmes or interventions will be in their settings. The health sciences have much to learn from scholarship on case study methodology in the social sciences. However, there are multiple challenges in fully exploiting the potential learning from case study research. First are misconceptions that case study research can only provide exploratory or descriptive evidence. Second, there is little consensus about what a case study is, and considerable diversity in how empirical case studies are conducted and reported. Finally, as case study researchers typically (and appropriately) focus on thick description (that captures contextual detail), it can be challenging to identify the key messages related to intervention evaluation from case study reports. CONCLUSION: Whilst the diversity of published case studies in health services and public health research is rich and productive, we recommend further clarity and specific methodological guidance for those reporting case study research for evaluation audiences.","Paparini, Sara; Green, Judith; Papoutsi, Chrysanthi; Murdoch, Jamie; Petticrew, Mark; Greenhalgh, Trish; Hanckel, Benjamin; Shaw, Sara",BMC Med,105,2

The aim of our study was to assess the impact of prolonged lockdown on behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD). METHODS: Between April 30 and June 8, 2020, we interviewed with a telephone-based questionnaire the caregivers of the community-dwelling patients with dementia who had their follow-up visit scheduled from March 9 to May 15 and canceled due to lockdown. Among the information collected, patients’ BPSDs were assessed by the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI). Non-parametric tests to compare differences between NPI scores over time and logistic regression models to explore the impact of different factors on BPSD worsening were performed. RESULTS: A total of 109 visits were canceled and 94/109 caregivers completed the interview. Apathy, irritability, agitation and aggression, and depression were the most common neuropsychiatric symptoms experienced by patients both at baseline and during Covid-19 pandemic. Changes in total NPI and caregiver distress scores between baseline and during lockdown, although statistically significant, were overall modest. The logistic regression model failed to determine predictors of BPSD worsening during lockdown. CONCLUSION: This is one of the first studies to investigate the presence of BPSD during SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and related nationwide lockdown, showing only slight, likely not clinically relevant, differences in BPSD burden, concerning mostly agitation and aggression, anxiety, apathy and indifference, and irritability.

Recent reports suggest the growing trend in vaccine preferential bias in parts of the world but not much data in Europe. The present paper aims to investigate the occurrence of COVID-19 vaccine preferential bias in Europe for effective vaccination planning and pandemic control. Method Data on vaccine-delivered for vaccination campaigns to the EU member states was collected from Eu center for disease control (EUCDC) on the COVID-19 vaccination radar. The data was processed for analysis on MS excel and both descriptive and statistical analysis was done with SPSS version 21. Analysis was performed at 95% CI and statistically, a significant difference was considered at p < 0.05. Results We observed statistically significantly lower vaccine uptake compared to the vaccine delivered doses in the present study (average at 62.678 +/- 3.928%) (p< 0.05, CI = 95%). Great variances in uptake for Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccines (50.927 +/- 4.626 %) compared to Pfizer-Biontech vaccine (86.285 +/- 2.1052 %) were observed compared to a previous prospective study on the wiliness to receive COVID-19 vaccine in the region (75%). Conclusion Public health practitioners and policymakers need to factor in the existence of COVID-19 preferential bias based on vaccine type or manufacturer. This will enable them to introduce policies including public education campaigns on the need to avoid bias on the wiliness to inoculate to enhance vaccine uptake for smooth and effective control of the pandemic.","Adusei-Mensah, F.; Inkum, I.

Several studies already reported different strains and an increase in the mutation rate. Particularly, mutations in SARS-CoV-2 spike-glycoprotein are of great interest as it mediates infection in human and recently approved mRNA vaccines are designed to induce immune responses against it. We analyzed 146,917 SARS-CoV-2 genome assemblies and 2,393 NGS datasets from GISAID, NCBI Virus and NCBI SRA archives focusing on non-synonymous mutations in the spike protein. Only around 13.8% of the samples contained the wild-type spike protein with no variation from the reference. Among the spike protein mutants, we confirmed a low mutation rate exhibiting less than 10 non-synonymous mutations in 99.98% of the analyzed sequences, but the mean and median number of spike protein mutations per sample increased over time. 2,592 distinct variants were found in total. The majority of the observed variants were recurrent, but only nine and 23 recurrent variants were found in at least 0.5% of the mutant genome assemblies and NGS samples, respectively. Further, we found high-confidence subclonal variants in about 15.1% of the NGS data sets with mutant spike protein, which might indicate co-infection with various SARS-CoV-2 strains and/or intra-host evolution. Lastly, some variants might have an effect on antibody binding or T-cell recognition. These findings demonstrate the increasing importance of monitoring SARS-CoV-2 sequences for an early detection of variants that require adaptations in preventive and therapeutic strategies.","Schrörs, Barbara; Gudimella, Ranganath; Bukur, Thomas; Rösler, Thomas; Löwer, Martin; Sahin, Ugur",bioRxiv,105,20

They are readily distinguished on the basis of size, radiolabeling characteristics, and location in relation to the lipid bilayer. The larger glycoprotein is highly labeled by both radiolabeled fucose and glucosamine. This species is found in two forms, GP180 and GP90, with apparent molecular weights of 180,000 and 90,000. GP180 can be converted to GP90 in vitro by treatment of virions with trypsin. Analysis of tryptic digests of GP90 and GP180 give identical peptide patterns. Based on pronase and bromelain sensitivities, GP180/90 is the only protein which is located entirely external to the viral envelope. It appears to comprise the characteristic long, petal-shaped peplomers of the virion. The smaller glycoprotein, GP23, has an apparent molecular weight of 23,000 and is labeled by radiolabeled glucosamine but not by fucose. The level of glucosamine-labeling of GP23 is about 1/10 that of GP180/90. GP23 appears to possess two distinct domains: a smaller, carbohydrate containing region which is found outside the viral envelope, and a larger portion, highly labeled by methionine, which is integrally associated with the viral membrane. A new nomenclature is proposed for the three major coronavirus structural proteins. The two envelope glycoproteins, GP23 and GP180/90 are designated E1 and E2, respectively; the inner core protein, VP50, is designated N.","Sturman, Lawrence S.; Holmes, Kathryn V.",Virology,105,26

Respiratory viruses such as SARS‐CoV‐2 can be transmitted via airborne and fomite routes. The latter requires virion adsorption at abiotic surfaces and most likely involves the SARS‐CoV‐2 spike protein subunit 1 (S1), which is the outermost point of its envelope. Understanding S1 spike protein interaction with fomite surfaces thus represents an important milestone on the road to fighting the spread of COVID‐19. Herein, high‐speed atomic force microscopy (HS‐AFM) is used to monitor the adsorption of the SARS‐CoV‐2 spike protein S1 at Al(2)O(3)(0001) and TiO(2)(100) surfaces in situ. While the single‐crystalline oxide substrates are chosen to model the native surface oxides of Al‐ and Ti‐based fomites, adsorption is studied in electrolytes that mimic the pH and major ionic components of mucosal secretions and saliva, respectively. Quantitative analysis of the obtained HS‐AFM images indicates that S1 spike protein adsorption at these surfaces is mostly governed by electrostatic interactions with possible contributions from van der Waals interactions. It thus proceeds more rapidly at the TiO(2)(100) than at the Al(2)O(3)(0001) surface.","Xin, Yang; Grundmeier, Guido; Keller, Adrian",Adv Nanobiomed Res,105,24

Overdose deaths are likely to rise when people are isolated, social support programs are cut back, and the illicit drug supply is further compromised. Safer opioid distribution in response to a toxic street drug supply is a pragmatic and effective way to reduce overdose deaths. COVID-19 makes such an approach even more urgent and compelling.","Tyndall, Mark",Int J Drug Policy,105,20

Individuals wear masks to prevent the spread of droplets. However, skin barrier damage occurs because of the prolonged use of masks. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the prevalence and associated risk factors of skin injuries among healthcare workers (HCWs) and the general population during the COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: A multicenter cross-sectional study of skin barrier damage caused by wearing masks was conducted using an online questionnaire between December 10 and December 31, 2020. Data regarding demographics, characteristics of facial skin damage, and information on masks were registered. Multivariate logistic regression was used to analyze factors associated with skin barrier damage, and odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were used to establish correlation strength. RESULTS: A total of 1,538 responses were retrieved from 1,700 questionnaires (response rate, 90.47%), and 1,409 questionnaires were valid (effective response rate, 91.61%). The respondents comprised 567 HCWs (40.24%) and 842 individuals from the general population (59.76%). The prevalence of skin injuries was 46.03% among HCWs and 46.20% among the general population. History of chronic skin disease (OR, 6.01; 95% CI, 4.75–7.75), type of mask used (OR, 2.77; 95% CI, 1.95–3.93), daily wearing time (OR, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.36–1.82), and mask replacement cycle (OR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.68–0.86) were associated with skin barrier damage. CONCLUSION: There was a high incidence of skin barrier damage due to prolonged mask use among HCWs and the general population, and treatment and prevention were inadequate. Attention needs to be given to strengthening comprehensive health education and popularization of science.","Wan, Xiao; Lu, Quansheng; Sun, Dandan; Wu, Hong; Jiang, Guan",Dermatology,105,24

It is assumed that these patients would better benefit from a complex training—a combination of endurance, strength, balance, coordination, and flexibility—in order to reduce the loss of muscle strength and mass and improve functional capacity. The aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness and safety of two different complementary resistance and balance training programs during short-term cardiac rehabilitation (CR) in elderly patients after a percutaneous or surgical intervention due to acute coronary syndrome. Materials and Methods: This randomized controlled trial was conducted from January 2020 to February 2021 in one Lithuanian rehabilitation hospital. A total of 63 participants who met the inclusion criteria were randomly assigned to three groups (at the ratio of 1:1:1): control (CG, n = 19), intervention 1 (IG-1, n = 26), and intervention 2 (IG-2, n = 18). All the patients attended a usual inpatient CR program of a mean duration of 18.7 ± 1.7 days, while the patients assigned to the intervention groups (IG-1 and IG-2) additionally received different resistance and balance training programs three days a week. Functional capacity, with 6-minute walk test (6MWT) and cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET), as well as physical performance, with the short physical performance battery (SPPB) test and one repetition maximum test (1RM) for leg press, were assessed at baseline and after CR. Results: The mean age of the participants was 72.9 ± 5.5 years; 73% were men. All parameters of functional capacity and physical performance improved significantly after CR (p < 0.05), except for peak VO(2) that improved only in the IG-1. Comparison of CR effectiveness among the groups revealed no significant differences. Conclusions: All three rehabilitation programs were safe and well tolerated by elderly patients aged ≥65 years as well as improved functional capacity (6-minute walk distance and peak workload) and physical performance (SPPB and 1RM). Complementary resistance and balance training with traditional physical therapy means and exercises with mechanical devices did not show greater benefits for the results of physical performance compared with the usual CR program.","Beigienė, Aurelija; Petruševičienė, Daiva; Barasaitė, Vitalija; Kubilius, Raimondas; Macijauskienė, Jūratė",Medicina (Kaunas),105,28

Current treatment modalities are limited, and total knee replacement surgeries have shown disadvantages, especially for grade II/III OA. The interest in the use of biologics, including umbilical cord (UC)-derived Wharton’s jelly (WJ), has grown in recent years. The results from a preliminary study demonstrated the presence of essential components of regenerative medicine, namely growth factors, cytokines, hyaluronic acid (HA), and extracellular vesicles, including exosomes, in WJ. The proposed study aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of intra-articular injection of UC-derived WJ for the treatment of knee OA symptoms. METHODS: A randomized, controlled, single-blind, multi-center, prospective study will be conducted in which the safety and efficacy of intra-articular administration of UC-derived WJ are compared to HA (control) and saline (placebo control) in patients suffering from grade II/III knee OA. A total of 168 participants with grade II or III knee OA on the KL scale will be recruited across 53 sites in the USA with 56 participants in each arm and followed for 1 year post-injection. Patient satisfaction, Numeric Pain Rating Scale, Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score, 36-Item Short Form Survey (SF-36), and 7-point Likert Scale will be used to assess the participants. Physical exams, X-rays, and MRI with Magnetic Resonance Observation of Cartilage Repair Tissue score will be used to assess improvement in associated anatomy. DISCUSSION: The study results will provide valuable information into the safety and efficacy of intra-articular administration of Wharton’s jelly for grade II/III knee osteoarthritis. The results of this study will also add to the treatment options available for grade II/III OA as well as help facilitate the development of a more focused treatment strategy for patients.

This study explored the prevalence of depressive symptoms (depression hereafter) and its relationship with quality of life (QOL) in clinically stable patients with COVID-19. METHODS: : This was an online survey conducted in COVID-19 patients across five designated isolation hospitals for COVID-19 in Hubei province, China. Depression and QOL were assessed with standardized instruments. RESULTS: : A total of 770 participants were included. The prevalence of depression was 43.1% (95%CI: 39.6%-46.6%). Binary logistic regression analysis found that having family member infected with COVID-19 (OR=1.51, P=0.01), suffering from severe COVID-19 infection (OR=1.67, P=0.03), male gender (OR=0.53, P<0.01), and frequent social media use to obtain COVID-19 related information (OR=0.65, P<0.01) were independently associated with depression. Patients with depression had lower QOL than those without. CONCLUSION: : Depression is highly prevalent in clinically stable patients with COVID-19.

DESIGN/SETTING: A mixed methods design; an observational survey with health and social care professionals and relatives bereaved during the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK, and in-depth interviews with bereaved relatives and professionals were conducted. Data were analysed thematically. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 623 participants completed the survey and interviews were conducted with 19 bereaved relatives and 16 professionals. RESULTS: Many children were not prepared for a death of an important adult during the pandemic. Obstacles to preparing children included families’ lack of understanding about their relative’s declining health; parental belief that not telling children was protecting them from becoming upset; and parents’ uncertainty about how best to prepare their children for the death. Only 10.2% (n=11) of relatives reported professionals asked them about their deceased relative’s relationships with children. This contrasts with 68.5% (n=72) of professionals who reported that the healthcare team asked about patient’s relationships with children. Professionals did not provide families with psychosocial support to facilitate preparation, and resources were less available or inappropriate for families during the pandemic. Three themes were identified: (1) obstacles to telling children a significant adult is going to die, (2) professionals’ role in helping families to prepare children for the death of a significant adult during the pandemic, and (3) how families prepare children for the death of a significant adult. CONCLUSIONS: Professionals need to: provide clear and honest communication about a poor prognosis; start a conversation with families about the dying patient’s significant relationships with children; and reassure families that telling children someone close to them is dying is beneficial for their longer term psychological adjustment.","Rapa, Elizabeth; Hanna, Jeffrey R; Mayland, Catriona R; Mason, Stephen; Moltrecht, Bettina; Dalton, Louise J",BMJ Open,105,20

Using mathematical models, we focus on two aspects: 1) how the vaccination program should be designed to balance the dynamic exit of NPIs; 2) how much the vaccination coverage is needed to avoid a second wave of the epidemics when the NPIs exit in stages. We address this issue globally, and take six countries--China, Brazil, Indonesia, Russia, UK, and US-in our case study. We showed that a dynamic vaccination program in three stages can be an effective approach to balance the dynamic exit of the NPIs in terms of mitigating the epidemics. The vaccination rates and the accumulative vaccination coverage in these countries are estimated by fitting the model to the real data. We observed that the required effective vaccination coverages are greatly different to balance the dynamic exit of NPIs in these countries, providing a quantitative criterion for the requirement of an integrative package of NPIs. We predicted the epidemics under different vaccination rates for these countries, and showed that the vaccination can significantly decrease the peak value of a future wave. Furthermore, we found that a lower vaccination coverage can result in a subsequent wave once the NPIs exit. Therefore, there is a critical (minimum) vaccination coverage, depending on effectiveness of NPIs to avoid a subsequent wave. We estimated the critical vaccination coverages for China, Brazil, and Indonesia under different scenarios. In conclusion, we quantitatively showed that the dynamic vaccination program can be the effective approach to supplement or even eventually replace NPIs in mitigating the epidemics and avoiding future waves, and we suggest that country level-based exit strategies of the NPIs should be considered, according to the possible quarantine rate and testing ability, and the accessibility, affordability and efficiency of the vaccines.","Tang, B.; Liu, P.; Yang, J.; Wu, J.; Xiao, Y.; Tang, S.",,105,16

DESIGN: Case report. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Residents of a 150‐bed SNF. MEASUREMENTS: Heat maps generated by the SNF's infection prevention team to track staff and resident symptoms and SARS‐CoV‐2 test results to identify infection patterns. RESULTS: The SNF experienced a severe outbreak of SARS‐CoV‐2 early in the pandemic. The initial cluster of residents with symptoms and the first confirmed case occurred on the SNF's dementia care unit. The insufficient availability and prolonged turnaround time of testing for both residents and staff at the outset of the outbreak prevented timely and accurate identification and cohorting of cases. Despite extensive other infection control measures being in place, SARS‐CoV‐2 disseminated widely through the facility within 3 weeks of the first confirmed case, resulting in significant morbidity and mortality. CONCLUSION: Early, rapid, universal SARS‐CoV‐2 testing of both SNF residents and staff at the outset of an outbreak and then repeatedly thereafter is critical to mitigate viral transmission. This will become even more important as states relax stay‐at‐home orders and SNF staff intermingle with communities that are increasingly mobile. Increased testing will inevitably result in more staff testing positive and having to self‐quarantine at home, meaning that states must partner with SNFs and other long‐term care providers to coordinate and support strategic staffing reserves that can supplement current frontline staff.","Blackman, Carolyn; Farber, Sharon; Feifer, Richard A.; Mor, Vincent; White, Elizabeth M.",J Am Geriatr Soc,105,16

An immunoglobulin-Y (IGY) additive developed to target Fusobacterium necrophorum and Trueperella pyogenes, was evaluated for the control of liver abscesses. Research is needed for the impact of liver abscess severity as well as abscess duration on steer performance and carcass characteristics. Holstein steers (n = 64; initial body weight (BW) = 372.5 ± 2.41 kg) consuming a finishing diet for 188 d were used in a completely randomized design where treatments included: TYL (tylosin phosphate 90 mg/d; n = 32) or IGY (2.5 g/d; n = 32) and steer was the experimental unit. Feed intake was recorded daily while BW and liver ultrasound outcome (normal or abnormal) was recorded every 28 d until slaughter to estimate duration of abscess presence (DUR). Continuous variables of animal growth performance and carcass characteristics were analyzed using the MIXED procedure of SAS. Categorical quality grade and liver data were analyzed using the GLIMMIX procedure of SAS. Treatment did not affect live or carcass-adjusted growth performance (P ≥ 0.131). However, steers fed TYL had greater (P = 0.042) empty body fat (EBF) % and a greater proportion of carcasses grading premium choice than steers fed IGY (P = 0.030). Treatment did not affect prevalence of abscessed livers, abscess severity or estimated abscess duration (P ≥ 0.213) but datasets with greater experimental units are needed to substantiate this outcome. Increasing abscess severity tended (P ≤ 0.10) to linearly reduce carcass-adjusted gain to feed (G:F), fat thickness, and EBF. Carcass dressing % was only affected by severe (A+ and A+AD) abscess scores (P = 0.010). Carcass-adjusted final BW, average daily gain, G:F, and hot carcass weight was decreased only when the estimated DUR was ≥140 d (P ≤ 0.05). Carcass dressing %, however, was linearly affected by estimated liver abscess DUR (P ≤ 0.005), regardless of abscess severity. Preliminary evidence suggests that measuring the duration of liver abscess affliction during the feeding period may also give insight to the degree of performance reduction.","Stotz, Miranda K; Henry, Darren D; Crossland, Whitney L",Transl Anim Sci,105,28
686257,686257,686257,Innate Immunity to Respiratory Infection in Early Life,12.340905,7.487383,2017-11-14,"BACKGROUND: Obesity is a major public health problem globally and in Europe. The prevalence of childhood obesity is also soaring. Several parameters of the living environment are contributing to this increase, such as the density of fast food retailers, and thus, preventive health policies against childhood obesity must focus on the environment to which children are exposed. Currently, there are no systems in place to objectively measure the effect of living environment parameters on obesogenic behaviors and obesity. The H2020 project “BigO: Big Data Against Childhood Obesity” aims to tackle childhood obesity by creating new sources of evidence based on big data. OBJECTIVE: This paper introduces the Obesity Prevention dashboard (OPdashboard), implemented in the context of BigO, which offers an interactive data platform for the exploration of objective obesity-related behaviors and local environments based on the data recorded using the BigO mHealth (mobile health) app. METHODS: The OPdashboard, which can be accessed on the web, allows for (1) the real-time monitoring of children’s obesogenic behaviors in a city area, (2) the extraction of associations between these behaviors and the local environment, and (3) the evaluation of interventions over time. More than 3700 children from 33 schools and 2 clinics in 5 European cities have been monitored using a custom-made mobile app created to extract behavioral patterns by capturing accelerometer and geolocation data. Online databases were assessed in order to obtain a description of the environment. The dashboard’s functionality was evaluated during a focus group discussion with public health experts. RESULTS: The preliminary association outcomes in 2 European cities, namely Thessaloniki, Greece, and Stockholm, Sweden, indicated a correlation between children’s eating and physical activity behaviors and the availability of food-related places or sports facilities close to schools. In addition, the OPdashboard was used to assess changes to children’s physical activity levels as a result of the health policies implemented to decelerate the COVID-19 outbreak. The preliminary outcomes of the analysis revealed that in urban areas the decrease in physical activity was statistically significant, while a slight increase was observed in the suburbs. These findings indicate the importance of the availability of open spaces for behavioral change in children. Discussions with public health experts outlined the dashboard’s potential to aid in a better understanding of the interplay between children’s obesogenic behaviors and the environment, and improvements were suggested. CONCLUSIONS: Our analyses serve as an initial investigation using the OPdashboard. Additional factors must be incorporated in order to optimize its use and obtain a clearer understanding of the results. The unique big data that are available through the OPdashboard can lead to the implementation of models that are able to predict population behavior. The OPdashboard can be considered as a tool that will increase our understanding of the underlying factors in childhood obesity and inform the design of regional interventions both for prevention and treatment.","Filos, Dimitris; Lekka, Irini; Kilintzis, Vasileios; Stefanopoulos, Leandros; Karavidopoulou, Youla; Maramis, Christos; Diou, Christos; Sarafis, Ioannis; Papapanagiotou, Vasileios; Alagialoglou, Leonidas; Ioakeimidis, Ioannis; Hassapidou, Maria; Charmandari, Evangelia; Heimeier, Rachel; O'Malley, Grace; O’Donnell, Shane; Doyle, Gerardine; Delopoulos, Anastasios; Maglaveras, Nicos",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,105,0

The COVID‐19 outbreak is unique in its rapid transmission and results in heavy stress for the front‐line health care workers (HCWs). The current study aimed to exam posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSSs) of HCWs fighting for the COVID‐19 and to evaluate their sleep quality after 1‐month stressful suffering. Three hundred seventy‐seven HCWs working in different provinces of China participated in the survey between February 1 and 5. The demographic information was collected first. Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist for DSM‐5 (PCL‐5) and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) were selected to measure PTSSs and sleep quality. Results showed that 1 month after the outbreak, the prevalence of PTSSs was 3.8% in HCWs. Female HCWs were more vulnerable to PTSSs with hazard ratio of 2.136 (95% CI = 1.388–3.286). HCWs with higher exposure level also significantly rated more hyperarousal symptoms (hazard ratio = 4.026, 95% CI = 1.233–13.140). There was a significant difference of sleep quality between participants with and without PTSSs (z value = 6.014, p < .001) and among different groups with various contact frequencies (chi‐square = 7.307, p = .026). Path analysis showed that there was a significant indirect effect from exposure level to PTSSs through sleep quality (coefficient = 1.750, 95% CI of Boostroop test = 0.543–2.998). In summary, targeted interventions on sleep contribute to the mental recovery during the outbreak of COVID‐19. Understanding the mental health response after a public health emergency might help HCWs and communities prepare for a population's response to disaster.","Yin, Qianlan; Sun, Zhuoer; Liu, Tuanjie; Ni, Xiong; Deng, Xuanfeng; Jia, Yanpu; Shang, Zhilei; Zhou, Yaoguang; Liu, Weizhi",Clin Psychol Psychother,105,16

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively enrolled 187 patients with COVID-19 treated at Tongji Hospital of Tongji Medical College from February 15, 2020, to February 29, 2020. Demographic data, imaging characteristics, and clinical data were collected, and based on the clinical classification of severity, patients were divided into groups 1 (mild) and 2 (severe/critical). A semiquantitative visual score was used to estimate the lesion extent. A three-dimensional slicer was used to precisely quantify the volume and CT value of the lung and lesions. Correlation coefficients of the quantitative CT parameters, semiquantitative visual score, and clinical classification were calculated using Spearman's correlation. A receiver operating characteristic curve was used to compare the accuracies of quantitative and semi-quantitative methods. RESULTS: There were 59 patients in group 1 and 128 patients in group 2. The mean age and sex distribution of the two groups were not significantly different. The lesions were primarily located in the subpleural area. Compared to group 1, group 2 had larger values for all volume-dependent parameters (p < 0.001). The percentage of lesions had the strongest correlation with disease severity with a correlation coefficient of 0.495. In comparison, the correlation coefficient of semiquantitative score was 0.349. To classify the severity of COVID-19, area under the curve of the percentage of lesions was the highest (0.807; 95% confidence interval, 0.744–0.861: p < 0.001) and that of the quantitative CT parameters was significantly higher than that of the semiquantitative visual score (p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: The classification accuracy of quantitative CT parameters was significantly superior to that of semiquantitative visual score in terms of evaluating the severity of COVID-19.","Yin, Xi; Min, Xiangde; Nan, Yan; Feng, Zhaoyan; Li, Basen; Cai, Wei; Xi, Xiaoqing; Wang, Liang",Korean J Radiol,105,20

These pathways dampen the immune response by providing brakes on activated T cells, thereby ensuring more uniform and controlled immune reactions and avoiding immune hyper-responsiveness and autoimmunity. Cancer cells often exploit these regulatory controls through a variety of immune subversion mechanisms, which facilitate immune escape and tumor survival. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) effectively block negative regulatory signals, thereby augmenting immune attack and tumor killing. This process is a double-edged sword in which release of regulatory controls is felt to be responsible for both the therapeutic efficacy of ICI therapy and the driver of immune-related adverse events (IrAEs). These adverse immune reactions are common, typically low-grade and may affect virtually every organ system. In the early clinical trials, lung IrAEs were rarely described. However, with ever-expanding clinical applications and more complex ICI-containing regimens, lung events, in particular, pneumonitis, have become increasingly recognized. ICI-related lung injury is clinically distinct from other types of lung toxicity and may lead to death in advanced stage disease. Thus, knowledge regarding the key characteristics and optimal treatment of lung-IrAEs is critical to good outcomes. This review provides an overview of lung-IrAEs, including risk factors and epidemiology, as well as clinical, radiologic, and histopathologic features of ICI-related lung injury. Management principles for ICI-related lung injury, including current consensus on steroid refractory pneumonitis and the use of other immune modulating agents in this setting are also highlighted.","Shannon, Vickie R.; Anderson, Ronald; Blidner, Ada; Choi, Jennifer; Cooksley, Tim; Dougan, Michael; Glezerman, Ilya; Ginex, Pamela; Girotra, Monica; Gupta, Dipti; Johnson, Douglas B.; Suarez-Almazor, Maria E.; Rapoport, Bernardo L.",Support Care Cancer,105,14

A key priority in patients with dementia is the identification of early modifiable factors that can slow the progression of the disease. Community pharmacies are suitable points for cognitive-impairment screening because of their proximity to patients. Therefore, the continuous training of professionals working in pharmacies directly impacts the public health of the population. The main purpose of this study was to assess community pharmacists’ knowledge of dementia-related factors. Thus, we conducted a cross-sectional study of 361 pharmacists via an online questionnaire that quizzed their knowledge of a list of dementia-related factors, which we later arranged into the A-to-Z Dementia Knowledge List. We found that younger participants had a better knowledge of risk factors associated with dementia. The risk factors most often identified were a family history of dementia followed by social isolation. More than 40% of the respondents did not identify herpes labialis, sleep more than 9 h per day, and poor hearing as risk factors. A higher percentage of respondents were better able to identify protective factors than risk factors. The least known protective factors were internet use, avoidance of pollution, and the use of anti-inflammatory drugs. Pharmacists’ knowledge of dementia-related factors should be renewed with the aim of enhancing their unique placement to easily implement cognitive-impairment screening.","Ramos, Hernán; Moreno, Lucrecia; Gil, María; García-Lluch, Gemma; Sendra-Lillo, José; Alacreu, Mónica",Int J Environ Res Public Health,105,10

Methods WLHIV ≥ age 30 years underwent self-collected (clinic and home) and clinician-collected HPV tests. Sensitivity and specificity analyses were performed using clinician-collected HPV test as the comparator. Unweighted kappa statistic evaluated validity and reliability of self-collected HPV test, and level of agreement between clinician-collected mRNA test and an DNA test that was used for routine care. A 13-question survey assessed acceptability. Results Among 70 participants, median age was 50, 75% had an undetectable HIV RNA, and 11% had a CD4 count <200. Nearly 63% had at least one positive HPV test. The sensitivity and specificity for the self-collected HPV test were 84.6% (95% CI: 65.1%, 95.6%) and 62.9% (95% CI: 44.9%, 78.5%), respectively; κ = 0.5 (95% CI: 0.2, 0.7). The agreement between the two self-collected tests was good (κ = 0.8, 95% CI: 0.5, 1,0). There was good agreement between clinician-collected mRNA tests and DNA tests (κ = 0.8, 95% CI: 0.7, 1.0). Self-collection was highly acceptable. Conclusions Among WLHIV, self-collected HPV tests had good sensitivity and moderate specificity compared to clinician-collected HPV tests. The reliability between self-collected testing locations was good. Self-collected HPV testing had high acceptability.","Wang, Runzhi; Lee, Kristen; Gaydos, Charlotte A.; Anderson, Jean; Keller, Jean; Coleman, Jenell",Int J Infect Dis,105,16

Methods: Five databases were screened from inception to 27-Aug-2020. The effects of specific drug interventions on safety and efficacy were assessed in COVID-19 patients. Risk Ratios (RRs) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were pooled using random-effects models. Results: A total of 10 studies were identified which fulfill the inclusion criteria. Patients taking antivirals had 26% less risk of having a severe adverse event (SAE) compared to controls (RR, 0.74, CI:0.62 to 0.89, P=0.002). Clinical improvement at day 14 was observed among the cases treated with antivirals compared to the control group (RR 1.24, CI: 1.00 to 1.53 p=0.05). Conclusion: There is evidence that Remdesivir and LPV/r reduces the hospital length of stay and that patients to which antivirals were administered had less SAE and improvement when compared to patients not prescribed with antivirals. Due to a lack of power and the quality of the studies, it was not possible to determine which antivirals have a greater risk-benefit balance, and therefore the optimal approach to antiviral treatment is still uncertain.

In this article, we introduce NAIRA, a Multimodal Learning Analytics platform that provides Real-Time Feedback to foster collaborative learning activities’ efficiency. NAIRA provides real-time visualizations for students’ verbal interactions when working in groups, allowing teachers to perform precise interventions to ensure learning activities’ correct execution. We present a case study with 24 undergraduate subjects performing a remote collaborative learning activity based on the Jigsaw learning technique within the COVID-19 pandemic context. The main goals of the study are (1) to qualitatively describe how the teacher used NAIRA’s visualizations to perform interventions and (2) to identify quantitative differences in the number and time between students’ spoken interactions among two different stages of the activity, one of them supported by NAIRA’s visualizations. The case study showed that NAIRA allowed the teacher to monitor and facilitate the learning activity’s supervised stage execution, even in a remote learning context, with students working in separate virtual classrooms with their video cameras off. The quantitative comparison of spoken interactions suggests the existence of differences in the distribution between the monitored and unmonitored stages of the activity, with a more homogeneous speaking time distribution in the NAIRA supported stage.","Cornide-Reyes, Hector; Riquelme, Fabián; Monsalves, Diego; Noel, Rene; Cechinel, Cristian; Villarroel, Rodolfo; Ponce, Francisco; Munoz, Roberto",Sensors (Basel),105,16

Yet, the resources needed to provide rehabilitation treatment are expected to be inadequate because healthcare systems faced a shortage of high-quality treatment of these symptoms already before the COVID-19 crisis emerged in patients with comparable needs. In this viewpoint, we discuss the potential of Virtual Reality (VR) administering fast, tailor-made rehabilitation at a distance, and offering a solution for the impending surge of demand for rehabilitation after COVID-19. VR consists of a head-mounted display (HMD) that can bring the user by computer-generated visuals into an immersive, realistic multi-sensory environment. Several studies on VR show its potential for rehabilitation and suggest VR to be beneficial in post-COVID-19. The immersion of VR may increase therapy adherence and may distract the patient from experienced fatigue and anxiety. Barriers still have to be overcome to easily implement VR in healthcare. We argue that embedding VR in virtual care platforms would assist in overcoming these barriers and would stimulate the spread of VR therapy, both for post-COVID-19 patients in the present and possibly for other patients with similar rehabilitation needs in the future.","Smits, Merlijn; Staal, J Bart; van Goor, Harry",BMJ Open Sport Exerc Med,105,21

Data from the early months suggest that acute care patient populations deferred presenting to the emergency department (ED), portending more severe disease at the time of presentation. Additionally, care for this patient population trended towards initial non-operative management. AIM: To examine the presentation, management, and outcomes of patients who developed gallbladder disease or appendicitis during the pandemic. METHODS: A retrospective chart review of patients diagnosed with acute cholecystitis, symptomatic cholelithiasis, or appendicitis in two EDs affiliated with a single tertiary academic medical center in Northern California between March and June, 2020 and in the same months of 2019. Patients were selected through a research repository using international classification of diseases (ICD)-9 and ICD-10 codes. Across both years, 313 patients were identified with either type of gallbladder disease, while 361 patients were identified with acute appendicitis. The primary outcome was overall incidence of disease. Secondary outcomes included presentation, management, complications, and 30-d re-presentation rates. Relationships between different variables were explored using Pearson’s r correlation coefficient. Variables were compared using the Welch’s t-Test, Chi-squared tests, and Fisher’s exact test as appropriate. RESULTS: Patients with gallbladder disease and appendicitis both had more severe presentations in 2020. With respect to gallbladder disease, more patients in the COVID-19 cohort presented with acute cholecystitis compared to the control cohort [50% (80) vs 35% (53); P = 0.01]. Patients also presented with more severe cholecystitis in 2020 as indicated by higher mean Tokyo Criteria Scores [mean (SD) 1.39 (0.56) vs 1.16 (0.44); P = 0.02]. With respect to appendicitis, more patients were diagnosed with a perforated appendix at presentation in 2020 [20% (36) vs 16% (29); P = 0.02] and a greater percentage were classified as emergent cases using the emergency severity index [63% (112) vs 13% (23); P < 0.001]. While a greater percentage of patients were admitted to the hospital for gallbladder disease in 2020 [65% (104) vs 50% (76); P = 0.02], no significant differences were observed in hospital admissions for patients with appendicitis. No significant differences were observed in length of hospital stay or operative rate for either group. However, for patients with appendicitis, 30-d re-presentation rates were significantly higher in 2020 [13% (23) vs 4% (8); P = 0.01]. CONCLUSION: During the COVID-19 pandemic, patients presented with more severe gallbladder disease and appendicitis.

In contrast to drugs in current trials, which have been derived overwhelmingly from studies on taxonomically unrelated RNA viruses, a number of untested small molecule antivirals had previously demonstrated remarkable in vitro specificity for SARS‐CoV or MERS‐CoV, with high selectivity indices, EC(50), and/or IC(50). Due to the rapid containment of the prior epidemics, however, these were generally not followed up with in vivo animal studies or clinical investigations, and thus largely overlooked as treatment prospects in the current COVID‐19 trials.

To understand more about these functions in the context of PEDV M protein, forty host cell proteins interacting with the M protein were identified in the present study by exploiting the proximity-labeling enzyme APEX2 (a mutant soybean ascorbate peroxidase). Bioinformatic analysis showed that the identified host cell proteins were related to fifty-four signal pathways and a wide diversity of biological processes. Interaction between M and five of the identified proteins (RIG-I, PPID, NHE-RF1, S100A11, CLDN4) was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP). In addition, knockdown of PPID and S100A11 genes by siRNA significantly improved virus production, indicating that the proteins encoded by the two genes were interfering with or down-regulating virus replication in infected cells. Identification of the host cell proteins accomplished in this study provides new information about the mechanisms underlying PEDV replication and immune evasion. SIGNIFICANCE: PEDV M protein is an essential structural protein implicated in viral infection, replication and assembly although the precise mechanisms underlying these functions remain enigmatic. In this study, we have identified 40 host cell proteins that interact with PEDV M protein using the proximity-labeling enzyme APEX2. Co-immunoprecipitation subsequently confirmed interactions between PEDV M protein and five host cell proteins, two of which (S100A11 and PPID) were involved in down-regulating virus replication in infected cells. This study is significant in that it formulates a strategy to provide new information about the mechanisms relating to the novel functions of PEDV M protein.","Dong, Shijuan; Wang, Ruiyang; Yu, Ruisong; Chen, Bingqing; Si, Fusheng; Xie, Chunfang; Li, Zhen",J Proteomics,105,20

Infectious bronchitis virus is classified into different serotypes and genotypes (vaccine strains and field variants). This study aimed to evaluate the occurrence of IBV in commercial poultry flocks from 3 important producing regions in Brazil and to determine the tropism of the main circulating genotypes to 3 different avian physiological systems (respiratory, digestive, urinary/reproductive). Clinical samples with suggestive signs of IBV infection were collected from 432 different poultry commercial flocks (198 from broilers and 234 from breeders). The total number of biological samples consisted of organ pools from the 3 above physiological systems obtained of farms from 3 important producing regions: midwest, northeast, and south. Infectious bronchitis virus was detected by reverse-transcription, real-time PCR of the 5′ untranslated region. The results showed 179 IBV-positive flocks (41.4% of the flocks), with 107 (24.8%) from broilers and 72 (16.8%) from breeders. There were similar frequencies of IBV-positive flocks in farms from different regions of the country, most often in broilers (average 54%) compared with breeders (average 30.8%). reverse-transcription was more frequently detected in the digestive system of breeders (40%), and in the digestive (43.5%) and respiratory (37.7%) systems of broilers. Infectious bronchitis virus genotyping was performed by a reverse-transcription nested PCR and sequencing of the S1 gene from a selection of 79 IBV-positive flocks (45 from broilers and 34 from breeders). The majority of the flocks were infected with Brazilian variant genotype than with Massachusetts vaccine genotype. These results demonstrate the predominance of the Brazilian variant (mainly in the enteric tract) in commercial poultry flocks from 3 important producing regions in Brazil.","Balestrin, Eder; Fraga, Aline P.; Ikuta, Nilo; Canal, Cláudio W.; Fonseca, André S.
