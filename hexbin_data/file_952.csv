Here, we examine the political consequences of the COVID-19 epidemic using granular data on COVID-19 fatalities and the attitudes of the American public. We find that COVID-19 has led to substantial damage for President Trump and other Republican candidates. States and local areas with higher levels of COVID-19 fatalities are less likely to support President Trump and Republican candidates for House and Senate. Our results show that President Trump and other Republican candidates would benefit electorally from a reduction in COVID-19 fatalities. This implies that a greater emphasis on social distancing, masks, and other mitigation strategies would benefit the president and his allies.","Warshaw, Christopher; Vavreck, Lynn; Baxter-King, Ryan",Sci.

While available data suggest that school-aged children are not significant spreaders of SARS-CoV-2, the possibility of transmission in schools remains an ongoing concern, especially among an aging teaching workforce. Even in low-prevalence settings, communities must balance the potential risk of transmission with the need for students' ongoing education. Through the roll out of high-throughput school-based SARS-CoV-2 testing, enhanced follow-up for individuals exposed to COVID-19 and wellbeing surveys, this study investigates the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 transmission and the current psychosocial wellbeing impacts of the pandemic in school communities. Methods: The DETECT Schools Study is a prospective observational cohort surveillance study in 79 schools across Western Australia (WA), Australia. To investigate the incidence, transmission and impact of SARS-CoV-2 in schools, the study comprises three ""modules"": Module 1) Spot-testing in schools to screen for asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2; Module 2) Enhanced surveillance of close contacts following the identification of any COVID-19 case to determine the secondary attack rate of SARS-CoV-2 in a school setting; and Module 3) Survey monitoring of school staff, students and their parents to assess psycho-social wellbeing following the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in WA.

Here we evaluated a panel of biomarkers to phenotype patients and to define the role of immuno-inflammatory mediators as biomarkers of severity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Serum samples were obtained from 24 COVID-19 patients on admission to hospital, before any treatment or infusion of intravenous steroids or invasive ventilation. KL-6 IL-6 and C-peptide were measured by chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay. IL-6 assay was validated for accuracy and precision. The validity of variables used to distinguish severe from mild-to-moderate patients was assessed by areas under curves (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and logistic regression was performed to combine parameters of the two groups. RESULTS: In the severe group, IL-6, CRP and KL-6 concentrations were significantly higher than in mild-to-moderate patients. KL-6, IL-6 and CRP concentrations were directly correlated with each other. ROC curve analysis of the logistic regression model including IL-6, KL-6 and CRP showed the best performance with an AUC of 0.95. CONCLUSIONS: Besides corroborating previous reports of over-expression of IL-6 in severe COVID-19 patients requiring mechanical ventilation, analytical determination of other mediators showed that IL-6 concentrations were correlated with those of KL-6 and CRP. The combination of these three prognostic bioindicators made it possible to distinguish severe COVID-19 patients with poor prognosis from mild-to-moderate patients.","Bergantini, L; Bargagli, E; d039,; Alessandro, M; Refini, R M; Cameli, P; Galasso, L; Scapellato, C; Montagnani, F; Scolletta, S; Franchi, F; Valente, S; Bennett, D; Sebastiani, G; Frediani, B; Dotta, F",Cytokine,952,25

This process has been compared with atherosclerosis because of shared pathology and risk factors. In this study, we aimed to elucidate the role of inflammation triggered by cholesterol infiltration and cholesterol crystals formation causing mechanical and biochemical injury in heart valves. METHODS: Human and atherosclerotic rabbit heart valves were evaluated. New Zealand White male rabbits were fed an enriched cholesterol diet alone or with simvastatin and ezetimibe simultaneous or after 6 months of initiating cholesterol diet. Inflammation was measured using C-reactive protein (CRP) and RAM 11 of tissue macrophage content. Cholesterol crystal presence and content in valves was evaluated using scanning electron microscopy. RESULTS: Cholesterol diet alone induced cholesterol infiltration of valves with associated increased inflammation. Tissue cholesterol, CRP levels and RAM 11 were significantly lower in simvastatin and ezetimibe rabbit groups compared with cholesterol diet alone. However, the treatment was effective only when initiated with a cholesterol diet but not after lipid infiltration in valves. Aortic valve cholesterol content was significantly greater than all other cardiac valves. Extensive amounts of cholesterol crystals were noted in rabbit valves on cholesterol diet and in diseased human valves. CONCLUSIONS: Prevention of valve infiltration with cholesterol and reduced inflammation by simvastatin and ezetimibe was effective only when given during the initiation of high cholesterol diet but was not effective when given following infiltration of cholesterol into the valve matrix.","El-Khatib, Layan A; De Feijter-Rupp, Heather; Janoudi, Abed; Fry, Levi; Kehdi, Michael; Abela, George S",,952,16

Arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) and tunnel-cuffed venous catheters (tCVC) are commonly used vascular access routes and have advantages and disadvantages compared to each other. This study focuses on the effects of AVFs and tCVCs on morbidity and mortality in hemodialysis patients. METHODS: The records (between January 2015 and January 2017) of 110 patients (55 patients with AVF and 55 patients with tCVC) under hemodialysis therapy for at least 6 months were evaluated retrospectively. The data about blood tests, hospitalizations, and mortality were compared between patients with AVF and tCVC. FINDINGS: Fifty-five patients (25 male, 58 ± 14 years old) were undergoing hemodialysis via AVF. Fifty-five patients (17 male, 63 ± 14 years old) were undergoing hemodialysis via tunneled CVCs. Thirty (54.5%) of the hospitalization patients had AVF and 46 (83.6%) had CVCs (p < 0.01). The only independent predictor of hospitalization was the use of tCVC as vascular access, according to multivariate regression analysis (p = 0.01). Seven (30%) of the dead patients had AVF and 16 (69.6%) had CVCs (p = 0.035). Use of tCVC appeared to be a mortality predictor in univariate regression analysis (p = 0.039). But the significance did not continue in multivariate model (p = 0.578) in which the duration of hemodialysis appeared as the only significant factor (p = 0.002). CONCLUSION: Patients undergoing hemodialysis via AVF had fewer all-cause hospitalizations and mortality rate than those using tunneled CVCs.","Celik, Serhat; Gok Oguz, Ebru; Ulusal Okyay, Gulay; Selen, Tamer; Ayli, Mehmet Deniz",Int J Artif Organs,952,30

MATERIAL AND METHODS We conducted an epidemiological investigation enrolling 631 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from our clinic from January to March 2020. Patients' information was collected through a standard questionnaire. Then, we described the patients' epidemiological characteristics, analyzed risk factors associated with disease severity, and assessed causes of zero mortality. Additionally, some key technologies for epidemic prevention and control were identified. RESULTS Of the 631 patients, 8.46% (n=53) were severe cases, and no deaths were recorded (n=0). The epidemic of COVID-19 has gone through 4 stages: a sporadic phase, an exponential growth phase, a peak plateau phase, and a declining phase. The proportion of severe cases was significantly different among the 4 stages and 13 municipal prefectures (P<0.001). Factors including age >65 years old, underlying medical conditions, highest fever >39.0°C, dyspnea, and lymphocytopenia (<1.0×109/L) were early warning signs of disease severity (P<0.05). In contrast, earlier clinic visits were associated with better patient outcomes (P=0.029). Further, the viral load was a potentially useful marker associated with COVID-19 infection severity. CONCLUSIONS The study findings from the beginning of the COVID-19 epidemic in Jiangsu Province, China showed that patients who were more than 65 years of age and with comorbidities and presented with a fever of more than 39.0°C developed more severe disease.

Exploring Young People's Experiences of the COVID-19 Pandemic in North East England: A Qualitative Diary-Based Study,23.26285,1.9653907,2021,"India has witnessed a high number of COVID-19 cases, but mortality has been quite low, and most cases have been asymptomatic or mild. In early April, we had hypothesized a low COVID-19 mortality in India, based on the concept of cross-immunity. The presence of cross-immunity is presumed to lead to a milder course of disease and allow the time necessary for the development of adaptive immunity by the body to eliminate the virus. Evidence supporting our hypothesis has started showing up. Multiple studies have shown the generation of different T cell subsets and B cells responding to epitopes of viral proteins, especially of the spike protein, as a part of adaptive immunity against SARS-CoV-2. Cross-reactive T-cells have been demonstrated in patients who have been previously exposed to endemic coronaviruses. The interplay of cross-immunity and herd immunity is apparent in the COVID-19 scenario in India from the presence of a large number of asymptomatic or mild cases, a low infection-fatality ratio and a generally flat curve of percentage positivity of cases with respect to total testing, both in periods of strict lock-down and step-wise unlocking. It seems that cross-immunity resulted in faster generation of herd immunity. Although the initial restrictive measures such as lockdown prevented the rapid spread of the outbreak, further extension of such measures and overly expensive ones such as enhanced testing in India will result in a huge burden on the health economics as well as the society. Hence, we propose a restructuring of the health services and approach to COVID-19. The restructured health services should move away from indiscriminate testing, isolation and quarantine, and instead, the emphasis should be on improving facilities for testing and management of only critical COVID cases and the replacement of complete lockdowns by the selective isolation and quarantine of susceptible persons such as the aged and those with co-morbidities. In the process of describing India-specific plans, we emphasize why the development of country-specific plans for tackling epidemics is important, instead of adopting a ""one policy fits all"" approach.","Chakrabarti, Sankha Shubhra; Kaur, Upinder; Singh, Anup; Chakrabarti, Suddhachitta; Krishnatreya, Manigreeva; Agrawal, Bimal Kumar; Mittal, Amit; Singh, Amit; Khanna, Rahul; Gambhir, Indrajeet Singh; Jin, Kunlin; Chakrabarti, Sasanka",Aging Dis,952,25

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we aim to evaluate the association between the elevated CK and severity and mortality in COVID-19. METHODS: We performed a systematic literature search on PubMed, Scopus, and Embase up until January 26, 2020. The main outcome was poor outcome, a composite of mortality and severe COVID-19. RESULTS: There are 2471 patients from 14 studies included in this systematic review and meta-analysis. The incidence of elevated CK in this pooled analysis was 17% (11%, 22%) and the incidence of poor outcome in this pooled analysis was 27% (19%, 34%). Elevated CK was associated with poor outcome in patients with COVID-19 (OR 3.01 [2.21, 4.10], p < 0.001; I2: 10.2%). The effect estimate did not vary with age (p = 0.610), male (p = 0.449), hypertension (p = 0.490), and diabetes (p = 0.457). Elevated CK has a sensitivity of 0.24 (0.17, 0.32), specificity of 0.91 (0.86, 0.94), PLR of 2.6 (1.9, 3.7), NLR of 0.84 (0.78, 0.90), DOR of 3 (2, 5), and AUC of 0.62 (0.57, 0.66) for predicting poor outcome in patients with COVID-19. In this pooled analysis, elevated CK confers to a 49% probability for poor outcome and a non-elevated CK confers to a 24% probability. Subgroup analysis and univariate meta-regression indicates that the sensitivity and specificity does not vary with age, male, hypertension, and diabetes. CONCLUSION: Elevated CK was associated with increased mortality and severity in patients with COVID-19.

The pandemic has caused reduced volumes of emergency department (ED) patients, except for those with COVID-19 infections, and this may reduce the case exposure of EM residents. The primary objective of this study was to compare the clinical exposure of EM residents between the prepandemic and pandemic periods. METHODS: This was a retrospective study of EM resident physicians' training in a tertiary teaching hospital with two branch regional hospitals in Taiwan. We retrieved data regarding patients seen by EM residents in the ED between September 1, 2019, and April 30, 2020. The first confirmed COVID-19 case in Taiwan was reported on January 11, so the pandemic period in our study was defined as spanning from February 1, 2020, to April 30, 2020. The number and characteristics of patients seen by residents were recorded. We compared the data between the prepandemic and pandemic periods. RESULTS: The mean number of patients per hour (PPH) seen by EM residents in the adult ED decreased in all three hospitals during the pandemic. The average PPH of critical area of medical ED was 1.68 in the pre-epidemic period and decreased to 1.33 in the epidemic period (p value < 0.001). The average number of patients managed by residents decreased from 1.24 to 0.82 in the trauma ED (p value = 0.01) and 1.56 to 0.51 in the pediatric ED (p value = 0.003) during the pandemic, respectively. The severity of patient illness did not change significantly between the periods. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic engendered a reduced ED volume and decreased EM residents' clinical exposure. All portion of EM residency training were affected by the pandemic, with pediatric EM being the most affected. The patient volume reduction may persist and in turn reduce patients' case exposure until the pandemic subsides. Adjustment of the training programs may be necessary and ancillary methods of learning should be used to ensure adequate EM residency training.","Lo, Hsiang-Yun; Lin, Shen-Che; Chaou, Chung-Hsien; Chang, Yu-Che; Ng, Chip-Jin; Chen, Shou-Yen",BMC Med Educ,952,15

METHODS: We queried the worldwide FDA Adverse Event Reporting System to extract SS records due to DDIs where linezolid was reported as suspect. For each serotonergic agent concomitantly reported, proportion of SS reports and mean number of DDIs were calculated and three different ""SS reporting zones"" were created. Relevant PK (peak concentration, area under plasma concentration curve, volume of distribution (VD), and lipophilicity) and PD (values of binding affinity (Ki) and IC50 for serotonin reuptake transporter (SERT) and 5-HT2A) parameters were extracted for each serotonergic agent, and relevant PK/PD indexes were calculated to assess correlation with mean number of DDIs (PV index). RESULTS: Six hundred sixty-nine reports of SS mentioning linezolid were found, being linezolid-citalopram (N = 69; 10.3%) the most frequently DDI reported. Citalopram and methadone showed respectively the highest proportion of SS reports (0.28%) and the lowest mean number of DDIs (1.41). Citalopram, escitalopram, and methadone emerged as red (i.e., alert)-zone medications: they exhibited high lipophilicity and large VD (proxies of excellent central nervous system penetration) coupled with high potency. Among PK/PD indexes, a significant correlation with PV index was found for VD/Ki SERT ratio (p = 0.05). DISCUSSION: Our integrated approach suggests that linezolid is more likely to cause SS when co-administered with citalopram, escitalopram, and methadone, as inferred from their pharmacological properties. Proper management of SS should be tailored on a case-by-case basis.","Gatti, Milo; Raschi, Emanuel; De Ponti, Fabrizio",Eur. j. clin. pharmacol,952,16

However, overlap of A2 and P2 and the change in heart sound morphologies have complicated detection of the S2 splitting interval. This study introduces a novel S-transform amplitude ridge tracking (START) algorithm for estimating S2 splitting interval and investigates the relationship between S2 splitting and interventricular relaxation dyssynchrony (IRD). First, the START algorithm was validated in a simulated model of heart sound. It showed small errors (<5 ms) in estimating splitting intervals from 10 to 70 ms, with A2/P2 amplitude ratios from 0.2 to 5, and signal-to-noise ratios from 10 to 30 dB. Subsequently, the START algorithm was evaluated in a porcine model employing a wide range of paced RV-LV delays. IRD was quantified by the time difference between invasively measured LV and RV pressure downslopes. Between LV pre-excitation to RV pre-excitation, mean S2 splitting interval decreased from 47 ms to 23 ms (p < .001), accompanied by a decrease in mean IRD from 8 ms to -18 ms (p < .001). S2 splitting interval was significantly correlated with IRD in each experiment (p < .001). In conclusion, the START algorithm can accurately assess S2 splitting and may serve as a useful tool to assess interventricular dyssynchrony.","Luo, Hongxing; Westphal, Philip; Shahmohammadi, Mehrdad; Heckman, Luuk I B; Kuiper, Marion; Cornelussen, Richard N; Delhaas, Tammo; Prinzen, Frits W",Physiol Rep,952,18

Currently, there is a lack of evidence on the persistence of specific antibodies. We investigated the generation and maintenance of neutralizing antibodies of convalescent SARS-CoV-2-afflicted patients over a ten-month period post-primary infection using an immunofluorescence assay, a commercial chemiluminescent immunoassay and an in-house enzyme-linked neutralization assay. We present the successful application of an improved version of the plaque-reduction neutralization assay which can be analysed optometrically to simplify data interpretation.

Emergent measures and policies (e.g., lockdown, social distancing) have been taken by governments to combat this highly infectious disease. However, people's mental health is also at risk due to the long-time strict social isolation rules. Hence, monitoring people's mental health across various events and topics will be extremely necessary for policy makers to make the appropriate decisions. On the other hand, social media have been widely used as an outlet for people to publish and share their personal opinions and feelings. The large scale social media posts (e.g., tweets) provide an ideal data source to infer the mental health for people during this pandemic period. In this work, we propose a novel framework to analyze the topic and sentiment dynamics due to COVID-19 from the massive social media posts. Based on a collection of 13 million tweets related to COVID-19 over two weeks, we found that the positive sentiment shows higher ratio than the negative sentiment during the study period. When zooming into the topic-level analysis, we find that different aspects of COVID-19 have been constantly discussed and show comparable sentiment polarities. Some topics like ``stay safe home""are dominated with positive sentiment. The others such as ``people death""are consistently showing negative sentiment. Overall, the proposed framework shows insightful findings based on the analysis of the topic-level sentiment dynamics.","Yin, Hui; Yang, Shuiqiao; Li, Jianxin",,952,18

We describe a major reorganization of service at a regional referral centre (Royal Surrey NHS Foundation Trust) to manage the crisis. Faecal immunochemical testing (FIT) was implemented for triage to make optimum use of limited diagnostic resources. Consultations were switched from face-to-face to telephone. Our aim was to evaluate the impact FIT had on resource allocation and patient diagnoses in the first 3 months of use. METHOD: All colorectal 2-week-wait patient referrals were posted a pack requesting FIT and notification of telephone consultation. A prepaid envelope was included for return of the samples. At consultation, FIT was incorporated with the presenting symptoms to guide the choice of investigation and triage urgency. FIT &#8805;10 µg/g was interpreted as positive. Outcome data were collected prospectively and compared with retrospective audit data from prepandemic levels across 3 months. RESULTS: From 26 March 2020 to 2 July 381 patients were referred who were invited to provide FIT samples and underwent telephone consultations. Three hundred and fifty eight FIT samples were returned (94%). Onward referral for colonoscopy reduced from 62% to 34% (P < 0.001). There were 14 colorectal cancers (CRC) (3.7%) diagnosed, which was not statistically different from the prepandemic level of 3.9% (P = 0.995). Twelve of the 14 patients with a CRC diagnosis had provided samples; all 12 had FIT &#8805;10 µg/g and were offered fast-track investigations. CONCLUSIONS: The incorporation of FIT optimized the allocation of limited resources to triage those who required urgent colonic investigation for detecting CRC.","Maclean, William; Limb, Chris; Mackenzie, Paul; Whyte, Martin B; Benton, Sally C; Rockall, Timothy; Jourdan, Iain",Colorectal dis,952,1

OBJECTIVES: To assess clinical profiles of pediatric COVID-19. STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective analysis was undertaken using clinical data of sixteen children (11 months-14 years) diagnosed with COVID-19 between January 1, 2020 and March 17, 2020 at Xiangyang Central Hospital, Hubei province, China. RESULTS: All children had positive epidemiologic histories, 12 (12/16, 75 %) involving family units. The illnesses were either mild (5/16, 31.3 %) or ordinary (11/16, 68.8 %), presenting as follows: asymptomatic (8/16, 50 %), fever and/or cough (8/16, 50 %). Four asymptomatic patients (4/16, 25 %) in ordinary cases had chest computed tomography (CT) abnormalities. Leukocyte counts were normal in 14 cases(88 %), but 2 patients (12.5 %) had leukopenia, and 1 (6.3 %) was lymphopenic. There were 11 patients with chest CT abnormalities, some nodular, others small patchy and others ground-glass opacities. In asymptomatic children, the median time to SRAS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test(NAT) positivity once exposed to a family member with confirmed infection was 15.5 days (range, 10-26 days). The median time to first NAT-negative conversion was 5.5 days (range, 1-23 days). CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 in children of Xiangyang city is often family acquired and not serious, with favorable outcomes. Asymptomatic children can be diagnosed as pneumonia because of chest CT abnormalities. It is essential to actively screen this segment of the population.","Song, Wenliang; Li, Junhua; Zou, Ning; Guan, Wenhe; Pan, Jiali; Xu, Wei",J Clin Virol,952,26

Data on metabolic control were collected at different time: within three months before the lockdown (visit 0) and within the first six weeks after it (visit 1). RESULTS: During the lockdown, a significant increase in body weight (from 79.7 ± 18.7 kg to 81.4 ± 19.4 kg, p < 0.001), body mass index (BMI, from 29.5 ± 6 kg/m2 to 30.1 ± 6.3 kg/m2, p < 0.001), waist circumference (from 103.8 ± 13 cm to 105 ± 13.6 cm, p < 0.001), fasting plasma glucose (FPG; from 138.1 ± 29.4 mg/dL to 146.6 ± 36.4 mg/dL) and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c; from 7 ± 0.8 to 7.3 ± 0.9%, p < 0.001) was observed.

These public health measures may have affected the provision of care for patients with epilepsy. Social isolation may have also adversely affected well-being and quality of life due to informal and formal support networks becoming less accessible. The purpose of this qualitative study was to examine the lived experiences of patients with epilepsy and to see how their quality of life and healthcare has been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: From April 27 to May 15, 2020 we performed remote interviews with 18 participants who had virtual appointments with their healthcare providers and were enrolled in the Calgary Comprehensive Epilepsy Program registry. Interviews were recorded and transcribed, after which transcripts were analyzed and coded into relevant themes using NVivo 12. RESULTS: Three broad themes emerged throughout the interviews:1) impact of pandemic on informal and formal support systems; 2) impact of pandemic on healthcare provision; and 3) concerns about the impact of the pandemic on personal situations and society in the future. Participants reported anxiety and stress about decreased social engagement and activity cessations. Although face-to-face appointments were preferred, virtual care was well-received. Common concerns about the future included securing employment and burnout from balancing family responsibilities. Some patients also feared they would be stigmatized as society adapted to the situation. SIGNIFICANCE: This study highlights the need for additional research in anticipation of the implementation of remote medicine in the management and treatment of epilepsy. It also highlights the tenacity of those living with epilepsy during difficult periods despite social and familial pressures. Raising awareness during this time about the lives and experiences of epilepsy patients can help challenge misconceptions and stigma in the workplace and wider society.","Subotic, Arsenije; Pricop, Diana F; Josephson, Colin B; Patten, Scott B; Smith, Eric E; Roach, Pamela",Epilepsy Behav,952,23

Many assays are either labour-intensive and require specialised facilities (e.g. virus neutralization assays), or are expensive with suboptimal specificity (e.g. commercial ELISAs and RDTs). Bead-based assays offer a cost-effective alternative and allow for multiplexing to test for antibodies against multiple antigens and against other pathogens. Here, we compare the performance of spike (S) and nucleocapsid (NP) antigens for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG, IgM and IgA antibodies in a panel of sera that includes recent (up to six weeks after symptom onset, severe nâ¯=â¯44; and mild cases nâ¯=â¯52) and old infections (five months after symptom onset, mild nâ¯=â¯104), using a Luminex-bead based assay and comparison to a virus neutralization test. While we show that neutralizing antibody levels are significantly lower in mild than in severe cases, we demonstrate that a combination of the recombinant nucleocapsid protein (NP) and receptor-binding domain (RBD) results in highly specific (99 %) IgG antibody detection five months after infection in 96 % of cases. Although most severe Covid-19 cases developed a clear IgM and IgA response, titers fell below the detection threshold in more than 20 % of mild cases in our bead-based assay. In conclusion, our data supports the use of RBD and NP for the development of SARS-CoV-2 serological IgG bead-based assays.","Mariën, Joachim; Ceulemans, Ann; Michiels, Johan; Heyndrickx, Leo; Kerkhof, Karen; Foque, Nikki; Widdowson, Marc-Alain; Mortgat, Laure; Duysburgh, Els; Desombere, Isabelle; Jansens, Hilde; Van Esbroeck, Marjan; Ariën, Kevin K",J Virol Methods,952,20

AIMS: To evaluate rates of successful de-escalation at 12 months and to determine factors that may predict success. METHODS: Single-centre experience of IBD patients that were de-escalated following deep remission on dose-intensified infliximab (IFX) or adalimumab (ADA) for secondary loss of response. Patients were classified as 'successes' if remaining on reduced anti-TNF or 'failures' if requiring re-escalation, steroids, surgery or enrolment into a clinical trial at 12 months. Patient demographics, disease characteristics, biomarkers (faecal calprotectin, C-reactive protein, albumin) and anti-TNF drug levels were collected 6-monthly. RESULTS: Of 25 patients (20 CD, 5 UC), 16 (64%) were successes 12 months post-de-escalation. Median time to failure was 6 months. Six of the nine failures required anti-TNF re-escalation and three entered a clinical trial. Re-escalation recaptured response in all six patients. There was no significant difference in baseline biomarker activity between the two groups. There was no difference in infliximab levels between successes and failures at the time of de-escalation (5.5 vs. 5.3, p = 0.63) as well as 6 months (3.1 vs. 4.6, p = 0.95) and 12 months (3.2 vs. 4.5, p = 0.58) post-de-escalation. CONCLUSION: Nearly two-thirds of patients remained on reduced anti-TNF dosing 12 months after de-escalation. All patients who failed de-escalation were recaptured after dose re-escalation. De-escalation with close monitoring may be considered in patients on intensified anti-TNF therapy in sustained remission.","Little, Robert D; Chu, Isabel E; Ward, Mark G; Sparrow, Miles P",Dig. dis. sci,952,21

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to analyze gender differences in state anxiety, daily functional self-actualization, and functional cognition and relationships among those factors in older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown. METHODS: We collected online data from a sample of 204 people (102 men and 102 women) aged 60 years and older. In addition to a demographic questionnaire, we used the State-Trait Personality Inventory to assess state anxiety, Daily Functional Actualization questionnaire to evaluate daily functional self-actualization, and Daily Living Questionnaire (DLQ) to measure functional cognition. RESULTS: Significant gender differences were found for state anxiety, t202=-2.36, P=.02; daily functional self-actualization, t202=2.15, P=.03; and the functional cognition components: complex tasks, Z=-3.07, P=.002; cognitive symptoms that might be interfering, Z=-2.15, P=.028; executive functions, Z=-2.21, P=.024; and executive function monitoring, Z=-2.21, P=.027. Significant medium correlations were found between both state anxiety level and daily functional self-actualization (r=-.62, P<.001) and functional cognition (r=.37-.40, P<.001). Gender predicted 3%, while daily functional self-actualization predicted 41%, and complex activities (DLQ) an additional 3% of the variance in state anxiety level, F3,202=9.57, P=.01. CONCLUSIONS: In older adults, anxiety is associated with cognitive decline, which may harm daily functional abilities and lead to social isolation, loneliness, and decreased well-being. Self-awareness and knowledge of gender differences and relationships between common available resources of daily functional self-actualization and functional cognition with anxiety may be strengthening factors in crisis periods such as the COVID-19 pandemic.","Rosenblum, Sara; Cohen Elimelech, Ortal",,952,24

The healthcare systems of all countries and the world economy, in general, became very stressed. The extraordinary decline of activity in all spheres, except healthcare, led to a drop in the demand for transport services, including city public transport. It was important for city management to support the sustainability of the local transport system. The article presents fundamental approaches to assessing the sustainability of a transport service, particularly city passenger public transport (CPPT), for the example of the large Russian city Tyumen (size of population-nearly 807 thousand people). Methods of analysis of the sustainability of the transport process in conditions of negative environmental impact (COVID-19 pandemic) are considered. During the period from 30.03.2020 to 31.05.2020 (nine weeks-the acute phase of COVID-19 pandemic) structural sustainability of the CPPT system in Tyumen kept a high level. By changing the parameters of the planned characteristics of the CPPT system state, an attempt to adapt the transport service supply to a sharp decrease in transport demand was made. In the period of ""self-isolation"", the demand for the CPPT transport service reduced more than the transport service supply. Sustainability of CPPT functioning was evaluated by calculating the elasticity of the transport supply (number of trips) in relation to the actual demand (actual volume of transportations). Calculation of the elasticity index of the CPPT system of Tyumen during nine weeks of April-May 2020 (duration of ""self-isolation"") is provided. A conclusion was made from the results of the research. In particular, it was found that the foreground target function of city management was the maintenance of a high level of transportation processes to the detriment of the transportations' effectiveness. Such a policy led to contradictory results-the additional financial expenses at the rate of 135-150 million rubles and quite a high level of contentment of the Tyumen population with the quality of the CPPT work (sociological research established that 80-85% of respondents were satisfied with the quality of the transport service in April-May 2020).","Petrov, A.

Serological tests measure antibody responses against pathogens and use predefined cutoff levels that dichotomize the quantitative test measures into sero-positives and negatives and use this as a proxy for past infection. With the imperfect assays that are currently available to test for past SARS-CoV-2 infection, the fraction of seropositive individuals in serosurveys is a biased estimator of the cumulative incidence and is usually corrected to account for the sensitivity and specificity. Here we use an inference method-referred to as mixture-model approach-for the estimation of the cumulative incidence that does not require to define cutoffs by integrating the quantitative test measures directly into the statistical inference procedure. We confirm that the mixture model outperforms the methods based on cutoffs, leading to less bias and error in estimates of the cumulative incidence. We illustrate how the mixture model can be used to optimize the design of serosurveys with imperfect serological tests. We also provide guidance on the number of control and case sera that are required to quantify the test's ambiguity sufficiently to enable the reliable estimation of the cumulative incidence. Lastly, we show how this approach can be used to estimate the cumulative incidence of classes of infections with an unknown distribution of quantitative test measures. This is a very promising application of the mixture-model approach that could identify the elusive fraction of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections. An R-package implementing the inference methods used in this paper is provided. Our study advocates using serological tests without cutoffs, especially if they are used to determine parameters characterizing populations rather than individuals. This approach circumvents some of the shortcomings of cutoff-based methods at exactly the low cumulative incidence levels and test accuracies that we are currently facing in SARS-CoV-2 serosurveys.","Bouman, Judith A; Riou, Julien; Bonhoeffer, Sebastian; Regoes, Roland R",PLoS Comput Biol,952,26

This study investigated (1) patterns of volunteering among older adults in Hong Kong during COVID-19; (2) associations between volunteering and mental health of older adults during COVID-19; and (3) associations between key psychological resources (e.g., self-efficacy and self-esteem) and volunteering among older adults during COVID-19. This study applied a cross-sectional design with data collected from 128 older adults in June 2020, who were trained as volunteers in a volunteer program that began before COVID-19. The study found that older adults continued to actively contribute to their communities by engaging in volunteering during COVID-19. The specific type of volunteering activities was linked to few depressive and anxiety symptoms. Older adults with increased self-esteem prior to COVID-19 were more likely to participate in volunteering activities related to COVID-19. Our study suggested that encouraging older adults to volunteer during the pandemic is a key pathway to maintain mental health. Social workers are encouraged to engage older adults in volunteerism regularly to offset the risk of depression and anxiety symptoms in times of crisis.","Chan, Wai; Chui, Cheryl Hiu Kwan; Cheung, Johnson Chun Sing; Lum, Terry Yat Sang; Lu, Shiyu",J Gerontol Soc Work,952,18

These factors include undetected cases, asymptomatic cases, and several non-pharmaceutical interventions. Because of the rapid spread of COVID-19 worldwide, understanding the significance of these factors is crucial in determining whether COVID-19 will be eradicated or persist in the population. Hence, in this study, we establish a new mathematical model to predict the spread of COVID-19 considering mentioned factors. RESULTS: Infection detection and vaccination have the potential to eradicate COVID-19 from Jakarta. From the sensitivity analysis, we find that rapid testing is crucial in reducing the basic reproduction number when COVID-19 is endemic in the population rather than contact trace. Furthermore, our results indicate that a vaccination strategy has the potential to relax social distancing rules, while maintaining the basic reproduction number at the minimum possible, and also eradicate COVID-19 from the population with a higher vaccination rate. In conclusion, our model proposed a mathematical model that can be used by Jakarta's government to relax social distancing policy by relying on future COVID-19 vaccine potential.","Aldila, Dipo; Samiadji, Brenda M; Simorangkir, Gracia M; Khosnaw, Sarbaz H A; Shahzad, Muhammad",BMC Res Notes,952,4

Despite the vast research about the adult population, there has been little data collected on acute kidney injury (AKI) epidemiology, associated risk factors, treatments, and mortality in pediatric COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU. AKI is a severe complication of COVID-19 among children and adolescents. METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was conducted in PubMed/MEDLINE and Cochrane Center Trials to find all published literature related to AKI in COVID-19 patients, including incidence and outcomes. RESULTS: Twenty-four studies reporting the outcomes of interest were included. Across all studies, the overall sample size of COVID positive children was 1,247 and the median age of this population was 9.1 years old. Among COVID positive pediatric patients, there was an AKI incidence of 30.51%, with only 0.56% of these patients receiving KRT. The mortality was 2.55% among all COVID positive pediatric patients. The incidence of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) among COVID positive patients was 74.29%. CONCLUSION: AKI has shown to be a negative prognostic factor in adult patients with COVID-19 and now also in the pediatric cohort with high incidence and mortality rates. Additionally, our findings show a strong comparison in epidemiology between adult and pediatric COVID-19 patients;however, they need to be confirmed with additional data and studies.","Raina, R.; Chakraborty, R.; Mawby, I.; Agarwal, N.; Sethi, S.; Forbes, M.",Pediatric Nephrology,952,6

The objective of this study was to determine if specific diagnostic and therapeutic interventions affect patient experience scores for children seen in the emergency department. METHODS: We performed a retrospective observational study in the emergency department of a large quaternary care children's hospital on patients who were discharged to home and later completed a National Research Corporation Health patient experience survey. We matched the survey results to electronic health record (EHR) data and were able to extract demographics, operational metrics, and order information for each patient. We performed multiple logistic regression analyses to determine the association of image acquisition, laboratory test ordering, medication administration, and discharge prescribing with likelihood to recommend the facility as our measure of patient experience. RESULTS: Of the 4103 patients who met inclusion criteria for the study, 75% strongly recommended the facility. Longer wait times were associated with lower patient experience scores [odds ratio (OR) per waiting room hour increase, 0.72; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.65-0.81]. Significant diagnostic factors associated with higher patient experience included magnetic resonance imaging ordering (OR, 2.38; 95% CI, 1.00-5.67), x-ray ordering (OR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.00-1.42), and electrocardiogram ordering (OR, 1.62; 95% CI, 1.07-2.44). Of the treatment factors studied, only antibiotic prescribing at discharge was found to have a significant positive association with patient experience (OR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.08-1.63). CONCLUSION: The positive association between more intensive diagnostic workups and patient experience could have implications on the utility of patient experience scores to evaluate pediatric care teams. Consideration should be taken to interpret patient experience scores in the context of compliance with approaches in evidence-based medicine.","Gorski, Jillian K; Mendonça, Eneida A; Showalter, Cory D",Pediatr. emerg. care,952,16
