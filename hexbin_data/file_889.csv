While the pandemic started later in Africa, it is now found in all African countries to varying degrees. It is thought that the prevalence and severity of disease is influenced by a number of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) which are all becoming increasingly prevalent in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). In addition, SSA bears the major burden of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and tuberculosis (TB) infections. While data from Europe and the United States show that children are spared severe disease, it is uncertain if the same holds true in SSA where children suffer from sickle cell disease and malnutrition in addition to other infectious diseases. There is limited data from Africa on the effects of these conditions on COVID-19. In this review, we discuss the epidemiology of some of these conditions in Africa and the possible pathogenesis for the interactions of these with COVID-19.","George, J A; Maphayi, M R; Pillay, T",Advances in experimental medicine and biology,https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-59261-5_13; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33656721/,889

This study has employed the systematic approach for searching the literature from the recently compiled database of researches namely COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19) and related diseases. The literature on Pakistan has shown the evidence of human-to-human and animal-to-human transmission of viruses, the presence of antibodies of MERS-CoV in camels, and careless attitude towards preventive measures of such respiratory diseases. There is a lot of gap in the literature regarding coronaviruses and their antibodies creating herd immunity for another coronavirus and COVID-19.

Here we report on a novel inhibitor of enterovirus replication, compound 1, 2-fluoro-4-(2-methyl-8-(3-(methylsulfonyl)benzylamino)imidazo[1,2-a]pyrazin-3-yl)phenol. This compound exhibited a broad spectrum of antiviral activity, as it inhibited all tested species of enteroviruses and rhinoviruses, with 50% effective concentrations ranging between 4 and 71 nM. After a lengthy resistance selection process, coxsackievirus mutants resistant to compound 1 were isolated that carried substitutions in their 3A protein. Remarkably, the same substitutions were recently shown to provide resistance to inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase IIIβ (PI4KIIIβ), a lipid kinase that is essential for enterovirus replication, suggesting that compound 1 may also target this host factor. Accordingly, compound 1 directly inhibited PI4KIIIβ in an in vitro kinase activity assay. Furthermore, the compound strongly reduced the PI 4-phosphate levels of the Golgi complex in cells. Rescue of coxsackievirus replication in the presence of compound 1 by a mutant PI4KIIIβ carrying a substitution in its ATP-binding pocket revealed that the compound directly binds the kinase at this site. Finally, we determined that an analogue of compound 1, 3-(3-fluoro-4-methoxyphenyl)-2-methyl-N-(pyridin-4-ylmethyl)imidazo[1,2-a]pyrazin-8-amine, is well tolerated in mice and has a dose-dependent protective activity in a coxsackievirus serotype B4-induced pancreatitis model.","van der Schaar, Hilde M; Leyssen, Pieter; Thibaut, Hendrik J; de Palma, Armando; van der Linden, Lonneke; Lanke, Kjerstin H W; Lacroix, Céline; Verbeken, Erik; Conrath, Katja; Macleod, Angus M; Mitchell, Dale R; Palmer, Nicholas J; van de Poël, Hervé; Andrews, Martin; Neyts, Johan; van Kuppeveld, Frank J M",Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,https://doi.org/10.1128/aac.01175-13; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23896472/,889

108549,Homeless persons and migrants in precarious housing conditions and COVID-19 pandemic: peculiarities and prevention strategies.,2020-09-01,"INTRODUCTION Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease and is characterised by cognitive impairment. Non-pharmacological treatments such as diet therapy have been widely investigated in studies on AD. Given the synergistic effects of nutrients present in foods, considering overall dietary composition rather than focusing on a single nutrient may be more useful for evaluating the relationship between diet and AD cognition. The present study aimed to assess the efficacy of different dietary interventions (eg, ketogenic and Mediterranean diets) on cognitive function in patients with AD in a systematic review and pairwise and network meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials or clinical trials. METHODS AND ANALYSIS Two reviewers will independently conduct searches of PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO and China National Knowledge Infrastructure databases. Data will be extracted from selected studies and risk of bias will be assessed using the revised Cochrane risk-of-bias tool, and evidence quality will be assessed according to the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation framework. The primary outcome of interest is cognitive function in patients with AD; secondary outcomes include biochemical biomarkers of AD and oxidative stress and/or inﬂammatory biomarkers in cerebrospinal fluid or plasma. For each outcome, random-effects pairwise and network meta-analyses will be carried out to determine the pooled relative effect of each intervention relative to every other intervention. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION As this study is based solely on published literature, no ethics approval is required. The research will be published in a peer-reviewed journal.","Chen, Lili; Xu, Xinhua; Cao, Huizhen; Li, Hong",BMJ open,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-042997; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33452198/,889
123662,Thromboembolic involvement and its possible pathogenesis in COVID-19 mortality: lesson from post-mortem reports.,2021-02-01,"BACKGROUND Narcolepsy is marked by pathologic symptoms including excessive daytime drowsiness and lethargy, even with sufficient nocturnal sleep. There are two types of narcolepsy: type 1 (with cataplexy) and type 2 (without cataplexy). Unlike type 1, for which hypocretin is a biomarker, type 2 narcolepsy has no adequate biomarker to identify the causality of narcoleptic phenomenon. Therefore, we aimed to establish new biomarkers for narcolepsy using the body's systemic networks. METHOD Thirty participants (15 with type 2 narcolepsy, 15 healthy controls) were included. We used the time delay stability (TDS) method to examine temporal information and determine relationships among multiple signals. We quantified and analyzed the network connectivity of nine biosignals (brainwaves, cardiac and respiratory information, muscle and eye movements) during nocturnal sleep. In particular, we focused on the differences in network connectivity between groups according to sleep stages and investigated whether the differences could be potential biomarkers to classify both groups by using a support vector machine. RESULT In rapid eye movement sleep, the narcolepsy group displayed more connections than the control group (narcolepsy connections: 24.47 ± 2.87, control connections: 21.34 ± 3.49; p = 0.022). The differences were observed in movement and cardiac activity. The performance of the classifier based on connectivity differences was a 0.93 for sensitivity, specificity and accuracy, respectively. CONCLUSION Network connectivity with the TDS method may be used as a biomarker to identify differences in the systemic networks of patients with narcolepsy type 2 and healthy controls.","Son, Dong Yeon; Kwon, Hyun Bin; Lee, Dong Seok; Jin, Hyung Won; Jeong, Jong Hyeok; Kim, Jeehoon; Choi, Sang Ho; Yoon, Heenam; Lee, Mi Hyun; Lee, Yu Jin; Park, Kwang Suk",Computers in biology and medicine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compbiomed.2021.104762; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34399195/,889

Thirty third-year and fourth-year nursing students were first taught the procedure and then given both an anxious-mood and a calm-mood induction in a randomly assigned counterbalanced order. Anxiety was induced by showing a video of interviews with frontline nurses and doctors during the severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic in Hong Kong, China; calmness was induced by a video of a nursing student's pleasant orientation to a clinical placement site. Nursing students were significantly less proficient in performing the newly acquired procedure after an anxious-mood induction (focused on occupational risks) than after a calm-mood induction. Therefore, managing clinical training site anxiety among nursing students may help to optimize learning and clinical performance.","Cheung, Ryan Yat-Ming; Au, Terry Kit-Fong",The Journal of nursing education,https://doi.org/10.3928/01484834-20110131-08; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21323251/,889
184882,Proteolytic processing of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus spikes expands virus tropism.,2016,"A quarter of prokaryotic Family II inorganic pyrophosphatases (PPases) contain a regulatory insert comprised of two cystathionine β-synthase (CBS) domains and one DRTGG domain in addition to the two catalytic domains that form canonical Family II PPases. The CBS domain-containing PPases (CBS-PPases) are allosterically activated or inhibited by adenine nucleotides that cooperatively bind to the CBS domains. Here we use chemical cross-linking and analytical ultracentrifugation to show that CBS-PPases from Desulfitobacterium hafniense and four other bacterial species are active as 200–250-kDa homotetramers, which seems unprecedented among the four PPase families. The tetrameric structure is stabilized by Co2+, the essential cofactor, pyrophosphate, the substrate, and adenine nucleotides, including diadenosine tetraphosphate. The deletion variants of dhPPase containing only catalytic or regulatory domains are dimeric. Co2+ depletion by incubation with EDTA converts CBS-PPase into inactive tetrameric and dimeric forms. Dissociation of tetrameric CBS-PPase and its catalytic part by dilution renders them inactive. The structure of CBS-PPase tetramer was modelled from the structures of dimeric catalytic and regulatory parts. These findings signify the role of the unique oligomeric structure of CBS-PPase in its multifaced regulation.","Anashkin, Viktor A.; Salminen, Anu; Orlov, Victor N.; Lahti, Reijo; Baykov, Alexander A.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.07.028951,889

Genetic engineering has tremendous potential in developing improved potato varieties with desired agronomic traits and has been utilized for improvement of several crop plants including potato to enhance essential amino acid, protein and lipids/carbohydrates contents as well to improve stress tolerance. The pathway engineering of amino acid revealed dramatic changes in essential amino acid content and protein quality. Similarly, the vitamin pathway engineering of potato has been proved to enhance the vitamin content with increased cellular antioxidant activities. Secondary metabolites such as flavonoids have also been altered through the genetic engineering of potato. This review provides detailed reports on the advances made in genetic transformation of potato for enrichment in its nutritional and therapeutic value by an increase in functional secondary metabolites, carbohydrate, essential amino acids, proteins, lipids, vitamins and edible vaccines.","Bagri, Deepak Singh; Upadhyay, Devanshi Chandel; Jain, Subodh Kumar; Upadhyay, Chandrama Prakash",Frontiers in bioscience,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28930528/,889

192935,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infection inhibition using spike protein heptad repeat-derived peptides.,2004,"Bacteria inhibitory to Escherichia coli O157:H7 were isolated from cattle and evaluated for their potential for reducing carriage of E. coli O157:H7 in calves. Eighteen of 1,200 bacterial isolates from cattle feces and intestinal tissue samples were screened and determined to inhibit the growth of E. coli O157:H7 in vitro. Seventeen of the isolates were E. coli and one was Proteus mirabilis. None produced Shiga toxin. Genomic DNA fingerprinting by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis revealed 13 distinguishable profiles among the 18 isolates. Two calves inoculated perorally with a mixture of all 18 isolates (10(10) CFU) appeared to be normal and did not develop signs of clinical disease throughout a 25- to 27-day observation period. These bacteria colonized segments of the gastrointestinal tract and were in feces at the termination of the experiment (25 and 27 days postinoculation) at levels of 50 to 200 CFU/g. Fifteen cannulated calves were studied to determine the efficiency of the probiotic bacteria in reducing or eliminating the carriage of E. coli O157:H7. Nine calves served as controls, with each animal receiving perorally 10(10) CFU of E. coli O157:H7. E. coli O157:H7 was detected intermittently in the rumen samples from all control animals throughout 3 weeks postinoculation, whereas E. coli O157:H7 was shed at various levels in feces continuously throughout the experiment (mean, 28 days). E. coli O157:H7 was isolated from the rumens and colons of eight of nine and nine of nine calves, respectively, at the termination of the study. Six calves each received perorally 10(10) CFU of probiotic bacteria and then 2 days later received 10(10) CFU of E. coli O157:H7. E. coli O157:H7 was detected in the rumen for only 9 days postinoculation in two animals, for 16 days in one animal, for 17 days in two animals, and for 29 days in one animal. E. coli O157:H7 was detected in feces for only 11 days postinoculation in one animal, for 15 days in one animal, for 17 days in one animal, for 18 days in one animal, for 19 days in one animal, and for 29 days in one animal. At the end of the experiment (mean, 30 days), E. coli O157:H7 was not recovered from the rumen of any of the six animals treated with probiotic bacteria; however, E. coli O157:H7 was recovered from the feces of one of the animals. This animal was fasted twice postinoculation. These studies indicate that selected probiotic bacteria administered to cattle prior to exposure to E. coli O157:H7 can reduce the level of carriage of E. coli O157:H7 in most animals.","Zhao, T; Doyle, M P; Harmon, B G; Brown, C A; Mueller, P O; Parks, A H",Journal of clinical microbiology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9508288/,889
199524,Opinion: Biodiversity conservation during a global crisis: Consequences and the way forward,2020,"Poult enteritis mortality syndrome (PEMS) is an economically devastating disease. To date, many questions about the syndrome remain unanswered, including its cause, transmission of causative agent(s), and control methods. Turkey coronavirus (TCV) infection has been associated with some outbreaks of PEMS, with areas having a higher prevalence of TCV infection also experiencing an increased incidence of PEMS. This study was designed to establish mortality patterns for flocks experiencing excess mortality and TCV infection in PEMS-affected regions and to delineate the possible role of TCV in PEMS-affected flocks. Fifty-four commercial turkey flocks on farms in areas with and without a history of TCV infection were monitored for weekly mortality and for antibodies to TCV. Flocks were chosen on the basis of placement dates and were monitored from day of placement until processing. All flocks were tested for TCV by an indirect fluorescent antibody assay. PEMS status was determined with the use of the clinical definition of mortality greater than 2% during any 3-wk period from 2 wk of age through the end of brooding due to unknown cause. Of the 54 flocks, 24 remained healthy, 23 experienced PEMS, and 7 tested positive for TCV but did not experience PEMS. Ten flocks experienced PEMS and tested positive for TCV, whereas 13 flocks experienced PEMS and did not test positive for TCV. Four health status groups were evident: healthy, PEMS positive, TCV positive, and PEMS + TCV positive. Distinct mortality patterns were seen for each of the four health status groups. Whereas TCV was associated with PEMS in 43% of PEMS cases, 13 cases (57%) of PEMS did not involve TCV. Additionally, 7 out of 17 cases of TCV (41%) did not experience excess mortality (PEMS) at any time during brooding of the flock. The results of this study indicate that TCV can be associated with PEMS but is neither necessary nor sufficient to cause PEMS.","Carver, D K; Vaillancourt, J P; Stringham, M; Guy, J S; Barnes, H J",Avian diseases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11785903/,889
199525,Opinion: Biodiversity conservation during a global crisis: Consequences and the way forward,2020,"BACKGROUND Several trials showed that early laparoscopic cholecystectomy is superior to delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy for the treatment of acute cholecystitis. However actual practice does not conform to current evidence. The aim of this study is to compare outcomes and total hospital costs between early and delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy for acute cholecystitis. PATIENTS AND METHODS A retrospective analysis of patients with acute cholecystitis that underwent a laparoscopic cholecystectomy at our institutions was performed. Patients were divided into 2 groups on the basis of the treatment received and statistical analysis was performed. RESULTS The study included 91 patients, 52 female and 39 male, with a mean age of 55. Early surgery was performed in 32 cases and delayed surgery in 59 cases. The two groups were comparable for demographics data and severity of disease on admission. There was a no significant difference (p = 0.174) in the mean operative time between early (54.8 min) and delayed group (47.8 min). Conversion rate was higher in the early group (34.3% vs. 20.3%), but difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.223). The overall complications rate was comparable (18.7% early vs. 16.9% delayed, p = 0.941). Length of postoperative stay (4.3 vs. 3.8 days) was similar (p = 0.437), but total hospital stay was significantly 4 days shorter in the early group (p < 0.0001). The mean total cost was higher for the delayed group (4171 vs. 6041), with a significant difference of 1870 Euro (p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS Early laparoscopic cholecystectomy has an outcome comparable to the delayed procedure, with a shorter total hospital stay and lower total costs, and it should be considered as the preferred approach in treatment of acute cholecystitis.","Minutolo, V; Licciardello, A; Arena, M; Nicosia, A; Di Stefano, B; Calì, G; Arena, G",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25535191/,889

219797,A guideline to limit indoor airborne transmission of COVID-19,2021,"BACKGROUND: The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health have been understudied among vulnerable populations, particularly in fragile and conflict-affected settings. We aimed to analyse how the pandemic is related to early changes in mental health and parenting stress among caregivers, many of whom are internally displaced persons (IDP), in a conflict-affected setting in Colombia. METHODS: For this cohort study, we used longitudinal data from a psychosocial support programme in which 1376 caregivers were randomly assigned across four sequential cohorts. Recruitment of participants took place in March, 2018, for cohort 1; July, 2018, for cohort 2; March, 2019, for cohort 3; and July, 2019, for cohort 4. Participants completed assessments at baseline, 1-month, and 8-month follow-ups. The 8-month assessment occurred before the COVID-19 pandemic for participants in cohorts 1 and 2 (n=573), whereas those in cohorts 3 and 4 (n=803) were assessed during the early stages of the pandemic, 2-5 weeks after the national lockdown began on March 25, 2020. Primary caregiver anxiety and depression were measured with a scale adapted from the Symptoms Checklist-90-Revised and parenting stress was measured with the short form of the Parenting Stress Index. We estimated how mental health changed by comparing prepandemic and postpandemic 8-month outcomes using lagged-dependent variable models. FINDINGS: Results showed that the likelihood of reporting symptoms above the risk threshold increased by 14 percentage points for anxiety (95% CI 10-17), 5 percentage points for depression (0·5-9), and 10 percentage points for parental stress (5-15). The deterioration in mental health was stronger for IDP, participants with lower education or pre-existing mental health conditions, and for those reporting a higher number of stressors, including food insecurity and job loss. INTERPRETATION: Maternal mental health significantly worsened during the early stages of the pandemic. Considering the vulnerability and pre-existing mental health conditions of this population, the estimated effects are substantial. Policies in fragile and conflict-affected settings targeting IDP and other vulnerable people will be important to mitigate further mental health and socioeconomic problems.

One of the most simple and cost-effective measures that can be adopted by the public and healthcare professionals to prevent cross-contamination and community transmission, is the implementation of effective oral and throat hygiene. Recent evidence has confirmed 0.5% PVP-I mouthrinse/gargle for 30 seconds can reduce SARS-CoV-2 virus infectivity to below detectable levels. PVP-I can even interrupt SARS-CoV-2 attachment to oral and nasopharyngeal tissues and lower the viral particles in the saliva and respiratory droplets. Thus the use of PVP-I mouthrinse as prophylactic measures has been advocated across the globe to reduce disease transmission. Although the efficacy of PVP-I against SARS-CoV-2 is proven, no review articles have yet discussed the evidence and mechanisms of PVP-I against the SARS-CoV-2. Thus, this paper highlights the rationale, safety, recommendations, and dosage of PVP-I gargle/mouthrinse as an effective method to decrease the viral loads during the pressing times of COVID-19.","Chopra, Diti; Sivaraman, Karthik; Radhakrishnan, Raghu; Balakrishnan, Dhanasekar; Narayana, Aparna",,,889
243711,Exposure density and neighborhood disparities in COVID-19 infection risk,2021,"The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 and the coronavirus infectious disease (COVID-19) has become a pandemic. Social (physical) distancing is a key non-pharmacologic control measure to reduce the transmission rate of SARS-COV-2, but high-level adherence is needed. Using daily travel distance and stay-at-home time derived from large-scale anonymous mobile phone location data provided by Descartes Labs and SafeGraph, we quantify the degree to which social distancing mandates have been followed in the U.S. and its effect on growth of COVID-19 cases. The correlation between the COVID-19 growth rate and travel distance decay rate and dwell time at home change rate was -0.586 (95% CI: -0.742 ~ -0.370) and 0.526 (95% CI: 0.293 ~ 0.700), respectively. Increases in state-specific doubling time of total cases ranged from 1.04 ~ 6.86 days to 3.66 ~ 30.29 days after social distancing orders were put in place, consistent with mechanistic epidemic prediction models.

249099,Evidence from internet search data shows information-seeking responses to news of local COVID-19 cases,2020,"NADPH oxidases produce reactive oxygen species that differ in localization, type and concentration. Within the Nox family only Nox4 produces H2O2 which can directly oxidize cysteine residues. With this post-translational modification, activity, stability, localization and protein-protein interactions of the affected protein is altered. Nox4 controls differentiation, cellular homeostasis and prevents inflammation. Therefore, is likely that epigenetic mechanisms contribute to the effects of Nox4. One group of epigenetic modifiers are class IIa histone deacetylases (HDACs). We hypothesize that Nox4-derived H2O2 oxidizes HDACs and analyzed whether HDACs can be differentially oxidized by Nox4. As an artificial system, we utilized HEK293 cells, overexpressing Nox4 in a tetracycline-inducible manner. HDAC4 was oxidized upon Nox4 overexpression. Additionally, Nox4 overexpression increased HDAC4 phosphorylation on Ser632. H2O2 disrupted HDAC4/Mef2A complex, which de-represses Mef2A. In endothelial cells such as HUVECs and HMECs, overexpression of HDAC4 significantly reduced tube formation. Overexpression of a redox insensitive HDAC4 had no effect on endothelial tube formation. Treatment with H2O2, induction of Nox4 expression by treatment of the cells with TGFß and co-overexpression of Nox4 not only induced phosphorylation of HDAC4, but also restored the repressive effect of HDAC4 for tube formation, while overexpression of a redox dead mutant of Nox4 did not. Taken together, Nox4 oxidizes HDAC4, increases its phosphorylation, and eventually ensures proper tube formation by endothelial cells.","Schader, Tim; Löwe, Oliver; Reschke, Christina; Malacarne, Pedro; Hahner, Fabian; Müller, Niklas; Gajos-Draus, Anna; Backs, Johannes; Schröder, Katrin",Redox Biol,,889

To date, the feasibility of an outpatient program for people recovering from COVID-19 has not been investigated. This study presents data for a physiotherapy-led, comprehensive outpatient pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) program. Patients were recruited after hospital discharge. Training consisted of twice weekly, interval-based aerobic cycle endurance (ACE) training, followed by resistance training (RT);60-90 min per session at intensities of 50% peak work rate;education and physical activity coaching were also provided. Feasibility outcomes included: recruitment and dropout rates, number of training sessions undertaken, and tolerability for dose and training mode. Of the 65 patients discharged home during the study period, 12 were successfully enrolled onto the program. Three dropouts (25%) were reported after 11-19 sessions. Tolerability of interval-based training was 83% and 100% for exercise duration of ACE and RT, respectively;92% for training intensity, 83% progressive increase of intensity, and 83% mode in ACE. We tentatively suggest from these preliminary findings that the PR protocol used may be both feasible, and confer benefits to a small subgroup of patients recovering from COVID-19.","Betschart, M.; Rezek, S.; Unger, I.; Beyer, S.; Gisi, D.; Shannon, H.; Sieber, C.",International Journal of Environmental Research &amp; Public Health [Electronic Resource],,889

Here we report the case of a patient with sporadic adult-onset ataxia (SAOA) who underwent allogeneic bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) therapy via the intrathecal route. A 60-year-old male patient visited our clinic complaining of progressive gait disturbance that commenced two years ago. Upon neurologic examination, the patient exhibited limb dysmetria and gait ataxia. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed cerebellar atrophy whereas the autonomic function test was normal. The patient was diagnosed with SAOA. The medications that were initially prescribed had no significant effects on the course of this disease and the symptoms deteriorated progressively. At the age of 64, the patient was treated with allogeneic bone marrow-derived MSC therapy. The subsequent K-SARA (Korean version of the Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia) scores demonstrated a distinct improvement up until 10 months post-administration. No adverse events were reported. The improved post-treatment K-SARA scores may suggest that the MSC therapy can have a neuroprotective effect and that stem cell therapy may serve as a potential therapeutic option for degenerative cerebellar ataxia.","Ko, Pan-Woo; Park, Sangmin; Kang, Kyunghun; Lim, Yong-Hyun; Kim, Sang Ryong; Suk, Kyoungho; Kim, Kyung Suk; Lee, Ho-Won",Medicina (Kaunas),,889

A total of 115 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were retrospectively analysed. All patients received supportive care as well as regular laboratory and clinical monitoring. The 115 patients comprised 44 patients who received intravenous ribavirin (treatment group) and 71 who did not (control group). Baseline laboratory and clinical characteristics were similar between the two groups. The negative conversion time for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RT-PCR in the ribavirin group was 12.8 ± 4.1 days compared with 14.1 ± 3.5 days in the control group (P = 0.314). Moreover, 7/41 patients (17.1%) in the ribavirin group died compared with 17/69 (24.6%) in the control group (P = 0.475). Adverse effects were similar between the two groups. In conclusion, in patients with severe COVID-19, ribavirin therapy is not associated with improved negative conversion time for SARS-CoV-2 test and is not associated with an improved mortality rate. Further assessment in designed randomised controlled trials is recommended.","Tong, Song; Su, Yuan; Yu, Yuan; Wu, Chuangyan; Chen, Jiuling; Wang, Sihua; Jiang, Jinjun",Int J Antimicrob Agents,,889

Given the easy access to multiple video conferencing platforms, many healthcare services have moved to an online delivery format (i.e. telehealth). It is important to monitor the behavioral and neural effects of telehealth interventions and resume neuroimaging research while adopting public health safety protocols to control the risk of COVID-19 transmission. We summarize existing safety protocols and our own experience from in-person functional near-infrared spectroscopy neuroimaging data collection (on-site, at home, and in outdoor settings), as well as potential opportunities of using online data sharing and low-cost, remote neuroimaging/electrophysiological techniques to continue brain research during the pandemic.","Su, Wan-Chun; Srinivasan, Sudha; Cleffi, Corina; Bhat, Anjana",Autism,,889

322131,Opinion: Priorities for governing large-scale infrastructure in the tropics,2020,"Background: A rigorous approach is needed to inform rapid adaptation and optimisation of behavioral interventions in evolving public health contexts, such as the Covid-19 pandemic. This helps ensure that interventions are relevant, persuasive, and feasible while remaining evidence-based. This paper provides a set of iterative methods to rapidly adapt and optimize an intervention during implementation. These methods are demonstrated through the example of optimizing an effective online handwashing intervention called Germ Defense. Methods: Three revised versions of the intervention were rapidly optimized and launched within short timeframes of 1-2 months. Optimisations were informed by: regular stakeholder engagement; emerging scientific evidence, and changing government guidance; rapid qualitative research (telephone think-aloud interviews and open-text surveys), and analyses of usage data. All feedback was rapidly collated, using the Table of Changes method from the Person-Based Approach to prioritize potential optimisations in terms of their likely impact on behavior change. Written feedback from stakeholders on each new iteration of the intervention also informed specific optimisations of the content. Results: Working closely with clinical stakeholders ensured that the intervention was clinically accurate, for example, confirming that information about transmission and exposure was consistent with evidence. Patient and Public Involvement (PPI) contributors identified important clarifications to intervention content, such as whether Covid-19 can be transmitted via air as well as surfaces, and ensured that information about difficult behaviors (such as self-isolation) was supportive and feasible. Iterative updates were made in line with emerging evidence, including changes to the information about face-coverings and opening windows. Qualitative research provided insights into barriers to engaging with the intervention and target behaviors, with open-text surveys providing a useful supplement to detailed think-aloud interviews. Usage data helped identify common points of disengagement, which guided decisions about optimisations. The Table of Changes was modified to facilitate rapid collation and prioritization of multiple sources of feedback to inform optimisations. Engagement with PPI informed the optimisation process. Conclusions: Rapid optimisation methods of this kind may in future be used to help improve the speed and efficiency of adaptation, optimization, and implementation of interventions, in line with calls for more rapid, pragmatic health research methods.","Morton, Katherine; Ainsworth, Ben; Miller, Sascha; Rice, Cathy; Bostock, Jennifer; Denison-Day, James; Towler, Lauren; Groot, Julia; Moore, Michael; Willcox, Merlin; Chadborn, Tim; Amlot, Richard; Gold, Natalie; Little, Paul; Yardley, Lucy",Front Public Health,,889

The Americas and Europe are by far the WHO regions with the most introductions, 85% and 77% of their countries having already introduced respectively. A record number of introductions was observed in 2019, most of which in low- and middle- income countries (LMIC) where access has been limited. Programs had an average performance coverage of around 67% for the first dose and 53% for the final dose of HPV. LMICs performed on average better than high- income countries for the first dose, but worse for the last dose due to higher dropout. Only 5 (6%) countries achieved coverages with the final dose of more than 90%, 22 countries (21%) achieved coverages of 75% or higher while 35 (40%) had a final dose coverage of 50% or less. When expressed as world population coverage (i.e., weighted by population size), global coverage of the final HPV dose for 2019 is estimated at 15%.

This paper aims to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on foot and ankle trauma in a major trauma centre. METHODS: A retrospective observational study of prospectively collected data was performed. All foot and ankle trauma patients over a 33 week period (1st December 2019-16th July 2020) were analysed. All patients with trauma classified by the AO/OTA as occurring at locations 43 and 81-88 were included. RESULTS: Over the 33 weeks analysed, there was a total of 1661 trauma cases performed; of these, only 230 (13.85%) were foot and ankle trauma cases. As percentage of cases during each period of lockdown, foot and ankle made up 15.20% (147 out of 967) pre-lockdown, 8.81% (17 out of 193) during lockdown and 13.17% (66 out of 501) post lockdown. This difference was statistically significant (p < .001). The most significant change in trauma management was the treatment of malleolar fractures. Further analysis showed that during the lockdown period 29 foot and ankle fractures were treated the same and 13 were treated differently, (i.e. 31% of fractures were treated conservatively, when the consultants preferred practice would have been surgical intervention). Of the 13 patients, 3 have had surgical management since lockdown has been eased. CONCLUSION: It is evident that the trauma case activity within foot and ankle was significantly reduced during the COVID-19 period. The consequences of change in management were mitigated due to a reduction in case load.","Stringer, Howard; Molloy, Andrew; Craven, Joanne; Moorehead, John; Santini, Alasdair; Mason, Lyndon",Foot (Edinb),,889
431038,Rationing social contact during the COVID-19 pandemic: Transmission risk and social benefits of US locations,2020,"Novel Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has abruptly and undoubtedly changed the world as we know it at the end of the 2nd decade of the 21st century. COVID-19 is extremely contagious and quickly spreading globally making its early diagnosis of paramount importance. Early diagnosis of COVID-19 enables health care professionals and government authorities to break the chain of transition and flatten the epidemic curve. The common type of COVID-19 diagnosis test, however, requires specific equipment and has relatively low sensitivity. Computed tomography (CT) scans and X-ray images, on the other hand, reveal specific manifestations associated with this disease. Overlap with other lung infections makes human-centered diagnosis of COVID-19 challenging. Consequently, there has been an urgent surge of interest to develop Deep Neural Network (DNN)-based diagnosis solutions, mainly based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to facilitate identification of positive COVID-19 cases. CNNs, however, are prone to lose spatial information between image instances and require large datasets. The paper presents an alternative modeling framework based on Capsule Networks, referred to as the COVID-CAPS, being capable of handling small datasets, which is of significant importance due to sudden and rapid emergence of COVID-19. Our results based on a dataset of X-ray images show that COVID-CAPS has advantage over previous CNN-based models. COVID-CAPS achieved an Accuracy of 95.7%, Sensitivity of 90%, Specificity of 95.8%, and Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.97, while having far less number of trainable parameters in comparison to its counterparts. To further improve diagnosis capabilities of the COVID-CAPS, pre-training based on a new dataset constructed from an external dataset of X-ray images. Pre-training with a dataset of similar nature further improved accuracy to 98.3% and specificity to 98.6%.","Afshar, Parnian; Heidarian, Shahin; Naderkhani, Farnoosh; Oikonomou, Anastasia; Plataniotis, Konstantinos N.; Mohammadi, Arash",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.02696v2.pdf,889

459800,Opinion: A risk-benefit framework for human research during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"COVID-19 is an ongoing pandemic caused by the highly infectious coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 that is engaging worldwide scientific research to find a timely and effective eradication strategy. Great efforts have been put into anti-COVID-19 vaccine generation in an effort to protect the world population and block SARS-CoV-2 spread. To validate the protective efficacy of the vaccination campaign and effectively control the pandemic, it is necessary to quantify the induction of neutralizing antibodies by vaccination, as they have been established to be a correlate of protection. In this work, a SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus neutralization assay, based on a replication-incompetent lentivirus expressing an adapted form of CoV-2 S protein and an ACE2/TMPRSS2 stably expressing cell line, has been minimized in terms of protocol steps without loss of accuracy. The goal of the present simplified neutralization system is to improve SARS-CoV-2 vaccination campaign by means of an easy and accessible approach to be performed in any medical laboratory, maintaining the sensitivity and quantitative reliability of classical serum neutralization assays. Further, this assay can be easily adapted to different coronavirus variants by simply modifying the pseudotyping vector.","Donofrio, G.; Franceschi, V.; Macchi, F.; Russo, L.; Rocci, A.; Marchica, V.; Costa, F.; Giuliani, N.; Ferrari, C.; Missale, G.",Vaccines (Basel),,889
467946,COVID-19 pandemic impacts on global inland fisheries,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Tai Chi (TC), a gentle exercise, incorporates meditative movement and respiratory control. The high risk of cross infection for people with cystic fibrosis (CF) requires close management in healthcare settings, limiting group activities such as TC. A mixed-methods randomized controlled feasibility study compared teaching TC over the internet with in-person, face to face TC tuition provided to CF patients. This article explores qualitative data from patients and TC instructors on their attitudes, acceptability and engagement with the two modes of TC delivery. METHODS: Qualitative data from CF patients (>6 years) were collected using Skype interviews/focus groups and written feedback. TC instructors provided weekly written feedback, and took part in interviews/ focus groups at the end of the study. Patients and instructors interviews explored their experiences and engagement with TC online delivery and ability to practice. RESULTS: Irrespective of the type of TC delivery, all CF participants interviewed (n=28) practiced between lessons and most wanted to continue TC. Teenagers were more likely to miss TC appointments. Internet delivery was well received by both patients and TC instructors. Two patients reported difficulties with screen size/camera and one with internet connectivity. CONCLUSION: Both face-to-face and internet delivery of Tai Chi lessons were equally well received and perceived as beneficial. In the current COVID-19 pandemic, CF patients self-isolating may find this intervention provides important support, therefore the programme was made available on YouTube in April 2020 and linked to the websites of the CF charities funding the research.","Ronan, Patricia; Mian, Awais; Carr, Siobhán B; Madge, Susan L; Lorenc, Ava; Robinson, Professor Nicola",Eur J Integr Med,,889

He had a background history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and ischaemic heart disease. His oxygen saturations dropped rapidly to 80% on day 9 of ICU admission. Chest auscultation revealed absent breath sounds over the left upper chest which raised suspicions for pneumothorax, of which a small stable left apical pneumothorax was documented on a recent CT scan of the thorax. Point-of-care ultrasonography was performed prior to attempting chest drain insertion which demonstrated sliding pleura on the left side (GE Healthcare model: Vscan Extend-display: 5 inches, 720×1280 pixels resolution, sector probe-broad bandwidth: 1.7-3.8 MHz, 24 cm penetration and linear probe-broad bandwidth: 3.3-8 MHz, 8 cm penetration). A portable chest X-ray was obtained which demonstrated left upper lobe collapse secondary to mucus plugging. The mucus plug was successfully suctioned from the patient's airway using bedside bronchoscopy subsequently improving the patient's oxygen saturation. A follow-up chest X-ray and CT scan of the thorax demonstrated interval resolution of the left upper lobe collapse. While expansion of his existing pneumothorax was first on the list of differential diagnoses, the use of ultrasonography early in the patient's assessment ensured it was ruled out prior to attempting chest drain insertion, thus prompting the acquisition of the chest X-ray which subsequently demonstrated the left upper lobe collapse as the correct diagnosis.","Lock, Chris; Nix, Catherine M",BMJ case reports,,889

This study reported the outcomes, multiple challenges, and broad recommendations associated with the impact of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) on oncology early phase 1 trials—and on drug development in Asia—based on the experiences and perspectives of Asian oncology phase 1 centers. METHODS: Between March and April 2020 during the initial period of outbreak, the impact of COVID‐19 across oncology phase 1 sites in five Asian countries—China (Hong Kong), Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore—was retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: There was no trial termination or treatment discontinuation in all five countries. Although the most common impact was new patient enrollment being placed on hold, which was based on pharmaceutical sponsors’ decision‐making, the situation varied per site. Most sites had no restrictions in place that would limit their ability to fully comply with the requirements of conducting the early phase studies. The number of protocol deviations during the pandemic was largely dependent on domestic transportation status during the outbreak rather than the ability of the clinical trial centers. CONCLUSION: Determining the risk to benefits ratio of patients with cancer who are enrolled in early phase 1 clinical trials under the unusual circumstances of a global pandemic is important. Specific guidance or guidelines on the conduct of early phase 1 clinical trials during public health emergencies that are based on the recent lessons learned is urgently required.","Shimizu, Toshio; Kim, Dong‐Wan; Loong, Herbert H.; Lin, Chia‐Chi; Ng, Matthew CH; Yamamoto, Noboru; Ma, Brigette; Tan, Daniel SW",Asia Pac J Clin Oncol,https://doi.org/10.1111/ajco.13510; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33502085/,889

METHODS: In 184 serum samples from 130 COVID-19 patients and 54 SARS-CoV-2 negative subjects, the analytical and clinical performances of four commercially available chemiluminescent assays (Abbott SARS-Cov-2 IgG, Roche Elecsys anti-SARS-CoV-2, Ortho SARS-CoV-2 total and IgG) and one enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Diesse ENZY-WELL SARS-CoV-2 IgG) were evaluated and compared with the neutralization activity achieved using the plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT). FINDINGS: Precision results ranged from 0.9% to 11.8% for all assays. Elecsys anti-SARS-CoV-2 demonstrated linearity of results at concentrations within the cut-off value. Overall, sensitivity ranged from 78.5 to 87.7%, and specificity, from 97.6 to 100%. On limiting the analysis to samples collected 12 days after onset of symptoms, the sensitivity of all assays increased, the highest value (95.2%) being obtained with VITRO Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Total and Architect SARS-CoV-2 IgG. The strongest PRNT(50) correlation with antibody levels was obtained with ENZY-Well SARS-CoV-2 IgG (R(2)adj = 0.569). INTERPRETATION: The results confirmed that all immunoassays had an excellent specificity, whereas sensitivity varied across immunoassays, depending strongly on the time interval between symptoms onset and sample collection. Further studies should be conducted to achieve a stronger correlation between antibody measurement and PRNT(50) in order to obtain useful information for providing a better management of COVID-19 patients, effective passive antibody therapy, and developing a vaccine against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

Considering that ACT encourages broad and flexible patterns of behaviour and neutralizes the pervasive psychological processes proposed to be caused by most individuals' distress, such a modality may be effective for ADHD. This review aimed to give a synthesis of the studies, so far, focusing on the usefulness of ACT approaches among individuals having ADHD. DESIGN/METHODS: This scoping review searched studies exploring the effectiveness of ACT approaches for individuals with ADHD across eight electronic databases (Medline, Embase, PsycInfo, ScienceDirect, PubMed, Emcare, Scopus, and Google Scholar). This review was based on a total of two quasi-experimental and four experimental studies. RESULTS: A thematic analysis was suggested based on the PRISMA guidelines. Overall, the review presented preliminary evidence demonstrating the use of ACT among individuals with ADHD. It was found that the ACT was used to treat a variety of behavioural and psychosocial outcomes, which included reducing ADHD symptoms (e.g., impulsivity, inattention, inflexibility, etc.) and other sequelae related to the ADHD diagnosis such as poor quality of life, academic procrastination, depression and anxiety symptoms, and psychological maladjustment. CONCLUSIONS: This review revealed that ACT was a flexible approach that could be adapted to deliver both targeted treatment of ADHD symptomatology and more general psychosocial issues. It could also be delivered in group or individual formats. Nevertheless, although the findings of the present scoping review indicate promising results, more research is needed.","Munawar, Khadeeja; Choudhry, Fahad Riaz; Lee, Sook Huey; Siau, Ching Sin; Kadri, Nursyuhaidah Binti Mohd; Binti Sulong, Rose Manisah",Heliyon,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34466706/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e07842,889

The course of pandemic evolution has shown great differences among countries and not much is yet known about the level of generated immunity, which might appear not to be long-lasting. In this situation, management of a recurrent disease seems to be a plausible scenario that countries worldwide will have to face, before effective drugs or a vaccine appear. Spain in Europe, appears to be the first country deciding to partly lift the strict social distancing regulations imposed. Whether this action may lead to further epidemic recrudescence, to a following second wave of cases or conversely, help return to previous normality, is a subject of great debate and interest to all other countries affected by COVID-19. Here we applied a modified SEIR compartmental model accounting for the spread of infection during the latent period, in which we had also incorporated effects of social confinement. We now modify this previous model configuration to mimic potential post-confinement scenarios, by simulating from instant massive liberation of different portions of the confined population, up to a more gradual incorporation of people to work. Results show how current lockdown conditions should be extended at least two weeks more to prevent a new escalation in cases and deaths, as well as a larger second wave occurring in just a few months. Conversely, best-case scenario in terms of lower COVID-19 incidence and casualties should gradually incorporate workers back in a daily proportion at most 30 percent higher than that of previous confinement. The former should begin not earlier than by the end of April and it would represent approximately 600 thousand people or a 3.75% rate for the whole of Spain.","Lopez, Leonardo; Rodo, Xavier",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.14.20064766,889

Several numerical tests validate the proposed analysis by highlighting diverse peculiarities of the investigated approach.","Breda, Dimitri; Kuniya, Toshikazu; Ripoll, Jordi; Vermiglio, Rossana",J Sci Comput,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33162670/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10915-020-01339-1,889
689452,The challenges of modeling and forecasting the spread of COVID-19,2020-07-21,"We isolated two pseudorabies virus (PRV) isolates (designated OT-1 and OT-2) from two hunting dogs exhibiting neurological manifestations after eating the flesh of wild boar hunted in Oita prefecture, Kyushu Island, Japan. The isolates corresponded to a previously reported PRV (MY-1 strain) isolated from a hunting dog in neighboring Miyazaki prefecture, and it clustered into genotype II based on the glycoprotein C sequence. Our results suggest that this common PRV strain may have been maintained in wild boars on Kyushu Island even though domestic pigs in this area have attained an Aujeszky’s disease-free status.","KANEKO, Chiho; KANEKO, Yasuyuki; SUDARYATMA, Putu Eka; MEKATA, Hirohisa; KIRINO, Yumi; YAMAGUCHI, Ryoji; OKABAYASHI, Tamaki",J Vet Med Sci,https://doi.org/10.1292/jvms.20-0450; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33583864/,889
