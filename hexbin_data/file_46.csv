60,60,60,Reliability of case definitions for public health surveillance assessed by Round-Robin test methodology,20.961178,0.60300785,2006-05-10,"BACKGROUND: Case definitions have been recognized to be important elements of public health surveillance systems. They are to assure comparability and consistency of surveillance data and have crucial impact on the sensitivity and the positive predictive value of a surveillance system. The reliability of case definitions has rarely been investigated systematically. METHODS: We conducted a Round-Robin test by asking all 425 local health departments (LHD) and the 16 state health departments (SHD) in Germany to classify a selection of 68 case examples using case definitions. By multivariate analysis we investigated factors linked to classification agreement with a gold standard, which was defined by an expert panel. RESULTS: A total of 7870 classifications were done by 396 LHD (93%) and all SHD. Reporting sensitivity was 90.0%, positive predictive value 76.6%. Polio case examples had the lowest reporting precision, salmonellosis case examples the highest (OR = 0.008; CI: 0.005–0.013). Case definitions with a check-list format of clinical criteria resulted in higher reporting precision than case definitions with a narrative description (OR = 3.08; CI: 2.47–3.83). Reporting precision was higher among SHD compared to LHD (OR = 1.52; CI: 1.14–2.02). CONCLUSION: Our findings led to a systematic revision of the German case definitions and build the basis for general recommendations for the creation of case definitions. These include, among others, that testable yes/no criteria in a check-list format is likely to improve reliability, and that software used for data transmission should be designed in strict accordance with the case definitions. The findings of this study are largely applicable to case definitions in many other countries or international networks as they share the same structural and editorial characteristics of the case definitions evaluated in this study before their revision.","Krause, Gérard; Brodhun, Bonita; Altmann, Doris; Claus, Hermann; Benzler, Justus",BMC Public Health,46,30
62,62,62,"Sentinel surveillance for human enterovirus 71 in Sarawak, Malaysia: lessons from the first 7 years",20.939909,0.4413208,2006-07-07,"BACKGROUND: A major outbreak of human enterovirus 71-associated hand, foot and mouth disease in Sarawak in 1997 marked the beginning of a series of outbreaks in the Asia Pacific region. Some of these outbreaks had unusually high numbers of fatalities and this generated much fear and anxiety in the region. METHODS: We established a sentinel surveillance programme for hand, foot and mouth disease in Sarawak, Malaysia, in March 1998, and the observations of the first 7 years are described here. Virus isolation, serotyping and genotyping were performed on throat, rectal, vesicle and other swabs. RESULTS: During this period Sarawak had two outbreaks of human enterovirus 71, in 2000 and 2003. The predominant strains circulating in the outbreaks of 1997, 2000 and 2003 were all from genogroup B, but the strains isolated during each outbreak were genetically distinct from each other. Human enterovirus 71 outbreaks occurred in a cyclical pattern every three years and Coxsackievirus A16 co-circulated with human enterovirus 71. Although vesicles were most likely to yield an isolate, this sample was not generally available from most cases and obtaining throat swabs was thus found to be the most efficient way to obtain virological information. CONCLUSION: Knowledge of the epidemiology of human enterovirus 71 transmission will allow public health personnel to predict when outbreaks might occur and to plan interventions in an effective manner in order to reduce the burden of disease.","Podin, Yuwana; Gias, Edna LM; Ong, Flora; Leong, Yee-Wei; Yee, Siew-Fung; Yusof, Mohd Apandi; Perera, David; Teo, Bibiana; Wee, Thian-Yew; Yao, Sik-Chi; Yao, Sik-King; Kiyu, Andrew; Arif, Mohd Taha; Cardosa, Mary Jane",BMC Public Health,46,30
175,175,175,The geosimulation of West Nile virus propagation: a multi-agent and climate sensitive tool for risk management in public health,20.968073,0.8809364,2008-07-07,"BACKGROUND: Since 1999, the expansion of the West Nile virus (WNV) epizooty has led public health authorities to build and operate surveillance systems in North America. These systems are very useful to collect data, but cannot be used to forecast the probable spread of the virus in coming years. Such forecasts, if proven reliable, would permit preventive measures to be put into place at the appropriate level of expected risk and at the appropriate time. It is within this context that the Multi-Agent GeoSimulation approach has been selected to develop a system that simulates the interactions of populations of mosquitoes and birds over space and time in relation to the spread and transmission of WNV. This simulation takes place in a virtual mapping environment representing a large administrative territory (e.g. province, state) and carried out under various climate scenarios in order to simulate the effects of vector control measures such as larviciding at scales of 1/20 000 or smaller. RESULTS: After setting some hypotheses, a conceptual model and system architecture were developed to describe the population dynamics and interactions of mosquitoes (genus Culex) and American crows, which were chosen as the main actors in the simulation. Based on a mathematical compartment model used to simulate the population dynamics, an operational prototype was developed for the Southern part of Quebec (Canada). The system allows users to modify the parameters of the model, to select various climate and larviciding scenarios, to visualize on a digital map the progression (on a weekly or daily basis) of the infection in and around the crows' roosts and to generate graphs showing the evolution of the populations. The basic units for visualisation are municipalities. CONCLUSION: In all likelihood this system might be used to support short term decision-making related to WNV vector control measures, including the use of larvicides, according to climatic scenarios. Once fully calibrated in several real-life contexts, this promising approach opens the door to the study and management of other zoonotic diseases such as Lyme disease.","Bouden, Mondher; Moulin, Bernard; Gosselin, Pierre",Int J Health Geogr,46,30

Understanding the current status of PHE preparedness is the first step in planning to enhance hospitals' capacities for emergency response. The objective of this study is to understand the current status of hospital PHE preparedness in China. METHODS: Four hundred hospitals in four city and provinces of China were surveyed using a standardized questionnaire. Data related to hospital demographic data; PHE preparation; response to PHE in community; stockpiles of drugs and materials; detection and identification of PHE; procedures for medical treatment; laboratory diagnosis and management; staff training; and risk communication were collected and analyzed. RESULTS: Valid responses were received from 318 (79.5%) of the 400 hospitals surveyed. Of the valid responses, 264 (85.2%) hospitals had emergency plans; 93.3% had command centres and personnel for PHE; 22.9% included community organisations during the training for PHE; 97.4% could transport needed medical staff to a PHE; 53.1% had evaluated stockpiles of drugs; 61.5% had evaluated their supply systems; 55.5% had developed surveillance systems; and 74.6% could monitor the abnormity(See in appendix). Physicians in 80.2% of the analyzed hospitals reported up-to-date knowledge of their institution's PHE protocol. Of the 318 respondents, 97.4% followed strict laboratory regulations, however, only about 33.5% had protocols for suspected samples. Furthermore, only 59.0% could isolate and identify salmonella and staphylococcus and less than 5% could isolate and identify human H5N1 avian flu and SARS. Staff training or drill programs were reported in 94.5% of the institutions; 50.3% periodically assessed the efficacy of staff training; 45% had experts to provide psychological counselling; 12.1% had provided training for their medical staff to assess PHE-related stress. All of the above capacities related to the demographic characteristics of hospitals and will be discussed in-depth in this paper. CONCLUSION: Our survey suggested that, at the time of the survey, hospital preparedness for PHE in China was at an early stage of development. Comprehensive measures should be taken to enhance hospital capacity in the prevention and management of PHE.","Li, Xingming; Huang, Jianshi; Zhang, Hui",BMC Public Health,46,30

Exploring the particular challenges facing these communities is essential to improving public health planning. In alignment with the objectives of the Pandemic Influenza Outbreak Research Modelling (Pan-InfORM) team, a Canadian public health workshop was held at the Centre for Disease Modelling (CDM) to: (i) evaluate post-pandemic research findings; (ii) identify existing gaps in knowledge that have yet to be addressed through ongoing research and collaborative activities; and (iii) build upon existing partnerships within the research community to forge new collaborative links with Aboriginal health organizations. The workshop achieved its objectives in identifying main research findings and emerging information post pandemic, and highlighting key challenges that pose significant impediments to the health protection and promotion of Canadian Aboriginal populations. The health challenges faced by Canadian indigenous populations are unique and complex, and can only be addressed through active engagement with affected communities. The academic research community will need to develop a new interdisciplinary framework, building upon concepts from ‘Communities of Practice’, to ensure that the research priorities are identified and targeted, and the outcomes are translated into the context of community health to improve policy and practice.","Richardson, Katya L; Driedger, Michelle S; Pizzi, Nick J; Wu, Jianhong; Moghadas, Seyed M",BMC Public Health,46,30
1103,1103,1103,Advanced Querying Features for Disease Surveillance Systems,20.809217,0.4585308,2010-04-09,"Most automated disease surveillance systems notify users of increases in the prevalence of reports in syndrome categories and allow users to view patient level data related to those increases. Occasionally, a more dynamic level of control is required to properly detect an emerging disease in a community. Dynamic querying features are invaluable when using existing surveillance systems to investigate outbreaks of newly emergent diseases or to identify cases of reportable diseases within data being captured for surveillance. The objective of the Advance Querying Tool (AQT) is to build a more flexible query interface for most web-based disease surveillance systems. This interface allows users to define and build their query as if they were writing a logical expression for a mathematical computation. The AQT allows users to develop, investigate, save, and share complex case definitions. It provides a flexible interface that accommodates both advanced and novice users, checks the validity of the expression as it is built, and marks errors for users.","Hashemian, Mohammad R.",Online J Public Health Inform,46,30

Cambodia in particular has the potential for high rates of avoidable deaths from pandemic influenza due to large gaps in health system resources. This study seeks to better understand the course and cost-of-illness for cases of highly pathogenic avian influenza in Cambodia. METHODS: We studied the 18 laboratory-confirmed cases of avian influenza subtype H5N1 identified in Cambodia between January 2005 and August 2011. Medical records for all patients were reviewed to extract information on patient characteristics, travel to hospital, time to admission, diagnostic testing, treatment and disease outcomes. Further data related to costs was collected through interviews with key informants at district and provincial hospitals, the Ministry of Health and non-governmental organisations. An ingredient-based approach was used to estimate the total economic cost for each study patient. Costing was conducted from a societal perspective and included both financial and opportunity costs to the patient or carer. Sensitivity analysis was undertaken to evaluate potential change or variation in the cost-of-illness. RESULTS: Of the 18 patients studied, 11 (61%) were under the age of 18 years. The majority of patients (16, 89%) died, eight (44%) within 24 hours of hospital admission. There was an average delay of seven days between symptom onset and hospitalisation with patients travelling an average of 148 kilometres (8-476 km) to the admitting hospital. Five patients were treated with oseltamivir of whom two received the recommended dose. For the 16 patients who received all their treatment in Cambodia the average per patient cost of H5N1 influenza illness was US$300 of which 85.0% comprised direct medical provider costs, including diagnostic testing (41.2%), pharmaceuticals (28.4%), hospitalisation (10.4%), oxygen (4.4%) and outpatient consultations (0.6%). Patient or family costs were US$45 per patient (15.0%) of total economic cost. CONCLUSION: Cases of avian influenza in Cambodia were characterised by delays in hospitalisation, deficiencies in some aspects of treatment and a high fatality rate. The costs associated with medical care, particularly diagnostic testing and pharmaceutical therapy, were major contributors to the relatively high cost-of-illness.","Humphries-Waa, Karen; Drake, Tom; Huszar, Anthony; Liverani, Marco; Borin, Khieu; Touch, Sok; Srey, Teng; Coker, Richard",BMC Public Health,46,30
1348,1348,1348,Spatio-temporal analysis on enterovirus cases through integrated surveillance in Taiwan,20.882391,0.741383,2014-01-08,"BACKGROUND: Severe epidemics of enterovirus have occurred frequently in Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan, Cambodia, and China, involving cases of pulmonary edema, hemorrhage and encephalitis, and an effective vaccine has not been available. The specific aim of this study was to understand the epidemiological characteristics of mild and severe enterovirus cases through integrated surveillance data. METHODS: All enterovirus cases in Taiwan over almost ten years from three main databases, including national notifiable diseases surveillance, sentinel physician surveillance and laboratory surveillance programs from July 1, 1999 to December 31, 2008 were analyzed. The Pearson’s correlation coefficient was applied for measuring the consistency of the trends in the cases between different surveillance systems. Cross correlation analysis in a time series model was applied for examining the capability to predict severe enterovirus infections. Poisson temporal, spatial and space-time scan statistics were used for identifying the most likely clusters of severe enterovirus outbreaks. The directional distribution method with two standard deviations of ellipse was applied to measure the size and the movement of the epidemic. RESULTS: The secular trend showed that the number of severe EV cases peaked in 2008, and the number of mild EV cases was significantly correlated with that of severe ones occurring in the same week [r = 0.553, p < 0.01]. These severe EV cases showed significantly higher association with the weekly positive isolation rates of EV-71 than the mild cases [severe: 0.498, p < 0.01 vs. mild: 0.278, p < 0.01]. In a time series model, the increase of mild EV cases was the significant predictor for the occurrence of severe EV cases. The directional distribution showed that both the mild and severe EV cases spread extensively during the peak. Before the detected spatio-temporal clusters in June 2008, the mild cases had begun to rise since May 2008, and the outbreak spread from south to north. CONCLUSIONS: Local public health professionals can monitor the temporal and spatial trends plus spatio-temporal clusters and isolation rate of EV-71 in mild and severe EV cases in a community when virus transmission is high, to provide early warning signals and to prevent subsequent severe epidemics.","Chan, Ta-Chien; Hwang, Jing-Shiang; Chen, Rung-Hung; King, Chwan-Chuen; Chiang, Po-Huang",BMC Public Health,46,30
1534,1534,1534,Capacity building efforts and perceptions for wildlife surveillance to detect zoonotic pathogens: comparing stakeholder perspectives,20.95565,0.6149154,2014-07-04,"BACKGROUND: The capacity to conduct zoonotic pathogen surveillance in wildlife is critical for the recognition and identification of emerging health threats. The PREDICT project, a component of United States Agency for International Development’s Emerging Pandemic Threats program, has introduced capacity building efforts to increase zoonotic pathogen surveillance in wildlife in global ‘hot spot’ regions where zoonotic disease emergence is likely to occur. Understanding priorities, challenges, and opportunities from the perspectives of the stakeholders is a key component of any successful capacity building program. METHODS: A survey was administered to wildlife officials and to PREDICT-implementing in-country project scientists in 16 participating countries in order to identify similarities and differences in perspectives between the groups regarding capacity needs for zoonotic pathogen surveillance in wildlife. RESULTS: Both stakeholder groups identified some human-animal interfaces (i.e. areas of high contact between wildlife and humans with the potential risk for disease transmission), such as hunting and markets, as important for ongoing targeting of wildlife surveillance. Similarly, findings regarding challenges across stakeholder groups showed some agreement in that a lack of sustainable funding across regions was the greatest challenge for conducting wildlife surveillance for zoonotic pathogens (wildlife officials: 96% and project scientists: 81%). However, the opportunity for improving zoonotic pathogen surveillance capacity identified most frequently by wildlife officials as important was increasing communication or coordination among agencies, sectors, or regions (100% of wildlife officials), whereas the most frequent opportunities identified as important by project scientists were increasing human capacity, increasing laboratory capacity, and the growing interest or awareness regarding wildlife disease or surveillance programs (all identified by 69% of project scientists). CONCLUSIONS: A One Health approach to capacity building applied at local and global scales will have the greatest impact on improving zoonotic pathogen surveillance in wildlife. This approach will involve increasing communication and cooperation across ministries and sectors so that experts and stakeholders work together to identify and mitigate surveillance gaps. Over time, this transdisciplinary approach to capacity building will help overcome existing challenges and promote efficient targeting of high risk interfaces for zoonotic pathogen transmission.","Schwind, Jessica S; Goldstein, Tracey; Thomas, Kate; Mazet, Jonna AK; Smith, Woutrina A",BMC Public Health,46,30

During the 1918 pandemic, mortality rates were lower in children compared with adults. This mortality difference occurs in a wide variety of infectious diseases. It has been replicated in mice and might be due to greater tolerance of infection, not greater resistance. Importantly, combination treatment with inexpensive and widely available generic drugs (e.g. statins and angiotensin receptor blockers) might change the damaging host response in adults to a more tolerant response in children. These drugs might work by modifying endothelial dysfunction, mitochondrial biogenesis and immunometabolism. Treating the host response might be the only practical way to reduce global mortality during the next influenza pandemic. It might also help reduce mortality due to seasonal influenza and other forms of acute critical illness. To realize these benefits, we need laboratory and clinical studies of host response treatment before and after puberty.","Fedson, David S",Evol Med Public Health,46,30

Here, we critically review competing hypotheses on the timing and geographical origin of this important outbreak and provide new historical insights into debates within military circles as to the nature of putative pre-1918 influenza activity. We also synthesize current knowledge about why the 1918 pandemic was so intense in young adults. Although it is still not clear precisely when and where the outbreak began and symptom-based reports are unlikely to reveal the answer, indirect methods including phylogenetics provide important clues, and we consider whether intense influenza activity as far back as 1915 in the USA may have been caused by viral strains closely related to the 1918 one.","Worobey, Michael; Cox, Jim; Gill, Douglas",Evol Med Public Health,46,30

We conducted a quantitative laboratory assessment during 2014–2015 in two resource-limited provinces in southern China, Guangxi and Guizhou in order to guide strategies for strengthening core capacities as required by the International Health Regulations (IHR 2005). METHODS: We selected 28 public health and clinical laboratories from the provincial, prefecture and county levels through a quasi-random sampling approach. The 11-module World Health Organization (WHO) laboratory assessment tool was adapted to the local context in China. At each laboratory, modules were scored 0–100% through a combination of paper surveys, in-person interviews, and visual inspections. We defined module scores as strong (> = 85%), good (70–84%), weak (50–69%), and very weak (< 50%). We estimated overall capacity and compared module scores across the provincial, prefecture, and county levels. RESULTS: Overall, laboratories in both provinces received strong or good scores for 10 of the 11 modules. These findings were primarily driven by strong and good scores from the two provincial level laboratories; prefecture and county laboratories were strong or good for only 8 and 6 modules, respectively. County laboratories received weak scores in 4 modules. The module, ‘Public Health Functions’ (e.g., surveillance and reporting practices) lagged far behind all other modules (mean score = 46%) across all three administrative levels. Findings across the two provinces were similar. CONCLUSIONS: Laboratories in Guangxi and Guizhou are generally performing well in laboratory capacity as required by IHR. However, we recommend targeted interventions particularly for county-level laboratories, where we identified a number of gaps. Given the importance of surveillance and reporting, addressing gaps in public health functions is likely to have the greatest positive impact for IHR requirements. The quantitative WHO laboratory assessment tool was useful in identifying both comparative strengths and weaknesses. However, prior to future assessments, the tool may need to be aligned with the new WHO IHR monitoring and evaluation framework.

Factors underpinning the increased mobility of the nursing workforce and their contribution to nurses’ turnover thus merit attention. Understanding nurses’ job satisfaction is important, as this is a key factor in nurses’ turnover. OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to explore nurses’ views and experience regarding different components of their working lives in Mainland China. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey design was selected and 512 nurses working in the medical and surgical departments in two teaching hospitals in Beijing completed questionnaires yielding a response rate of 81%. RESULTS: More than half of nurses (53.7%; n=275) were satisfied or very satisfied with their jobs and 15% (n=77) felt moderate to extreme occupational stress. The majority of the sample reported a high level of organizational commitment (63.7%; n=326) and professional commitment (85.9%; n=440) and only 5.9% (n=30) and 10.0% (n=51), respectively reported role conflict and role ambiguity often or very often. Nurses with a diploma or associate degree reported greater professional commitment and a lower level of role conflict than those with a bachelor degree (p<0.05), but there were no significant differences in job satisfaction, organizational commitment, occupational stress and role ambiguity by educational programme (p>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Hospital nurses’ positive feelings regarding their working lives may be influenced by developments in the health care system and the nursing profession in Mainland China.

To do so we first need to understand species' responses to local‐level habitat attributes in order to inform the decision‐making process and on‐ground conservation actions. Patterns in the occurrence of native terrestrial reptile and small mammal species in 59 sites located in remnant urban habitat fragments of Brisbane City were assessed against local‐level environmental characteristics of each site. Cluster analysis, multidimensional scaling ordination, and principal axis correlation were used to investigate relationships between species' occurrences and environmental characteristics. Native reptiles were most strongly associated with the presence of termite mounds, a high amount of fallen woody material, and a moderate amount of weed cover. Native small mammals were most strongly associated with the presence of grass trees (Xanthorrhoea spp.), and both reptiles and small mammals were negatively influenced by increased soil compaction. Significant floristic characteristics were considered to be important as structural, rather than compositional, habitat elements. Therefore, habitat structure, rather than vegetation composition, appears to be most important for determining native, terrestrial reptile and small mammal species assemblages in urban forest fragments. We discuss the management implications in relation to human disturbances and local‐level management of urban remnants.","GARDEN, JENNI G.; MCALPINE, CLIVE A.; POSSINGHAM, HUGH P.; JONES, DARRYL N.",Austral Ecol,46,30

S100B levels on day 1 of 0.226 μg/L were diagnostic for SAE with 80.0% specificity and 66.1% sensitivity, and the area under (AUC) the curve was 0.728, S100B levels on day 3 of 0.144 μg/L were diagnostic for SAE with 84.44% specificity and 69.49% sensitivity, and the AUC was 0.819. In addition, the AUC for S100B on day 3 for predicting 180-day mortality was larger than for S100B on day 1 (0.731 vs. 0.611). Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that S100B3 (p = 0.001) but not S100B1 (p = 0.927) were independently correlated with SAE. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that patients with S100B levels higher than 0.144 μg/L had a lower probability of survival at day 180. There were more patients with encephalopathy and a higher 28-day or 180-day mortality in the ΔS100B + group than in the ΔS100B- group. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that SAE and IL-6 on day 3 were independently correlated with S100B dynamic increase. These findings suggest that elevated serum S100B levels on day 3 and the dynamic changes of serum S100B levels from day three to one were more associated with brain dysfunction and mortality than that on day 1 in patients with sepsis.","Wu, Long; Feng, Qing; Ai, Mei-Lin; Deng, Song-yun; Liu, Zhi-Yong; Huang, Li; Ai, Yu-Hang; Zhang, Lina",Sci Rep,46,30

The potential protective role of SGLT2 inhibition on diabetic kidney disease (DKD) and underlying mechanism, however, remains unknown. In this study, metabolic switch was examined using kidney samples from human with diabetes and streptozocin (STZ)-induced experimental mouse model of diabetes treated with or without SGLT2 inhibitor dapagliflozin. Results were further validated using primarily cultured proximal tubule epithelial cells. We found that DKD development and progression to renal fibrosis entailed profound changes in proximal tubule metabolism, characterized by a switch from fatty acid utilization to glycolysis and lipid accumulation, which is associated with the increased expression of HIF-1α. Diabetes-induced tubulointerstitial damage, such as macrophage infiltration and fibrosis, was significantly improved by dapagliflozin. Consistent with the effects of these beneficial interventions, the metabolic disorder was almost completely eliminated by dapagliflozin. The increased level of HIF-1α in renal proximal tubule was nearly nullified by dapagliflozin. Moreover, dapagliflozin protects against glucose-induced metabolic shift in PTCs via inhibiting HIF-1α. It suggests that SGLT2 inhibition is efficient in rectifying the metabolic disorder and may be a novel prevention and treatment strategy for kidney tubule in DKD.","Cai, Ting; Ke, Qingqing; Fang, Yi; Wen, Ping; Chen, Hanzhi; Yuan, Qi; Luo, Jing; Zhang, Yu; Sun, Qi; Lv, Yunhui; Zen, Ke; Jiang, Lei; Zhou, Yang; Yang, Junwei",Cell Death Dis,46,30

Platelets are one of the cellular entities that exert considerable immune, antibacterial, and antiviral actions, and are therefore active participants in the host response. Platelets are sensitive to surrounding inflammatory stimuli and contribute to the immune response by multiple mechanisms, including endowing the endothelium with a proinflammatory phenotype, enhancing and amplifying leukocyte recruitment and inflammation, promoting the effector functions of immune cells, and ensuring an optimal adaptive immune response. During infection, pathogens and their products influence the platelet response and can even be toxic. However, platelets are able to sense and engage bacteria and viruses to assist in their removal and destruction. Platelets greatly contribute to host defense by multiple mechanisms, including forming immune complexes and aggregates, shedding their granular content, and internalizing pathogens and subsequently being marked for removal. These processes, and the nature of platelet function in general, cause the platelet to be irreversibly consumed in the execution of its duty. An exaggerated systemic inflammatory response to infection can drive platelet dysfunction, where platelets are inappropriately activated and face immunological destruction. While thrombocytopenia may arise by condition-specific mechanisms that cause an imbalance between platelet production and removal, this review evaluates a generic large-scale mechanism for platelet depletion as a repercussion of its involvement at the nexus of responses to infection.","Page, Martin J.; Pretorius, Etheresia",Semin Thromb Hemost,46,30

However, it is difficult to explain what the models actually learn in artificial intelligence-assisted medical research. Our aim is to investigate the visual interpretability of the computer-assisted diagnosis of malignant and benign thyroid nodules using ultrasound images. MATERIAL/METHODS: We designed and implemented 2 experiments to test whether our proposed model learned to interpret the ultrasound features used by ultrasound experts to diagnose thyroid nodules. First, in an anteroposterior/transverse (A/T) ratio experiment, multiple models were trained by changing the A/T ratio of the original nodules, and their classification, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were tested. Second, in a visualization experiment, class activation mapping used global average pooling and a fully connected layer to visualize the neural network to show the most important features. We also examined the importance of data preprocessing. RESULTS: The A/T ratio experiment showed that after changing the A/T ratio of the nodules, the accuracy of the neural network model was reduced by 9.24–30.45%, indicating that our neural network model learned the A/T ratio information of the nodules. The visual experiment results showed that the nodule margins had a strong influence on the prediction of the neural network. CONCLUSIONS: This study was an active exploration of interpretability in the deep learning classification of thyroid nodules. It demonstrated the neural network-visualized model focused on irregular nodule margins and the A/T ratio to classify thyroid nodules.","Wei, Xi; Zhu, Jialin; Zhang, Haozhi; Gao, Hongyan; Yu, Ruiguo; Liu, Zhiqiang; Zheng, Xiangqian; Gao, Ming; Zhang, Sheng",Med Sci Monit,46,30

METHODS: In this prospective randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, we assigned 106 patients with NAFLD and T2DM to receive empagliflozin 10 mg (n = 35), pioglitazone 30 mg (n = 34), or placebo (n = 37) for 24 weeks. Liver fat content and liver stiffness were measured using fibroscans. Body composition assessment was performed by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scans. The primary end point was change from baseline in liver steatosis, using the controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) score. RESULTS: A borderline significant decrease in CAP score was observed with empagliflozin compared to placebo, mean difference: − 29.6 dB/m (− 39.5 to − 19.6) versus − 16.4 dB/m (− 25.0 to − 7.8), respectively; p = 0.05. Using multivariate analysis, we observed a significant reduction in the placebo-corrected change in liver stiffness measurement (LSM) with empagliflozin compared to pioglitazone: − 0.77 kPa (− 1.45, − 0.09), p = 0.02, versus 0.01 kPa (95% CI − 0.70, 0.71, p = 0.98), p for comparison = 0.03. Changes in serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT), fasting insulin, homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), HOMA2-IR, fibrosis-4 index (FIB4 index), NAFLD fibrosis score, aspartate aminotransferase to platelet ratio index (APRI), android/gynecoid ratio (A/G ratio), and skeletal muscle index (SMI) were comparable between the two treatment groups, while significant reductions of the body weight and visceral fat area were observed only in the empagliflozin group (p < 0.001 and p = 0.01, respectively) and both were increased in the placebo and pioglitazone groups. There were no serious adverse events in either group. CONCLUSION: Treatment for 24 weeks with empagliflozin, in contrast to pioglitazone, was associated with improvement of liver steatosis and fibrosis in patients with NAFLD and T2DM.

METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study involving CRGNB-infected pneumonia. All CRGNB-infected pneumonia patients received empirical and targeted antibiotic treatment (TAT), and they were divided into reasonable empirical antibiotic treatment (REAT) and UEAT according to whether the empirical antibiotic treatment (EAT) was reasonable. The data of the two groups were compared to analyze their influence on the 30-day mortality and hospitalization time in CRGNB-infected pneumonia patients. Moreover, we also considered other variables that might be relevant and conducted multivariable regression analysis of 30-day mortality and duration of hospitalization in CRGNB-infected pneumonia patients. RESULTS: The study collected 310 CRGNB-infected pneumonia patients, the most common bacterium is Acinetobacter baumannii (211/310 [68%]), the rest were Klebsiella pneumoniae (46/310 [15%]), Pseudomonas aeruginosa and others (53/310 [17%]). Among them, 76/310 (24.5%) patients received REAT. In the analysis of risk factors, dementia, consciousness were risk factors of 30-day mortality, pulmonary disease, hemodynamic support at culture taken day and recent surgery were risk factors for longer hospital stay. The analysis of 30-day mortality showed that UEAT was not associated with 30-day mortality for the 30-day mortality of REAT and UEAT were 9 of 76 (11.84%) and 36 of 234 (15.38%) (P = 0.447), respectively. Meanwhile, there was difference between REAT and UEAT (P = 0.023) in the analysis of EAT on hospitalization time in CRGNB-infected pneumonia patients. CONCLUSIONS: UEAT was not associated with 30-day mortality while was related to duration of hospitalization in CRGNB-infected pneumonia patients, in which Acinetobacter baumanniii accouned for the majority.","Li, Rongrong; Tang, Hao; Xu, Huaming; Cui, Kunwei; Li, Shujin; Shen, Jilu",Ann Clin Microbiol Antimicrob,46,30

We hypothesized that early oxygen saturations (SpO(2)), arterial pO(2) levels, and supplemental oxygen (FiO(2)) would associate with later neuroanatomic changes. METHODS: SpO(2), arterial blood gases, and FiO(2) from 73 ELGANs (GA 26.4 ± 1.2; BW 867 ± 179 g) during the first 3 postnatal days were correlated with later white matter injury (WM, MRI, n = 69), secondary cortical somatosensory processing in magnetoencephalography (MEG-SII, n = 39), Hempel neurological examination (n = 66), and developmental quotients of Griffiths Mental Developmental Scales (GMDS, n = 58). RESULTS: The ELGANs with later WM abnormalities exhibited lower SpO(2) and pO(2) levels, and higher FiO(2) need during the first 3 days than those with normal WM. They also had higher pCO(2) values. The infants with abnormal MEG-SII showed opposite findings, i.e., displayed higher SpO(2) and pO(2) levels and lower FiO(2) need, than those with better outcomes. Severe WM changes and abnormal MEG-SII were correlated with adverse neurodevelopment. CONCLUSIONS: Low oxygen levels and high FiO(2) need during the NICU care associate with WM abnormalities, whereas higher oxygen levels correlate with abnormal MEG-SII. The results may indicate certain brain structures being more vulnerable to hypoxia and others to hyperoxia, thus emphasizing the role of strict saturation targets. IMPACT: This study indicates that both abnormally low and high oxygen levels during early NICU care are harmful for later neurodevelopmental outcomes in preterm neonates. Specific brain structures seem to be vulnerable to low and others to high oxygen levels. The findings may have clinical implications as oxygen is one of the most common therapies given in NICUs. The results emphasize the role of strict saturation targets during the early postnatal period in preterm infants.","Rantakari, Krista; Rinta-Koski, Olli-Pekka; Metsäranta, Marjo; Hollmén, Jaakko; Särkkä, Simo; Rahkonen, Petri; Lano, Aulikki; Lauronen, Leena; Nevalainen, Päivi; Leskinen, Markus J.; Andersson, Sture",Pediatr Res,46,30

In the second phase, we employed a cross-sectional design. The data from 236 nurses were collected using nurses’ perceptions of futile care questionnaire, Minnesota Satisfaction Questionnaire, and Spirituality and Spiritual Care Rating Scale. RESULTS: The main theme of the qualitative phase was a feeling of self as a useful tool in God’s hand. Sub-themes were providing care while knowing it is futile, not knowing the patient destiny, having hope for care to be fruitful, experiences patient recovery, acting to be a part of God’s plan. Futile care and job experience were two predictors of low job satisfaction. Spiritual well-being had a moderating effect and increased job satisfaction. CONCLUSIONS: Futile care can decrease job satisfaction, while spiritual well-being can reduce its negative effect.

In Ethiopia, they are the main livestock kept to sustain the livelihoods of pastoralists, as camels are used for milk and meat production and also for transportation. However, she-camel reproductive diseases are one of the major constraints for camel-producing communities. A cross-sectional study was conducted from November 2018 to December 2019 to identify and characterize pathological lesions and isolate possible bacteria associated with reproductive diseases and disorders in she-camels slaughtered at Dire Dawa and Babille municipal abattoirs. A total of 155 study animals were examined by recruiting all she-camels slaughtered during every abattoir visit. Overall, 562 reproductive organs, the ovaries, oviducts, uterus, and cervix, were examined through observation, palpation, and incision, and the animal- and organ-level pathological lesion prevalence were found to be 29% and 64.6%, respectively. Degenerative changes, inflammatory lesions (endometritis and salpingitis), growth disturbances (e.g., ovarian hypoplasia), and noninflammatory lesions (e.g., noninflammatory edema) were the identified pathological lesions. Occurrences of pathological changes among reproductive organs had differences where significantly the highest proportion (p = 0.00) was observed in the uteri. Of the 119 microbiological samples processed, 77.3% were positive for single or mixed bacterial genera, from which 7 different bacterial isolates and 14 other unidentified Gram-negative bacteria were detected. E. coli, Salmonella, and Staphylococcus spp. were the most frequently isolated organisms with 28.2%, 26.9%, and 12.8% frequencies, respectively. The result of the questionnaire survey showed 74% of the respondents had culled the she-camel at productive age because of poor reproductive performance associated with refused mating, abortion, and repeat breeding (poor conception). On the other hand, a majority of camel herders had poor to no information and access to modern veterinary services; nevertheless, they had good indigenous knowledge on how to manage reproductive abnormalities. Considering the importance of camels in our study area, further research on camel reproductive diseases and abnormalities with wider sample and epidemiology need to be conducted using molecular and hormonal assay techniques.","Belina, Dinaol; Eshetu, Amare; Alemu, Sisay; Shasho, Bekyad; Mohammed, Tajudin; Mohammed, Ahmedin; Mummed, Bahar; Regassa, Dereje",Vet Med Int,46,30

AIM: The study aimed to assess food insecurity and its relationships with glycaemic control and other patient characteristics amongst diabetic patients attending Jabulani Dumani Community Health Centre. SETTING: The study was conducted in a primary healthcare facility in the south sub-district of Ekurhuleni health district, the Gauteng province, South Africa. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional descriptive study involving 250 patients. Data were collected by using an interview-administered Household Food Insecurity Access Scale questionnaire. Descriptive and inferential statistical analyses by using Stata 14.0 statistical software were performed. Chi square and logistic regression tests assessed the association between socio-demographic characteristics, glycaemic control and food insecurity. RESULTS: Amongst 250 recruited participants, 82.4% were above 50 years, 64% women, 88.8% South African citizens and 42.4% had a household size of ≥ 5 people. Sixty-four percent and 69.9% were classified as having food insecurity and poor glycaemic control, respectively. On further analysis, food insecurity was associated with unemployment (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 2.94; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.51–5.75), being a South African citizen (AOR = 1.60; 95% CI: 0.66–3.86), household size of ≥ 5 people (AOR = 1.77; 95% CI: 0.98–3.19) and uncontrolled glycaemic level (AOR = 5.38; 95% CI: 2.91–9.96). CONCLUSION: Food insecurity in diabetic patients constitutes a serious challenge for glycaemic control.

It is likely that the public health impact of pollen may increase in the future due to a higher population prevalence of pollen sensitization as well as earlier, longer, and more intense pollen seasons, trends attributed to climate change. The effects of pollen on health outcomes have previously been studied through cross-sectional design or at two time points, namely preceding and within the period of pollen exposure. We are not aware of any observational study in adults that has analyzed the dose-response relationship between daily ambient pollen concentration and cardiovascular, pulmonary, cognitive, sleep, or quality of life outcomes. Many studies have relied on self-reported pollen allergy status rather than objectively confirming pollen sensitization. In addition, many studies lacked statistical power due to small sample sizes or were highly restrictive with their inclusion criteria, making the findings less transferable to the “real world.” Methods: The EPOCHAL study is an observational panel study which aims to relate ambient pollen concentration to six specific health domains: (1) pulmonary function and inflammation; (2) cardiovascular outcomes (blood pressure and heart rate variability); (3) cognitive performance; (4) sleep; (5) health-related quality of life (HRQoL); and (6) allergic rhinitis symptom severity. Our goal is to enroll 400 individuals with diverse allergen sensitization profiles. The six health domains will be assessed while ambient exposure to pollen of different plants naturally varies. Health data will be collected through six home nurse visits (at approximately weekly intervals) as well as 10 days of independent tracking of blood pressure, sleep, cognitive performance, HRQoL, and symptom severity by participants. Through repeated health assessments, we aim to uncover and characterize dose-response relationships between exposure to different species of pollen and numerous acute health effects, considering (non-)linearity, thresholds, plateaus and slopes. Conclusion: A gain of knowledge in pollen-health outcome relationships is critical to inform future public health policies and will ultimately lead toward better symptom forecasts and improved personalized prevention and treatment.","Bürgler, Alexandra; Glick, Sarah; Hartmann, Karin; Eeftens, Marloes",Front Public Health,46,5

Due to the atypical symptoms and diverse imaging findings, T. marneffei-infected patients may be misdiagnosed thus preventing timely antifungal therapy. Moreover, HIV-negative patients with T. marneffei infection may be congenitally immunocompromised because of the mutation of immune-related genes. CASE PRESENTATION: We describe a case of an HIV-negative child who developed disseminated T. marneffei infection in a nonendemic area. Chest CT showed similar imaging changes of miliary pulmonary tuberculosis, while there was no other evidence of tuberculosis infection, and empirical antituberculosis treatment was not effective. Lymphocyte subset analysis showed reduced natural killer cells, and the immunoglobulin profile showed low levels of IgM, C3 and C4. A bone marrow smear revealed T. marneffei infection, and ascites culture also proved T. marneffei infection. Despite antifungal treatment, the child died of multiple organ failure. Two gene mutations in caspase recruitment domain-containing protein 9 (CARD9) were detected, which had not been reported previously in T. marneffei-infected patients. CONCLUSIONS: HIV-negative patients with CARD9 mutations may be potential hosts of T. marneffei. Abnormalities in the immunoglobin profile and lymphocyte subset may provide clues for immunocompromised patients, and further genetic testing is advised to identify gene mutations in HIV-negative patients with T. marneffei infection.","You, Cheng-yan; Hu, Fang; Lu, Si-wei; Pi, Dan-dan; Xu, Feng; Liu, Cheng-jun; Fu, Yue-qiang",Mycopathologia,46,30

We demonstrate its use on a meaningful example of a complex network of U.S. domestic passenger airlines aiming to control flight delays. Using the real data on such delays, we build a flight delay network for each airline. Analyzing these networks, we uncover and formalize their dynamics. We use this formalization to design the optimal control for the flight delay networks. The results of applying this control to the ground truth data on flight delays demonstrate the low costs of the optimal control and significant reduction of delay times, while the costs of the delays unabated by control are high. Thus, the introduced here framework benefits the passengers, the airline companies and the airports.","Niu, Xiang; Jiang, Chunheng; Gao, Jianxi; Korniss, Gyorgy; Szymanski, Boleslaw K.",Sci Rep,46,30

The LSPR sensing array was fabricated by nanoimprinting and gold sputter on a polycarbonate (PC) substrate. The polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) microfluidic channels and PC LSPR sensing array were bound together through (3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane (APTES) surface treatment and oxygen plasma treatment. The resonant spectrum of the LSPR sensing device was obtained by broadband white-light illumination and polarized wavelength measurements with a spectrometer. The sensitivity of the LSPR sensing device was measured using various ratios of glycerol to water solutions with different refractive indices. Multiplex detection was demonstrated using human immunoglobulin G (IgG), IgA, and IgM. The anti-IgG, anti-IgA, and anti-IgM were separately modified in each sensing region. Various concentrations of human IgG, IgA, and IgM were prepared to prove the concept that the parallel sensing device can be used to detect different targets.","Lu, Yi-Jung; Hsieh, Han-Yun; Kuo, Wen-Chang; Wei, Pei-Kuen; Sheen, Horn-Jiunn; Tahara, Hidetoshi; Chiu, Te-Wei; Fan, Yu-Jui",Polymers (Basel),46,30

We previously reported that measles virus (MeV), which possesses an RNA genome, induces rapid antiviral responses, followed by comprehensive downregulation of host gene expression in epithelial cells. Interestingly, gene ontology analysis indicated that genes encoding mitochondrial proteins are enriched among the list of downregulated genes. To evaluate mitochondrial stress after MeV infection, we first observed the mitochondrial morphology of infected cells and found that significantly elongated mitochondrial networks with a hyperfused phenotype were formed. In addition, an increased amount of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in the cytosol was detected during progression of infection. Based on these results, we show that cytosolic mtDNA released from hyperfused mitochondria during MeV infection is captured by cGAS and causes consequent priming of the DNA sensing pathway in addition to canonical RNA sensing. We also ascertained the contribution of cGAS to the in vivo pathogenicity of MeV. In addition, we found that other viruses that induce downregulation of mitochondrial biogenesis as seen for MeV cause similar mitochondrial hyperfusion and cytosolic mtDNA-priming antiviral responses. These findings indicate that the mtDNA-activated cGAS pathway is critical for full innate control of certain viruses, including RNA viruses that cause mitochondrial stress.","Sato, Hiroki; Hoshi, Miho; Ikeda, Fusako; Fujiyuki, Tomoko; Yoneda, Misako; Kai, Chieko",PLoS Pathog,46,30

Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is associated with the occurrence of cervical cancer. Thus, developing an effective and low-cost vaccine against HPV infection, especially in developing countries is an important issue. In this study, a novel HPV L1-E7 fusion multiepitope construct designed by immunoinformatics tools was expressed in bacterial system. HEK-293T cells-derived exosomes were generated and characterized to use as a carrier for crocin and curcumin compounds. The exosomes loaded with crocin and curcumin compounds as a chemotherapeutic agent (ExoCrocin and ExoCurcumin) were used along with the L1-E7 polypeptide for evaluation of immunological and anti-tumor effects in C57BL/6 mouse model. In vitro studies showed that ExoCrocin and ExoCurcumin were not cytotoxic at a certain dose, and they could enter tumor cells. In vivo studies indicated that combination of the L1-E7 polypeptide with ExoCrocin or ExoCurcumin could produce a significant level of immunity directed toward Th1 response and CTL activity. These regimens showed the protective and therapeutic effects against tumor cells (the percentage of tumor-free mice: ~100%). In addition, both ExoCrocin and ExoCurcumin represented similar immunological and anti-tumor effects. Generally, the use of exosomal crocin or curcumin forms along with the L1-E7 polypeptide could significantly induce T-cell immune responses and eradicate tumor cells.","Abbasifarid, Elnaz; Bolhassani, Azam; Irani, Shiva; Sotoodehnejadnematalahi, Fattah",PLoS One,46,30

RECENT FINDINGS: Reports describe economic burdens, social support, sexuality, BCRL patient-education needs, and interventions to reduce BCRL symptoms and improve QOL among women with breast cancer. The psychosocial impact of BCRL may differ between younger and older women which has implications for age-related interventions to reduce the adverse psychosocial experiences of women with BCRL. We did not locate studies reporting the psychosocial impact of BCRL on male breast cancer survivors. SUMMARY: More psychosocial-based interventions are needed that target the concerns of those with BCRL, including age-related needs, sexual concerns, body image, and social support. Future research is indicated to study the psychosocial impact of BCRL among men. Researchers may consider how pandemic-driven health care policies affect the psychosocial needs of those with BCRL.","Eaton, L. H.; Narkthong, N.; Hulett, J. M.",Curr Breast Cancer Rep,46,30

In many scientific fields and disciplines, institutional norms treat data, models, and resources as proprietary, emphasizing competition among scientists and researchers locally and internationally. Concurrently, long‐standing norms of open data and collaboration exist in some scientific fields and have accelerated within the last two decades. In both cases—where the institutional arrangements are ready to accelerate for the needed collaboration in a pandemic and where they run counter to what is needed—the rules of the game are “on the table” for institutional‐level renegotiation. These challenges to the negotiated order in science are important, difficult to study, and highly consequential. The COVID‐19 pandemic offers something of a natural experiment to study these dynamics. Preliminary findings highlight: the chilling effect of politics where open sharing could be expected to accelerate; the surprisingly conservative nature of contests and prizes; open questions around whether collaboration will persist following an inflection point in the pandemic; and the strong potential for launching and sustaining pre‐competitive initiatives.","Cutcher‐Gershenfeld, Joel; Baker, Karen S.; Berente, Nicholas; Berkman, Paul Arthur; Canavan, Pat; Feltus, F.

We considered two scenarios. The first scenario has two channels of transmission over the economic system: a negative shock of labor supply due to the rates of morbidity and mortality caused by the pandemic, and a temporary shutdown of nonessential economic activities. The second scenario adds to the first the effects of the government fiscal package adopted to counteract the effects of COVID‐19 on the economy. Furthermore, in both scenarios, a sensitive analysis related to the temporality of the shutdown is considered by assuming 3 and 6 months of shutdown. The results indicate a reduction of 3.78% in the national GDP growth rate in Scenario 1 and a reduction of 0.48% in Scenario 2, in 2020, with 3 months of shutdown. With 6 months, the reduction would be greater, 10.90% and 7.64% in Scenarios 1 and 2, respectively. Thus, the government fiscal stimulus considered in this study partially mitigates the reduction in GDP projected under the COVID‐19 outbreak. The study also presents sectoral projections at the national and state levels. The estimates indicate reductions in the GDP of most of Brazilian states in both scenarios.","Porsse, Alexandre A.; de Souza, Kênia B.; Carvalho, Terciane S.; Vale, Vinícius A.",,46,30

Recently, the occurrences and effects of these factors on global economic activities, and thus container port logistics, have been intensified by the COVID-19 pandemic. Enabling flexibility in port logistics is more important than ever to navigate uncertainties, now and in the post-COVID-19 world. This paper seeks to develop a conceptual framework to holistically capture different dimensions of container port logistics capacity. A systematic literature review method is employed to formulate a conceptual framework depicting the structure of various elements of capacity and the interplay among the logistics triad of transport carriers, port operators, and logistics service providers whose interactions and service capacities constitute the overall capacity of the system. The study reveals four dimensions of port logistics capacity, namely seaside interface, platform, landside interface, and system-wide, each of which consists of subelements that can be distinguished into static or adjustable. The proposed framework provides insights corresponding to the logistics triad roles and interactions within the system for understanding uncertainty characteristics, assessing various elements of capacity, and identifying potential levers to build flexibility into these interrelated capacity elements.","Russell, Dawn; Ruamsook, Kusumal; Roso, Violeta",Marit Econ Logist,46,30

METHODS: We conducted an uncontrolled before-and-after study to test whether the introduction of disinfection with 2% chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG) and 70% isopropyl alcohol (IPA) of the exposed circuits and hub in patients treated with ECMO would affect the rate of blood stream infection (BSI) and microbial colonization of the ECMO catheter. We compared the microbiological and clinical data before and after the intervention. RESULTS: A total of 1740 ECMO catheter days in 192 patients were studied. These were divided into 855 ECMO catheter days in 96 patients before and 885 ECMO catheter days in 96 patients during the intervention. The rates of BSI were significantly decreased during the intervention period at 11.7/1000 ECMO catheter days before vs. 2.3/1000 ECMO catheter days during (difference 9.4, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.5–17.3, p = 0.019). Furthermore, the colonization of the ECMO catheter was similarly significantly reduced during the intervention period at 10.5/1000 ECMO catheter days before vs. 2.3/1000 ECMO catheter days during intervention (difference 8.3, 95% CI 0.7–15.8, p = 0.032). Hospital mortality (41.7% vs. 24%, p = 0.009) and sepsis-related death (17.7% vs. 6.3%, p = 0.014) were also significantly decreased during intervention. CONCLUSION: Extensive disinfection of exposed ECMO circuits and hub with 2% CHG/IPA was associated with a reduction in both BSI and microbial colonization of ECMO catheters. A further randomized controlled study is required to verify these results.

In 2018, The World Health Organization R&D Blueprint identified a list of priority diseases for accelerated research based on their potential to cause a public health emergency. Among these diseases were Severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (MERS-CoV). To facilitate a rapid research response during an outbreak, standardized research protocols must be prepared before the outbreak occurs. The aim of this systematic review is to identify the most common clinical research questions asked during outbreaks of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV to inform future clinical research protocol development for coronaviruses. METHODS: Medline, Embase, and Global Health bibliographic databases were searched to identify clinical studies published on SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV in the outbreak setting. Studies were grouped thematically according to the clinical research question addressed. RESULTS: From the research questions and objectives, eleven themes in the literature were identified: Clinical characterisation, prognosis, diagnosis, clinical management, viral pathogenesis, epidemiological characterisation, infection prevention and control, transmission, susceptibility, psychosocial, and aetiology. Case series made up the highest proportion of study designs, while clinical trials made up the lowest. 83% of the SARS-CoV studies were published after the end of the outbreak.

To facilitate the interpretation of total and differential white blood cell counts in pediatric patients, the present study investigated age-dependent changes in total and differential white blood cell counts in healthy reference children. METHODS Data were obtained from the Pediatric Reference Intervals in China study (PRINCE), which aims to establish and verify pediatric reference intervals for Chinese children based on a nationwide multicenter cross-sectional study from January 2017 to December 2018. Quantile curves were calculated using the generalized additive models for location, shape, and scale method. The 2.5th, 50th, and 97.5th quantile curves were calculated for both total and differential white blood counts. Percent of stacked area charts were used to demonstrate the proportions of differential white blood cells. All statistical analyses were performed using R software. RESULTS Both 50th and 97.5th quantiles of total white blood cell count and monocyte count were highest at birth, then rapidly decreased in the first 6 months of life; relatively slow reduction continued until 2 years of age. The lymphocyte count was low during infancy and increased to its highest level at 6 months of age; it then exhibited moderate and continuous reduction until approximately 9 years of age. The pattern of neutrophil count changed with age in a manner opposite to that of lymphocyte count. Besides, there were two inter-sections of lymphocyte count and neutrophil count during infancy and at approximately 5 years of age, based on locally weighted regression (LOESS) analysis. There were no apparent age-related changes in eosinophil or basophil counts. CONCLUSION These data regarding age-related changes in total and differential white blood cell counts can be used to assess the health of pediatric patients and guide clinical decisions.","Li, Kun; Peng, Ya-Guang; Yan, Ruo-Hua; Song, Wen-Qi; Peng, Xiao-Xia; Ni, Xin",Chinese medical journal,46,1

To evaluate the feasibility and preliminary safety and efficacy of MT in isolated PCA occlusion stroke patients with new-generation MT devices. METHODS Endovascularly treated acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients were identified from a prospectively collected database and their baseline characteristics were noted. Clinical outcomes were angiographic recanalization, a favorable clinical outcome at 3 months on modified Rankin Scale (mRS) and visual field (VF) deficit improvement on confrontation test, rate of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), and mortality at 3 months. RESULTS A total of 355 AIS patients underwent MT from January 2018 to December 2019. Isolated PCA MT was performed in 15 consecutive patients. The mean age was 64 ± 17 years, and 9(60%) were women. Median presentation NIHSS was 9 (interquartile range 5-15). MT devices used were stent retrievers in 6 patients and combined aspiration and stent retriever in 9 patients. Complete revascularization (TICI 2c or 3) was achieved in 12/15 patients. 3-month VF normalization was seen in 7/12 of the patients. Post-procedure symptomatic ICH occurred in 1/15 of patients. mRS score of 0-2 was achieved in 9/15 of patients but one patient was dead at 3 months post procedure.

METHODS Patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 who underwent longitudinal chest CT between January 01 and February 18, 2020 were included. A total of 1316 radiomic features were extracted from the lung parenchyma window for each CT. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), Relief, Las Vegas Wrapper (LVW), L1-norm-Support Vector Machine (L1-norm-SVM), and recursive feature elimination (RFE) were applied to select the features that associated with rapid progression. Four machine learning classifiers were used for modeling, including Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Logistic Regression (LR), and Decision Tree (DT). Accordingly, 20 radiomic models were developed on the basis of 296 CT scans and validated in 74 CT scans. Model performance was determined by the receiver operating characteristic curve. RESULTS A total of 107 patients (median age, 49.0 years, interquartile range, 35-54) were evaluated. The patients underwent a total of 370 chest CT scans with a median interval of 4 days (interquartile range, 3-5 days). The combination methods of L1-norm SVM and SVM with 17 radiomic features yielded the highest performance in predicting the likelihood of rapid progression of pneumonia lesions on next CT scan, with an AUC of 0.857 (95% CI: 0.766-0.947), sensitivity of 87.5%, and specificity of 70.7%. CONCLUSIONS Our radiomic model based on longitudinal chest CT data could predict the rapid progression of pneumonia lesions, which may facilitate the CT follow-up intervals and reduce the radiation. ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE Radiomic features extracted from the current chest CT have potential in predicting the likelihood of rapid progression of pneumonia lesions on the next chest CT, which would improve clinical decision-making regarding timely treatment.","Zhang, Bin; Ni-Jia-Ti, Ma-Yi-di-Li; Yan, Ruike; An, Nan; Chen, Lv; Liu, Shuyi; Chen, Luyan; Chen, Qiuying; Li, Minmin; Chen, Zhuozhi; You, Jingjing; Dong, Yuhao; Xiong, Zhiyuan; Zhang, Shuixing",The British journal of radiology,46,31

RCCs to date were generated in mice, but rats are thought to be optimal for addiction genetic studies. Based on past literature, one inbred Spontaneously Hypertensive Rat substrain, SHR/NCrl, is predicted to exhibit a distinct behavioral profile as it relates to cocaine self-administration traits relative to another substrain, SHR/NHsd. Direct substrain comparisons are a necessary first step before implementing an RCC. We evaluated model traits for cocaine addiction risk and cocaine self-administration behaviors using a longitudinal within-subjects design. Impulsive-like and compulsive-like traits were greater in SHR/NCrl than SHR/NHsd, as were reactivity to sucrose reward, sensitivity to acute psychostimulant effects of cocaine, and cocaine use studied under fixed-ratio and tandem schedules of cocaine self-administration. Compulsive-like behavior correlated with the acute psychostimulant effects of cocaine, which in turn correlated with cocaine taking under the tandem schedule. Compulsive-like behavior also was the best predictor of cocaine seeking responses. Heritability estimates indicated that 22 %-40 % of the variances for the above phenotypes can be explained by additive genetic factors, providing sufficient genetic variance to conduct genetic mapping in F2 crosses of SHR/NCrl and SHR/NHsd. These results provide compelling support for using an RCC approach in SHR substrains to uncover candidate genes and variants that are of relevance to cocaine use disorders.","Kantak, Kathleen M; Stots, Carissa; Mathieson, Elon; Bryant, Camron D",Behavioural brain research,46,31

Biologics are mainly administered by intravenous injection but inhalation might be beneficial for the treatment of lung diseases (e.g. asthma). This review discusses biological and pharmaceutical challenges for delivery of biologics and describes promising candidates. Insufficient stability of the proteins during aerosolization and the biological environment of the lung are the main obstacles for pulmonary delivery of biologics. Novel nebulizers will improve delivery by inducing less shear stress and administration as dry powder appears suitable for delivery of biologics. Other promising strategies include pegylation and development of antibody fragments, while carrier-encapsulated systems currently play no major role in pulmonary delivery of biologics for lung disease. While development of various biologics has been halted or has shown little effects, AIR DNase, alpha1-proteinase inhibitor, recombinant neuraminidase, and heparin are currently being evaluated in phase III trials. Several biologics are being tested for the treatment of coronavirus disease (COVID)-19, and it is expected that these trials will lead to improvements in pulmonary delivery of biologics.","Fröhlich, Eleonore; Salar-Behzadi, Sharareh",European journal of pharmaceutics and biopharmaceutics : official journal of Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Pharmazeutische Verfahrenstechnik e.V,46,10

A leading suspected risk factor is their role in the essential workforce. We aimed to describe COVID-19-related risk factors among Bhutanese and Burmese refugees in the United States. METHODS We administered an anonymous online survey in May 2020 among community leaders of Bhutanese and Burmese refugees. Using a snowball sampling strategy, we invited community leaders to complete the survey and share the link with others who met inclusion criteria (English proficient, aged ≥18, currently living in the United States). We compared respondents with and without recent COVID-19 and identified risk factors for infection. RESULTS Of 218 refugees in 23 states who completed the survey from May 15 through June 1, 2020, fifteen (6.9%) reported infection with COVID-19. Being an essential worker during the pandemic (odds ratio [OR] = 5.25; 95% CI, 1.21-22.78), having an infected family member (OR = 26.92; 95% CI, 5.19-139.75), and being female (OR = 5.63; 95% CI, 1.14-27.82) were risk factors for infection. Among 33 infected family members, 23 (69.7%) were essential workers. CONCLUSION Although we had a small snowball sample, we found that working in essential industries was associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 infection among Bhutanese and Burmese refugees. We call for larger studies that include Asian immigrant subgroups, as well as immediate attention to protecting immigrant essential workers during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Zhang, Mengxi; Gurung, Ashok; Anglewicz, Philip; Yun, Katherine",Public health reports,46,17

METHODS We conducted a retrospective case series study. Patients diagnosed with severe multiple-compartment prolapse were enrolled between July 1, 2017, and March 31, 2020. Patients underwent transvaginal single-port laparoscopic pelvic reconstruction with Y-shaped mesh. Baseline data and perioperative results were collected. Patients were followed up with the POP-Q score, Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory (PFDI-20) and Pelvic Organ Prolapse/Urinary Incontinence Sexual Questionnaire short form (PISQ-12). T-test was used for statistical analysis. RESULTS Operations were successful in all 93 patients without conversion or serious complications. Mean operative time was 132.70 ± 28.02 min and estimated blood loss was 110.65 ± 56.31 ml. VAS pain score was 2.91 ± 1.16 and cosmetic score was 9.20 ± 0.60. During 1-33 months of follow-up, no recurrence or mesh exposure was observed. Five patients suffered from de novo SUI, six had constipation, two had dyspareunia, and one had persistent pelvic pain. The pre- and postoperative Aa point was +2.13 ± 1.23 vs. -2.91 ± 0.28 (P < 0.05), C point was 2.63 ± 2.41 vs. -6.86 ± 0.69 (P < 0.05), and Ap point was -0.26 ± 1.79 vs. -2.97 ± 0.16 (P < 0.05). The PFDI-20 score was 76.81 ± 32.06 vs. 18.18 ± 20.25 (P < 0.05), while the PISQ-12 score was 34.30 ± 4.17 vs. 37.20 ± 2.60 (P < 0.05), which suggested significant improvements in both physical prolapse and quality of life after surgery. CONCLUSION Transvaginal single-port laparoscopic pelvic reconstruction with Y-shaped mesh is a feasible, effective and safe treatment option for severe multiple-compartment prolapse. Patients may benefit from its mild pain level and good cosmetic effect as well as only minor mesh-related complications.","Li, Junwei; Hu, Changdong; Wang, Xiaojuan; Hua, Keqin; Chen, Yisong",International urogynecology journal,46,22

This study aims to investigate the effective factors on the biodegradation of Iranian heavy crude oil by Bacillus licheniformis. For this purpose, oil removal from the artificial seawater was studied by response surface methodology (RSM). After the screening experiments, pH (4-10), NaCl concentration (0-10 g/L), and oil concentration (500-4500 ppm) were selected as influential factors. Moreover, to evaluate the bacterial capability in bioremediation of an actual polluted site, crude oil spill with a salinity of 35 g/L was experimentally simulated. The proposed model in this study clearly shows that both selected individual factors and their interactions are significantly effective on the crude oil biodegradation capacity. The results showed that Bacillus licheniformis was able to degrade crude oil at different concentrations of oil, especially at low concentrations, which are challenging in actual polluted sites. 15%-66% removal was achieved for 500-4500 ppm of crude oil after 14 days. Furthermore, according to the obtained results, this bacterium can tolerate the salinity up to 3.5%. At this salinity level, crude oil removal was 23.43 and 25.64% in neutral and alkaline conditions, respectively. Process factors were optimized, and 54.8% of crude oil was removed at optimum conditions i.e., 3500 ppm crude oil concentration, 2.5 g/L of NaCl and pH equal to 8.5. Finally, it can be concluded that the selected bacterium of this study can be more effective in harsh environments such as hypersaline and alkaline conditions.","Khanpour-Alikelayeh, Elham; Partovinia, Ali; Talebi, Ahmad; Kermanian, Hossein",Ecotoxicology and environmental safety,46,24

AIMS To evaluate the effects of different coping strategies on mental health during COVID-19 lockdown. METHODS A representative sample for Austria was recruited through Qualtrics® in a period of 4 weeks after the lockdown started. Measurements were coping inventory (SCI), psychological quality of life (WHO-QOL BREF, psychological domain), well-being (WHO-5), depression (PHQ-9), anxiety (GAD-7), stress (PSS-10), and insomnia (ISI). Regression analyses were performed with coping strategies as predictors and mental health measures as dependent variables. RESULTS The representative sample included N = 1,005 respondents (52.7% women). Positive thinking, active stress coping and social support were found to be positive predictors for psychological life quality, well-being, and negative predictors for perceived stress, depression, anxiety, and insomnia. Alcohol and cigarette consumption was a negative predictor for psychological life quality, and well-being, and a positive predictor for perceived stress, depression, anxiety, and insomnia. Support in faith was a positive predictor for perceived stress, depression, anxiety, and insomnia. CONCLUSIONS Coping strategies are significant predictors for mental health measures. Education about positive thinking, active coping, and social support could be beneficial for dealing with a decrease in mental health due to COVID-19 pandemic.","Budimir, Sanja; Probst, Thomas; Pieh, Christoph",Journal of mental health,46,26

Delineation of the association of treatment time with outcomes would help to guide implementation. OBJECTIVE To characterize the period in which endovascular thrombectomy is associated with benefit, and the extent to which treatment delay is related to functional outcomes, mortality, and symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS Demographic, clinical, and brain imaging data as well as functional and radiologic outcomes were pooled from randomized phase 3 trials involving stent retrievers or other second-generation devices in a peer-reviewed publication (by July 1, 2016). The identified 5 trials enrolled patients at 89 international sites. EXPOSURES Endovascular thrombectomy plus medical therapy vs medical therapy alone; time to treatment. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was degree of disability (mRS range, 0-6; lower scores indicating less disability) at 3 months, analyzed with the common odds ratio (cOR) to detect ordinal shift in the distribution of disability over the range of the mRS; secondary outcomes included functional independence at 3 months, mortality by 3 months, and symptomatic hemorrhagic transformation. RESULTS Among all 1287 patients (endovascular thrombectomy + medical therapy [n = 634]; medical therapy alone [n = 653]) enrolled in the 5 trials (mean age, 66.5 years [SD, 13.1]; women, 47.0%), time from symptom onset to randomization was 196 minutes (IQR, 142 to 267). Among the endovascular group, symptom onset to arterial puncture was 238 minutes (IQR, 180 to 302) and symptom onset to reperfusion was 286 minutes (IQR, 215 to 363). At 90 days, the mean mRS score was 2.9 (95% CI, 2.7 to 3.1) in the endovascular group and 3.6 (95% CI, 3.5 to 3.8) in the medical therapy group. The odds of better disability outcomes at 90 days (mRS scale distribution) with the endovascular group declined with longer time from symptom onset to arterial puncture: cOR at 3 hours, 2.79 (95% CI, 1.96 to 3.98), absolute risk difference (ARD) for lower disability scores, 39.2%; cOR at 6 hours, 1.98 (95% CI, 1.30 to 3.00), ARD, 30.2%; cOR at 8 hours,1.57 (95% CI, 0.86 to 2.88), ARD, 15.7%; retaining statistical significance through 7 hours and 18 minutes. Among 390 patients who achieved substantial reperfusion with endovascular thrombectomy, each 1-hour delay to reperfusion was associated with a less favorable degree of disability (cOR, 0.84 [95% CI, 0.76 to 0.93]; ARD, -6.7%) and less functional independence (OR, 0.81 [95% CI, 0.71 to 0.92], ARD, -5.2% [95% CI, -8.3% to -2.1%]), but no change in mortality (OR, 1.12 [95% CI, 0.93 to 1.34]; ARD, 1.5% [95% CI, -0.9% to 4.2%]).

Yet, in many instances short-read HTS techniques are suboptimal, for example by providing insufficient phylogenetic resolution or low integrity of assembled genomes. Single-molecule and synthetic long-read (SLR) HTS methods have successfully ameliorated these limitations. In addition, nanopore sequencing has generated a number of unique analysis opportunities such as rapid molecular diagnostics and direct RNA sequencing, and both PacBio and nanopore sequencing support detection of epigenetic modifications. Although initially suffering from relatively low sequence quality, recent advances have greatly improved the accuracy of long read sequencing technologies. In spite of great technological progress in recent years, the long-read HTS methods (PacBio and nanopore sequencing) are still relatively costly, require large amounts of high-quality starting material, and commonly need specific solutions in various analysis steps.

UK FROST compared the effectiveness of pre-specified physiotherapy techniques with a steroid injection (PTSI), manipulation under anaesthesia (MUA) with a steroid injection, and arthroscopic capsular release (ACR). This review updates a 2012 review focusing on the effectiveness of MUA, ACR, hydrodilatation, and PTSI. METHODS MEDLINE, Embase, PEDro, Science Citation Index, Clinicaltrials.gov, CENTRAL, and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry were searched up to December 2018. Reference lists of included studies were screened. No language restrictions applied. Eligible studies were RCTs comparing the effectiveness of MUA, ACR, PTSI, and hydrodilatation against each other, or supportive care or no treatment, for the management of primary frozen shoulder. RESULTS Nine RCTs were included. The primary outcome of patient-reported shoulder function at long-term follow-up (> 6 months and ≤ 12 months) was reported for five treatment comparisons across four studies. Standardized mean differences (SMD) were: ACR versus MUA: 0.21 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.00 to 0.42), ACR versus supportive care: -0.13 (95% CI -1.10 to 0.83), and ACR versus PTSI: 0.33 (95% CI 0.07 to 0.59) and 0.25 (95% CI -0.34 to 0.85), all favouring ACR; MUA versus supportive care: 0 (95% CI -0.44 to 0.44) not favouring either; and MUA versus PTSI: 0.12 (95% CI -0.14 to 0.37) favouring MUA. None of these differences met the threshold of clinical significance agreed for the UK FROST and most confidence intervals included zero. CONCLUSION The findings from a recent multicentre RCT provided the strongest evidence that, when compared with each other, neither PTSI, MUA, nor ACR are clinically superior. Evidence from smaller RCTs did not change this conclusion. The effectiveness of hydrodilatation based on four RCTs was inconclusive and there remains an evidence gap.

We aimed to compare the diagnosis performed with HRM and CM and confirmed at 6 months in a multicenter randomized trial. METHODS Patients with unexplained dysphagia were randomized to undergo either CM or HRM. Motility disorders were diagnosed using the Castell and Spechler classification for CM and the Chicago classification for HRM. Diagnosis confirmation was based on clinical outcome and response to treatment after 6-month follow-up. The initial diagnosis and percentage of confirmed diagnoses were compared between the two arms (CM and HRM). RESULTS In total, 247 patients were randomized and 245 analyzed: 122 in the CM arm and 123 in the HRM arm. A manometric diagnosis was more frequently initially achieved with HRM than with CM (97% vs. 84%; P<0.01). Achalasia was more frequent in the HRM arm (26% vs. 12% in the CM arm; P<0.01) while normal examinations were more frequent in the CM arm (52% vs. 28% in the HRM arm; P<0.05). After follow-up, the initial diagnosis was confirmed in 89% of patients in the HRM arm vs. 81% in the CM arm (P=0.07). Finally, overall procedure tolerance was better with CM than with HRM (P<0.01). CONCLUSIONS This randomized trial demonstrated an improved diagnostic yield for achalasia with HRM compared with CM. Diagnoses tended to be more frequently confirmed in patients who underwent HRM, suggesting that esophageal motility disorders could be identified earlier with HRM than with CM (ClinicalTrial.gov, NCT01284894).","Roman, Sabine; Huot, Laure; Zerbib, Frank; Bruley des Varannes, Stanislas; Gourcerol, Guillaume; Coffin, Benoit; Ropert, Alain; Roux, Adeline; Mion, François",The American journal of gastroenterology,46,1

An exploratory experimental study.,21.054134,0.54043716,2021-03-08,"The Coronaviridae family includes the seven known human coronaviruses (CoV) that cause mild to moderate respiratory infections (HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1) as well as severe illness and death (MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2). Severe infections induce hyperinflammatory responses that are often intensified by host adaptive immune pathways to profoundly advance disease severity. Proinflammatory responses are triggered by CoV entry mediated by host cell surface receptors. Interestingly, five of the seven strains use three cell surface metallopeptidases (CD13, CD26, and ACE2) as receptors, whereas the others employ O-acetylated-sialic acid (a key feature of metallopeptidases) for entry. Why CoV evolved to use peptidases as their receptors is unknown, but the peptidase activities of the receptors are dispensable, suggesting the virus uses/benefits from other functions of these molecules. Indeed, these receptors participate in the immune modulatory pathways that contribute to the pathological hyperinflammatory response. This review will focus on the role of CoV receptors in modulating immune responses.","Devarakonda, Charan Kumar V; Meredith, Emily; Ghosh, Mallika; Shapiro, Linda H",Journal of immunology,46,28

Delivering these interventions via electronic health (eHealth) may help increase their scalability. OBJECTIVE This scoping review aimed to provide the first comprehensive overview of dyadic eHealth interventions for individuals of all ages affected by mental or physical illness and their family members or friends who support them. The goal was to understand how dyadic eHealth interventions have been used and to highlight areas of research needed to advance dyadic eHealth intervention development and dissemination. METHODS A comprehensive electronic literature search of PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, and PsycINFO was conducted for articles published in the English language through March 2019. Eligible records described a psychosocial eHealth intervention that intervened with both care recipients and their support person. RESULTS A total of 7113 records were reviewed of which 101 met eligibility criteria. There were 52 unique dyadic eHealth interventions identified, which were tested across 73 different trials. Of the unique interventions, 33 were conducted among dyads of children and their supporting parent, 1 was conducted with an adolescent-young adult care recipient population, and the remaining 18 were conducted among adult dyads. Interventions targeting pediatric dyads most commonly addressed a mental health condition (n=10); interventions targeting adult dyads most commonly addressed cancer (n=9). More than three-fourths of interventions (n=40) required some human support from research staff or clinicians. Most studies (n=64) specified one or more primary outcomes for care recipients, whereas less than one-fourth (n=22) specified primary outcomes for support persons. Where specified, primary outcomes were most commonly self-reported psychosocial or health factors for both care recipients (n=43) and support persons (n=18). Results of the dyadic eHealth intervention tended to be positive for care recipients, but evidence of effects for support persons was limited because of few studies specifying primary outcomes for supporters. Trials of dyadic eHealth interventions were most commonly randomized controlled trials (RCTs; n=44), and RCTs most commonly compared the dyadic eHealth intervention to usual care alone (n=22). CONCLUSIONS This first comprehensive review of dyadic eHealth interventions demonstrates that there is substantial, diverse, and growing literature supporting this interventional approach. However, several significant gaps were identified. Few studies were designed to evaluate the unique effects of dyadic interventions relative to individual interventions. There was also limited assessment and reporting of outcomes for support persons, and there were no interventions meeting our eligibility criteria specifically targeting the needs of older adult dyads. Findings highlight areas of research opportunities for developing dyadic eHealth interventions for novel populations and for increasing access to dyadic care.","Shaffer, Kelly M; Tigershtrom, Ashley; Badr, Hoda; Benvengo, Stephanie; Hernandez, Marisol; Ritterband, Lee M",Journal of medical Internet research,46,22

This situation may compromise the security of both the dissection and anastomosis. The purpose of this study was to investigate the usefulness of xiphoidectomy to overcome this issue. MATERIAL AND METHODS The files of patients who underwent total gastrectomy + D2 lymph node dissection due to proximal gastric cancer or cardia cancer between April 2002-December 2013 were retrospectively evaluated. We assessed the outcome in patients with xiphoidectomy in addition to the midline incision in terms of xiphoidectomy technique, xiphoidectomy time, and operative and postoperative complications. RESULTS Thirty cases were identified to undergo xiphoidectomy. Nineteen patients were male and 11 were female, with a mean age of 51 (21-80) years. The time required for xiphoidectomy was 7-15 minutes (mean 8.7 minutes). The mean additional time required for the closure of the incision in cases with xiphoidectomy was 2 minutes. There was minimal arterial bleeding from the diaphragmatic surface in one patient, which was controlled by electrocautery. Only two patients developed wound infection. CONCLUSION Performing xiphoidectomy is quite easy, after a certain learning phase. The operative time was 7-15 minutes longer due to excision of xiphoid and closure of the related defect. Minor hemorrhage was a problem during surgery. There were no early or late post-operative complications. We suggest that the procedure is beneficial in selected cases with requirement of a wider operative field or better exposure of the esophago-gastric junction during total gastrectomy for gastric cancer, and recommend removal of the xiphoid bone.","Mihmanlı, Mehmet; Köksal, Hakan Mustafa; Demir, Uygar; Işıl, Rıza Gürhan",Ulusal cerrahi dergisi,46,26

This study was aimed to explore development of caring and describe the 50 years of history of KSNS within the sociocultural context of Korea regarding academic footsteps, meanings, and implications for the future. METHODS This study used a historical research methodology using a literature review and bibliometric analysis. Relevant literature was reviewed and the published abstracts in the Journal of Korean Academy of Nursing (JKAN) were analyzed using VOSviewer. RESULTS Birth control and family planning in the 1970s was the main research topic. In the 1980s, the development of nursing concepts, theories, and philosophies was the mission of KSNS to extend the disciplinary boundary. In the 1990s, the progress of KSNS to become one of the woman-dominant healthcare professionals was the mission in the given period. Expanding the frontiers of KSNS to the extent of global standards was the undertaking of the nursing scholars in the 2000s. Lastly, in the 2010s, the quality and quantity improvement of KSNS and JKAN is expected to make our future even prosperous. The map visualization of the 50 years of research accumulation showed the comparable opposition of quantitative vs. qualitative research methodologies, equation modeling, and instrument development.

We aimed to determine its efficacy and long-term outcome. METHODS Prospective cohort of all patients admitted to the medical ICU of a tertiary hospital during a 2-year period and managed using NIV. Characteristics of patients, context of NIV, and treatment intensity were compared for very old and younger patients. Six-month survival and functional status were assessed in very old patients. RESULTS During the study period, 1,019 patients needed ventilatory support and 376 (37%) received NIV. Among them, 163 (16%) very old patients received ventilatory support with 60% of them managed using NIV compared with 32% of younger patients (p < 0.0001). Very old patients received NIV more frequently with DNI than in younger patients (40% vs. 8%). Such cases were associated with high mortality for both very old and younger patients. Hospital mortality was higher in very old than in younger patients but did not differ when NIV was used for cardiogenic pulmonary edema or acute-on-chronic respiratory failure (20% vs. 15%) and in postextubation (15% vs. 17%) out of a context of DNI. Six-month mortality was 51% in very old patients, 67% for DNI patients, and 77% in case of NIV failure and endotracheal intubation. Of the 30 hospital survivors, 22 lived at home and 13 remained independent for activities of daily living. CONCLUSIONS Very old patients managed using NIV have an overall satisfactory 6-month survival and functional status, except for endotracheal intubation after NIV failure.","Schortgen, Frederique; Follin, Arnaud; Piccari, Lucilla; Roche-Campo, Ferran; Carteaux, Guillaume; Taillandier-Heriche, Elodie; Krypciak, Sebastien; Thille, Arnaud W; Paillaud, Elena; Brochard, Laurent",Annals of intensive care,46,31

This study aimed to investigate how younger and older adults are regulating their emotions during the current pandemic. Specifically, this study measured potential age differences in acceptance (broken down into situational and emotional acceptance), because it has been identified as a possible underlying mechanism of the relationship between aging and reduced negative affect (Shallcross et al., Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 104(4), 734-749, 2013). Methods: Younger (N = 150) and older (N = 150) adults completed trait-level questionnaires of emotional and situational acceptance, and completed a task where they reacted to 24 negative, arousing COVID-19 news headlines, half of which were old-age focused, to capture trial-level acceptance use. Results: Older adults reported greater trait-level acceptance and used emotional acceptance more frequently than younger adults during the headlines task, especially on trials containing old-age focused headlines. Interestingly, younger adults reported reduced trial-level subjective arousal when engaging in emotional acceptance compared to active emotion regulation (suggesting beneficial affective outcomes of acceptance), while older adults reported no differences in arousal between trials when they engaged in acceptance and when they engaged in more active emotion regulation. Conclusion: We discuss potential explanations for these findings as well as present future research directions on acceptance across the lifespan.","Wolfe, Hannah E; Isaacowitz, Derek M",Aging & mental health,46,1

The flow-diverting device is an innovative and effective technique to allow securing of large, giant, and wide-neck aneurysms. In numerous studies, the flow-diverting device has shown better outcomes than coil embolization. However, the flow-diverting device has also some risks, including rupture of aneurysm, intracerebral hemorrhage, and ischemic stroke.

The patient was tolerable for 25 days, but then suddenly presented intermittent right hemiparesis. In the initial diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), there was no acute lesion; however, in the follow-up MRI, an acute ischemic stroke was found in the territory of anterior choroidal artery which was covered by Pipeline Embolization Device. We suspect that neo-intimal overgrowth or a tiny thrombus have led to this delayed complication.

OBJECTIVE To evaluate the association between acute and chronic TV (hours/week) and reported injury (yes/no) and evaluate the relationship between acute : chronic TV and injury while controlling for sex, age, and prior injury in young athletes. DESIGN Cohort study. SETTING Online surveys. PATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS Middle school-aged adolescents. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S) We conducted a baseline survey at the start of the 2017-2018 academic year. The baseline survey solicited information regarding demographics, injury history, and primary sport. Subsequent surveys were delivered electronically at the start of each week. Information obtained with the weekly survey included weekly TV and injuries sustained the previous week. Injuries were reported and classified (eg, acute or gradual onset) by the participants. Weekly TV was aggregated as rolling averages over the prior 2, 3, and 4 weeks. Acute:chronic TV was calculated for each participant for every week as the prior week TV divided by the TV during the prior 2 (1 : 2), 3 (1 : 3), and 4 (1 : 4) weeks of the study period. RESULTS A total of 244 recruits participated. Higher average TV over the prior 4 weeks (odds ratio [OR] = 0.97; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.93, 1.00; P = .05) was associated with fewer reported injuries. Additionally, higher average TV over the prior 2 (OR = 0.96; 95% CI = 0.93, 0.99; P = .04), 3 (OR = 0.95; 95% CI = 0.91, 0.99; P = .02), and 4 (OR = 0.95; 95% CI = 0.91, 0.99; P = .05) weeks was associated with fewer reported acute injuries the following week. Acute:chronic TV and any injury type were not related.

Lean is known to achieve successful results when implemented in the manufacturing sector. Typical results are operational cost reduction, cycle time reduction, and higher customer satisfaction. The service sector, however, has seen mixed results. For the last two decades, educators and healthcare professionals are trying to implement lean tools in healthcare. Some reported success and many did not, for variety of reasons. In this paper, we search the literature and reveal the special nature of healthcare services, success factors, and barriers facing implementation of lean in healthcare. We then conduct a survey of 18 elite Jordanian hospitals to study the case holistically. Statistical analysis of the survey results confirmed some of what the literature revealed; organizational leadership seems to be the most dominant factor, followed by knowledge of employees about lean, training, and patient satisfaction (customer focus). Another important finding, not captured by the literature, is that lean implementation success depends on educating physicians about continuous improvement and lean and ensuring they are part of the improvement team. Based on the revealed enablers and obstacles, we created a full lean implementation framework. This framework was then used along with selected engineering tools to implement lean in a major hospital successfully.

However, in many cases, little is known about their etiology. Montipora white syndrome (MWS) is a common disease affecting the coral Montipora capitata, a major reef builder in Hawai'i. Chronic Montipora white syndrome (cMWS) is a slow-moving form of the disease that affects M. capitata throughout the year. The effects of this chronic disease on coral immunology and microbiology are currently unknown. In this study, we use prophenoloxidase immune assays and 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing to characterize the microbiome and immunological response associated with cMWS. Our results show that immunological and microbiological responses are highly localized. Relative to diseased samples, apparently healthy portions of cMWS corals differed in immune activity and in the relative abundance of microbial taxa. Coral tissues with cMWS showed decreased tyrosinase-type catecholase and tyrosinase-type cresolase activity and increased laccase-type activity. Catecholase and cresolase activity were negatively correlated across all tissue types with microbiome richness. The localized effect of cMWS on coral microbiology and immunology is likely an important reason for the slow progression of the disease. This local confinement may facilitate interventions that focus on localized treatments on tissue types. This study provides an important baseline to understand the interplay between the microbiome and immune system and the mechanisms used by corals to manage chronic microbial perturbations associated with white syndrome.","Brown, Tanya; Sonett, Dylan; Zaneveld, Jesse R; Padilla-Gamiño, Jaqueline L",Molecular ecology,46,27

Impediments to address this question are primarily due to critical experimental barriers. An integrated perspective on large scale neural information processing requires an in vivo approach that can combine the advantages of exhaustively observing all neurons dedicated to a given type of stimulus, and simultaneously achieve a resolution that is precise enough to capture individual neuron activity. Current experimental data from in vivo observations are either restricted to a small fraction of the total number of neurons, or are based on larger brain volumes but at a low spatial and temporal resolution. Consequently, fundamental questions as to how sensory information is represented on a population scale remain unanswered. In Drosophila melanogaster, the mushroom body (MB) represents an excellent model to analyze sensory coding and memory plasticity. In this work, we present an experimental setup coupled with a dedicated computational method that provides in vivo measurements of the activity of hundreds of densely packed somata uniformly spread in the MB. We exploit spinning-disk confocal 3D imaging over time of the whole MB cell body layer in vivo while it is exposed to olfactory stimulation. Importantly, to derive individual signal from densely packed somata, we have developed a fully automated image analysis procedure that takes advantage of the specificities of our data. After anisotropy correction, our approach operates a dedicated spot detection and registration over the entire time sequence to transform trajectories to identifiable clusters. This enabled us to discard spurious detections and reconstruct missing ones in a robust way. We demonstrate that this approach outperformed existing methods in this specific context and made possible high-throughput analysis of approximately 500 single somata uniformly spread over the MB in various conditions. Applying this approach, we find that learned experiences change the population code of odor representations in the MB. After long-term memory (LTM) formation, we quantified an increase in responsive somata count and a stable single neuron signal. We predict that this method, which should further enable studying the population pattern of neuronal activity, has the potential to uncover fine details of sensory processing and memory plasticity.","Delestro, Felipe; Scheunemann, Lisa; Pedrazzani, Mélanie; Tchenio, Paul; Preat, Thomas; Genovesio, Auguste",Scientific reports,46,16

There has been a substantial reduction in neurosurgical operations during the period of lockdown. The lockdown might be the most effective measure to curtail viral transmission. Once we return to the normalization of the lifestyle, there will be a backlog of unoperated pending cases along with the possibility of further spread of the coronavirus. Methods We reviewed the available literature and protocols for neurosurgical practice in different geographic locations. We drafted a consensus statement based on the literature and protocols suggested by the World Health Organization (WHO) and various professional societies to prevent the spread of SARS-COV2 while streamlining the neurosurgical practice. Results The consensus statement suggests the patient triage, workflow, resource distribution, and operational efficacy for care providers at different stages of management. The priority is set at personal protection while ensuring patients' safety, timely management, and capacity building. We performed a detailed subsection analysis for the management of trauma and set up for COVID-free hospitals for simultaneous management of routine neurosurgical indications. In this time of medicolegal upheaval, special consent from the patients should be taken in view of the chances of delay in management and the added risk of corona infection. The consensus statements are applicable to neurosurgical setups of all capacities. Conclusion Along with the glaring problem of infection, there is another threat of neurosurgery emergency building up. This wave may overwhelm the already stretched systems to the hilt.

As of late April, 2020, 895,766 cases of COVID-19 infections were recorded in the United States. This infection was responsible for 50,439 deaths. Because of close, person-to-person proximity, coupled with possible contact with body fluids, transmission of COVID-19 during sexual activity is possible. However, some activities carry higher risks of transmission than others. This article explores the risks of COVID-19 transmission associated with kissing, oral sex (fellatio and annilingus), and anal receptive and anal insertive intercourse among men who have sex with men (MSM). Recommendations for counseling MSM on safer sexual decision-making, many of which are applicable in the general prevention of sexually transmitted infections, are also provided. Nurse practitioners can serve as advocates in preventing sexually associated COVID-19 communication in MSM and contribute to the advancement of this continuously evolving area of public health science.","Blackwell, Christopher W",Journal of the American Association of Nurse Practitioners,46,16

The management of infection prevention and control during emergency surgery of COVID-19 patients has been outlined and the perioperative infection management checklist for emergency surgery of COVID-19 patients has been summarized and validated. There have been 13 emergency surgeries performed on COVID-19 patients at our hospital during this time. Two cases were cured and discharged, and the others were discharged after improvement and transferred to further rehabilitation, 30-day mortality of the emergency surgical is 0%. Once the emergency surgery protocol in the hospital is successfully established, emergency surgery can be performed as soon as the surgical planning decision is made, and the operating room can be prepared for use at any time. The incidence of surgical site infection (SSI) was largely higher than that of ordinary patients in the same time; however, the successful implementation of emergency surgery for COVID-19 had positive significance in reducing the incidence of death, risk of bleeding, and hypoxia. The current cumulative cure rate of COVID-19 in our hospital is 98%, patient mortality rate is 0%, and the incidence of COVID-19 infection in medical staff is 0%. The emergency surgical infection management checklist is feasible and effective in guiding the preoperative and intraoperative surgical procedures.","Ni, Lingmei; Zhou, Yanan; Ni, Zuowei; Ma, Yifang; Fen, Haiting; Wang, Fang; Zhang, Sheng; Fei, Xiaofang; Pan, Qunying; Hong, Xinzheng; Qu, Tingting; Zhong, Zifeng; Chen, Zuobing",Annals of palliative medicine,46,1

Interventions that teach against this myth are largely absent from required medical curricula. Here, we describe and present student and facilitator evaluations of an educational intervention, organised around Dorothy Roberts' book Fatal Invention: How Science, Politics, and Big Business Re-Create Race in the Twenty-First Century that included a discussion of preselected chapters from Fatal Invention, case studies illustrating strategies to prevent the misuse of race in medicine and a question-and-answer session with Dorothy Roberts. METHODS Online feedback surveys were distributed to students and facilitators to capture their general perceptions of the session, how well it satisfied its objectives and the pre-session training materials provided to facilitators. Quantitative measures were analysed using descriptive statistics, and qualitative responses were evaluated using thematic analysis. RESULTS Student and facilitator surveys garnered response rates of 59.8% (61/102) and 75% (30/40), respectively, and most expressed satisfaction with the session. Students felt more prepared to address the misuse of race in clinical contexts than in pre-clinical contexts (90.16% vs. 77.05%) and among peers than among superiors (95.08% vs. 72.13%) (p < 0.05). Some students (31.15%) felt that their small group facilitators were unprepared to address microaggressions. DISCUSSION Our survey responses suggest that this intervention was effective in teaching against biological racism and equipped students with tools to address the misuse of race, particularly in clinical contexts. Future iterations should highlight strategies to confront biological racism in pre-clinical contexts and among superiors.","Degife, Ellelan; Ijeli, Chinye; Muhammad, Muzzammil Imran; Nobles, Autumn; Reisman, Anna",The clinical teacher,46,0

Here, we used Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) as the alpha-coronavirus model, and investigated the antiviral properties of curcumin against TGEV. Our results demonstrated that curcumin strongly inhibited TGEV proliferation and viral protein expression in a dose-dependent manner. We also observed that curcumin exhibited direct virucidal abilities in a dose-, temperature- and time-dependent manner. Furthermore, time-of-addition assays showed that curcumin mainly acted in the early phase of TGEV replication. Notably, in an adsorption assay, curcumin at 40 µM resulted in a reduction in viral titres of 3.55 log TCID50 ml-1, indicating that curcumin possesses excellent inhibitory effects on the adsorption of TGEV. Collectively, we demonstrate for the first time that curcumin has virucidal activity and virtual inhibition against TGEV, suggesting that curcumin might be a candidate drug for effective control of TGEV infection.","Li, Yaoming; Wang, Jing; Liu, Yinchuan; Luo, Xiang; Lei, Weiqiang; Xie, Lilan",The Journal of general virology,46,1

METHODS We retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of 44 infants who were ventilated for AHRF after congenital heart surgery between January 2020 and January 2021. HFOV alone was used in 23 of the 44 infants, whereas HFOV-VG was used in the other 21 infants. RESULTS The average frequency tidal volume (VThf) of the HFOV-VG group was lower than that of the HFOV group, and the proportion of VThf exceeding the target range of infants in the HFOV-VG group was also lower (p < .01). In addition, the incidence of hypocapnia and hypercapnia in infants supported with HFOV-VG was significantly lower (p < .01). Furthermore, the duration of invasive ventilation and the median ventilator adjustment per hour in the HFOV-VG group was also lower than that in the HFOV group (p < .01). CONCLUSIONS Compared with HFOV alone, HFOV-VG decreases the fluctuation of VThf and the incidence of hypercapnia and hypocapnia. Moreover, it reduces the workload of bedside medical staff. Further studies are needed to confirm the efficacy and safety of HFOV-VG as a routine respiratory support strategy for congenital heart disease during the perioperative period.","Zheng, Yi-Rong; Xie, Wen-Peng; Liu, Jian-Feng; Wu, Hong-Lin; Xu, Ning; Huang, Shu-Ting; Cao, Hua; Chen, Qiang",Pediatric pulmonology,46,26

Chronic adversity such as discrimination or racism as trauma may perpetuate health inequities in marginalized populations. There is a growing body of the literature on trauma informed and culturally competent care as essential elements of promoting health equity, yet no prior review has systematically addressed trauma informed interventions. The purpose of this study was to appraise the types, setting, scope, and delivery of trauma informed interventions and associated outcomes. METHODS We performed database searches- PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, SCOPUS and PsycINFO-to identify quantitative studies published in English before June 2019. Thirty-two unique studies with one companion article met the eligibility criteria. RESULTS More than half of the 32 studies were randomized controlled trials (n = 19). Thirteen studies were conducted in the United States. Child abuse, domestic violence, or sexual assault were the most common types of trauma addressed (n = 16). While the interventions were largely focused on reducing symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (n = 23), depression (n = 16), or anxiety (n = 10), trauma informed interventions were mostly delivered in an outpatient setting (n = 20) by medical professionals (n = 21). Two most frequently used interventions were eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (n = 6) and cognitive behavioral therapy (n = 5). Intervention fidelity was addressed in 16 studies. Trauma informed interventions significantly reduced PTSD symptoms in 11 of 23 studies. Fifteen studies found improvements in three main psychological outcomes including PTSD symptoms (11 of 23), depression (9 of 16), and anxiety (5 of 10). Cognitive behavioral therapy consistently improved a wide range of outcomes including depression, anxiety, emotional dysregulation, interpersonal problems, and risky behaviors (n = 5). CONCLUSIONS There is inconsistent evidence to support trauma informed interventions as an effective approach for psychological outcomes. Future trauma informed intervention should be expanded in scope to address a wide range of trauma types such as racism and discrimination. Additionally, a wider range of trauma outcomes should be studied.","Han, Hae-Ra; Miller, Hailey N; Nkimbeng, Manka; Budhathoki, Chakra; Mikhael, Tanya; Rivers, Emerald; Gray, Ja'Lynn; Trimble, Kristen; Chow, Sotera; Wilson, Patty",PloS one,46,1

This has spurred a growing body of literature on lifestyle recommendations pertaining to nutrition, sleep and exercise for treating paediatric depression. AIMS Paediatric depression clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) were reviewed for quality and to catalogue recommendations on nutrition, sleep and exercise made by higher-quality CPGs. METHOD Searches were conducted in Medline, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Web of Science and CINAHL, and grey literature CPGs databases for relevant CPGs. Eligible CPGs with a minimum or high-quality level, as determined by the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation, Second Edition instrument, were included if they were (a) paediatric; (b) CPGs, practice parameter or consensus or expert committee recommendations; (c) for depression; (d) the latest version and (e) lifestyle recommendations for nutrition, sleep or exercise. Key information extracted included author(s), language, year of publication, country, the institutional body issuing the CPG, target disorder, age group, lifestyle recommendation and the methods used to determine CPG lifestyle recommendations. RESULTS Ten paediatric CPGs for depression with a minimum or high-quality level contained recommendations on nutrition, sleep or exercise. Lifestyle recommendations were predominately qualitative, with quantitative details only outlined in two CPGs for exercise. Most recommendations were brief general statements, with 50% lacking supporting evidence from the literature. CONCLUSIONS Interest in lifestyle interventions for treatment in child and youth depression is growing. However, current CPG lifestyle recommendations for nutrition, sleep or exercise are based on expert opinion rather than clinical trials.","Campisi, Susan C; Krause, Karolin R; Chan, Benjamin W C; Courtney, Darren B; Bennett, Kathryn; Korczak, Daphne J; Szatmari, Peter",BJPsych open,46,1

Intestinal ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury is a consequence of acute mesenteric ischemia, caused by inadequate blood flow through the mesenteric vessels, resulting in intestinal damage. Reperfusion following ischemia can further exacerbate damage of the intestine. The mechanisms of IR injury are complex and poorly understood. Therefore, experimental small animal models are critical for understanding the pathophysiology of IR injury and the development of novel therapies. Here we describe a mouse model of acute intestinal IR injury that provides reproducible injury of the small intestine without mortality. This is achieved by inducing ischemia in the region of the distal ileum by temporally occluding the peripheral and terminal collateral branches of the superior mesenteric artery for 60 min using microvascular clips. Reperfusion for 1 hr, or 2 hr after injury results in reproducible injury of the intestine examined by histological analysis. Proper position of the microvascular clips is critical for the procedure. Therefore the video clip provides a detailed visual step-by-step description of this technique. This model of intestinal IR injury can be utilized to study the cellular and molecular mechanisms of injury and regeneration.","Gubernatorova, Ekaterina O; Perez-Chanona, Ernesto; Koroleva, Ekaterina P; Jobin, Christian; Tumanov, Alexei V",Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,46,1

Most of the researches focus on the qualitative properties or observations. In this research, we model the behaviours and collective intelligence of SARS-CoV-2 by minimal spanning trees (MSTs), which specify the underlying mechanisms of resource allocation in the viral colony. The vertices of the trees are 50 states, DC and NYC in the USA. The weights of the edges are assigned by the reciprocal of the sum of cases or deaths of COVID-19. The types of trees are decided by the chosen 18 factors. We sample 304 time-series data and compute their MST-based auto-correlations for stability analysis. Then we perform correlated analysis and comparative analysis on these stable factors. Our results show MST approach fits the collective intelligence modelling very well; the total cases and total deaths over areas are highly correlated in terms of MSTs; and these stable factors have little to do with the geographical distance. The results also indicate the colonisation of SARS-CoV-2 is pretty mature and organised. Based on the results, for environmental or health policies, we should also turn our attention to the transmission routes that are independent of or far away from human population or densities. The viruses' colonies might already exist in the wild in a large scale, not only in the populated or polluted cities. We shall build or conduct a monitoring system of their colonisation and survival techniques, in order to terminate, contain or live with their communities.","Chen, Ray-Ming",Environmental research,46,1

To minimize the risk of this complication, capsulectomy is performed using monopolar cautery or ultrasonic surgical instrumentation, the latter of which can be conducted with a Harmonic scalpel. To date, there is disagreement regarding which of the two methods is superior. The purpose of this study was to compare postoperative outcomes between a group of patients who underwent surgery using a Harmonic scalpel and another group treated with monopolar cautery. Methods A retrospective chart review was conducted of patients who underwent capsulectomy as part of two-stage breast reconstruction between January 2018 and February 2019 and who received at least 1 month of follow-up after surgery. Operative time and postoperative outcomes, including drainage duration, were analyzed. Results In total, 36 female patients underwent capsulectomy. The monopolar group consisted of 18 patients and 22 breasts, while the Harmonic scalpel group consisted of 18 patients and 21 breasts. There was no statistically significant difference in demographics between the two groups. The Harmonic scalpel group had a significantly shorter mean drainage duration (6.65 days vs. 7.36 days) and a smaller mean total drainage volume (334.69 mL vs. 433.54 mL) than the monopolar cautery group (P<0.05). No statistically significant difference was observed with regard to seroma or hematoma formation. Conclusions The Harmonic scalpel approach for capsulectomy reduced the total drainage volume and drainage duration compared to the monopolar cautery approach. Therefore, this approach could serve as a good alternative to electrocautery.","Kim, Ki Jae; Chung, Jae Ho; Lee, Hyung Chul; Lee, Byung Il; Park, Seung Ha; Yoon, Eul Sik",Archives of plastic surgery,46,7

METHODS Cross-sectional study, using data from the ConVid survey, between April and May 2020. The following variables were evaluated: lifestyle and presence of one or more NCDs (diabetes, hypertension, respiratory disease, heart disease, and cancer). Sociodemographic characteristics were used as adjustment. Relative frequencies and confidence intervals (CI) of 95% of the explanatory variables were calculated before and during the pandemic. For the comparison of groups, with or without NCDs, crude and adjusted (PRadj) prevalence ratios were estimated by Poisson regression. RESULTS There was a reduction in physical activity (60% in those without NCDs and 58% in those with NCDs) and in vegetable consumption (10.8% in those without NCDs and 12.7% in those with NCDs). On the other hand, there was an increase in the time spent watching television and on screens of computer/tablet (302% and 43.5% in those without NCDs and 196.5% and 30.6% with NCDs, respectively); consumption of frozen meals (43.6% in those without NCDs and 53.7% with NCDs), snacks (42.3% without NCDs and 31.2% with NCDs), and chocolate (14.8% without NCDs).

Faecal shedding of SARS-CoV-2 RNA from COVID-19 patients has extensively been reported. Therefore, we investigated the occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in six wastewater treatments plants (WWTPs) serving the major municipalities within the Region of Murcia (Spain), the area with the lowest COVID-19 prevalence within Iberian Peninsula. Firstly, an aluminum hydroxide adsorption-precipitation concentration method was validated using a porcine coronavirus (Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus, PEDV) and mengovirus (MgV). The procedure resulted in average recoveries of 10 ± 3.5% and 10 ± 2.1% in influent water (n = 2) and 3.3 ± 1.6% and 6.2 ± 1.0% in effluent water (n = 2) samples for PEDV and MgV, respectively. Then, the method was used to monitor the occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 from March 12 to April 14, 2020 in influent, secondary and tertiary effluent water samples. By using the real-time RT-PCR (RT-qPCR) Diagnostic Panel validated by US CDC that targets three regions of the virus nucleocapsid (N) gene, we estimated quantification of SARS-CoV-2 RNA titers in untreated wastewater samples of 5.4 ± 0.2 log10 genomic copies/L on average. Two secondary water samples resulted positive (2 out of 18) and all tertiary water samples tested as negative (0 out 12). This environmental surveillance data were compared to declared COVID-19 cases at municipality level, revealing that members of the community were shedding SARS-CoV-2 RNA in their stool even before the first cases were reported by local or national authorities in many of the cities where wastewaters have been sampled. The detection of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater in early stages of the spread of COVID-19 highlights the relevance of this strategy as an early indicator of the infection within a specific population. At this point, this environmental surveillance could be implemented by municipalities right away as a tool, designed to help authorities to coordinate the exit strategy to gradually lift its coronavirus lockdown.","Randazzo, Walter; Truchado, Pilar; Cuevas-Ferrando, Enric; Simón, Pedro; Allende, Ana; Sánchez, Gloria",Water research,46,31

The primary aim of this article is to examine the available evidence to recommend how MX can best be used for various purposes. Although much of the literature published within the last 20 years focuses on using MX for lymphatic filariasis elimination, a growing body of evidence supports its use in early warning systems for emerging infectious diseases (EIDs). An MX system design must consider the goal and target (e.g. diseases targeted for elimination versus EIDs), mosquito and pathogen characteristics, and context (e.g. setting and health system). MX is currently used as a 'supplement' to human surveillance and will not be considered as a 'replacement' until the correlation between pathogen-infection rates in human and mosquito populations is better understood. Establishing such relationships may not be feasible in elimination scenarios, due to increasingly dwindling human infection prevalence after successful control, but may still be possible for EIDs and in integrated disease surveillance systems.

To define a possible pathway for WBV-IMR, this study investigated the effects of WBV amplitude on WBV-IMR latency by surface electromyography analysis of the soleus muscle in human adult volunteers. The tendon (T) reflex was also induced to evaluate the level of presynaptic Ia inhibition during WBV. WBV-IMR latency was shorter when induced by low- as compared to medium- or high-amplitude WBV (33.9±5.3msvs. 43.8±3.6 and 44.1±4.2ms, respectively). There was no difference in latencies between T-reflex elicited before WBV (33.8±2.4ms) and WBV-IMR induced by low-amplitude WBV. Presynaptic Ia inhibition was absent during low-amplitude WBV but was present during medium- and high-amplitude WBV. Consequently, WBV induces short- or long-latency reflexes depending on the vibration amplitude. During low-amplitude WBV, muscle spindle activation may induce the short- but not the long-latency WBV-IMR. Furthermore, unlike the higher amplitude WBV, low-amplitude WBV does not induce presynaptic inhibition at the Ia synaptic terminals.","Karacan, Ilhan; Cidem, Muharrem; Cidem, Mehmet; Türker, Kemal S",Journal of electromyography and kinesiology : official journal of the International Society of Electrophysiological Kinesiology,46,31

METHODS This retrospective case-control study was aimed at identifying the possible genes involved in implant failure in Down syndrome patients by matching the periodontal disease variable by means of a retrospective case-control study. This process involved using the functional analysis of gene expression software Transcriptome Analysis Console (TAC, Affymetrix, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and a search for the possible candidate genes involved. Focus was placed on the 92 genes related to the inflammation identified from the TaqMan™ Array Plate Human Inflammation Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). RESULTS Six genes showed statistically significant results (p < 0.05) in our comparison. Three of them-PLCG2 (p = 0.0333), ALOX5 (p = 0.03) and LTAH4 (p = 0.0081)-were overexpressed in the implant reject group, and the following three were down-regulated: VCAM1 (p = 0.0182), PLA2G2A (p = 0.0034) and PLA2G10 (p = 0.047). CONCLUSION Statistically significant differences exist in the gene expression involved in osteoclastogenesis, inflammatory response and host defensive response.","Baus-Domínguez, Maria; Gómez-Díaz, Raquel; Corcuera-Flores, Jose-Ramón; Torres-Lagares, Daniel; Ruiz-Villandiego, José-Cruz; Machuca-Portillo, Guillermo; Gutiérrez-Pérez, José-Luis; Serrera-Figallo, María-Angeles",Journal of clinical medicine,46,24

Bacterial resistance pattern was evaluated in 50 patients. A spectrophotometer device equipped with UV and electrophoresis of the extracted samples on agarose gel for antibiogram test were used. PCR test 15 minutes after tooth extraction showed that bacterial strains were extracted from 16 patients. Lactobacillus, Enterococcus faecalis (E. faecalis), Streptococcus sanguinis (S. sanguinis), Streptococcus salivarius (S. salivarius), and Streptococcus mutans (S. mutans) were extracted from 5, 4, 4, 4, and 6 patients. 100% of Lactobacillus, E. faecalis, S. sanguinis, S. salivarius, and S. mutans were sensitive to tigecycline. Most of the Lactobacillus antibiotic resistance was against tetracycline and ciprofloxacin. Antibiotic resistance in S. salivarius was observed in 75% of the cases against piperacillin-tazobactam, ciprofloxacin, and cefotaxime, while in S. mutans was 84% of the cases against ceftriaxone. The results of the current study showed that tooth extraction causes bacteremia before, during, and after tooth extraction. Generally, the highest antibiotic resistance occurred against tetracycline, ciprofloxacin, and ampicillin-sulbactam. In most cases, the bacteria showed partial resistance to these antibiotics; however, tigecycline showed 100% efficacy on all types of bacteria. Streptococcus strains (salivarius, mutans, and sanguinis) were sensitive to most of the antibiotics while antibiotic sensitivity was less evident in Lactobacillus and E. faecalis. Antibiotic resistance has become a critical issue, since it leads to treatment failure when there is a need for antibiotic therapy.","Rezazadeh, Fahimeh; Azad, Azita; Khorami, Ali; Modaresi, Farzan; Rezaie, Zahra",BioMed research international,46,1

Plasmids containing DNA/cDNA fragments of WSSV and YHV, and genomic DNAs of PmDNV and normal shrimp were used to test sensitivity of the procedure. Without the need of any probe, the products were identified by HRM analysis after real-time PCR amplification using three sets of viral specific primers. The results showed DNA melting curves that were specific for individual virus. No positive result was detected with nucleic acids from shrimp, Penaeus monodon nucleopolyhedrovirus (PemoNPV), Penaeus stylirostris densovirus (PstDNV), or Taura syndrome virus (TSV). The detection limit for PmDNV, YHV and WSSV DNAs were 40fg, 50fg, and 500fg, respectively, which was 10 times more sensitive than multiplex real-time PCR analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. In viral nucleic acid mixtures, HRM analysis clearly identified each virus in dual and triple infection. To test the capability to use this method in field, forty-one of field samples were examined by HRM analysis in comparison with agarose gel electrophoresis. For HRM analysis, 11 (26.83%), 9 (21.95%), and 4 (9.76%) were infected with WSSV, PmDNV, and YHV, respectively. Agarose gel electrophoresis detected lesser number of PmDNV infection which may due to the limit of sensitivity. No multiple infection was found in these samples. This method provides a rapid, sensitive, specific, and simultaneous detection of three major viruses making it as a useful tool for diagnosis and epidemiological studies of these viruses in shrimp and carriers.","Panichareon, Benjaporn; Khawsak, Paisarn; Deesukon, Warin; Sukhumsirichart, Wasana",Journal of virological methods,46,2

Chapter 15.,20.683655,0.83098793,2012,"IntroductionDuring the last two decades, proteomics ̶ i.e., the study of the set of proteins produced in a cell, tissue, organism, or biological entity ̶ made possible analyses and contextual comparisons of proteomes/proteins and biological functions among the most disparate entities, from viruses to the human being. In this way, proteomic scrutiny of tumor-associated proteins, autoantigens, and pathogen antigens offers the tools for fighting cancer, autoimmunity, and infections.Areas coveredComparative proteomics and immunoproteomics, the new scientific disciplines generated by proteomics, are main themes of the present review that describes how comparative analyses of pathogen and human proteomes led to re-modulate the molecular mimicry concept of the pre-proteomic era. In front of the immunological idea of a peptide epitope being an a priori selected amino acid sequence, immunoproteomics introduced the peptide epitope concept as mathematically defined by its frequency and physico-chemically characterized by hydrophobicity. I.e., before proteomics, molecular mimicry - the sharing of peptide sequences between two biological entities - was considered as intrinsically endowed with immunologic properties and was related to cross-reactivity. Proteomics allowed to redefine such an assumption using physico-chemical parameters according to which frequency and hydrophobicity preferentially confer an immunologic potential to shared peptide sequences.Expert opinionProteomics is outlining peptide platforms to be used for the diagnostics and management of human diseases. A Molecular Medicine targeted to obtain healing without paying the price of adverse events is on the horizon. The next step is to take up the challenge and operate the paradigm shift that the current proteomic era requires.","Kanduc, Darja",Expert review of proteomics,46,29

Assessments of viral protein and RNA levels in infected cells showed that both viruses were impaired in their ability to replicate in these cells. Some induction of IFN-λ1, CXCL10 and MxA mRNAs in both macrophages and MDDCs was seen in response to MERS-CoV infection, but almost no such induction was observed in response to SARS-CoV infection. ELISA and Western blot assays showed clear production of CXCL10 and MxA in MERS-CoV-infected macrophages and MDDCs. Our data suggest that SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV replicate poorly in human macrophages and MDDCs, but MERS-CoV is nonetheless capable of inducing a readily detectable host innate immune response. Our results highlight a clear difference between the viruses in activating host innate immune responses in macrophages and MDDCs, which may contribute to the pathogenesis of infection.","Tynell, Janne; Westenius, Veera; Rönkkö, Esa; Munster, Vincent J; Melén, Krister; Österlund, Pamela; Julkunen, Ilkka",The Journal of general virology,46,1

The long-term implications of this sign are unknown. We report angiographic outcomes of patients with the collar sign with follow-up of up to 45 months and the implications of this angiographic finding. MATERIALS AND METHODS We performed a retrospective review of a prospectively maintained data base of patients who underwent Pipeline Embolization Device implantation for an intracranial aneurysm at our institution between January 2014 and December 2016. We included patients with a collar sign at the initial follow-up angiogram after Pipeline Embolization Device implantation. RESULTS A total of 198 patients with 285 aneurysms were screened for the collar sign on initial and subsequent follow-up angiograms. There were 226 aneurysms (79.3%) with complete occlusion at the first follow-up. Of 59 incompletely occluded aneurysms, 19 (32.2%) aneurysms in 17 patients were found to have a collar sign on the first angiographic follow-up (median, 6 months; range, 4.2-7.2). Ten (52.6%) aneurysms underwent retreatment with a second Pipeline Embolization Device, which resulted in aneurysm occlusion in 1 (10%) patient. There were only 3 (15.8%) aneurysms with complete occlusion at the last follow-up, 2 (10.5%) of which had a single Pipeline Embolization Device implantation and another single (5.3%) aneurysm with a second Pipeline Embolization Device implantation. CONCLUSIONS A collar sign on the initial angiogram after Pipeline Embolization Device placement is a predictor of poor aneurysm occlusion. Because the occlusion rates remain equally low regardless of retreatment in patients with a collar sign, radiologic follow-up may be more appropriate than retreatment.","Gomez-Paz, S; Akamatsu, Y; Moore, J M; Ogilvy, C S; Thomas, A J; Griessenauer, C J",AJNR.

Human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2(ACE2) was identified as the entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2. As a carboxypeptidase, ACE2 cleaves many biological substrates besides angiotensin II to control vasodilatation and vascular permeability. Given the nanomolar high affinity between ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, we investigated how this interaction would affect the enzymatic activity of ACE2. Surprisingly, SARS-CoV-2 trimeric spike protein increased ACE2 proteolytic activity ∼3-10 fold against model peptide substrates, such as caspase-1 substrate and Bradykinin-analog. The enhancement in ACE2 enzymatic function was mediated by the binding of SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD domain. These results highlighted the potential for SARS-CoV-2 infection to enhance ACE2 activity, which may be relevant to the cardiovascular symptoms associated with COVID-19.","Lu, Jinghua; Sun, Peter D",The Journal of biological chemistry,46,25

Both the condition and treatment can lead to scarring and facial disfigurement, affecting a patient's health-related quality of life (HRQoL), which can be measured using patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs). OBJECTIVES This systematic review identifies PROMs for facial skin cancer and appraises their methodological quality and psychometric properties using up-to-date methods. METHODS MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, Cochrane and CINAHL were searched systematically in accordance with PRISMA guidelines, identifying all PROMs designed for or validated in facial skin cancer. Methodological quality and evidence of psychometric properties were assessed using the COnsensus-based Standards for the Selection of Health Measurement INstruments (COSMIN) checklist and criteria proposed by Terwee and colleagues. A best-evidence synthesis and assessment of instrument focus on post-resection reconstruction was also performed. RESULTS We included 24 studies on 11 PROMs. Methodological quality and psychometric evidence was variable, with the Patient Outcome of Surgery - Head/Neck (POS-H/N), Skin Cancer Index (SCI), Skin Cancer Quality of Life Impact Tool (SCQOLIT) and Essers and colleagues demonstrating the greatest level of validation. None scored well in their relevance to post-skin cancer reconstruction of the face. CONCLUSIONS This systematic review critically appraises PROMs for facial skin cancer using internationally accepted criteria. The identified PROMs demonstrate a variation in the quality of validation performed, with a need to improve this across all PROMs in the field. Only through improving the quality of available PROMs and their focus on the post-treatment aesthetic and functional outcome will we be able to truly appreciate the concerns of our patients and improve the management of facial skin cancer.","Dobbs, T D; Samarendra, H; Hughes, S; Hutchings, H A; Whitaker, I",The British journal of dermatology,46,13

However, it has traditionally been performed in a referral laboratory with a lengthy turnaround time, which can reduce patient flow through the hospital. We aimed to determine whether the introduction of a rapid PCR, but with limited targets (Cepheid Xpert Flu/RSV XC), was associated with improved outcomes for adults hospitalized with respiratory illness. A controlled quasi-experimental study was conducted across three hospitals in New South Wales, Australia. Intervention groups received standard multiplex PCR during the preimplementation, July to December 2016 (n = 953), and rapid PCR during the postimplementation, July to December 2017 (n = 1,209). Control groups (preimplementation, n = 937, and postimplementation, n = 1,102) were randomly selected from adults hospitalized with respiratory illness during the same periods. The outcomes were hospital length of stay (LOS) and microbiology test utilization (blood culture, urine culture, sputum culture, and respiratory bacterial and virus serologies). The introduction of rapid PCR was associated with a nonsignificant 8.9-h reduction in median LOS (95% confidence interval [CI], -21.5 h to 3.7 h; P = 0.17) for all patients and a significant 21.5-h reduction in median LOS (95% CI, -36.8 h to -6.2 h; P < 0.01) among patients with positive test results in an adjusted difference-in-differences analysis. For patients receiving test results before disposition, rapid PCR use was associated with a significant reduction in LOS, irrespective of test results. Compared with standard PCR testing, rapid PCR use was significantly associated with fewer blood culture (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 0.67; 95% CI, 0.5 to 0.82; P < 0.001), sputum culture (aOR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.47 to 0.68, P < 0.001), bacterial serology (aOR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.35 to 0.55, P < 0.001) and viral serology (aOR, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.33 to 0.53, P < 0.001) tests, but not with fewer urine culture tests (aOR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.78 to 1.12, P = 0.48).

Lipid rafts, cholesterol-enriched lipid-ordered membrane domains, are platforms for a variety of cellular functions. In this study, we found that disruption of lipid raft formation by cholesterol depletion with methyl-beta-cyclodextrin or cholesterol chelation with filipin III reduces JEV and DEN-2 infection, mainly at the intracellular replication steps and, to a lesser extent, at viral entry. Using a membrane flotation assay, we found that several flaviviral nonstructural proteins are associated with detergent-resistant membrane structures, indicating that the replication complex of JEV and DEN-2 localizes to the membranes that possess the lipid raft property. Interestingly, we also found that addition of cholesterol readily blocks flaviviral infection, a result that contrasts with previous reports of other viruses, such as Sindbis virus, whose infectivity is enhanced by cholesterol. Cholesterol mainly affected the early step of the flavivirus life cycle, because the presence of cholesterol during viral adsorption greatly blocked JEV and DEN-2 infectivity. Flavirial entry, probably at fusion and RNA uncoating steps, was hindered by cholesterol. Our results thus suggest a stringent requirement for membrane components, especially with respect to the amount of cholesterol, in various steps of the flavivirus life cycle.","Lee, Chyan-Jang; Lin, Hui-Ru; Liao, Ching-Len; Lin, Yi-Ling",Journal of virology,46,28

Here, we update population trends, the distribution of rural and urban hospitals, and surgeon supply to estimate surgeon demand for rural and urban hospital settings by 2040. METHODS Surgeon supply was based on new certifications for general surgery, orthopedic surgery, and obstetrics and gynecology adjusted for retirement. Surgeon demand from 2020 to 2040 was projected based on the US Census and published practice ratios: general surgery 10.7/100,000, orthopedic surgery 7.9/100,000, and obstetrics and gynecology 13.0/100,000. RESULTS The US population grew from 309 million in 2011 to 327 million in 2017 with rural populations unchanged at 56 million. By 2040, the US population will be 374 million (urban 85% and rural 15%) creating shortages of general surgery (-31.5%), orthopedic surgery (-34.3%), and obstetrics and gynecology (-25.3). Future hiring needs for urban hospitals will be 5 times greater than rural hospitals. Urban hospitals will likely recruit most newly certified surgeons. CONCLUSION Increases in surgery trainees will not meet the demand. The continued urbanization of American surgery may push rural hospitals into a vicious financial cycle leading to additional closures of rural hospitals and worsening issues of access. An alternative training paradigm for the rural surgeon is recommended to meet the unique demands of rural hospitals.","Ellison, E Christopher; Satiani, Bhagwan; Way, David P; Oslock, Wendelyn M; Santry, Heena; Williams, Thomas E",Surgery,46,15

A triad of hypotension, tachycardia, and facial flushing seems provoked by prostacyclin (PGI2) release from the gut in response to mesenteric traction. The administration of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) inhibits PGI2 release, stabilizing the hemodynamic response. Here, we examined the effect of mesenteric traction on splanchnic blood flow in pigs randomized to NSAID or placebo treatment. Materials and Methods Twenty pigs were allocated to either ketorolac or placebo treatment. Five minutes of manual mesenteric traction was applied. Plasma 6-keto-PGF1α, a stable metabolite of PGI2, hemodynamic variables, and regional blood flow (laser speckle contrast imaging) to the liver, stomach, small intestine, upper lip, and snout (laser Doppler flowmetry) were recorded prior to traction and 5 and 30 minutes thereafter. Results Both groups of pigs presented a decrease in systemic vascular resistance (P = .01), mean arterial blood pressure (P = .001), and blood flow in the gastric antrum (P = .002). Plasma 6-keto-PGF1α did not increase in either group (P = .195), and cardiac output, heart rate, central venous pressure, and blood flow to the liver, small intestine, upper lip, and snout remained unchanged. Conclusion Mesenteric traction resulted in cardiovascular depression, including reduced blood flow in the gastric antrum. Plasma 6-keto-PGF1α did not increase, and ketorolac administration did not alter the response to mesenteric traction. Furthers studies are needed to identify which substance is responsible for eliciting the cardiovascular response to mesenteric traction in pigs.","Strandby, Rune B; Osterkamp, Jens T F; Ambrus, Rikard; Henriksen, Amelie; Goetze, Jens P; Secher, Niels H; Achiam, Michael P; Svendsen, Lars-Bo",Animal models and experimental medicine,46,1

Faculty with 0-5-year-old children reported significantly fewer work hours (33.7 [13.9]) compared to all other groups (No children = 49.2 [14.9], 6-11 years old = 48.3 [13.9], and 12-17 years old = 49.5 [13.9], p < 0.0001). Women's self-reported first/corresponding author's and coauthor's article submissions decreased significantly between the two time periods; men's productivity metrics did not change. Faculty with 0-5-year-old children completed significantly fewer peer review assignments, attended fewer funding panel meetings, and submitted fewer first authors' articles during the pandemic compared to the previous period. Those with children aged 6 years or older at home or without children at home reported significant increases or stable productivity. Conclusions: Overall, significant disparities were observed in academic productivity by gender and child age during the pandemic and if confirmed by further research, should be considered by academic institutions and funding agencies when making decisions regarding funding and hiring as well as promotion and tenure.","Krukowski, Rebecca A; Jagsi, Reshma; Cardel, Michelle I",Journal of women's health,46,12

METHODS Students were emailed an electronic survey during their first semester and annually at the end of each academic year for a total of 3 years (2017-2020). Validated survey tools included the Jefferson Scale of Empathy (JSE) and the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) student version. The JSE survey consists of 20 questions, with higher scores denoting more empathy. The MBI student version contains 3 subscales: exhaustion (higher scores are worse), cynicism (higher scores are worse) and professional efficacy (higher scores are better). RESULTS The median JSE score at the end of the third academic year (PY3) was 110, with females scoring significantly higher (114.5 vs. 103.5; p<0.02). A majority of the 62 students reported burn out (82.3%), scoring in the highest category for either exhaustion (76%) or cynicism (55%). A majority (66%) also reported a low or moderate professional efficacy score, a negative finding. Measures of student burnout increased after the start of the program and remained at the higher level each subsequent year (p<0.0001). In the Spring of 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, nearly every student had moderate or high levels of emotional exhaustion (97%) and cynicism (78%) as measured by the MBI. CONCLUSION This interim data suggests high degrees of pharmacy student burnout. Empathy levels remained stable throughout the duration of the study. Pharmacy schools may need to focus on reform regarding well-being and prevention of burnout.","Jacoby, Jeanne L; Cole, Jaclyn D; Ruble, Melissa J; Smith, Amy B; Laubach, Lexis T; Greenberg, Marna Rayl; Macfarlan, Jennifer E; DeWaay, Deborah J; Barraco, Robert D; Shigo, Erin; Crowley, Lauren; Quinn, Joann Farrell",Journal of pharmacy practice,46,1

A variety of microbial species have been isolated from endodontic and periodontal infections. However, clinical endodontic and periodontics bacterial isolates have not been sufficiently characterized with regard to their capacity for antibiotic resistance. We aim to assess the existing evidence to estimate the prevalence of the main antimicrobial resistance and multidrug resistant organisms in endodontics and periodontics and to describe their geographic distribution in Latin America. METHODS All types of designs and will be restricted to Latin American studies will be included in this systematic review. MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, BVS (LILACS, BBO - bvsalud.org), IBECS (bases.bireme.br), Google Scholar, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Web of Science databases will be searched from 2013 to December 31, 2018 for all types of study designs that report microbial infection in endodontics and periodontics and their resistance and that define the microbiological methods used to identify microorganisms. The selection of articles for inclusion will be performed by 2 reviewers using predefined eligibility criteria. The Cochrane and ROBINS-I risk of bias assessment tools will be used to assess the methodological quality of randomized control trials. The Newcastle-Ottawa scale will be used to assess the quality of methodology in observational studies. The overall quality of evidence will be assessed using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) using the same principles and domains applied in the quality assessment of prognostic studies. The heterogeneity of the findings will be assessed using both the χ test and the I statistic. Sensitivity analysis will be performed by subgroup analyses and meta-regression to investigate the effect of study-level characteristics, such as age, gender, and methodological quality score, whenever possible. Publication bias across studies will be evaluated by visual inspection of the funnel plots and Begg's test for the results covered in 10 or more studies. RESULTS The evidence derived by this study will inform best practices for patients with endodontic and periodontal problems receiving antimicrobial agents. CONCLUSION Successful completion will significantly impact clinical practice and contribute to improved prescribing competency.

Our aim was to determine whether a loading dose of caffeine citrate given to ventilated, preterm infants affected the diaphragm electrical activity. METHODS Infants <34 weeks of gestational age were recruited if requiring mechanical ventilation and prescribed a loading dose of caffeine citrate. Surface electrodes recorded the electrical activity of the diaphragm (dEMG) before and after administration of intravenous caffeine citrate. The mean amplitude of the EMG (dEMG) trace and the mean area under the EMG curve (aEMGc) were calculated. RESULTS Thirty-two infants were assessed with a median gestational age of 29 (27-31) weeks. The dEMG amplitude increased, peaking at 25 min post administration (p = 0.006), and the increase in aEMGc (p = 0.004) peaked at 30 min; the differences were not significant after 60 min. At 20 min, there was an increase in minute volume (p = 0.034) and a reduction in the peak inspiratory pressure (p = 0.049).

A retrospective medical record review was used to describe short-term developmental outcomes of children with AHT and identify predictors of poorer outcomes. METHOD Children with AHT who received follow up by the hospital's rehabilitation department for 12 to 24 months post-injury were included in this review. Data for 85 children were collected on hearing, vision, gross motor, fine motor, speech and language, cognition, play, adaptive functioning, behaviour and personal-social skills. RESULTS Global assessment found 42% of children had a good recovery, 34% had a moderate disability and 24% had a severe disability. For whom there was data, more than half had abnormal cognition, behaviour and personal-social skills, whilst more than a third had abnormal speech and language, neurological signs on last assessment, vision, play skills, and gross and fine motor skills. Factors that predicted poorer prognosis across all developmental domains included paediatric intensive care unit admission, longer length of hospital stay, breathing difficulty and lower Glasgow Coma Scale on presentation. CONCLUSION This study highlights the substantial number of children who have abnormal development in the short-term post-AHT and assists in identifying those who require extensive long-term follow up.","Badger, Sarah; Waugh, Mary-Clare; Hancock, Jan; Marks, Susan; Oakley, Karen",Journal of pediatric rehabilitation medicine,46,28

The diagnosis of COVID-19 is well defined, but efficacious treatment is lacking. There is a big gap in knowledge regarding COVID-19 patients receiving convalescent plasma transfusion (CPT), especially those also suffering from diabetes mellitus (DM). In this study, among 3,059 COVID-19 patients admitted to Wuhan Huoshenshan Hospital of China, we documented the characteristics of 39 COVID-19 patients with DM receiving CPT, and compared their baseline information and clinical outcomes to COVID-19 patients with DM receiving conventional treatment. We also performed the propensity-matched comparison of COVID-19 patients with DM between conventional treatment and CPT. The CPT was efficacious and beneficial for COVID-19 patients with DM, including severe or critical ill patients, without obvious adverse effects. Our data demonstrated that CPT significantly improved the clinical outcomes of COVID-19 patients with DM, especially the cure rate and duration of hospitalization compared with that in COVID-19 patients with DM receiving conventional treatment. This study not only provided a deeper understanding of characteristics in COVID-19 patients with DM receiving CPT, but also highlighted the efficacious of CPT for COVID-19 patients with DM.

Herein, the susceptibility of human retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells to VZV infection and the ability of virus-specific CD4(+) T cells to control VZV infection in RPE cells in vitro is addressed. METHODS Human primary RPE cell cultures (n=2) were infected with a VZV strain expressing green fluorescent protein. The infection and viability of infected RPE cells was monitored by flow cytometry or by a fluorescent imager on RPE monolayers. RPE cells, pretreated with or without interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), were infected with VZV and subsequently cultured with VZV-specific CD4(+) T-cell clones (TCCs; n=3) recognizing disparate VZV proteins presented by different HLA class II alleles. IFN-gamma production and cytotoxicity of the TCCs in response to VZV-infected RPE cells was determined by flow cytometry. RESULTS Human RPE cells are permissive to a productive VZV infection. VZV-infected RPE cells presented the cognate antigen to the CD4(+) TCCs only if the RPE cells were pretreated with IFN-gamma and expressed the appropriate HLA class II allele. VZV-specific TCCs inhibited productive VZV infection in RPE cells, which was in part attributed to TCC-mediated killing of the VZV-infected RPE cells. CONCLUSIONS The results presented suggest that RPE cells may play a role as retina-resident antigen-presenting cells in the intraocular, VZV-specific, T cell-mediated inflammatory response of VZV-induced uveitis.","Milikan, Johannes C M; Baarsma, G Seerp; Kuijpers, Robert W A M; Osterhaus, Albert D M E; Verjans, Georges M G M",Investigative ophthalmology & visual science,46,31

This study investigated the effect of 2 different environmental temperatures on intestinal damage when exercising at the same relative intensity. Twelve men (mean ± SD; body mass, 81.98 ± 7.95 kg; height, 182.6 ± 7.4 cm) completed randomised cycling trials (45 min, 70% maximal oxygen uptake) in 30 °C/40% relative humidity (RH) and 20 °C/40%RH. A subset of participants (n = 5) also completed a seated passive trial (30 °C/40%RH). Rectal temperature and thermal sensation (TSS) were recorded during each trial and venous blood samples collected at pre- and post-trial for the analysis of intestinal fatty acid-binding protein (I-FABP) level as a marker of intestinal damage. Oxygen uptake was similar between 30 °C and 20 °C exercise trials, as intended (p = 0.94). I-FABP increased after exercise at 30 °C (pre-exercise: 585 ± 188 pg·mL-1; postexercise: 954 ± 411 pg·mL-1) and 20 °C (pre-exercise: 571 ± 175 pg·mL-1; postexercise: 852 ± 317 pg·mL-1) (p < 0.0001) but the magnitude of damage was similar between temperatures (p = 0.58). There was no significant increase in I-FABP concentration following passive heat exposure (p = 0.59). Rectal temperature increased during exercise trials (p < 0.001), but not the passive trial (p = 0.084). TSS increased more when exercising in 30 °C compared with 20 °C (p < 0.001). There was an increase in TSS during the passive heat trial (p = 0.03). Intestinal damage, as measured by I-FABP, following exercise in the heat was similar to when exercising in a cooler environment at the same relative intensity. Passive heat exposure did not increase I-FABP. It is suggested that when exercising in conditions of compensable heat stress, the increase in intestinal damage is predominantly attributable to the exercise component, rather than environmental conditions.","Sheahen, Brodie L; Fell, James W; Zadow, Emma K; Hartley, Thomas F; Kitic, Cecilia M","Applied physiology, nutrition, and metabolism = Physiologie appliquee, nutrition et metabolisme",46,23

A novel laparoscopic approach was used to close the diaphragmatic defect in four patients diagnosed with large, paraesophageal hernias and gastroesophageal reflux disease symptomatology. METHODS All procedures were performed via laparoscopy. Three patients underwent a reduction of the paraesophageal hernia with a Nissen fundoplication and one with Collis-Nissen fundoplication. Standard crural closure was performed over a #60 Fr Bougie in two patients, and two patients did not undergo a cruroplasty. In all four patients, the left hepatic lobe was freed, repositioned, and anchored under and inferior to the gastroesophageal junction, propping the gastroesophageal junction anteriorly. This maneuver entirely covers and closes the diaphragmatic defect. RESULTS Postoperatively, all patients did well without notable, unusual complaints. Average length of stay was 2 days. Although not statistically significant, all patients had no recurrence of symptoms or of their paraesophageal hernia at 8, 9, 11, and 15 months after the procedure. CONCLUSIONS In selected patients, large paraesophageal hernias can safely be managed via a laparoscopic antireflux procedure with the hepatic shoulder technique. Although no long-term follow-up is available, this technique has shown good early postoperative results and may be used as an alternative to a laparoscopic Mesh reinforced fundoplication or difficult crural closure.","Quilici, Philippe J; McVay, Carie; Tovar, Alexander",Surgical endoscopy,46,16

Therefore, knowledge on the involved molecular processes downstream of OXT receptor (OXTR) activation is indispensable. We reveal that alternative splicing of corticotropin releasing factor receptor 2α (CRFR2α) parallels increased anxiety-like behavior following chronic OXT treatment, contrasting the well-known anxiolysis of acute OXT. In detail, chronic OXT shifts the splicing ratio between membrane-bound (mCRFR2α) and soluble CRFR2α (sCRFR2α) in favor of the latter via ERK1/2-MEF2A signaling. Targeted manipulations of Crfr2α splicing mimic the effect of chronic OXT, confirming its role in the regulation of anxiety-like behavior. Furthermore, chronic OXT triggers cytoplasmic distribution and extracellular release of sCRFR2α into the cerebrospinal fluid, with sCRFR2α levels positively correlating with anxiety-like behavior. Concluding, the dichotomy between anxiolytic mCRFR2α and anxiogenic sCRFR2α is the basis for the deleterious effects of chronic OXT on anxiety.

A non-contact medical detection robot is a type of diagnostic equipment and medical service robot with a wide application prospect. However, few non-contact medical detection robots have been designed to collect patients' physiological parameters when they are in inconvenient situations, such as bedridden, during clinical usage. A six-degree-of-freedom (six-DOF) face tracking method based on a six-DOF robot is proposed in this paper. In the proposed system, a face detector equipped with a camera attached to the robot's wrist is used to obtain the real-time face depth and attitude information. The optimal target attitude of the camera is calculated according to the constraints in the base coordinate system. A closed-loop controller is designed to control the robot to reach the target position and posture smoothly. The experiment with a six-DOF robot has verified that the proposed system can achieve the real-time tracking of human faces by a camera. The proposed method can also be used in many other scenarios where six-DOF face tracking is required by robots. © 2021 IEEE.","Zhang, H.; Fan, B.; Zhang, X.; Zhan, H.; Li, X.","18th IEEE International Conference on Mechatronics and Automation, ICMA 2021",46,13

Participants consisted of students studying and doing sports at the University. 446 students, 246 males and 200 females, participated in the study. Besides the personal form, students were filled the questionnaire testing questionnaire. Students voluntarily participated. The surveys were done on social media. Nutritional habits questionnaire consists of 12 questions. In the preparation of the survey questions, the questions proved validity of the researches which have been done on the subject before have been used. SPSS 23.00 package program was used in statistical analyses. Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was performed to test whether the data was normally distributed and it was determined that the data showed normal distribution. Independent t-test, paired t-test, unidirectional variance analysis and LSD tests were used in statistical operations. There was no significant difference in students' nutrition approaches by gender, both in the pre-outbreak period and in the outbreak period points (p> 0.05). Nutrition scores were significantly increased during the outbreak period (p <0.001). A significant difference was found between the students who felt bad before the epidemic and those who felt well before the epidemic and their nutritional scores according to the levels they felt (p <0.05). A significant difference was found between the pre-outbreak period and post-epidemic nutrition scores of the sports faculty students (p <0.05). During the coronavirus epidemic, university student athletes have either increased their nutritional opportunities or have changed their eating habits positively to keep their immune systems strong or both. The fact that sports faculty students have better nutrition compared to other faculty students can be attributed to their taking courses in nutrition, health and similar. It is recommended to give lectures or seminars on nutrition to athlete students.","Altun, S.; Aksu, A.; Imamoglu, O.; Erdogdu, M.; Karacabey, K.",Pakistan Journal of Medical & Health Sciences,46,11

In one study, WHO grade 2 or higher bleeding occurred in >80% of pediatric subjects receiving hematopoietic stem cell transplantation or chemotherapy despite a platelet transfusion threshold of 10,000/µl. The risk of bleeding is not decreased with higher transfusion thresholds or increased platelet doses. Bleeding episodes are associated with increased mortality rates, greater utilization of resources and increased transfusion requirements. We examined the use of anti-fibrinolytic agents in decreasing bleeding events and platelet transfusions. Methods: We conducted a randomized double-blinded Phase 2 trial of tranexamic acid versus placebo in inpatient pediatric patients undergoing chemotherapy or HSCT expected to have prolonged thrombocytopenia. All patients admitted to the Oncology or HSCT services were screened for eligibility. Patients consenting for enrollment received either tranexamic acid 10m/kg/dose or normal saline every 8 hours while the platelet count as <30,000/ul until discharge or spontaneous platelet recovery (maximum 30 days). We conducted daily hemostatic assessments using the WHO bleeding scale and monitored adverse events and platelet transfusion requirements. Follow-up assessments took place at 7 and 30 days following completion of study medication. Primary aims were to assess safety and feasibility of tranexamic acid in children with hypoproliferative thrombocytopenia. Results: We screened 697 admissions over 11 months, 31 patients were eligible for enrollment. Enrollment was suspended in March 2020 for COVID reasons though screening continued through July 2020. An additional 10 eligible patients were identified in this period. The most common reasons for ineligibility included recent asparaginase administration, predicted inpatient stay <5 days and age ≤ 2 or ≥ 18 years. Eleven patients enrolled and completed all study procedures. There were no missed doses of medication, 88.4% of doses were administered within one hour of prescribed time. Patients remained on study for a mean of 11.1 days. Five patients each met criteria for spontaneous platelet count recovery or discharge, 1 patient received the study medication for 30 days. Bleeding (all grades) occurred on 29.5% of days. Grade 2 or higher bleeding occurred on 4.9% of days and was experienced by 27.3% of patients. The most common sites of bleeding were oral/nasal and cutaneous. Subjects received a median of 2 platelet transfusions per patient. There were no thromboembolic events or serious adverse events. Conclusion: Tranexamic acid is well tolerated can be safely administered to pediatric oncology patients as an adjunct to therapy. We are planning a multi-center randomized controlled trial to assess the efficacy of tranexamic acid in reducing bleeding complications in this population.

The unified theory of the Mass-Action Law Pharmacodynamics and Bioinformatics [MAL-PD/BI] and its combination index (CI) theory provide general principle for drug evaluation in vitro, in animals and in clinical trials. Thus, all single drugs and their combinations can be compared/ranked under the same MAL-PD principle and the same protocol design-conditions for the unified ranking assessments. Using the MAL-PD/BI/CI and its computer software, anti-HIV combination clinical trials for AZT + 3TC (Mildvan D. et al, Antivir. Ther. 1: 77-88, 1996) was successfully carried out for synergism quantification/simulation (CI<1) using only 36 patients with three-doses each and 10 dose data points. Similar studies in this lab (Synergy 3:15-30, 2016) showed two anti-cancer agents against colon carcinoma HCT-116 xenograft tumors in nude mice, synergy quantification using only 70 mice. Furthermore, anti-HIV drug in vitro for 2 to 5-drug combinations, synergism determination using MAL-PD/CI, have appeared in Chou TC, Pharmacol. Rev. 58: 621-681, 2006. As of Jan. 2, 2021, this article has 3,813 citations in 1,030 biomedical journals. From MAL/median-effect Eq. plot (MEP) with x= log (Dose) vs y= log [(fa)/(1-fa)], where fa is the fraction affected, linearized all dose-effect curves (DEC) with slope =m, and x-intercept = anti-log Dm. Therefore, any two-dose date points on MEP, allow the generation of entire DEC by simulation, where the 3rd point is dose-zero, and the 4th point is the universal Dm point. This is the Minimum Two-Data Point Theory (MTDPT), is the basis for Econo-Green Biomedical R&D and Regulatory Guidance, especially for in vivo studies. Thus, 2 becomes 4, 3 becomes 5, and 4 becomes 6 dose-data points, using small number of dose-data points in clinical protocol design which save time, efforts, resources, and reduced the number of patients for computerized diagnostic plots. To unify the Design and Analysis, now, the same MAL-PD/CI is designed for clinical trial protocol against Covid-19, using Remdesivir, Favipiravir, Dexamethasone, in single drug, two and tree drug combinations (A, B, C, A+B, B+C, A+C and A+B+C, 7 sets). These are with the shared constant combo dose-ratios for 2- and 3-drug combos, and the three doses of each of 7 sets, at the dose range of about 1.5-ED50, 1-ED50 and 0.75-ED50, each with >5 patients, using CompuSyn for instant synergy simulations. The benefit for the MAL-PD/CI is that all single drug and their combinations efficacy/synergy in vitro and in vivo (Covid genetic, antigen or neutralization assays or surrogate markers) are compared/ranked under the same MAL-PD principle and the same protocol design-conditions for the unified ranking assessments. The evaluations of other candidate compounds/agents can be designed and analyzed in the same way, just by adjusting the dose-ranges and the combination-ratios.","Chou, T. C.",Cancer Research,46,4

Frontline health care workers (HCWs) are at an increased risk of the acquisition of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 infection (SARS CoV-2) due to their close interaction with infected patients (1, 2). Also, HCWs can serve as reservoirs of SARS CoV-2 cross-transmission both in community and hospital settings (1). However, the extent of COVID-19 infection among HCWs in Sri Lanka is understudied. Objectives: This study determined the incidence, demographic characteristics, and risk exposure behavior of HCWs who tested positive for SARS CoV-2 at Base Hospital Wathupitiwala. Furthermore, the rate of acquisition of SARS CoV-2 following COVISHIELD/ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and Sinopharm /BBIBP-CorV vaccines in HCWs were studied. Methods: A retrospective cross-sectional descriptive analysis was conducted from May 2021 to August 2021 for a total of 818 HCWs. Results: Hundred and twenty-four HCWs (15.16%) were tested positive for COVID-19. The mean age of infected HCWs was 46.27 years and the majority were females (74.19%). Among all infected persons, 54 (43.55%) were nurses/midwives, 39 (31.45%) were clinical supportive staff and 12(9.68%) were medical officers. The number of infected HCWs rapidly escalated and a total of 64(51.61%) HCWs got an infection during August/2021. No source was identified in most of them (34.68%) followed by community acquisition (33.87%). Thirty-five HCWs (28.23%) had acquired infection during a hospital setting or had a high-risk exposure in recent history. Among hospital-related infections, 37.91% of HCWs had shared meals or shared sleeping rooms with an infected workmate. The majority of the HCWs were tested by the infection control unit as symptomatic screening (70.16%) followed by contact tracing (20.16%). Fifty-six (45.16%) HCWs had a history of single or multiple comorbidities. The vast majority of HCWs (95.97%) presented as mild to asymptomatic disease that followed an uneventful recovery. Body aches, headache, fever, and sore throat were the most commonly reported symptoms among them. Among the five HCWs required therapeutic oxygen supplementation, two unvaccinated HCWs succumbed to the infection. The rate of breakthrough infection among HCWs was 8.93%. The acquisition of disease was significantly higher among unvaccinated HCWs than partially (p<0.0001) or fully vaccinated (p<0.0001) HCWs with either type of vaccine. Conclusions: Protecting HCWs remains a challenge in resource-poor settings. The risk of infection fueled by very contagious circulating variants is continuously high even though vaccination has shown clear benefits in preventing mortality and severe infection. Therefore, all healthcare workers should be vaccinated while ensuring continuous infection control measures in the hospital setting.","Samaranayake, W. A. M. P.; Jayawardhana, G. P. C.; Roshan, A. L.

The personnel obligatory and rapidly switched to unknown work conditions and faced new stressors: COVID-19 fears, unstable internet connections, tensed communications, permanent noise, work hours extension. In order to cope with increased daily stress, the new version of self-regulation training program (Leonova, Kuznetsova, 2019) was implemented in distant format in order to train people: to evaluate the impact of distant work stressors;to measure stress manifestations during work hours;to choose self-regulation skills, effective for distant stress reduction.ObjectivesIn order to verify the distant training program, the empirical study was conducted, targeted to estimate effectiveness of self-regulation means during COVID-19 pandemic period.MethodsThe program included progressive relaxation exercises as means for anxiety reduction and negative emotions control, and autogenic exercises for achievement an optimal for different work situations mental state. The empirical data were obtained by diagnostic methods for self-assessment of the main distant stress manifestations: anxiety and high fatigue (Spielberger, 1994, Leonova, 2012).ResultsThe program verification was conducted in employees of municipal administration offices (n = 214). The empirical data revealed high effectiveness of relaxation and autogenic means in decrease of anxiety (t=8,64;p<0,001) and fatigue (t=9,18;p<0,001).ConclusionsThe first variant of distant program could be recommended for stress-management under pandemic lockdown. At the same time, advanced evaluating procedures are necessary to measure the coping effect of such programs, and to prove stress-reduction capacities of specialized distant training modules.","Kuznetsova, A.",European Psychiatry,46,1

We compared the effectiveness of Covishield and Covaxin vaccines against moderate to severe COVID-19. Methods: In this retrospective observational study, we collected data of patients who were admitted with moderate to severe COVID-19. The vaccination status and comorbidities of the patients were documented. The incidence and in-hospital mortality of COVID-19 patients was assessed. Univariate analysis was performed to determine the risk factors of in-hospital mortality. Results: Of 294 patients, 5.1% (n=15) received Covaxin and 26.5% (n=78) received Covishield; 68.4% (n=201) patients were unvaccinated. Of patients who were vaccinated and contracted COVID-19, 24.8% (n=73) had taken the first dose and 6.8% (n=20) had taken the second dose of either vaccine. The in-hospital mortality rate was 13.6% (n=40). No significant association was found with the type of vaccine and the in-hospital mortality (p=0.23).

Indeed, every security company now claims to embrace Zero Trust. Many do so without stating which of their products or services contribute to a Zero Trust framework. This hype has raised awareness of the security issues associated with remote working, which obviously is a very positive acknowledgement that current security frameworks need to be improved to embrace the fast-growing use of technologies such as video conferencing, screen sharing and even Cloud identity management systems. Behind the scenes there has been significant developments: In February 2020 Weever and Andreou [3] published Zero Trust Network Security Model in containerized environments and examined containerised communications and Zero Trust implementations in depth, and how in software defined networks micro segmentation protects is managed by a network policy engine that can use a security sidecar module to shut down a network segment in the event of an attack being identified. In February and March 2020 two draft articles were published Implementing a Zero Trust Architecture and a NIST draft of a Zero Trust framework with a Policy Engine making policy decisions based on monitoring and threat intelligence. These draft documents show how NIST is distilling the theory into a standard architecture for Zero Trust implementations. This is a milestone in the Zero Trust story as this will lead to a common approach that will allow corporations to be able to align their strategies with a recognised Zero Trust framework. In April Malhotra [9] made the argument how the USA should take the Lead in Data Protection by using Zero Trust Architectures and Penetration Testing. This is an interesting argument as with a blurred network perimeter, the penetration tester no longer has a single point of entry to the network to test an organisation and a Penetration Testers job nowadays is more to do with testing an organisations resilience to phishing emails and social engineering than trying to exploit communication port vulnerabilities that might exist on external IP addresses at perimeter firewalls. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Haddon, D.; Bennett, P.",Advanced Sciences and Technologies for Security Applications,46,16

Given high population heterogeneity in 25(OH)D3 plasma concentration profiles, vitamin D3 dose regimen needs to be personalised. The objective of this study is to establish a model that accurately predicts 25(OH)D3 pharmacokinetics (PK) on an individual level to enable selection of an appropriate dose regimen for anyone. Methods: Plasma or serum concentrations of Vitamin D3 and 25(OH)D3 from different trials were compiled together. We then developed a series of Physiologically-Based Pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models for vitamin D3 and 25(OH)D3 in a stepwise manner to select the best model to optimally recapitulate the 10g and 100g daily dose data. Each arm of the clinical trials was simulated individually. Model predictions were qualified with PK data at other doses. Results: From data exploration, we observed an interesting phenomenon: the increase in plasma 25(OH)D3 after repeat dosing was negatively correlated with 25(OH)D3 baseline levels. Our final model assumes a first-order vitamin D3 absorption, linear vitamin D3 elimination and a non-linear 25(OH)D3 elimination which is described with an Emax function. This model offers a simple explanation to the apparent paradox: the negative correlation might arise from the non-linear 25(OH)D3 elimination process. The model was also able to accurately predict plasma 25(OH)D3 after repeat dosing at daily doses other than 10g and 100g, which was reassuring. Conclusions: We developed a PBPK model to recapitulate PK of plasma vitamin D3 and 25(OH)D3. A personalised vitamin D3 supplementation protocol requires measurement of 25(OH)D3 baseline levels. This should be tested in the clinics for each individual.","Huang, Z.; You, T.",,46,7

To identify the targeting signals that mediate this recycling, N- glycosylated and myc-tagged variants of ERGIC-53 were constructed. By monitoring endoglycosidase H resistance, we measured the loss from the ER-ERGIC-cis-Golgi cycle of ERGIC-53. A domain exchange approach with the plasma membrane reporter protein CD4 showed that the transmembrane and the lumenal domains are not sufficient, while the cytoplasmic domain of ERGIC-53 is required and sufficient for pre-medial-Golgi localization. However, the ERGIC-53 cytoplasmic domain on CD4 lead to increased ER-staining by immunofluorescence microscopy indicating that this domain alone cannot provide for unbiased recycling through the ER- ERGIC-cis-Golgi compartments. Complete progress through the ER-ERGIC- cis-Golgi recycling pathway requires the cytoplasmic domain acting together with the lumenal domain of ERGIC-53. Dissection of the cytoplasmic domain revealed a COOH-terminal di-lysine ER-retrieval signal, KKFF, and an RSQQE targeting determinant adjacent to the transmembrane domain.

Predictive modeling has been an important tool for projecting utilization rates and surge planning. As the initial outbreak begins to slow, questions are being raised regarding long-term coronavirus mitigation plans. This paper examines the current status of the coronavirus outbreak in Milwaukee County, Wisconsin, and simulates several scenarios where physical distancing measures are removed. METHODS The outbreak's doubling time, reproductive numbers at several points, and incidence curve were calculated to assess outbreak progression. Compartmental models were used to estimate the number of hospitalizations and critically ill patients in Milwaukee County if distancing policies were removed. RESULTS The compartmental models predict a substantial spike in cases and overwhelming medical resource utilization with an abrupt end to social distancing. Partial reduction in social distancing policies would likely result in a smaller spike, with less severe strain on available medical resources. CONCLUSIONS Milwaukee County remains very susceptible to a resurgence of COVID-19 cases. Removing physical distancing policies poses significant risks with regard to resource management.","Bemanian, Amin; Ahn, Kwang Woo; O'Brien, Mallory; Rausch, Darren J; Weston, Benjamin; Beyer, Kirsten M M",WMJ : official publication of the State Medical Society of Wisconsin,46,19

Guidelines for the timing and spatial extent of control measures for pathogen invasions are currently limited, however. We conducted a field experiment using wheat (Triticum aestivum) stripe rust, caused by the wind-dispersed fungus Puccinia striiformis, to study the extent to which host heterogeneity in an initial outbreak focus influences subsequent disease spread. We varied the frequency of susceptible host plants in an initial outbreak focus and in the non-focus of experimental plots, and observed the progress of epidemics produced by artificial inoculation. The frequency of susceptible hosts in the initial outbreak focus increased the spread of stripe rust in the experimental plots, while frequency of susceptible hosts outside the initial outbreak focus did not. This suggests that factors influencing pathogen reproduction in the initial outbreak focus are key to the control of epidemics of stripe rust. Two mechanisms may underlie the field results. The first is the continuing, direct infection of susceptible hosts in areas outside the initial outbreak focus by disease propagules arriving from the initial outbreak focus. The second is highly local proliferation of disease caused by direct descendants of colonizing individuals originating from the initial outbreak focus. We considered these two alternatives in simulations of a generalized pathogen exhibiting fat-tailed dispersal, similar to P. striiformis. Simulations showed a dominant effect of conditions in the initial outbreak focus, in agreement with the field experiment, but indicated that, over time, this dominance may erode. Analysis of the duration of focal dominance led to the conclusion that both mechanisms contribute to the phenomenon of focal dominance, and that the frequency of susceptible hosts in the initial outbreak focus had a stronger influence when the proportion of propagules that remained local during dispersal was higher. Overall, our results suggest that targeting pathogen reproduction in the initial outbreak focus will have a disproportionately large impact on subsequent epidemic spread.","Estep, Laura K; Sackett, Kathryn E; Mundt, Christopher C",Ecological applications : a publication of the Ecological Society of America,46,8

Of the 15 nurses who were included as study subjects on a night shift, eight took two short naps (the Nap condition), and seven worked without taking a nap (the No-nap condition) during the night shift. We measured sublingual temperature and the bispectral index (BIS), obtained heart rate and heart rate variability measures from an electrocardiogram (ECG), and evaluated sleepiness and fatigue levels every hour using the Visual Analog Scale (VAS). Both subjective sleepiness and fatigue increased between 4:00 and 5:00, with no significant differences observed between the two groups. However, the low- to high-frequency ratio (LF/HF) in the Nap condition group was found to be significantly lower than in the No-nap condition group. Furthermore, a sudden, brief increase in HF values was observed in the No-nap condition group in the morning. The results of this study suggest that taking two short naps may effectively reduce tension and prevent a brief increase in HF values by suppressing sympathetic nervous activity in the morning.","Oriyama, Sanae; Miyakoshi, Yukiko; Kobayashi, Toshio",Industrial health,46,1

To date, the in vivo role of PEPC in carbon and nitrogen metabolism has not been analyzed in plants. In this study, we examined the role of PEPC in plants, demonstrating that PPC1 and PPC2 were highly expressed genes encoding PEPC in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) leaves and that PPC1 and PPC2 accounted for approximately 93% of total PEPC activity in the leaves. A double mutant, ppc1/ppc2, was constructed that exhibited a severe growth-arrest phenotype. The ppc1/ppc2 mutant accumulated more starch and sucrose than wild-type plants when seedlings were grown under normal conditions. Physiological and metabolic analysis revealed that decreased PEPC activity in the ppc1/ppc2 mutant greatly reduced the synthesis of malate and citrate and severely suppressed ammonium assimilation. Furthermore, nitrate levels in the ppc1/ppc2 mutant were significantly lower than those in wild-type plants due to the suppression of ammonium assimilation. Interestingly, starch and sucrose accumulation could be prevented and nitrate levels could be maintained by supplying the ppc1/ppc2 mutant with exogenous malate and glutamate, suggesting that low nitrogen status resulted in the alteration of carbon metabolism and prompted the accumulation of starch and sucrose in the ppc1/ppc2 mutant. Our results demonstrate that PEPC in leaves plays a crucial role in modulating the balance of carbon and nitrogen metabolism in Arabidopsis.","Shi, Jianghua; Yi, Keke; Liu, Yu; Xie, Li; Zhou, Zhongjing; Chen, Yue; Hu, Zhanghua; Zheng, Tao; Liu, Renhu; Chen, Yunlong; Chen, Jinqing",Plant physiology,46,33

Some cellular antigens are associated with EEV and these vary with the cell type used to grow the virus. To investigate if specific cell antigens are associated with VV particles, and to address the origin of membranes used to envelope IMV and IEV/CEV/EEV, we have studied whether cell antigens and foreign antigens expressed by recombinant VVs are incorporated into VV particles. Membrane proteins that are incorporated into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), intermediate compartment (IC), cis/medial-Golgi, trans-Golgi network (TGN) or plasma membrane were not detected in purified IMV particles. In contrast, proteins present in the TGN or membrane compartments further downstream in the exocytic pathway co-purify with EEV particles when analysed by immunoblotting. Immunoelectron microscopy found only low levels of these proteins in IEV, CEV/EEV. The incorporation of foreign antigens into VV particles was not affected by loss of individual IEV or EEV-specific proteins or by redirection of B5R to the ER. These data suggest that (i) host cell antigens are excluded from the lipid envelope surrounding the IMV particle and (ii) membranes of the ER, IC and cis/medial-Golgi are not used to wrap IMV particles to form IEV. Lastly, the VV haemagglutinin was absent from one-third of IEV and CEV/EEV particles, whereas other EEV antigens were present in all these virions.","Krauss, Oliver; Hollinshead, Ruth; Hollinshead, Michael; Smith, Geoffrey L",The Journal of general virology,46,19

Experiences within the United States have varied widely. In the State of Oregon in the early months of the pandemic protective protocols (e.g., social distancing) were comparatively high, resulting in concern for increases in loneliness and COVID-related stress. The present study of college students examined the indirect relationship of loneliness and other stressors to alcohol use, via drinking-to-cope motives. METHOD A sample of traditional- and nontraditional-aged college students (N = 215; 68.1% female; mean age = 24.8 years) completed an online survey assessing COVID-19 experiences during shelter-in-place orders in Oregon over a 5-week period in April and May of 2020. RESULTS Cross-sectional structural equational modeling revealed that loneliness and COVID-19 news consumption were associated with stronger coping motives, whereas rated seriousness of COVID-19 was related to weaker coping motives. Coping motives, in turn, were related to more frequent past-30-day consumption; significant indirect effects were revealed for all three predictors on drinking frequency and heavy drinking frequency, via drinking-to-cope motives. Drinking-to-cope motives were also related to greater past-30-day marijuana use. CONCLUSIONS These findings provide insight into how COVID-related stressors and associated social relationship repercussions relate to alcohol and marijuana use and drinking-to-cope motivations while sheltering in place. These results have implications for how frequent substance use and coping-motivated use can be mitigated during a crisis.","Mohr, Cynthia D; Umemoto, Sheila K; Rounds, Thomas W; Bouleh, Philip; Arpin, Sarah N",Journal of studies on alcohol and drugs,46,1

Indirect hemagglutination (IHA) antigen titers in 229E-infected cell cultures paralleled virus infectivity and complement fixation (CF) antigen titers. The identity of the IHA antigen was confirmed by testing extracts from inoculated and control cell cultures for ability to inhibit IHA. Also, significant increases in IHA antibody were demonstrated with acute and convalescent serum pairs from patients with proven 229E infections. A comparison of IHA, neutralization and CF titers for 229E antibodies was made on human sera drawn from different populations. The IHA and neutralization results were in agreement on 93% of the 129 sera found to be positive by at least one of three tests. The number of antibody titers detected by the CF test was insufficient to permit comparison. Hyperimmune sera from animals immunized with OC 43 did not react with 229E by IHA.

In the field of infection prevention and control (IPAC), despite great attempts over several decades to improve compliance with hand hygiene, surveillance, environmental cleaning, isolation protocols and other control measures, very significant challenges remain. We believe this failure is in part due to the power gradients, often dysfunctional relationships and lack of safety mindfulness that exist in hospitals and healthcare more generally. Furthermore, safety culture requires different approaches and considerable ongoing attentiveness. If this is the case, and the authors contend in this paper that it is, then the role of the front line is much more important than many of our healthcare safety and IPAC approaches suggest.","Zimmerman, Brenda; Reason, Paige; Rykert, Liz; Gitterman, Leah; Christian, Jennifer; Gardam, Michael",HealthcarePapers,46,4

The dynamics of generalist pathogens in multispecies host communities remain a major frontier for disease ecology. Of particular interest are how host community structure controls pathogen transmission and how disease spread feeds back to influence the host community. Pathogen spillover occurs when epidemics in a host population are driven not by transmission within that population but by transmission from a reservoir population. Here we review examples of spillover in pathogens infecting humans, domesticated animals, and crops, noting that most empirical evidence for spillover results from nonmanipulative, observational studies. We then present results from two field experiments utilizing an experimentally tractable model system of annual wild grasses and a generalist virus, the barley yellow dwarf virus. In these experiments, the presence of a highly susceptible reservoir species, Avena fatua (wild oats), greatly increased pathogen prevalence in several other species. This result demonstrates pathogen spillover and illustrates the crucial role of host community structure in controlling the dynamics of generalist pathogens. Further, pathogen spillover from A. fatua decreased the abundance of two other host species through pathogen-mediated apparent competition. Thus, our results provide experimental support for theoretical predictions of strong feedbacks between host community structure and generalist disease dynamics.","Power, Alison G; Mitchell, Charles E",The American naturalist,46,1

Pakistan and Afghanistan are the only countries, which are still struggling to eradicate wild poliovirus. All vaccination campaigns in Pakistan were suspended in April due to the COVID-19 outbreak, leading 40 million children to miss out on polio vaccination. Like the climate crisis, the COVID-19 pandemic could be regarded as a child-rights crisis because it could have life-threatening impact over children, who need immunization, now and in the long-term. Delays in polio vaccination programs might not have immediate impact but, in the long-term, the increase in polio cases in Pakistan could result in the global export of infections. Therefore, healthcare authorities must intensify their efforts to track and vaccinate unvaccinated children in countries like Pakistan and Afghanistan. Polio vaccination campaigns need to resume immediately, so we suggest applying social distancing measures along with standard operating procedure to flatten the transmission curve of COVID-19. Furthermore, the concurrent emergence of cVDPV2 means that tOPV should temporarily be used for primary immunization.

We sought to study the impact of COVID-19 on lung cancer patients in our center. METHODS: We initiated a retrospectively study to analyze the impact of COVID-19 on lung cancer patients in our center, who were accepted for routine anticancer treatment before the epidemic and planned to return to hospital in January and February of 2020. RESULTS: A total of 161 cases of lung cancer were included in the final analysis. As of April 15, 95 patients had delayed their return visit, and 47 cases were finally designated as having delayed admission during the epidemic and having to discontinue or delay their regular anticancer treatments. Of these 47 delayed patients, 33 were evaluated for tumor status using a computed tomography scan, 6 of these 33 cases (18.18%) were diagnosed as progressive disease (PD), and 5 cases did not return for visit. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study investigating impact of COVID-19 on non-COVID-19 lung cancer patients during the pandemic. The study demonstrates the significant impact of the COVID-19 crisis on oncological care, indicating the need for appropriate change of treatment decisions and continued follow-up and psycho-oncological support during this pandemic.","Sha, Zhou; Chang, Kejie; Mi, Jiaoping; Liang, Zibin; Hu, Liyang; Long, Fengjiao; Shi, Haiyan; Lin, Zhong; Wang, Xiaojin; Pei, Xiaofeng",Ann Palliat Med,46,21

However, data on influenza vaccination in patients with congenital heart disease (CHD) is scarce. In this study, our goals were to (i) measure vaccination coverage rates (VCR) for influenza in a large cohort of children, adolescents and adults with CHD, (ii) identity patient characteristics as predictors for vaccination, and (iii) investigate the impact of influenza vaccination on hospitalization. METHODS: A nationwide cohort study in Belgium included 16,778 patients, representing 134,782 vaccination years, from the BELgian COngenital heart disease Database combining Administrative and Clinical data (BELCODAC). Data over 9 vaccination years (2006-2015) were used, and patients were stratified into five age cohorts: 6 months-4 years; 5-17 years; 18-49 years; 50-64 years; and &#8805;65 years. RESULTS: In the respective age cohorts, the VCR was estimated to be 6.6%, 8.0%, 23.9%, 46.6%, and 72.8%. There was a steep increase in VCR as of the age of 40 years. Multivariable logistic regression showed that higher anatomical complexity of CHD, older age, presence of genetic syndromes, and prior cardiac interventions were associated with significantly higher VCRs. Among adults, men had lower and pregnant women had higher VCRs. The association between influenza vaccination and all-cause hospitalization was not significant in this study.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health among healthcare workers (HCWs) in primary ear-nose-throat (ENT) practices. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional questionnaire study among HCWs assessing symptoms of anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder, ten-item scale) and depression (Patients Health Questionnaire, nine-item scale). The survey targeted otolaryngologists and staff in primary private practices in the Capital Region of Denmark during the COVID-19 lock-down in May 2020. RESULTS: For 30% of the participants, signs were observed of depressive symptoms and 13% had signs of anxiety symptoms. Seventy percent felt sufficiently protected by their available personal protective equipment. Fifty-two percent worried about becoming infected in relation to their work and 56% feared infecting their families. CONCLUSIONS: HCWs in Danish primary ENT practices did not display extraordinary stress reactions during the first wave of the pandemic. Noticeably, participants were concerned about acquiring the infection or transmitting it to their household.","Walvik, L.; Brejnebol, M. W.; Ravn, A. T.; Jensen, R. G.; Christensen, A.

Objectives The primary objective of this study was to develop a real-time geospatial surveillance system to monitor the spread of COVID-19 across the UK. Methods Using self-reported app data and the Secure Anonymised Information Linkage (SAIL) Databank, we demonstrate the use of sophisticated spatial modelling for near-real-time prediction of COVID-19 prevalence at small-area resolution to inform strategic government policy areas. Results We demonstrate that using a combination of crowd-sourced app data and sophisticated geo-statistical techniques it is possible to predict hot spots of COVID-19 at fine geographic scales, nationally. We are also able to produce estimates of their precision, which is an important pre-requisite to an effective control strategy to guard against over-reaction to potentially spurious features of 'best guess' predictions. Conclusion In the UK, important emerging risk-factors such as social deprivation or ethnicity vary over small distances, hence risk needs to be modelled at fine spatial resolution to avoid aggregation bias. We demonstrate that existing geospatial statistical methods originally developed for global health applications are well-suited to this task and can be used in an anonymised databank environment, thus preserving the privacy of the individuals who contribute their data.","Fry, Richard; Hollinghurst, Joe; Stagg, Helen R; Thompson, Daniel A; Fronterre, Claudio; Orton, Chris; Lyons, Ronan A; Ford, David V; Sheikh, Aziz; Diggle, Peter J",Int J Med Inform,46,24

Methods: Research on National decrees specific for the pandemic was carried out. The stroke pathways of four Italian regions from North to South, such as Lombardy, Veneto, Lazio and Campania, were analysed before and after the pandemic outbreak. Findings: On 29 February 2020, the Italian Minister of Health issued national guidelines on how to address the COVID-19 emergency. Stroke management was affected and required changes, basically resulting in the need to prioritise the ongoing COVID-19 emergency. In the most affected regions, the closure of departments and hospitals led to a complete reorganisation of previously functioning stroke networks. With the closure of several Stroke Units and Stroke Centres, the transportation time to hospital lengthened significantly, especially for the outlying populations. Discussion: The COVID-19 pandemic outbreak has been spreading rapidly in Italy and placing an overwhelming burden on healthcare systems. In response to this, political and healthcare decision-makers worked together to develop and implement efforts to sustain the national healthcare system while fighting the pandemic. Stroke care pathways changed during the pandemic and different organisational models were applied in the most affected regions. Conclusions: Stroke treatment pathways will need to be redesigned so to guarantee that severe and acute disease patients do not lose their rights to the access and delivery of care during the COVID-19 pandemics.","Zedde, Marialuisa; Pezzella, Francesca Romana; Paciaroni, Maurizio; Corea, Francesco; Reale, Nicoletta; Toni, Danilo; Caso, Valeria",Eur.

Given the sharply increased infection rate, the number of pregnant women and children with COVID-19 is correspondingly on the rise. SARS-CoV-2 infection is transmitted through droplets; though hypothesized, other transmission routes have not been confirmed. As of now, it remains unclear whether and how SARS-CoV-2 can possibly be transmitted from the mother to the fetus. METHOD: This study examines the medical records of 30 neonates born to women with COVID-19, the objective being to provide documented information on maternal-child transmission and infant outcomes. RESULTS: Out of the 30 newborns, 28 had negative PCR test results for SARS-CoV-2; among their mothers, fifteen had fever, nine had cough and twenty had delivered by cesarean section. The median birth term was 37wk2dy, and twenty of the neonates were male. Most of them were asymptomatic, except for the three who presented with shortness of breath. Two of them were intubated and both died, the first because of severe sepsis and the second due to severe hyaline membrane disease. As regards the two infected neonates, the first represents a probable case of congenital SARS-CoV-2 infection, which appears unlikely in the second case. The outcome for both of them was good, without any complications. CONCLUSION: Maternal-fetal transmission of the SARS- CoV-2 virus was not detected in the majority of the reported cases, although two of 30 neonates had positive qRT-PCR test results. Our study supports the hypothesis that though it seldom actually occurs, in utero SARS-CoV-2 vertical transmission is possible.","Ghema, K; Lehlimi, M; Toumi, H; Badre, A; Chemsi, M; Habzi, A; Benomar, S",,46,1

Role of dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) and Drp1-associated mitochondrial fragmentation in mitophagy and cytotoxicity after Cr(VI) exposure has not been clarified so far. We confirmed that Cr(VI) caused mitochondrial fission by up-regulating Drp1 expression and enhancing Drp1 mitochondrial translocation. By applying the intracellular Ca2+ antagonist BAPTA-AM and mitochondrial Ca2+ antagonist Ru360, we demonstrated that Cr(VI)-induced excessive mitochondrial fission was in a Ca2+-Drp1 dependent manner. The administration of Drp1 siRNA significantly suppressed the overactivation of mitophagy in Cr(VI)-induced hepatotoxicity. The specific Drp1 inhibitor mitochondrial division inhibitor-1 (Mdivi-1) blocked the overactive mitophagy and subsequently ameliorated hepatotoxicity caused by Cr(VI) in vivo. We reached the conclusion that Drp1-dependent mitochondrial fission contributes to Cr(VI)-induced mitophagy and hepatotoxicity, which may provide experimental basis for the study of chromium-associated toxicity, especially for the prevention of health damage in chromium-exposed population.","Zhang, Yujing; Ma, Yu; Xiao, Yuanyuan; Lu, Chan; Xiao, Fang",Ecotoxicol Environ Saf,46,30

The homotrimeric transmembrane spike (S) glycoprotein of coronaviruses which facilitates virus entry into the host cells is covered with N-linked glycans having oligomannose and complex sugars. These glycans provide a unique opportunity for their targeting via carbohydrate-binding agents (CBAs) which have shown their antiviral potential against coronaviruses and enveloped viruses. However, CBA-ligand interaction is not fully explored in developing novel carbohydrate-binding-based antivirals due to associated unfavorable responses with CBAs. CBAs possess unique carbohydrate-binding specificity, therefore, CBAs like mannose-specific plant lectins/lectin-like mimic Pradimicin-A (PRM-A) can be used for targeting N-linked glycans of S glycoproteins. Here, we report studies on the binding and stability of lectins (NPA, UDA, GRFT, CV-N and wild-type and mutant BanLec) and PRM-A with the S glycoprotein glycans via docking and MD simulation. MM/GBSA calculations were also performed for docked complexes. Interestingly, stable BanLec mutant (H84T) also showed similar docking affinity and interactions as compared to wild-type BanLec, thus, confirming that uncoupling the mitogenic activity did not alter the lectin binding activity of BanLec. The stability of the docked complexes, i.e. PRM-A and lectins with SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein showed favorable intermolecular hydrogen-bond formation during the 100 ns MD simulation. Taking these together, our predicted in silico results will be helpful in the design and development of novel CBA-based antivirals for the SARS-CoV-2 neutralization. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

MATERIAL AND METHODS We conducted an epidemiological investigation enrolling 631 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from our clinic from January to March 2020. Patients' information was collected through a standard questionnaire. Then, we described the patients' epidemiological characteristics, analyzed risk factors associated with disease severity, and assessed causes of zero mortality. Additionally, some key technologies for epidemic prevention and control were identified. RESULTS Of the 631 patients, 8.46% (n=53) were severe cases, and no deaths were recorded (n=0). The epidemic of COVID-19 has gone through 4 stages: a sporadic phase, an exponential growth phase, a peak plateau phase, and a declining phase. The proportion of severe cases was significantly different among the 4 stages and 13 municipal prefectures (P<0.001). Factors including age >65 years old, underlying medical conditions, highest fever >39.0°C, dyspnea, and lymphocytopenia (<1.0×109/L) were early warning signs of disease severity (P<0.05). In contrast, earlier clinic visits were associated with better patient outcomes (P=0.029). Further, the viral load was a potentially useful marker associated with COVID-19 infection severity. CONCLUSIONS The study findings from the beginning of the COVID-19 epidemic in Jiangsu Province, China showed that patients who were more than 65 years of age and with comorbidities and presented with a fever of more than 39.0°C developed more severe disease. However, mortality was prevented in this initial patient population by early supportive clinical management.","Ji, Hong; Dai, Qigang; Jin, Hui; Xu, Ke; Ai, Jing; Fang, Xinyu; Shi, Naiyang; Huang, Haodi; Wu, Ying; Peng, Zhihang; Hu, Jianli; Zhu, Liguo; Bao, Changjun; Wu, Ming",Med Sci Monit,46,1

Besides the possible consequences of COVID-19 infection on a pregnant woman and the fetus, a major concern is related to the potential effect on neonatal outcome, the appropriate management of the mother-newborn dyad, and finally the compatibility of maternal COVID-19 infection with breastfeeding. The Italian Society on Neonatology (SIN) after reviewing the limited scientific knowledge on the compatibility of breastfeeding in the COVID-19 mother and the available statements from Health Care Organizations has issued the following indications that have been endorsed by the Union of European Neonatal & Perinatal Societies (UENPS). If a mother previously identified as COVID-19 positive or under investigation for COVID-19 is asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic at delivery, rooming-in is feasible, and direct breastfeeding is advisable, under strict measures of infection control. On the contrary, when a mother with COVID-19 is too sick to care for the newborn, the neonate will be managed separately and fed fresh expressed breast milk, with no need to pasteurize it, as human milk is not believed to be a vehicle of COVID-19. We recognize that this guidance might be subject to change in the future when further knowledge will be acquired about the COVID-19 pandemic, the perinatal transmission of SARS-CoV-2, and clinical characteristics of cases of neonatal COVID-19.","Davanzo, Riccardo; Moro, Guido; Sandri, Fabrizio; Agosti, Massimo; Moretti, Corrado; Mosca, Fabio",Matern Child Nutr,46,24

METHODS: Interviews with 27 key informants in 15 states with successful IPS programs in rural communities identified challenges that IPS workers faced because of rurality and the work-around methods they used to overcome these challenges. The authors conducted a thematic analysis of interviews. RESULTS: Significant challenges to implementing IPS in rural areas included limited availability of public transportation, Internet connectivity, employment opportunities, and workforce. The work-around strategies used by IPS teams differed in relation to local circumstances and cultures, but effective services generally used natural supports for transportation, provided computer access for job applicants, developed relationships with local employers, and hired IPS workers with local knowledge. CONCLUSIONS: The adaptations made to IPS in rural areas are specific to local communities but retain core IPS principles.","Al-Abdulmunem, Monirah; Drake, Robert E; Carpenter-Song, Elizabeth",Psychiatr Serv,46,10

Fifty per cent of tumors were grade I; 32.2% grade II and 17.8% grade III. Primary tumor stage was: invasive (> >pT1=31.1% and superficial (pTA-1=68.9%). Eighty-seven tumors (96.6%) expressed PCNA (median 72.5%, mean 60.1%). The mean PCNA index was not different (p = 0.39) in superficial or invasive tumors.

The incorporation of cyclodextrin moieties into larger structures produces five types of new materials: crosslinked networks, functionalized chains, amphiphilic cyclodextrins, polyrotaxanes and nanocomposites. This review presents crosslinking and grafting to prepare covalently-attached cyclodextrins, and applications in the food and pharmaceutical sectors, from an historical point of view. In food science, applications include debittering of juices, retention of aromas and release of preservatives from packaging. In biomedical science, cyclodextrin polymers are applied classically to drug release, and more recently to gene delivery and regenerative medicine. The remarkable points are: 1) epichlorohydrin and diisocyanates have been extensively used as crosslinkers since the 1960s, but during the last two decades more complex cyclodextrin polymeric structures have been designed. 2) The evolution of cyclodextrin polymers matches that of macromolecular materials with regard to complexity, functionality and capabilities. 3) The use of cyclodextrin polymers as sorbents in the food sector came first, but smart packaging is now an active challenge.

Since most people have little or no experience interacting with a robot, it is not surprising that robots deployed in the real world may fail to gain acceptance or engage their intended users. To address this issue, we examine users' understanding of robots in public spaces and their expectations of appropriate uses of robots in these spaces. Furthermore, we investigate how these perceptions and expectations change as users engage and interact with a robot. To support this goal, we conducted a participatory design workshop in which participants were actively involved in the prototyping and testing of a robot's behaviours in simulation and on the physical robot. Our work highlights how social and interaction contexts influence users' perception of robots in public spaces and how users' design and understanding of what are appropriate robot behaviors shifts as they observe the enactment of their designs.","Carreno-Medrano, Pamela; Tian, Leimin; Allen, Aimee; Sumartojo, Shanti; Mintrom, Michael; Coronado, Enrique; Venture, Gentiane; Croft, Elizabeth; Kulic, Dana",,46,1

In this regard, it is absolutely imperative to understand the mechanism of metabolic reprogramming of host human cells by SARS-CoV-2. A better understanding of the metabolic alterations would aid in design of better therapeutics to deal with COVID-19 pandemic. We developed an integrated genome-scale metabolic model of normal human bronchial epithelial cells (NHBE) infected with SARS-CoV-2 using gene-expression and macromolecular make-up of the virus. The reconstructed model predicts growth rates of the virus in high agreement with the experimental measured values. Furthermore, we report a method for conducting genome-scale differential flux analysis (GS-DFA) in context-specific metabolic models. We apply the method to the context-specific model and identify severely affected metabolic modules predominantly comprising of lipid metabolism. We conduct an integrated analysis of the flux-altered reactions, host-virus protein-protein interaction network and phospho-proteomics data to understand the mechanism of flux alteration in host cells. We show that several enzymes driving the altered reactions inferred by our method to be directly interacting with viral proteins and also undergoing differential phosphorylation under diseased state. In case of SARS-CoV-2 infection, lipid metabolism particularly fatty acid oxidation, cholesterol biosynthesis and beta-oxidation cycle along with arachidonic acid metabolism are predicted to be most affected which confirms with clinical metabolomics studies. GS-DFA can be applied to existing repertoire of high-throughput proteomic or transcriptomic data in diseased condition to understand metabolic deregulation at the level of flux.","Nanda, Piyush; Ghosh, Amit",PLoS Comput Biol,46,16

This study assessed a short-term evolution of vitamin D status and its influence upon different clinical parameters in critically ill patients with COVID-19. METHODS: A prospective analytical study in which 37 critically ill volunteers between 41 and 71 years of age with COVID-19 were evaluated at baseline and three days of intensive care unit (ICU) stay. 25-OH-D3 and 25-OH-D2 were analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and total 25-OH-D levels were calculated as the sum of both. RESULTS: All patients presented low 25-OH-D levels at baseline, decreasing total 25-OH-D (p = 0.011) mainly through 25-OH-D2 (p = 0.006) levels during ICU stay. 25-OH-D2 levels decreased a mean of 41.6% ± 89.6% versus 7.0% ± 23.4% for the 25-OH-D3 form during the ICU stay. Patients who did not need invasive mechanical ventilation presented higher levels of 25-OH-D2 at baseline and follow-up. Lower 25-OH-D and 25-OH-D3 levels were associated with higher D-dimer at baseline (p = 0.003; p = 0.001) and at follow up (p = 0.029), higher procalcitonin levels (p = 0.002; p = 0.018) at follow up, and lower percentage lymphocyte counts (p = 0.044; p = 0.040) during ICU stay. CONCLUSIONS: Deficient vitamin D status in critical patients was established at the admission and further worsened after three days of stay. Lower vitamin D levels were related to key altered clinical and biochemical parameters on patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Given the different response of the 25-OH-D3 and 25-OH-D2 forms, it would be useful to monitor them on the evolution of the critically ill patient.","Herrera-Quintana, Lourdes; Gamarra-Morales, Yenifer; Vázquez-Lorente, Héctor; Molina-López, Jorge; Castaño-Pérez, José; Machado-Casas, Juan Francisco; Coca-Zúñiga, Ramón; Pérez-Villares, José Miguel; Planells, Elena",Nutrients,46,16

METHODS: At first, the operational strategies that were implemented at the Broadmeadows ECT suite were summarised. Subsequently, the characteristics of patients who received ECT in the lockdown period (16 March-16 September 2020) and in the comparison period (16 March-16 September 2019) were compared. RESULTS: Many safety measures were implemented, and there was no COVID-19 infection among mental health staff and patients. In the lockdown period, the number of patients (23.9%) and the total number of ECTs (29.4%) were less. This pattern was more prominent among the aged patients. CONCLUSION: Safe practices are essential to provide ECT during lockdowns even when the community transmission of COVID-19 is high.","Jagadheesan, Karuppiah; Walker, Frances; Danivas, Vijay; Itrat, Quratulain; Lakra, Vinay",Australas Psychiatry,46,6

Therefore, there is a critical need to identify underlying metabolic factors associated with obesity that could be contributing toward increased susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 in this vulnerable population. Here, we focus on the critical role of potent endogenous lipid metabolites known as specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs) that are synthesized from polyunsaturated fatty acids. SPMs are generated during the transition of inflammation to resolution and have a vital role in directing damaged tissues to homeostasis; furthermore, SPMs display anti-viral activity in the context of influenza infection without being immunosuppressive. We cover evidence from rodent and human studies to show that obesity, and its co-morbidities, induce a signature of SPM deficiency across immunometabolic tissues. We further discuss how the effects of obesity upon SARS-CoV-2 infection are likely exacerbated with environmental exposures that promote chronic pulmonary inflammation and augment SPM deficits. Finally, we highlight potential approaches to overcome the loss of SPMs using dietary and pharmacological interventions. Collectively, this mini-review underscores the need for mechanistic studies on how SPM deficiencies driven by obesity and environmental exposures may exacerbate the response to SARS-CoV-2.","Pal, Anandita; Gowdy, Kymberly M; Oestreich, Kenneth J; Beck, Melinda; Shaikh, Saame Raza",Front Immunol,46,32

However, there is no resource that provides a holistic picture of the available mHealth apps that have been developed to combat this pandemic. Objective: Our aim is to scope the evidence base on apps that were developed in response to COVID-19. Methods: Following the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines for scoping reviews, literature searches were conducted on Google Search, Google Scholar, and PubMed using the country's name as keywords and ""coronavirus,"" ""COVID-19,"" ""nCOV19,"" ""contact tracing,"" ""information providing apps,"" ""symptom tracking,"" ""mobile apps,"" ""mobile applications,"" ""smartphone,"" ""mobile phone,"" and ""mHealth."" Countries most affected by COVID-19 and those that first rolled out COVID-19-related apps were included. Results: A total of 46 articles were reviewed from 19 countries, resulting in a total of 29 apps. Among them, 15 (52%) apps were on contact tracing, 7 (24%) apps on quarantine, 7 (24%) on symptom monitoring, and 1 (3%) on information provision. More than half (n=20, 69%) were from governmental sources, only 3 (10%) were from private organizations, and 3 (10%) from universities. There were 6 (21%) apps available on either Android or iOS, and 10 (34%) were available on both platforms. Bluetooth was used in 10 (34%) apps for collecting data, 12 (41%) apps used GPS, and 12 (41%) used other forms of data collection. Conclusions: This review identifies that the majority of COVID-19 apps were for contact tracing and symptom monitoring. However, these apps are effective only if taken up by the community. The sharing of good practices across different countries can enable governments to learn from each other and develop effective strategies to combat and manage this pandemic.","John Leon Singh, Hanson; Couch, Danielle; Yap, Kevin",JMIR Nurs,46,16

In addition, contamination of fresh produce with foodborne human pathogens has become a concern. Gaseous ozone has multiple benefits including destruction of ethylene, inactivation of foodborne and spoilage microorganisms, and degradation of chemical residues. This article reviews the beneficial effects of gaseous ozone, its influence on quality and biochemical changes, foodborne human pathogens, and spoilage microorganisms, and discusses research needs with an emphasis on fruits. Ozone may induce synthesis of a number of antioxidants and bioactive compounds by activating secondary metabolisms involving a wide range of enzymes. Disparities exist in the literature regarding the impact of gaseous ozone on quality and physiological processes of fresh produce, such as weight loss, ascorbic acid, and fruit ripening. The disparities are complicated by incomplete reporting of the necessary information, such as relative humidity and temperatures at which ozone measurement and treatment were performed, which is needed for accurate comparison of results among studies. In order to fully realize the benefits of gaseous ozone, research is needed to evaluate the molecular mechanisms of gaseous ozone in inhibiting ripening, influence of relative humidity on the antimicrobial efficacy, interaction between ozone and the cuticle of fresh produce, ozone signaling pathways in the cells and tissues, and so forth. Possible adverse effects of gaseous ozone on quality of fresh produce also need to be carefully evaluated for the purpose of enhancing microbial and chemical safety of fresh produce.","Fan, Xuetong",,46,2

Ministers' work frequently puts them in close contact with diverse groups, and therefore at higher risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2, but this is not specific to Africa. This paper discusses five non-mutually exclusive hypotheses for the Africa-specific trend, involving comorbidity, poorly resourced healthcare and possible restrictions in accessing out-of-country health facilities, the underreporting of cases, and, later, the disproportionate impact of the so-called 'South African' variant (501Y.V2). The paper then turns its attention to the public health and political implications of the trend. While governments have measures in place to cope with the sudden loss of top officials, the COVID-19-related deaths have been associated with substantial changes in public health policy in cases where the response to the pandemic had initially been contested or minimal. Ministerial deaths may also result in a reconfiguration of political leadership, but we do not expect a wave of younger and more gender representative replacements. Rather, we speculate that a disconnect may emerge between the top leadership and the public, with junior ministers filling the void and in so doing putting themselves more at risk of infection. Opposition politicians may also be at significant risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2.","Falisse, Jean-Benoît; Macdonald, Robert; Molony, Thomas; Nugent, Paul",,46,10

Recently, IFN-&#945; has been considered a potential therapeutic strategy to treat COVID-19 disease, mainly because the innate immune system rapidly produces IFN-&#945; as the first line of defense to combat viral infections. However, IFN-&#945; can also play a role in immunoregulatory effects, causing pathogenic damage and uncontrolled inflammatory responses. There are 13 human IFN-&#945; subtypes that bind to the same receptor and induce different interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) expression, regulating various antiviral and immunoregulatory effects. The varying degrees of inflammatory regulations may raise concerns about the possible side effects to enlarge the inflammatory responses, exacerbating the severity of infection.

Thanks to a formidable universal effort, several SARS-CoV-2 vaccines have been marketed less than a year since the first documented COVID-19 case, with promising safety, efficacy, and immunogenicity results in adults. As children were not included in the initial trials, no vaccine is currently approved for individuals <16 years of age. Similarly, immunosuppressed individuals, such as solid organ transplant recipients, were excluded from initial vaccine trials, limiting the understanding of vaccine immunogenicity and safety in this at-risk population. Thus, data regarding COVID-19 vaccination in pediatric solid organ transplantation recipients are currently lacking. METHODS: Members of the International Pediatric Transplant Association review the current general status of COVID-19 vaccines focusing on pediatric-specific issues. RESULTS: This review provides an overview of COVID-19 vaccines in pediatric SOT recipients and highlights the current paucity of data in both pediatric and transplant settings in terms of safety, immunogenicity, and clinical efficacy.

We report the results of a case-population study done in Madrid, Spain, since the outbreak of COVID-19. METHODS: In this case-population study, we consecutively selected patients aged 18 years or older with a PCR-confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 requiring admission to hospital from seven hospitals in Madrid, who had been admitted between March 1 and March 24, 2020. As a reference group, we randomly sampled ten patients per case, individually matched for age, sex, region (ie, Madrid), and date of admission to hospital (month and day; index date), from Base de datos para la Investigación Farmacoepidemiológica en Atención Primaria (BIFAP), a Spanish primary health-care database, in its last available year (2018). We extracted information on comorbidities and prescriptions up to the month before index date (ie, current use) from electronic clinical records of both cases and controls. The outcome of interest was admission to hospital of patients with COVID-19. To minimise confounding by indication, the main analysis focused on assessing the association between COVID-19 requiring admission to hospital and use of RAAS inhibitors compared with use of other antihypertensive drugs. We calculated odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs, adjusted for age, sex, and cardiovascular comorbidities and risk factors, using conditional logistic regression. The protocol of the study was registered in the EU electronic Register of Post-Authorisation Studies, EUPAS34437. FINDINGS: We collected data for 1139 cases and 11â390 population controls. Among cases, 444 (39·0%) were female and the mean age was 69·1 years (SD 15·4), and despite being matched on sex and age, a significantly higher proportion of cases had pre-existing cardiovascular disease (OR 1·98, 95% CI 1·62-2·41) and risk factors (1·46, 1·23-1·73) than did controls. Compared with users of other antihypertensive drugs, users of RAAS inhibitors had an adjusted OR for COVID-19 requiring admission to hospital of 0·94 (95% CI 0·77-1·15). No increased risk was observed with either angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (adjusted OR 0·80, 0·64-1·00) or angiotensin-receptor blockers (1·10, 0·88-1·37). Sex, age, and background cardiovascular risk did not modify the adjusted OR between use of RAAS inhibitors and COVID-19 requiring admission to hospital, whereas a decreased risk of COVID-19 requiring admission to hospital was found among patients with diabetes who were users of RAAS inhibitors (adjusted OR 0·53, 95% CI 0·34-0·80). The adjusted ORs were similar across severity degrees of COVID-19.

In humans, these family of viruses can cause the respiratory infections from mild form to fatal forms. It is preferably called as coronavirus. Formally it known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) or 2019 novel coronavirus (2019- nCoV) and this disease is called as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). SARS-CoV-2 is infectious in humans and world health organization has announced that Covid-19 as a pandemic disease. Tocilizumab is a biological agent which inhibits the cytokine, interleukin 6 (IL-6 inhibitor). As SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to the development of cytokine storm syndrome, the drug tocilizumab seems to have positive effect in patients with covid-19. PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: To analyze and review the possible effects and efficacy of the tocilizumab (monoclonal antibody against IL-6 receptors) in SARS-CoV-2 patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The search strategy on recent research and review articles is used for the SARS-CoV-2 disease and their characteristics. Furthermore we have analyzed most recent research article on monoclonal antibody against IL-6 receptors (tocilizumab) and their possible clinical effects in Covid-19 and their clinical trials on Covid-19 patients. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Covid-19 is a disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. It is a life threatening condition which can give rise to fatal outcomes if left untreated. However there are no approved treatment for covid-19 globally. Furthermore we can conclude that SARS-CoV-2 is associated with worsening of lung conditions characterized by interstitial pneumonia with acute respiratory distress syndrome as a result of cytokine storm syndrome. According to available research data tocilizumab, a recombinant humanized anti-human monoclonal antibody of IgG1&#964; (gamma 1, kappa) can improve patient's condition from cytokine storm syndrome by inhibiting the IL-6 (Interleukin 6) receptors. The rational use of the tocilizumab in severe and critically ill covid-19 patients can prevent the development of irreversible lung injury and death of the patient. Three retrospective studies of Xiaoling Xu et al., Pan luo et al. and Paola Tonaiti et al. has shown the efficacy of tocilizumab in severe and critically ill covid-19 patients. However we need more randomized research studies with significant number of patients which can confirm the promising results on tocilizumab treatment in covid-19 patients and even ongoing clinical trails such as TOSCA, COVACTA results has not been published yet which are expected to give better and more significant results on tocilizumab's effectiveness and safety.","Kulanthaivel, Shanmugaraj; Kaliberdenko, Vitalii B; Balasundaram, Keerthanaa; Shterenshis, Michael V; Scarpellini, Emidio; Abenavoli, Ludovico",Reviews on recent clinical trials (Online),46,33

However, sample size was small and the incidence of GI symptoms in patients was variable across studies, and the correlation between these symptoms and clinical outcomes remains incompletely understood. The objective of this study is to compare clinical characteristics and outcomes between patients with and without GI symptoms admitted to Jianghan Fangcang Shelter Hospital in Wuhan. This retrospective study recruited 1320 COVID-19 patients admitted to hospital from 5 February 2020 to 9 March 2020. On the basis of the presence of GI symptoms, the sample was divided into a GI group (n = 192) and a non-GI group (n = 1128). The three most common GI symptoms were diarrhea (8.1%), anorexia (4.7%), and nausea and vomiting (4.3%). The rate of clinical deterioration was significantly higher in the GI group than in the non-GI group (15.6% vs. 10.1%, P = .032). GI symptoms (P = .045), male gender P < .001), and increased C-reactive protein (P = .008) were independent risk factors for clinical worsening. This study demonstrated that the rate of clinical deterioration was significantly higher in the GI group. Furthermore, potential risk factors for developing GI symptoms, male gender, and increased C-reactive protein can help clinicians predict clinical outcomes in COVID-19 patients.","Zheng, Ting; Yang, Chao; Wang, Han-Yu; Chen, Xiao; Yu, Li; Wu, Zi-Ling; Sun, Hui",J. med. virol,46,1

It consists of three phases, Design, Develop and Deploy, and 17 constituent stages across the three phases from conception to production of any AI initiative. The 'Design' phase highlights the importance of contextualising a problem description by reviewing public domain and service-based literature on state-of-the-art AI applications, algorithms, pre-trained models and equally importantly ethics guidelines and frameworks, which then informs the data, or Big Data, acquisition and preparation. The 'Develop' phase is technique-oriented, as it transforms data and algorithms into AI models that are benchmarked, evaluated and explained. The 'Deploy' phase evaluates computational performance, which then apprises pipelines for model operationalisation, culminating in the hyperautomation of a process or system as a complete AI solution, that is continuously monitored and evaluated to inform the next iteration of the life cycle. An ontological mapping of AI algorithms to applications, followed by an organisational context for the AI life cycle are further contributions of this article.","Silva, Daswin De; Alahakoon, Damminda",,46,26

Nonetheless, the issues surrounding AI services remain relatively unknown. The purpose for this paper is to offer a digital servitization framework for understanding how AI services impact value perceptions, consumer engagement and firm performance measures. The authors use the financial service ecosystem to explore this topic.Design/methodology/approachThe authors explore relevant literature on digital servitization, service-dominant logic and AI/disruptive innovation. Next, a conceptual framework, organized by AI-Service Exchange Antecedents, Context of AI Usage and Digital Servitization Consequences, is developed. The authors conceptualize consequences for consumers and firms.FindingsThe main findings suggest that the linkages between consumers, financial institutions and fintech companies with AI usage in a service ecosystem should be identified;how value is created among multiple SD Logic-AI network actors should be analyzed;and the effects of AI-consumer interactions (lower-level and higher levels of engagement) on firm performance measures should be explored.Research limitations/implicationsThe conceptual framework identifies gaps in the literature and suggests research questions for future studies.Practical implicationsThis paper may assist practitioners with the development of AI-enabled banking activities that involve direct consumer engagement.Originality/valueTo the authors’ best knowledge, this research agenda is the first comprehensive framework for understanding value co-creation in the context of AI in financial services, linking antecedents, usage and consequences.","Manser Payne, Elizabeth H.; Dahl, Andrew J.; Peltier, James",Journal of Research in Interactive Marketing,46,32

Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitors (BTKi), such as ibrutinib, are commonly used to treat indolent B-cell neoplasms and chronic graft-versus-host disease (GvHD). Given their potential to suppress pulmonary inflammatory cytokines and lessen acute lung injury, this could be applicable in the context of hospitalised COVID-19 patients. We describe an 81 year-old male receiving ibrutinib for Waldenstrom macroglobulinaemia (WM) who was hospitalised with COVID-19. On stopping the BTKi due to concerns of additional immunosuppression, he required non-invasive ventilation (NIV) in the intensive care unit (ICU) and demonstrated prompt clinical recovery when ibrutinib was reinstated. Continuing ibrutinib in patients with COVID-19 may be advantageous given its immunomodulatory properties and withdrawal of ibrutinib therapy may be detrimental. Further evidence is required to explore the potential therapeutic impact of BTKis and other immunomodulatory agents on the clinical course of COVID-19 as is currently being carried out in a number of clinical trials.","Maynard, Suzanne; Ros-Soto, Jose; Chaidos, Aris; Innes, Andrew; Paleja, Krushika; Mirvis, Eitan; Buti, Noora; Sharp, Harriet; Palanicawandar, Renuka; Milojkovic, Dragana",Int J Infect Dis,46,16

Knowing the role that environmental factors play in influenza virus outbreaks, environmental pollution and, in particular, atmospheric airborne (particulate matter, PM) has been considered as a potential key factor in the spread and mortality of COVID-19. A possible role of the PM as the virus carrier has also been debated. The role of PM in exacerbating respiratory and cardiovascular disease has been well recognized. Accumulating evidence support the hypothesis that PM can trigger inflammatory response at molecular, cellular and organ levels. On this basis, we developed the hypothesis that PM may play a role as a booster of COVID-19 rather than as a carrier of SARS-CoV-2. To support our hypothesis, we analyzed the molecular signatures detected in cells exposed to PM samples collected in one of the most affected areas by the COVID-19 outbreak, in Italy. T47D human breast adenocarcinoma cells were chosen to explore the global gene expression changes induced by the treatment with organic extracts of PM 2.5. The analysis of the KEGG's pathways showed modulation of several gene networks related to the leucocyte transendothelial migration, cytoskeleton and adhesion system. Three major biological process were identified, including coagulation, growth control and immune response. The analysis of the modulated genes gave evidence for the involvement of PM in the endothelial disease, coagulation disorders, diabetes and reproductive toxicity, supporting the hypothesis that PM, directly or through molecular interplay, affects the same molecular targets as so far known for SARS-COV-2, contributing to the cytokines storm and to the aggravation of the symptoms triggered by COVID-19. We provide evidence for a plausible cooperation of receptors and transmembrane proteins, targeted by PM and involved in COVID-19, together with new insights into the molecular interplay of chemicals and pathogens that could be of importance for sustaining public health policies and developing new therapeutic approaches.","Mescoli, Ada; Maffei, Giangabriele; Pillo, Gelsomina; Bortone, Giuseppe; Marchesi, Stefano; Morandi, Elena; Ranzi, Andrea; Rotondo, Francesca; Serra, Stefania; Vaccari, Monica; Zauli Sajani, Stefano; Mascolo, Maria Grazia; Jacobs, Miriam Naomi; Colacci, Annamaria",Front Genet,46,23

Methods: Internet-based survey by invitation of IBD services across the UK from 8 to 14 April 2020. Results: Respondents from 125 IBD services completed the survey. The number of whole-time equivalent gastroenterologists and IBD nurses providing elective outpatient care decreased significantly between baseline (median 4, IQR 4-7.5 and median 3, IQR 2-4) to the point of survey (median 2, IQR 1-4.8 and median 2, IQR 1-3) in the 6-week period following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic (p&lt;0.001 for both comparisons). Almost all (94%; 112/119) services reported an increase in IBD helpline activity. Face-to-face clinics were substituted for telephone consultation by 86% and video consultation by 11% of services. A variation in the provision of laboratory faecal calprotectin testing was noted with 27% of services reporting no access to faecal calprotectin, and a further 32% reduced access. There was also significant curtailment of IBD-specific endoscopy and elective surgery. Conclusions: IBD services in the UK have implemented several adaptive strategies in order to continue to provide safe and high-quality care for patients. National Health Service organisations will need to consider the impact of these changes in current service delivery models and staffing levels when planning exit strategies for post-pandemic IBD care. Careful planning to manage the increased workload and to maintain IBD services is essential to ensure patient safety.","Kennedy, Nicholas A.; Hansen, Richard; Younge, Lisa; Mawdsley, Joel; Beattie, Mark; Din, Shahida; Lamb, Christopher A.; Smith, Philip J.; Selinger, Christian; Limdi, Jimmy; Iqbal, Tariq H.; Lobo, Alan; Cooney, Rachel; Brain, Oliver; Gaya, Daniel R.; Murray, Charles; Pollok, Richard; Kent, Alexandra; Raine, Tim; Bhala, Neeraj; Lindsay, James O.; Irving, Peter M.; Lees, Charlie W.; Sebastian, Shaji",Frontline Gastroenterol.,46,16

The radiomics, which explores huge amounts of features from medical image for disease diagnosis, may help the screen of the COVID-19. In this study, we aim to develop a radiomic signature to screen COVID-19 from CT images. We retrospectively collect 75 pneumonia patients from Beijing Youan Hospital, including 46 patients with COVID-19 and 29 other types of pneumonias. These patients are divided into training set (n = 50) and test set (n = 25) at random. We segment the lung lesions from the CT images, and extract 77 radiomic features from the lesions. Then unsupervised consensus clustering and multiple cross-validation are utilized to select the key features that are associated with the COVID-19. In the experiments, while twenty-three radiomic features are found to be highly associated with COVID-19, four key features are screened and used as the inputs of support vector machine to build the radiomic signature. We use area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and calibration curve to assess the performance of our model. It yields AUCs of 0.862 and 0.826 in the training set and the test set respectively. We also perform the stratified analysis and find that its predictive ability is not affected by gender, age, chronic disease and degree of severity. In conclusion, we investigate the value of radiomics in screening COVID-19, and the experimental results suggest the radiomic signature could be a potential tool for diagnosis of COVID-19.","Fang, Mengjie; He, Bingxi; Li, Li; Dong, Di; Yang, Xin; Li, Cong; Meng, Lingwei; Zhong, Lianzhen; Li, Hailin; Li, Hongjun; Tian, Jie",Sci.

In the mental health sector, psychologists and psychiatrists have been forced to alter the standard care of patients without compromising safety. This article documents the experiences of the authors–mental health professionals in four countries, Canada, Russia, Australia and Japan–at the time of the COVID-19 pandemic, and offers recommendations on how clinical, training, and research practices may need to be adjusted to deal with lockdown situations. Clinicians adapted their usual best practices by learning new skills and updating their knowledge base. Mental health clinicians noticed that the pandemic led to symptomatic changes in some of their patients. Most clinicians moved towards providing telemental health services, such as conducting assessments and treatments remotely. Those who continued seeing patients in person employed personal protective equipment with various impacts on the clinician–patient relationship. The dilemmas of mass quarantines need to be carefully examined, as their effects on numerous health and psychosocial variables appear to be far-reaching.","Jurcik, Tomas; Jarvis, G.

METHODS: We searched PubMed/MEDLINE/Embase for cohort studies and meta-analysis reporting mortality by pre-existing ARB/ACE inhibitor treatment in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Random effects meta-regression was used to compute pooled odds ratios for mortality adjusted for imbalance in age, sex and prevalence of cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease between users and non-users of ARBs/ACE inhibitors at the study-level during data synthesis. RESULTS: In 30 included studies of 17,281 patients, 22%, 68%, 25%, and 11% had cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease. ARBs/ACE inhibitors use was associated with significantly lower mortality after controlling for potential confounding factors (OR 0.77 (95% CI: 0.62, 0.96)). In contrast, meta-analysis of ARBs/ACE inhibitors use was not significantly associated with mortality when all studies were combined with no confounder adjustment performed (0.87 (95% CI: 0.71, 1.08)). CONCLUSIONS: ARBs/ACE inhibitors use was associated with decreased mortality in cohorts of COVID-19 patients after adjusting for age, sex, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes and chronic kidney disease.

Our aim was to evaluate the impact of a gamified e-learning module on adequacy of PPE in student paramedics. METHODS: This was a web-based, randomized 1:1, parallel-group, triple-blind controlled trial. Student paramedics from three Swiss schools were invited to participate. They were informed they would be presented with both an e-learning module and an abridged version of the current regional prehospital COVID-19 guidelines, albeit not in which order. After a set of 22 questions designed to assess baseline knowledge, the control group was shown the guidelines before answering a set of 14 post-intervention questions. The e-learning group was shown the gamified e-learning module right after the guidelines, and before answering post-intervention questions. The primary outcome was the difference in the percentage of adequate choices of PPE before and after the intervention. RESULTS: The participation rate was of 71% (98/138). A total of 90 answer sets was analyzed. Adequate choice of PPE increased significantly both in the control (50% [33;83] vs 25% [25;50], P = .013) and in the e-learning group (67% [50;83] vs 25% [25;50], P = .001) following the intervention. Though the median of the difference was higher in the e-learning group, there was no statistically significant superiority over the control (33% [0;58] vs 17% [- 17;42], P = .087). The e-learning module was of greatest benefit in the subgroup of student paramedics who were actively working in an ambulance company (42% [8;58] vs 25% [- 17;42], P = 0.021). There was no significant effect in student paramedics who were not actively working in an ambulance service (0% [- 25;33] vs 17% [- 8;50], P = .584). CONCLUSIONS: The use of a gamified e-learning module increases the rate of adequate choice of PPE only among student paramedics actively working in an ambulance service. In this subgroup, combining this teaching modality with other interventions might help spare PPE and efficiently protect against COVID-19 infection.","Suppan, Laurent; Stuby, Loric; Gartner, Birgit; Larribau, Robert; Iten, Anne; Abbas, Mohamed; Harbarth, Stephan; Suppan, Mélanie",Antimicrob Resist Infect Control,46,16

At the cellular level, protein interactions play a key role and their ensemble, also called interactome, is often referred as the basic building blocks of life. Given its importance, the maintenance of the integrity of the interactome is a real challenge in the cell. Many events during evolution can disrupt interactomes and potentially result in different characteristics for the organisms. However, the molecular underpinnings of changes in interactions at the cellular level are still largely unexplored. Among the perturbations, hybridization puts in contact two different interactomes, which may lead to many changes in the protein interaction network of the hybrid, including gains and losses of interactions. We recently investigated the fate of the interactomes after hybridization between yeast species using a comparative proteomics approach. A large-scale conservation of the interactions was observed in hybrids, but we also noticed the presence of proteostasis-related changes. This suggests that, despite a general robustness, small differences may accumulate in hybrids and perturb their protein physiology. Here, we summarize our work with a broader perspective on the importance of interactions.","Berger, Caroline M; Landry, Christian R",Curr. genet,46,29

This study aims to determine the impact of COVID-19 pandemic and other related factors such as resource availability and institutional support on well-being, burnout and job-satisfaction of EM physicians in the United States. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey study of EM physicians was conducted through the Emergency Medicine Practice Research Network of the ACEP. The survey focused on resource adequacy, institutional support, well-being, and burnout. A total of 890 EM physicians were invited to participate. Both descriptive and risk adjusted, and multivariate regressions were performed with a statistical significance defined as p < 0.05. RESULTS: EM physicians' response rate was 18.7% (166) from 39 states. Burnout was reported by 74.7% (124) since the start of the pandemic. Factors contributing included work-related emotional strain and anxiety, isolation from family and friends, and increased workload. Those reporting inadequate resources felt ignored by their institutions (p < 0.0001). Physicians who felt there was inadequate institutional support, were also dissatisfied with patient care resources (p = 0.001). Physicians expressing job dissatisfaction were more likely to report feelings of burnout (p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: EM physicians face greater burnout in the COVID-19 pandemic. This may be compounded by resource scarcity, psychological stress, isolation, and job dissatisfaction. Many of the survey respondents reported inadequate mental health services and resources. The findings of this study may help identify solutions to mitigate these issues.","Nguyen, Jackie; Liu, Amy; McKenney, Mark; Liu, Huazhi; Ang, Darwin; Elkbuli, Adel",Am J Emerg Med,46,16

Several researchers investigated to understand how temperature, humidity and air pollution had an influence on COVID-19 transmission. Transmission of COVID-19 due to temperature and humidity is a pertinent question. There is a lack of study of Covid-19 in tropical climate countries. This study aims to analyze the correlation between weather and Covid-19 pandemic in Brasília and Manaus, two states of Brazil. The research topic is important to know how the climate affects or predisposes the spread of COVID-19. This knowledge will provide elements to decision-makers regarding health and public health standards and decisions. This study employed a secondary data analysis of surveillance data of Covid-19 from the Ministry of Health of Brazil and weather from the National Institute of Meteorology of Brazil. These are Brazilian public organizations that, on a daily basis, record this information on a systematic basis of dates. They are central federal organizations, responsible for data analysis and public policy planning to combat Covid-19. The data are reliables and obtained from reliable government sources. We systematically record all information for 51 days, during a period of high disease growth in the country. The components of weather include low temperature (°C), high temperature (°C), temperature average (°C), humidity (%), and amount of rainfall (mm). Pearson-rank correlation test showed that high temperature (r=.643;p&lt;.001), low temperature (r=.640;p&lt;.001) and humidity (r=.248;p&lt;.005) were significantly correlated with deaths caused by Covid-19 pandemic used for data analysis. Social isolation rate (β = -.254;p&lt;.001) and daily record of new cases (β =.332;p&lt;.001), with adjusted R-squared of.623, were the predictors of deaths acummuled by Covid-19. The finding serves as an input to reduce the incidence rate of Covid-19 in Brazil. Statistical results show evidence of the relationship between climate elements and COVID-19 indicators, such as the number of deaths, spread of contamination and social isolation rate. The study of dimensions of climate as a seasonal pattern and its relationship to COVID-19 benefits epidemiological surveillance. The more geographic spaces are known, more will help to understand the differences in disease behavior in different places. The results of this research showed that environmental conditions influence the contagion and speed of transmission of Covid-19. Policies that contribute to benefits to health and sustainability need to be planned. The contribution of climate and other factors, such as air pollution, for example, require additional studies. Environmental changes, such as climate change and biodiversity, must also be investigated for their impact on human health. Acting in prevention, including the promotion of socially acceptable behaviors on the part of the population, seems to be the best way to deal with Covid-19. © 2021 Instituto de Geografia.

Consequently, it is important to explore physical therapists' referral practice patterns for surgical consult. Currently, physical therapist referral patterns for surgical consult in this patient population are unknown. OBJECTIVES: To describe physical therapist referral patterns for immediate neurosurgical consult in patients with foot drop due to suspected acute LDH with LR. DESIGN: Cross-sectional descriptive research design using an electronic, internet-based survey that utilized two clinical vignettes. METHOD: An electronic survey was developed by an expert peer review panel. Survey participants were licensed physical therapists in the United States and members of the Orthopedic Section of the American Physical Therapy Association. RESULTS: Of the individuals receiving the survey invitation, 2172 completed the survey. Depending on the severity of foot drop, 34-61% were likely to refer for immediate neurosurgical consult. Presence of imaging to confirm suspected clinical diagnosis slightly affected the likelihood of referral (4-12% increase) for immediate neurosurgical consult. CONCLUSION: In patients with foot drop due to suspected acute LDH with LR, this study found that physical therapist referral patterns for immediate neurosurgical consult varied and are likely influenced by the severity of weakness and availability of MRI findings. Further research regarding the optimal management of this patient population and potential reasons for variation in practice is warranted.","Wielechowski, Adam; Keil, Aaron; Hamstra-Wright, Karrie",J Man Manip Ther,46,27

This is most commonly performed on respiratory secretions obtained via a nasopharyngeal swab. Due to supply chain limitations and high demand worldwide because of the COVID-19 pandemic, access to commercial nasopharyngeal swabs has not been assured. 3D printing methods have been used to meet the shortfall. For longer-term considerations, 3D printing may not compare well with injection molding as a production method due to the challenging scalability and greater production costs of 3D printing. METHODS: To secure sufficient nasopharyngeal swab availability for our national healthcare system, we designed a novel injection molded nasopharyngeal swab (the IM2 swab). We performed a clinical diagnostic study comparing the IM2 swab to the Copan FLOQSwab. Forty patients with a known diagnosis of COVID-19 and 10 healthy controls were recruited. Paired nasopharyngeal swabs were obtained from the same nostril of each participant and tested for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR. RESULTS: When compared to the Copan FLOQswab, results from the IM2 swab displayed excellent overall agreement and positive percent agreement of 96.0% and 94.9%, respectively. There was no significant difference in mean RT-PCR cycle threshold values for the ORF1ab (28.05 vs. 28.03, p = 0.97) and E-gene (29.72 vs. 29.37, p = 0.64) targets, respectively. We did not observe any significant adverse events and there was no significant difference in patient-reported pain. CONCLUSION: In summary, the IM2 nasopharyngeal swab is a clinically safe, highly accurate option to commercial nasopharyngeal swabs.","Tay, Joshua K; Cross, Gail B; Sun, Louisa; Chia, Alfred; Chee, Jeremy; Loh, Jerold; Lim, Zhen Yu; Ngiam, Nicholas; Khang, Wen Pang; Yeap, Stephanie; Goh, Han Lee; Siow, Chor Hiang; Loh, Woei Shyang; Loh, Kwok Seng; Lee, Chun Kiat; Yan, Benedict; Chow, Vincent T K; Wang, De Yun; Boey, Freddy; Wong, John E L; Allen, David M",,46,24

COVID-19 is a novel coronavirus disease that has sparked a pandemic in March 2020 affecting over 110 countries. Although researchers have been racing to develop targeted anti-COVID-19 treatment and vaccine, they are still currently unavailable. Thus, in treating patients infected with COVID-19, western medicine mainly recommended symptomatic treatment and monitoring. Existing drugs are used in the context of clinical trials, and the FDA still not yet approved these drugs for COVID-19. On the other hand, TCM proposed herbal treatment for suspected individuals to take within their observation period, as well as for confirmed COVID-19 patients to take during active phase of disease and during recovery. In China, Integrative Chinese-Western Medicine had been used in treating 91.5% of COVID-19 patients and showed its strength in reducing disease severity, shortening recovery time, and lowering the mortality rate. Despite obstacles in globalizing TCM for the treatment of COVID-19, promoting appropriate use of locally registered TCM products may prevent disease in susceptible individuals, improve the quality of life, and assist in the recovery of COVID-19 patients. With increasing global acceptance, TCM may play a more important role in the battle against infectious disease in the future. &copy;2021 World Journal of Traditional Chinese Medicine ;Published by Wolters Kluwer .

Their incidence increases with age, and males are more often affected. First-line management includes maximum safe surgical resection followed by involved-field radiotherapy plus concomitant and six cycles of maintenance temozolomide chemotherapy. Standards of care at recurrence are much less well defined. Minorities of patients are offered second surgery or re-irradiation, but data on a positive impact on survival from randomized trials are lacking. The majority of patients who are eligible for salvage therapy receive systemic treatment, mostly with nitrosourea-based regimens or, depending on availability, bevacizumab alone or in various combinations. In clinical trials, lomustine alone has been increasingly used as a control arm, assigning this drug a standard-of-care position in the setting of recurrent glioblastoma. Here we review the activity of lomustine in the treatment of diffuse gliomas of adulthood in various settings. The most compelling data for lomustine stem from three randomized trials when lomustine was combined with procarbazine and vincristine as the PCV regimen in the newly diagnosed setting together with radiotherapy; improved survival with PCV was restricted to patients with isocitrate dehydrogenase-mutant tumors. No other agent with the possible exception of regorafenib has shown superior activity to lomustine in recurrent glioblastoma, but activity is largely restricted to patients with tumors with O6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation.

To date, the clinical characteristics of COVID-19-infected cancer patients remain largely unknown. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, we included cancer patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from three designated hospitals in Wuhan, China. Clinical data were collected from medical records from 13 January 2020 to 26 February 2020. Univariate and multivariate analyses were carried out to assess the risk factors associated with severe events defined as a condition requiring admission to an intensive care unit, the use of mechanical ventilation, or death. RESULTS: A total of 28 COVID-19-infected cancer patients were included; 17 (60.7%) patients were male. Median (interquartile range) age was 65.0 (56.0-70.0) years. Lung cancer was the most frequent cancer type (n = 7; 25.0%). Eight (28.6%) patients were suspected to have hospital-associated transmission. The following clinical features were shown in our cohort: fever (n = 23, 82.1%), dry cough (n = 22, 81%), and dyspnoea (n = 14, 50.0%), along with lymphopaenia (n = 23, 82.1%), high level of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (n = 23, 82.1%), anaemia (n = 21, 75.0%), and hypoproteinaemia (n = 25, 89.3%). The common chest computed tomography (CT) findings were ground-glass opacity (n = 21, 75.0%) and patchy consolidation (n = 13, 46.3%). A total of 15 (53.6%) patients had severe events and the mortality rate was 28.6%. If the last antitumour treatment was within 14 days, it significantly increased the risk of developing severe events [hazard ratio (HR) = 4.079, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.086-15.322, P = 0.037]. Furthermore, patchy consolidation on CT on admission was associated with a higher risk of developing severe events (HR = 5.438, 95% CI 1.498-19.748, P = 0.010). CONCLUSIONS: Cancer patients show deteriorating conditions and poor outcomes from the COVID-19 infection.

A dysregulated MYC oncogene has downstream effects on proliferation and highly glycolytic metabolism with tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediates as biosynthetic precursors. Devimistat is a non-redox active analogue of lipoic acid, a required cofactor for two key TCA cycle mitochondrial enzymes: pyruvate dehydrogenase and alpha ketoglutarate dehydrogenase. Disruption results in a shutdown of ATP and biosyntheticintermediate production leading to cancer cell death. In a phase I trial (n = 26) a pt with multiply refractory BL had a partial remission sustained over one year prior to resection. She remains in remission 7 years later. As of March 2021, 20 clinical studies in over 700 pts with various cancers have been conducted (ongoing/completed) with devimistat. We initiated a phase II trial to further explore efficacy. Methods: NCT03793140 is a multicenter study enrolling 17 patients on each of two cohorts BL or DHL/THL. Pts must have had one prior therapy or are refusing standard of care, measurable disease or isolated bone marrow involvement, and must not be within 3 months of a prior stem cell transplant. Active central nervous system (CNS) parenchymal disease is excluded, but leptomeningeal disease is allowed if the CSF is negative for more than 4 weeks and the maintenance intrathecal/intraOmmaya therapy is ongoing. Devimistat is given by central line over 2 hours daily x 5 days for two 14-day cycles and then as maintenance every 21 days. Pts are evaluable for response if they receive at least 4/5 days of the first cycle. At least 1response in the first 9 pts by cycle 3 was needed to expand to 17 pts in total in that cohort. Results: 9 pts were enrolled in the DHL/THL arm. Number of prior therapies was 3(1-6). No responses and only 1 stable disease resulted in cohort closure. Thus far, 8 BL pts were enrolled. Number of prior therapies was 3 (2-4). 2 pts were inevaluable. 1/6 pts had a response. This HIV+ pt had a thigh mass having received 4 prior therapies. He had a near complete metabolic remission after 3 cycles of devimistat. PET/CT assessment: Thigh lesion baseline October 19, 2020: 10.8 x 6.5 cm SUV 24. After cycle 3: unmeasurable, SUV 2. He is currently in cycle 7, having had a 4-week treatment delay of cycle 5 due to CoVID 19 infection. ECOG improved from 3 to 0. Adverse events (AE): As of March 03, 2021, no serious AEs related to study drug. 4 pts had grade 3 events at least possibly related: 2 neutropenia, 1 thrombocytopenia and 1 elevated bilirubin. 1 patient had a dose reduction for grade 2 alanine aminotransferase increase. Conclusions: Although our results are preliminary, the near complete remission in this patient is promising in a disease where no viable treatment options exist.","Nikolaenko, L.; Pardee, T.

DESIGN: Time series study of high income countries. SETTING: Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, England and Wales, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Israel, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Northern Ireland, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Scotland, Slovakia, Slovenia, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and United States. PARTICIPANTS: Mortality data from the Short-term Mortality Fluctuations data series of the Human Mortality Database for 2016-20, harmonised and disaggregated by age and sex. INTERVENTIONS: Covid-19 pandemic and associated policy measures. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Weekly excess deaths (observed deaths versus expected deaths predicted by model) in 2020, by sex and age (0-14, 15-64, 65-74, 75-84, and &#8805;85 years), estimated using an over-dispersed Poisson regression model that accounts for temporal trends and seasonal variability in mortality. RESULTS: An estimated 979 000 (95% confidence interval 954 000 to 1 001 000) excess deaths occurred in 2020 in the 29 high income countries analysed. All countries had excess deaths in 2020, except New Zealand, Norway, and Denmark. The five countries with the highest absolute number of excess deaths were the US (458 000, 454 000 to 461 000), Italy (89 100, 87 500 to 90 700), England and Wales (85 400, 83 900 to 86 800), Spain (84 100, 82 800 to 85 300), and Poland (60 100, 58 800 to 61 300). New Zealand had lower overall mortality than expected (-2500, -2900 to -2100). In many countries, the estimated number of excess deaths substantially exceeded the number of reported deaths from covid-19. The highest excess death rates (per 100 000) in men were in Lithuania (285, 259 to 311), Poland (191, 184 to 197), Spain (179, 174 to 184), Hungary (174, 161 to 188), and Italy (168, 163 to 173); the highest rates in women were in Lithuania (210, 185 to 234), Spain (180, 175 to 185), Hungary (169, 156 to 182), Slovenia (158, 132 to 184), and Belgium (151, 141 to 162). Little evidence was found of subsequent compensatory reductions following excess mortality. CONCLUSION: Approximately one million excess deaths occurred in 2020 in these 29 high income countries. Age standardised excess death rates were higher in men than women in almost all countries. Excess deaths substantially exceeded reported deaths from covid-19 in many countries, indicating that determining the full impact of the pandemic on mortality requires assessment of excess deaths.

AIM: To review whether prescribing for symptom control in patients dying with COVID-19 adhered to existing local guidance or whether there was deviation which may represent a need for revised guidance or specialist support in particular patient groups. DESIGN/SETTING: A retrospective review of the electronic patient record of 61 hospital inpatients referred to the specialist palliative care team with swab-confirmed COVID-19 who subsequently died over a 1-month period. Intubated patients were excluded. RESULTS: In all, 83% (40/48) of patients were prescribed opioids at a starting dose consistent with existing local guidelines. In seven of eight patients where higher doses were prescribed, this was on specialist palliative care team advice. Mean total opioid dose required in the last 24 h of life was 14 mg morphine subcutaneous equivalent, and mean total midazolam dose was 9.5 mg. For three patients in whom non-invasive ventilation was in place higher doses were used.

The impact of the pandemic and related public health interventions on specialized psychiatric emergency services has not been described. These services provide high-intensity care for severely ill patients who are likely to be homeless and underserved. OBJECTIVE: We describe the change in total volume and psychiatric hospitalization rates among three psychiatric emergency services across the United States. METHODS: Changes in volumes and hospitalization were assessed for statistical significance using a seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average with exogenous factors model from January 2018 to December 2020. RESULTS: The pandemic's impact on volumes and hospitalization varied by site. In Denver (CO), there was a statistically significant 9% decrease in overall volumes, although an 18% increase in hospitalizations was not significant. In New York City (NY), there was a significant 7% decrease in volumes as well as a significant 6% decrease in hospitalizations. In Portland (OR), volumes decreased by 4% and hospitalizations increased by 6% although differences did not reach statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS: There has been a decrease in volume at these services after the pandemic, but there are substantial variations in the magnitude of change and demand for hospitalization by region. These findings suggest a need to understand where patients in crisis are seeking care and how systems of care must adapt to changing utilization in the pandemic era.","Simpson, Scott A; Loh, Ryan M; Cabrera, Maximilliam; Cahn, Megan; Gross, Anne; Hadley, Allison; Lawrence, Ryan E",,46,16

The aim of the present study is to evaluate the epidemiology and clinical features of COVID-19 in adult coeliac patients regularly followed-up at our centre since January 2015. METHODS: Data about general health status and clinical features of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were prospectively collected over the phone. Data about CD were retrospectively collected from clinical notes. Prevalence and incidence of COVID-19 were compared between the coeliac cohort and the figures in the general population of Lombardy, Northern Italy between 20 February to 5 June 2020 provided by the Italian National Institute of Health (Istituto Superiore di Sanità) and the Lombardy regional government. RESULTS: Nine out of 324 patients contracted COVID-19, thus resulting in a prevalence of 2.78% [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.98-4.58] and an incidence rate of 8.15/1000 person-month (95% CI 4.24-15.66). Prevalence of COVID-19 ascertained by means of nasal swab was 1.79% (95% CI 0.22-3.35) and the incidence rate 5.26/1000 person-month (95% CI 2.19-12.63), without difference from the general population. Clinical type of CD, age, sex, duration and adherence to a gluten-free diet, and mucosal healing did not differ between coeliac patients with and without COVID-19.

Here, we present a stochastic model that examines this problem. In our model, people are allowed to move between discrete positions on a one-dimensional grid with viral infection possible when two people are collocated at the same site. Our model features three sets of adjustable parameters, which characterize (i) viral transmission, (ii) viral detection, and (iii) degree of personal mobility, and as such, it is able to provide a qualitative assessment of the potential for second-wave infection outbreaks based on the timing, extent, and pattern of the lockdown relaxation strategies. Our results suggest that a full lockdown will yield the lowest number of infections (as anticipated) but we also found that when personal mobility exceeded a critical level, infections increased, quickly reaching a plateau that depended solely on the population density. Confinement was not effective if not accompanied by a detection/quarantine capacity surpassing 40% of the symptomatic patients. Finally, taking action to ensure a viral transmission probability of less than 0.4, which, in real life, may mean actions such as social distancing or mask-wearing, could be as effective as a soft lockdown.","Ando, Shiho; Matsuzawa, Yuki; Tsurui, Hiromichi; Mizutani, Tetsuya; Hall, Damien; Kuroda, Yutaka",Sci Rep,46,1

Because coronavirus potentially diversifies by mutation, broadly neutralizing Abs are especially sought. Here, we report a possibly novel approach to rapid generation of potent broadly neutralizing human anti-SARS-CoV-2 Abs. We isolated SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-specific memory B cells by panning from the blood of convalescent subjects after infection with SARS-CoV-2 and sequenced and expressed Ig genes from individual B cells as human mAbs. All of 43 human mAbs generated in this way neutralized SARS-CoV-2. Eighteen of the forty-three human mAbs exhibited half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) of 6.7 × 10-12 M to 6.7 × 10-15 M for spike-pseudotyped virus. Seven of the human mAbs also neutralized (with IC50 < 6.7 × 10-12 M) viruses pseudotyped with mutant spike proteins (including receptor-binding domain mutants and the S1 C-terminal D614G mutant). Neutralization of the Wuhan Hu-1 founder strain and of some variants decreased when coding sequences were reverted to germline, suggesting that potency of neutralization was acquired by somatic hypermutation and selection of B cells. These results indicate that infection with SARS-CoV-2 evokes high-affinity B cell responses, some products of which are broadly neutralizing and others highly strain specific. We also identify variants that would potentially resist immunity evoked by infection with the Wuhan Hu-1 founder strain or by vaccines developed with products of that strain, suggesting evolutionary courses that SARS-CoV-2 could take.","de Mattos Barbosa, Mayara Garcia; Liu, Hui; Huynh, Daniel; Shelley, Greg; Keller, Evan T; Emmer, Brian T; Sherman, Emily; Ginsburg, David; Kennedy, Andrew A; Tai, Andrew W; Wobus, Christiane; Mirabeli, Carmen; Lanigan, Thomas M; Samaniego, Milagros; Meng, Wenzhao; Rosenfeld, Aaron M; Prak, Eline T Luning; Platt, Jeffrey L; Cascalho, Marilia",JCI insight,46,1

In this context, COVID vaccines were made available in an unprecedented time, but a high level of hesitance has been observed that can undermine community immunization. Traditionally, anti-vaccination attitudes are more related to conspiratorial thinking rather than political bias. In Brazil, a country with an exemplar tradition in large-scale vaccination programs, all COVID-related topics have also been discussed under a strong political bias. In this paper, we use a multidimensional analysis framework to understand if anti/pro-vaccination stances expressed by Brazilians in social media are influenced by political polarization. The analysis framework incorporates techniques to automatically infer from users their political orientation, topic modeling to discover their concerns, network analysis to characterize their social behavior, and the characterization of information sources and external influence. Our main findings confirm that anti/pro stances are biased by political polarization, right and left, respectively. While a significant proportion of pro-vaxxers display haste for an immunization program and criticize the government's actions, the anti-vaxxers distrust a vaccine developed in a record time. Anti-vaccination stance is also related to prejudice against China (anti-sinovaxxers), revealing conspiratorial theories related to communism.

As a consequence, home office (HO) and telepsychiatry boomed. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the potential of HO use, its adoption, and the association of HO use with employees' mental health in a large Psychiatric University Hospital in Switzerland. METHODS: Information about the implementation and use of HO were gathered by analyzing routine data and information provided by our IT services. Moreover, a cross-sectional online survey was conducted to assess the employees' attitudes towards the clinic's crisis management during the Covid-19 pandemic in early 2020. Part of this online survey consisted of questions about HO use in the period between March and June 2020, the employees' attitude towards HO implementation and their mental health. Three mental health measures assessed depressive symptoms (PHQ-2), anxiety (GAD-2) and stress factors (stress module of the PHQ-D). RESULTS: 69 of the 200 participating employees reported to work at least partially from home (34.5%). HO use differed significantly across the professional groups (Chi2(16) = 72.72, P = <.001, n = 200). Compared to the cut-off scores of &#8805; 3 for the PHQ-2 and the GAD-2, employees experienced no or mild depressive symptoms (M = 0.76, SD = 1.14) and anxiety (M = 0.70, SD = 1.03). The employees reported minor psychosocial stressors (M = 2.83, SD = 2.92). The number of reported stress factors varied significantly across the HO groups (Chi2(4) = 9.72, P = .04). CONCLUSIONS: HO appears to be generally feasible in large psychiatric hospitals. However, HO is not equally possible for all professional groups. Professional groups with personal contact to patients and technical or manual tasks have to work onsite. Further evaluation of HO use in psychiatric hospitals up to the development of virtual clinics will follow in future research. In conclusion, the worldwide pandemic served as a stepping stone that should be further used to promote HO use and to take full advantage of HO for employees as well as employers (e.g., to improve employees' work-life balance or to save costs).","Krückl, Jana Sophia; Moeller, Julian; Gaupp, Rainer; Meier, Christoph E; Roth, Carl Bénédict; Lang, Undine Emmi; Huber, Christian G",,46,30

In this paper we provide a framework for understanding the key challenges for psychologically informed mental health care during and beyond the pandemic. We identify three groups that can benefit from psychological approaches to mental health, and/or interventions relating to COVID-19. These are (i) healthcare workers engaged in frontline response to the pandemic and their patients; (ii) individuals who will experience the emergence of new mental health distress as a function of being diagnosed with COVID-19, or losing family and loved ones to the illness, or the psychological effects of prolonged social distancing; and (iii) individuals with existing mental health conditions who are either diagnosed with COVID-19 or whose experience of social distancing exacerbates existing vulnerabilities. Drawing on existing literature and our own experience of adapting treatments to the crisis we suggest a number of salient points to consider in identifying risks and offering support to all three groups. We also offer a number of practical and technical considerations for working psychotherapeutically with existing patients where COVID-19 restrictions have forced a move to online or technologically mediated delivery of psychological interventions.","Inchausti, Felix; MacBeth, Angus; Hasson-Ohayon, Ilanit; Dimaggio, Giancarlo",J Contemp Psychother,46,32

The virus, by inducing cell apoptosis and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, generates as cytokine storm, which is the major cause of mortality in the patients. This type of response, along with responses by other immune cell, such as alveolar macrophages and neutrophils causes extensive damage to infected tissue. Newly, a novel cell-based therapy by Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) as well as by their exosomes has been developed for treatment of COVID-19 that yielded promising outcomes.

During the Pleistocene, sea-level retreat caused by glaciations exposed the continental shelf, resulting in enlarged paleodrainages that connected rivers that are isolated today. Using Geographic Information System (GIS), we infer the distribution of these paleodrainages, and their properties for the east Brazilian coast. Specifically, using elevation/bathymetric data for the largest sea-level retreats during the Pleistocene, the paleodrainages, their area and the number of contemporary basins connected by each palaeodrainage, was inferred. For the 145 inferred paleodrainages, total paleodrainage area is strongly correlated with the contemporary area encompassed by each paleodrainage, as well as with the number of contemporary basins encompassed by a paleodrainage. Differences in the continental shelf exposure along the coast affected the degree of past connectivity among contemporary rivers. With our results freely available, we discuss how paleodrainages have tremendous utility in biological studies, especially in regions with limited geologic data. With respect to the diverse ichthyofauna of the Brazilian coast, and its high endemism, we highlight how the inferred paleodrainages provide a backdrop to test hypotheses about the effect of past riverine connectivity on diversity patterns.(AU)","Thomaz, Andréa T; Knowles, L.

In 2020, beach going was affected worldwide by the Covid-19 pandemic, but how did the pandemic affect recreational beach use on the Amazon coast in the Brazilian state of Pará? Given this, the objective of this work is to identify public perception in compliance with health safety established by authorities due to COVID-19 pandemic in two popular beaches on the Brazilian Amazon. Recreational patterns on the beaches of this region were analyzed from the user's perspective in July, through semi-structured interviews and direct observations. Recreational activities were prohibited on the beaches located within protected areas. At other locations, however, including Ajuruteua and Atalaia, the beaches were reopened on July 1 st, and both sites received thousands of visitors in July, despite the fact that interviewees believed the pandemic to be dangerous, and considered the situation in Pará state to be at least as bad or worse than in previous months. Agglomerations were verified on both study beaches and social distancing and other protective measures were limited. The increase in the new cases recorded in August was due to the relaxation of restrictions on social, recreational, and economic activities by the local authorities in July 2020, including the reopening of public access to beaches. As Pará state has been hard-hit by the pandemic, prohibitions on recreational beach use should clearly not have been lifted during this period. A number of management measures were presented in this study. These measures should contribute to the prevention of the spread of the virus during the upcoming public holidays, as long as the pandemic continues.","Pereira, Luci Cajueiro Carneiro; de Sousa Felix, Rosigleyse Corrêa; Brito Dias, Ana Beatriz; Pessoa, Rubem Manoel Coelho; da Silva, Brenda Ribeiro Padilha; da Costa Baldez, Carlos Alessandro; da Costa, Rauquírio Marinho; da Silva, Taynara Sousa; da Silva Assis, Luciane Ferreira; Jimenez, José A",Ocean Coast Manag,46,29

However, it is easy to confuse COVID-19 with seasonal influenza in preliminary clinical diagnosis. In this study, the differences between influenza and COVID-19 in epidemiological features, clinical manifestations, comorbidities and pathogen biology were comprehensively compared and analyzed. SARS-CoV-2 causes a higher proportion of pneumonia (90.67 vs. 17.07%) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (12.00 vs. 0%) than influenza A virus. The proportion of leukopenia for influenza patients was 31.71% compared with 12.00% for COVID-19 patients (P = 0.0096). The creatinine and creatine kinase were significantly elevated when there were COVID-19 patients. The basic reproductive number (R0) for SARS-CoV-2 is 2.38 compared with 1.28 for seasonal influenza A virus. The mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 ranges from 1.12 × 10-3 to 6.25 × 10-3, while seasonal influenza virus has a lower evolutionary rate (0.60-2.00 × 10-6).

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, many operational changes were adopted in our ophthalmology clinic to enhance patient and provider safety, while maintaining necessary clinical operations. The aims of this study were two-fold: to evaluate how measures adopted during the pandemic period affected the performance of the retina clinic and patient satisfaction;and to build a model from lessons learned for regulating future clinic operational performance, when the number of patients and providers returns to pre-pandemic levels. Methods : Timestamps were extracted from the electronic medical records of in-person retina encounters from March 15 to May 15, 2020 and compared with the same period in 2019 to assess patient flow through the clinical encounter. Patient satisfaction was evaluated by Press Ganey patient experience surveys returned by randomly selected outpatients. A discrete-events simulation was designed to model the clinic with COVID-era restrictions to assess operational performance under conditions of increasing patient and provider volumes. Results : Retina clinic volume declined by 62% during the COVID-19 health emergency. Average check-in-to-technician time declined by 79%, total visit length declined by 46%, and time in the provider phase of care declined by 53%. Interestingly, patient satisfaction with access nearly doubled during the COVID-period compared with the prior year (p < 0.0001), while satisfaction with overall care and safety remained high during both periods. A model incorporating COVID-related changes demonstrated that wait time before rooming reached levels similar to the pre-COVID era by 30 patients per provider in a 1- provider model and 25 patients-per-provider in a 2-provider model (p < 0.001). Capacity to maintain distancing between patients was exceeded only in the two 2-provider model above 25 patients-per-provider. Conclusions : Clinic throughput was optimized in response to the COVID-19 health emergency. Modeling these clinic changes can help plan for eventual volume increases in the setting of limits imposed in the COVID- era. The changes implemented enhanced the delivery of eye care and improved patients' sense of wellbeing, thus potentially becoming a new standard of care.","Sethi, K.; Levine, E.; Roh, S.; Marx, J.

Nanomaterials can be effectively used to detect, capture/inactivate or inhibit coronavirus cell entry/replication in the human host cell, preventing infection. Their potential for nanovaccines, immunoengineering, diagnosis, repurposing medication, and disinfectant surfaces targeting the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is highlighted. In this systematic review the aim is to present an unbiased view of which and how nanomaterials can reduce the spread of COVID-19. Herein, the focus is on SARS-CoV-2, analyzing 46 articles retrieved before December 31, 2020. The interface between nanomaterials is described, and the main mechanisms to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and viral inactivation are also discussed. Nanocarbons, biopolymeric, copper, and silver nanoparticles are potential antiviral and virucidal agents toward self-cleaning and reusable filter media and surfaces (e.g., facial masks), drug administration, vaccines, and immunodiagnostic assays. Trends in toxicology research and safety tests can help fill the main gaps in the literature and overcome health surveillance's challenges. Phytochemicals delivery by nanocarriers also stand out as candidates to target and bio-friendly therapy. Nanocellulose might fill in the gaps.

The aim of this study was to develop and assess a set of vaccination belief scales in relation to COVID-19 vaccines. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted between July 2020 and January 2021 using a systematic random sampling of 425 adult outpatients at two hospitals in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. An instrument was designed based on the dimensional structure and wording of the health belief model (HBM), which was followed by the assessment of the instrument’s internal consistency and the construct validity. Results: The 15-item instrument showed the content validity index (CVI) of scales reached a value of 1.0. Exploratory factor analysis was performed on the first sample (n = 170) and extracted 12 out of 15 draft items in a four-factor model (threat of disease, perceived benefits, perceived barriers, and cues to action) that accounted for 68.3% of the total variance. Cronbach’s alpha coefficient of 0.765 showed as satisfactory. Following this, the confirmatory factor analysis in the remaining sample (n = 255) found a good fit between a four-factor model and a theoretical model of HBM with acceptable values of fit indices. Conclusion: Beliefs scales for COVID-19 vaccination have been determined to be valid and reliable. They can be a helpful instrument for health educators to use for assessing immunization beliefs of individuals and the public where there is the need to implement new vaccines, such as the COVID-19 vaccine, before they are used more widely across the community.","Huynh, Giao Han Thi Ngoc Nguyen Vien Truong Nguyen An Le Pham",Risk Management and Healthcare Policy,46,30

Our aim was to compare the lung involvement of the HT patients hospitalized for COVID-19 using ACEIs/ARBs with the patients taking other anti-HT medications. METHODS: : Patients who have a diagnosis of HT among the patients treated for laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 between 31 March 2020 and 28 May 2020 were included in the study. One hundred and twenty-four patients were divided into two as ACEIs/ARBs group (n = 75) and non-ACEIs/ARBs group (n = 49) according to the anti-HT drug used. The chest CT involvement areas of these two groups were evaluated quantitatively by two observers including all lobes, and total severity score (TSS) was calculated. These TSS values were compared between drug groups and clinical groups. RESULTS: In clinical classification; there were 4 (%3.2) asymptomatic, 5 (4.0%) mild type, 92 (74.1%) common type, 14 (11.3%) severe type, 9 (7.3%) critical type patients. ACEI/ARB group's TSS (mean±SD, 7.74 ± 3.54) was statistically higher than other anti-HT medication group (mean±SD, 4.40 ± 1.89) (p < .001). Likewise, severe-critical clinical type's TSS (mean±SD, 9.17 ± 3.44) was statistically higher than common type (mean±SD, 5.76 ± 3.07) (p < .001). Excellent agreement was established between the two blinded observers in the TSS measurements. CONCLUSIONS: Quantitative evaluation of CT and TSS score can give an idea about the clinical classification of the patient. TSS is higher in ACEI/ARB group than non-ACEIs/ARBs group.","Samanci, Cesur; Saylan, Bengu; Gulsen, Gokce; Akkaya, Yuksel; Yesildal, Melike; Akkaya Isik, Sinem; Ustabasioglu, Fethi Emre",Clin Exp Hypertens,46,33

Results of a multi-group analysis based on nationality, prior IVR experience, and/or length of work experience, to analyse the potential similarities and/or differences in perception and acceptance towards using IVR-based technology are also presented. The quantitative research data were gathered using an online questionnaire from 438 chemical operators and/or employees who either speak German, French, or English. Partial least squares structural equation modelling and multi-group analysis based on SmartPLS™ version 3 were used to carry out the path and multi-group analyses. The results show that the behavioural intention (BI) towards adoption of IVR was influenced by PE, EE, and HM for all abovementioned subpopulation. However, the relationship of SI to BI was not supported for respondents with prior IVR experience and for respondents coming from Western region. Although Henseler’s-based multi-group PLS analysis reveals that there was no significant difference between the group comparisons, it is still important to take into account these socio-demographic factors as there are definite group differences in terms of the ranking order of each construct for the IVR adoption intentions among each subpopulation.

The aims of our study were to investigate the changes of parameters (ALT, AST) in LI and determine the risk factors for LI in a cohort of 830 COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Demographic information, clinical features, and laboratory testing outcomes on admission were compared between patients with and without liver biochemistry abnormality (LBA). The same comparisons were performed between the LBA and LI groups. The updated RUCAM was used to determine the causality between drugs application and LI. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to explore the potential risk factors associated with LBA and LI. RESULTS: A total of 227 (27.3%) patients exhibited LBA and 32 (3.9%) patients were categorized as having LI based on the diagnostic criteria. 32.6% (74/227) of the LBA patients had RUCAM score >3, whereas the non-LBA patients had a slight lower at rate of 24.2% (146/603) (P = 0.047). Multivariable regression showed that a higher incidence of LBA was associated with hepatic hypoattenuation on computed tomography (CT) (odds ratio: 2.243, 95% confidence interval: 1.410–3.592, p = 0.001), lymphocyte proportion < 20% (2.088, 1.476–2.954, p < 0.001), C-reactive protein (CRP) > 1 mg/dL (2.650, 1.845–3.806, p < 0.001) and aspartate transaminase to alanine transaminase (AST/ALT) ratio > 1 (2.558, 1.820-3.596, p < 0.001).

Looking back in history, the motivation for construction and development of cities was to enhance disaster prevention capacity, while modern cities are built and developed to improve health and wellness for human beings. Each disaster would pose some new challenges to the urban planning and architectural design, such as COVID-19. Therefore, the dilemma of future multi disasters (e.g. epidemics) would lead to reflections on the revision or change of urban design regulations. For the post-epidemic era, a comprehensive and integrated prevention system should be established for multi urban disasters, which requires to be optimally formulated based on multiple objectives, i.e., on the equilibrium of disaster occurrence probability and stop loss cost. This will be realized thanks to the rapid development of digital alike advanced technologies. Thus, this paper aims to provide a reference for the prevention and control of future city epidemics and disasters in responding to strategies of urban planning and design by considering the reform of urban construction related regulations, further to facilitate creation of healthy and safe urban environments.","Wang, Jianguo",Sustain Cities Soc,46,1

PAI-1, t-PA and fibrinogen levels were significantly higher in the COVID-19 group. Increased levels of PAI-1 likely result in lower plasmin activity and hence decreased fibrinolysis. These observations provide a partial explanation for the fibrin-mediated increase in blood viscosity and hypercoagulability that has previously been observed in COVID-19.

Additional data were needed regarding the efficacy, immunogenicity, and safety of this vaccine in a larger population. METHODS: In this phase 3, randomized, observer-blinded, placebo-controlled trial conducted at 33 sites in the United Kingdom, we assigned adults between the ages of 18 and 84 years in a 1:1 ratio to receive two intramuscular 5-μg doses of NVX-CoV2373 or placebo administered 21 days apart. The primary efficacy end point was virologically confirmed mild, moderate, or severe SARS-CoV-2 infection with an onset at least 7 days after the second injection in participants who were serologically negative at baseline. RESULTS: A total of 15,187 participants underwent randomization, and 14,039 were included in the per-protocol efficacy population. Of the participants, 27.9% were 65 years of age or older, and 44.6% had coexisting illnesses. Infections were reported in 10 participants in the vaccine group and in 96 in the placebo group, with a symptom onset of at least 7 days after the second injection, for a vaccine efficacy of 89.7% (95% confidence interval [CI], 80.2 to 94.6). No hospitalizations or deaths were reported among the 10 cases in the vaccine group. Five cases of severe infection were reported, all of which were in the placebo group. A post hoc analysis showed an efficacy of 86.3% (95% CI, 71.3 to 93.5) against the B.1.1.7 (or alpha) variant and 96.4% (95% CI, 73.8 to 99.5) against non-B.1.1.7 variants. Reactogenicity was generally mild and transient. The incidence of serious adverse events was low and similar in the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: A two-dose regimen of the NVX-CoV2373 vaccine administered to adult participants conferred 89.7% protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection and showed high efficacy against the B.1.1.7 variant.

To investigate the infectious etiology of Kawasaki disease, we initiated a prospective case-control study to investigate possible links between common viral infections and Kawasaki disease. METHODS: We enrolled 226 children with KD and 226 age- and sex-matched healthy children from February 2004 to March 2010. Throat and nasopharyngeal swabs were taken for both viral isolation and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for various viruses. RESULTS: The mean age of the 226 KD cases was 2.07 years, and the male to female ratio was 1.43 (133 boys to 93 girls). Their mean fever duration was 7.5 days with a mean peak temperature of 39.7°C. In addition to the typical symptoms of fever, neck lymphadenopathy, lip fissure and/or strawberry tongue, skin rash, nonpurulent bulbar conjunctivitis, palm/sole erythema, and induration followed by periungual desquamation, these KD cases also exhibited cough (69%), rhinorrhea (58%), and diarrhea (45%). Cases of KD had a significantly higher positive rate of viral isolation in comparison with the control group (7.5% vs. 2.2%, p = 0.02).

However, such measures are complex when established borders are open yet politically contested, as for the border that divides the Republic of Ireland (ROI) from Northern Ireland (NI). Understanding how this border affected the everyday lives of both populations during the pandemic is important for informing the continued development of effective responses to COVID-19 and future health crises. OBJECTIVE: This multi-methods study aimed to explore public perspectives on how the ROI-NI border affected experiences of and responses to the ‘first wave’ of the pandemic. METHOD: The study collated data from focus groups (n = 8), news articles (n = 967), and Twitter posts (n = 356) on the island of Ireland, which mentioned the ROI-NI border in relation to COVID-19. Thematic analysis was used to explore the range of perspectives on the role played by the border during the early months of the pandemic. RESULTS: Analysis identified three themes: Cross-Border Interdependencies illustrated the complexity and challenges of living near the border; Interpretations of Cross-Border Policy Disparities showed that lay publics perceived NI and ROI policy approaches as discordant and politicised; and Responses to Cross-Border Policy Disparities revealed alternating calls to either strengthen border controls, or pursue a unified all-island approach. CONCLUSIONS: Results reveal clear public appetite for greater synchronisation of cross-border pandemic responses, emphasise the specific vulnerability of communities living near the border, and highlight the risk of long-term socio-political repercussions of border management decisions taken during the pandemic.

Although appropriate preventive measures are the most important interventions to prevent coronavirus infection among healthcare workers, they are also highly concerned about the consequences of the pandemic. The aim of this cross-sectional study was to assess preventive practices, perceived risk and worry about COVID-19 crisis among healthcare professionals at six public hospitals in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. A systematic random sampling technique was used to select 1,134 respondents (52.6% females). Data were collected between 9(th) and 20(th) June 2020 using self-administered questionnaires. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the data. A multiple linear regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with worry about COVID-19 crisis. The highest percentage of respondents were nurses (39.3%) and physicians (22.2%), followed by interns (10.8%) and midwives (10.3%). Wearing facemask (93%) and frequent hand washing (93%) were the commonly reported preventive practices. Perceived risk of becoming infected with coronavirus (88%) and the potential risk of infection to their family (91%) were very high. The mean (median) worry score about COVID-19 crisis was 2.37 (3.0), on 1 to 3 scale, with 1 (not worried) and 3 (highly worried). The majority worried a lot about the health system being overwhelmed by COVID-19 patients (92%), the health of their loved ones (90%) and losing someone due to COVID-19 (89%). Respondents who had previously provided clinical care to Ebola, SARS and cholera patients had significantly lower levels of worry about COVID-19 crisis than participants who had not (β = -1.38, P<0.001). Our findings reveal respondents’ widespread practice of preventive measures, highest levels of perceived risk and worry about the COVID-19 crisis. Increased perceived risk and worry about COVID-19 might enable healthcare workers to adopt appropriate preventive measures more effectively against the disease.","Deressa, Wakgari; Worku, Alemayehu; Abebe, Workeabeba; Gizaw, Muluken; Amogne, Wondwossen",PLoS One,46,22

Classes with multiheaded scopes are the most popular among pathology trainees. Until recently, it was difficult to us to imagine that this educational approach could change. In the beginning of March 2020 our country faced a serious challenge, which all of us now known as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The rules of social distancing and work from home were applied. These types of restrictions were implemented in almost all parts of our life including work and pathology education. Objective - To share our experience in the Department of Hematopathology at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center during COVID-19 pandemic. We describe our experience in modifying our approaches to education. We show how we overcame many obstacles to learning by building one of the largest virtual hematopathology educational platforms via Cisco WebEx and using social media, in particular Twitter. These tools facilitated the learning of hematopathology by medical students, pathology trainees, and practicing pathologists from all over the world. Data Sources - During the three months of the pandemic (April, May and June 2020), we evaluated the visitors' attendance to MD Anderson Cancer Center Hematopathology Virtual Educational Platform using data collected by Cisco WebEx website. For examination of the impact of the hematopathology community on Twitter on medical education the analytic metrics obtained from Symplur LLC (www.symplur.com, 04/27/2020) were used via its Symplur Signals program.

Twenty-five patients receiving BT therapy were surveyed using the structuralized questionnaire by Dressler and Adib Saberi, while the caregivers were assessed using the Caregiver Burden Scale. The lockdown delayed BT therapy by 9 ± 2.8 months. Around 44% of the selected patients noticed increased muscle cramps, 24% increased muscle pain, and 32% both of them. Due to the lockdown, the patient’s quality of life was reduced by 68.4 ± 21.1%. After the lockdown, 100% of patients perceived BT therapy as more important than before. Around 76% of the patients perceived the lockdown as inadequate and felt that their rights were not respected. The overall score of the Caregiver Burden Scale, as regarded before the lockdown, was 29.12 ± 11.63, while the overall score as regarded after the lockdown was 37.44 ± 14.85.

Methods We selected a panel of 14 expert endoscopists. We identified 41 common indications for advanced endoscopic procedures from the ASGE Appropriate Use of GI Endoscopy guidelines. Using a modified Delphi method, we first achieved consensus on patient-important outcome for each procedural indication. Panelists prioritized consensus patient-important outcome when categorizing each indication into one of the following 3 procedural time periods: (1) time-sensitive emergent (schedule within 1 week), (2) time-sensitive urgent (schedule within 1 to 8 weeks), and (3) non-time sensitive (defer for >8 weeks and then reassess the timing). Three anonymous rounds of voting were allowed before attempts at consensus were abandoned. Results All 14 invited experts agreed to participate in the study. The prespecified consensus threshold of 51% was achieved for assigning patient-important outcome/s to each advanced endoscopy indication. The prespecified consensus threshold of 66.7% was achieved for 40 out of 41 advanced endoscopy indications in stratifying them into 1 of 3 procedural time periods. For 12 out of 41 indications 100% consensus, and for 20 out of 41 indications 75% to 99% consensus was achieved. Conclusions By using a Modified Delphi method that prioritized patient-important outcomes, we developed consensus recommendations on procedural timing for common indications for advanced endoscopy. These recommendations and the structured decision framework provided by our study can inform decision-making as endoscopy services are reopened.","Sawhney, Mandeep S.; Bilal, Mohammad; Pohl, Heiko; Kushnir, Vladimir; Khashab, Mouen A.; Schulman, Allison R.; Berzin, Tyler M.; Chalal, Prabhleen; Muthusamy, V.

Until now, although the US has the most confirmed cases in the world and are still experiencing an increasing pandemic, several states insisted to re-open business activities and colleges while announced strict control measures. To provide a quantitative reference for official strategies, predicting the near future trend based on finer spatial resolution data and presumed scenarios are urgently needed. In this study, the first attempted COVID-19 case predicting model based on county-level demographic, environmental, and mobility data was constructed with multiple machine learning techniques and a hybrid framework. Different scenarios were also applied to selected metropolitan counties including New York City, Cook County in Illinois, Los Angeles County in California, and Miami-Dade County in Florida to assess the impact from lockdown, Phase I, and Phase III re-opening. Our results showed that, for selected counties, the mobility decreased substantially after the lockdown but kept increasing with an apparent weekly pattern, and the weekly pattern of mobility and infections implied high infections during the weekend. Meanwhile, our model was successfully built up, and the scenario assessment results indicated that, compared with Phase I re-opening, a 1-week and a 2-week lockdown could reduce 4%–29% and 15%–55% infections, respectively, in the future week, while 2-week Phase III re-opening could increase 16%–80% infections. We concluded that the mandatory orders in metropolitan counties such lockdown should last longer than one week, the effect could be observed. The impact of lockdown or re-opening was also county-dependent and varied with the local pandemic. In future works, we expect to involve a longer period of data, consider more county-dependent factors, and employ more sophisticated techniques to decrease the modeling uncertainty and apply it to counties nationally and other countries.","Kuo, Cheng-Pin; Fu, Joshua S.",Sci Total Environ,46,16

Hypertension (HT) and ischemic heart disease (IHD) are the leading causes of HF. In Suriname, South-America, data on HF burden are lacking. The aim of this Suriname Heart Failure I (SUHF–I) study, is to assess baseline characteristics of HF admitted patients in order to set up the prospective interventional SUHF-II study to longitudinally determine the effectiveness of a comprehensive HF management program in HF patients. METHODS: A cross-sectional analysis was conducted of Thorax Center Paramaribo (TCP) discharge data from January 2013-December 2015. The analysis included all admissions with primary or secondary discharge of HF ICD-10 codes I50-I50.9 and I11.0 and the following variables: patient demographics (age, sex, and ethnicity), # of readmissions, risk factors (RF) for HF: HT, diabetes mellitus (DM), smoking, and left ventricle (LV) function. T-tests were used to analyze continuous variables and Chi-square test for categorical variables. Differences were considered statistically significant when a p-value <0.05 is obtained. RESULTS: 895 patients (1:1 sex ratio) with either a primary (80%) or secondary HF diagnosis were admitted. Female patients were significantly older (66.2 ± 14.8 years, p < 0.01) at first admission compared to male patients (63.5 ± 13.7 years) and the majority of admissions were of Hindustani and Creole descent. HT, DM and smoking were highly prevalent respectively 62.6%, 38.9 and 17.3%. There were 379 readmissions (29.1%) and 7% of all admissions were readmissions within 30 days and 16% were readmissions for 31-365 day. IHD is more prevalent in patients from Asian descendant (52.2%) compared to African descendant (11.7%). Whereas, HT (39.3%) is more prevalent in African descendants compared to Asian descendants (12.7%). There were no statistically significant differences in age, sex, ethnicity, LV function and RFs between single admitted and readmitted patients. CONCLUSION: RF prevalence, ethnic differences and readmission rates in Surinamese HF patients are in line with reports from other Caribbean and Latin American countries. These results are the basis for the SUHF-II study which will aid in identifying the country specific and clinical factors for the successful development of a multidisciplinary HF management program.","Sairras, Shellice; Baldew, Se-Sergio; van der Hilst, Kwame; Shankar, Arti; Zijlmans, Wilco; Lichtveld, Maureen; Ferdinand, Keith",J Natl Med Assoc,46,9

Many hard-hit localities have witnessed a large influx of severe cases that strained existing hospitals. As COVID-19 spreads in India, it is essential to evaluate the country's capacity to treat severe cases. Methods We combined data on public and private sector hospitals in India to produce state level estimates of hospital beds, ICU beds, and mechanical ventilators. Based on the number of public sector hospitals from the 2019 National Health Profile (NHP) of India and the relative proportions of public and private health care facilities from the National Sample Survey (NSS) 75th round (2017-2018), we estimated capacity in each Indian state and union territory (UT). We assumed that 5% of all hospital beds were ICU beds and that 50% of ICU beds were equipped with ventilators. Results We estimated that India has approximately 1.9 million hospital beds, 95,000 ICU beds and 48,000 ventilators. Nationally, resources are concentrated in the private sector (hospital beds: 1,185,242 private vs 713,986 public; ICU beds: 59,262 private vs 35,699 public; ventilators: 29,631 private vs. 17,850 public). Our findings suggest substantial variation in available resources across states and UTs. Conclusion Some projections shave suggested a potential need for approximately 270,000 ICU beds in an optimistic scenario, over 2.8 times the estimated number of total available ICU beds in India. Additional resources will likely be required to accommodate patients with severe COVID-19 infections in India.","Kapoor, G.; Hauck, S.; Sriram, A.; Joshi, J.; Schueller, E.; Frost, I.; Balasubramanian, R.; Laxminarayan, R.; Nandi, A.",,46,33

This is particularly illustrated over the last 15 years by the emergence of two zoonotic CoVs, the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)- and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV. Due to their inherent genetic variability, it is inevitable that new cross-species transmission events of these enveloped, positive-stranded RNA viruses will occur. Research into these medical and veterinary important pathogens—sparked by the SARS and MERS outbreaks—revealed important principles of inter- and intraspecies tropism changes. The primary determinant of CoV tropism is the viral spike (S) entry protein. Trimers of the S glycoproteins on the virion surface accommodate binding to a cell surface receptor and fusion of the viral and cellular membrane. Recently, high-resolution structures of two CoV S proteins have been elucidated by single-particle cryo-electron microscopy. Using this new structural insight, we review the changes in the S protein that relate to changes in virus tropism. Different concepts underlie these tropism changes at the cellular, tissue, and host species level, including the promiscuity or adaptability of S proteins to orthologous receptors, alterations in the proteolytic cleavage activation as well as changes in the S protein metastability. A thorough understanding of the key role of the S protein in CoV entry is critical to further our understanding of virus cross-species transmission and pathogenesis and for development of intervention strategies.","Hulswit, R.J.G.; de Haan, C.A.M.; Bosch, B.-J.",Adv Virus Res,46,28

It critically reviews literature on the pandemic, working from home, and work in general, to examine lockdown‐related workplace disruptions in relation to the various forms of work that took place in the home prior to the pandemic. It argues that feminist economic geography provides a starting point for examinations of working from home during and after COVID‐19. This situates writing on social reproduction, and informal and unpaid work in the home, within the purview of our understanding of pandemic response. Following this review, the paper demonstrates this argument by interrogating Canada's “telework capacity” discourse and the decisions by white‐collar offices regarding the continuation and abatement of “digital by default” policies. The pandemic will radically shift our understanding of the meanings of both home and work, and this paper, through a critical review of key literature, suggests that feminist economic geography provides one starting point for theorizing the implications of that shift in the Canadian context.","Cockayne, Daniel",Can Geogr,46,4

Cancer patients represent a vulnerable population in this pandemic, with data suggesting a higher risk for severe events and unfavorable outcomes. Timely identification of COVID-19 in cancer patients has been thwarted by the lack of outpatient testing for SARS-CoV-2. Chest computed tomography (CT) plays a major role in the identification of COVID-19 pneumonia, with radiologic hallmarks including bilateral, peripheral ground-glass opacities (GGOs) and consolidation. Cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy (RT) commonly have daily cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) obtained for image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT), and such imaging frequently includes the chest. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the CBCTs of an initially asymptomatic patient undergoing IGRT for breast cancer, who developed COVID-19 symptoms during the second week of RT. Lung windows of daily CBCTs were reviewed with Diagnostic Radiology to survey for changes consistent with COVID-19. Diagnostic CTs obtained at the time of recovery were obtained and compared with the CBCTs. RESULTS: Five consecutive CBCTs were retrospectively reviewed. Bilateral, peripheral GGOs were noted on the 4(th) and 5(th) CBCTs in the two days prior to symptom onset. CBCT on the day of RT resumption demonstrated substantial worsening of the GGO compared with those obtained during the asymptomatic phase. Diagnostic CTs demonstrated bilateral, peripheral GGOs and mediastinal lymphadenopathy, findings suggesting COVID-19 pneumonitis. Repeat diagnostic CT three days later showed improved pulmonary findings and the patient resumed RT without incident. CONCLUSION: Familiarity with typical CT changes of COVID-19 pneumonitis may allow for early detection in cancer patients undergoing CBCT for RT treatment. Prompt review of the lung windows is recommended in order to identify such changes, with the hope that pre-symptomatic diagnosis leads to expedited patient management, improved outcomes, and a reduction of inadvertent COVID-19 dissemination.","Youssef, Irini; Donahue, Bernadine; Flyer, Mark; Thompson, Sharon; Huang, Alice; Gallant, Fleure",Adv Radiat Oncol,46,15

For this reason, we monitored the anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody response in infected patients. In order to assess the time of seroconversion, we used 151 samples from 30 COVID-19 inpatients and monitored the detection kinetics of anti-S1, anti-S2, anti-RBD and anti-N antibodies with in-house ELISAs. We observed that specific antibodies were detectable in all inpatients 2 weeks post-symptom onset and that the detection of the SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid and RBD was more sensitive than the detection of the S1 or S2 subunits. Using retroviral particles pseudotyped with the spike of the SARS-CoV-2, we also monitored the presence of neutralizing antibodies in these samples as well as 25 samples from asymptomatic individuals that were shown SARS-CoV-2 seropositive using commercial serological tests. Neutralizing antibodies reached a plateau 2 weeks post-symptom onset and then declined in the majority of inpatients but they were undetectable in 56% of asymptomatic patients. Our results indicate that the SARS-CoV-2 does not induce a prolonged neutralizing antibody response. They also suggest that induction of neutralizing antibodies is not the only strategy to adopt for the development of a vaccine. Finally, they imply that anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies should be titrated to optimize convalescent plasma therapy.","Brochot, Etienne; Demey, Baptiste; Touzé, Antoine; Belouzard, Sandrine; Dubuisson, Jean; Schmit, Jean-Luc; Duverlie, Gilles; Francois, Catherine; Castelain, Sandrine; Helle, Francois",Front Microbiol,46,11

By drawing on concepts and theories from epidemiology, this paper will suggest that MBE may not need to be universal and compulsory to be effective at significantly improving the collective moral standing of a human populace and reducing the threat of ultimate harm. It will identify similarities between the mechanisms that allow biological contagions (such as a virus) and behaviours (such as those concerned with ethical and unethical actions) to develop, spread, and be reinforced within a population. It will then go onto suggest that, just as with the epidemiological principle of herd immunity, if enough people underwent MBE to reach a minimum threshold then the incidence and spread of immoral behaviours could be significantly reduced, even in those who have not received MBE.","Gibson, R.

Progressive hypercapnic respiratory failure and ineffective airway clearance are key issues in this patient population. Often at the time of hospital presentation, patients are already supported by home mechanical ventilatory support with noninvasive ventilation (NIV) and an airway clearance regimen. Prognosis is poor once a patient develops acute respiratory failure requiring intubation and invasive mechanical ventilatory support, commonly leading to tracheostomy or palliative-focused care. We focus on this understudied group of patients with ALS without tracheostomy and incorporate existing data to propose a technical approach to the triage and management of acute respiratory failure, primarily for those who require intubation and mechanical ventilatory support for reversible causes, and also for progression of end-stage disease. Optimizing management in this setting improves both quality and quantity of life. Neuromuscular patients with acute respiratory failure require protocolized and personalized triage and treatment. Here, we describe the technical methods used at our single institution. The triage phase incorporates comprehensive evaluation for new etiologies of hypoxia and hypercapnia, which are not initially presumed to be secondary to progression or end-stage neuromuscular respiratory failure. In select patients, this may involve intubation or advanced adjustments of NIV machines. Next, once the acute etiology(s) is identified and treated, the focus shifts: training and use of mechanical airway clearance to optimize pulmonary function, facilitation of NIV wean or successful extubation to NIV, and transition to a stable regimen for home ventilation. The comprehensive protocol described here incorporates multi-institutional approaches and effectively optimizes acute respiratory failure in patients with neuromuscular pulmonary disease.","Murray, Nick M; Reimer, Richard J; Cao, Michelle",Cureus,46,16

However, the inability of antibodies like CR3022(5), which binds a cryptic spike epitope with nanomolar affinity(6), to neutralize virus, suggests a spike-based means of neutralization escape. Here, we show the SARS-CoV-2 spike to have 10% the unfolding enthalpy of a globular protein at physiological pH, where it is recognized by antibodies like CR3022, and up to 10-times more unfolding enthalpy at endosomal pH, where it sheds such antibodies, suggesting that the spike evades potentially neutralizing antibody through a pH-dependent mechanism of conformational masking. To understand the compatibility of this mechanism with ACE2-receptor interactions, we carried out binding measurements and determined cryo-EM structures of the spike recognizing up to three ACE2 molecules at both physiological and endosomal pH. In the absence of ACE2, cryo-EM analyses indicated lower pH to reduce conformational heterogeneity. Single-receptor binding domain (RBD)-up conformations dominated at pH 5.5, resolving into a locked all-down conformation at lower pH through lowering of RBD and refolding of a pH-dependent switch. Notably, the emerging Asp614Gly strain(7) partially destabilizes the switch that locks RBD down, thereby enhancing functional interactions with ACE2 while reducing evasion by conformational masking.","Zhou, Tongqing; Tsybovsky, Yaroslav; Olia, Adam S.; Gorman, Jason; Rapp, Micah A.; Cerutti, Gabriele; Katsamba, Phinikoula S.; Nazzari, Alexandra; Schön, Arne; Wang, Pengfei; Bimela, Jude; Shi, Wei; Teng, I-Ting; Zhang, Baoshan; Boyington, Jeffrey C.; Chuang, Gwo-Yu; Sampson, Jared M.; Sastry, Mallika; Stephens, Tyler; Stuckey, Jonathan; Wang, Shuishu; Friesner, Richard A.; Ho, David D.; Mascola, John R.; Shapiro, Lawrence; Kwong, Peter D.",bioRxiv,46,18

Historical trends in Quebec and implications for Canada,20.803774,0.5911165,2020-06-08,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes acute, highly transmissible respiratory infection in humans and a wide range of animal species. Its rapid global spread has resulted in a major public health emergency, necessitating commensurately rapid research to improve control strategies. In particular, the ability to effectively retrace transmission chains in outbreaks remains a major challenge, partly due to our limited understanding of the virus’ underlying evolutionary dynamics within and between hosts. We used high-throughput sequencing whole-genome data coupled with bottleneck analysis to retrace the pathways of viral transmission in two nosocomial outbreaks that were previously characterised by epidemiological and phylogenetic methods. Additionally, we assessed the mutational landscape, selection pressures, and diversity at the within-host level for both outbreaks. Our findings show evidence of within-host selection and transmission of variants between samples. Both bottleneck and diversity analyses highlight within-host and consensus-level variants shared by putative source-recipient pairs in both outbreaks, suggesting that certain within-host variants in these outbreaks may have been transmitted upon infection rather than arising de novo independently within multiple hosts. Overall, our findings demonstrate the utility of combining within-host diversity and bottleneck estimations for elucidating transmission events in SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks, provide insight into the maintenance of viral genetic diversity, provide a list of candidate targets of positive selection for further investigation, and demonstrate that within-host variants can be transferred between patients. Together these results will help in developing strategies to understand the nature of transmission events and curtail the spread of SARS-CoV-2.","San, James E; Ngcapu, Sinaye; Kanzi, Aquillah M; Tegally, Houriiyah; Fonseca, Vagner; Giandhari, Jennifer; Wilkinson, Eduan; Nelson, Chase W; Smidt, Werner; Kiran, Anmol M; Chimukangara, Benjamin; Pillay, Sureshnee; Singh, Lavanya; Fish, Maryam; Gazy, Inbal; Martin, Darren P; Khanyile, Khulekani; Lessells, Richard; de Oliveira, Tulio",Virus Evol,46,3

The World Health Organization has published guidelines for vaccine prioritisation, but most vaccine impact projections have focused on high-income countries, and few incorporate economic considerations. To address this evidence gap, we projected the health and economic impact of different vaccination scenarios in Sindh province, Pakistan (population: 48 million). Methods We fitted a compartmental transmission model to COVID-19 cases and deaths in Sindh from 30 April to 15 September 2020 using varying assumptions about the timing of the first case and the duration of infection-induced immunity. We then projected cases and deaths over 10 years under different vaccine scenarios. Finally, we combined these projections with a detailed economic model to estimate incremental costs (from healthcare and partial societal perspectives), disability adjusted life years (DALYs), and cost-effectiveness for each scenario. Findings A one-year vaccination campaign using an infection-blocking vaccine at $3/dose with 70% efficacy and 2.5 year duration of protection is projected to avert around 0.93 (95% Credible Interval: 0.91, 1.0) million cases, 7.3 (95% CrI: 7.2, 7.4) thousand deaths and 85.1 (95% CrI: 84.6, 86.8) thousand DALYs, and be net cost saving from the health system perspective. However, paying a high price for vaccination ($10/dose) may not be cost-effective. Vaccinating the older (65+) population first would prevent slightly more deaths and a similar number of cases as vaccinating everyone aged 15+ at the same time, at similar cost-effectiveness. Interpretation COVID-19 vaccination can have a considerable health impact, and is likely to be cost-effective if more optimistic vaccine scenarios apply. Preventing severe disease is an important contributor to this impact, but the advantage of focusing initially on older, high-risk populations may be smaller in generally younger populations where many people have already been infected, typical of many low- and -middle income countries, as long as vaccination gives good protection against infection as well as disease.","Pearson, C.

AIM: We explored the role of these interactions in the risk of disease transmission (foot‐and‐mouth disease [FMD]) between cattle and the African buffalo (the maintenance host) and how a top predator, the lion, may modulate these interactions. LOCATION: The interface of Hwange National Park (HNP) and surrounding communal lands, Zimbabwe. METHOD: We combined a longitudinal serological cattle survey for FMD, GPS‐collar data and cattle owners’ interviews during four seasons in 2010–2011. RESULTS: Overall FMD incidence in cattle was low, but showed a peak during the rainy season. The incidence dynamic was significantly explained by cattle incursion into the protected area (i.e., buffer zone of 3 km inside HNP) and not by contacts with buffalo or contacts among cattle. These results suggest that FMD virus either survives in the environment or is transmitted by other ungulate groups or species. The analysis of incursion frequency in the buffer suggests that (1) buffalo and cattle are avoiding each other up to 2 months after one species track and that (2) lions make frequent incursions in the buffer few days to few weeks after buffalo had used it, whereas buffalo did not use areas occupied by lions. Lions could thus reduce the spatio‐temporal overlap between cattle and buffalo in the interface, which could contribute to the low level of FMD incidence. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: During the rainy season, traditional herding practices push cattle away from growing crops near villages into the HNP but not during the dry season, suggesting that cattle owners may decide to rely on lower quality resources in the communal land in the dry season to avoid the risks of infection and/or predation in the HNP. This study highlights the complex dynamics that operates at human/livestock/wildlife interfaces.","Miguel, Eve; Grosbois, Vladimir; Fritz, Hervé; Caron, Alexandre; de Garine‐Wichatitsky, Michel; Nicod, Florian; Loveridge, Andrew J; Stapelkamp, Brent; Macdonald, David W.; Valeix, Marion",Divers Distrib,46,9

These studies suggest that these parameters could influence the transmission of SARS-CoV-2. In the present investigation, we sought to investigate the association between air pollution, meteorological data, and the Lombardy region COVID-19 outbreak caused by SARS-CoV-2. We considered the number of detected infected people at the regional and provincial scale from February to March 2020. Air pollution data were collected over the Lombardy region, nominally, sulphur dioxide, ammonia, nitrogen dioxide, nitrogen monoxide, carbon monoxide, ozone, and suspended particulate matter measuring less than 10 μm (PM10) and less than 2.5 μm (PM2.5). Meteorological data have been collected over the same region for temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed. In this work, we evaluated the combined impact of environmental pollutants and climate conditions on the COVID-19 outbreak. The analysis evidenced a positive correlation between spatial distribution of COVID-19 infection cases with high concentrations of suspended particulate matter and a negative relationship with ozone. Moreover, suspended particulate matter concentration peaks in February correlated positively with infection peaks according to the virus incubation period. The obtained results suggested that seasonal weather conditions and concentration of air pollutants seemed to influence COVID-19 epidemics in Lombardy region.","Dragone, Roberto; Licciardi, Giorgio; Grasso, Gerardo; Del Gaudio, Costantino; Chanussot, Jocelyn",Int J Environ Res Public Health,46,1

METHODS: The charts of 90 patients from a single institution were reviewed. Of these patients, 45 visited the virtual clinic during the COVID-19 pandemic. The other 45 patients visited the clinic in the 3 months prior to COVID-19. Demographics including the mean age at the visit, chief complaint, visit diagnosis, appointment duration, helmet usage, accuracy of the diagnosis, need for a CT scan, and the need for a follow-up appointment were assessed. Diagnostic accuracy, the frequency of follow-up appointments, and patient satisfaction (via survey), as well as additional associated factors, were analyzed to determine the efficacy and satisfaction associated with the virtual clinic approach. RESULTS: The mean patient age at time of the visit was 5.6 and 7.3 months (p = 0.244), and the mean time from referral to appointment was 19.2 and 19 days (p = 0.934), in the in-person and virtual cohorts, respectively. There was no significant difference in the variety of chief complaints between the in-person and virtual visits, with 97.8% and 93.3% of patients' parents reporting abnormal head shape, respectively, and the remainder reporting more infrequent complaints (p = 0.435). The visit diagnosis was plagiocephaly in 93.3% of the in-person cohort and 80.0% of the virtual cohort (p = 0.118). The final diagnosis exhibited a similar pattern, with 95.6% of the in-person cohort and 88.9% of the virtual cohort observed as positional plagiocephaly; the remaining diagnoses were more infrequent (p = 0.434). The most common alternative diagnosis in the virtual visit cohort was a metopic ridge (8.4%). In the in-person visit cohort, the most common alternative diagnosis was equally a benign enlargement of the subarachnoid space in infancy, scalp mass, and skull lesion (2.2% each). None of the patients in either cohort were diagnosed with synostosis. Eighty percent of the in-person visits were 15 to 30 minutes in duration, with the remaining 20% being 31 minutes or longer; virtual visits were all 30 minutes or less, with 95.6% being 15 to 30 minutes (p = 0.002). Helmets were prescribed for 2 patients in the in-person cohort and no patients in the virtual cohort (p = 0.494). Alterations in diagnosis were made in 2.2% of in-person visits and 6.7% of virtual visits (p = 0.616). Follow-up was required in 15.6% of the in-person visits and 31.1% of the virtual visits (p = 0.134). CT was only utilized twice, once in the in-person visit cohort and once in the virtual visit cohort. CONCLUSIONS: Virtual clinic encounters resulted in comparable diagnostic accuracy. The trend toward frequent follow-up assessments and changes in the final diagnosis in the virtual clinic cohort has indicated a level of diagnostic uncertainty via the virtual interface, which required in-person assessment for confirmation. This finding did not contribute toward diagnostic inaccuracy with respect to missed synostosis. The study results have indicated that telemedicine can be an effective modality in assessing craniofacial pathology.","Marianayagam, Neelan J; Premaratne, Ishani D; Buontempo, Michelle M; Villamater, Francis N; Souweidane, Mark M; Hoffman, Caitlin E",J Neurosurg Pediatr,46,11

METHODS: During March–August 2020, approximately ≥1000 serum specimens were collected monthly from each region and tested for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies using a well-validated algorithm. Regional seroprevalence estimates were weighted based on demographic differences compared with the general population. Seroprevalence was compared with reported coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) case rates over time. RESULTS: For all regions, seroprevalence was <1.0% in March 2020. New York, New York, experienced the biggest increase (peak seroprevalence, 15.8% in May). All other regions experienced modest increases in seroprevalence (1%–2% in May–June to 2%–4% in July–August). Seroprevalence was higher in younger, non-Hispanic black, and Hispanic donors. Temporal increases in donor seroprevalence correlated with reported case rates in each region. In August, 1.3–5.6 estimated cumulative infections (based on seroprevalence data) per COVID-19 case were reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. CONCLUSIONS: Increases in seroprevalence were found in all regions, with the largest increase in New York. Seroprevalence was higher in non-Hispanic black and Hispanic than in non-Hispanic white blood donors. SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing of blood donor samples can be used to estimate the seroprevalence in the general population by region and demographic group.

It had an impact on the well-being and mental health of lecturers, increasing burnout risk. A cross-sectional, quantitative, qualitative and analytical online study was conducted to collect participants’ sociodemographic data, responses to ERT open-ended questions and mental health assessments using relevant instruments (CBI for burnout, Resilience Scale, DASS for depression, anxiety and stress, SWLS for satisfaction with life). High personal burnout levels were found in 41.2% of participants, high work-related burnout in 37.3% and high student-related burnout in 15.7%. Satisfaction with life, sleep routine changes and stress were determinants for personal burnout; stress and resilience for work-related burnout; satisfaction of life and sleep routine changes for students-related burnout. Opportunities for pedagogical innovation were pointed out as the main advantages to ERT, while the main negative impacts were on practical lessons and social interaction. Students and lecturers’ safety and adequate institutional support might be insured, considering their expectations and needs, promoting mental health.

METHODS: Thirty-five patients were treated at the 12 de Octubre University Hospital in Madrid between 1 March 2020 and 24 April 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic. Patient demographics, surgical procedures, complications, COVID-19 symptoms and outcomes were recorded. A protocol was introduced to reduce the risk of operating on patients with COVID-19, including symptom screening, a polymerase chain reaction test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and computed tomography scans of the chest. Surgical activity changed significantly during this time, from an initial period of near-normal activity, through an emergency-only period and finally a recovery period when some oncological surgical cases were restarted. Selection criteria for surgical patients are also described. RESULTS: A total of 34 patients underwent surgery during the pandemic period. We performed 22 lung resections (11 lobectomies and 11 sublobar resections). No hospital deaths were recorded. An elective surgery patient and an emergency surgery patient were diagnosed with COVID-19 (5.88%). The former died within 30 days after surgery.

The primary aim of this review was to establish the incidence and timing of positive faecal samples for SARS‐CoV‐2 in patients with COVID‐19. METHODS: A systematic literature review identified studies describing COVID‐19 patients tested for faecal virus. Search terms for MEDLINE included ‘clinical’, ‘faeces’, ‘gastrointestinal secretions’, ‘stool’, ‘COVID‐19’, ‘SARS‐CoV‐2’ and ‘2019‐nCoV’. Additional searches were done in the American Journal of Gastroenterology, Gastroenterology, Gut, Lancet Gastroenterology and Hepatology, the World Health Organization Database, the Centre for Evidence‐Based Medicine, New England Journal of Medicine, social media and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, bioRxiv and medRxiv preprints. Data were extracted concerning the type of test, number and timing of positive samples, incidence of positive faecal tests after negative nasopharyngeal swabs and evidence of viable faecal virus or faeco‐oral transmission of the virus. RESULTS: Twenty‐six relevant articles were identified. Combining study results demonstrated that 53.9% of those tested for faecal RNA were positive. The duration of faecal viral shedding ranged from 1 to 33 days after a negative nasopharyngeal swab with one result remaining positive 47 days after onset of symptoms. There is insufficient evidence to suggest that COVID‐19 is transmitted via faecally shed virus. CONCLUSION: There is a high rate of positive polymerase chain reaction tests with persistence of SARS‐CoV‐2 in faecal samples of patients with COVID‐19. Further research is needed to confirm if this virus is viable and the degree of transmission through the faeco‐oral route. This may have important implications on isolation, recommended precautions and protective equipment for interventional procedures involving the gastrointestinal tract.","Gupta, S.; Parker, J.; Smits, S.; Underwood, J.; Dolwani, S.",Colorectal Dis,46,1

Three out of eight inoculated cats developed neurological signs and non-suppurative encephalitis; all three recovered from the acute stage of disease. Sero-conversion and the development of neutralizing antibodies occurred in all of the virus-inoculated cats. In addition, cats inoculated with feline BDV showed an early peripheral T cell response not present in cats inoculated with BDV strain V, suggesting that the feline virus exerted a more vigorous effect on the immune system. Using immunohistochemistry and a reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assay, BDV-specific antigen and nucleic acid could be demonstrated in brain samples from each cat with encephalitis, showing that incomplete viral clearance was probably responsible for the maintenance of inflammation. The successful induction of neurological signs and encephalitis in one cat infected with feline BDV, together with the detection of BDV-specific antigen and nucleic acid in the brain, provides strong evidence for the notion that BDV is the etiological agent behind feline SD.","Lundgren, A.-L.; Johannisson, A.; Zimmermann, W.; Bode, L.; Rozell, B.; Muluneh, A.; Lindberg, R.; Ludwig, H.",Acta Neuropathol,46,28

STUDY DESIGN: Designed in conjunction with the local arts centre and the psychology team at the University of Dundee, the art boxes were a response to planned face-to-face art interventions with families being cancelled due to COVID-19 restrictions. The aim of the art boxes is to encourage parents to make art together with their infants, fostering connection through playful, creative shared experiences. This research is currently being expanded to reach out to new families through referrals from health visitors, family nurses, and charity partners. METHODS: Data is being collected on how the art boxes are experienced by families using a mixed-methods approach. Families complete feedback cards (online, or using the stamped addressed card included in the box) rating their experience on quantitative scales and providing open comments. Visual data are gathered through parents sharing images with us on social media. An initial sample of 10 participants has been interviewed using semistructured interviews, allowing more in-depth qualitative understanding of their experiences. These preliminary findings are discussed here. RESULTS: The thematic analysis of initial interviews provided a rich picture of the disconnection families experienced during lockdown, why art boxes may be beneficial to parental well-being, and the mechanisms by which the boxes may help to develop connections for the parent and infant together. CONCLUSIONS: Preliminary findings show parents reporting feeling more confident and undertaking new activities which they plan to continue. This was of particular importance during lockdown where parents report opportunities for different experiences being more limited. Parent’s describe positive playful interactions and reported improvements to their own well-being from doing creative activities together with their child. Analysis of these initial interviews gives a framework of barriers and supports to connection which highlights how art boxes can facilitate connectedness between dyads with the potential to strengthen attachments.","Armstrong, V.G.; Ross, J.",Public Health,46,20

The social meanings attached to masks may influence their use, but remain underinvestigated. METHODS: We systematically searched eight databases for studies containing qualitative data on public mask use during past epidemics, and used meta-ethnography to explore their social meanings. We compared key concepts within and across studies, then jointly wrote a critical synthesis. RESULTS: We found nine studies from China (n=5), Japan (n=1), Mexico (n=1), South Africa (n=1) and the USA (n=1). All studies describing routine mask use during epidemics were from East Asia. Participants identified masks as symbols of solidarity, civic responsibility and an allegiance to science. This effect was amplified by heightened risk perception (eg, during SARS in 2003), and by seeing masks on political leaders and in outdoor public spaces. Masks also acted as containment devices to manage threats to identity at personal and collective levels. In China and Japan, public and corporate campaigns framed routine mask use as individual responsibility for disease prevention in return for state- or corporate-sponsored healthcare access. In most studies, mask use waned as risk perception fell. In contexts where masks were mostly worn by patients with specific diseases (eg, for patients with tuberculosis in South Africa), or when trust in government was low (eg, during H1N1 in Mexico), participants described masks as stigmatising, uncomfortable or oppressive. CONCLUSION: Face masks can take on positive social meanings linked to solidarity and altruism during epidemics. Unfortunately, these positive meanings can fail to take hold when risk perception falls, rules are seen as complex or unfair, and trust in government is low. At such times, ensuring continued use is likely to require additional efforts to promote locally appropriate positive social meanings, simplifying rules for use and ensuring fair enforcement.","Tsang, Po Man; Prost, Audrey",BMJ Glob Health,46,31

DATA SOURCES: Electronic databases (Cochrane, PubMed, EMBASE, MEDLINE, Scopus, and ClinicalTrials.gov) were searched for studies comparing surgical excision alone to surgical excision with adjuvant HPV vaccination for CIN 2 or greater. Studies published from January 1990 to January 2019 were included. METHODS: A total of 5,901 studies were reviewed. The primary outcomes evaluated included: recurrence of CIN 2 or greater, CIN 1 or greater, and HPV 16,18 associated CIN within 6-48 months. We used Covidence software to assist with screening, and meta-analysis was performed using Review Manager. TABULATION, INTEGRATION, AND RESULTS: Six studies met inclusion criteria and were included in the final analysis. In total 2,984 women were included; 1,360 (45.6%) received adjuvant HPV vaccination after surgical excision, and 1,624 (54.4%) received either placebo or surgical management alone for CIN 2 or greater. Recurrence of CIN 2 or greater occurred within 6-48 months in 115 women (3.9%) overall; however, recurrence was significantly lower for vaccinated women: 26 of 1,360 women (1.9%) vs 89 of 1,624 unvaccinated women (5.9%) (relative risk [RR] 0.36 95% CI 0.23-0.55). The risk of CIN 1 or greater was also significantly lower with adjuvant HPV vaccination, occurring in 86 of 1,360 vaccinated women (6.3%) vs 157 of 1,624 unvaccinated women (9.7%) (RR 0.67 95% CI 0.52-0.85). Thirty-five women developed recurrent CIN 2 or greater lesions specific to HPV 16,18; nine received adjuvant vaccination (0.9%) vs 26 who were unvaccinated (2.0%) (RR 0.41 95% CI 0.20-0.85). CONCLUSION: Adjuvant HPV vaccination in the setting of surgical excision for CIN 2 or greater is associated with a reduced risk of recurrent cervical dysplasia overall and a reduction in the risk of recurrent lesions caused by the most oncogenic strains (HPV 16,18). Human papillomavirus vaccination should therefore be considered for adjuvant treatment in patients undergoing surgical excision for CIN 2 or greater.

The results of testing in the microbiology laboratory have significant effects on the cost of clinical care, especially costs related to antimicrobial agents and infection control practices. Consequently many of the successful utilization management interventions described in clinical microbiology have targeted not just the volume of tests performed in the laboratory, but also the downstream costs of care.

(2017), this article argues that nuclear waste management is a real-world experiment. Based on this first assumption, we examine how radioactive waste management (RWM) organizations conceive or organize their experiments. Through three illustrative case studies in France, Belgium and Canada, we highlight how the RWM organizations obliged to participate in complex networks and unable to completely control the experimental process, adopt two different attitudes: an “open” or “closed” experimental mindset. We argue that these mindsets provide different answers to the questions: which main variables to focus on, how and who should design them, how to deal with conflicts and unexpected events, what are the justifications for participation and expert analysis, and what are the expected outputs and outcomes. The findings underline that although some RWM organizations have -at least since the participatory turn- had some ‘open’ mindset moments in some cases, they quickly revert to a closed mindset. We conclude by emphasizing the need for practitioners and scholars to further examine and evaluate the virtues of the open mindset when the experimenter assumes the program has a real-world experimental status. This status recognizes the limits of control over experimental conditions, allows for more substantial moral considerations when making technical choices before wider audiences and allows for collective sharing of responsibility, knowledge production and trade-offs over such a long-term and controversial program.","Parotte, Céline",Energy Res Soc Sci,46,8

This provides a natural experiment to determine whether the percentage of community masking was associated with decreases in emergency department (ED) visits due to non-COVID viral illnesses (NCVI) and related respiratory conditions. Methods: Observational study of ED encounters in a 11-hospital system in BLINDED during 2019-2020. Year-on-year ratios for all complaints were calculated to account for ‘lockdowns’ and the global drop in ED visits due to the pandemic. Encounters for specific complaints were identified using the International Classification of Diseases, version 10. Encounters with a positive COVID test were excluded. Linear regression was used to determine the association of publicly available masking data with ED visits for NCVI and exacerbations of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), after adjusting for patient age, sex, and medical history. Results: There were 285,967 and 252,598 ED visits across the hospital system in 2019 and 2020, respectively. There was a trend towards an association between the year-on-year ratio for all ED visits and the BLINDED stay-at-home order (parameter estimate=-0.0804, p=0.10). A 10% percent increase in the prevalence of community masking was associated with a 17.0%, 8.8%, and 9.4% decrease in ED visits for non-COVID viral illness and exacerbations of asthma exacerbations and COPD, respectively (p<0.001 for all). Conclusions: These findings may be valuable for future public health responses, particularly in future pandemics with respiratory transmission or in severe influenza seasons.","Dezman, Zachary D.W.; Stryckman, Benoit; Zachrison, Kori S.; Conrad, Ryan M.; Marcozzi, David; Pimentel, Laura; Samuels-Kalow, Margaret; Cairns, Charles B.",Am J Med,46,20

Despite evidence of detrimental effects for adults, there has been limited examination of the impact of COVID-19 on parents and children specifically. We aim to examine patterns of parent and child (0–18 years) mental health, parent substance use, couple conflict, parenting practices, and family functioning during COVID-19, compared to pre-pandemic data, and to identify families most at risk of poor outcomes according to pre-existing demographic and individual factors, and COVID-19 stressors. Participants were Australian mothers (81%) and fathers aged 18 years and over who were parents of a child 0–18 years (N = 2365). Parents completed an online self-report survey during ‘stage three’ COVID-19 restrictions in April 2020. Data were compared to pre-pandemic data from four Australian population-based cohorts. Compared to pre-pandemic estimates, during the pandemic period parents reported higher rates of parent depression, anxiety, and stress (Cohen’s d = 0.26–0.81, all p < 0.001), higher parenting irritability (d = 0.17–0.46, all p < 0.001), lower family positive expressiveness (d = − 0.18, p < 0.001), and higher alcohol consumption (22% vs 12% drinking four or more days per week, p < 0.001). In multivariable analyses, we consistently found that younger parent age, increased financial deprivation, pre-existing parent and child physical and mental health conditions, COVID-19 psychological and environmental stressors, and housing dissatisfaction were associated with worse parent and child functioning and more strained family relationships. Our data suggest wide-ranging, detrimental family impacts associated with the COVID-19 pandemic; and support policy actions to assist families with financial supports, leave entitlements, and social housing.

Measuring student engagement is a crucial step towards smart online learning systems. A smart online learning system can automatically adapt to learners’ emotions and provide feedback about their motivations. In the last few decades, online learning environments have generated tremendous interest among researchers in computer-based education. The challenge that researchers face is how to measure student engagement based on their emotions. There has been an increasing interest towards computer vision and camera-based solutions as technology that overcomes the limits of both human observations and expensive equipment used to measure student engagement. Several solutions have been proposed to measure student engagement, but few are behavior-based approaches. In response to these issues, in this paper, we propose a new automatic multimodal approach to measure student engagement levels in real time. Thus, to offer robust and accurate student engagement measures, we combine and analyze three modalities representing students’ behaviors: emotions from facial expressions, keyboard keystrokes, and mouse movements. Such a solution operates in real time while providing the exact level of engagement and using the least expensive equipment possible. We validate the proposed multimodal approach through three main experiments, namely single, dual, and multimodal research modalities in novel engagement datasets. In fact, we build new and realistic student engagement datasets to validate our contributions. We record the highest accuracy value (95.23%) for the multimodal approach and the lowest value of “0.04” for mean square error (MSE).","Altuwairqi, Khawlah; Jarraya, Salma Kammoun; Allinjawi, Arwa; Hammami, Mohamed",Signal Image Video Process,46,18

In this paper, we present a distinct way forward for research on low sexual desire in women partnered with men that attends to a more structural explanation: heteronormativity. A heteronormative worldview assumes that relationships and structures are heterosexual, gender (usually conflated with sex) is binary and complementary, and gender roles fit within narrow bounds including nurturant labor for women. We propose the heteronormativity theory of low sexual desire in women partnered with men, arguing that heteronormative gender inequities are contributing factors. We outline four hypotheses and their predictions related to: inequitable divisions of household labor, blurring of partner and mother roles, objectification of women, and gender norms surrounding sexual initiation. We discuss some mechanisms—social, physiological, and otherwise—for the heteronormativity theory, especially related to stress, objectification, and nurturance. We close by noting some limitations of our paper and the ways that the heteronormativity theory of low sexual desire in women partnered with men provides a rigorous, generative, and empirical way forward.","van Anders, Sari M.; Herbenick, Debby; Brotto, Lori A.; Harris, Emily A.; Chadwick, Sara B.",Arch Sex Behav,46,20

METHODS: We analyzed all-cause visits at a tertiary university emergency department and admissions for ACS and ACVE before (calendar weeks 1–9, 2020) and after (calendar weeks 10–16, 2020) the first coronavirus disease (COVID-19) case in the region of the Saarland, Germany. The data were compared with the same period of the previous year. RESULTS: In 2020 an average of 346 patients per week presented at the emergency department whereas in 2019 an average of 400 patients presented up to calendar week 16 (p = 0.018; whole year 2019 = 395 patients per week).

Notably, patients with COVID-19 and comorbidities such as hypertension and cardiac diseases have a higher mortality rate. An efficient strategy in response to this issue is repurposing drugs with antiviral activity for therapeutic effect. Digoxin (DIG) and ouabain (OUA) are FDA drugs for heart diseases that have antiviral activity against several coronaviruses. Thus, we aimed to assess antiviral activity of DIG and OUA against SARS-CoV-2 infection. The half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC(50)) of DIG and OUA were determined at a nanomolar concentration. Progeny virus titers of single-dose treatment of DIG, OUA and remdesivir were approximately 10(3)-, 10(4)- and 10(3)-fold lower (> 99% inhibition), respectively, than that of non-treated control or chloroquine at 48 h post-infection (hpi). Furthermore, therapeutic treatment with DIG and OUA inhibited over 99% of SARS-CoV-2 replication, leading to viral inhibition at the post entry stage of the viral life cycle. Collectively, these results suggest that DIG and OUA may be an alternative treatment for COVID-19, with potential additional therapeutic effects for patients with cardiovascular disease.","Cho, Junhyung; Lee, Young Jae; Kim, Je Hyoung; Kim, Sang il; Kim, Sung Soon; Choi, Byeong-Sun; Choi, Jang-Hoon",Sci Rep,46,5

In this ecological study, the focus was put on the relationship between COVID-19 mortality and both air quality and socioeconomic status at the district level in Istanbul. The mortality variables of the study are the excess deaths due to the pandemic, the proportion of deaths due to the pandemic among all deaths, COVID-19 mortality rate (per 100,000), and the proportion of COVID-19 deaths among older people (above the age of 65). The daily air quality measurements of PM(10), SO(2), NO(2), and NO(x) of the pre-pandemic term were included in the research to avoid bias due to decreasing traffic burden during the pandemic. Partial correlation was applied to analyze the relationship between air quality and mortality measures by controlling socioeconomic status, the percentage of the older population, and household size. Every 20% deterioration in the SES stratum has contributed to a 4% increase in excess mortality at the district level. The elderly population ratio of over 10% in the districts was found to increase the COVID-19 deaths in the total population by 35% and the deaths in the population over 65 years old by 3%. Average household size was correlated with COVID-19 deaths in the population over 65. A moderate correlation was found between the COVID-19 mortality rate per 100,000 population and PM(10), SO(2), and NO(2) (r = 0.413, 0.421, and 0.431, respectively). Mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic in Istanbul is related to an interaction of socioeconomic characteristics and air pollution as an environmental issue.","Aykaç, Nilüfer; Etiler, Nilay",Environ Sci Pollut Res Int,46,1

This paper aims to review the most recent medical imaging techniques used for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 and their potential contributions to attenuate the pandemic. Recent researches, including artificial intelligence tools, will be described. METHODS: We review the main clinical features of SARS-CoV-2 revealed by different medical imaging techniques. First, we present the clinical findings of each technique. Then, we describe several artificial intelligence approaches introduced for the SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis. RESULTS: CT is the most accurate diagnostic modality of SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, ground-glass opacities and consolidation are the most common signs of SARS-CoV-2 in CT images. However, other findings such as reticular pattern, and crazy paving could be observed. We also found that pleural effusion and pneumothorax features are less common in SARS-CoV-2. According to the literature, the B lines artifacts and pleural line irregularities are the common signs of SARS-CoV-2 in ultrasound images. We have also stated the different studies, focusing on artificial intelligence tools, to evaluate the SARS-CoV-2 severity. We found that most of the reported works based on deep learning focused on the detection of SARS-CoV-2 from medical images while the challenge for the radiologists is how to differentiate between SARS-CoV-2 and other viral infections with the same clinical features. CONCLUSION: The identification of SARS-CoV-2 manifestations on medical images is a key step in radiological workflow for the diagnosis of the virus and could be useful for researchers working on computer-aided diagnosis of pulmonary infections.","Benameur, Narjes; Mahmoudi, Ramzi; Zaid, Soraya; Arous, Younes; Hmida, Badii; Bedoui, Mohamed Hedi",Clin Imaging,46,20

(Evolution, Medicine and Public Health 2021;9:120–30.)",20.694256,0.6534841,2021-04-16,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to shortage of intensive care unit (ICU) capacity. We developed a triage strategy including noninvasive respiratory support and admission to the intermediate care unit (IMCU). ICU admission was restricted to patients requiring invasive ventilation. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study is to describe the characteristics and outcomes of patients admitted to the IMCU. METHOD: Retrospective cohort including consecutive patients admitted between March 28 and April 27, 2020. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with severe hypoxemic respiratory failure avoiding ICU admission. Secondary outcomes included the rate of emergency intubation, 28-day mortality, and predictors of ICU admission. RESULTS: One hundred fifty-seven patients with COVID-19-associated pneumonia were admitted to the IMCU. Among the 85 patients admitted for worsening respiratory failure, 52/85 (61%) avoided ICU admission. In multivariate analysis, PaO2/FiO2 (OR 0.98; 95% CI: 0.96–0.99) and BMI (OR 0.88; 95% CI: 0.78–0.98) were significantly associated with ICU admission. No death or emergency intubation occurred in the IMCU. CONCLUSIONS: IMCU admission including standardized triage criteria, self-proning, and noninvasive respiratory support prevents ICU admission for a large proportion of patients with COVID-19 hypoxemic respiratory failure. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, IMCUs may play an important role in preserving ICU capacity by avoiding ICU admission for patients with worsening respiratory failure and allowing early discharge of ICU patients.","Grosgurin, Olivier; Leidi, Antonio; Farhoumand, Pauline Darbellay; Carballo, Sebastian; Adler, Dan; Reny, Jean-Luc; Bollen Pinto, Bernardo; Rossel, Anne; Serratrice, Jacques; Agoritsas, Thomas; Stirnemann, Jérôme; Marti, Christophe",Respiration,46,32

While progress has been made in reducing the number of people experiencing homelessness in the United States from 2007 (647,000) to 2019 (567,000), it remains an entrenched problem. The purpose of this paper is to outline a novel, interdisciplinary academic-practice partnership model to address homelessness. Where singular disciplinary approaches may fall short in substantially reducing homelessness at the community and population level, our model draws from a collective impact model which coordinates discipline-specific approaches through mutually reinforcing activities and shared metrics of progress and impact to foster synergy and sustainability of efforts. This paper describes the necessary capacity-building at the institution and community level for the model, the complementary strengths and contributions of each stakeholder discipline in the proposed model, and future goals for implementation to address homelessness in the Southern California region.","Abdel-Samad, Mounah; Calzo, Jerel P.; Felner, Jennifer K.; Urada, Lianne; Verbyla, Matthew E.; Madanat, Hala; Adams, Brian E.; Alves, Thais; Appleyard, Bruce; Chanin, Joshua; Flanigan, Shawn; Foad, Hisham; Ginsberg, Maya; Higgins, Matthew; Ko, Eunjeong; Maher, Kristen; Mladenov, Natalie; Peattie, Peggy; Welsh, Megan; Sleet, David",Int J Environ Res Public Health,46,16

Aspects of candidate evaluation and follow-up rapidly converted to telehealth. Months into the pandemic, much has been learned from experiences worldwide, yet many questions remain. In this Perspective, we reflect on some of the practice decisions made by the transplant community in the initial response to the pandemic and consider lessons learned, including those related to the risks, benefits, and logistical considerations of proceeding with versus delaying deceased-donor transplantation, living donation, and living-donor transplantation during the pandemic. We review the evolution of therapeutic strategies for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and their use in transplant recipients, current consensus related to immunosuppression management in infected transplant recipients, and emerging information on vaccination against SARS-CoV-2.

Our goal is to provide a multi‐dimensional framework for remotely assessing cognitive, functional, behavioral, and physical aspects of people with cognitive impairment, along with ethical and technical considerations. METHODS: Literature review on remote cognitive assessment and multidisciplinary expert opinion from behavioral neurologists, neuropsychiatrists, neuropsychologists, and geriatricians was integrated under the auspices of the Alzheimer Society of Canada Task Force on Dementia Care Best Practices for COVID‐19. Telephone and video approaches to assessments were considered. RESULTS: Remote assessment is shown to be acceptable to patients and caregivers. Informed consent, informant history, and attention to privacy and autonomy are paramount. A range of screening and domain‐specific instruments are available for telephone or video assessment of cognition, function, and behavior. Some neuropsychological tests administered by videoconferencing show good agreement with in‐person assessment but still lack validation and norms. Aspects of the remote dementia‐focused neurological examination can be performed reliably. DISCUSSION: Despite challenges, current literature and practice support implementation of telemedicine assessments for patients with cognitive impairment. Convergence of data across the clinical interview, reliable and brief remote cognitive tests, and remote neurological exam increase confidence in clinical interpretation and diagnosis.","Geddes, Maiya R.; O'Connell, Megan E.; Fisk, John D.; Gauthier, Serge; Camicioli, Richard; Ismail, Zahinoor",Alzheimers Dement (Amst),46,22

The objectives were to investigate 1) the production of adiponectin by human lung explants, 2) the expression of the adiponectin receptors AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 by human lung macrophages (LMs), and 3) the impact of recombinant human adiponectin and a small-molecule APN receptor agonist (AdipoRon) on LMs activation. Material and methods: Human parenchyma explants and LMs were isolated from patients operated for carcinoma. The LMs were cultured with recombinant adiponectin or AdipoRon and stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (10 ng ml(−1)), poly (I:C) (10 µg ml(−1)) or interleukin (IL)-4 (10 ng ml(−1)) for 24 h. Cytokines or adiponectin, released by explants or LMs, were measured using ELISAs. The mRNA levels of AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 were determined using real-time quantitative PCR. AdipoRs expression was also assessed with confocal microscopy. Results: Adiponectin was released by lung explants at a level negatively correlated with the donor’s body mass index. AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 were both expressed in LMs. Adiponectin (3–30 µg ml(−1)) and AdipoRon (25–50 μM) markedly inhibited the LPS- and poly (I:C)-induced release of Tumor Necrosis Factor-α, IL-6 and chemokines (CCL3, CCL4, CCL5, CXCL1, CXCL8, CXCL10) and the IL-4-induced release of chemokines (CCL13, CCL17, CCL22) in a concentration-dependent manner. Recombinant adiponectin produced in mammalian cells (lacking low molecular weight isoforms) had no effects on LMs. Conclusion and implications: The low-molecular-weight isoforms of adiponectin and AdipoRon have an anti-inflammatory activity in the lung environment. Targeting adiponectin receptors may constitute a new means of controlling airways inflammation.","Salvator, Hélène; Grassin-Delyle, Stanislas; Brollo, Marion; Couderc, Louis-Jean; Abrial, Charlotte; Victoni, Tatiana; Naline, Emmanuel; Devillier, Philippe",Front Pharmacol,46,29

RESULTS: Occupational contact with suspected COVID-19 cases was associated with anxiety. Concerns about return to work, childcare, lack of sick leave, and loss/reduction in work correlated with anxiety and depression, even when there was no evidence of occupational contact with infected persons; patterns differed by sex.

During the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, an increased avoidance of the emergency departments for non-COVID-19 illnesses has been reported in the medical literature. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate whether the COVID-19 pandemic caused increased number of orchiectomies in pediatric patients presenting with acute testicular torsion compared to pre-COVID-19 period. STUDY DESIGN: A total number of 119 pediatric patients who underwent surgery for acute testicular torsion from January 2019 to December 2020 were enrolled in retrospective multi-center study from six institutions in Croatia. The patients were divided in two groups. The first group (pre-COVID-19) consisted of the patients who underwent surgery before COVID-19 pandemic (n=68), while the second group (COVID-19) consisted of the patients who underwent surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic (n=51). Main outcomes of the study were orchiectomy rates and time from onset of the symptoms to emergency department presentation. RESULTS: During the COVID-19 pandemic period 43.1% (22/51) of the patients underwent orchiectomy while orchiectomy was performed in 16.2% (11/68) of the patients from the pre-COVID group (p=0.001). Median time from onset of the symptoms to emergency department presentation during COVID-19 pandemic and pre-COVID-19 periods was 14h (IQR 5, 48) and 6h (IQR 3, 22) (p=0.007), respectively.

Individual genetic landscapes can contribute to understand Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) burden and can give information on how to fight virus spreading and the associated severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The spread and pathogenicity of the virus have become pandemic on specific geographic areas and ethnicities. Interestingly, SARS-CoV-2 firstly emerged in East Asia and next in Europe, where it has caused higher morbidity and mortality. This is a peculiar feature of SARS-CoV-2, different from past global viral infections (i.e., SARS-1 or MERS); it shares with the previous pandemics strong age- and sex-dependent gaps in the disease outcome. The observation that the severest COVID-19 patients are more likely to have a history of hypertension, diabetes and/or cardiovascular disease and receive Renin-Angiotensin-System (RAS) inhibitor treatment raised the hypothesis that RAS-unbalancing may have a crucial role. Accordingly, we recently published a genetic hypothesis on the role of RAS-pathway genes (ACE1, rs4646994, rs1799752, rs4340, rs13447447; and ACE2, rs2285666, rs1978124, rs714205) and ABO-locus (rs495828, rs8176746) in COVID-19 prognosis, suspecting inherited genetic predispositions to be predictive of COVID-19 severity. In addition, recently, Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) found COVID-19-association signals at locus 3p21.31 (rs11385942) comprising the solute carrier SLC6A20 (Na+ and Cl- coupled transporter family) and at locus 9q34.2 (rs657152) coincident with ABO-blood group (rs8176747, rs41302905, rs8176719), and interestingly, both loci are associated to RAS-pathway. Finally, ACE1 and ACE2 haplotypes seem to provide plausible explanations for why SARS-CoV-2 have affected more heavily some ethnic groups, namely people with European ancestry, than Asians.","Gemmati, Donato; Tisato, Veronica",Genes (Basel),46,26

Serum LDH was shown elevated in the COVID‐19 patients on admission and declined throughout disease course, and its ability to classify patient severity outperformed other biochemical indicators. A threshold of 247 U/L serum LDH on admission was determined for severity prognosis. Next, we classified a subset of 14 patients into high‐ and low‐risk groups based on serum LDH expression and compared their quantitative serum proteomic and metabolomic differences. The results showed that COVID‐19 patients with high serum LDH exhibited differentially expressed blood coagulation and immune responses including acute inflammatory responses, platelet degranulation, complement cascade, as well as multiple different metabolic responses including lipid metabolism, protein ubiquitination and pyruvate fermentation. Specifically, activation of hypoxia responses was highlighted in patients with high LDH expressions. Taken together, our data showed that serum LDH levels are associated with COVID‐19 severity, and that elevated serum LDH might be consequences of hypoxia and tissue injuries induced by inflammation.","Yan, Haixi; Liang, Xiao; Du, Juping; He, Zebao; Wang, Yu; Lyu, Mengge; Yue, Liang; Zhang, Fangfei; Xue, Zhangzhi; Xu, Luang; Ruan, Guan; Li, Jun; Zhu, Hongguo; Xu, Jiaqin; Chen, Shiyong; Zhang, Chao; Lv, Dongqing; Lin, Zongmei; Shen, Bo; Zhu, Yi; Qian, Biyun; Chen, Haixiao; Guo, Tiannan",Proteomics,46,24
