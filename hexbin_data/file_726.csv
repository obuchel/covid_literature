1959,1959,1959,Evidence for the Convergence Model: The Emergence of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (H5N1) in Viet Nam,11.221539,7.973432,2015-09-23,"Building on a series of ground breaking reviews that first defined and drew attention to emerging infectious diseases (EID), the ‘convergence model’ was proposed to explain the multifactorial causality of disease emergence. The model broadly hypothesizes disease emergence is driven by the co-incidence of genetic, physical environmental, ecological, and social factors. We developed and tested a model of the emergence of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 based on suspected convergence factors that are mainly associated with land-use change. Building on previous geospatial statistical studies that identified natural and human risk factors associated with urbanization, we added new factors to test whether causal mechanisms and pathogenic landscapes could be more specifically identified. Our findings suggest that urbanization spatially combines risk factors to produce particular types of peri-urban landscapes with significantly higher HPAI H5N1 emergence risk. The work highlights that peri-urban areas of Viet Nam have higher levels of chicken densities, duck and geese flock size diversities, and fraction of land under rice or aquaculture than rural and urban areas. We also found that land-use diversity, a surrogate measure for potential mixing of host populations and other factors that likely influence viral transmission, significantly improves the model’s predictability. Similarly, landscapes where intensive and extensive forms of poultry production overlap were found at greater risk. These results support the convergence hypothesis in general and demonstrate the potential to improve EID prevention and control by combing geospatial monitoring of these factors along with pathogen surveillance programs.","Saksena, Sumeet; Fox, Jefferson; Epprecht, Michael; Tran, Chinh C.; Nong, Duong H.; Spencer, James H.; Nguyen, Lam; Finucane, Melissa L.; Tran, Vien D.; Wilcox, Bruce A.",PLoS One,726,1

Significant associations with HIV seropositivity were found with the number of lifetime partners, positive treponemal serology, and evidence of previous infection with herpes simplex virus. However the major and unique finding was the strong and independent association between proctitis diagnosed by histologic criteria and seropositivity for HIV.

However, there is a pressing need for developing inexpensive and simple alternatives to high-cost and complex chemical agents-based catalysts for large-scale production of heterocyclic compounds. Also, development of some smart platforms for cancer treatment based on nanoparticles (NPs) which facilitate Fenton reaction have been widely explored by different scientists. Magnetic NPs not only can serve as catalysts in the synthesis of heterocyclic compounds with potential anticancer properties, but also are widely used as smart agents in targeting cancer cells and inducing Fenton reactions. AIM OF REVIEW: Therefore, in this review we aim to present an updated summary of the reports related to the main clinical or basic application and research progress of magnetic NPs in cancer as well as their application in the synthesis of heterocyclic compounds as potential anticancer drugs. Afterwards, specific tumor microenvironment (TME)-responsive magnetic nanocatalysts for cancer treatment through triggering Fenton-like reactions were surveyed. Finally, some ignored factors in the design of magnetic nanocatalysts- triggered Fenton-like reaction, challenges and future perspective of magnetic nanocatalysts-assisted synthesis of heterocyclic compounds and selective cancer therapy were discussed. Key Scientific Concepts of Review: This review may pave the way for well-organized translation of magnetic nanocatalysts in cancer therapy from the bench to the bedside.","Khan, Suliman; Sharifi, Majid; Hasan, Anwarul; Attar, Farnoosh; Edis, Zehra; Bai, Qian; Derakhshankhah, Hossein; Falahati, Mojtaba",J Adv Res,726,28

Diet, genetic factors, inflammation, and immunocytes and their cytokines play a role in their pathobiology. But the exact role of sodium, potassium, magnesium and other minerals, trace elements and vitamins in the pathogenesis of HTN and T2DM is not known. Recent studies showed that sodium and potassium can modulate oxidative stress, inflammation, alter the autonomic nervous system and induce dysfunction of the innate and adaptive immune responses in addition to their action on renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. These actions of sodium, potassium and magnesium and other minerals, trace elements and vitamins are likely to be secondary to their action on pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6, TNF-α and IL-17 and metabolism of essential fatty acids that may account for their involvement in the pathobiology of insulin resistance, T2DM, HTN and autoimmune diseases.","Das, Undurti N.",Lipids Health Dis,726,1

Information was retrieved through key words and key questions covering the stability and degradation of ncRNAs after oral ingestion, the passage of ncRNAs from food and feed to human and animal organs and tissues via the gastrointestinal tract and other barriers, as well as the potential effects on the gastrointestinal tract, the immune system or the entire organism.Full description of the strategy used for the literature search and for studies selectionis provided and the number of retrieved publications is reported. This report is divided into four partsdiscussing the kinetics of exogenous ncRNAs in humans and animals, with focus on ingested ncRNAs (Part 1); the possible effects of ncRNAs on the gastrointestinal tract (Part 2), systemically(Part 3)and on the immune system (Part 4). This report suggests that some plant ncRNAs (e.g miRNAs and siRNAs) show higher stability as compared to other ncRNAs due to peculiar chemical characteristics (2’‐O‐methylation at 3’ end).However, ingested or administered ncRNA must overcome many extracellular and cellular barriers to reach the intended target tissue or functional location in sufficient amount to exert any biological effect. Literature data indicate that chemically unmodified and unformulated ncRNAs exhibit very low stability in the gastrointestinal tract and in biological fluids and, in general, do not elicit major biological effects.This report also provides an overview of the RNA content in plant‐derived foods and diets and discusses the controversies on the presence of dietary exogenous RNAs in the biological fluids of humans and animals and their effects.

In this work, we extend this research direction by proposing a nonce-based MAC build from public random permutations. We show that our proposed MAC achieves 2n/3 bit security (with respect to the state size of the permutation) and the bound is essentially tight. Moreover, the security of the MAC degrades gracefully with the repetition of the nonce.","Dutta, Avijit; Nandi, Mridul",Progress in Cryptology - AFRICACRYPT 2020,726,20

Aim of the present study is to undertake a joint evaluation of hs-Troponin and natriuretic peptides (NP) in patients hospitalized for COVID-19 pneumonia. METHODS AND RESULTS: in this multicenter observational study, we analyzed data from n = 111 COVID-19 patients admitted to dedicated “COVID-19” medical units. Hs-Troponin was assessed in n = 103 patients and NP in n = 82 patients on admission; subgroups were identified according to values beyond reference range. increased hs-Troponin and NP were found in 38% and 56% of the cases respectively. As compared to those with normal cardiac biomarkers, these patients were older, had higher prevalence of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and more severe COVID-19 pneumonia by higher CRP and D-dimer and lower PaO2/FIO2. Two-dimensional echocardiography performed in a subset of patients (n = 24) showed significantly reduced left ventricular ejection fraction in patients with elevated NP only (p = 0.02), whereas right ventricular systolic function (tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion) was significantly reduced both in patients with high hs-Troponin and NP (p = 0.022 and p = 0.03 respectively). On multivariable analysis, independent associations were found of hs-Troponin with age, PaO2/FIO2 and D-dimer (B = 0.419, p = 0.001; B=-0.212, p = 0.013 and B = 0.179, p = 0.037 respectively), and of NP with age and previous CVD (B = 0.480, p < 0.001 and B = 0.253, p = 0.001 respectively). In patients with in-hospital mortality (n = 23, 21%) hs-Troponin and NP were both higher (p = 0.001 and p = 0.002 respectively), while increasing hs-troponin and NP were associated with worse in-hospital prognosis [OR 4.88 (95% CI 1.9-12.2), p = 0.001 (adjusted OR 3.1 (95% CI 1.2-8.5), p = 0.025) and OR 4.67 (95% CI 2-10.8), p < 0.001 (adjusted OR 2.89 (95% CI 1.1-7.9), p = 0.04) respectively]. Receiver operator characteristic curves showed good ability of hs-Troponin and NP in predicting in-hospital mortality (AUC = 0.869 p < 0.001 and AUC = 0.810, p < 0.001 respectively). CONCLUSION: myocardial involvement at admission is common in COVID-19 pneumonia and associated to worse prognosis, suggesting a role for cardiac biomarkers assessment in COVID-19 risk stratification. Independent associations of hs-Troponin with markers of disease severity and of NP with underlying CVD might point towards existing different mechanisms leading to their elevation in this setting.","Arcari, Luca; Luciano, Michelangelo; Cacciotti, Luca; Musumeci, Maria Beatrice; Spuntarelli, Valerio; Pistella, Eleonora; Martolini, Dario; Manzo, Daniele; Pucci, Mariateresa; Marone, Claudio; Melandri, Serena; Ansalone, Gerardo; Santini, Claudio; Martelletti, Paolo; Volpe, Massimo; De Biase, Luciano",Eur Heart J Suppl,726,16

In these academic studies, the measurement of solidarity and its conceptualization strongly differ and that prevents us from evaluating the long-term existence of solidarity in the EU or its effectiveness. This article intends to narrow this gap by starting a theoretical discussion on a possible standardized question on fiscal solidarity in the EU. To do so, it examines existing questions and borrows from the research on social trust and survey methodology. Then, it proposes a new fiscal solidarity question, of which its reliability and validity is assessed via the Survey Quality Predictor, a computer program to evaluate survey questions. This article argues that the new fiscal solidarity question should mention the term solidarity and include the solidarity practice defined as permanent financial help. Once established, a standard solidarity question will strengthen the comparability of solidarity in continued social science research.","Holesch, Adam",Acta Polit,726,1

Despite its controversial identity, which was only recently solved, this protein has gained scientific interest because of its role in the proliferative status of cells; many tumor cells from different organs overexpress the σ(2) receptor, and many σ(2) ligands display cytotoxic actions in (resistant) cancer cells. These properties have shed light on the σ(2) receptor as a potential druggable target to be bound/activated for the diagnosis or therapy of tumors. Additionally, diverse groups have shown how the σ(2) receptor can be exploited for the targeted delivery of the anticancer drugs to tumors. As the cancer disease is a multifactorial pathology with multiple cell populations, a polypharmacological approach is very often needed. Instead of the simultaneous administration of different classes of drugs, the use of one molecule that interacts with diverse pharmacological targets, namely MultiTarget Directed Ligand (MTDL), is a promising and currently pursued strategy, that may overcome the pharmacokinetic problems associated with the administration of multiple molecules. This review aims to point out the progress regarding the σ(2) ligands in the oncology field, with a focus on MTDLs directed towards σ(2) receptors as promising weapons against (resistant) cancer diseases.","Abatematteo, Francesca Serena; Niso, Mauro; Lacivita, Enza; Abate, Carmen",Molecules,726,33

The analysis combines daily data on the number of conducted tests and diagnosed cases with a methodology that corrects for non-random testing. We estimate the relationship between daily changes in the number of conducted tests and the fraction of positive cases in the non-random sample (typically less than 1 percent of the population) and apply this gradient to extrapolate the predicted fraction of positive cases if testing were expanded to the entire population. Over the sample period, the estimated population infection rates were 1.7–2.6 percent in Quebec, 0.7–1.4 percent in Ontario, 0.5–1.2 percent in Alberta, and 0.2–0.4 percent in British Columbia. In each province, these estimates are substantially below the average positive case rate, consistent with non-random testing of higher-risk populations. The results also imply widespread undiagnosed COVID-19 infection. For each identified case by mid-April, we estimate there were roughly 12 population infections.","Benatia, David; Godefroy, Raphael; Lewis, Joshua",,726,20

Products shipped during the disruption period come with an uncontrollable delivery lead time, resulting in product quality degradation. To balance the compensation price provided to customers because of quality losses, the retailer might employ freshness-keeping efforts to reduce the quality loss during transportation. Therefore, it raises several fundamental questions for the retailer in mitigating the disruption. Is it always optimal to satisfy those customers who are willing to purchase during disruption? If it is profitable to fulfill orders along with an extra delivery lead time, and with a quality loss compensation, what is the optimal freshness-keeping effort? If it is preferable to deliberately create unsatisfied demand by announcing shortages (rationing) to customers, when is the optimal time to do so? To answer these questions, we first present the dynamics of post-disruption inventory and demand, taking into account the demand learning effect facilitated from negative word-of-mouth during disruption and the demand recovery after disruption ends. Afterward, we develop a model to achieve the optimal selling strategy for maximizing post-disruption profit, identifying the joint decision of the rationing period and freshness-keeping effort. Finally, by numerical analysis, three types of selling strategies are visually provided to hedge against disruptions of different lengths.","Li, Shanshan; He, Yong; Salling, Melissza",Complex Intell,726,10

METHOD: Evaluations of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were made using a questionnaire method. Those with smell and taste dysfunction completed a visual analog scale (VAS) to determine severity. The patients were evaluated at the end of 1 and 2 months. RESULTS: Evaluation was made of a total of 105 patients with a mean age of 55.9±17.6 years. Smell and taste dysfunction was present in 56 (53.3%) patients with a mean age of 48.7±17.6 years and the 49 (46.7%) patients with no smell and taste dysfunction had a mean age of 64±13.6 years. It was determined that as age increased, the complaints of smell and taste dysfunction decreased. Full recovery was determined in 31 (55%) patients after 1 month, and in 16 (28%) patients, smell and taste dysfunction continued at the end of the second month. The symptoms of smell and taste dysfunction were determined to last longer in patients with no comorbidities, no symptoms of fever or shortness of breath, and those treated as outpatients (p=0.043, p=0.031, p=0.034, p=0.028, respectively). In the older age patient group, the VAS scores were observed to be higher and the time to recovery was shorter (p=0.007, p=0.018, respectively). CONCLUSION: Smell and taste dysfunction in COVID-19 patients is seen more as age decreases and recovery takes longer. Smell and taste dysfunction is seen more in patients with symptoms of cough, nasal obstruction, and headache and lasts longer in patients without symptoms of fever and shortness of breath, with no comorbidities and in those treated as outpatients.","Bayrak, A.

In this prospective observational cohort study, we analyzed serological immune responses in 190 individuals before, 3 weeks after 1(st) and 3 weeks after 2(nd) vaccination with BNT162b2. Unvaccinated COVID-19-convalescent subjects served as reference. End points comprised serum anti-spike IgG and IgA titers as well as neutralization capacities against unmutated and mutated SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domains including B.1.1.7, B.1.351 and P.1. We found that antibody titers and neutralization capacities up to 3 weeks after 2(nd) vaccination with BNT162b2 were significantly higher in COVID-19-convalescent as compared to COVID-19-naive vaccinees. Moreover, pre-vaccination anti-NCP IgG titers, but not age or gender, had a high impact on the strength and kinetics of post-vaccination neutralization capacity development. Most importantly, BNT162b2-induced neutralization capacity was cross-reactive with VOCs. In contrast to unvaccinated convalescents, vaccinated convalescent individuals of all ages acquired strong neutralizing capacities against current VOCs. The present study suggests that COVID-19-convalescent individuals with a broad age range between 18 and 98 years benefit from BNT162b2 vaccination by developing strong and broad neutralizing immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 including current VOCs.","Jahrsdörfer, Bernd; Fabricius, Dorit; Scholz, Judith; Ludwig, Carolin; Grempels, Aline; Lotfi, Ramin; Körper, Sixten; Adler, Guido; Schrezenmeier, Hubert",Front Immunol,726,1

METHODS A protocol was lodged with the PROSPERO International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews. We searched Medline, Embase, CINAHL, CENTRAL and AustHealth from database inception to 10th June 2020. Study population included children (preterm to < 18 years) on nCPAP or HFNC who were orally feeding. Primary outcomes included full or partial oral feeding and oropharyngeal aspiration. Secondary outcomes examined adverse events including clinical signs of aspiration, aspiration pneumonia and deterioration in respiratory status. RESULTS The search retrieved 1684 studies following duplicate removal. Title and abstract screening identified 70 studies for full text screening and of these, 16 were included in the review for data extraction. Methods of non-invasive ventilation (NIV) included nCPAP (n = 6), nCPAP and HFNC (n = 5) and HFNC (n = 5). A metanalysis was not possible as respiratory modes and cohorts were not comparable. Eleven studies reported on adverse events. Oral feeding safety was predominantly based on retrospective data from chart entries and clinical signs, with only one study using an instrumental swallow evaluation (VFSS) to determine aspiration status. CONCLUSIONS Findings are insufficient to conclude whether commencing oral feeding whilst on nCPAP or HFNC facilitates transition to full oral feeding without adverse effects, including oropharyngeal aspiration. Further research is required to determine the safety and efficacy of oral feeding on CPAP and HFNC for infants and children.

In this context, one particularly bright medical student stood out, José Gregorio Hernández. As part of a program to modernize medicine in Venezuela, José Gregorio was sent on a scholarship to pursue medical studies in Europe. He brought back to Venezuela equipment and medical knowledge in bacteriology and pathophysiology. This was instrumental in laying the foundations for major healthcare modernization in Venezuela. Throughout his life, José Gregorio negotiated his intense Catholic faith, with his scientific leanings as a physician. His untimely tragic death in 1919 elevated him to a saintly status amongst Venezuelans.

We provide a global snapshot of the CRC patterns, how screening is performed, and compared/contrasted to the genetic profile of Lynch syndrome (LS) in the region. From the literature, we find that only nine (20%) of the Latin America and the Caribbean countries have developed guidelines for early detection of CRC, and also with a low adherence. We describe a genetic profile of LS, including a total of 2,685 suspected families, where confirmed LS ranged from 8% in Uruguay and Argentina to 60% in Peru. Among confirmed LS, path_MLH1 variants were most commonly identified in Peru (82%), Mexico (80%), Chile (60%), and path_MSH2/EPCAM variants were most frequently identified in Colombia (80%) and Argentina (47%). Path_MSH6 and path_PMS2 variants were less common, but they showed important presence in Brazil (15%) and Chile (10%), respectively. Important differences exist at identifying LS families in Latin American countries, where the spectrum of path_MLH1 and path_MSH2 variants are those most frequently identified. Our findings have an impact on the evaluation of the patients and their relatives at risk for LS, derived from the gene affected. Although the awareness of hereditary cancer and genetic testing has improved in the last decade, it is remains deficient, with 39%-80% of the families not being identified for LS among those who actually met both the clinical criteria for LS and showed MMR deficiency.","Vaccaro, Carlos Alberto; López-Kostner, Francisco; Adriana, Della Valle; Palmero, Edenir Inez; Rossi, Benedito Mauro; Antelo, Marina; Solano, Angela; Carraro, Dirce Maria; Forones, Nora Manoukian; Bohorquez, Mabel; Lino-Silva, Leonardo S; Buleje, Jose; Spirandelli, Florencia; Abe-Sandes, Kiyoko; Nascimento, Ivana; Sullcahuaman, Yasser; Sarroca, Carlos; Gonzalez, Maria Laura; Herrando, Alberto Ignacio; Alvarez, Karin; Neffa, Florencia; Galvão, Henrique Camposreis; Esperon, Patricia; Golubicki, Mariano; Cisterna, Daniel; Cardoso, Florencia C; Torrezan, Giovana Tardin; Junior, Samuel Aguiar; Pimenta, Célia Aparecida Marques; da Cruz Formiga, Maria Nirvana; Santos, Erika; Sá, Caroline U; Oliveira, Edite P; Fujita, Ricardo; Spirandelli, Enrique; Jimenez, Geiner; Guindalini, Rodrigo Santa Cruz; de Azevedo, Renata Gondim Meira Velame; Bueno, Larissa Souza Mario; Dos Santos Nogueira, Sonia Tereza; Loarte, Mariela Torres; Padron, Jorge; Del Carmen Castro-Mujica, Maria; Del Monte, Julio Sanchez; Caballero, Carmelo; Peña, Carlos Mario Muñeton; Pinto, Joseph; Barletta-Carrillo, Claudia; Melva, Gutiérrez Angulo; Piñero, Tamara; Beltran, Paola Montenegro; Ashton-Prolla, Patricia; Rodriguez, Yenni; Quispe, Richard; Rossi, Norma Teresa; Martin, Claudia; Chialina, Sergio; Kalfayan, Pablo German; Bazo-Alvarez, Juan Carlos; Cañete, Alcides Recalde; Dominguez-Barrera, Constantino; Nuñez, Lina; Da Silva, Sabrina Daniela; Balavarca, Yesilda; Wernhoff, Patrik; Plazzer, John-Paul; Møller, Pål; Hovig, Eivind; Dominguez-Valentin, Mev",International journal of cancer,726,24

A huge number of new patients, a fast internal reorganization process and many other changes were suddenly established. These circumstances revealed the need to increase stocks of drugs, both for basic treatment as well as for specific SARS-CoV-2 infection management. At the same time, other problems (shortages, new and complex purchasing procedures, etc.) surfaced, so they could risk safety along the pharmacotherapeutic process. The main objective was to develop and implement all the necessary measures within the logistics circuit in order to ensure the availability of medicines for patients, as safely and effectively as possible, during the Coronavirus crisis. Firstly, two pharmacists were appointed to coordinate the whole process, and a preliminary analysis of the following aspects was carried out an estimation of needs to make an initial drug provisioning, a storage feasibility study and a global analysis of the logistics process to detect critical points. Three different circuits for medicines supply were established as some drugs were operated by Agencia Española de Medicamentos y Productos Sanitarios (AEMPS) or Servicio Madrileño de Salud (SERMAS), and others were under no restrictions. For stocks control, inventory was frequently reviewed and monitoring of prescription trends was implemented. For all new medicinal products, compliance with security standards was reviewed and relabeling was carried out if necessary. Criteria were defined for the storage of overstocks and it was placed an isolated area for quarantined drugs. Shortages inevitably occurred but their effects were partly mitigated by AEMPS and SERMAS. After all, we consider that the implemented procedure for logistics management may be reproducible, and the key points we have identified are the following: to enhance our quality management system, to develop an Action Plan for Healthcare Emergencies and to ensure the adequate training for all pharmacy staff. Furthermore, we also should address other aspects: to establish storage optimization strategies, to focus on a more advanced logistics management model, as well as to take advantage of the extraordinary multidisciplinary network, which has been consolidated during this COVID pandemic.","Palomar-Fernández, Carmen; Álvarez-Díaz, Ana",Farmacia hospitalaria : organo oficial de expresion cientifica de la Sociedad Espanola de Farmacia Hospitalaria,726,28

A comorbidity score could help in clinical stratification of patients admitted to internal medicine units. Our aim was to assess a novel modified Elixhauser index (mEi) and the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) for predicting in-hospital mortality (IHM) in internal medicine patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. PATIENTS AND METHODS This single-center retrospective study enrolled all consecutive patients discharged from internal medicine unit with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Both the mEi and CCI were easily calculated from administrative data. Comorbidity scores were tested using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, and the respective area under the curve (AUC). RESULTS The total sample consisted of 151 individuals, and 30 (19.9%) died during their hospital stay. Deceased subjects were older (82.8±10.8 vs. 63.3±18.1 years; p<0.001) and had a higher burden of comorbidities: the mEi and CCI were 29.9±11 vs. 8.8±9.2 and 4.6±2.6 vs. 1.2±2 (p<0.001), respectively. Only the mEi was independently associated with IHM (OR 1.173), and ROC curves analysis showed that the AUCs were 0.863 and 0.918 for the CCI and for mEi, respectively. CONCLUSIONS In patients admitted to internal medicine wards with SARS-CoV-2 infection, the mEi showed a better performance in predicting IHM than CCI.","De Giorgi, A; Fabbian, F; Greco, S; Di Simone, E; De Giorgio, R; Passaro, A; Zuliani, G; Manfredini, R",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,726,30

The present study aimed to estimate propofol dose in older patients based on size descriptors measured by bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA). METHODS A cross sectional study in adult and older patients with body mass index equal to or lower than 35 kg/m2 was carried out. BIA and Clinical Frail Scale scoring were performed during pre-operative evaluation. Propofol infusion was started at 2000 mg/h until loss of consciousness (LOC) which was defined by ""loss of eye-lash reflex"" and ""loss of response to name calling"". Total dose of propofol at LOC was recorded. Propofol plasma concentration was measured using gas chromatography/ion trap-mass spectrometry. RESULTS Forty patients were enrolled in the study. Total propofol dose required to LOC was lower in Age ≥ 65 group and a higher plasma propofol concentration was measured in this group. 60% of old patients were classified as ""apparently vulnerable"" or ""frail"" and narrow phase angle values were associated with increasing vulnerability scores. In the Age ≥ 65 group, the correlation analysis showed that the relationship between propofol dose and total body weight (TBW) scaled by the corresponding phase angle value is stronger than the correlation between propofol dose and TBW or fat free mass (FFM). CONCLUSIONS This study demonstrates that weight-based reduction of propofol is suitable in older patients; however FFM was not seen to be more effective than TBW to predict the propofol induction dose in these patients. Guiding propofol induction dose according to baseline frailty score should also be considered to estimate individualized dosage profiles. Determination of phase angle value appears to be an easy and reliable tool to assess frailty in older patients. TRIAL REGISTRATION ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02713698 .

METHODS Protein kinase D1 expression in tumor tissues and adjacent tissues from 172 patients with non-small cell lung cancer who underwent surgical resection were analyzed by immunohistochemical staining. Based on the total immunohistochemical score, protein kinase D1 expression was classified as protein kinase D1 high expression (further divided into protein kinase D1 high+++, protein kinase D1 high++, and protein kinase D1 high+ expressions) and protein kinase D1 low expression. Clinical characteristics of patients with non-small cell lung cancer were acquired from the database. Accumulating disease-free survival and overall survival were calculated based on patients' relapse/survival status. RESULTS Protein kinase D1 expression was increased in tumor tissues compared to adjacent tissues (P < .001). Tumor protein kinase D1 high expression correlated with poorer pathological differentiation (P = .041), increased tumor size (P = .003), the presence of lymph node metastasis (P = .001), and elevated tumor, nodes and metastases stage (P < .001). Besides, both accumulating disease-free survival and overall survival were decreased in patients with tumor protein kinase D1 high expression compared to patients with tumor protein kinase D1 low expression (P = .010 for disease-free survival and P = 0.005 for overall survival). Moreover, they were lowest in patients with tumor protein kinase D1 high+++ expression, followed by patients with tumor protein kinase D1 high++ expression, then patients with tumor protein kinase D1 high+ expression, and highest in patients with tumor protein kinase D1 low expression (P < .001 for disease-free survival and P = .001 for overall survival). Notably, higher tumor protein kinase D1 expression was an independent predictive factor for decreased disease-free survival (P = .001) and overall survival (P = .004). CONCLUSIONS Protein kinase D1 might be a potential marker to identify patients with non-small cell lung cancer with worse tumor features and prognosis.","Yao, Jing; Jiang, Yan; Geng, Shuang; Sun, Li",Technology in cancer research & treatment,726,1

Surgery revealed the uncinate process extended extensively behind the PV and fused with the pancreatic body. The pancreas was first divided above the PV, and it was divided again in the body after liberating the PV from pancreatic annulation. The postoperative course was uneventful without pancreatic fistula. It is safer to divide the pancreatic body on the left of the fusion between the uncinate process and the pancreatic body to reduce the risk of pancreatic fistula in pancreaticoduodenectomy for PAP.","Kobayashi, Shin; Honda, Goro; Kurata, Masanao; Okuda, Yukihiro; Tsuruta, Koji",Surgery today,726,31

We prospectively measured cerebral and cardiopulmonary parameters in patients with acute stroke or subarachnoid haemorrhage during a switch from i.v. to inhalative sedation. METHODS 25 patients were switched from i.v. to an indefinite period of inhaled sedation with sevoflurane. Mean arterial (MAP), intracranial (ICP), and cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP), middle cerebral artery mean flow velocity (MFV) and fractional tissue oxygen extraction (FTOE), systemic cardiopulmonary parameters, and administered drugs were assessed before and after the change (-6 to +12 h). RESULTS In 8 patients, critically reduced MAP or ICP crisis led to premature termination of sevoflurane sedation. In the other 17 patients, after the first hour, mean ICP increased [2.4 (4.5) mm Hg; P=0.046], MAP decreased [7.8 (14.1) mm Hg; P=0.036] and thus CPP decreased also [-10.2 (15.1) mm Hg; P=0.014]. MFV and FTOE did not change. Over a 12 hour post switch observational period, [Formula: see text] increased slightly [0.3 (0.8) kPa; P=0.104], ICP did not change [0.2 (3.9) mm Hg; P=0.865], but MAP [-6 (6.9) mm Hg; P=0.002] and thus CPP decreased [-6 (8.5) mm Hg; P=0.010].

They are multiligand glycosylated molecules with abundant and complex mannose-rich structures. It remains unclear whether these structures influence hemocyanin-induced immunostimulatory processes in human antigen presenting cells. We have previously shown that hemocyanin glycans from Concholepas concholepas (CCH), Fissurella latimarginata (FLH) and Megathura crenulata (KLH), participate in their immune recognition and immunogenicity in mice, interacting with murine C-type lectin receptors (CLRs). Here, we studied theinteractions of these hemocyanins with two major mannose-binding CLRs on monocyte-derived human dendritic cells: MR (mannose receptor) and DC-SIGN (DC-specific ICAM-3-grabbing nonintegrin). Diverse analyses showed that hemocyanins are internalized by a mannose-sensitive mechanism. This process was calcium dependent. Moreover, hemocyanins colocalized with MR and DC-SIGN, and were partly internalized through clathrin-mediated endocytosis. The hemocyanin-mediated proinflammatory cytokine response was impaired when using deglycosylated FLH and KLH compared to CCH. We further showed that hemocyanins bind to human MR and DC-SIGN in a carbohydrate-dependent manner with affinity constants in the physiological concentration range. Overall, we showed that these three clinically valuable hemocyanins interact with human mannose-sensitive CLRs, initiating an immune response and promoting a Th1 cell-driving potential.

In the literature, there are reports of life-threatening complications with cardiac tamponade and a high mortality rate on using tacks. The continuing practice of tack deployment for mesh fixation to the diaphragm and esophageal hiatus should be critically reviewed. METHODS In a systematic search of the available literature in May 2017, 23 cases of severe penetrating cardiac complications were identified. The authors became aware of two other cases in which they acted as medical experts. Furthermore, the instructions for use issued by the manufacturers of the tacks were reviewed with regard to their deployment in the diaphragm. RESULTS Twenty-three of 25 cases (92%) with severe cardiac injuries and subsequent cardiac tamponade were triggered by the use of tacks in the diaphragm. In six cases (24%), these related to ventral and incisional hernias with extension to the subxiphoid area, and in 19 cases (76%) to mesh-augmented hiatoplasty. Twelve of 25 (48%) patients died as a result of pericardial and/or heart muscle injury with cardiac tamponade despite heart surgery intervention. In the tack manufacturers' instructions for use, their deployment in the diaphragm, in particular in the vicinity of the heart, is contraindicated. Likewise, the existing guidelines urgently advise against the use of tacks in the diaphragm, recommending instead alternative fixation techniques.

OBJECTIVES The aim of this study was to assess personal willingness to respond to a disaster as a part of an international delegation, to an area with unknown and unclear risk of radioactive materials. The Israeli delegation to the Japan 2011 earthquake had been chosen as a case study. METHOD The survey was conducted during the first two weeks after the tsunami in Japan. The population was selected randomly. After distributing the survey form, 94 anonymous answers were received, which give a 69% participation rate. The sample was divided into two groups (participated or didn't participate in an international delegation in the past). RESULTS It was found that as the situation on the ground became worse, the willingness to be deployed dropped dramatically, although no significant difference was found in willingness between the two study groups. When both groups were combined into one group, significant differences were found in their willingness to be deployed in a delegation between the three levels (no radioactive leak, possible radioactive leak, and uncontrolled leak).

METHODS In a retrospective study, data were assessed from girls aged 5 years or younger who were treated for sexual-assault-related injuries at the General Referral Hospital, Panzi, Bukavu, Democratic Republic of Congo, between 2004 and 2014. Data were obtained from review of charts, records of the mother's impressions and physical examinations, and photographic evidence. Elective surgery had been reserved for patients experiencing fecal and/or urinary incontinence. RESULTS Overall, 205 girls aged 5 years or younger presented with rape injuries: 162 (79.1%) had only mucocutaneous lesions, 22 (10.7%) had musculocutaneous lesions, and 21 (10.2%) had musculocutaneous lesions complicated by fecal and/or urinary incontinence. Among the 21 girls who underwent perineal surgery, two with fecal and urinary incontinence and perforation of the peritoneum of Douglas pouch were additionally treated by laparoscopy. Among 16 patients with fecal incontinence, the continence score had improved significantly at 10.4 months after surgery (P<0.001).

METHODS Data from adult patients who underwent surgery for spinal tumors (2011-2014) were extracted from the prospective National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) registry. Multivariable logistic regression was used to evaluate predictors of reoperation, readmission, and major complications (death, neurological, cardiopulmonary, venous thromboembolism [VTE], surgical site infection [SSI], and sepsis). Variables screened included patient age, sex, tumor location, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical classification, preoperative functional status, comorbidities, preoperative laboratory values, case urgency, and operative time. Additional variables that were evaluated when analyzing readmission included complications during the surgical hospitalization, hospital length of stay (LOS), and discharge disposition. RESULTS Among the 2207 patients evaluated, 51.4% had extradural tumors, 36.4% had intradural extramedullary tumors, and 12.3% had intramedullary tumors. By spinal level, 20.7% were cervical lesions, 47.4% were thoracic lesions, 29.1% were lumbar lesions, and 2.8% were sacral lesions. Readmission occurred in 10.2% of patients at a median of 18 days (interquartile range [IQR] 12-23 days); the most common reasons for readmission were SSIs (23.7%), systemic infections (17.8%), VTE (12.7%), and CNS complications (11.9%). Predictors of readmission were comorbidities (dyspnea, hypertension, and anemia), disseminated cancer, preoperative steroid use, and an extended hospitalization. Reoperation occurred in 5.3% of patients at a median of 13 days (IQR 8-20 days) postoperatively and was associated with preoperative steroid use and ASA Class 4-5 designation. Major complications occurred in 14.4% of patients: the most common complications and their median time to occurrence were VTE (4.5%) at 9 days (IQR 4-19 days) postoperatively, SSIs (3.6%) at 18 days (IQR 14-25 days), and sepsis (2.9%) at 13 days (IQR 7-21 days). Predictors of major complications included dependent functional status, emergency case status, male sex, comorbidities (dyspnea, bleeding disorders, preoperative systemic inflammatory response syndrome, preoperative leukocytosis), and ASA Class 3-5 designation (p < 0.05). The median hospital LOS was 5 days (IQR 3-9 days), the 30-day mortality rate was 3.3%, and the median time to death was 20 days (IQR 12.5-26 days). CONCLUSIONS In this NSQIP analysis, 10.2% of patients undergoing surgery for spinal tumors were readmitted within 30 days, 5.3% underwent a reoperation, and 14.4% experienced a major complication. The most common complications were SSIs, systemic infections, and VTE, which often occurred late (after discharge from the surgical hospitalization). Patients were primarily readmitted for new complications that developed following discharge rather than exacerbation of complications from the surgical hospital stay. The strongest predictors of adverse events were comorbidities, preoperative steroid use, and higher ASA classification. These models can be used by surgeons to risk-stratify patients preoperatively and identify those who may benefit from increased surveillance following hospital discharge.","Karhade, Aditya V; Vasudeva, Viren S; Dasenbrock, Hormuzdiyar H; Lu, Yi; Gormley, William B; Groff, Michael W; Chi, John H; Smith, Timothy R",Neurosurgical focus,726,31

Human brown adipose tissue activity is impaired in obesity in vivo. The present study aims to compare the differences in beige adipocyte differentiation potential of subcutaneous adipose tissue derived from normal weight and obese Chinese individuals in vitro. Methods Adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) isolated from subcutaneous fat tissues of normal weight (NW) and obese (OB) groups were induced to differentiate into mature adipocyte with white adipocyte (WA)- and beige adipocyte (BA)-induction treatment. The expression of beige adipocyte marker protein UCP-1 and specific thermogenic genes was detected in differentiated adipocytes via Western blot and rt PCR, and the adipocyte mitochondrial function and lipolysis ability were also measured by oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and glycerol release rate, respectively. Results Either with WA-induction or BA-induction, the expression of UCP-1 and beige adipocyte-specific thermogenic genes in differentiated adipocytes was higher in the NW compared to the OB group, followed by higher OCR and lipolysis ability in NW group than OB group. With BA-induction, expression of UCP-1 and thermogenic genes increased significantly, followed by the increasement in adipocytes OCR and lipolysis rate in NW group compared with WA-induction treatment, but no significant difference was observed in OB group. Conclusion Compromised beige adipocyte differentiation plasticity was found in subcutaneous white adipose tissue derived from obese Chinese individuals, which may be due part to the downregulation of β3-adrenergic receptor expression in adipocytes. Discovery of therapeutic agents to active brown adipose tissue through specific pathways could provide a promising approach for treating obesity in the future.","Li, Han; Shen, Lin; Zhang, Lei; Yan, Bing; Sun, Tao; Guo, Feng; Yin, Xiao","Diabetes, metabolic syndrome and obesity : targets and therapy",726,1

Standard-of-care (SOC) therapy alone is often not sufficient to heal these wounds, resulting in application of adjuvant wound therapies including biologic skin substitutes. Although a variety of products exist, it has been difficult to formulate conclusions on their clinical efficacy. We therefore performed a systematic review and meta-analysis on the efficacy of healing diabetic foot ulcers with biologic skin substitutes. METHODS A systematic review was conducted in accordance with PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses). Four electronic databases (PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE [Ovid], Cochrane CENTRAL [Ovid], and Web of Science) were searched from inception through February 27, 2019. Searches included keywords and subject headings pertaining to 3 main concepts: biologic skin substitutes, wound healing, and diabetic foot ulcers. Cochrane randomized controlled trial filters were used to narrow results. Data were extracted from 54 included articles, and risk-of-bias assessments were conducted by 2 independent reviewers. The primary objective was to calculate a pooled risk ratio for the proportion of wounds completely closed by 12 weeks. Secondary objectives included a pooled risk ratio for the proportion of wounds completely closed by 6 weeks and mean time to healing. RESULTS Twenty-five studies were identified that assessed the proportion of complete wound closure by 12 weeks. We found that wounds treated with biologic dressings were 1.67 times more likely to heal by 12 weeks than those treated with SOC dressings (P < 0.00001). Five studies assessed the proportion of complete wound closure by 6 weeks. Wounds treated with biologic dressings were 2.81 times more likely to heal by 6 weeks than those treated with SOC dressings (P = 0.0001). Descriptively, 29 of 31 studies that assessed time to healing favored biologic dressings over SOC dressings. CONCLUSIONS This systematic review provides supporting evidence that biologic skin substitutes are more effective than SOC dressings at healing diabetic foot ulcers by 12 weeks. Future studies must address the relative benefits of different skin substitutes as well as the long-term implications of these products and their financial considerations.","Gordon, Alex J; Alfonso, Allyson R; Nicholson, Joey; Chiu, Ernest S",Annals of plastic surgery,726,1

Here, we have developed FANG ligands, fibronectin antibody-mimetic nicotinic acetylcholine receptor-generated ligands, using mRNA display. We generated a 1 trillion-member primary e10FnIII library to target a stabilized α1 nicotinic subunit (α211). This library yielded 270000 independent potential protein binding ligands. The lead sequence, α1-FANG1, represented 25% of all library sequences, showed the highest-affinity binding, and competed with α-bungarotoxin (α-Btx). To improve this clone, a new library based on α1-FANG1 was subjected to heat, protease, binding, off-rate selective pressures, and point mutations. This resulted in α1-FANG2 and α1-FANG3. These proteins bind α211 with KD values of 3.5 nM and 670 pM, respectively, compete with α-Btx, and show improved subunit specificity. α1-FANG3 is thermostable ( Tm = 62 °C) with a 6 kcal/mol improvement in folding free energy compared with that of the parent α1-FANG1. α1-FANG3 competes directly with the α-Btx binding site of intact neuromuscular heteropentamers [(α1)2β1γδ] in mammalian culture-derived cellular membranes and in Xenopus laevis oocytes expressing these nAChRs. This work demonstrates that mRNA display against a monomeric ecto-domain of a pentamer has the capability to select ligands that bind that subunit in both a monomeric and a pentameric context. Overall, our work provides a route to creating a new family of stable, well-behaved proteins that specifically target this important receptor family.","Nichols, Aaron L; Noridomi, Kaori; Hughes, Christopher R; Jalali-Yazdi, Farzad; Eaton, J Brek; Lai, Lan Huong; Advani, Gaurav; Lukas, Ronald J; Lester, Henry A; Chen, Lin; Roberts, Richard W",ACS chemical biology,726,33

Trigger points (TrPs) are hypersensitive taut bands that appear in two genres, each with a different ratio in specific areas of the muscles, and when triggered, they can produce pain, numbness, and tingling. Various underlying causes (mechanical, nutritional, and psychological) have been discovered to participate in the pathogenesis of MPS, activating trigger points and intensifying the pain. Furthermore, genetic, social, and psychological factors seem to exacerbate these patients' clinical appearance, according to the biopsychosocial model, which seems to be closely linked to the formation of trigger points. Chronic pain and psychological distress frequently coexist, and psychological and social factors have been found to worsen the patient's quality of life and perpetuate the existing pain. The diagnosis is formed following a comprehensive physical and clinical examination, and the appropriate management technique is selected. For MPS treatment, management techniques based on the biopsychosocial model are used in conjunction with various myofascial release strategies and pharmacologic care. Exercise, posture correction, and a vitamin balance in the diet, especially in the Vitamin B complex, appear to prevent trigger point (TrP) activation. The precise etiology of MPS is not clear yet, and further research is needed to determine the root cause. A holistic approach, which blends the basic clinical care with the management of the biopsychosocial model, is essential to patients with MPS to regain their function and improve their quality of life and wellbeing.","Koukoulithras, Ioannis; Plexousakis, Minas; Kolokotsios, Spyridon; Stamouli, Alexandra; Mavrogiannopoulou, Christine",Cureus,726,1

OBJECTIVES To determine whether rs6967330 influences RV-C infections and illnesses in early childhood. METHODS We studied associations between rs6967330 and respiratory infections and illnesses in the COPSAC2010 (Copenhagen Prospective Studies on Asthma in Childhood 2010) and COAST (Childhood Origins of Asthma Birth Cohort Study) birth cohorts, where respiratory infections were monitored prospectively for the first 3 years of life. Nasal samples were collected during acute infections in both cohorts and during asymptomatic periods in COAST and analyzed for RV-A, RV-B, and RV-C, and other common respiratory viruses. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS The CDHR3 asthma risk allele (rs6967330-A) was associated with increased risk of respiratory tract illnesses (incidence risk ratio [IRR] = 1.14 [95% confidence interval, 1.05-1.23]; P = 0.003). In particular, this variant was associated with risk of respiratory episodes with detection of RV-C in COPSAC2010 (IRR = 1.89 [1.14-3.05]; P = 0.01) and in COAST (IRR = 1.37 [1.02-1.82]; P = 0.03) children, and in a combined meta-analysis (IRR = 1.51 [1.13-2.02]; P = 0.006). In contrast, the variant was not associated with illnesses related to other viruses (IRR = 1.07 [0.92-1.25]; P = 0.37). Consistent with these observations, the CDHR3 variant was associated with increased detection of RV-C, but not of other viruses during scheduled visits at specific ages. CONCLUSIONS The CDHR3 asthma risk allele is associated specifically with RV-C illnesses in two birth cohorts. This clinical evidence supports earlier molecular evidence indicating that CDHR3 functions as an RV-C receptor, and raises the possibility of preventing RV-C infections by targeting CDHR3.","Bønnelykke, Klaus; Coleman, Amaziah T; Evans, Michael D; Thorsen, Jonathan; Waage, Johannes; Vissing, Nadja H; Carlsson, Christian J; Stokholm, Jakob; Chawes, Bo L; Jessen, Leon E; Fischer, Thea K; Bochkov, Yury A; Ober, Carole; Lemanske, Robert F; Jackson, Daniel J; Gern, James E; Bisgaard, Hans",American journal of respiratory and critical care medicine,726,5

Here, we show that upon infection of human cells, Campylobacter jejuni secretes its Cas9 (CjeCas9) nuclease into their cytoplasm. Next, a native nuclear localization signal enables CjeCas9 nuclear entry, where it catalyzes metal-dependent nonspecific DNA cleavage leading to cell death. Compared to CjeCas9, native Cas9 of Streptococcus pyogenes (SpyCas9) is more suitable for guide-dependent editing. However, in human cells, native SpyCas9 may still cause some DNA damage, most likely because of its ssDNA cleavage activity. This side effect can be completely prevented by saturation of SpyCas9 with an appropriate guide RNA, which is only partially effective for CjeCas9. We conclude that CjeCas9 plays an active role in attacking human cells rather than in viral defense. Moreover, these unique catalytic features may therefore make CjeCas9 less suitable for genome editing applications.","Saha, Chinmoy; Mohanraju, Prarthana; Stubbs, Andrew; Dugar, Gaurav; Hoogstrate, Youri; Kremers, Gert-Jan; van Cappellen, Wiggert A; Horst-Kreft, Deborah; Laffeber, Charlie; Lebbink, Joyce H G; Bruens, Serena; Gaskin, Duncan; Beerens, Dior; Klunder, Maarten; Joosten, Rob; Demmers, Jeroen A A; van Gent, Dik; Mouton, Johan W; van der Spek, Peter J; van der Oost, John; van Baarlen, Peter; Louwen, Rogier",Science advances,726,4

Various suggestions put forward to account for this included the possibility that LMICs might be experiencing off-target benefits of infant vaccination with BCG, intended primarily to protect against tuberculosis. A number of ecologic epidemiological studies that considered COVID-19 morbidity and mortality rates across countries appeared to support this suggestion. Ecologic studies, however, are primarily hypothesis-generating, given their well-known limitations in extrapolating to the individual-person level. The present study, which employed anonymized records of U.S. Military Veterans treated by the Department of Veterans Affairs was principally a case-control study of COVID-19 infections with a retrospective cohort study of mortality nested within the infections. Controls were a random sample of Veterans not recorded as having had COVID-19. There were 263,039 controls and 167,664 COVID-19 cases, of whom 5,016 died. The combination of country and year of birth was used as a surrogate for infant BCG vaccination. The study did not support the hypothesis that BCG in infancy was protective against COVID-19. The odds ratio for infection was 1.07 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.03, 1.11) and the risk ratio for mortality among the COVID-19 cases was 0.86 (95% CI: 0.63, 1.18).

Mandates such as distancing and variations to treatment services were implemented to slow transmission of the virus, but created new challenges for persons with Substance Use Disorder (SUD). To better understand this phenomenon, we surveyed healthcare professionals on how they believe COVID-19 has impacted persons with SUD and what needs to occur to effectively treat this vulnerable population. Methods: Attending physicians, residents, nurses, medical and nursing students, and other healthcare professionals were asked to respond to three open-ended questions related to the impact of COVID-19 on persons with SUD. Two independent coders reviewed the comments utilizing constant comparative analysis to develop themes. Results: Common themes of concern were found from the respective participants (n = 205) including: lack of access to treatment, feelings of isolation, negative impacts on mental health, and the possibility of relapse. Healthcare strategies to effectively treat and help persons with SUD included increasing access to treatment including telehealth, development of peer support groups, availability of mental health resources, development of enhanced communication channels between providers and patients, and systematic changes. Conclusion: During the COVID-19 pandemic, overdose deaths have dramatically increased. As the short-term and long-term effects of the pandemic become more apparent, swift and comprehensive responses and policies must be enacted. This study provides insight from healthcare providers on the effects of the pandemic for persons with SUD. Many preexisting issues remain unresolved (e.g. stigma and healthcare disparities), and now the pandemic has presented new obstacles as noted by the providers. The findings from this study provide implications for important discussion regarding the development of strategies for substance use treatment and harm reduction.","Shreffler, Jacob; Shreffler, Megan; Murfree, Jessica R; Huecker, Martin",Substance use & misuse,726,1

The aim of this study is to report changes about numbers and reason for ENT consultations in emergency department (ED) during COVID-19 pandemic comparing with those occurred the previous year (2019). METHODS Data about patients admitted to adult and pediatric ED were collected from March 1 to May 31, 2019 and 2020. Patients referred for urgency from general practitioners were excluded from the study. RESULTS Global ED admission (except for dyspnea or COVID-19-related symptoms) dramatically decreased during pandemic (-50.9% among adults and -71.4% among pediatrics). At the same time, ENT consultancy significantly reduced too, by 71.5% (P < .01) among adults and 45.1% (P < .01) for pediatrics. Among adults, it was reported a statistically significant decrease in consultation for ear problems (-88.5%, P = .0146). Reduction in ENT referral for bone fracture (-40%, P = .059), vertigo (-77.8%, P = .637), and tonsillitis (-87.5%, P = .688) was consistent, but not significant.

Obinutuzumab was developed to potentiate activity and overcome resistance to rituximab. Clinical data suggest that obinutuzumab is superior to rituximab in follicular lymphoma (FL) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Yet, it has increased toxicity. This systematic review and meta-analysis compiled all randomized controlled trials comparing obinutuzumab-based regimens with rituximab-based regimens to better assess their toxicity profile. Primary outcome was grade 3-4 infections; secondary outcomes included any adverse events (AE), grade 3-4 AE, drug discontinuation rate and 3-year mortality. Relative risks (RRs) were estimated and pooled using a fixed-effect model, unless there was significant heterogeneity, in which case a random-effects model was used. Our comprehensive search yielded five randomized controlled trials conducted between 2009 and 2014, including 4,247 patients. The trials included FL patients, CLL and diffuse large B cell lymphoma. Monoclonal antibodies were given with different chemotherapy regimens (in four trials) or as monotherapy (in one trial). The point estimate favored increase in both grade 3-4 infections rate (RR 1.17 [95% CI, 1.0-1.36]) and any AE rate (RR 1.05 [95% 1-1.1]) with obinutuzumab, although this was not statistically significant. There was a significantly increased rate of grade 3-4 AE (RR 1.15 [95% CI, 1.09-1.2]), as well as grade 3-4 toxicities including thrombocytopenia (RR 2.8 [95% CI, 1.92-4.06]), infusion related reactions (RR 2.8 [95% CI, 2.16-3.64]) and cardiac events (RR 1.65 [95% CI, 1.11-2.46]).

COVID-19 is caused by SARS-CoV-2, a novel coronavirus that leads to a variety of symptoms in humans, including cough, fever and respiratory failure. SARS-CoV-2 infection can trigger extensive immune responses, including the production of antibodies. The detection of antibody response by serological testing provides a supplementary diagnostic tool to molecular tests. We hereby present a succinct yet comprehensive review on the antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, as well as molecular mechanisms behind the strengths and limitations of serological antibody tests. The presence of antibodies can be detected in patient sera within days post symptom onset. Serological tests demonstrate superior sensitivity to molecular tests in some periods of time during disease development. Compared with the molecular tests, serological tests can be used for point-of-care testing, providing faster results at a lower cost. Commercially available serological tests show variable sensitivity and specificity, and the molecular basis of these variabilities are analysed. We discuss assays of different complexities that are used to specifically quantitate neutralising antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, which has important implications for vaccine development and herd immunity. Furthermore, we discuss examples of successful applications of serological tests to contact tracing and community-level sero-surveying, which provide invaluable information for pandemic management and assessment.","Jiang, Jiayue-Clara; Zhang, Yan",Biochemical Society transactions,726,1

STUDY DESIGN The medical records of 60 patients who underwent laparoscopic myomectomy between January 2016 and August 2019 were reviewed. Thirty patients underwent gasless SPA laparoscopic myomectomy using a J-shaped retractor, and 30 patients underwent conventional SPA laparoscopic myomectomy. The 2 groups were compared in terms of surgical outcomes. In gasless laparoscopic myomectomy, closure of the uterine defect after myomectomy was performed using an extracorporeal suture technique with a Kelly clamp and knot pusher. RESULTS On comparing gasless SPA and conventional SPA laparoscopic myomectomy, no significant differences were observed in age, body mass index, parity, previous abdominal surgery, and size of the dominant uterine myoma. The median retraction setup time from skin incision was 8 minutes (range, 5 to 15 min) with gasless SPA laparoscopic myomectomy. The median total operation times were 105 minutes (range, 62 to 210 min) with gasless SPA myomectomy and 110 minutes (range, 60 to 270 min) with conventional SPA myomectomy, and there was no significant difference (P=0.251). There was no difference between the groups in terms of estimated blood loss. None of the patients experienced laparotomy conversion in both groups. No major complications, such as urologic, bowel, and vessel injuries, were found in both groups. CONCLUSION Gasless SPA laparoscopic myomectomy using a J-shaped retractor is a safe and feasible approach, which allows for easy and convenient suturing of a uterine defect after myomectomy.","Hwang, Jong Ha; Kim, Bo Wook","Surgical laparoscopy, endoscopy & percutaneous techniques",726,1

METHODS A cost-benefit analyses was conducted using hospital administrative data to determine an adjusted Return on Investment (ROI): on all 268 patients enrolled in the CAI program during the 33-month pilot program phase of CAI intervention between October 1, 2005 and June 30, 2008 using a comparison group of 818 patients from a similar cohort in neighboring ZIP codes without CAI intervention. Cost data through June 30, 2013 were used to examine cost changes and calculate an adjusted ROI over a 5-year post-intervention period. RESULTS CAI patients had a cost reduction greater than the comparison group of $1,216 in Year 1 (P = 0.001), $1,320 in Year 2 (P < 0.001), $1,132 (P = 0.002) in Year 3, $1,123 (P = 0.004) in Year 4, and $997 (P = 0.022) in Year 5. Adjusting for the cost savings for the comparison group, the cost savings from the intervention resulted in an adjusted ROI of 1.91 over 5 years. CONCLUSIONS Community-based, multidisciplinary, coordinated disease management programs can decrease the incidence of costly hospitalizations and ED visits from asthma. An ROI of greater than one, as found in this cost analysis, supports the business case for the provision of community-based asthma services as part of patient-centered medical homes and Accountable Care Organizations.","Bhaumik, Urmi; Sommer, Susan J; Giller-Leinwohl, Judith; Norris, Kerri; Tsopelas, Lindsay; Nethersole, Shari; Woods, Elizabeth R",The Journal of asthma : official journal of the Association for the Care of Asthma,726,8

Methods: The present study was carried out on patients with combined cataract and pterygium excision (combined group) and pterygium surgery first and cataract surgery after one month (sequential group). Parameters such as mean keratometry (K) values, axial length, IOL power, and corneal astigmatism were compared pre and postoperatively in the combined and sequential groups. Results: 70 eyes of 70 patients were included in the present study. The mean age of the participants in the combined group was 70.46±10.12, whereas that in the sequential group was 68.68±11.22 (p=0.243). The mean horizontal length of the pterygium in the combined group was 2.64±0.17 mm and 2.57±0.17 mm in the sequential group. The mean postoperative K values (p=0.03) and IOL power (p=0.04) in the combined group were significantly higher than the preoperative values. The estimated postoperative refractive error in the combined group was -0.50±1.00 D and 0.25±0.5 D in the sequential group (p=0.04). On the other hand, the postoperative refraction in the sequential group was predictable. Corneal visibility was diminished on the nasal side in almost all the patients in the combined group as compared to the sequential group. Conclusion: The postoperative refraction errors were positively correlated with the length of pterygium in the combined group. The unpredictability of these errors recommends sequential surgery in cases with concurrent pterygium and cataract.","Joshi, Rajesh Subhash; Pendke, Sudhir Sudhakar; Marewar, Shobha",Romanian journal of ophthalmology,726,1

The aim of this study is to examine the effects of CO2 pneumothorax on cerebral and renal rSO2 and to assess the potential predictive value of these data on neurodevelopmental outcome after neonatal thoracoscopic surgery for CDH or EA. MATERIALS AND METHODS A prospective observational pilot study. Cerebral and renal regional tissue oxyhemoglobine saturation (rSO2) rSO2 were assessed using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) during thoracoscopic surgery in neonates with CDH and with EA, in addition to routine anesthesia monitoring. Cerebral and renal rSO2, linked to repeated arterial blood gas analyses, heart rate, blood pressure, and to structured longitudinal neurodevelopmental follow-up. RESULTS Baseline estimated marginal means of cerebral rSO2 values (CDH: 82%, EA: 91%) did not change significantly during pneumothorax (CDH: 81%, EA 79% [n.s. versus baseline]) despite severe acidosis (lowest pH, CDH: 6.99, EA: 7.1). Neurodevelopmental outcomes at 24 months were normal in all 7 patients who were available for evaluation. CONCLUSION Neonatal thoracoscopic repair of CDH and EA using CO2-pneumothorax leads to severe acidosis. Cerebral rSO2 remained within clinical acceptable limits during intraoperative periods of acidosis. Neurodevelopmental outcome was favorable within the first 24 months. The potential of NIRS to further improve perioperative care and long-term outcome in this specific patient group deserves further investigation.","Costerus, Sophie; Vlot, John; van Rosmalen, Joost; Wijnen, René; Weber, Frank",European journal of pediatric surgery : official journal of Austrian Association of Pediatric Surgery ...

Since 2005, TSWV emerged as an economically important virus of processing tomatoes in the Central Valley of California, in part due to increased populations of the primary thrips vector, western flower thrips (WFT; Frankliniella occidentalis). To develop an understanding of the epidemiology of TSWV in this region, population densities of WFT and incidence of TSWV were monitored in California's processing tomato transplant-producing greenhouses and associated open fields from 2007 to 2013. Thrips were monitored with yellow sticky cards and in tomato flowers, whereas TSWV incidence was assessed with indicator plants and field surveys for virus symptoms. All thrips identified from processing tomato fields were WFT, and females were three-fold more abundant on sticky cards than males. Symptoms of TSWV infection were observed in all monitored processing tomato fields. Incidences of TSWV ranged from 1 to 20%, with highest incidence found in late-planted fields. There was no single primary inoculum source, and inoculum sources for thrips/TSWV varied depending on the production region. These results allowed us to develop a model for TSWV infection of processing tomatoes in the Central Valley of California. The model predicts that low levels of primary TSWV inoculum are amplified in early-planted tomatoes and other susceptible crops leading to highest levels of infection in later-planted fields, especially those with high thrips populations. Based upon these findings, an integrated pest management (IPM) strategy for TSWV in processing tomatoes in California was devised. This IPM strategy focuses on strategic field placement (identification of high-risk situations), planting TSWV- and thrips-free transplants, planting resistant varieties, monitoring for TSWV symptoms and thrips, roguing infected plants, thrips management targeting early generations, extensive sanitation after harvest, and strategic cropping to avoid overlap with winter bridge crops.","Batuman, Ozgur; Turini, Thomas A; LeStrange, Michelle; Stoddard, Scott; Miyao, Gene; Aegerter, Brenna J; Chen, Li-Fang; McRoberts, Neil; Ullman, Diane E; Gilbertson, Robert L",Pathogens,726,8

Because previous studies had only a limited informative value, we report our data concerning the frequency and location of distal anterior cerebral artery occlusions, recanalization rates, periprocedural complications, and clinical outcome. MATERIALS AND METHODS We performed a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data of patients with acute ischemic stroke undergoing mechanical thrombectomy in the anterior circulation between June 2010 and April 2015. RESULTS Of 368 patients included in this analysis, we identified 30 (8.1%) with either primary (n = 17, 4.6%) or secondary (n = 13, 3.5%) embolic occlusion of the distal anterior cerebral artery. The recanalization rate after placement of a stent retriever was 88%. Periprocedural complications were rare and included vasospasms (n = 3, 10%) and dissection (n = 1, 3.3%). However, 16 (53.5%) patients sustained an (at least partial) infarction of the anterior cerebral artery territory. Ninety days after the ictus, clinical outcome according to the modified Rankin Scale score was the following: 0-2, n = 11 (36.6%); 3-4, n = 9 (30%); 5-6, n = 10 (33.3%). CONCLUSIONS Occlusions of the distal anterior cerebral artery affect approximately 8% of patients with acute ischemic stroke in the anterior circulation receiving mechanical thrombectomy. Despite a high recanalization rate and a low complication rate, subsequent (partial) infarction in the anterior cerebral artery territory occurs in approximately half of patients. Fortunately, clinical outcome appears not to be predominately unfavorable.","Pfaff, J; Herweh, C; Pham, M; Schieber, S; Ringleb, P A; Bendszus, M; Möhlenbruch, M",AJNR.

Structural analysis of flavivirus RdRp domains uncovered two conserved cavities (A and B). Both cavities are located in the thumb subdomains and represent potential targets for development of allosteric inhibitors. In this study, we used dengue virus as a model to analyze the function of the two RdRp cavities. Amino acids from both cavities were subjected to mutagenesis analysis in the context of genome-length RNA and recombinant NS5 protein; residues critical for viral replication were subjected to revertant analysis. For cavity A, we found that only one (Lys-756) of the seven selected amino acids is critical for viral replication. Alanine substitution of Lys-756 did not affect the RdRp activity, suggesting that this residue functions through a nonenzymatic mechanism. For cavity B, all four selected amino acids (Leu-328, Lys-330, Trp-859, and Ile-863) are critical for viral replication. Biochemical and revertant analyses showed that three of the four mutated residues (Leu-328, Trp-859, and Ile-863) function at the step of initiation of RNA synthesis, whereas the fourth residue (Lys-330) functions by interacting with the viral NS3 helicase domain. Collectively, our results have provided direct evidence for the hypothesis that cavity B, but not cavity A, from dengue virus NS5 polymerase could be a target for rational drug design.","Zou, Gang; Chen, Yen-Liang; Dong, Hongping; Lim, Chin Chin; Yap, Li Jian; Yau, Yin Hoe; Shochat, Susana Geifman; Lescar, Julien; Shi, Pei-Yong",The Journal of biological chemistry,726,1

Studies have demonstrated poor symptom control in obese patients undergoing fundoplication. The ideal operation remains elusive. However, addressing both obesity and the anatomic abnormality should be the goal. METHODS This study retrospectively identified 19 obese (body mass index [BMI], >30 kg/m(2)) and morbidly obese (BMI, >40 kg/m(2)) patients who presented between December 2007 and November 2011 for management of large or recurrent paraesophageal hernia. All the patients underwent a combined primary paraesophageal hernia repair and longitudinal gastrectomy. Charts were retrospectively reviewed to collect preoperative, operative, and short-term postoperative results. Quantitative data were analyzed using Student's t test and qualitative data with χ(2) testing. RESULTS Laparoscopy was successful for all 19 patients. The mean preoperative BMI was 37.8 ± 4.1 kg/m(2), and the mean operative time was 236 ± 80 min. Preoperative endoscopy showed that 5 patients who had undergone prior fundoplication experienced anatomic failures, whereas the remaining 14 patients had type 3 and one type 4 paraesophageal Hernia. Mesh was used to reinforce the hiatus in 15 of the 19 cases. The postoperative complications included pulmonary embolism (n = 1) and pulmonary decompensation (n = 2) due to underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The mean hospital stay was 5.3 ± 3 days. Upper gastrointestinal esophagography was performed for all the patients, with no short-term recurrence of paraesophageal hernia. Weight loss was seen for all the patients during the first month, with a mean BMI drop of 2.7 ± 1 kg/m(2). All the patients experienced near to total resolution of their preoperative symptoms within the first month. CONCLUSION Combined laparoscopic paraesophageal hernia repair and longitudinal gastrectomy offer a safe and feasible approach for the management of large or recurrent paraesophageal hernias in well-selected obese and morbidly obese patients. In a short-term follow-up period, this approach demonstrated effective symptom control and weight loss.","Rodriguez, John H; Kroh, Matthew; El-Hayek, Kevin; Timratana, Poochong; Chand, Bipan",Surgical endoscopy,726,12

The essential reason for the microstructural evolution is the cumulative effect of cyclic stress. The Hertz Contact formula is usually adopted to calculate the internal stress, and there is a correlation between the shape and distribution of the feature microstructure and the stress distribution. But it is insufficient to explain the relationship between the morphology of feature microstructures and the rolling direction, such as specific angles in butterfly and white etching bands. The rolling phenomenon will cause the asymmetry of stress distribution in the material, which is the source of the rolling friction coefficient. Moreover, slipping or microslip will produce additional stress components, which also cause the asymmetry of the stress field. However, there is no experimental or theoretical explanation for the relationship between the asymmetry of the stress field and the feature microstructure. According to the current theory, the appearance of feature microstructures is caused by stress with or without rolling. Therefore, it is of great significance to study the formation mechanism: whether feature microstructures will appear in the uniaxial cyclic compression stress field without rolling. In this paper, uniaxial cyclic compressive stress was loaded into a plate-ball system and a cylinder system. The characteristics of microstructural change of bearing steel (GCr15) were studied. It was found that the hardness of the material increased after the cyclic compressive load, and the inclusions interacted with the matrix material. In the local microregion a white etching area was found, although the scale is very small. No large-scale feature microstructures appeared. Other phenomena in the experiment are also described and analyzed. For example, the production of oil film in the contact area and the changing law of alternating load.","Zheng, Xiaomeng; Zhang, Yongzhen; Du, Sanming",Materials,726,1

Given the high risk of incarceration, obstruction and associated mortality, surgical repair is recommended. PRESENTATION OF CASE We present a novel technique for laparoscopic repair of paraduodenal hernia using biosynthetic mesh to reinforce suture closure of the hernia defect. An 18-year-old healthy female presented with symptoms of recurrent subacute small bowel obstruction and right paraduodenal hernia was diagnosed on computed tomography (CT). Laparoscopic repair was performed with reinforcement of suture repair with GORE® BIO-A® Hiatal Tissue Reinforcement to decrease the risk of recurrence. The patient had an uneventful recovery and was discharged on the second post-operative day. Subsequent follow-up revealed complete resolution of symptoms. DISCUSSION Biosynthetic tissue reinforcement carries a lower theoretical risk of erosion than permanent mesh. A hiatal-shaped prosthesis represents a suitable shape for paraduodenal hernia repair. CONCLUSION We present the first reported use of bioabsorbable mesh to repair paraduodenal hernia. This technique may minimise risk of mesh erosion and can be considered a safe and effective approach where suture repair is inadequate due to large defect size.","Kwan, Bianca; Theodore, Jane E; Wong, Jason",International journal of surgery case reports,726,16

Thus hundreds of oleanane triterpenoids have been synthesized and patented. Also many oleanane saponins have been patented for their biological activities and possible pharmaceutical use. Areas covered: Patents reporting the biological activities of oleanane derivatives and saponins with oleanane-type aglycones were examined. Among the synthesized oleanane derivatives, the most promising seem to be 2-cyano-3,12-dioxoolean-1,9(11)-dien-28-oic acid derivatives which interfere with many pathways involved in inflammation, oxidative stress and cell proliferation. Regarding oleanane-type saponins, several patents claiming their antiproliferative activity or their possible use as adjuvants in vaccines, were reported. Expert opinion: Despite the great number of synthesized oleanane triterpenoids, only CDDO-Me entered clinical development as a possible drug for the treatment of chronic kidney disease (CKD) but a phase 3 clinical trial was terminated due to heart-related adverse effects. Further phase 2 clinical trials of CDDO-Me are in progress for the treatment of CKD and PAH (pulmonary arterial hypertension) patients without heart-related risk factors. Additional investigations leading to compounds with an improved activity/toxicity profile along with well-designed preclinical and clinical trials are needed.

We employ molecular dynamics (MD) simulations for a detailed atomistic study of lipid monolayers composed of both pure zwitterionic dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) and a mixture of DPPC and cationic cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) at the air/water interface. We aim to investigate how the composition of the DPPC/CTAB monolayers affects their structural and electrostatic properties in the liquid-expanded phase. By varying the molar fraction of CTAB, we found the cationic CTAB lipids have significant condensing effect on the DPPC/CTAB monolayers, i.e., at the same surface tension or surface pressure, monolayers with higher CTAB molar fraction have smaller area per lipid. The DPPC/CTAB monolayers are also able to achieve negative surface tension without introducing buckling into the monolayer structure. We also found the condensing effect is caused by the interplay between the cationic CTAB headgroups and the zwitterionic phosphatidylcholine (PC) headgroups which has electrostatic origin. With CTAB in its vicinity, the P-N vector of PC headgroups reorients from being parallel to the monolayer plane to a more vertical orientation. Moreover, detailed analysis of the structural properties of the monolayers, such as the density profile analysis, hydrogen bonding analysis, chain order parameter calculations, and radial distribution function calculations were also performed for better understanding of cationic DPPC/CTAB monolayers.","Liu, Bin; Hoopes, Matthew I; Karttunen, Mikko",The journal of physical chemistry.

Three mixing ratios were used to investigate composting performance: no synthetic amendment (T0), 5% synthetic amendment (T1), and 10% synthetic amendment (T2) (T1 and T2 were measured as a wet weight ratio). There were no significant differences in the fundamental characteristics between composting products in T0 and T1. The moisture content of composting material in T0, T1, and T2 significantly decreased from a baseline of approximately 65% to 35.5%, 37.3%, and 55.9%, respectively. Meanwhile, the germination index significantly increased to 111.6%, 155.6%, and 62.3%, respectively. When an optimal proportion of synthetic amendment was added, T1 showed high degree of humification, lignocellulase activities, and effective biodegradation. Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, and Bacteroidetes were the dominant bacteria, while Ascomycota and Basidiomycota were the dominant fungi in all treatment groups. Amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism, glycolysis, starch, and sucrose metabolism were among the primary pathways in predicted functions. The synthetic amendment can generate a mature composting product and can be reused or recycled to conserve resources.","Cai, Lu; Cao, Meng-Ke; Chen, Tong-Bin; Guo, Han-Tong; Zheng, Guo-Di",Waste management,726,17

The use of sensitive molecular methods that can simultaneously detect a large panel of respiratory viruses may help better define their effects. METHODS Lung transplant recipients undergoing serial surveillance and diagnostic bronchoalveolar lavages (BALs) during a period of 3 years were enrolled. BAL samples underwent multiplex testing for a panel of 19 respiratory viral types/subtypes using the Luminex xTAG respiratory virus panel assay. RESULTS Demographics, symptoms, and forced expiratory volume in 1 sec were prospectively collected for 93 lung transplant recipients enrolled. Mean number of BAL samples was 6.2+/-3.1 per patient. A respiratory virus was isolated in 48 of 93 (51.6%) patients on at least one BAL sample. Of 81 positive samples, the viruses isolated included rhinovirus (n=46), parainfluenza 1 to 4 (n=17), coronavirus (n=11), influenza (n=4), metapneumovirus (n=4), and respiratory syncytial virus (n=2). Biopsy-proven acute rejection (> or =grade 2) or decline in forced expiratory volume in 1 sec > or =20% occurred in 16 of 48 (33.3%) patients within 3 months of RVI when compared with 3 of 45 (6.7%) RVI-negative patients within a comparable time frame (P=0.001). No significant difference was seen in incidence of acute rejection between symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. Biopsy-proven obliterative bronchiolitis or BOS was diagnosed in 10 of 16 (62.5%) patients within 1 year of infection. CONCLUSION Community-acquired RVIs are frequently detected in BAL samples from lung transplant patients. In a significant percentage of patients, symptomatic or asymptomatic viral infection is a trigger for acute rejection and obliterative bronchiolitis/BOS.","Kumar, Deepali; Husain, Shahid; Chen, Maggie Hong; Moussa, George; Himsworth, David; Manuel, Oriol; Studer, Sean; Pakstis, Diana; McCurry, Kenneth; Doucette, Karen; Pilewski, Joseph; Janeczko, Richard; Humar, Atul",Transplantation,726,16

The purpose of this study was to see whether we could reduce their incidence after embolization of unruptured cerebral aneurysms by modification of our coiling technique, which involves the deliberate aspiration of the microcatheter lumen right after delivery of each detachable coil into the aneurysm sac. MATERIALS AND METHODS From January 2011 to June 2011, all 71 patients with unruptured cerebral aneurysms were treated using various endovascular methods. During the earlier period, 37 patients were treated using our conventional embolization technique (conventional period). Then 34 patients were treated with a modified coiling technique (modified period). DWI was obtained on the following day. We compared the occurrence of any DWI HSI lesions and the presence of the symptomatic lesions during the two time periods. RESULTS The incidence of the DWI HSI lesions differed significantly at 89.2% (33/37) during the conventional period and 26.5% (9/34) during the modified period (p < 0.0001). The incidence of symptomatic lesions differed between the two periods (29.7% during the conventional period vs. 2.9% during the modified period, p < 0.003). CONCLUSION Aspiration of the inner content of the microcatheter right after detachable coil delivery was helpful for the reduction of the incidence of microembolisms after endovascular coil embolization for the treatment of unruptured cerebral aneurysms.","Kim, Dae Yoon; Park, Jung Cheol; Kim, Jae Kyun; Sung, Yu Sub; Park, Eun Suk; Kwak, Jae Hyuk; Choi, Choong-Gon; Lee, Deok Hee",Neurointervention,726,1

Unlike standard endovascular treatments used to exclude directly the aneurysm bulge from the parent vessel, FDS induce reduction in the intra-aneurysmal flow and promote progressive and stable thrombosis therein. The advent of FDS has therefore increased the need for understanding of IA hemodynamics. METHODS We proposed the use of the most recently evolved four-dimensional (4D) flow MRI technique to evaluate qualitatively and quantitatively post-FDS flow modification in 10 patients. We report intra-aneurysmal velocity measurements and the influence of metal artifacts induced by the stent. RESULTS An index was defined to quantitatively measure flow changes-namely, the proportional velocity reduction ratio (PVRR)-with ranges from 34.6% to 71.1%. Furthermore, we could compare streamlines characterizing the post-stent flow patterns in five patients in whom the intra-aneurysmal velocity was beyond the visualization threshold of 7.69 cm/s. CONCLUSIONS Despite metal artifacts and the low velocities involved, 4D flow MRI could be of interest to measure qualitatively and quantitatively flow changes in stented aneurysms. However, further enhancements are required together with further validation work before it can be considered for clinical use.","Pereira, Vitor Mendes; Brina, Olivier; Delattre, Benedicte M A; Ouared, Rafik; Bouillot, Pierre; Erceg, Gorislav; Schaller, Karl; Lovblad, Karl-Olof; Vargas, Maria-Isabel",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,726,1

Previous researchers confused their own models' assumptions that these risks were independent with the idea that their analyses validated the presence of independent risks. This study avoids this pitfall. METHODS Cross-sectional analyses of the 2014-2019 National Health Interview Surveys (N=175,546) were conducted in 2020. RESULTS Logistic regressions found that e-cigarette use was associated with having had a myocardial infarction, but this association significantly varied on the basis of one's smoking history. With a host of demographic and clinical variables controlled, e-cigarette use was associated with lifetime myocardial infarction occurrence only among current smokers. A counterfactual analysis first removed all (current or former) e-cigarette‒using respondents who had suffered a myocardial infarction without a history of smoking. The independent-effects model used in previous research misleadingly indicated that daily vaping increases never smokers odds of having had a myocardial infarction by 1.55 (95% CI=1.11, 2.15), even though no such myocardial infarction sufferers remained in the analyzed data. The association between myocardial infarction and vaping daily has shown a significant annual decline (AOR=0.81, 95% CI=0.67, 0.98). CONCLUSIONS There is no reliable evidence that e-cigarette use is associated with ever having had a myocardial infarction among never smokers. Contrary to concerns that the harms associated with e-cigarettes are only now emerging after more years of possible product use, the only evidence of time-dependent variation in the association between e-cigarette use and myocardial infarction ran counter to this possibility. The scientific community must insist that researchers engage in accurate public communication of peer-reviewed findings.","Critcher, Clayton R; Siegel, Michael",American journal of preventive medicine,726,10

A significant fraction of MSW is comprised from food waste, the treatment of which is still a challenge. Therefore, the conventional disposal of food waste in landfills is being gradually replaced by recycling aerobic treatment, anaerobic digestion and waste-to-energy. In principle, thermal processes like combustion and gasification are preferred for the recovery of energy due to the higher electrical efficiency and the significantly less time required for the process to be completed when compared to biological process, i.e. composting, anaerobic digestion and transesterification. Nonetheless, the high water content and the molecular structure of biowaste are constraining factors in regard to the application of thermal conversion pathways. Investigating alternative solutions for the pre-treatment and more energy efficient handling of this waste fraction may provide pathways for the optimization of the whole process. In this study, by means of utilizing drying/milling as an intermediate step, thermal treatment of household biowaste has become possible. Household biowaste has been thermally processed in a bench scale reactor by means of torrefaction, carbonization and high temperature pyrolysis. According to the operational conditions, fluctuating fractions of biochar, bio-oil (tar) and syngas were recovered. The thermochemical properties of the feedstock and products were analyzed by means of Simultaneous Thermal Analysis (STA), Ultimate and Proximate analysis and Attenuated Total Reflectance (ATR). The analysis of the products shows that torrefaction of dried household biowaste produces an energy dense fuel and high temperature pyrolysis produces a graphite-like material with relatively high yield.","Vakalis, S; Sotiropoulos, A; Moustakas, K; Malamis, D; Vekkos, K; Baratieri, M",Journal of environmental management,726,1

Enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) protocols increase early post-operative recovery rates in surgical patients. The uniqueness of burn injuries and their post-operative care requires developing a specialized protocol, enhanced recovery after burn surgery (ERABS). To develop such a protocol, we need to examine post-operative practices, like time-to-ambulation, and their effect on post-operative complications. We evaluated evidence supporting complications such as graft loss, thrombolytic events, and pain, relating to the timing of post-surgical ambulation. A literature search on early-ambulation and skin-grafting was performed by two independent researchers. No time limit was set for publication dates. Relevant studies relating to ambulation of adult burn patients (>18 years of age) and their post-surgical outcomes were captured using search terms. Of the 888 studies retrieved from the query, 11 were used for review and meta-analysis. Our review revealed minimal evidence exists relating to thromboembolic events and time-to-ambulation in post-operative burn patients. The evidence that does exist found no significant difference in the number of events between early- and late-ambulation groups. Increased pain during rest and ambulation was shown in patients with delayed ambulation after five or more days. One study found an increased infection rate in late-ambulatory patients. The primary conclusion from this review is that further studies must be performed examining the correlation of thromboembolic events and infection rates with post-operative time-to-ambulation. Based on current literature, early ambulation should be included as part of a future model of ERABS.","Lagziel, Tomer; Ramos, Margarita; Klifto, Kevin M; Seal, Stella M; Hultman, Charles S; Asif, Mohammed",Cureus,726,26

The initial step of SARS-CoV-2 infection is the binding of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) in its spike protein to ACE2 receptor in host cell membrane. The evolving of SARS-CoV-2 constantly generates new mutations across its genome including RBD. Besides the well-known single mutation in RBD, the recent new mutation strains with RBD “double mutation” is causing new outbreaks globally, as represented by the delta strain containing RBD L452R/T478K. Although it is considered that the increased transmissibility of the double mutated strains could be attributed to the alteration of mutated RBD to ACE2 receptor, the molecular details remains to be unclear. Using the methods of molecular dynamics simulation, superimposed structural comparison, free binding energy estimation and antibody escaping, we investigated the relationship between ACE2 receptor and the RBD double mutant L452R/T478K (delta), L452R/E484Q (kappa) and E484K/N501Y (beta, gamma). The results demonstrated that each of the three RBD double mutants altered RBD structure, led to enhanced binding affinity of mutated RBD to ACE2 receptor, leading to increased transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 to the host cells.","Sinha, Siddharth; Tam, Benjamin; Wang, San Ming",bioRxiv,726,26

In Brazil, the disease had its first case in the city of São Paulo, thus being the starting point and epicenter of this disease in Latin America. Neurological features are currently well recognized in COVID-19 indicating the neurotropic nature of the virus and include anosmia, myalgia, myositis, encephalitis, meningitis, cerebrovascular disease, Guillain-Barré syndrome, and postinfectious myelitis. CNS tumors though relatively rare (&gt; 2% of all cancers) are a relevant source of cancer-related morbimortality worldwide. Although studies have reported higher COVID-19 severity in cancer patients, the consequences of the pandemic on health care for CNS tumors remain inconclusive and will probably be felt for decades. This study aimed to determine the impact of pandemic on the hospital admissions (HA) due to CNS tumors in the city of São Paulo, Brazil. Methods: This is a cross-sectional study of the HAs due to CNS tumors in the city of São Paulo comparing the outbreak period (January-June 2020) and a prepandemic corresponding period of the years 2017-2019. Data were obtained from the Brazilian Unified Health System - Hospital Information System database according to the chapter II of the International Classification of Diseases - 10th revision (ICD-10). Linear regression was used to analyze the relationship between the incidence of HAs and time (months). Results: A significant reduction in HAs due to CNS tumors was observed during the outbreak period (January-June 2020). Benign neoplasm of brain and other parts of CNS (-2, CI -2 to -1) and malignant neoplasm of brain (-5, CI -7 to -3) showed to be remarkably affected (see table). To our knowledge, this is the first scientific report of significant reduction of HAs due to CNS tumors during COVID-19 era. Conclusions: Our findings seem to be associated to delayed oncological diagnose and care to CNS tumor patients during the lockdown and health system collapse. A rebound helpseeking effect as well as more severe complications may present in the post- pandemic. Further studies are needed to evaluate the impact of the ongoing pandemic in CNS neoplasms in order to strategically corroborate public health actions for short- and long-term implications of COVID-19 pandemic.","Portugal, I.

These results allow us to conclude that confinement has meant a modification of physical activity practice habits and a decrease in the recommended values of healthy healthy, and therefore has had implications on health and quality of life. This information will help to understand these new behaviors in order for managers to implement innovative strategies to reactivate the return to previous levels of physical activity, its increase and, in short, the reactivation of the sports sector. © 2021 Federacion Espanola de Docentes de Educacion Fisica.

There is emerging evidence that supports the use of videolaryngoscope guided awake intubation. Videolaryngoscopes have become widely available and consequently easy to use and familiar to anaesthetists, allowing for observed tube placement and fixed wide view of the glottis throughout the intubation procedure. This article summarizes the key points and provides answers to the main audience questions from the EAMS March 2021 Webinar. Topics discussed include optimal patient and operator positioning, techniques of applying topical anaesthesia to the airway, testing for adequacy of airway anaesthesia, videolaryngoscope blade insertion and tracheal tube placement and sedation for awake intubation.","Chiesa, P.; Sorbello, M.; Greif, R.; Hodzovic, I.",Trends in Anaesthesia and Critical Care,726,16

Despite this framework, cutting-edge biotechnologies like CRISPR-based diagnostics have yet to be widely implemented in the classroom. To address this gap, we present a freeze-dried CRISPR-Cas12 sensing reaction to complement traditional DNA technology education and teach synthetic biology concepts. The reactions accurately detect Wolbachia from arthropod-derived PCR samples in under 2 hours and can be stored at room temperature for over a month without appreciable degradation. The reactions are easy-to-use and cost less than $40 to implement for a classroom of 22 students including the cost of reusable equipment. We see this technology as an accessible way to incorporate synthetic biology education into existing biology curriculum, which will expand biology educational opportunities in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education.","Rybnicky, Grant A.; Dixon, Radeen A.; Kuhn, Robert M.; Karim, Ashty S.; Jewett, Michael C.",bioRxiv,726,16

Due to the global relevance and importance, it is critical to be able to parse through the available information in an efficient and reliant manner to gauge scientific progression and understandings surrounding COVID-19. In this research, abstracts from a corpus of scientific articles are evaluated using different Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, including Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF), Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), and sentiment analysis, to better understand the breadth of extant literature. Results from the analyses show that in the very large corpus datasets, a large group of documents encompasses the overall or dominant general theme. However, the smaller clusters of documents reveal very precise and niche themes. Generalized COVID-19 is the dominant theme present in largest clusters. Smaller clusters include more specific terms (e.g., popular drugs, popular terms, key features/impacts related to COVID). With the resulting clusters, sentiment analysis was run to discover slight fluctuations over time depending on cluster with an overall relatively neutral sentiment. Overall, the precision of the BERT clusters distinguishes niche topics within the large corpus of literature and enables interesting and meaningful text analytics. (c) 2021 The Authors.

The purpose of this paper is to predict the hospital charges of a patient before being admitted. This will help a patient who is getting admitted: “electively” can plan his/her finance. Also, this can be used as a tool by payers (insurance companies) to better forecast the amount that a patient might claim.Design/methodology/approachThis research method involves secondary data collected from New York state’s patient discharges of 2017. A stratified sampling technique is used to sample the data from the population, feature engineering is done on categorical variables. Different regression techniques are being used to predict the target value “total charges.”FindingsTotal cost varies linearly with the length of stay. Among all the machine learning algorithms considered, namely, random forest, stochastic gradient descent (SGD) regressor, K nearest neighbors regressor, extreme gradient boosting regressor and gradient boosting regressor, random forest regressor had the best accuracy with R2 value 0.7753. “Age group” was the most important predictor among all the features.Practical implicationsThis model can be helpful for patients who want to compare the cost at different hospitals and can plan their finances accordingly in case of “elective” admission. Insurance companies can predict how much a patient with a particular medical condition might claim by getting admitted to the hospital.Originality/valueHealth care can be a costly affair if not planned properly. This research gives patients and insurance companies a better prediction of the total cost that they might incur.","Kulkarni, Suraj Ambekar Suhas Suresh Hudnurkar Manoj",International Journal of Innovation Science,726,20

A. fumigatus plays an important role in the environment as a decomposer of plant material, but is also an opportunistic human lung pathogen. Infection with drug-resistant spores can lead to a worse clinical outcome for the patient. On the first four solstice and equinox days between June 2018 and June 2019, volunteers were asked to collect air samples from their homes and workplaces and return them to our lab in Freepost envelopes. An additional round of samples was requested from volunteer’s gardens and/or compost on the June 2019 solstice. In total, 787 volunteers returned 2,132 air samples and 509 soil samples, which grew a total of 7,991 A. fumigatus colonies. The estimated total cost of the study was £2,650; the equivalent of 33 pence per A. fumigatus colony grown. Incorporating citizen science into the environmental surveillance of drug-resistant A. fumigatus allowed for the simultaneous collection of hundreds of environmental samples across the entire UK on the same day.

Currently, it is unclear whether social connectedness declines with age, and what the underlying mechanisms might be, so the role of age in structuring animal social systems remains unresolved. Here, we describe senescent declines in social connectedness using 43 years of data in a wild, individually-monitored population of a long-lived mammal (European red deer, Cervus elaphus). Applying a series of spatial and social network analyses, we demonstrate that these declines likely occur due to a combination of within-individual changes in social behaviour and altered spatial behaviour (smaller home ranges and movements to lower-density, lower-quality areas). These findings demonstrate that behavioural changes can lead older animals to become less socially connected, shedding light on the ecological and evolutionary processes structuring wild animal populations.","Albery, Gregory F; Clutton-Brock, Tim H.; Morris, Alison; Morris, Sean; Pemberton, Josephine M; Nussey, Daniel H; Firth, Josh A",bioRxiv,726,1

Such technologies make it possible to significantly expand the possibilities of using services for remote maintenance and repair complex technical systems by highly qualified specialists. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the need for service representatives of manufacturing enterprises from foreign countries using such funds has increased significantly. Restrictive measures on movement between states limit the possibility of interaction between manufacturers' representatives (without losing the quality of work performed), so AR technology has become virtually uncontested. The article describes augmented reality glasses based on a mobile phone (system ""DAR""), which combines the functions of VR and AR technologies and a low cost of the final product. The proposed solution combines a helmet with a smartphone, which is used to transmit information about the surrounding space and connect the augmented reality elements built on this image. Information about the surrounding space comes to the smartphone screen from stereo cameras equipped with autofocus. It allows the user to transmit the picture with a minimum delay and high quality. The low cost of the final device is ensured by stereo cameras, a module with sensors, and housing for attaching to the user's head. Processing of information about movement, sound transmission, and superposition of augmented reality elements is done using a smartphone. This solution makes it possible to expand AR technology scope for remote maintenance of complex technical systems by highly qualified specialists at remote sites since using a smartphone, and a DAR headset will be sufficient.

However, hypertension and diabetes are chronic diseases with high incidence in Aceh, there is still limited information regarding the demographics and clinical data of COVID-19 patients. This study aims to explain the clinical characteristics, comorbidities, and outcomes of COVID-19 patients. Methods: A retrospective method was used to locate data from the medical record of COVID-19 patients that were admitted to the hospital between March-June 2020. The characteristics demographics, clinical data on admission, and outcomes were extracted from the medical record. In order to determine the comorbid relationship, the chi-square test was used for the laboratory tests and clinical outcomes. Results: A total of 240 patients were included, and more than one-third were male 141 (58.8%) with 20-40 years of age at most (47.5%). Most of the patients had comorbid hypertension (14%) and diabetes mellitus (13. Furthermore, most COVID-19 was mild and very severe degrees respectively, 141 (58.8%) and 31 (12.9%). The patients with recovery are 209 (87.1%) and only 31 (12.9%) died. Lymphopenia, neutropenia, and Degree of severity had a significant relationship with the clinical outcome of COVID-19 (p <0.05). The comorbid and clinical outcome did not show a significant relationship (p> 0.05). Conclusion: Hypertension and diabetes mellitus are the most common comorbid reported in the COVID-19 patients.

Inflammatory features are mostly compatible with macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) observed in other viral infections despite resulting in milder changes. Early detection and treatment of MAS may be associated with a better outcome. However, available criteria for MAS associated with other causes have not been helpful. Objectives: To identify distinct features of MAS associated with COVID-19 using a large database enabling to assess of dynamic changes. Methods: PCR-confirmed hospitalized COVID-19 patients followed between March and September 2020 constituted the discovery set. Patients considered to have findings of MAS by experienced physicians and given anakinra or tocilizumab were classified as the MAS group and the remaining patients as the non-MAS group. The MAS group was then re-grouped as the cases with exact-MAS and borderline-MAS cases by the study group. Clinical and laboratory data including the Ct values of the PCR test were obtained from the database, and dynamic changes were evaluated especially for the first 14 days of the hospitalization. The second set of 162 patients followed between September-December 2020 were used as the replication group to test the preliminary criteria. In the second set, hospitalization rules were changed, and all patients required oxygen support and received dexamethasone 6mg/day or equivalent glucocorticoids. Daily changes were calculated for the laboratory items in MAS, borderline, and non-MAS groups to see the days differentiating the groups, and ROC curves and lower and upper limits (10-90%) of the selected parameters were calculated to determine the cutoff values. Results: A total of 769 PCR-confirmed hospitalized patients were analysed, and 77 of them were classified as MAS and 83 as borderline MAS patients. There was no statistically significant difference in the baseline viral loads of MAS patients compared to the non-MAS group according to the Ct values. Daily dynamic changes in the MAS group differed from the non-MAS group especially around the 6th day of hospitalization, and more than a twofold increase in ferritin and a 1.5-fold increase in D-dimer levels compared to the baseline values help to define the MAS group. Twelve items selected for the criteria are given in Table 1 below. The total score of 45 provided 79.6% sensitivity for the MAS (including borderline cases) and 81.3% specificity around days 5 and 6 in the discovery set, and a score of 60 increased the specificity to 94.9% despite a decrease in sensitivity to 40.8%. The same set provided a similar sensitivity (80.3%) in the replication, but a lower specificity (47.4-66% on days 6 to 9) due to a group of control patients with findings of MAS possibly masked by glucocorticoids. Conclusion: This study defined a set of preliminary criteria using the most relevant items of MAS according to the dynamic changes in the parameters in a group of COVID-19 patients. A score of 45 would be helpful to define a possible MAS group with reasonable sensitivity and specificity to start necessary treatments as early as possible.","Amikishiyev, S.; Gunver, M.

A lot of open-source segmentation and recognition methods are compared comprehensively on the DV1 using multiple evaluations, and the best among them are exploited to conduct ablation studies on each subset. Experimental results show that even the best deep learning frameworks are not robust enough on the database, and further improvements are recommended for challenging factors such as half-open eyes, off-Angle, and pupil dilation.

COVID 19 has triggered a boom in the digital education implementation. Those courses that never had been delivered in a digital format, suddenly were forced to be prepared and presented as digital education. The nature of different courses might facilitate this new reality, depending if they are theoretical, numerical or mixed. This paper has evaluated a set of characteristics deployed in different engineering courses transformed into digital courses, depending on its nature. On the other hand, this analysis had a focus on the women participation in engineering courses and their evaluations of such digital course's characteristics. The main purpose of the present paper is to answer the question of what characteristics within the course methodology design, works and are evaluated better by students. A survey was designed and applied to the 87% of the Industrial and Systems Engineering program population in Tecnologico de Monterrey, Sonora Mexico. Data was statistically analyzed to find if there were any difference between female and male opinions about the course characteristics and within each gender in each kind of course. Also, a correlation analysis was made to identify how the elements influenced each other and if they should be combined depending on the desired result. An additional analysis took place to identify the level of participation of female and male students before and during pandemic time. Findings reveal interesting coincidences and differences in evaluating some of those digital course's characteristics depending on the gender of students and course nature, such as women participation and the differences in perception of competitiveness among women and men. Some of these findings are: 1) In mixed subjects, male students identify a higher academic environment that encourages more competitiveness than female students. 2) Another finding is that men seem to have greater motivation to attend class sessions in numerical subjects. 3) Among female students a negative correlation between the frequency of the instructor request of a final reflection analysis of the session with considering a competitiveness academic environment. 4) Talking about mixed courses, all female students evaluated with the highest score in the question about motivation to be present in the session and the identification of moments and activities that allowed them to share opinions. To reinforce women participation in Industrial and Systems Engineering digital courses, those identified characteristics shall be included and developed in the course methodology design. © 2021 IEEE.","Forte-Celaya, M.

(Special Issue: SARS-CoV-2.),11.506761,9.894773,2020,"Improved sample preparation has the potential to address a huge unmet need for fast turnaround sepsis tests that enable early administration of appropriate antimicrobial therapy. In recent years, inertial and elasto-inertial microfluidics-based sample preparation has gained substantial interest for bioparticle separation applications. However, for applications in blood stream infections the throughput and bacteria separation efficiency has thus far been limited. In this work, for the first time we report elasto-inertial microfluidics-based bacteria isolation from blood at throughputs and efficiencies unparalleled with current microfluidics-based state of the art. In the method, bacteria-spiked blood sample is prepositioned close to the outer wall of a spiral microchannel using a viscoelastic sheath buffer. The blood cells will remain fully focused throughout the length of the channel while bacteria migrate to the inner wall for effective separation. Initially, particles of different sizes were used to investigate particle focusing and the separation performance of the spiral device. A separation efficiency of 96% for the 1 µm particles was achieved, while 100% of 3 µm particles were recovered at the desired outlet at a high throughput of 1 mL/min. Following, processing blood samples revealed a minimum of 1:2 dilution was necessary to keep the blood cells fully focus at the outer wall. In experiments involving bacteria spiked in diluted blood, viable E.coli were continuously separated at a total flow rate of 1 mL/min, with an efficiency between 82 to 90% depending on the blood dilution. Using a single spiral, it takes 40 minutes to process 1 mL of blood at a separation efficiency of 82% and 3 hours at 90% efficiency. To the best of our knowledge, this is the highest blood sample throughput per single microfluidic chip reported for the corresponding separation efficiency. As such, the label-free, passive and high throughput bacteria isolation method has a great potential for speeding up downstream phenotypic and molecular analysis of bacteria.","Iyengar, Sharath Narayana; Kumar, Tharagan; Mårtensson, Gustaf; Russom, Aman",bioRxiv,726,1

The current study examined self-reported challenges in daily routines and T1D care in a sample of EAs during the COVID-19 pandemic. Method: Participants included 22 EAs with T1D (M age=21.6±1.1 yrs;45.4% male;40.9% non-Hispanic white;86.4% enrolled in higher education;77.3% employed;M A1c=7.8%±1.2%). EAs completed surveys about exposure/personal impact of COVID-19 (n=13), a structured interview (n=2), or both (n=7) during the first 9 months of the COVID-19 pandemic (3/2020 - 11/2020). Results: Most EAs (86.4%) denied COVID-19 symptoms, diagnoses, or hospitalizations in themselves or close contacts;3 EAs (13.6%) reported COVID-19 diagnoses in family members, with one reported death of a family member. Fifty-five percent of EAs reported strictly social distancing. On the survey, 85% of EAs reported significant disruptions due to COVID-19, including job loss/reduction in hours (45%), education changes (45%), and moving (40%). T1D impact varied, with 50% reporting easier management of T1D;30% reporting less exercise/worse diet;30% reporting sleep problems;and 40% reporting more health anxiety. For EAs with more than one instance of survey completion (n=9), diabetes-specific impact worsened over time (t(8)=-2.20, p=.06;Cohen's d = -.72). Interview data (n=9) supported quantitative results, with themes related to the impact of COVID-19 on daily routines for T1D management and delayed transition to adult T1D care. Discussion: EAs with T1D experienced many COVID-related changes and increasing negative impact on T1D self-care over time. EAs may be particularly vulnerable to the widespread impacts of COVID-19 on employment, education, and receipt of medical care. Future research should examine longitudinal responses to the COVID-19 pandemic to identify EAs who may need additional support or resources for T1D care.","Monaghan, Maureen Bryant Breana Wang Christine H.",Diabetes,726,16

Objective: The aim of the study was to examine the quality of interpersonal communication among family members during COVID-19 restrictions in Saudi Arabia. The study objective was achieved through investigating the three main questions: How is the pandemic influencing the connection and communication between the family members? How do the family members stay connected during the COVID-19 restrictions in Saudi Arabia? And lastly, what type of social media platforms are families using to stay connected with each other? Methodology: The present research used a Google survey form as a tool to receive responses from 400 participants in Saudi Arabia. Results The results have shown that COVID-19 has greatly affected people's interactions, including family interpersonal communication. Families have been forced to adapt modern forms of communication rather than indulging in normal face-to-face interactions, as various governments across the world encourage virtual communication. Conclusion: IMO has become very popular among various family members;however, some other applications have also been used to stay connected with the family, like Twitter, Facebook, and WhatsApp.","Ades, A.",Open Public Health Journal,726,1

The purpose of this study was to investigate the common and atypical symptoms of COVID-19 among the patients admitted to the otorhinolaryngology (ENT) outpatient clinic. Materials and Methods: This case series was conducted with 49 patients who applied to hospital between April 1, 2020 and April 30, 2020. Common and atypical otolaryngologic al findings were recorded. Sociodemographic findings and blood parameters were also evaluated. Results: Of the patients, 59.18% were aged 40 and over, 46.94% were of the A blood group, 55.10% were male and 24.49% were smokers, 51.02% had a chronic disease. Among typical symptoms;fever (71.43%), a dry cough (46.94%), shortness of breath (42.86%) was seen. Diarrhea (48.98%), runny nose (51.02%), nasal congestion (42.85%), sore throat (22.44%), headaches (32.65%), 18.36% olfactory disorder, 26.53% gustatory disturbance were noted.

The SARS-CoV-2 virus infects the host human cells through its surface receptors human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2). This study aims to investigate the effects of high glucose on the expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 receptors using macrophage (CD14+ve cells) as a biomarker in vivo and human endothelial cells in vitro. Methods: Mononuclear cells were isolated by Ficoll density centrifuge method from whole blood. CD14 cells were isolated from MNCs by MACS kit. The migratory capacity of CD14 cells was evaluated using the CytoSelect Migration Assay kit. CFU-Hill colony formation assay was also done on MNCs. In vitro studies using HUVEC were done by culturing the cells in normal glucose (NG, 5.5mmol/L) or high glucose (HG, 20 mmol/L), followed by mRNA assays at day 3 and 7. Results: All the COVID patients had high glucose levels (>300 mg/dl). The migratory function of CD14 cells show moderately increased migration compared to similar hematopoietic cells from nondiabetic COVID negative patients. In general, CD14 cells showed low expression of ACE2 and/or TMPRSS2 in all samples. For our in-vitro experiments using cultured HUVEC mRNA expression of ACE2 and/or TMPRSS2 receptors were higher in HG compared to NG at day 7. No expression was observed at day 3 either in NG or HG. An elevated gene expression of inflammatory marker, IL-6 and apoptosis marker, P53 were observed in HG at both days 3 and 7. Conclusions: A low expression of SARS-CoV-2 receptors were observed on CD14 macrophage cells from patients which may indicate poor recognition of the virus particle by CD14 cells. Higher expression of the SARS-CoV-2 receptors were noted when HUVEC cells were cultured in HG for 7 days.","Nandula, Seshagiri Rao Janapala Rajesh Naidu Sen Sabyasachi",Diabetes,726,13

OBJECTIVE To assess the effects of dexamethasone 12 mg versus 6 mg daily in patients with COVID-19 and severe hypoxia. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS We conducted a parallel-grouped, stratified, blinded randomized trial including 1000 adults with confirmed COVID-19 receiving at least 10 l/min of oxygen or mechanical ventilation in 26 hospitals in Europe and India from August 2020 to May 2021. INTERVENTIONS Patients were randomized 1:1 to masked intravenous dexamethasone 12 mg or dexamethasone 6 mg daily for up to 10 days. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The primary outcome was the number of days alive without life support (i.e. invasive mechanical ventilation, circulatory support or renal replacement therapy) at 28 days. The primary analysis was adjusted for the stratification variables (site, age above 70 years and invasive mechanical ventilation). RESULTS After exclusion of 18 patients who withdrew consent, there were 982 patients in the intention-to-treat population; 613 in Europe and 369 in India. We had primary outcome data for 971 patients; 491 assigned to dexamethasone 12 mg and 480 assigned to dexamethasone 6 mg. The median number of days alive without life support at 28 days was 22.0 days (interquartile range 6.0-28.0) in the 12 mg group and 20.5 days (4.0-28.0) in the 6 mg group (adjusted mean difference 1.3 days, 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.0-2.6; P=0.066). Mortality at 28 days was 27.1% and 32.3% in patients assigned to 12 mg and 6 mg, respectively (adjusted relative risk 0.86, 99% CI, 0.68-1.08). Serious adverse reactions, including septic shock and invasive fungal infections, occurred in 11.7% versus 13.6% of patients in the 12 mg group and 6 mg group, respectively (adjusted relative risk 0.85, 99% CI, 0.56-1.31). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among patients with COVID-19 and severe hypoxia, dexamethasone 12 mg did not result in statistically significant more days alive without life support at 28 days than dexamethasone 6 mg. However, the confidence interval around the point estimate should be considered when interpreting the importance of the trial.","The COVID STEROID 2 trial investigators,; Perner, A.",,726,1

The three mechanisms are: 1) The lateral ankle mechanism, an active modulation of ankle inversion/eversion in stance; 2) The foot placement mechanism, an active shift of the swing foot placement; and 3) The push-off mechanism, an active modulation of the ankle plantarflexion angle during double stance. Here we seek to determine whether there are changes in neural control of balance when walking at different cadences and speeds. Twenty-one healthy young adults walked on a self-paced treadmill while immersed in a 3D virtual reality cave, and periodically received balance perturbations (bipolar galvanic vestibular stimulation) eliciting a perceived fall to the side. Subjects were instructed to match two cadences specified by a metronome, 110bpm (High) and 80bpm (Low), which led to faster and slower gait speeds, respectively. The results indicate that subjects altered the use of the balance mechanisms at different cadences. The lateral ankle mechanism was used more in the Low condition, while the foot placement mechanism was used more in the High condition. There was no difference in the use of the push-off mechanism between cadence conditions. These results suggest that neural control of balance is altered when gait characteristics such as cadence change, suggesting a flexible balance response that is sensitive to the constraints of the gait cycle. We speculate that the use of the balance mechanisms may be a factor resulting in well-known characteristics of gait in populations with compromised balance control, such as slower gait speed in older adults or higher cadence in people with Parkinson’s disease.","Fettrow, Tyler; Reimann, Hendrik; Grenet, David; Crenshaw, Jeremy; Higginson, Jill; Jeka, John",bioRxiv,726,10

For effective inactivation strategies, design and implementation of UVC disinfection, knowledge of wavelength sensitivity, and disinfection rate of the relevant pathogen are required. This study aimed to determine the inactivation profile of SARS-CoV-2 using UVC irradiation with different wavelengths, in addition to validating surrogate models for SARS-CoV-2. Specifically, the study determined dosage, inactivation levels, and wavelength sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2. Assessment of SARS-CoV-2 (Strain USA/WA1-2020) inactivation at peak wavelength of 259, 268, 270, 275 and 280 nm was performed using plaque assay method. The UVC dose of 3.1 mJ/cm2 using 259 and 268 nm arrays yielded LRV2.32 and LRV2.44 respectively. With a dose of 5mJ/cm2, arrays of peak wavelengths at 259 and 268 nm obtained similar inactivation (LRV2.97 and LRV 2.80 respectively). The remaining arrays of longer wavelength, 270, 275 and 280 nm, demonstrated lower performances (LRV2.0 or less) with 5mJ/cm2. Additional study with the 268 nm array revealed that a dose of 6.25 mJ/cm2 (with 5 seconds or irradiation) is enough to obtain LRV3. These results determine that 259 and 268 nm are the most efficient wavelengths compared to longer UVC wavelengths, allowing the calculation of disinfection systems efficacy, and providing a benchmark for surrogates.","Mariita, R.

Objective: To examine glucose trends surrounding cardiac arrest events to evaluate the performance of CGM sensors during severe clinical instability. Methods: We reviewed eight cases of patients with type 2 diabetes diagnosed with COVID-19 requiring ICU care on IV insulin and CGM therapy experiencing severe clinical decompensation leading to cardiac arrest. Index events (cardiac arrest) were identified by staff documentation in the electronic health record. Clinical characteristics, mean arterial pressure (MAP), and point-of-care (POC) glucose values surrounding the index event were collected. CGM data was paired with MAP and POC glucose values. Rapid declines in the glucose trend [rate of change (ROC) ≥3mg/dl/min] were identified during this time of clinical instability. Results: The mean age of patients was 61.3±13.8 years. All patients were treated with steroid therapy, vasopressors, and mechanical ventilation. 62.5% were on CRRT. Four (50%) patients had sudden cardiac arrest and drop in MAP, while the other four patients had a more prolonged decline in MAP prior to cardiac arrest. CGM values in those with sudden arrest showed an abrupt decline (≥3mg/dl/min) an average of 16.7±13.7 min following cardiac arrest. Rapid down trending of CGM values in those with prolonged hypotension occurred on average about 6 hours prior to cardiac arrest. During these episodes, the CGM values stopped correlating with POC tests. Conclusions: Real-time CGM in critically-ill patients may provide clinical information beyond glucose control. Rapid declines in CGM values (≥3mg/dl/min) not correlating with POC glucose testing are associated with both sudden and prolonged changes in arterial pressure.","Hester, Joi Davis Georgia M.; Pasquel, Francisco J.; Rabinovich, Marina Poindexter Norma Tekwani Seema",Diabetes,726,5

The Covid-19 pandemic has had significant social impacts, such as the sudden interruption of basic education activities in Brazil, due to the need for social isolation. Brazilian basic education comprehends schooling from early childhood education (similarly to kindergarten and preschool in other countries) and elementary school (1st–9th grades) to high school (10th–12th grades). Measures taken as precautions have demanded an overhaul of the teaching systems, pedagogical structures, and strategies for interaction, almost all of these being involved in a teaching process that is mediated by digital technologies. Therefore, one asks just how Physical Education teachers and their respective teaching networks get organized when faced with social isolation, with regard to work strategies for ways to relate to knowledge. The main objective of this article is analysing the pedagogical experiences of teacher-researchers–teachers from state-owned schools and university researchers–in four Brazilian states, namely Ceará, Pará, Rio Grande do Norte and São Paulo, in order to discuss the implications upon Physical Education in schools, as a way to tackle the pandemic through social isolation. This is an exploratory and descriptive study that makes use of narratives. It also includes a project for intervention. The design of this analysis is inspired by the methodological structures of pedagogical cases, which includes narrative accounts, the shared analysis of these accounts by different teachers and researchers, and the synthesis of the analyses in the form of a balance of experiences. There are three dimensions that are integrated into the relationship to knowledge–identitary, social and epistemic dimensions–, that are essential for the Physical Education teachers who narrate the situations they have experienced. Here we consider that the educational process must not be reduced to a mere transmission of information through technological resources and digital platforms. One must also accept and acknowledge that complex teaching situations are inserted in the relationships to knowledge. As such, they must not be regarded as generic and fragmented. The purpose of the intervention project is to collaborate with the practices of Physical Education teachers seeking to prevent, identify, and report on cases of Covid-19 among students and their family members. Social isolation has been the most efficient protective measure to reduce the impact of the spread of the virus, but it comes up against problems to be addressed in Brazil, such as subnotification of cases. In this regard, the project makes a significant contribution toward the fight against the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. In a certain way, it connects public health actions and the development of communication aids, as well as applications for building of awareness of prevention of health risks, assistance to the most vulnerable and/or isolated people, prevention of the psychological impacts of the health crisis, and the tackling of violence against children during the confinement. Many are, and many shall be, the impacts of Covid-19 upon Brazil and upon the world as a whole. Apart from health and the economy, the pandemic we now face shall have an influence on our system of values and, hence, on our choices and our way of life. This link also becomes explicit when Paulo Freire views education as a political act, with the main intention of stimulating the potential of understanding reality, or in other words “reading the world”, a condition to take part in the organisation of this world. It would not be possible to take social action without taking sides, without making choices;and these choices are firmly anchored to a socially constructed system of values. According to Paulo Freire, this human action should be conscientious. The main role of the educati nal process should be that of constructing this awareness.

In this paper, statistical models are formulated to study this performance. The models’ specifications include, as the response variable, the GDP variation/growth percentage in 2020, and as the covariates: the COVID-19 disease rate from its start in March 2020 until 31 December 2020;the GHSI of 2019;the countries’ risk by default spreads from July 2019 to May 2020;belongingness or not to the OECD;and the GDP per capita in 2020. We test the heteroscedasticity phenomenon present in the modeling. The variable “COVID-19 cases per million inhabitants” is statistically significant, showing its impact on each country’s economy through the GDP variation.

However, manually labeling data for entity tasks is time consuming and expensive, creating barriers to using machine learning in new medical applications. Weakly supervised learning, which automatically builds imperfect training sets from low cost, less accurate labeling rules, offers a potential solution. Medical ontologies are compelling sources for generating labels, however combining multiple ontologies without ground truth data creates challenges due to label noise introduced by conflicting entity definitions. Key questions remain on the extent to which weakly supervised entity classification can be automated using ontologies, or how much additional task-specific rule engineering is required for state-of-the-art performance. Also unclear is how pre-trained language models, such as BioBERT, improve the ability to generalize from imperfectly labeled data. RESULTS We present Trove, a framework for weakly supervised entity classification using medical ontologies. We report state-of-the-art, weakly supervised performance on two NER benchmark datasets and establish new baselines for two entity classification tasks in clinical text. We perform within an average of 3.5 F1 points (4.2%) of NER classifiers trained with hand-labeled data. Automatically learning label source accuracies to correct for label noise provided an average improvement of 3.9 F1 points. BioBERT provided an average improvement of 0.9 F1 points. We measure the impact of combining large numbers of ontologies and present a case study on rapidly building classifiers for COVID-19 clinical tasks. Our framework demonstrates how a wide range of medical entity classifiers can be quickly constructed using weak supervision and without requiring manually-labeled training data.","Fries, Jason A; Steinberg, Ethan; Khattar, Saelig; Fleming, Scott L; Posada, Jose; Callahan, Alison; Shah, Nigam H",ArXiv,726,19

We hypothesized that by active expiration assistance, larger minute volumes could be generated without causing PEEPi compared with conventional mechanical ventilation when using small-lumen tracheal tubes or a cricothyrotomy catheter. METHODS We investigated the active expiration assistance in a physical model of the respiratory system and estimated its hypothetical performance in terms of maximal flow generated with endotracheal tubes ranging from 3.0 to 8.0 mm inner diameter (ID); with microlaryngeal tubes of 4.0, 5.0, and 6.0 mm ID; and with a cricothyrotomy catheter. Furthermore, we determined the minute volumes that could be achieved without generating PEEPi by ventilating a physical lung model using conventional mechanical ventilation or using active expiration assistance. RESULTS The inspiratory and expiratory flow during active expiration assistance increased with increasing supply flow and decreased with decreasing ID of the connected endotracheal tubes (both P < .001). With small-lumen tracheal tubes, the active expiration assistance generated similar or higher minute volumes than conventional ventilation. Conventional mechanical ventilation with PEEPi <1 cm H2O was not achievable via a microlaryngeal tube of 4.0 mm ID and smaller lumen tubes. CONCLUSIONS For mechanical ventilation via small-lumen tubes or thin catheters, active compensation of airway resistance might be a necessary means to generate adequate minute ventilation without causing PEEPi. Active expiration assistance can generate reasonable respiratory minute volumes via small-lumen tubes or thin catheters.","Wirth, Steffen; Seywert, Luc; Spaeth, Johannes; Schumann, Stefan",Respiratory care,726,26

Many current small molecule calpain inhibitors also inhibit other cysteine proteases, including cathepsins, and need improved selectivity. The specificity of inhibition of several calpains and papain was profiled using synthetic positional scanning libraries of epoxide-based compounds that target the active-site cysteine. These peptidomimetic libraries probe the P4, P3, and P2 positions, display (S,S)- or (R,R)-epoxide stereochemistries, and incorporate both natural and non-natural amino acids. To facilitate library screening, an SDS-PAGE assay that measures the extent of hydrolysis of an inactive recombinant m-calpain was developed. Individual epoxide inhibitors were synthesized guided by calpain-specific preferences observed from the profiles and tested for inhibition against calpain. The most potent compounds were assayed for specificity against cathepsins B, L, and K. Several compounds demonstrated high inhibition specificity for calpains over cathepsins. The best of these inhibitors, WRH(R,R), irreversibly inactivates m- and mu-calpain rapidly (k(2)/K(i) = 131,000 and 16,500 m(-1) s(-1), respectively) but behaves exclusively as a reversible and less potent inhibitor toward the cathepsins. X-ray crystallography of the proteolytic core of rat mu-calpain inactivated by the epoxide compounds WR gamma-cyano-alpha-aminobutyric acid (S,S) and WR allylglycine (R,R) reveals that the stereochemistry of the epoxide influences positioning and orientation of the P2 residue, facilitating alternate interactions within the S2 pocket. Moreover, the WR gamma-cyano-alpha-aminobutyric acid (S,S)-complexed structure defines a novel hydrogen-bonding site within the S2 pocket of calpains.","Cuerrier, Dominic; Moldoveanu, Tudor; Campbell, Robert L; Kelly, Jacqueline; Yoruk, Bilge; Verhelst, Steven H L; Greenbaum, Doron; Bogyo, Matthew; Davies, Peter L",The Journal of biological chemistry,726,9

We wished to determine how frequently oral intake is delayed and the amount of nutrition delivered via the jejunostomy tube. METHODS We reviewed the charts of all adults undergoing esophagectomy for carcinoma between January 2000 and June 2008. We determined the proportion of patients unable to resume oral nutrition after 8 days and the amount of nutrition delivered in each of the 8 days. RESULTS In all, 111 patients underwent elective esophagectomy for carcinoma, and 103 had a jejunostomy tube placed. The mean age was 67 ± 10.8 years. The median time to oral intake was 7 (interquartile range 7-11) days. Seventy-four (67%) patients resumed oral intake within 8 days. The mean nutrition delivered by jejunostomy within the first 8 days as a percentage of the target was 45.6% (95% confidence interval 41.2%-49.9%). Six (5.4%) patients experienced complications attributable solely to the jejunostomy tube; 3 (2.9%) required surgery.

In this study, we sampled bat populations in 15 provinces of China and reveal that approximately 6.5% of the bats, from diverse species distributed throughout the region, harbor coronaviruses. Full genomes of four coronavirues from bats were sequenced and analyzed. Phylogenetic analyses of the spike, envelope, membrane, and nucleoprotein structural proteins and the two conserved replicase domains, putative RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and RNA helicase, revealed that bat coronaviruses cluster in three different groups: group 1, another group that includes all SARS and SARS-like coronaviruses (putative group 4), and an independent bat coronavirus group (putative group 5). Further genetic analyses showed that different species of bats maintain coronaviruses from different groups and that a single bat species from different geographic locations supports similar coronaviruses.

This case series describes gastrointestinal torsion and intussusception in six northern koalas (three males, three females, 2-11 yr old) at the San Diego Zoo from 1976 to 2012. Two koalas died shortly after presentation. Diagnoses of ileocecal intussusception, resulting from enteritis in one case and cecal torsion in the other, were made at postmortem examination. One koala died 4 days after an exploratory laparotomy, with negative findings, and an acute double colonic intussusception was diagnosed at postmortem examination. Two small intestinal mesenteric torsion and one proximal colon mesenteric torsion cases were successfully corrected surgically. In the case of colonic mesenteric torsion, the koala had recurrent clinical signs 2 wk later, and a second surgery requiring resection and anastomosis of ischemic jejunum was performed, with the koala dying shortly afterward. One koala with small intestinal torsion had a recurrence of torsion 22 mo later and subsequently died. The koala with the second case of small intestinal torsion remains alive 14 mo postsurgical correction. All six koalas presented with signs of colic that included anorexia, lethargy, depression, acute abdominal distension, abdominal stretching, decreased fecal output, open-mouth gasping, or a combination of symptoms. Abdominal radiographs may show stacked gastrointestinal linear gas patterns and contrast stasis. Prevalence of torsion and intussusception is low at this institution (2%), although recurrence in individuals is common (50%) and overall survival is poor (83%), which emphasizes the importance of timely recognition, surgical correction, and postoperative management. While inciting etiologies were unable to be determined in these cases, monitoring generalized gastrointestinal health and differing Eucalyptus sp. effects on individual koala's gastrointestinal function, parasite control, and stress minimization through standardized husbandry practices are likely important.","Joyce-Zuniga, Nicole M; Roesler, Jennifer; Andrus, Chris Hamlin; Sutherland-Smith, Meg; Rideout, Bruce A; Pye, Geoffrey W",Journal of zoo and wildlife medicine : official publication of the American Association of Zoo Veterinarians,726,20

AIM To compare the ability of three validated prediction rules for CAP to predict mortality in Hong Kong: the 20 variable Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI), the 6-point CURB65 scale adopted by the British Thoracic Society and the simpler CRB65. METHODS A prospective observational study of 1016 consecutive inpatients with CAP (583 men, mean (SD) age 72 (17) years) was performed in a university hospital in the New Territories of Hong Kong in 2004. The patients were classified into three risk groups (low, intermediate and high) according to each rule. The ability of the three rules to predict 30 day mortality was compared. RESULTS The overall mortality and intensive care unit (ICU) admission rates were 8.6% and 4.0%, respectively. PSI, CURB65 and CRB65 performed similarly, and the areas under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve were 0.736 (95% CI 0.687 to 0.736), 0.733 (95% CI 0.679 to 0.787) and 0.694 (95% CI 0.634 to 0.753), respectively.

OBJECTIVE To evaluate the long-term efficacy of the Willis covered stent in endovascular treatment of complex TDCCFs, focusing on reconstruction and preservation of the internal carotid artery. METHODS During the past 8 years, 25 patients with 27 TDCCFs who previously had unsuccessful treatment of fistulas with detachable balloons received endovascular treatment with Willis covered stents. The efficacy, complications, in-stent stenosis, angiographic, and clinical follow-up results were evaluated retrospectively between 6 and 88 months (mean, 43.8 months) after the stent placement. RESULTS The technical success rate of stenting placement was 100%. Forty-four Willis covered stents were implanted into the target artery of 27 TDCCFs. Complete exclusion was achieved in 16 patients with 17 TDCCFs immediately after the stent placement, with transient endoleaks in 10 TDCCFs. Redilation was performed in 6 TDCCFs, and additional stents were implanted in the other 4 TDCCFs for endoleak exclusion. The initial angiographic results showed complete exclusion of fistulas with preservation of the internal carotid artery in 24 patients with 26 TDCCFs. One patient in whom complete occlusion initially was achieved subsequently experienced a delayed endoleak, which required placement of an additional stent. The angiographic follow-up results (mean, 30.3 months) demonstrated complete exclusion in all 27 TDCCFs, with patency of internal carotid artery in 23 patients. The clinical follow-up demonstrated a full recovery in 23 patients and improvement in 2 patients. CONCLUSION The use of Willis covered stents was confirmed to be effective, safe, and a curative approach for endovascular treatment of complex TDCCFs and internal carotid artery reconstruction.

These include hematogenic penetration, spread along the peripheral nerves, and the olfactory pathway which begins from the infected olfactory neuroepithelial cells. The possibility of viral spread into CNS via the olfactory pathway was shown for the representatives of togaviruses, herpesviruses, coronaviruses, rhabdoviruses, and for some others. This study suggests that the olfactory pathway of viral conveyance into CNS may be blocked by specific mucosal antibodies in the nasal mucosa. The recombinant TK- variant of WR vaccinia strain with inserted genes coding structural and nonstructural proteins of TBE virus is accumulated in the branches of the respiratory tract only while the parenteral vaccinia strain is detected in the brain regions, spleen, respiratory tract, and in blood. The protective activity of recombinant strain and inactivated TBE vaccine after mice immunization by escarification or intranasally, or subcutaneously was comparatively studied. The findings indicate that intranasal immunization by recombinant strain is the most protective against intraperitoneal challenge by TBE virus. The mucosal and humoral immune response that was induced by intranasal immunization seems to provide the highest levels of protection, which was experimentally observed.","Ryzhikov, A B; Goncharova, E P; Bulychev, L E; Sergeev, A N; Dmitriev, I P; Pliasunov, I V; Kotliarov, L A",Vestnik Rossiiskoi akademii meditsinskikh nauk,726,20

According to the current subject knowledge, there are two main axes of the RAAS: (1) angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-angiotensin II-AT1 receptor axis and (2) ACE2-angiotensin-(1-7)-Mas receptor axis. The activation of the first axis leads to deleterious effects, including vasoconstriction, endothelial dysfunction, thrombosis, inflammation, and fibrosis; therefore, blocking the components of this axis is a highly rational and commonly used therapeutic procedure. The ACE2-Ang-(1-7)-Mas receptor axis has a different role, since it often opposes the effects induced by the classical ACE-Ang II-AT1 axis. Once the positive effects of the ACE2-Ang-(1-7)-Mas axis were discovered, the alternative ways of pharmacotherapy activating this axis of RAAS appeared. This article briefly describes new molecules affecting the RAAS, namely: recombinant human ACE2, ACE2 activators, angiotensin-(1-7) peptide and non-peptide analogs, aldosterone synthase inhibitors, and the third and fourth generation of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists. The results of the experimental and clinical studies are encouraging, which leads us to believe that these new molecules can support the treatment of cardiovascular diseases as well as cardiometabolic disorders.","Gromotowicz-Poplawska, Anna; Szoka, Piotr; Kolodziejczyk, Patrycjusz; Kramkowski, Karol; Wojewodzka-Zelezniakowicz, Marzena; Chabielska, Ewa",Experimental biology and medicine,726,11

The performance of these duties places emergency care practitioners (ECPs) at risk of occupationally acquired injuries and communicable diseases. Although legislative guidelines exist for the protection of healthcare workers, little is known about the protective measures available for and utilised by ECPs in the pre-hospital environment in South Africa. OBJECTIVES To review the availability and implementation of emergency medical services (EMS)-specific infection control policies and standard operating procedures in the pre-hospital environment. METHODS Interviews with key informants were used to collect data concerning policies on communicable diseases and infection control in the EMS, the operational aspects of these policies, and educational programmes on communicable diseases and infection control for ECPs. RESULTS There is no national policy on communicable diseases and infection control in EMS. Only KwaZulu-Natal, Eastern Cape and Gauteng have EMS-specific standard operating procedures for communicable diseases and infection control. Formal education and in-service training is limited. CONCLUSIONS A national communicable disease and infection control policy specific to the EMS needs to be developed together with an accredited training module on communicable diseases and infection control for EMS in the pre-hospital environment.","Mahomed, Ozayr; Jinabhai, Champaklal Chaganlal; Taylor, Myra; Yancey, Arthur",Emergency medicine journal : EMJ,726,20

Human and chimpanzee liver infected with HCV showed viral-like particles (50 to 60 nm in diameter) as well as aggregates of short tubules that represent viral envelope material. Interactions of HCV core protein with apolipoproteins have a role in the pathogenesis of HCV-related steatosis. Pathologists should be aware of the spectrum of liver pathology described with the use of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) agents for the human immunodeficiency virus infection, which includes microvesicular steatosis and more severe hepatic injury with confluent necrosis. Proliferation of bile ductular structures is influenced by specific molecules and proteins (eg, the mucin-associated trefoil proteins and estrogens). The interplay between Notch receptors and Jagged 1 protein, as expressed by many cells of the liver (including bile duct epithelium) varies in primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) and primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC). Cholangiocarcinoma does not appear to be a long-term complication of small duct PSC. The fatty liver diseases, both alcoholic and nonalcoholic, are characterized by production of reactive oxygen species that have detrimental effects such as opening mitochondrial permeability transition pores with resultant release of cytochrome c into the cytosol. Hepatocellular carcinoma is now a recognized late complication of NASH. The derivation of hepatic stem cells, the roles of HFE protein and other hepatic and intestinal transport proteins in hemochromatosis, and the histopathologic interpretive challenge of centrilobular lesions in posttransplant liver biopsies are among other recent studies considered in this review.","Lefkowitch, Jay H",Current opinion in gastroenterology,726,20

Cases were reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections, reported from 20 January-19 March 2020. The incubation period was estimated using travel history and date of symptom onset. To estimate the serial interval, we identified pairs of index and secondary cases. By 19 March, 3546 cases were reported. A large proportion was exposed abroad (38%), causing further local transmission. Median incubation period of 256 cases with exposure abroad was 3.8 days (95%CI: 3.5-4.2). For 95% of infected individuals, symptom onset occurred within 10.3 days (95%CI: 9.1-11.8) after exposure. The median serial interval, using 53 pairs, was 3.5 days (95%CI: 3.0-4.2; mean: 3.9, s.d.: 2.2). Travellers returning to Germany had an important influence on the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infections in Bavaria in early 2020. Especially in times of low incidence, public health agencies should identify holiday destinations, and areas with ongoing local transmission, to monitor potential importation of SARS-CoV-2 infections. Travellers returning from areas with ongoing community transmission should be advised to quarantine to prevent re-introductions of COVID-19.","Böhm, S; Woudenberg, T; Chen, D; Marosevic, D V; Böhmer, M M; Hansen, L; Wallinga, J; Sing, A; Katz, K",Epidemiol Infect,726,16

All SARS-CoV-2-infected patients with a laboratory-confirmed diagnosis in Zhoushan City were followed up for viral shedding in respiratory tract specimens and faecal samples. Positivity was analysed both qualitatively and quantitatively by proper statistical approaches with strong testing power. Viral shedding in respiratory tract and faecal specimens was prolonged to 45 and 40 days after the last exposure, respectively. The overall positive rate in respiratory tract specimens was low and relatively unstable, being higher in the early-to-mid stage than in the mid-to-late stage of the disease course. Compared with respiratory tract specimens, faecal samples had a higher viral load, higher overall positive rate, and more stable positivity in different disease courses and varied symptomatic status. Faecal specimens have the potential ability to surpass respiratory tract specimens in virus detection. Testing of faecal specimens in diagnosis, especially for identifying asymptomatic carriers, is recommended. Simultaneously, testing respiratory tract specimens at the early-to-mid stage is better than testing at the mid-to-late stage of the disease course. A relatively small sample size was noted, and statistical approaches were used to address it. Information was missing for both specimen types at different stages of the disease course due to censored data. Our research extends the observed viral shedding in both specimen types and highlights the importance of faecal specimen testing in SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis. Healthcare workers, patients, and the general public may all benefit from our study findings.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a cross-sectional survey conducted at the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic (May 2020). The study sample was derived from the Columbia University College of Dental Medicine Alumni network, which included the graduating classes between 1975 and 2015. Active dental practitioners were surveyed regarding changes to their current operations and protective safety measures through a 22 closed-ended questionnaire-based survey. RESULTS: The response rate was 17%. Nearly 70.92% of respondents laid off at least one staff member during the COVID-19 pandemic, 51.80% expressed fear of permanent closure, and 79.43% applied for a small business administration loan. There were no significant associations between the amount of time in practice and the need to lay off staff members, the fear of going out of business, or the rates of application for the small business administration loan. Many practitioners bought at least one device geared toward reducing COVID-19 transmission, such as ultraviolet (UV) lights (26.21%), extraoral suctions (37.31%), and high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) air filters (54.55%). CONCLUSION: At the peak of the pandemic, the majority of dental providers had to reduce staff and seek financial assistance. Concurrently, many of these practices also invested in new safety equipment with the intention of reducing viral transmission. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: External mouth suctions, commercial air purifiers, and air exchange devices might be useful in the private practice setting. However, financially strained practitioners should recognize that these devices have not currently been proven to be effective against the COVID-19 virus.

By harnessing the regulatory effects of adenosine on inflammatory mediators, we have instituted a new therapeutic treatment with inhaled adenosine in COVID-19 patients, with the aim of reducing inflammation, the onset of cytokine storm, and therefore to improve prognosis. The use of inhaled adenosine in COVID19 patients has allowed reduction of length of stay, on average 6 days. This result is strengthened by the decrease in SARS-CoV-2 positive days. In treated patients compared to control, a clear improvement in PaO2/FiO2 was observed together with a reduction in inflammation parameters, such as the decrease of CRP level. Furthermore, the efficacy of inhaled exogenous adenosine led to an improvement of the prognosis indices, NLR and PLR. The treatment seems to be safe and modulates the immune system, allowing an effective response against the viral infection progression, reducing length of stay and inflammation parameters.","Caracciolo, Massimo; Correale, Pierpaolo; Mangano, Carmelo; Foti, Giuseppe; Falcone, Carmela; Macheda, Sebastiano; Cuzzola, Maria; Conte, Marco; Falzea, Antonella Consuelo; Iuliano, Eleonora; Morabito, Antonella; Caraglia, Michele; Polimeni, Nicola; Ferrarelli, Anna; Labate, Demetrio; Tescione, Marco; Di Renzo, Laura; Chiricolo, Gaetano; Romano, Lorenzo; De Lorenzo, Antonino",Front Immunol,726,20

Adding to this is the lack of research on destination characteristics that trigger transformations and travellers' perceptions of transformative destinations. Using the Repertory Test with Laddering Analysis, underpinned by Personal Construct Theory, this article proposes that transformative destination attractiveness lies in the meaningfulness of attributes to travellers, rather than in the attributes themselves. This is because, when considering transformations, attractiveness is driven by travellers' perceptions of a destination's enduring impact on them.

However, as other machine learning algorithms, deep learning, and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in particular, perform worse when the data sets present label noise. Therefore, it is important to develop algorithms that help the training of deep networks and their generalization to noise-free test sets. In this paper, we propose a robust training strategy against label noise, called RAFNI, that can be used with any CNN. This algorithm filters and relabels instances of the training set based on the predictions and their probabilities made by the backbone neural network during the training process. That way, this algorithm improves the generalization ability of the CNN on its own. RAFNI consists of three mechanisms: two mechanisms that filter instances and one mechanism that relabels instances. In addition, it does not suppose that the noise rate is known nor does it need to be estimated. We evaluated our algorithm using different data sets of several sizes and characteristics. We also compared it with state-of-the-art models using the CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 benchmarks under different types and rates of label noise and found that RAFNI achieves better results in most cases.","G'omez-R'ios, Anabel; Luengo, Juli'an; Herrera, Francisco",,726,20

PATIENTS & METHODS: The Spanish GD foundation (FEETEF) surveyed 113 GD patients from March 30 to April 27; all patients provided a verbal consent. RESULTS: 110 surveys were analyzed. The median age was 47 years old (y.o.), 31 patients were &#8805; 60 y.o.; and 34% of patients reported comorbidities. 46% (51/110) of patients were treated by enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), 48 of them at hospitals; 45.1% (45/110) were on substrate reduction therapy (SRT) and 9% (10/110) receive no therapy. 25% (11/48) of ERT-hospital-based patients reported therapy interruptions, while SRT-patients did not report missing doses. No bone crises were reported. However, 50% (55/110) of patients reported being worried about their predisposition to a severe SARS-COV-2 infection and 29% (16/55) of them took anxiolytics or antidepressants for this. While 6 patients reported to have contact with an infected person, another two confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections were reported in splenectomyzed patients, one of them (a 79-year-old diabetic) died. CONCLUSIONS: One quarter of the patients treated at hospitals reported dose interruptions.

This paper demonstrates that high-frequency electricity market data can be used to estimate the causal, short-run impact of COVID-19 on the economy. In the current uncertain economic conditions, timeliness is essential. Unlike official statistics, which are published with a delay of a few months, with our approach one can monitor virtually every day the impact of the containment policies, the extent of the recession and measure whether the monetary and fiscal stimuli introduced to address the crisis are being effective. We illustrate our methodology on daily data for the Italian day-ahead power market. Not surprisingly, we find that the containment measures caused a significant reduction in economic activities and that the GDP at the end of in May 2020 is still about 11% lower that what it would have been without the outbreak.","Fezzi, Carlo; Fanghella, Valeria",,726,20

In the lack of a specific treatment and vaccine for this novel infection, finding effective drugs against this infection is crucial. We suggest the hypothesis that crocin, the main carotenoid of saffron, has the potential to limit the progression and severity of the SARS-CoV2 infection for several reasons: (a) crocin possesses powerful antioxidant properties, (b) crocin can alleviate the uncontrolled cytokine production responsible for acute lung injury, (c) crocin can upregulate PPARÎ³ and downregulate NF-&#954;B expression which leads to a wide range of immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effects, and (d) crocin can reduce the viral-induced oxidative stress and downregulates ACE2 expression by activating Nrf2 pathway. We hope our hypothesis, corroborated by preclinical evidence, will inspire further targeted studies to test crocin as a beneficial drug against the SARS-CoV2 infection. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Crocin is a natural antioxidant and the main active carotenoid components of saffron. We suggest the hypothesis that crocin has the potential to limit the progression and severity of the SARS-CoV2 infection because of its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Furthermore, this compound may prevent viral entry to host cells and reduce SARS-CoV2-induced lung injury. Therefore, we suggest further clinical studies on the effects of crocin against SARS-Cov-2 infection.","Ghasemnejad-Berenji, Morteza",J Food Biochem,726,20

Healthcare professionals cannot wait for published randomised controlled trials before they can start these rehabilitative interventions in daily clinical practice, as the number of post-COVID-19 patients increases rapidly. The Convergence of Opinion on Recommendations and Evidence process was used to make interim recommendation for the rehabilitation in the hospital and post-hospital phase in COVID-19 and post-COVID-19 patients, respectively. METHODS: 93 experts were asked to fill out 13 multiple choice questions. Agreement of directionality was tabulated for each question. At least 70% agreement on directionality was necessary to make consensus suggestions. RESULTS: 76 experts (82%) reached consensus on all questions based upon indirect evidence and clinical experience on the need for early rehabilitation during the hospital admission, the screening for treatable traits with rehabilitation in all patients at discharge and 6-8â weeks after discharge, and around the content of rehabilitation for these patients. It advocates for assessment of oxygen needs at discharge and more comprehensive assessment of rehabilitation needs including physical as well as mental aspects 6-8â weeks after discharge. Based on the deficits identified multidisciplinary rehabilitation should be offered with attention for skeletal muscle and functional as well as mental restoration. CONCLUSIONS: This multinational task force recommends early, bedside rehabilitation for patients affected by severe COVID-19. The model of pulmonary rehabilitation may suit as a framework, particularly in a subset of patients with long term respiratory consequences.","Spruit, Martijn A; Holland, Anne E; Singh, Sally J; Tonia, Thomy; Wilson, Kevin C; Troosters, Thierry",Eur. respir. j,726,5

This demand has developed because of cost-effective, plant-derived products rather than commercially available synthetic drugs. Cucumis sativus Linn. (Ver. Kheera) is a vegetable climber, species belongs to family Cucurbitaceae This species has a wide range of medicinal and biological applications thanks to its richness in carbohydrate, proteins, minerals (calcium, iron, magnesium, phosphorus, potassium, zinc) and secondary metabolites like alkaloids, tannins, flavonoids, saponins, and phenolic compounds These phytoconstituents may be responsible for allied therapeutic application. So, C. sativus possess wider applications for preventing certain ailments. CONTENT: The literature in various national and international journals and reports pertaining to the medicinal and nutritional uses were reviewed. The result revealed the current therapeutic applications of C. sativus whole plants other than the nutritional value. C. sativus pharmacological action includes antioxidant, anti-diabetic, UV protectant, hepatoprotective, gastroprotective, anti-helminthic, wound healing, antimicrobial, and anticancer.

224828,224828,224828,[Vaccination immunology in SARS-CoV-2],11.377681,9.822805,2021,"Several independent datasets suggest blood type A is over-represented and type O under-represented among COVID-19 patients. However, blood group antigens appear not to be conventional susceptibility factors in that they do not affect disease severity, and the relative risk to non-O individuals is attenuated when population prevalence is high. Here, I model a scenario in which ABO transfusion incompatibility reduces the chance of a patient transmitting the virus to an incompatible recipient - thus in Western populations type A and AB individuals are ""super-recipients"" while type O individuals are ""super-spreaders"". This results in an offset in the timing of the epidemic among individuals of different blood types, and an increased relative risk to type A/AB patients that is most pronounced during early stages of the epidemic. However, once the majority of any given population is infected, the relative risk to each blood type approaches unity. Published data on COVID-19 prevalence from regions in the early stages of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic suggests that if this model holds true, ABO incompatibility reduces virus transmissibility by at least 60 %. Exploring the implications of this model for vaccination strategies shows that paradoxically, targeted vaccination of either high-susceptibility type A/AB or ""super-spreader"" type O individuals is less effective than random vaccination at blocking community spread of the virus. Instead, the key is to maintain blood type diversity among the remaining susceptible individuals. Given the good agreement between this model and observational data on disease prevalence, the underlying biochemistry urgently requires experimental investigation.","Ellis, Peter J I",Epidemics,726,29

In this paper, we look at these different impacts and the norms related to the use of biological weapons and cyber campaigns.

Hence, the present study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic effect of D-dimer testing in pregnant women with suspected PE. Methods: This study recruited 100 women with confirmed pregnancy or six weeks after delivery or abortion with suspected PE symptoms. Wells criteria, D-dimer values, and pregnancy trimesters were recorded. Definitive PE results were obtained using multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) or pulmonary ventilation/perfusion scans. Results: D-dimer cut-off point in PE diagnosis was higher than 1,447 µg/L [sensitivity, 87.5%; specificity, 63.04%; area under the curve (AUC)=0.735; P=0.003]. In addition, the combination of Wells criteria with the D-dimer test indicated that the cut-off points of D-dimer in PE likely and unlikely women were 1,962 and 1,447 µg/L, respectively, and had acceptable and significant diagnostic value in PE detection. In addition, the diagnostic value of D-dimer in pregnancy trimesters was not found to be significant (P>0.05). Conclusion: The new cut-off points of 1,447 and 1,962 µg/L were determined for D-dimer in pregnant women with likely and unlikely PE, respectively. Moreover, the new cut-off points in the first and second trimesters of pregnancy were 1,701 µg/L and 1,451 µg/L, respectively, which indicated no statistically acceptable diagnostic value.","Sadeghi, Somayeh; Golshani, Marjan; Safaeian, Bahareh",,726,20

The best well-known vaccines have utilized either mRNA or an adenovirus vector to direct human cells to produce the spike protein against which the body produces mostly neutralizing antibodies. However, recent reports have raised some skepticism as to the biologic actions of the spike protein and the types of antibodies produced. One paper reported that certain antibodies in the blood of infected patients appear to change the shape of the spike protein so as to make it more likely to bind to cells, while other papers showed that the spike protein by itself (without being part of the corona virus) can damage endothelial cells and disrupt the blood-brain barrier. These findings may be even more relevant to the pathogenesis of long-COVID syndrome that may affect as many as 50% of those infected with SARS-CoV-2. In COVID-19, a response to oxidative stress is required by increasing anti-oxidant molecules. In this regard, it is known that polyphenols are natural anti-oxidants with with anti-inflammatory properties. Hence, there are even more reasons to intervene with the use of anti-oxidant compounds, such as luteolin, in addition to available vaccines and anti-inflammatory drugs to prevent the harmful actions of the spike protein.","Theoharides, T.

Little is known about the early life predictors of anxiety during the pandemic. We examined a developmental pathway from behavioral inhibition (BI), a temperament characterized by fearful responses toward novelty, to changes in young adults' anxiety during the initial period of the pandemic. We hypothesized that a stable pattern of BI across early childhood would predict greater adolescent worry dysregulation, which in turn would predict increases in young adult anxiety during a stressful phase of the pandemic. METHOD: Participants (N = 291; 54% female) were followed from toddlerhood to young adulthood. BI was observed at ages 2 and 3 years. Social wariness was observed at age 7 years. Participants rated their worry dysregulation in adolescence (age 15) and anxiety in young adulthood (age 18) at 2 assessments during the COVID-19 pandemic, 1 month apart. RESULTS: A significant moderated mediation, in which a stable pattern of BI from toddlerhood to childhood, as compared to the absence of this pattern, predicted greater worry dysregulation in adolescence. Worry dysregulation predicted elevated young adult anxiety in the second assessment during COVID-19, even after accounting for the first assessment. CONCLUSION: This study identifies a developmental pathway from toddlerhood BI to young adults' elevated anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings have implications for early identification of individuals at risk for dysregulated worry and the prevention of anxiety during stressful life events in young adulthood.","Zeytinoglu, Selin; Morales, Santiago; Lorenzo, Nicole E; Chronis-Tuscano, Andrea; Degnan, Kathryn A; Almas, Alisa N; Henderson, Heather; Pine, Daniel S; Fox, Nathan A",J.

Limited information is available to identify those at greatest risk for cardiac complications. Objectives Objectives were to analyze risk factors associated with cardiovascular events (CE);analyze whether risk factors and outcomes were influenced by race;and analyze survival differences among various groups. Methods This retrospective cohort study of 700 inpatients with COVID-19 was conducted at nine hospitals within a large urban midwestern city. Data was collected from March 9, 2020, to June 20, 2020. Inclusion criteria included all COVID-19 inpatients and excluded non-inpatients. Predictor variables included demographics, comorbidities, and current clinical data. The outcomes were heart failure (HF), deep-vein thrombosis, myocardial infarction, pulmonary edema, stroke, cardiomyopathy, myocarditis, reduced ejection fraction, cardiac arrhythmias, cardiogenic shock, and cardiac arrest. Pearson's correlation coefficients were used to evaluate the correlation between different variables. Multiple logistics regression analyses were conducted to examine which variables predict cardiovascular events for the entire cohort, African American patients, and white patients, respectively. Mann-Whitney U, Chi-square, or Fisher's exact tests were used to examine differences in groups with and without CE and Kaplan-Meier was conducted for survival comparisons between groups. Results Of 700 COVID-19 positive inpatients, 126 experienced cardiovascular events and 574 did not. The incidence of cardiovascular events in our sample population was 18%. As shown in Table 1, we found the following factors were highly associated with the odds of new-onset of CEs: advanced age in years, males, non-Hispanic African American, presence of comorbidities, and decreased saturation levels. Numerous laboratory values were significantly associated with the risk of CEs (Table 1). African Americans had greater odds of CEs in the presence of diabetes and cardiovascular comorbidities (p=0.008, p=0.014, respectively). However, multiple logistics analysis was used to examine the joint effect of the risk factors which suggested that lower serum albumin and neoplastic/immune compromised diseases count were highly associated with CEs for African American COVID-19 inpatients (p=0.001, p=0.044, respectively). SaO2/FiO2 ratio and cardiovascular comorbidities were significantly associated with CEs for white inpatients (p=&lt;0.001, p=0.007, respectively). As shown in Figure 1, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed inpatients with CEs had a much higher mortality rate than those without CEs (45.2% vs. 8.7%). Median survival for patients with CEs was 18 days as opposed to 100 days for those that did not experience CEs. African Americans with CEs experienced higher mortality than those without CEs (43.9% vs. 7.8%). White COVID-19 inpatients' mortality rates were 46.3% and 9.0% for those with and without CEs, respectively. Of the 126 COVID-19 inpatients who had a CE, 14.3% had cardiac arrhythmias and 8.7% had new onset of HF diagnoses, and 4.8% had acute myocardial infarctions. Conclusion Multiple risk factors for CEs and death were identified in this sample of hospitalized patients with COVID-19, and mortality was increased significantly in those inpatients who had CEs. HF, cardiac arrhythmia, and acute myocardial infarction were the most frequently cited CEs implicating the need for long-term follow-up.","Roser, Lynn Huang Jiapeng Kong Maiying McGuffin Trevor Nathala Pavani Salunkhe Vidyulata Samanapelly Harideep Xu Qian",Heart &amp; Lung,726,20

Results revealed that elevated psychological distress was found among those who have background illness, fear of contracting COVID-19 from patient, and a higher subjective overload. Lower psychological distress was associated with being in a committed relationship and having higher scores for self-efficacy. Given these results, gathered during times of an infectious disease outbreak, exploring psychological distress among dental staff is warranted as the effects may be long-term.","Shacham, Maayan; Hamama-Raz, Yaira; Kolerman, Roni; Mijiritsky, Ori; Ben-Ezra, Menachem; Mijiritsky, Eitan",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),726,24

Measurements of NT50 are difficult to implement in large quantities. A high-throughput laboratory test is expected for determining the level of herd immunity against SARS-CoV-2. MethodsWe analyzed samples from 168 Japanese healthcare workers who had completed two doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine. We analyzed immunoglobulin G (IgG) index values against spike protein (SP) using automated chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay system AIA-CL and analyzed the background factors affecting antibody titer. SP IgG index was compared with 50% neutralization titers. ResultsThe median SP IgG index values of the subjects (mean age = 43 years; 75% female) were 0.1, 1.35, 60.80, and 97.35 before and at 2, 4, and 6 weeks after the first dose, respectively. At 4 and 6 weeks after the first dose, SP IgG titers were found to have positive correlation with NT50 titer (r=0.7535 in 4 weeks; r=0.4376 in 6 weeks). Proportions of the SP IgG index values against the Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Delta variants compared with the original strain were 2.029, 0.544, 1.017, and 0.6096 respectively. Older age was associated with lower SP IgG titer index 6 weeks after the first dose. ConclusionsSP IgG index values were raised at 3 weeks after two doses of BNT162b2 vaccination and have positive correlation with NT50. SP IgG index values were lower in the older individuals and against Beta and Delta strain.","Kato, Hideaki; Miyakawa, Kei; Ohtake, Norihisa; Go, Hirofumi; Yamaoka, Yutaro; Yajima, Satoshi; Shimada, Tomoko; Goto, Atsushi; Nakajima, Hideaki; Ryo, Akihide",,726,32

Results obtained from conducted research by epidemiologists and virologists showed that, COVID-19 is mainly spread from symptomatic individuals to others who are in close contact via respiratory droplets, mouth and nose, which are the primary mode of transmission. World health organization regulations to help stop the spread of this deadly virus, indicated that, it is compulsory to utilize respiratory protective devices such as facemasks in the public. Indeed, the use of these facemasks around the globe has helped reduce the spread of COVID-19. The primary aim of facemasks, is to avoid inhaling air that could contain droplets with COVID-19. We should note that, respiration process is the movement of oxygen from external atmosphere to the cells within tissue and the transport of carbon dioxide outside. However, the rebreathing of carbon dioxide using a facemask has not been taken into consideration. The hypercapnia (excess inhaled content of CO2) has been recognized to be related to symptoms of fatigue, discomfort, muscular weakness, headaches as well as drowsiness. Rebreathing of CO2 has been a key to concern regarding the use of a facemask. Rebreathing usually occur when an expired air that is rich in CO2 stays long than normal in the breathing space of the respirator after a breath. The increase of the arterial CO2 concentration leads to symptoms that are aforementioned. Studies have been conducted on facemask shortages and on the appropriate facemask required to reduce the spread of COVID-19; however no study has been conducted to assess the possible relationship between CO2 inhalation due to facemask, to determine and recommend which mask is appropriate in the reduction of the spread of the coronavirus while simultaneously avoid CO2 inhalation by the facemask users. In the current paper, we provided a literature review on the use of facemasks with the aim to determine which facemasks could be used to avoid re-inhaling rejected CO2. Additionally, we presented mathematical models depicting the transport of COVID-19 spread through wind with high speed. We considered first mathematical models for which the effect air-heterogeneity is neglected, such that air flow follows Markovian process with a retardation factor, these models considered two different scenarios, the speed of wind is constant and time-space dependent. Secondly, we assumed that the wind movement could follow different processes, including the power law process, fading memory process and a two-stage processes, these lead us to use differential operators with power law, exponential decay and the generalized Mittag-Leffler function with the aim to capture these processes. A numerical technique based on the Lagrange polynomial interpolation was used to solve some of these models numerically. The numerical solutions were coded in MATLAB software for simulations. The results obtained from the mathematical simulation showed that a wind with speed of 100km/h could transport droplets as far as 300 meters. The results obtained from these simulations together with those presented by other researchers lead us to conclude that, the wind could have helped spread COVID-19 in some places around the world, especially in coastal areas. Therefore, appropriate facemasks that could help avoid re-inhaling enough CO2 should be used every time one is in open air even when alone especially in windy environment.","Atangana, Ernestine; Atangana, Abdon",Results Phys,726,2

Globally, a number of studies were conducted to estimate the average serial interval and incubation period of COVID-19. Combining findings of existing studies that estimate the average serial interval and incubation period of COVID-19 significantly improves the quality of evidence. Hence, this study aimed to determine the overall average serial interval and incubation period of COVID-19. METHODS: We followed the PRISMA checklist to present this study. A comprehensive search strategy was carried out from international electronic databases (Google Scholar, PubMed, Science Direct, Web of Science, CINAHL, and Cochrane Library) by two experienced reviewers (MAA and DBK) authors between the 1st of June and the 31st of July 2020. All observational studies either reporting the serial interval or incubation period in persons diagnosed with COVID-19 were included in this study. Heterogeneity across studies was assessed using the I2 and Higgins test. The NOS adapted for cross-sectional studies was used to evaluate the quality of studies. A random effect Meta-analysis was employed to determine the pooled estimate with 95% (CI). Microsoft Excel was used for data extraction and R software was used for analysis. RESULTS: We combined a total of 23 studies to estimate the overall mean serial interval of COVID-19. The mean serial interval of COVID-19 ranged from 4. 2 to 7.5 days. Our meta-analysis showed that the weighted pooled mean serial interval of COVID-19 was 5.2 (95%CI: 4.9-5.5) days. Additionally, to pool the mean incubation period of COVID-19, we included 14 articles. The mean incubation period of COVID-19 also ranged from 4.8 to 9 days. Accordingly, the weighted pooled mean incubation period of COVID-19 was 6.5 (95%CI: 5.9-7.1) days. CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review and meta-analysis showed that the weighted pooled mean serial interval and incubation period of COVID-19 were 5.2, and 6.5 days, respectively. In this study, the average serial interval of COVID-19 is shorter than the average incubation period, which suggests that substantial numbers of COVID-19 cases will be attributed to presymptomatic transmission.","Alene, Muluneh; Yismaw, Leltework; Assemie, Moges Agazhe; Ketema, Daniel Bekele; Gietaneh, Wodaje; Birhan, Tilahun Yemanu",BMC Infect Dis,726,16

National surveillance data on monthly incidence of hepatitis A, hepatitis B, varicella, mumps, invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD), and pertussis were retrieved and compared the VPD incidences in 2020 to the average of the last 4 years (2015-2019) of the corresponding months. In 2020, there were 44% decline for mumps, 44% decline for varicella, 28% decline for pertussis, 22% decline for IPD, 14% decline in incidence of hepatitis A, and no change for hepatitis B incidences, compared to baseline years (2015-2019). The largest decline of total VPDs was in April (65%) and in May (67%), during the intensified social distancing measures.

The risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in patients with cancer seems to be higher, especially as they are more likely to present with an immunocompromised condition, either from cancer itself or from the treatments they receive. A major consideration in the delivery of cancer care during the pandemic is to balance the risk of patient exposure and infection with the need to provide effective cancer treatment. Many aspects of the SARS-CoV-2 infection currently remain poorly characterized and even less is known about the course of infection in the context of a patient with cancer. As SARS-CoV-2 is highly contagious, the risk of infection directly affects the cancer patient being treated, other cancer patients in close proximity, and health care providers. Infection at any level for patients or providers can cause considerable disruption to even the most effective treatment plans. Lung cancer patients, especially those with reduced lung function and cardiopulmonary comorbidities are more likely to have increased risk and mortality from coronavirus disease 2019 as one of its common manifestations is as an acute respiratory illness.

Classical compartmental models must be modified and studied to correctly describe the effects of forced external actions to reduce the impact of the disease. The importance of social structure, such as the age dependence that proved essential in the recent COVID-19 pandemic, must be considered, and in addition, the available data are often incomplete and heterogeneous, so a high degree of uncertainty must be incorporated into the model from the beginning. In this work we address these aspects, through an optimal control formulation of a socially structured epidemic model in presence of uncertain data. After the introduction of the optimal control problem, we formulate an instantaneous approximation of the control that allows us to derive new feedback controlled compartmental models capable of describing the epidemic peak reduction. The need for long-term interventions shows that alternative actions based on the social structure of the system can be as effective as the more expensive global strategy. The timing and intensity of interventions, however, is particularly relevant in the case of uncertain parameters on the actual number of infected people. Simulations related to data from the first wave of the recent COVID-19 outbreak in Italy are presented and discussed.","Albi, Giacomo; Pareschi, Lorenzo; Zanella, Mattia",J Math Biol,726,20

Patients with cancer represent a vulnerable population in this pandemic, with data suggesting a higher risk for severe events and unfavorable outcomes. Timely identification of COVID-19 in patients with cancer has been thwarted by the limited availability of outpatient testing for SARS-CoV-2. Chest computed tomography (CT) plays a major role in the identification of COVID-19 pneumonia, with radiologic hallmarks including bilateral, peripheral ground-glass opacities (GGOs) and consolidation. Patients with cancer undergoing radiation therapy (RT) commonly have daily cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) obtained for image-guided RT, and such imaging frequently includes the chest. Methods and Materials: We retrospectively reviewed the CBCT scans of an initially asymptomatic patient undergoing image-guided RT for breast cancer who developed COVID-19 symptoms during the second week of RT. Lung windows of daily CBCT scans were reviewed with diagnostic radiology to survey for changes consistent with COVID-19. Diagnostic CT scans at the time of recovery were obtained and compared with the CBCTs. Results: Five consecutive CBCT scans were retrospectively reviewed. Bilateral, peripheral GGOs were noted on the fourth and fifth CBCT scans in the 2 days before symptom onset. CBCT on the day of RT resumption demonstrated substantial worsening of the GGO compared with scans obtained during the asymptomatic phase. Diagnostic CTs demonstrated bilateral, peripheral GGOs and mediastinal lymphadenopathy, findings suggesting COVID-19 pneumonitis. Repeat diagnostic CT 3 days later showed improved pulmonary findings, and the patient resumed RT without incident. Conclusions: Familiarity with typical CT changes of COVID-19 pneumonitis may allow for early detection in cancer patients undergoing CBCT for RT treatment. Prompt review of the lung windows is recommended to identify such changes, with the hope that presymptomatic diagnosis leads to expedited patient management, improved outcomes, and a reduction of inadvertent COVID-19 dissemination.","Youssef, Irini; Donahue, Bernadine; Flyer, Mark; Thompson, Sharon; Huang, Alice; Gallant, Fleure",Adv.

Based on preliminary data from Sweden and other reports, in this paper we propose a conceptual framework whereby different factors related to biological and social vulnerability may explain the specific COVID-19 burden among older people. There is already some evidence showing large social disparities in the prevention, treatment, prognosis and/or long-term consequences of COVID-19. The remaining question is to what extent these affect older adults specifically. We provide the rationale to address this question with scientific methods and proper study designs, where the interplay between individuals' biomedical status and their social environment is the focus. Only through interdisciplinary research integrating biological, clinical and social data will we be able to provide new insights into the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and inform actions aimed at reducing older adults' vulnerability to COVID-19 or other similar pandemics in the future.","Calderón-Larrañaga, Amaia; Dekhtyar, Serhiy; Vetrano, Davide L; Bellander, Tom; Fratiglioni, Laura",Ageing Res Rev,726,5

The COVID-19 virus was known earlier as 2019-nCoV. As of 12 February 2020, WHO reported 45,171 cases and 1115 deaths related to COVID-19. COVID-19 is similar to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) virus in its pathogenicity, clinical spectrum, and epidemiology. Comparison of the genome sequences of COVID-19, SARS-CoV, and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) showed that COVID-19 has a better sequence identity with SARS-CoV compared to MERS CoV. However, the amino acid sequence of COVID-19 differs from other coronaviruses specifically in the regions of 1ab polyprotein and surface glycoprotein or S-protein. Although several animals have been speculated to be a reservoir for COVID-19, no animal reservoir has been already confirmed. COVID-19 causes COVID-19 disease that has similar symptoms as SARS-CoV. Studies suggest that the human receptor for COVID-19 may be angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor similar to that of SARS-CoV. The nucleocapsid (N) protein of COVID-19 has nearly 90% amino acid sequence identity with SARS-CoV. The N protein antibodies of SARS-CoV may cross react with COVID-19 but may not provide cross-immunity. In a similar fashion to SARS-CoV, the N protein of COVID-19 may play an important role in suppressing the RNA interference (RNAi) to overcome the host defense. This mini-review aims at investigating the most recent trend of COVID-19.","Kannan, S; Shaik Syed Ali, P; Sheeza, A; Hemalatha, K",Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,726,20

Treatment with angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), such as losartan, may mitigate these effects, though induction of ACE2 could increase viral entry, replication, and worsen disease. Methods This study represents a placebo-controlled blinded randomized clinical trial (RCT) to test the efficacy of losartan on outpatients with COVID-19 across three hospital systems with numerous community sites in Minnesota, U.S. Participants included symptomatic outpatients with COVID-19 not already taking ACE-inhibitors or ARBs, enrolled within 7 days of symptom onset. Patients were randomized to 1:1 losartan (25 mg orally twice daily unless estimated glomerular filtration rate, eGFR, was reduced, when dosing was reduced to once daily) versus placebo for 10 days, and all patients and outcome assesors were blinded. The primary outcome was all-cause hospitalization within 15 days. Secondary outcomes included functional status, dyspnea, temperature, and viral load. (clinicatrials.gov, NCT04311177, closed to new participants) Findings From April to November 2020, 117 participants were randomized 58 to losartan and 59 to placebo, and all were analyzed under intent to treat principles. The primary outcome did not differ significantly between the two arms based on Barnard's test [losartan arm: 3 events (5.2% 95% CI 1.1, 14.4%) versus placebo arm: 1 event (1.7%;95% CI 0.0, 9.1%)];proportion difference -3.5% (95% CI -13.2, 4.8%);p = 0.32]. Viral loads were not statistically different between treatment groups at any time point. Adverse events per 10 patient days did not differ signifcantly [0.33 (95% CI 0.22–0.49) for losartan vs. 0.37 (95% CI 0.25–0.55) for placebo]. Due to a lower than expected hospitalization rate and low likelihood of a clinically important treatment effect, the trial was terminated early. Interpretation In this multicenter blinded RCT for outpatients with mild symptomatic COVID-19 disease, losartan did not reduce hospitalizations, though assessment was limited by low event rate. Importantly, viral load was not statistically affected by treatment. This study does not support initiation of losartan for low-risk outpatients.","Puskarich, Michael A.; Cummins, Nathan W.; Ingraham, Nicholas E.; Wacker, David A.; Reilkoff, Ronald A.; Driver, Brian E.; Biros, Michelle H.; Bellolio, Fernanda Chipman Jeffrey G.; Nelson, Andrew C.; Beckman, Kenneth Langlois Ryan Bold Tyler Aliota Matthew T.; Schacker, Timothy W.; Voelker, Helen T.; Murray, Thomas A.; Koopmeiners, Joseph S.; Tignanelli, Christopher J.",EClinicalMedicine,726,16

Due to its transmission, Sars-Cov-2 has spread rapidly across the world. In the early stage of the disease outbreak, psychiatric symptoms have been reported, including depressive symptoms. In this study, we assessed the prevalence of depressive symptoms in quarantine and its association with sociodemographic variables and known protective factors for depression, such as spirituality, social support, resilience, and quality of life. METHODS: A cross-sectional web-based questionnaire was distributed via social media. The instruments consisted of the 8-item EUROHIS-QOL, PHQ-9, Social Support Questionnaire, WHOQoL-SRPB, and CD-RISC. RESULTS: A total of 3,274 participants were included in this study. 23.67% of the participants met the criteria for a depressive episode. Higher age, spirituality, social support, resiliency, and quality of life were associated with less depressive symptoms. Quarantine length; mental health treatment; chronic disease; age; sex; lower levels of spirituality, social support, resilience, quality of life, physical exercise, and education; and unpaid occupation were found to be predictors of depressive symptoms during COVID-19 quarantine. LIMITATIONS: The data are limited to the pandemic initial period, the sample isn't random and the use of self-reported questionnaires are some limitations of our study. CONCLUSIONS: During the initial phase of the COVID-19 outbreak in Brazil, quarantine time, treatment for mental health, chronic illness, lower levels of education, and unpaid occupation were positively associated with depressive symptoms. Age, sex, spirituality, social support, resilience, quality of life, and physical exercise showed a negative relationship with depressive symptoms.","Schmitt, A A; Brenner, Augusto Mädke; Primo de Carvalho Alves, Lucas; Claudino, Felipe César de Almeida; Fleck, Marcelo Pio de Almeida; Rocha, Neusa Sica",J Affect Disord,726,17

However, no individual-level study has confirmed the association to date. METHODS: We identified COVID-19 patients diagnosed at the University of Cincinnati hospitals and clinics and estimated particulate matter &#8804;2.5 µm (PM2.5) exposure over a 10-year period (2008-2017) at their residential zip codes. We used logistic regression to evaluate the association between PM2.5 exposure and hospitalizations for COVID-19, adjusting for socioeconomic characteristics and comorbidities. RESULTS: Among the 1128 patients included in our study, the mean (standard deviation) PM2.5 was 11.34 (0.70) µg/m3 for the 10-year average exposure and 13.83 (1.03) µg/m3 for the 10-year maximal exposures. The association between long-term PM2.5 exposure and hospitalization for COVID-19 was contingent upon having pre-existing asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary (COPD) (Pinteraction = 0.030 for average PM2.5 and Pinteraction = 0.001 for maximal PM2.5). In COVID-19 patients with asthma or COPD, the odds of hospitalization were 62% higher with 1 µg/m3 increment in 10-year average PM2.5 (odds ratio [OR]: 1.62, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.00-2.64) and 65% higher with 1 µg/m3 increase in 10-year maximal PM2.5 levels (OR: 1.65, 95% CI: 1.16-2.35). However, among COVID-19 patients without asthma or COPD, PM2.5 exposure was not associated with higher hospitalizations (OR: 0.84, 95% CI: 0.65-1.09 for average PM2.5 and OR: 0.78, 95% CI: 0.65-0.95 for maximal PM2.5). CONCLUSIONS: Long-term exposure to PM2.5 is associated with higher odds of hospitalization in COVID-19 patients with pre-existing asthma or COPD.","Mendy, Angelico; Wu, Xiao; Keller, Jason L; Fassler, Cecily S; Apewokin, Senu; Mersha, Tesfaye B; Xie, Changchun; Pinney, Susan M",Respir Med,726,27

We have noticed another patient with SARS-CoV-2 re-infection based on clinical and laboratory studies: A 23-year-old woman presented to her hospital with fever (39°C), chills, fatigue, cough, headache, sore throat, muscle and joint pain on April 9, 2020. On examination, oropharynx was mildly hyperemic, and chest auscultation was normal. SARS-CoV-2 PCR from nasopharyngeal specimen was ordered. She was given isotonic saline and acetaminophen and prescribed azithromycin and acetaminophen and sent home for isolation. SARS-CoV-2 PCR was reported positive and she was given hydroxychloroquine for five days. She improved in 10 days and PCR studies on April 22, and April 27 remained negative. On 4 August 2020, she was re-admitted with fever (38.7°C), chills, fatigue, loss of appetite, taste and smell loss, muscle and joint pain. On examination, oropharynx and chest auscultation were normal. SARS-CoV-2 PCR was reported positive and she was prescribed hydroxychloroquine, acetaminophen and sent home for isolation again. She improved in one week (taste-smell loss improved in 10 days) and on follow-up visit after 14 days, she was doing well. PCR was negative on 17 August 2020.

Organizational empowerment practices in hospitals likely shape the psychological experiences of empowerment among these personnel; however, little is known about this relationship. Objective: We used qualitative inquiry to explore the relationship between organizational empowerment structural components and feelings of psychological empowerment among hospital frontline workers during a public health emergency. Methods: Kanter's Theory of Structural Empowerment and Spreitzer's Psychological Empowerment in the Workplace Framework were applied to identify the conceptual influences of organizational practices on psychological experiences of empowerment. In-depth interviews were conducted with a convenience sample of NAs, caring for hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Directed content analysis was performed to generate a data matrix consisting of the psychological experiences of meaning, competence, self-determination, and impact embedded under the organizational structural components of information, resources, support, and opportunity. Results: Thirteen NAs (mean age = 42 years, 92% female) completed interviews. Information, or lack thereof, provided to the NAs influenced feelings of fear, preparation, and autonomy. Resources (e.g., protocols, equipment, and person-power) made it easier to cope with overwhelming emotions, affected the NAs' abilities to do their jobs, and when limited, drove NAs to take on new roles. NAs noted that support was mostly provided by nurses and made the NAs feel appreciated, desiring to contribute more. While NAs felt they could consult leadership when needed, several felt leadership showed little appreciation for their roles and contributions. Similar to support, the opportunity to take care of COVID-19 patients yielded a diverse array of emotions, exposed advances and gaps in NA preparation, and challenged NAs to autonomously develop new care practices and processes. Conclusion: Management and empowerment of healthcare workers are critical to hospital performance and success. We found many ways in which the NAs' psychological experiences of empowerment were shaped by the healthcare system's empowerment-related structural conditions during a public health emergency. To further develop an empowered and committed critical workforce, hospitals must acknowledge the organizational practice influence on the psychological experiences of empowerment among NAs.","Travers, Jasmine L; Schroeder, Krista; Norful, Allison A; Aliyu, Sainfer",BMC Nurs,726,16

The pathophysiology is far from settled, but a gut microbial dysbiosis is hypothesized to be a contributing factor. We earlier published a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial on fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) for IBS - the REFIT trial. The present data set describes the engraftment and includes participants from the study who received active FMT; 14 participants with effect of FMT (Effect) and 8 without (No effect). Samples were collected at baseline, after 6 and 12 months. Samples from the transplants (Donor) served as a comparator. In total 66 recipient samples and 17 donor samples were subjected to deep metagenomic sequencing, and taxonomic and functional analyses were performed. Alpha diversity measures showed a significantly increased diversity and evenness in the IBS groups compared to the donors. Taxonomic profiles showed higher relative abundance of phylum Firmicutes, and lower relative abundance of phylum Bacteroidetes, compared to donors at baseline. This profile was shifted toward the donor profile following FMT. Imputed growth rates showed that the resulting growth pattern was a conglomerate of donor and recipient activity. Thirty-four functional subclasses showed distinct differences between baseline samples and donors, most of which were shifted toward a donor-like profile after FMT. All of these changes were less pronounced in the No effect group. We conclude that FMT induces long-term changes in gut microbiota, and these changes mirror the clinical effect of the treatment. The study was registered in ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02154867).","Goll, Rasmus; Johnsen, Peter Holger; Hjerde, Erik; Diab, Joseph; Valle, Per Christian; Hilpusch, Frank; Cavanagh, Jorunn Pauline",Gut Microbes,726,20

This virus spread quickly throughout many countries in Asia and now Europe, Australia, North America, leading the World Health Organization to declare COVID-19 a pandemic. Given the rapid spread of cases, the authors sought to provide analysis of patients with COVID-19, their clinical characteristics, and severity of disease. This was a retrospective review of Chinese medical records for laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 reported to the National Health Commission between December 11, 2019 to January 29, 2020. Electronic medical records were used to record various clinical data including exposure risk, signs and symptoms, laboratory findings, and radiologic findings. Several researchers performed chart abstraction and disagreements were made by a third reviewer. If radiologic findings were included, these were reviewed by respiratory medicine attending physicians who interpreted the findings. Incubation periods of less than 1 day were excluded. Fever was defined as an axillary temperature of 37.5 degrees Celsius or higher. Patients were categorized into severe or nonsevere based on the American Thoracic Society guidelines for community acquired pneumonia. The primary composite endpoint was admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), use of mechanical ventilation, or death. Secondary outcomes included death rates from symptom onset until each component of the composite end-point. There were 7736 patients admitted at 552 sites during the study period and data were obtained on 1099 patients (14.2%). The majority were nonsevere disease (926, 84.3%). The median age was 47 years (IQR 35-58), 41.9% were female, and most were nonsmokers (85.4%). Any comorbidity was recorded in 23.7% of patients, with hypertension being the most common (15.0%). The majority of patients (72.3%) had recent contact with a Wuhan resident, although 25.9% had no reported exposure. The median incubation period was 4.0 days (IQR 2.0-7.0). Regarding symptoms, only 43.8% of patients had fever on presentation but 88.7% developed fever during hospitalization. Besides fever, the most common symptoms overall were cough (67.8%), fatigue (38.1%), sputum production (33.7%), and shortness of breath (18.7%). Chest radiograph findings were available for 274 patients, with the majority being abnormal (59.1%). Findings included bilateral patchy shadowing (36.5%), local patchy shadowing (28.1%), ground-glass opacity (20.1%), and interstitial abnormality (4.4%). Chest CT results were available on 975 patients. The majority (86.2%) were abnormal and consisted of ground-glass opacity (56.4%), bilateral patchy shadowing (51.8%), local patchy shadowing (41.9%), and interstitial abnormalities (14.7%). Laboratory testing was available on most, depending on the test, and showed a median white blood cell count of 4700/mm3 (IQR 3500-6000), elevated C-reactive protein (&gt;10mg/L in 60.7%), and normal procalcitonin (&lt;0.5ng/mL in 94.5%). Other notable laboratory abnormalities included elevated D-dimer (&gt; 0.5mg/L in 46.4%) and elevated LDH (&gt;250U/L in 41%). The most common complications were pneumonia (91.1%) followed by acute respiratory distress syndrome (3.4%) and most common treatments were intravenous antibiotics (58.0%), oxygen therapy (41.3%), and oseltamivir (35.8%). Systemic glucocorticoids and immune globulin were less common therapies, and mechanical ventilation was needed in only 6.1%. At the conclusion of the study, 15 (1.4%) of patients had died and 55 (5.0%) had been discharged fro the hospital. The majority of the remaining patients were still hospitalized. Regarding the composite endpoint, there were 67 patients (6.1%) with ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, or death, leading to a cumulative risk of 3.6%. This percentage increased if you were designated as severe disease; in this case 24.9% had the composite outcome, leading to a cumulative risk of 20.6%. The authors concluded that presenting symptoms and workup can be variable, with many patients being afebrile and having normal radiologic studies. Several limitations were noted including missing data for many on incubation periods. Additionally the majority of the patients were still hospitalized at the end of the study and therefore outcomes could not be provided for those patients. Comment: While this study provides helpful clinical information to assist emergency physicians in identifying potential COVID-19 patients, we must understand the limitations. Most significantly, this was only a very small portion of the overall sample size of confirmed COVID-19 patients. Additionally, be cautious in directly applying these results to patients in the United States as populations may differ.","Eastin, Carly; Eastin, Travis",J. Emerg. Med.,726,21

However, the reported prevalence of these deficits in smell and taste varies widely, and the reason for the differences between studies is unclear. We determined the pooled prevalence of such chemosensory deficits in a systematic review and meta-analysis. We searched the COVID-19 portfolio of the National Institutes of Health for studies that reported the prevalence of smell or taste deficits or both in patients diagnosed with COVID-19. One-hundred-four studies reporting on 38â¯198 patients qualified and were subjected to a systematic review and meta-analysis. Estimated random prevalence of olfactory dysfunction was 43.0%, that of taste dysfunction was 44.6%, and that of overall chemosensory dysfunction was 47.4%. We examined the effects of age, gender, disease severity, and ethnicity on chemosensory dysfunction. Prevalence of smell or taste dysfunction or both decreased with older age, male gender, and disease severity. Ethnicity was highly significant: Caucasians had a three times higher prevalence of chemosensory dysfunctions (54.8%) than Asians (17.7%). The finding of geographic differences points to two causes that are not mutually exclusive. A virus mutation (D614G) may cause differing infectivity, while at the host level genetic, ethnicity-specific variants of the virus-binding entry proteins may facilitate virus entry in the olfactory epithelium and taste buds. Both explanations have major implications for infectivity, diagnosis, and management of the COVID-19 pandemic.","von Bartheld, Christopher S; Hagen, Molly M; Butowt, Rafal",ACS Chem Neurosci,726,1

In early fetuses (7-8 weeks), the IO was restricted at an antero-infero-medial angle of the future orbit. In contrast to extraocular recti, the IO appeared to extend along the mediolateral axis and had no definite tendon. At midterm, the IO tendon became evident. Sometimes, the IO muscle belly attached to the inferior rectus or, the IO tendon divided into two laminae to enclose the lateral rectus. At late-term, a multilayered sheath was evident around the sclera and, via one or some of the fascial layers, the IO was communicated with a fascia enclosing the inferior rectus. At midterm and late-term, the IO originated not only from the maxilla near the orbicularis oculi origin but also from a vein-rich fibrous tissue around the lacrimal sac. Both origins were muscular without intermittent tendon or ligament. Therefore, the fascial connection as well as a direct contact between the IO and the inferior or lateral rectus seemed to provide variant muscular bridges as reported in adults. Moreover, the two attachment sites at the origin seemed to provide double muscle bellies of the adult IO. Consequently, the present specimens contained seeds of any types of adult variations.

This cross-sectional study on household food insecurity during COVID-19 used data from a nationally representative sample of US households through the 2020 Household Pulse Survey (HPS) (including all 50 states and the District of Columbia, n = 74,413 households). Six generalized estimating equation (GEE) models were estimated, and the results indicated that households headed by Blacks, Asians, Hispanics, or other racial/ethnic minorities were not significantly more food insecure than White households during the pandemic. However, among food-insecure households, Black households were more likely to report that they could not afford to buy more food; Asian and Hispanic households were more likely to be afraid to go out to buy food; Asian households were more likely to face transportation issues when purchasing food; while White households were more likely to report that stores did not have the food they wanted. Moreover, racial/ethnic minorities were significantly less confident about their household food security for the next 4 weeks than Whites. The coronavirus pandemic crisis has exposed and exacerbated the food injustice in American society.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: All queries spontaneously delivered through the WhatsApp instant messaging system commonly used by patients to communicate with oncology units were collected and grouped by homology in five categories. Responses to the queries were given according to recommendations by the Italian Association of Medical Oncology through WhatsApp and by subsequent phone calls. Patients were also classified according to the site of the primary tumor, stage of disease, and current treatments. Analysis of the association between these data and queries was carried out. RESULTS: The social scenario in Italy is a nationwide lockdown except for hospitals, pharmacies, and food supplies. Overall, 446 different patients' WhatsApp conversations were analyzed between March 1 and March 13 and comprised the following: requirement of visit delay by patients undergoing oral therapies or in follow-up, delays in chemotherapy or immunotherapy administration, queries about possible immunosuppression, and changes in lifestyle or daily activities. Delay requirements were statistically more frequent among patients with prostate or breast cancer compared with those with lung or pancreatic cancer. Actions taken by oncologists are also reported.

Therefore, the present study was conducted to investigate the effect of EDTA and Di-iso-propanol-amine (DIPA) to enhance Pb phytoavailability and uptake by Pelargonium hortorum along with comparative toxicities of both organic amendments. For this purpose, soil was spiked with Pb concentrations (0, 500, 750, 1000 and 1500 mg kg1) and amended with EDTA and DIPA at dosage levels (0, 1.5, 3, 5, 7.5, 10 mmol kg-1) for plantation of Pelargonium hortorum. Soil samples were extracted with MgCl2, plant samples were acid digested and analyzed for metal content. Biomass and root/shoot length of Pelargonium hortorum was decreased with increase in concentration of Pb and chelating agents. Phytoavailability of Pb at 1500 mg kg-1 with EDTA 10 mmol kg-1 was 0.3-folds in comparison to DIPA at the same dosage. Pelargonium hortorum plants amended with EDTA and DIPA at 10 mmol kg-1 with Pb 1000 mg kg-1 were found to uptake Pb 5.3-fold and 2.5-folds, respectively in comparison to Pb 1000 mg kg-1 alone. Pb uptake decreased at 1500 mg kg-1 with both chelating agents. The EDTA alone and in combination with 1500 mg Pb kg-1 showed maximum genotoxicity by reducing the mitotic index and increasing the micronuclei formation. EDTA+Pb showed maximum toxicity followed by Pb and DIPA. Overall, 10 mmol kg-1 of EDTA and DIPA performed better among all dosages in enhancing phytoavailability and uptake of Pb.

It has been reported that CoVs exhibit variable sensitivity to nsp14-ExoN deficiency. Betacoronavirus murine hepatitis virus (MHV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV were viable upon nsp14-ExoN deficiency. While betacoronavirus Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 were non-viable with disabled nsp14-ExoN. In this study, we investigated the nsp14-ExoN deficiency of alphacoronavirus porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) in viral pathogenesis using reverse genetics. RESULTS: Eight nsp14-ExoN deficient mutants, targeting the predicted active sites and the Zinc finger or mental-coordinating sites, of PEDV were designed. Only one mutant E191A with a mutation in the Mg2+-binding site was rescued using the infectious clone of PEDV PC22A strain (icPC22A). The passage no.1-3 (P1-3) of E191A grew to very low titers in Vero cells. To evaluate the pathogenesis of the E191A, 4 or 5-day-old gnotobiotic pigs were inoculated orally with 100 TCID50/pig of the E191A-P1, icPC22A, or mock. All mock pigs did not shed virus in feces or show clinical signs. All pigs inoculated with icPC22A shed high viral RNA levels, had severe diarrhea, and died by 6 days post-inoculation (dpi). In contrast, only 3 pigs (3/4, 75%) in the E191A-P1 group shed low levels of viral RNA and 2 pigs had moderate diarrhea at acute infection phase. At 22 dpi, each pig was challenged orally with 106 plaque forming unit of virulent icPC22A. All pigs in the mock group developed severe diarrhea and 2 of the 5 pigs died. Pigs in the E191A-P1 group had less severe diarrhea and no pigs died. Sanger sequencing analysis revealed that the viral genome in the fecal sample of one E191A-P1-inoculated pig and the P4 virus passaged in vitro lost the E191A mutation, suggesting the genetic instability of the E191A mutant. CONCLUSION: The recombinant PEDV variants carrying mutations at the essential functional sites within nsp14-ExoN were either lethal or genetically unstable. Our finding further confirmed the critical role of nsp14-ExoN in CoV life cycle, suggesting that it may be a target for the design of universal anti-CoV drugs.","Niu, X.; Kong, F.; Hou, Y.

The educational content was outstanding and spanned the causes, treatments, and outcomes from epileptic encephalopathy to the iatrogenicity of epilepsy interventions to neurocognitive disabilities to the approach to neocortical epilepsies. New gene therapy approaches such as antisense oligonucleotide treatment for Dravet syndrome were introduced and neuromodulation devices were discussed. There were many other topics discussed in special interest groups and investigators' workshops. A highlight was having a Nobel prize winner speak about memory processing. Human intracranial electrophysiology contributes insights into memory processing and complements animal work. In a special COVID symposium, the impact of COVID on patients with epilepsy was reviewed.

Adequate knowledge is the key to prevention. A survey, perhaps the first, was conducted among Indian endoscopists to assess the impact of Coronavirus Disease (COVID)-19 on gastroinestinal endoscopy practice in the country. Methods From April 24 to 28, 2020, an electronic survey (using Google Form) was conducted with 23 questions (single or multiple answers) on: (1) endoscopy practice before the pandemic; (2) knowledge about COVID-19; and (3) its impact on endoscopy practice. Results Responses were received from 375 of 1205 (31.1%) endoscopists. Most (35.7%) were young (31-40 years), practicing in corporate multi-speciality hospitals (44.6%) or independent practice set-up (17.7%) in metropolitan cities (55.6%) and urban areas (42.3%). In most units (75.4%), fewer than 10% of procedures performed are endoscopies, as compared to before the pandemic. A reduction in volume of endoscopy related to restriction of the routine procedures by the latest guideline was reported by 86.9% of respondents. Most are using N95 masks (74.7%) and/or complete personal protective equipment (PPE, 49.2%) during endoscopic procedures. Only 18.3% of respondents had access to negative pressure rooms either within (5.4%) or outside (12.9%) the usual endoscopy suite.

While iOAT is part of the continuum of care for OUD in some European countries and in some parts of Canada, it is not an available treatment in the United States. We suggest that one reason for this situation is the belief that a genuine treatment for substance use disorder cannot prescribe the same substance as that used. We examine possible rationales for this belief by considering four combinations of views on the constitutive causal basis of substance use disorders and the definition of effective treatment. We show that all but one combination counts iOAT as a genuine treatment and that there are good reasons to reject the one that does not. Specifically, we claim that medical interventions, such as iOAT, that significantly reduce the severity of a disorder deserve to be categorized as effective treatments and regarded as such in practice.","Steel, Daniel Tekin Şerife",Kennedy Institute of Ethics Journal,726,20

METHODS: We used the American National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 Child/Young Adult (n = 6,315) and the Canadian National Longitudinal Survey of Children and Youth (n = 3,666). Depressive symptoms were measured using five items from the Center for Epidemiological Studies on Depression scale. Latent trajectories of depressive symptoms from ages 16-25 years were identified using growth mixture models. We estimated the effect of childhood family income, parental education, and parental unemployment on trajectory membership using multivariable Poisson regression models with robust variances. RESULTS: We identified four similar trajectories in the two countries: (1) low stable; (2) mid-peak; (3) increasing; and (4) decreasing. Relatively more Americans were in the low-stable trajectory group than Canadians (77.6% vs. 64.9%), and fewer Americans were in the decreasing group (7.1% vs. 19.1%). In the U.S., childhood family income in the bottom two quartiles was related to higher rates of increasing trajectory membership compared with income in the top quartile (incidence rate ratios: 1.59-1.79, p < .05), but not in Canada. In the U.S., parental education at a high school level was associated with higher rates of decreasing trajectory membership compared with higher education (incidence rate ratio = 1.45, confidence interval: 1.10-1.91; p = .01), but not in Canada. CONCLUSIONS: Depressive symptoms may take a similar course in the transition to adulthood within these two countries. Country differences may modify the degree to which childhood socioeconomic status determines trajectory membership.","Minh, Anita; Bültmann, Ute; Reijneveld, Sijmen A; van Zon, Sander K R; McLeod, Christopher B",J. adolesc. health,726,16

Recently, healthcare teams at COVID-19 epicenters have been inundated with critically ill patients. Patients isolated for COVID-19 have had no contact with their family or loved ones and may have likely experienced death without closure. This situation highlights concerns about patients' psychological and spiritual well-being with COVID-19 and their families, as they permanently part ways. While palliative care has advanced to adequately address these patients' needs, the COVID-19 pandemic presents several barriers that force healthcare teams to deprioritize these essential aspects of patient care. The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003 gave us a glimpse of these challenges as these patients were also isolated in hospitals. Here, we discuss the importance of the biopsychosocial spiritual model in end-of-life care and its implications on patients dying with COVID-19. Furthermore, we outline an integrative approach to address the unique and holistic needs of critically ill patients dying with COVID-19. These include intentional and increased coordination with trained palliative care staff, early and frequent goals of care including discussion of end-of-life plans, broader use of technology to improve connectedness, and shared decision making with patients' families.","Galbadage, Thushara; Peterson, Brent M; Wang, David C; Wang, Jeffrey S; Gunasekera, Richard S",Front Psychol,726,16

Additionally, there has been no research examining the impact of consultation length on satisfaction. The aim of this observational study was to investigate the use of a single-question graphic scale to assess vet and client satisfaction and the impact of consultation length on satisfaction. METHODS: Information on consultation timing was collected for 65 health problem consultations across six practices. These measurements were compared with postconsultation measurements of client and vet satisfaction.

The primary aims of this study were to examine the relationship of physical therapy visit frequency and duration in the hospital with patients' mobility status at discharge and probability of discharging home. METHODS: This retrospective study included patients with COVID-19 admitted to any of eleven hospitals in one health system. The primary outcome was mobility status at discharge, measured using the Activity Measure for Post-Acute Care 6-Clicks basic mobility (6-Clicks mobility) and the Johns Hopkins Highest Level of Mobility (JH-HLM) scales. Discharge to home vs. to a facility was a secondary outcome. Associations between these outcomes and physical therapy visit frequency or mean duration were tested using multiple linear or modified Poisson regression. Potential moderation of these relationships by particular patient characteristics was examined using interaction terms in subsequent regression models. RESULTS: For the 312 patients included, increased physical therapy visit frequency was associated with higher 6-Clicks mobility (b = 3.63; 95% CI = 1.54-5.71) and JH-HLM scores (b = 1.15; 95% CI = 0.37-1.93) at hospital discharge and with increased probability of discharging home (adjusted relative risk = 1.82; 95% CI = 1.25-2.63). Longer mean visit duration was also associated with improved mobility at discharge and the probability of discharging home, though the effects were less pronounced. Few moderation effects were observed. CONCLUSION: Patients with COVID-19 demonstrated improved mobility at hospital discharge and higher probability of discharging home with increased frequency and longer mean duration of physical therapy visits. These associations were not generally moderated by patient characteristics. IMPACT: Physical therapy should be an integral component of care for patients hospitalized due to COVID-19. Providing sufficient physical therapist interventions to improve outcomes must be balanced against protection from viral spread.","Johnson, Joshua K; Lapin, Brittany; Green, Karen; Stilphen, Mary",Phys. ther,726,20

Several deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) have been designed for this task, whose performance, however, tends to be suppressed by their limited local receptive fields and insufficient global reasoning ability. In this paper, we propose a pixel-wise sparse graph reasoning (PSGR) module and insert it into a segmentation network to enhance the modeling of long-range dependencies for COVID-19 infected region segmentation in CT images. In the PSGR module, a graph is first constructed by projecting each pixel on a node based on the features produced by the segmentation backbone, and then converted into a sparsely-connected graph by keeping only K strongest connections to each uncertain pixel. The long-range information reasoning is performed on the sparsely-connected graph to generate enhanced features. The advantages of this module are two-fold: (1) the pixel-wise mapping strategy not only avoids imprecise pixel-to-node projections but also preserves the inherent information of each pixel for global reasoning; and (2) the sparsely-connected graph construction results in effective information retrieval and reduction of the noise propagation. The proposed solution has been evaluated against four widely-used segmentation models on three public datasets. The results show that the segmentation model equipped with our PSGR module can effectively segment COVID-19 infected regions in CT images, outperforming all other competing models.","Jia, Haozhe; Tang, Haoteng; Ma, Guixiang; Cai, Weidong; Huang, Heng; Zhan, Liang; Xia, Yong",,726,1

Following the description of VITT among recipients of adenoviral vector ChAdOx1 vaccine, a review of similar cases after Ad26.COV2·S vaccination gave rise to the question whether this entity may constitute a potential class effect of all adenoviral vector vaccines. Most cases are females, typically younger than 60 years who present shortly (range: 5–30 days) following vaccination with thrombocytopenia and thrombotic manifestations, occasionally in multiple sites. Following initial incertitude, concrete recommendations to guide the diagnosis (clinical suspicion, initial laboratory screening, PF4-polyanion-antibody ELISA) and management of VITT (non-heparin anticoagulants, corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulin) have been issued. The mechanisms behind this rare syndrome are currently a subject of active research and include the following: 1) production of PF4-polyanion autoantibodies;2) adenoviral vector entry in megacaryocytes and subsequent expression of spike protein on platelet surface;3) direct platelet and endothelial cell binding and activation by the adenoviral vector;4) activation of endothelial and inflammatory cells by the PF4-polyanion autoantibodies;5) the presence of an inflammatory co-signal;and 6) the abundance of circulating soluble spike protein variants following vaccination. Apart from the analysis of potential underlying mechanisms, this review aims to synopsize the clinical and epidemiologic features of VITT, to present the current evidence-based recommendations on diagnostic and therapeutic work-up of VITT and to discuss new dilemmas and perspectives that emerged after the description of this entity.","Tsilingiris, Dimitrios Vallianou Natalia G.; Karampela, Ιrene Dalamaga Μaria",Metabolism Open,726,20

Notably, T-cells are dysregulated in severe COVID-19 patients, although their molecular features are still yet to be fully revealed. Importantly, it is not clear which T-cell activities are beneficial and protective and which ones can contribute to the development of severe COVID-19. In this article, we examine the latest evidence and discuss the key features of T-cell responses in COVID-19, showing how T-cells are dysregulated in severe COVID-19 patients. Particularly, we highlight the impairment of FOXP3 induction in CD4+ T-cells and how the impaired FOXP3 expression can lead to the differentiation of abnormally activated (hyperactivated) T-cells and the dysregulated T-cell responses in severe patients. Furthermore, we characterise the feature of hyperactivated T-cells, showing their potential contribution to T-cell dysregulation and immune-mediated tissue destruction (immunopathology) in COVID-19.","Kalfaoglu, Bahire; Almeida-Santos, José; Tye, Chanidapa Adele; Satou, Yorifumi; Ono, Masahiro",Biochem. biophys. res. commun,726,22

The charge distribution over the molecule was calculated and shown to be largely heterogeneous. Whereas the stalk part is negatively charged, the top part of the spike molecule, especially the receptor binding domain, remains positively charged for a broad range of pH. It is underlined that such a charge distribution pattern promotes the spike corona stability and enhances the virion attachment to receptors and abiotic surfaces, mostly negatively charged. The review is completed by the analysis of experimental data pertinent to the spike protein adsorption at biotic surfaces comprising nanoparticle carrier particles. It is argued that these theoretical and experimental data can be used for developing quantitative models of virus attachment to receptors and abiotic surfaces facilitating adequate analysis of future experimental results.","Adamczyk, Zbigniew; Batys, Piotr; Barbasz, Jakub",Curr Opin Colloid Interface Sci,726,16

The exact pathomechanism of stroke in COVID-19 remains ambiguous. The findings of previous studies indicate that the most likely underlying mechanisms are cerebrovascular pathological conditions following viral infection, inflammation-induced endothelial dysfunction, and hypercoagulability. Acute endothelial damage due to inflammation triggers a coagulation cascade, thrombosis propagation, and destabilization of atherosclerosis plaques, leading to large-vessel occlusion and plaque ulceration with concomitant thromboemboli, and manifests as ischemic stroke. Another possible mechanism is the downregulation of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 as the target action of severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2).

Some orthopaedic surgeons in Wuhan were infected with COVID-19. METHODS: We conducted a survey to identify the orthopaedic surgeons who were infected with COVID-19 in Wuhan. A self-administered questionnaire was distributed to collect information such as social demographic variables, clinical manifestations, exposure history, awareness of the outbreak, infection control training provided by hospitals, and individual protection practices. To further explore the possible risk factors at the individual level, a 1:2 matched case-control study was conducted. RESULTS: A total of 26 orthopaedic surgeons from 8 hospitals in Wuhan were identified as having COVID-19. The incidence in each hospital varied from 1.5% to 20.7%. The onset of symptoms was from January 13 to February 5, 2020, and peaked on January 23, 8 days prior to the peak of the public epidemic. The suspected sites of exposure were general wards (79.2%), public places at the hospital (20.8%), operating rooms (12.5%), the intensive care unit (4.2%), and the outpatient clinic (4.2%). There was transmission from these doctors to others in 25% of cases, including to family members (20.8%), to colleagues (4.2%), to patients (4.2%), and to friends (4.2%). Participation in real-time training on prevention measures was found to have a protective effect against COVID-19 (odds ratio [OR], 0.12). Not wearing an N95 respirator was found to be a risk factor (OR, 5.20 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.09 to 25.00]). Wearing respirators or masks all of the time was found to be protective (OR, 0.15). Severe fatigue was found to be a risk factor (OR, 4 [95% CI, 1 to 16]) for infection with COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Orthopaedic surgeons are at risk during the COVID-19 pandemic. Common places of work could be contaminated.

However, a comparison based on scientific assumptions is necessary to deeply understand the mechanisms activated by stereotypes in conditions of stress. The global health emergency from COVID-19 offers the opportunity to compare countries with different socio-cultural conditions, whose population has been subjected to the same stressful event during the lockdown phase. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The same questionnaire was disseminated in both Italy and Turkey during their respective lockdown phases. 140,000 interviews were collected in Italy and 10,000 in Turkey, a number big enough to obtain useful information for a comparative analysis in relation to behaviours, attitudes and well-being, also using the recursive regression models. RESULTS: The results, based on scientific data, show that gender stereotypes are much more rooted in Turkey than in Italy, where the emancipation process of the population is more advanced, producing profound social changes and decreasing differences between men and women in terms of behaviour and reactions to difficult situations, such as the present one. CONCLUSIONS: Stereotypes, which are hostile to any opposite evidence, affect individual behaviours and attitudes to the point that, within a specific context, they play a protective role against the uncertainty during a period of health emergency, inducing people to seek shelter in pre-established and widespread behavioural models. According to the data analysis, this has happened in Turkey more than in Italy. The results show that within a culture still strongly pervaded by these social conditioning, especially at the presence of low levels of education, the adherence to gender roles constitutes a ""protective factor"" of the individual well-being against external stress factors.","Tintori, A; Ciancimino, G; Oksay, A; Senal, S; Bulgan, G; Büyüker Isler, D; Cerbara, L",Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,726,25

The survey was promoted by national patient advocacy groups and charitable organisations. FINDINGS: We collected 1388 forms; 592 online and 796 hard-copy (May, 2020). We excluded 137 due to missing data. Median patients' age was 55 years (range: 18-89), 54.7% had ovarian cancer and 15.5% were preoperative. Even though 73.2% of patients named cancer as a risk factor for COVID-19, only 17.5% were more afraid of COVID-19 than their cancer condition, with advanced age (>70 years) as the only significant risk factor for that. Overall, 71% were concerned about cancer progression if their treatment/follow-up was cancelled/postponed. Most patients (64%) had their care continued as planned, but 72.3% (n = 892) said that they received no information around overall COVID-19 infection rates of patients and staff, testing or measures taken in their treating hospital. Mean HADS Anxiety and Depression Scores were 8.8 (range: 5.3-12) and 8.1 (range: 3.8-13.4), respectively. Multivariate analysis identified high HADS-depression scores, having experienced modifications of care due to the pandemic and concern about not being able to visit their doctor as independent predictors of patients' anxiety. INTERPRETATION: Gynaecological cancer patients expressed significant anxiety about progression of their disease due to modifications of care related to the COVID-19 pandemic and wished to pursue their treatment as planned despite the associated risks. Healthcare professionals should take this into consideration when making decisions that impact patients care in times of crisis and to develop initiatives to improve patients' communication and education.","Gultekin, Murat; Ak, Sertac; Ayhan, Ali; Strojna, Aleksandra; Pletnev, Andrei; Fagotti, Anna; Perrone, Anna Myriam; Erzeneoglu, B Emre; Temiz, B Esat; Lemley, Birthe; Soyak, Burcu; Hughes, Cathy; Cibula, David; Haidopoulos, Dimitrios; Brennan, Donal; Cola, Edoardo; van der Steen-Banasik, Elzbieta; Urkmez, Esra; Akilli, Huseyin; Zapardiel, Ignacio; Tóth, Icó; Sehouli, Jalid; Zalewski, Kamil; Bahremand, Kiarash; Chiva, Luis; Mirza, Mansoor Raza; Papageorgiou, Maria; Zoltan, Novak; Adámková, Petra; Morice, Philippe; Garrido-Mallach, Sonia; Akgor, Utku; Theodoulidis, Vasilis; Arik, Zafer; Steffensen, Karina D; Fotopoulou, Christina",Cancer med,726,3

Perceived intuitively as harmful and even traumatic in the media's discourse, we tried to better qualify its effects from two complementary approaches. We carried out a review of the literature on the subject to which we associated a regular assessment of the children's global clinical state in the entire active file of the child-psychiatry department of the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Brest throughout the lockdown period.The findings of the literature review on the psychological effects of lockdowns or quarantines during past or current epidemics, in particular in China, report many deleterious and variable effects such as symptoms of anxiety, depression, as well as Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, at a significant rate. However, the definition of the situations experienced and the contexts in which those studies took place appear to be not truly comparable to the French situation. Moreover, the effects of the fear of contamination are not differentiated from those linked to confinement itself. Patients and methods: Among children and adolescents under the care of the above department, 354 underwent an assessment of the impact of lockdown on their global clinical condition using the Clinical Global Impression Improvement (CGI-I) performed by their usual practitioner during the period from March 16 to May 11, 2020. Results: Our results highlight that 50% of children remained in stable condition, 25 to 30% improved and 20 to 25% experienced a slight degradation. The evolution of the clinical status appeared stable over time during the eight weeks. The initial age or severity of mental disorder had no significant influence, although there was a slightly more frequent improvement in adolescents. Conclusion: These results are quite inconsistent with general discourse and common expectations. Several psychopathological hypotheses are discussed to support this absence of psychological degradation which might even be extended to children and adolescents in the general population.","Lavenne-Collot, N; Ailliot, P; Badic, S; Favé, A; François, G; Saint-André, S; Thierry, A; Bronsard, G",Neuropsychiatr. enfance adolesc,726,16

Demographic, characteristics, and computed tomography findings of patients with positive RT-PCR test results were analyzed. Results: The mean age of patients was 51.27 (6.45) years, and 72.5% were male. The median admission period of patients was 4 (1-10) days, and the mean length of hospital stay was 10.49 (6.6) days. The mean CT result time was 33.24 (11.56) minutes, and RT-PCR was 35.53 (14.36) hours. The most common complaint was a fever. Furthermore, shortness of breath and dry cough was other evident complaints. Only 7.8% of patients were asymptomatic. In 84.3% and 80.5% of patients had increased C-reactive protein levels and increased ferritin levels, while in 41.2% of patients had decreased lymphocyte count. Bilateral lung involvement, multifocal localized lung lesions, peripheral and central distribution of lesions were detected in most patients. Lesions were located at the posterior lung in more than half of the patients. The rate of involvement of the lower lobes was higher. Some 84.5% of the patients had two or more lobe involvements.

Historically, programs were based on cervical cytology (i.e., ""Pap smear""), which had to be repeated often because of its limited sensitivity and reproducibility. In more recent years, the discovery of human papillomavirus (HPV) as the necessary cause of virtually all cervical cancers has led to the introduction of HPV testing into clinical practice, first as a triage test for minor cytologic abnormalities, then in conjunction with cervical cytology (cotesting), and most recently, as a standalone screening test. Multiple randomized trials have shown that HPV-based screening has higher sensitivity compared with cytology, providing great reassurance against cervical precancer and cancer for women testing HPV-negative for many years. Analyses have also been conducted in support of the recent U.S. Preventive Services Task Force guidelines that show that primary HPV screening achieves the greatest balance of benefits and harms compared with other strategies. An added benefit of primary HPV testing is the ability to conduct it from self-collected samples, which is critical for extending coverage among hard-to-reach individuals and could provide a safe and effective alternative to in-person screening visits during the COVID-19 pandemic.See related article by Liang et al., p. 474.","Wentzensen, Nicolas; Clarke, Megan A",Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev,726,14

An online survey was sent to family practitioners, pediatricians, and pediatric infectious disease specialists to ascertain their thoughts on vaccination during the pandemic. A majority of family practitioners stated that, despite hesitations, families brought their children for vaccination. They noted that vaccination should be emphasized, physicians should be supported by health authorities, and all related media and social media channels should be used to promote maintaining vaccinations. In contrast, pediatricians and pediatric infectious disease specialists were of the opinion that families were expressing greater hesitation and would not bring their children for vaccination. Vaccination rates in Ankara have decreased 2-5% during the pandemic, and the greatest decrease was observed for vaccines administered after 18 months of age. Outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases can threaten community health worldwide.

En mars 2020, de nombreux cas ont été déclarés dans trois quartiers défavorisés où vit une importante communauté gitane. Une étude de séroprévalence a été menée en juillet 2020 afin d’évaluer le niveau de contamination dans ces quartiers à l’issue de la première vague et d’identifier des facteurs associés à la séropositivité. Matériels et méthodes Cette étude est une enquête transversale menée auprès de la population de 6 ans et plus de ces trois quartiers. Les logements ont été sélectionnés par tirage systématique et les participants par tirage aléatoire. Cette sélection a été réalisée par des enquêteurs terrain préalablement formés. La passation des questionnaires et les prélèvements sanguins des participants ont été effectués dans des centres Covid dédiés. Ces prélèvements ont été soumis à des tests de détection des anticorps IgG et IgM grâce au test immunologique EIecsys® Anti-SARS-CoV-2.

La prévalence de l’obésité était de 40,7 % (35,8–45,8) et les personnes obèses étaient plus susceptibles d’être séropositives (ORa=2,0 [1,1–3,8], p=0,024). La présence de cas cliniques de la COVID-19 intrafamiliaux augmentait le risque d’être séropositif (Un cas : ORa=2,5 [1,3–5,0], p=0,007). Dans le quartier le plus touché, le risque d’être séropositif était supérieur pour les personnes vivant dans un logement de petite taille (1 ou 2 pièces vs 4 pièces ;ORa=2,8 [1,2–6,3], p=0,016). Le fait de travailler pendant le confinement était associé à une baisse de la probabilité de séropositivité (ORa=0,18 [0,03–1,0], p=0,048). Conclusion La transmission du SARS-COV-2 a été importante dans cette population vulnérable lors de la première vague épidémique de la COVID-19. Ces résultats soulignent la nécessité de renforcer et d’adapter des mesures de prévention, en prenant en compte l’ensemble des déterminants sociaux de la santé et notamment les conditions de logement.","Beaumont, A.; Durand, C.; Ledrans, M.; Schwoebel, V.; Noel, H.; Diulius, D.; Colombain, L.; Médus, M.; Gueudet, P.; Aumaître, H.",Infectious Diseases Now,726,1

Collagen/chitosan (Col/CT) blends emerge as biomaterials that meet the mechanical and biological requirements associated with bone tissue. In this work, we optimize the osteogenic effect of 3D microstructures by their functionalization with Col/CT blends with different blending ratios. The structures were fabricated by laser direct writing via two-photons polymerization of IP-L780 photopolymer. They comprised of hexagonal and ellipsoidal units 80 µm in length, 40 µm in width and 14 µm height, separated by 20 µm pillars. Structures' functionalization was achieved via dip coating in Col/CT blends with specific blending ratios. The osteogenic role of Col/CT functionalization of the 3D structures was confirmed by biological assays concerning the expression of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and osteocalcin secretion as osteogenic markers and Alizarin Red (AR) as dye for mineral deposits in osteoblast-like cells seeded on the structures. The structures having ellipsoidal units showed the best results, but the trends were similar for both ellipsoidal and hexagonal units. The strongest osteogenic effect was obtained for Col/CT blending ratio of 20/80, as demonstrated by the highest ALP activity, osteocalcin secretion and AR staining intensity in the seeded cells compared to all the other samples.","Paun, Irina Alexandra; Mustaciosu, Cosmin Catalin; Popescu, Roxana Cristina; Calin, Bogdan Stefanita; Mihailescu, Mona",,726,20

There are few studies to identify potential risk and protective factors related to anxiety during COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We collected information on demographic data and lifestyles by a web-based survey of 19,802 participants from 34 provinces in China during COVID-19 pandemic. Level of anxiety was evaluated using the Self-Rating Anxiety Scale. We used ordinal multivariable logistic regression to estimate the associations of anxiety level with potential risk and protective factors. We further developed a new score to simplify the assessment of anxiety during COVID-19 crisis. RESULTS: Among 19,802 participants, we found that those who were front-line medical personnel, suffered from chronic disease, with present symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection or contact history had 112, 93, 40 and 15% increased risk of higher anxiety level; while those with knowledge about personal protective measures or wore masks had 75 and 29% lower risk of higher anxiety level respectively. We developed a risk score by calculating the sum of single score of 17 factors. Each one increase of the risk score was associated with a 297% increase in anxiety index score. In categorical analysis, low risk (the risk score between 1 to 2), the moderate risk group (the risk score of 3) and high risk group (the risk score &#8805; 4) had - 0.40 (95% CI: - 1.55, 0.76), 1.44 (95% CI: 0.27, 2.61) and 9.18 (95% CI: 8.04, 10.33) increase in anxiety index score, and 26% (95% CI: - 7, 72%), 172% (95% CI: 100, 270%), and 733% (95% CI: 516, 1026%) higher risk of anxiety respectively, when compared with the very low risk group (the risk score of 0). The AUC was 0.73 (95% CI, 0.72, 0.74) for the model fitted the developed risk score, with the cut-off point of 3.5. CONCLUSIONS: These findings revealed protective and risk factors associated with anxiety, and developed a simple method of identifying people who are at an increased risk of anxiety during COVID-19 pandemic.","Zhong, Jingyi; Zhong, Chenghui; Qiu, Lan; Li, Jiayi; Lai, Jiayi; Lu, Wenfeng; Wang, Shuguang; Zhong, Jiacai; Zhao, Jing; Zhou, Yun",BMC Public Health,726,20

Considering the changing landscape of HCV treatment, prevention, and care, and in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, this analysis seeks to evaluate Sweden's progress towards the World Health Organization (WHO) elimination targets and identify remaining barriers. METHODS: The data used for modelling HCV transmission and disease burden in Sweden were obtained through literature review, unpublished sources and expert input. A dynamic Markov model was employed to forecast population sizes and incidence of HCV through 2030. Two scenarios ('2019 Base' and 'WHO Targets') were developed to evaluate Sweden's progress towards HCV elimination. RESULTS: At the beginning of 2019, there were 29 700 (95% uncertainty interval: 19 300-33 700) viremic infections in Sweden. Under the base scenario, Sweden would achieve and exceed the WHO targets for diagnosis, treatment and liver-related death. However, new infections would decrease by less than 10%, relative to 2015. Achieving all WHO targets by 2030 would require (i) expanding harm reduction programmes to reach more than 90% of people who inject drugs (PWID) and (ii) treating 90% of HCV + PWID engaged in harm reduction programmes and &#8805;7% of PWID not involved in harm reduction programmes, annually by 2025. CONCLUSIONS: It is of utmost importance that Sweden, and all countries, find sustainability in HCV programmes by broadening the setting and base of providers to provide stability and continuity of care during turbulent times.","Blach, Sarah; Blomé, Marianne; Duberg, Ann-Sofi; Jerkeman, Anna; Kåberg, Martin; Klasa, Per-Erik; Lagging, Martin; Razavi-Shearer, Devin; Razavi, Homie; Aleman, Soo",Liver int,726,20

Patients with prior renal insufficiency are particularly susceptible to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), due to their immune dysfunction. However, most patients with COVID-19 do not have a history of kidney dysfunction, and few studies have focused on the incidence of AKI among COVID-19 patients without chronic kidney disease (CKD). In this study, we aimed to investigate the occurrence of AKI in severely and critically ill COVID-19 patients, with a particular focus on those without a CKD history. METHODS: A single-center retrospective study of 96 patients with COVID-19 in China between February 7 and March 3, 2020 was conducted. All patients were diagnosed by nucleic acid test (NAT) for SARS-CoV-2. Enrolled patients were divided into the severely or critically ill group according to the defined criteria. Patients' epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory characteristics, along with their treatment information, were collected from the medical history system. The occurrence of AKI was compared between the severe and critical patients, and between patients with or without a history of CKD. The diagnostic criteria for AKI included an increase in the serum creatinine level to &#8805;1.5-fold the level at baseline within 7 days according to the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines. Renal outcomes were defined as AKI or non-AKI. RESULTS: Four patients (4.2%) developed AKI, all of whom were in the critically ill group, and 3 (75%) of whom died. Out of the 90 severely and critically ill COVID-19 patients without CKD, 3 (3.3%) patients developed AKI; out of the 6 patients with CKD, 1 (16.7%) patient developed AKI. Age, disease severity, procalcitonin, C-reactive protein, and interleukin-6 were correlated with AKI onset in severely and critically ill COVID-19 patients, while lymphocyte count and estimated glomerular filtration rate at admission were inversely related to the development of AKI. CONCLUSIONS: Only 3.3% of severely and critically ill COVID-19 patients without CKD in our research cohort developed AKI. Critically ill patients may be more susceptible to AKI than severely ill patients.","Yu, Yue; Ge, Huipeng; Wang, Xiufen; Huang, Zhonghua; Chen, Lei; Han, Yun; Jiang, Dayang; Tao, Lijian; Zhou, Qiaoling; Peng, Zhangzhe; Xiao, Xiangcheng",Ann. palliat. med.

We discuss the implications this has for both practical fact-checking and research on automated fact-checking, including task formulation and dataset design. We report a manual analysis undertaken to explore factors underlying varying claim difficulty and categorize several distinct types of difficulty. We argue that prediction of claim difficulty is a missing component of today's automated fact-checking architectures, and we describe how this difficulty prediction task might be split into a set of distinct subtasks.","Singh, Prakhar; Das, Anubrata; Li, Junyi Jessy; Lease, Matthew",,726,16

This study aimed to provide an overview of the current situation of anti-COVID-19 measures in Japanese enterprises during the winter, considering company size. METHODS: This study was an Internet-based nationwide cross-sectional study. Individuals who were registered as full-time workers were invited to participate in the survey. Data were collected using an online self-administered questionnaire in December 2020. The chi-squared test for trend was performed to calculate the P-value for trend for each workplace measure across company sizes. RESULTS: For the 27 036 participants, across company sizes, the most prevalent workplace measure was encouraging mask wearing at work, followed by requesting that employees refrain from going to work when ill and restricting work-related social gatherings and entertainment. These measures were implemented by approximately 90% of large-scale enterprises and by more than 40% of micro- and small-scale enterprises. In contrast, encouraging remote working was implemented by less than half of large-scale enterprises and by around 20% of micro- and small-scale enterprises. There were statistically significant differences in all workplace measures by company size (all P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: We found that various responses to COVID-19 had been taken in workplaces. However, some measures, including remote working, were still not well-implemented, especially in smaller enterprises. The findings suggest that occupational health support for MSMEs is urgently needed to mitigate the current wave of COVID-19.","Ishimaru, Tomohiro; Nagata, Masako; Hino, Ayako; Yamashita, Satoshi; Tateishi, Seiichiro; Tsuji, Mayumi; Ogami, Akira; Matsuda, Shinya; Fujino, Yoshihisa",J Occup Health,726,29

Malta's population density, large proportion of elderly and high prevalence of diabetes and obesity put the country at risk of uncontrolled viral transmission and high mortality. Despite this, Malta achieved low mortality rates compared to figures overseas. The aim of this paper is to identify key factors that contributed to these favorable outcomes. METHODS: This is a retrospective, observational, nationwide study which evaluates outcomes of patients during the first wave of the pandemic in Malta, from the 7th of March to the 24th of April 2020. Data was collected on demographics and mode of transmission. Hospitalization rates to Malta's main general hospital, Mater Dei Hospital, length of in-hospital stay, intensive care unit admissions and 30-day mortality were also analyzed. RESULTS: There were 447 confirmed cases in total; 19.5% imported, 74.2% related to community transmission and 6.3% nosocomially transmitted. Ninety-three patients (20.8%) were hospitalized, of which 4 were children. Patients with moderate-severe disease received hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, in line with evidence available at the time. A total of 4 deaths were recorded, resulting in an all-cause mortality of 0.89%. Importantly, all admitted patients with moderate-severe disease survived to 30-day follow up. CONCLUSION: Effective public health interventions, widespread testing, remote surveillance of patients in the community and a low threshold for admission are likely to have contributed to these favorable outcomes. Hospital infection control measures were key in preventing significant nosocomial spread. These concepts can potentially be applied to stem future outbreaks of viral diseases. Patients with moderate-severe disease had excellent outcomes with no deaths reported at 30-day follow up.","Micallef, Sarah; Piscopo, Tonio V; Casha, Ramon; Borg, Denise; Vella, Chantal; Zammit, Maria-Alessandra; Borg, Janice; Mallia, Daniela; Farrugia, James; Vella, Sarah Marie; Xerri, Thelma; Portelli, Anette; Fenech, Manuel; Fsadni, Claudia; Mallia Azzopardi, Charles",PLoS One,726,16

That is, stock market returns declined as the number of confirmed cases increased. We further find that stock markets reacted more proactively to the growth in number of confirmed cases as compared to the growth in number of deaths. Our analysis also suggests negative market reaction was strong during early days of confirmed cases and then between 40 and 60 days after the initial confirmed cases.

Methods: Retrospective single-centre cohort study. Services location, IVIs scheduling, utilization of staff, data recording methods, ophthalmic examination and surgical procedures were analysed;a new Intravitreal Injection Centre (IVIC) was developed according to Lean principles. Mean number of daily IVIs performed, mean time between registration and discharge, mean turnover time in between patients, percentages of performed IVIs on the monthly scheduled IVIs and of patients rating their experience ⩾8/10 via standardized feedback questionnaires were retrospectively analysed. Results: The mean IVIs number per day increased from 20 ± 4.08 to 50 ± 7.07, and the mean time between registration and discharge of a patient decreased from 240 ± 14.14 to 60 ± 8.16 min (p = 0.00057 and p &lt; 0.00001, respectively). Mean turnover time in between patients decreased from 10 ± 1.41 to 8 ± 2 min (p = 0.055).

The effect of weather on COVID-19 spreading needs more detailed examination, as some studies have claimed to mitigate its spread. COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by WHO and has been reported in about 210 countries worldwide, including Asia, Europe, the USA, and North America. Person-to-person contact and international air travel between the nations were the leading causes behind the spreading of SARS-CoV-2 from its point of origin, besides the natural forces. However, further spread and infection within the community or country can be aided by natural elements, such as the weather. Therefore, the correlation between COVID-19 and temperature can be better elucidated in countries like Pakistan, where SARS-CoV-2 has affected at least 0.37 million people. This study collected Pakistan's COVID-19 infection and mortality data for ten months (March–December 2020). Related weather parameters, temperature, and humidity were also obtained for the same course of time. The collected data were processed and used to compare the performance of various time series prediction models in terms of mean squared error (MSE), root-mean-squared error (RMSE), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). This paper, using the time series model, estimates the effect of humidity, temperature, and other weather parameters on COVID-19 transmission by obtaining the correlation among the total infected cases and the number of deaths and weather variables in a particular region. Results depict that weather parameters hold more influence in evaluating the sum number of cases and deaths than other factors like community, age, and the total population. Therefore, temperature and humidity are salient parameters for predicting COVID-19 affected instances. Moreover, it is concluded that the higher the temperature, the lesser the mortality due to COVID-19 infection.

We assessed the effectiveness of containment measures by estimating transmissibility (effective reproduction number, (Equation is included in full-text article.)) over the course of the outbreak. METHODS: We used a Bayesian data augmentation framework to allocate infectors to infectees with no known infectors and determine serial interval distribution parameters via Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling. We fitted a smoothing spline to the number of secondary cases generated by each infector by respective onset dates to estimate (Equation is included in full-text article.)and evaluated increase in mean number of secondary cases per individual for each day's delay in starting isolation or quarantine. RESULTS: As of April 1, 2020, 1000 COVID-19 cases were reported in Singapore. We estimated a mean serial interval of 4.6 days [95% credible interval (CI) = 4.2, 5.1] with a SD of 3.5 days (95% CI = 3.1, 4.0). The posterior mean (Equation is included in full-text article.)was below one for most of the time, peaking at 1.1 (95% CI = 1.0, 1.3) on week 9 of 2020 due to a spreading event in one of the clusters.

DESIGN: Caregivers of children <18 years old with childhood-onset motor impairment (primarily cerebral palsy) completed an anonymous survey through the online platform REDCap between May 5 and July 13, 2020. RESULTS: The survey was completed by 102 participants. Before the pandemic, 92 of 102 children (90%) were receiving one or more therapies; at the time surveyed, 55 children (54%) were receiving any therapies (p < .001). Greater than 40% of the sample reported increased child stress, decreased physical activity, and/or decline in mobility/movement. Participants who reported a decrease in number of therapies at the time surveyed more frequently reported lower satisfaction with treatment delivery (p < .001), decline in child's mobility (p = .001), and increased caregiver stress (p = .004). Five qualitative themes were identified from open-ended question responses related to therapies and well-being. CONCLUSIONS: Access to pediatric rehabilitation therapies was disrupted during COVID-19. Disrupted access may be related to impact on physical and mental health. With the expansion of telehealth, caregiver and child feedback should be incorporated to optimize benefit.","Sutter, Ellen N; Francis, Linda Smith; Francis, Sunday M; Lench, Daniel H; Nemanich, Samuel T; Krach, Linda E; Sukal-Moulton, Theresa; Gillick, Bernadette T",Am. j. phys. med. rehabilit,726,20

METHODS: This Type 1 hybrid implementation-effectiveness study involves a pre-post design (implementation study) followed by a randomized trial of PSS (effectiveness study). Participants are at least 114 justice and service staff from 7 sites in three states: probation officers, community treatment providers, a supervisor from each agency, and key stakeholders. The study will recruit up to 680 individuals on probation from seven adult community probation offices; eligible individuals will be recently committed, English speakers, with opioid use disorder (OUD). Core Implementation Study: The study will use the exploration, preparation, implementation, sustainability (EPIS) framework to guide system-change through facilitated LCTs of probation and community treatment staff given a core set of implementation strategies to set goals. The study will collect program-level and staff survey data at the end of each EPIS stage. Implementation outcomes: Organizational engagement in MOUD (primary), plus changes in staff knowledge/attitudes and organizational outcomes (secondary). Effectiveness Study of PSS: After completing implementation, the study will randomize adults on probation to receive PSS vs. treatment as usual, with assessments at baseline, 3, 6 and 12 months. Effectiveness outcomes include participant engagement in MOUD (primary), probation revocation, illicit opioid use, and overdoses. Other aims include identifying barriers and facilitators, and cost-benefit analysis of PSS. Adaptations in response to COVID-19 included moving many procedures to remote methods.","Martin, Rosemarie A; Stein, L A R; Rohsenow, Damaris J; Belenko, Steven; Hurley, Linda E; Clarke, Jennifer G; Brinkley-Rubinstein, Lauren",J Subst Abuse Treat,726,1

The aim of this systematic review is to investigate the relationship between COVID-19 and obesity. METHODS: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis. A literature search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, Scopus, Web of Science, CENTRAL, OpenGrey and preprint servers medRxiv and bioRxiv was performed, with no restriction on language or date of publication. Primary outcomes of this study were intensive care unit (ICU) admission or critical disease, severe disease and mortality. Secondary outcome was a positive COVID-19 test. Meta-analysis was performed using OpenMeta-Analyst software, and heterogeneity was tested using Cochran's Q test and I2 statistic. The study protocol was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42020184953). RESULTS: A total of 1,493 articles were identified and 61 studies on 270,241 patients were included. The pooled prevalence of obesity was 27.6% (95% confidence interval [CI] 22.0-33.2) in hospitalised patients. Obesity was not significantly associated with increased ICU admission or critical illness (odds ratio [OR] 1.25, 95% CI 0.99-1.58, P=0.062, I2 =31.0) but was significantly associated with more severe disease (OR 3.13, 95% CI 1.41-6.92, P=0.005, I2 =82.6), mortality (OR 1.36, 95% CI 1.09-1.69, P=0.006, I2=88.5) and a positive COVID-19 test (OR 1.50, 95% CI 1.25-1.81, P<0.001). CONCLUSION: Obesity increased the risk of severe disease, mortality and infection with COVID-19. Higher body mass index was associated with ICU admission and critical disease. Patients who are obese may be more susceptible to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, and infected patients should be monitored closely for adverse outcomes.","Ho, Jamie S Y; Fernando, Daniel I; Chan, Mark Y; Sia, Ching Hui",Ann Acad Med Singap,726,1

A key question is the role of pre-existing psychiatric disorders in how such measures are experienced. METHODS: During the first country-wide lockdown imposed in France, a Covid-19 module was added to the French portion of the ongoing World Mental Health International college student survey. The present study focuses on respondents who completed the survey during that time frame (n = 291). RESULTS: Students with prior depression endorsed greater increases in anxiety (72.2% vs 50.9%) and stress (72.2% vs 49.4%), as well as greater decreases in concentration (87.0% vs 72.9%) during lockdown as compared to those without depression history. In multivariate analyses, prior depression was associated with overall stress (AOR = 5.50), financial stress (AOR = 1.95), family stress (AOR = 2.47), work related stress (AOR = 5.15), and stress related to loved ones (AOR = 2.21). Prior depression was also associated with greater probability experiencing increased anxiety (AOR = 2.61) and stress (AOR = 2.55) during lockdown. CONCLUSIONS: The findings indicate that the best predictor of experiencing stress and anxiety during the first Covid-19 lockdown was a history of depression prior to the pandemic outbreak. Implementing public health measures such as mandatory national lockdowns should be accompanied by strategies for reaching out to those who are vulnerable due to a history of mental illness.","Husky, Mathilde M; Kovess-Masfety, Viviane; Gobin-Bourdet, Clara; Swendsen, Joel",Compr Psychiatry,726,24

Past studies have linked the resilience of communities against crisis to social vulnerability and the capacity of local governments to provide public goods and services like health care. Disaster studies, which frequently examine the effect of social ties and mobility, may better help illuminate the current spread of COVID-19. We analyze Japan's 47 prefectures from February 12 to August 31 using 62,722 individual confirmed cases of COVID-19, paired with daily tallies of aggregate Facebook user movement among neighborhoods. Controlling for mobility levels, health care systems, government finance, gender balance, age, income, and education levels of communities, our analysis indicates that areas with strong linking social ties see no or far lower levels of COVID-19 case rates initially. However, case fatality rates rise in such communities once the disease enters as they lack horizontal (bonding) ties which can mitigate its health impacts. We anticipate this study to be a starting point for broader studies of how social ties and mobility influence COVID-19 outcomes worldwide along with shining a light on how different types of social relationships play different roles as a crisis or disaster progresses.","Fraser, Timothy; Aldrich, Daniel P",Sci Rep,726,28

Recent statistics indicate that the majority of the cases are home-treated. Two drugs of interest, Guaifenesin and Bromohexine HCl, are among the add-on therapy for treatment of COVID-19 mild cases, which has raised the need for their simultaneous determination. The analysis of the two drugs of interest was described using ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometric (UPLC-MS/MS) in plasma of healthy human volunteers using tetryzoline HCl as an internal standard (IS) after liquid-liquid extraction. The applied chromatographic conditions were Kinetex C18 (100Å, 2.6 µm X 50 mm X 4.6 mm) column and a mixture of methanol: water (95: 5, v/v) as a mobile phase at flow rate 1 mL/min. The positive ionization mode was used for detecting the ions, by observing the pairs of transition m/z 199< 125 for GUF, m/z 377< 114 for BRM and m/z 201 <131 for IS. The linearity range was from 50-1500 ng/mL for GUF and 0.5-50 µg/mL for BRM. Limit of detection (LOD) was found to be 35.16 and 0.43 ng/ml for GUF and BRM, respectively. The method was validated according to FDA guidance. The proposed method was assessed to be more eco-friendly versus the reported method using the greenness assessment tools: National Environmental Methods Index (NEMI), Assessment of Green Profile (AGP), Green Analytical Procedure Index (GAPI) and Eco-Scale.

Rapid transmission of COVID-19 has caused wide-spread panic. Many established medications have been used to treat the disease symptoms; however, no specific drugs or vaccines have been developed. Organoids derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) may serve as suitable infection models for ex vivo mimicking of the viral life cycle and drug screening. Human iPSC-3D organoids, self-organised tissues with multiple cell environments, have a similar structure and function as real human organs; hence, these organoids allow greater viral infection efficiency, mimic the natural host-virus interactions, and are suitable for long-term experimentation. Here, we suggest the use of a functional human iPSC-organoid that could act as a reliable and feasible ex vivo infection model for investigation of the virus. This approach will provide much needed insight into the underlying molecular dynamics of COVID-19 for the development of novel treatment and prevention strategies.","Zhou, Hang; Liu, Li-Ping; Fang, Mei; Li, Yu-Mei; Zheng, Yun-Wen",Histol Histopathol,726,24

In the present study, gentamicin sulfate (GS)/alendronate (ALN)-dual-loaded gelatin modified PMMA bone cement (GAPBC) was fabricated to provide rapid and continuous antibiotic release and long-term anti-osteoporotic therapy. Specifically, the gelatin microspheres were loaded with the drugs using separate methodologies, namely, ALN was loaded during fabrication of the gelatin microspheres after which GS was absorbed onto the gelatin from solution. The results demonstrate that sequential release of the GS and ALN was achieved, GS release playing a major role over the first 24 hours and ALN release dominant after 3 weeks of immersion in PBS, resulting from the graded distribution within the gelatin microspheres, and the final drug release ratio of GS (73.6%) and ALN (68.5%) from the modified bone cement was significantly higher than from PMMA bone cement. Therefore, GAPBC represents a potential drug carrier for future clinical applications.","Chen, Lei; Tang, Yufei; Zhao, Kang; Zha, Xiang; Wei, Min; Tan, Quanchang; Wu, Zixiang",,726,2

Currently, there is no effective treatment and vaccines seem to be the solution in the future. Virtual screening of potential drugs against the S protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has provided small molecular compounds with a high binding affinity. Unfortunately, most of these drugs do not attach with the binding interface of the receptor-binding domain (RBD)-angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) complex in host cells. Molecular modeling was carried out to evaluate the potential antiviral properties of the components of the medicinal herb Uncaria tomentosa (cat's claw) focusing on the binding interface of the RBD-ACE-2 and the viral spike protein. The in silico approach starts with protein-ligand docking of 26 Cat's claw key components followed by molecular dynamics simulations and re-docked calculations. Finally, we carried out drug-likeness calculations for the most qualified cat's claw components. The structural bioinformatics approaches led to the identification of several bioactive compounds of U. tomentosa with potential therapeutic effect by dual strong interaction with interface of the RBD-ACE-2 and the ACE-2 binding site on SARS-CoV-2 RBD viral spike. In addition, in silico drug-likeness indices for these components were calculated and showed good predicted therapeutic profiles of these phytochemicals found in U. tomentosa (cat's claw).

The objective was to examine what communication methods, other than in-person visits, during the pandemic were associated with greater positive and lower negative emotional experiences for LTC residents and their family members and friends. DESIGN: Cross-sectional. SETTING: Nationally targeted online survey. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred sixty-one community-dwelling adults who had a family member or friend in a LTC facility. MEASUREMENTS: The Positive and Negative Affect Scale was used to assess participant's own emotions and perceived resident emotions during the pandemic. Questions were asked about nine communication methods other than physical visits (e.g., phone, video-conference, e-mail, and letters) in terms of frequency of use during the pandemic. Sociodemographics, resident health, and facility factors were assessed and used as covariates where indicated. RESULTS: During the pandemic, greater phone frequency was associated with less participant negative emotions (ß = -0.17). Greater e-mail frequency was associated with more perceived resident positive emotions (ß = 0.28). Greater frequency of letters delivered by staff was associated with more participant negative emotions (ß = 0.23). Greater frequency of letters delivered by staff and the postal service were associated with more perceived resident negative emotions (ß = 0.28; ß = 0.34, respectively). CONCLUSION: These findings highlight the importance of synchronous, familiar methods of communication like the phone and email between families and LTC residents to maintain their emotional well-being when in-person visits are restricted.","Monin, Joan K; Ali, Talha; Syed, Sumaiyah; Piechota, Amanda; Lepore, Michael; Mourgues, Catalina; Gaugler, Joseph E; Marottoli, Richard; David, Daniel",Am J Geriatr Psychiatry,726,16

Method: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycInfo, CINAHL, Scopus, Web of Science, PsyArXiv, medRxiv, and bioRxiv from inception to May 13-16, 2020. Inclusion criteria: primary studies, reviews, and meta-analyses; reporting the impact of epidemics; with a primary outcome of suicide, suicidal behavior, suicidal ideation, and/or self-harm. Exclusion criteria: not concerned with suicide-related outcomes; not suitable for data extraction. PROSPERO registration: #CRD42020187013. Results: Eight primary papers were included, examining the effects of five epidemics on suicide-related outcomes. There was evidence of increased suicide rates among older adults during SARS and in the year following the epidemic (possibly motivated by social disconnectedness, fears of virus infection, and concern about burdening others) and associations between SARS/Ebola exposure and increased suicide attempts. A preprint study reported associations between COVID-19 distress and past-month suicidal ideation. Limitations: Few studies have investigated the topic; these are of relatively low methodological quality.

Molecular imaging (MI) aims to quantitatively characterize, visualize, and measure the biological processes or living cells at molecular and genetic levels. MI modalities have been exploited in different applications including noninvasive determination and visualization of diseased tissues, cell trafficking visualization, early detection, treatment response monitoring, and in vivo visualization of living cells. High affinity molecular probe and imaging modality to detect the probe are the two main requirements of MI. Recent advances in nanotechnology and allied modalities, have facilitated the use of nanoparticles (NPs) as MI probes. Within the extensive group of NPs, fluorescent NPs play a prominent role in optical molecular imaging. The fluorescent NPs used in molecular and cellular imaging can be categorized into three main groups including quantum dots (QDs), upconversion, and dye-doped NPs. Fluorescent NPs have great potentials in targeted theranostics including cancer imaging, immunoassay based cells, proteins and bacteria detections, imaging-guided surgery and therapy. Fluorescent NPs have shown promising potentials for drug and gene delivery, detection of the chromosomal abnormalities, labeling of DNA, and visualizing DNA replication dynamics. Multifunctional NPs have been successfully used in a single theranostic modality integrating diagnosis and therapy. The unique characteristics of multifunctional NPs make them potential theranostic agents that can be utilized concurrently for diagnosis and therapy. This review provides state of the art of the nanotechnological applications for early cancer diagnosis focusing on fluorescent NPs, their synthesis methods and perspectives in clinical theranostics.","Jin, Ke-Tao; Yao, Jia-Yu; Ying, Xiao-Jiang; Lin, Yan; Chen, Yun-Fang",Curr. top. med. chem,726,16

During pregnancy, disruptions in homeostasis may increase the likelihood of preterm birth and pre-eclampsia. Expectant mothers traditionally have high rates of anxiety and depressive disorders and many are susceptible to a variety of stressors during pregnancy. These common life stressors include financial concerns and relationship challenges and may be exacerbated by the biologic, social and psychologic changes occurring during pregnancy. In addition, external stressors such as major weather events (e.g., hurricanes, tornados, floods) and other global phenomena (e.g., the COVID-19 pandemic) may contribute to significant stress during pregnancy. This review investigates recent literature published about the use of non-pharmacologic modalities for stress relief in pregnancy and examines the interplay between psychiatric diagnoses and stressors, with the purpose of evaluating the feasibility of implementing non-pharmacologic interventions as sole therapies or in conjunction with psychotherapy or psychiatric medication therapy. Further, the effectiveness of each non-pharamacologic therapy in reducing symptoms of maternal stress is reviewed. Mindfulness meditation and biofeedback have shown effectiveness in improving one's mental health such as depressive symptoms and anxiety. Exercise, including yoga, may improve both depressive symptoms and birth outcomes. Expressive writing has successfully been applied post-partum and in response to pregnancy challenges. Though some of these non-pharmacologic interventions can be convenient and low cost, there is a trend towards inconsistent implementation of these modalities. Future investigations should focus on methods to increase ease of uptake , ensure each option is available at home, and a standardized way to evaluate whether combinations of different interventions may provide added benefit.","Traylor, Claire S; Johnson, Jasmine; Kimmel, Mary C; Manuck, Tracy A",Am J Obstet Gynecol MFM,726,16

The pathological findings in placentas delivered from 198 SARS-CoV-2-positive pregnant women were investigated for the presence of lesions associated with placental SARS-CoV-2 infection. SARS-CoV-2 infection was investigated in placental tissues through immunohistochemistry, and positive cases were further confirmed by in situ hybridization. SARS-CoV-2 infection was also investigated by RT-PCR in 33 cases, including all the immunohistochemically positive cases. Nine cases were SARS-CoV-2-positive by immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization, and RT-PCR. These placentas showed lesions characterized by villous trophoblast necrosis with intervillous space collapse and variable amounts of mixed intervillous inflammatory infiltrate and perivillous fibrinoid deposition. Such lesions ranged from focal to massively widespread in five cases, resulting in intrauterine fetal death. Two of the stillborn fetuses showed some evidence of SARS-CoV-2 positivity. The remaining 189 placentas did not show similar lesions. The strong association between trophoblastic damage and placenta SARS-CoV-2 infection suggests that this lesion is a specific marker of SARS-CoV-2 infection in placenta.

The North East reported the highest number of COVID-19 positive staff; London reported the greatest lack of testing. The reported time required to clear the backlog was 1-12 months. Seventy-one percent of participants used BNMS COVID-19 guidance. CONCLUSION: The first wave caused a major disruption of NM service delivery and impacted on the workforce. The departmental strategies should tailor services to evolving local and regional differences in prevalence of COVID-19. A blanket shutdown of services with a 'one size fits all' strategy would likely have a severe impact on future delivery of NM and health services in general. Timely testing of staff and patients remains of paramount importance.","Dizdarevic, Sabina; Abdulla, Mahdi; Sewedy, Taha; Weston, Charlotte; Oxley, Caroline; Croasdale, Jilly; Redman, Stewart; Vinjamuri, Sobhan; Mayes, Christopher; Flux, Glen; Ward, Mike; Graham, Richard; Buscombe, John",Nucl Med Commun,726,26

Practical artificial-intelligent systems should not have to depend on such prior knowledge. To encourage effort towards this goal, we propose The Amazing Race TM: Robot Edition, a new task of finding a room in an unknown and unmodified office environment by following instructions obtained in spoken dialog from an untrained person. We present a solution that treats this challenge as a series of sub-tasks: natural-language interpretation, autonomous navigation, and semantic mapping. The solution consists of a finite-state-machine system design whose states solve these sub-tasks to complete The Amazing Race TM. Our design is deployed on a real robot and its performance is demonstrated in 52 trials on 4 floors of each of 3 different previously unseen buildings with 13 untrained volunteers.","Johansen, Jared Sigurd; Ilyevsky, Thomas Victor; Siskind, Jeffrey Mark",,726,26

Palliative care facilities deliver early care, alongside antineoplastic treatments, whereas hospice care structures intervene lately, when cancer-modifying treatments stop. AIM: This review identified factors associated with early and late interventions of specialised services, by considering the type of structures studied (palliative vs hospice care). DESIGN: We performed a systematic review, prospectively registered on PROSPERO (ID: CRD42018110063). DATA SOURCES: We searched Medline and Scopus databases for population-based studies. Two independent reviewers extracted the data and assessed the study quality using Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal checklists. RESULTS: The 51 included articles performed 67 analyses. Most were based on retrospective cohorts and US populations. The median quality scores were 19/22 for cohorts and 15/16 for cross-sectional studies. Most analyses focused on hospice care (n=37). Older patients, men, people with haematological cancer or treated in small centres had less specialised interventions. Palliative and hospice facilities addressed different populations. Older patients received less palliative care but more hospice care. Patients with high-stage tumours had more palliative care while women and patients with a low comorbidity burden received more hospice care. CONCLUSION: Main disparities concerned older patients, men and people with haematological cancer. We highlighted the challenges of early interventions for older patients and of late deliveries for men and highly comorbid patients. Additional data on non-American populations, outpatients and factors related to quality of life and socioeconomic status are needed.","Frasca, Matthieu; Galvin, Angeline; Raherison, Chantal; Soubeyran, Pierre; Burucoa, Benoît; Bellera, Carine; Mathoulin-Pelissier, Simone",BMJ support. palliat. care (Online),726,20

Such cases have also been found in other parts of the country. The spread of the novel coronavirus pneumonia epidemic has brought great challenges to the clinical practice of thoracic surgery. Outpatient clinics need to strengthen the differential diagnosis of ground glass opacity and pulmonary plaque shadows. During the epidemic, surgical indications are strictly controlled, and selective surgery is postponed. Patients planning to undergo a limited period of surgery should be quarantined for 2 weeks and have a nucleic acid test when necessary before surgery. For patients who are planning to undergo emergency surgery, nucleic acid testing should be carried out before surgery, and three-level protection should be performed during surgery. Patients who are planning to undergo emergency surgery in the epidemic area should be confirmed with or without novel coronavirus pneumonia before operation, and perform nucleic acid test if necessary. Surgical disinfection and isolation measures should be strictly carried out. Among postoperative patients, cases with new coronavirus infection were actively investigated. For the rescue of patients with novel coronavirus infection, attention needs to be paid to prevention and treatment and related complications, including mechanical ventilation-related pneumothorax or mediastinal emphysema, and injury after tracheal intubation.","Dong, XIE; Sihua, WANG; Gening, JIANG; Yongde, LIAO; Yuming, ZHU; Lei, ZHANG; Zhifei, XU; Keneng, CHEN; Wentao, FANG; Di, GE; Lijie, TAN; Xiaofeng, CHEN; Hecheng, LI; Chuangyan, WU; Song, TONG; Zheng, LIU; Xiangchao, DING; Jiuling, CHEN; Chao, CHENG; Haifeng, WANG; Chang, CHEN",Chinese Journal of Clinical Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery,726,1

In addition to recession and high unemployment, agencies such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warn that stressors associated with a pandemic can cause increased strains, including difficulty concentrating, anxiety, and decreased mental health (CDC, 2020). Two general frameworks that explain these stressor-strain relationships over time include stress-reaction and adaptation models. Stress-reaction models suggest that stressors, such as heightened job demands due to the pandemic, accumulate over time and thus prolonged exposure to these stressors results in both immediate and long-term strain; conversely, adaptation models suggest that people adapt to stressors over time, such that strains produced by ongoing stressors tend to dissipate. After controlling for county-level COVID-19 cases, we found that (a) workers in general exhibited decreasing cognitive weariness and psychological symptoms over time, providing support for the adaptation model; (b) on-site workers experienced increasing physical fatigue over time, supporting the stress-reaction model among those workers; and (c) engaging in recovery behaviors was associated with improvements in cognitive weariness and psychological symptoms for all workers. We also found that our Time 1 outcomes were significantly different than pre-pandemic norms, such that our participants displayed lower initial levels of job-related burnout and higher initial levels of psychological symptoms than pre-pandemic norms. Furthermore, supplemental qualitative data support our quantitative findings for recovery behaviors. These findings have important implications for understanding workers' responses to the pandemic and they can help inform organizational practice.","Michel, Jesse S; Rotch, Michael A; Carson, Jack E; Bowling, Nathan A; Shifrin, Nicole V",Occup Health Sci,726,20

Furthermore, initial response assessment by conventional imaging is often unable to identify which patients will achieve durable clinical benefit (DCB). Here, we demonstrate that pre-treatment circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) and peripheral CD8 T cell levels are independently associated with DCB. We further show that ctDNA dynamics after a single infusion can aid in identification of patients who will achieve DCB. Integrating these determinants, we developed and validated an entirely noninvasive multiparameter assay (DIREct-On, Durable Immunotherapy Response Estimation by immune profiling and ctDNA-On-treatment) that robustly predicts which patients will achieve DCB with higher accuracy than any individual feature. Taken together, these results demonstrate that integrated ctDNA and circulating immune cell profiling can provide accurate, noninvasive, and early forecasting of ultimate outcomes for NSCLC patients receiving ICIs.","Nabet, Barzin Y; Esfahani, Mohammad S; Moding, Everett J; Hamilton, Emily G; Chabon, Jacob J; Rizvi, Hira; Steen, Chloe B; Chaudhuri, Aadel A; Liu, Chih Long; Hui, Angela B; Almanza, Diego; Stehr, Henning; Gojenola, Linda; Bonilla, Rene F; Jin, Michael C; Jeon, Young-Jun; Tseng, Diane; Liu, Cailian; Merghoub, Taha; Neal, Joel W; Wakelee, Heather A; Padda, Sukhmani K; Ramchandran, Kavitha J; Das, Millie; Plodkowski, Andrew J; Yoo, Christopher; Chen, Emily L; Ko, Ryan B; Newman, Aaron M; Hellmann, Matthew D; Alizadeh, Ash A; Diehn, Maximilian",Cell,726,1

Clinical outcome of AIS in the course of COVID-19 remains unknown. We compared early clinical outcome and mortality of COVID-positive (+) patients admitted for AIS with COVID-negative (-) ones. We hypothesized that COVID+ patients would have poorer clinical outcomes and present a higher rate of TEs and mortality compared with COVID- ones. METHODS: In this multicentric observational retrospective study, we enrolled patients over 18 years old admitted for AIS in 3 stroke units of the Parisian region during lockdown from March 17, 2020, to May 2, 2020. COVID-19 status as well as demographic, clinical, biological, and imaging data was collected retrospectively from medical records. Poor outcome was defined as modified Rankin score (mRS) 3-6 (3-6) at discharge. We also compared TE frequency and mortality rate through a composite criterion in both groups. RESULTS: Two hundred and sixteen patients were enrolled; mean age was 68 years old, and 63% were male. Forty patients were CO-VID+ (18.5%) and 176 were COVID-. Obesity was statistically more frequent in the COVID+ group (36 vs. 13% p < 0.01). The percentage of patients with mRS (3-6) at discharge was higher in the COVID+ group compared with the COVID- group (60 vs. 41%, p = 0.034). The main predictor of presenting a mRS (3-6) at discharge was high NIHSS score at admission (OR, CI 95%: 1.325, 1.22-1.43). Mortality rate was higher in the COVID+ group (12 vs. 3.4%, p = 0.033) as well as TE frequency (15 vs. 2.8%, p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: In this study, patients with AIS infected by SARS-CoV-2 showed a poorer early outcome than COVID- ones. However, when compared to other factors, COVID-19 was not a significant predictor of poor outcome. Vascular morbidity and mortality rates were significantly higher in the COVID+ group compared with the COVID- group.","Calmettes, Julie; Peres, Roxane; Goncalves, Bruno; Varlan, David; Turc, Guillaume; Obadia, Michael; Nardin, Clotilde; Meppiel, Elodie; De Broucker, Thomas; Mazighi, Mikael; Lyoubi, Aicha",Cerebrovasc Dis,726,20

In this prospective study, the general demographic factors, body mass index, smoking history, depression, hypertension, diabetes, various psychological measures, and uncorrected distant visual acuity of patients with age-related cataract were recorded. Lens Opacities Classification System III (LOCS III) scores and lens density measured by Scheimpflug imaging were used to evaluate the cataracts. LETL was measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Correlations among these parameters were analyzed. The LOCS III nuclear opalescence (NO) score was associated with age (ßâ¯=â¯0.053, Pâ¯<â¯0.001) and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 score (ßâ¯=â¯-0.042, Pâ¯=â¯0.004).

Although reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is the reference standard method to identify patients with COVID-19 infection, chest radiographs and CT chest play a vital role in the detection and management of these patients. Prediction models for COVID-19 imaging are rapidly being developed to support medical decision making. However, inadequate availability of a diverse annotated dataset has limited the performance and generalizability of existing models. To address this unmet need, the RSNA and Society of Thoracic Radiology (STR) collaborated to develop the RSNA International COVID-19 Open Radiology Database (RICORD). This database is the first multi-institutional, multi-national expert annotated COVID-19 imaging dataset. It is made freely available to the machine learning community as a research and educational resource for COVID-19 chest imaging. Pixel-level volumetric segmentation with clinical annotations were performed by thoracic radiology subspecialists for all COVID positive thoracic CTs. The labeling schema was coordinated with other international consensus panels and COVID data annotation efforts, European Society of Medical Imaging Informatics (EUSOMII), the American College of Radiology (ACR) and the American Association of Physicists in Medicine (AAPM). Study level COVID classification labels for chest radiographs were annotated by three radiologists with majority vote adjudication by board certified radiologists.

While many academic institutions are well poised to conduct research, there are well-documented barriers for these institutions, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), to further conduct strategic synthesis and dissemination to promote knowledge utilization among policy-makers. These systemic barriers to knowledge translation (KT) pose significant challenges for academic institutions seeking to take advantage of unprecedented policy windows to inform evidence-based decision-making. Global health funding organizations should prioritize the support of academic institutions' activities along the KT pathway, including both knowledge generation and strategic dissemination, to improve knowledge uptake for decision-making to improve health. Institutional capacity-building initiatives for KT have the potential to profoundly impact responses to this and future pandemics.","Mahendradhata, Yodi; Kalbarczyk, Anna",Health Res Policy Syst,726,7

During the same period, the Norwegian Medicines Agency received 100 reports of suspected fatal adverse reactions to the vaccine. An expert group has examined the reports and assessed the extent of a causal link between vaccination and death. MATERIAL AND METHOD: The expert group worked in two pairs, each of which examined 50 anonymised reports. Each member first examined the reports alone and classified the causality as unlikely, possible, probable, certain or unclassifiable. Each pair then discussed their results until they reached a consensus. All four experts assessed a random sample of 20 reports. The degree of agreement was assessed using weighted kappa and McNemar's test of symmetry. RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 87.7 years (range 61-103 years). Among 100 reported deaths, a causal link to the vaccine was considered probable in 10 cases, possible in 26 and unlikely in 59. Five were unclassifiable. Weighted kappa was 0.40 and 0.38 in the two expert pairs, respectively. INTERPRETATION: Most nursing home patients have a short remaining life expectancy, but vaccination may, in a few cases, have accelerated a process of dying that had already begun. Nursing home patients should still be given priority for vaccination, but the benefits versus risk must be carefully weighed up for the frailest patients.","Wyller, Torgeir Bruun; Kittang, Bård Reiakvam; Ranhoff, Anette Hylen; Harg, Pernille; Myrstad, Marius",Tidsskr. nor. laegeforen,726,30

Data on the effect of coronavirus disease 2019 in pregnancy are limited to small case series. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical characteristics and outcomes in pregnancy and the vertical transmission potential of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection. STUDY DESIGN: Clinical records were retrospectively reviewed for 116 pregnant women with coronavirus disease 2019 pneumonia from 25 hospitals in China between January 20, 2020, and March 24, 2020. Evidence of vertical transmission was assessed by testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in amniotic fluid, cord blood, and neonatal pharyngeal swab samples. RESULTS: The median gestational age on admission was 38+0 (interquartile range, 36+0-39+1) weeks. The most common symptoms were fever (50.9%, 59/116) and cough (28.4%, 33/116); 23.3% (27/116) patients presented without symptoms. Abnormal radiologic findings were found in 96.3% (104/108) of cases. Of the 116 cases, there were 8 cases (6.9%) of severe pneumonia but no maternal deaths. One of 8 patients who presented in the first trimester and early second trimester had a missed spontaneous abortion. Of 99 patients, 21 (21.2%) who delivered had preterm birth, including 6 with preterm premature rupture of membranes. The rate of spontaneous preterm birth before 37 weeks' gestation was 6.1% (6/99). One case of severe neonatal asphyxia resulted in neonatal death. Furthermore, 86 of the 100 neonates tested for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 had negative results; of these, paired amniotic fluid and cord blood samples from 10 neonates used to test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 had negative results. CONCLUSION: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection during pregnancy is not associated with an increased risk of spontaneous abortion and spontaneous preterm birth. There is no evidence of vertical transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection when the infection manifests during the third trimester of pregnancy.","Yan, Jie; Guo, Juanjuan; Fan, Cuifang; Juan, Juan; Yu, Xuechen; Li, Jiafu; Feng, Ling; Li, Chunyan; Chen, Huijun; Qiao, Yuan; Lei, Di; Wang, Chen; Xiong, Guoping; Xiao, Fengyi; He, Wencong; Pang, Qiumei; Hu, Xiaoling; Wang, Suqing; Chen, Dunjin; Zhang, Yuanzhen; Poon, Liona C; Yang, Huixia",Am J Obstet Gynecol,726,31

Protecting healthcare workers including nurses against COVID-19 is crucial, and vaccination could be a viable future option. However, vaccine hesitancy remains a global challenge. Nurses, as a trustworthy and creditable source of vaccine-related information, may build public confidence in vaccination. Hence, research on vaccine hesitancy among nurses is warranted. OBJECTIVES: This study estimated nurses' influenza vaccination behaviors and intention to receive COVID-19 vaccine when available, and examined their corresponding 5C psychological antecedents (confidence, complacency, constraints, calculation, and collective responsibility). To investigate the impact of COVID-19-related work demands, the mediation effects of work stress on the association between work demands and COVID-19 vaccination intention were also examined. DESIGN: Cross-sectional online survey SETTINGS: Nurses were invited to participate via the promotion of a professional nursing organization and by personal referrals during the COVID-19 outbreak in Hong Kong between mid-March and late April 2020. PARTICIPANTS: 1,205 eligible nurses (mean age = 40.79, SD = 10.47; 90% being female) were included in the analyses. METHODS: Demographics, influenza vaccination, intention to have COVID-19 vaccine, the 5C vaccine hesitancy components, work stress and COVID-19-related work demands (insufficient supply of personal protective equipment, involvement in isolation rooms, and unfavorable attitudes towards workplace infection control policies) were reported in the survey. RESULTS: The influenza vaccine uptake rate and the proportion intending to take COVID-19 vaccine were 49% and 63%, respectively. Influenza vaccination was associated with working in public hospitals and all 5C constructs (more confidence, more collective responsibility and less complacency, constraints, and calculation), whereas stronger COVID-19 vaccination intention was associated with younger age, more confidence, less complacency and more collective responsibility. COVID-19-related demands were associated with greater work stress, and hence stronger COVID-19 vaccination intention. CONCLUSION: The potential uptake rate of COVID-19 vaccine among nurses was suboptimal to achieve herd immunity. The 5C constructs were useful in predicting influenza vaccination and, to a lesser extent, the intention to take COVID-19 vaccine. The uncertain attributes such as effectiveness, side effects, and effective duration of the COVID-19 vaccine may contribute to this discrepancy. With less work stress among nurses in the post-pandemic period, the intention to take COVID-19 vaccine will likely drop. The 5C constructs should be infused in vaccination campaigns. While a COVID-19 vaccine could be ready soon, the nursing profession may not be ready to accept it. More research work is needed to boost the uptake rate. TWEETABLE ABSTRACT: Less than two-third of nurses intended to take COVID-19 vaccine when available. While a COVID-19 vaccine could be ready soon, nursing profession is not ready to accept it.","Kwok, Kin On; Li, Kin-Kit; Wei, Wan In; Tang, Arthur; Wong, Samuel Yeung Shan; Lee, Shui Shan",Int J Nurs Stud,726,1

Moreover, the results of the moderation analysis show that Corona fears only moderates the link of Performance Expectancy and Social influence with Behavioral Intention of LMS. The findings imply the need for improving the LMS experience to increase its Behavioral Intention among students. Finally, the author's recommendation for future researchers is to examine the extended model in other countries and territories to analyze Coronavirus's influence on e-learning acceptance.","Raza, Syed A.; Qazi, Wasim; Khan, Komal Akram; Salam, Javeria",J.

This rapid review aims to synthesize this published literature to give the orthopaedic fraternity an overview about the best practices that need to be followed during this period. Methodology: A rapid review was conducted following the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) statement for rapid reviews on the impact of COVID-19 on orthopaedic care and practice. A Pubmed search was done to identify all literature related to the impact of COVID-19 on orthopaedic care and practice, published between December 2019 and October 2020 using a predefined search strategy. The final review included 375 peer-reviewed articles addressing the objectives. Results: The majority of articles were expert opinions ( 37.1%) and narrative reviews (13.1%). There were 17.3% retrospective studies and 2.1% prospective studies with only one randomized control trial and ten systematic reviews. 83.8% of articles had levels of evidence IV and V, 79.5% of the articles were published in core-orthopaedic journals. Maximum publications were from the United States of America (31.7%), followed by India (11.5%). European countries together contributed to 32.0% of all publications. Conclusion: COVID-19 has had a significant impact on all aspects of orthopaedic care and practice. The pandemic has affected outpatient clinics, emergency and elective surgery, rehabilitation, resident training, personnel management, use of personal protective equipment, telemedicine and all sub-specialities of orthopaedics. Orthopaedic practice will require the incorporation of new technologies, restructuring of health systems and reorganizing of training programs for optimal patient care. There would also be a need for frequent review of emerging literature to provide evidence-based guidelines to the orthopaedic fraternity which will not only help in mitigation of transmission of disease but also ensure continuity of optimum patient care.

Objective: We aimed to explore the prevalence and associated factors with PMIEs in a sample of Romanian physicians, of which almost half worked in Covid-19 treatment medical units. Method: We ran a web-based survey in April 2020, three weeks after the general lockdown to contain the novel coronavirus. Participants (N = 114, aged 23 to 67, M = 38.85, SD = 9.82, 74.6% females) answered the PMIE scale items, in addition to questions related to the physical and emotional self-impact related questions, and demographical and work-related variables (i.e. age, gender, medical experience, and speciality). Results: Results suggested that almost 50% of the participants reported high levels of PMIE exposure. No significant associations were found between PMIE exposure, and the type of medical unit physicians worked in (Covid-19 or non-Covid-19), nor their specialization and medical experience. Demographic variables (i.e. age and gender) and experience did not predict PMIE exposure. However, we found significant associations between PMIE and the physicians’ physical and emotional self-reported impact. Conclusions: Healthcare systems, governments, and societies worldwide need to recognize that physicians are prone to PMIE exposure and related adverse psychological outcomes due to their daily activity in containing the pandemic. Public policies need to actively offer and promote psychological support, to protect and help physicians from the adverse mental health outcomes following the pandemic. © 2021 The Author(s).

Every state in the United States enacted policies to encourage distancing and some mandated staying home. Understanding how these policies interact with individuals' voluntary responses to the COVID-19 epidemic is a critical initial step in understanding the role of these nonpharmaceutical interventions in transmission dynamics and assessing policy impacts. We use variation in policy responses along with smart device data that measures the amount of time Americans stayed home to disentangle the extent that observed shifts in staying home behavior are induced by policy. We find evidence that stay-at-home orders and voluntary response to locally reported COVID-19 cases and deaths led to behavioral change. For the median county, which implemented a stay-at-home order with about two cases, we find that the response to stay-at-home orders increased time at home as if the county had experienced 29 additional local cases. However, the relative effect of stay-at-home orders was much greater in select counties. On the one hand, the mandate can be viewed as displacing a voluntary response to this rise in cases. On the other hand, policy accelerated the response, which likely helped reduce spread in the early phase of the pandemic. It is important to be able to attribute the relative role of self-interested behavior or policy mandates to understand the limits and opportunities for relying on voluntary behavior as opposed to imposing stay-at-home orders.","Yan, Youpei; Malik, Amyn A; Bayham, Jude; Fenichel, Eli P; Couzens, Chandra; Omer, Saad B",Proc.

To date, the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients in the non-Wuhan areas of Hubei Province in China have not been described. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the clinical characteristics and treatment progress of 91 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in Jingzhou Central Hospital. RESULTS: Of the 91 patients diagnosed with COVID-19, 30 cases (33.0%) were severe and two patients (2.2%) died. The severe disease group tended to be older (50.5 vs. 42.0 years; p = 0.049) and have more chronic disease (40% vs. 14.8%; p = 0.009) relative to mild disease group. Only 73.6% of the patients were quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR)-positive on their first tests, while typical chest computed tomography images were obtained for each patient. The most common complaints were cough (n = 75; 82.4%), fever (n = 59; 64.8%), fatigue (n = 35; 38.5%), and diarrhea (n = 14; 15.4%). Non-respiratory injury was identified by elevated levels of aspartate aminotransferase (n = 18; 19.8%), creatinine (n = 5; 5.5%), and creatine kinase (n = 14; 15.4%) in laboratory tests. Twenty-eight cases (30.8%) suffered non-respiratory injury, including 50% of the critically ill patients and 21.3% of the mild patients. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the mortality rate of patients in Jingzhou was lower than that of Wuhan. Importantly, we found liver, kidney, digestive tract, and heart injuries in COVID-19 cases besides respiratory problems. Combining chest computed tomography images with the qPCR analysis of throat swab samples can improve the accuracy of COVID-19 diagnosis.","Zhao, Xin-Ying; Xu, Xuan-Xuan; Yin, Hai-Sen; Hu, Qin-Ming; Xiong, Tao; Tang, Yuan-Yan; Yang, Ai-Ying; Yu, Bao-Ping; Huang, Zhi-Ping",BMC Infect Dis,726,24

Methodology: In the following manuscript we describe the presence of leukoerythroblastosis in a male hospitalized for COVID-19, in which multiple causes were ruled out. Results: The patient had resolution of the leukoerythroblatosis as his respiratory symptoms resolved. Conclusion: The COVID-19 disease could be a new known cause of a leukoerythroblastic reaction, although we believe that a greater number of reported cases is necessary to affirm that the association was not random.","Milanesio, Martin; Suasnabar, David Francisco; Giaj-Merlera, Alejandro; Cebreros, Rocío Gabriela; Marucco, Federico Ariel",Rev Fac Cien Med Univ Nac Cordoba,726,27

METHODS: This was a multinational retrospective cohort study including women with laboratory-confirmed SARS-COV-2 from 73 centers from 22 different countries in Europe, United States, South America, Asia and Australia from February 1, 2020 to April 30, 2020. Confirmed SARS-COV-2 infection was defined as a positive result on real-time reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assay of nasal and pharyngeal swab specimens. The primary outcome was a composite measure of maternal mortality and morbidity including admission to intensive care unit (ICU), use of mechanical ventilation, or death. RESULTS: 388 singleton pregnancies tested positive to SARS-COV-2 at RT-PCR nasal and pharyngeal swab were included in the study. The primary outcome was observed in 47/388 women (12.1%). 43/388 women (11.1%) were admitted to ICU, 36/388 (9.3%) required mechanical ventilation, and 3/388 women deceased (0.8%). Of the 388 women included in the study, 122 (31.4%) were still pregnant at the time of the study. Among the other 266 women, 6 had spontaneous first-trimester abortion, 3 had elective termination of pregnancy, 6 had stillbirth, and 251 delivered a live-born infant. The rate of preterm birth less than 37 weeks of gestation was 26.3% (70/266). Of the 251 live-born infants, 69/251 (27.5%) were admitted to NICU, with 5 neonatal deaths (2.0%). The overall rate of perinatal death was 4.1% (11/266). Only one infant (1/251, 0.4%) born from a mother tested positive during the third trimester, was found positive to SARS-COV-2 at RT-PCR.

Asymptomatic spread of COVID-19 from nursing facility staff and residents is a major accelerator of infection. Facility-wide point-prevalence testing is an emerging strategy in disease mitigation. Because time is not available to await the results of randomized controlled trials before implementing strategies in this high-risk setting, an expert Delphi panel composed of experienced long-term care medicine professionals has now met to provide testing guidance for SARS-Coronavirus-2 to NFs. After many email and telephone discussions, the panel responded to a questionnaire that included six different scenarios, based on varying availability of Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) testing and personal protective equipment (PPE). The panel endorsed facility-wide testing of staff and residents without dissent when diagnostic RT-PCR was available. While the panel recognized the limitations of RT-PCR testing, it strongly recommended this testing for both staff and residents in NFs that were either COVID-19 naive or had limited outbreaks. There was also consensus on testing residents with atypical symptoms in a scenario of limited testing capability. The panel favored testing every 1 to 2 weeks if testing was readily available, reducing the frequency to every month as community prevalence declined or as the collection of additional data further informed clinical critical thinking and decision-making. The panel recognized that frequent testing would have consequences in terms of potential staff shortages due to quarantine after positive tests and increased PPE use. However, the panel felt that not testing would allow new clusters of infection to form. The resulting high mortality rate would outweigh the potential negative consequences of testing. The panel also recognized the pandemic as a rapidly evolving crisis, and that new science and increasing experience might require an updating of its recommendations. The panel hopes that its recommendations will be of value to the long-term care industry and to policy makers as we work together to manage through this challenging and stressful time.","Wasserman, M; Ouslander, J G; Lam, A; Wolk, A G; Morley, J E; von Preyss-Friedman, S; Marco, N; Nazir, A; Haimowitz, D; Bessey, F",J Nutr Health Aging,726,24

In this study, we discuss the potential mechanisms that justify the possible impact of COVID-19 on male fertility. The main point of entry of SARS-CoV-2 into the host cells appears to be through the viral spike protein which permits entry into cells via the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2 receptor). In human testes, ACE2 is enriched in Sertoli and Leydig cells and spermatogonia. Also, it seems that there is a mild or severe cytokine storm in patients with severe COVID-19, and such changes may affect fertility. It should also be mentioned that the orchitis caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus may have an important impact on fertility. Prolonged and high fever may lead to changes in testicular temperature and destroy germ cells. In general, there is little evidence for a definite conclusion, but there are facts that suggest that COVID-19 may affect male fertility. It is prudent for men of reproductive age who have recovered from COVID-19 to be evaluated for the presence of the virus in semen and fertility-related items.

Their non-metalized gate dielectrics that are exposed to an electrolyte solution cover the semiconductor material and actively transduce the biological changes on the surface. The efficiency of these novel devices in detecting different biomolecular analytes in a real-time, highly precise, specific, and label-free manner has been validated by numerous research studies. Considerable progress has been attained in designing FET devices, especially for biomedical diagnosis and cell-based assays in the past few decades. The exceptional electronic properties, compactness, and scalability of these novel tools are very desirable for designing rapid, label-free, and mass detection of biomolecules. With the incorporation of nanotechnology, the performance of biosensors based on FET boosts significantly, particularly, employment of nanomaterials such as graphene, metal nanoparticles, single and multi-walled carbon nanotubes, nanorods, and nanowires. Besides, their commercial availability, and high-quality production on a large-scale, turn them to be one of the most preferred sensing and screening platforms. This review presents the basic structural setup and working principle of different types of FET devices. We also focused on the latest progression regarding the use of FET biosensors for the recognition of viruses such as, recently emerged COVID-19, Influenza, Hepatitis B Virus, protein biomarkers, nucleic acids, bacteria, cells, and various ions. Additionally, an outline of the development of FET sensors for investigations related to drug development and the cellular investigation is also presented. Some technical strategies for enhancing the sensitivity and selectivity of detection in these devices are addressed as well. However, there are still certain challenges which are remained unaddressed concerning the performance and clinical use of transistor-based point-of-care (POC) instruments; accordingly, expectations about their future improvement for biosensing and cellular studies are argued at the end of this review.","Sadighbayan, Deniz; Hasanzadeh, Mohammad; Ghafar-Zadeh, Ebrahim",Trends Analyt Chem,726,6

STUDY DESIGN: We designed a case-control and cross-sectional study using surveys. The Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Scale questionnaire (STAI-T) and Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) which were validated in Turkish were given to outpatient women with high-risk pregnancies as study group and normal pregnancies as control group. A total of 446 women were recruited. RESULTS: There was a statistically significant difference between those with and without high-risk pregnancy in terms of Trait-State Anxiety scores with COVID-19 pandemic (p < 0.05). We found an increased prevalence of anxiety during COVID-19 pandemic in high-risk pregnant women comparing to pregnancies with no risk factors (p < 0.05). There was a statistically significant difference between the education level in high-risk pregnant women in terms of anxiety scores (p < 0.05), Beck Anxiety score was highest in high school graduates (42.75). While the level of Trait Anxiety was the highest with pandemic in those with high-risk pregnancy with threatened preterm labor and preterm ruptures of membranes (58.0), those with thrombophilia were the lowest (50.88). The State Anxiety level and Beck Anxiety Score of those with maternal systemic disease were the highest (53.32 and 45.53), while those with thrombophilia were the lowest (46.96 and 40.08). The scores of Trait Anxiety (56.38), State Anxiety (52.14), Beck Anxiety (43.94) were statistically higher during the pandemic in those hospitalized at least once (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: High-risk pregnant women require routine anxiety and depression screening and psychosocial support during the COVID-19 pandemic. High-risk pregnancy patients have comorbid conditions most of the time, hence they not only at more risk for getting infected, but also have higher anxiety scores because of the stress caused by COVID-19 pandemic.","Sinaci, Selcan; Ozden Tokalioglu, Eda; Ocal, Doga; Atalay, Aysegul; Yilmaz, Gamze; Keskin, Huseyin Levent; Erdinc, Seval Ozgu; Sahin, Dilek; Moraloglu Tekin, Ozlem",Eur J Obstet Gynecol Reprod Biol,726,14

Knowing what could be in store, the Thai Ministry of Public Health called for the creation of an explicit protocol to determine how these resources are to be rationed in the situation of demand exceeding supply. This paper shares the experience of developing triage criteria and a mechanism for prioritizing intensive care unit resources in a middle-income country with the potential to be applied to other low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) faced with a similar (if not more of a) challenge when responding to the global pandemic. To the best of our knowledge, this locally developed guideline would be among the first of its kind from an LMIC setting. In summary, the experience from the Thai protocol development highlights three important lessons. First, stakeholder consultation and public engagement are crucial steps to ensure the protocol reflects the priorities of society and to maintain public trust in the health system. Second, all bodies and actions proposed in the protocol must not conflict with existing laws to ensure smooth implementation and adherence by professionals. Last, all components of the protocol must be compatible with the local context including medical culture, physician-patient relationship, and religious and societal norms.","Archer, Rachel A; Marshall, Aniqa I; Sirison, Kanchanok; Witthayapipopsakul, Woranan; Sriakkpokin, Pisit; Chotchoungchatchai, Somtanuek; Srisookwatana, Orapan; Teerawattananon, Yot; Tangcharoensathien, Viroj",Int J Technol Assess Health Care,726,1

OBJECTIVE: This retrospective observational study of emergency physician Twitter use details how the healthcare crisis has influenced emergency physician discourse online, and may have use as a harbinger of ensuing surge. METHODS: Followers of the three main emergency physician professional organizations were identified using Twitter's application programming interface. They and their followers were included in the study if identifying explicitly as United States-based emergency physicians. Statuses or 'tweets' were obtained between January 4th, 2020, when the new disease was first reported, and December 14th, 2020, when vaccination first began. Original tweets underwent sentiment analysis using the previously validated Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner (VADER) tool as well as topic modeling using Latent Dirichlet Allocation unsupervised machine learning. Sentiment and topic trends were then correlated with daily change in new COVID-19 cases and inpatient bed utilization. RESULTS: 3,463 emergency physicians produced 334,747 unique English tweets during the study period. 910 (26.3%) stated that they were in training, and 446 (51.7%) of those who provided a gender identified as a man. Overall tweet volume went from a pre-March mean of 481.9 ±72.7 daily tweets to 1,065.5 ±257.3 daily thereafter. Parameter and topic number tuning led to 20 tweet topics, with a topic coherence of 0.49. Except for a week in June and four days in November, discourse was dominated by the healthcare system (45,570, 13.6%). Discussion of pandemic response, epidemiology, and clinical care were jointly found to moderately correlate with COVID-19 hospital bed utilization (Pearson's r = 0.41), as was the occurrence of 'covid', 'coronavirus', or 'pandemic' in tweet text (0.47). Momentum in COVID-19 tweets, as demonstrated by a sustained crossing of 7 and 28-day moving averages, was found to have occurred 45.0 ±12.7 days before peak COVID-19 hospital bed utilization across the country and four most contributory states. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 Twitter discussion among emergency physicians correlates with and may precede rising hospital burden. This study therefore begins to depict the extent to which the ongoing pandemic has affected the field of emergency medicine discourse online, and suggests a potential avenue for understanding predictors of surge.","Margus, Colton; Brown, Natasha; Hertelendy, Attila; Safferman, Michelle R; Hart, Alexander; Ciottone, Gregory R",J. med. internet res,726,4

We propose that neuroimmune cross-talk via inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) could underpin these long-term COVID-19 symptoms. This hypothesis is supported by several lines of research, including population-based cohort and genetic Mendelian Randomisation studies suggesting that inflammation is associated with fatigue and sleeping difficulties, and that IL-6 could represent a possible causal driver for these symptoms. Immune activation following COVID-19 can disrupt T helper 17 (TH17) and regulatory T (Treg) cell responses, affect central learning and emotional processes, and lead to a vicious cycle of inflammation and mitochondrial dysfunction that amplifies the inflammatory process and results in immuno-metabolic constraints on neuronal energy metabolism, with fatigue being the ultimate result. Increased cytokine activity drives this process and could be targeted to interrupt it. Therefore, whether persistent IL-6 dysregulation contributes to COVID-19-related long-term fatigue, sleeping difficulties, depression, and anxiety, and whether targeting IL-6 pathways could be helpful for treatment and prevention of long COVID are important questions that require investigation. This line of research could inform new approaches for treatment and prevention of long-term neuropsychiatric symptoms of COVID-19. Effective treatment and prevention of this condition could also help to stem the anticipated rise in depression and other mental illnesses ensuing this pandemic.","Kappelmann, Nils; Dantzer, Robert; Khandaker, Golam M",Psychoneuroendocrinology,726,14

Based on a caseness measure, the prevalence of psychological distress increased from 18.5% to 27.7% between the 2019 Wave and April 2020 with some reversion to earlier levels in subsequent months. Also, there was a systematic increase in total inequality in the Likert GHQ-12 score. However, measures of relative socioeconomic inequality have not increased. A Shapley-Shorrocks decomposition analysis shows that during the peak of the first wave of the pandemic (April 2020) other socioeconomic factors declined in their share of socioeconomic inequality, while age and gender account for a larger share. The most notable increase is evident for younger women. The contribution of working in an industry related to the COVID-19 response played a small role at Wave 9 and the Interim 2019 Wave, but more than tripled its share in April 2020. As the first wave of COVID-19 progressed, the contribution of demographics declined from their peak level in April and chronic health conditions, housing conditions, and neighbourhood characteristics increased their contributions to socioeconomic inequality.","Davillas, Apostolos; Jones, Andrew M",Health econ,726,24

Human behavior, affected by knowledge and perceptions, may influence the course of disease. METHODOLOGY: A structured questionnaire was used to collect data from 422 participants. It consisted of 28 questions in four sections; seven questions about sociodemographic characteristics of participants, 12 questions to estimate level of knowledge about COVID-19, six questions to evaluate attitudes toward disease, and three questions to assess practices to prevent disease transmission. RESULTS: Their overall understanding of COVID-19 was satisfactory. 69% of the participants had satisfactory levels of knowledge, and the main sources of information were social media platforms (79.70%) and television (70.90%). There was a significant difference in knowledge as a function of gender (p = 0.50), occupation (p = 0.012), and smoking (p = 0.041). The participants held optimistic attitudes and adopted appropriate protective measures. Most participants agreed that COVID-19 can cause death (64.7%), poses greater risks to elderly (93.4%) and those with chronic diseases (96.7%), it is mandatory to quarantine infected individuals (98.1%), preventive health measures are important (97.6%), and health authorities will succeed in controlling the pandemic (67.5%). There was a statistically significant association between satisfactory levels of knowledge and the practice of wearing masks and the adoption of protective measures (avoiding crowded places, frequent hand washing).

Our review focuses on the viral entry mechanisms to give a better understanding of the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and the eye. We highlighted findings that give evidence for multiple potential receptors of SARS-CoV-2 on the ocular surface. Additionally, we focused on data concerning the detection of viral RNA and its spike protein in the various ocular tissues from patients. However, the expression level seemed to be relatively low compared to the respiratory tissues as a result of a unique environment surrounding the ocular surface and the innate immune response of SARS-CoV-2.

Several studies have shown neurological symptoms, ranging from dizziness and loss of consciousness to cerebrovascular and neurodegenerative diseases. In this context, Guillain-Barré syndrome, an immune-mediated inflammatory neuropathy, has been closely associated with critical cases of infection with ""severe acute respiratory syndrome of coronavirus 2"" (SARS-CoV-2), the etiological agent of COVID-19. Its pathophysiology is related to a generalized inflammation that affects the nervous system, but neurotropism was also revealed by the new coronavirus, which may increase the risk of neurological sequel, as well as the mortality of the disease. Thus, considering the comorbidities that SARS-CoV-2 infection can promote, the modulation of purinergic signaling can be applied as a potential therapy. In this perspective, given the role of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) in neural intercommunication, the P2X7 receptor (P2X7R) acts on microglia cells and its inhibition may be able to reduce the inflammatory condition of neurodegenerative diseases.

We use a basic epidemiological model, a SEIR-model, that is calibrated to roughly resemble the COVID-19 pandemic, and we assume that individuals that become infected or are isolated on average lose a share of their productivity. An early quarantine postpones but does not alter the course of the pandemic at a cost that increases in the duration and the extent of the quarantine. For quarantines at later stages of the pandemic there is a trade-off between lowering the peak level of infectious people on the one hand and minimizing fatalities and economic losses on the other hand. A longer quarantine dampens the peak level of infectious people and also reduces the total number of infected persons but increases economic losses. Both the peak level of infectious individuals and the total share of the population that will have been infected are U-shaped in relation to the share of the population in quarantine, while economic costs increase in this share. In particular, a quarantine covering a moderate share of the population leads to a lower peak, fewer deaths and lower economic costs, but it implies that the peak of the pandemic occurs earlier.","Forslid, Rikard; Herzing, Mathias",Eur. j. health econ,726,1

Here we describe a renal-transplant recipient who developed recurrent, symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection 7 months after primary infection. To elucidate the immunological mechanisms responsible for reinfection, we performed longitudinal profiling of cellular and humoral responses during both primary and recurrent SARS-CoV-2 infection. We found that the patient responded to the primary infection with transient, poor-quality adaptive immune responses that was further compromised by intervening treatment for acute rejection of the renal allograft prior to reinfection. Importantly, we identified the development of neutralizing antibodies and humoral memory responses prior to SARS-CoV-2 reinfection. However, these neutralizing antibodies failed to confer protection against reinfection, suggesting that additional factors are required for efficient prevention of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection. Further, we found no evidence supporting viral evasion of primary adaptive immune responses, suggesting that susceptibility to reinfection may be determined by host factors rather than pathogen adaptation.","Klein, J.; Brito, A.; Trubin, P.; Lu, P.; Wong, P.; Alpert, T.; Pena-Hernandez, M.; Haynes, W.; Kamath, K.; Liu, F.; Vogels, C.; Fauver, J.; Lucas, C.; Oh, J.

The number of infected people is rapidly increasing, while the diagnostic method of COVID-19 is only by nucleic acid testing. OBJECTIVE: To explain the epidemiological characteristics, clinical features, imaging manifestations and to judge diagnostic value of COVID-19 by analyzing the clinical data of COVID-19 suspected and confirmed patients in a non-outbreak, Shanghai, China. To clarify the early epidemiology and clinical characteristics about COVID-19. METHODS: Cross-sectional, single-center case reports of the 86 patients screened at Zhoupu Hospital in Pudong New District, Shanghai, China, from January 23 to February 16, 2020. Epidemiology, demography, clinical, laboratory and chest CTs were collected and analyzed. The screened patients were divided into COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 based on nucleic acid test results. RESULTS: Of the 86 screened patients, 11 were confirmed (12.8%) by nucleic acid testing (mean age 40.73 ± 11.32, 5 males). No significant differences were found in clinical symptoms including fever, cough, dyspnea, sore throat, and fatigue (P > 0.05). No statistical difference was observed in plasma C-reactive protein (CRP) between the two groups (COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 ) of patients (P = 0.402), while the white blood cell count and lymphocyte count of the confirmed patients were slightly lower than those of the suspected patients (P < 0.05). Some non-COVID-19 chest CTs also showed subpleural lesions, such as ground-glass opacities (GGO) combined with bronchiectasis; or halo nodules distributed under the pleura with focal GGO; consolidation of subpleural distribution or combined with air bronchi sign and vascular bundle sign, etc. CONCLUSION: The early clinical manifestations and imaging findings of COVID-19 are not characteristic in non-outbreak areas. Etiological testing should be performed as early as possible for clinically suspected patients.","Peng, Ling; Liu, Kang-Yong; Xue, Fei; Miao, Ya-Fang; Tu, Ping-An; Zhou, Chao",Arch Iran Med,726,16

The COVID-19 pandemic threatened access to care and the health and safety of staff, persons served, and families in these settings. This paper describes steps taken to contain this threat by seven leading posthospital ABI rehabilitation organizations. Outpatient and day treatment facilities were temporarily suspended. In other settings, procedures for isolation, transportation, cleaning, exposure control, infection control, and use of personal protective equipment (PPE) were reinforced with staff. Visitation and community activities were restricted. Staff and others required to enter facilities were screened with symptom checklists and temperature checks. Individuals showing symptoms of infection were quarantined and tested, as possible. New admissions were carefully screened for infection and often initially quarantined. Telehealth played a major role in reducing direct interpersonal contact while continuing to provide services both to outpatients and within facilities. Salary, benefits, training and managerial support were enhanced for staff. Despite early outbreaks, these procedures were generally effective with preliminary initial infections rates of only 1.1% for persons served and 2.1% for staff. Reductions in admissions, services, and unanticipated expenses (e.g., PPE, more frequent and thorough cleaning) had a major negative financial impact. Providers continue to be challenged to adapt rehabilitative approaches and to reopen services.","Malec, James F; Salisbury, David B; Anders, David; Dennis, Leanne; Groff, April R; Johnson, Margaret; Murphy, Mary Pat; Smith, Gregory T",Arch. phys. med. rehabil,726,20

Primary Outcome Measure was mortality in the emergency department or as an in-patient. RESULTS: 470 subjects including 224 males and 246 females met the inclusion criteria for the study. Subjects with the following characteristics had higher odds (OR) of death: Older age [OR 8.3 (95% CI 1.1-63.1, p = 0.04)] for subjects age 70 or more compared to subjects age 18-29); Hypertension [OR 3.6 (95% CI 1.6-7.8, p = 0.001)]; Diabetes [OR 3.1 (95% CI 1.7-5.6, p<0.001)]; COPD [OR 3.4 (95% CI 1.8-6.3, p<0.001)] and CKD stage 2 or greater [OR 2.5 (95% CI 1.3-4.9, p = 0.006)]. Combining all age groups, subjects with hypertension had significantly greater odds of the following adverse outcomes: requiring hospital admission (OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.4-3.4, p<0.001); needing respiratory support in 24 hours (OR 2.5, 95% CI: 1.7-3.7, p<0.001); ICU admission (OR 2.7, 95% CI 1.7-4.4, p<0.001); and death (OR 3.6, 95% CI 1.6-7.8, p = 0.001). Hypertension was not associated with needing vent in 24 hours (p = 0.07). CONCLUSION: Age and hypertension were associated with significant comorbidity and mortality in Covid-19 Positive patients. Furthermore, people who were older than 70, and had hypertension, diabetes, COPD, or CKD had higher odds of dying from the disease as compared to patients who hadn't. Subjects with hypertension also had significantly greater odds of other adverse outcomes.","Khan, Muhammad Shayan; Dogra, Ratika; Miriyala, Leela K V; Salman, F N U; Ishtiaq, Rizwan; Patti, Dilnoor K; Kumar, Aakash; Sandho, Gaurav; Jacob, Karim; Luthra, Kritika; Sharma, Ravina; Ravikumar, Rekha; Edara, Dharmakaruna; Pittampalli, Shanti; Sood, Divya; Khatri, Vinod; Mahajan, Vijay; Avasthi, Salil; Auoad, Arlette; Katragadda, Srinivas",PLoS One,726,1

STUDY DESIGN: The study comprised 52 children with MIS-C admitted to University of Health Sciences Adana City Training and Research Hospital pediatric wards from September 2020 to April 2021. Demographic characteristics and clinical data were retrospectively collected from patient files. RESULTS: Median age of patients was 9 (5-13) years. Fever (92.3%), abdominal pain (76.9%), rash (48.1%) and vomiting (48.1%) were the most common presenting symptoms. Fever duration was 8 (4.25-10) days in overall. Depressed left ventricular ejection fraction was found in 17.3% of patients. At admission, elevated levels of CRP, procalcitonine, ESR, D-dimer, ferritin were found in 98.1%, 96.2%, 75%, 84.6% and 69.2% of the patients, respectively. Lymphopenia, hyponatremia and hypoalbuminemia were found in 76.9%, 59.6%, 42.3% of the patients. Intravenous immunoglobulin was used in 96.2%, corticosteroids in 71.2% and anakinra in 3.8% of the patients. 28.8% of the patients were admitted to pediatric intensive care (PICU) and 17.3% received vasopressor support. Median duration of hospital length of stay was 12.5 days. Comorbidities were present in 19.2% of the patients. No mortality was recorded. CONCLUSIONS: While being rare and treatable, MIS-C is the ugly and mysterious face of the COVID-19 pandemic for children. The increasing number of MIS-C cases shows that this phenomenon is more common than thought. Comprehensive studies are required to understand the pathogenesis of the disease and determine the treatment regimens clearly. LAY SUMMARY: While being rare and treatable, Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) associated with COVID-19 is the ugly and mysterious face of the COVID-19 pandemic for children. MIS-C is now thought to be a post-infectious (SARS-CoV2) hyperinflammatory disease secondary to an abnormal immune response, rather than a complete obscurity. The increasing number of MIS-C cases and new case series reports from all over the world show that MIS-C is more common than thought. Despite our increasing experience, we may encounter a new finding every day in MIS-C patients. Therefore, we want to contribute to literature by presenting the MIS-C cases we treated in our clinic in detail. We have experienced that MIS-C patients can apply with similar but also different and unique characteristics. In case of delayed diagnosis or treatment, morbidity and mortality rates may increase. Therefore, the level of awareness and knowledge of all physicians, especially those dealing with pediatric patients, about MIS-C should be increased. Although the early effects of MIS-C are known, we don't have enough information about the long-term consequences yet. Comprehensive studies are required to understand the pathogenesis of the disease and determine the treatment regimens clearly.","Tolunay, Orkun; Çelik, Ümit; Arslan, Ilknur; Orgun, Ali; Demir, Hüsnü; Demir, Oguzhan; Dagdelen, Erdi Çagri",J. trop. pedriatr,726,16

We close this gap by presenting a series of tests including a large variety of contemporary uncertainty estimation techniques, in order to determine whether they are able to identify out-of-distribution (OOD) patients. In contrast to previous work, we design tests on realistic and clinically relevant OOD groups, and run experiments on real-world medical data.

It is critical to identify COVID-19 patients who are most likely to develop a severe disease. This study was designed to determine the clinical and epidemiological features of COVID-19 patients associated with the development of pneumonia and factors associated with disease progression. METHODS: Seventy consecutive patients with etiologically confirmed COVID-19 admitted to PLA General Hospital in Beijing, China from December 27, 2019 to March 12, 2020 were enrolled in this study and followed-up to March 16, 2020. Differences in clinical and laboratory findings between COVID-19 patients with pneumonia and those without were determined by the &#967;2 test or the Fisher exact test (categorical variables) and independent group t test or Mann-Whitney U test (continuous variables). The Cox proportional hazard model and Generalized Estimating Equations were applied to evaluate factors that predicted the progression of COVID-19. RESULTS: The mean incubation was 8.67 (95% confidence interval, 6.78-10.56) days. Mean duration from the first test severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2-positive to conversion was 11.38 (9.86-12.90) days. Compared to pneumonia-free patients, pneumonia patients were 16.5 years older and had higher frequencies of having hypertension, fever, and cough and higher circulating levels of neutrophil proportion, interleukin-6, low count (< 190/µl) of CD8+ T cells, and neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio. Thirteen patients deteriorated during hospitalization. Cox regression analysis indicated that older age and higher serum levels of interleukin-6, C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, and lactate at admission significantly predicted the progression of COVID-19. During hospitalization, circulating counts of T lymphocytes, CD4+ T cells, and CD8+ T cells were lower, whereas neutrophil proportion, neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio, and the circulating levels of interleukin-6, C-reactive protein, and procalcitonin were higher, in pneumonia patients than in pneumonia-free patients. CD8+ lymphocyte count in pneumonia patients did not recover when discharged. CONCLUSIONS: Older age and higher levels of C-reactive protein, procalcitionin, interleukin-6, and lactate might predict COVID-19 progression. T lymphocyte, especially CD8+ cell-mediated immunity is critical in recovery of COVID-19. This study may help in predicting disease progression and designing immunotherapy for COVID-19.","Yang, Peng-Hui; Ding, Yi-Bo; Xu, Zhe; Pu, Rui; Li, Ping; Yan, Jin; Liu, Ji-Luo; Meng, Fan-Ping; Huang, Lei; Shi, Lei; Jiang, Tian-Jun; Qin, En-Qiang; Zhao, Min; Zhang, Da-Wei; Zhao, Peng; Yu, Ling-Xiang; Wang, Zhao-Hai; Hong, Zhi-Xian; Xiao, Zhao-Hui; Xi, Qing; Zhao, De-Xi; Yu, Peng; Zhu, Cai-Zhong; Chen, Zhu; Zhang, Shao-Geng; Ji, Jun-Sheng; Wang, Fu-Sheng; Cao, Guang-Wen",Infect Dis Poverty,726,24

COVID-19 has a high mortality rate, and older patients and those with underlying diseases are at particularly high risk of being infected. Outbreaks in LTCFs, where many high-risk patients reside, result in the occupation of beds meant for severely ill patients and even death in many patients. Long-term care hospitals (LTCH) are major LTCFs in Korea. Therefore, it is very important to protect patients in LTCHs from COVID-19. The reality is that preparedness for COVID-19 in LTCHs is inadequate, and there are barriers to improvements in preparedness. Through institutional improvement and policy support, the government should help healthcare personnel and LTCHs improve installation and raise the level of knowledge of infection prevention and control. With these improvement, prevention, surveillance, and screening for COVID-19 should be done and a response system to the COVID-19 outbreak should be established.

This study presents an applied gamification concept to e-learning focusing on improving engagement of the various types of personalities of undergraduate students in ERP courses. The gamification design was developed by implementing the pros and cons of each game element to compromise the overall performance of students. Three evaluations were conducted:1) to test whether the student has competently gained ERP knowledge; 2) web monitor to record the activity of students; 3) to evaluate the qualitative information of the game experience by interviews.

Young adults have proven to be a critical factor for COVID-19 transmission and are an important target of the efforts to contain the pandemic. Scalable digital public health technologies could be deployed to reduce COVID-19 transmission, but their use depends on the willingness of young adults to participate in surveillance. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to determine the attitudes of young adults regarding COVID-19 digital surveillance, including which aspects they would accept and which they would not, as well as to determine factors that may be associated with their willingness to participate in digital surveillance. METHODS: We conducted an anonymous online survey of young adults aged 18-24 years throughout the United States in June 2020. The questionnaire contained predominantly closed-ended response options with one open-ended question. Descriptive statistics were applied to the data. RESULTS: Of 513 young adult respondents, 383 (74.7%) agreed that COVID-19 represents a public health crisis. However, only 231 (45.1%) agreed to actively share their COVID-19 status or symptoms for monitoring and only 171 (33.4%) reported a willingness to allow access to their cell phone for passive location tracking or contact tracing. CONCLUSIONS: Despite largely agreeing that COVID-19 represents a serious public health risk, the majority of young adults sampled were reluctant to participate in digital monitoring to manage the pandemic. This was true for both commonly used methods of public health surveillance (such as contact tracing) and novel methods designed to facilitate a return to normal (such as frequent symptom checking through digital apps). This is a potential obstacle to ongoing containment measures (many of which rely on widespread surveillance) and may reflect a need for greater education on the benefits of public health digital surveillance for young adults.","Maytin, Lauren; Maytin, Jason; Agarwal, Priya; Krenitsky, Anna; Krenitsky, JoAnn; Epstein, Robert S",JMIR Form Res,726,20

METHODS: Retrospective data (1/2008-12/2016) from 238 patients with pelvic fractures were analyzed. Mean patient age was 44 years (SD 20); 66% were male. There were 54 Tile A, 82 Tile B, and 102 Tile C type injuries. The 30-day mortality rate was 15% (36/238). Six observers, three radiologists, and three surgeons with different levels of experience (attending/resident/intern) classified each fracture into one of the 26 second-order subcategories of the Tile classification. Weighted kappa coefficients were used to assess the IORs for the three main categories and nine first-order subcategories. RESULTS: The overall IORs of the Tile system for the main categories and first-order subcategories were moderate (kappa = 0.44) and fair (kappa = 0.31), respectively. IOR was fair to moderate among radiologists, but only fair among surgeons. By level of training, IOR was moderate between attendings and between residents, whereas it was only fair between interns. IOR was moderate to substantial (kappa = 0.56-0.70) between the radiology attending and resident. Association of the Tile fracture type with 30-day mortality was present based on two out of six observer ratings. CONCLUSIONS: The overall IOR of the Tile classification system is only fair to moderate, increases with the level of rater experience and is better among radiologists than surgeons. In the light of these findings, results from studies using this classification system must be interpreted cautiously. KEY POINTS: â¢ The overall interobserver reliability of the Tile pelvic fracture classification is only fair to moderate. â¢ Interobserver reliability increases with observer experience and radiologists have higher kappa coefficients than surgeons. â¢ Interobserver reliability has an impact on the association of the Tile classification system with mortality in two out of six cases.","Zingg, Tobias; Uldry, Emilie; Omoumi, Patrick; Clerc, Daniel; Monier, Arnaud; Pache, Basile; Moshebah, Mohammed; Butti, Fabio; Becce, Fabio",Eur. radiol,726,16

The scarcity of appropriate medical treatment and no effective vaccine or medicine against SARS-CoV-2 has turned the situation worst. Therefore, in this study, we made a deep literature review to enlist plant-derived natural compounds and considered their binding mechanism with the main protease of SARS-CoV-2 through combinatorial bioinformatics approaches. Among all, a total of 14 compounds were filtered where Carinol, Albanin, Myricetin were had better binding profile than the rest of the compounds with having binding energy of -8.476, -8.036, -8.439 kcal/mol, respectively. Furthermore, MM-GBSA calculations were also considered in this selection process to support docking studies. Besides, 100 ns molecular dynamics simulation endorsed the rigid nature, less conformational variation and binding stiffness. As this study, represents a perfect model for SARS-CoV-2 main protease inhibition through bioinformatics study, these potential drug candidates may assist the researchers to find a superior and effective solution against COVID-19 after future experiments.

Consequently, they likely spread the virus to other people as they continue their everyday life. This emphasizes the importance for targeting high-risk groups for the diagnosis of COVID-19 (with real-time PCR techniques). However, the availability of the necessary technology and resources may be limited in certain towns, cities or countries. Thus, the challenge is to determine a criterion in order to prioritize the suspected cases most in need of testing. The aim of the present study was to develop a method for evaluating the risk of exposure to COVID-19 infection based on geolocation data. The risk is expressed as a score that will be instrumental in optimally applying the COVID-19 test to suspected cases representing the highest probability of exposure. It can be easily and quickly implemented with easily accessible open source tools. A simulation was herein conducted with data from four people, assigning infection to one of them. The results show the feasibility of assessing the risk of exposure with the new methodology.

Immunotherapy via programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1)/programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) blockade has shown benefits for gastric cancer. Epigenetic DNA methylation critically regulates cancer immune checkpoints. We investigated how the natural compound oleanolic acid (OA) affected PD-L1 expression in gastric cancer cells. Interleukin-1ß (IL-1ß) at 20 ng/mL was used to stimulate human gastric cancer MKN-45 cells. IL-1ß significantly increased PD-L1 expression, which was abolished by OA. Next, OA-treated MKN-45 cells were co-cultured with activated and PD-1-overexpressing Jurkat T cells. OA restored IL-2 levels in the co-culture system and increased T cell killing toward MKN-45 cells. Overexpression of PD-L1 eliminated OA-enhanced T cell killing capacity; however, PD-1 blocking antibody abrogated the cytotoxicity of T cells. Moreover, OA abolished IL-1ß-increased DNA demethylase activity in MKN-45 cells. DNA methyltransferase inhibitor 5-azacytidine rescued OA-reduced PD-L1 expression; whereas DNA demethylation inhibitor gemcitabine inhibited PD-L1 expression, and, in combination with OA, provided more potent inhibitory effects. Furthermore, OA selectively reduced the expression of DNA demethylase TET3 in IL-1ß-treated MKN-45 cells, and overexpression of TET3 restored OA-reduced PD-L1 expression. Finally, OA disrupted nuclear factor &#954;B (NF-&#954;B) signaling IL-1ß-treated MKN-45 cells, and overexpression of NF-&#954;B restored OA downregulation of TET3 and PD-L1. The cytotoxicity of T cells toward MKN-45 cells was also weakened by NF-&#954;B overexpression. Altogether, OA blocked the IL-1ß/NF-&#954;B/TET3 axis in gastric cancer cells, leading to DNA hypomethylation and downregulation of PD-L1. Our discoveries suggested OA as an epigenetic modulator for immunotherapy or an adjuvant therapy against gastric cancer.","Lu, Xirong; Li, Yuyi; Yang, Wei; Tao, Minghao; Dai, Yanmiao; Xu, Jinkang; Xu, Qianfei",J Biochem Mol Toxicol,726,20

To understand factors that may contribute to viral spread and address long-term health sequelae for survivors, it is important to review evidence regarding viral presence in semen, sexual transmission potential, and possible effects on fertility. AIM: To review the current literature regarding the sexual transmissibility of recent viral pandemics and their effects on semen parameters and fertility. We review evidence for the following viruses: Ebola, Zika, West Nile, pandemic influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and SARS-corona virus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). METHODS: A literature search was conducted to identify relevant studies. Titles and abstracts were reviewed for relevance. References from identified articles were searched and included, if appropriate. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The main outcome measure of this study was reviewing of peer-reviewed literature. RESULTS: Both the Ebola virus and Zika virus are present in semen, but only the Zika virus shows consistent evidence of sexual transmission. Current evidence does not support the presence of the West Nile virus, pandemic influenza, SARS, and SARS-CoV-2 in semen. The Zika virus appears to alter semen parameters in a way that diminishes fertility, but the effect is likely time limited. The West Nile virus and SARS have been associated with orchitis in a small number of case reports. Viruses that cause febrile illness, such as pandemic influenza, SARS, and SARS-CoV-2, are associated with decreased sperm count and motility and abnormal morphology. SARS and SARS-CoV-2 may interact with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptors present in the testes, which could impact spermatogenesis. CONCLUSIONS: We have reported the presence in semen, sexual transmission potential, and fertility side effects of recent viral pandemics. Overall, semen studies and fertility effects are highly understudied in viral pandemics, and rigorous study on these topics should be undertaken as novel pandemics emerge.

However, there is little information on the prevalence of loneliness among people with disability or the association between disability, loneliness and wellbeing. OBJECTIVE/HYPOTHESIS: For a nationally representative sample of adults (age 16-64) with/without disability, to examine exposure to three indicators of low social connectedness (loneliness, low perceived social support, social isolation), and to evaluate the association between low social connectedness and wellbeing. To test whether disability status moderated the relationship between low social connectedness and wellbeing. METHODS: Secondary analysis of data from three annual rounds of the cross-sectional English Community Life Survey (CLS) 2016-19. RESULTS: People with disability experienced loneliness, low perceived social support and social isolation at significantly higher rates than people without disability. Effect sizes were significantly greater for loneliness. Disability was associated with lower wellbeing. With one exception, low social connectedness was associated with lower wellbeing. Again, effect sizes were significantly greater for loneliness. The prevalence of loneliness was highest among adults with disability who were younger, economically inactive, living in rented or other accommodation, living alone and with low levels of access to environmental assets. There was no evidence that disability status moderated the association between exposure to low social connectedness and low wellbeing. CONCLUSIONS: Loneliness was a particularly significant driver of poor wellbeing among people with disability. The relative independence between different indicators of social connectedness suggests that interventions to reduce loneliness will need to do more than simply increase rates of social contact or social support.","Emerson, Eric; Fortune, Nicola; Llewellyn, Gwynnyth; Stancliffe, Roger",Disabil Health J,726,3

Different organizations have recommended performing polymerase chain reaction tests (PCR) as part of the preoperative screening of surgical patients. We aimed to determine the performance of PCR testing to detect asymptomatic carriers. METHODS: Observational study carried out at a tertiary care center. We compared the results of preoperative real-time reverse-transcription-PCR test (RT-PCR) performed on a cohort of patients pending surgery with the results we would have expected assuming the epidemiological data released by government offices. RESULTS: We registered no positives in the 2,722 preoperative RT-PCR tests performed in our health care area between epidemiological Weeks 18 to 21, meaning a cumulative incidence trending to zero. Assuming public epidemiological data, the probabilistic projection of potential asymptomatic individuals ranged from 0.27*10e -4 (according to official data of new cases diagnosed by PCR) to 4.69*10e -4 if we assumed cases confirmed by IgG test in our province. Assuming a RT-PCR sensitivity of 95%, to obtain a positive result we should perform 38,461 and 2,028 tests respectively. CONCLUSIONS: In scenarios of very low prevalence and despite high sensitivity scores, indiscriminate preoperative RT-PCR screening is of a questionable effectiveness for detecting asymptomatic carriers.

Although respiratory symptoms are a key feature of the disease, many people who are hospitalized with COVID-19 also suffer acute kidney injury, a condition that exacerbates patient mortality and may have to be treated through renal replacement therapy. Much of the focus on hospital capacity during the pandemic has centered on the availability of ventilators. However, supplies for dialysis treatment, including dialysate, have also run dangerously low in hospitals at the epicenter of the pandemic. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop materials that can efficiently and rapidly regenerate dialysate, removing toxins and restoring electrolyte concentrations so that this vital resource remains readily available. In this work, Ti3C2Tx, a two-dimensional transition-metal carbide (MXene) that is known to efficiently adsorb urea, was used to remove creatinine and uric acid from an aqueous solution and dialysate, with a maximum adsorption capacity of 45.7 and 17.0 mg/g, respectively. We systematically analyzed and modeled the adsorption kinetics, isotherms, and thermodynamics, thus determining the rate-limiting step and adsorption mechanism. A fixed-bed column loaded with Ti3C2Tx was designed to further evaluate the adsorption performance under continuous fluid-flow conditions, mirroring conditions of continuous renal replacement therapy modalities. The maximum capacity and 50% breakthrough volume were calculated to further approach the practical application of Ti3C2Tx for removal of uremic toxins. Our findings suggest that Ti3C2Tx has the potential to be used as an efficient sorbent for the regeneration of dialysate, allowing for accelerated dialysate regeneration by removing filtered toxins and leading to more portable dialysis devices.","Zhao, Qi; Seredych, Mykola; Precetti, Eliot; Shuck, Christopher E; Harhay, Meera; Pang, Rui; Shan, Chong-Xin; Gogotsi, Yury",ACS Nano,726,1

Regional assessments by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), European Medicine Agency (EMA), and independent consultants, have demonstrated various contributory causal factors requiring changes in policy, relationships, and incentives within the dynamic and developing networks. Human Factors/Ergonomics (HFE) is an approach that encourages sociotechnical systems thinking to optimise the performance of systems that involve human activity. The global supply chain can be considered such a system. However, it has neither been systematically examined from this perspective. METHODS: In 2015, the UK Chartered Institute of Ergonomics and Human Factors established the Pharmaceutical Sector Group. This unique group is open to all who work in the pharmaceutical sector at any level and in any discipline who share the vision of a pharmaceutical system that places an understanding of HFE at the heart of improving the use of healthcare products throughout their life cycles including their supply chains. RESULTS: For this complex system to work efficiently it is paramount that we have effective coordination and integration between the different elements in the supply chain. HFE can give valuable insights and solutions for developing these complex social-technical systems effectively. CONCLUSION: By partnering with international groups such as Biophorum and Bio Supply Chain Management Alliance, the wish stimulate discussion about how sociotechnical thinking about HFE may help develop better monitoring and investigative techniques to strengthen global supply chains.","Edwards, Brian; Gloor, Charles A; Toussaint, Franck; Guan, Chaofeng; Furniss, Dominic",Int. j. qual. health care,726,29

In the race to a vaccine, several companies and funders are pursuing the most obvious approach, which is to develop antibody-focused vaccines based on the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein antigen. Emphasis on one approach, while setting aside others, is no small gamble. We believe the urgency of the situation calls for pursuit of multiple paths to a safe and effective vaccine. T cell immunity is essential to resolve SARS-CoV-2 infection and is a critical component of immunity against related coronaviruses. A T cell-directed vaccine may stimulate viral clearance mechanisms that reduce morbidity and obviate the risk of antibody-dependent enhanced disease. Moreover, T cell-directed vaccines can be designed to recall memory against similar viruses and/or to stimulate immunity against SARS-CoV-2 and other highly pathogenic coronaviruses. Mindful development of T cell-epitope driven vaccines may help to protect against the current coronavirus outbreak and pathogenic coronaviruses that are likely to emerge and threaten humanity again.","Moise, Leonard; Ross, Ted M; Hoft, Daniel F; Martin, William D; De Groot, Anne S",,726,24

Using the SPSS software, associations between the subjects' variables, and the dental insurance status were carried out with Chi square and independent t test respectively at 95% confidence interval. Results: Two hundred and ninety-one subjects were to have 353 RCTs within the study period. A high proportion (79.7%, p < 0.001) of the subjects had dental health insurance, majority (95.3%) of which was government funded. 20.9% of those with previous tooth loss was due to inability to afford cost of RCT.

Published guidelines from 23 countries and three references guidelines—until the end of 2020—were included in this article. The majority of COVID-19 treatment options were reported in this review and it includes antiviral drugs, antimalarial drugs, antibiotics, corticosteroids, immunotherapy, anticoagulants, and other pharmacological treatment. The presence of such information from different countries in a single comprehensive review article could help in understanding and speculation of variation in the recommended treatment in each country. This might be related to the cost of medications, the access to the medications, availability of medication that could potentially be useful in managing COVID-19 cases, and the availability/capacity of healthcare facilities.

Methods: This was an ambispective observational cohort study, and 133 confirmed COVID-19 patients were included and all symptoms over the course were analyzed qualitatively. The symptoms, their changes over the course in the cohort and in the different clinical types, etc. were illustrated. Differences in different periods and severities were analyzed through Chi square test, association with severity was analyzed through LASSO binomial logistic regression analysis. Inter-correlation and classification of symptoms were completed. Major symptoms were screened and their changes were illustrated. Results: A total of 43 symptoms with frequencies as 6067 in this cohort. Differences of symptoms in different stages and clinical types were significant. Expectoration, shortness of breath, dyspnea, diarrhea, poor appetite were positively but vomiting, waist discomfort, pharyngeal discomfort, acid reflux were negatively correlated with the combined-severe and critical type; dyspnea was correlated with the critical type. The 17 major symptoms were identified. The average daily frequency of symptoms per case was decreased continuously before the transition into the severe type and increased immediately one day before the transition and then decreased. It was decreased continuously before the transition date of the critical type and increased from the transition into the critical type to the next day and decreased thereafter. Dyspnea (P<0.001), shortness of breath (P<0.01) and chest distress (P<0.05) were correlated with death and their corresponding coefficient was 0.393, 0.258, 0.214, respectively. Conclusion: The symptoms of COVID-19 patients mainly related to upper respiratory tract infection, cardiopulmonary function, and digestive system. The mild type and the early stage in other types mainly related to upper respiratory tract infection. The cardiopulmonary function and digestive system associated symptoms were found in all other types and stages. Dyspnea was correlated with critical type, and dyspnea, shortness of breath and chest distress were correlated with death.

Balloon dacryoplasty (BD) is a minimally invasive procedure effectively used for congenital NLDO which has also been used in adults, instead of dacryocystorhinostomy (DCR), the current gold standard technique. The main objectives were to assess the results of BD with and without silicone tube insertion (STI) in NLDO in adults. Materiel and Method: A systematic review of literature was conducted on PubMed, SCOPUS and Cochrane databases. The articles were scanned to identify all studies that evaluated the outcomes of primary BD for NLDO in adults. The mean success rates were calculated and compared using the multiple comparisons Sidak's T-test Results: Sixty-seven articles were identified but only 13 publications matched the inclusion criteria. For partial NLDO, BD had a mean, success rate of 73.29% (64.86% with STI) with a mean follow-up of 16 months. For complete NLDO, BD had a success rate of 36.67% (52.50% with STI) with a mean follow-up of 15.5 months. Altogether the success rate of BD was significantly higher for partial NLDO compared to complete stenosis (p = 0,002). Conclusion: BD is significantly more successful for partial NLDO, without significant additional benefit from subsequent STI. The main complication would be the high recurrence rate. BD is not effective for complete NLDO with very low success rates. However, BD could be proposed for partial NLDO, as it is a safe procedure, with minimal invasiveness in comparison to DCR. Further prospective and controlled studies are required to confirm these encouraging results.","Poignet, Barthélémy; Sultanik, Philippe; Beaujeux, Pauline; Koch, Edouard; Benkhatar, Hakim",Orbit,726,30

METHODS: Neurosurgical procedures, inpatient consultations, and outpatient appointments at Vanderbilt University Medical Center were identified from March 23, 2020 through May 8, 2020 (during COVID-19) and March 25, 2019 through May 10, 2019 (before COVID-19). The neurosurgical volume was compared between the 2 periods. RESULTS: A 40% reduction in weekly procedural volume was demonstrated during COVID-19 (median before, 75; interquartile range [IQR], 72-80; median during, 45; IQR, 43-47; P < 0.001). A 42% reduction occurred in weekly adult procedures (median before, 62; IQR, 54-70; median during, 36; IQR, 34-39; P < 0.001), and a 31% reduction occurred in weekly pediatric procedures (median before, 13; IQR, 12-14; median during, 9; IQR, 8-10; P = 0.004). Among adult procedures, the most significant decreases were seen for spine (P < 0.001) and endovascular (P < 0.001) procedures and cranioplasty (P < 0.001). A significant change was not found in the adult open vascular (P = 0.291), functional (P = 0.263), cranial tumor (P = 0.143), or hydrocephalus (P = 0.173) procedural volume. Weekly inpatient consultations to neurosurgery decreased by 24% (median before, 99; IQR, 94-114; median during, 75; IQR, 68-84; P = 0.008) for adults. Weekly in-person adult and pediatric outpatient clinic visits witnessed a 91% decrease (median before, 329; IQR, 326-374; median during, 29; IQR, 26-39; P < 0.001).

SETTING, PARTICIPANTS: People of any age who had provided blood for testing at selected diagnostic pathology services (general pathology); pregnant women aged 20-39 years who had received routine antenatal screening; and Australian Red Cross Lifeblood plasmapheresis donors aged 20-69 years. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study; testing of de-identified residual blood specimens collected during 20 April - 2 June 2020. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Estimated proportions of people seropositive for anti-SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG, adjusted for test sensitivity and specificity. RESULTS: Thirty-eight of 5339 specimens were IgG-positive (general pathology, 19 of 3231; antenatal screening, 7 of 560; plasmapheresis donors, 12 of 1548); there were no clear patterns by age group, sex, or location of residence. Adjusted estimated seroprevalence among people who had had general pathology blood tests (all ages) was 0.15% (95% credible interval [CrI], 0.04-0.41%), and 0.29% (95% CrI, 0.04-0.75%) for plasmapheresis donors (20-69 years). Among 20-39-year-old people, the age group common to all three collection groups, adjusted estimated seroprevalence was 0.24% (95% CrI, 0.04-0.80%) for the general pathology group, 0.79% (95% CrI, 0.04-1.88%) for the antenatal screening group, and 0.69% (95% CrI, 0.04-1.59%) for plasmapheresis donors. CONCLUSIONS: Estimated SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence was below 1%, indicating that community transmission was low during the first COVID-19 epidemic wave in Sydney.

The standard 12-lead ECG is generally used, however, because of the current COVID-19 pandemic there is a strong need for a remote monitoring solution which will reduce exposure of health care providers to coronavirus. This article presents a disposable wireless patch biosensor (VitalPatch) and associated platform functionalities for real-time continuous measurement of clinically relevant ECG intervals including PR interval, QRS duration, QT interval, corrected QT interval by Bazett (QTb), and corrected QT interval by Fridericia (QTf). The performance of the VitalPatch is validated by comparing its automated algorithm interval measurements to the manually annotated global intervals of the 12-lead ECG device in 30 subjects. The accuracy of interval monitoring (in terms of mean timing error calculated by subtracting the VitalPatch measurements from the global intervals) is 2.7+/-15.94 ms, -1.97+/-12.29 ms, -14.6+/-12.97 ms, - 15.33+/-14.11 ms, and -15.08+/-13.69 ms for PR interval, QRS duration, QT interval, QTb, and QTf, respectively. These results demonstrate that the VitalPatch is a viable solution for measuring ECG intervals while taking advantage of its remote monitoring feature during the pandemic.","Nallathambi, Gabriel; Rajbhandary, Paurakh; Tran, Thang; Colliou, Olivier",,726,1

As a result, common and idiosyncratic elements explain the prevalence and dynamics of infections and mortality. Social determinants of health, particularly multidimensional poverty index and use of public transportation play an important role in explaining differences in outcomes. The article contributes to the understanding of the determinants of COVID-19 highlighting the need to consider time-space dynamics and social determinants as key in the analysis. Structural factors are important to identify at-risk populations and to select policy strategies to prevent and mitigate the effects of COVID-19.

The public opinions toward the COVID-19 crisis were explored in this study. METHODS: In this report, 1102 participants were included from 2 popular social media platforms from the Duhok Governorate in Iraqi Kurdistan between June 2 and 22, 2020, through an online technique. RESULTS: The study revealed that 14.0% of the participants believed that there is no COVID-19 in this region, and 20.1% had no concerns about the disease spread. This study revealed that 27.4% had conspiracy thinking about the COVID-19 outbreak, including that the outbreak is a plot against/of the Kurdistan Region Government, 16.4% and 19.3%, respectively. The outbreak caused considerable changes in participants' lives (85.8%). The participants who had conspiracy thinking were younger (27.0 vs 30.0; P = 0.001) and had a higher level of education (37.50% high school and under, 26.0% college and above, 16.2% illiterate: P < 0.001).

The effective solution for this pandemic is to recognize the nature and spread of the disease so that appropriate policies can be framed. Mathematical modelling is always at the forefront to understand and provide an adequate description of the transmission of any disease. In this research work, we have formulated a deterministic compartmental model (SEAMHCRD) including various stages of infection, such as Mild, Moderate, Severe and Critical to study the spreading of COVID-19 and estimated the model parameters by fitting the model with the reported data of ongoing pandemic in Oman. The steady-state, stability and final pandemic size of the model has been proved mathematically. The various transmission as well as transition parameters are estimated during the period from June 4th to July 30th, 2020. Based on the currently estimated parameters, the pandemic size is also predicted for another 100 days. Sensitivity analysis is performed to identify the key model parameters, and the parameter gamma due to contact with the symptomatic moderately infected is found to be more significant in spreading the disease. Accordingly, the corresponding basic reproduction number has also been computed using the Next Generation Matrix (NGM) method. As the value of the basic reproduction number (R0) is 0.9761 during the period from June 4th to July 30th, 2020, the disease-free equilibrium is stable. Isolation and tracing the contact of infected individuals are recommended to control the spread of disease.","Varghese, Abraham; Kolamban, Shajidmon; Sherimon, Vinu; Lacap, Eduardo M; Ahmed, Saad Salman; Sreedhar, Jagath Prasad; Al Harthi, Hasina; Al Shuaily, Huda Salim",Sci Rep,726,24

The risk of occupational exposure to coronavirus depends on the type of industry and the nature of work. Currently, most countries are working for reactivating their economies and need to improve working conditions for a safe situation during the COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVE: The present work aimed to investigate the current engineering and administrative control measures, which are necessary to protect workers against COVID-19 in workplaces. METHODS: The current strategies, including engineering control, administrative control, personal protective equipment, and their efficiencies, were reviewed and discussed. RESULTS: Reviewing the literature indicated that a collection of control approaches should be implemented for an effective control of the virus. Control measures could be selected based on the risk of exposure to COVID-19. The results also revealed that relying solely on a specific control measure could not effectively control the outbreak. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, employers and health professionals must continually monitor international and local guidelines to identify changes in recommendations to make their workplaces safer. Establishment of an expert team in any workplace for the implementation of more effective control measures is warranted, as well.","Dehghani, Fatemeh; Omidi, Fariborz; Yousefinejad, Saeed; Taheri, Elnaz",Work,726,0

The continuous growth of urban public road transport in large cities, and therefore the worsening of air quality, along with recent economic crisis derived from the COVID-19 pandemic, is forcing public administrations to analyze the viability of current models, taking into consideration sustainable alternative energies. This study proposes a novel and consistent analytic hierarchy process (AHP) multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) model that combines both economic and environmental criteria, to evaluate public road transportation vehicles according to their alternative engine technologies and combustion characteristics. The proposed model has been applied to evaluate Madrid’s urban public road transport, based on 2020 data published by the Madrid City Council, compiled by authors, and assessed by a panel of 20 experts to identify criteria and factors included in the AHP-MCDM model. The findings illustrate the economic and environmental impact of alternative vehicles, show that the most sustainable alternative is the plug-in electric vehicle in economic and environmental terms, and assist policymakers and firms in future strategic decisions regarding sustainable urban transport policies. © 2021 by the authors.

In this observational study, we empirically outline a negative association of UVB radiation as measured by ultraviolet index (UVI) with the number of COVID-19 deaths. We apply a fixed-effect log-linear regression model to a panel dataset of 152 countries over 108 days (n = 6524). We use the cumulative number of COVID-19 deaths and case-fatality rate (CFR) as the main dependent variables and isolate the UVI effect from potential confounding factors. After controlling for time-constant and time-varying factors, we find that a permanent unit increase in UVI is associated with a 1.2 percentage points decline in daily growth rates of cumulative COVID-19 deaths [p < 0.01] and a 1.0 percentage points decline in the CFR daily growth rate [p < 0.05]. These results represent a significant percentage reduction in terms of daily growth rates of cumulative COVID-19 deaths (- 12%) and CFR (- 38%). We find a significant negative association between UVI and COVID-19 deaths, indicating evidence of the protective role of UVB in mitigating COVID-19 deaths. If confirmed via clinical studies, then the possibility of mitigating COVID-19 deaths via sensible sunlight exposure or vitamin D intervention would be very attractive.","Moozhipurath, Rahul Kalippurayil; Kraft, Lennart; Skiera, Bernd",Sci Rep,726,5

In this study, the microbial diversity during the wet fermentation of Coffea arabica L. in the Sierra Nevada of Santa Marta (SNSM) in Colombia was explored by high-throughput sequencing and the resulting cup quality through the standards of the Specialty Coffee Association. The taxonomic assignment of sequence reads showed a high microbial diversity comprised of 695 bacterial and 156 fungal genera. The microbial community was dominated by the Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB) Leuconostoc, the yeast Kazachstania, and the Acetic Acid Bacteria (AAB) Acetobacter. Co-occurrence relationships suggested synergistic patterns between populations of LAB-AAB, yeasts-AAB, Leuconostoc-Prevotella, LAB-ABB-Selenomonas, and yeasts-fungi-nonLAB-nonAAB, which may result in the production of metabolites that positively impact the sensory attributes of coffee. The beverages produced were classified as specialty coffees, and their score was positively influenced by the fungal richness and the abundance of unclassified Lactobacillales, Pichia, and Pseudomonas. The findings show the richness and microbial diversity of the SNSM and serve as input for future research such as the analysis of microbial-derived metabolites and the establishment of starter cultures in coffee processing that guarantee the generation of high-quality beverages, the standardization of processes, the reduction of economic losses, and the production of value-added products that allow taking advantage of specialty coffee market.","Cruz-O039,; Byrne, Rosmery; Piraneque-Gambasica, Nelson; Aguirre-Forero, Sonia",Int J Food Microbiol,726,20

Among the various factors determining them, the crowd noise is considered as one of the most relevant; yet, the majority of previous studies could not isolate its contribution. The possibility to study the effects of crowd noise - or, better, of its absence - in an ecological context was given by the matches played behind closed doors due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether home advantage and referee bias still occur (and to what extent) during matches played in absence of spectators. In particular, the focus was on the first and second divisions of the top four countries in the UEFA ranking, for a total of 841 matches behind closed doors. The hypothesis was that, if these phenomena are largely due to the effect of crowd noise, the absence of spectators should reduce their occurrence. Various parameters for each of the two phenomena were considered, and the analyses revealed a reduction of home advantage and the absence of referee bias. The results bring further support to the claim that, among all the factors contributing to home advantage and referee bias, crowd noise has a relevant role.

AIMS: We aimed to investigate the incidence of cardiac arrhythmias among a large French cohort of implantable cardioverter defibrillator recipients over the first 5 months of 2020. METHODS: Five thousand nine hundred and fifty-four implantable cardioverter defibrillator recipients were followed by remote monitoring during the COVID-19 period (from 01 January to 31 May 2020). Data were obtained from automated remote follow-up of implantable cardioverter defibrillators utilizing the Implicity® platform. For all patients, the type of arrhythmia (atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation), the number of ventricular arrhythmia episodes and the type of implantable cardioverter defibrillator-delivered therapy were recorded. RESULTS: A total of 472 (7.9%) patients presented 4917 ventricular arrhythmia events. An increase in ventricular arrhythmia incidence was observed after the first COVID-19 case in France, and especially during weeks #10 and #11, at the time of major governmental measures, with an increase in the incidence of antitachycardia pacing delivered therapy. During the 11 weeks before the lockdown order, the curve of the percentage of live-stream television coverage of COVID-19 information matched the ventricular arrhythmia incidence. During the lockdown, the incidence of ventricular arrhythmia decreased significantly compared with baseline (0.05±0.7 vs. 0.09±1.2 episodes per patient per week, respectively; P<0.001). Importantly, no correlation was observed between ventricular arrhythmia incidence and the curve of COVID-19 incidence. No changes were observed regarding atrial fibrillation/atrial tachycardia episodes over time.

In addition to the direct effect (e.g., being infected with the virus), this pandemic has negatively ravaged many industries, particularly food retail, food services, and hospitality. Given the novelty of the disease, the true impact of COVID-19 remains to be determined. Because of the nature of their work, and the characteristics of the workers, individuals in the food retail, food service, and hospitality industries are a group whose vulnerability is at its most fragile state during this pandemic. Through this qualitative study, we explored workers' perspectives on the impact of COVID-19 on their mental health and coping, including screening for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and alcohol use disorder symptoms. Twenty-seven individual interviews were conducted, audio-recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using qualitative content analysis. Four key themes emerged: being infected and infecting others, the unknown, isolation, and work and customer demands. Considering the many uncertainties of COVID-19, workers in these three industries were experiencing heightened levels of mental distress because of where they worked and the already existing disparities they faced on a daily basis before the pandemic started. Yet they remained hopeful for a better future. More studies are needed to fully understand the magnitude, short-term, and long-term effects of COVID-19.

RESULTS: Air pollutant agents such as particulate matter <10µm (PM10), particulate matter <2.5µm (PM2.5), ammonia (NH3), sulphur dioxide (SO2), non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and greenhouse gas elements recorded showed a remarkable correlation with cumulative positive number of SARS-CoV-2 cases and with cumulative number of COVID-19 deaths. PM2.5 (r = 0.68, p-value = 0.0001 for cumulative positive cases; r = 0.73, p-value <0.0001 for cumulative deaths) and nitrogen oxides (r = 0.85, p-value <0.0001 for cumulative positive cases; r = 0.70, p-value 0.0001 for cumulative deaths) were among the pollutant agents with the strongest correlation for both positive cases and deaths. CONCLUSIONS: High levels of pollution in European countries should be considered a potential risk for severe COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2-related death.","Lembo, Rosalba; Landoni, Giovanni; Cianfanelli, Lorenzo; Frontera, Antonio",Acta Biomed,726,22

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine whether wearable activity trackers could provide information regarding users' adherence to home confinement policies because of their capacity for seamless and continuous monitoring of individuals' natural activity patterns regardless of their location. METHODS: We analyzed big data from individuals using activity trackers (Withings) that count the wearer's average daily number of steps in a number of representative nations that adopted different modalities of restriction of citizens' activities. RESULTS: Data on the number of steps per day from over 740,000 individuals around the world were analyzed. We demonstrate the physical activity patterns in several representative countries with total, partial, or no home confinement. The decrease in steps per day in regions with strict total home confinement ranged from 25% to 54%. Partial lockdown (characterized by social distancing measures such as school closures, bar and restaurant closures, and cancellation of public meetings but without strict home confinement) does not appear to have a significant impact on people's activity compared to the pre-pandemic period. The absolute level of physical activity under total home confinement in European countries is around twofold that in China. In some countries, such as France and Spain, physical activity started to gradually decrease even before official commitment to lockdown as a result of initial less stringent restriction orders or self-quarantine. However, physical activity began to increase again in the last 2 weeks, suggesting a decrease in compliance with confinement orders. CONCLUSIONS: Aggregate analysis of activity tracker data with the potential for daily updates can provide information regarding adherence to home confinement policies.","Pépin, Jean Louis; Bruno, Rosa Maria; Yang, Rui-Yi; Vercamer, Vincent; Jouhaud, Paul; Escourrou, Pierre; Boutouyrie, Pierre",J Med Internet Res,726,16

DESIGN: A cross-sectional study was conducted during the Spring 2020 semester using self-reported student data from an end of course survey. METHODS: A 16 item instructor-designed survey of student's perceptions of critical thinking, preparation, availability of materials, practice, video recording skill demonstrations, self-reported levels of anxiety related to the virtual testing environment and type of skill assessment exam was provided to all first semester baccalaureate nursing students enrolled in the basic nursing skills course. RESULTS: Approximately half of the cohort (N = 33) voluntarily responded to the instructor designed survey. The greatest relationship was observed between 'adequate information for each version' of the test and 'adequate time to prepare' (rho (32) = 0.729 p = 0.000). Although 54.6% (n = 18) of the respondents believed performing the demonstration in the home environment caused them to 'think harder' about the tasks, 78.8% (n = 26) reported feeling less anxiety than while performing previous demonstrations in the lab. A Wilcoxon test examined the results of the anxiety for demonstration on campus and anxiety for demonstration at home and a significant difference was found (p = 0.000, 95% CI) indicating anxiety levels were significantly less when demonstrating in the home environment. A moderate positive correlation was identified between opportunity to repeat with less stress at home (rho (32) = 0.61, p = 0.000), while moderate negative correlations were found between opportunity to repeat and anxiety levels related to recording (rho (32) = -0.60, p = 0.000), opportunity to repeat and anxiety related to demonstration at home (rho (32) = -0.53, p = 0.002) and concern about recording and opportunity to repeat (rho (32) = -0.49, p = 0.004). CONCLUSIONS: Student success using remote assessment strategies during the Spring 2020 semester was similar to the success rate using traditional skill assessment methods in Fall 2019. Although the need for prompt feedback was identified as an area of improvement to promote deliberate practice, student video recording of skill proficiency was a viable solution for comprehensive remote assessment during the COVID-19 pandemic and campus closure. Although further study is recommended, findings have international implications for virtual teaching and learning in nursing education.","Palmer, Troy J; Chisholm, LeAnn J; Rolf, Carmen G; Morris, Christina R",Nurse Educ Pract,726,14

During this period, surgical activity and admission to the Emergency Department (ED) decreased globally. The aim of this article is to understand how the admission of a patient to the ED for vascular surgery changed in our center in Portugal and if this situation prevented urgent surgical procedures. METHODS: Through a retrospective study, we compared the volume of patients admitted to the ED during the emergency state (ES) in Portugal with the same period in 2019. In addition, we analyzed the urgent surgical activity during the ES and in the correspondent period of the previous 10 years, regarding limb acute ischemia, acute aortic pathology, and vascular trauma. Two groups of patients were formed-patients operated during the ES and during the non-ES, for control. Statistical analysis was performed using IBM SPSS® Statistics, version 25. RESULTS: In the ES, 115 patients were observed at the ED and 179 in the 2019 corresponding period. During the ES, patients significantly recurred less to the ED directly from home (P < 0.001) and were less referred to the ED by primary care doctors (P < 0.001). Patients observed at the ED were significantly more urgent-required urgent surgery or were admitted to the department-than those in 2019 (40% vs. 24%). However, there were no differences when only considering urgent surgery (14% in ES vs. 10% in 2019). In the ES, 38% of patients observed at the ED were discharged with no follow-up related to vascular surgery against 60% in 2019, although this difference was not significant. Compared with the preceding 10 years, there are not significant differences in the number of patients who underwent urgent surgery in both ES and non-ES periods. In patients with acute limb ischemia, we did not find an increase in the time between onset of symptoms and ED admission, during the ES. CONCLUSIONS: Fewer patients were admitted at the ED during the ES, and those admitted were significantly more urgent. We did not find a decrease in the number of urgent surgeries when compared with the preceding 10 years. Therefore, we cannot assume that coronavirus pandemic precluded urgent surgical procedures.","Correia, Mafalda; Constâncio, Vânia; Silva, Joana Cruz; Lima, Pedro; Moreira, Mário; Antunes, Luís F; Fonseca, Manuel",Ann. vasc. surg,726,5

We report the largest case series to date of cerebrovascular complications of COVID-19 and compare with stroke patients without infection. METHODS: Retrospective case series of COVID-19 patients with imaging-confirmed stroke, treated at 11 hospitals in New York, between March 14 and April 26, 2020. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, imaging, and outcome data were collected, and cases were compared with date-matched controls without COVID-19 from 1 year prior. RESULTS: Eighty-six COVID-19-positive stroke cases were identified (mean age, 67.4 years; 44.2% women). Ischemic stroke (83.7%) and nonfocal neurological presentations (67.4%) predominated, commonly involving multivascular distributions (45.8%) with associated hemorrhage (20.8%).

This paper considers the hypothesis that viral binding to cell-surface integrins may contribute to the high infectivity and widespread extra-pulmonary impacts of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. This potential is suggested on the basis of the emergence of an RGD (arginine-glycine-aspartate) sequence in the receptor-binding domain of the spike protein. RGD is a motif commonly used by viruses to bind cell-surface integrins. Numerous signaling pathways are mediated by integrins and virion binding could lead to dysregulation of these pathways, with consequent tissue damage. Integrins on the surfaces of pneumocytes, endothelial cells and platelets may be vulnerable to CoV-2 virion binding. For instance, binding of intact virions to integrins on alveolar cells could enhance viral entry. Binding of virions to integrins on endothelial cells could activate angiogenic cell signaling pathways; dysregulate integrin-mediated signaling pathways controlling developmental processes; and precipitate endothelial activation to initiate blood clotting. Such a procoagulant state, perhaps together with enhancement of platelet aggregation through virions binding to integrins on platelets, could amplify the production of microthrombi that pose the threat of pulmonary thrombosis and embolism, strokes and other thrombotic consequences. The susceptibility of different tissues to virion-integrin interactions may be modulated by a host of factors, including the conformation of relevant integrins and the impact of the tissue microenvironment on spike protein conformation. Patient-specific differences in these factors may contribute to the high variability of clinical presentation. There is danger that the emergence of receptor-binding domain mutations that increase infectivity may also enhance access of the RGD motif for integrin binding, resulting in viral strains with ACE2 independent routes of cell entry and novel integrin-mediated biological and clinical impacts. The highly infectious variant, B.1.1.7 (or VUI 202012/01), includes a receptor-binding domain amino acid replacement, N501Y, that could potentially provide the RGD motif with enhanced access to cell-surface integrins, with consequent clinical impacts.","Makowski, Lee; Olson-Sidford, William; W-Weisel, John",Viruses,726,16

However, it is not known whether human recombinant soluble ACE2 (hrsACE2) blocks growth of SARS-CoV-2. Here, we show that clinical grade hrsACE2 reduced SARS-CoV-2 recovery from Vero cells by a factor of 1,000-5,000. An equivalent mouse rsACE2 had no effect. We also show that SARS-CoV-2 can directly infect engineered human blood vessel organoids and human kidney organoids, which can be inhibited by hrsACE2.

We establish a spatial model of the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic to project the trend and time distribution of the total confirmed cases and growth rate of daily confirmed cases based on the current intervention actions. Results: The results show that the number of daily confirmed cases, number of active cases, or growth rate of daily confirmed cases of COVID-19 are exhibiting a significant downward trend in Qatar, Egypt, Pakistan, and Saudi Arabia under the current interventions, although the total number of confirmed cases and deaths is still increasing. However, it is predicted that the number of total confirmed cases and active cases in Iran and Iraq may continue to increase. Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic in Qatar, Egypt, Pakistan, and Saudi Arabia will be largely contained if interventions are maintained or tightened. The future is not optimistic, and the intervention response must be further strengthened in Iran and Iraq.

Here, we identify risk factors and propose a clinical score to predict COVID-19 lethality, including specific factors for diabetes and obesity, and its role in improving risk prediction. METHODS: We obtained data of confirmed and negative COVID-19 cases and their demographic and health characteristics from the General Directorate of Epidemiology of the Mexican Ministry of Health. We investigated specific risk factors associated to COVID-19 positivity and mortality and explored the impact of diabetes and obesity on modifying COVID-19-related lethality. Finally, we built a clinical score to predict COVID-19 lethality. RESULTS: Among the 177â 133 subjects at the time of writing this report (May 18, 2020), we observed 51â 633 subjects with SARS-CoV-2 and 5,332 deaths. Risk factors for lethality in COVID-19 include early-onset diabetes, obesity, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, advanced age, hypertension, immunosuppression, and chronic kidney disease (CKD); we observed that obesity mediates 49.5% of the effect of diabetes on COVID-19 lethality.

We examined the mental health impact of reduced working in a nationally representative sample of employees. METHOD: We used Wave one (April 2020) of the Understanding Society UK Household Longitudinal Study (UKHLS) COVID-19 study, with linkage to baseline mental health data from the UKHLS annual survey (January 2017- December 2018). Analysis was based on adults aged 18-65 who were employees in January/February 2020 (n=8,708), with psychological distress assessed using the GHQ-12. Logistic regression examined the mental health impact of reduced working and reasons for the reduction. RESULTS: Forty two percent of employees reported reduced working by April 2020, with 22% furloughed. There was no evidence of an association between reduced working per se and psychological distress in the fully adjusted model (OR=1.06, 95%CI 0.91-1.23). Those permanently laid-off (less than 1% of employees) were most vulnerable to adverse mental health effects in the early months of the pandemic (OR=3.60, 95%CI 1.55-8.37). We also found evidence of higher levels of psychological distress among those sick or self-isolating, and those with reduced working due to caring responsibilities. LIMITATIONS: While the GHQ is a widely used and validated instrument in identifying potential psychiatric disorders, it is important to note that it does not represent a clinical assessment.

In vitro models, which accurately represent the lung microenvironment, are of increasing significance given the ethical concerns around animal work and the lack of translation to human disease, as well as the lengthy time to market and the attrition rates associated with clinical trials. This review gives an overview of the biological and immunological components involved in regulating the respiratory epithelium system in health, disease, and infection. The evolution from 2D to 3D cell biology and to more advanced technological integrated models for studying respiratory host-pathogen interactions are reviewed and provide a reference point for understanding the in vitro modeling requirements.

METHODS: Diagnostic sensitivities of the assays were assessed by testing serum samples from SARS-CoV-2 PCR-confirmed persons and diagnostic specificity was assessed by testing serum samples collected during 2018-2019 from healthy persons and from persons with antibodies to a wide range of viral infections. RESULTS: Serum samples collected &#8805;14 days after onset of symptoms, or an initial SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive test for asymptomatics, showed diagnostic sensitivities ranging from 67.9 to 75.0% when including all possible disease severities and increased to 90.0-95.0% when examining those with moderate to critical disease. Grouping moderate to critical disease showed a significant association with a SARS-CoV-2 antibody positive result for all assays. Diagnostic specificity ranged from 96.7 to 100.0%. For all assays examined, SARS-CoV-2 real-time PCR cycle threshold (Ct) values of the initial nasopharyngeal swab sample testing positive were significantly different for samples testing antibody positive versus negative. CONCLUSIONS: These data from a predominantly African descent Caribbean population show comparable diagnostic sensitivities and specificities for all testing platforms assessed and limited utility of these tests for persons with asymptomatic and mild infections.","Butterfield, Tiffany R; Bruce-Mowatt, Alrica; Phillips, Yakima Z R; Brown, Nicole; Francis, Keisha; Brown, Jabari; Walker, Jerome P; McKnight, Niel A L; Ehikhametalor, Kelvin; Taylor, Devon K; Bruce, Carl A; McGrowder, Donovan; Wharfe, Gilian; Sandiford, Simone L; Thompson, Tamara K; Anzinger, Joshua J",Int J Infect Dis,726,26

The individual cognitive stimulation therapy (iCST) app aims to provide cognitive stimulation and social interaction to people with dementia and carers through interactive touchscreen technology. The iCST app has been developed according to the principles of CST and iCST, which have previously shown to improve the cognition and quality of life of people with dementia and benefit the relationship between the person with dementia and his/her carer. The iCST app has also shown to improve the quality of the carer’s life. Objective: The aim of this study is to evaluate the usability of the iCST app intervention and the feasibility of conducting a full-scale randomized controlled trial (RCT) to assess the clinical effectiveness of the iCST app intervention compared to that of treatment-as-usual for people with mild-to-moderate dementia. Methods: We aim to recruit 60 people with mild-to-moderate dementia and their informal carers as dyads in a multi-center feasibility RCT with a treatment-as-usual control group. Both parties must be able to provide informed consent and participate in the intervention. Dyads will complete a baseline assessment that will include cognition and quality of life measures and they will subsequently be randomized (1:1) to the iCST app intervention in addition to usual care or to usual care only. All participants will be followed up at 5 weeks and at 11 weeks after the baseline assessments. A range of feasibility outcomes will be assessed, including recruitment and retention rates, intervention fidelity and usability, and acceptability of the outcome measures. A sample of the experimental group will be invited to a semistructured posttrial interview to further examine the experience of using the iCST app. Results: This study received funding in May 2015 and obtained ethical approval in March 2018. Data collection began in November 2018 and was completed in March 2020 with a total of 61 dyads recruited. Data analyses are in progress and the final results are expected to be available in the spring of 2021. Conclusions: This study will investigate whether it is feasible to conduct a full-scale RCT to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of the iCST app in comparison to that of usual care alone. In addition, this study will examine the usability of the iCST app. The data will provide information on potential modifications to be made to the intervention, study design, and study process.

In the field of interventional neuroradiology (INR), virtual clinics are an uncommon practice with minimal literature to support its use. Our objective was to report prospective, single-centre data regarding patient and physician experience with virtual INR clinics for routine follow-up appointments. METHODS: We surveyed all patients that participated in a virtual INR clinic follow-up appointment at our hospital over a 3 month period. Information gathered included length of appointment delays (ie, wait times), length of appointment times, overall satisfaction, and perceived safety metrics. A survey was also sent out to all physicians who participated in virtual clinics with similar questions. RESULTS: 118/122 patients and 6/6 physicians completed the survey. Wait times before previous in-person appointments were perceived to be much longer than virtual appointments, whereas in-person appointment times were longer. 112/118 (94.9%) patients and 4/6 (67%) physicians reported general satisfaction with their virtual clinic experience. There were 8/118 patients who felt their conditions could not be safely assessed virtually, compared with 1/6 (17%) physicians. Lastly, 72.2% of patients reported that they would prefer virtual or telephone visits in the future for non-urgent follow-up, and 5/6 (83%) of physicians reported the same. CONCLUSION: Virtual INR clinics are more efficient and are preferred among patients and physicians for non-urgent follow-up appointments.

At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, surgical societies quickly published guidelines recommending avoiding laparoscopy or to consider open surgery because of the fear of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through surgical smoke or aerosol. This narrative review of the literature aimed to determine whether there are any differences in the creation of surgical smoke/aerosol between laparoscopy and laparotomy and if laparoscopy may be safer than laparotomy. METHODS: A literature search was performed using the Pubmed, Embase and Google scholar search engines, as well as manual search of the major journals with specific COVID-19 sections for ahead-of-print publications. RESULTS: Of 1098 identified articles, we critically appraised 50. Surgical smoke created by electrosurgical and ultrasonic devices has the same composition both in laparoscopy and laparotomy. SARS-CoV-2 has never been found in surgical smoke and there is currently no data to support its virulence if ever it could be transmitted through surgical smoke/aerosol. CONCLUSION: If laparoscopy is performed in a closed cavity enabling containment of surgical smoke/aerosol, and proper evacuation of smoke with simple measures is respected, and as long as laparoscopy is not contraindicated, we believe that this surgical approach may be safer for the operating team while the patient has the benefits of minimally invasive surgery.

METHODS: In this retrospective study, we consecutively included all cancer patients who had been identified as having a nucleic acid-confirmed COVID-19 from two designated hospitals in Wuhan, China. COVID-19 patients without cancer were also enrolled for comparison. The clinical data were gathered from the medical records from Jan 14 to March 12, 2020. RESULTS: Among the 117 cancer patients diagnosed with COVID-19, the median age was 63 years and 48.7% were male. Male sex, hematologic cancer, dyspnea on admission, and anti-cancer therapies were associated with an increased risk of mortality in cancer patients with COVID-19. We found that elevated levels of TNF-&#945;, IL-2R, IL-6, and IL-8 were associated with a poorer prognosis in cancer patients with COVID-19, but no statistically significant association was found in patients without cancer. In addition, IL-2R and IL-6 markedly decreased in cancer patients who recovered from COVID-19. However, lymphocyte subsets were diminished in cancer patients who died from COVID-19, including total T cells, total B cells, helper T (Th) cells and suppressor T (Ts) cells. CONCLUSIONS: Cancer patients with COVID-19 were associated with high mortality (23.9%). A decrease in lymphocyte subsets and higher levels of cytokines were associated with a higher risk of severe outcome and could be utilized as the reference index to predict the survival outcome of cancer patients with COVID-19.","Zhang, Wei; Gao, Yuan; Hu, Guoqing; Chu, Qian; Yuan, Xun",Aging (Albany NY),726,2

LGE was most commonly seen in the subepicardial location (81%) and in the basal-mid part of the left ventricle in inferior segments. In most of the patients, ventricular functions were normal. Kawasaki-like involvement with myocardial edema without necrosis/LGE (4/6; 67%) was seen in children. CONCLUSION: CMR is useful in assessing the prevalence, mechanism, and extent of myocardial injury in COVID-19 patients. Myocarditis is the most common imaging diagnosis, with the common imaging findings being mapping abnormalities and myocardial edema on T2, followed by LGE. As cardiovascular involvement is associated with poor prognosis, its detection warrants prompt attention and appropriate treatment.","Ojha, Vineeta; Verma, Mansi; Pandey, Niraj N; Mani, Avinash; Malhi, Amarinder S; Kumar, Sanjeev; Jagia, Priya; Roy, Ambuj; Sharma, Sanjiv",J. thorac imaging,726,26

While battling for the disease in China, six Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) recipes have been shown to be remarkably effective for treating patients with COVID-19. The present review discusses principles of TCM in curing infectious disease, and clinical evidence and mechanisms of the 6 most effective TCM recipes used in treating COVID-19 in 92% of all of the confirmed cases in China. Applications of TCM and specific recipes in the treatment of other viral infections, such as those caused by SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, influenza A virus (including H1N1 and H7N9), influenza B, dengue virus as well as Ebola virus, are also discussed. Among the 6 TCM recipes, Jinhua Qinggan (JHQG) granules and Lianhua Qingwen (LHQW) capsules are recommended during medical observation; Lung Cleansing and Detoxifying Decoction (LCDD) is recommended for the treatment of both severe and non-severe patients; Xuanfeibaidu (XFBD) granules are recommended for treating moderate cases; while Huashibaidu (HSBD) and Xuebijing (XBJ) have been used in managing severe cases effectively. The common components and the active ingredients of the six TCM recipes have been summarized to reveal most promising drug candidates. The potential molecular mechanisms of the active ingredients in the six TCM recipes that target ACE2, 3CLpro and IL-6, revealed by molecular biological studies and/or network pharmacology prediction/molecular docking analysis/visualization analysis, are fully discussed. Therefore, further investigation of these TCM recipes may be of high translational value in enabling novel targeted therapies for COVID-19, potentially via purification and characterization of the active ingredients in the effective TCM recipes.","Huang, Kai; Zhang, Pan; Zhang, Zhenghao; Youn, Ji Youn; Wang, Chen; Zhang, Hongchun; Cai, Hua",Pharmacol Ther,726,12

E-visits are now reimbursable through Medicare due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The state of evidence regarding e-visits, such as the impact on clinical outcomes and health care delivery, is unclear. OBJECTIVE: To address this gap, we examine how e-visits have impacted clinical outcomes and health care quality, access, utilization, and costs. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review; MEDLINE, Embase, and Web of Science were searched from January 2000 through October 2020 for peer-reviewed studies that assessed e-visits' impacts on clinical and health care delivery outcomes. RESULTS: Out of 1859 papers, 19 met the inclusion criteria. E-visit usage was associated with improved or comparable clinical outcomes, especially for chronic disease management (eg, diabetes care, blood pressure management). The impact on quality of care varied across conditions. Quality of care was equivalent or better for chronic conditions, but variable quality was observed in infection management (eg, appropriate antibiotic prescribing). Similarly, the impact on health care utilization varied across conditions (eg, lower utilization for dermatology but mixed impact in primary care). Health care costs were lower for e-visits than those for in-person visits for a wide range of conditions (eg, dermatology and acute visits). No studies examined the impact of e-visits on health care access. It is difficult to draw firm conclusions about effectiveness or impact on care delivery from the studies that were included because many used observational designs. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the evidence suggests e-visits may provide clinical outcomes that are comparable to those provided by in-person care and reduce health care costs for certain health care conditions. At the same time, there is mixed evidence on health care quality, especially regarding infection management (eg, sinusitis, urinary tract infections, conjunctivitis). Further studies are needed to test implementation strategies that might improve delivery (eg, clinical decision support for antibiotic prescribing) and to assess which conditions can be managed via e-visits.","Nguyen, Oliver T; Alishahi Tabriz, Amir; Huo, Jinhai; Hanna, Karim; Shea, Christopher M; Turner, Kea",J Med Internet Res,726,27

First Detected in Wuhan, China: this acute respiratory syndrome has spread all over the world at the present moment and has been officially declared as a global pandemic. A massive detrimental effect on global health and economy has been noticed. While researchers are continuously in search of vaccines - detection and proper diagnosis of the virus is as important to limit the spread of the virus. Chest X-Rays (CXRs) is one of the most common types of radiology examination and CXRs of the infected patients can serve as a crucial step in detection of the virus. Having a computer aided automatic diagnosis can minimize human interactions, errors, and workload and maximize efficiency. Various studies have shown that use of artificial intelligence in detection of Covid-19 patients through their CXRs is strongly optimistic. In this paper, a robust and efficient computer aided detection system has been proposed for multiclass image classification of diseases like Covid-19 and Pneumonia using the CXRs of patients. The algorithms have currently achieved desired results which can be further improved when more CXR images are available. The proposed method has outperformed current state of the art algorithms and has achieved 98.3% accuracy with a precision metric of 0.94, and can be used as a fast and reliable preliminary test for detection of the virus. © 2021 Bharati Vidyapeeth, New Delhi.

In the current study, antibodies were investigated in patients recently diagnosed with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. METHODS: Cross-sectional data were obtained from 245 patients in whom SARS-CoV-2 infection had been confirmed via real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction between March and October 2020. Serum samples were acquired between 2 and 60 days following the onset of COVID-19 symptoms or the first detection of SARS-CoV-2 in asymptomatic patients. All specimens were tested simultaneously using an IgM/IgG rapid diagnostic test (RDT), IgG nucleocapsid protein-based chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (CMIA), IgG, and IgA spike protein-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). Blood donor samples obtained in 2018 were used as negative controls. RESULTS: The sensitivity and specificity of the RDT IgG were compared with the IgG immunoassays as standards. The RDT IgG exhibited 97.5% sensitivity and 89.4% specificity compared with a CMIA IgG, 98.4% sensitivity, and 78.8% specificity compared with an ELISA IgG. IgM, IgG, and IgA seropositivity rates were low between 1 and 2 weeks after COVID-19 symptom onset or the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. IgM seropositivity rate began decreasing after 4 weeks, whereas IgG and IgA seropositivity rate remained at appreciable levels over the 8-week study period. No cross-reactivity with seasonal coronaviruses was detected. CONCLUSIONS: IgG RDT alone or combined with molecular diagnostic tests may be useful for identifying recent SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Chansaenroj, Jira; Yorsaeng, Ritthideach; Posuwan, Nawarat; Puenpa, Jiratchaya; Sudhinaraset, Natthinee; Chirathaworn, Chintana; Poovorawan, Yong",Virol J,726,16

Pandemics at the scale of COVID-19 can cause a global shortage of proprietary commercial reagents and BSL-2 laboratories to safely perform testing. Therefore, alternative solutions are urgently needed to address these challenges. An open-source method, magnetic-nanoparticle-aided viral RNA isolation from contagious samples (MAVRICS), built upon readily available reagents, and easily assembled in any basically equipped laboratory, is thus developed. The performance of MAVRICS is evaluated using validated pathogen detection assays and real-world and contrived samples. Unlike conventional methods, MAVRICS works directly in samples inactivated in phenol-chloroform (e.g., TRIzol), thus allowing infectious samples to be handled safely without biocontainment facilities. MAVRICS allows wastewater biomass immobilized on membranes to be directly inactivated and lysed in TRIzol followed by RNA extraction by magnetic nanoparticles, thereby greatly reducing biohazard risk and simplifying processing procedures. Using 39 COVID-19 patient samples and two wastewater samples, it is shown that MAVRICS rivals commercial kits in detection of SARS-CoV-2, influenza viruses, and respiratory syncytial virus. Therefore, MAVRICS is safe, fast, and scalable. It is field-deployable with minimal equipment requirements and could become an enabling technology for widespread testing and wastewater monitoring of diverse pathogens.","Ramos-Mandujano, Gerardo; Salunke, Rahul; Mfarrej, Sara; Rachmadi, Andri Taruna; Hala, Sharif; Xu, Jinna; Alofi, Fadwa S; Khogeer, Asim; Hashem, Anwar M; Almontashiri, Naif A M; Alsomali, Afrah; Shinde, Digambar B; Hamdan, Samir; Hong, Pei-Ying; Pain, Arnab; Li, Mo",Glob Chall,726,20

This paper highlights the potential of azithromycin and ambroxol to treat COVID-19. Azithromycin and ambroxol share lysosomotropic characteristics, i.e. they penetrate and accumulate inside the late endosomes and lysosomes and may possibly interfere with multiplication of the virus inside cells. In addition, both of these drugs have anti-inflammatory effects. Ambroxol has a proven antiviral effect and a unique stimulatory action on the secretion of surfactant by alveolar type II cells, the main target of SARS-CoV-2. Surfactant may form a fundamental defence mechanism against the virus. Involvement of nasal epithelial cells in SARS-CoV-2 entry suggested advantageous use of inhaled drug delivery of these two drugs over the use of systemic administration. Inhaled drug delivery could aid in targeting the drug to the exact site of action with little or no side effects. To conclude, administration of these two drugs using a special drug delivery system provides two kinds of drug targeting: (i) tissue targeting through using an inhaled drug delivery system to achieve high drug concentrations at the respiratory epithelial tissue that overexpress the ACE2 receptor for virus binding; and (ii) cellular targeting of the virus in the acidic vesicles (late endosomes and lysosomes), which represent the fate of endocytic viruses.","Alkotaji, Myasar",Int J Antimicrob Agents,726,30

Methods This was a cross-sectional study where data was collected via a self-administered online questionnaire, from 264 pharmacists actively practicing in Kosovo during the pandemic. The questionnaire consisted of a combination of closed and open-ended questions, optional statements and statements on a five-point Likert scale, derived at least in part from the Transtheoretical Model. One-way analysis of variance was used to analyze differences in responses to Likert-type items whereas categorical variables were analyzed using Chi square testing. Main outcome measures Community pharmacists' perceptions on COVID-19 related preventative measures. Results A response rate of 40.6% was achieved. Sufficient and adequate COVID-19-related preventative measures were being implemented by a majority of pharmacies (n = 232; 87.9%), and over two-thirds of respondents agreed/strongly agreed that their pharmacies were sufficiently prepared with protective equipment for their personnel. Implementation of preventative measures was associated with respondents' perception that pharmacists and the pharmacy profession were valued more by patients during the pandemic and to a lesser degree, by other health professionals. Most commonly stated pros dealt with employee and patient safety, while key cons dealt with increased costs and running out of the necessary protective equipment. Key barriers to pharmacy activities were price increases by wholesalers, and patients' panic and excessive buying, whereas drivers dealt with professional obligation to assist and opportunity to prove inseparable to other health professionals. The most popular means of accessing COVID-19 related information by pharmacists was via mobile devices and information from professional organizations was considered most useful by pharmacists. Conclusions Community pharmacies actively implemented various measures as precautions to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. Our findings highlight the value of continuous provision of information by professional organizations and use of mobile devices as key means to access information by pharmacists.","Hoti, Kreshnik; Jakupi, Arianit; Hetemi, Dardan; Raka, Denis; Hughes, Jeffery; Desselle, Shane",Int J Clin Pharm,726,24

METHODS: This retrospective, observational, single-center-study recruited patients with a suspect of COVID-19 data were extracted from electronic medical records using a standardized data collection form. RESULTS: A total of 566 patients with suspect COVID-19 infection were enrolled (280 were COVID-19+). The COVID-19 population was characterized with bilateral-pneumonia, a lower count of neutrophil, lymphocyte and monocyte, a lower neutrophil to lymphocyte-ratio (NLR). Lower of platelet count, d-dimer, troponin I, and serum calcium were in COVID-19 patients. The occurrence of COVID-19 diagnosis increased, independently of other variables, with pneumonia (odds ratio [OR]: 3.60; p < .001), neutrophil below normal range (OR: 4.15; p < .05), lactate dehydrogenase (OR: 2.09; p < .01) and sodium above normal range (OR: 2.34; p < .01). In patients with possible respiratory acute affections we found a higher neutrophil, higher monocyte, a higher NLR and a more elevation in d-dimer. In the Sepsis group showed higher level of white blood cell, C-reactive protein, d-dimer, and procalcitonin. CONCLUSIONS: Our study confirms that patients with COVID-19 have typical radiological and laboratory characteristics. The parameters highlighted in the study can help identify COVID-19 patients, also highlighting which are the main differential diagnoses to be made and the parameters that facilitate the differential diagnosis.","Ucciferri, Claudio; Caiazzo, Luca; Di Nicola, Marta; Borrelli, Paola; Pontolillo, Michela; Auricchio, Antonio; Vecchiet, Jacopo; Falasca, Katia",Immun.

However, the factors contributing to its disparate racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic effects are part of an expansive and continuous history of oppressive social policy and marginalising geopolitics. This history is characterised by institutionally generated spatial inequalities forged through processes of residential segregation and neglectful urban planning. In the USA, aspects of COVID-19's manifestation closely mirror elements of the build-up and response to the Flint crisis, Michigan's racially and class-contoured water crisis that began in 2014, and to other prominent environmental injustice cases, such as the 1995 Chicago (IL, USA) heatwave that severely affected the city's south and west sides, predominantly inhabited by Black people. Each case shares common macrosocial and spatial characteristics and is instructive in showing how civic trust suffers in the aftermath of public health disasters, becoming especially degenerative among historically and spatially marginalised populations. Offering a commentary on the sociogeographical dynamics that gave rise to these crises and this institutional distrust, we discuss how COVID-19 has both inherited and augmented patterns of spatial inequality. We conclude by outlining particular steps that can be taken to prevent and reduce spatial inequalities generated by COVID-19, and by discussing the preliminary steps to restore trust between historically disenfranchised communities and the public officials and institutions tasked with responding to COVID-19.","Ezell, Jerel M; Griswold, Delilah; Chase, Elizabeth C; Carver, Evan",Lancet Planet Health,726,6

Patients complain about difficulty to remember knowledge that has been recently learnt together with its context (episodic memory, EM) but also more complex events that have been personally experienced (autobiographical memory, AM). While deficits at both encoding and retrieval have been shown to account for EM disorders in schizophrenia, the cognitive mechanisms involved in AM disorders are more difficult to approach. This is partly explained by the conceptual difference between EM and AM. Some methodological limitations inherent to the AM research also reduce the possibility to investigate the early processing of complex and dynamic real-life events at encoding; rather the retrieval processes engaged have therefore been the focus of the bulk of extant research. The aim of this review is to summarize the main findings related to EM and AM research in patients with schizophrenia, to discuss the putative mechanisms that may account for patients' AM impairment, based in particular on the literature about EM, and to provide an agenda for future research aiming to further elucidate the role of encoding deficits in AM in patients.","Kwok, Sze Chai; Xu, Xinming; Duan, Wei; Wang, Xinyi; Tang, Yingying; Allé, Mélissa C; Berna, Fabrice",Clin Psychol Rev,726,16

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies to determine the association. PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane database were searched from 1 January 1975 to 7 January 2020. Study selection, data extraction and bias assessment (using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale) were performed independently by 2 authors. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) with corresponding confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using a random-effects model. In all, 16 studies (11 cohort studies and 5 case-control studies) involving a total of 391,071 HCV patients and 38,333,839 non-HCV controls were included. The overall analysis showed a 47% higher risk to develop kidney cancer among the patients with HCV infection (pooled OR 1.47; 95% CI 1.14-1.91), despite significant heterogeneity (I2 = 87.6%). The multivariable meta-regression showed that study design, age, sample size and HIV co-infection were significant sources of variance, and totally accounted for 82% of the I2 . The risk of KC in HCV patients was further increased in studies without HCV/HBV- and HCV/HIV- co-infection (pooled OR 1.66; 95%CI 1.23-2.24). Multiple sensitivity analyses did not change the significant association. The present meta-analysis indicated that HCV-infected patients have a significantly higher risk of developing kidney cancer. Our results highlighted the rationale for improved renal surveillance in HCV patients for the early diagnosis of kidney cancer. Further investigations for the mechanisms underlying HCV-induced kidney cancer are warranted.","Wu, Di; Hu, Shiping; Chen, Guozi; Chen, Longjiao; Liu, Jian; Chen, Wenlin; Lv, Youwen; Chen, Xiaoni; Lin, Shan; Wu, Fenfang",J. viral hepat,726,32

DC EXO are eobiotic, meaning they are well-tolerated by the host; moreover, they can be custom-tailored for immune-regulatory or -stimulatory functions, thus presenting attractive opportunities for immune therapy. Previously we documented the efficacy of immunoregulatory DCs EXO (regDCs EXO) as immunotherapy for inflammatory bone disease, in an in-vivo model. We showed a key role for encapsulated TGFß1 in promoting a bone sparing immune response. However, the on- and off-target effects of these therapeutic regDC EXO and how target signaling in acceptor cells is activated is unclear. In the present report, therapeutic regDC EXO were analyzed by high throughput proteomics, with non-therapeutic EXO from immature DCs and mature DCs as controls, to identify shared and distinct proteins and potential off-target proteins, as corroborated by immunoblot. The predominant expression in regDC EXO of immunoregulatory proteins as well as proteins involved in trafficking from the circulation to peripheral tissues, cell surface binding, and transmigration, prompted us to investigate how these DC EXO are biodistributed to major organs after intravenous injection. Live animal imaging showed preferential accumulation of regDCs EXO in the lungs, followed by spleen and liver tissue. In addition, TGFß1 in regDCs EXO sustained downstream signaling in acceptor DCs. Blocking experiments suggested that sustaining TGFß1 signaling require initial interaction of regDCs EXO with TGFß1R followed by internalization of regDCs EXO with TGFß1-TGFß1R complex. Finally, these regDCs EXO that contain immunoregulatory cargo and showed biodistribution to lungs could downregulate the main severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) target receptor, ACE2 on recipient lung parenchymal cells via TGFß1 in-vitro. In conclusion, these results in mice may have important immunotherapeutic implications for lung inflammatory disorders.","Elashiry, Mahmoud; Elsayed, Ranya; Elashiry, Mohamed M; Rashid, Mohammad H; Ara, Roxan; Arbab, Ali S; Elawady, Ahmed R; Hamrick, Mark; Liu, Yutao; Zhi, Wenbo; Lucas, Rudolf; Vazquez, Jose; Cutler, Christopher W",Front Immunol,726,21

The current COVID-19 pandemic has affected substantially this high-risk population group. This present review was done to ascertain whether or not the pandemic has affected the 30-day mortality and outcomes of hip fracture in the elderly. Research Question: Does the coexistence of COVID-19 infection and hip fractures in the elderly increase the mortality rates? Methodology: A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted using three databases (PubMed, EMBASE and SCOPUS) to compare the mortality rates between COVID-19 positive/suspect and COVID-19 negative patients. The secondary outcomes included comparison of in-hospital mortality, complication rate and length of hospital stay. Risk of bias assessment was done using the MINORS tool. Results: The present review included 20 studies. Primary outcome: A significantly higher 30 day mortality rate was seen in COVID-19 positive/suspect patients with an Odds ratio of 6.09 (95% CI 4.75-8.59, p < 0.00001).

A successful host response to viral infections critically depend on the initial activation of PRRs by viruses, mainly by viral DNA and RNA. The signalling pathways activated by PRRs leads to the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, to recruit immune cells, and type I and type III interferons which leads to the induction of interferon stimulated genes (ISG), powerful virus restriction factors that establish the ""antiviral state"". Inflammasomes contribute to anti-viral responses through the maturation of interleukin (IL)-1 and IL-18 and through triggering pyroptotic cell death. The activity of the innate immune system along with the adaptive immune response normally leads to successful virus elimination, although disproportionate innate responses contribute to viral pathology. In this review we will discuss recent insights into the influence of PRR activation and inflammasomes on viral infections and what this means for the mammalian host.

In this study, sociodemographic characteristics, employment in the healthcare or service sector, having a relative with COVID-19, losing any relative due to COVID-19 and taking preventive measures were taken as independent variables. The dependent variable was the score from the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S). RESULTS: The FCV-19S median value was 14 for the service sector and 17 for the healthcare sector. While no difference was found between occupational groups and the FCV-19S score in the service sector, there was a significant correlation between occupational groups and the FCV-19S score in the healthcare sector. The FCV-19S median value of midwives was 21, and it was higher than those of other occupational groups were.

The goal was to detect clinically unsuspected Covid-19 infections to prevent community spread. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective analysis was conducted to recognize the pattern of metabolic and radiographic alterations on 18F-FDG PET/CT scans in Covid-19 patients. 492 18F-FDG PET/CT scans were reviewed for pulmonary and systemic abnormalities. RESULTS: 18F-FDG PET/CT demonstrated new lung infiltrates in 29 asymptomatic patients. 13/29 patients had Covid-19 infection confirmed by nasopharyngeal nucleic acid PCR test. The most common lung abnormality was pure ground-glass opacity (GGO) (90%) in peripheral distribution (100%), involving 1 lobe in four patients (30.8%), 2-3 lobes in four patients, and 4-5 lobes in five patients (38.4%). Mean SUVmax was 4.7 (range 1.3-13.1). Ten patients developed symptoms, mainly fever, fatigue, and dry cough, within 6.4 ± 7.8 days (range 1-24). Of the available laboratory data of 12 patients, eight developed lymphopenia, and five patients had neutrophilia. Five patients required hospitalization, and two died of complications. CONCLUSION: For a given geographic region in the later stage of a pandemic, such as Covid-19, community spread of the disease is common. Therefore, it is not surprising to find it in asymptomatic being imaged for other indications. Recognition of its manifestation and effectively mounting mitigation protocols is essential to further reduce SARS-CoV-2 spread, especially to susceptible groups, predominantly the elderly and people with comorbidities.","Bello Martinez, Ricardo; Ghesani, Munir; Ghesani, Nasrin; Gavane, Somali",J Med Imaging Radiat Sci,726,16

We conducted a study to determine independent risk factors for CAM. MethodsWe performed a retrospective case control study in a tertiary care private hospital in Pune, India. Fifty-two cases of CAM were compared with 166 concurrent controls randomly selected from the COVID-19 admissions during the same time period. Association of demographic factors, comorbidities, cumulative steroid dose used (calculated as dexamethasone equivalent), maximum respiratory support required, use of injectable/oral anticoagulation, and use of aspirin with CAM was assessed by univariate and multivariate logistic regression. ResultsA total of 218 subjects (52 cases; 166 controls) were studied. Any diabetes (pre-existing diabetes and new onset diabetes during COVID-19) was noted in a significantly higher proportion of cases (73{middle dot}1%, 45{middle dot}8% P<0.001) and cumulative dexamethasone dose used in cases was significantly greater (97{middle dot}72 mg vs 60 mg; P=0{middle dot}016). In a multivariate regression analysis cumulate dexamethasone dose >120 mg (OR 9{middle dot}03, confidence interval 1{middle dot}75-46{middle dot}59, P=0{middle dot}009) and any diabetes (OR 4{middle dot}78, confidence interval 1{middle dot}46-15{middle dot}65, P=0{middle dot}01) were found to be risk factors for CAM. While use of anticoagulation (OR 0{middle dot}01, confidence interval 0{middle dot}00-0{middle dot}09, P<0{middle dot}001) and use of aspirin (OR 0{middle dot}02, confidence interval 0{middle dot}01-0{middle dot}07, P<0{middle dot}001) were found to be protective against CAM. ConclusionDiabetes mellitus and cumulative dose of dexamethasone greater than 120 mg (or equivalent dose of other corticosteroid) were associated with an increased risk of CAM while use of aspirin and anticoagulation were associated with a lower risk.","Gupta, Dulari; Kulkarni, Rahul; Pujari, Shripad; Mulay, Atul",,726,16

METHODS: The registry HOPE-COVID-19 (Health Outcome Predictive Evaluation for COVID-19, NCT04334291) is an international ambispective study, enrolling COVID-19 patients discharged from hospital, dead or alive. RESULTS: HOPE enrolled 2798 patients from 35 centers in 7 countries. Median age was 67 years (IQR: 53.0-78.0), and most were male (59.5%). A relevant heart disease was present in 682 (24%) cases. These were older, more frequently male, with higher overall burden of cardiovascular risk factors (hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus, smoking habit, obesity) and other comorbidities such renal failure, lung, cerebrovascular disease and oncologic antecedents (p < 0.01, for all). The heart cohort received more corticoids (28.9% vs. 20.4%, p < 0.001), antibiotics, but less hydroxychloroquine, antivirals or tocilizumab. Considering the epidemiologic profile, a previous heart condition was independently related with short-term mortality in the COX multivariate analysis (1.62; 95% CI 1.29-2.03; p < 0.001). Moreover, heart patients needed more respiratory, circulatory support, and presented more in-hospital events, such heart failure, renal failure, respiratory insufficiency, sepsis, SIRS and clinically relevant bleedings (all, p < 0.001), and mortality (39.7% vs. 15.5%; p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: An underlying heart disease is an adverse prognostic factor for patients suffering COVID-19.

The present cross-sectional online survey of adult Poles (n = 1020) expressing a willingness to receive the COVID-19 vaccine was conducted between February and March 2021 and aimed to assess (i) the general trust in different types of vaccines, (ii) the level of acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccines already in use in Poland (BNT162b2 by BioNTech/Pfizer, mRNA-1273 by Moderna and AZD1222 by Oxford/AstraZeneca) as well as eight vaccines approved outside European Union (EU) or in advanced stages of clinical trials, (iii) level of fear of vaccination against COVID-19, and (iv) main sources of information on COVID-19 vaccination. Among all major vaccine technology, the highest level of trust was observed for the mRNA platform, with a considerable number of surveyed (&gt;20%) not aware of the existence of vaccines produced using the traditional approach (inactivated and live attenuated vaccines). The age of participants was the main factor differentiating the level of trust in a particular vaccine type. Both BNT162b and mRNA-1273 received a high level of acceptance, contrary to AZD1222. From eight vaccines unauthorized in the EU at the moment of study, the CVnCoV (mRNA;CureVac) was met with the highest level of trust, followed by Ad26.COV2.S (vector;Janssen/Johnson&Johnson) and NVX-CoV2373 (protein;Novavax). Sputnik V (vector;Gamaleya Research Institute) was decidedly the least trusted vaccine. The median level of fear (measured by the 10-point Likert-type scale) in the studied group was 4.0, mostly related to the risk of serious allergic reactions, other severe adverse events and unknown long-term effects of vaccination. Female, individuals with a lower level of education and those not seeking any information on the COVID-19 vaccines revealed a higher fear of vaccination. Experts' materials were the major source of information on COVID-19 vaccines in the studied group. The study shows the level of trust in COVID-19 vaccines can vary much across the producers while the mRNA vaccines are received with a high level of acceptance. It also emphasizes the need for effective and continuous science communication when fighting the pandemic as it may be an ideal time to increase the general awareness of vaccines.","Rzymski, P.; Zeyland, J.; Poniedzialek, B.; Malecka, I.; Wysocki, J.",Vaccines (Basel),726,1

RESEARCH AIMS: The primary aim of this study was to determine changes to breastfeeding support services during the coronavirus-2019 pandemic according to trained lactation providers. The secondary aim was to assess strengths and limitations of telehealth services. METHODS: A prospective survey was conducted entirely online using the Qualtrics platform during June 2020. Gatekeepers at Connecticut agencies and breastfeeding networks were forwarded an anonymous survey link to distribute to eligible lactation staff. RESULTS: A variety of participants (N = 39) completed the survey and the majority (69.2%; n = 27) were providing only telehealth services. More than half (58.1%; n = 18) of the participants who conducting telehealth in any form, found that virtual lactation support was moderately effective compared to in-person support. Weakness of virtual support included technical and logistical difficulties, challenges assisting with latching or reading body language over the phone or online, and accurately assessing infant growth. Strengths related to virtual support included the flexibility and convenience of home-based support, expanded communication strategies, and safety from virus exposure. Further, visits with a lactation professional decreased significantly during the pandemic. Limited in-hospital and pediatrician support were also noted, particularly among groups without access to telehealth resources. CONCLUSIONS: As a result of the pandemic and associated shifts in lactation services, breastfeeding disparities may be further exacerbated among those without equitable access to lactation support. Challenges and innovations in virtual support may influence adaptive options in the field moving forward.","Schindler-Ruwisch, Jennifer; Phillips, Kathryn E",J Hum Lact,726,24

We herein report a 26-year-old woman with chief complaints of lymphadenopathy and a fever. First, she underwent a laboratory examination, which showed a high proportion of atypical lymphocytes (19%) and an increase in hepatic enzyme activities, and was then hospitalized with a diagnosis of infectious mononucleosis (IM). However, the blood examination did not show any increase in anti-Epstein-Barr virus VCM-IgM. Subsequently, she developed tonsillar hypertrophy with purulent plugs. An additional examination for infection of other pathogens revealed positivity only for SARS-CoV-2 in a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) test. The patient was transferred to the COVID-19-specific isolation ward, and none of the ward staff, patients, or either of the two otolaryngologists who had directly examined this patient showed positive signs for SARS-CoV-2 in a LAMP test. Consequently, this case suggests that even if patients show clinical symptoms and signs of common diseases for otolaryngologists, such as IM, we should keep in mind the possibility of COVID-19 without arbitrarily assuming that IM is caused by Epstein-Barr virus.","Fukuda, Masatoshi; Amano, Yuta; Masumura, Chisako; Ogawa, Makoto; Inohara, Hidenori",Auris nasus larynx,726,16

In this article, we provide an overview of psychological distress in the current pandemic, identifying protective factors and risk factors. METHODS: The PubMed, PsycINFO, and Web of Science databases were systematically searched for relevant publications (1 January 2019 - 16 April 2020). This study was registered in OSF Registries (osf.io/34j8g). Data on mental stress and resilience in Germany were obtained from three surveys carried out on more than 1000 participants each in the framework of the COSMO study (24 March, 31 March, and 21 April 2020). RESULTS: 18 studies from China and India, with a total of 79 664 participants, revealed increased stress in the general population, with manifestations of depression and anxiety, post-traumatic stress, and sleep disturbances. Stress was more marked among persons working in the health care sector. Risk factors for stress included patient contact, female sex, impaired health status, worry about family members and significant others, and poor sleep quality. Protective factors included being informed about the increasing number of persons who have recovered from COVID, social support, and a lower perceived infectious risk. The COSMO study, though based on an insufficiently representative population sample because of a low questionnaire return rate (<20%), revealed increased rates of despondency, loneliness, and hopelessness in the German population as compared to norm data, with no change in estimated resilience. CONCLUSION: Stress factors associated with the current pandemic probably increase stress by causing anxiety and depression. Once the protective factors and risk factors have been identified, these can be used to develop psychosocial interventions. The informativeness of the results reported here is limited by the wide variety of instruments used to acquire data and by the insufficiently representative nature of the population samples.","Gilan, Donya; Röthke, Nikolaus; Blessin, Manpreet; Kunzler, Angela; Stoffers-Winterling, Jutta; Müssig, Markus; Yuen, Kenneth S L; Tüscher, Oliver; Thrul, Johannes; Kreuter, Frauke; Sprengholz, Philipp; Betsch, Cornelia; Stieglitz, Rolf Dieter; Lieb, Klaus",Dtsch Arztebl Int,726,17

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Time data of requests for patients with suspected or confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) lung disease were analyzed between February 27th and May 27th 2020. A multinomial logistic regression model was used to evaluate differences in the number of requests between 3 time intervals (I1: 6am - 2pm, I2: 2pm - 10pm, I3: 10pm - 6am). A cosinor model was applied to investigate the demand per hour. Requests per day were compared to the number of regional COVID-19 cases. RESULTS: 551 COVID-19 related chest imagings (32.8% outpatients, 67.2% in-patients) of 243 patients were conducted (33.3% female, 66.7% male, mean age 60 ± 17 years). Most exams for outpatients were required during I2 (I1 vs. I2: odds ratio (OR) = 0.73, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.62-0.86, p = 0.01; I2 vs. I3: OR = 1.24, 95% CI 1.04-1.48, p = 0.03) with an acrophase at 7:29 pm. Requests for in-patients decreased from I1 to I3 (I1 vs. I2: OR = 1.24, 95% CI 1.09-1.41, p = 0.01; I2 vs. I3: OR = 1.16, 95% CI 1.05-1.28, p = 0.01) with an acrophase at 12:51 pm. The number of requests per day for outpatients developed similarly to regional cases while demand for in-patients increased later and persisted longer. CONCLUSIONS: The demand for COVID-19 related chest imaging displayed distinct distribution patterns depending on the sector of patient care and point of time during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. These patterns should be considered in the allocation of resources in future pandemic challenges with similar disease characteristics.","Koehler, Daniel; Ozga, Ann-Kathrin; Molwitz, Isabel; May, Philipp; Görich, Hanna Maria; Keller, Sarah; Adam, Gerhard; Yamamura, Jin",PLoS One,726,1

However, data regarding the prognostic role of the LUS in nursing home residents, one of the populations most affected by COVID-19, are not still available. DESIGN: Retrospective. SETTINGS AND PARTICIPANTS: Nursing home residents affected by COVID-19 were followed up with an LUS from April 8 to May 14, 2020, in Chioggia, Venice. METHODS: COVID-19 was diagnosed through a nasopharyngeal swab. LUS results were scored using a 12-zone method. For each of the 12 zones (2 posterior, 2 anterior, 2 lateral, for both left and right lungs), the possible score ranged from 0 to 3 (1 = presence of B lines, separated, with <50% of space from the pleural line; 2 = presence of B lines, separated, with >50% of space from the pleural line; 3 = lung thickening with tissuelike aspect). The total score ranged from 0 to 36. Mortality was assessed using administrative data. Data regarding accuracy (and related parameters) were reported. RESULTS: Among 175 nursing home residents, 48 (mean age: 84.1 years; mainly female) were affected by COVID-19. Twelve died during the follow-up period. The mean LUS score was 3. The area under the curve of LUS in predicting mortality was 0.603 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.419-0.787], and it increased to 0.725 (95% CI: 0.41-0.99) after including follow-up LUS controls. Taking an LUS score &#8805;4 as exposure variable and mortality as outcome, the sensitivity was 58.33% and specificity 63.89%, with a positive likelihood ratio of 1.62 and a negative of 0.65. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: LUS is able to significantly predict mortality in nursing home residents affected by COVID-19, suggesting that this simple tool can be routinely used in this setting instead of more invasive techniques available only in hospital.","Veronese, Nicola; Sbrogiò, Luca Gino; Valle, Roberto; Marin, Laura; Boscolo Fiore, Elena; Tiozzo, Andrea",J.

451430,451430,451430,SARS-CoV-2 and viral sepsis: observations and hypotheses,11.193647,10.144555,2020,"OBJECTIVE: A new pandemic coronavirus causing coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), initially called 2019-nCoV and successively named Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The COVID-19 refers to the disease while the SARS-CoV-2 refers to the virus and is characterized by a rapid contagious capacity able to spread worldwide in a very short time. The rise in the number of infected patients and deaths is of great concern especially because symptoms are vague and similar to other forms of flu infection and corona syndrome infections characterized by fever, fatigue, dry cough, and dyspnea. According to the latest guidelines published by the World Health Organization (WHO), the diagnosis of COVID-19 must be confirmed by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) or gene sequencing of specimen obtained from throat, sputum and blood samples. However, the limitations due to logistics, as well as low sensitivity and specificity diagnostic tools currently available have been reported as the main cause of high incidence of either false-negative or positive results. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The purpose of the present translational research protocol is to discuss and present the original findings from our research team on new diagnostic technique to detect four Coronaviridae family members (SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, HCoV and MERS-CoV), highlighting the methodology, the procedure and the possible advantages. Moreover, the authors review the current epidemiology, precautions and safety measures for health personnel to manage patients with known or suspected COVID-19 infection. RESULTS: Implementation of an effective and rapid plan of diagnosing, screening and checking is a key factor to reduce and prevent further transmission. This procedure based on rRT-PCR could be of great help to decisively validate the results obtained from more conventional diagnostic procedures such as chest computed tomography (CT) imaging and chest ultrasound. CONCLUSIONS: This translational diagnostic tool will assist emergency and primary care clinicians, as well as out-of-hospital providers, in effectively managing people with suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2.","Pham, V H; Gargiulo Isacco, C; Nguyen, K C D; Le, S H; Tran, D K; Nguyen, Q V; Pham, H T; Aityan, S; Pham, S T; Cantore, S; Inchingolo, A M; Inchingolo, A D; Dipalma, G; Ballini, A; Inchingolo, F",Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,726,26

Measures of quality and barriers for rapid use by patients and physicians are not well described. OBJECTIVE: To describe results from a quality improvement initiative during a rapid adoptive phase of telemedicine during the pandemic. DESIGN: Patient and physician satisfaction with synchronous audiovisual telemedicine visits was measured during the early adoptive phase (6 April 2020-17 April 2020) within the division of sports medicine in an academic Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (PM&R) department. Patients were invited to participate in a quality improvement initiative by completing an online survey at the end of a telemedicine visit. Physicians completed a separate survey. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Patient measures included visit type, duration of encounter, quality, and satisfaction. Physicians reported on experiences performed telemedicine. RESULTS: Surveys were completed by 119 patients (293 telemedicine encounters, response rate 40.6%) and 14 physiatrists. Telemedicine was utilized primarily for follow-up visits (n = 74, 70.6%), and the most common duration was 15 to 29 minutes. Patients rated their telemedicine visit as ""excellent"" or ""very good"" across measures (91.6%-95.0%) including addressing concerns, communication, developing a treatment plan, convenience, and satisfaction. Value of completing a future telemedicine visit was measured at 84.9%. Most reported estimated travel time saved was in excess of 30 minutes. Rate of no-show was 2.7%. Most physicians (57.1%) had no prior experience with telemedicine visits, and most were comfortable performing these visits after completing 1 to 4 sessions (71%). Nearly all physicians (92.9%) rated their telemedicine experience as very good or excellent. The key barrier identified for telemedicine was technical issues. All physicians reported plans to perform telemedicine visits if reimbursement continues. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, rapid expansion of telemedicine during the COVID-19 pandemic was well-received by a majority of patients and physicians. This suggests feasibility in rapid expansion of telemedicine for other outpatient sports medicine practices.","Tenforde, Adam S; Iaccarino, Mary A; Borgstrom, Haylee; Hefner, Jaye E; Silver, Julie; Ahmed, Marwa; Babu, Ashwin N; Blauwet, Cheri A; Elson, Lauren; Eng, Christine; Kotler, Dana; Homer, Scott; Makovitch, Steven; McInnis, Kelly C; Vora, Ariana; Borg-Stein, Joanne",PM R,726,17

PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this non-interventional retrospective study, carried out at a tertiary hospital within the Spanish National Health System, all adult patients who were admitted in the Orthopaedic Surgery and Traumatology Department between March 9th and May 4th, 2020, were included. Clinical, biological and radiological data, as well as mortality rates, were collected from hospital medical records. RESULTS: A total of 293 periods of hospitalization were analysed in 288 patients. Mean age was 66.1 years old and 57.3% were females. Nineteen patients (6.48%) met the inclusion criteria to be categorized as a nosocomial infection with SARS-CoV-2. In a comparison between patients with and without nosocomial infection, age, mortality and hospital length of stay were statistically significant (p < 0.05). The median time from admission to diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection in our cohort was 16 days (6-86 days). No statistically significant differences were found in sex, living situation, reason of admission or period of admission (even if we observed that most of the nosocomial infections (78.9%) occurred in March). CONCLUSION: We have found a 6.48% of nosocomial infection with SARS-CoV-2, but with an important reduction of it after undergoing preventing protocols that included screening RT-PCR test for COVID-19. Age and hospital length stay were statistically significant risk factors for nosocomial infection with SARS-CoV-2. For the progressive restoration of the surgical activity, we recommend to correctly select the patients in elective surgery and to encourage fast-track programs and early discharge of patients with fractures.","Lakhani, Kushal; Minguell, Joan; Guerra-Farfán, Ernesto; Lara, Yuri; Jambrina, Unai; Pijoan, Joan; Núñez, Jorge H",Int Orthop,726,1

Post-mortem lung biopsies were analyzed by traditional and immunohistochemical methods. Tissue expression of innate and adaptive immune response biomarkers was tested. We observed a higher innate response in case 1 with an abundance of mast cells, scarce CD8+ lymphocytes, high expression of TNF-alpha, and almost absent adaptative immune response. In case 2, the adaptative immune response was present, with numerous CD8+ lymphocytes and higher levels of IL-4 and TGF-beta. Both cases converged to a prothrombotic state expressing high IL-6, followed by ICAM-1 expression and endotheliites leading to systemic inflammatory response syndrome.

NVX-CoV2373 is an adjuvanted, recombinant S protein nanoparticle vaccine that demonstrated clinical efficacy for prevention of Covid-19 in phase 2b/3 trials in the United Kingdom and South Africa. METHODSThis phase 3, randomized, observer-blinded, placebo-controlled trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of NVX-CoV2373 in adults [≥]18 years of age in the United States and Mexico during the first quarter of 2021. Participants were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive two doses of NVX-CoV2373 or placebo 21 days apart. The primary end point was vaccine efficacy (VE) against reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction-confirmed Covid-19 in SARS-CoV-2-naive participants [≥]7 days after the second dose administration. RESULTSOf the 29,949 participants randomized between December 27, 2020, and February 18, 2021, 29,582 (median age: 47 years, 12.6% [≥]65 years) received [≥]1 dose: 19,714 received vaccine and 9868 placebo. In the per-protocol population, there were 77 Covid-19 cases; 14 among vaccine and 63 among placebo recipients (VE: 90.4%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 82.9 to 94.6, P<0.001). All moderate-to-severe cases occurred in placebo recipients, yielding VE of 100% (95% CI 87.0 to 100). Most sequenced viral genomes (48/61, 78.7%) were variants of concern (VOC) or interest (VOI), mainly represented by variant alpha/B.1.1.7 (31/35, 88.6% VOC identified). VE against any VOC/VOI was 92.6% (95% CI 83.6 to 96.7). Reactogenicity was mostly mild-to-moderate and transient, but more frequent in NVX-CoV2373 recipients and after the second dose. Serious adverse events were rare and evenly distributed between treatments. CONCLUSIONSNVX-CoV2373 was well tolerated and demonstrated a high overall VE (>90%) for prevention of Covid-19, with most cases due to variant strains.

These changes are clearly seen in mobility data, which records foot traffic using location trackers in cell phones. While mobility data is often used to extract the number of customers that visit a particular business or business type, it is the frequency and duration of concurrent occupancy at those sites that governs transmission. Understanding the way people interact at different locations can help target policies and inform contact tracing and prevention strategies. This paper outlines methods to extract interactions from mobility data and build networks that can be used in epidemiological models. Several measures of interaction are extracted: interactions between people, the cumulative interactions for a single person, and cumulative interactions that occur at particular businesses. Network metrics are computed to identify structural trends which show clear changes based on the timing of stay-at-home orders. Measures of interaction and structural trends in the resulting networks can be used to better understand potential spreading events, the percent of interactions that can be classified as close contacts, and the impact of policy choices to control transmission.","Klise, Katherine; Beyeler, Walt; Finley, Patrick; Makvandi, Monear",PLoS One,726,16

However, specific investigation of industrial economies like Germany is not available. This provides us motivation to examine the association between environmental pollutants, climate indicators and the COVID-19 cases, recoveries, and deaths in Germany using daily data from February 24, 2020, to July 02, 2020. The correlation analysis and wavelet transform coherence (WTC) approach are the analytical tools, which are used to explore the association between variables included in the study. Our findings indicate that PM2.5, O3, and NO2 have a significant relationship with the outbreak of COVID-19. In addition, temperature is the only significant climate indicator which has significant correlation with the spread of COVID-19. Finally, PM10, humidity, and environmental quality index have a significant relationship only with the active cases from COVID-19 pandemic. Our findings conclude that Germany's successful response to COVID-19 is attributed to environmental legislation and the medical care system, which oversaw significant overhaul after the SARS and MERS outbreaks. The current study implicates that other industrial economies, especially European economies, that are still facing COVID-19 outbreak can follow the German model for pandemic response.","Bashir, Muhammad Farhan; Benghoul, Maroua; Numan, Umar; Shakoor, Awais; Komal, Bushra; Bashir, Muhammad Adnan; Bashir, Madiha; Tan, Duojiao",Air Qual Atmos Health,726,16

We hypothesized that: 1) MIS-C and pre-pandemic KD cytokine profiles may be unique and justify the clinical differences observed; 2) SARS-CoV-2-specific immune complexes (IC) may explain the immunopathology of MIS-C. Seventy-four children were included: 14 MIS-C; 9 patients with positive SARS-CoV-2-PCR without MIS-C (COVID); 14 pre-pandemic KD and 37 healthy controls (HC). Thirty-four circulating cytokines were quantified in pre-treatment serum or plasma samples and the presence of circulating SARS-CoV-2 IC was evaluated in MIS-C patients. Compared to HC, MIS-C and KD groups showed most cytokines to be significantly elevated, with IFN-Î³-induced response markers (including IFN-Î³, IL-18, IP-10) and inflammatory monocytes activation markers (including MCP-1, IL-1&#945;, IL-1RA) being the main triggers of inflammation. With linear discriminant analysis, MIS-C and KD profiles overlapped; however, a subgroup of MIS-C patients (MIS-Cplus) differentiated from the remaining MIS-C patients in IFN-Î³, IL-18, GM-CSF, RANTES, IP-10, IL-1&#945; and SDF-1 and incipient signs of macrophagic activation syndrome. Circulating SARS-CoV-2-IC were not detected in MIS-C patients.

Many studies have shown the benefits of physical exercise in individuals who have practiced it routinely. This approach is a great strategy to improve people's cardiorespiratory capacity, inflammation system, and immune response. Due to the quarantine period, the practice of physical exercise at home can also be used to fight off COVID-19 and must be inserted into people's routines.","Silva Filho, Edson; Xavier, Jairo; Cezarino, Leandro; Sales, Histênio; Albuquerque, Jéssica",Rev.

Established agents are Lichtheimia corymbifera and L. ramosa, while L. ornata is a novel agent. Available data on a species-specific analysis of Lichtheimia infections are limited. METHODS: The first case of a fatal rhino-orbital-cerebral infection in a hematopoietic stem cell transplantation recipient caused by L. ornata is reported; the agent was identified by sequencing the ITS ribosomal region. We reviewed the literature on mucormycosis due to Lichtheimia species between 2009 and 2018, with an analysis of risk factors and epidemiological and clinical data. RESULTS: In addition to our Lichtheimia ornata case, 44 cases of human Lichtheimia were analyzed. Lichtheimia predominated in Europe (68.2%), followed by Asia (16%), and Africa (9%). The most common underlying condition was hematological malignancy (36.3%), followed by trauma/major surgery (27.3%), while diabetes mellitus was rare (11.4%). Site of infection was mostly skin and soft tissues (45.5%) and lung (25%), while relatively few cases were disseminated (13.6%) or rhinocerebral (11.4%). Mortality (36.4%) was mainly due to disseminated and rhinocerebral infections. CONCLUSION: In contrast to Rhizopus, the most common agent of mucormycosis recorded in patients with diabetes mellitus, Lichtheimia infections were primarily associated with hematological malignancies and major skin barrier damage. Given the fact that classical rhinocerebral mucormycosis remains difficult to treat, independent of causative species, timely application of amphotericin B accessory to debridement may be required for patient survival.","Pan, Junling; Tsui, Clement; Li, Mengxing; Xiao, Kun; de Hoog, G Sybren; Verweij, Paul E; Cao, Yu; Lu, Hongguang; Jiang, Yanping",Mycopathologia,726,6

Euclidean distance comparison (p < 0.01) and a Welch t-test of the melting point temperatures (p < 0.01) provide highly significant statistical evidence for species specific differences in melting and fluorescence curves, thus allowing the assignment of larvae to either of the two species. This protocol serves as a fast, low-cost and low-tech method to discriminate between pairs or groups of closely related species and can be adapted and applied to various ecological research questions.","Zangl, Lukas; Oberreiter, Hannes; Huss, Herbert; Stabentheiner, Edith; Sturmbauer, Christian; Koblmüller, Stephan",Mol.

We also conducted a statistical analysis on the ACP services provided by the Taipei Veterans General Hospital. RESULTS: From 2019 to June 2020, 15 veterans hospitals in Taiwan provided ACP services to 2,493 individuals. The outpatient ACP services declined significantly after January 2020, decreasing from a national average of 206.2 ± 29.2 declarants per month to 106.2 ± 30.8 declarants per month in the 6 months immediately following the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak (p < 0.001).

Since vitamin D receptors are present in most tissues and cells in the body, the mounting understanding of the role of vitamin D in humans indicates that it does not only play an important role in the musculoskeletal system, but has beneficial effects elsewhere as well. This review summarizes the metabolism of vitamin D, the research regarding the possible risk factors leading to vitamin D deficiency, and the relationships between vitamin D deficiency and numerous illnesses, including rickets, osteoporosis and osteomalacia, muscle weakness and falls, autoimmune disorders, infectious diseases, cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), cancers, and neurological disorders. The system-wide effects of vitamin D and the mechanisms of the diseases are also discussed. Although accumulating evidence supports associations of vitamin D deficiency with physical and mental disorders and beneficial effects of vitamin D with health maintenance and disease prevention, there continue to be controversies over the beneficial effects of vitamin D. Thus, more well-designed and statistically powered trials are required to enable the assessment of vitamin D's role in optimizing health and preventing disease.","Zhang, Sicheng; Miller, Duane D; Li, Wei",Int. j. mol. sci.

Home-based exercise might be an adequate means to increase physical activity by improving health- (i.e., muscle strength) and skill-related components of physical fitness (i.e., balance), particularly in times of restricted physical activity due to pandemics. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to examine the effects of home-based balance exercises conducted during daily tooth brushing on measures of balance and muscle strength in healthy older adults. METHODS: Fifty-one older adults were randomly assigned to a balance exercise group (n = 27; age: 65.1 ± 1.1 years) or a passive control group (n = 24; age: 66.2 ± 3.3 years). The intervention group conducted balance exercises over a period of eight weeks twice daily for three minutes each during their daily tooth brushing routine. Pre- and post-intervention, tests were included for the assessment of static steady-state balance (i.e., Romberg test), dynamic steady-state balance (i.e., 10-m single and dual-task walk test using a cognitive and motor interference task), proactive balance (i.e., Timed-Up-and-Go Test [TUG], Functional-Reach-Test [FRT]), and muscle strength (i.e., Chair-Rise-Test [CRT]). RESULTS: Irrespective of group, the statistical analysis revealed significant main effects for time (pre vs. post) for dual-task gait speed (p < .001, 1.12 &#8804; d &#8804; 2.65), TUG (p < .001, d = 1.17), FRT (p = .002, d = 0.92), and CRT (p = .002, d = 0.94) but not for single-task gait speed and for the Romberg-Test. No significant group × time interactions were found for any of the investigated variables. CONCLUSIONS: The applied lifestyle balance training program conducted twice daily during tooth brushing routines appears not to be sufficient in terms of exercise dosage and difficulty level to enhance balance and muscle strength in healthy adults aged 60-72 years. Consequently, structured balance training programs using higher exercise dosages and/or more difficult balance tasks are recommended for older adults to improve balance and muscle strength.","Granacher, Urs; Muehlbauer, Thomas; Göstemeyer, Gerd; Gruber, Stefanie; Gruber, Markus",BMC Geriatr,726,29

These raw materials were composted with laboratory equipment, which was controlled at 60â after the temperature peak by autothermal composting. Clopyralid concentration did not changed during composting in the thermophilic phase; on the contrary, it increased because clopyralid accumulated in compost when recycled compost was used repeatedly as a bulking agent. The clopyralid accumulation ratio (ratio of clopyralid concentration to that in the first compost) could be explained by a model using a recurrence formula, and a correlation existed between the calculated (model) accumulation ratios and measured accumulation ratios (R2 = 0.78). Using this model, the excessive accumulation of clopyralid could be controlled when using recycled compost as a bulking agent with lower moisture content or when part of the recycled compost was replaced by another bulking agent, even if recycled compost had high moisture content. In future work, the model and its considerations should be verified in a field test.","Abe, Yoshiyuki; Tamura, Ken-Ichi; Seike, Nobuyasu",Anim Sci J,726,24

Policy levers, from mask wearing and social distancing to lockdowns and school closures, have been adopted and avoided with equal conviction by decisions makers who believe their measures are appropriate. In some contexts, the global pandemic has been treated with due seriousness by governments and political leaders while in others it has been downplayed to such an extent that it has been framed as a hoax. Every response to the pandemic has produced seemingly zero-sum debates and disputes over the veracity of knowledge bases, while uncertainty reigns as one of the few constants in decision making arenas. While it may be tempting to gravitate to the view that this unimaginable crisis is beyond the capacity of policy scholars to understand, this introductory article sets the scene for dispelling such a notion. It highlights how a number of core policy issues and perspectives, including the politics of problem framing, the limits of an evidence-based approach, and the nature of the public sector, can help bring analytical insights to this unprecedented crisis.

Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), administered every second week, has been proven to slow down disease progression and stabilize pulmonary function. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany, ERT was interrupted at our centre for 29 days. As reports on ERT discontinuation in LOPD are rare, our study aimed to analyse the impact of ERT interruption on the change in clinical outcome. METHODS: We performed a prospective cohort study in 12 LOPD patients. Clinical assessments were performed after ERT interruption and after the next three consecutive infusions. We assessed motor function by muscle strength testing, a 6-minute-walk-test, pulmonary function tests, and adverse events. For statistical analysis, an estimated baseline was calculated based on the individual yearly decline. RESULTS: The mean time of ERT interruption was 49.42 days (SD ± 12.54). During ERT interruption, seven patients reported 14 adverse events and two of them were severe. Frequent symptoms were reduced muscle endurance/increased muscle fatigability and shortness of breath/worsening of breathing impairment. After ERT interruption, significant deterioration was found for MIP%pred (p = 0.026) and MRC%pred, as well as a trend to clinical deterioration in FVC%pred and the 6MWT%pred. CONCLUSION: Interruption of ERT was associated with a deterioration in the core clinical outcome measures. Therefore, an interruption of ERT should be kept as short as possible.","Wenninger, Stephan; Gutschmidt, Kristina; Wirner, Corinna; Einvag, Krisztina; Montagnese, Federica; Schoser, Benedikt",J. neurol,726,16

A nutritional approach has the potential to be a low-cost, high-volume strategy that complements the existing standard of care. In this commentary, our aim is to provide an evidence-based, practical guide for athletes with injuries treated surgically or conservatively, along with healing and rehabilitation considerations. Injuries are a normal and expected part of exercise participation. Regardless of severity, an injury typically results in the athlete's short- or long-term removal from participation. Nutritional interventions may augment the recovery process and support optimal healing; therefore, incorporating nutritional strategies is important at each stage of the healing process. Preoperative nutrition and nutritional demands during rehabilitation are key factors to consider. The physiological response to wounds, immobilization, and traumatic brain injuries may be improved by optimizing macronutrient composition, caloric consumption, and nutrient timing and using select dietary supplements. Previous research supports practical nutrition recommendations to reduce surgical complications, minimize deficits after immobilization, and maximize the chance of safe return to play. These recommendations include identifying the individual's caloric requirements to ensure that energy needs are being met. A higher protein intake, with special attention to evenly distributed consumption throughout the day, will help to minimize loss of muscle and strength during immobilization. Dietary-supplement strategies may be useful when navigating the challenges of appropriate caloric intake and timing and a reduced appetite. The rehabilitation process also requires a strong nutritional plan to enhance recovery from injury. Athletic trainers, physical therapists, and other health care professionals should provide basic nutritional recommendations during rehabilitation, discuss the timing of meals with respect to therapy, and refer the patient to a registered dietitian if warranted. Because nutrition plays an essential role in injury recovery and rehabilitation, nutritional interventions should become a component of standard-of-care practice after injury. In this article, we address best practices for implementing nutritional strategies among patients with athletic injuries.","Smith-Ryan, Abbie E; Hirsch, Katie R; Saylor, Hannah E; Gould, Lacey M; Blue, Malia N M",J Athl Train,726,24

Our aims were to: O_LIestimate the time required to reach [≤]5 cases per day under three lockdown strengths (weak, moderate, strong), and four vaccination rollouts: (a) per the original plan, (b) prioritizing essential workers, (c) b plus rapid vaccination of 25% of <60-year-olds with AstraZeneca (AZ25), and (d) b plus rapid vaccination of 50% of <60-year-olds with AstraZeneca (AZ50). C_LIO_LIestimate the number of cases, hospitalizations, and deaths in the 100 days after 1/August for the 12 scenarios. C_LI MethodsAn agent-based model was adapted to NSW and the Delta variant. Hospitalization and mortality rates for unvaccinated COVID-19 infections were doubled given the virulence of Delta. ResultsThe business-as-usual rollout fully vaccinates 50%, 70% and 80% of >16-year-olds by 10/Oct, 21/Nov, and 28/Dec, respectively. This reduced to 1/Oct, 30/Oct, and 22/Nov for the fastest (AZ50) rollout. A strong lockdown with a rapid vaccine rollout was the fastest to reach [≤]5 cases (14-day average), with a median of 78 days (90% Uncertainty interval 61 - 103) or 18/Oct, compared to 207 days (166 - 254) or 24/Feb for a weak lockdown with no rollout acceleration. Increased lockdown strength had more impact than rollout acceleration. Under the AZ25 vaccination scenario, there were 1,440 (90% UI 262 - 10,600 deaths in the first 100 days of cases under a weak lockdown, compared to 71 (90% UI 26 - 178) under a strong lockdown scenario. ConclusionNSW will likely achieve 70% vaccination of >16-year-olds before reaching [≤]5 daily cases. Accelerating the vaccine rollout is important for the medium-term, but in the short-term increased restriction strength was more effective at reducing caseload (and subsequently mortality and hospitalisation) than accelerating the vaccine rollout. O_TEXTBOXSignificance of Study ""The known"" NSW is facing a Delta-variant COVID-19 outbreak, with a vaccination-led strategy for controlling the outbreak. Despite the increased infectivity and virulence of the Delta-variant, little contemporaneous modelling exists. We, therefore, model several restrictions and vaccination scenarios. ""The new"" NSW will likely achieve 70% vaccination of >16-year-olds before daily cases are [≤]5. Increased lockdown strength was more effective at reducing cases than accelerating the vaccine rollout.

As the infection rate rises significantly and this is followed by a dramatic increase in mortality, the whole world is struggling to accommodate change and is trying to adapt to new conditions. While a significant amount of effort is focused on developing a vaccine in order to make a game-changing anti-COVID-19 breakthrough, novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is also developing mutations rapidly as it transmits just like any other virus and there is always a substantial chance of the invented antibodies becoming ineffective as a function of time, thus failing to inhibit virus-to-cell binding efficiency as the spiked protein keeps evolving. Hence, controlling the transmission of the virus is crucial.

There is an urgent need for safe and effective preventive vaccines to curb this pandemic. A growing amount of related research has been published. This study aimed to provide the current status of COVID-19 vaccine using bibliometric analysis. We searched Embase.com and MEDLINE comprehensively and included articles, articles in press, reviews, short surveys, conference abstracts and conference papers about COVID-19 vaccine. VOSviewer1.6.11 (Leiden University, Leiden, Netherlands) was applied to perform the bibliometric analysis of these papers. A total of 1,312 papers were finally included. The BMJ has been the most popular journal in this field. The United States maintained a top position worldwide and has provided a pivotal influence, followed by China, India and United Kingdom. Among all the institutions, Harvard University was regarded as a leader for research collaboration. We analyzed the keywords and identified seven COVID-19 vaccine research hotspot clusters. COVID-19 vaccine research hotspots focus on clinical trials on vaccine safety and efficacy, research on vaccine immunology and immunoinformatics, and vaccine hesitancy. Our analysis results demonstrated that cooperation between countries, institutions, and authors were insufficient. The results suggested that clinical trials on vaccine safety, efficacy, immunology, immunoinformatics, production and delivery are research hotspots.

This article discusses relevant mechanistic underpinnings of this novel paradigm. It also addresses how such knowledge may be leveraged to develop novel electroceutical solutions to manage biofilm infection. Recent Advances: Systematic review and meta-analysis of several hundred wound studies reported a 78.2% prevalence of biofilms in chronic wounds. Biofilm infection is a major cause of delayed wound healing. In the host-microbe microenvironment, bioelectrical factors influence interactions between microbes and hosts. Critical Issues: Rapid biological responses are driven by electrical signals generated by ion currents moving across cell membranes. Bacterial life, growth, and function rely on a bioelectrical milieu, which when perturbed impairs their ability to form a biofilm, a major threat to health care. Electrokinetic stability of several viral particles depend on electrostatic forces. Weak electrical field strength, otherwise safe for humans, can be anti-microbial in this context. In the host, the electric field enhanced keratinocyte migration, bolstered immune defenses, improved mitochondrial function, and demonstrated multiple other effects consistent with supporting wound healing. A deeper mechanistic understanding of bioelectrical principles will inform the design of next-generation electroceuticals. Future Directions: This is an opportune moment in time as there is a surge of interest in electroceuticals in medicine. Projected to reach $35.5 billion by 2025, electroceuticals are becoming a cynosure in the global market. The World Health Organization reports that more than 50% of surgical site infections can be antibiotic resistant. Electroceuticals offer a serious alternative.","Sen, Chandan K; Mathew-Steiner, Shomita S; Das, Amitava; Sundaresan, Vishnu Baba; Roy, Sashwati",Antioxid Redox Signal,726,11

However, the development of high-efficiency NUV electroluminescent devices encounters great challenges and is far behind their RGB emitter counterparts. Besides the photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) of NUV materials being higher than 40%, charge injection and lopsided carrier transport also determine the device performance, leading to great efforts in optimizing the frontier molecular orbitals to fit the adjacent function layer. In the exploration of NUV materials, organic molecules are one of the primary candidates, given their preparative facility and structural variability. Recently, all-inorganic quantum-dot light-emitting diodes (QLEDs) of Cd-based, ZnSe, graphene and inorganic perovskite emitters and organic-inorganic hybrid lead halide perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) were demonstrated for achieving NUV electroluminescence.

But it is not clear whether endometriosis increases the risk of COVID-19. METHODS: Women who referred to the gynecology clinic were evaluated and 507 women with endometriosis (case group) were compared with 520 women without endometriosis (control group). COVID-19 infection, symptoms, exposure, hospitalization, isolation, H1N1 infection and vaccination, and past medical history of the participants were recorded and compared between the groups using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows version 21. RESULTS: Comparison between the groups represent COVID-19 infection in 3.2% of the case group and 3% of the control group (P = 0.942). The control group had a higher frequency of asymptomatic infection (95.7% vs. 94.5%; P < 0.001) and fever (1.6% vs. 0%; P = 0.004), while the frequency of rare symptoms was more common in the case group (P < 0.001). The average disease period was 14 days in both groups (P = 0.694).

Around 70% of the coronavirus positive-sense single-stranded RNA encodes proteins involved in replication, and these viruses essentially take over the biosynthetic and transport mechanisms to ensure the efficient replication of their genome and trafficking of their virions. Some coronaviruses encode genes for ion-channel proteins - the envelope protein E (orf4a), orf3a and orf8 - which they successfully employ to take control of the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi complex intermediate compartment or ERGIC. The E protein, which is one of the four structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses, assembles its transmembrane protomers into homopentameric channels with mild cationic selectivity. Orf3a forms homodimers and homotetramers. Both carry a PDZ-binding domain, lending them the versatility to interact with more than 400 target proteins in infected host cells. Orf8 is a very short 29-amino-acid single-passage transmembrane peptide that forms cation-selective channels when assembled in lipid bilayers. This review addresses the contribution of biophysical and structural biology approaches that unravel different facets of coronavirus ion channels, their effects on the cellular machinery of infected cells and some structure-functional correlations with ion channels of higher organisms.","Barrantes, Francisco J",Acta Crystallogr D Struct Biol,726,26

Although numerous studies have already been published on this topic, there has not been compelling evidence critically assessing the impact of COVID-19 by and on climate change. The present study fills this gap by taking a more holistic approach to elaborate factors, e.g., natural and anthropogenic factors, ocean submesoscales, radiative forces, and greenhouse gas/CO2 emissions, that may affect climate change in a more prevalent and pronounced manner. Based on the statistical data collected from the NASA Earth Observatory, the European Space Agency, and the Global Carbon Project, the findings of this study reveal that the climate/environment has improved during COVID-19, including better environmental quality and water quality with low carbon emissions and sound pollution. In the lockdown during the epidemic, the emissions of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and carbon dioxide (CO2) significantly decreased because of the lower usage of transportation, decreased electricity demand, and halted industrial activities. The policy implications of this study suggested that keeping the climate healthy even in the post-COVID-19 era is a serious concern that needs to be addressed by investing in clean and green projects, ensuring green energy evolution, dealing with a large volume of medical waste, building health-ensuring and livable societies, and halting the funding of pollution. For governmental and regulatory bodies, these factors will provide a strong foundation to build safer, healthier, and environmentally friendly societies for generations to come.","Usman, Muhammad; Husnain, Mudassir; Riaz, Aimon; Riaz, Areej; Ali, Yameen",Environ. sci. pollut. res. int.

OBJECTIVES: To investigate the mechanism of microthrombosis in COVID-19 progression. PATIENTS/METHODS: We assessed VWF antigen (VWF:Ag), VWF ristocetin-cofactor (VWF:RCo), VWF multimers, VWF propeptide (VWFpp) and ADAMTS13 activity in a cross-sectional study of 50 patients stratified according to their admission to three different intensity of care units: low (requiring high-flow nasal cannula oxygenation, n=14), intermediate (requiring continuous positive airway pressure devices, n=17), high (requiring mechanical ventilation, n=19). RESULTS: Median VWF:Ag, VWF:RCo and VWFpp levels were markedly elevated in COVID-19 patients and increased with intensity of care, with VWF:Ag being 268, 386 and 476 IU/dL, VWF:RCo 216, 334 and 388 IU/dL, and VWFpp 156, 172 and 192 IU/dL in patients at low, intermediate and high intensity of care, respectively. Conversely, the high-to-low molecular weight VWF multimers ratios progressively decreased with increasing intensity of care, as well as median ADAMTS13 activity levels, which ranged from 82 IU/dL for patients at low intensity of care to 62 and 55 IU/dL for those at intermediate and high intensity of care. CONCLUSIONS: We found a significant alteration of the VWF-ADAMTS13 axis in COVID-19 patients, with an elevated VWF:Ag to ADAMTS13 activity ratio that was strongly associated with disease severity. Such an imbalance enhances the hypercoagulable state of COVID-19 patients and their risk of microthrombosis.","Mancini, Ilaria; Baronciani, Luciano; Artoni, Andrea; Colpani, Paola; Biganzoli, Marina; Cozzi, Giovanna; Novembrino, Cristina; Boscolo Anzoletti, Massimo; De Zan, Valentina; Pagliari, Maria Teresa; Gualtierotti, Roberta; Aliberti, Stefano; Panigada, Mauro; Grasselli, Giacomo; Blasi, Francesco; Peyvandi, Flora",J. thromb. haemost,726,16

There is limited data about patients with end-stage renal disease who also suffer from COVID-19. In this report, we discuss the case of a hemodialysis patient who developed COVID-19 pneumonia in the clinical course. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 79-year-old man who had end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and was taking regular hemodialysis was admitted to hospital for a fever and dry cough. The patient, who also had cardiovascular disease, had no history of contact with COVID-2019 patients. DIAGNOSIS: The patient was diagnosed with COVID-2019 by the reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and his pharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 was positive. INTERVENTION: The treatment was mainly supportive and the patient was intensively monitored. He was treated with oxygen, broad-spectrum antibiotics, antiviral drugs, and methylprednisolone. The patient took continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) every 2 days. OUTCOMES: After 19 days, an RT-PCR assay for SARS-CoV-2 was negative, and computed tomography (CT) of the patient's thorax indicated that the pulmonary inflammatory exudation was absorbed and pulmonary infection improved significantly. He was discharged on day 29 after recovering from COVID-2019 pneumonia. LESSONS: The courses of disease and treatment options for this individual were significantly more complicated than those for ordinary patients. Therefore, it was necessary to monitor the condition of the patient closely and to protect the dialysis unit staff from being infected. Compared with other severe COVID-2019 cases, this patient recovered more quickly following treatment, which was likely due to the removal of inflammatory mediators by CRRT. This implies that blood purification might be an important option for hemodialysis patients with COVID-19.","Huang, Luyan; Wang, Yiru; Wang, Lisheng; Lv, Yongman; Liu, Qingquan",Medicine (Baltimore),726,5

As of March 26, 2020, there are more than 500,000 cases and more than 25,000 deaths related to COVID-19, and the numbers are increasing by the hour. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to explore the trends in confirmed COVID-19 cases in North Carolina, and to understand patterns in virtual visits related to symptoms of COVID-19. METHODS: We conducted a cohort study of confirmed COVID-19 cases and patients using an on-demand, statewide virtual urgent care center. We collected data from February 1, 2020, to March 15, 2020. Institutional Review Board exemption was obtained prior to the study. RESULTS: As of March, 18 2020, there were 92 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 733 total virtual visits. Of the total visits, 257 (35.1%) were related to COVID-19-like symptoms. Of the COVID-19-like visits, the number of females was 178 (69.2%). People in the age groups of 30-39 years (n=67, 26.1%) and 40-49 years (n=64, 24.9%) were half of the total patients. Additionally, approximately 96.9% (n=249) of the COVID-like encounters came from within the state of North Carolina. Our study shows that virtual care can provide efficient triaging in the counties with the highest number of COVID-19 cases. We also confirmed that the largest spread of the disease occurs in areas with a high population density as well as in areas with major airports. CONCLUSIONS: The use of virtual care presents promising potential in the fight against COVID-19. Virtual care is capable of reducing emergency room visits, conserving health care resources, and avoiding the spread of COVID-19 by treating patients remotely. We call for further adoption of virtual care by health systems across the United States and the world during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Khairat, Saif; Meng, Chenlu; Xu, Yuxuan; Edson, Barbara; Gianforcaro, Robert",JMIR Public Health Surveill,726,16

In contrast to the case fatality rate (CFR), the IFR depends on the total number of infected individuals - not just on the number of confirmed cases. In order to estimate the IFR, several seroprevalence studies have been or are currently conducted. METHODS: Using German COVID-19 surveillance data and age-group specific IFR estimates from multiple international studies, this work investigates time-dependent variations in effective IFR over the course of the pandemic. Three different methods for estimating (effective) IFRs are presented: (a) population-averaged IFRs based on the assumption that the infection risk is independent of age and time, (b) effective IFRs based on the assumption that the age distribution of confirmed cases approximately reflects the age distribution of infected individuals, and (c) effective IFRs accounting for age- and time-dependent dark figures of infections. RESULTS: Effective IFRs in Germany are estimated to vary over time, as the age distributions of confirmed cases and estimated infections are changing during the course of the pandemic. In particular during the first and second waves of infections in spring and autumn/winter 2020, there has been a pronounced shift in the age distribution of confirmed cases towards older age groups, resulting in larger effective IFR estimates. The temporary increase in effective IFR during the first wave is estimated to be smaller but still remains when adjusting for age- and time-dependent dark figures. A comparison of effective IFRs with observed CFRs indicates that a substantial fraction of the time-dependent variability in observed mortality can be explained by changes in the age distribution of infections. Furthermore, a vanishing gap between effective IFRs and observed CFRs is apparent after the first infection wave, while an increasing gap can be observed during the second wave. CONCLUSIONS: The development of estimated effective IFR and observed CFR reflects the changing age distribution of infections over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany. Further research is warranted to obtain timely age-stratified IFR estimates, particularly in light of new variants of the virus.","Staerk, Christian; Wistuba, Tobias; Mayr, Andreas",BMC Public Health,726,23

DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: NHS hospitals in England. PARTICIPANTS: 47 780 individuals (mean age 65, 55% men) in hospital with covid-19 and discharged alive by 31 August 2020, exactly matched to controls from a pool of about 50 million people in England for personal and clinical characteristics from 10 years of electronic health records. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Rates of hospital readmission (or any admission for controls), all cause mortality, and diagnoses of respiratory, cardiovascular, metabolic, kidney, and liver diseases until 30 September 2020. Variations in rate ratios by age, sex, and ethnicity. RESULTS: Over a mean follow-up of 140 days, nearly a third of individuals who were discharged from hospital after acute covid-19 were readmitted (14 060 of 47 780) and more than 1 in 10 (5875) died after discharge, with these events occurring at rates four and eight times greater, respectively, than in the matched control group. Rates of respiratory disease (P<0.001), diabetes (P<0.001), and cardiovascular disease (P<0.001) were also significantly raised in patients with covid-19, with 770 (95% confidence interval 758 to 783), 127 (122 to 132), and 126 (121 to 131) diagnoses per 1000 person years, respectively. Rate ratios were greater for individuals aged less than 70 than for those aged 70 or older, and in ethnic minority groups compared with the white population, with the largest differences seen for respiratory disease (10.5 (95% confidence interval 9.7 to 11.4) for age less than 70 years v 4.6 (4.3 to 4.8) for age &#8805;70, and 11.4 (9.8 to 13.3) for non-white v 5.2 (5.0 to 5.5) for white individuals). CONCLUSIONS: Individuals discharged from hospital after covid-19 had increased rates of multiorgan dysfunction compared with the expected risk in the general population. The increase in risk was not confined to the elderly and was not uniform across ethnicities. The diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of post-covid syndrome requires integrated rather than organ or disease specific approaches, and urgent research is needed to establish the risk factors.","Ayoubkhani, Daniel; Khunti, Kamlesh; Nafilyan, Vahé; Maddox, Thomas; Humberstone, Ben; Diamond, Ian; Banerjee, Amitava",BMJ,726,20

METHODS: A cross-sectional multicentric survey was developed and disseminated online to various academic EDs in India and followed up over a period of 8 wk. All results were analyzed using descriptive statistics. RESULTS: Twenty-eight academic emergency medicine departments responded to the study. Compared with pre-COVID period, COVID-19 pandemic has led to 90% of centers developing separate triage system with dedicated care areas for COVID suspected/infected in 78.6% centers with nearly 70% using separate transportation pathways. Strategizing and executing the Institutional COVID-19 treatment protocol in 80% institutes were done by emergency physicians. Training exercises for airway management and personal protective equipment (PPE) use were seen in 93% and 80% centers, respectively. Marked variation in recommended PPE use was observed across EDs in India. CONCLUSIONS: Our study highlights the high variance in the level of preparedness response among various EDs across India during the pandemic.

Hand hygiene effectiveness may be produce-commodity specific, which could influence implementation strategies. This study's goal was to determine if produce commodity influences the ability of handwashing with soap and water or Two-Step ABHS interventions to reduce soil and bacteria on farmworker hands. Farmworkers (n = 326) harvested produce for 30-90 minutes before engaging in handwashing (cantaloupe, jalapeño, and tomato), Two-Step ABHS (jalapeño and cantaloupe), or no hand hygiene. Hands were rinsed to measure amounts of soil (absorbance at 600 nm) and indicator bacteria (coliforms, Enterococccus, generic Escherichia coli, and Bacteroidales universal [AllBac] and human-specific [BFD] 16S rDNA markers). Without hand hygiene, bacterial concentrations (0.88 to 5.1 log10 CFU/hand) on hands significantly differed by the produce commodity harvested. Moderate significant correlations (&#961; = -0.41 to 0.56) between soil load and bacterial concentrations were observed. There were significant produce-commodity specific differences in the ability of handwashing and Two-Step ABHS interventions to reduce soil (P < 0.0001), coliforms (P = 0.002), and Enterococcus (P = 0.003), but not the Bacteroidales markers AllBac (P = 0.4) or BFD (P = 0.3). Contamination was more difficult to remove from cantaloupe farmworker hands. Overall, we found that a Two-Step ABHS intervention was similar to handwashing with soap and water at reducing bacteria on farmworker hands. In sum, produce commodity type should be considered when developing hand hygiene interventions on farms.IMPORTANCE This study demonstrated that the type of produce commodity handled influences the ability of handwashing with soap and water or a Two-Step alcohol-based hand sanitizer (ABHS) intervention to reduce soil and bacterial hand contamination. Handwashing with soap and water, as recommended by the FDA's Produce Safety Rule, when tested in three agricultural environments, does not always reduce bacterial loads. Consistent with past results, we found that the Two-Step ABHS method performed similarly to handwashing with soap and water, but also does not always reduce bacterial loads in these contexts. Given the ease of use of the Two-Step ABHS method, which may increase compliance, the Two-Step ABHS method should be further evaluated and possibly considered for implementation in the agricultural environment. Taken together, this study provides important information on hand hygiene effectiveness in three agricultural contexts.","Prince-Guerra, Jessica L; Nace, Molly E; Lyles, Robert H; Fabiszewski de Aceituno, Anna M; Bartz, Faith E; Arbogast, James W; Gentry-Shields, Jennifer; Jaykus, Lee-Ann; Heredia, Norma; García, Santos; Leon, Juan S",,726,0

In the present study, we investigated the role of PGRN in regulating chondrocyte homeostasis and its therapeutic potential for managing osteoarthritis (OA). We found that PGRN levels are significantly increased in human cartilage in mild OA and that its expression is decreased in the cartilage in severe OA. In vitro, treatment of primary rat chondrocytes with recombinant PGRN significantly enhanced the levels of collagen type II alpha 1 chain (COL2A1) and aggrecan, and attenuated TNF-&#945;-induced up-regulation of matrix metallopeptidase 13 (MMP13) and ADAM metallopeptidase with thrombospondin type 1 motif 5 (ADAMTS5) in chondrocytes. These effects were abrogated in SIRT1-/- cells, indicating a causative role of SIRT1 in the effects of PGRN on protein expression in chondrocytes. Mechanistically, PGRN increased SIRT1 expression and activity, which reduced the acetylation levels of SRY-box transcription factor (SOX9) and transcription factor P65 (P65) and thereby promoted nuclear translocation of SOX9 and inhibited TNF-&#945;-induced P65 nuclear accumulation to maintain chondrocyte homeostasis. In conclusion, our findings reveal a mechanism of action for PGRN that maintains cartilage homeostasis and support the notion that PGRN up-regulation may be a promising strategy for managing OA.","Feng, Dongxu; Kang, Xiaomin; Wang, Ruiqi; Chen, He; Zhang, Kun; Feng, Weilou; Li, Huixia; Zhu, Yangjun; Wu, Shufang",J. biol. chem,726,24

Hip fracture patients represent a high-risk population for severe COVID-19 symptoms, as they are generally older with multiple medical comorbidities. There has been limited information available on the presenting characteristics and outcomes of COVID-positive patients with hip fractures who undergo surgical treatment. Methods: This was a retrospective study of 10 patients ≥60 years of age with a hip fracture and COVID-19 who underwent surgical treatment in New York City during the COVID-19 outbreak from March 1, 2020 to May 22, 2020. Clinical characteristics and early postoperative outcomes were reported. Results: Eight out of the 10 COVID-positive hip fracture patients in our series were asymptomatic on admission with no clinical signs or symptoms of COVID-19 infection. Only 2 patients presented with hypoxia. All 10 patients underwent surgery within 2 days of admission. Five out of the 10 patients – including the patients who presented with hypoxia – subsequently required supplemental oxygen postoperatively. Two patients had persistently elevated oxygen demands requiring prolonged administration of supplemental oxygen therapy beyond postoperative day 3. None of the patients were put on mechanical ventilation. One patient had a presumed venous thromboembolism postoperatively and subsequently died on postoperative day 19, likely due to respiratory failure. There were no other deaths in the early postoperative period. The average length of inpatient stay was 7.8 days. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that hip fracture patients who present with asymptomatic or mild COVID-19 infection may have temporarily increased oxygen demands postoperatively, but they can safely undergo early surgical intervention after appropriate medical optimization.","Cheung, Zoe B.; Forsh, David A.",J.

Elevated expression of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) entry receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 on cardiac cells of patients with heart diseases may be related to cardiovascular burden. We have thus analysed cardiovascular and inflammatory microRNAs (miRs), sensitive markers of cardiovascular damage, in critically ill, ventilated patients with COVID-19 or influenza-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome (Influenza-ARDS) admitted to the intensive care unit and healthy controls. METHODS AND RESULTS: Circulating miRs (miR-21, miR-126, miR-155, miR-208a, and miR-499) were analysed in a discovery cohort consisting of patients with mechanically-ventilated COVID-19 (n = 18) and healthy controls (n = 15). A validation study was performed in an independent cohort of mechanically-ventilated COVID-19 patients (n = 20), Influenza-ARDS patients (n = 13) and healthy controls (n = 32). In both cohorts, RNA was isolated from serum and cardiovascular disease/inflammatory-relevant miR concentrations were measured by miR-specific TaqMan PCR analyses. In both the discovery and the validation cohort, serum concentration of miR-21, miR-155, miR-208a and miR-499 were significantly increased in COVID-19 patients compared to healthy controls. Calculating the area under the curve using receiver operating characteristic analysis miR-155, miR-208a and miR-499 showed a clear distinction between COVID-19 and Influenza-ARDS patients. CONCLUSION: In this exploratory study, inflammation and cardiac myocyte-specific miRs were upregulated in critically ill COVID-19 patients. Importantly, miR profiles were able to differentiate between severely ill, mechanically-ventilated Influenza-ARDS and COVID-19 patients, indicating a rather specific response and cardiac involvement of COVID-19.","Garg, Ankita; Seeliger, Benjamin; Derda, Anselm A; Xiao, Ke; Gietz, Anika; Scherf, Kristian; Sonnenschein, Kristina; Pink, Isabell; Hoeper, Marius M; Welte, Tobias; Bauersachs, Johann; David, Sascha; Bär, Christian; Thum, Thomas",Eur J Heart Fail,726,24

This review provides an update on awake prone positioning for hypoxaemic respiratory failure, in both coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and non-COVID-19 patients.

Awake prone positioning has been used with the aim to prevent intensive care unit admission and mechanical ventilation. Prone positioning in conscious, non-intubated COVID-19 patients is used in emergency departments, medical wards and intensive care units.Several trials reported an improvement in oxygenation and respiratory rate during prone positioning, but impacts on clinical outcomes, particularly on intubation rates and survival, remain unclear.

Patients with mild, moderate, severe and critical illness were 18.3, 32.3, 31.1 and 18.3 per cent, respectively, at the time of ICU admission. The proportions (95% confidence interval) of patients requiring any form of oxygen therapy, oxygen therapy by high-flow nasal cannula and invasive mechanical ventilation were 77, 21.7 and 25.5 per cent, respectively, within 24 h of hospital admission. The 24 h ICU mortality was 8.5 per cent, and non-survivors had higher respiratory rate (P <0.01, n=198) and lower baseline oxyhaemoglobin saturation (P <0.001, n=198) at presentation and higher baseline serum lactate (P <0.01, n=122), total leucocyte count (P <0.001, n=186), absolute neutrophil count (P <0.001, n=132), prothrombin time (P <0.05, n=54) and INR (P <0.05, n=54) compared to survivors. Interpretation & conclusions: Nearly half of the patients presented with severe and critical disease and required high-flow nasal oxygen or invasive mechanical ventilation at admission. Severity of the presenting respiratory illness, haematological parameters and lactate rather than age or presence of comorbidity predicted early death within 24 h.","Kayina, Choro Athiphro; Haritha, Damarla; Soni, Lipika; Behera, Srikant; Nair, Parvathy Ramachandran; Gouri, M; Girish, Kavitha; Deeparaj, L; Maitra, Souvik; Anand, Rahul Kumar; Ray, Bikash Ranjan; Baidya, Dalim Kumar; Subramaniam, Rajeshwari",Indian J Med Res,726,24

The fields of human genetics and public health have highlighted the relevance of an implementation strategy at a national level in Italy, including integration in sanitary regulations and governance instruments. In this review, the emerging field of public health genomics is discussed, including the polygenic scores approach, epigenetic modulation, nutrigenomics, and microbiomes implications. Moreover, the Italian state of implementation is presented. The omics sciences have important implications for the prevention of both communicable and noncommunicable diseases, especially because they can be used to assess the health status during the whole course of life. An effective population health gain is possible if omics tools are implemented for each person after a preliminary assessment of effectiveness in the medium to long term.","Traversi, Deborah; Pulliero, Alessandra; Izzotti, Alberto; Franchitti, Elena; Iacoviello, Licia; Gianfagna, Francesco; Gialluisi, Alessandro; Izzi, Benedetta; Agodi, Antonella; Barchitta, Martina; Calabrò, Giovanna Elisa; Hoxhaj, Ilda; Sassano, Michele; Sbrogiò, Luca Gino; Del Sole, Annamaria; Marchiori, Francesco; Pitini, Erica; Migliara, Giuseppe; Marzuillo, Carolina; De Vito, Corrado; Tamburro, Manuela; Sammarco, Michela Lucia; Ripabelli, Giancarlo; Villari, Paolo; Boccia, Stefania",,726,1

Smoking is one of the main risk factors for infections in the respiratory tract, digestive tract, reproductive tract, and other systems in humans, increasing the prevalence of HIV, tuberculosis, SARS-CoV, and the current SARS-CoV-2. Smoking cessation can reduce the risk of infection. Smoking increases the incidence of infections and aggravates the progress and prognosis of infectious diseases in a dose-dependent manner.

Automated detection of COVID-19 infection from CT images based on deep models is important for faster examination. Unfortunately, collecting large-scale training data systematically in the early stage is difficult. To address this problem, we explore the feasibility of learning deep models for lung and COVID-19 infection segmentation from a single radiological image by resorting to synthesizing diverse radiological images. Specifically, we propose a novel conditional generative model, called CoSinGAN, which can be learned from a single radiological image with a given condition, i.e., the annotation mask of the lungs and infected regions. Our CoSinGAN is able to capture the conditional distribution of the single radiological image, and further synthesize high-resolution (512 × 512) and diverse radiological images that match the input conditions precisely. We evaluate the efficacy of CoSinGAN in learning lung and infection segmentation from very few radiological images by performing 5-fold cross validation on COVID-19-CT-Seg dataset (20 CT cases) and an independent testing on the MosMed dataset (50 CT cases). Both 2D U-Net and 3D U-Net, learned from four CT slices by using our CoSinGAN, have achieved notable infection segmentation performance, surpassing the COVID-19-CT-Seg-Benchmark, i.e., the counterparts trained on an average of 704 CT slices, by a large margin. Such results strongly confirm that our method has the potential to learn COVID-19 infection segmentation from few radiological images in the early stage of COVID-19 pandemic.","Zhang, Pengyi; Zhong, Yunxin; Deng, Yulin; Tang, Xiaoying; Li, Xiaoqiong",Diagnostics (Basel),726,16

Here, we retrospectively reviewed the clinical and immunological data from 18 fatal COVID-19 cases, results showed that these patients had severe lymphocytopenia, together with high serum levels of inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-8 and IL-10), and elevation of many other mediators in routine laboratory tests, including C-reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase, &#945;-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase and natriuretic peptide type B. The spleens and hilar lymph nodes (LNs) from six additional COVID-19 patients with post-mortem examinations were also collected, histopathologic detection showed that both organs manifested severe tissue damage and lymphocyte apoptosis in these six cases. In situ hybridization assays illustrated that SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA accumulates in these tissues, and transmission electronic microscopy confirmed that coronavirus-like particles were visible in the LNs. SARS-CoV-2 Spike and Nucleocapsid protein (NP) accumulated in the spleens and LNs, and the NP antigen restricted in angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) positive macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs). Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 triggered the transcription of Il6, Il8 and Il1b genes in infected primary macrophages and DCs in vitro, and SARS-CoV-2-NP+ macrophages and DCs also manifested high levels of IL-6 and IL-1ß, which might directly decimate human spleens and LNs and subsequently lead to lymphocytopenia in vivo. Collectively, these results demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 induced lymphocytopenia by promoting systemic inflammation and direct neutralization in human spleen and LNs.","Xiang, Qun; Feng, Zeqing; Diao, Bo; Tu, Chao; Qiao, Qinghua; Yang, Han; Zhang, Yi; Wang, Gang; Wang, Huiming; Wang, Chenhui; Liu, Liang; Wang, Changsong; Liu, Longding; Chen, Rong; Wu, Yuzhang; Chen, Yongwen",Front Immunol,726,2

At present, the situation of the new crown pneumonia epidemic remains full of tension and uncertainty. It is of concern is that the worst outbreak in the world is in the United States. The total number of confirmed new cases of COVID-19 and the total number of new deaths in the United States have entered their second and third cyclical peaks since the White House announced the “Open America Again” guidelines on April 16, 2020, and the start of the US presidential election season in August 2020. This paper combines the generalized exponential model (EXPM) with Chebyshev polynomials to develop a special generalized growth model (GGM) to predict the total number of daily new confirmed cases and the total number of new deaths in the United States for three periods under a 14-day sensitivity regression model. In this paper, the US epidemic is divided into three periods from early January 2020 to early January 2021, and three forecasts are made for the three periods.The first two prediction periods have already occurred and the predictions match well with known results, and the third period predicts that the total number of new confirmed cases of COVID-19 and the total number of new deaths in the United States will fall to a minimum level by next July, when the supply of COVID-19 vaccine has already begun. The results suggest that the “Open America Again” policy and the events of the 2020 US presidential election season have contributed to the worsening of the COVID-19 in the United States.","Yan, Kejia Yan Huqin Gupta Rakesh",Infectious Disease Modelling,726,16

METHODS: The survey questionnaire was designed by a team of experts based on a review of the literature and was distributed electronically through the Saudi Commission for Health Specialties to residents registered in all radiology residency training programs in Saudi Arabia during the academic year 2019 to 2020. Categorical variables were presented as counts and percentage. Numerical variables were presented as mean and standard deviation if normally distributed. Chi-square testing was used to compare categorical variables with the perceived impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Spearman correlation was used to correlate numerical variables at the level of significance p-value < 0.05. RESULTS: A total of 109 residents completed the online survey during the study period, with a response rate of 32.2% (109/337). The mean age was 27.3 years (standard deviation, 1.86). The majority of respondents (71.5%, 78/109) reported either a severe or moderate negative impact on educational activities. Also, the majority (73.4%, 80/109) reported either a minimal or moderate negative impact on clinical activities. Residents training in the western province perceived a statistically higher negative impact on educational activities compared to their peers in other regions (pâ¯=â¯0.01). Residents in their second year of residency training perceived a statistically higher negative impact on their participation in clinical activities (pâ¯=â¯0.014). Less than half of the respondents (45.9%, 50/109) reported that they were redeployed to work in another department. The majority (80%, 40/50) reported a negative impact on their well-being.

Although most SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals manifest with a self-limited mild disease that resolves with supportive care in the outpatient setting, patients with moderate to severe COVID-19 will require a multidisciplinary collaborative management approach for optimal care in the hospital setting. Laboratory and radiologic studies provide critical information on disease severity, management options, and overall prognosis. Medical management is mostly supportive with antipyretics, hydration, oxygen supplementation, and other measures as dictated by clinical need. Among its medical complications is a characteristic proinflammatory cytokine storm often associated with end-organ dysfunction, including respiratory failure, liver and renal insufficiency, cardiac injury, and coagulopathy. Specific recommendations for the management of these medical complications are discussed. Despite the issuance of emergency use authorization for remdesivir, there are still no proven effective antiviral and immunomodulatory therapies, and their use in COVID-19 management should be guided by clinical trial protocols or treatment registries. The medical care of patients with COVID-19 extends beyond their hospitalization. Postdischarge follow-up and monitoring should be performed, preferably using telemedicine, until the patients have fully recovered from their illness and are released from home quarantine protocols.","Razonable, Raymund R; Pennington, Kelly M; Meehan, Anne M; Wilson, John W; Froemming, Adam T; Bennett, Courtney E; Marshall, Ariela L; Virk, Abinash; Carmona, Eva M",Mayo Clin Proc,726,1

Materials and Methods: This is a cross-sectional (n =268) study from a public dental college in Riyadh. We collected data on MWB and CPS. An 18-item online survey was used to collect the responses from the participants. The inter-rater reliability for the finalised survey came out to be 0.86. Results: The participants (54.3%) who were infected with COVID-19 recorded that their CPS were significantly affected (almost 4 times higher) as compared to others (OR= 4.02;P=0.0004). However, 42.2% reported infection control measures at clinics resulted in bringing significant (OR=2.22, P=0.04) psychological upsets, for those who were infected with COVID-19. Participants (45.1%) also reported that they have difficulty in recalling old memories or information due to the COVID-19 pandemic;among them, 46.7% were the ones who (and/or any family member) were exposed to COVID-19. Conclusion: The study spotlighted the extent of dental students' MWB and its significant effect on their CPS once (themselves or a family member) infected with COVID-19. Moreover, levels of infection control measures at clinics resulted in psychological upsets for dental students. Clinical Significance: The issue is fundamental as participants enter the clinical workforce and face the ever-increasing demands of dental practice.","Alrashed, F. A.; Sattar, K.; Habib, S.

The use of this method revealed the existence of general rules for the cooperative oligomeric organization of a wide list of genomes. These rules are called hyperbolic because they are associated with hyperbolic sequences including the harmonic progression 1, 1/2, 1/3, .., 1/n. These rules are demonstrated by examples of quantitative analysis of many genomes from the human genome to the genomes of archaea and bacteria. The hyperbolic (harmonic) rules, speaking about the existence of algebraic invariants in full genomic sequences, are considered as candidates for the role of universal rules for the cooperative organization of genomes. The results concerns additionally the problem of the origin of life. The described phenomenological results were obtained as consequences of the previously published author's quantum-information model of long DNA sequences. The oligomer sums method was also applied to the analysis of long genes and viruses including the COVID-19 virus; this revealed, in characteristics of many of them, the phenomenon of such rhythmically repeating deviations from model hyperbolic sequences, which are associated with DNA triplets. In addition, an application of the oligomer sums method is shown to the analysis of amino acid sequences in long proteins like the protein Titin. The topics of the algebraic harmony in living bodies and of the quantum-information approach in biology are discussed.","Petoukhov, Sergey V",Biosystems,726,20

They are afraid to seek help due to stigmatization and environmental ostracism. The goal of the study is to analyze the psychological support and stress management programs for students supported by medical schools in Poland. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The authors sent out e-mails with 9 questions regarding the issue being analyzed to all 19 medical schools in Poland. They obtained answers from 15 such schools, which corresponds to a response rate of 79%. The study was conducted in 2018-2019, before the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. RESULTS: Due to the lack of central regulations, support is provided by medical schools individually. Those solutions focus on short-term, temporary therapy. If a longer therapy is needed, students are redirected to external health providers. Moreover, information about the support is not transferred by student-friendly communication channels. CONCLUSIONS: Support should be flexible, and it should quickly adapt to the emerging trends and consider students' feedback. A future model of psychological support could be a center organized as a transfer point between a university problem-solving facility and external health providers, concentrating on short-term activity. Quick support would eliminate potential complications and more serious mental problems.","Walkiewicz, Maciej; Guziak, Mateusz",Int. j. occup. med. environ. health,726,20

Extensive crosstalk between the primary Ang II receptor, Ang type 1 receptor (AT1R), and the cannabinoid type 1 receptor (CB1R) has been demonstrated by various groups in the last decade. Since activation of glial CB1R has been demonstrated to play a key role in the resolution of inflammatory states, we investigated the role of Ang II (100 nM) and/or ACEA (10 nM), a potent CB1R-specific agonist in the regulation of inflammatory markers in astrocytes from spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and Wistar rats. Astrocytes were cultured from brainstems and cerebellums of SHR and Wistar rats and assayed for IL1ß and IL10 gene expression and secreted fraction, in treated and non-treated cells, by employing qPCR and ELISA, respectively. mRNA expression of both IL10 and IL1ß were significantly elevated in untreated brainstem and cerebellar astrocytes isolated from SHR when compared to Wistar astrocytes. No changes were observed in the secreted fraction. While ACEA-treatment resulted in a significant increase in IL10 gene expression in Wistar brainstem astrocytes (Log2FC &#8805; 1, p < 0.05), its effect in SHR brainstem astrocytes was diminished. Ang II treatment resulted in a strong inhibitory effect on IL10 gene expression in astrocytes from both brain regions of SHR and Wistar rats (Log2FC &#8804; -1, p < 0.05), and an increase in IL1ß gene expression in brainstem astrocytes from both strains (Log2FC &#8805; 1, p < 0.05). Co-treatment of Ang II and ACEA resulted in neutralization of Ang II-mediated effect in Wistar brainstem and cerebellar astrocytes, but not SHR astrocytes. Neither Ang II nor ACEA resulted in any significant changes in IL10 or IL1ß secreted proteins. These data suggest that Ang II and ACEA have opposing roles in the regulation of inflammatory gene signature in astrocytes isolated from SHR and Wistar rats. This however does not translate into changes in their secreted fractions.","Haspula, Dhanush; Clark, Michelle A",Molecules (Basel),726,24

SUMMARY: MTM clinical pharmacists at JHHCG collaborate with patients to identify barriers to adherence, review medications, and develop plans for improvement. Through improved medication adherence, the goals for this program are to reduce adverse effects, patient cost, and medical visits or hospital admissions. Central to this practice is the belief that strong patient relationships are necessary to uncover the root cause of medication nonadherence. In Postgraduate Year-1 (PGY-1) community-based pharmacy residency training, new pharmacists learn the value of building relationships with patients and working through complex problems during this clinical experience. By assisting patients with complex medical conditions and social situations, new pharmacists gain skills in patient care, pharmacy operations, and medication access challenges. As the COVID-19 pandemic forced the discontinuation of face-to-face interactions in this setting, rotation experiences for residents were adapted with the goal of continuing high-impact patient interactions and keeping everyone involved safe. CONCLUSION: Although considerable changes were made to the MTM rotation because of the COVID-19 pandemic, residents were still able to provide meaningful clinical care telephonically and continued to learn valuable patient care skills. Most importantly, high quality care was still delivered to the patients despite considerable challenges. The major challenge for the residents' clinical experiences as a result of the adjustments has been finding an impactful volume of complex patients to enhance their skills. Other residency programs are encouraged to consider three recommendations to improve their rotations moving forward.","Pennock, Danielle; Barbour, Lauren; Green, Robert; Fu, Denise",,726,20

Appendicitis is a common occurrence in pregnancy, with most obstetric centres seeing about one or two cases a year. Though maternal morbidity and mortality are relatively unimpacted by this event, fetal loss and preterm labour are common sequelae. This case involves a 35-year-old woman presenting in her third trimester with abdominal pain and who went on to be diagnosed with concurrent appendicitis and SARS-CoV-2 infection. Although spinal anaesthesia would be most appropriate as it avoids aerosol generation, general anaesthetic techniques were indicated due to thrombocytopenia in this case.

Major research streams over the last decades investigated either satisfaction with offices in relation to physical comfort, or how layout decisions influenced interaction and collaboration in the workplace with a focus on open-plan offices. Rather little is known on the effect a workplace layout (such as its openness) has on perceptions of staff regarding teamwork, focused work and perceived productivity. We aim to close this gap by taking a differential approach which appreciates detailed variations within open-plan offices. Not every corner of an office is the same, so the question arises whether satisfaction with workspace differs depending on where someone is sitting. Bringing results of a staff survey in the UK headquarters of a global technology company together with a detailed analysis of spatial qualities at desks based on isovist and visual field analysis, we find that staff are less likely to rate their workplace environment favorably when they have higher numbers of desks within their own field of vision; and when they are facing away from the room with a relatively larger area behind their back compared to the area surrounding them. Aspects of teamwork that are negatively affected include sharing information with others, as well as team identity and cohesion. Focused work (concentration) and working productively are impacted even more so with the largest effect sizes throughout. These findings highlight the relevance of investigating detailed spatial qualities of micro-locations in workplace layouts. Our results also raise important questions regarding the current popular practice in workplace design of providing large open-plan offices for technology companies.","Sailer, Kerstin; Koutsolampros, Petros; Pachilova, Rosica",PLoS One,726,29

Hereby, the most profitable medicines can be suggested. METHODS: The mesh terms of ""COVID‐19 drug treatment"" (Supplementary Concept) and ""COVID‐19 drug treatment"" were sequentially utilized as search strategies in Medline and Science direct on October 18, 2020. Searches were confined to systematic reviews/meta‐analyses. The Cochrane database was searched on November 1, 2020 with ""COVID."" With adding up four articles from other resources, 84 systematic reviews were considered for initial screening. Finally, 22 articles fulfilled the criteria and were assessed using PRISMA guidelines. RESULTS: Increasing number of clinical trials from the onset of the COVID‐19 pandemic has revealed that hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are not only profitable but also deleterious. Lopinavir/ritonavir failed to maintain their initial efficacy in improving clinical symptoms and mortality rate. Steroids and tocilizumab were suggested in patients with intensely severe symptoms. Steroids reduced mechanical ventilation and death in severely ill patients. Plasma or immunoglobulins effects are absolutely controversial. Favorable impressions of remdesivir have been relied on for the early onset of this drug. Hypotension and abnormal liver function tests were realized as its side effects. Favipiravir has resulted in a higher viral clearance than remdesivir. However, this claim needs to be proved with subsequent clinical trials. CONCLUSIONS: Currently, remdesivir and favipiravir are advantageous drugs that should be administered in the early phases. Their side effects are not well known and need to be found in the following research projects.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed the data published between March 6 and April 24, 2020, by the Instituto Nacional de Salud and the World Health Organization (WHO). We evaluated: i) the quality of the data according to the fulfillment of Benford's law, and ii) the timeliness of the information measured as the difference in dates between the data generated by the Instituto Nacional de Salud and WHO's situational reports. We assessed the fulfillment of Benford's law using the p values of the log-likelihood ratio, the chi square or Moreno's exact tests. RESULTS: Until April 24 there were 4,881 cases of COVID-19 in Colombia. During most of the first 50 days of the pandemic, Benford's law was fulfilled except the first days of the epidemic. The difference between Instituto Nacional de Salud and WHO reports largely depends on the different reporting times.

The most likely underlying mechanisms include virus-triggered overactivation of the immune system with hyperinflammation and cytokine storm but potentially also the development of specific autoantibodies against central nervous system (CNS) tissue. These were predominantly detected in the cerebrospinal fluid of severely ill coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. In contrast, direct damage after invasion of SARS-CoV‑2 into the brain and spinal cord does not seem to play a relevant role. Susceptibility to infection with SARS-CoV‑2 in patients with multiple sclerosis, myasthenia or other neuroimmunological diseases including the risk for severe disease courses, is not determined by the administered immunotherapy but by known risk factors, such as age, comorbidities and the disease-related degree of disability. Therefore, immunotherapy in these patients should not be delayed or discontinued. The contribution of neuroimmunological mechanisms to long-term sequelae after survival of a COVID-19 illness, such as fatigue, impairment of memory, sleep dysfunction or anxiety, will require long-term clinical follow-up, preferentially in COVID-19 register studies.","Skripuletz, Thomas; Möhn, Nora; Franke, Christiana; Prüß, Harald",Nervenarzt,726,10

A separate hexadecameric complex of nsp7 and nsp8 (8 copies of each) forms a large ring-like structure. Thus, nsp7 is an important component of several large protein complexes that are required for replication of the large and complex coronavirus genome. We here report the near-complete NMR backbone and sidechain resonance assignment ((1)H,(13)C,(15)N) of isolated nsp7 from SARS-CoV-2 in solution. Further, we derive the secondary structure and compare it to the previously reported assignments and structure of the SARS-CoV nsp7.","Tonelli, Marco; Rienstra, Chad; Anderson, Thomas K.; Kirchdoerfer, Rob; Henzler-Wildman, Katherine",Biomol NMR Assign,726,1

In response to the growing threat of the COVID-19 pandemic in February, 2020, the FDA (US Food and Drug Administration) began issuing Emergency Use Authorizations (EUAs) to laboratories and commercial manufacturers for the development and implementation of diagnostic tests1. So far, the gold standard assay for SARS-CoV-2 detection is the RT-qPCR (real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction) test2. However, the authorized RT-qPCR test protocols vary widely, not only in the reagents, controls, and instruments they use, but also in the SARS-CoV-2 genes they target, what results constitute a positive SARS-CoV-2 infection, and their limit of detection (LoD). The FDA has provided a web site that lists most of the tests that have been issued EUAs, along with links to the authorization letters and summary documents describing these tests1. However, it is very challenging to use this site to compare or replicate these tests for a variety of reasons. First, at least 12 of 18 tests for EUA submissions made prior to March 31, 2020, are not listed there. To our knowledge, no EUAs have been issued for these applications. Second, the data are not standardized and are only provided as longhand prose in the summary documents. Third, some details (e.g. primer sequences) are absent from several of the test descriptions. Fourth, for tests provided by commercial manufacturers, summary documents are completely missing. To address at least the first three issues, we have developed a database, EUAdb (EUAdb.org), that holds standardized information about EUA-issued tests and is focused on RT-qPCR diagnostic tests, or “high complexity molecular-based laboratory developed tests”1. By providing a standardized ontology and curated data in a relational architecture, we seek to facilitate comparability and reproducibility, with the ultimate goal of consistent, universal and high-quality testing nationwide. Here, we document the basics of the EUAdb data architecture and simple data queries. The source files can be provided to anyone who wants to modify the database for his/her own research purposes. We ask that the original source of the files be made clear and that the database not be used in its original or modified forms for commercial purposes.","Woronik, Alyssa; Shaffer, Henry W.; Kiontke, Karin; Laurent, Jon M.; Zambrano, Ronald; Boeke, Jef D.; Fitch, David H.

We adopted an Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model on the data collected from 31st January 2020 to 25th March 2020 and verified it using the data collected from 26th March 2020 to 04th April 2020. A nonlinear autoregressive (NAR) neural network is developed to compare the accuracy of predicted models. The model has been used for daily prediction of COVID-19 cases for next 50 days without any additional intervention. Statistics from various sources, including the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) and http://covid19india.org/ are used for the study. The results showed an increasing trend in the actual and forecasted numbers of COVID-19 cases with approximately 1500 cases per day, based on available data as on 04th April 2020. The appropriate ARIMA (1,1,0) model was selected based on the Bayesian Information Criteria (BIC) values and the overall highest R2 values of 0.95. The NAR model architecture constitutes ten neurons, which is optimized using the Levenberg-Marquardt optimization training algorithm (LM) with the overall highest R2 values of 0.97.","Khan, Farhan Mohammad; Gupta, Rajiv",,726,16

The management of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) across the world has been modified according to the scarcity of care resources that have been diverted mostly to face the surge of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Oncological and hepatobiliary societies have drafted recommendations regarding the adaptation of guidelines for the management of HCC to the current healthcare situation. This review focuses on specific recommendations for the surgical treatment of HCC (i.e., hepatic resection and liver transplantation), which still represents the best chance of cure for patients with very early and early HCC. While surgery should be pursued for very selected patients in institutions where standards of care are maintained, alternative or bridging methods, mostly thermoablation and transarterial therapies, can be used until surgery can be performed. The prognosis of patients with HCC largely depends on both the characteristics of the tumour and the stage of underlying liver disease. Risk stratification plays a pivotal role in determining the most appropriate treatment for each case and needs to balance the chance of cure and the risk of COVID-19 infection during hospitalization. Current recommendations have been critically reviewed to provide a reference for best practices in the clinical setting, with adaptation based on pandemic trends and categorization according to COVID-19 prevalence.","Fancellu, Alessandro; Sanna, Valeria; Scognamillo, Fabrizio; Feo, Claudio F; Vidili, Gianpaolo; Nigri, Giuseppe; Porcu, Alberto",World J Clin Cases,726,33

It is unknown whether such skills transfer to clinical settings. The aims of this review are: 1. to determine if simulation training translates to improved surgical performance by Obstetric/Gynecology (OBGYN) trainees in operative settings; 2. to determine impact of simulation on clinical outcomes. Design MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane, ERIC, and Psychinfo databases were searched through October 2019 to identify studies evaluating the use of simulation among OBGYN trainees. Studies were included if they assessed trainees’ skills in real surgical cases by objective measure after implementation of simulation training. Studies assessing only simulator performance were excluded. Setting N/A Patients or Participants OBGYN trainees. Interventions Simulation training. Measurements and Main Results 457 abstracts were screened and 16 included in the final analysis. Most studies used an Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skills (OSAT) or modified version during laparoscopic salpingectomy or tubal ligation. Ten studies found performance improvement after simulation training. Fewer studies assessed impact on clinical outcomes. Of these, half noted a decrease in operative time with simulation. Length of stay was found to significantly decrease; however, no significant difference in other clinical outcomes was noted following simulation. Most trainees reported satisfaction and self-perceived increase in surgical skills following simulation training. Conclusion This is the first systematic review to evaluate the translation of gynecologic surgical skills to the operating room following simulation training. Skills developed through simulation appear to be transferable to the operating room. More numerous studies are needed to better assess effects on clinical outcomes and whether findings hold true with increasing case complexity.","Helou, C.

By the end of the year more than seventy-seven million cases of COVID-19 had been reported around the globe. Due to it being a highly contagious disease, the recommended measures adopted by most nations to prevent infection include social distancing and quarantine. How did these measures affect people's relationship with alcohol consumption in cultures where alcohol plays an important social role? A questionnaire-based study, designed to follow the drinking behaviour of people before and during lockdown was applied to two different cultural groups impacted by the pandemic during the strict phase of lockdown. These are the British and Spanish populations (179 participants from each country were interviewed). Considering the frequency of consumption of the alcoholic beverages evaluated (wine, beer, cider, whisky and spirits), the results showed that a significant lockdown*country interaction was observed. Overall, Spanish participants consumed alcoholic beverages less frequently during lockdown than before, while British participants reported no change in their consumption habits. Spaniards’ decrease in alcohol consumption is related to the absence of a social contexts while Britons seems to have adapted their consumption to the modified context. Results suggest that, alcohol consumption is a central core of the British culture, while for the Spanish, socialization is more a cultural characteristic than the alcohol itself.","Rodrigues, Heber; Valentin, Dominique; Franco-Luesma, Ernesto; Ramaroson Rakotosamimanana, Vonimihaingo; Gomez-Corona, Carlos; Saldaña, Erick; Sáenz-Navajas, María-Pilar",Food Qual Prefer,726,26

We herein summarize the clinical and radiological characteristics of 90 confirmed cases and analyze their role in predicting the evolution to fibrosis. Methods We retrospectively analyzed the clinical and radiological data of 90 patients with COVID-19 pneumonitis. All subjects underwent an HRCT study on the day of admission and 8 weeks later, and were treated with lopinavir + ritonavir (Kaletra) 400/100 mg 2 times a day or darunavir + ritonavir 2 times a day, and Hydroxychloroquine 200 mg 2 times a day. Pulmonary fibrosis was defined according to the Fleischner Society glossary of terms for thoracic imaging. Results Twenty- three patients developed pulmonary fibrosis (25.5%): 15 were males, whose mean age was 75 ± 15 years. The majority were active smokers (60.8%) and had comorbidities (78.2%), above all hypertension (47.8%) and diabetes (34.7%). Interestingly, in our series of cases “reversed halo sign” is frequent (63%) and seems to be a typical pattern of COVID-19 pneumonitis. The group of patients showing fibrosis had a higher grade of systemic inflammation (ESR and PCR), and appeared to have a bone marrow inhibition with a significant reduction in platelets, leukocytes and hemoglobin. Conclusions To conclude, our data showed that reversed halo sign associated with ground glass pattern may be a typical HRCT pattern of COVID-19 pneumonitis. The evolution to pulmonary fibrosis is frequent in older males and in patients with comorbidities and bone marrow involvement.","Marvisi, Maurizio; Ferrozzi, Francesco; Balzarini, Laura; Mancini, Chiara; Ramponi, Sara; Uccelli, Mario",Int J Infect Dis,726,23

Our results showed that domestic dogs are potential shedder of three important pathogens: Canine distemper virus, Toxoplasma sp. and Neospora caninum. In particular, shepherd dogs seem to represent a threat for wildlife as they are exposed to multiple pathogens because of free-roaming, scavenging lifestyles and close proximity to livestock. However, also companion dogs more subject to veterinary care may foster the spread of pathogens.

There are few studies on the clinical characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children, and the causes of the low prevalence in children remain unclear. Herein, we compared the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 infection between adults and children. Fifty-two patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) were retrospectively analyzed, including 38 adults and 14 children. Their clinical information such as epidemiological exposure history, laboratory indicators, chest computed tomography (CT) performance, and number of SARS-CoV-2 positive days were analyzed and compared. In children, 5 (35.71%) had mild COVID-19 and 9 (64.29%) had common type, while, in adults, 9 (23.68%) cases were mild, and 29 (76.32%) were common COVID-19. Among them, family clustering infection accounted for 50% (7/14) of child cases and 23.68% (9/36) of adult cases. Epidemiological exposure history, clinical classification, clinical symptoms, chest CT manifestations, and number of SARS-CoV-2-positive days were not significantly different between children and adults. However, the percentage of neutrophils in adults was significantly higher than that in children (P < 0.05). The percentage and absolute value of lymphocytes, platelet counts, aspartate aminotransferase, and aspartate aminotransferase/alanine aminotransferase in adults were lower than those in children (P < 0.05). Conclusively, children infected with SARS-CoV-2 show the characteristics of family clustering, and the proportion of mild and asymptomatic infections is higher. For families with a history of epidemiological exposure, routine SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid testing and chest CT examination should be performed in asymptomatic children to determine whether they are infected. Unlike adults, although the reduction of lymphocytes and platelets in children is not common, it is necessary to be alert to the increased risk of liver damage in children.","Li, Xiaoli; Rong, Yan; Zhang, Peiyan; Wang, Junli; Qie, Liping; Rong, Lei; Xu, Jian",Biomed Res Int,726,24

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Low-density paper was used as substrate material for inkjet printing with potassium iodide solution to reproduce phantoms that mimic the CT attenuation of lung parenchyma. The relationship between grayscale values and the corresponding CT numbers of prints was first established through the derivation of exponential fitted equation from scanning data. Next, chest CTs from patients with early-stage lung cancer and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia were chosen for 3D printing. CT images of original lung nodule and the 3D-printed nodule phantom were compared based on pixel-to-pixel correlation and radiomic features. RESULTS: CT images of part-solid lung cancer and 3D-printed nodule phantom showed both high visual similarity and quantitative correlation. R2 values from linear regressions of pixel-to-pixel correlations between 5 sets of patient and 3D-printed image pairs were 0.92, 0.94, 0.86, 0.85, and 0.83, respectively. Comparison of radiomic measures between clinical CT and printed models demonstrated 6.1% median difference, with 25th and 75th percentile range at 2.4% and 15.2% absolute difference, respectively. The densities and parenchymal morphologies from COVID-19 pneumonia CT images were well reproduced in the 3D-printed phantom scans.

In the majority of patients, ground glass opacities on chest radiographs progress rapidly to focal, multifocal or diffuse consolidation. Unilateral involvement is common in the early acute phase, becoming bilateral at maximal lung involvement. Generally, radiographic opacities peak between 8 and 10 days after onset of illness, with radiographic scores reflecting temporal changes in clinical and laboratory parameters such as oxygen saturation (SaO(2)) and liver transaminases. Pleural effusions, cavitating consolidation and mediastinal lymphadenopathy are not typical radiographic features. Pneumomediastinum and pneumothoraces are complications that are associated with extensive disease, with or without assisted ventilation. The utility of high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) and CT scans lies in the confirmation of airspace opacities in cases with normal initial chest radiographs that have strong contact history and signs and symptoms highly suspicious of SARS during the outbreak, allowing early treatment and prompt isolation. The characteristic HRCT feature in the acute phase is ground‐glass opacities with smooth interlobular septal thickening, sometimes with consolidation in a subpleural location, which progress rapidly to involve other areas of the lungs. Temporal lung changes documented on HRCT suggest that some residual opacities found may not be reversible.","OOI, Gaik Cheng; DAQING, Ma",Respirology,726,29

Several clinical studies have provided evidence for the antiviral effects of type I interferons (IFNs) in patients with respiratory coronaviruses. This study assessed the therapeutic efficacy of IFN-alpha 2b in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 during the first month after the outbreak began in Cuba. Method This multicenter prospective observational study was conducted in 16 hospitals in 8 Cuban provinces. Participants were patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection detected from throat swab specimens by real time RT-PCR who gave informed consent and had no contraindications for IFN treatment. Patients received therapy as per the Cuban COVID protocol, that included a combination of oral antivirals (lopinavir/ritonavir and chloroquine) with intramuscular administration of IFN-alpha 2b (Heberon Alpha R, Center for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, Havana), 3 times per week, for 2 weeks. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients discharged from hospital (without clinical and radiological symptoms and non-detectable virus by RT-PCR). The secondary endpoint was the case fatality rate (CFR), defined as the number of confirmed deaths divided by the number of confirmed cases. Results From March 11th to April 14th, 814 patients were confirmed SARS-CoV-2 positive in Cuba, 761 (93.4%) were treated with Heberon Alpha R and 53 received the approved protocol without IFN treatment. The proportion of fully recovered patients was higher in the IFN-treated compared with non-IFN treated group (95.4% vs 26.1%, p<0.01). The CFR for all patients was 2.95%, and for those patients who received IFN-alpha 2b the CFR was reduce to 0.92. The estimated global CFR is 6.34% and 4.05% for the Americas reported by WHO and PAHO, respectively. In this study, 82 patients (10.1%) required intensive care and, of these, 42 (5.5%) were treated with IFN. Conclusions This report provides preliminary evidence for the therapeutic effectiveness of IFN alpha-2b for COVID-19 and suggests that the use of Heberon Alpha R may contribute to complete recovery.","Pereda, R.; Gonzalez, D.; Rivero, H.; Rivero, J.; Perez, A.; Lopez, L. d.

Military-connected families with 3- to 6-year-old children (194 mothers; 155 fathers; 199 children) were randomized to FOCUS-EC or an online education condition. Parent psychological health symptoms, child behavior, parenting, and parent–child relationships were examined by parent-report and observed interaction tasks for up to 12 months. Longitudinal regression models indicated that FOCUS-EC families demonstrated significantly greater improvements than online education families in parent-reported and observational measures of child behavior, parenting practices, and parent–child interaction, as well as greater reductions in parent posttraumatic stress symptoms. Findings provide support for the benefit of a virtually-delivered preventive intervention for military-connected families.","Mogil, Catherine; Hajal, Nastassia; Aralis, Hilary; Paley, Blair; Milburn, Norweeta G.; Barrera, Wendy; Kiff, Cara; Beardslee, William; Lester, Patricia",Child Psychiatry Hum Dev,726,23

To address the specific antibody targets that were affected by recent viral variants, we generated 43 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) from 10 convalescent donors that bound three distinct domains of the SARS-CoV-2 spike. Viral variants harboring mutations at K417, E484 and N501 could escape most of the highly potent antibodies against the receptor binding domain (RBD). Despite this, we identified 12 neutralizing mAbs against three distinct regions of the spike protein that neutralize SARS-CoV-2 and the variants of concern, including B.1.1.7 (alpha), P.1 (gamma) and B.1.617.2 (delta). Notably, antibodies targeting distinct epitopes could neutralize discrete variants, suggesting different variants may have evolved to disrupt the binding of particular neutralizing antibody classes. These results underscore that humans exposed to wildtype (WT) SARS-CoV-2 do possess neutralizing antibodies against current variants and that it is critical to induce antibodies targeting multiple distinct epitopes of the spike that can neutralize emerging variants of concern.","Wilson, Patrick; Changrob, Siriruk; Fu, Yanbin; Guthmiller, Jenna; Halfmann, Peter; Li, Lei; Stamper, Christopher; Dugan, Haley; Accola, Molly; Rehrauer, William; Zheng, Nai-Ying; Huang, Min; Wang, Jiaolong; Erickson, Steven; Utset, Henry; Graves, Hortencia; Amanat, Fatima; Sather, D.

METHODS AND RESULTS: We evaluated the clinical course of eight COVID‐19 patients, including their duration of viral shedding, by PCR testing of nasopharyngeal swabs. The average time from the onset of symptoms until the virus was no longer detectable was 31.6 ± 11.8 days (mean ± SD; range 17‐53). Thus, it took 15.1 ± 14.7 (1‐40) days from the time of clinical recovery for the virus to become undetectable. In two patients who had mental retardation and psychiatric disorders, the viral shedding period continued for 44 days or 53 days. These two patients did not voluntarily brush their teeth. When they were instructed on the importance of oral care, including tooth brushing and gargling, their tests for the coronavirus became negative. CONCLUSION: Most of the patients with COVID‐19 had a viral shedding period of 30 days or less. In cases of prolonged viral shedding (≥44 days), noninfectious viral nucleic acid may have accumulated in uncleaned oral cavities and continued to be detected. We propose that tooth brushing and gargling remove such viral nucleic acid and improve the accuracy of PCR testing.","Warabi, Yoko; Tobisawa, Shinsuke; Kawazoe, Tomoya; Murayama, Aki; Norioka, Ryohei; Morishima, Ryo; Inoue, Tomoyuki; Shimizu, Toshio; Takahashi, Kazushi",Spec Care Dentist,726,16

Efforts have concentrated on managing this crisis, with impact on cancer care unclear. We investigated the impact on endoscopy services and gastrointestinal (GI) cancer diagnosis in the UK. DESIGN: Analysis of endoscopy procedures and cancer diagnosis at a UK Major General Hospital. Procedure rates and diagnosis of GI malignancy were examined over 8-week periods in spring, summer and autumn 2019 before the start of the crisis and were compared with rates since onset of national lockdown and restrictions on elective endoscopy. The number of CT scans performed and malignancies diagnosed in the two corresponding periods in 2019 and 2020 were also evaluated. RESULTS: 2 698 2516 and 3074 endoscopic procedures were performed in 2019, diagnosing 64, 73 and 78 cancers, respectively, the majority being in patients with alarm symptoms and fecal immunochemical test+ve bowel cancer screening population. Following initiation of new guidelines for management of endoscopy services 245 procedures were performed in a 6 week duration, diagnosing 18 cancers. This equates to potentially delayed diagnosis of 37 cancers per million population per month. Clinician triage improved, resulting in 13.6 procedures performed to diagnose one cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate an 88% reduction in procedures during the first 6 weeks of COVID-19 crisis, resulting in 66% fewer GI cancer diagnoses. Triage changes reduced the number of procedures required to diagnose cancer. Our data can help healthcare planning to manage the extra workload on endoscopy departments during the recovery period from COVID-19.","Longcroft-Wheaton, Gaius; Tolfree, Natalie; Gangi, Anmol; Beable, Richard; Bhandari, Pradeep",Frontline Gastroenterol,726,16

Methods: Etiologic agents were identified in a case-control study: cases were HIV-infected patients with diarrhea (HIV+ D+) and HIV seronegative patients with diarrhea (HIV− D+); controls were HIV-infected patients without diarrhea (HIV+ D−) and seronegative controls without diarrhea (HID− D−). Ordinary enteric pathogens were identified by conventional methods. Different Escherichia coli pathotypes were characterized by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), identification of HEp-2 cell adherence pattern, Sereny test, GIvl1-ELISA, and the suckling mouse assay. Opportunistic parasites, such as Cryptosporidium and Microsporidium, were identified by the Kinyoun method and trichromic stain of Weber, respectively. Rotaviruses were identified with a commercial latex agglutination kit. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was carried out by the disk diffusion method. Results: Among the 594 patients examined, 158 were HIV+ D+, 121 were HIV− D+, 160 were HIV+ D−, and 155 were HIV− D−. The main etiologies of diarrhea were different according to HIV serostatus of patients. In immunocompetent adults the main causes of diarrhea were Shigella sp (12.4%), Entamoeba histolytica (10.7%), Salmonella enterica (6.6%), and Giardia (4.9%). In the immunocompromised host the more frequent pathogens were enteroaggregative E. coli (19.6%), Microsporidium (9.4%), Cryptosporidium sp (8.2%), Rotavirus (8.2%), Shigella sp (7.6%), Candida albicans (7.6%), E. histolytica (5.1%), S. enterica (4.4%), and Isospora belli (4.4%). Also, Blastocystis hominis has to be considered as an opportunistic parasite, because it was identified only in HIV-infected patients, with higher prevalence in adults with diarrhea (2.5% in HIV+ D+ patients; 0.6% in HIV+ D− patients). High level of asymptomatic carriage of Ascaris lumbricoides and Trichuris trichiura and some cases of multiple infections were observed. Fungi, Cryptosporidium sp and Microsporidium sp, were often identified in patients with low CD4 counts (range, 79–250 cells/mL). Independently from HIV-serostatus, CD4 count was lower in diarrheic persons, suggesting that diarrhea is a debilitating illness and that effective management of diarrhea can prevent immunosuppression. Isolated enteropathogenic strains displayed high resistance to most antibiotics used in Senegal for treating diarrhea (ampicillin, tetracycline, cotrimoxazole); they were susceptible to amikacin, gentamicin, and norfloxacin. Conclusion: These epidemiologic data suggest that guidelines for the management of diarrhea during HIV infection in Dakar should be updated.","Gassama, Amy; Sow, Papa Salif; Fall, Fatou; Camara, Pathé; Philippe, Hovette; Guèye-N'diaye, Aïssatou; Seng, Rémonie; Samb, Badara; M'Boup, Souleymane; Germani, Yves; Aïdara-Kane, Awa",International Journal of Infectious Diseases,726,16

The N1 region of the SARS-CoV-2 genome was used to quantify the viral load in the wastewater using RT-qPCR. The trend in Ct values in the wastewater samples mirrored the number of new daily positive cases officially reported for the country, confirmed by RT-qPCR testing of naso-pharyngeal swabs. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in 100% of the influent wastewater samples (7,889 ± 1,421 copy/L – 542,056 ± 25,775 copy/L, based on the N1 assay). A mathematical model for wastewater-based epidemiology was developed and used to estimate the number of people in the population infected with COVID-19 from the N1 Ct values in the wastewater samples. The estimated number of infected people in the population on any given day using the wastewater-based epidemiology approach declined from 542,313 ± 51,159 to 31,181 ± 3,081 over the course of the sampling period, which was significantly higher than the officially reported numbers. However, seroprevalence data from Qatar indicates that diagnosed infections represented only about 10% of actual cases. The model estimates were lower than the corrected numbers based on application of a static diagnosis ratio of 10% to the RT-qPCR identified cases, which is assumed to be due to the difficulty in quantifying RNA losses as a model term. However, these results indicate that the presented WBE modelling approach allows for realistic assessment of incidence trend in a given population, with a more reliable estimation of the number of infected people in a population at any given point in time than can be achieved using human biomonitoring alone.","Saththasivam, Jayaprakash; El-Malah, Shimaa S.; Gomez, Tricia A.; Jabbar, Khadeeja Abdul; Remanan, Reshma; Arun, K.

Alternatives such as serological diagnosis and maintenance of HPVs in culture are neither clinically useful nor consistently feasible. Novel HPV isolates have traditionally been described as “types”. The analysis of specific HPV types is of medical importance, because HPV types typically induce type-specific lesions, i.e. they may be specific for cutaneous or mucosal epithelia, or give rise to benign warts or malignant carcinomas. Recently, it was formally decided that papillomaviruses are a virus family separate from the polyomaviruses. Within the papillomavirus family, closely or remotely related types form species or genera. These formal agreements were important as they brought the taxonomy of papillomaviruses in line with that of other viruses, bacteria and higher organisms, although their impact on medical practice and terminology used in clinical studies is limited. Notably, however, HPV types that are closely related (i.e. form “species”) are associated with similar lesions. Confusion of the terms “type” and “subtype” should be avoided, as the latter term refers to some specific but rare taxonomic assemblages. In contrast to many RNA viruses, HPV types evolve very slowly, and diverged since the origin of humans only by about 2%. These divergent isolates are called “variants”. HPVs evolved together with humankind and Homo sapiens was never without HPVs, and consequently never without warts and cervical cancer. Variants of the same HPV type may have different pathogenicity and may account for part of the worldwide disparities in the occurrence of genital cancers.","Bernard, Hans-Ulrich",J Clin Virol,726,16

Genetic evidences indicated that imported SARS- CoV-2 (belong to the lineage B1.1.29) initiated this outbreak. However, the transmission route of the virus is still unknown. We obtained from public database three SARS-CoV-2 genomes isolated in XFD (XFD genomes) and adopted the leaf-dating method to calculate their expected collection dates using temporal calibrating information from other 241 genomes collected in mainland of China. All three XFD genomes were calculated to have earlier collection dates than the recorded (Bayes factor >1), and hence exhibited a lack of genetic divergence. We additionally combined the XFD genomes with other 225 genomes subsampled from those of the lineage B1.1.29, among which five sequences were also included for control analysis. Two of three XFD genomes were calculated to have earlier collection dates than the recorded (Bayes factor >1), while no control genomes provided such evidence. According to present understanding of SARS-CoV-2, a lack of genetic divergence is most likely due to being frozen. Considering the fact that the XFD outbreak started from a booth of frozen food, we judged that the XFD outbreak was caused by contaminated frozen food. Our results provided molecular evidence for the source of COVID-19 outbreak in Beijing XFD, which highlights new targets for SARS-CoV-2 surveillance for the public health.","ZHANG, Y.; Liang, M.; LI, Y.; Ma, X.; ZHOU, X.",,726,16

Results A total of 73 studies with 21,350 COVID-19 cases were identified. CS use was widely reported in mechanically ventilated (35.3%), ICU (51.3%) and severe COVID-19 cases (40%). CS showed mortality benefit in severelly ill COVID-19 cases (OR 0.65, 95%CI 0.51-0.83, P=0.0006), however, no beneficial or harmful effects were noted amongst high- or low-dose CS regimens. Emerging evidence shows that low-dose CS do not have a significant impact in the duration of SARS-CoV-2 viral shedding. The analysis was limited by highly heterogeneous literature for high- and low-dose CS regimens. Interpretation Our results show evidence of mortality benefit in severely-ill COVID-19 treated with CS.

Published studies on reduction of SARS-CoV-2-induced cytotoxic effects by antiseptics do not exclude antiseptic-associated cytotoxicity. Here, we determined the effect of commercially available mouth rinses and antiseptic povidone-iodine on the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 virus and of a non-pathogenic, recombinant, SARS-CoV-2 infection vector (pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 virus). We first determined the effect of mouth rinses on cell viability to ensure that antiviral activity was not a consequence of mouth rinse-induced cytotoxicity. Colgate Peroxyl (hydrogen peroxide) exhibited the most cytotoxicity, followed by povidone-iodine, chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG), and Listerine (essential oils and alcohol). Potent anti-viral activities of povidone iodine and Colgate peroxyl mouth rinses was the consequence of rinse-mediated cellular damage. The potency of CHG was greater when the product was not washed off after virus attachment, suggesting that the prolonged effect of mouth rinses on cells impacts anti-viral activity. To minimalize mouth rinse-associated cytotoxicity, mouth rinse was largely removed from treated-viruses by centrifugation prior to infection of cells. A 5% (v/v) dilution of Colgate Peroxyl or povidone-iodine completely blocked viral infectivity. A similar 5% (v/v) dilution of Listerine or CHG had a moderate suppressive effect on the virus, but a 50% (v/v) dilution of Listerine or CHG blocked viral infectivity completely. Prolonged incubation of virus with mouth rinses was not required for viral inactivation. Our results indicate that mouth rinses can significantly reduce virus infectivity, suggesting a potential benefit for reducing SARS-CoV-2 spread. Importance SARS-CoV-2 is detectable in saliva from asymptomatic individuals, suggesting the potential necessity for the use of mouth rinses to suppress viral load to reduce virus spread. Published studies on anti-SARS-CoV-2 activities of antiseptics determined by virus-induced cytotoxic effects cannot exclude antiseptic-associated cytotoxicity. We found that all mouth rinses tested inactivated SARS-CoV-2 viruses. Listerine and CHG were less cytotoxic than Colgate Peroxyl or povidone-iodine and were active against the virus. When mouth rinses were present in the cell culture during the infection, the potent anti-viral effect of mouth rinses were in part due to the mouth rinse-associated cytotoxicity. Our results suggest that assessing anti-viral candidates including mouth rinses with minimal potential disruption of cells may help identify active agents that can reduce SARS-CoV-2 spread.","Xu, Chuan; Wang, Annie; Hoskin, Eileen R.; Cugini, Carla; Markowitz, Kenneth; Chang, Theresa L.; Fine, Daniel H.",bioRxiv,726,6

Here, we hypothesized that the high levels of the inflammatory cytokine Angiopoietin-2 (ANGPT2) reported in hospitalized COVID-19 patients might promote hypercoagulation through ANGPT2 binding to thrombomodulin with resulting inhibition of thrombin/thrombomodulin-mediated physiological anticoagulation. We therefore investigated plasma samples taken at two timepoints from 20 critically ill COVID-19 patients in intensive care regarding ANGPT2 levels and coagulation markers in comparison with 20 healthy blood donors. We found that ANGPT2 levels were increased in the COVID-19 patients in correlation with disease severity, hypercoagulation, and mortality. To test causality, we administered ANGPT2 to wildtype mice and found that it shortened bleeding time in a tail injury model. In further support of a role for ANGPT2 in physiological coagulation, bleeding time was increased in endothelial-specific Angpt2 knockout mice. Using in vitro assays, we found that ANGPT2 inhibited thrombomodulin-mediated anticoagulation and protein C activation in human donor plasma. Our data reveal a novel mechanism for ANGPT2 in hypercoagulation and suggest that Angiopoietin-2 inhibition may be tested in the treatment of hypercoagulation in severe COVID-19, as well as in certain other conditions, including sepsis.","Hultstrom, M.; Fromell, K.; Larsson, A.; Quaggin, S.

As countries have implemented these interventions, aggregated location data from mobile phones have become an important source of real-time information about human mobility and behavioral changes on a population level. Human activity measured using mobile phones reflects the aggregate behavior of a subset of people, and although metrics of mobility are related to contact patterns between people that spread the coronavirus, they do not provide a direct measure. In this study, we use results from a nowcasting approach from 1,396 counties across the US between January 22nd, 2020 and July 9th, 2020 to determine the effective reproductive number (R(t)) along an urban/rural gradient. For each county, we compare the time series of R(t) values with mobility proxies from mobile phone data from Camber Systems, an aggregator of mobility data from various providers in the United States. We show that the reproduction number is most strongly associated with mobility proxies for change in the travel into counties compared to baseline, but that the relationship weakens considerably after the initial 15 weeks of the epidemic, consistent with the emergence of a more complex ecosystem of local policies and behaviors including masking.

Given the prevalence of insufficient PA among children, promoting and providing PA opportunities during the school day, especially when integrated into the curriculum and linked to the learning standards, is essential for children. The purpose of this paper is to describe the procedure for the development of a school-based PA program using an integrated approach through the modified intervention mapping protocol (IMP). A total of 22 physical education teachers and 167 children from five different elementary schools were involved in the process. The procedure includes the Self-Determination Theory (SDT) that provides a theoretical framework that plays a vital role in motivating students to have a physically active lifestyle. This study applied SDT and IMP to develop and pilot a PA intervention called Project SMART using an integrative community participatory approach. As a pilot PA intervention, Project SMART is an online educational game where the students navigate a virtual journey across the United States A class’s aggregate PA propels the students on their journey, where standards-based modules are unlocked to achieve STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) and social-emotional learning outcomes while gaining an understanding of the importance of health behaviors and opportunities to habitually engage in healthy decision-making with the support of their peers. Although initially labor intensive for the researchers, the process of tailoring the intervention to the children’s contextual and cultural needs has implications for all theoretically grounded and evidence-based PA interventions.","Jung, Yeonhak; Burson, Sheri L.; Julien, Christine; Bray, Dylan F.; Castelli, Darla M.",Front Psychol,726,17

This case study evaluated information in the popular social media platform YouTube about two key interventions (namely, ‘social distancing’ and ‘hand washing’) recommended during coronavirus disease-2019. Using the keywords ‘social distancing’ and ‘hand washing’, 77 and 78 videos, respectively, were selected from YouTube through pre-defined criteria. The understandability, actionability and quality of information in these videos were assessed. Cumulatively, the social distancing videos received >9 million views and the hand-washing videos received >37 million views. Thirteen social distancing videos (16.9%) and 46 hand-washing videos (58.9%) provided understandable, actionable and good-quality information. The non-understandable, non-actionable or poor-quality videos had paradoxically more viewer engagements than the understandable, actionable or good-quality videos, respectively. Most social distancing videos came from news agencies (68.8%). Hand-washing videos were mostly uploaded by health agencies or academic institutes (52.6%). The videos were less likely to be understandable and actionable and to be of good quality when uploaded by sources other than health agencies or academic institutes. The paucity of adequate information and the limited representation of ‘authoritative’ sources were concerning. Strategies for harnessing social media as an effective medium for public health education are necessary during pandemics.","Bora, Kaustubh; Pagdhune, Avinash; Patgiri, Saurav Jyoti; Barman, Bhupen; Das, Dulmoni; Borah, Probodh",Health Educ Res,726,9

DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 57 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were admitted to two clinical centers, and data were analyzed retrospectively. Among them, 18 patients with body mass index (BMI) ≥ 25 kg/m(2) were diagnosed with obesity, and dynamics of viral replication were compared. RESULTS: Eighteen patients were diagnosed with obesity. The correlations between BMI and white blood cell, C-reactive protein, and cycle threshold (Ct) values of ORF1ab were not significant (all P > 0.05). On day 7 after admission, virus clearance was achieved in 13 (33.3%) patients with BMI < 25 kg/m(2) and 5 (27.8%) patients with BMI ≥ 25 kg/m(2) (χ(2) = 0.176, P =0.68). On day 14, the RNA tests were negative in 37 (94.9%) patients with BMI < 25 kg/m(2) and 13 (72.2%) patients with BMI ≥ 25 kg/m(2) (χ(2) = 5.865, P = 0.03). Multivariable analysis showed that only BMI ≥ 25 kg/m(2) (P = 0.02) was the independent risk factor for virus clearance on day 14. CONCLUSION: Obesity may affect the clearance of SARS-CoV-2, and BMI should be assessed in patients with COVID-19, although they are not seriously ill.","Zhang, Xiujun; Lin, Bin; Yang, Gang; Liu, Longgen; Lu, Jianchun; Lu, Zhaohui; Xue, Yuan",Infect Drug Resist,726,29

Nous rapportons une première observation de démodécidose localisée au niveau du cuir chevelu apparue en post infection par le coronavirus SARS-COV-2. Observation Un patient âgé de 45 ans, sans antécédents médicaux particuliers, s’est présenté à la consultation de dermatologie pour une lésion du cuir chevelu apparue 10jours après une infection par le coronavirus SARS-COV-2 confirmée par réaction de polymérisation en chaîne (PCR). À l’examen, le patient présentait une plaque érythémateuse papuleuse localisée au niveau de la région occipitale du scalp avec une légère raréfaction des cheveux. L’examen histopathologique montrait un épiderme surmonté d’une hyperkératose orthokératosique avec une hyperpigmentation de sa basale et la plupart des follicules pileux renfermaient des demodex. Il s’y associait au niveau du derme un infiltrat inflammatoire de siège péri-pilaire et périvasculaire fait essentiellement de lymphocytes. En se basant sur les signes cliniques et l’histopathologie, le diagnostic de démodécidose du cuir chevelu a été retenu. Le patient a été traité par métronidazole topique avec une nette amélioration de sa lésion. Discussion Nous rapportons une localisation exceptionnelle de démodécidose chez un sujet immunocompétent apparue en post COVID-19, maladie ayant entrainé plusieurs manifestations dermatologiques telles que des éruptions érythémato-papuleuses, morbilliformes ou pseudo-urticariennes. Aussi, plusieurs cas d’engelures, de manifestations vasculaires, livédoïdes et des vascularites purpuriques ont été rapportés. Ces manifestations dermatologiques sont expliquées par la réaction immune induite et par une microvascularopathie. D’autres dermatoses à type de dermites séborrhéiques, pelade et effluvium télogène causées par le stress dans le contexte de la maladie COVID-19 ont été rapportées. À notre connaissance, une démodécidose du cuir chevelu en post infection par le coronavirus n’a pas été décrite auparavant. La démodécidose est une ectoparasitose secondaire à une forte infestation du follicule pileux par le demodex, un parasite commensal de l’unité pilosébacée, se manifestant typiquement par une dermatose faciale. L’immunodéficience semble créer un environnement favorable pour le développement du parasite. Une démodécidose du cuir chevelu est rare et n’a été décrite que chez des sujets immunodéprimés ou sous des traitements immunosuppresseurs. Dans notre cas, les perturbations de la réponse immunitaire de l’hôte inhérentes au SARS-COV-2 peuvent expliquer cette localisation atypique de démodécidose. Conclusion Cette observation souligne l’importance de reconnaître les manifestations cutanées liées à la maladie COVID-19 étant donné leur variabilité. Des études cliniques sont essentielles pour préciser les mécanismes physiopathologiques de ces manifestations et éventuellement prédire l’évolution de la maladie.","Lahouel, I.; Saïd El Mabrouk, R.; Hadhri, R.; Daada, S.; Youssef, M.; Belhadjali, H.; Zili, J.",La Revue de Médecine Interne,726,26

Indeed, the present COVID-19 pandemic has created unprecedented disruption in social interactions and working conditions. Malaysia has been under the Recovery Movement Control Order since June 2020; however, with the upsurge of cases, healthcare workers face pressure not only from working in resource-deprived settings but also from the increasing patient load. The primary objective of the present study was to examine the cross-sectional relationship of COVID-19 fear and stress to psychological distress (operationalized as anxiety and depression) in healthcare workers. The present sample included 286 frontline healthcare workers from three hospitals in Selangor, Malaysia. Self-administered questionnaires containing sociodemographic and occupational items, the Malay versions of the Coronavirus Stress Measure scale, the Fear of Coronavirus-19 scale, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 were distributed via online platforms. Hierarchical multiple regression findings suggest that age, shift work, and COVID-19 stress consistently predicted anxiety and depression among frontline healthcare workers after adjusting for sociodemographic and occupational variables. The present findings suggest that frontline healthcare workers are not only inoculated against COVID-19 itself but also against the psychological sequelae of the pandemic.","Subhas, Natasha; Pang, Nicholas Tze-Ping; Chua, Wei-Cheng; Kamu, Assis; Ho, Chong-Mun; David, Isabel Shamini; Goh, William Wei-Liang; Gunasegaran, Yogaraja Indran; Tan, Kit-Aun",Int J Environ Res Public Health,726,20

Research questions addressed relational processes in virtual video groups, including emotional presence, interpersonal communication, and intimacy. Specifically, we asked how facilitators can intervene effectively to promote these processes in the virtual space, within the context of social distancing. Semi-structured group interviews were held with 26 female group facilitators from various professional backgrounds during the first wave of COVID-19 in Israel in May 2020. Phenomenological analysis yielded five main themes addressing dialectical tensions that operate simultaneously in the virtual space, both enabling and hindering relational processes in virtual video groups: intimacy and intrusion in the domestic space; sharp transitions from presence to absence; fragmented processing despite abundant information; sterility and clarity in group communication; and the hyper-aware self – being a participant and an observer at the same time. Moving groups into a virtual sphere challenged the traditional role of facilitators, who struggled to create a safe space in an unstable virtual setting where the boundaries between personal and professional lives were reduced. Findings also point to the potential of the domestic space to promote closeness and intimacy and suggest the virtual space requires facilitators to embrace multiplicity as a state of mind when intervening. Facilitators must work with permeable boundaries between inner and outer group spaces, accept discontinuity as a basic property of the virtual, and acknowledge the limitations caused by multiple stimuli.","Ben-David, Yael; Ickeson, Tamar; Kaye-Tzadok, Avital",Internet Interv,726,20

We highlight a roadmap to strengthen small millet cultivation, such as identifying varieties suitable for particular environments and targeting trait improvement using genetic and genomic approaches.

Shortages in staff, operating theatre space and intensive care beds has led to a significant reduction in the provision of surgical care. Even vascular surgery, often insulated from resource scarcity due to its status as an urgent specialty, has limited capacity due to the pandemic. Furthermore, many vascular surgical patients are elderly with multiple comorbidities putting them at increased risk of COVID-19 and its complications. There is an urgent need to investigate the impact on patients presenting to vascular surgeons during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods and Analysis: The COvid-19 Vascular sERvice (COVER) study has been designed to investigate the worldwide impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on vascular surgery, at both service provision and individual patient level. COVER is running as a collaborative study through the Vascular and Endovascular Research Network (VERN) with the support of numerous national (Vascular Society of Great Britain and Ireland, British Society of Endovascular Therapy, British Society of Interventional Radiology, Rouleaux Club) and an evolving number of international organisations (Vascupedia, SingVasc, Audible Bleeding (USA), Australian and New Zealand Vascular Trials Network (ANZVTN)). The study has 3 Tiers: Tier 1 is a survey of vascular surgeons to capture longitudinal changes to the provision of vascular services within their hospital; Tier 2 captures data on vascular and endovascular procedures performed during the pandemic; and Tier 3 will capture any deviations to patient management strategies from pre-pandemic best practice. Data submission and collection will be electronic using online survey tools (Tier 1: SurveyMonkey for service provision data) and encrypted data capture forms (Tiers 2 and 3: REDCap for patient level data). Tier 1 data will undergo real-time serial analysis to determine longitudinal changes in practice, with country-specific analyses also performed. The analysis of Tier 2 and Tier 3 data will occur on completion of the study as per the pre-specified statistical analysis plan. Ethical Approval: Ethical approval from the UK Health Research Authority has been obtained for Tiers 2 and 3 (20/NW/0196 Liverpool Central). Participating centres in the UK will be required to seek local research and development approval. Non-UK centres will need to obtain a research ethics committee or institutional review board approvals in accordance with national and/or local requirements.

All 31 serotypes of ECHO viruses grew in HT-29, 27 and SKCO-1, 5 in HRT-18, 29 in PMK and 29 in RD. There was good growth of poliovirus serotypes in all five cell types. Coxsackie B viruses grew well in all the cell lines except RD. Fifteen of the Coxsackie A viruses grew in SKCO-1, 4 in HT-29, 3 in HRT-18 and 7 in RD. Enterovirus serotypes 70 and 71 grew only in RD cells after 3 serial passages. These results showed that 2 of the gut tumour-derived cell lines, HT-29 and SKCO-1 had a markedly wider susceptibility, with comparable or wider sensitivity, for enteroviruses, than PMK and RD.

Additionally, the lack of adequate pandemic preparedness plans identified in many countries may be responsible for infodemics. NonCOVID medical illnesses have taken a back seat at many places while implementing COVID 19 control strategies and patients are diverted to COVID 19 screening hospitals leading to a potential health crisis.

RESULTS: Intramuscular neural distribution were densely detected at 20–40% and 60–80% for the sartorius muscles. The result suggests that the treatment of sartorius muscle spasticity requires botulinum neurotoxin injections in particular locations.

To improve the noise robustness, we try to integrate CNNs with wavelet by replacing the common down-sampling (max-pooling, strided-convolution, and average pooling) with discrete wavelet transform (DWT). We firstly propose general DWT and inverse DWT (IDWT) layers applicable to various orthogonal and biorthogonal discrete wavelets like Haar, Daubechies, and Cohen, etc., and then design wavelet integrated CNNs (WaveCNets) by integrating DWT into the commonly used CNNs (VGG, ResNets, and DenseNet). During the down-sampling, WaveCNets apply DWT to decompose the feature maps into the low-frequency and high-frequency components. Containing the main information including the basic object structures, the low-frequency component is transmitted into the following layers to generate robust high-level features. The high-frequency components are dropped to remove most of the data noises. The experimental results show that %wavelet accelerates the CNN training, and WaveCNets achieve higher accuracy on ImageNet than various vanilla CNNs. We have also tested the performance of WaveCNets on the noisy version of ImageNet, ImageNet-C and six adversarial attacks, the results suggest that the proposed DWT/IDWT layers could provide better noise-robustness and adversarial robustness. When applying WaveCNets as backbones, the performance of object detectors (i.e., faster R-CNN and RetinaNet) on COCO detection dataset are consistently improved. We believe that suppression of aliasing effect, i.e. separation of low frequency and high frequency information, is the main advantages of our approach. The code of our DWT/IDWT layer and different WaveCNets are available at https://github.com/CVI-SZU/WaveCNet.","Li, Qiufu; Shen, Linlin; Guo, Sheng; Lai, Zhihui",IEEE transactions on image processing : a publication of the IEEE Signal Processing Society,726,1

However, there has not yet been a systematic review and synthesis of this evidence. This paper reports the results of a systematic review of qualitative, quantitative, and mixed-methods studies assessing the implementation and/or effectiveness of talk therapies for CMDs when provided by lay workers in LMICs to adults who have survived or are currently living in humanitarian situations. METHODS: Seven electronic databases were searched: MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, PsycEXTRA, Global Health, Cochrane Library, and ClinicalTrials.gov. We also hand-searched the contents pages of three academic journals, reference lists of 30 systematic reviews, and online resource directories of two mental health networks. A preliminary list of included studies was circulated to topical experts for review, and all included studies were backward and forward searched. All titles, abstracts, and full-texts were independently double-screened. Quality appraisal and data extraction were carried out by a single reviewer and checked by a second reviewer, using standardised tools. Any disagreements were discussed and referred to a third reviewer as needed. RESULTS: We identified 23 unique studies and carried out a narrative synthesis of patient and implementation outcome data. Every evaluation of the effectiveness of lay-delivered talk therapies for adults affected by humanitarian crises in LMICs showed some treatment effect for at least one CMD, and often multiple CMDs. Implementation research generally found these interventions to be acceptable, appropriate and feasible to implement, with good fidelity to manualised therapies. CONCLUSION: Although results are promising, particularly for individually-delivered talk therapies based on cognitive behavioural therapy techniques, there is a high degree of heterogeneity in this literature. We make several recommendations on how to improve the quality and generalisability of research on this topic, to facilitate further evidence synthesis.

Here, we developed a machine-learning model for COVID-19 detection that uses four layers of information: (i) sociodemographic characteristics of the individual, (ii) spatio-temporal patterns of the disease, (iii) medical condition and general health consumption of the individual and (iv) information reported by the individual during the testing episode. We evaluated our model on 140 682 members of Maccabi Health Services who were tested for COVID-19 at least once between February and October 2020. These individuals underwent, in total, 264 516 COVID-19 PCR tests, out of which 16 512 were positive. Our multi-layer model obtained an area under the curve (AUC) of 81.6% when evaluated over all the individuals in the dataset, and an AUC of 72.8% when only individuals who did not report any symptom were included. Furthermore, considering only information collected before the testing episode—i.e. before the individual had the chance to report on any symptom—our model could reach a considerably high AUC of 79.5%. Our ability to predict early on the outcomes of COVID-19 tests is pivotal for breaking transmission chains, and can be used for a more efficient testing policy.","Shmueli, Erez; Mansuri, Ronen; Porcilan, Matan; Amir, Tamar; Yosha, Lior; Yechezkel, Matan; Patalon, Tal; Handelman-Gotlib, Sharon; Gazit, Sivan; Yamin, Dan",J R Soc Interface,726,20

The infection risk from SARS CoV-2, the high mortality of hospitalized COVID-19 patients and the duration of the pandemic have created sustained and often traumatic stressors affecting HCW and FR. Objectives: To assess the relationship of COVID-19 stressor frequency scores to psychiatric rating scale scores amongst HCW and FR. To determine if psychiatric rating scale scores mediate stressor effects on perceived work function and likelihood of remaining in current occupation. Design: Observational, self-report in a convenience sample Participants: 118 HCW and FR caring for COVID-19 patients in the United States. Main Measure: COVID-19 related stressor frequencies were assessed using a 17-item questionnaire. Psychiatric symptoms were assessed with the PTSD Checklist 5 (PCL5), the Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (for depression) (PHQ9), the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), and the General Anxiety Disorder 7 (GAD7). Key Results: Stressor frequency scores correlated significantly with PCL5 scores (R=.57, p<1e-8), PHQ scores (R=.35, P<.001), ISI scores (R=.38, p<1e-4), and GAD7 scores (R=.39, p<.001), likelihood of staying in current occupation (R=-.39,p<1e-4), and trouble doing usual work (R=.33,p<.001). 51% of HCW and 44% of FR indicated decreased likelihood of staying in their current occupation. PCL5 scores substantially mediated the association between stress frequency scores and work function impairment. Conclusions: These results direct attention to recognizing potentially treatable psychiatric symptoms, particularly those of PTSD, in HCW and FR experiencing COVID-19 related stressors. They also suggest that mitigating COVID-19 related stressors when possible, such as by providing adequate personal protective equipment, can improve HCW and FR mental health, work function and retention in the health care work force.","Hendrickson, R.

This is the first national study to investigate the impact of the pandemic on physicians practicing obstetrics and gynecology in China. Methods: A two-stage, stratified, cluster sampling method was performed based on the city categories (category 1, fewer than 10,000 beds; category 2, 10,000–30,000; and category 3, more than 30,000) and public hospital levels (primary, secondary, and tertiary). Physicians practicing obstetrics and gynecology reported the relevant changes in their general clinical activities and changes in the management of specific diseases or conditions occurring during the periods that they were most strongly affected. These changes were compared by municipal and hospital characteristics. Results: Questionnaires were collected from a representative sample of 11,806 physicians actively practicing obstetrics and gynecology in 779 hospitals from 157 cities of 31 provinces. Except emergency visits and online consultations, category 3 cities, tertiary hospitals and general hospitals had greater reductions in overall clinical activities than category 1 cities, primary hospitals and specialized hospitals (all adjusted p < 0.05), respectively. The differences also existed in the management of specific diseases and conditions, especially for less urgent conditions, including cervical cancer screening, instructions regarding contraception and miscarriage, and assisted reproduction (all p < 0.05).

Cases newly diagnosed with COVID-19 at the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University from January 2020 to February 2020 were analyzed retrospectively. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to determine severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) from throat swab sample ΔCT values; lymphocyte and lymphocyte subset counts, coagulation system factor levels, myocardial injury indexes, and laboratory biochemical indicators were compared between the mild group and the severe group. The correlation between the relative load of nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 RNA and severe disease symptoms was analyzed. Of the 76 patients, 49 were male and 27 were female. The lymphocyte, CD4+ T lymphocyte, and CD8+ T lymphocyte counts all differed significantly between the two groups (p < 0.001), as did differences in interleukin (IL)-2R, IL-6, and IL-8 levels (p = 0.022, 0.026, and 0.012, respectively). Moreover, there were significant differences in prothrombin time, D-dimer, and fibrinogen levels between the mild group and the severe group (p = 0.029, 0.006, and <0.001, respectively), and in lactate dehydrogenase and troponin (p < 0.001 and p = 0.007, respectively). SARS-CoV-2 RNA load and lymphocyte count, CD4+ T lymphocyte count, and CD8+ T lymphocyte count were linearly negatively correlated (p < 0.001). SARS-CoV-2 RNA load was positively correlated with IL-2R, prothrombin time, lactate dehydrogenase, and hypersensitive troponin T (p = 0.002, p = 0.009, and p < 0.001, respectively). In addition, the time that it took for the nucleic acid test to turn negative was significantly shorter for patients in the mild group than for those in the severe group (Z = -6.713, p < 0.001). In conclusion, relative SARS-CoV-2 RNA load in the nasopharynx is closely related to COVID-19 severity. If the relative RNA load was higher, the lymphocyte count was lower, organ damage was greater, and the time it took for the nucleic acid test to turn negative was longer.","Liu, Yang; Liao, Wenjian; Wan, Lagen; Xiang, Tianxing; Zhang, Wei",Viral Immunol,726,8

In 2020, as part of Denmark's extensive, free-of-charge PCR-testing strategy, approximately 4 million individuals (69% of the population) underwent 10·6 million tests. Using these national PCR-test data from 2020, we estimated protection towards repeat infection with SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: In this population-level observational study, we collected individual-level data on patients who had been tested in Denmark in 2020 from the Danish Microbiology Database and analysed infection rates during the second surge of the COVID-19 epidemic, from Sept 1 to Dec 31, 2020, by comparison of infection rates between individuals with positive and negative PCR tests during the first surge (March to May, 2020). For the main analysis, we excluded people who tested positive for the first time between the two surges and those who died before the second surge. We did an alternative cohort analysis, in which we compared infection rates throughout the year between those with and without a previous confirmed infection at least 3 months earlier, irrespective of date. We also investigated whether differences were found by age group, sex, and time since infection in the alternative cohort analysis. We calculated rate ratios (RRs) adjusted for potential confounders and estimated protection against repeat infection as 1 – RR. FINDINGS: During the first surge (ie, before June, 2020), 533 381 people were tested, of whom 11 727 (2·20%) were PCR positive, and 525 339 were eligible for follow-up in the second surge, of whom 11 068 (2·11%) had tested positive during the first surge. Among eligible PCR-positive individuals from the first surge of the epidemic, 72 (0·65% [95% CI 0·51–0·82]) tested positive again during the second surge compared with 16 819 (3·27% [3·22–3·32]) of 514 271 who tested negative during the first surge (adjusted RR 0·195 [95% CI 0·155–0·246]). Protection against repeat infection was 80·5% (95% CI 75·4–84·5). The alternative cohort analysis gave similar estimates (adjusted RR 0·212 [0·179–0·251], estimated protection 78·8% [74·9–82·1]). In the alternative cohort analysis, among those aged 65 years and older, observed protection against repeat infection was 47·1% (95% CI 24·7–62·8). We found no difference in estimated protection against repeat infection by sex (male 78·4% [72·1–83·2] vs female 79·1% [73·9–83·3]) or evidence of waning protection over time (3–6 months of follow-up 79·3% [74·4–83·3] vs ≥7 months of follow-up 77·7% [70·9–82·9]). INTERPRETATION: Our findings could inform decisions on which groups should be vaccinated and advocate for vaccination of previously infected individuals because natural protection, especially among older people, cannot be relied on.

The risk is more important than that associated with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) disease. No comparative data are available on the immune responses of these diseases. OBJECTIVE: To compare T-helper(1 )(Th(1)), Th(2 )and T-regulatory (T(reg)) cell type cytokine responses between RV and RSV induced early wheezing. METHODS: Systemic Th(1)-type (interferon [IFN] -gamma, interleukin [IL] -2, IL-12), Th(2)-type (IL-4, IL-5, IL-13) and T(reg)-type (IL-10) cytokine responses were studied from acute and convalescence phase serum samples of sole RV (n = 23) and RSV affected hospitalized wheezing children (n = 27). The pre-defined inclusion criteria were age of 3-35 months and first or second wheezing episode. Analysis was adjusted for baseline differences. Asymptomatic children with comparable demographics (n = 11) served as controls for RV-group. RESULTS: RV-group was older and had more atopic characteristics than RSV-group. At acute phase, RV-group had higher (fold change) IL-13 (39-fold), IL-12 (7.5-fold), IFN-gamma (6.0-fold) and IL-5 (2.8-fold) concentrations than RSV-group and higher IFN-gamma (27-fold), IL-2 (8.9-fold), IL-5 (5.6-fold) and IL-10 (2.6-fold) than the controls. 2-3 weeks later, RV-group had higher IFN-gamma (>100-fold), IL-13 (33-fold) and IL-10 (6.5-fold) concentrations than RSV-group and higher IFN-gamma (15-fold) and IL-2 (9.4-fold) than the controls. IL-10 levels were higher in acute phase compared to convalescence phase in both infections (p < 0.05 for all). CONCLUSION: Our results support a hypothesis that RV is likely to trigger wheezing mainly in children with a predisposition. IL-10 may have important regulatory function in acute viral wheeze.","Jartti, Tuomas; Paul-Anttila, Maria; Lehtinen, Pasi; Parikka, Vilhelmiina; Vuorinen, Tytti; Simell, Olli; Ruuskanen, Olli",Respir Res,726,22

Methods: Among patients from a large neuroscience institute in Hawaii, vaccine hesitancy was investigated in relation to over 30 sociodemographic variables and medical comorbidities, via a telephone quality improvement survey conducted between 23 January 2021 and 13 February 2021. Results: Vaccine willingness (n = 363) was 81.3%. Univariate analysis identified that the odds of vaccine acceptance reduced for patients who do not regard COVID-19 as a severe illness, are of younger age, have a lower Charlson Comorbidity Index, use illicit drugs, or carry Medicaid insurance. Multivariable logistic regression identified the best predictors of vaccine hesitancy to be: social media use to obtain COVID-19 information, concerns regarding vaccine safety, self-perception of a preexisting medical condition contraindicated with vaccination, not having received the annual influenza vaccine, having some high school education only, being a current smoker, and not having a prior cerebrovascular accident. Unique amongst males, a conservative political view strongly predicted vaccine hesitancy. Specifically for Asians, a higher body mass index, while for Native Hawaiians and other Pacific Islanders (NHPI), a positive depression screen, both reduced the odds of vaccine acceptance. Conclusion: Upon identifying the variables associated with vaccine hesitancy amongst patients with neurological disorders, our clinic is now able to efficiently provide ancillary COVID-19 education to sub-populations at risk for vaccine hesitancy. While our results may be limited to the sub-population of patients with neurological disorders, the findings nonetheless provide valuable insight to understanding vaccine hesitancy.","Ghaffari-Rafi, Arash; Teehera, Kimberly Bergenholtz; Higashihara, Tate Justin; Morden, Frances Tiffany Cava; Goo, Connor; Pang, Michelle; Sutton, Cori Xiu Yue; Kim, Kyung Moo; Lew, Rachel Jane; Luu, Kayti; Yamashita, Shaina; Mitchell, Catherine; Carrazana, Enrique; Viereck, Jason; Liow, Kore Kai",Infect Dis Rep,726,22

The spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 pandemic has forced many patients to momentarily stop the scheduled BT-A injections. The goal of this study was to explore whether those patients experienced a worsening of their CM and, if any, the clinical predictors of migraine worsening after BT-A withdrawal. Methods: This was a retrospective, multicenter study. Patients' clinical data were obtained from their clinical documentation stored at each center. In particular, the following variables were collected: the mean number of headache days in the last month (NHD), the average number of painkillers taken in the last month (AC), the average number of days in which patients took, at least, one painkiller in the last month (NDM), the average intensity of migraine using the numeric rating scale (NRS) score in the last month, and the average score obtained at the six-item Headache Impact Test. The variables mentioned earlier were compared before and after BT-A withdrawal. Results: After BT-A suspension, there was a significant increase in the NHD (P = 0.0313, Kruskal–Wallis rank test), AC (P = 0.0421, Kruskal–Wallis rank test), NDM (P = 0.0394, paired t-test), NRS score (P = 0.0069, Kruskal–Wallis rank test), and six-item Headache Impact Test score (P = 0.0372, Kruskal–Wallis rank test). Patients who were not assuming other preventive treatments other than BT-A displayed similar results. Patients who experienced a >30% worsening in NHD after BT-A was withdrawn displayed a longer CM history (P = 0.001, Kruskal–Wallis rank test), a longer MOH duration (P = 0.0017, Kruskal–Wallis rank test), a higher AC value at the baseline (P = 0.0149, Kruskal–Wallis rank test), a higher NDM (P = 0.0024, t-test), and a higher average value of the NRS score (P = 0.0073, Kruskal–Wallis rank test). Conclusion: BT-A withdrawn during severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 pandemic was associated with a general worsening in patients suffering from CM, hence the need to continue BT-A injection to avoid patients' worsening.","Baraldi, Carlo; Ornello, Raffaele; Favoni, Valentina; Sacco, Simona; Caponnetto, Valeria; Pierangeli, Giulia; Pani, Luca; Cevoli, Sabina; Guerzoni, Simona",Front Neurol,726,16

Their expression is upregulated following stress and viral infection, and they associate with the SRP9/14 protein dimer in the cytoplasm forming Alu RNPs. Using cell-free translation, we have previously shown that Alu RNPs inhibit polysome formation. Here, we describe the mechanism of Alu RNP-mediated inhibition of translation initiation and demonstrate its effect on translation of cellular and viral RNAs. Both cap-dependent and IRES-mediated initiation is inhibited. Inhibition involves direct binding of SRP9/14 to 40S ribosomal subunits and requires Alu RNA as an assembly factor but its continuous association with 40S subunits is not required for inhibition. Binding of SRP9/14 to 40S prevents 48S complex formation by interfering with the recruitment of mRNA to 40S subunits. In cells, overexpression of Alu RNA decreases translation of reporter mRNAs and this effect is alleviated with a mutation that reduces its affinity for SRP9/14. Alu RNPs also inhibit the translation of cellular mRNAs resuming translation after stress and of viral mRNAs suggesting a role of Alu RNPs in adapting the translational output in response to stress and viral infection.","Ivanova, Elena; Berger, Audrey; Scherrer, Anne; Alkalaeva, Elena; Strub, Katharina",Nucleic Acids Res,726,11

Development of well-tolerated regimens with high cure rates and fewer side effects is still much needed. Recently, natural antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are attracting more attention as biological compounds and can be a good template to develop therapeutic agents, including antiviral agents against a variety of viruses. Various AMPs have been characterized from the venom of different venomous animals including scorpions. METHODS: The possible antiviral activities of crude venoms obtained from five Egyptian scorpion species (Leiurus quinquestriatus, Androctonus amoreuxi, A. australis, A. bicolor and Scorpio maurus palmatus) were evaluated by a cell culture method using Huh7.5 cells and the J6/JFH1-P47 strain of HCV. Time-of-addition experiments and inactivation of enzymatic activities of the venoms were carried out to determine the characteristics of the anti-HCV activities. RESULTS: S. maurus palmatus and A. australis venoms showed anti-HCV activities, with 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC(50)) being 6.3 ± 1.6 and 88.3 ± 5.8 μg/ml, respectively. S. maurus palmatus venom (30 μg/ml) impaired HCV infectivity in culture medium, but not inside the cells, through virocidal effect. The anti-HCV activity of this venom was not inhibited by a metalloprotease inhibitor or heating at 60°C. The antiviral activity was directed preferentially against HCV. CONCLUSIONS: S. maurus palmatus venom is considered as a good natural source for characterization and development of novel anti-HCV agents targeting the entry step. To our knowledge, this is the first report describing antiviral activities of Egyptian scorpion venoms against HCV, and may open a new approach towards discovering antiviral compounds derived from scorpion venoms.","El-Bitar, Alaa MH; Sarhan, Moustafa MH; Aoki, Chie; Takahara, Yusuke; Komoto, Mari; Deng, Lin; Moustafa, Mohsen A; Hotta, Hak",Virol J,726,28

OBJECTIVE: To comprehensively evaluate potential racial differences in the diagnosis and treatment of AD in an academic medical center. METHODS: We used the clinical informatics tool, i2b2, to analyze all patient encounters for AD or mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in the University of Alabama at Birmingham Health System over a three-year period, examining neuroimaging rates and dementia-related medication use by race and clinic site using ratio tests on contingency tables of stratified patient counts. RESULTS: Enterprise-wide, African Americans were not underrepresented among outpatients seen for AD/MCI. However, there were differences in the clinic setting where visits occurred, with African Americans overrepresented in Geriatrics and primary care clinics and underrepresented in Memory Disorders specialty clinics. There were no racial differences in the rates at which any clinic ordered PET neuroimaging tests or dementia-related medications. However, unsurprisingly, specialty clinics ordered both PET neuroimaging and dementia-related medications at a higher rate than primary care clinics, and overall across the medical enterprise, African Americans were statistically less likely to have PET neuroimaging or dementia-related medications ordered. CONCLUSION: African Americans with AD/MCI were not underrepresented at this academic medical center but were somewhat less likely to have PET neuroimaging or to be on dementia-related medications, potentially in part from underrepresentation in the specialty clinics where these orders are more likely. The reasons for this underrepresentation in specialty clinics are likely multifactorial and important to better understand.","Murchison, Charles F.; Kennedy, Richard E.; McConathy, Jonathan E.; Roberson, Erik D.",Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,726,1

The HIV protease inhibitor Nelfinavir, widely prescribed in combination with other HIV inhibitors, has been shown to inhibit in vitro SARS-CoV-2 replication. We here report on the effect of Nelfinavir in the Syrian hamster SARS-CoV-2 infection model. Although treatment of infected hamsters with either 15 or 50 mg/kg BID Nelfinavir [for four consecutive days, initiated on the day of infection] does not reduce viral RNA loads nor infectious virus titres in the lungs compared to the vehicle control, the drug reduced virus-induced lung pathology to nearly the baseline scores of healthy animals. A substantial interstitial infiltration of neutrophils is observed in the lungs of treated (both infected and uninfected) animals. The protective effect of Nelfinavir on SARS-CoV-2-induced lung pathology (at doses that are well tolerated and that result in exposures nearing those observed in HIV-infected patients) may lay the foundation for clinical studies with this widely used drug.","Foo, Caroline S.; Abdelnabi, Rana; Kaptein, Suzanne J.

In this study, the synergetic effects of icariin (a flavonoid present in the plant Epimedium brevicornum), natural enrichment (NaEn), and play behavior were investigated. Rats (n = 60) were assigned to standard housing or NaEn; these two groups were subsequently divided into controls, rats receiving icariin treatments, and rats receiving icariin and allowed to play with an individual from another cage. All rats were exposed to unpredictable mild stressors for 4 weeks. At the end of the treatment, a Forced Swim Task (FST) was conducted to assess emotional regulation during an inescapable acute challenge. Biological samples were collected weekly and before and after the FST to monitor endocrine changes. Corticosterone (CORT), dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), and testosterone (T) were assayed. We found that icariin had a significant effect on DHEA/CORT ratios and T levels. NaEn also had a significant effect on both CORT and DHEA, but not on T levels. Play did not appear to be significantly related to the endocrine changes. The strongest positive effects on emotional resilience were observed in NaEn rats that also received icariin. Our results confirmed that using multiple channels to stimulate adaptive responses can be effective in increasing the ability of an organism to face uncertainty. Considering how quickly our life can change due to unpredictable events, our data is instrumental to a better comprehension of the many aspects of integrative biobehavioral responses.","Nwachukwu, Kiana; Rhoads, Elizabeth; Meek, Sarah; Bardi, Massimo",Psychopharmacology (Berl),726,10

Little is known about how people’s age can influence their emotional well-being in the face of prolonged stress generate by the pandemic. OBJECTIVE: To clarify the presence of emotional aspects such as emotional expressiveness and the frequency of positive and negative affections in people with different age in times of crisis. METHODS: The final sample included 297 Chileans between 22 and 68 years old (M = 38.51, SD = 13.85), recruited through an online survey with the appropriate written informed consent. The study was carried out when the pandemic was spreading in Chile. RESULTS: The findings revealed age differences in emotional expressivity and the type of affections experienced. The expression of emotions was more affected by negative affections, the age and the gender of the people. While the avoidance of this emotional expression, by age and affections both positive and negative. Age was a significant predictor of emotional expressiveness. DISCUSSION: Findings suggests that the associations between both variables, varied according to the age group of the people. Furthermore, this finding proposes that although older people are facing the persistent and serious threat of COVID-19, they show better emotional functioning. Which would help to better understand the interaction of both positive and negative life experiences in times of crisis.","González-Tovar, Mariela; Hernández-Rodríguez, Sergio",Front Psychol,726,16

The long development timescales for such drugs are a major problem, but could be shortened by repurposing existing drugs. We therefore screened a small library of FDA-approved compounds for potential severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) antivirals using a pseudovirus system that allows a sensitive read-out of infectivity. A group of structurally-related compounds, showing moderate inhibitory activity with IC50 values in the 1-5µM range, were identified. Further studies demonstrated that these ‘kite-shaped’ molecules were surprisingly specific for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 and that they acted early in the entry steps of the viral infectious cycle, but did not affect virus attachment to the cells. Moreover the compounds were able to prevent infection in both kidney- and lung-derived human cell lines. The structural homology of the hits allowed the production of a well-defined pharmacophore that was found to be highly accurate in predicting the anti-viral activity of the compounds in the screen. We discuss the prospects of repurposing these existing drugs for treating current and future coronavirus outbreaks.","Chan, Shiu-Wan; Shafi, Talha; Ford, Robert C.",bioRxiv,726,3

Here, we reported effects of COVID-19 outbreak on the mood of general public and ascertained impacts of psychosocial factors on the plague-related emotional measures. METHODS: During Feb. 4-6, 2020, a self-reported questionnaire Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) was disseminated to general public via Wechat, along with a sociodemographic information sheet. BAI score and incidences of moderate and severe anxiety in subgroups of respondents were compared. Multiple linear and logistic regressions were done for correlation analysis and to identify factors predictive of anxiety. RESULTS: Averaged BAI score of all respondents is higher than those of general public in two previous studies. The people quarantined for probable COVID-19 infection presented higher BAI score and incidences of moderate and severe anxiety relative to non-quarantined respondents. People in high epidemic area showed higher BAI score and incidences of moderate and severe anxiety compared to those in low epidemic area. Significant associations existed between anxiety level of the respondents and each of the investigated factors, except for gender. Quarantine was the predictor with a highest OR, followed by divorced/widow. The other factors showed smaller but significant effects on the anxiety level of respondents.

However, data on the clinical outcomes of such patients is limited. CASE PRESENTATION: We report the clinical outcomes of four patients who were admitted at the intensive care unit during the 2017–2018 influenza season with severe sepsis (SOFA score > 11) and acute respiratory distress syndrome requiring ECMO and mechanical ventilation. Two patients were immune-compromised. The A(H1N1)pdm09 genome was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on nasopharyngeal specimen swabs prior to administration of IV zanamivir at a dose of 600 mg twice daily. Weekly qualitative PCR analysis was done to monitor viral clearance, with zanamivir treatment being discontinued upon receipt of negative results. In addition, the patients were managed for concomitant multidrug-resistant bacterial infections, with infection resolution confirmed with blood cultures. The median time for zanamivir treatment was 10 days (IQR 10–17). The clinical outcome was favourable with all four patients surviving and improving clinically. All four patients achieved viral clearance of A(H1N1)pdm09 genome, and resolution of multidrug-resistant bacterial infections.

Complement activation products orchestrate a proinflammatory environment that might be critical for the induction and maintenance of a severe inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2 by recruiting cells of the cellular immune system to the sites of infection and shifting their state of activation towards an inflammatory phenotype. It precedes pathophysiological milestone events like the cytokine storm, progressive endothelial injury triggering microangiopathy, and further complement activation, and causes an acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). To date, the application of antiviral drugs and corticosteroids have shown efficacy in the early stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection, but failed to ameliorate disease severity in patients who progressed to severe COVID-19 pathology. This report demonstrates that lectin pathway (LP) recognition molecules of the complement system, such as MBL, FCN-2 and CL-11, bind to SARS-CoV-2 S- and N-proteins, with subsequent activation of LP-mediated C3b and C4b deposition. In addition, our results confirm and underline that the N-protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds directly to the LP- effector enzyme MASP-2 and activates complement. Inhibition of the LP using an inhibitory monoclonal antibody against MASP-2 effectively blocks LP-mediated complement activation. FACS analyses using transfected HEK-293 cells expressing SARS-CoV-2 S protein confirm a robust LP-dependent C3b deposition on the cell surface which is inhibited by the MASP-2 inhibitory antibody. In light of our present results, and the encouraging performance of our clinical candidate MASP-2 inhibitor Narsoplimab in recently published clinical trials, we suggest that the targeting of MASP-2 provides an unsurpassed window of therapeutic efficacy for the treatment of severe COVID-19.","Ali, Youssif M.; Ferrari, Matteo; Lynch, Nicholas J.; Yaseen, Sadam; Dudler, Thomas; Gragerov, Sasha; Demopulos, Gregory; Heeney, Jonathan L.; Schwaeble, Wilhelm J.",Front Immunol,726,16

This equipment must be sterilized as gently as possible before reuse. One possibility is thermal inactivation, but professional autoclaves with their high temperatures are often not available or suitable. If the inactivation period is long enough, coronavirus inactivation can also be carried out at relatively low temperatures. The required duration was determined in this study. Material and methods: Data from published thermal inactivation studies on coronaviruses were applied to determine the temperature dependence of the rate constant k(T) for each coronavirus by employing Arrhenius models. Results: The data obtained exhibit large variations, which appear to be at least partially caused by different sample properties. Samples with high protein content or samples in dry air sometimes seem to be more difficult to inactivate. Apart from this, the Arrhenius models describe the thermal inactivation properties well and SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 can even be represented by a combined model. Furthermore, the available data suggest that all samples, including critical ones, can be mathematically included by a worst-case Arrhenius model. Conclusion: Coronaviruses can already be inactivated at relatively low temperatures. For most samples, application times of approximately 32.5, 3.7, and 0.5 minutes will be sufficient at 60°C, 80°C, and 100°C, respectively, for a 5 log-reduction.

SARS-CoV-2 encodes a Spike (S) protein that binds to human ACE2 receptor to mediate cell entry. A species with a human-like ACE2 receptor could therefore be at risk of being infected by SARS-CoV-2. We compared between 132 mammalian ACE2 genes and between 17 coronavirus S proteins. We showed that while global similarities reflected by whole ACE2 gene alignments are poor predictors of high-risk mammals, local similarities at key S protein-binding sites highlight several high-risk mammals that share good ACE2 homology with human. Bats are likely reservoirs of SARS-CoV-2, but there are other high-risk mammals that share better ACE2 homologies with human. Both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV are closely related to bat coronavirus. Yet, among host-specific coronaviruses infecting high-risk mammals, key ACE2-binding sites on S proteins share highest similarities between SARS-CoV-2 and Pangolin-CoV and between SARS-CoV and Civet-CoV. These results suggest that direct coronavirus transmission from bat to human is unlikely, and that rapid adaptation of a bat SARS-like coronavirus in different high-risk intermediate hosts could have allowed it to acquire distinct high binding potential between S protein and human-like ACE2 receptors.","Wei, Yulong; Aris, Parisa; Farookhi, Heba; Xia, Xuhua",Sci Rep,726,26

Yet, limited data are available about access and quality of care available to pregnant individuals in rural areas, particularly among American Indians (AIs). Unannounced standardized patients (USPs), or “secret shoppers” with standardized characteristics, have been used to assess healthcare access and quality when outcomes cannot be measured by conventional methods or when differences may exist between actual versus reported care. While the USP approach has shown benefit in evaluating primary care and select specialties, its use to date for OUD and pregnancy is very limited. METHODS: We used literature review, current practice guidelines for perinatal OUD management, and stakeholder engagement to design a novel USP protocol to assess healthcare access and quality for OUD in pregnancy. We developed two USP profiles—one white and one AI—to reflect our target study area consisting of three rural, predominantly white and AI US counties. We partnered with a local community health center network providing care to a large AI population to define six priority outcomes for evaluation: (1) OUD treatment knowledge among clinical staff answering telephones; (2) primary care clinic facilitation and provision of prenatal care and buprenorphine treatment; (3) appropriate completion of evidence-based screening, symptom assessment, and initial steps in management; (4) appropriate completion of risk factor screening/probing about individual circumstances that may affect care; (5) patient-directed tone, stigma, and professionalism by clinic staff; and (6) disparities in care between whites and American Indians. DISCUSSION: The development of this USP protocol tailored to a specific environment and high-risk patient population establishes an innovative approach to evaluate healthcare access and quality for pregnant individuals with OUD.

Mass spectrometry, on the other hand, is an analytical technique characterizing ionized molecules or fragments thereof by mass-to-charge ratios, which has been prosperingly developed for rapid and reliable qualitative and quantitative identification of lipid species. Parallel to best performance of in-depth chromatographical separation of lipid classes, preconditions of precise quantitation of unique molecular species by preprocessing of biological samples have to be fulfilled. As a consequence, “lipid profiles” across model systems and human individuals, esp. complex (clinical) samples, have become eminent over the last couple of years due to sensitivity, specificity, and discriminatory capability. Therefore, it is significance to consider the entire experimental strategy from sample collection and preparation, data acquisition, analysis, and interpretation. Areas Covered: In this review, we outline considerations with clinical (i.e., human) samples with special emphasis on sample handling, specific physicochemical properties, target measurements, and resulting profiling of sphingolipids in biomedicine and translational research to maximize sensitivity and specificity as well as to provide robust and reproducible results. A brief commentary is also provided regarding new insights of “clinical sphingolipidomics” in translational sepsis research. Expert Opinion: The role of mass spectrometry of sphingolipids and related species (“sphingolipidomics”) to investigate cellular and compartment-specific response to stress, e.g., in generalized infection and sepsis, is on the rise and the ability to integrate multiple datasets from diverse classes of biomolecules by mass spectrometry measurements and metabolomics will be crucial to fostering our understanding of human health as well as response to disease and treatment.","Claus, Ralf A.; Graeler, Markus H.",Front Med (Lausanne),726,16

This paper presents a prospective service evaluation during establishment of urgent dental care in the North East of England over a six-week period. Aim To monitor patient volumes, demographics and outcomes at the North East urgent dental care centre and confirm appropriate care pathways. Main outcome methods Data were collected on key characteristics of patients accessing urgent care from 23 March to 3 May 2020. Analysis was with descriptive statistics. Results There were 1,746 patient triages (1,595 telephone and 151 face-to-face), resulting in 1,322 clinical consultations. The most common diagnoses were symptomatic irreversible pulpitis or apical periodontitis. Sixty-five percent of clinical consultations resulted in extractions and 0.8% in an aerosol generating procedure. Patients travelled 25 km on average to access care; however, this reduced as more urgent care centres were established. The majority of patients were asymptomatic of COVID-19 and, to our knowledge, no staff acquired infection due to occupational exposure. Conclusion The urgent dental care centre effectively managed urgent and emergency dental care, with appropriate patient pathways established over the six-week period.

Nevertheless, to date no specific suggestions regarding physical activity and exercise in cancer patients during the COVID-19 era have been released, neglecting the potential deleterious effects of quarantine and sedentary (imposed as containment measures against COVID-19), particularly in these subjects. Moreover, literature is constantly consolidating the crucial impact of regular physical activity in cancer in reducing recurrence and mortality risk. In this Commentary, we discuss possible adaptations of the recently published exercise guidelines to the current pandemic emergency, proposing various modalities to prevent or mitigate the physical inactivity risk in cancer patients.","Avancini, Alice; Trestini, Ilaria; Tregnago, Daniela; Wiskemann, Joachim; Lanza, Massimo; Milella, Michele; Pilotto, Sara",JNCI Cancer Spectr,726,11

Currently, scientific evidence regarding the attitudes of the Romanian public towards ticks is scanty. This study aimed to identify how the lockdown enforced by the COVID-19 pandemic in Romania impacted the recreational behaviour, risk perceptions, and protective practices of the Romanian population regarding ticks. METHODS: A cross-sectional, nationwide web-based questionnaire was designed and distributed via social media to evaluate if, and how, the COVID-19 lockdown impacted the behaviour of the Romanian public concerning ticks. The survey was available online from 6 May until 15 May 2020, which marked the last day of the travel ban in Romania. The collected data were processed by applying both uni- and multivariate methods. RESULTS: Respondents reported a higher frequency of finding ticks on themselves and their dogs during the lockdown. Bathing/showering and checking the body for ticks were the two most used protective behaviours both before and during the lockdown. Nevertheless, an overall lower usage rate of protective measures was registered during the lockdown. Almost all dog owners used a form of ectoparasite control for their dogs, and only three stopped due to lockdown-associated reasons. Respondent characteristics that were found to be positively associated with risk perceptions were being female and living in peri-urban/suburban/rural environments. CONCLUSIONS: Despite spending less time outdoors during the lockdown, more respondents reported finding ticks on themselves or their dogs. Changes in the preferences for recreational locations, rates of protective practices usage, amount of time spent in specific areas, or tick seasonal activity might have contributed to this outcome. Concerning risk groups, men of all ages, senior citizens, and rural inhabitants should be targeted by the relevant Romanian authorities when promoting local or nationwide tick awareness campaigns.

A model-based estimation,11.493942,10.184506,2020-04-11,"BACKGROUND: There are currently rare satisfactory markers for predicting the death of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The aim of this study is to establish a model based on the combination of serum cytokines and lymphocyte subsets for predicting the prognosis of the disease. METHODS: A total of 739 participants with COVID-19 were enrolled at Tongji Hospital from February to April 2020 and classified into fatal (n = 51) and survived (n = 688) groups according to the patient’s outcome. Cytokine profile and lymphocyte subset analysis was performed simultaneously. RESULTS: The fatal patients exhibited a significant lower number of lymphocytes including B cells, CD4(+) T cells, CD8(+) T cells, and NK cells and remarkably higher concentrations of cytokines including interleukin-2 receptor, interleukin-6, interleukin-8, and tumor necrosis factor-α on admission compared with the survived subjects. A model based on the combination of interleukin-8 and the numbers of CD4(+) T cells and NK cells showed a good performance in predicting the death of patients with COVID-19. When the threshold of 0.075 was used, the sensitivity and specificity of the prediction model were 90.20% and 90.26%, respectively. Meanwhile, interleukin-8 was found to have a potential value in predicting the length of hospital stay until death. CONCLUSIONS: Significant increase of cytokines and decrease of lymphocyte subsets are found positively correlated with in-hospital death. A model based on the combination of three markers provides an attractive approach to predict the prognosis of COVID-19.

Tropical outbreaks often peak in wet seasons. Temperate outbreaks typically peak during the winter. The prevailing causal hypotheses focus on sunlight, temperature and humidity variations. Yet no consistent factors have been identified to sufficiently explain seasonal virus emergence and decline at any latitude. Here we demonstrate close connections among global-scale atmospheric circulations, IgE antibody enhancement through seasonal pollen inhalation, and respiratory virus patterns at any populated latitude, with a focus on the US. Pollens emerge each Spring, and the renewed IgE titers in the population are argued to terminate each winter peak of respiratory illness. Globally circulated airborne viruses are postulated to subsequently deposit across the Southern US during lower zonal geostrophic winds each late Summer. This seasonally refreshed viral load is postulated to trigger a new influenza outbreak, once the existing IgE antibodies diminish to a critical value each Fall. Our study offers a new and consistent explanation for the seasonal diminishment of respiratory viral illnesses in temperate climates, the subdued seasonal signature in the tropics, the annually circulated virus phenotypes, and the northerly migration of influenza across the US every year. Our integrated geospatial and IgE hypothesis provides a new perspective for prediction, mitigation and prevention of the outbreak and spread of seasonal respiratory viruses including Covid-19 pandemic.","Wallace, Michael G.; Wang, Yifeng",Sci Rep,726,20

A lot of new data are published regularly. Materials and Methods: Original clinical studies, review articles, and guidelines in children were searched for and the most relevant included in this review. Results: A total of 138 retrieved papers were classified into pathogenesis, epidemiology, diagnosis, and treatment. Pathogenesis is currently explained with the “multi hit hypothesis”, with complex interactions of genetic and environmental factors which trigger inflammation in steatotic liver. The prevalence is rising. A diagnosis can be made with laboratory tests, imaging, and liver biopsy after the exclusion of other causes of liver steatosis. The mainstay of treatment is lifestyle modification consisting of dietary intervention and increased physical activity. The progression to liver cirrhosis can occur even in children. Conclusions: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in children is a part of a metabolic syndrome in the majority of patients. Due to its complex etiology and high prevalence, multidisciplinary teams, together with public health professionals, should be involved in its treatment.","Brecelj, Jernej; Orel, Rok",Medicina (Kaunas),726,1

Pimpri-Chinchwad township with a population of over 25 lakhs is located in Maharashtra, one of the worst affected states in India. After the incidence peaked in the township in mid-September 2020, cases started declining even as lockdown restrictions were eased. Objectives A seroprevalence study was conducted to understand the transmission dynamics of the pandemic in this region. Methods We carried out a population-based seroprevalence study for IgG antibodies for severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) among 5000 residents 12 years and above selected by the cluster random sampling. We selected 50 clusters in slums, 80 clusters in tenements, and 70 clusters from housing societies. The field work for collection of samples was carried out from October 07 to October 17, 2020. We used kit from Abbott (SARS-CoV-2 IgG), which employs chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay technology. The prevalence of IgG antibodies was expressed as point estimates with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). These were weighted for areas and cluster effect and further adjusted for test performance. Results The overall seropositivity for IgG was 34.04% (95% CIl 31.3%-36.8%). Slum dwellers had 40.9% positivity rate (95% CI 37.0%-44.7%), those in tenements 41.2% (95% CI 37.7%-44.8%) and people living in housing societies had 29.8% positivity (95% CI 25.8%-33.8%). Conclusion A considerable proportion of population had encountered the novel coronavirus approaching partial, if not complete, herd immunity, which may partly explain the declining trend in spite of easing of lockdown restrictions.","Banerjee, Amitav; Gaikwad, Bhargav; Desale, Atul; Jadhav, Sudhir Laxman; Rathod, Hetal; Srivastava, Kajal",Indian journal of public health,726,21

IFNλs engage a unique receptor complex comprising IFNLR1 and IL10R2, nevertheless they share signaling cascade and many functions with type I IFNs, questioning their possible non-redundant roles and overall biological importance. Here, we review the latest evidence establishing the primacy of IFNλs in front line protection at anatomical barriers, mediating antiviral immunity before type I IFNs. We also discuss their emerging role in regulating inflammation and limiting host damage, a major difference to type I IFNs. IFNλs come thus to light as dual function cytokines mediating antiviral immunity and damage control.","Andreakos, Evangelos; Zanoni, Ivan; Galani, Ioanna E",Current Opinion in Immunology,726,33

Regulatory oversight of compounding is piecemeal and compounding errors have resulted in patient harm. We review compounding in the United States (US), including a history of compounding, a critique of current regulatory oversight, and a systematic review of compounding errors recorded in the literature. METHODS: We gathered reports of compounding errors occurring in the US from 1990 to 2020 from PubMed, Embase, several relevant conference abstracts, and the US Food and Drug Administration “Drug Alerts and Statements” repository. We categorized reports into errors of “contamination,” suprapotency,” and “subpotency.” Errors were also subdivided by whether they resulted in morbidity and mortality. We reported demographic, medication, and outcome data where available. RESULTS: We screened 2155 reports and identified 63 errors. Twenty-one of 63 were errors of concentration, harming 36 patients. Twenty-seven of 63 were contamination errors, harming 1119 patients. Fifteen errors did not result in any identified harm. DISCUSSION: Compounding errors are attributed to contamination or concentration. Concentration errors predominantly result from compounding a prescription for a single patient, and disproportionately affect children. Contamination errors largely occur during bulk distribution of compounded medications for parenteral use, and affect more patients. The burden falls on the government, pharmacy industry, and medical providers to reduce the risk of patient harm caused by compounding errors. CONCLUSION: In the US, drug compounding is important in ensuring access to vital medications, but has the potential to cause patient harm without adequate safeguards.","Watson, C.

We examined various immune parameters including the markers of immune cells exhaustion and activation in 21 patients with COVID-19 disease hospitalised in our hospital during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Slovakia. The results showed significant progressive lymphopenia and depletion of lymphocyte subsets (CD3(+), CD4(+), CD8(+) and CD19(+)) in correlation to the disease severity. Clinical recovery was associated with significant increase in CD3(+) and CD3(+)CD4(+) T-cells. Most of our patients had eosinopenia on admission, although no significant differences were seen among groups with different disease severity. Non-survivors, when compared to survivors, had significantly increased expression of PD-1 on CD4(+) and CD8(+) cells, but no significant difference in Tim-3 expression was observed, what suggests possible reversibility of immune paralysis in the most severe group of patients. During recovery, the expression of Tim-3 on both CD3(+)CD4(+) and CD3(+)CD8(+) cells significantly decreased. Moreover, patients with fatal outcome had significantly higher proportion of CD38(+)CD8(+) cells and lower proportion of CD38(+)HLA-DR(+)CD8(+) cells on admission. Clinical recovery was associated with significant decrease of proportion of CD38(+)CD8(+) cells. The highest AUC values within univariate and multivariate logistic regression were achieved for expression of CD38 on CD8(+) cells and expression of PD1 on CD4(+) cells alone or combined, what suggests, that these parameters could be used as potential biomarkers of poor outcome. The assessment of immune markers could help in predicting outcome and disease severity in COVID-19 patients. Our observations suggest, that apart from the degree of depletion of total lymphocytes and lymphocytes subsets, increased expression of CD38 on CD3(+)CD8(+) cells alone or combined with increased expression of PD-1 on CD3(+)CD4(+) cells, should be regarded as a risk factor of an unfavourable outcome in COVID-19 patients. Increased expression of PD-1 in the absence of an increased expression of Tim-3 on CD3(+)CD4(+) and CD3(+)CD8(+) cells suggests potential reversibility of ongoing immune paralysis in patients with the most severe course of COVID-19.","Bobcakova, Anna; Petriskova, Jela; Vysehradsky, Robert; Kocan, Ivan; Kapustova, Lenka; Barnova, Martina; Diamant, Zuzana; Jesenak, Milos",Front Cell Infect Microbiol,726,13

Recent studies on the potential long-term neurocognitive effects of cumulative propofol exposure have raised concerns about this practice. The recent pandemic introduced additional burdens to patients, with the requirement of a negative COVID-19 test prior to each sedated procedure. PROCEDURE: These factors prompted a quality improvement intervention at our institution where we aimed to reduce postinduction sedated LPs by 50%. Our intervention included patient and family education, followed by a simulation of the procedure for selected patients. Those converted to unsedated LPs were queried for their preference. Comparative cost, clinical time, and LP success rates were collected for sedated and unsedated LPs. RESULTS: Following the intervention, the percentage of LPs performed with sedation dropped from 100% to 48%. All LPs were successful using both techniques. Most patients who experienced the unsedated LP technique, and their guardians, strongly preferred this approach. Unsedated LPs significantly reduced clinical time (169 vs. 83 minutes) for families, decreased expenditures ($5736 reduction per procedure), and improved institutional opportunity cost due to a decrease in last-minute cancelations. CONCLUSION: We have shown that it is feasible to significantly reduce the use of sedation for LPs in patients with ALL, which has the potential to improve health and patient experience at a lower cost.","Waters, Torin W; Dickens, David S",Pediatr Blood Cancer,726,5

Objective: To estimate the prevalence of common mental health disorders in HCWs based in hospitals where pandemic-affected patients were treated. Method: Databases were searched for studies published before 30 March 2020. Quantitative synthesis was used to obtain estimates of the prevalence of mental health disorders in four time windows, determined a priori (the acute phase, i.e. during and up to 1.5 months post-pandemic; 1.5–5.9 months; 6–11.9 months; 12 months and later). Results: Nineteen studies met the review criteria. They predominantly addressed the acute phase of the SARS outbreak in Asia. The most studied outcomes were clinically significant post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) and general psychiatric caseness. For clinically significant PTSS in the acute phase, the prevalence estimate was 23.4% (95% CI 16.3, 31.2; N = 4147; I(2) = 96.2%); in the 12 months plus window, the estimate was 11.9% (8.4, 15.8; N = 1136; I(2) = 74.3%). For general psychiatric caseness, prevalence estimates were acute phase, 34.1% (18.7, 51.4; N = 3971; I(2) = 99.1%); 6–12 months, 17.9% (13.1, 23.2; N = 223; I(2) = 0.0%); 12 months plus, 29.3% (6.0, 61.0; N = 710; I(2) = 97.8%). No differences between doctors and nurses with respective to PTSS and general psychiatric caseness were apparent in the acute phase. Conclusions: Mental health disorders are particularly common in HCWs working with pandemic-afflicted patients immediately following a pandemic, but the course of disorders following this period is poorly understood. There was considerable heterogeneity between studies, likely linked to methodological differences. More extended follow up of HCWs is needed.","Allan, Sophie M.; Bealey, Rebecca; Birch, Jennifer; Cushing, Toby; Parke, Sheryl; Sergi, Georgina; Bloomfield, Michael; Meiser-Stedman, Richard",European journal of psychotraumatology,726,4

This study examined the prevalence of WPV and the associated factors and quality of life (QOL) among frontline mental health professionals during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This national survey was carried out between March 15 and March 20, 2020. WPV and QOL were assessed with standardized measures. RESULTS: A total of 10,516 participants were included. The prevalence of overall WPV was 18.5% (95% CI: 17.9–19.3%), while verbal abuse/threats was 15.8% and physical violence was 8.4%. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that male gender (OR=1.42, P<0.01), higher educational level (OR=1.40, P<0.01), working in tertiary hospitals (OR=1.33, P<0.01), caring for COVID-19 patients (OR=3.10, P<0.01) and having more severe anxiety symptom (OR=1.21, P<0.01) were positively associated with WPV. In contrast, working in inpatient departments (OR=0.74, P<0.01), having longer work experience (OR=0.99, P=0.03), and being a junior nurse (OR=0.73, P<0.01) were negatively associated with WPV. After controlling for the covariates, mental health professionals who experienced WPV had a lower overall QOL compared to those without WPV (F (1, 10515) =68.28, P<0.01). CONCLUSION: This study found that WPV was common among mental health professionals in China during the COVID-19 pandemic. Considering the negative impact of WPV on QOL and quality of patient care, appropriate measures to prevent WPV should be developed.","Xie, Xiaomeng; Zhao, Yanjie; An, Fengrong; Zhang, Qinge; Yu, Haiyang; Yuan, Zhen; Cheung, Teris; Ng, Chee H.; Xiang, Yu-Tao",J Psychiatr Res,726,20

As they are frequently associated with fever and elevation of C‐reactive protein or other signs of inflammation, they are mostly handled as pneumonia. However, the differential diagnosis is broad, and a causative microbial agent remains undetected in the majority of cases. Pulmonary side effects from cytotoxic treatment or pulmonary involvement by the underlying malignancy must always be taken into account and may provide grounds for invasive diagnostic procedures in selected patients. Pneumocystis jirovecii (in patients not receiving co‐trimoxazole as prophylaxis), multi‐resistant gram‐negative bacilli, mycobacteria or respiratory viruses may be involved. High‐risk patients may be infected by filamentous fungi, such as Aspergillus spp., but these infections are seldom proven when treatment is initiated. Microorganisms isolated from cultures of blood, bronchoalveolar lavage or respiratory secretions need careful interpretation as they may be irrelevant for determining the aetiology of pulmonary infiltrates, particularly when cultures yield coagulase‐negative staphylococci, enterococci or Candida species. Non‐culture based diagnostics for detecting Aspergillus galactomannan, beta‐D‐glucan or DNA from blood, bronchoalveolar lavage or tissue samples can facilitate the diagnosis, but must always be interpreted in the context of clinical and imaging findings. Systemic antifungal treatment with mould‐active agents, given in combination with broad‐spectrum antibiotics, improves clinical outcome when given pre‐emptively. Co‐trimoxazole remains the first‐line treatment for Pneumocystis pneumonia, while cytomegalovirus pneumonia will respond to ganciclovir or foscarnet in most cases. The clinical outcome of acute respiratory failure can also be successful with proper intensive care, when indicated.","Maschmeyer, Georg; Donnelly, J. Peter",Br J Haematol,726,5

Currently, there is limited research that focuses on the mechanisms of change within complex telepsychology platforms, a factor that makes designing and implementing outcome measures challenging. OBJECTIVE: This project aims to articulate a theory of change (ToC) for Kooth, a web-based therapy and support platform for CYP. METHODS: A collaborative qualitative research design involving professional staff, academic partners, and young people was used to develop the ToC. The following three major reflective phases were engaged: a scoping workshop involving professional staff and academic partners, a series of explorative projects were completed to inform the development of the ToC, and the draft ToC was reviewed for coherence by key stakeholders (young people, online professionals, and service managers). RESULTS: A collaboratively developed ToC was presented. This was divided into the conditions that lead to individuals wanting to access web-based therapy and support (eg, individuals wanting support there and then or quickly), the mode of service delivery (eg, skilled and experienced professionals able to build empathetic relationships with CYP), and the observed and reported changes that occur as a consequence of using the service (eg, individuals being better able to manage current and future situations). CONCLUSIONS: Developing the ToC helps to shed light on how web-based therapy and support services aid the mental health and well-being of CYP. Furthermore, it helps to understand the development of positive virtual ecosystems and can be used to devise evaluative tools for CYP telepsychology providers.","Hanley, Terry; Sefi, Aaron; Grauberg, Janet; Prescott, Julie; Etchebarne, Andre",JMIR Pediatr Parent,726,21

Our objective was to determine the perspectives of diagnostic radiology (DR), interventional radiology (IR), and nuclear medicine (NM) program directors (PDs) regarding pass/fail USMLE Step 1 scoring. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A survey composed of thirteen questions on a three-point Likert scale, five demographic questions, and a free-text question was distributed to 179 DR, 84 IR, and 34 NM PDs from ACGME-accredited residency programs. RESULTS: In total, 140 unique responses were obtained (response rate = 47.1%). The PD respondents had a male predominance of 79.1%, average age of 46 ± 7.2 years, and average tenure of 5.9 ± 5.2 years. A majority of PDs (69.6%) disagreed that the change is a good idea, and a minority (21.6%) believe the change will improve medical student well-being. Further, 90.7% of PDs believe a pass/fail format will make it more difficult to objectively compare applicants and most will place more emphasis on USMLE Step 2 scores and medical school reputation (89.3% and 72.7%, respectively). CONCLUSION: The lasting impact of pass/fail Step 1 scoring are uncertain and many radiology PDs do not support this change. While the central motivations to reduce the overemphasis on USMLE Step 1 performance and improve medical student well-being are admirable, it remains to be seen if pass/fail scoring will accomplish these goals.","MacKinnon, Grant E.; Payne, Sydney; Drolet, Brian C.; Motuzas, Cari",Acad Radiol,726,15

As a consequence, genomic RNA of the virus can be detected in wastewater. Although the presence of viral RNA does not inform on the infectivity of the virus, this presence of genetic material raised the question of the effectiveness of treatment processes in reducing the virus in wastewater and sludge. In this work, treatment lines of 16 wastewater treatment plants were monitored to evaluate the removal of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in raw, processed waters and sludge, from March to May 2020. Viral RNA copies were enumerated using reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) in 5 different laboratories. These laboratories participated in proficiency testing scheme and their results demonstrated the reliability and comparability of the results obtained for each one. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was found in 50.5% of the 101 influent wastewater samples characterized. Positive results were detected more frequently in those regions with a COVID-19 incidence higher than 100 cases per 100,000 inhabitants. Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) significantly reduced the occurrence of virus RNA along the water treatment lines. Secondary treatment effluents showed an occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in 23.3% of the samples and no positive results were found after MBR and chlorination. Non-treated sludge (from primary and secondary treatments) presented a higher occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA than the corresponding water samples, demonstrating the affinity of virus particles for solids. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in treated sludge after thickening and anaerobic digestion, whereas viral RNA was completely eliminated from sludge only when thermal hydrolysis was applied. Finally, co-analysis of SARS-CoV-2 and F-specific RNA bacteriophages was done in the same water and sludge samples in order to investigate the potential use of these bacteriophages as indicators of SARS-CoV-2 fate and reduction along the wastewater treatment.","Serra-Compte, Albert; González, Susana; Arnaldos, Marina; Berlendis, Sabrina; Courtois, Sophie; Loret, Jean Francois; Schlosser, Olivier; Yáñez, Adela M.; Soria-Soria, Elena; Fittipaldi, Mariana; Saucedo, Gemma; Pinar-Méndez, Anna; Paraira, Miquel; Galofré, Belén; Lema, Juan M.; Balboa, Sabela; Mauricio-Iglesias, Miguel; Bosch, Albert; Pintó, Rosa M.; Bertrand, Isabelle; Gantzer, Christophe; Montero, Carlos; Litrico, Xavier",Water Res,726,28

We hypothesized that fewer patients administered this combination would require oxygen therapy, intensive care support, or a combination of both than those who did not. METHODS: This was a cohort observational study of all consecutive hospitalized patients ≥50 y of age with COVID-19 in a tertiary academic hospital. Before April 6, 2020, no patients received the (DMB) combination. After this date, patients were administered 1000 IU/d oral vitamin D(3), 150 mg/d oral magnesium, and 500 mcg/d oral vitamin B(12) upon admission if they did not require oxygen therapy. Primary outcome was deterioration leading to any form of oxygen therapy, intensive care support, or both. RESULTS: Between January 15 and April 15, 2020, we identified 43 consecutive patients ≥50 y of age with COVID-19. Seventeen patients received DMB before onset of primary outcome and 26 patients did not. Baseline demographic characteristics between the two groups were significantly different by age. In univariate analysis, age and hypertension had a significant influence on outcome. After adjusting for age or hypertension separately in a multivariate analysis, the intervention group retained protective significance. Fewer treated patients than controls required initiation of oxygen therapy during hospitalization (17.6 vs 61.5%, P = 0.006). DMB exposure was associated with odds ratios of 0.13 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.03–0.59) and 0.20 (95% CI, 0.04–0.93) for oxygen therapy, intensive care support, or both on univariate and multivariate analyses, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: A vitamin D / magnesium / vitamin B(12) combination in older COVID-19 patients was associated with a significant reduction in the proportion of patients with clinical deterioration requiring oxygen support, intensive care support, or both.

We sought to determine the effect of a structured checklist on the quality of intraoperative change of shift handover between scrubs and circulars. METHODS: We conducted a control intervention study on operating room wards of two teaching hospitals from 20 Feb to 21 Nov 2020. This research was conducted in three stages as follows: assessing the current situation (as a group before the intervention), performing the intervention and evaluating the effect of using a checklist on handover quality after the intervention in two groups: with and without checklist. We examined the quality of handover between scrub and circular personnel in terms of handover duration and quality, omission of information and improvement in OR staff satisfaction. RESULTS: A total of 120 handovers were observed and evaluated. After intervention in the group using the checklist, the percentage of information omission in surgical report was decreased from 19.5 to 12.1% between scrubs (P < 0.00) and from 16.8 to 14.1% between circulars (P < 0.03). Also, in the role of scrub, the mean overall score of handover process quality was significantly higher after the intervention (x̄ = 7 ± 1.5) than before it (x̄ = 6.5 ± 0.9) (p < 0.02). In the role of circulating, despite the positive effect of overall score checklist, no significant difference was observed (p < 0.08). The use of checklist significantly increased the handover duration between scrubs (p < 0.03) and circulars (p < 0.00). The overall mean percentage of handover satisfaction increased from 67.5% before the intervention to 85.5% after the intervention (p < 0.00). CONCLUSION: The implementation of a new structured handover checklist had a positive impact on improving the quality of communication between the surgical team, reducing the information omission rate and increasing the satisfaction.","Nasiri, Ebrahim; Lotfi, Mojgan; Mahdavinoor, Seyyed Muhammad Mahdi; Rafiei, Mohammad Hossein",Patient Saf Surg,726,21

The open reading frame 5 (ORF5) protein is a newly discovered non-structural protein in PCV2, which the function in viral pathogenesis remains unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanism of PCV2 ORF5 protein on autophagy and viral replication. The pEGFP-tagged ORF5 gene was ectopic expressed in PK-15 cells and an ORF5-deficient PCV2 mutant strain (PCV2(ΔORF5)) were used to infected PK-15 cells. This study demonstrated that the ORF5 is essential for the of PCV2-induced autophagy. The ORF5 protein triggers the phosphorylation of PERK, eIF2α and the expression of downstream transcription factor ATF4. In addition, ORF5 protein activated the AMPK-ERK1/2-mTOR signaling pathways. These findings suggest that ORF5 play essential roles in the induction of autophagy by PCV2. We further revealed that PCV2 ORF5 promotes viral replication through PERK-eIF2α-ATF4 and AMPK-ERK1/2-mTOR pathways. In conclusion, we showed that PCV2 ORF5 induces autophagy to promote virus replication in PK-15 cells.","Lv, Jiangman; Jiang, Yanfen; Feng, Quanwen; Fan, Zhixin; Sun, Ying; Xu, Panpan; Hou, Yufeng; Zhang, Xiuping; Fan, Yuxin; Xu, Xingang; Zhang, Yanming; Guo, Kangkang",Front Microbiol,726,20

The rare disease population is at particular risk of being further marginalised during pandemics. In this study, our objective was to assess the hospital mortality patterns in the rare disease and the general populations during the coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) pandemics in Hong Kong. METHODS: All admission records during the COVID-19 pandemic (January 23–August 23, 2020) and SARS pandemic (March 11–June 30, 2003) were extracted from the local public healthcare database. Patients with rare diseases were identified using one or more of the 1084 10th version International Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10) codes cross-referenced with 467 ORPHAcodes. Hospital mortality patterns were compared in patients with and without COVID-19/SARS infection. Admission records during the same period in 2019 and 2002 were retrieved for comparison. RESULTS: During the COVID-19 pandemic, 407,219 patients were admitted to one or more of the 43 public hospitals in Hong Kong, of which, 13,894 were patients with rare diseases (3.4%). A total of 4381 and 77 patients from the general and rare disease populations were infected with COVID-19. Rare disease patients had an adjusted 3.4 times odds of COVID-19-related hospital mortality compared with that of the general population (95% C.I. 1.24–9.41). COVID-19-related mortality was almost exclusively seen in patients ≥ 60 years. While age-related increase in mortality was also observed for the general population during the SARS pandemic, the pattern observed in the rare disease population was significantly different, with a 12.5 times higher SARS-related mortality observed in rare disease patients ≤ 18 years than those in the general population (12.5% vs 1.0%). Patients admitted during the same pandemic periods without coronavirus infection had a significantly higher hospital mortality compared with those admitted one year before the pandemic (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: This population-based study demonstrated the differential impacts of the COVID-19 and SARS pandemics on the rare disease population. In the era of budget and resource scarcity, this study warrants cautious healthcare planning, with consideration of the rare disease population in healthcare prioritisation.","Chung, Claudia Ching Yan; Wong, Wilfred Hing Sang; Chung, Brian Hon Yin",Orphanet J Rare Dis,726,16

The pathogen severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a novel Betacoronavirus, was subsequently isolated as the causative agent. SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted by respiratory droplets and fomites and presents clinically with fever, fatigue, myalgias, conjunctivitis, anosmia, dysgeusia, sore throat, nasal congestion, cough, dyspnea, nausea, vomiting, and/or diarrhea. In most critical cases, symptoms can escalate into acute respiratory distress syndrome accompanied by a runaway inflammatory cytokine response and multiorgan failure. As of this article's publication date, COVID-19 has spread to approximately 200 countries and territories, with over 4.3 million infections and more than 290,000 deaths as it has escalated into a global pandemic. Public health concerns mount as the situation evolves with an increasing number of infection hotspots around the globe. New information about the virus is emerging just as rapidly. This has led to the prompt development of clinical patient risk stratification tools to aid in determining the need for testing, isolation, monitoring, ventilator support, and disposition. COVID-19 spread is rapid, including imported cases in travelers, cases among close contacts of known infected individuals, and community-acquired cases without a readily identifiable source of infection. Critical shortages of personal protective equipment and ventilators are compounding the stress on overburdened healthcare systems. The continued challenges of social distancing, containment, isolation, and surge capacity in already stressed hospitals, clinics, and emergency departments have led to a swell in technologically-assisted care delivery strategies, such as telemedicine and web-based triage. As the race to develop an effective vaccine intensifies, several clinical trials of antivirals and immune modulators are underway, though no reliable COVID-19-specific therapeutics (inclusive of some potentially effective single and multi-drug regimens) have been identified as of yet. With many nations and regions declaring a state of emergency, unprecedented quarantine, social distancing, and border closing efforts are underway. Implementation of social and physical isolation measures has caused sudden and profound economic hardship, with marked decreases in global trade and local small business activity alike, and full ramifications likely yet to be felt.

However, there are varying views on who should be transferred to LTACHs and when they should be transferred. The purpose of this study is to assess the relationship between length of stay in a short-term acute care hospital (STACH) after endotracheal intubation (time to LTACH) and weaning success and mortality for ventilated patients discharged to an LTACH. METHODS: Using 2014–2015 Medicare claims and assessment data, we identified patients who had an endotracheal intubation in STACH and transferred to an LTACH with prolonged mechanical ventilation (defined as 96 or more consecutive hours on a ventilator). We controlled for age, gender, STACH stay procedures and diagnoses, Elixhauser comorbid conditions, and LTACH quality characteristics. We used instrumental variable estimation to account for unobserved patient and provider characteristics. RESULTS: The study cohort included 13,622 LTACH cases with median time to LTACH of 18 days. The unadjusted ventilator weaning rate at LTACH was 51.7%, and unadjusted 90-day mortality rate was 43.7%. An additional day spent in STACH after intubation is associated with 11.6% reduction in the odds of weaning, representing a 2.5 percentage point reduction in weaning rate at 18 days post endotracheal intubation. We found no statistically significant relationship between time to LTACH and the odds of 90-day mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Discharging ventilated patients earlier from STACH to LTACH is associated with higher weaning probability for LTACH patients on prolonged mechanical ventilation. Our findings suggest that delaying ventilated patients’ discharge to LTACH may negatively influence the patients’ chances of being weaned from the ventilator.

Infodemic makes it hard for people to find trustworthy sources and reliable guidance when they need it, and causes social panic about health, widens the gaps between races and regions, and even brings the social chaos all over the world. While most researchers and related parties made efforts to control the inaccurate information spreading online during the COVID-19 pandemic, the infodemic influence caused by the overload of accurate information were almost or completely ignored, and this will hinder the control of infodemic in future public health crises. This study aims to explore the infodemic vs. pandemic influence on people's psychological anxiety across different media sources in the early stage of the COVID-19 outbreak in China. Methods: A cross-sectional study using online survey method was conducted by a data-collection service provider in April 2020. A total of 1,117 valid samples were finally collected from 5,203 randomly invited members via webpages and WeChat. The sample distribution covered the 30 provincial administrative divisions of mainland China. Results: Hierarchical regression analysis for the potential pandemic sources and infodemic sources of psychological anxiety showed that the infodemic factors of attention to the coronavirus information (β = 0.154, p < 0.001) and commercial media exposure (β = 0.147, p < 0.001) is positively related to the level of anxiety. Statistics indicated that influence of the infodemic factors is over and above that of the pandemic factors (ΔR(2) = 0.054, F = 14.199, and p < 0.001). Mediation analysis showed that information overload (B = 0.155, Boot SE = 0.022, and 95% Boot CI [0.112, 0.198]) mediates the link between attention to coronavirus information and anxiety; both information overload (B = 0.035, Boot SE = 0.014, and 95% Boot CI [0.009, 0.062]) and media vicarious traumatization (B = 0.106, Boot SE = 0.017, and 95% Boot CI [0.072, 0.140]) mediate the link between commercial media exposure and anxiety. Conclusion: This study suggested that the influence of infodemic with mixed accurate and inaccurate information on public anxiety does exist, which could possibly go beyond that of the pandemic. Information overload and vicarious traumatization explain how infodemic may be associated to public anxiety. Finally, commercial media could be a major source of infodemic in the Chinese media context. Implications for the related parties were discussed.","Xu, Jian; Liu, Cong",Front Public Health,726,20

All sources were reviewed by a panel of experts using a Delphi method with a modified nominal-group technique. RESULTS: Fifty-two articles were reviewed for their results and level of evidence regarding barrier device feasibility, advantages, protection against droplets and aerosols, effectiveness, safety, ergonomics, and cleaning/disposal. The majority of analysed papers were expert opinion, small case-series, technical descriptions, small-sample simulation studies, and pre-print proofs. CONCLUSIONS: The use of barrier-enclosure devices adds to the complexity of airway procedures with potential adverse consequences, especially during airway emergencies. Concerns include limitations on the ability to perform airway interventions and the aid that can be delivered by an assistant, patient injuries, compromise of PPE integrity, lack of evidence for added protection of healthcare providers including secondary aerosolization upon barrier removal, and lack of cleaning standards. Enclosure barriers for airway management are no substitute for adequate PPE, and their use should be avoided until adequate validation studies can be reported.","Sorbello, Massimiliano; Rosenblatt, William; Hofmeyr, Ross; Greif, Robert; Urdaneta, Felipe",Br J Anaesth,726,26

We conducted this retrospective case-control observational study with the hypothesis that low serum albumin at presentation can predict serious outcomes in COVID-19 infection. METHODS: We included severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) confirmed, hospitalized patients from March to July 2020 in a tertiary care hospital in the USA. Patients were followed for 21 days for the development of the primary endpoint defined as the composite outcome which included acute encephalopathy, acute kidney injury, the requirement of new renal replacement therapy, acute hypercoagulability, acute circulatory failure, new-onset heart failure, acute cardiac injury, acute arrhythmia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), high flow oxygen support, intensive care unit (ICU) stay, mechanical ventilation or death; and the secondary endpoint of death only. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to study the effect of albumin level and outcomes. RESULTS: The mean age was 56.76 years vs. 55.67 years (P = 0.68) in the normal albumin vs. the low albumin group. We noticed an inverse relationship between serum albumin at presentation and serious outcomes. The low albumin group had a higher composite outcome (93.88% vs. 6.12%, P < 0.05) and higher mortality (13.87% vs. 2.38%, P < 0.05) in comparison to the normal albumin group. The multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed higher odds of having composite outcomes with lower albumin group (odds ratio (OR) 10.88, 95% confidence interval (CI) 4.74 - 24.97, P < 0.05). In the subgroup analysis, the multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed higher odds of having composite outcomes with the very low albumin group (OR 7.94, 95% CI 1.70 - 37.14, P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Low serum albumin on presentation in COVID-19 infection is associated with serious outcomes not limited to mortality. The therapeutic option of albumin infusion should be investigated.","Acharya, Roshan; Poudel, Dilli; Bowers, Riley; Patel, Aakash; Schultz, Evan; Bourgeois, Michael; Paswan, Rishi; Stockholm, Scott; Batten, Macelyn; Kafle, Smita; Lonial, Kriti; Locklear, Irlene",J Clin Med Res,726,16

Employing techniques borrowed from data journalism, it develops a form of cross-platform analysis that is attuned to both commensurability as well as platform specificity. It analyses the most engaged-with or top-ranked political content on seven online platforms: TikTok, 4chan, Reddit, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and Google Web Search. Discussing the extent to which social media platforms marginalize mainstream media and mainstream the fringe, the analyses found that TikTok parodies mainstream media, 4chan and Reddit dismiss it and direct users to alternative influencer networks and extreme YouTube content. Twitter prefers the hyperpartisan over it. Facebook’s “fake news” problem also concerns declining amounts of mainstream media referenced. Instagram has influencers (rather than, say, experts) dominating user engagement. By comparison, Google Web Search buoys the liberal mainstream (and sinks conservative sites), but generally gives special interest sources, as they were termed in the study, the privilege to provide information rather than official sources. The piece concludes with a discussion of source and “platform criticism”, concerning how online platforms are seeking to filter the content that is posted or found there through increasing editorial intervention. These “editorial epistemologies”, applied especially around COVID-19 keywords, are part of an expansion of so-called content moderation to what I call “serious queries”, or keywords that return official information. Other epistemological strategies for editorially moderating the misinformation problem are also treated.","Rogers, Richard",Front Big Data,726,11

There is controversy regarding risk factors for severe COVID-19 disease. It has been suggested that asthma and allergy are not highly represented as co-morbid conditions associated with COVID-19. Objective To extend our work in interleukin (IL)-13 biology to determine if airway epithelial cell expression of two key mediators critical for SARS-CoV-2 infection, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2) are modulated by IL-13. Methods We determined effects of IL-13 treatment on ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression ex vivo in primary airway epithelial cells from participants with and without type 2 asthma obtained by bronchoscopy. We also examined expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in two datasets containing gene expression data from nasal and airway epithelial cells from children and adults with asthma and allergic rhinitis. Results IL-13 significantly reduced ACE2 and increased TMPRSS2 expression ex vivo in airway epithelial cells. In two independent datasets, ACE2 expression was significantly reduced and TMPRSS2 was significantly increased in the nasal and airway epithelial cells in type 2 asthma and allergic rhinitis. ACE2 expression was significantly negatively associated with type 2 cytokines while TMPRSS2 expression was significantly positively associated with type 2 cytokines. Conclusion IL-13 modulates ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression in airway epithelial cells in asthma. This deserves further study with regard to any effects asthma and atopy may render in the setting of COVID-19 infection.","Kimura, Hiroki; Francisco, Dave; Conway, Michelle; Martinez, Fernando D.; Vercelli, Donata; Polverino, Francesca; Billheimer, Dean; Kraft, Monica",J Allergy Clin Immunol,726,16

We aimed to assess the effects of a favipiravir and hydroxychloroquine combination on treating moderate-to-severe COVID-19 patients. METHODS: An investigator-initiated, multicenter, open-label, randomized trial at nine hospitals. Eligible patients were adults with moderate-to-severe COVID-19 defined as oxygen saturation (SaO(2)) of ≤ 94% while breathing ambient air or significant clinical symptoms with chest x-ray changes requiring hospital admission. Randomization was in a 1:1 ratio to receive standard care (control group) or standard care plus favipiravir and hydroxychloroquine. The primary outcome was time to clinical improvement of two points (from the status at randomization) on a seven-category ordinal scale or live discharge from the hospital within 14 days. Analyses were done in an intention-to-treat population. RESULTS: From May 2020 to Jan 2021, 254 patients were enrolled; 129 were assigned to standard of care and 125 to the treatment. The mean age was 52 (± 13) years, and 103 (41%) were women. At randomization, six patients were on invasive mechanical ventilation, 229 (90.15%) were requiring supplemental oxygen only (with or without non-invasive ventilation), and 19 (7.48%) were receiving neither. The time to clinical improvement was not significantly different between the groups: median of 9 days in the treatment group and 7 days in the control group (HR: 0.845; 95% CI 0.617–1.157; p-value = 0.29). The 28-day mortality was not significantly different between the groups (7.63% treatment) vs. (10.32% control); p-value = 0.45. The most prevalent adverse events were headache, elevation in ALT, and the prolonged QTc interval in the treatment group. CONCLUSION: The combination of favipiravir and hydroxychloroquine did not result in a statistically significant clinical benefit in patients with moderate-to-severe COVID-19.

However, studies exploring the ecological interaction between lyssaviruses and their natural hosts are scarce. This study completes our active surveillance work on Spanish bat colonies that began in 1992. Herein, we analyzed ecological factors that might affect the infection dynamics observed in those colonies. Between 2001 and 2011, we collected and tested 2,393 blood samples and 45 dead bats from 25 localities and 20 bat species. The results for dead confirmed the presence of EBLV-1 RNA in six species analyzed (for the first time in Myotis capaccinii). Samples positive for European bat lyssavirus-1 (EBLV-1)–neutralizing antibodies were detected in 68% of the localities sampled and in 13 bat species, seven of which were found for the first time (even in Myotis daubentonii, a species to date always linked to EBLV-2). EBLV-1 seroprevalence (20.7%) ranged between 11.1 and 40.2% among bat species and seasonal variation was observed, with significantly higher antibody prevalence in summer (July). EBLV-1 seroprevalence was significantly associated with colony size and species richness. Higher seroprevalence percentages were found in large multispecific colonies, suggesting that intra- and interspecific contacts are major risk factors for EBLV-1 transmission in bat colonies. Although bat-roosting behavior strongly determines EBLV-1 variability, we also found some evidence that bat phylogeny might be involved in bat-species seroprevalence. The results of this study highlight the importance of life history and roost ecology in understanding EBLV-1–prevalence patterns in bat colonies and also provide useful information for public health officials.","Serra-Cobo, Jordi; López-Roig, Marc; Seguí, Magdalena; Sánchez, Luisa Pilar; Nadal, Jacint; Borrás, Miquel; Lavenir, Rachel; Bourhy, Hervé",PLoS One,726,1

Despite consistent increases in LE for both males and females in Ethiopia, the country has simultaneously witnessed an increasing discrepancy in LE between males and females. METHODS: This study used Pollard’s actuarial method of decomposing LE to compare age- and cause- specific contributions to changes in sex differences in LE between 1995 and 2015 in Ethiopia. RESULTS: Life expectancy at birth in Ethiopia increased for both males and females from 48.28 years and 50.12 years in 1995 to 65.59 years and 69.11 years in 2015, respectively. However, the sex differences in LE at birth also increased from 1.85 years in 1995 to 3.51 years in 2015. Decomposition analysis shows that the higher male mortality was consistently due to injuries and respiratory infections, which contributed to 1.57 out of 1.85 years in 1995 and 1.62 out of 3.51 years in 2015 of the sex differences in LE. Increased male mortality from non-communicable diseases (NCDs) also contributed to the increased difference in LE between males and females over the period, accounting for 0.21 out of 1.85 years and 1.05 out of 3.51 years in 1995 and 2015, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: While injuries and respiratory infections causing male mortality were the most consistent causes of the sex differences in LE in Ethiopia, morality from NCDs is the main cause of the recent increasing differences in LE between males and females. However, unlike the higher exposure of males to death from injuries due to road traffic injuries or interpersonal violence, to what extent sex differences are caused by the higher male mortality compared to female mortality from respiratory infection diseases is unclear. Similarly, despite Ethiopia’s weak social security system, an explanation for the increased sex differences after the age of 40 years due to either longer female LE or reduced male LE should be further investigated.

Travelers belonged to those primarily affected in the early stages of the outbreak, travelers became vectors of the disease, and finally, travel and tourism themselves became the victims. The outbreak of SARS created international anxiety because of its novelty, its ease of transmission in certain settings, and the speed of its spread through jet travel, combined with extensive media coverage. The psychological impacts of SARS, coupled with travel restrictions imposed by various national and international authorities, have diminished international travel in 2003, far beyond the limitations to truly SARS hit areas. Governments and press, especially in non SARS affected areas, have been slow to strike the right balance between timely and frequent risk communication and placing risk in the proper context. Screening at airport entry points is costly, has a low yield and is not sufficient in itself. The low yield in detecting SARS is most likely due to a combination of factors, such as travel advisories which resulted in reduced travel to and from SARS affected areas, implementation of effective pre-departure screening at airports in SARS-hit countries, and a rapid decline in new cases at the time when screening was finally introduced. Rather than investing in airport screening measures to detect rare infectious diseases, investments should be used to strengthen screening and infection control capacities at points of entry into the healthcare system. If SARS reoccurs, the subsequent outbreak will be smaller and more easily contained if the lessons learnt from the recent epidemic are applied. Lessons learnt during the outbreak in relation to international travel will be discussed.","Wilder-Smith, Annelies",Travel Med Infect Dis,726,0

It can also cause serious mortality in farmed whiteleg shrimp, Penaeus (Litopenaeus) vannamei. However, there is no published information on the economic and/or production impact of the disease in P. vannamei. Shrimp with gross signs of YHV disease (faded body colour and 60–70% mortality) were observed in 20 study farms rearing P. vannamei in the central part of Thailand from the end of 2007 through early 2008. The estimated economic loss for these farms according to the Thai Animal Aquaculture Association was approximately US$3 million. Detailed sequence analysis of RT‐PCR amplicons from shrimp in all the study ponds revealed the presence of YHV Type 1b (YHV‐1b) alone (characterized by a 162‐bp deletion in the ORF3 region encoding the structural gene for gp116) and the absence of YHV Type 1a (YHV‐1a), the original YHV type reported from Thailand. Despite the large 162‐bp deletion (= 54 deduced amino acids) in the gp116 structural gene, histopathology of YHV‐1b infections was identical to that of YHV‐1a infections, and electron microscopy revealed that YHV‐1b virions were morphologically indistinguishable from those previously reported for YHV‐1a. In addition, an existing commercial RT‐PCR detection kit and an immunochromatographic test strip for the detection of YHV were proven to have been valid tests for both YHV‐1b and YHV‐1a. The source of the virus for these outbreaks was unlikely to have been the post‐larvae used to stock the ponds, as they were derived from domesticated specific pathogen‐free stocks free of YHV. Thus, it is possible that they originated from an unknown, natural reservoir.","Senapin, S; Thaowbut, Y; Gangnonngiw, W; Chuchird, N; Sriurairatana, S; Flegel, T W",J Fish Dis,726,24

However, radiologists have to distinguish COVID-19 pneumonia from other pneumonia in a large number of CT scans, which is tedious and inefficient. Thus, it is urgently and clinically needed to develop an efficient and accurate diagnostic tool to help radiologists to fulfill the difficult task. In this study, we proposed a deep supervised autoencoder (DSAE) framework to automatically identify COVID-19 using multi-view features extracted from CT images. To fully explore features characterizing CT images from different frequency domains, DSAE was proposed to learn the latent representation by multi-task learning. The proposal was designed to both encode valuable information from different frequency features and construct a compact class structure for separability. To achieve this, we designed a multi-task loss function, which consists of a supervised loss and a reconstruction loss. Our proposed method was evaluated on a newly collected dataset of 787 subjects including COVID-19 pneumonia patients, other pneumonia patients, and normal subjects without abnormal CT findings. Extensive experimental results demonstrated that our proposed method achieved encouraging diagnostic performance and may have potential clinical application for the diagnosis of COVID-19.","Cheng, Jianhong; Zhao, Wei; Liu, Jin; Xie, Xingzhi; Wu, Shangjie; Liu, Liangliang; Yue, Hailin; Li, Junjian; Wang, Jianxin; Liu, Jun",IEEE/ACM transactions on computational biology and bioinformatics,726,26

Methods 93 patients with COVID-19 were divided into mild and severe groups. The data of lymphocyte subgroups and cytokines were collected, the imaging characteristics were measured and correlation analysis was performed to analyze the differences. Results 60 mild and 33 severe patients were included, Lymphocyte subsets decreased in both groups. The percentages of reduction of absolute lymphocytes value in mild and severe groups were 32% and 64% respectively. The lung CT lesion volume of all patients was 241.45 ± 282.92 cm3, among which the mild group was 151.29 ± 226.04 cm3 and the severe group was 405.38 ± 304.90 cm3, respectively. In critically ill patients, the decrease of absolute value of CD4 + T cells and increase of IL-6 level are significantly correlated with the volume of lung lesions. Conclusions The absolute values of CD3+, CD4+, and CD8 + T cells are lower in patients with COVID-19, the levels of IL-6 and IL-10 are increased. The severity of lung lesions predicts poor clinical outcomes and may be a predictor of the transition from mild to severe.","He, Susu; Zhou, Chao; Lu, Dongqing; Yang, Haihua; XU, Hailing; Wu, Guixian; Pan, Weijia; Zhu, Rui; Jia, HaiJian; Tang, Xinni; Chen, Xi; Wu, Xiaomai",Int J Infect Dis,726,1

OBJECTIVES: Our objective was to investigate whether deficient antibiotics knowledge could contribute to nonadherence in a community with high prevalence of antibiotics resistance. METHODS: We recruited 465 people by random sampling from 5 urban areas in Hong Kong. A structured questionnaire was used to assess antibiotics knowledge and adherence. Adherence was defined as completing the most recent course of antibiotics entirely according to physicians’ instructions. An antibiotics knowledge score ranging from 0 to 3 (highest) was composed based on the number of correctly answered questions. RESULTS: Of the 465 participants interviewed, 96.3% had heard of the term “antibiotics,” and 80.6% recalled having previously received antibiotics prescription. Among the eligible 369 subjects, 32.9% showed nonadherence. Percentages of participants with antibiotics knowledge scores of 0, 1, 2, and 3 were 11%, 27%, 33%, and 29%, respectively. There was a higher prevalence of nonadherence among people with lower antibiotics knowledge score (P < .001). Furthermore, people with nonadherence had a significantly lower mean antibiotics knowledge score (1.3 ± 1.0 versus 2.0 ± 0.9, P < .001), with no interaction with education (P < .05). Adjusted for potential confounders, antibiotics knowledge scores of 2, 1, and 0 independently predicted increased risk of nonadherence by 1-fold (odds ratio [OR], 2.00; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.01-3.94; P = .047), 4-fold (OR, 4.77; 95% CI: 2.30-9.92; P < .001), and 17-fold (OR, 18.41; 95% CI: 6.92-48.97; P < .001) respectively, compared with the maximum score of 3.

A cross-sectional study using a Web-based survey was conducted. A total of 2922 completed responses were received (response rate 55.7%). A total of 58.4% (95% CI 56.6–60.2) reported high turnover intention (score of 7–15). The odds of higher total turnover score among the fifth-year students was nearly four times that of first-year students (OR = 3.88, 95% CI 2.62–5.73). Perception of the medical profession as not being of high social status and reputation significantly influenced high turnover intention scores (OR = 2.26, 95% CI 1.90–2.68). All three dimensions of the multidimensional scale of perceived social support (MSPSS) significantly predict turnover intention. Lower scores in the support from Significant Other (OR = 1.47, 95% CI 1.17–1.84), Family (OR = 1.47, 95% CI 1.18–1.83) and Friend (OR = 1.42, 95% CI 1.14–1.77) subscales were associated with higher turnover intention. Low score in the Brief Resilience Scale (BRS) was also associated with higher turnover intention (OR = 1.44, 95% CI 1.17–1.77).

In recent years, enhanced understanding of the pathogenesis of psoriasis, especially the role of T helper 17 cells, has resulted in the development of new classes of biologic drugs targeting modulators along its disease pathway. Among these, inhibitors of interleukin-23 (e.g., ustekinumab, guselkumab, tildrakizumab, and risankizumab) have emerged as safe and effective options for the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis; ustekinumab and guselkumab have additionally been approved to treat psoriatic arthritis. Selective interleukin-23 inhibitors require less frequent dosing than interleukin-17 inhibitors and may possess a more favorable risk profile without an increased risk of candidiasis or inflammatory bowel disease. Overall, these highly effective medications are contributing to a rising standard for psoriasis outcomes through resolution of skin lesions and joint manifestations and improvement of patient quality of life.","Yang, Kevin; Oak, Allen S.

The practice of empiric antimicrobial prescription, due to limited diagnostic capabilities of many hospitals, has the potential to escalate an already worrisome antimicrobial resistance (AMR) situation in India. This study reports the prevalence and profiles of secondary infections (SIs) and clinical outcomes in hospitalized COVID-19 patients in India. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective study of secondary infections in patients admitted in intensive care units (ICUs) and wards of ten hospitals of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) AMR surveillance network, between June and August 2020, was undertaken. The demographic data, time of infection after admission, microbiological and antimicrobial resistance data of secondary infections, and clinical outcome data of the admitted COVID-19 patients were collated. RESULTS: Out of 17,534 admitted patients, 3.6% of patients developed secondary bacterial or fungal infections. The mortality among patients who developed secondary infections was 56.7% against an overall mortality of 10.6% in total admitted COVID-19 patients. Gram-negative bacteria were isolated from 78% of patients. Klebsiella pneumoniae (29%) was the predominant pathogen, followed by Acinetobacter baumannii (21%). Thirty-five percent of patients reported polymicrobial infections, including fungal infections. High levels of carbapenem resistance was seen in A. baumannii (92.6%) followed by K. pneumoniae (72.8%). CONCLUSION: Predominance of Gram-negative pathogens in COVID-19 patients coupled with high rates of resistance to higher generation antimicrobials is an alarming finding. A high rate of mortality in patients with secondary infections warrants extra caution to improve the infection control practices and practice of antimicrobial stewardship interventions not only to save patient lives but also prevent selection of drug-resistant infections, to which the current situation is very conducive.","Vijay, Sonam; Bansal, Nitin; Rao, Brijendra Kumar; Veeraraghavan, Balaji; Rodrigues, Camilla; Wattal, Chand; Goyal, Jagdish Prasad; Tadepalli, Karuna; Mathur, Purva; Venkateswaran, Ramanathan; Venkatasubramanian, Ramasubramanian; Khadanga, Sagar; Bhattacharya, Sanjay; Mukherjee, Sudipta; Baveja, Sujata; Sistla, Sujatha; Panda, Samiran; Walia, Kamini",Infect Drug Resist,726,20

The purposes of this study were to assess the prevalence of psychiatric symptoms among pregnant women, and to compare them with non-pregnant women. From February 28 to March 12, 2020, a cross-sectional study of pregnant and non-pregnant women was performed in China. The online questionnaire was used to collect information of participants. The mental health status was assessed by patient health questionnaire, generalized anxiety disorder scale, insomnia severity index, somatization subscale of the symptom checklist 90, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) checklist-5. Totally, 859 respondents were enrolled, including 544 pregnant women and 315 non-pregnant women. In this study, 5.3%, 6.8%, 2.4%, 2.6%, and 0.9% of pregnant women were identified to have symptoms of depression, anxiety, physical discomfort, insomnia, and PTSD, respectively.

There are however a growing number of female gamers and we need to learn more about how gender affects gaming. The aim of this study is to both quantify gaming among Norwegian adolescents and explore how gender differences are perceived. A mixed method approach was used to capture gaming experiences among boys and girls. Survey data (N = 5607) was analyzed descriptively, and five focus groups were conducted, applying thematic analysis. Statistics showed that boys from the age of 14 use video games up to 5 times more than girls, while girls are much more on social media. From the focus groups, we found that boys did not view social media as socially significant as gaming and that there is a greater social acceptance of gaming among boys than among girls. Gender differences in video gaming are not necessarily a problem per se, as they may reflect gender-specific motivations and interests. However, the study also finds that girls feel less encouraged than boys to play video games due to different gender-related experiences of video gaming.

We previously demonstrated that residues 377–588 of MERS-CoV spike (S) protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) is a very promising MERS subunit vaccine candidate, capable of inducing potent neutralization antibody responses. In this study, we sought to identify an adjuvant that optimally enhanced the immunogenicity of S377–588 protein fused with Fc of human IgG (S377–588-Fc). Specifically, we compared several commercially available adjuvants, including Freund's adjuvant, aluminum, Monophosphoryl lipid A, Montanide ISA51 and MF59 with regard to their capacity to enhance the immunogenicity of this subunit vaccine. In the absence of adjuvant, S377–588-Fc alone induced readily detectable neutralizing antibody and T-cell responses in immunized mice. However, incorporating an adjuvant improved its immunogenicity. Particularly, among the aforementioned adjuvants evaluated, MF59 is the most potent as judged by its superior ability to induce the highest titers of IgG, IgG1 and IgG2a subtypes, and neutralizing antibodies. The addition of MF59 significantly augmented the immunogenicity of S377–588-Fc to induce strong IgG and neutralizing antibody responses as well as protection against MERS-CoV infection in mice, suggesting that MF59 is an optimal adjuvant for MERS-CoV RBD-based subunit vaccines.","Zhang, Naru; Channappanavar, Rudragouda; Ma, Cuiqing; Wang, Lili; Tang, Jian; Garron, Tania; Tao, Xinrong; Tasneem, Sumaiya; Lu, Lu; Tseng, Chien-Te K; Zhou, Yusen; Perlman, Stanley; Jiang, Shibo; Du, Lanying",Cell Mol Immunol,726,1

At Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK), we have integrated and systematized health-related values discussions led by oncology nurses for newly diagnosed cancer patients as part of routine comprehensive cancer care. Such conversations include not only the patient’s wishes for care at the end of life but also more holistic personal values, including sources of strength, concerns, hopes, and their definition of an acceptable quality of life. In addition, health care providers use a structured template to document their discussions of patient goals of care. OBJECTIVE: To provide ready access to key information about the patient as a person with individual values, goals, and preferences, we undertook the creation of the Patient Values Tab in our center’s EHR to display this information in a single, central location. Here, we describe the interprofessional, interdisciplinary, iterative process and user-centered design methodology that we applied to build this novel functionality as well as our initial implementation experience and plans for evaluation. METHODS: We first convened a working group of experts from multiple departments, including medical oncology, health informatics, information systems, nursing informatics, nursing education, and supportive care, and a user experience designer. We conducted in-depth, semistructured, audiorecorded interviews of over 100 key stakeholders. The working group sought consensus on the tab’s main content, homing in on high-priority areas identified by the stakeholders. The core content was mapped to various EHR data sources. We established a set of high-level design principles to guide our process. Our user experience designer then created wireframes of the tab design. The designer conducted usability testing with physicians, nurses, and other health professionals. Data validation testing was conducted. RESULTS: We have already deployed the Patient Values Tab to a pilot sample of users in the MSK Gastrointestinal Medical Oncology Service, including physicians, advanced practice providers, nurses, and administrative staff. We have early evidence of the positive impact of this EHR innovation. Audit logs show increasing use. Many of the initial user comments have been enthusiastically positive, while others have provided constructive suggestions for additional tab refinements with respect to format and content. CONCLUSIONS: It is our challenge and obligation to enrich the EHR with information about the patient as a person. Realization of this capability is a pressing public health need requiring the collaboration of technological experts with a broad range of clinical leaders, users, patients, and families to achieve solutions that are both principled and practical. Our new Patient Values Tab represents a step forward in this important direction.","Desai, Anjali Varma; Michael, Chelsea L; Kuperman, Gilad J; Jordan, Gregory; Mittelstaedt, Haley; Epstein, Andrew S; Connor, MaryAnn; B Villar, Rika Paula; Bernal, Camila; Kramer, Dana; Davis, Mary Elizabeth; Chen, Yuxiao; Malisse, Catherine; Markose, Gigi; Nelson, Judith E",J Med Internet Res,726,20

Are central and peripheral haemodynamics during handgrip exercise different in young adults 3–4 weeks following infection with of SARS‐CoV‐2 compared with young healthy adults. What is the main finding and its importance? Exercising heart rate was higher while brachial artery blood flow and vascular conductance were lower in the SARS‐CoV‐2 compared with the control group. These findings provide evidence for peripheral impairments to exercise among adults with SARS‐CoV‐2, which may contribute to exercise limitations. ABSTRACT: The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) can have a profound impact on vascular function. While exercise intolerance may accompany a variety of symptoms associated with SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, the impact of SARS‐CoV‐2 on exercising blood flow (BF) remains unclear. Central (photoplethysmography) and peripheral (Doppler ultrasound) haemodynamics were determined at rest and during rhythmic handgrip (HG) exercise at 30% and 45% of maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) in young adults with mild symptoms 25 days after testing positive for SARS‐CoV‐2 (SARS‐CoV‐2: n = 8M/5F; age: 21 ± 2 years; height: 176 ± 11 cm; mass: 71 ± 11 kg) and were cross‐sectionally compared with control subjects (Control: n = 8M/5F; age: 27 ± 6 years; height: 178 ± 8 cm; mass: 80 ± 25 kg). Systolic blood pressure, end systolic arterial pressure and rate pressure product were higher in the SARS‐CoV‐2 group during exercise at 45% MVC compared with controls. Brachial artery BF was lower in the SARS‐CoV‐2 group at both 30% MVC (Control: 384.8 ± 93.3 ml min(–1); SARS‐CoV‐2: 307.8 ± 105.0 ml min(–1); P = 0.041) and 45% MVC (Control: 507.4 ± 109.9 ml min(–1); SARS‐CoV‐2: 386.3 ± 132.5 ml min(–1); P = 0.002). Brachial artery vascular conductance was lower at both 30% MVC (Control: 3.93 ± 1.07 ml min(–1) mmHg(–1); SARS‐CoV‐2: 3.11 ± 0.98 ml min(–1) mmHg(–1); P = 0.022) and 45% MVC (Control: 4.74 ± 1.02 ml min(–1) mmHg(–1); SARS‐CoV‐2: 3.46 ± 1.10 ml min(–1) mmHg(–1); P < 0.001) in the SARS‐CoV‐2 group compared to control group. The shear‐induced dilatation of the brachial artery increased similarly across exercise intensities in the two groups, suggesting the decrease in exercising BF may be due to microvascular impairments. Brachial artery BF is attenuated during HG exercise in young adults recently diagnosed with mild SARS‐CoV‐2, which may contribute to diminished exercise capacity among those recovering from SARS‐CoV‐2 like that seen in severe cases.","Stute, Nina L.; Stickford, Abigail S.

Methods: Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs were collected from suspected coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients and tested by RT-PCR and GenBody Rapid antigen kit. Performance characteristic of the antigen kit was calculated. Results: We tested nasopharyngeal swabs and oropharyngeal swabs (n=240). Amongst the 102 positive RT-PCR samples, the rapid antigen test detected 36 as positive, showing an overall sensitivity of 35.3%. All the samples detected positive with the antigen rapid test were also detected positive by RT-PCR. Conclusion: The performance of the rapid antigen kit was good with respect to high viral load samples, whereas those with lower levels were missed. Unfortunately, the overall low sensitivity of the antigen kit does not allow using it alone as the frontline testing kit for COVID-19 diagnosis.","Singh, Arpana; Gupta, Pratima; Mathuria, Yogendra P; Kalita, Deepjyoti; Prasad, Amber; Panda, Prasan K; Bahurupi, Yogesh; Sahoo, Biswajeet; Omar, Balram Ji",Cureus,726,26

Today, virtual health coaching systems can play a pivotal role in supporting older adults’ active and healthy ageing. This study wants to answer two research questions: (1) What are the user requirements of a virtual coach (VC) based on an Embodied Conversational Agent (ECA) for motivating older adults in transition to retirement to adopt a healthy lifestyle? (2) How could a VC address the active and healthy ageing dimensions, even during COVID-19 times? Methods: Two-wave focus-groups with 60 end-users aged 55 and over and 27 follow-up telephone interviews were carried out in Austria, Italy and the Netherlands in 2019–2020. Qualitative data were analysed by way of framework analysis. Results: End-users suggest the VC should motivate older workers and retirees to practice physical activity, maintain social contacts and emotional well-being. The ECA should be reactive, customizable, expressive, sympathetic, not directive nor patronizing, with a pleasant and motivating language. The COVID-19 outbreak increased the users’ need for functions boosting community relationships and promoting emotional well-being. Conclusions: the VC can address the active and healthy ageing paradigm by increasing the chances of doing low-cost healthy activities at any time and in any place.","Santini, Sara; Stara, Vera; Galassi, Flavia; Merizzi, Alessandra; Schneider, Cornelia; Schwammer, Sabine; Stolte, Elske; Kropf, Johannes",Int J Environ Res Public Health,726,16

To better elucidate the major histocompatibility complex background and to facilitate the experimental use of cynomolgus macaques, Mafa-B, Mafa-DQB1, and Mafa-DRB alleles were characterized and their combinations were investigated from 30 macaques of Vietnamese origin by cloning and sequencing. A total of 48 Mafa-B, 22 Mafa-DQB1, and 42 Mafa-DRB alleles, were detected in this study, respectively. In addition, two Mafa-DQB1 and eight Mafa-DRB alleles represented novel sequences that had not been documented in earlier studies. Our results also showed that the macaque from Vietnam might be valuable because >30% of the test animals possessed Mafa-DRB*w304 (30%) and -DQB1*0616 (30%). We report that the combination of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and II alleles, including the combination of DRB3*0403-DRB*w304, DRB1*1013-DRB*w304, and Mafa-B*007:01:01-DRB*w304, which was in 17%, 13%, and 13% of the animals, respectively. Interesting, more than two Mafa-DQB1 alleles detected in one animal in this study suggest that Mafa-DQB1, like Mafa-DRB, might be a duplication in the chromosome, which have ever been documented in cynomolgus monkeys but has not yet been observed in rhesus macaques or other primates. Our results for the high frequency of commonly co-occurring MHC alleles across loci in a cohort of the Vietnamese cynomolgus macaque emphasized the value of this species as a model for biomedical research.","Ling, Fei; Zhuo, Min; Ni, Chao; Zhang, Gui-qing; Wang, Tao; Li, Wai; Wei, Li-qiong; Du, Hong-li; Wang, Ju-fang; Wang, Xiao-ning",Hum Immunol,726,15

Myriad host kinases and their related signaling pathways are involved in IAV infection, and the important role of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase signaling pathway during infection has been demonstrated. SP600125, an inhibitor of c-Jun N-terminal kinase, was found in our previous study to suppress IAV replication in vitro. In this study, we established a mouse model of H1N1 IAV infection and treated the mice with SP600125 to study its protective effect. The results showed that SP600125 treatment reduced the pulmonary inflammatory response, lung injury, and pulmonary viral load and increased the survival rate of H1N1-infected mice. Our data confirm the crucial role of c-Jun N terminal kinase in H1N1 virus replication and inflammatory responses in vivo. Hence, we speculate that SP600125 has a potential antiviral therapeutic benefit against IAV infection.

There is an urgent need to monitor, predict, and restrict COVID-19 in a more efficient manner. This is why Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models have been developed and used to predict the epidemiological trend of COVID-19 in Ukraine, Romania, the Republic of Moldova, Serbia, Bulgaria, Hungary, USA, Brazil, and India, these last three countries being otherwise the most affected presently. To increase accuracy, the daily prevalence data of COVID-19 from 10 March 2020 to 10 July 2020 were collected from the official website of the Romanian Government GOV.RO, World Health Organization (WHO), and European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) websites. Several ARIMA models were formulated with different ARIMA parameters.

Although digital tools may help mitigate this issue, critics have suggested that technological solutions that lack human empathy will prevent a bond or therapeutic alliance from being formed, thereby narrowing these solutions’ efficacy. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to investigate whether users of a cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)–based conversational agent would report therapeutic bond levels that are similar to those in literature about other CBT modalities, including face-to-face therapy, group CBT, and other digital interventions that do not use a conversational agent. METHODS: A cross-sectional, retrospective study design was used to analyze aggregate, deidentified data from adult users who self-referred to a CBT-based, fully automated conversational agent (Woebot) between November 2019 and August 2020. Working alliance was measured with the Working Alliance Inventory-Short Revised (WAI-SR), and depression symptom status was assessed by using the 2-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-2). All measures were administered by the conversational agent in the mobile app. WAI-SR scores were compared to those in scientific literature abstracted from recent reviews. RESULTS: Data from 36,070 Woebot users were included in the analysis. Participants ranged in age from 18 to 78 years, and 57.48% (20,734/36,070) of participants reported that they were female. The mean PHQ-2 score was 3.03 (SD 1.79), and 54.67% (19,719/36,070) of users scored over the cutoff score of 3 for depression screening. Within 5 days of initial app use, the mean WAI-SR score was 3.36 (SD 0.8) and the mean bond subscale score was 3.8 (SD 1.0), which was comparable to those in recent studies from the literature on traditional, outpatient, individual CBT and group CBT (mean bond subscale scores of 4 and 3.8, respectively). PHQ-2 scores at baseline weakly correlated with bond scores (r=−0.04; P<.001); however, users with depression and those without depression had high bond scores of 3.45. CONCLUSIONS: Although bonds are often presumed to be the exclusive domain of human therapeutic relationships, our findings challenge the notion that digital therapeutics are incapable of establishing a therapeutic bond with users. Future research might investigate the role of bonds as mediators of clinical outcomes, since boosting the engagement and efficacy of digital therapeutics could have major public health benefits.","Darcy, Alison; Daniels, Jade; Salinger, David; Wicks, Paul; Robinson, Athena",JMIR Form Res,726,32

The effects on health-care utilization and disease activity were studied. METHODS: Using hospital data of patients with RA between 2014 and 2019, the use of an eHealth platform and participation in a self-management outpatient clinic were studied. An interrupted time series analysis compared the period before and after the introduction of the eHealth platform. The change in trend (relative to the pre-interruption trend) for the number of outpatient clinic visits and the DAS for 28 joints (DAS28) were determined for several scenarios. RESULTS: After implementation of the platform in April 2017, the percentage of patients using it was stable at ∼37%. On average, the users of the platform were younger, more highly educated and had better health outcomes than the total RA population. After implementation of the platform, the mean number of quarterly outpatient clinic visits per patient decreased by 0.027 per quarter (95% CI: −0.045, −0.08, P = 0.007). This was accompanied by a significant decrease in DAS28 of 0.056 per quarter (95% CI: −0.086, −0025, P = 0.001). On average, this resulted in 0.955 fewer visits per patient per year and a reduction of 0.503 in the DAS28. CONCLUSION: The implementation of remote patient monitoring has a positive effect on health-care utilization, while maintaining low disease activity. This should encourage the use of this type of telemedicine in the management of RA, especially while many routine outpatient clinic visits are cancelled owing to COVID-19.","Müskens, Wieland D; Rongen-van Dartel, Sanne A A; Vogel, Carine; Huis, Anita; Adang, Eddy M M; van Riel, Piet L C M",Rheumatol Adv Pract,726,1

COVID-19 typically affects the respiratory tract and mucous membranes, leading to pathological involvement of various organ systems. Although patients usually present with fever, cough, and fatigue, less common manifestations have been reported including symptoms arising from thrombosis and thromboembolism. A spectrum of dermato-logic changes is becoming recognized in patients with COVID-19 who initially present with respiratory symptoms. The mechanism behind these manifestations remains unclear. This report presents the case of a 47-year-old Hispanic man who developed cutaneous vasculitic lesions and gangrene of the toes following admission to hospital with COVID-19 pneumonia. CASE REPORT: COVID-19 has been associated with cardiovascular disease entities including stroke, acute coronary syndrome, venous thromboembolism, and peripheral vascular disease. We present a case in which a 47-year-old Hispanic man arrived at the Emergency Department with COVID-19 and was admitted for respiratory failure. Despite anticoagulation initiated on admission in the presence of an elevated D-dimer, the patient developed gangrene of all his toes, which required bilateral transmetatarsal amputation. CONCLUSIONS: This case shows that dermatologic manifestations may develop in patients who initially present with COVID-19 pneumonia. These symptoms may be due to venous thrombosis following SARS-CoV-2 vasculitis, leading to challenging decisions regarding anticoagulation therapy. Randomized controlled trials are needed to evaluate the efficacy of anticoagulation, to choose appropriate anticoagulants and dosing, and to assess bleeding risk.","Adekiigbe, Riliwan; Ugbode, Franklin; Seoparson, Sunil; Katriyar, Neeraj; Fetterman, Alan",Am J Case Rep,726,21

COVID-19 has had and will continue to have important consequences on wellness and burnout for EM physicians in Canada. Baseline data are crucial to monitor the health of EM physicians in Canada, and evaluate any interventions designed to help during and after COVID-19. OBJECTIVES: To describe the rates of burnout, depression, and suicidality in practicing EM physicians in Canada, just before the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A modified snowball method was used for survey distribution. Participants completed the Maslach Burnout Inventory – Health Services Tool (MBI-HSS), a screening measure for depression (PHQ-9), and a question regarding if the physician had ever or in the past 12 months contemplated suicide. RESULTS: A total of 384 respondent surveys were included in the final analysis: 86.1% (329/382) met at least one of the criteria for burnout, 58% (217/374) scored minimal to none on the PHQ-9 screening tool for depression, 14.3% (53/371) had contemplated suicide during their staff career in EM, and of those, 5.9% (22/371) had actively considered suicide in the past year. CONCLUSION: Canadian EM physicians just before the COVID-19 pandemic had an alarming number of respondents meet the threshold for burnout, confirming EM as a high-risk specialty. This important baseline information can be used to monitor the physical and mental risks to EM physicians during and after COVID-19, and evaluate support for mental health and wellness, which is urgently needed now and post pandemic.","Lim, Rodrick; Aarsen, Kristine Van; Gray, Sara; Rang, Louise; Fitzpatrick, Jada; Fischer, Lisa",CJEM,726,20

Due to inadequate research on geographic modeling of COVID-19, we investigated county-level variations of disease incidence across the continental United States. We compiled a geodatabase of 35 environmental, socioeconomic, topographic, and demographic variables that could explain the spatial variability of disease incidence. Further, we employed spatial lag and spatial error models to investigate spatial dependence and geographically weighted regression (GWR) and multiscale GWR (MGWR) models to locally examine spatial non-stationarity. The results suggested that even though incorporating spatial autocorrelation could significantly improve the performance of the global ordinary least square model; these models still represent a significantly poor performance compared to the local models. Moreover, MGWR could explain the highest variations (adj. R2: 68.1%) with the lowest AICc compared to the others. Mapping the effects of significant explanatory variables (i.e., income inequality, median household income, the proportion of black females, and the proportion of nurse practitioners) on spatial variability of COVID-19 incidence rates using MGWR could provide useful insights to policymakers for targeted interventions.","Mollalo, Abolfazl; Vahedi, Behzad; Rivera, Kiara M.",Sci Total Environ,726,18

However, it is still unclear how the virus interferes with immune cell and metabolic functions in the human body. In this study, we investigated the immune response in acute or convalescent COVID19 patients. We characterized the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) using flow cytometry and found that CD8+ T cells were significantly subsided in moderate COVID-19 and convalescent patients. Furthermore, characterization of CD8+ T cells suggested that patients with a mild and moderate course of the COVID-19 disease and convalescent patients have significantly diminished expression of both perforin and granzyme A in CD8+ T cells. Using 1H-NMR spectroscopy, we characterized the metabolic status of their autologous PBMCs. We found that fructose, lactate and taurine levels were elevated in infected (mild and moderate) patients compared with control and convalescent patients.

We used polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to study 9 virus groups, including 16 different viruses or viral strains, in 56 ambulatory children with radiologically confirmed community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). The same tests were carried out on 474 apparently healthy control children of the same age and sex. The mean age of children with CAP was 6.5 years (SD 4.2). Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was found in 19.6 % of 56 cases and in 2.1 % of 474 controls. Adenoviruses were present in 12.5 % of cases (0.2 % controls) and metapneumovirus and influenza A virus each in 10.7 % of cases (0.2 % controls). Interestingly, rhinoviruses were less common in cases (10.7 %) than in controls (22.4 %): odds ratio 0.36 (95%CI) 0.15–0.87) in conditional logistic regression including 56 cases and 280 controls matched for age, sex and sampling month. The prevalence of parainfluenza viruses, enteroviruses, coronaviruses and human bocavirus were similar in both groups. Conclusion: We conclude that the role of rhinoviruses as an etiology of pediatric CAP has been over-estimated, mainly due to the non-controlled designs of previous studies.","Spichak, Tatyana V.; Yatsyshina, Svetlana B.; Кatosova, Lubov К.; Кim, Svetlana S.; Korppi, Matti O.",Eur J Pediatr,726,21

The study extended the health belief model (HBM) using insights from trait theory and events systems theory, to examine the role of beliefs in predicting intentions to be vaccinated against COVID‐19, when a vaccine becomes available. Employees from Greece (N = 1006) participated from October 1 to November 5, 2020, in an anonymous online factorial survey experiment. Measures of dispositional optimism, faith in intuition, risk‐taking propensity, and acquiring resources mindset were included as individual difference variables. Multilevel modeling techniques were used for data analyses. Components of HBM had significant effects on intentions to vaccinate. Two‐way interactions between severity and susceptibility beliefs and three‐way interaction among perceived severity, susceptibility, and perceived benefits were detected. In line with the events systems theory, a critical event moderated beliefs' effects on intention to vaccinate. Acquiring resources mindset emerged as important individual difference that positively related to intentions. The model explained 59 per cent of the variance in vaccination intentions. The study highlighted interaction effects among the HBM components and how critical events may moderate belief effects.","Zampetakis, Leonidas A.; Melas, Christos",Appl Psychol Health Well Being,726,20

This syndrome shares characteristics with Kawasaki disease. CASE REPORT: A 15-year-old girl presented to our Emergency Department (ED) with fevers and malaise. She was diagnosed on her initial visit with an acute viral syndrome and discharged with a COVID polymerase chain reaction test pending, which was subsequently negative. She returned 3 days later with persistent fever, conjunctivitis, and a symmetric targetoid rash over her palms. She had no adenopathy, but her erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein were both significantly elevated at 90 mm/h and 19.61 mg/dL, respectively. The patient was then transferred to the regional children's hospital due to a clinical suspicion for MIS-C, and subsequent COVID-19 immunoglobulin G testing was positive. She had been empirically started on intravenous immunoglobulin in addition to 81 mg aspirin daily. Initial echocardiograms showed mild dilatation of the left main coronary artery, and on repeat echocardiogram, a right coronary artery aneurysm was also identified. Oral prednisone therapy (5 mg) was initiated and the patient was discharged on a continued prednisone taper. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? We present a case of a 15-year-old girl who presented to the ED with MIS-C who developed coronary aneurysms despite early therapy, to increase awareness among emergency physicians of this emerging condition.","Nelson, Cole; Ishimine, Paul; Hayden, Stephen R.; Correia, Matthew; Wardi, Gabriel",J Emerg Med,726,1

To analyze the role of the immune response against defined MHV‐JHM antigens, we tested the protective efficacy of vaccinia virus (VV) recombinants expressing either the nucleocapsid (N) or the spike (S) protein. A strong protection was mediated in animals by immunization with recombinant VV encoding a wild‐type S protein (VV‐S(Wildtype)), whereas VV recombinant expressing a mutant S(354CR) protein (VV‐S(354CR)) had no protective effect. Recombinant VV encoding N protein (VV‐N) induces a humoral and a CD4(+) T cell response, but did not prevent acute disease regardless of the immunization protocol. In these experiments, challenge with an otherwise lethal dose of MHV‐JHM was performed prior to the induction of virus‐neutralizing antibodies and studies with the anti‐CD8(+) monoclonal antibody, MRC OX8 showed that elimination of the CD8(+) subset of T cells abrogates the protective effect. This result indicates that CD8(+) T cells primed by recombinant VV expressing wild‐type S protein are a primary mechanism of immunological defense against MHV‐JHM infection in rats.","Flory, Egbert; Pfleiderer, Michael; And, Albert Stühler; Wege, Helmut",Eur J Immunol,726,16

The use of masks may reduce the spread of the infection by minimising the excretion of Flügge droplets. The objective of this study was to compile the evidence available on the use of masks in relation to respiratory infections. METHODOLOGY: An umbrella review (review of systematic reviews) was conducted. Two reviewers independently carried out the screening process, data extraction and data analysis. Discrepancies were resolved with a third reviewer, and the assessment of the risk of bias of the studies was carried out using the AMSTAR 2 tool. The Rayyan QCRI program was used for the screening process. RESULTS: A total of eight systematic reviews were included. The studies analysed the use of masks in the general population, in long-term care facilities, in hospitals and at mass gatherings, and compared the effectiveness thereof in preventing infection. The results of this review revealed that the use of masks is associated with a protective effect against respiratory infections in healthcare facilities, in long-term care facilities and at mass gatherings. CONCLUSIONS: In light of the results, it seems reasonable to recommend the use of masks to the general population, but this use should be accompanied by a training programme to improve compliance, as not using them properly may increase the risk of infection.","Olry de Labry-Lima, Antonio; Bermúdez-Tamayo, Clara; Martinez-Olmos, José; Martin-Ruiz, Eva",Enferm Infecc Microbiol Clin,726,9

However, previous reports indicate that practicing within this expanded scope has remained limited. Therefore, a 26-item, web-based survey was emailed to CA community pharmacists to assess pharmacists’ knowledge, intent, and barriers to prescribing and billing for these patient care services. A total of 216 chain, supermarket-based, independent, mass merchant, and health-system outpatient pharmacists were included. The primary services provided and medications prescribed are for vaccinations and naloxone. Most pharmacists agree that engagement in and implementation of new strategies to enhance patients’ access to care is important. Common barriers include patient unawareness of pharmacist-provided services, lack of payment for services, and difficulty incorporating services within pharmacy workflow. Pharmacists are confident in their ability to provide patient care services but are less knowledgeable and confident about billing for them. Enhancing promotion of pharmacist-provided services to patients, developing strategies to efficiently incorporate them into the workflow, and payment models can help overcome barriers to providing these services.","Reyes, Liesl D.; Hong, Jenny; Lin, Christine; Hamper, Jeffrey; Kroon, Lisa",Pharmacy (Basel),726,14

There are five distinct lineages with each lineage representing a different ancestral origin. Recently, multiple reports have demonstrated the evidence of extra-intestinal infection of PAstVs, but little is known about viremia. RESULTS: In this study, a total of 532 fecal samples and 120 serum samples from healthy pigs were collected and tested from 2013 to 2015 in Guangxi province, China; of these 300/532 (56.4%) and 7/120 (5.8%) of fecal samples tested positive for PAstVs, respectively. Our study revealed that there was wide genetic diversity and high prevalence of the virus in the pig population. All five of the known PAstVs genotypes (1–5) prevailed in the pig population of Guangxi province and were distributed in all age groups of pigs, from suckling piglets to sows, with PAstV2 (47.7%), PAstV1 (26.2%) and PAstV5 (21.5%) seen predominantly. Phylogenetic analysis of partial ORF1b and partial capsid sequences from fecal and serum samples revealed that they were divided into the five lineages. Among these genotypes, based on partial ORF2 genes sequencing 23 strains were grouped as PAstV1, including 6 serum-derived strains, and were regarded as the causative agents of viremia in pigs. CONCLUSIONS: Due to the information regarding the types of PAstV in blood is limit. This is the first report for the presence of PAstV1 in blood and PAstV3 in the feces of nursery pigs of China. This study provides a reference for understanding the prevalence and genetic evolution of PAstVs in pigs in Guangxi province, China. It also provides a new perspective for understanding of the extra-intestinal infection of PAstVs in pigs.","Qin, Yifeng; Fang, Qingli; Li, Xunjie; Li, Fakai; Liu, Huan; Wei, Zuzhang; Ouyang, Kang; Chen, Ying; Huang, Weijian",BMC Vet Res,726,16

It has worsened during the COVID-19 pandemic. Increasing evidence shows heavy metals are associated with increased CVD risk. We aimed to determine the association between the serum heavy metal levels and 10-year risk of CVDs and to predict risks of CVDs based on marginal effects. Heavy metals were measured by a graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry and direct mercury analyzer. The results show a significant relationship between the increase in cadmium, lead, mercury, hs-CRP levels and the 10-year risk of CVD after adjustment for serum cotinine, age group, sex, body mass index, a family history of CVDs, diabetes or hyperlipidemia, high-risk drinking, physical activity, and diabetes. A doubling of serum cadmium, lead, mercury, and hs-CRP was associated with the increase in the 10-year risk of CVD by 0.14%, 0.10%, 0.11% and 0.22%, respectively. Therefore, a special concern should be given to the harmful impacts of heavy metals on the 10-year risk of CVD. It is important to develop a prevention strategy targeting the high-risk population to slow down this progression to risk factors related to heavy metals and reduce prevalence. Remarkedly, hs-CRP is the most validated and widely used inflammatory marker, and could be a potential clinical value in predicting and monitoring CVDs.","Nguyen, Hai Duc; Oh, Hojin; Hoang, Ngoc Hong Minh; Kim, Min-Sun",Sci Rep,726,29

Making use of pathogen genome sequences in such analyses remains a challenge, however, with a variety of heuristic approaches having been explored to date. We introduce a statistical method exploiting both pathogen sequences and collection dates to unravel the dynamics of densely sampled outbreaks. Our approach identifies likely transmission events and infers dates of infections, unobserved cases and separate introductions of the disease. It also proves useful for inferring numbers of secondary infections and identifying heterogeneous infectivity and super-spreaders. After testing our approach using simulations, we illustrate the method with the analysis of the beginning of the 2003 Singaporean outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), providing new insights into the early stage of this epidemic. Our approach is the first tool for disease outbreak reconstruction from genetic data widely available as free software, the R package outbreaker. It is applicable to various densely sampled epidemics, and improves previous approaches by detecting unobserved and imported cases, as well as allowing multiple introductions of the pathogen. Because of its generality, we believe this method will become a tool of choice for the analysis of densely sampled disease outbreaks, and will form a rigorous framework for subsequent methodological developments.","Jombart, Thibaut; Cori, Anne; Didelot, Xavier; Cauchemez, Simon; Fraser, Christophe; Ferguson, Neil",PLoS Comput Biol,726,20

Apart from diarrhea it causes greasy skin exudation, dehydration, and distressed behavior and can ultimately lead to death. No specific causative agents have been identified and the syndrome is regarded as multifactorial. The aim of the present study was to investigate a possible inflammatory state in mink kits with PWD, as indicated by raised serum concentrations of the acute phase protein serum amyloid A (SAA) and by changes in intestinal pathomorphology and intestinal contents of bacteria. Samples collected from 20 diarrheic mink kits with PWD and 20 age-matched non-diarrheic control mink kits from two commercial Danish farms during the pre-weaning period (April–May) in 2016 were analyzed. RESULTS: Concentrations of SAA in serum samples from mink kits with PWD were significantly higher (up to 1000-fold) compared to non-diarrheic control mink kits. Significant features of enterocytic vacuolization, atrophy and fusion of villi in jejunum and mucosal atrophy of the colon of kits with PWD were found. Moreover, attachment of coccoid bacteria to enterocytes was more often found in kits suffering from PWD, while intra-cytoplasmic eosinophil bodies were more frequently observed in control kits. Cellular infiltrations with mononuclear and neutrophil leukocytes were not associated with disease status. Bacteria from the Staphylococcus intermedius group, such as Staphylococcus delphini, were more frequently cultivated from control mink kits, whereas Enterococcus spp. dominated in mink kits with PWD. Escherichia coli was cultivated from both control and mink kits with PWD, but with a higher frequency from mink kits with PWD. CONCLUSION: A significant increase in circulating concentrations of SAA was found in PWD affected mink kits from 6 to 23 days old compared to controls. The histopathological changes in PWD mink kits suggest that the type of diarrhea is secretory. Attachment of coccoid bacteria, therefore, might be responsible for an enterotoxic effect causing a loss of balance in movements of ions and water leading to the vacuolization and swelling of the enterocytes. The slight to moderate infiltrations of neutrophils irrespectively of diarrheic status and the attachment of coccoid bacteria to enterocytes are comparable to observations found in piglets suffering from New Neonatal Porcine Diarrhea Syndrome. Mechanisms behind the correlation between increased SAA levels and the observed pathological intestinal features remain obscure.","Mathiesen, Ronja; Birch, Julie Melsted; Chriél, Mariann; Jensen, Henrik Elvang; Agger, Jens Frederik; Heegaard, Peter Mikael Helweg; Struve, Tina",Acta Vet Scand,726,24

As such, there is a lack of data regarding the inpatient outcomes of individuals hospitalized with rhinovirus infection. Given the generalized poorer prognosis of elderly admitted with respiratory viral infections, we assessed the mortality rate of general medical patients admitted with rhinovirus infection along with the major risk factors associated to mortality. Methods: We performed a retrospective chart review of patients admitted to our clinical teaching ward from December 2013 to June 2017. Results: Overall, 12.5% of patients admitted with rhinovirus infection died within 90 days of admission. The median age of admitted patients was 70 years-old. In univariable analysis, age (OR 1.05; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.01-1.09) and the need for oxygen at presentation (OR 3.23; 95% CI 1.06-9.86) were associated with death while obstructive pulmonary disease or asthma (OR 0.10; 95% CI 0.01-0.81) was associated with survival. In the multivariable model, age (aOR 1.04; 95% CI 1.00-1.09) and obstructive lung disease (aOR 0.09 95%CI 0.01-0.73) remained significant whereas the requirement for oxygen at presentation did not (aOR 2.78; 95% CI 0.84-9.23). Conclusion: Our study reveals that rhinovirus is an important cause of both morbidity and mortality in the elderly and further highlights the need for studies of potentially effective treatment options.

We previously demonstrated that administration of steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRA) in mice fed a moderate high-fat diet is able to reduce white adipose tissue (WAT) expansion, stimulate browning of WAT and activate interscapular brown adipose tissue (iBAT). Here, we aimed to compare the metabolic and adipose tissue-specific effects of the novel non-steroidal MRA finerenone (Fine) and spironolactone (Spiro) in a mouse model of very high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity. C57BL/6 J male mice were fed a 60% HFD containing or not Spiro or Fine for 12 weeks. WAT and iBAT morphology and adipose tissue gene expression analysis were assessed. After 12 weeks, both groups of mice showed similar weight gain compared to the HFD group. Histological and molecular analyses of WAT did not show significant differences among all experimental groups; differently, iBAT histological analysis revealed that Fine was able to increase recruitment of brown adipocytes in this depot, whereas mice treated with Spiro failed to elicit any iBAT response, as indicated by no changes in lipid droplets size and iBAT density, compared to HFD. Increased iBAT recruitment could explain, at least in part, the improved insulin resistance observed in mice treated with Fine, as shown by a significant reduction in homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA) index. These findings were confirmed by gene expression analysis of ucp-1, pgc1-α, and beta-3 adrenoreceptor (Adrb3) in iBAT, revealing significantly higher expression of these thermogenic genes in HFD + Fine group compared to HFD, whereas Spiro did not modify their expression. In summary, we demonstrated that, differently from Fine, Spiro did not induce iBAT recruitment. Our current study suggests that Fine, through its direct effects on iBAT, represents a promising pharmacologic tool to treat human metabolic diseases associated with adipose tissue dysfunctions.","Marzolla, V.; Feraco, A.; Limana, F.; Kolkhof, P.; Armani, A.; Caprio, M.",J Endocrinol Invest,726,22

Currently, SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp, encoded by nsp12-nsp7-nsp8) has been targeted by numerous inhibitors with debated clinical impact. Among these, remdesivir has been conditionally approved for the treatment of COVID-19 patients. Although the emergence of antiviral resistance, an indirect proxy for antiviral efficacy, poses a considerable healthcare threat, an evolutionary perspective on emerging resistant mutants is still lacking. Here we show that SARS-CoV-2 RdRp is under purifying selection, that potential escape mutations are rare, and unlikely to lead to viral fitness loss. In more than 56,000 viral genomes from 105 countries dating from December 2019 to July 2020 we found negative selective pressure affecting nsp12 (Tajimas D = -2.62), with potential antiviral escape mutations in only 0.3% of sequenced genomes. Those affected known key residues, such as Nsp12:Val473 and Nsp12:Arg555. Of the potential escape mutations found globally, in silico structural models show that this rarely implies loss of stability in RdRp. No potential escape mutation were found in our local cohort of remdesivir treated patients from the first wave (n=8). Our results indicate that RdRp is a suitable drug target, and that remdesivir does not seem to exert high selective pressure. Our study could be the starting point of a larger monitoring effort of drug resistance throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. We recommend the application of repetitive genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 from patients treated with antivirals to provide early insights into the evolution or antiviral resistance.","Mari, A.; Roloff, T.-C.; Stange, M.; Soegaard, K.

Personalised telephone-based health coaching for patients with low literacy and/or low patient activation. 3. Personalised patient feedback. 4. A browser-based web portal. METHODS: Study participants will be adults enrolled in a DMP for T2DM and/or CHD and living in North Rhine-Westphalia, a state of the Federal Republic of Germany. Study participants will be recruited with the assistance of their general practitioners by the end of June 2021. Evaluation will be performed as a pragmatic randomised controlled trial with one intervention group and one waiting control group. The intervention group will receive the intervention for 18 months. During this time, the waiting control group will continue with usual care and the usual measures of their DMPs. After 18 months, the waiting control group will also receive a shortened intervention. The primary outcome is number of hospital days. In addition, the effects on self-reported health-state, physical activity, nutrition, and eight different psychological variables will be investigated. Differences between values at month 18 and at the beginning will be compared to judge the effectiveness of the intervention. DISCUSSION: If the intervention proves effective, it may be included into the DMPs for T2DM and CHD.

Here we report a human monoclonal antibody, m826, that binds to H7 hemagglutinin (HA) and protects against H7N9 infection. m826 binds to H7N9 HA with subnanomolar affinity at acidic pH and 10-fold lower affinity at neutral pH. The high-resolution (1.9 Å) crystal structure of m826 complexed with H7N9 HA indicates that m826 binds an epitope that may be fully exposed upon pH-induced conformational changes in HA. m826 fully protects mice against lethal challenge with H7N9 virus through mechanisms likely involving antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). Interestingly, immunogenetic analysis indicates that m826 is a germline antibody and m826-like sequences can be identified in H7N9-infected patients, healthy adults and newborn babies. These m826 properties offer a template for H7N9 vaccine immunogens, a promising candidate therapeutic, and a tool for exploring mechanisms of virus infection inhibition by antibodies.","Yu, Fei; Song, He; Wu, Yanling; Young Chang, So; Wang, Lili; Li, Wei; Hong, Binbin; Xia, Shuai; Wang, Chunyu; Khurana, Surender; Feng, Yang; Wang, Yanping; Sun, Zhiwu; He, Biao; Hou, Dongni; Manischewitz, Jody; King, Lisa R.; Song, Yuanlin; Min, Ji-Young; Golding, Hana; Ji, Xinhua; Lu, Lu; Jiang, Shibo; Dimitrov, Dimiter S.; Ying, Tianlei",Cell Host & Microbe,726,1

By press time, more than 3.3 million people have died from COVID-19, with many countries experiencing peaks in infections and hospitalizations. The main symptoms of infection with SARS-CoV-2 include fever, chills, coughing, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, fatigue, muscle or body aches and pains. While the symptoms of the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus have many similarities to the signs and transmission routes of the novel coronavirus, e.g., fever, cough, sore throat, body aches, headache, chills and fatigue. And a few cases of serious illness, rapid progress, can appear viral pneumonia, combined with respiratory failure, multiple organ function damage, serious people can die. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop a rapid and accurate field diagnostic method to effectively identify the two viruses and treat these early infections on time, thus helping to control the spread of the disease. Among molecular detection methods, RT-LAMP (real-time reverse transcription-loop-mediated isothermal amplification) has some advantages in pathogen detection due to its rapid, accurate and effective detection characteristics. Here, we combined the primers of the two viruses with the fluorescent probes on the RT-LAMP detection platform to detect the two viruses simultaneously. Firstly, RT-LAMP method was used respectively to detect the two viruses at different concentrations to determine the effectiveness and sensitivity of probe primers to the RNA samples. And then, the two virus samples were detected simultaneously in the same reaction tube to validate if testing for the two viruses together had an impact on the results compared to detecting alone. We verified the detection efficiency of three highly active BST variants during RT-LAMP assay. We expect that this assay can effectively and accurately distinguish COVID-19 from the pandemic (H1N1) 2009, so that these two diseases with similar symptoms can be appropriately differentiated and treated.","Yu, Lin; Wang, Jingyao; Li, Xuelong; Mao, Lingling; Sui, Yi; Chen, Weihua; Pelechano, Vicent; Guo, Xing; Yin, Xiushan",Heliyon,726,8

The vaccines have become a big challenge in the last decades, where the attention has been focused on scientific challenges such as new vaccine development and adjuvants or delivery systems. The classical vaccines were developed from live-attenuated or killed organisms, such as influenza, smallpox, and BCG, as well as subunits such as Hepatitis B. The attenuated vaccines carry the risk of regaining their pathogenicity under immunosuppression conditions. The development of subunit vaccines without risk are considered as an essential need in combination with adequate delivery systems to obtain desired cell and humoral immune responses against infectious diseases. In the last decades, the use of nanoparticles as a delivery system in vaccines has received special attention to improve vaccine efficacy. These nanoparticles could be composed of lipids, metal and nonmetal inorganics, several polymers, and virus-like particles, which have been tested in research; some of them have already been approved for human and animal use. The characteristics of the nanoparticles have allowed targeting desired antigen-presenting cells to improve immunization strategies to induce protection. The main characteristics of the nanoparticles are to protect the antigens from early proteolytic degradation, control antigen release, and help antigen uptake and processing by antigen-presenting cells, and they should be safe for human and veterinary use. In addition, the nanoparticles could be modified in their physicochemical properties to target specific cells and improve vaccine efficacy. This chapter focuses on the nanoparticle-based vaccine formulations and the approaches used to realize efficient delivery of vaccines in order to induce host protective immunity against infectious diseases.","Diaz-Arévalo, Diana; Zeng, Mingtao",Nanopharmaceuticals,726,24

We aimed to investigate that national early warning score (NEWS) could predict severe outcomes in patients identified by a rapid response system (RRS), focusing on the patient’s age. We conducted a retrospective cohort study from June 2019 to December 2020. Outcomes were unplanned intensive care unit (ICU) admission, ICU mortality, and in-hospital mortality. We analyzed the predictive ability of NEWS using receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve and the effect of NEWS parameters using multivariable logistic regression. A total of 2,814 RRS activations were obtained. The predictive ability of NEWS for unplanned ICU admission and in-hospital mortality was fair but was poor for ICU mortality. The predictive ability of NEWS showed no differences between patients aged 80 years or older and under 80 years. However, body temperature affected in-hospital mortality for patients aged 80 years or older, and the inverse effect on unplanned ICU admission was observed. The NEWS showed fair predictive ability for unplanned ICU admission and in-hospital mortality among patients identified by the RRS. The different presentations of patients 80 years or older should be considered in implementing the RRS.","Kim, Sang Hyuk; Choi, Hye Suk; Jin, Eun Suk; Choi, Hayoung; Lee, Hyun; Lee, Sang-Hwa; Lee, Chang Youl; Lee, Myung Goo; Kim, Youlim",Sci Rep,726,5

On 12 March 2020, the first case in the Pacific islands was reported in French Polynesia; no other Pacific island country or territory has reported cases. The purpose of our analysis is to show how travellers may introduce COVID-19 into the Pacific islands and discuss the role robust health systems play in protecting health and reducing transmission risk. We analyse travel and Global Health Security Index data using a scoring tool to produce quantitative estimates of COVID-19 importation risk, by departing and arriving country. Our analysis indicates that, as of 12 March 2020, the highest risk air routes by which COVID-19 may be imported into the Pacific islands are from east Asian countries (specifically, China, Korea and Japan) to north Pacific airports (likely Guam, Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands or, to a less extent, Palau); or from China, Japan, Singapore, the United States of America or France to south Pacific ports (likely, Fiji, Papua New Guinea, French Polynesia or New Caledonia). Other importation routes include from other east Asian countries to Guam, and from Australia, New Zealand and other European countries to the south Pacific.

Licensed by the Dutch Ministry of Health, the Dutch Transplant Foundation (NTS) plays a central role in the organization of tissue donation. The NTS works closely with the Dutch hospitals, two tissue banks and a procurement organization. Potential tissue donors are reported to the NTS 24/7. After consulting the Donor Register and relatives give consent for donation, donors are subject to a thorough medical evaluation. If no medical contraindication is mentioned, the donor is approved for tissue donation. Each year, tissues of an average of 1918 donors (112.1 donors Per Million Population) are procured. After procurement of tissues, donor blood and tissues are tested on virology and quality respectively. Based on the test results and the assessment of potential disease transmission, tissues can either be released for transplantation or discarded. In conclusion, the Netherlands has developed a uniform, nationwide approach for safe and efficient post mortem tissue donation in which the NTS plays a central role. In the past 5 years, tissues from a considerable number of donors are procured. The NTS will continue to work together with their partners, by stimulating donor recognition, registration of the donor will, relatives’ informed consent and by extending donor selection criteria, for an even more efficient way to help patients on the waiting list for a transplantation.","van Leiden, H.

This study aimed to investigate the role of COVID-19 associated coagulopathy (CAC) to preview and triage. Methods and Results: A cohort study was designed from government designated COVID-19 treatment center. CAC was defined as International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) score ≥2. Data from 117 patients COVID-19 were reviewed on admission. The primary and secondary outcomes were admission to Intensive Care Unit (ICU), the use of mechanical ventilation, vital organ dysfunction, discharges of days 14, 21 and 28 from admission and hospital mortality. Among them, admission to ICU was increased progressively from 16.1% in patients with non-CAC to 42.6% in patients with CAC (P < 0.01). Likely, invasive ventilation and noninvasive ventilation were increased from 1.8%, 21.4% in patients with non-CAC to 21.3%, 52.5% in patients with CAC, respectively (P < 0.01). The incidences of acute hepatic injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome in non-CAC and CAC were 28.6% vs. 62.3%, 8.9% vs. 27.9%, respectively (P < 0.01). The discharges of days 14, 21 and 28 from admission were more in non-CAC than those of CAC (P < 0.05). Multiple logistic regression results showed that ISTH score ≥2 was obviously associated with the admission to ICU (OR 4.07, 95% CI 1.47–11.25 P = 0.007) and the use of mechanical ventilation (OR 5.54, 95% CI 2.01–15.28 P = 0.001) in patients with COVID-19.

It is found the clustering coefficient increases dramatically in March and coincides with the most severe fall of the recent worldwide stock markets crash. Further, the log-likelihood in all cases bent over a power law distribution, with a higher estimated power during the period of major financial contraction.

Our objectives were to investigate 1) experiences of social isolation and loneliness during shelter‐in‐place orders and 2) unmet health needs related to changes in social interactions. DESIGN: Mixed‐methods, longitudinal phone‐based survey administered every 2 weeks. SETTING: Two community sites and an academic geriatrics outpatient clinical practice. PARTICIPANTS: 151 community‐dwelling older adults. MEASUREMENTS: We measured social isolation using a 6‐item modified Duke Social Support Index, social interaction sub‐scale, which included assessments of video‐based and internet‐based socializing. Measures of loneliness included self‐reported worsened loneliness due to the COVID‐19 pandemic, and loneliness severity based on the 3‐item UCLA loneliness scale. Participants were invited to share open‐ended comments about their social experiences. RESULTS: Participants were on average 75 years old (SD = 10), 50% had hearing or vision impairment, 64% lived alone, and 26% difficulty bathing. Participants reported social isolation in 40% of interviews, 76% reported minimal video‐based socializing, and 42% minimal internet‐based socializing. Socially isolated participants reported difficulty finding help with functional needs, including bathing (20% vs 55%, p = .04). Over half (54%) of participants reported worsened loneliness due to COVID‐19, which was associated with worsened depression (62% vs 9%, p < .001) and anxiety (57% vs 9%, p < .001). Rates of loneliness improved on average by time since shelter‐in‐place orders (4–6 weeks: 46% vs 13–15 weeks: 27%, p = .009), however, loneliness persisted or worsened for a subgroup of participants. Open‐ended responses revealed challenges faced by the subgroup experiencing persistent loneliness, including poor emotional coping and discomfort with new technologies.

Identification of a strategy to manage the severity of this disease will not only help to reduce its case fatality but also help to remove some of the burden from the already overwhelmed health care systems. While successful management of symptoms in general is important, identifying measures to modify the severity of the illness is a key factor in the fight against this pandemic. METHODS: This paper presents a short literature review to suggest a new treatment modality for COVID-19. RESULTS: COVID-19 is less severe and rarely fatal in children than in adults, which could be caused by greater fluctuations of plasma epinephrine in children.

Comparing patients having and lacking a regular source of medical care and other ED patient characteristics, we assessed COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy, reasons for not wanting the vaccine, perceived access to vaccine sites and willingness to get the vaccine as part of ED care. Methods: Cross sectional survey conducted from 12/10/2020 to 3/7/21 at 15 safety net United States EDs. Primary outcomes were COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy, reasons for vaccine hesitancy, and sites (including EDs) for potential COVID-19 vaccine receipt. Results: Of 2575 patients approached, 2301 (89.4%) participated. Of the 18.4% of respondents who lacked a regular source of medical care, 65% used the ED as their usual source of health care. The overall rate of vaccine hesitancy was 39%;the range among the 15 sites was 28 to 58%. Respondents who lacked a regular source of medical care were more commonly vaccine hesitant than those who had a regular source of medical care (47 vs 38%, 9% difference, 95% CI 4 – 14%). Other characteristics associated with greater vaccine hesitancy were younger age (median 40 vs 52, p < 0.0001), (female sex (45% vs 33%;difference 12%, 95% CI 8 to 16%), African-American race (54% vs 30%;difference 24%, 95% CI 19 to 29%), Latinx ethnicity (39% vs 30%;difference 9%, 95% CI 4 to 14%), and not having a prior influenza vaccine in the past five years (58% vs 31%;difference 27%, 95% CI 23 to 32%). Homelessness and uninsured status were not associated with greater vaccine hesitancy. Fewer vaccine hesitant respondents reported that some or all of their family members would accept the COVID-19 vaccine if it was offered to them (29% vs 75%, 46% difference, 95% CI 42 to 50%). Of the 61% COVID-19 vaccine acceptors, 21% stated that they lacked a primary doctor or clinic to receive it. The vast majority (95%) of these respondents lacking primary care would accept the COVID-19 vaccine as part of their care in the ED. Conclusions: ED patients who lack a regular source of medical care are particularly hesitant to COVID-19 vaccination. Most COVID-19 vaccine acceptors would accept it as part of their care in the ED. EDs may have pivotal roles in COVID-19 vaccine messaging and delivery to highly vulnerable populations.","Rodriguez, R.; Torres, J.; Chang, A.; Haggins, A.; Caldwell, M.; Miller, D.; Wilkerson, G.; O'Laughlin, K.; Chinnock, B.; Lim, S.; Eswaran, V.",Annals of Emergency Medicine,726,1

Prior studies of ACE2 expression have primarily focused on mRNA abundance, with investigation at the protein level limited by uncertain specificity of commercial ACE2 antibodies. Here, we report our development of a sensitive and specific flow cytometry-based assay for cellular ACE2 protein abundance. Application of this approach to multiple cell lines revealed an unexpected degree of cellular heterogeneity, with detectable ACE2 protein in only a subset of cells in each isogenic population. This heterogeneity was mediated at the mRNA level by transcripts predominantly initiated from the ACE2 proximal promoter. ACE2 expression was heritable but not fixed over multiple generations of daughter cells, with gradual drift toward the original heterogeneous background. RNA-seq profiling identified distinct transcriptomes of ACE2-expressing relative cells to non-expressing cells, with enrichment in functionally related genes and transcription factor target sets. Our findings provide a validated approach for the specific detection of ACE2 protein at the surface of single cells, support an epigenetic mechanism ACE2 gene regulation, and identify specific pathways associated with ACE2 expression in HuH7 cells.","Sherman, Emily J.; Emmer, Brian T.",bioRxiv,726,16

The two cases are important not only because they were the first of their type in the United States, but also because both patients were DNR/DNI and were therefore expected to die. Study repetition is vitally important in medicine. New work in pharmacology hypothesizes that adenosine-regulator proteins may play a role in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 infection. Furthermore, adenosine, by interacting with cell receptor sites, has pluripotent effects upon inflammatory cells, is anti-inflammatory, and is important in tissue hypoxia signaling. Inhaled adenosine is potentially safe; thousands have received it for asthmatic challenge testing. The effects of adenosine in these two cases were rapid, positive, and fit the pharmacologic hypotheses (as seen in prior work in this journal) and support its role as a therapeutic nucleoside.","Spiess, Bruce D.; Sitkovsky, Michael; Correale, Pierpaolo; Gravenstein, Nikolaus; Garvan, Cynthia; Morey, Timothy E.; Fahy, Brenda G.; Hendeles, Leslie; Pliura, Thomas J.; Martin, Thomas D.; Wu, Velyn; Astrom, Corey; Nelson, Danielle S.",Front Pharmacol,726,1

Methods Electronic questionnaires assessing physical and emotional health, the value of virtual care, and access to resources were distributed to patients with postponed (PP) orthopaedic restorative surgeries and those within three-months post-operative (PO) at the time of the COVID-19 health care closures. The EQ-5D-3L was included as a standardized measure of general health. Chi-square tests compared responses between sexes and age groups. Unpaired t-tests compared the EQ VAS by sex, and a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) compared the EQ VAS by age. Results Females in the PO group were more likely to report that their recovery was delayed (49.5% vs 36%) and that closures had negatively affected their recovery (p = 0.013). Females in the PP group reported more symptoms of pain/discomfort on the EQ-5D-3L (p = 0.023). In the PP group, patients aged 25 to 44 years were most likely to identify pain as a concern (p = 0.54). In the PO group, patients younger than 45 years reported a significantly lower mean EQ VAS health state ( p = 0.017). For the final analysis, there were 115 subjects in the PP group and 198 in the PO group. Conclusion This study demonstrated significant sex- and age-specific differences in health and recovery among orthopaedic sport medicine patients as a result of the COVID-19 health care closures. Females reported significantly more pain, anxiety, and delay in their rehabilitation, while younger patients reported greater negative impacts and worse overall health state.

This taste test is subjective and biased by placebo. We propose a cheap, quantitative modification of the taste test by measuring the amount of fluorescein stained filter paper behind the mask using image analysis. METHODS: A bitter-tasting fluorescein solution was aerosolised during mask fit tests, with filter paper placed on masks' inner surfaces. Participants reported whether they could taste bitterness to determine taste test 'pass' or 'fail' results. Filter paper photographs were digitally analysed to quantify total fluorescence (TF). RESULTS: Fifty-six healthcare professionals were fit tested; 32 (57%) 'passed' the taste test. TF between the taste test 'pass' and 'fail' groups was significantly different (p<0.001). A cut-off (TF = 5.0 × 106 units) was determined at precision (78%) and recall (84%), resulting in 5/56 participants (9%) reclassified from 'pass' to 'fail' by the fluorescein test. Seven out of 56 (12%) reclassified from 'fail' to 'pass'. CONCLUSION: Fluorescein is detectable and sensitive at identifying FFP mask leaks. These low-cost adaptations can enhance exiting fit testing to determine 'pass' and 'fail' groups, protecting those who 'passed' the taste test but have high fluorescein leak, and reassuring those who 'failed' the taste test despite having little fluorescein leak.","Zaman, Sameer; Seligman, Henry; Lloyd, Freya Hepworth; Patel, Keval T; Chappell, Digby; O'Hare, Danny; Cole, Graham D; Francis, Darrel P; Petraco, Ricardo; Linton, Nick Wf",Clin Med (Lond),726,16

Numerous cancer patients from non-Western countries, including the United Arab Emirates (UAE), seek cancer care outside their home countries and many are sponsored by their governments for treatment. Many patients interrupted their cancer treatment abruptly and so returned to their home countries with unique challenges. In this review we will discuss practical challenges and recommendations for all cancer patients returning to their home countries from treatment abroad. METHOD: Experts from medical, surgical and other cancer subspecialties in the UAE were invited to form a taskforce to address challenges and propose recommendations for patients returning home from abroad after medical tourism during the SARS-COV-19 Pandemic. RESULTS: The taskforce which consisted of experts from medical oncology, hematology, surgical oncology, radiation oncology, pathology, radiology and palliative care summarized the current challenges and suggested a practical approaches to address these specific challenges to improve the returning cancer patients care. Lack of medical documentation, pathology specimens and radiology images are one of the major limitations on the continuation of the cancer care for returning patients. Difference in approaches and treatment recommendations between the existing treating oncologists abroad and receiving oncologists in the UAE regarding the optimal management which can be addressed by early and empathic communications with patients and by engaging the previous treating oncologists in treatment planning based on the available resources and expertise in the UAE. Interruption of curative radiotherapy (RT) schedules which can potentially increase risk of treatment failure has been a major challenge, RT dose-compensation calculation should be considered in these circumstances. CONCLUSION: The importance of a thorough clinical handover cannot be overstated and regulatory bodies are needed to prevent what can be considered unethical procedure towards returning cancer patients with lack of an effective handover. Clear communication is paramount to gain the trust of returning patients and their families. This pandemic may also serve as an opportunity to encourage patients to receive treatment locally in their home country. Future studies will be needed to address the steps to retain cancer patients in the UAE rather than seeking cancer treatment abroad.","Al-Shamsi, Humaid O.; Abu-Gheida, Ibrahim; Rana, Shabeeha K.; Nijhawan, Neil; Abdulsamad, Ahmed S.; Alrawi, Sadir; Abuhaleeqa, Mohamed; Almansoori, Taleb M.; Alkasab, Thamir; Aleassa, Essa M.; McManus, Martine C.",BMC Cancer,726,16

Elderly adults experience the most severe morbidity from influenza-associated diseases, and have the highest rates of seasonal migration within the U.S. compared to other subpopulations. The objective of this study is to assess spatiotemporal patterns in influenza-associated hospitalizations in the elderly, by time, geography, and intensity of P&I. Given the high seasonal migration of individuals to Florida, this state was examined more closely using harmonic regression to assess spatial and temporal patterns of P&I hospitalizations by state of residence. METHODS: Data containing all Medicare-eligible hospitalizations in the United States for 1991-2006 with P&I (ICD-9-CM codes 480-487) were abstracted for the 65+ population. Hospitalizations were classified by state of residence, provider state, and date of admissions, specifically comparing those admitted between October and March to those admitted between April and September. We then compared the hospitalization profile data of Florida residents with that of out-of-state residents by state of primary residence and time of year (in-season or out-of-season). RESULTS: We observed distinct seasonal patterns of nonresident P&I hospitalizations, especially comparing typical winter destination states, such as California, Arizona, Texas, and Florida, to other states. Although most other states generally experienced a higher proportion of non-resident P&I during the summer months (April-September), these states had higher nonresident P&I during the traditional peak influenza season (October-March). CONCLUSIONS: This study is among the first to quantify spatiotemporal P&I hospitalization patterns in the elderly, focusing on the change of patterns that are possibly due to seasonal population migration. Understanding migration and influenza-associated disease patterns in this vulnerable population is critical to prepare for and potentially prevent influenza outbreaks in this vulnerable population.","Chui, Kenneth KH; Cohen, Steven A; Naumova, Elena N",BMC Public Health,726,15

While disease has not been reported for FFV infection, FeLV infection can cause anemia and immunosuppression (progressive infection). Co-infection with FFV/FeLV allows evaluation of the pathogenic potential and epidemiology of FFV infection in cats with FeLV pathology. Blood and buccal swab samples from 81 cats were collected in Rio de Janeiro. Plasma was serologically tested for FeLV. DNA extracted from peripheral blood mononuclear cells and buccal swabs was used to PCR detect FFV and FeLV. A qPCR was developed to detect and measure FFV proviral loads (pVLs) in cats. FeLV qPCR was performed using previous methods. The median log10 pVL of FFV mono-infected individuals was lower than found in FFV/FeLV co-infected cats in buccal swabs (p = 0.003). We found 78% of cats had detectable buccal FFV DNA in FFV mono-infected and FFV co-infected FeLV-progressive cats, while in FeLV-regressive cats (those without signs of disease) 22% of cats had detectable buccal FFV DNA (p = 0.004). Our results suggest that regressive FeLV infection may reduce FFV saliva transmission, the main mode of FV transmission. We did not find evidence of differences in pathogenicity in FFV mono- and -dually infected cats. In summary, we show that FVs may interact with FeLV within the same host. Our study supports the utility of cats naturally co-infected with retroviruses as a model to investigate the impact of FV on immunocompromised mammalian hosts.","Cavalcante, Liliane T.

Furthermore, COVID-19 might also predispose infected individuals to hyperglycaemia. Interacting with other risk factors, hyperglycaemia might modulate immune and inflammatory responses, thus predisposing patients to severe COVID-19 and possible lethal outcomes. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is part of the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS), is the main entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2; although dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) might also act as a binding target. Preliminary data, however, do not suggest a notable effect of glucose-lowering DPP4 inhibitors on SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility. Owing to their pharmacological characteristics, sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors might cause adverse effects in patients with COVID-19 and so cannot be recommended. Currently, insulin should be the main approach to the control of acute glycaemia. Most available evidence does not distinguish between the major types of diabetes mellitus and is related to type 2 diabetes mellitus owing to its high prevalence. However, some limited evidence is now available on type 1 diabetes mellitus and COVID-19.

We proposed a deep learning model that can identify epiretinal membrane (ERM) in OCT with ophthalmologist-level performance. Design: Cross-sectional study. Participants: A total of 3,618 central fovea cross section OCT images from 1,475 eyes of 964 patients. Methods: We retrospectively collected 7,652 OCT images from 1,197 patients. From these images, 2,171 were normal and 1,447 were ERM OCT. A total of 3,141 OCT images was used as training dataset and 477 images as testing dataset. DL algorithm was used to train the interpretation model. Diagnostic results by four board-certified non-retinal specialized ophthalmologists on the testing dataset were compared with those generated by the DL model. Main Outcome Measures: We calculated for the derived DL model the following characteristics: sensitivity, specificity, F1 score and area under curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. These were calculated according to the gold standard results which were parallel diagnoses of the retinal specialist. Performance of the DL model was finally compared with that of non-retinal specialized ophthalmologists. Results: Regarding the diagnosis of ERM in OCT images, the trained DL model had the following characteristics in performance: sensitivity: 98.7%, specificity: 98.0%, and F1 score: 0.945. The accuracy on the training dataset was 99.7% (95% CI: 99.4 - 99.9%), and for the testing dataset, diagnostic accuracy was 98.1% (95% CI: 96.5 - 99.1%). AUC of the ROC curve was 0.999. The DL model slightly outperformed the average non-retinal specialized ophthalmologists. Conclusions: An ophthalmologist-level DL model was built here to accurately identify ERM in OCT images. The performance of the model was slightly better than the average non-retinal specialized ophthalmologists. The derived model may play a role to assist clinicians to promote the efficiency and safety of healthcare in the future.","Lo, Ying-Chih; Lin, Keng-Hung; Bair, Henry; Sheu, Wayne Huey-Herng; Chang, Chi-Sen; Shen, Ying-Cheng; Hung, Che-Lun",Sci Rep,726,1

The corona crisis hit Austria at the end of February 2020 with one of the first European superspreading events. In response, the governmental crisis unit commissioned a forecast consortium with regularly projections of case numbers and demand for hospital beds. Methods. We consolidated the output of three independent epidemiological models (ranging from agent-based micro simulation to parsimonious compartmental models) and published weekly short-term forecasts for the number of confirmed cases as well as estimates and upper bounds for the required hospital beds. Findings. Here, we report om four key contributions by which our forecasting and reporting system has helped shaping Austria's policy to navigate the crisis and re-open the country step-wise, namely (i) when and where case numbers are expected to peak during the first wave, (ii) how to safely re-open the country after passing this peak, (iii) how to evaluate the effects of non-pharmaceutical interventions and (iv) provide hospital managers guidance to plan health-care capacities. Interpretation. Complex mathematical epidemiological models play an important role in guiding governmental responses during pandemic crises, provided they are used as a monitoring system to detect epidemiological change points. For policy-makers, the media and the public, it might be problematic to distinguish short-term forecasts from worst-case scenarios with undefined levels of certainty, creating distrust in the legitimacy and accuracy of such models.

This novel virus is known to gain entry through the ACE 2 receptor of pulmonary epithelial cells lining the respiratory tract. Many of its initial symptoms (e.g. difficulty breathing) resemble acute high altitude illnesses, particularly HAPE. Based on these overt symptoms, a number of high altitude researchers have speculated on repurposing of drugs used to treat acute altitude illnesses (especially HAPE). However, eminent high altitude researchers with medical expertise as well as some studies on the deeper causes underlying the overt symptoms have found that such repurposing maybe counter-productive. Other factors, (e.g. contra-indications of these drugs), make their use in COVID-19 patients hazardous. The fit-for-repurposing options maybe experimental prophylactic interventions (e.g. silymarin, curcumin) which have proven anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. Another line of thought focuses on proteomics-based investigations of such patients. However, apart from the logistical and safety issues, a targeted proteomics approach based on prior sound molecular investigations is a more logical approach instead of mere shotgun proteomics. In this commentary, we shed light on such issues associated with COVID-19.","Ahmad, Yasmin; Paul, Subhojit; Varshney, Rajeev; Kumar, Bhuvnesh",J Proteins Proteom,726,3

Enormous sequencing depth can be necessary to compile sufficient information for identification of a certain pathogen. Generic HTS combining with in-solution capture enrichment can markedly increase the sensitivity for virus detection in complex diagnostic samples. METHODS: A virus panel based on the principle of biotinylated RNA baits was developed for specific capture enrichment of epizootic and zoonotic viruses (VirBaits). The VirBaits set was supplemented by a SARS-CoV-2 predesigned bait set for testing recent SARS-CoV-2-positive samples. Libraries generated from complex samples were sequenced via generic HTS (without enrichment) and afterwards enriched with the VirBaits set. For validation, an internal proficiency test for emerging epizootic and zoonotic viruses (African swine fever virus, Ebolavirus, Marburgvirus, Nipah henipavirus, Rift Valley fever virus) was conducted. RESULTS: The VirBaits set consists of 177,471 RNA baits (80-mer) based on about 18,800 complete viral genomes targeting 35 epizootic and zoonotic viruses. In all tested samples, viruses with both DNA and RNA genomes were clearly enriched ranging from about 10-fold to 10,000-fold for viruses including distantly related viruses with at least 72% overall identity to viruses represented in the bait set. Viruses showing a lower overall identity (38% and 46%) to them were not enriched but could nonetheless be detected based on capturing conserved genome regions. The internal proficiency test supports the improved virus detection using the combination of HTS plus targeted enrichment but also points to the risk of cross-contamination between samples. CONCLUSIONS: The VirBaits approach showed a high diagnostic performance, also for distantly related viruses. The bait set is modular and expandable according to the favored diagnostics, health sector, or research question. The risk of cross-contamination needs to be taken into consideration. The application of the RNA-baits principle turned out to be user friendly, and even non-experts can easily use the VirBaits workflow. The rapid extension of the established VirBaits set adapted to actual outbreak events is possible as shown for SARS-CoV-2.

Methods Based on systematic search in Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, and Science Direct up to April 22, 2020, a total of 52 eligible articles with 6,320 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cohorts were included. Pairwise comparison between severe versus mild disease, Intensive Care Unit (ICU) versus general ward admission, and expired versus survivors were performed for 36 laboratory parameters. The pooled standardized mean difference (SMD) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using the DerSimonian Laird method/random effects model and converted to Odds ratio (OR). The decision tree algorithm was employed to identify the key risk factor(s) attributed to severe COVID-19 disease. Results Cohorts with elevated levels of white blood cells (WBCs) (OR=1.75), neutrophil count (OR=2.62), D-dimer (OR=3.97), prolonged prothrombin time (PT) (OR=1.82), fibrinogen (OR=3.14), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (OR=1.60), procalcitonin (OR=4.76), IL-6 (OR=2.10), and IL-10 (OR=4.93) had higher odds of progression to severe phenotype. Decision tree model (sensitivity=100%, specificity=81%) showed the high performance of neutrophil count at a cut-off value of more than 3.74 x109/L for identifying patients at high risk of severe COVID-19. Likewise, ICU admission was associated with higher levels of WBCs (OR=5.21), neutrophils (OR=6.25), D-dimer (OR=4.19), and prolonged PT (OR=2.18). Patients with high IL-6 (OR=13.87), CRP (OR=7.09), D-dimer (OR=6.36), and neutrophils (OR=6.25) had the highest likelihood of mortality.

In Sao Paulo State, the first case of CoViD-19 was confirmed on 26 February, the first death due to CoViD-19 was registered on 16 March, on 24 March the Sao Paulo State authorities implemented the isolation of persons in non-essential activities, which is programmed to end on June 1. The deterministic model used the data collected in Sao Paulo State to estimate the model parameters to describe the current epidemiological status in the State under isolation. We concluded that the proportion in isolation influenced the number of new cases in around 9 days ahead. We evaluate the suitability of lockdown in Sao Paulo State and concluded that this extreme measure should be efficient if lower transmission is occurring among isolated persons. Nevertheless, the isolated persons must be released one day. Based on this model, we studied the potential epidemiological scenarios of release by varying the release proportions of young and elder persons. We evaluated three releases divided in equal proportions elapsed 14 days between releases, and three strategies: the first release occurring on June 1, 15 and 23. We concluded that these three strategies are equivalent (little difference) in reducing the number of hospitalization due to severe CoViD-19 and deaths, due to presenting the effective reproduction number near one. However, if protection actions as using face mask and hygiene (washing hands, for instance) could be massively disseminated in the population, we concluded there health care system may not collapse.","Yang, H.

One such association is its tendency to cause thromboembolic events, particularly venous thromboembolism (1,2). In a four-week period during the initial spread of COVID-19 at a 300 bed community hospital in western Massachusetts, 23 patients who were PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA required treatment in either the intensive care unit (ICU) or intermediate/step-down unit (SDU). All patients were treated with standard DVT prophylaxis from the time of admission, except for two patients who were on full anticoagulation for chronic atrial fibrillation. Of the 23 patients, 7 (30%) were diagnosed with acute, clinically significant, pulmonary embolism (PE). Four of the 7 manifested evidence of acute cor pulmonale, one of whom succumbed as a direct consequence of a massive PE. Other markers were reviewed in the 7 patients to identify trends that could allow for early suspicion of PE in COVID-19 patients. Although D-dimer tended to rise during the hospitalization relative to the control group, the results were inconsistent, and there were no other meaningful distinguishing features between the groups at the time of admission.","Manjunath, M.; Miranda, J.; Fraenkel, L.; Johansen, P.

We leveraged this wealth of information to characterize the substitution spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 and to compare it with those of other human and animal coronaviruses. We show that, once nucleotide composition is taken into account, human and most animal coronaviruses display a mutation spectrum dominated by C to U and G to U substitutions, a feature that is not shared by other positive-sense RNA viruses. However, the proportions of C to U and G to U substitutions tend to decrease as divergence increases, suggesting that, whatever their origin, a proportion of these changes is subsequently eliminated by purifying selection. Analysis of the sequence context of C to U substitutions showed little evidence of apolipoprotein B mRNA editing catalytic polypeptide-like (APOBEC)-mediated editing and such contexts were similar for SARS-CoV-2 and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus sampled from different hosts, despite different repertoires of APOBEC3 proteins in distinct species. Conversely, we found evidence that C to U and G to U changes affect CpG dinucleotides at a frequency higher than expected. Whereas this suggests ongoing selective reduction of CpGs, this effect alone cannot account for the substitution spectra. Finally, we show that, during the first months of SARS-CoV-2 pandemic spread, the frequency of both G to U and C to U substitutions increased. Our data suggest that the substitution spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 is determined by an interplay of factors, including intrinsic biases of the replication process, avoidance of CpG dinucleotides and other constraints exerted by the new host.","Forni, Diego; Cagliani, Rachele; Pontremoli, Chiara; Clerici, Mario; Sironi, Manuela",Brief Bioinform,726,16

The aim of this study was to conduct a service evaluation of CUES in Manchester. METHODS: Data were collected both prospectively and retrospectively from both primary and secondary care over an 8-week period from June to August 2020. RESULTS: In primary care CUES in Greater Manchester (GM) 2461 patients were assessed, with a majority self-referring to the service (68.7%, n = 1844). 91.7% of cases initially screened for CUES were deemed eligible and given a telemedicine appointment in GM; 53.3% of these cases required face-to-face consultation. 14.3% of cases seen within in GM CUES (351 out of 2461) were provisionally referred to secondary care. Contemporaneously the main provider emergency eyecare department (EED) attendances were reduced by 37.7% per month between April and December 2020 inclusive, compared to the same months in 2019. Patients attending a CUES face-to-face assessment were more likely to have a diagnosis in agreement with secondary care, compared to patients referred in from telemedicine assessment only (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: This evaluation of CUES demonstrates a high level of primary care activity alongside a sustained reduction in EED cases. The case-mix of patients seen within EED following referral appears to be of a less benign nature than those cases seen prior to the introduction of CUES.","Kanabar, Rahul; Craven, Wendy; Wilson, Helen; Rietdyke, Rebecca; Dhawahir-Scala, Felipe; Jinkinson, Matthew; Newman, William D.; Harper, Robert A.",Eye (Lond),726,15

OBJECTIVE: This study aim was to examine and compare PTSD-depression comorbidity networks of two types of trauma related to Typhoon Lekima and COVID-19 epidemic. METHODS: Participants were 1605 and 601 adolescents recruited following Typhoon Lekima and the COVID-19 outbreak, respectively. RESULTS: COVID-19 and Lekima PTSD-depression networks had considerable similarities, including adequate stability and accuracy, connected symptoms of PTSD and depression, symptoms with high centralities, and bridge symptoms. PTSD-depression comorbid symptoms were more complicated in the COVID-19 network but may show more persistence in the Lekima network. Distinct bridge symptoms contributed to the heterogeneity of PTSD-depression comorbidity characteristics between the two networks. Specifically, restricted affect and felt down and unhappy were two important bridge symptoms with high centrality unique to the COVID-19 network. CONCLUSIONS: PTSD-depression comorbidity network has considerable replicability across trauma types, but specific symptom-level associations and some bridge symptoms may vary across trauma types.

We included RCTs comparing the efficacy and safety of remdesivir to control/placebo in COVID-19. Two independent investigators abstracted data, assessed the quality of evidence, and rated the certainty of evidence. Results A total of 4 RCTs with 7334 patients with COVID-19 were included. At a follow-up of 28–29 days from randomization, very low certainty evidence showed that use of remdesivir compared with control group (placebo and/or standard of care) was not associated with a significant decrease in time to clinical improvement (standardized mean difference −0.80 day; [CI, −2.12, 0.53]). However, moderate certainty of evidence showed that remdesivir was associated with higher rates of recovered patients (risk difference [RD] 0.07 [0.05, 0.08]) and discharged patients (RD 0.07 [0.03, 0.11]) and lower rates of developing serious adverse events (RD -0.05 [−0.10, −0.01]) compared with control.

Higher lethality in men, evident in the first reports from China, was confirmed in the subsequent Italian outbreak. Newspapers and scientific journals commented on this finding and the preexisting conditions, biological processes, and behavioral differences that may underlie it. However, little appeared to be released about sex differences in severity of disease, comorbidities, rate of recovery, length of hospital stay, or number of tests performed. Systematic analysis of official websites for 20 countries and 6 US states revealed a wide disparity in sex-disaggregated data made available to the public and scholars. Only a handful reported cases by sex. None of the other characteristics, including deaths, were stratified by sex at the time. Beyond suboptimal sex disaggregation, we found a paucity of usable raw data sets and a generalized lack of standardization of captured data, making comparisons difficult. A second round of data capture in April found more complete, but even more disparate, information. Our analysis revealed a wide range of sex ratios among confirmed cases. In countries where a male bias was initially reported, the proportion of women dramatically increased in 3 weeks. Analysis also revealed a complex pattern of sex ratio variation with age. Accurate, peer-reviewed, analysis of harmonized, sex-disaggregated data for characteristics of epidemics, such as availability of testing, suspected source of infection, or comorbidities, will be critical to understand where the observed disparities come from and to generate evidence-based recommendations for decision-making by governments.

The importance of hand hygiene (HH) competency of nursing students (NS) is further required as a crucial learning objective of nursing education in universities. Purpose: This study aimed to investigate knowledge, perception, and performance of HH among NS and analyze their correlation. Methods: A cross-sectional questionnaire (modified from a World Health Organization questionnaire) was conducted from 23 November to 22 December 2019; 233 responses were used for the final analysis. Results: The average scores (mean ± standard deviation (range)) for knowledge, perception, and performance of HH were 17.82 ± 2.15 (0–25), 77.24 ± 10.78 (15–96), and 67.42 ± 23.10 (0–100), respectively. No significant variables were discovered to the knowledge of HH. Grade, university-affiliated hospitals, and the most recent healthcare institute of clinical practice nursing course significantly affected perceptions of HH (p < 0.039, p = 044, p < 0.001). Knowledge of HH was positively correlated with performance of HH (p = 0.002). The perception and the performance of HH of NS were positively correlated with HH performance of healthcare workers (HCWs); p < 0.001, p = 0.002. Conclusion: HH education for NS is crucial for improving the performance and the knowledge of HH. Good HH performance of healthcare workers (HCWs) can contribute to increased perception and performance of HH among NS. The cooperation of nursing education in a university and clinical practice with competent HCWs in healthcare institutions may create an effective education program for good HH performance of NS, who will be nurses during unpredictable pandemics.","Oh, Hyang Soon",Healthcare (Basel),726,5

Given the challenges in implementing widespread SARS-CoV-2 testing, there is increasing interest in alternative surveillance strategies. Methods: We tested nasopharyngeal swabs from 821 decedents in the Wayne County Medical Examiner's office for SARS-CoV-2. All decedents were assessed by a COVID-19 checklist, and decedents flagged by the checklist (237) were preferentially tested. A random sample of decedents not flagged by the checklist were also tested (584). We statistically analyzed the characteristics of decedents (age, sex, race, and manner of death), differentiating between those flagged by the checklist and not and between those SARS-CoV-2 positive and not. Results: Decedents were more likely to be male (70% vs 48%) and Black (55% vs 36%) than the catchment population. Seven-day average percent positivity among flagged decedents closely matched the trajectory of percent positivity in the catchment population, particularly during the peak of the outbreak (March and April). After a lull in May to mid-June, new positive tests in late June coincided with increased case detection in the catchment. We found large racial disparities in test results: despite no statistical difference in the racial distribution between those flagged and not, SARS-CoV-2 positive decedents were substantially more likely to be Black (89% vs 51%). SARS-CoV-2 positive decedents were also more likely to be older and to have died of natural causes, including of COVID-19 disease.

Phase 1 involved experienced educators defining gaps in our program’s existing competency-database, reviewing emerging public health and regulatory guidelines, and drafting competencies. Phase 2 involved translation, member-checking, and anonymous feedback and editing of draft competencies by residents and other educational leaders. Phase 3 involved wider dissemination, collaborative editing and feedback from residents and faculty throughout the department. RESULTS: A total of 44 physicians including residents and faculty from multiple contexts provided detailed feedback, review, and editing of an ultimate list of 33 competencies organized by CanMEDS-FM roles.

Immunoglobulin Y antibodies (IgYs) from the yolk of chicken eggs have previously been used against bacterial and viral infections in human and animals. Their advantages include lack of reaction with mammalian Fc receptors, low production cost, and ease of extraction. Compared to mammalian IgGs, they have higher target specificity and greater binding avidity. They also possess remarkable pathogen-neutralizing activity in the respiratory tract and lungs.

The cluster with the highest risk showed 27·8% fatality, 94% ICU admission, 94% intubation, and 28% discharge rates compared to 0%, 38%, 22%, and 88% in the lowest risk cluster, respectively. Patients in the highest risk cluster had leukocytosis including neutrophilia and monocytosis, severe anemia, increased red blood cell distribution width, higher BUN, creatinine, D-dimer, alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin, and troponin. INTERPRETATION: There are significant differences in the clinical and laboratory courses between COVID-19 and influenza. Risk stratification in hospitalized COVID-19 patients using laboratory data could be useful to predict clinical outcomes and pathophysiology of these patients.

It is unclear to what extent patients with advanced stage disease are willing to participate in home-based physical activity (PA) and if these interventions improve QoL. The goal of our study was to determine interest in participating in our 3-month home-based walking regimen in patients with advanced stage lung cancer. We used a randomized design to evaluate for potential benefit in PA and patient-reported outcomes. METHODS: We performed an open-label, 1:1 randomized trial in 40 patients with stage III/IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) evaluating enrollment rate, PA, QoL, dyspnea, depression, and biomarkers. Compared to usual care (UC), the intervention group (IG) received an accelerometer, in-person teaching session, and gain-framed text messages for 12 weeks. RESULTS: We enrolled 56% (40/71) of eligible patients. Participants were on average 65 years and enrolled 1.9 years from diagnosis. Most patients were women (75%), and receiving treatment (85%) for stage IV (73%) adenocarcinoma (83%). A minority of patients were employed part-time or full time (38%). Both groups reported low baseline PA (IG mean 37 (Standard deviation (SD) 46) vs UC 59 (SD 56) minutes/week; p = 0.25). The IG increased PA more than UC (mean change IG + 123 (SD 212) vs UC + 35 (SD 103) minutes/week; p = 0.051)). Step count in the IG was not statistically different between baseline (4707 step/day), week 6 (5605; p = 0.16), and week 12 (4606 steps/day; p = 0.87). The intervention improved EORTC role functioning domain (17 points; p = 0.022) with borderline improvement in dyspnea (− 13 points; p = 0.051) compared to UC. In patients with two blood samples (25%), we observed a significant increase in soluble PD-1 (219.8 (SD 54.5) pg/mL; p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Our pilot trial using a 3-month, home-based, mobile health intervention enrolled over half of eligible patients with stage III and IV NSCLC. The intervention increased PA, and may improve several aspects of QoL. We also identified potential biomarker changes relevant to lung cancer biology. Future research should use a larger sample to examine the effect of exercise on cancer biomarkers, which may mediate the association between PA and QoL.

The present study is aimed at determining phytochemical constituents, cytotoxicity and antiviral activities for crude extract of the plant. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The whole plant of C. roseus was extracted using methanol extraction method. Phytochemical qualitative screening was carried out for C. roseus extract according to standard procedures used to test for the presence of alkaloid, saponin, terpenoid and steroid. Cytotoxicity was assessed using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Plaque reduction assays were carried out to evaluate the antiviral activity of C. roseus extract against herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1). These include post-treatment, pre-treatment and virucidal assays. RESULTS: C. roseus extract contain secondary metabolites such as alkaloid, saponin and terpenoid but does not contain steroid. Cytotoxicity screening against Vero cells using MTT assay showed that the CC(50) values for crude extract of C. roseus was 0.5 mg/mL. The extract prepared from C. roseus possesses phytochemical compound that was non-cytotoxic to the cell with potential antiviral activity. Plaque reduction assays against herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) showed that the selective indices (SI = CC(50) / EC(50)) of C. roseus extract in post-treatment, pre-treatment and virucidal assays were 36, 20 and 4.7 respectively. The results revealed that the extract prepared from C. roseus possesses phytochemical compound that was non-cytotoxic to the cell with potential antiviral activity. CONCLUSION: This study showed that C. roseus extract has promising potential to be explored as anti-HSV-1 agent regardless of the mode of treatment.","Wahab, Noor Zarina Abd; Azizul, Aziah; Ibrahim, Nazlina",Iran J Microbiol,726,5

The current Coronavirus pandemic is such a crisis. The online sharing of emotional content during the Coronavirus crisis may contribute to societal value change. Emotion sharing via social media could lead to emotional contagion which in turn could facilitate an emotional climate in a society. In turn, the emotional climate of a society can influence society’s value structure. The emotions that spread in the current Coronavirus crisis are predominantly negative, which could result in a negative emotional climate. Based on the dynamic relations of values to each other and the way that emotions relate to values, a negative emotional climate can contribute to societal value change towards values related to security preservation and threat avoidance. As a consequence, a negative emotional climate and the shift in values could lead to a change in political attitudes that has implications for rights, freedom, privacy and moral progress.

Their long-term wear facilitates extensive data collection and evolving sensitivity of smart wristbands allows them to read various body vitals. In this paper, we hypothesized the use of heart rate variability (HRV) measurements to drive an algorithm that can pre-empt the onset or worsening of an affliction. Due to its significance during the time of the study, SARS-Cov-2 was taken as the case study, and a hidden Markov model (HMM) was trained over its observed symptoms. The data used for the analysis was the outcome of a study hosted by Welltory. It involved the collection of SAR-Cov-2 symptoms and reading of body vitals using Apple Watch, Fitbit, and Garmin smart bands. The internal states of the HMM were made up of the absence and presence of a consistent decline in standard deviation of NN intervals (SSDN), the root mean square of the successive differences (rMSSD) in R-R intervals, and low frequency (LF), high frequency (HF), and very low frequency (VLF) components of the HRV measurements. The emission probabilities of the trained HMM instance confirmed that the onset or worsening of the symptoms had a higher probability if the HRV components displayed a consistent decline state. The results were further confirmed through the generation of probable hidden states sequences using the Viterbi algorithm. The ability to pre-empt the exigent state of an affliction would not only lower the chances of complications and mortality but may also help in curbing its spread through intelligence-backed decisions.","Tanwar, Gatha; Chauhan, Ritu; Singh, Madhusudan; Singh, Dhananjay",Sensors (Basel),726,1

In response, many government entities have enacted healthy default beverage policies that require restaurants offering bundled kids’ meals—food and drink items combined and sold as a single unit—to include only healthier drinks. Despite growing interest in these policies, little is known about their potential reach, restaurant management perceptions, and possible implementation challenges. This study evaluated restaurant managers’ knowledge and support of a policy in Delaware that had passed, but not yet gone into effect. We conducted structured in-person interviews with managers (n = 50) from full-service and quick-service chain and non-chain restaurants (QSRs) using a stratified random sample. Managers were interviewed about the number of bundled meals sold, beverage sales with those meals, and awareness and perceptions of the policy. On average, QSRs sold significantly more bundled kids’ meals per week (281) compared to full-service restaurants (111), and managers from chain restaurants reported selling significantly more bundled kids’ meals per week (233) compared to non-chain restaurants (91). Managers reported 72.5% of those meals were sold with a healthier beverage (water, milk, or 100% juice), consistent with the forthcoming policy, while 28% were sold with SSBs. Furthermore, although only three managers (6%) reported knowing about the policy, the majority supported it when it was explained. Our findings indicate general support for the intent of the policy, but suggest the need for tailored implementation approaches and additional education for restaurant manager’s and staff.","Karpyn, Allison; Lessard, Laura; McCallops, Kathleen; Harpainter, Phoebe; Apsley, Adam; Kennedy, Nicole; Tracy, Tara; Ritchie, Lorrene D.",Prev Med Rep,726,15

Databases and grey literature were searched to April 2013, and records were screened against protocol eligibility criteria. Data extraction and risk of bias assessments were undertaken using a piloted form. Random-effects meta-analyses estimated (i) pooled proportion of HCWs willing to work and (ii) pooled odds ratios of risk factors associated with willingness to work. Heterogeneity was quantified using the I(2) statistic, and publication bias was assessed using funnel plots and Egger's test. Data were synthesized narratively where meta-analyses were not possible. Forty-three studies met our inclusion criteria. Meta-analysis of the proportion of HCWs willing to work was abandoned due to excessive heterogeneity (I(2) = 99·2%). Narrative synthesis showed study estimates ranged from 23·1% to 95·8% willingness to work, depending on context. Meta-analyses of specific factors showed that male HCWs, physicians and nurses, full-time employment, perceived personal safety, awareness of pandemic risk and clinical knowledge of influenza pandemics, role-specific knowledge, pandemic response training, and confidence in personal skills were statistically significantly associated with increased willingness. Childcare obligations were significantly associated with decreased willingness. HCWs' willingness to work during an influenza pandemic was moderately high, albeit highly variable. Numerous risk factors showed a statistically significant association with willingness to work despite significant heterogeneity between studies.

Social media interaction may elucidate public reaction and communication dynamics about COVID-19 in this critical period, during which communities may have formulated initial conceptions about the perceived severity of the pandemic. METHODS: Tweets were collected from the Twitter public API stream filtered for keywords related to COVID-19. Using a pre-existing training set, a support vector machine (SVM) classifier was used to obtain a larger set of geocoded tweets with characteristics of user self-reporting COVID-19 symptoms, concerns, and experiences. We then assessed the longitudinal relationship between identified tweets and the number of officially reported COVID-19 cases using linear and exponential regression at the U.S. county level. Changes in tweets that included geospatial clustering were also assessed for the top five most populous U.S. cities. RESULTS: From an initial dataset of 60 million tweets, we analyzed 459,937 tweets that contained COVID-19-related keywords that were also geolocated to U.S. counties. We observed an increasing number of tweets throughout the study period, although there was variation between city centers and residential areas. Tweets identified as COVID-19 symptoms or concerns appeared to be more predictive of active COVID-19 cases as temporal distance increased. CONCLUSION: Results from this study suggest that social media communication dynamics during the early stages of a global pandemic may exhibit a number of geospatial-specific variations among different communities and that targeted pandemic communication is warranted. User engagement on COVID-19 topics may also be predictive of future confirmed case counts, though further studies to validate these findings are needed.","Cuomo, Raphael E.; Purushothaman, Vidya; Li, Jiawei; Cai, Mingxiang; Mackey, Tim K.",BMC Public Health,726,21

SOURCES: This scoping review was conducted using PRISMA methodology. A literature search was conducted in MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and the Cochrane CENTRAL Register of Controlled Trials. Search strategies were developed with a medical librarian and revised through a peer review of electronic search strategies. All databases were searched from inception to 14 April 2020. Only full-text articles available in English were included. All identified articles were reviewed independently and in duplicate using predetermined criteria. All study designs were eligible if they reported on comfort-holding in a PICU. Data were extracted independently and in duplicate. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Of 13,326 studies identified, 13 were included. Comfort-holding was studied in the context of end-of-life care, developmental care, mobilization, and as a unique intervention. Comfort-holding is common during end-of-life care with 77.8% of children held, but rare during acute management (51% of children < three years, < 5% of children ≥ three years). Commonly reported outcomes included child outcomes (e.g., physiologic measurements), safety outcomes (e.g., accidental line removal), parent outcomes (e.g., psychological symptoms), and frequency of holding. CONCLUSION: There is a paucity of literature on comfort-holding in PICUs. This scoping review identifies significant gaps in the literature, including assessment of child-based outcomes of comfort-holding or safety assessment of comfort-holding, and highlights core outcomes to consider in future evaluations of this intervention including child-based outcomes, parent-based outcomes, and safety of the intervention.

The Government of India, State governments, and healthcare organizations have developed various mobile apps for the containment of COVID-19. This study was aimed to systematically review COVID-19 related mobile apps and highlight gaps to inform the development of future mHealth initiatives. METHODS: Google Play and the Apple app stores were searched using the terms 'COVID-19', 'coronavirus', 'pandemic', and 'epidemic' in the first week of April 2020. A list of COVID-19-specific functions was compiled based on the review of the selected apps, the literature on epidemic surveillance, and national and international media reports. The World Health Organization guideline on Digital Health Interventions was used to classify the app functions under the categories of the general public, health workers, health system managers, and data services. RESULTS: The search yielded 346 potential COVID-19 apps, of which 50 met the inclusion criteria. Dissemination of untargeted COVID-19-related information on preventative strategies and monitoring the movements of quarantined individuals was the function of 27 (54%) and 19 (32%) apps, respectively.

NG2 cells are known for their ability to differentiate into oligodendrocytes and are commonly referred to as oligodendrocyte precursor cells. However, recent investigations have begun to identify additional functions of NG2 cells in CNS health and pathology. NG2 cells form physical and functional connections with neurons and other glial cell types throughout the CNS, allowing them to monitor and respond to the neural environment. Growing evidence indicates that NG2 cells become reactive under pathological conditions, though their specific roles are only beginning to be elucidated. While reactive microglia and astrocytes are well-established contributors to neuroinflammation and the development of epilepsy following CNS infection, the dynamics of NG2 cells remain unclear. Therefore, we investigated NG2 cell reactivity in a viral-induced mouse model of temporal lobe epilepsy. METHODS: C57BL6/J mice were injected intracortically with Theiler’s murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) or PBS. Mice were graded twice daily for seizures between 3 and 7 days post-injection (dpi). At 4 and 14 dpi, brains were fixed and stained for NG2, the microglia/macrophage marker IBA1, and the proliferation marker Ki-67. Confocal z stacks were acquired in both the hippocampus and the overlying cortex. Total field areas stained by each cell marker and total field area of colocalized pixels between NG2 and Ki67 were compared between groups. RESULTS: Both NG2 cells and microglia/macrophages displayed increased immunoreactivity and reactive morphologies in the hippocampus of TMEV-injected mice. While increased immunoreactivity for IBA1 was also present in the cortex, there was no significant change in NG2 immunoreactivity in the cortex following TMEV infection. Colocalization analysis for NG2 and Ki-67 revealed a significant increase in overlap between NG2 and Ki-67 in the hippocampus of TMEV-injected mice at both time points, but no significant differences in cortex. CONCLUSIONS: NG2 cells acquire a reactive phenotype and proliferate in response to TMEV infection. These results suggest that NG2 cells alter their function in response to viral encephalopathy, making them potential targets to prevent the development of epilepsy following viral infection.","Bell, Laura A.; Wallis, Glenna J.; Wilcox, Karen S.",J Neuroinflammation,726,4

All this involves difficulties in finding the right ventilation parameters and an adequate driving pressure to guarantee sufficient ventilation. Therefrom, new mechanical ventilation techniques were sought that could help overcome the aforementioned obstacles. A new mode of mechanical ventilation is being presented, i.e., a Positive + Negative Synchronized Ventilation (PNSV), characterized by the association and integration of two pulmonary ventilators; one acting inside the chest with positive pressures and one externally with negative pressure. The peculiarity of this combination is the complete synchronization, which takes place with specific electronic modifications. The PNSV can be applied both in a completely non-invasive and invasive way and, therefore, be used both in acute care wards and in ICU. The most relevant effect found, due to the compensation of opposing pressures acting on the chest, is that, during the entire inspiratory act created by the ventilators, the pressure at the alveolar level is equal to zero even if adding together the two ventilators’ pressures; thus, the transpulmonary pressure is doubled. The application of this pressure for 1 hour on elderly patients suffering from severe acute respiratory failure, resulted in a significant improvement in blood gas analytical and clinical parameters without any side effects. An increased pulmonary recruitment, including posterior lung areas, and a reduction in spontaneous ventilatory rate have also been demonstrated with PNSV. This also paves the way to the search for the best ventilatory treatment in critically ill or ARDS patients. The compensation of intrathoracic pressures should also lead, although not yet proven, to an improvement in venous return, systolic and cardiac output. In the analysis of the study in which this method was applied, the total transpulmonary pressure delivered was the sum of the individual pressures applied by the two ventilators. However, this does not exclude the possibility of reducing the pressures of the two machines to modulate a lower but balanced total transpulmonary pressure within the chest.","Vincenzi, Umberto",Multidiscip Respir Med,726,27

Among other benefits, glycosylation analysis allows vaccine developers to assess the impact of construct design or producer cell line choices for vaccine production, and it is a key measure by which glycoproteins that are produced for use in vaccination can be compared to their native viral forms. Because many viral glycoproteins are multiply glycosylated, glycopeptide analysis is a preferrable approach for mapping the glycans, yet the analysis of glycopeptide data can be cumbersome and requires the expertise of an experienced analyst. In recent years, a commercial software product, Byonic, has been implemented in several instances to facilitate glycopeptide analysis on viral glycoproteins and other glycoproteomics data sets, and the purpose of the study herein is to determine the strengths and limitations of using this software, particularly in cases relevant to vaccine development. The glycopeptides from a recombinantly expressed trimeric S glycoprotein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus were first analyzed using an expert-based analysis strategy; subsequently, analysis of the same data set was completed using Byonic. Careful assessment of instances where the two methods produced different results revealed that the glycopeptide assignments from Byonic contained more false positives than true positives, even when the data were assessed using a 1% false discovery rate. The work herein provides a roadmap for removing the spurious assignments that Byonic generates, and it provides an assessment of the opportunity cost for relying on automated assignments for glycopeptide data sets from viral glycoproteins.

In an effort to augment the capabilities of existing diagnostic methodologies, the use of virus-specific DNA microarray technology has been recently applied in both research and clinical settings with favorable results. The primary advantage of this approach is that DNA microarrays containing literally thousands of virus-specific sequences allow simultaneous testing for essentially all known viral species. While previous methods have been limited to testing for a single pathogen, or small numbers of specific pathogens, a panviral assay is less biased and can be designed to detect variant or even novel members of existing viral families. The use of DNA microarrays in both research and clinical settings has the potential to substantially increase the number of instances in which a virus may be identified in biological samples. With the proper bioinformatics methodologies, this technology will also maximize the probability that previously uncharacterized pathogens are detected potentially leading to an improved understanding of the etiology for many chronic human diseases. This article focuses on all aspects of virus-specific DNA microarray implementation, from array design to sample processing, amplification, and data analysis.","Fischer, K.; Urisman, A.; DeRisi, J.",Encyclopedia of Virology,726,6

This epidemic’s effect on the waste composition and management and the impacts of municipal solid waste management (MSWM) on disease transmission or controlling are considered a compelling experience of living in the COVID-19 pandemic that can effectively control the process. This systematic review research was conducted to determine the effects of COVID-19 on the quantity of waste and MSWM. Searches were conducted in three databases (using keywords covid 19, coronaviruses, and waste), and among the published articles from 2019 to 2021, 56 ones were selected containing information on the quantity and waste management during the COVID-19 pandemic. The results showed that COVID-19 caused the quantity variation and composition change of MSW. COVID-19 also has significant effects on waste recycling, medical waste management, quantity, and littered waste composition. On the other hand, the COVID-19 pandemic has changed waste compounds’ management activities and waste generation sources. Recognizing these issues can help plan MSWM more efficiently and reduce virus transmission risk through waste.","Yousefi, Mahmood; Oskoei, Vahide; Jonidi Jafari, Ahmad; Farzadkia, Mahdi; Hasham Firooz, Masoumeh; Abdollahinejad, Behnaz; Torkashvand, Javavd",Environ Sci Pollut Res Int,726,28

Serologic testing detects antibodies specific to SARS-CoV-2 and IgM specifically may serve as an adjunct test to PCR early in disease. We evaluated the Abbott anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG assays along with DiaSorin anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and Roche anti-SARS-CoV-2 Total. METHODS: Specimens from 175 PCR-positive patients and 107 control specimens were analyzed using Abbott IgM and IgG, DiaSorin IgG, and Roche Total (IgA, IgG, IgM) assays. Sensitivity, specificity, cross-reactivity, concordance between assays, trends over time, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) were determined. RESULTS: Abbott IgM sensitivity was 63.6% at 0 days post-PCR positivity, 76.5% at 1-5d, 76.3% at 6-14d, 85.2% at 15-30d, and 63.6% at >30d. All assays exhibited highest sensitivity 15-30d post-PCR positivity (83.3-85.2%). Combining Abbott IgM and IgG improved sensitivity by 22.7% compared to IgG alone when tested 0d post-PCR positivity. All assays had a specificity of 100% and only Abbott IgG exhibited cross-reactivity (anti-dsDNA). Cohen’s kappa varied between 0.86-0.93. Time to seroconversion from PCR positivity was lowest for Abbott IgM and highest for Abbott IgG. NPV was highest for Abbott IgM <14 days post-PCR positivity and Abbott IgG ≥14 days. CONCLUSION: The Abbott IgM assay exhibited the earliest response and greatest signal in most patients evaluated for serial sampling and had the highest NPV <14 days post-PCR positivity, suggesting its potential utility as an adjunct test to PCR early in disease course.","Higgins, Victoria; Fabros, Anselmo; Wang, Xiao Yan; Bhandari, Maria; Daghfal, David J.; Kulasingam, Vathany",Clin Biochem,726,32

These injuries, however, have not been quantified against previous seasons to highlight the altered season as a causative factor. METHODS: A review of an online database was conducted to search for injuries to football players in the Premier League across three seasons; 2018-2019, 2019-2020, and 2020-2021, to compare for difference in injury rates across the years and assess for higher rates in this current season, where athletes have had less play time due to COVID-19. Injury number and injury characteristics were abstracted from the online database Transfermarkt, with the provided information allowing for the sorting of the data into muscular and ligamentous injuries and skeletal injuries. RESULTS: Overall 226, 260, and 289 muscular and ligamentous injuries were observed across the 2018/2019, 2019/2020, and 2020/2021 seasons, respectively. There were 495 minutes on average played leading up to first injury in the 2020/2021 season, compared with 521 minutes in the 2019/2020 season and 536 minutes in the 2018/2019. There was an average of games played to injury of 5.6 games in the 2020/2021 year, with 6.0 in the 2019/2020 year and 6.1 in the 2018/2019 year. Additionally, there was a significantly shorter time in between games was noted during the COVID-affected season with a mean time of 6.8 days in-between games played during the 2020-2021 season as compared to the previous years of 9.12 and 7.12 days. CONCLUSION: Our study found that there were more injuries and a decreased time to first injury observed during the COVID-impacted 2020-2021 season than the two preceding seasons, perhaps demonstrating a link between fixture congestion and athlete injuries as evidenced by the significantly shorter time between games. It is therefore prudent to retain fixture spacing for athlete recovery even against the backdrop of an overall shortened season.","Mannino, Brian J; Yedikian, Teren; Mojica, Edward Stephen; Bi, Andrew; Alaia, Michael; Gonzalez-Lomas, Guillem",Phys Sportsmed,726,13

Objective(s): To investigate the use of a table-top disaster exercise to improve disaster awareness and preparedness for pharmacists and pharmacy staff attending The Society of Hospital Pharmacists of Australia (SHPA) Medicine Management conference 2019. METHODS: A table-top disaster exercise was developed by the research team and presented as a workshop at the SHPA's annual conference in 2019. The workshop presented attendees with the hypothetical ‘Cyclone Oma’ that was tracking across the fictional state of ‘New Cardiff’. Each workshop table was assigned a different hospital and was required to respond to Cyclone Oma as the scenario evolved. Workshop attendees were invited to complete a pre- and post-survey assessing their perceptions of disaster management and preparedness for pharmacists and pharmacy staff. RESULTS: The pre- and post-workshop survey was completed by 41 out of the 47 attendees. Participants’ assessments of their understanding of disaster management activities increased after attending the workshop (p < 0.001). Most participants felt the workshop improved their understanding of their role in a disaster (87.8%, 36/41) and allowed them to identify their strengths and weaknesses in disaster management (90.2%, 37/41). The workshop was well received with 92.7% (38/41) of participants stating they would like further continuing professional development opportunities in disaster management. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first disaster table-top exercise in Australia targeted specifically at the pharmacy workforce to be conducted and evaluated. The exercise improved understanding of disaster management and was well received by the participants. This research calls for further education and training opportunities in disaster management targeted at the pharmacy workforce.","Watson, Kaitlyn E.; Waddell, Jason J.; McCourt, Elizabeth M.",Res Social Adm Pharm,726,1

At the same time, the psychological effect of patients being treated in cabin hospitals and the features of the psychological status of the whole society remained ambiguous. This study adopted a self-administrated questionnaire to investigate the stress, depression, and anxiety status of patients in cabin hospitals (n = 212) and healthy participants outside of Hubei province (n = 221) in a population level from February 29 to March 01, 2020. The research measured participants’ stress response, depression level, and anxiety level as well as their social support system and their resilience level. Results indicated that in this sudden outbreak of an unknown pandemic, all people (whether or not infected) showed a generally high level of stress, depression, and anxiety, regardless of age, gender, education level, and employment. It also showed that people with a lower level of psychological resilience and social support reported more severe symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress. Moreover, the research also found a positive effect of cabin hospitals on the psychological recovery of COVID-19 patients. Stress response of patients increased after entering into cabin hospitals, while after 3–4 weeks’ treatment, patients showed a decrease in their depression and anxiety levels. This research advances the understanding of COVID-19 and gives suggestions to optimize the design and the allocation of resources in cabin hospitals and better deal with the unknown pandemics in the future.","Wang, Yahui; Zhang, Mengyue; Yin, Qin; Wang, Yincheng; Yang, Pengcheng; Hu, Chao; Xu, Guogang; Wang, Daoweng; Li, Xianzhi; He, Jibo; Hu, Qinyong; Luo, Xingguang; Ren, Honggang",Front Psychol,726,20

Later the Italian National Institute of Health (ISS) invited SIAARTI and the Italian Society of Legal and Insurance Medicine to prepare a draft document for the definition of triage criteria for intensive care during the emergency, to be implemented in case of complete saturation of care resources. METHODS: Following formal methods, including two Delphi rounds, a multidisciplinary group with expertise in intensive care, legal medicine and law developed 12 statements addressing: (1) principles and responsibilities; (2) triage; (3) previously expressed wishes; (4) reassessment and shifting to palliative care; (5) collegiality and transparency of decisions. The draft of the statements, with their explanatory comments, underwent a public consultation opened to Italian scientific or technical-professional societies and other stakeholders (i.e., associations of citizens, patients and caregivers; religious communities; industry; public institutions; universities and research institutes). Individual healthcare providers, lay people, or other associations could address their comments by e-mail. RESULTS: Eight stakeholders (including scientific societies, ethics organizations, and a religious community), and 8 individuals (including medical experts, ethicists and an association) participated to the public consultation. The stakeholders’ agreement with statements was on average very high (ranging from 4.1 to 4.9, on a scale from 1—full disagreement to 5—full agreement). The 4 statements concerning triage stated that in case of saturation of care resources, the intensive care triage had to be oriented to ensuring life-sustaining treatments to as many patients as possible who could benefit from them. The decision should follow full assessment of each patient, taking into account comorbidities, previous functional status and frailty, current clinical condition, likely impact of intensive treatment, and the patient's wishes. Age should be considered as part of the global assessment of the patient. CONCLUSIONS: Lacking national guidelines, the document is the reference standard for healthcare professionals in case of imbalance between care needs and available resources during a COVID-19 pandemic in Italy, and a point of reference for the medico-legal assessment in cases of dispute.","Riccioni, Luigi; Ingravallo, Francesca; Grasselli, Giacomo; Mazzon, Davide; Cingolani, Emiliano; Forti, Gabrio; Zagrebelsky, Vladimiro; Zoja, Riccardo; Petrini, Flavia",Ann Intensive Care,726,1

Here, to improve upon current control methods, we analyze temporal and spatial patterns of chikungunya, Zika, and dengue outbreaks reported in the Dominican Republic between 2012 and 2018. The viruses that cause these outbreaks are transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes, which are sensitive to seasonal climatological variability. We evaluate whether climate and the spatio-temporal dynamics of dengue outbreaks could explain patterns of emerging disease outbreaks. We find that emerging disease outbreaks were robust to the climatological and spatio-temporal constraints defining seasonal dengue outbreak dynamics, indicating that constant surveillance is required to prevent future health crises.","Petrone, Mary E.; Earnest, Rebecca; Lourenço, José; Kraemer, Moritz U.

We used the STG-55 for glucose control in a 60-year-old woman with severe COVID-19 admitted to the intensive care unit. Due to severe respiratory failure, the patient was intubated, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was introduced. Because she had hyperglycemia despite high-dose intravenous insulin therapy, we decided to use STG-55 for glucose control. The STG-55 safely titrated the insulin infusion and monitored glucose levels. Fifty-six hours after adopting the STG-55, it was removed because the blood sampling failed. No episodes of hypoglycemia were observed despite deep sedation during this period.

Because of the millions of doses required, it is desirable that vaccines are not only safe and effective, but also easy to administer, store, and inexpensive to produce. Newcastle Disease Virus (NDV) is responsible for a respiratory disease in chickens. It has no pathogenic homologue in humans. NDV is recognized as an oncolytic virus, and its use in humans for oncological treatment is being evaluated. In the present work, we have developed two types of NDV-vectored candidate vaccines, which carry the surface-exposed RBD and S1 antigens of SARS-CoV-2, respectively. These vaccine candidates were produced in specific-pathogen-free embryonating chicken eggs, and purified from allantoic fluid before lyophilization. These vaccines were administered intranasally to three different animal models: mice, rats and hamsters, and evaluated for safety, toxicity, immunogenicity, stability and efficacy. Efficacy was evaluated in a challenge assay against active SARS-CoV-2 virus in the Golden Syrian hamster model. The NDV-vectored vaccine based on the S1 antigen was shown to be safe and highly immunogenic, with the ability to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 in-vitro, even with an extreme dilution of 1/640. Our results reveal that this vaccine candidate protects the lungs of the animals, preventing cellular damage in this tissue. In addition, this vaccine reduces the viral load in the lungs, suggesting that it may significantly reduce the likelihood of transmission. Being lyophilized, this vaccine candidate is very stable and can be stored for several months at 4-8⁰C. In conclusion, our NDV-based vaccine candidate has shown a very favorable performance in the pre-clinical study, serving as evidence for a future evaluation in a Phase-I human clinical trial. This candidate represents a promising tool in the fight against COVID-19.","Fernandez Díaz, Manolo; Calderon, Katherine; Rojas-Neyra, Aldo; Vakharia, Vikram N.; Choque-Guevara, Ricardo; Montalvan, Angela; Poma-Acevedo, Astrid; Rios-Matos, Dora; Agurto-Arteaga, Andres; de Grecia Cauti-Mendoza, María; Perez-Martinez, Norma; Isasi-Rivas, Gisela; Tataje-Lavanda, Luis; Palomino, Miryam; Bailón, Henri; Sernaque-Aguilar, Yacory; Ygnacio-Aguirre, Freddy; Criollo-Orozco, Manuel; Huaccachi-Gonzalez, Edison; Delgado-Ccancce, Elmer; Villanueva-Pérez, Doris; Montesinos-Millan, Ricardo; Gutiérrez-Manchay, Kristel; Pauyac-Antezana, Katherine; Ramirez-Ortiz, Ingrid; Quiñones-Garcia, Stefany; Cauna-Orocollo, Yudith; Vallejos-Sánchez, Katherine; Rios-Angulo, Angela A.; Núñez-Fernández, Dennis; Salguedo-Bohorquez, Mario I.; Ticona, Julio; Sánchez, Manolo Fernández; García, Paquita; Icochea, Eliana; Guevara, Luis; Zimic, Mirko",bioRxiv,726,16

In this study, we have hypothesized that the metabolic modulator eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) combined with the antioxidant hydroxytyrosol (HT) attenuates HFD-induced white adipose tissue (WAT) alterations. Methods: C57BL/6J mice were administered with a HFD (60% fat, 20% protein, 20% carbohydrates) or control diet (CD; 10% fat, 20% protein, 70% carbohydrates), with or without EPA (50 mg/kg/day), HT (5 mg/kg/day), or both for 12 weeks. Determinations in WAT include morphological parameters, EPA and docosahexaenoic acid content in phospholipids (gas chromatography), lipogenesis, oxidative stress (OS) and inflammation markers, and gene expression and activities of transcription factors, such as sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-γ), nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) (p65 subunit) and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) (quantitative polymerase chain reaction and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay). Results: HFD led to WAT hypertrophy in relation to PPAR-γ downregulation. WAT metabolic dysfunction was characterized by upregulation of lipogenic SREBP-1c system, mitochondrial energy metabolism depression, loss of the antioxidant Nrf2 signaling with OS enhancement, n-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids depletion and activation of the pro-inflammatory NF-κB system. EPA and HT co-supplementation diminished HFD-dependent effects additively, reaching values close or similar to controls. Conclusion: Data presented strengthen the importance of combined protocols such as EPA plus HT to attenuate metabolic-inflammatory states triggered by obesity.","Illesca, Paola; Valenzuela, Rodrigo; Espinosa, Alejandra; Echeverría, Francisca; Soto-Alarcon, Sandra; Campos, Cristian; Rodriguez, Alicia; Vargas, Romina; Magrone, Thea; Videla, Luis A.",Molecules,726,23

The fast indicators system is used to analyze four economic crises in Russia, including their prerequisites and the pace and depth of the recession and subsequent recovery of the real economy and other sectors, such as the financial and social sectors, and foreign trade. Integral indices are synthesized for these sectors, the composite index of economic security is calculated, and the patterns of their joint movement are considered.

For the mean-field model, which does not distinguish between different age groups, we demonstrate that including a more realistic Gamma distribution of incubation and recovery periods may not have an effect on the total number of deaths and the overall size of an epidemic, but it has a major effect in terms of increasing the peak numbers of infected and critical care cases, as well as on changing the timescales of an epidemic, both in terms of time to reach the peak, and the overall duration of an outbreak. In order to obtain more accurate estimates of disease progression and investigate different strategies for introducing and lifting the lockdown, we have also considered an age-structured version of the model, which has allowed us to include more accurate data on age-specific rates of hospitalisation and COVID-19 related mortality. Applying this model to three comparable neighbouring regions in the UK has delivered some fascinating insights regarding the effect of quarantine in regions with different population structure. We have discovered that for a fixed quarantine duration, the timing of its start is very important in the sense that the second epidemic wave after lifting the quarantine can be significantly smaller or larger depending on the specific population structure. Also, the later the fixed-duration quarantine is introduced, the smaller is the resulting final number of deaths at the end of the outbreak. When the quarantine is introduced simultaneously for all regions, increasing quarantine duration postpones and slightly reduces the epidemic peak, though without noticeable differences in peak magnitude between different quarantine durations.","Blyuss, K.

We sequenced 97 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) genomes from samples collected between January 24 and March 24, 2020 from infected patients in France. Phylogenetic analysis identified several early independent SARS-CoV-2 introductions without local transmission, highlighting the efficacy of the measures taken to prevent virus spread from symptomatic cases. In parallel, our genomic data reveals the later predominant circulation of a major clade in many French regions, and implies local circulation of the virus in undocumented infections prior to the wave of COVID-19 cases.

We assessed the safety and immunogenicity of DNA encoding H5 as a priming vaccine to improve antibody responses to inactivated influenza vaccination. METHODS: In VRC 306 and VRC 310, two sequentially enrolled phase 1, open-label, randomised clinical trials, healthy adults (age 18–60 years) were randomly assigned to receive intramuscular H5 DNA (4 mg) at day 0 or twice, at day 0 and week 4, followed by H5N1 monovalent inactivated vaccine (MIV; 90 μg) at 4 or 24 weeks, and compared with a two-dose regimen of H5N1 MIV with either a 4 or 24 week interval. Antibody responses were assessed by haemagglutination inhibition (HAI), ELISA, neutralisation (ID(80)), and immunoassays for stem-directed antibodies. T cell responses were assessed by intracellular cytokine staining. After enrolment, investigators and individuals were not masked to group assignment. VRC 306 and VRC 310 are registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, numbers NCT00776711 and NCT01086657, respectively. FINDINGS: In VRC 306, 60 individuals were randomly assigned to the four groups (15 in each) and 59 received the vaccinations. In VRC 310, of the 21 individuals enrolled, 20 received the vaccinations (nine received a two-dose regimen of H5N1 MIV and 11 received H5 DNA at day 0 followed by H5N1 MIV at week 24). H5 DNA priming was safe and enhanced H5-specific antibody titres following an H5N1 MIV boost, especially when the interval between DNA prime and MIV boost was extended to 24 weeks. In the two studies, DNA priming with a 24-week MIV boost interval induced protective HAI titres in 21 (81%) of 26 of individuals, with an increase in geometric mean titre (GMT) of more than four times that of individuals given the MIV-MIV regimen at 4 or 24 weeks (GMT 103–206 vs GMT 27–33). Additionally, neutralising antibodies directed to the conserved stem region of H5 were induced by this prime-boost regimen in several individuals. No vaccine-related serious adverse events were recorded. INTERPRETATION: DNA priming 24 weeks in advance of influenza vaccine boosting increased the magnitude of protective antibody responses (HAI) and in some cases induced haemagglutinin-stem-specific neutralising antibodies. A DNA-MIV vaccine regimen could enhance the efficacy of H5 or other influenza vaccines and shows that anti-stem antibodies can be elicited by vaccination in man.

METHODS: After identifying two patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection on March 11, 2020, we conducted an outbreak investigation and employed targeted interventions including: screening of patients and staff; isolation and cohorting of confirmed cases; serial testing; and enhanced infection prevention measures. RESULTS: We identified 10 patients and 7 staff members with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Thirty percent of patients (n=3) remained asymptomatic over the course of infection. Among SARS-CoV-2 positive patients, fever (n=5, 50%) and cough (n=4, 40%) were the most common symptoms.

The viral titer inhibition was found to take place in a dose-dependent manner. Knocking down expression of Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase, the cellular receptor of cardenolides, in ST cells was found to significantly impair the susceptibility of ST cells to TGEV infectivity.

Grip strength testing is simple and cheap but not routinely assessed for patients with hip fracture. This project aimed to assess the feasibility of implementing grip strength testing into admission assessment of patients with hip fracture. METHODS: A scalable protocol and a corresponding training programme of instructional presentations and practical assessments were designed and delivered by and for physiotherapy staff. Grip strength values were collected pre-surgery on patients with hip fracture at a single centre whilst supine in bed. Implementation of the process was evaluated using narrative, quantitative and cost measures. RESULTS: 53 hip fracture patients with a mean age 80.6 (SD 10.4), of which 36 (67.9%) were female, were included. Testing was offered to 42/52 (81%) patients. Cognitive impairment prevented 14/42 (33%) of patients from completing testing; one patient declined testing. Of the 27 patients who completed testing, 14/27 (52%) had low grip strength as defined by EWGSOP2 criteria. The projected cost of testing for one year was £2.68-£2.82 per patient. Fidelity to the protocol was high using multiple criteria. CONCLUSIONS: Grip strength assessment is acceptable to physiotherapy staff and can be rapidly and cost-effectively implemented into hip fracture admission assessment.","Doherty, William J.; Stubbs, Thomas A.; Chaplin, Andrew; Langford, Sarah; Sinclair, Nicola; Ibrahim, Kinda; Reed, Mike R.; Sayer, Avan A.; Witham, Miles D.; Sorial, Antony K.",J Frailty Sarcopenia Falls,726,20

However, preparedness planning concentrates more upon population health and maintaining a functioning health sector than on the wider economic impact. We developed a single country Computable General Equilibrium model to estimate the economic impact of pandemic influenza (PI) and associated policies. While the context for this development was the United Kingdom, there are lessons to be drawn for application of this methodology, as well as indicative results, to other contexts. Disease scenarios were constructed from an epidemiological model which estimated case fatality rates (mild, moderate and severe) as 0.06%, 0.18% and 0.35%. A clinical attack rate of 35% was also used to produce influenza scenarios, together with preparedness policies, including antivirals and school closure, and the possible prophylactic absence of workers. UK cost estimates (in Sterling) are presented, together with relative percentage impacts applicable to similar large economies. Percentage/cost estimates suggest PI would reduce GDP by 0.3% (£3.5bn), 0.4% (£5bn) and 0.6% (£7.4bn) respectively for the three disease scenarios. However, the impact of PI itself is smaller than disease mitigation policies: combining school closure with prophylactic absenteeism yields percentage/cost effects of 1.1% (£14.7bn), 1.3% (£16.3bn) and 1.4% (£18.5bn) respectively for the three scenarios. Sensitivity analysis shows little variability with changes in disease parameters but notable changes with variations in school closure and prophylactic absenteeism. The most severe sensitivity scenario results in a 2.9% (£37.4bn), 3.2% (£41.4bn) and 3.7% (£47.5bn) loss to GDP respectively for the three scenarios.","Smith, Richard D.; Keogh-Brown, Marcus R.; Barnett, Tony",Soc Sci Med,726,16

One such practice is what the sociologist Erving Goffman called civil inattention—the social norm of showing a proper amount of indifference to others—which functions as an almost unnoticed yet highly potent privacy-preserving mechanism. These practices can be disrupted by technologies that afford new forms of intrusions. In this paper, we show how new networked technologies, such as facial recognition (FR), challenge our ability to practice civil inattention. We argue for the need to revitalise, in academic and policy debates, the role of civil inattention and related practices in regulating behaviour in public space. Our analysis highlights the relational nature of privacy and the importance of social norms in accomplishing and preserving it. While our analysis goes some way in supporting current calls to ban FR technology, we also suggest that, pending a ban and in light of the power of norms to limit what is otherwise technically possible, cultivating new practices of civil inattention may help address the challenges raised by FR and other forms of digital surveillance in public.","Sharon, Tamar; Koops, Bert-Jaap",Ethics Inf Technol,726,20

We also sought to understand the baseline seroprevalence of HKU1 spike antibodies in healthy children and to measure their correlation with SARS-CoV-2 binding and neutralizing antibodies in children hospitalized with acute coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) or multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C). Methods: Groups of 5 mice were injected intramuscularly with two doses of alum-adjuvanted HKU1 spike followed by SARS-CoV-2 spike; or the reciprocal regimen of SARS-Cov-2 spike followed by HKU1 spike. Sera collected 21 days following each injection was analyzed for IgG antibodies to HKU1 spike, SARS-CoV-2 spike, and SARS-CoV-2 neutralization. Sera from children hospitalized with acute COVID-19, MIS-C or healthy controls (n=14 per group) were analyzed for these same antibodies. Results: Mice primed with SARS-CoV-2 spike and boosted with HKU1 spike developed high titers of SARS-CoV-2 binding and neutralizing antibodies; however, mice primed with HKU1 spike and boosted with SARS-CoV-2 spike were unable to mount neutralizing antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. HKU1 spike antibodies were detected in all children with acute COVID-19, MIS-C, and healthy controls. Although children with MIS-C had significantly higher HKU1 spike titers than healthy children (GMT 37239 vs. 7551, P=0.012), these titers correlated positively with both SARS-CoV-2 binding (r=0.7577, P<0.001) and neutralizing (r=0.6201, P=0.001) antibodies. Conclusions: Prior murine exposure to HKU1 spike protein completely impeded the development of neutralizing antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, consistent with original antigenic sin. In contrast, the presence of HKU1 spike IgG antibodies in children with acute COVID-19 or MIS-C was not associated with diminished neutralizing antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2.","Lapp, S.

Although several vaccines have recently reached the market, the development of specific antiviral drugs against SARS-CoV-2 is an important additional strategy in fighting the pandemic. One of the most promising pharmacological targets is the viral main protease (Mpro). Here, we present an optimized biochemical assay procedure for SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. We have comprehensively investigated the influence of different buffer components and conditions on the assay performance, and characterized six FRET substrates with a 2-Abz/Tyr(3-NO2) FRET pair. The substrates 2-AbzSAVLQSGTyr(3-NO2)R-OH, a truncated version of the established DABCYL/EDANS FRET substrate, and a new substrate 2-AbzVVTLQSGTyr(3-NO2)R-OH are promising candidates for screening and inhibitor characterization. In the latter substrate, the incorporation of Val at the position P5 improved the catalytic efficacy. Based on the obtained results, we present here a reproducible, reliable assay protocol using highly affordable buffer components.","Dražić, Tonko; Kühl, Nikos; Leuthold, Mila M.; Behnam, Mira A.
