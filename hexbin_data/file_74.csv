112,112,112,Prediction of RNA Pseudoknots Using Heuristic Modeling with Mapping and Sequential Folding,9.547557,7.0994363,2007-09-19,"Predicting RNA secondary structure is often the first step to determining the structure of RNA. Prediction approaches have historically avoided searching for pseudoknots because of the extreme combinatorial and time complexity of the problem. Yet neglecting pseudoknots limits the utility of such approaches. Here, an algorithm utilizing structure mapping and thermodynamics is introduced for RNA pseudoknot prediction that finds the minimum free energy and identifies information about the flexibility of the RNA. The heuristic approach takes advantage of the 5′ to 3′ folding direction of many biological RNA molecules and is consistent with the hierarchical folding hypothesis and the contact order model. Mapping methods are used to build and analyze the folded structure for pseudoknots and to add important 3D structural considerations. The program can predict some well known pseudoknot structures correctly. The results of this study suggest that many functional RNA sequences are optimized for proper folding. They also suggest directions we can proceed in the future to achieve even better results.","Dawson, Wayne K.; Fujiwara, Kazuya; Kawai, Gota",PLoS One,74,1

Although the traditional inactivated vaccine has been proved effective, it may lead to a new outbreak of FMD because of either incomplete inactivation of FMDV or the escape of live virus from vaccine production workshop. Thus, it is urgent to develop a novel FMDV vaccine that is safer, more effective and more economical than traditional vaccines. METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A recombinant silkworm baculovirus Bm-P12A3C which contained the intact P1-2A and 3C protease coding regions of FMDV Asia 1/HNK/CHA/05 was developed. Indirect immunofluorescence test and sandwich-ELISA were used to verify that Bm-P12A3C could express the target cassette. Expression products from silkworm were diluted to 30 folds and used as antigen to immunize cattle. Specific antibody was induced in all vaccinated animals. After challenge with virulent homologous virus, four of the five animals were completely protected, and clinical symptoms were alleviated and delayed in the remaining one. Furthermore, a PD(50) (50% bovine protective dose) test was performed to assess the bovine potency of the subunit vaccine. The result showed the subunit vaccine could achieve 6.34 PD(50) per dose. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that this strategy might be used to develop the new subunit FMDV vaccine.","Li, Zhiyong; Yi, Yongzhu; Yin, Xiangping; Zhang, Zhifang; Liu, Jixing",PLoS One,74,28
358,358,358,Binding of Herpes Simplex Virus Type-1 Virions Leads to the Induction of Intracellular Signalling in the Absence of Virus Entry,9.904751,7.0666122,2010-03-05,"The envelope of HSV-1 contains a number of glycoproteins, four of which are essential for virus entry. Virus particles lacking gB, gD, gH or gL are entry-defective, although these viruses retain the ability to bind to the plasma membrane via the remaining glycoproteins. Soluble forms of gD have been shown to trigger the nuclear translocation of the NF-κB transcriptional complex in addition to stimulating the production of Type I interferon. By taking advantage of the entry-defective phenotype of glycoprotein-deficient HSV-1 virus particles, the results presented here show that binding of virions to cellular receptors on the plasma membrane is sufficient to stimulate a change in cellular gene expression. Preliminary microarray studies, validated by quantitative real-time PCR, identified the differential expression of cellular genes associated with the NF-κB, PI3K/Akt, Jak/Stat and related Jak/Src pathways by virions lacking gB or gH but not gD. Gene induction occurred at a few particles per cell, corresponding to physiological conditions during primary infection. Reporter assay studies determined that NF-κB transcriptional activity is stimulated within an hour of HSV-1 binding, peaks between two and three hours post-binding and declines to background levels by five hours after induction. The immediate, transient nature of these signalling events suggests that HSV-1 glycoproteins, particularly gD, may alter the cellular environment pre-entry so as to condition the cell for viral replication.","MacLeod, Iain J.; Minson, Tony",PLoS One,74,28
364,364,364,NSs Encoded by Groundnut Bud Necrosis Virus Is a Bifunctional Enzyme,9.758861,7.1203933,2010-03-18,"Groundnut bud necrosis virus (GBNV), a member of genus Tospovirus in the family Bunyaviridae, infects a large number of leguminosae and solanaceae plants in India. With a view to elucidate the function of nonstructural protein, NSs encoded by the small RNA genome (S RNA), the NSs protein of GBNV- tomato (Karnataka) [1] was over-expressed in E. coli and purified by Ni-NTA chromatography. The purified rNSs protein exhibited an RNA stimulated NTPase activity. Further, this activity was metal ion dependent and was inhibited by adenosine 5′ (β, γ imido) triphosphate, an ATP analog. The rNSs could also hydrolyze dATP. Interestingly, in addition to the NTPase and dATPase activities, the rNSs exhibited ATP independent 5′ RNA/DNA phosphatase activity that was completely inhibited by AMP. The 5′ α phosphate could be removed from ssDNA, ssRNA, dsDNA and dsRNA thus confirming that rNSs has a novel 5′ α phosphatase activity. K189A mutation in the Walker motif A (GxxxxGKT) resulted in complete loss of ATPase activity, but the 5′ phosphatase activity was unaffected. On the other hand, D159A mutation in the Walker motif B (DExx) resulted in partial loss of both the activities. These results demonstrate for the first time that NSs is a bifunctional enzyme, which could participate in viral movement, replication or in suppression of the host defense mechanism.","Lokesh, Bhushan; Rashmi, Panigrahi R.; Amruta, Bhat S.; Srisathiyanarayanan, Dharmaiah; Murthy, Mathur R.

692,692,692,Inhibition of Interferon Induction and Action by the Nairovirus Nairobi Sheep Disease Virus/Ganjam Virus,9.902083,6.9735126,2011-12-05,"The Nairoviruses are an important group of tick-borne viruses that includes pathogens of man (Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever virus) and livestock animals (Dugbe virus, Nairobi sheep disease virus (NSDV)). NSDV is found in large parts of East Africa and the Indian subcontinent (where it is known as Ganjam virus). We have investigated the ability of NSDV to antagonise the induction and actions of interferon. Both pathogenic and apathogenic isolates could actively inhibit the induction of type 1 interferon, and also blocked the signalling pathways of both type 1 and type 2 interferons. Using transient expression of viral proteins or sections of viral proteins, these activities all mapped to the ovarian tumour-like protease domain (OTU) found in the viral RNA polymerase. Virus infection, or expression of this OTU domain in transfected cells, led to a great reduction in the incorporation of ubiquitin or ISG15 protein into host cell proteins. Point mutations in the OTU that inhibited the protease activity also prevented it from antagonising interferon induction and action. Interestingly, a mutation at a peripheral site, which had little apparent effect on the ability of the OTU to inhibit ubiquitination and ISG15ylation, removed the ability of the OTU to block the induction of type 1 and the action of type 2 interferons, but had a lesser effect on the ability to block type 1 interferon action, suggesting that targets other than ubiquitin and ISG15 may be involved in the actions of the viral OTU.","Holzer, Barbara; Bakshi, Siddharth; Bridgen, Anne; Baron, Michael D.",PLoS One,74,28
756,756,756,A Co-Opted DEAD-Box RNA Helicase Enhances Tombusvirus Plus-Strand Synthesis,9.905456,7.0716467,2012-02-16,"Replication of plus-strand RNA viruses depends on recruited host factors that aid several critical steps during replication. In this paper, we show that an essential translation factor, Ded1p DEAD-box RNA helicase of yeast, directly affects replication of Tomato bushy stunt virus (TBSV). To separate the role of Ded1p in viral protein translation from its putative replication function, we utilized a cell-free TBSV replication assay and recombinant Ded1p. The in vitro data show that Ded1p plays a role in enhancing plus-strand synthesis by the viral replicase. We also find that Ded1p is a component of the tombusvirus replicase complex and Ded1p binds to the 3′-end of the viral minus-stranded RNA. The data obtained with wt and ATPase deficient Ded1p mutants support the model that Ded1p unwinds local structures at the 3′-end of the TBSV (−)RNA, rendering the RNA compatible for initiation of (+)-strand synthesis. Interestingly, we find that Ded1p and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), which is another host factor for TBSV, play non-overlapping functions to enhance (+)-strand synthesis. Altogether, the two host factors enhance TBSV replication synergistically by interacting with the viral (−)RNA and the replication proteins. In addition, we have developed an in vitro assay for Flock house virus (FHV), a small RNA virus of insects, that also demonstrated positive effect on FHV replicase activity by the added Ded1p helicase. Thus, two small RNA viruses, which do not code for their own helicases, seems to recruit a host RNA helicase to aid their replication in infected cells.","Kovalev, Nikolay; Pogany, Judit; Nagy, Peter D.",PLoS Pathog,74,1

Wild animals serve as reservoirs for many viruses, which may occasionally result in novel infections of domestic animals and/or the human population. Given this background, we used metagenomics to investigate the presence of viral pathogens in sera collected from bushpigs (Potamochoerus larvatus), a nocturnal species of wild Suid known to move between national parks and farmland, in Uganda. RESULTS: Application of 454 pyrosequencing demonstrated the presence of Torque teno sus virus (TTSuV), porcine parvovirus 4 (PPV4), porcine endogenous retrovirus (PERV), a GB Hepatitis C–like virus, and a Sclerotinia hypovirulence-associated-like virus in sera from the bushpigs. PCR assays for each specific virus combined with Sanger sequencing revealed two TTSuV-1 variants, one TTSuV-2 variant as well as PPV4 in the serum samples and thereby confirming the findings from the 454 sequencing. CONCLUSIONS: Using a viral metagenomic approach we have made an initial analysis of viruses present in bushpig sera and demonstrated for the first time the presence of PPV4 in a wild African Suid. In addition we identified novel variants of TTSuV-1 and 2 in bushpigs.","Blomström, Anne-Lie; Ståhl, Karl; Masembe, Charles; Okoth, Edward; Okurut, Ademun Rose; Atmnedi, Patrick; Kemp, Stephen; Bishop, Richard; Belák, Sándor; Berg, Mikael",Virol J,74,28
1080,1080,1080,Coevolution between simple sequence repeats (SSRs) and virus genome size,9.794781,7.0585365,2012-08-30,"BACKGROUND: Relationship between the level of repetitiveness in genomic sequence and genome size has been investigated by making use of complete prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes, but relevant studies have been rarely made in virus genomes. RESULTS: In this study, a total of 257 viruses were examined, which cover 90% of genera. The results showed that simple sequence repeats (SSRs) is strongly, positively and significantly correlated with genome size. Certain repeat class is distributed in a certain range of genome sequence length. Mono-, di- and tri- repeats are widely distributed in all virus genomes, tetra- SSRs as a common component consist in genomes which more than 100 kb in size; in the range of genome < 100 kb, genomes containing penta- and hexa- SSRs are not more than 50%. Principal components analysis (PCA) indicated that dinucleotide repeat affects the differences of SSRs most strongly among virus genomes. Results showed that SSRs tend to accumulate in larger virus genomes; and the longer genome sequence, the longer repeat units. CONCLUSIONS: We conducted this research standing on the height of the whole virus. We concluded that genome size is an important factor in affecting the occurrence of SSRs; hosts are also responsible for the variances of SSRs content to a certain degree.","Zhao, Xiangyan; Tian, Yonglei; Yang, Ronghua; Feng, Haiping; Ouyang, Qingjian; Tian, You; Tan, Zhongyang; Li, Mingfu; Niu, Yile; Jiang, Jianhui; Shen, Guoli; Yu, Ruqin",BMC Genomics,74,28

NSDV is closely related to the human pathogen Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus, which also causes a haemorrhagic disease. As with other nairoviruses, replication of NSDV takes place in the cytoplasm and the new virus particles bud into the Golgi apparatus; however, the effect of viral replication on cellular compartments has not been studied extensively. We have found that the overall structure of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment and the Golgi were unaffected by infection with NSDV. However, we observed that NSDV infection led to the loss of protein disulphide isomerase (PDI), an oxidoreductase present in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and which assists during protein folding, from the ER. Further investigation showed that NSDV-infected cells have high levels of PDI at their surface, and PDI is also secreted into the culture medium of infected cells. Another chaperone from the PDI family, ERp57, was found to be similarly affected. Analysis of infected cells and expression of individual viral glycoproteins indicated that the NSDV PreGn glycoprotein is involved in redistribution of these soluble ER oxidoreductases. It has been suggested that extracellular PDI can activate integrins and tissue factor, which are involved respectively in pro-inflammatory responses and disseminated intravascular coagulation, both of which manifest in many viral haemorrhagic fevers. The discovery of enhanced PDI secretion from NSDV-infected cells may be an important finding for understanding the mechanisms underlying the pathogenicity of haemorrhagic nairoviruses.","Lasecka, Lidia; Baron, Michael D.",PLoS One,74,28

Whilst most respiratory viruses carry IFN antagonists, reports on human metapneumovirus (HMPV) have been conflicting. Using deep sequencing, we have demonstrated that HMPV particles accumulate excessive amounts of defective interfering RNA (DIs) rapidly upon in vitro passage, and that these are associated with IFN induction. Importantly, the DIs were edited extensively; up to 70 % of the original A and T residues had mutated to G or C, respectively. Such high editing rates of viral RNA have not, to our knowledge, been reported before. Bioinformatics and PCR assays indicated that adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR) was the most likely editing enzyme. HMPV thus has an unusually high propensity to generate DIs, which are edited at an unprecedented high frequency. The conflicting published data on HMPV IFN induction and antagonism are probably explained by DIs in virus stocks. The interaction of HMPV DIs with the RNA-editing machinery and IFN responses warrants further investigation.","van den Hoogen, Bernadette G.; van Boheemen, Sander; de Rijck, Jonneke; van Nieuwkoop, Stefan; Smith, Derek J.; Laksono, Brigitta; Gultyaev, Alexander; Osterhaus, Albert D.

The current study was designed to rigorously measure the reliability of a phylogenetic marker included into segment B. This marker can facilitate molecular epidemiology studies, incorporating this segment of the viral genome, to better explain the links between emergence, spreading and maintenance of the very virulent IBD virus (vvIBDV) strains worldwide. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Sequences of the segment B gene from IBDV strains isolated from diverse geographic locations were obtained from the GenBank Database; Cuban sequences were obtained in the current work. A phylogenetic marker named B-marker was assessed by different phylogenetic principles such as saturation of substitution, phylogenetic noise and high consistency. This last parameter is based on the ability of B-marker to reconstruct the same topology as the complete segment B of the viral genome. From the results obtained from B-marker, demographic history for both main lineages of IBDV regarding segment B was performed by Bayesian skyline plot analysis. Phylogenetic analysis for both segments of IBDV genome was also performed, revealing the presence of a natural reassortant strain with segment A from vvIBDV strains and segment B from non-vvIBDV strains within Cuban IBDV population. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This study contributes to a better understanding of the emergence of vvIBDV strains, describing molecular epidemiology of IBDV using the state-of-the-art methodology concerning phylogenetic reconstruction. This study also revealed the presence of a novel natural reassorted strain as possible manifest of change in the genetic structure and stability of the vvIBDV strains.

Furthermore, we also discuss the most recent findings: IFN-λ4 predicts treatment outcomes of HCV infection. In consideration of the apparent limitations of current HCV therapy, especially high failure rate and universal side effects, prediction of treatment outcomes prior to the initiation of treatment and developing new alternative drugs are two important goals in HCV research.","Liu, Bing; McGilvray, Ian; Chen, Limin",Gastroenterol Res Pract,74,28

Influenza B virus encodes non-structural protein 1 (NS1B) that binds human ISG15 and provides an appropriate model for determining how ISGylation affects virus replication in human cells. Here using a recombinant virus encoding a NS1B protein defective in ISG15 binding, we show that NS1B counteracts ISGylation-mediated antiviral activity by binding and sequestering ISGylated viral proteins, primarily ISGylated viral nucleoprotein (NP), in infected cells. ISGylated NP that is not sequestered by mutant NS1B acts as a dominant-negative inhibitor of oligomerization of the more abundant unconjugated NP. Consequently formation of viral ribonucleoproteins that catalyse viral RNA synthesis is inhibited, causing decreased viral protein synthesis and virus replication. We verify that ISGylated NP is largely responsible for inhibition of viral RNA synthesis by generating recombinant viruses that lack known ISGylation sites in NP.","Zhao, Chen; Sridharan, Haripriya; Chen, Ran; Baker, Darren P.; Wang, Shanshan; Krug, Robert M.",Nat Commun,74,28

Flaviviruses include numerous important human pathogens, e.g., dengue virus (DENV) and Zika virus (ZIKV). Here, we revealed a highly conserved, conformation-tunable cis-acting element named 5′-UAR-flanking stem (UFS) in the flavivirus genomic 5′ terminus. We demonstrated that the UFS was critical for efficient NS5 recruitment and viral RNA synthesis in different flaviviruses. Interestingly, stabilization of the DENV UFS impaired both genome cyclization and vRNA replication. Moreover, the UFS unwound in response to genome cyclization, leading to the decreased affinity of NS5 for the viral 5′ end. Thus, we propose that the UFS is switched by genome cyclization to regulate dynamic RdRp binding for vRNA replication. This study demonstrates that the UFS enables communication between flavivirus genome cyclization and RdRp recruitment, highlighting the presence of switch-like mechanisms among RNA viruses.

As the number of available RNA-protein binding experimental data has increased rapidly due to high-throughput sequencing methods, it is now possible to measure and understand RNA-protein interactions by computational methods. In this study, we integrate a sequence-based derived kernel with regularized least squares to perform prediction. The derived kernel exploits the contextual information around an amino acid or a nucleic acid as well as the repetitive conserved motif information. We propose a novel machine learning method, called RPiRLS to predict the interaction between any RNA and protein of known sequences. For the RPiRLS classifier, each protein sequence comprises up to 20 diverse amino acids but for the RPiRLS-7G classifier, each protein sequence is represented by using 7-letter reduced alphabets based on their physiochemical properties.

On the non-redundant benchmark test sets extracted from the PRIDB, the RPiRLS method outperformed RPI-Pred and IPMiner in terms of accuracy, specificity and sensitivity. Further, RPiRLS achieved an accuracy of 92% on the prediction of lncRNA-protein interactions. The proposed method can also be extended to construct RNA-protein interaction networks.

Currently, live-attenuated IBV vaccines are used to control the disease. However, safety, attenuation and immunization outcomes of current vaccines are not guaranteed. Several studies indicate that attenuated IBV vaccine strains contribute to the emergence of variant viruses in the field due to mutations and recombination. Therefore, there is a need to develop a stable and safe IBV vaccine that will not create variant viruses. In this study, we generated recombinant Newcastle disease viruses (rNDVs) expressing the S1, S2 and S proteins of IBV using reverse genetics technology. Our results showed that the rNDV expressing the S protein of IBV provided better protection than the rNDV expressing S1 or S2 protein of IBV, indicating that the S protein is the best protective antigen of IBV. Immunization of 4-week-old SPF chickens with the rNDV expressing S protein elicited IBV-specific neutralizing antibodies and provided complete protection against virulent IBV and virulent NDV challenges.

In this study, we observed that foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) infection significantly triggered EGR1 expression. Overexpression of EGR1 suppressed FMDV replication in porcine cells, and knockdown of EGR1 considerably promoted FMDV replication. A previously reported FMDV mutant virus (with two amino acids mutations in SAP domain) that displays a strong type I interferon (IFN) induction activity was used in this study. We found that SAP mutant FMDV infection induced a higher expression of EGR1 than wildtype FMDV infection, and also triggered higher IFN-β and IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) expression than wildtype FMDV infection. This implied a link between EGR1 and type I IFN signaling. Further study showed that overexpression of EGR1 resulted in Sendai virus (SeV)-induced IFN-stimulated response element (ISRE) and NF-κB promoter activation. In addition, the SeV-induced ISGs expression was impaired in EGR1 knockdown cells. EGR1 upregulation promoted type I IFN signaling activation and suppressed FMDV and Seneca Valley virus replication. Suppression of the transcriptional activity of EGR1 did not affect its antiviral effect against FMDV.

Evidence shows that LTβR is involved in various cellular processes; however, whether it plays a role in maintaining the cellular function of intestinal porcine enterocytes (IPEC-J2), specifically during porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) infection, remains unknown. In this study, we generated LTβR null IPEC-J2 cells using CRISPR/Cas9 to examine the importance of LTβR in cell proliferation, apoptosis, and the response to PEDV infection. Our results showed that the lack of LTβR leads to significantly decreased cell proliferation, potentially due to S phase arrest in LTβR(−/−) IPEC-J2 cells. Label-free digital holographic microscopy was used to record the three-dimensional morphology of both cell types for up to 72 hours and revealed significantly increased numbers of LTβR(−/−) cells undergoing apoptosis. Furthermore, we found that PEDV-infected LTβR(−/−) null IPEC-J2 cells exhibited significant suppression of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NFκB) target genes (interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8) and mucosal barrier integrity-related genes (vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM1) and IL-22), which may explain why LTβR(−/−) cells are more susceptible to PEDV infection. Collectively, our data not only demonstrate the key role of LTβR in intestinal porcine enterocytes, but also provide data for the improved understanding of the cellular response to PEDV infection.","Altawaty, Tawfeek; Liu, Lulu; Zhang, Hongyong; Tao, Cong; Hou, Shaohua; Li, Kui; Wang, Yanfang",Cells,74,28
3918,3918,3918,Microarray analysis of infectious bronchitis virus infection of chicken primary dendritic cells,9.599788,6.883874,2019-07-08,"BACKGROUND: Avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is a major respiratory disease-causing agent in birds that leads to significant losses. Dendritic cells (DCs) are specialised cells responsible for sampling antigens and presenting them to T cells, which also play an essential role in recognising and neutralising viruses. Recent studies have suggested that non-coding RNAs may regulate the functional program of DCs. Expression of host non-coding RNAs changes markedly during infectious bronchitis virus infection, but their role in regulating host immune function has not been explored. Here, microarrays of mRNAs, miRNAs, and lncRNAs were globally performed to analyse how avian DCs respond to IBV. RESULTS: First, we found that IBV stimulation did not enhance the maturation ability of avian DCs. Interestingly, inactivated IBV was better able than IBV to induce DC maturation and activate lymphocytes. We identified 1093 up-regulated and 845 down-regulated mRNAs in IBV-infected avian DCs. Gene Ontology analysis suggested that cellular macromolecule and protein location (GO-BP) and transcription factor binding (GO-MF) were abundant in IBV-stimulated avian DCs. Meanwhile, pathway analysis indicated that the oxidative phosphorylation and leukocyte transendothelial migration signalling pathways might be activated in the IBV group. Moreover, alteration of microRNAs (miRNAs) and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) was detected in IBV-stimulated avian DCs. In total, 19 significantly altered (7 up and 12 down) miRNAs and 101 (75 up and 26 down) lncRNAs were identified in the IBV-treated group. Further analysis showed that the actin cytoskeleton and MAPK signal pathway were related to the target genes of IBV-stimulated miRNAs. Finally, our study identified 2 TF-microRNA and 53 TF–microRNA–mRNA interactions involving 1 TF, 2 miRNAs, and 53 mRNAs in IBV-stimulated avian DCs. CONCLUSIONS: Our research suggests a new mechanism to explain why IBV actively blocks innate responses needed for inducing immune gene expression and also provides insight into the pathogenic mechanisms of avian IBV.

3982,3982,3982,Programmed −2/−1 Ribosomal Frameshifting in Simarteriviruses: an Evolutionarily Conserved Mechanism,9.635846,7.1902533,2019-07-30,"The −2/−1 programmed ribosomal frameshifting (−2/−1 PRF) mechanism in porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) leads to the translation of two additional viral proteins, nonstructural protein 2TF (nsp2TF) and nsp2N. This −2/−1 PRF mechanism is transactivated by a viral protein, nsp1β, and cellular poly(rC) binding proteins (PCBPs). Critical elements for −2/−1 PRF, including a slippery sequence and a downstream C-rich motif, were also identified in 11 simarteriviruses. However, the slippery sequences (XXXUCUCU instead of XXXUUUUU) in seven simarteriviruses can only facilitate −2 PRF to generate nsp2TF. The nsp1β of simian hemorrhagic fever virus (SHFV) was identified as a key factor that transactivates both −2 and −1 PRF, and the universally conserved Tyr111 and Arg114 in nsp1β are essential for this activity. In vitro translation experiments demonstrated the involvement of PCBPs in simarterivirus −2/−1 PRF. Using SHFV reverse genetics, we confirmed critical roles of nsp1β, slippery sequence, and C-rich motif in −2/−1 PRF in SHFV-infected cells. Attenuated virus growth ability was observed in SHFV mutants with impaired expression of nsp2TF and nsp2N. Comparative genomic sequence analysis showed that key elements of −2/−1 PRF are highly conserved in all known arteriviruses except equine arteritis virus (EAV) and wobbly possum disease virus (WPDV). Furthermore, −2/−1 PRF with SHFV PRF signal RNA can be stimulated by heterotypic nsp1βs of all non-EAV arteriviruses tested. Taken together, these data suggest that −2/−1 PRF is an evolutionarily conserved mechanism employed in non-EAV/-WPDV arteriviruses for the expression of additional viral proteins that are important for viral replication. IMPORTANCE Simarteriviruses are a group of arteriviruses infecting nonhuman primates, and a number of new species have been established in recent years. Although these arteriviruses are widely distributed among African nonhuman primates of different species, and some of them cause lethal hemorrhagic fever disease, this group of viruses has been undercharacterized. Since wild nonhuman primates are historically important sources or reservoirs of human pathogens, there is concern that simarteriviruses may be preemergent zoonotic pathogens. Thus, molecular characterization of simarteriviruses is becoming a priority in arterivirology. In this study, we demonstrated that an evolutionarily conserved ribosomal frameshifting mechanism is used by simarteriviruses and other distantly related arteriviruses for the expression of additional viral proteins. This mechanism is unprecedented in eukaryotic systems. Given the crucial role of ribosome function in all living systems, the potential impact of the in-depth characterization of this novel mechanism reaches beyond the field of virology.","Li, Yanhua; Firth, Andrew E.; Brierley, Ian; Cai, Yingyun; Napthine, Sawsan; Wang, Tao; Yan, Xingyu; Kuhn, Jens H.; Fang, Ying",J Virol,74,1
4024,4024,4024,Blockade of EGFR Activation Promotes TNF-Induced Lung Epithelial Cell Apoptosis and Pulmonary Injury,9.963145,6.8450675,2019-08-17,"Pneumonitis is the leading cause of death associated with the use of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) against non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, the risk factors and the mechanism underlying this toxicity have not been elucidated. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) has been reported to transactivate EGFR in pulmonary epithelial cells. Hence, we aimed to test the hypothesis that EGFR tyrosine kinase activity regulates TNF-mediated bronchial epithelial cell survival, and that inhibition of EGFR activity increases TNF-induced lung epithelial cell apoptosis. We used surfactant protein C (SPC)-TNF transgenic (tg) mice which overexpress TNF in the lungs. In this model, gefitinib, an EGFR-TKI, enhanced lung epithelial cell apoptosis and lymphocytic inflammation, indicating that EGFR tyrosine kinase prevents TNF-induced lung injury. Furthermore, IL-17A was significantly upregulated by gefitinib in SPC-TNF tg mice and p38MAPK activation was observed, indicative of a pathway involved in lung epithelial cell apoptosis. Moreover, in lung epithelial cells, BEAS-2B, TNF stimulated EGFR transactivation via the TNF-α-converting enzyme in a manner that requires heparin binding (HB)-EGF and transforming growth factor (TGF)-α. These novel findings have significant implications in understanding the role of EGFR in maintaining human bronchial epithelial cell homeostasis and in NSCLC treatment.","Yamaoka, Toshimitsu; Arata, Satoru; Homma, Mayumi; Homma, Tetsuya; Kusumoto, Sojiro; Ando, Koichi; Manabe, Ryou; Kishino, Yasunari; Ohba, Motoi; Tsurutani, Junji; Takimoto, Masafumi; Ohmori, Tohru; Sagara, Hironori",Int J Mol Sci,74,8

In this study, nuclear localization of ORF2 was demonstrated by fluorescence observation and subcellular fractionation assays in ORF2-transfected PK-15 cells. The subcellular localization of truncated ORF2 indicated that the 38 N-terminal amino acids were responsible for the nuclear localization of ORF2. The truncated and site-directed mutagenesis of this domain were constructed, and the results demonstrated that the basic amino acid residues at positions 8–32 were essential for the strict nuclear localization. The basic motifs (8)RRR-R-RRR(16) and (16)RRRHRRR(22) were further shown to be the key functional nucleolar localization signals that guide PCV3 ORF2 into nucleoli. Furthermore, sequence analysis showed that the amino acids of PCV3 nuclear localization signals were highly conserved. Overall, this study provides insight into the biological and functional characteristics of the PCV3 ORF2 protein.","Mou, Chunxiao; Wang, Minmin; Pan, Shuonan; Chen, Zhenhai",Viruses,74,1

Virtually all commercially available vaccines are inactivated whole-virus vaccines produced in cell culture, but the adaptation of a field isolate of the virus to growth in culture is laborious and time-consuming. This is of particular concern for the development of vaccines to newly emerging virus lineages, where long lead times from virus isolate to vaccine can delay the implementation of effective control programs. High antigen yields in production cells are also necessary to make vaccines affordable for less developed countries in endemic areas.

Cost of health care is one of the factors preventing access to quality health services and universal health coverage. In Nepal, the majority of expenses related to newborn care are borne by the caregiver, regardless of socioeconomic status. We conducted a study to assess the out of pocket expenditure (OOPE) for sick newborn care in hospitals in Nepal. METHODS: This cross-sectional study of hospital care for newborns was conducted in 11 hospitals in Nepal and explored OOPE incurred by caregivers for sick newborn care. Data were collected from the caregivers of the sick newborn on the topics of cost of travel, accommodation, treatment (drugs, diagnosis) and documented on a sick newborn case record form. RESULTS: Data were collected from 814 caregivers. Cost of caregivers’ stay accounted for more than 40% of the OOPE for sick newborn care, followed by cost of travel, and the baby’s stay and treatment. The overall OOPE ranged from 13.6 to 226.1 US dollars (USD). The median OOPE was highest for preterm complications ($33.2 USD; CI 14.0–226.1), followed by hyperbilirubinemia ($31.9 USD; CI 14.0–60.7), respiratory distress syndrome ($26.9 USD; 15.3–121.5), neonatal sepsis ($ 25.8 USD; CI 13.6–139.8) and hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy ($23.4 USD; CI 13.6–97.7). DISCUSSION FOR PRACTICE: In Nepal, OOPE for sick newborn care in hospitals varied by neonatal morbidity and duration of stay. The largest proportion of OOPE were for accommodation and travel. Affordable and accessible health care will substantially reduce the OOPE for sick newborn care in hospitals.","Sunny, Avinash K.; Gurung, Rejina; Gurung, Abhishek; Basnet, Omkar; KC, Ashish",Matern Child Health J,74,1

A number of modelling efforts have investigated the interaction between the disease transmission dynamics and human behaviour change mediated by news coverage and by information spreading in the population. Yet, given the scarcity of data on public awareness during an epidemic, few studies have relied on empirical data. Here, we use fine-grained, geo-referenced data from three online sources—Wikipedia, the GDELT Project and the Internet Archive—to quantify population-scale information seeking about the 2016 Zika virus epidemic in the U.S., explicitly linking such behavioural signal to epidemiological data. Geo-localized Wikipedia pageview data reveal that visiting patterns of Zika-related pages in Wikipedia were highly synchronized across the United States and largely explained by exposure to national television broadcast. Contrary to the assumption of some theoretical epidemic models, news volume and Wikipedia visiting patterns were not significantly correlated with the magnitude or the extent of the epidemic. Attention to Zika, in terms of Zika-related Wikipedia pageviews, was high at the beginning of the outbreak, when public health agencies raised an international alert and triggered media coverage, but subsequently exhibited an activity profile that suggests nonlinear dependencies and memory effects in the relation between information seeking, media pressure, and disease dynamics. This calls for a new and more general modelling framework to describe the interaction between media exposure, public awareness and disease dynamics during epidemic outbreaks.","Tizzoni, Michele; Panisson, André; Paolotti, Daniela; Cattuto, Ciro",PLoS Comput Biol,74,28

Astrocytic changes were similar in both murine and canine cultures and consisted of loss of processes, cell fusion, and cell necrosis. Marked oligodendroglial lesions were apparent in the canine brain cultures and were characterized by focal perikaryal protrusions, swelling and loss of cell processes, and cell necrosis. Fusion between oligodendrocytes was not observed. Fusion between astrocytes and oligodendrocytes could not be documented with double labeling techniques.

The mechanism of acute demyelination in distemper is still poorly understood. The initial demyelinating lesion in distemper is directly virus induced, since there is a clear correlation between the occurrence of demyelination and CDV replication in the cells of the white matter. Yet, there is little evidence for oligodendroglial infection. Changes of these cells have been reported in vitro and in vivo. The in vitro studies showed that – in contrast to other cells such as astrocytes and macrophages – oligodendrocytes hardly express CDV protein. However, we could show that these cells underwent a restricted infection with transcription of CDV RNA and that this phenomenon correlated with down-regulation of myelin gene transcription. The extension of these in vitro findings in vivo was obscured by the lack of reliable oligodendrocyte labelling techniques in canine brain tissue sections. In this study we combined immunohistochemistry with in situ hybridization to examine oligodendrocytes in demyelinating lesions and to investigate the question of oligodendrocyte infection in vivo. We could demonstrate that CDV infection leads to massive down-regulation of myelin gene expression in demyelinating lesions and that this effect correlates in part with a restricted infection of oligodendrocytes.","Zurbriggen, A.; Schmid, I.; Graber, H.

These results indicate that the immune response is partially responsible for the development of resistance to OC43 infection but that it is only partially protective and other factors must also be required. The basis for the unique susceptibility of neural tissues in suckling mice is being investigated.","Pearson, J.; Mims, C. A.",Arch Virol,74,1

The primers for the PCR were chosen from the ORF 6 gene encoding the unglycosylated membrane protein (M). Viral RNA from cell culture fluids infected with each of the seven EAV strains and RNA from the live vaccine, Arvac, was detected by PCR using four sets of primers. The sensitivity of detection was increased from 100 to 1000 times by performing nested PCR enabling the detection of RNA at a level of 0.5–5 PFU. Differentiation among the virus strains and the live vaccine was achieved by cutting the PCR-amplified products from three sets of primers with six restriction endonucleases. Using this procedure it was possible to distinguish among the seven EAV strains used.","Sekiguchi, K.; Sugita, S.; Fukunaga, Y.; Kondo, T.; Wada, R.; Kamada, M.; Yamaguchi, S.",Arch Virol,74,1

We identified amino acids involved in a serotype specific, conformationally dependent epitope by analysis of the S1 gene of 13 monoclonal antibody-neutralization-resistant mutants. Substitutions in the predicted amino acid sequence of these mutants were located at residues 304 and/or 386. Most of the substitutions at residue 304 were from threonine to isoleucine, whereas the substitutions at residue 386 were from arginine to proline, histidine, cysteine, or tryptophan. Based on this data, it appears that AA residues at 304 and 386 on the S1 glycoprotein are involved in a virus neutralizing serotype specific epitope.","Moore, K. M.; Jackwood, M. W.; Hilt, D.

The PLPV genomic RNA comprises 3884 nt and contains six open reading frames (ORFs) potentially encoding proteins of 27 (p27), 13 (p13), 87 (p87), 7 (p7), 6 (p6), and 37 kDa (p37), respectively. The arrangement of these ORFs on the PLPV genome closely resembles that of members of the genus Carmovirus in the family Tombusviridae and, moreover, most of the putative PLPV gene products showed high identity with proteins of this viral group. However, several striking differences were noticed. Carmoviruses generate two subgenomic RNAs whereas PLPV produces a single one. In addition, only p7 showed similarity with movement proteins of carmoviruses whereas p6 (as p13) has no viral (or other) homologs. This protein might be expressed from a non-canonical start codon or, alternatively, through a −1 frameshift (FS) mechanism. Both, the production of one subgenomic RNA and the likely involvement of a −1 FS for expression of an internal ORF parallel the translation strategies reported for the unique species of the genus Panicovirus, belonging also to the family Tombusviridae. Overall, the results support the placement of PLPV in this family although its peculiar characteristics preclude its direct assignment to any of the current genera.","Castaño, A.; Hernández, C.",Arch Virol,74,1

Suckling mice were given the MAbs by passive transfer followed by lethal Hantaan virus challenge. All neutralizing MAbs detected by either FRNT or FINT protected all mice from lethal infection, confirming the importance of the antigenic sites as a protective antigen. Mice given non-neutralizing MAbs by passive transfer, however, began to die earlier than the control group; mean time to death (18.2±2.1 to 21.5±2.8 days) being significantly shorter than that of the control group (25.8±1.8, p<0.01, Mann-Whitney,U probability test).

No data is available on HFNC use in the general pediatric ward. The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of HFNC oxygen therapy in infants hospitalized in a pediatric ward for moderate–severe bronchiolitis and to assess the changes in ventilatory parameters before and after starting HFNC support. This prospective observational pilot study was carried out during the bronchiolitis season 2011–2012 in a pediatric tertiary care academic center in Italy. Interruptions of HFNC therapy and possible side effects or escalation to other forms of respiratory support were recorded. Oxygen saturation (SpO(2)), end-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO(2)), and respiratory rate (RR), measured for a baseline period of 1 h before and at specific time intervals in 48 h after the start of HFNC were recorded. Twenty-seven infants were included (median age 1.3 months; absolute range 0.3–8.5). No adverse events, no premature HFNC therapy termination, and no escalation to other forms of respiratory support were recorded. Median SpO(2) significantly increased by 1–2 points after changing from standard oxygen to HFNC (p <0.001). Median ETCO(2) and RR rapidly decreased by 6–8 mmHg and 13–20 breaths per minute, respectively, in the first 3 h of HFNC therapy (p <0.001) and remained steady thereafter. Conclusions: Use of HFNC for oxygen administration is feasible for infants with moderate–severe bronchiolitis in a general pediatric ward. In these children, HFNC therapy improves oxygen saturation levels and seems to be associated with a decrease in both ETCO(2) and RR.","Bressan, Silvia; Balzani, Marco; Krauss, Baruch; Pettenazzo, Andrea; Zanconato, Stefania; Baraldi, Eugenio",Eur J Pediatr,74,28

Chronic infection with HepCV has also been linked to the development of hepatocellular carcinoma. Chimpanzees and marmosets are the only animals found to be experimentally infectable and the virus has not been propagated in any cell culture system. HepCV is an enveloped virus with a diameter of 30–60 nm and a 10-kb positive-stranded RNA genome. Its genome organization resembles that of the flaviviruses and pestiviruses. A 5′-untranslated segment of 341 nucleotides precedes a continuous ORF of 9030/9033 nucleotides which is followed by a 54 nucleotides long 3′-non-coding segment. Further work is required to resolve the question of whether the genomic RNA possesses a 3′-poly(U) or poly(A) tail. The genome also carries an internal poly(A) segment towards the 5′-end of its ORF. Genomic RNA is probably translated into a single polyprotein of 3010/3011 amino acids which is processed into functional proteins. The viral proteins have not been identified, but on the basis of the predicted amino acid sequences, hydrophobicity plots, location of potential glycosylation sites and similarities of these properties to those of pesti- and flaviviruses, the following genome organization has been predicted. The predicted viral structural proteins, a nucleocapsid protein and two envelope glycoproteins are located at the aminoterminal end of the polyprotein. They are followed by a highly hydrophobic protein and proteins that exhibit proteinase, helicase and replicase domains and thus are probably involved in RNA replication and protein processing. The replicase domain is located close to the carboxy terminus of the polyprotein. Although the overall nucleotide and amino acid homologies between HepCV and pestiviruses are low, a number of similarities exist that point to a closer ancestral relationship to the latter than the flaviviruses. First, the 5′-untranslated segment of the HepCV genome resembles that of the pestivirus genomes in size and presence of several short ORFs and it contains several segments with high nucleotide homology. Second, the two putative envelope glycoproteins of HepCV resemble two of the three putative envelope glycoproteins of the pestiviruses. Because its genome organization and predicted virion structure closely resemble those of the flaviviruses and pestiviruses, HepCV has been proposed to be placed in the familyFlaviviridae. It has been suggested to be classified as a new third genus in this family because it is only remotely related to the pestiviruses and flaviviruses in nucleotide sequence of its genome and the amino acid sequences of the predicted viral proteins. On the basis of genomic sequence information, an immunoprobe has been devised for screening blood supplies and donors for anti-HepCV antibodies to a non-structural protein of HepCV. The immuno-assay exhibits a high efficiency in detecting infected donors, though one caveat is that antibodies to the test antigen develop in infected individuals only between 2 and 8 months post infection. On the other hand, viral RNA can be detected in plasma by reverse transcription and amplification of the cDNA by PCR within a few days post infection. Thus the latter technique may become more important in the detection of HepCV in blood and tissues once the technique becomes more widely established as a diagnostic tool. The untranslated 5′-segment has been found to be highly conserved in the genomes of different HepCV isolates from various parts of the world. The replicase domain is also highly conserved, but considerable amino acid and nucleotide differences exist in other segments of the long ORFs of various HepCV isolates. Divergence among different isolates is particularly great (up to 30%) in the segment encoding the two putative envelope glycoproteins and the upstream hydrophobic protein. The variability in envelope glycoproteins needs to be considered in the development of immuno-probes and of vaccines for HepCV.","Plagemann, P. G. W.",Arch Virol,74,1

In order to understand the cleavage mechanism, molecular modeling tools were utilized to study the coupled model systems of the proteases, i.e., trypsin and furin and peptides of the cleavage sites specific to H5N1 and H1 HAs, which constitute models of HA precursor in complex with cleavage proteases. The peptide segments ‘RERRRKKR ↓ G’ and ‘SIQSR ↓ G’ from the high pathogenic H5N1 H5 and the low pathogenic H1N1 H1 cleavage sites were docking to the trypsin and furin active pockets, respectively. It was observed through the docking studies that trypsin was able to recognize and cleave both the high pathogenic and low pathogenic hemagglutinin, while furin could only cleave the high pathogenic hemagglutinin. An analysis of binding energies indicated that furin got most of its selectivity due to the interactions with P(1), P(4), and P(6), while having less interaction with P(2) and little interactions with P(3), P(5), P(7), and P(8). Some mutations of H5N1 H5 cleavage sequence fitted less well into furin and would reduce high pathogenicity of the virus.

A recent assessment found that nearly one-third (32%, 1,856 species) of the world’s amphibian species are threatened. Amphibians have existed on the earth for over 300 million years, yet in just the last two decades there have been an alarming number of extinctions, nearly 168 species are believed to have gone extinct and at least 2,469 (43%) more have populations that are declining. Infectious diseases have been recognized as one major cause of worldwide amphibian population declines. This could be the result of the appearance of novel pathogens, or it could be that exposure to environmental stressors is increasing the susceptibility of amphibians to opportunistic pathogens. Here I review the potential effects of stressors on disease susceptibility in amphibians and relate this to disease emergence in human and other wildlife populations. I will present a series of case studies that illustrate the role of stress in disease outbreaks that have resulted in amphibian declines. First, I will examine how elevated sea-surface temperatures in the tropical Pacific since the mid-1970s have affected climate over much of the world and could be setting the stage for pathogen-mediated amphibian declines in many regions. Finally, I will discuss how the apparently rapid increase in the prevalence of amphibian limb deformities is linked to the synergistic effects of trematode infection and exposure to chemical contaminants.","Kiesecker, Joseph M.",Ecol Res,74,28

Appellations for this clinical syndrome have included atypical pneumonia, infantile pneumonitis, interstitial pneumonia, viral pneumonia, or nonbacterial pneumonia.(5) Despite this confusion of names, most clinicians are familiar with the clinical picture of a patient with a pneumonia that is not a typical lobar or lobular process as seen with pyogenic bacteria such a Streptococcus pneumoniae. 1.. Acute or subacute onset; 2.. Lack of fever or low-grade fever (< 102°F); 3.. Clinical signs suggestive of a pulmonary process such as cough, tachypnea, or mild to moderate respiratory distress; 4..

Lack of evidence of on acute pyogenic bacterial process such as a normal or only mildly elevated white blood cell count and no response to -lactam antibiotics such as amoxicillin or cephalosporins.(24.) This definition is intended to apply to the majority of children, but clearly there are exceptions. For instance, some infants with an atypical pneumonia present with fever. Terms that imply a etiologic agent such as nonbacterial pneumonia should be avoided because bacterial agents are actually common causes of afebrile pneumonia, as is discussed. This article focuses mainly on afebrile pneumonia in infants, in particular, those younger than 6 months of age. Comparison are made to pneumonia in older children.

Thus some clues about the role of protein-bound carbohydrate can be obtained by comparing the biochemical fates and functions of glycosylated proteins with their non-glycosylated counterparts, or with proteins exhibiting differences in the type of oligosaccharide side chains. Cells infected with enveloped viruses are good systems for studying both aspects of protein glycosylation, since they contain a limited number of different glycoproteins, often with well-defined functions. Tunicamycin, and antibiotic, as well as several sugar analogues have been found to act as inhibitors of protein glycosylation by virtue of their anti-viral properties. They interfere with various steps in the dolichol pathway resulting in a lack of functional-linked oligosaccharide precursors. Compounds that interfere with oligosaccharide trimming represent a second generation of inhibitors of glycosylation. They are glycosidase inhibitors that interfere with the processing glucosidases and mannosidases and, as a result, the conversion of high-mannose into complex-type oligosaccharides is blocked. Depending upon the compound used, glycoproteins contain glucosylated-high-mannose, high-mannose or hybrid oligosaccharide structures instead of complex ones. The biological consequences of the alterations caused by the inhibitors are manifold: increased susceptibility to proteases, improper protein processing and misfolding of polypeptide chains, loss of biological activity and alteration of the site of virus-budding, to name but a few.","McDowell, William; Schwarz, Ralph T.",Biochimie,74,1

This chapter discusses one mechanism used by viruses to persist—namely, the selection of a variant virus in which changes in the sequence of a CTL epitope abrogate recognition. The unique features of cytotoxic CD8 T cell function in the central nervous system (CNS) are discussed. The role of CTL escape mutants in the viral evasion of the immune system and subsequent disease progression in non-CNS infections are summarized. The immune response in the CNS is similar to the response in extraneural tissue, but several aspects of the activation of the immune response, cellular trafficking, and antigen presentation are unique to the CNS. Although the CNS has classically been considered a site of immune privilege, surveillance of the normal CNS by circulating, activated lymphocytes occurs, with a limited number of lymphocytes being present in the normal CNS at any given time. In mice infected with mouse hepatitis virus and in some humans persistently infected with human immunodeficiency virus type1, hepatitis B virus or hepatitis C virus, CTL escape mutants play an important role in virus amplification and disease progression.","Perlman, Stanley; Wu, Gregory F.",Adv Virus Res,74,28

For influenza A virus infections, both oral amantadine and rimantadine are effectvive when used for seasonal prophylaxis and for prophylaxis in institutional populations. Both of these drugs, as well as aerosilized ribavirin, have antiviral and therapeutic effects in uncomplicated influenza. It remains to be determined whether any of these modalities or possibly their combined use [44] will be useful in treating severe influenza in hospitalized patients or whether they can prevent the development of complications in high risk patients. Unfortunately, there is no parenteral formulation of amantadine or rimantadine for use in critically in patients. Aerosolized ribavirin has also been shown to have modest therapeutic effects in influenza B virus infection. However, a major need exists for an antiviral which is active against influenza B virus and which can be used on an outpatient basis. Controlled clinical trials have shown that aerosolized ribavirin therapy improves arterial oxygenation and modifies the severity fo respiratory syncytil virus bronchiolitis and pneumonia [3,5]. Its role in treatinglife-threatening disease or in dodifying the long-term sequelae of RSV infections are unknown at the present time. Again, a specific antiviral agent is needed for out-patient use in preventing or treating RSV infections. Finally, after over a decade of work since the original observation that intranasal interferon could prevent experimental rhinoirus infection [11], recent studies have established that intranasal rIFN-a2 is effective in the postexposure prophylaxis of rhinovirus colds in families [42]. This strategy needs to be studied with regard to the prevention of infection and its complications in high risk patients and it remains to be determined whether intranasal interferen will have therapeutic activity in established colds.","Hayden, Frederick G.",Antiviral Res,74,3

There has been no test for warm temperate rain forests (WTRFs), but they offer a promising testing ground because they differ widely in the extent of disturbance. WTRF is dominated by microphylls sensu Raunkiaer and has a simpler structure and range of physiognomy than tropical or subtropical rain forests. It occurs in six parts of the world: eastern Asia, New Zealand, Chile, South Africa, SE Australia and the Azores. On the Azores it has been mostly destroyed, so we studied instead the subtropical montane rain forest (STMRF) on the Canary Islands which also represents a relict of the kind of WTRF that once stretched across southern Eurasia. We sought to find whether in these six regions the proportion of tree species needing canopy gaps for establishment reflects the frequency and/or extent of canopy disturbance by wind, landslide, volcanic eruptions (lava flow and ash fall), flood or fire. We used standard floras and ecological accounts to draw up lists of core tree species commonly reaching 5 m height. We excluded species which are very rare, very localized in distribution, or confined to special habitats, e.g. coastal forests or rocky sites. We used published accounts and our own experience to classify species into three groups: (1) needing canopy gaps for establishment; (2) needing either light shade throughout or a canopy gap relatively soon (a few months or years) after establishment; and (3) variously more shade‐tolerant. Group 1 species were divided according the kind of canopy opening needed: tree‐fall gap, landslide, lava flow, flood or fire. Only some of the significant differences in proportion of Group 1 species were consistent with differences in the extent of disturbance; even in some of those cases other factors seem likely to have had a major determining influence during evolution. We also sought to determine whether the species that are at least ‘short‐term persistent’ in the soil seed bank (lasting 2–4 years) are all species needing canopy gaps for establishment. The answer was negative; large numbers of seeds of some shade‐tolerants accumulate in the soil, and these species are able to benefit from soil disturbance in deep shade. We found a significant and strong positive relationship in Japan between mean seed mass and mature tree height, a weak positive relationship in New Zealand and no relationship in any of the other four regions. When comparing the seed mass values of Group 1 and Group 3 species we obtained different answers depending on whether or not we confined ourselves to taxonomically controlled contrasts. In only two of the four regions with an appreciable number of species in Group 1 is the mean seed mass of such species significantly lower than that of Group 3 species when taxonomic relatedness is ignored.","Grubb, Peter J.; Bellingham, Peter J.; Kohyama, Takashi S.; Piper, Frida I.; Valido, Alfredo",Biol Rev Camb Philos Soc,74,1

Accumulation of natural killer (NK) cells at day 3 postinfection (p.i.) was shown to be radiation‐sensitive, implying that proliferation was required for this response. Accumulation occurred in splenectomized mice, indicating that the spleen, known to be an organ for mature NK cell proliferation, was not the major source for liver and peritoneal NK/LGL. Significant percentages (> 25%) of the LGL found in the liver and peritoneal cavity following viral infection or interferon induction with poly‐inosinic:pory‐cytidylic acid were defined morphologically as blasts (large cells with prominent nucleoli and intensely basophilic cytoplasms containing azurophilic granules). Most blast LGL at day 3 p.i. were sensitive to administration of anti‐asialo GM(1) serum in vivo, were Lyt‐2(‐), and were enriched in populations that lysed NK cell‐sensitive targets in vitro, indicating that these were NK/LGL. At day 3 p.i., leukocytes from the liver and peritoneal cavity incorporated (3)H‐thymidine and bound to and killed NK cell‐sensitive targets in single‐cell cytotoxicity assays. These data suggest that NK/LGL undergo at least one round of division in the liver and peritoneal cavity during viral infection. In contrast, blast LGL at day 7 p.i. were resistant to in vivo treatments with anti‐asialo GM(1) serum, were Lyt‐2(+), and were enriched in populations of cells that killed virus‐infected histocompatible targets, indicating that they were cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL). These results suggest that both NK/LGL and CTL/LGL are capable of blastogenesis and presumed proliferation at sites of virus infection, providing a means for the in situ augmentation of a host's cell‐mediated antiviral defenses.","McIntyre, Kim W.; Natuk, Robert J.; Biron, Christine A.; Kase, Kenneth; Greenberger, Joel; Welsh, Raymond M.",J Leukoc Biol,74,28

This gene encodes the ADP-ribosylhydrolase enzyme (ARH3) that eliminates the addition of poly-ADP ribose (PAR) in the cellular stress onto proteins in the ADP-ribosylation process in which adding one or more ADP-ribose moieties onto the target proteins in the post-translational modification have occurred. In this study, we report a new case of CONDSIAS in the Iranian population. A literature review of CONDSIAS is also included. CASE PRESENTATION: A four-year-old female patient, born to a consanguineous Iranian family, was referred with various clinical symptoms including impaired speech, variable ataxia, infrequent seizures, and gradual onset of truncal hypotonia. Over time, she developed complete motor and speech regression, bilateral sensorineural hearing loss, infrequent seizures, abdominal distension and gastrointestinal (GI) intolerance, and loss of consciousness. To better molecularly diagnose, trio-whole-exome sequencing (WES) was performed on the proband and her parents. Sanger sequencing was also applied to investigate co-segregation analysis. Using in silico predictive tools, the possible impacts of the variant on the structure and function of ADPRHL2 protein were predicted. All basic metabolic tests were normal, while serial coronal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed progressive cerebral and cerebellar atrophy in addition to cerebral white matter signal changes as a novel neuroimaging finding. GI intolerance was another novelty of clinical scenarios in the patient. An auditory brainstem response test showed a severe bilateral sensorineural hearing loss. An electroencephalogram also confirmed focal seizures. From the molecular perspective, a novel homozygous frameshift variant in the ADPRHL2 gene (NM_017825.2; c.636_639del, p.(Leu212fs)) was identified by WES. CONCLUSIONS: CONDSIAS is an ultra-rare neurodegenerative disorder.

Highly accurate diagnostics are important in low Schistosoma transmission areas. Pregnant women and young children could particularly benefit from antigen testing as praziquantel (PZQ) can be given to only confirmed Schistosoma cases. This prevents the unborn baby from unnecessary exposure to PZQ. We present here the protocol of a diagnostic study that forms part of the freeBILy project. The aim is to evaluate the accuracy of circulating anodic antigen (CAA) detection for diagnosis of Schistosoma haematobium infections in pregnant women and to validate CAA as an endpoint measure for anti-Schistosoma drug efficacy. The study will also investigate Schistosoma infections in infants. METHODS: A set of three interlinked prospective, observational studies is conducted in Gabon. The upconverting phosphor lateral flow (UCP-LF) CAA test is the index diagnostic test that will be evaluated. The core trial, sub-study A, comprehensively evaluates the accuracy of the UCP-LF CAA urine test against a set of other Schistosoma diagnostics in a cross-sectional trial design. Women positive for S. haematobium will proceed with sub-study B and will be randomised to receive PZQ treatment immediately or after delivery followed by weekly sample collection. This approach includes comparative monitoring of CAA levels following PZQ intake and will also contribute further data for safety of PZQ administration during pregnancy. Sub-study C is a longitudinal study to determine the incidence of S. haematobium infection as well as the age for first infection in life-time. DISCUSSION: The freeBILy trial in Gabon will generate a comprehensive set of data on the accuracy of the UCP-LF CAA test for the detection of S. haematobium infection in pregnant women and newborn babies and for the use of CAA as a marker to determine PZQ efficacy. Furthermore, incidence of Schistosoma infection in infants will be reported. Using the ultrasensitive diagnostics, this information will be highly relevant for Schistosoma prevalence monitoring by national control programs as well as for the development of medicaments and vaccines.

Recently, additional data revealed that Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) perinatal exposure via lactation causes lasting behavioral and neuronal consequences (Scheyer et al., 2020a). Here, the long-term effects in adult offspring of maternal exposure to the synthetic cannabinoid agonist WIN 55,12,2 are reported. The data demonstrate that rats exposed during lactation to WIN display social and motivational deficits at adulthood. These behavioral changes were paralleled by a specific loss of endocannabinoid-mediated long-term depression (eCB-LTD) in the PFC and nucleus accumbens (NAc), while other forms of synaptic plasticity remained intact.

The present study investigated the occurrence of bovine papillomatosis among cattle (n = 308) with cutaneous warts on the head and neck from New valley Province, Egypt through molecular detection of BPV-1, -2, -4, -5, and -10. The work also involved a phylogenetic analysis of the positive samples for detection of the genetic relatedness of the virus. Interestingly, BPV-1 DNA was detected in 84.6% of the collected samples. Furthermore, the study included the development of an isothermal nucleic acid amplification test, which is a field test combining molecular and lateral flow immunoassays for point-of-need testing appropriate for veterinary use in resource-limited settings. Collectively, our study provided interesting data related to the combined use of molecular and immunoassays methods in the detection of the virus besides better understanding the genetic relatedness of the circulating genotypes of BPV-1 in Egypt. Our study suggested further research to explore more about the other genotypes of BPV in the Egyptian environment that could be helpful for the implementation of control strategies for combating this disease. ABSTRACT: Bovine papillomatosis is a viral disease of cattle causing cutaneous warts. A diagnosis of this viral infection is very mandatory for combating the resulting economic losses. Given the limited data available about bovine papillomavirus (BPV) in Egypt, the present study involved the molecular diagnosis of bovine papillomavirus type-1 (BPV-1), -2, -4, -5, and -10 in cattle presenting cutaneous warts on the head and neck from New Valley Province, Egypt. The phylogenetic analysis of the detected types of BPV was also performed, followed by developing a point-of-need molecular assay for the rapid identification of identified BPV types. In this regard, a total of 308 cattle from private farms in Egypt were clinically examined, of which 13 animals presented cutaneous warts due to suspected BPV infection. The symptomatic animals were treated surgically, and biopsies from skin lesions were collected for BPV-1, -2, -4, -5, and -10 molecular identification using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The presence of BPV-1 DNA was confirmed in 11 collected samples (84.6%), while BPV-2, -4, -5, and -10 were not detected. Sequencing of the PCR products suggested the Egyptian virus is closely related to BPV found in India. An isothermal nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) with labeled primers specific for the BPV-1 L1 gene sequence, and based on recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA), in combination with a lateral flow strip assay for the detection of RPA products, was developed and tested. The point-of-need molecular assay demonstrated a diagnostic utility comparable to PCR-based testing. Taken together, the present study provides interesting molecular data related to the occurrence of BPV-1 in Egypt and reveals the genetic relatedness of the Egyptian BPV-1 with BPV-1 found in buffalo in India. In addition, a simple, low-cost combined test was also validated for diagnosis of the infection. The present study suggests the necessity of future investigations about the circulating strains of the virus among the cattle in Egypt to assess their genetic relatedness and better understand the epidemiological pattern of the disease.","El-Tholoth, Mohamed; Mauk, Michael G.; Elnaker, Yasser F.; Mosad, Samah M.; Tahoun, Amin; El-Sherif, Mohamed W.; Lokman, Maha S.; Kassab, Rami B.; Abdelsadik, Ahmed; Saleh, Ayman A.; Elmahallawy, Ehab Kotb",Animals (Basel),74,28

Platelets play a major role in hemostasis and thrombosis. While platelet activation and aggregation are essential for hemostasis at sites of vascular injury, uncontrolled platelet activation leads to pathological thrombus formation and provokes thrombosis leading to myocardial infarction or stroke. Platelet activation and thrombus formation is a multistage process with different signaling pathways involved to trigger platelet shape change, integrin activation, stable platelet adhesion, aggregation, and degranulation. Apart from thrombotic events, thrombo-inflammation contributes to organ damage and dysfunction in CVDs and is mediated by platelets and inflammatory cells. Therefore, in the past, many efforts have been made to investigate specific signaling pathways in platelets to identify innovative and promising approaches for novel antithrombotic and anti-thrombo-inflammatory strategies that do not interfere with hemostasis. In this review, we focus on some of the most recent data reported on different platelet receptors, including GPIb-vWF interactions, GPVI activation, platelet chemokine receptors, regulation of integrin signaling, and channel homeostasis of NMDAR and PANX1.","Chatterjee, Madhumita; Ehrenberg, Agnes; Toska, Laura Mara; Metz, Lisa Maria; Klier, Meike; Krueger, Irena; Reusswig, Friedrich; Elvers, Margitta",Int J Mol Sci,74,1

Coenzyme A participates in more than 100 different catabolic and anabolic reactions, including those involved in the metabolism of lipids, carbohydrates, proteins, ethanol, bile acids, and xenobiotics. However, much less is known about the importance of the concentration of this cofactor in various cell compartments and the role of altered CoA concentration in various pathologies. Despite continuous research on these issues, the molecular mechanisms in the regulation of the intracellular level of CoA under pathological conditions are still not well understood. This review summarizes the current knowledge of (a) CoA subcellular concentrations; (b) the roles of CoA synthesis and degradation processes; and (c) protein modification by reversible CoA binding to proteins (CoAlation). Particular attention is paid to (a) the roles of changes in the level of CoA under pathological conditions, such as in neurodegenerative diseases, cancer, myopathies, and infectious diseases; and (b) the beneficial effect of CoA and pantethine (which like CoA is finally converted to Pan and cysteamine), used at pharmacological doses for the treatment of hyperlipidemia.","Czumaj, Aleksandra; Szrok-Jurga, Sylwia; Hebanowska, Areta; Turyn, Jacek; Swierczynski, Julian; Sledzinski, Tomasz; Stelmanska, Ewa",Int J Mol Sci,74,8

AI software has been able to beat world champions in chess, Go and recently even Poker. Relevant to our community, it is a prominent source of innovation in healthcare, already helping to develop new drugs, support clinical decisions and provide quality assurance in radiology.

Deep learning, a leading tool of AI, performs particularly well in image pattern recognition and, therefore, can be of great benefit to doctors who rely heavily on images, such as sonologists, radiographers and pathologists. Although obstetric and gynecological ultrasound are two of the most commonly performed imaging studies, AI has had little impact on this field so far. Nevertheless, there is huge potential for AI to assist in repetitive ultrasound tasks, such as automatically identifying good‐quality acquisitions and providing instant quality assurance. For this potential to thrive, interdisciplinary communication between AI developers and ultrasound professionals is necessary. In this article, we explore the fundamentals of medical imaging AI, from theory to applicability, and introduce some key terms to medical professionals in the field of ultrasound.

Transmission Assessment Surveys (TAS) were conducted in 2013 (failed in NWU) and 2017 (all three EUs failed). In 2018, Samoa was the first in the world to distribute nationwide triple-drug MDA using ivermectin, diethylcarbamazine, and albendazole. Surveillance and Monitoring to Eliminate LF and Scabies from Samoa (SaMELFS Samoa) is an operational research program designed to evaluate the effectiveness of triple-drug MDA on LF transmission and scabies prevalence in Samoa, and to compare the usefulness of different indicators of LF transmission. This paper reports results from the 2018 baseline survey and aims to i) investigate antigen (Ag) prevalence and spatial epidemiology, including geographic clustering; ii) compare Ag prevalence between two different age groups (5–9 years versus ≥10 years) as indicators of areas of ongoing transmission; and iii) assess the prevalence of limb lymphedema in those aged ≥15 years. METHODS: A community-based cluster survey was conducted in 30 randomly selected and five purposively selected clusters (primary sampling units, PSUs), each comprising one or two villages. Participants were recruited through household surveys (age ≥5 years) and convenience surveys (age 5–9 years). Alere Filariasis Test Strips (FTS) were used to detect Ag, and prevalence was adjusted for survey design and standardized for age and gender. Adjusted Ag prevalence was estimated for each age group (5–9, ≥10, and all ages ≥5 years) for random and purposive PSUs, and by region. Intraclass correlation (ICC) was used to quantify clustering at regions, PSUs, and households. RESULTS: A total of 3940 persons were included (1942 children aged 5–9 years, 1998 persons aged ≥10 years). Adjusted Ag prevalence in all ages ≥5 years in randomly and purposively selected PSUs were 4.0% (95% CI 2.8–5.6%) and 10.0% (95% CI 7.4–13.4%), respectively. In random PSUs, Ag prevalence was lower in those aged 5–9 years (1.3%, 95% CI 0.8–2.1%) than ≥10 years (4.7%, 95% CI 3.1–7.0%), and poorly correlated at the PSU level (R-square = 0.1459). Adjusted Ag prevalence in PSUs ranged from 0% to 10.3% (95% CI 5.9–17.6%) in randomly selected and 3.8% (95% CI 1.3–10.8%) to 20.0% (95% CI 15.3–25.8%) in purposively selected PSUs. ICC for Ag-positive individuals was higher at households (0.46) compared to PSUs (0.18) and regions (0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Our study confirmed ongoing transmission of LF in Samoa, in accordance with the 2017 TAS results. Ag prevalence varied significantly between PSUs, and there was poor correlation between prevalence in 5–9 year-olds and older ages, who had threefold higher prevalence. Sampling older age groups would provide more accurate estimates of overall prevalence, and be more sensitive for identifying residual hotspots. Higher prevalence in purposively selected PSUs shows local knowledge can help identify at least some hotspots.","Lau, Colleen L.; Meder, Kelley; Mayfield, Helen J.; Kearns, Therese; McPherson, Brady; Naseri, Take; Thomsen, Robert; Hedtke, Shannon M.; Sheridan, Sarah; Gass, Katherine; Graves, Patricia M.",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,74,28

METHODS: We studied high TIL treatments (metabolic suppression, hypothermia (< 35 °C), intensive hyperventilation (PaCO(2) < 4 kPa), and secondary decompressive craniectomy) in patients receiving ICP monitoring in the ICU stratum of the CENTER-TBI study. A random effect logistic regression model was used to determine between-centre variation in their use. A propensity score-matched model was used to study the impact on outcome (6-months Glasgow Outcome Score-extended (GOSE)), whilst adjusting for case-mix severity, signs of brain herniation on imaging, and ICP. RESULTS: 313 of 758 patients from 52 European centres (41%) received at least one high TIL treatment with significant variation between centres (median odds ratio = 2.26). Patients often transiently received high TIL therapies without escalation from lower tier treatments. 38% of patients with high TIL treatment had favourable outcomes (GOSE ≥ 5). The use of high TIL treatment was not significantly associated with worse outcome (285 matched pairs, OR 1.4, 95% CI [1.0–2.0]). However, a sensitivity analysis excluding high TIL treatments at day 1 or use of metabolic suppression at any day did reveal a statistically significant association with worse outcome. CONCLUSION: Substantial between-centre variation in use of high TIL treatments for TBI was found and treatment escalation to higher TIL treatments were often not preceded by more conventional lower TIL treatments. The significant association between high TIL treatments after day 1 and worse outcomes may reflect aggressive use or unmeasured confounders or inappropriate escalation strategies. TAKE HOME MESSAGE: Substantial variation was found in the use of highly intensive ICP-lowering treatments across European ICUs and a stepwise escalation strategy from lower to higher intensity level therapy is often lacking. Further research is necessary to study the impact of high therapy intensity treatments.

They are difficult to diagnose due to their low frequency and their often highly heterogeneous symptoms. Rare diseases have in general a high impact on the quality of life and life expectancy of patients, which are in general children or young people. The advent of high-throughput sequencing techniques has improved diagnosis in several different areas, from pediatrics, achieving a diagnostic rate of 41% with whole genome sequencing (WGS) and 36% with whole exome sequencing, to neurology, achieving a diagnostic rate between 47 and 48.5% with WGS. This evidence has encouraged our group to pursue a molecular diagnosis using WGS for this and several other patients with rare diseases. RESULTS: We used whole genome sequencing to achieve a molecular diagnosis of a 7-year-old girl with a severe panvascular artery disease that remained for several years undiagnosed. We found a frameshift variant in one copy and a large deletion involving two exons in the other copy of a gene called YY1AP1. This gene is related to Grange syndrome, a recessive rare disease, whose symptoms include stenosis or occlusion of multiple arteries, congenital heart defects, brachydactyly, syndactyly, bone fragility, and learning disabilities. Bioinformatic analyses propose these mutations as the most likely cause of the disease, according to its frequency, in silico predictors, conservation analyses, and effect on the protein product. Additionally, we confirmed one mutation in each parent, supporting a compound heterozygous status in the child. CONCLUSIONS: In general, we think that this finding can contribute to the use of whole genome sequencing as a diagnosis tool of rare diseases, and in particular, it can enhance the set of known mutations associated with different diseases.

It is not clear how neighborhood-level linguistic isolation may impact individual health and risk of death among Hispanic older adults. We examined the link between living in a linguistically isolated neighborhood and all-cause mortality among an older Mexican American cohort. Methods: Using a longitudinal sample of older Mexican Americans from the Hispanic Established Populations for the Epidemiologic Studies of the Elderly, we calculated the days from the baseline interview (1993–1994) until observed death through five waves of follow-up (until 2004–2005) using Cox regression. A linguistically isolated neighborhood was defined as a census tract with more than 30% of linguistically isolated households. Results: Our results showed that living in a neighborhood with more than 30% of linguistically isolated households predicted higher mortality (hazard ratio: 1.25; 95% confidence interval: 1.04–1.50), after adjusting for age, sex, nativity, years of education, marital status, self-reported health status, number of chronic conditions, ever smoked, ever drank, and other neighborhood-level contextual factors. Conclusion: Living in a neighborhood with a high proportion of linguistically isolated households predicted higher mortality among older Mexican Americans.

Adaptive testing strategies can increase accuracy of diagnostic screening and symptom severity measurement while decreasing patient and clinician burden. OBJECTIVE: To develop and validate a computerized adaptive diagnostic (CAD) screener and computerized adaptive test (CAT) for PTSD symptom severity. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A diagnostic study of measure development and validation was conducted at a Veterans Health Administration facility. A total of 713 US military veterans were included. The study was conducted from April 25, 2017, to November 10, 2019. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The participants completed a PTSD-symptom questionnaire from the item bank and provided responses on the PTSD Checklist for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) (PCL-5). A subsample of 304 participants were interviewed using the Clinician-Administered Scale for PTSD for DSM-5. RESULTS: Of the 713 participants, 585 were men; mean (SD) age was 52.8 (15.0) years. The CAD-PTSD reproduced the Clinician-Administered Scale for PTSD for DSM-5 PTSD diagnosis with high sensitivity and specificity as evidenced by an area under the curve of 0.91 (95% CI, 0.87-0.95). The CAT-PTSD demonstrated convergent validity with the PCL-5 (r = 0.88) and also tracked PTSD diagnosis (area under the curve = 0.85; 95% CI, 0.79-0.89). The CAT-PTSD reproduced the final 203-item bank score with a correlation of r = 0.95 with a mean of only 10 adaptively administered items, a 95% reduction in patient burden. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Using a maximum of only 6 items, the CAD-PTSD developed in this study was shown to have excellent diagnostic screening accuracy. Similarly, using a mean of 10 items, the CAT-PTSD provided valid severity ratings with excellent convergent validity with an extant scale containing twice the number of items. The 10-item CAT-PTSD also outperformed the 20-item PCL-5 in terms of diagnostic accuracy. The results suggest that scalable, valid, and rapid PTSD diagnostic screening and severity measurement are possible.","Brenner, Lisa A.; Betthauser, Lisa M.; Penzenik, Molly; Germain, Anne; Li, Jin Jun; Chattopadhyay, Ishanu; Frank, Ellen; Kupfer, David J.; Gibbons, Robert D.",JAMA Netw Open,74,1

METHODS: Children aged 7–16 years with physician-confirmed active epilepsy (i.e., having had an epileptic seizure in the past year and or currently taking antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), and not known to have an intellectual disability, were invited to participate. Children had semi-structured interviews separately on two occasions. Between the first and second interviews, an observation of a routine epilepsy clinic appointment of individual children was conducted, and was then discussed during the second interview. Participatory research tools were used in both child interviews to facilitate discussions. Interviews were audio recorded and transcribed, pseudonymized and entered into NVivo (version 12, QSR International). Data were analyzed using a thematic approach. RESULTS: Twenty-three children of mean age 10.1 years (range 8–14), mean duration of epilepsy of 4.6 years (range 2–10) were enrolled. Twelve were 12 female; 7 had focal, 14 had generalized, and 2 had combined epilepsy; 20 were on monotherapy; and 16 had tried previous AEDs. All had an initial (first) interview; 20 were observed during a clinic appointment and had a second interview. Five broad themes emerged: understanding of epilepsy; understanding of seizures; understanding of medication; understanding of children’s role in clinical appointments; influences on children’s understanding. Children spoke about what epilepsy meant by describing the physical sensations of having a seizure or through the act of taking medication. Children described the role they had, or felt they should have, but reported challenges in being meaningfully involved in clinical appointments. While healthcare professionals were initial information nodes, epilepsy information from parents appeared to be more significant for children. CONCLUSIONS: The perspectives of children with epilepsy are valuable for clinicians to understand; assumptions should not be made that children’s views can be accessed via parents. Clinicians need to be constantly aware of children’s views and ways of understanding and communicating about their epilepsy. To support this, the research – drawing on children’s words, meanings, and stories – was used to inform an easily accessible, gender-neutral, animation about epilepsy that provides information about the condition, seizures, and medication (https://youtu.be/MO7xXL2ZXP8).","Harden, Jeni; Black, Rebecca; Pickersgill, Martyn; Shetty, Jay; McLellan, Ailsa; Brand, Celia; Small, Michelle; McDonnell, Jane; Clarke, Lorna; Chin, Richard F.",Epilepsy Behav,74,1

This review summarizes the types of EEG and ERP measures that could be used in the HEALthy Brain and Cognitive Development (HBCD) study, and the promises and challenges in doing so. First, we provide brief overview of the use of EEG/ERP for studying the developing brain and discuss exemplar findings, using resting or baseline EEG measures as well as the ERP mismatch negativity (MMN) as exemplars. We then discuss the promises of EEG/ERP such as feasibility, while balancing challenges such as ensuring good signal quality in diverse children with different hair types. We then describe an ongoing multi-site EEG data harmonization from our groups. We discuss the process of alignment and provide preliminary usability data for both resting state EEG data and auditory ERP MMN in diverse samples including over 300 infants and toddlers. Finally, we provide recommendations and considerations for the HBCD study and other studies of neurodevelopment.","Norton, Elizabeth S.; MacNeill, Leigha A.; Harriott, Emily M.; Allen, Norrina; Krogh-Jespersen, Sheila; Smyser, Christopher D.; Rogers, Cynthia E.; Smyser, Tara A.; Luby, Joan; Wakschlag, Lauren",Dev Cogn Neurosci,74,28

Patients were followed up over a period of 21 months during specialized consultation hours named Immunodermatology, which was established to guarantee comprehensive documentation. The patient’s characteristics regarding age and sex distribution, severity and duration of disease were comparable with the patient collectives in large, pivotal studies. The therapeutic efficiency however was high (percentage of patients with EASI50, -75, -90 after 16 weeks: 94, 84, 60%, respectively) and long lasting (86% EASI90 after 52 weeks on therapy) under everyday conditions in the clinical setting. Approximately half of the patients had facial skin or eye involvement either in their history or at the start of treatment. This group of patients proved to need more and intense care because facial dermatitis and periocular dermatitis, which often involved conjunctivitis, took longer to heal, relapses occurred, and an additional topical treatment was often required. We did not observe any severe side effects during the 48 patient–years analyzed in this study. Dupilumab proved to be a safe and efficient treatment for atopic dermatitis in dermatological practice.","Jahn, Sigbert; Föhr, Julia; Diamanti, Evangelia; Herbst, Matthias",Hautarzt,74,1

Coupling molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) assay offered a simple, rapid, and direct approach in monitoring the protein-protein binding process and predicting the binding affinity. Our case study of designed ankyrin repeats proteins (DARPins)—AnkGAG1D4 and the single point mutated AnkGAG1D4-Y56A for HIV-1 capsid protein (CA) were investigated. As reported, AnkGAG1D4 bound with CA for inhibitory activity; however, it lost its inhibitory strength when tyrosine at residue 56 AnkGAG1D4, the most key residue was replaced by alanine (AnkGAG1D4-Y56A). Through NTA, the binding of DARPins and CA was measured by monitoring the increment of the hydrodynamic radius of the AnkGAG1D4-gold conjugated nanoparticles (AnkGAG1D4-GNP) and AnkGAG1D4-Y56A-GNP upon interaction with CA in buffer solution. The size of the AnkGAG1D4-GNP increased when it interacted with CA but not AnkGAG1D4-Y56A-GNP. In addition, a much higher binding free energy (∆GB) of AnkGAG1D4-Y56A (−31 kcal/mol) obtained from MD further suggested affinity for CA completely reduced compared to AnkGAG1D4 (−60 kcal/mol). The possible mechanism of the protein-protein binding was explored in detail by decomposing the binding free energy for crucial residues identification and hydrogen bond analysis.","Chong, Wei Lim; Chupradit, Koollawat; Chin, Sek Peng; Khoo, Mai Mai; Khor, Sook Mei; Tayapiwatana, Chatchai; Nimmanpipug, Piyarat; Thongkum, Weeraya; Lee, Vannajan Sanghiran",Molecules,74,8

But beyond scientific considerations, the use of genomics in public health research and interventions gives rise to several ethical and social issues of great importance. Considering the impact that PHG could have on the future of public health while still paying attention to the uncertainty surrounding the use of genomic databases for the benefit of populations, this article seeks to explore the promise of genomics in public health and the ethical issues that emerge from its application.","Farmer, Yanick; Godard, Béatrice",Genom Soc Policy,74,1

During the 1970s, several viruses were associated with this syndrome, which are now known to be caused mainly by viruses belonging to four distinct families—rotaviruses, caliciviruses, astroviruses, and adenoviruses. Other viruses, such as the toroviruses, picobirnaviruses, coronavirus, and enterovirus 22, may play a role as well. Transmission by food or water has been documented for astroviruses, caliciviruses, rotaviruses, and norovirus. In developing countries, gastroenteritis is a common cause of death in children <5 years, while deaths from diarrhea are less common, much illness leads to hospitalization or doctor visits. Laboratory confirmation of waterborne illness is based on demonstration of virus particles or antigen in stool, detection of viral nucleic acid in stool, or demonstration of a rise in specific antibody to the virus. Newer methods for syndrome surveillance of acute viral gastroenteritis are being developed like multiplex real-time reverse transcriptase PCRs. Application of these more sensitive methods to detect and characterize individual agents is just beginning, but has already opened up new avenues to reassess their disease burden, examine their molecular epidemiology, and consider new directions for their prevention and control through vaccination, improvements in water quality, and sanitary practices.","Jain, Parul; Jain, Amita",Water and Health,74,28

Although both viruses cause lethal immunogenetic pathology in domestic cats, only FIPV has documented pathogenesis in cheetahs. We summarize and update here a worldwide survey of serum and plasma from cheetah and other nondomestic felids for antibodies to FIV and FIPV, based on Western blot and immunofluorescence assays. FIPV exposure shows an acute pattern with recognizable outbreaks in several zoological facilities, but is virtually nonexistent in sampled free‐ranging populations of cheetahs. FIV is more endemic in certain natural cheetah populations, but infrequent in zoological collections. FIV exposure was also seen in lions, bobcats, leopards, snow leopards, and jaguars. FIV causes T‐cell lymphocyte depletion and associated diseases in domestic cats, but there is little direct evidence for FIV pathology in exotic cats to date. Because of the parallels with a high incidence of simian immunodeficiency virus in free‐ranging African primates without disease, the cat model may also reflect historic infections that have approached an evolutionary balance between the pathogen and immune defenses of their feline host species.

We have investigated long‐term anti‐TNF‐α treatment with infliximab with respect to TNF‐α gene activity and protein levels in the blood of RA patients and disease activity score (DAS). Methods: TNF‐α mRNA and plasma protein in RA patients (n = 29) and healthy controls (n = 24) was determined before and during treatment with infliximab (3 mg/kg) using real‐time quantitative reverse transcription‐polymerase chain reaction (RT‐PCR) and high sensitivity enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), respectively. The disease activity of the patients was assessed as DAS value. Results: The TNF‐α mRNA levels of RA patients at baseline were higher than that of the control group (P = 0.0135) but were significantly reduced after initiation of treatment (P < 0.001). Low mRNA levels were sustained throughout the 54 weeks of the study. Baseline protein levels of RA patients were similar to the control group. After 2 weeks of treatment, the protein levels were significantly elevated from baseline (P = 0.0353) and increased throughout week 14. Clinical improvement for all RA patients was found upon infliximab treatment, as a reduction in DAS values (P < 0.001). The increase in protein and reduction in DAS value from week 2–14 was also correlated (P = 0.0374). Conclusion: During infliximab treatment of RA patients, there is an accumulation in immune‐reactive TNF‐α protein in blood plasma and simultaneously a reduction in TNF‐α gene expression in PBMC, which may in part explain the beneficial course of RA symptoms.","Hjelmevik, T.

We investigated serum mannose‐binding lectin (MBL) levels and polymorphisms in the MBL gene in type 1 diabetic (T1DM) patients with and without diabetic nephropathy and associated macrovascular complications. Polymorphisms in the MBL gene and serum MBL levels were determined in 199 T1DM patients with overt nephropathy and 192 T1DM patients with persistent normoalbuminuria matched for age, sex and duration of diabetes as well as in 100 healthy control subjects. The frequencies of high and low expression MBL genotypes were similar in patients with T1DM and healthy controls. High MBL genotypes were significantly more frequent in diabetic patients with nephropathy than in the normoalbuminuric group, and the risk of having nephropathy, given a high MBL genotype, assessed by odds ratio was 1.52 (1.02–2.27), P = 0.04. Median serum MBL concentrations were significantly higher in patients with nephropathy than in patients with normoalbuminuria [2306 µg/l (IQR 753–4867 µg/l) versus 1491 µg/l (IQR 577–2944), P = 0.0003], and even when comparing patients with identical genotypes, serum MBL levels were higher in the nephropathy group than in the normoalbuminuric group. Patients with a history of cardiovascular disease had significantly elevated MBL levels independently of nephropathy status [3178 µg/l (IQR 636–5231 µg/l) versus 1741 µg/l (IQR 656–3149 µg/l), P = 0.02]. The differences in MBL levels between patients with and without vascular complications were driven primarily by pronounced differences among carriers of high MBL genotypes (P < 0.0001). Our findings suggest that MBL may be involved in the pathogenesis of microvascular and macrovascular complications in type 1 diabetes and that determination of MBL status might be used to identify patients at increased risk of developing these complications.","Hansen, T.

The RBF meshless methods are independent of a dimensionality of the problem solved and they mostly lead to a solution of a linear system of equations. Generally, the approximation is formed using the principle of unity as a sum of weighed RBFs. These two classes of RBFs: global and local, mostly having a shape parameter determining the RBF behavior. In this contribution, we present preliminary results of the estimation of a vector of “optimal” shape parameters, which are different for each RBF used in the final formula for RBF approximation. The preliminary experimental results proved, that there are many local optima and if an iteration process is to be used, no guaranteed global optima are obtained. Therefore, an iterative process, e.g. used in partial differential equation solutions, might find a local optimum, which can be far from the global optima.","Skala, Vaclav; Karim, Samsul Ariffin Abdul; Zabran, Marek",Computational Science - ICCS 2020,74,28

Vascular disrupting agents (VDAs) are tubulin protein binding and depolymerizing agents that induce rapid tumoral vascular shutdown and subsequent cancer necrosis. However, two clinical problems exist with all VDAs, i.e. 1) incomplete anticancer effect and 2) dose-dependent toxicity. To tackle these problems, in our ongoing research, a novel VDA C118P is applied by transarterial administration of half the intravenous dose in rabbits with implanted VX2 liver tumor to assess its therapeutic efficacy. Nearly complete tumor necrosis was achieved by only a single arterial dose of C118P at 5 mg/kg, which was documented in a representative case by in vivo digital subtraction arteriogram (DSA) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and further confirmed by ex vivo microangiogram and histopathology. This convincing and promising preliminary outcome would warrant further comprehensive studies to explore the potentials of VDAs by transarterial administration either in mono-drug or in combination for management of solid cancers.","He, Jintong; Liu, Chong; Li, Tian; Liu, Yewei; Wang, Shuncong; Zhang, Jian; Chen, Lei; Wang, Chao; Feng, Yuanbo; Floris, Giuseppe; Wang, Zhiqiang; Zhang, Xian; Zhao, Liwen; Li, Yue; Shao, Haibo; Ni, Yicheng",Int J Med Sci,74,28

This paper assesses how tariff reforms during the 1998–2018 period affected the Egyptian labour market by focusing on real wages and job stability (i.e. having a permanent position). The empirical analysis is carried out on worker-level data from the available four waves of Egyptian Labour Market Panel Survey (ELMPS), including the recently released 2018 wave. We find that higher tariff protection tends to worsen labour market conditions, both lowering real wages and decreasing the probability of finding a stable job. Furthermore, tariff changes show remarkable asymmetries. There is a negative and significant correlation between tariffs increases and real wages, while the positive impact of tariff reductions turns out to be negligible and insignificant. Our findings support the view that in Egypt protectionism hampered working conditions, contributing to inequality, while liberalizations did not improve nor deteriorate them.","Giovannetti, Giorgia; Marvasi, Enrico; Vivoli, Arianna",Econ Polit,74,1

Starting from the concept of Heritage Community, elaborated in the Council of Europe's Framework Convention on the Value of Cultural Heritage for Society (Framework convention on the value of cultural heritage for society, 2005), along with the hypothesis of its role for Community Resilience, this study elaborates a conceptual framework in which “Heritage Community Resilience” is defined. It is both a target and a process in which cultural heritage supports the building of a community able to prevent, cope with and recover from disturbances and/ or disasters. Through a survey of several case studies on heritage-driven practices in Italian inner peripheral areas, the research aims to define the specific characteristics of Heritage Community Resilience as well as identify any critical actors and variables, strategies and governance mechanisms, which influence both Heritage Community and Community Resilience. It predicts the challenges and highlights the potential that culture and heritage can develop for Community Resilience, towards further perspectives of resilient circular city.","Fabbricatti, Katia; Boissenin, Lucie; Citoni, Michele",City Territ Archit,74,3

The first documented cases of COVID-19 in Queens NYC occurred in early March of 2020. The total number of patients with proven or suspected COVID-19 at Elmhurst Hospital peaked in early April. A dramatic increase in the use of antimicrobials occurred in April, and correlated with the increased number of intubated COVID-19 patients at Elmhurst Hospital. METHODS: Antimicrobial Stewardship Committee activities and meetings had been suspended for the months of March and April due to the increased clinical demands associated with the COVID-19 outbreak. In preparation for the May meeting, a retrospective analysis of antimicrobial use for March and April of 2020 was performed. RESULTS: The analysis revealed a 30% increase in the use of antimicrobials. The average total days of antimicrobials per 1000 patient days (TDA/TPD) was 445 for January through March of 2020. In April, this number climbed to 580. TDA/TPD increased from 57 to 90 (58%) for vancomycin, 25 to 35 (40%) for meropenem, and 31 to 89 (187%) for cefepime. The number of intervention by the Antibiotic Stewardship team remained low during this time period. Total Days of Antimicrobials per 1000 Patient Days (TDA/TPD) [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: A dramatic increase in the use of antimicrobials correlated with an increase in the number of intubated patients at Elmhurst Hospital during a COVID-19 outbreak. It is likely that the frequent appearance of fever and leukocytosis in intubated patients with COVID-19 prompted an increase in empiric antimicrobial use. The 48 hour time outs and prospective review of antimicrobial use may be necessary to maintain stewardship efforts during the COVID-19 epidemic. Further review of antibiotic usage in critically ill COVID-19 patients is needed to help define stewardship practices as we go forward in this pandemic.

MPD is evaluated from two dimensional profiles captured by macrotexture laser-based devices, by means of ISO (International Organization for Standardization) or ASTM (American Society for Testing and Materials International) algorithms. Several macrotexture laser-based measuring devices are present in the world market and, usually each one provides different MPD values also for the same road pavement. Furthermore the Standard Algorithm application produces MPD values affected by a wide variability. For these reasons the comparison of MPD values deriving from different laser-based macrotexture measuring devices is unsatisfying and it can produces deep misunderstanding on road macrotexture characterization. In order to reduce the MPD variability and to improve the MPD values comparison a new algorithm to evaluate a more stable macrotexture synthetic index (Estimated Texture Depth) ETD, has been proposed. It has been developed with more than two hundred profiles belonging to virtual pavements and it has been validated on fifteen real road profiles. The results seems to be promising: the Square Weight Estimated Texture Depth (ETDsw) provides more stable and reliable MPD values and in the same time, it improves the agreement between macrotexture values provided by different laser-based devices.","D’Apuzzo, Mauro; Evangelisti, Azzurra; Santilli, Daniela; Nicolosi, Vittorio",Computational Science and Its Applications - ICCSA 2020,74,7

This essay proposes broadening the perspective both in terms of a history of knowledge and of aesthetics. Its focuses on the much older, yet extremely persistent tradition of understanding the air as an element. From Ancient medicine to the late nineteenth century air – as weather, local climate, or medium of noxious vapors – was a tangible and intensely effective dimension of the environment, affecting bodies, souls, and society. While receding in modern science, this tradition survived in literature which insisted on the connection between the air and human senses, affects, and ways of life. While the emerging atmospheric sciences set about desensitizing the air, literary texts preserved a sensorium of its qualities and efficacy which needs to be deciphered anew. This essay provides an example of such a ›meteorological reading‹ with attention to Thomas Mann’s novella Death in Venice (1912), situating the text at a moment of transition from the old theory of air as an element to a modern understanding of atmosphere and contagion. Read from this perspective, the moods and weather conditions meticulously unfolded in the text come to the fore and prove to both resonate with and set the pace for Aschenbach’s demise.","Horn, Eva",Dtsch Vierteljahresschr Litt Wiss Geistesgesch,74,1

QUESTIONS/PURPOSES We evaluated the diagnostic performance of four common laboratory tests, the synovial white blood cell count, differential, C-reactive protein, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate to detect infection in the first 6 weeks after primary TKA. METHODS We reviewed 11,964 primary TKAs and identified 146 that had a knee aspiration within 6 weeks of surgery. Infection was diagnosed in 19 of the 146 knees by positive cultures or gross purulence. We compared demographic information, time from surgery, and the laboratory test values between infected and noninfected knees to determine if any could identify infection early postoperatively. Receiver operating characteristic curves were constructed to determine optimal cutoff values for each of the test parameters. RESULTS Synovial white blood cell count (92,600 versus 4200 cells/μL), percentage of polymorphonuclear cells (89.6% versus 76.9%), and C-reactive protein (171 versus 88 mg/L) were higher in the infected group. The optimal synovial white blood cell cutoff was 27,800 cells/μL (sensitivity, 84%; specificity, 99%; positive predictive value, 94%; negative predictive value, 98%) for diagnosing infection. The optimal cutoff for the differential was 89% polymorphonuclear cells and for C-reactive protein 95 mg/L. CONCLUSIONS With a cutoff of 27,800 cells/μL, synovial white blood cell count predicted infection within 6 weeks after primary TKA with a positive predicted value of 94% and a negative predictive value of 98%. The use of standard cutoff values for this parameter (~ 3000 cells/μL) would have led to unnecessary reoperations. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE Level II, diagnostic study.

Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been reported to play a part in the course of pulmonary diseases. Here, we studied the role of lncRNA NNT-AS1 in the development of COPD. MATERIALS qRT-PCR analysis and ELISA assay were applied to evaluate the expression of genes and inflammatory cytokines, respectively. CCK8 and EdU assays were utilized to assess proliferation, while flow cytometry assay was conducted to evaluate apoptosis. Luciferase reporter, RNA pull down and RIP assays were combined to explore relationships between genes. RESULTS NNT-AS1 was observed to be up-regulated in cigarette smoke extract (CSE)-treated 16HBE cells. Knockdown of NNT-AS1 abolished CSE-caused suppressive effects on cell proliferation, apoptosis, inflammation and airway remodeling. Mechanistically, NNT-AS1 up-regulated FBXO11 expression via sponging miR-582-5p. Moreover, miR-582-5p inhibitor or FBXO11 overexpression counteracted NNT-AS1 silence-elicited effects on proliferation, apoptosis, inflammation and airway remodeling. CONCLUSION Our data revealed that NNT-AS1 played a promoting role in smoking-induced COPD via modulating miR-582-5p/FBXO11 signaling, suggesting a novel potential target for COPD treatment.","Mei, Jingjing; Zhang, Yuan; Lu, Shuangshuang; Wang, Jing",Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,74,23

MATERIALS AND METHODS The medical records of 31 (20 male, 11 female) cases (with 38 eyes) who underwent secondary IAC and/or IVC between February 2010 and June 2019 were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS Thirteen (41.9%) cases had unilateral and 18 (58.1%) had bilateral RB. According to the International Classification of RB, 6 (15.8%) eyes had group B, 9 (23.7%) eyes had group C, 16 (42.1%) eyes had group D, and 7 (18.4%) eyes had group E RB at diagnosis. All patients underwent six-cycle intravenous chemotherapy as primary treatment and 8 eyes received external radiotherapy before IAC/IVC. Secondary IAC was performed in 21 (55.3%) eyes, IVC in 10 (26.3%) eyes, and IAC + IVC in 7 (18.4%) eyes. External radiotherapy was applied in 2 (5.3%) eyes after IAC/IVC, one of which was later enucleated. In total, 17 (44.7%) eyes undergoing secondary IAC/IVC treatments were enucleated. Metastasis and death were not observed in any case during the mean follow-up period of 59.3 (median 61, range: 10-98) months. DISCUSSION Although 60.5% of the eyes undergoing IAC/IVC consisted of groups D and E RB, globe salvage and survival rates were 55.3% and 100.0%, respectively. External radiotherapy was required in 5.3% of the eyes after IAC/IVC. In conclusion, IAC and IVC are safe and effective treatment methods in eyes with RB unresponsive to other eye-preserving treatments and those demonstrating recurrence.","Mirzayev, Ibadulla; Gündüz, Ahmet Kaan; Yavuz, Kıvılcım; Şekkeli, Mehmet Zahid; Özalp Ateş, Funda Seher; Ünal, Emel; Taçyıldız, Nurdan",European journal of ophthalmology,74,1

On February 23, 2020, the exanthema began in the first confirmed case of measles this year. At the same time, on February 28, 2020, the first case of the new coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was confirmed. Up to June 6, 2020, 176 measles cases have been confirmed: 137 in Mexico City, 37 in the state of Mexico, and two in the state of Campeche. In Mexico City, municipalities with more cases were Gustavo A. Madero, Miguel Hidalgo, and Iztapalapa; in the State of Mexico were Ecatepec, Tlalnepantla, and Netzahualcoyotl; in Campeche, there are only two cases reported. On the other hand, 7,065,133 cases of COVID-19 have been registered worldwide with a global case fatality rate of 5.7%. In Mexico, there have been 113,619 confirmed cases and 13,511 deaths, while in Mexico City, there have been 30,223 cases and 3062 deaths. Iztapalapa and Gustavo A. Madero are the locations with more cases reported. Hence, a campaign of social distancing started as part of the strategies to control the spread of the infection. The potential threat is that as social confinement measures are relaxed and mobility is initiated, both viruses could continue to spread. It is expected that due to the time that has passed since the last reported measles case, control of this disease will be achieved.","Solórzano-Santos, Fortino; Garduño-Espinoza, Juan; Muñoz-Hernández, Onofre",Boletin medico del Hospital Infantil de Mexico,74,19

It is a cross-sectional study carried out with Brazilian older adults who responded to an online health survey (N = 9,173), using a ""virtual snowball"" sampling method. Data were collected online via a self-administered questionnaire. Prevalence and confidence interval estimates were performed and verified for independence using Pearson's chi-square test. During the pandemic there was a fall in household income among almost half of older adults. Extreme social distancing was practiced by 30.9% (95%CI: 27.8; 34.1) and 12.2% (95%CI: 10.1; 14.7) did not adhere to it. Older adults who were not working before the pandemic adhered in greater numbers to extreme social distancing measures. Most of them presented comorbidities associated with a higher risk of developing the severe form of COVID-19. Feelings of loneliness, distress and sadness were frequent among older adults, especially women. The COVID-19 pandemic widened the inequality gap by affecting the most vulnerable older people. Strategies to mitigate loneliness and social distancing should consider social vulnerability and the marked difference between men and women in terms of household composition and socioeconomic and working conditions. The development of representative surveys of Brazilian older adults is recommended, investigating the impact of the pandemic on this population.","Romero, Dalia Elena; Muzy, Jéssica; Damacena, Giseli Nogueira; Souza, Nathalia Andrade de; Almeida, Wanessa da Silva de; Szwarcwald, Celia Landmann; Malta, Deborah Carvalho; Barros, Marilisa Berti de Azevedo; Souza Júnior, Paulo Roberto Borges de; Azevedo, Luiz Otávio; Gracie, Renata; Pina, Maria de Fátima de; Lima, Margareth Guimarães; Machado, Ísis Eloah; Gomes, Crizian Saar; Werneck, André Oliveira; Silva, Danilo Rodrigues Pereira da",Cadernos de saude publica,74,16

METHODS A prospective, single-arm study with an open enrollment of subjects requiring stapling of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract was performed. The study endpoints were the number of complications and technical failures associated with the use of a novel stapler when compared to similar events with conventional staplers as described in the medical literature. RESULTS Seven centers enrolled 160 subjects, 150 of which were followed up to at least 30 days postoperatively. Intraoperative success: In 423 deployments, there were two staple line leaks and five staple line bleeds, all of which were intraoperatively resolved. In addition, incomplete staple lines were noted as a result of user error (n = 15) or device-related issues (n = 22), all of which were immediately resolved and none of which resulted in a complication or a change of the surgical procedure. Late outcomes: A total of 13 surgical complications in 160 patients were related to a GI transection or anastomosis, 12 of which related to a hand-sewn anastomosis or use of other commercially available staplers. One event (1/153, 0.065 %) on POD 1, involving bleeding of the staple line, was felt to be related to the use of the new stapler. CONCLUSION The study confirmed that the new device was user-friendly (9 % incidence of problems firing the device), reliable (3 % device failures) and safe (<1 % complication rate related to the stapler). Based on these results, it would seem that this new 5-mm stapler is a safe and effective alternative to standard 12-mm staplers.","Kuthe, Andreas; Haemmerle, Alexander; Ludwig, Kaja; Falck, Stephan; Hiller, Wolfgang; Mainik, Frederick; Freys, Stephan; Dubovoy, Lev; Jaehne, Joachim; Oldhafer, Karl",Surgical endoscopy,74,31

However, predictive biomarkers of pathogenic inflammation to help guide targetable immune pathways are critically lacking. We implemented a rapid multiplex cytokine assay to measure serum interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and IL-1β in hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) upon admission to the Mount Sinai Health System in New York. Patients (n = 1,484) were followed up to 41 d after admission (median, 8 d), and clinical information, laboratory test results and patient outcomes were collected. We found that high serum IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-α levels at the time of hospitalization were strong and independent predictors of patient survival (P < 0.0001, P = 0.0205 and P = 0.0140, respectively). Notably, when adjusting for disease severity, common laboratory inflammation markers, hypoxia and other vitals, demographics, and a range of comorbidities, IL-6 and TNF-α serum levels remained independent and significant predictors of disease severity and death. These findings were validated in a second cohort of patients (n = 231). We propose that serum IL-6 and TNF-α levels should be considered in the management and treatment of patients with COVID-19 to stratify prospective clinical trials, guide resource allocation and inform therapeutic options.","Del Valle, Diane Marie; Kim-Schulze, Seunghee; Huang, Hsin-Hui; Beckmann, Noam D; Nirenberg, Sharon; Wang, Bo; Lavin, Yonit; Swartz, Talia H; Madduri, Deepu; Stock, Aryeh; Marron, Thomas U; Xie, Hui; Patel, Manishkumar; Tuballes, Kevin; Van Oekelen, Oliver; Rahman, Adeeb; Kovatch, Patricia; Aberg, Judith A; Schadt, Eric; Jagannath, Sundar; Mazumdar, Madhu; Charney, Alexander W; Firpo-Betancourt, Adolfo; Mendu, Damodara Rao; Jhang, Jeffrey; Reich, David; Sigel, Keith; Cordon-Cardo, Carlos; Feldmann, Marc; Parekh, Samir; Merad, Miriam; Gnjatic, Sacha",Nature medicine,74,1

RESULTS Hong Kong, Malaysia and Singapore are ethnically, religiously, socially and politically very different. In spite of considerable wealth and a growing recognition that mental health problems in the young are increasing, they face similar problems--lack of access to treatment due to a dearth of services and a lack of child psychiatrists (2.5, 0.5 and 2.8 per million people, respectively).

We estimated a segmented linear regression to evaluate the effectiveness of lockdown measures on COVID-19 incidence and mortality. The initial number of new cases and new deaths had a positive trend prior to policy change. After lockdown, a statistically significant decrease in new confirmed cases was found in all state capitals. We also found evidence that lockdown measures were likely to reverse the trend of new daily deaths due to COVID-19. In São Luís, we observed a reduction of 37.85% while in Fortaleza the decrease was 33.4% on the average difference in daily deaths if the lockdown had not been implemented.

We report a case of latent disseminated TB in a young immunocompetent female that was revealed in the postpartum state (after full-term stillbirth delivery at home) as 20 ileal perforations secondary to intestinal TB. Due to ongoing sepsis and delayed presentation to the hospital, the patient could not be salvaged despite the best possible efforts.","Rajput, Deepak; Gupta, Amit; Roshan, Ravi; Kumar, Arvind",BMJ case reports,74,30

This is questioned since outcome trials of these drug classes had metformin as background therapy. In this post hoc analysis, the effect of dulaglutide on CV events was investigated according to the baseline metformin therapy by means of a subgroup analysis of the Researching Cardiovascular Events with a Weekly Incretin in Diabetes (REWIND) trial. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Patients in REWIND (n = 9901; women: 46.3%; mean age: 66.2 years) had type 2 diabetes and either a previous CV event (31%) or high CV risk (69%). They were randomized (1:1) to sc. dulaglutide (1.5 mg/weekly) or placebo in addition to standard of care. The primary outcome was the first of a composite of nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, and death from cardiovascular or unknown causes. Key secondary outcomes included a microvascular composite endpoint, all-cause death, and heart failure. The effect of dulaglutide in patients with and without baseline metformin was evaluated by a Cox regression hazard model with baseline metformin, dulaglutide assignment, and their interaction as independent variables. Adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated by a Cox regression model with adjustments for factors differing at baseline between people with vs. without metformin, identified using the backward selection. RESULTS Compared to patients with metformin at baseline (n = 8037; 81%), those without metformin (n = 1864; 19%) were older and slightly less obese and had higher proportions of women, prior CV events, heart failure, and renal disease. The primary outcome occurred in 976 (12%) participants with baseline metformin and in 281 (15%) without. There was no significant difference in the effect of dulaglutide on the primary outcome in patients with vs. without metformin at baseline [HR 0.92 (CI 0.81-1.05) vs. 0.78 (CI 0.61-0.99); interaction P = 0.18]. Findings for key secondary outcomes were similar in patients with and without baseline metformin. CONCLUSION This analysis suggests that the cardioprotective effect of dulaglutide is unaffected by the baseline use of metformin therapy.","Ferrannini, Giulia; Gerstein, Hertzel; Colhoun, Helen Martina; Dagenais, Gilles R; Diaz, Rafael; Dyal, Leanne; Lakshmanan, Mark; Mellbin, Linda; Probstfield, Jeffrey; Riddle, Matthew Casey; Shaw, Jonathan Edward; Avezum, Alvaro; Basile, Jan Neil; Cushman, William C; Jansky, Petr; Keltai, Mátyás; Lanas, Fernando; Leiter, Lawrence Alan; Lopez-Jaramillo, Patricio; Pais, Prem; Pīrāgs, Valdis; Pogosova, Nana; Raubenheimer, Peter Johann; Sheu, Wayne Huey-Herng; Rydén, Lars",European heart journal,74,26

To explain this discrepancy, we hypothesised that colonic adaptation to increased wheat fibre intake takes many months but eventually results in increased SCFA production and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) secretion. Thus, the primary objective was to determine the time-course of the effects of increased wheat fibre intake on plasma acetate, butyrate and GLP-1 concentrations in hyperinsulinaemic human subjects over 1 year. Subjects with fasting plasma insulin >or= 40 pmol/l were randomly assigned by computer to receive either a high-wheat fibre cereal (fibre group; 24 g fibre/d; twenty assigned; six dropped out, fourteen included) or a low-fibre cereal (control group; twenty assigned; six dropped-out, fourteen included) daily for 1 year. Acetate, butyrate and GLP-1 were measured during 8 h metabolic profiles performed every 3 months. There were no differences in body weight in the fibre group compared with the control group. After 9 months baseline-adjusted mean 8 h acetate and butyrate concentrations were higher on the high-fibre than the control cereal (P < 0.05). After 12 months on the high-fibre cereal, baseline-adjusted mean plasma GLP-1 was 1.3 (95 % CI 0.4, 2.2) pmol/l (P < 0.05) higher than at baseline (about 25 % increase) and 1.4 (95 % CI 0.1, 2.7) pmol/l (P < 0.05) higher than after 12 months on control. It is concluded that wheat fibre increased SCFA production and GLP-1 secretion in hyperinsulinaemic humans, but these effects took 9-12 months to develop. Since GLP-1 may increase insulin sensitivity and secretion, these results may provide a mechanism for the epidemiological association between high cereal fibre intake and reduced risk for diabetes.","Freeland, Kristin R; Wilson, Charlotte; Wolever, Thomas M S",The British journal of nutrition,74,23

First reported in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, it has now spread to all continents of the world becoming a pandemic. There is no known treatment or vaccine for it although many candidate drugs and vaccines are in various clinical trial phases. For now, non-pharmacological interventions (NPIs) have become the mainstay of response for COVID-19 and are being used across the world to flatten the epidemiologic curve with some success. This review focussed on identifying which NPIs have been effective. NPIs that are effective include isolation and quarantine, physical distancing, use of face masks and hand hygiene. These measures are best used in combination and simultaneously. The evidence is that they should be instituted early in the pandemic and for sustained periods. They should also be implemented in the context of the cultural and socioeconomic conditions of the populace. Ineffective NPIs include ultraviolet irradiation and spraying of outdoor spaces and individuals.

BACKGROUND Understanding an operator's cognitive workload is an important component in assessing human-machine interaction. However, little evidence is available on the effect that cognitive overload has on task performance and muscle activity when completing manufacturing tasks. METHOD Twenty-two volunteers completed an assembly task while performing a secondary cognitive task with increasing levels of demand (n-back). Performance in the assembly task (completion times, accuracy), muscle activity recorded as integrated electromyography (EMG), and self-reported workload were measured. RESULTS Results show that the increasing cognitive demand imposed by the n-back task resulted in impaired assembly task performance, overall greater muscle activity, and higher self-reported workload. Relative to the control condition, performing the 2-back task resulted in longer assembly task completion times (+10 s on average) and greater integrated EMG for flexor carpi ulnaris, triceps brachii, biceps brachii, anterior deltoid, and pectoralis major. CONCLUSION This study demonstrates that working under high cognitive load not only results in greater muscle activity, but also affects assembly task completion times, which may have a direct effect on manufacturing cycle times. APPLICATION Results are applicable to the assessment of the effects of high cognitive workload in manufacturing.","Biondi, Francesco N; Cacanindin, Angela; Douglas, Caitlyn; Cort, Joel",Human factors,74,27

Some UK sexual health clinics follow a test and wait process for chlamydia contacts presenting after 14 days of exposure. The aim of this retrospective service evaluation was to determine the potential impact of implementing such a process for chlamydia contacts at our clinic. We reviewed the patient records of 548 chlamydia contacts over a 1-year period, and 588 patients with chlamydia over a 5-month period. Demographic and clinical characteristics data were collected.Chlamydia prevalence was 46% (254/548) in contacts, with prevalence varying by age (p=.008) and sexual risk (p=.04), but not by time since exposure (p=.29). For patients with chlamydia, there was a mean of 1.9 days between results notification and attending for treatment; a mean of 2.2 attempts were required to contact patients to return for treatment. Chlamydia prevalence in contacts is high. Not giving empirical treatment to contacts presenting after 14 days of exposure would result in 13.1% of the cohort needing to return for treatment. Patients found to have chlamydia returned promptly once informed of positive results.","Frackelton, Rachel; Jones, Kathy; Hamer, Beth; Jones, Sian; Hitchings, Elizabeth; Harrison, Joanne; Hughes-McGreal, Catherine; Clarke, Emily",International journal of STD & AIDS,74,19

However, previous studies have shown that the BAI has limited accuracy for children and adolescents. OBJECTIVE We propose to develop and validate an adjusted BAI for use in male children and adolescents from 7 to 17 years of age. METHODS The sample consisted of 141 physically active male children and adolescents (age: 12.5 ± 2.14). The %F was determined by X-ray dual energy absorptometry equipment (DXA) as the standard method and by BAI, using an equation that uses height and hip circumference. Arithmetic modeling was used to adjust the structure of the BAI mathematical model. RESULTS The BAI arithmetic adjustment was successful, resulting in the mathematical model named in the present study of adjusted body adiposity index (BAIADJ ). BAI and BAIADJ correlated with DXA (r ≤ .70, p < .001). Regression analyzes indicate that, BAI (CI 95% β: [1.35; 1.90], p < .0001) and BAIADJ (CI 95% β: [1.40; 1.90], p < .0001) have the potential to estimate %F. BAI pointed out a difference in relation to DXA (p = .04). While there was no difference between BAIADJ and DXA (p = .1). There was a proportion bias of 13.2% for BAI (p < .05), but not for BAIADJ (p > .05). CONCLUSION The adjusted model of the body adiposity index proves to be an effective tool for the analysis of the fat percentage in young males. In addition, it demonstrated significant degrees of agreement and validity in relation to DXA.","de Macêdo Cesário, Tatianny; de Almeida-Neto, Paulo Francisco; de Matos, Dihogo Gama; Wells, Jonathan; Aidar, Felipe J; da Costa, Roberto Fernandes; de Araújo Tinoco Cabral, Breno Guilherme",American journal of human biology : the official journal of the Human Biology Council,74,16

Materials and methods We described some critical changes in our routine to minimize the COVID infection among patients and healthcare workers. From March 1st to May 25th, 2020, we described our actions and surgical outcomes of patients treated in our center during the pandemic. Results Preventing hospital visits, we implemented some modifications in our office routine in terms of patient appointment, follow up, and management of non-surgical candidates. In this period, 147 patients underwent robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) without intraoperative complications. The median operative time and blood loss were 91 minutes (IQR= 25) and 50 ml (IQR= 50), respectively. The median hospitalization time was 15.8 hours (IQR= 2.5). None of the patients of our study had COVID in the postoperative follow-up, and only two patients were rescheduled due to a positive rapid COVID test one day before surgery. The final pathology described 10 patients (6.8%) Grade Group (GrGp) 1, 34 (23.1%) GrGp 2, 31(21%) GrGp 3, 16(10.8%) GrGp 4, 37 (25.3%) GrGp 5, and 19 (13%) with deferred Gleason. Two patients, COVID negative, were readmitted due to infected lymphocele managed with antibiotic and Interventional Radiology drainage. Conclusion Our experience managing patients with prostate cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic showed that changing the office routine, stratifying the patients according to the NCCN risk, and adopting COVID-based criteria to select patients for surgery are necessary actions to maintain the best quality of treatment and minimize the viral infection among our oncological patients. In our routine, the RARP during the COVID pandemic is safe and feasible for patients and healthcare workers if the necessary precautions described in this article are taken.","Covas Moschovas, Marcio; Bhat, Seetharam; Rogers, Travis Phillip; Onol, Fikret Fatih; Roof, Shannon; Sighinolfi, Maria Chiara; Rocco, Bernardo; Patel, Vipul",Journal of endourology,74,17

Artificial light at night (ALAN) is one form of anthropogenic change that spans beyond urban boundaries and may be relevant to EIDs through its influence on the behaviour and physiology of hosts and/or vectors. Although West Nile virus (WNV) emergence has been described as peri-urban, we hypothesized that exposure risk could also be influenced by ALAN in particular, which is testable by comparing the effects of ALAN on prevalence while controlling for other aspects of urbanization. By modelling WNV exposure among sentinel chickens in Florida, we found strong support for a nonlinear relationship between ALAN and WNV exposure risk in chickens with peak WNV risk occurring at low ALAN levels. Although our goal was not to discern how ALAN affected WNV relative to other factors, effects of ALAN on WNV exposure were stronger than other known drivers of risk (i.e. impervious surface, human population density). Ambient temperature in the month prior to sampling, but no other considered variables, strongly influenced WNV risk. These results indicate that ALAN may contribute to spatio-temporal changes in WNV risk, justifying future investigations of ALAN on other vector-borne parasites.","Kernbach, Meredith E; Martin, Lynn B; Unnasch, Thomas R; Hall, Richard J; Jiang, Rays H Y; Francis, Clinton D",Proceedings.

Our systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to synthesize the evidence regarding the association between gestational weight gain and offspring's cognitive skills. METHODS In this systematic review and meta-analysis (PROSPERO number, CRD42017073266), we systematically searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science and the Cochrane Library for studies examining association between gestational weight gain and offspring's cognitive skills, without restriction in study design or language. Two reviewers extracted in an independent way the data. The Quality of Reporting of Observational Longitudinal Research scale was used to assess the quality of included studies. Effect size (ES) for adjusted models and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals were calculated for (i) intelligence quotient, (ii) language related skills and (iii) mathematic related skills comparing offspring's cognitive skills when gestational weight gain was within recommendations (as reference) with those from mothers whose gestational weight gain was above or below the recommendations. RESULTS Thirteen studies were included. There was a positive trend that associated gestational weight gain above recommendations with better offspring's intelligence quotient, although not statistically significant (ES 0.02, 95% CI -0.00, 0.05; I2 = 0.00%). CONCLUSIONS There is a not significant positive association between gestational weight gain above recommendations and intelligence quotient and some studies reported associations between gestational weight gain and offspring's cognitive skills.

This has prompted governing bodies to adopt a cautious approach that may be impractical and financially unsustainable. The lack of evidence has made it impossible for surgeons to give patients an informed perspective of the consequences of elective surgery in the presence of SARS-CoV-2. This study aims to determine, for the UK population, the probability of a patient being admitted with an undetected SARS-CoV-2 infection and their resulting risk of death; taking into consideration the current disease prevalence, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing, and preassessment pathway. METHODS The probability of SARS-CoV-2 infection with a false negative test was calculated using a lower-end RT-PCR sensitivity of 71%, specificity of 95%, and the UK disease prevalence of 0.24% reported in May 2020. Subsequently, a case fatality rate of 20.5% was applied as a worst-case scenario. RESULTS The probability of SARS-CoV-2 infection with a false negative preoperative test was 0.07% (around 1 in 1,400). The risk of a patient with an undetected infection being admitted for surgery and subsequently dying from the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is estimated at approximately 1 in 7,000. However, if an estimate of the current global infection fatality rate (1.04%) is applied, the risk of death would be around 1 in 140,000, at most. This calculation does not take into account the risk of nosocomial infection. Conversely, it does not factor in that patients will also be clinically assessed and asked to self-isolate prior to surgery. CONCLUSION Our estimation suggests that the risk of patients being inadvertently admitted with an undetected SARS-CoV-2 infection for elective orthopaedic surgery is relatively low. Accordingly, the risk of death following elective orthopaedic surgery is low, even when applying the worst-case fatality rate.

Whether they originated in Han or Daic people, there is no consensus. Three hypotheses have been proposed to explain the origin of this group: (1) the Han Chinese origin, (2) the ancient Daic origin, (3) and the admixture between Daic and Han. This study addressed this issue by analyzing the paternal Y chromosome and maternal mtDNA variation of 62 Fujian Tanka and 25 neighboring Han in Fujian. The southern East Asian predominant haplogroups (e.g., Y-chromosome O1a1a-P203 and O1b1a1a-M95, and mtDNA F2a, M7c1, and F1a1) had relatively high frequencies in Tanka. The interpopulation comparison revealed that the Tanka have a closer affinity with Daic populations than with Han Chinese in paternal lineages but are closely clustered with southern Han populations such as Hakka and Chaoshanese in maternal lineages. Network and haplotype-sharing analyses also support the admixture hypothesis. The Fujian Tanka mainly originate from the ancient indigenous Daic people and have only limited gene flows from Han Chinese populations. Notably, the divergence time inferred by the Tanka-specific haplotypes indicates that the formation of Fujian Tanka was a least 1033.8-1050.6 years before present (the early Northern Song dynasty), indicating that they are an indigenous population, not late Daic migrants from southwestern China.","Luo, Xiao-Qin; Du, Pan-Xin; Wang, Ling-Xiang; Zhou, Bo-Yan; Li, Yu-Chun; Zheng, Hong-Xiang; Wei, Lan-Hai; Liu, Jun-Jian; Sun, Chang; Meng, Hai-Liang; Tan, Jing-Ze; Su, Wen-Jing; Wen, Shao-Qing; Li, Hui",Human biology,74,31

To investigate this, a first screening was performed of sera from patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) or acute ischemic stroke (AIS) for serological identification of antigens using recombinant cDNA expression cloning (SEREX). The amplified luminescent proximity homogeneous assay-linked immunosorbent assay (AlphaLISA) method, which incorporates glutathione-donor beads and anti-human-IgG-acceptor beads, was used to evaluate serum antibody levels. SEREX screening identified low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-associated protein 1 (LRPAP1) as a target antigen of serum IgG antibodies in the sera of patients with ESCC or AIS. Antigens, including recombinant glutathione S-transferase (GST)-fused LRPAP1 protein, were prepared to examine serum antibody levels. AlphaLISA revealed significantly higher antibody levels against the LRPAP1 protein in patients with solid cancers such as ESCC and colorectal carcinoma and some atherosclerosis-related diseases such as AIS and diabetes mellitus compared with healthy donors. Correlation analysis revealed that the elevated serum antibody levels against LRPAP1 were associated with smoking, a well-known risk factor for both cancer and atherosclerosis.

This study aims to uncover the lack of understanding regarding rupture-prone characteristics, such as morphology and hemodynamic factors, associated with different intracranial aneurysm location. MATERIALS AND METHODS We investigated the characteristics of 311 unruptured aneurysms at our center. Based on the PHASES study, we separated and compared morphologic and hemodynamic characteristics among 3 aneurysm location groups: 1) internal carotid artery; 2) middle cerebral artery; and 3) anterior communicating, posterior communicating, and posterior circulation arteries. RESULTS A mixed model statistical analysis showed that size ratio, low wall shear stress area, and pressure loss coefficient were different between the intracranial aneurysm location groups. In addition, a pair-wise comparison showed that ICA aneurysms had lower size ratios, lower wall shear stress areas, and lower pressure loss coefficients compared with MCA aneurysms and compared with the group of anterior communicating, posterior communicating, and posterior circulation aneurysms. There were no statistical differences between MCA aneurysms and the group of anterior communicating, posterior communicating, and posterior circulation aneurysms for morphologic or hemodynamic characteristics. CONCLUSIONS ICA aneurysms may be subjected to less rupture-prone morphologic and hemodynamic characteristics compared with other locations, which could explain the decreased rupture propensity of intracranial aneurysms at this location.","Varble, N; Rajabzadeh-Oghaz, H; Wang, J; Siddiqui, A; Meng, H; Mowla, A",AJNR.

Methods: A survey was offered on the crowdsourcing platform, Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) during April 2020 (the early days of strict, social distancing restrictions). The study included 1,521 adults ages 18 years and older who resided in the US and were enrolled as MTurk workers, i.e., workers who are qualified by Amazon to complete a range of human interaction tasks, including surveys through the MTurk worker platform. Main predictors included measures of heavy drinking, marijuana, and polysubstance use. The dependent measures were measures of social distancing and personal hygiene, based on guidelines recommended at the time of the survey by the US Centers for Disease Control to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Results: We found consistent negative associations between heavy drinking and drug use and adherence to social distancing and personal hygiene. Additionally, three control variables, age, gender, and race/ethnicity, were significant correlates of adherence to these measures. Conclusions: The findings here are consistent with previous research exploring links between substance use and other adverse health behaviors. Further, the negative association between heavy drinking (five or more drinks in one sitting) and adherence underscore the public health risks entailed with the unrestricted reopening of public drinking establishments.","Fendrich, Michael; Becker, Jessica; Park, Crystal; Russell, Beth; Finkelstein-Fox, Lucy; Hutchison, Morica",Substance abuse,74,30

In this study, we aimed to compare the outcome in terms of adverse events and recurrence rate, of patients included in the multicenter LigaLongo RCT ( ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01240772) according to the type of devices used. METHODS In the DGHAL arm (N = 193), the procedure was done with transanal hemorrhoidal dearterialization (THD)™ (THD, Correggio, Italy) (104 patients) and with HAL-RAR™ (Agency for Medical Innovations (AMI) GmbH, Feldkirch, Austria) (89 patients). In the CSH arm (N = 184), procedure for prolapse and hemorrhoids (PPH)-03™ (Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Cincinnati OH) and hemorrhoidopexy and prolapse (HEM)™ (Covidien, Inc.) staplers were used in respectively 106 and 78 cases. Surgery-related morbidity at 90 postoperative days (POD) based on the Clavien-Dindo procedure-related complication score and clinical outcome in terms of recurrence and reoperation rate at 12 postoperative months (POM) was collected. RESULTS Three hundred and seventy-seven patients were randomized according to HD grade. In the DGHAL arm, the number of ligations and mucopexies was higher in the AMI group (p < 0.0001); at 90 POD, the overall morbidity was similar between the two groups. In the CSH arm, donut sizes were similar; at 90 POD, the PPH group had a higher risk of postoperative grade 1 morbidity (anal urgency or incontinence) compared to the HEM group (p = 0.003). At 12 POM, no statistical difference was found between the two groups of each arm in terms of grade III recurrence or reoperation. CONCLUSION Postoperative morbidity and outcome at 1 year were similar regardless of the type of devices used. These findings suggest that device type has little impact on HD treatment results.

In the present review, we discuss VALI in relation to assisted MV strategies, such as volume assist-control ventilation, pressure assist-control ventilation, pressure support ventilation (PSV), airway pressure release ventilation (APRV), APRV with PSV, proportional assist ventilation (PAV), noisy ventilation, and neurally adjusted ventilatory assistance (NAVA). In summary, we suggest that assisted MV can be used in ARDS patients in the following situations: (1) Pao(2)/Fio(2) >150 mm Hg and positive end-expiratory pressure ≥ 5 cm H(2)O and (2) with modalities of pressure-targeted and time-cycled breaths including more or less spontaneous or supported breaths (A-PCV [assisted pressure-controlled ventilation] or APRV). Furthermore, during assisted MV, the following parameters should be monitored: inspiratory drive, transpulmonary pressure, and tidal volume (6 mL/kg). Further studies are required to determine the impact of novel modalities of assisted ventilation such as PAV, noisy pressure support, and NAVA on VALI.","Saddy, Felipe; Sutherasan, Yuda; Rocco, Patricia R M; Pelosi, Paolo",Seminars in respiratory and critical care medicine,74,1

Like Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a respiratory virus infecting the lungs with fever, dry cough and acute pneumonia being the major symptoms. It infects the epithelial cells expressing Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, which is crucial for the viral entry. Based on evolving clinical evidence, it is now unfitting to label SARS-CoV-2 as just a respiratory virus, as lately there are various reports that substantiate its pathogenicity in other organs of the body, including brain. In this review, we discuss the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 in comparison to SARS and MERS along with possibilities of viral entry into central nervous system (CNS) tissues. The review provides detailed information about the virulence, epidemiology and insights into molecular pathways involved in the infectivity of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, along with in-depth view of current concepts about the neurological significance of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and its neuropathological competence.

In addition, the recombinant receptor-binding domain (RBD) was used to raise polyclonal antibodies in mice. All of the antibodies raised by S-peptide immunisation were specific and sensitive for S protein expressed in transfected cells in the indirect immunofluorescence assay or Western blotting. The RBD efficiently elicited neutralizing antibodies against MERS-CoV by blocking viral entry at the binding step. Furthermore, we found that the SP3 peptide, corresponding to amino-acid residues 736-761 of the S protein, elicited robust neutralizing activities by blocking viral entry at the postbinding and membrane fusion steps. We conclude that amino-acid residues 736-761 of the S protein carry neutralizing epitopes that may be used in the development of vaccines and antiviral agents against MERS-CoV.","Yang, Yang; Deng, Yao; Wen, Bo; Wang, Huijuan; Meng, Xin; Lan, Jiaming; Gao, George F; Tan, Wenjie",Viral immunology,74,28

METHODS The 7.5 mm internal diameter (ID) tracheal tube cuffs-Tapered Seal Guard (TSG), Standard Seal Guard (SSG), Hi-Lo, Microcuff, Ruesch, and Portex Profile-were compared in an in vitro apparatus. Vertical artificial tracheas with 16, 20, and 22 mm ID were intubated, 5 ml clear water was applied above the unlubricated tube cuffs, and fluid leakage was measured up to 60 min. Data of tapered vs non-tapered tube cuffs (16 observations) were compared for each tracheal diameter using the Mann-Whitney test. RESULTS Median (range) fluid leakage (ml) at 60 min was 2.14 (0.05-4.88), 1.14 (0.00-4.84), and 0.13 (0.00-1.32), respectively, for 16, 20, and 22 mm tracheas in the TSG tube studies when compared with 4.58 (0.44-4.88), 2.21 (0.00-4.81), and 0.00 (0.00-4.81) in the SSG tube and 4.54 (1.54-4.82), 0.90 (0.00-4.49), and 4.85 (4.40-4.99) in the Microcuff tube studies. Leakage in all polyvinylchloride (PVC) tube cuffs was almost complete (5 ml) within 5 min (P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS The tapered PU tube cuff was as effective as the cylindrical PU cuffs in smaller tracheal diameters and was more efficient than the cylindrical Microcuff PU tube cuff in larger tracheal diameter in preventing subglottic fluid leakage across the tube cuff tested in this in vitro study. PVC tube cuffs leaked much more and faster than PU cuffs.","Dave, M H; Frotzler, A; Spielmann, N; Madjdpour, C; Weiss, M",British journal of anaesthesia,74,17

Accurate control of PRMT activity includes recognition of specific arginyl groups within targeted proteins and the generation of the correct level of methylation, none of which are fully understood. The predominant PRMT in vivo, PRMT1, has wide substrate specificity and is capable of both mono- and dimethylation, which can induce distinct biological outputs. What regulates the specific methylation pattern of PRMT1 in vivo is unclear. We report that PRMT1 methylates a multisite peptide substrate in a nonstochastic manner, with less C-terminal preference, consistent with the methylation patterns observed in vivo. With a single targeted arginine, PRMT1 catalyzed the dimethylation in a semiprocessive manner. The degree of processivity is regulated by substrate sequences. Our results identify a novel substrate-induced mechanism for modulating PRMT1 product specificity. Considering the numerous physiological PRMT1 substrates, as well as the distinct biological outputs of mono- and dimethylation products, such fine-tuned regulation would significantly contribute to the accurate product specificity of PRMT1 in vivo and the proper transmission of biochemical information.","Gui, Shanying; Wooderchak-Donahue, Whitney L; Zang, Tianzhu; Chen, Dong; Daly, Michael P; Zhou, Zhaohui Sunny; Hevel, Joan M",Biochemistry,74,1

Previous studies have shown that knocking out FXR improved cardiac function by reducing cardiomyocyte apoptosis in myocardial ischemic mice. However, the role of FXR after cerebral ischemia remains unknown. In this study, we explored the effects and mechanisms of FXR knockout (KO) on the functional recovery of mice post cerebral ischemia-reperfusion. METHODS Adult male C57BL/6 wild type and FXR KO mice were subjected to 90-min transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO). The mice were divided into five groups: sham, wild-type tMCAO, FXR KO tMCAO, wild-type tMCAO treated with calcium agonist Bayk8644, and FXR KO tMCAO treated with Bayk8644. FXR expression was examined using immunohistochemistry and Western blot. Brain infarct and brain atrophy volume were examined at 3 and 14 days after stroke respectively. Neurobehavioral tests were conducted up to 14 days after stroke. The protein levels of apoptotic factors (Bcl-2, Bax, and Cleaved caspase-3) and mRNA levels of pro-inflammatory factors (TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, IL-17, and IL-18) were examined using Western blot and RT-PCR. TUNEL staining and calcium imaging were obtained using confocal and two-photon microscopy. RESULTS The expression of FXR was upregulated after ischemic stroke, which is located in the nucleus of the neurons. FXR KO was found to reduce infarct volume and promote neurobehavioral recovery following tMCAO compared to the vehicle. The expression of apoptotic and pro-inflammatory factors decreased in FXR KO mice compared to the control. The number of NeuN+/TUNEL+ cells declined in the peri-infarct area of FXR KO mice compared to the vehicle. We further demonstrated that inhibition of FXR reduced calcium overload and addition of ionomycin could reverse this neuroprotective effect in vitro. What is more, in vivo results showed that enhancement of intracellular calcium concentrations could aggravate ischemic injury and reverse the neuroprotective effect of FXR KO in mice. CONCLUSIONS FXR KO can promote neurobehavioral recovery and attenuate ischemic brain injury, inflammatory release, and neuronal apoptosis via reducing calcium influx, suggesting its role as a therapeutic target for stroke treatments.","Shan, Hui-Min; Zang, Minhua; Zhang, Qi; Shi, Ru-Bing; Shi, Xiao-Jing; Mamtilahun, Muyassar; Liu, Chang; Luo, Long-Long; Tian, Xiaoying; Zhang, Zhijun; Yang, Guo-Yuan; Tang, Yaohui; Pu, Jun; Wang, Yongting",Journal of neuroinflammation,74,1

The profile of causative agents varies from place to place. Aims The objectives of our study were to detect the profile and trends of respiratory pathogens causing acute respiratory tract infection in children using a custom multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and to develop a diagnostic algorithm. Materials and Methods A total of 997 children with clinical manifestations of respiratory infections were included in the study. Their nasopharyngeal aspirate and throat swab samples were subjected to nucleic acid extraction followed by multiplex RT-PCR for eighteen viruses and six bacteria. Statistical Analysis Used Chi-square test was employed to study the P value of different viruses and bacteria. Results A total of 765 (76.73%) samples were found to be positive for one of the respiratory pathogens. Viruses were detected in 598 (59.98%) and bacteria in 167 (41.85%) samples, respectively. The prevalence of single and co-infections among viruses and bacteria were 77.76% and 22.24%, 81.44% and 18.56% each, respectively.

Conclusion RSV and S. pneumoniae were the most common pathogens detected, higher prevalence was observed in children <1 year of age. Viruses were predominant during winter months. The study helped to prepare diagnostic algorithm which will help in reducing diagnostic costs. However, further studies are required to assess whether viruses are bystander or real pathogens and include larger panel of bacteria and viruses for diagnosis.","Swamy, M Anjaneya; Malhotra, Bharti; Janardhan Reddy, P V; Tiwari, Jitendra",Indian journal of medical microbiology,74,1

Contaminated secretions in the ETT are associated with increased risk for microbial dissemination in the distal airways and increased resistance to airflow. We evaluated the effectiveness of micro computed tomography (MicroCT) for the quantification of ETT inner volume reduction in critically ill patients. METHODS We injected a known amount of gel into unused ETT to simulate secretions. We calculated the volume of gel analyzing MicroCT scans for a length of 20 cm. We then collected eleven ETTs after extubation of critically ill patients, recording clinical and demographical data. We assessed the amount of secretions by MicroCT and obtained ETT microbiological cultures. RESULTS Gel volumes assessed by MicroCT strongly correlated with injected gel volumes (p < 0.001, r2 = 0.999).MicroCT revealed the accumulation of secretions on all the ETTs (median 0.154, IQR:0.02-0.837 mL), corresponding to an average cross-sectional area reduction of 1.7%. The amount of secretions inversely correlated with patients' age (p = 0.011, rho = -0.727) but not with days of intubation, SAPS2, PaO2/FiO2 assessed on admission. Accumulation of secretions was higher in the cuff region (p = 0.003). Microbial growth occurred in cultures from 9/11 ETTs, and did not correlate with secretions amount. In 7/11 cases the same microbes were identified also in tracheal aspirates. CONCLUSIONS MicroCT appears as a feasible and precise technique to measure volume of secretions within ETTs after extubation. In patients, secretions tend to accumulate in the cuff region, with high variability among patients.","Coppadoro, Andrea; Bellani, Giacomo; Bronco, Alfio; Borsa, Roberto; Lucchini, Alberto; Bramati, Simone; Avalli, Leonello; Marcolin, Roberto; Pesenti, Antonio",BMC anesthesiology,74,17

A home-visiting nurse suspected catheter obstruction and performed a catheter exchange. However, bladder irrigation could not subsequently be performed. Computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis after transurethral perfusion of contrast medium demonstrated extravasation of the contrast material into the peritoneal cavity. Furthermore, the Foley catheter balloon was positioned in the peritoneal cavity through the bladder. The patient was diagnosed with peritonitis due to spontaneous intraperitoneal perforation of the urinary bladder, and exploratory laparotomy was performed.

There has been minimal study of mesh incorporation and interface strength with adhesive fixation for ventral hernia repair. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the fixation properties of fibrin glue as it compared to suture fixation of mesh in an onlay position. METHODS Twenty-four mongrel pigs were divided into three study arms based on time points for biomechanical evaluation: 24 h (n = 8), 7 days (n = 8), and 14 days (n = 8). Initial procedures included placement of two 4 × 6 cm pieces of wide-pore polypropylene mesh in an onlay position. One was fixated with 4 ml of fibrin glue and the other with four interrupted 2-0 polypropylene sutures. The shear strength of fixation was evaluated using a uniaxial testing device along with histological evaluation. Maximum force was normalized by the width of the mesh. RESULTS Mesh-tissue interface of glued and sutured specimens at 7 and 14 days did not fail in our testing configuration. Only at the 24-h time point the mesh detached from the tissue, and the sutured interface (10.4 N/cm) was significantly stronger than glued interface (4.9 N/cm, p = 0.004). Histopathologic and gross evaluations of the specimens revealed similar histologic features at all time points for both glued and sutured specimens. CONCLUSIONS With mesh in the onlay position, fixation to the abdominal wall occurs quickly. Though sutures were stronger at 24 h, as early as 1 week, the strength of the fixation exceeded the tissue or the mesh strength in our testing configuration for both glue and suture groups. Fixation strength is independent of technique at the latter time points. There are potential clinical advantages to the exclusive use of fibrin glue for fixation including acute post-operative pain, chronic post-operative pain, and recurrence for ventral incisional hernia repair.","Stoikes, N; Sharpe, J; Tasneem, H; Roan, E; Paulus, E; Powell, B; Webb, D; Handorf, C; Eckstein, E; Fabian, T; Voeller, G",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,74,1

Objectives To quantify the prevalence of families that fulfill the Amsterdam I or II criteria for Lynch syndrome in the Utah population and investigate the risk of colonic and extracolonic cancers in family members and their relatives. Design, Setting, and Participants In a population-based study, 202 families with Amsterdam I and II criteria–positive pedigrees in the Utah Population Database were identified. Of these, all cancer diagnoses in members of families with Amsterdam criteria and their first-degree, second-degree, and first-cousin relatives were located through linkage to the Utah Cancer Registry. The study was conducted from May 1 to June 30, 2016. Main Outcomes and Measures Standardized morbidity ratios (SMRs) were estimated by comparing the observed rates of cancer in relatives with population-expected rates estimated internally from the Utah Population Database. Results A total of 202 families meeting Amsterdam criteria for Lynch syndrome accounted for 2.6% of all colorectal cancers in the state; of these, 59 met both the Amsterdam I and Amsterdam II criteria. Cancers observed in significant excess in the first-degree relatives of Amsterdam criteria pedigrees included colorectal (SMR, 10.10; 95% CI, 9.43-10.81), endometrial (SMR, 5.89; 95% CI, 5.09-6.78), stomach (SMR, 2.90; 95% CI, 2.02-4.03), small intestine (SMR, 7.72; 95% CI, 5.17-11.08), prostate (SMR, 1.94; 95% CI, 1.73-2.17), kidney (SMR, 3.22; 95% CI, 2.45-4.16), urinary bladder (SMR, 1.62; 95% CI, 1.22-2.12), thyroid (SMR, 2.26; 95% CI, 1.55-3.17), and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (SMR, 2.10; 95% CI, 1.64-2.65). Risks of colorectal and endometrial cancers were also found to be elevated in second-degree (SMR, 4.31; 95% CI, 3.98-4.65 and SMR, 2.70; 95% CI, 2.30-3.14, respectively) and first-cousin (SMR, 1.85; 95% CI, 1.70-2.00 and SMR, 1.50; 95% CI, 1.29-1.73, respectively) relatives of families with Amsterdam criteria. Conclusions and Relevance In this population-based study of cancer risk in families fulfilling the Amsterdam criteria, many of the cancers previously reported to be associated with Lynch syndrome were observed, several previously unreported cancer associations were noted, and the risk of colorectal and endometrial cancer were markedly increased in first-, second-, and even third-degree relatives of these families. This study provides clinicians with population-based, unbiased data to counsel members of families meeting the Amsterdam criteria regarding their elevated risks of cancer and the importance of cancer screening.","Samadder, N Jewel; Smith, Ken Robert; Wong, Jathine; Thomas, Alun; Hanson, Heidi; Boucher, Kenneth; Kopituch, Cathryn; Cannon-Albright, Lisa A; Burt, Randall W; Curtin, Karen",JAMA oncology,74,0

BACKGROUND ALI is both life and limb threatening disease with a reported 9-15% mortality and 15-25% limb loss in the first month after presentation. Pitfalls of current endovascular techniques include major bleeding, distal embolism, and prolonged thrombolytic infusion. IPMT isolates the thrombus between two balloons and utilizes wire oscillation to increase the thombus-lytic exposure surface area followed by aspiration. It decreases systemic lytic exposure, procedure time, and distal embolism. METHODS Technical aspects, success, and bleeding complications in 24 consecutive patients with ALI treated with IPMT between October 2009 and September 2010 were analyzed. In-hospital and 30-day mortality, amputation rates and treatment success rates were determined. RESULTS 24 patients constituted 32 arteries; 18 (56.25%) were suprainguinal including 3 grafts (9.4%) and 14 (43.75%) were infrainguinal native arteries. Substantial or complete response was seen in >90% vessels with 87.5% patients revealing TIMI three flow while none demonstrated TIMI 2 or 3 pretreatment. Only three patients required adjunctive post-IPMT thrombolysis. In-hospital and 30-day all cause mortality was 4.16%. One patient died in-hospital and no patient underwent amputation. CONCLUSION Besides being the largest series of ALI patients treated with IPMT, this is the first and largest series including 14 native infrainguinal arteries. These results suggest IPMT to be a promising and safer therapeutic option in ALI, likely due to its site-specific nature and limited thrombolysis exposure time.","Gupta, Raghav; Hennebry, Thomas A",Catheterization and cardiovascular interventions : official journal of the Society for Cardiac Angiography & Interventions,74,20

Often, the introduction of labels is simply impossible in such measurements, and the application of label-free methods is the only reliable choice. By measuring the binding kinetics of Ni(II) ions to genetically modified flagellin layers, we demonstrate that: (1) Grating-Coupled Interferometry (GCI) is well suited to resolve the binding of ions, even at very low protein immobilization levels; (2) it supplies high quality kinetic data from which the number and strength of available binding sites can be determined, and (3) the rate constants of the binding events can also be obtained with high accuracy. Experiments were performed using a flagellin variant incorporating the C-terminal domain of the nickel-responsive transcription factor NikR. GCI results were compared to affinity data from titration calorimetry. We found that besides the low-affinity binding sites characterized by a micromolar dissociation constant (Kd), tetrameric FliC-NikRC molecules possess high-affinity binding sites with Kd values in the nanomolar range. GCI enabled us to obtain real-time kinetic data for the specific binding of an analyte with molar mass as low as 59 Da, even at signals lower than 1 pg/mm2.","Jankovics, Hajnalka; Kovacs, Boglarka; Saftics, Andras; Gerecsei, Tamas; Tóth, Éva; Szekacs, Inna; Vonderviszt, Ferenc; Horvath, Robert",Scientific reports,74,5

Increasing experience with analysis of HBV genomic data opens up the potential for using these data to inform insights into pathophysiology of infection and to underpin decision making in clinical practice. We here set out to undertake whole genome HBV sequencing from an adult who presented acutely unwell with a new diagnosis of HBV infection, and tested positive for both HBV anti-core IgM and IgG, possibly representing either acute hepatitis B infection (AHB) or chronic hepatitis B with an acute reactivation (CHB-AR). The distinction between these two scenarios may be important in predicting prognosis and underpinning treatment decisions, but can be challenging based on routine laboratory tests. Through application of deep whole-genome sequencing we typed the isolate as genotype-D1, and identified several minority variants including G1764A and G1986A substitutions in the pre-core promoter and pre-core regions, which support CHB-AR rather than AHB. In the longer term, enhanced deep sequencing data for HBV may provide improved evidence to distinguish between acute and chronic infection, to predict outcomes and to stratify treatment.","Downs, Louise O; McNaughton, Anna L; de Cesare, Mariateresa; Ansari, M Azim; Martin, Jacqueline; Woodrow, Charles; Bowden, Rory; Collier, Jane; Barnes, Eleanor; Matthews, Philippa C",Wellcome open research,74,31

Second-generation medical devices such as stent retrievers are now showing overwhelming efficacy in clinical trials, particularly in conjunction with intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator. AIMS AND DESIGN This statistical analysis plan utilizing a novel, sequential approach describes a prospective, individual patient data analysis of endovascular therapy in conjunction with intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator agreed upon by the Thrombectomy and Tissue Plasminogen Activator Collaborative Group. STUDY OUTCOMES This protocol will specify the primary outcome for efficacy, as 'favorable' outcome defined by the ordinal distribution of the modified Rankin Scale measured at three-months poststroke, but with modified Rankin Scales 5 and 6 collapsed into a single category. The primary analysis will aim to answer the questions: 'what is the treatment effect of endovascular therapy with intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator compared to intravenous tissue plasminogen activator alone on full scale modified Rankin Scale at 3 months?' and 'to what extent do key patient characteristics influence the treatment effect of endovascular therapy?'. Key secondary outcomes include effect of endovascular therapy on death within 90 days; analyses of modified Rankin Scale using dichotomized methods; and effects of endovascular therapy on symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage. Several secondary analyses will be considered as well as expanding patient cohorts to intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator-ineligible patients, should data allow. DISCUSSION This collaborative meta-analysis of individual participant data from randomized trials of endovascular therapy vs. control in conjunction with intravenous thrombolysis will demonstrate the efficacy and generalizability of endovascular therapy with intravenous thrombolysis as a concomitant medication.","MacIsaac, Rachael L; Khatri, Pooja; Bendszus, Martin; Bracard, Serge; Broderick, Joseph; Campbell, Bruce; Ciccone, Alfonso; Dávalos, Antoni; Davis, Stephen M; Demchuk, Andrew; Diener, Hans-Christoph; Dippel, Diederik; Donnan, Geoffrey A; Fiehler, Jens; Fiorella, David; Goyal, Mayank; Hacke, Werner; Hill, Michael D; Jahan, Reza; Jauch, Edward; Jovin, Tudor; Kidwell, Chelsea S; Liebeskind, David; Majoie, Charles B; Martins, Sheila Cristina Ouriques; Mitchell, Peter; Mocco, J; Muir, Keith W; Nogueira, Raul; Saver, Jeffrey L; Schonewille, Wouter J; Siddiqui, Adnan H; Thomalla, Götz; Tomsick, Thomas A; Turk, Aquilla S; White, Philip; Zaidat, Osama; Lees, Kennedy R",International journal of stroke : official journal of the International Stroke Society,74,19

METHODS This study comprised an issue and theme analysis of publicly accessible literature, data from jurisdictional health departments, and data obtained from two electronic surveys of ED directors and ED staff. The issues identified formed the basis of policy analysis and evaluation. RESULTS Pandemic (H(1)N(1) ) 2009 had a significant impact on EDs with presentation for patients with 'influenza-like illness' up to three times that of the same time in previous years. Staff reported a range of issues, including poor awareness of pandemic plans, patient and family aggression, chaotic information flow to themselves and the public, heightened stress related to increased workloads and lower levels of staffing due to illness, family care duties and redeployment of staff to flu clinics. Staff identified considerable discomfort associated with prolonged times wearing personal protective equipment. Staff believed that the care of non-flu patients was compromised during the pandemic as a result of overwork, distraction from core business and the difficulties associated with accommodating infectious patients in an environment that was not conducive. CONCLUSIONS This paper describes the breadth of the impact of pandemics on ED operations. It identifies a need to address a range of industrial, management and procedural issues. In particular, there is a need for a single authoritative source of information, the re-engineering of EDs to accommodate infectious patients and organizational changes to enable rapid deployment of alternative sources of care.","Fitzgerald, Gerry; Aitken, Peter; Shaban, Ramon Z; Patrick, Jennifer; Arbon, Paul; McCarthy, Sally; Clark, Michele; Considine, Julie; Finucane, Julie; Holzhauser, Kerri; Fielding, Elaine",Emergency medicine Australasia : EMA,74,1

Considering in person limitations because of the coronavirus pandemic, strategies for POCUS education by remote learning are necessary. Methods We crafted a 90-minute didactic training that was presented via a remote learning format. The main outcome of interest was the interobserver reliability of SPB effusion assessment by novice sonologists compared with POCUS faculty. Novice sonologists were pediatric emergency medicine (PEM) fellows. Pediatric emergency medicine fellows interpreted longitudinal SPB examinations obtained in our pediatric emergency department from July 2013 to June 2020. Assessments were performed 2 months after the remote training. Pediatric emergency medicine fellows had a limited experience performing these musculoskeletal scans and were blinded to POCUS faculty and each other's assessments. Interobserver reliability was assessed with Cohen [kappa] coefficient. Second, we calculated test characteristics of knee radiography compared with PEM POCUS faculty determination of SPB effusion by ultrasound. We further explored how effusion size measured by POCUS impacted the diagnosis by knee radiography. A receiver operator characteristic curve of knee radiography diagnosis of SPB effusion was created using the maximal height of SPB effusion by POCUS as the predictor variable. Results A total of 116 SPB scans in 71 patients were assessed. From this group, 70 scans were of affected knees and 46 scans were of contralateral, asymptomatic knees. The mean age of patients was 10 years and 46% were girl. The prevalence of SPB effusions was 42%. The [kappa] coefficients between the 3 novice sonologists and POCUS faculty were 0.75 (0.62-0.87), 0.77 (0.65-0.89), and 0.83 (0.72-0.93) with 88%, 89%, and 91% agreement. Knee radiography exhibited an overall sensitivity of 65% (95% confidence interval [CI], 46-79%), specificity of 84% (95% CI, 60-97%), negative predictive value of 55% (95% CI, 43-66%), and positive predictive value of 88% (95% CI, 73-96%) to diagnose SPB effusions. The area under the receiver operator characteristic curve was 0.850. With an SPB height cutoff of 4 mm as true positives, radiography had a sensitivity of 81% and a specificity of 83%. Conclusions After a remote teleconference didactic session, PEM fellows were able to successfully diagnose SPB effusions using a longitudinal view with substantial interobserver reliability. Knee radiography exhibited limited sensitivity to rule out SPB effusions.","Riera, Antonio; Leviter, Julie I; Iqbal, Ammarah; Soma, Gauthami; Malik, Rabia N; Chen, Lei",Pediatric emergency care,74,17

There is an urgent need to reduce opioid tampering and subsequent abuse without creating barriers to safe, effective analgesia. Similar to the ""magic bullet"" concept of antibiotic development (kill the bacteria without harming the patient), the idea behind reformulating opioid analgesics is to make them more difficult to tamper with and abuse by drug abusers but innocuous to the compliant patient. As antibiotics exploit differences in bacterial and human physiology, tamper-resistant formulations depend on differences in the way drug abusers and compliant patients consume opioids. Most opioid abusers tamper with tablets to facilitate oral, intranasal, or intravenous administration, whereas compliant patients usually take intact tablets. Pharmaceutical strategies to deter opioid abuse predominantly focus on tablet tampering, incorporating physical barriers (eg, crush resistance) or embedded chemicals that render tampered tablets inert, unusable, or noxious. Deterring tampering and abuse of intact tablets is more challenging. At present, only a few formulations with characteristics designed to oppose tampering for abuse have received approval by the US Food and Drug Administration, and none has been permitted to include claims of abuse deterrence or tamper resistance in their labeling. This review discusses the potential benefits, risks, and limitations associated with available tamper-resistant opioids and those in development.","Stanos, Steven P; Bruckenthal, Patricia; Barkin, Robert L",Mayo Clinic proceedings,74,16

Several studies have demonstrated the role of neutralizing antibodies induced by the spike (S) glycoprotein in protecting susceptible hosts from lethal infection. However, the anti-SARS-CoV antibody response is short-lived in patients who have recovered from SARS, making it critical to develop additional vaccine strategies. SARS-CoV-specific memory CD8 T cells persisted for up to 6 years after SARS-CoV infection, a time at which memory B cells and antivirus antibodies were undetectable in individuals who had recovered from SARS. In this study, we assessed the ability of virus-specific memory CD8 T cells to mediate protection against infection in the absence of SARS-CoV-specific memory CD4 T or B cells. We demonstrate that memory CD8 T cells specific for a single immunodominant epitope (S436 or S525) substantially protected 8- to 10-month-old mice from lethal SARS-CoV infection. Intravenous immunization with peptide-loaded dendritic cells (DCs) followed by intranasal boosting with recombinant vaccinia virus (rVV) encoding S436 or S525 resulted in accumulation of virus-specific memory CD8 T cells in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BAL), lungs, and spleen. Upon challenge with a lethal dose of SARS-CoV, virus-specific memory CD8 T cells efficiently produced multiple effector cytokines (gamma interferon [IFN-γ], tumor necrosis factor alpha [TNF-α], and interleukin 2 [IL-2]) and cytolytic molecules (granzyme B) and reduced lung viral loads. Overall, our results show that SARS-CoV-specific memory CD8 T cells protect susceptible hosts from lethal SARS-CoV infection, but they also suggest that SARS-CoV-specific CD4 T cell and antibody responses are necessary for complete protection. IMPORTANCE Virus-specific CD8 T cells are required for pathogen clearance following primary SARS-CoV infection. However, the role of SARS-CoV-specific memory CD8 T cells in mediating protection after SARS-CoV challenge has not been previously investigated. In this study, using a prime-boost immunization approach, we showed that virus-specific CD8 T cells protect susceptible 8- to 10-month-old mice from lethal SARS-CoV challenge. Thus, future vaccines against emerging coronaviruses should emphasize the generation of a memory CD8 T cell response for optimal protection.","Channappanavar, Rudragouda; Fett, Craig; Zhao, Jincun; Meyerholz, David K; Perlman, Stanley",Journal of virology,74,1

We hypothesized that underlying interactions between immunoinflammatory pathways related to responses to aeroallergen and virus are involved, and that evidence of these interactions is detectable in circulating cells during exacerbations. To address this hypothesis we used a genomics-based approach involving profiling of PBMC subpopulations collected during exacerbation vs convalescence by microarray and flow cytometry. We demonstrate that circulating T cells manifest the postactivated ""exhausted"" phenotype during exacerbations, whereas monocyte/dendritic cell populations display up-regulated CCR2 expression accompanied by phenotypic changes that have strong potential for enhancing local inflammation after their recruitment to the atopic lung. Notably, up-regulation of FcepsilonR1, which is known to markedly amplify capacity for allergen uptake/presentation to Th2 effector cells via IgE-mediated allergen capture, and secondarily programming of IL-4/IL-13-dependent IL-13R(+) alternatively activated macrophages that have been demonstrated in experimental settings to be a potent source of autocrine IL-13 production. We additionally show that this disease-associated activation profile can be reproduced in vitro by cytokine exposure of atopic monocytes, and furthermore that IFN-alpha can exert both positive and negative roles in the process. Our findings suggest that respiratory viral infection in atopic children may initiate an atopy-dependent cascade that amplifies and sustains airway inflammation initiated by innate antiviral immunity via harnessing underlying atopy-associated mechanisms. These interactions may account for the unique susceptibility of atopics to severe viral-induced asthma exacerbations.","Subrata, Lily S; Bizzintino, Joelene; Mamessier, Emilie; Bosco, Anthony; McKenna, Katherine L; Wikström, Matthew E; Goldblatt, Jack; Sly, Peter D; Hales, Belinda J; Thomas, Wayne R; Laing, Ingrid A; LeSouëf, Peter N; Holt, Patrick G",Journal of immunology,74,1

Further, effects of using two different routes of infection of Streptococcus agalactiae; intraperitoneal injection (IP) and cohabitation with the shedder fish (cohab), on the genomic parameters, prediction accuracy and response to selection are compared. The comparison was made between two different lines of fish; one selected for S. agalactiae resistance for one generation and randomly mated for two generations (to mimic the multiplication activities occurring in distribution channels and hatcheries); and the other unselected. 1,500 fish, each from these two lines, were used for the experimental challenge test. Survival analysis using Kaplan-Meier estimators and Hazard's ratio was used to quantify differences in mortality between the two lines. Further genomic analysis was performed with 2,684 fish and 35,745 SNPs using both univariate and bivariate GBLUP models. Genetic selection for resistance to S. agalactiae led to the significant (p < .001) reduction in the risk of death by 65% in the selected line, compared to the unselected line. Similarly, the risk of death via cohabitation route of infection significantly (p < .01) decreased by 80%, compared to IP. The genetic correlation between these two routes of infection was ~0.9. Genetic selection changed the impact of the routes of infection, with the change in the distribution of estimated breeding values and the gain of 3.04 ± 1.25 days as selection response (p < .05).","Joshi, Rajesh; Skaaurd, Anders; Tola Alvarez, Alejandro",Journal of animal breeding and genetics = Zeitschrift fur Tierzuchtung und Zuchtungsbiologie,74,15

The primary diagnosis of the first episode in spells with emergency admission were coded with definitions for acute ACSC, chronic ACSC and vaccine-preventable diseases. SETTING National Health Service England. PARTICIPANTS 916 375 ACSC emergency admissions in 7 39 618 patients were identified between April 2011 and March 2012. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES ORs of ACSC for each ethnic group relative to the White British majority group adjusted for age, sex and area deprivation. RESULTS Acute ACSC admission risk adjusted for age and sex was particularly high among Other (OR 1.73; 95% CI 1.69 to 1.77) and Pakistani (1.51; 95% CI 1.48 to 1.54) compared with White British patients. For chronic ACSC, high risk was found among Other (2.02; 95% CI 1.97 to 2.08), Pakistani (2.07; 95% CI 2.02 to 2.12) and Bangladeshi (1.36; 95% CI 1.30 to 1.42). For vaccine-preventable diseases, other (2.42; 95% CI 2.31 to 2.54), Pakistani (1.94; 95% CI 1.85 to 2.04), Bangladeshi (1.48; 95% CI 1.36 to 1.62), Black African (1.45; 95% CI 1.36 to 1.54) and white other (1.38; 95% CI 1.33 to 1.43) groups. Elevated risk was only partly explained in analyses also adjusting for area deprivation. CONCLUSIONS ACSC admission was especially high among individuals of Bangladeshi, Pakistani, Black African, white other or other background with up to twofold differences compared with the white British group. This suggests that these ethnic groups are not receiving optimal primary care.","Petersen, Jakob; Kandt, Jens; Longley, Paul",Journal of epidemiology and community health,74,12

These manifestations range from headache and dizziness to altered mental status and consciousness, anosmia, ageusia, sensory disturbances, and stroke. The mechanisms by which the neurological symptoms arise are not yet determined but may either proceed as an indirect consequence of systemic hyperinflammation or result from the direct invasion of the virus to neural and glial cells. The neural invasion can explain both the retrograde pathway of encephalitis and the early manifestation of anosmia by invading the olfactory bulb. Moreover, in the case of attacking the brain stem, it may take part in the early apnea manifestation reported by patients. Additionally, neurotropism of the virus could be the cause of acute hemorrhagic encephalitis. Hyperinflammation can have acute and prolonged effects in the nervous system, such as acute demyelination and predisposition to multiple sclerosis. Moreover, the pro-inflammatory state contributes to hypercoagulation, which in turn could result in cerebrovascular injuries in COVID-19 patients. This chapter would discuss that the neurologic manifestations of the COVID-19 are to be looked at as a multifactorial entangled phenomenon.","Delavari, Farnaz; Varzaneh, Farnaz Najmi; Rezaei, Nima",Advances in experimental medicine and biology,74,1

The diffusion-weighted imaging and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) mismatch is a reasonable predictor of stroke within 4.5 hours of symptom onset, and its clinical usefulness in selecting patients for thrombolysis is currently being investigated. The accuracy of the visual mismatch rating is moderate, and we hypothesized that the predictive value of stroke onset within 4.5 hours could be improved by including various clinical and imaging parameters. METHODS In this study, 141 patients in whom magnetic resonance imaging was obtained within 9 hours after symptom onset were included. Relative FLAIR signal intensity was calculated in the region of nonreperfused core. Mean Tmax was calculated in the total region with Tmax >6 s. Mean relative FLAIR, mean Tmax, lesion volume with Tmax >6 s, age, site of arterial stenosis, core volume, and location of infarct were analyzed by logistic regression to predict stroke onset time before or after 4.5 hours. RESULTS Receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis revealed an area under the curve of 0.68 (95% confidence interval 0.59-0.78) for the visual diffusion-weighted imaging/FLAIR mismatch, thereby correctly classifying 69% of patients with an onset time before or after 4.5 hours. Age, relative FLAIR, and Tmax increased the accuracy significantly (P<0.01) to an area under the curve of 0.82 (95% confidence interval 0.74-0.89). This new predictive model correctly categorized 77% of patients according to stroke onset before versus after 4.5 hours. CONCLUSIONS In patients with unknown stroke onset, the accuracy of predicting time from symptom onset within 4.5 hours is improved by obtaining relative FLAIR and perfusion imaging.","Wouters, Anke; Dupont, Patrick; Norrving, Bo; Laage, Rico; Thomalla, Götz; Albers, Gregory W; Thijs, Vincent; Lemmens, Robin",Stroke,74,1

Objective We investigated the discriminative power of morphological and functional features in assessing the axillary lymph node. Methods We retrospectively analysed data from 52 consecutive patients who undergone DCE-MRI and were diagnosed with primary breast carcinoma: 94 lymph nodes were identified. Per each lymph node, we extracted morphological features: circularity, compactness, convexity, curvature, elongation, diameter, eccentricity, irregularity, radial length, entropy, rectangularity, roughness, smoothness, sphericity, spiculation, surface, and volume. Moreover, we extracted functional features: time to peak (TTP), maximum signal difference (MSD), wash-in intercept (WII), wash-out intercept (WOI), wash-in slope (WIS), wash-out slope (WOS), area under gadolinium curve (AUGC), area under wash-in (AUWI), and area under wash-out (AUWO). Selection of important features in predicting metastasis has been done by means of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Performance of linear discriminant analysis was analysed. Results All morphological features but circularity showed a significant difference between median values of metastatic lymph nodes group and nonmetastatic lymph nodes group. All dynamic parameters except for MSD and WOS showed a statistically significant difference between median values of metastatic lymph nodes group and nonmetastatic lymph nodes group. Best results for discrimination of metastatic and nonmetastatic lymph nodes were obtained by AUGC (accuracy 75.8%), WIS (accuracy 71.0%), WOS (accuracy 71.0%), and AUCWO (accuracy 72.6%) for dynamic features and by compactness (accuracy 82.3%), curvature (accuracy 71.0%), radial length (accuracy 71.0%), roughness (accuracy 74.2%), smoothness (accuracy 77.2%), and speculation (accuracy 72.6%) for morphological features. Linear combination of all morphological and/or of all dynamic features did not increase accuracy in metastatic lymph nodes discrimination. Conclusions Compactness as morphological feature and area under time-intensity curve as dynamic feature were the best parameters in identifying metastatic lymph nodes on breast MRI.","Fusco, Roberta; Sansone, Mario; Granata, Vincenza; Di Bonito, Maurizio; Avino, Franca; Catalano, Orlando; Botti, Gerardo; Petrillo, Antonella",BioMed research international,74,16

One of these alternatives is the QuEChERS, originally developed for the analysis of pesticide residues, producing cleaner extracts than liquid-liquid extraction, and easier separation of aqueous and organic phases. However, there are few published studies on the miniaturization of this technique for forensic toxicology, especially in postmortem analysis. We developed and validated a modified micro-QuEChERS and LC-MS-MS assay to quantify 16 antidepressants, seven antipsychotics and three metabolites, and semi-quantify norfluoxetine and norsertraline in postmortem blood. The calibration curve was linear from 1-500 ng/mL, achieved a r>0.99, with all standards quantifying within ±15% of target except ±20% at the limit of quantification (LOQ) of 1 ng/mL for 26 substances. The F test was applied to evaluate if the variance between replicates remained constant for all calibrators. Six weighting factors were analyzed (1/x, 1/x2, 1/x0,5, 1/y, 1/y2, 1/y0,5), with the weighting factor with the lowest sum of residual regression errors (1/x2) selected. No endogenous or exogenous interferences were observed. Method imprecision and bias were less than 19.0% and 19.7%, respectively. Advantages of this method include a low sample volume of 100 µL, simple but effective sample preparation and a rapid 8.5 min run time. The validated analytical method was successfully applied to the analysis of 100 authentic postmortem samples.","Rodrigues, Taís B; Morais, Damila R; Gianvecchio, Victor A P; Aquino, Elvis M; Cunha, Ricardo L; Huestis, Marilyn A; Costa, Jose Luiz",Journal of analytical toxicology,74,5

METHODS In 2009, 193 National IHR Focal Points (NFPs) were invited to use the decision instrument in Annex 2 of the IHR to determine whether 10 fictitious public health events should be notified to WHO. Each event's notifiability was assessed independently by an expert panel. The degree of consensus among NFPs and of concordance between NFPs and the expert panel was considered high when more than 70% agreed on a response. FINDINGS Overall, 74% of NFPs responded. The median degree of consensus among NFPs on notification decisions was 78%. It was high for the six events considered notifiable by the majority (median: 80%; range: 76-91) but low for the remaining four (median: 55%; range: 54-60). The degree of concordance between NFPs and the expert panel was high for the five events deemed notifiable by the panel (median: 82%; range: 76-91) but low (median: 51%; range: 42-60) for those not considered notifiable. The NFPs identified notifiable events with greater sensitivity than specificity (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION When used by NFPs, the notification assessment process in Annex 2 of the IHR was sensitive in identifying public health events that were considered notifiable by an expert panel, but only moderately specific. The reliability of the assessments could be increased by expanding guidance on the use of the decision instrument and by including more specific criteria for assessing events and clearer definitions of terms.","Haustein, Thomas; Hollmeyer, Helge; Hardiman, Max; Harbarth, Stephan; Pittet, Didier",Bulletin of the World Health Organization,74,16

Cases of sporadic nocardiosis have been reported in glomerular disease patients, and this observation was conducted to comprehensively understand the manifestations of and treatments for nocardiosis, which is commonly misdiagnosed as pneumonia or tuberculosis or even as lung cancer or metastatic tumors in glomerular disease patients. METHODS We reviewed the demographic characteristics, laboratory abnormalities, radiological features, and treatments of 7 patients with nocardiosis and glomerular disease receiving steroids and immunosuppression therapy at the nephrology department of the Second Xiangya Hospital between 2012 and 2019. RESULTS It was found that all 7 patients had been receiving methylprednisolone for renal disease at a median dose of 20 mg per day and a median duration of 4 months before developing nocardiosis. There were 4 males and 3 females, and the median age was 52.14 years. All 7 patients had hypoalbuminemia at the time of admission. In addition, various cystic abscesses in the subcutaneous tissue, with or without lung and brain involvement, were observed in these patients. Encouragingly, body temperatures returned to normal, and subcutaneous abscesses diminished or disappeared with compound sulfamethoxazole treatment alone or in combination with linezolid, imipenem and mezlocillin/sulbactam. CONCLUSIONS It was shown that multisite abscesses, including subcutaneous, pulmonary and cerebral abscesses, were the common manifestations of nocardiosis in glomerular disease patients. Sulfonamide was the first-line antibiotic therapy for nocardiosis, and combinations of other antibiotics were also needed in some serious cases.","Han, Yuzhang; Huang, Zineng; Zhang, Huifang; He, Liyu; Sun, Lin; Liu, Yu; Liu, Fuyou; Xiao, Li",BMC nephrology,74,30

Sociodemographic and clinical data were collected and descriptive analyses were carried out. Depending on whether individuals reported a worsening or no change/improvement in anxiety and depression symptoms during lockdown, the sample was divided in two groups. A logistic regression was then carried out to identify risk factors associated with adverse mental health outcomes. RESULTS Overall, frequency of use for the majority of individuals with SUD remained stable during lockdown in comparison to the pre-lockdown era, although a reduction was found in frequency of tobacco, alcohol, cannabis and cocaine use in a small fraction of individuals with SUD. Symptoms of clinical anxiety were found in 58.7% of the sample while 48.2% of participants scored above the clinical threshold for depression. In addition, 50.3% of the sample reported a deterioration in depression and anxiety symptoms during lockdown that was associated with the following risk factors: previous trauma-exposure, female gender, distress and isolation, income reduction and alcohol use. CONCLUSION A high percentage of patients with SUD experienced adverse mental health outcomes during lockdown that were associated with several risk factors, which should be taken into account in policy making and prevention strategies, as well as in clinical practice, in order to provide personalized care to SUD patients during the time of the pandemic.","Blithikioti, C; Nuño, L; Paniello, B; Gual, A; Miquel, L",Journal of psychiatric research,74,27

So-me authors recommend anticoagulation at therapeutic doses for, at least, the most severely ill patients; this practice is not free of risks, which is why only thromboembolic prophylaxis is recommended by other consensuses. In the case of previously anticoagulated patients, changing the oral anticoagulant for a low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) is generally recommended. We present the cases of two patients admitted due to COVID-19, without serious clinical data, in whom anticoagulation (acenocoumarol and rivaroxaban, respectively) was replaced by LMWH at therapeutic doses, both presenting abdominal bleeding. This type of bleeding is an infrequent complication in anticoagulated patients, but the concurrence of two cases in a short period of time in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic leads us to consider that there is not yet any clear evidence on therapeutic anticoagulation in SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Álvarez-Rodríguez, E; González González, R; Torres-Gárate, R; López-Riquelme, P; González Martil, I; Abad Cuñado, V",Anales del sistema sanitario de Navarra,74,5

Influenza increases clinical pneumococcal disease incidence. Pneumococcal vaccination could therefore be a supplement to influenza vaccination. This study evaluated all-cause mortality and antibiotic consumption according to elderly people's influenza and pneumococcal vaccination status. Its goal was to demonstrate that vaccination with both Influenza and pneumococcal vaccines decrease all-cause mortality and antibiotic consumption. From 2004-10-01 to 2004-12-31 (3 mo), elderly people (≥ 65 y) who lived in the Gard department (South of France) were offered both vaccinations. Among the 68,897 subjects followed-up one year after this vaccination campaign, 21,303 (30.9%) were vaccinated with both vaccines, 18,651 (27.1%) with influenza vaccine alone, 3,769 (5.5%) with pneumococcal vaccine alone; 25,174 (36.5%) subjects were unvaccinated. Mortality rate (per 1,000 inhabitants-year) adjusted on gender, age and prior underlying chronic disease was 17.9 (95% CI: 16.3-19.6), 20.8 (19.0-22.8), 22.5 (19.0-26.6) and 24.7 (22.7-26.8), respectively. It was 42.1 (38.8-45.8) in elderly people with underlying chronic disease who received both vaccines vs. 58.1 (53.7-62.9) in unvaccinated elderly people. The decrease in mortality rate was 27.0% (20.0-34.0) in subjects who received both vaccines and 16.0% (6.0-24.0) in those who received influenza vaccine. No significant reduction in mortality rate was seen with the pneumococcal vaccine alone. Influenza and/or pneumococcal vaccinations did not decrease antibiotic consumption that drastically increases during the winter period. An additive effect was observed in the prevention of all-cause mortality with influenza and pneumococcal vaccines given together in elderly people, including in those with underlying chronic disease.","Mahamat, Aba; Daurès, Jean-Pierre; de Wzieres, Benoît",Human vaccines & immunotherapeutics,74,8

Here we systematically review the effects of the 7 known human coronaviruses on olfaction to determine if SARS-CoV-2 distinctly affects the olfactory system. METHOD PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, bioRxiv, medRxiv and DOAJ were searched for studies describing pathophysiological, immunohistochemical, cytological and clinical data. RESULTS 49 studies were included. Common cold coronaviruses lead to sinonasal inflammation which can cause transient and chronic loss of smell. MERS-CoV entry receptors were not found in the nasal mucosa and it did not impair olfaction. SARS-CoV-1 had low affinity for its receptor ACE2, limiting olfactory effects. Anosmia is frequent in SARS-CoV-2 infections. SARS-CoV-2â€™s entry factors ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are expressed in the nasal respiratory epithelium and olfactory supporting cells. SARS-CoV-2 appeared to target the olfactory cleft while diffuse nasal inflammation was not observed. Damage of the olfactory epithelium was observed in animal models. Alternative receptors such as furin and neuropilin-1 and the similarity of viral proteins to odourant receptors could amplify olfactory impairment in SARS-CoV-2 infection. CONCLUSIONS The pathophysiology of anosmia in SARS-CoV-2 infection is distinct from other coronaviruses due to preferentially targeting olfactory supporting cells. However, SARS-CoV-2 does not cause sinonasal inflammation in spite of preferred entry factor expression in the nasal respiratory epithelium. This raises doubts about the attention given to ACE2. Alternative receptors, odourant receptor mimicry and other as yet unknown mechanisms may be crucial in the pathogenesis of anosmia in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Further studies are warranted to investigate infection mechanisms beyond ACE2.","Zugaj, M; van Ditzhuijzen, N S; Golebski, K; Fokkens, W J",Rhinology,74,1

Several diseases have increased circulating and urinary angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity, but there is little information about changes in ACEs activity in children with sickle cell disease (SCD). OBJECTIVE We examined circulating and urinary ACE 1 activity in children with SCD. METHODS This cross-sectional study compared children who were carriers of SCD with children who comprised a control group (CG). Serum and urinary activities of ACE were evaluated, as were biochemical factors, urinary album/creatinine rates, and estimated glomerular filtration rate. RESULTS Urinary ACE activity was significantly higher in patients with SCD than in healthy children (median 0.01; range 0.00-0.07 vs median 0.00; range 0.00-0.01 mU/mL·creatinine, p < 0.001. No significant difference in serum ACE activities between the SCD and CG groups was observed (median 32.25; range 16.2-59.3 vs median 40.9; range 18.0-53.4) mU/m`L·creatinine, p < 0.05. CONCLUSION Our data revealed a high urinary ACE 1 activity, different than plasmatic level, in SCD patients suggesting a dissociation between the intrarenal and systemic RAAS. The increase of urinary ACE 1 activity in SCD patients suggests higher levels of Ang II with a predominance of classical RAAS axis, that can induce kidney damage.","Hsien, Ho Chi; Casarini, Dulce Elena; Carvalhaes, João Tomas de Abreu; Ronchi, Fernanda Aparecida; Oliveira, Lilian Caroline Gonçalves de; Braga, Josefina Aparecida Pellegrini",Jornal brasileiro de nefrologia : 'orgao oficial de Sociedades Brasileira e Latino-Americana de Nefrologia,74,7

Microarray technology is one of the few tools that is able to solve such problems. It is based on high-throughput recognition of a target to the probe and has the potential to simultaneously measure the presence of numerous molecules in multiplexed tests, all contained in a small drop of test fluid. Microarrays allow the parallel analysis of genomic or proteomic content in healthy versus disease-affected or altered tissues or cells. The signal read-out from the microarrays is done with organic dyes which often suffer of photobleaching, low brightness and background fluorescence. Recent data show that the use of fluorescent nanocrystals named ""quantum dots"" (QDs) allows to push these limits away. QDs are sufficiently bright to be detected as individual particles, extremely resistant against photobleaching and provide unique possibilities for multiplexing, thus supplying the microarray technology with a novel read-out option enabling the sensitivity of detection to reach the single-molecule level. This paper reviews QDs applications to microarray-based detection and demonstrates how the combination of microarray and QDs technologies may increase sensitivity and highly parallel capacities of multiplexed microarrays. Such a combination should provide the breakthrough results in drug discovery, cancer diagnosis and establish new therapeutic approaches through the identification of binding target molecules and better understanding of cell signalling pathways.","Rousserie, Gilles; Sukhanova, Alyona; Even-Desrumeaux, Klervi; Fleury, Fabrice; Chames, Patrick; Baty, Daniel; Oleinikov, Vladimir; Pluot, Michel; Cohen, Jacques H M; Nabiev, Igor",Critical reviews in oncology/hematology,74,1

Synergies between loss of C9ORF72 functions and gain of toxicities from the repeat expansions contribute to C9ORF72-mediated pathogenesis. However, how loss of C9orf72 impacts neuronal and synaptic functions remains undetermined. Here, we showed that long-term potentiation at the dentate granule cells and long-term depression at the Schaffer collateral/commissural synapses at the area CA1 were reduced in the hippocampus of C9orf72 knockout mice. Using unbiased transcriptomic analysis, we identified that Klotho, a longevity gene, was selectively dysregulated in an age-dependent manner. Specifically, Klotho protein expression in the hippocampus of C9orf72 knockout mice was incorrectly enriched in the dendritic regions of CA1 with concomitant reduction in granule cell layer of dentate gyrus at 3-month of age followed by an accelerating decline during aging. Furthermore, adult hippocampal neurogenesis was reduced in C9orf72 knockout mice. Taken together, our data suggest that C9ORF72 is required for synaptic plasticity and adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus and Klotho deregulations may be part of C9ORF72-mediated toxicity.","Ho, Wan Yun; Navakkode, Sheeja; Liu, Fujia; Soong, Tuck Wah; Ling, Shuo-Chien",Acta neuropathologica communications,74,1

We previously showed that SARS-CoV lacking the E gene (SARS-CoV-ΔE) is attenuated in several animal model systems. Here, we show that absence of the E protein resulted in reduced expression of proinflammatory cytokines, decreased numbers of neutrophils in lung infiltrates, diminished lung pathology, and increased mouse survival, suggesting that lung inflammation contributed to SARS-CoV virulence. Further, infection with SARS-CoV-ΔE resulted in decreased activation of NF-κB compared to levels for the wild-type virus. Most important, treatment with drugs that inhibited NF-κB activation led to a reduction in inflammation and lung pathology in both SARS-CoV-infected cultured cells and mice and significantly increased mouse survival after SARS-CoV infection. These data indicated that activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway represents a major contribution to the inflammation induced after SARS-CoV infection and that NF-κB inhibitors are promising antivirals in infections caused by SARS-CoV and potentially other pathogenic human coronaviruses.","DeDiego, Marta L; Nieto-Torres, Jose L; Regla-Nava, Jose A; Jimenez-Guardeño, Jose M; Fernandez-Delgado, Raul; Fett, Craig; Castaño-Rodriguez, Carlos; Perlman, Stanley; Enjuanes, Luis",Journal of virology,74,16

Here we detected two lncRNAs, nuclear-enriched autosomal transcript 1 (NEAT1) and metastasis associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (MALAT1), in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and plasma of HIV-1-infected patients. METHODS Fifty-nine HIV-1-infected patients and 21 healthy controls were recruited for the study, of whom 31 patients were highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART)-naïve and 28 patients had been receiving HAART for more than 1 year with undetectable viral loads. Total RNA was extracted from PBMCs and plasma, and levels of NEAT1 and MALAT1 were determined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS We found that the levels of NEAT1 and MALAT1 in PBMCs were up-regulated in HAART-naïve patients and were reduced in patients receiving HAART. NEAT1 was down-regulated in the plasma of infected patients and expression was correlated with CD4 T-cell count. CONCLUSIONS Our findings suggest that NEAT1 and MALAT1 may interact with HIV-1 in vivo and that the presence of NEAT1 in plasma is a potential biomarker of HIV-1 infection.","Jin, C; Peng, X; Xie, T; Lu, X; Liu, F; Wu, H; Yang, Z; Wang, J; Cheng, L; Wu, N",HIV medicine,74,1

Reportedly, Rotta-manufactured glucosamine products are more likely to be effective, and a possible explanation is greater bioavailability than other brands. Specifically, the aim was to compare the steady-state pharmacokinetics of Rotta- and non-Rotta-manufactured glucosamine products in healthy volunteers and examine the interindividual variability. METHODS In a crossover design, healthy adult participants ingested 1500 mg/day of a Rotta (DONA powder sachets; imported by Mylan Health, Carole Park, QLD, Australia) and a non-Rotta (glucosamine sulphate 1500 mg one-a-day tablet; Blackmores, Warriewood, NSW, Australia) glucosamine product/brand individually for 6 days. Blood samples were collected immediately before and for 12 h after the ingestion of the last dose of each brand and analysed to determine plasma levels of glucosamine. The pharmacokinetic parameters at steady state [including the minimum (Css min) and maximum (Css max) plasma concentration of glucosamine, time to reach Css max post-dosing (Tss max) and area under the plasma concentration vs time curve (AUCss 0-12)] for each brand were calculated and statistically compared. RESULTS Fourteen participants [mean age 35.5 years (s.d. 8.8)] were recruited (64.2% males). No significant differences were observed in the pharmacokinetic parameters between the two brands. However, for both brands, the coefficient of variation for Css min, Tss max and AUCss 0-12 exceeded 20%, indicating considerable differences in the parameters between participants. No significant association of the pharmacokinetic parameters was observed with various dosing- and participant-related variables. CONCLUSION Substantial interindividual differences in the absorption and elimination of glucosamine could be a cause of variable clinical outcomes in OA.

We hypothesized that 7 days of noninvasive cardiac-event monitoring early after stroke would accelerate detection of AF and thus uptake of effective therapy. METHODS We performed a pragmatic randomized trial with objective outcome assessment among patients presenting in sinus rhythm with no AF history, within 7 days of ischemic stroke symptom onset. Patients were randomized to standard practice investigations (SP) to detect AF, or SP plus additional monitoring (SP-AM). AM comprised 7 days of noninvasive cardiac-event monitoring reported by an accredited cardiac electrocardiology laboratory. Primary outcome was detection of AF at 14 days. RESULTS One-hundred patients were enrolled from 2 centers. Within 14 days of stroke, sustained paroxysms of AF were detected in 18% of patients undergoing SP-AM versus 2% undergoing SP (P<0.05). Paroxysms of any-duration were detected in 44% of patients undergoing SP-AM versus 4% undergoing SP (P<0.001). These differences persisted at 90 days. Anticoagulant therapy was commenced within 14 days in 16% of SP-AM patients versus none randomized to SP (P<0.01). This difference persisted to 90 days (22% versus 6%; P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS Routine noninvasive cardiac-event monitoring after acute stroke enhances detection of paroxysmal AF and early anticoagulation. Extended monitoring should be offered to all eligible patients soon after acute stroke. Guidelines on investigation for AF in stroke patients could be strengthened.

In this work, the class I locus (Ctid-UBA) was isolated from a grass carp fosmid library, and its polymorphisms and tissue expression were investigated. The Ctid-UBA and Ctid-beta2-microglobulin genes then were expressed and refolded, and tetramer techniques were used to identify the CTL response. The interaction between grass carp type I IFN and Ctid-UBA genes was investigated. Two fosmids coding for Ctid-UBA *0101 and Ctid-UBA *0201 genes were sequenced. The SXY box and IFN-stimulated regulatory element motifs were located from the start codons to -800 bp in Ctid-UBA. A Southern blot showed three to four bands, suggesting that grass carp contains at least three class I loci. In addition, the Ctid-UBA allelic genes are expressed in all tissue of grass carp. The three-dimensional structure of Ctid-UBA *0102 showed that the peptide-binding domain was formed by the alpha1 and alpha2 domains, which could bind several nonapeptides of grass carp hemorrhagic virus. There were 1.60% more PE-positive cells in P1(QPNEAIRSL)-immunized fish than in blank and adjuvant control groups. Additionally, recombinant grass carp IFN could regulate the expression of Ctid-UBA.

Adult patients admitted to Hartford Hospital from 1/2005 to 12/2014 with respiratory culture for MSSA or S. pneumoniae were considered for inclusion. Non-ICU, CAP patients were included. Early clinical failure (ECF) was defined as persistent signs/symptoms or change of antibiotic due to poor response at 72-96 h. A multivariate analysis was performed to evaluate predictors of ECF. Over the study period, 403 MSSA and 227 S. pneumoniae positive respiratory cultures were identified. The majority of patients were excluded due to the following: no signs/symptoms of pneumonia, hospital-acquired pneumonia, alternative antibiotics, and polymicrobial infection. Thirty-nine patients met inclusion/exclusion criteria. All but three patients in the S. pneumoniae group received ceftriaxone + azithromycin. ECF was greater in the MSSA group (53 vs. 4 %, P = 0.003), as was length of stay (7.5 ± 5.4 vs. 4.6 ± 3.3 days, P = 0.006).

This study aimed to compare intracorporoeal-knotting and endoloop tecniques used to close appendiceal stump in laparoscopic appendectomy. METHODS This study included patients who underwent laparoscopic appendectomy with preliminary diagnosis of acute appendicitis in General Surgery Department of Adana Numune Training and Research Hospital between June 2009 and July 2013. The demographics, appendiceal stump closure tecniques, operation time, complications, and length of hospital stays of the patients were compared. RESULTS A total of one hundred and twenty-six patients underwent laparoscopic appendectomy (Female: 81, Male: 45). Intracorporeal-knotting (Group 1) was performed in sixty-five patients; whereas, endoloop (Group 2) was performed in sixty-one patients in order to close appendiceal stump. The operation time was longer in Group 1 compared to Group 2 (62.0±10.67 min., 56.80±11.94 min., p=0.01). The length of hospital stays were nonsignificant between the groups. Four patients were complicated by superficial surgical site infection in both groups. CONCLUSION In the present study, the operation time was found to be longer for intracorporeal knotting tecnique compared to endoloop tecnique; however, there was no significant difference regarding the length of hospital stay and complications. Performing intracorporeal-knotting technique is suggested since it is cheaper than endoloops and it may also improve hand manipulations of the surgeons who intend to advanced laparoscopy.","Bali, İlhan; Karateke, Faruk; Özyazıcı, Sefa; Kuvvetli, Adnan; Oruç, Cem; Menekşe, Ebru; Emir, Seyfi; Özdoğan, Mehmet",Ulusal travma ve acil cerrahi dergisi = Turkish journal of trauma & emergency surgery : TJTES,74,12

It has been proposed that the newly learned locomotor program may be stored separately from the baseline program. However, how locomotor performance evolves with repeated sessions of walking with the perturbation is not yet known. To address this question, 10 healthy subjects walked on a treadmill on 4 consecutive days. Each day, locomotor performance was measured using kinematics and surface electromyography (EMGs), before, during, and after exposure to a perturbation, produced by an elastic tubing that pulled the foot forward and up during swing, inducing a foot velocity error in the first strides. Initial movement error decreased significantly between days 1 and 2 and then remained stable. Associated changes in medial hamstring EMG activity stabilized only on day 3, however. Aftereffects were present after perturbation removal, suggesting that daily adaptation involved central command recalibration of the baseline program. Aftereffects gradually decreased across days but were still visible on day 4. Separation between the newly learned and baseline programs may take longer than suggested by the daily improvement in initial performance in the perturbing environment or may never be complete. These results therefore suggest that reaching optimal performance in a perturbing environment should not be used as the main indicator of a completed learning process, as central reorganization of the motor commands continues days after initial performance has stabilized.","Blanchette, Andreanne; Moffet, Helene; Roy, Jean-Sébastien; Bouyer, Laurent J",Journal of neurophysiology,74,12

As a self-injected TNF alpha inhibitor, adalimumab has certain advantages over infused medications, including greater patient freedom and autonomy. Experience with adalimumab is not well reported in the literature. OBJECTIVE To report clinical experience with adalimumab in the treatment of central nervous system (CNS) sarcoidosis by combining observations in our center with those that have been reported in the literature. METHODS Patients were identified from the Mass General Brigham Research Patient Data Registry and in the literature by searching PubMed. Patients with CNS manifestations of sarcoidosis treated with adalimumab were included for retrospective review and analyzed for baseline characteristics, treatment indications, outcomes, and adverse effects. RESULTS Adalimumab was commonly started after failure of or intolerance to infliximab and methotrexate. Of those with adequate follow-up, 5/10 ultimately improved, remission was maintained in 3/10, and 2/10 with active disease remained stable without further worsening. One patient suffered a relapse, likely multifactorial in etiology, but has remained relapse free on adalimumab for 10 months subsequently. Three patients ultimately discontinued adalimumab. CONCLUSIONS Preliminary evidence suggests that adalimumab may be a reasonable therapeutic option for patients with neurosarcoidosis affecting the CNS, including those with medically refractory disease.","Hutto, Spencer K; Kyle, Kevin; Cavanagh, Julien J; Reda, Haatem; Venna, Nagagopal",Journal of neurology,74,1

MATERIALS AND METHODS RF ablation was performed at three sites of each liver. RF ablation alone was performed in two animals (control). Ablation was performed after arterial injection of iodized oil (iodized-oil group) or a miriplatin-iodized oil suspension (miriplatin group) in two animals each. Long- and short-axis diameters of the ablative zone were measured. In the miriplatin group, tissue platinum concentrations were measured in the ablative, surrounding hyperemic rim, and nonablative zones. RESULTS The mean long- and short-axis diameters of ablative zones were 27.0 ± 3.1 and 18.0 ± 0.6 mm in the control. Although the long-axis diameter (30.2 ± 2.8 mm, p = 0.07) showed no significant expansion, the short-axis diameter (20.8 ± 2.6 mm, p = 0.04) was significantly expanded more in the iodized-oil group than in the control. Ablative zone sizes were largest in the miriplatin group. The long-axis diameter (33.5 ± 2.4 mm, p = 0.01) was significantly larger than that in the control. The short-axis diameter (27.2 ± 1.9 mm, p = 0.004) was significantly larger than that of the iodized-oil group. Tissue platinum concentrations showed an effective antitumor effect (≥9 μg/g) in ablative (16.5 ± 5.7 μg/g), surrounding hyperemic rim (18.0 ± 5.1 μg/g), and nonablative zones (mean 22.2 ± 5.7 μg/g) (p = 0.21). CONCLUSION Arterial injection of miriplatin-iodized oil suspension can expand the ablative zone size and provide effective tissue platinum concentration on tumor control in the ablative zones and their surrounding hyperemic rim.","Yamanaka, Takashi; Takaki, Haruyuki; Nakatsuka, Atsuhiro; Uchida, Katsunori; Junji, Uraki; Fujimori, Masashi; Hasegawa, Takaaki; Yoneda, Misao; Shiraishi, Taizo; Sakuma, Hajime; Yamakado, Koichiro",Cardiovascular and interventional radiology,74,1

In this study we measure vessel diameters in the cervical and cranial circulation in children to characterize when adult-approved devices might be compatible in children. METHODS For 54 children without vasculopathy (mean age 9.5±4.9 years (range 0.02-17.8), 20F/34M) undergoing catheter angiography, the diameters of the large vessels in the cervical and cranial circulation (10 locations, 611 total measurements) were assessed by three radiologists. Mean±SD diameter was calculated for the following age groups: 0-6 months, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5-9, 10-14, and 15-18 years. To compare with adult sizes, each vessel measurement was normalized to the respective region mean diameter in the oldest age group (15-18 years). Normalized measurements were compared with age and fitted to a segmented regression. RESULTS Vessel diameters increased rapidly from 0 to 5 years of age (slope=0.069/year) but changed minimally beyond that (slope=0.005/year) (R(2)=0.2). The regression model calculated that, at 5 years of age, vessels would be 94% of the diameter of the oldest age group (compared with 59% at birth). In addition, most vessels in children under 5, while smaller, were still potentially large enough to be compatible with many adult devices. CONCLUSIONS The growth curve of the cervicocerebral vasculature displays rapid growth until age 5, at which point most children's vessels are nearly adult size. By age 5, most neuroendovascular devices are size-compatible, including thrombectomy devices for stroke. Under 5 years of age, some devices might still be compatible.","He, Lucy; Ladner, Travis R; Pruthi, Sumit; Day, Matthew A; Desai, Aditi A; Jordan, Lori C; Froehler, Michael T",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,74,16

Recommendations for critical care echocardiography (CCE) have been published recently, but these still lack an evidence-based foundation. It is not known if performing transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) on a routine basis instead of only when required in acute cases is feasible or clinically useful. In this single-centre prospective observational study, we routinely performed TTE on 111 consecutive non-cardiological, non-cardiothoracic surgical ICU patients in two surgical ICUs in a tertiary care facility. Significant cardiac pathologies were detected in 82 (76.6%) and critical cardiac pathologies in 33 (30.8%) of the 107 patients. The most common critical cardiac pathologies were sPAP > 50 mmHg (19.63%), tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion ≤ 13 mm (9.4%), grade III diastolic dysfunction (8.4%), severe tricuspid valve insufficiency (5.6%) and left ventricular ejection fraction (LV-EF) ˂ 30% (4.7%). Some of the most commonly found cardiac pathologies are not well emphasised in current recommendations and training programs. We observed a progression of the cardiac pathologies previously described in 41 of the patients (91.1%). Patients with echocardiographic abnormalities had a significant survival disadvantage in the ICU. By performing CCE routinely, we observed the range and prevalence of cardiac pathologies that can be detected by echocardiography in critically ill patients. We recommend routine transthoracic CCE in ICU patients for early detection of cardiac pathologies and to help inform early intervention regimens, since cardiac conditions carry a significant survival disadvantage for the ICU patient.","Schmidt, Stefan; Dieks, Jana-Katharina; Quintel, Michael; Moerer, Onnen",Diagnostics,74,31

METHODS Families of 73 typically-developing children, 54 children born very preterm (VPT), and 73 children with congenital heart disease (CHD) from two prospective cohort studies were assessed prior to (mean age: 10.4 (SD: 1.2) years) and during (mean age: 12.8 (SD: 2.0) years) the pandemic, more specifically, in April/May 2020. Child well-being and family functioning were assessed with validated, parent-reported questionnaires and tested with linear mixed models. Group comparison of child distress and parental concerns related to medical implications of COVID-19 and homeschooling, assessed with 5-point Likert scales, was done with Mann-Whitney U tests. RESULTS Children's psychological well-being and family functioning (both, P<0.001) decreased significantly during the pandemic, irrespective of group. Children with CHD were reported to be more concerned about becoming infected with SARS-CoV-2 than were others. Child distress due to homeschooling and parents' concerns about children's academic achievements were significantly higher in VPT and CHD children than in typically-developing peers (all P<0.001). CONCLUSION The COVID-19 pandemic substantially impacts the whole family and leads to additional distress in families with children at risk for neurodevelopmental impairments. These families should receive individualized counseling and assistance from health care providers and schools during the pandemic.","Ehrler, Melanie; Werninger, Isabelle; Schnider, Barbara; Eichelberger, Dominique; Naef, Nadja; Disselhoff, Vera; Kretschmar, Oliver; Hagmann, Cornelia; Latal, Beatrice; Wehrle, Flavia M",Acta paediatrica,74,25

The purposes of this study were to test the hypothesis that the FC is a significant factor for aneurysmal recurrence and to provide some insights on appropriate FC selection. METHODS The authors retrospectively reviewed endovascular coiling for 280 unruptured intracranial aneurysms and gathered data on age, sex, aneurysm location, aneurysm morphology, maximal size, neck width, adjunctive techniques, recanalization, retreatment, follow-up periods, total volume packing density (VPD), volume packing density of the FC, and framing coil percentage (FCP; the percentage of FC volume in total coil volume) to clarify the associated factors for aneurysmal recurrence. RESULTS Of 236 aneurysms included in this study, 33 (14.0%) had recanalization, and 18 (7.6%) needed retreatment during a mean follow-up period of 37.7 ± 16.1 months. In multivariate analysis, aneurysm size (odds ratio [OR] = 1.29, p < 0.001), FCP < 32% (OR 3.54, p = 0.009), and VPD < 25% (OR 2.96, p = 0.015) were significantly associated with recanalization, while aneurysm size (OR 1.25, p < 0.001) and FCP < 32% (OR 6.91, p = 0.017) were significant predictors of retreatment. VPD as a continuous value or VPD with any cutoff value could not predict retreatment with statistical significance in multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS FCP, which is equal to the FC volume as a percentage of the total coil volume and is unaffected by the morphology of the aneurysm or the measurement error in aneurysm length, width, or height, is a novel predictor of recanalization and retreatment and is more significantly predictive of retreatment than VPD. To select FCs large enough to meet the condition of FCP ≥ 32% is a potential relevant factor for better long-term outcomes. These findings support our hypothesis that the FC is a significant factor for aneurysmal recurrence.","Ishida, Wataru; Sato, Masayuki; Amano, Tatsuo; Matsumaru, Yuji",Journal of neurosurgery,74,31

Little is known regarding its frequency and phenotype. We examined the frequency of thalamic aphasia following Isolated Acute unilateral ischemic Lesions in the Thalamus (IALT) with respect to lesion location. Furthermore, we characterized thalamic aphasia according to affected language domains and severity. METHODS Fifty-two patients with IALT were analyzed [44% female, median age: 73 years (IQR: 60-79)]. Lesion location was determined using 3-Tesla magnetic resonance imaging and categorized as anterior, posterior, paramedian or inferolateral. Standardized language assessment was performed using the validated Aphasia checklist (ACL) directly after symptom onset. Aphasia was defined as an ACL sum score of < 135 (range: 0-148). RESULTS Of 52 patients, 23 (44%) fulfilled the ACL diagnostic criteria for aphasia, including nearly all lesion locations and both sides. The average ACL sum score was 132 ± 11 (range: 98-147). Aphasia was characterized by deficits within domains of complex understanding of speech and verbal fluency. Patients with left anterior IALT were most severely affected, having significantly lower ACL scores than all other patients (117 ± 13 vs. 135 ± 8; p < 0.001). In particular, aphasia in patients with left anterior IALT was characterized by significantly worse performance in the rating of verbal communication, verbal fluency, and naming (all p ≤ 0.001). CONCLUSION Aphasia occurs in almost half of patients with focal thalamic lesions. Thalamic aphasia is not confined to one predefined thalamic lesion location, but language deficits are particularly pronounced in patients with left anterior IALT presenting with a distinct pattern.","Rangus, Ida; Fritsch, Merve; Endres, Matthias; Udke, Birgit; Nolte, Christian H",Journal of neurology,74,1

Three female pigs (35 kg of BW) were surgically modified with catheters in the hepatic portal vein and carotid artery and an ultrasonic flow probe around the portal vein. Catheter placement and patency was secured using distal modifications (rings and holes) and nonabsorbable suture. Catheters and flow probe cable were tunneled subcutaneously after exteriorization for further protection. Fibrosis and adhesions in the body cavity were minimized by avoiding excessive manipulation and drying of viscera. Pigs were supported during recovery by intravenous fluid therapy of AA and electrolytes until regular feeding resumed. Catheters were flushed daily with heparinized saline (200 IU/L). After 10 d, pigs were fed a diet based on wheat and soybean meal for 6 consecutive 7-d periods. On d 7, blood was collected postprandially every 15 min from -15 to 60 min, 30 to 240 min, 60 to 480 min, and 120 to 720 min. Blood flow was measured simultaneously. Plasma was analyzed for glucose, and net glucose absorption was calculated from plasma portal-arterial differences x plasma flow [blood flow x (1 - hematocrit)]. The specific improvements for long-term use of this model are distal modifications of the catheters, postoperative treatment using parental nutrition and gut motility drug, prevention of infection of body cavity by further tunneling of catheters and blood flow probe cable, and use of ultrasonic blood flow probes and meter. Blood flow measurements using an ultrasonic blood flow probe was not changed after 52 d compared with 10 d post-surgery, indicating the reliability of this model. This catheterized pig model, thus, will allow the long-term study of the kinetics of nutrient absorption.","Hooda, S; Matte, J J; Wilkinson, C W; Zijlstra, R T",Journal of animal science,74,7

OBJECTIVES To determine the optimal contrast medium dose allocation ratio to apply in split-bolus CTU in dogs. METHODS This prospective, experimental, exploratory study used 8 beagles. In 3-phase CTU, unenhanced-, nephrographic-, and excretory-phase images were obtained with a single injection of 600 mg iodine/kg iohexol. In split-bolus CTU, two different contrast medium allocation ratios (30% and 70% for split CTU 1; 50% and 50% for split CTU 2) were used. Unenhanced phase image and a synchronous nephrographic-excretory phase image were acquired. RESULTS Although the attenuation of the renal parenchyma was significantly lower when using both split CTUs than the 3-phase CTU, based on qualitative evaluation, the visualization score of the renal parenchyma of split CTU 1 was as high as that of the 3-phase CTU, whereas the split CTU 2 score was significantly lower than those of the two others. Artifacts were not apparent, regardless of CTU protocol. The diameter and opacification of the ureter in both split CTUs were not significantly different from those using 3-phase CTU. CONCLUSIONS Split-bolus CTU with a contrast medium allocation ratio of 30% and 70% is feasible for evaluating the urinary system and allows sufficient enhancement of the renal parenchyma and appropriate distention and opacification of the ureter, with similar image quality to 3-phase CTU in healthy dogs. Split-bolus CTU has the advantages of reducing radiation exposure and the number of CT images needed for interpretation.","Je, Hyejin; Lee, Sang Kwon; Jung, Jin Woo; Jang, Youjung; Chhoey, Saran; Choi, Jihye",Journal of veterinary science,74,1

However, the frequency varied depending on definition and measures used to capture skills. Retrospective parent report and prospective observation indicate loss of language and/or social skills, with motor skills typically unaffected. Our aim was to update the prevalence and age of onset of autistic regression through a meta-analysis of the literature to understand if there have been changes to the reported onset and prevalence since 2010. A systematic literature search was conducted using Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, and the Cochrane Library databases and included studies published from 2010 onward. Risk of bias assessment was performed on included studies. A random effects model was used to calculate the pooled prevalence and age of onset of autistic regression. Ninety-seven studies were included in the systematic review, of which 75 studies involving 33,014 participants had sufficient data for meta-analytic syntheses. The pooled proportion of autistic regression was 30% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 27-32%) but heterogeneity was high (I2 = 96.91) and did not reduce with sensitivity or subgroup analyses based on study design or clinical differences, respectively. Prevalence varied according to risk of bias (low: 27%) and definition of regression (language: 20%, language/social: 40%, mixed: 30%, and unspecified: 27%). Weighted average age of onset was 19.8 months. Findings from this meta-analysis highlight the importance of developing a standardized definition of autistic regression, and tools to measure this at multiple time points during early childhood development. LAY SUMMARY: About a third of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder experience loss of skills, which is also known as autistic regression. This paper provides an update of the rate of autistic regression in children and the age when they first experience loss of skills, based on current studies. The findings from this review contribute to our understanding of the onset patterns of autistic regression. Unfortunately, studies are not sufficiently similar, making it difficult to provide clear answers on the exact timing or type of regression seen in different children.","Tan, Christine; Frewer, Veronica; Cox, Georgina; Williams, Katrina; Ure, Alexandra",Autism research : official journal of the International Society for Autism Research,74,24

In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying the protective effect of baicalein against cardiac hypertrophy in vivo and in vitro. Cardiac hypertrophy was induced in mice by injection of isoproterenol (ISO, 30 mg·kg-1·d-1) for 15 days. The mice received caudal vein injection of baicalein (25 mg/kg) on 3rd, 6th, 9th, 12th, and 15th days. We showed that baicalein administration significantly attenuated ISO-induced cardiac hypertrophy and restored cardiac function. The protective effect of baicalein against cardiac hypertrophy was also observed in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes treated with ISO (10 μM). In cardiomyocytes, ISO treatment markedly increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) and inhibited autophagy, which were greatly alleviated by pretreatment with baicalein (30 μM). We found that baicalein pretreatment increased the expression of catalase and the mitophagy receptor FUN14 domain containing 1 (FUNDC1) to clear ROS and promote autophagy, thus attenuated ISO-induced cardiac hypertrophy. Furthermore, we revealed that baicalein bound to the transcription factor FOXO3a directly, promoting its transcription activity, and transactivated catalase and FUNDC1. In summary, our data provide new evidence for baicalein and FOXO3a in the regulation of ISO-induced cardiac hypertrophy. Baicalein has great potential for the treatment of cardiac hypertrophy.","Liu, Bing-Yan; Li, Ling; Liu, Gao-Li; Ding, Wei; Chang, Wen-Guang; Xu, Tao; Ji, Xiao-Yu; Zheng, Xian-Xin; Zhang, Jing; Wang, Jian-Xun",Acta pharmacologica Sinica,74,1

Accordingly, an investigation was performed to analyze the infectivity of PERVs from porcine keratocytes to human cells, and the long-term risk of transmission of PERVs was determined using pig-to-non-human primate (NHP) corneal transplantation models. METHODS The infectivity of PERVs from the SNU miniature pig keratocytes was investigated by coculture with a human embryonic kidney cell line. Twenty-two rhesus macaques underwent xenocorneal transplantation as follows: (i) group 1 (n=4): anterior lamellar keratoplasty (LKP) with freshly preserved porcine corneas, (ii) group 2 (n=5): anterior LKP with decellularized porcine corneas followed by penetrating keratoplasty (PKP) with allografts, (iii) group 3 (n=3): PKP under steroid-based immunosuppression, (iv) group 4 (n=4): PKP under anti-CD154 antibody-based immunosuppression, (v) group 5 (n=4): deep anterior LKP with freshly preserved porcine corneas under anti-CD40 antibody-based immunosuppression, and (vi) group 6 (n=2): PKP under anti-CD40 antibody-based immunosuppression. Postoperative blood samples were serially collected, and tissue samples were obtained from thirteen different organs at the end of each experiment. The existence of PERV DNA and RNA was investigated using PCR and RT-PCR. RESULTS Using two independent in vitro infectivity tests, neither PERV pol nor pig mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase II was detected after 41 and 92 days of coculture, respectively. After xenocorneal transplantation, a total of 257 serial peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples, 34 serial plasma samples, and 282 tissue samples were obtained from the NHP recipients up to 1176 days post-transplantation. No PERV transmission was evident in any samples. CONCLUSIONS Within the limits of this study, there is no evidence to support any risk of PERV transmission from porcine corneal tissues to NHP recipients, despite the existence of PERV-expressing cells in porcine corneas.","Choi, Hyuk Jin; Kim, Jiyeon; Kim, Jae Young; Lee, Hyun Ju; Wee, Won Ryang; Kim, Mee Kum; Hwang, Eung Soo",Xenotransplantation,74,1

In more recent years, increasing interest in the use of local therapy for metastases likely has arisen from improvements in systemic therapy. In the absence of effective systemic therapies, such local treatments were often considered futile given both the difficulty in eliminating all sites of identifiable metastatic disease as well as realities regarding the rapid natural history of uncontrolled tumor dissemination. However, with a higher likelihood of patients surviving longer after effective systemic therapy, even if not cured, the goal of the eradication of residual metastases via potent local therapies can be rationalized. However, this rationalization should be evidence-based so as to avoid harming patients for no established benefit. Although surgical metastectomy remains the most common and first-line standard among local therapies, nonsurgical alternatives, including thermal ablation and stereotactic body radiotherapy, have become increasingly popular because they are generally less invasive than surgery and have demonstrated considerable promise in eradicating macroscopic tumor. Rather than eliminating the need for local therapies, improvements in systemic therapies appear to be increasing the prudent utilization of modern local therapies in patients presenting with more advanced cancer.","Timmerman, Robert D; Bizekis, Costas S; Pass, Harvey I; Fong, Yuman; Dupuy, Damian E; Dawson, Laura A; Lu, David",CA: a cancer journal for clinicians,74,20

While these nodes are routinely resected by Japanese teams, neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy alone is performed in Western countries. We aimed to systematically report the current literature assessing the overall and disease-free survivals of patients with rectal cancer treated with total mesorectal resection (TME) with or without lateral lymph node dissection (LLND). METHODS MEDLINE/Pubmed, Embase, Cochrane, and Web of Science were searched from database implementation until 19 January 2019. Studies reporting overall survival or recurrence-free survival in patients with LLND for rectal cancer were included. We excluded studies including patients with recurrent rectal cancer, multivisceral resection, and/or without control group (patients with rectal surgery without LLND). RESULTS Eleven studies were included, accounting for a total of 4159 patients. Overall survival ranged between 55.6 and 92.6% for TME with LLND versus 49.2 and 90.2% for TME alone, with one study reporting statistically significant benefit of LLND. Recurrence-free survival ranged between 58.3 and 74.1% for TME with LLND versus 39.5 and 76.5% for TME alone. Two studies showed statistically significant differences between the two strategies, one randomized controlled trial showed improved recurrence-free survival in TME alone group (74.5% versus 74.1% with LLND at 5 years) and one observational retrospective study reported increased recurrence-free survival with more extensive resection (65.4% versus 39.5% without LLND, at 5 years). CONCLUSION Benefits of LLND are not clear and further randomized controlled trials should be performed to determine which strategy would allow improving survival in rectal cancer patients.

Methods A prospective observational study of patients with COVID-19 diagnosis by positive PCR considered high-risk tracked with telemedicine and telemonitoring was conducted in the sanitary area of Lugo between March 17th and April 17th, 2020. Two groups of patients were included: Outpatient Tracing from the beginning and after discharge. Every patient sent a daily clinical questionnaire with temperature and oxygen saturation 3 times a day. Proactive monitoring was done by getting in touch with every patient at least 11 a day. Results 313 patients (52.4% female) with a total average age of 60.9 (DE 15.9) years were included. Additionally, 2 patients refused to join the program. Since the beginning, 224 were traced outpatient and 89 after being discharged. Among the first category, 38 (16.90%) were referred to Emergency department on 43 occasions; 18 were hospitalized (8.03%), and 2 deceased. Neither deaths nor a matter of vital emergency occurred at home. When including patients after admissions monitoring was done in 304 cases. One patient re-entered (0.32%) to the hospital, and another one left the program (0.32%). The average time of monitoring was 11.64 (SD 3.58) days, and 224 (73.68%) patients were discharged during the 30 days of study. Conclusions Our study suggests that telemedicine with home telemonitoring, used proactively, allows for monitoring high-risk patients with COVID-19 in a clinically useful and secure way.","Martínez-García, M; Bal-Alvarado, M; Santos Guerra, F; Ares-Rico, R; Suárez-Gil, R; Rodríguez-Álvarez, A; Pérez-López, A; Casariego-Vales, E",Revista clinica espanola,74,24

METHODS Five ICU ventilators (PB840, PB980, Servo-i, V500, and Avea) were compared in available invasive ventilation and NIV ventilator modes (pressure control continuous spontaneous ventilation [PC-CSV] and pressure control continuous mandatory ventilation [PC-CMV]). The V500 and Avea do not provide PC-CSV and PC-CMV in NIV. The Servo-i and Avea were tested with and without their proximal flow sensor. The ASL 5000 lung model (version 3.5) was used to simulate 4 neonatal scenarios (body weight 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 kg). The ASL 5000 was ventilated via endotracheal tube (invasive ventilation) or nasal cannula (NIV) with 4 different leaks. RESULTS The Avea (without flow sensor) during invasive ventilation and Servo-i and PB840 during NIV were not triggered by inspiratory efforts of the ASL 5000 at the baseline leak in the 0.5 kg scenario. In invasive ventilation, overall (median) asynchrony index was significantly lower with the PB980 (1%) and V500 (3%) than with the Servo-i (with flow sensor, 50%; without flow sensor, 50%) and Avea (with sensor, 50%; without sensor, 62%) (P < .05 for all comparisons). The PB840 (33%) was significantly different from all ventilators (P < .05). In NIV, the asynchrony index was significantly lower in PB980 (2%) than in the Servo-i (with sensor, 100%; without sensor, 100%) and PB840 (75%) (P < .05 for both). There was no difference in asynchrony index between PC-CSV and PC-CMV in all tested conditions and ventilators. CONCLUSIONS The ability of leak compensation to prevent asynchronous breathing varied widely between ventilators and lung mechanics. The PB980 and V500 were the only two ventilators to acclimate to all leak scenarios in invasive ventilation, and PB980 was the only ventilator to acclimate to all leak scenarios in NIV.","Itagaki, Taiga; Chenelle, Christopher T; Bennett, Desmond J; Fisher, Daniel F; Kacmarek, Robert M",Respiratory care,74,24

The receptor binding domain (RBD) of the surface-exposed spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 represents a suitable target for the induction of neutralizing antibodies upon vaccination. Small protein antigens typically induce weak immune response while particles measuring tens of nanometers are efficiently presented to B cell follicles and subsequently to follicular germinal center B cells in draining lymph nodes, where B cell proliferation and affinity maturation occurs. Here we prepared and analyzed the response to several DNA vaccines based on genetic fusions of RBD to four different scaffolding domains, namely to the foldon peptide, ferritin, lumazine synthase and {beta}-annulus peptide, presenting from 6 to 60 copies of the RBD on each particle. Scaffolding strongly augmented the immune response with production of neutralizing antibodies and T cell response including cytotoxic lymphocytes in mice upon immunization with DNA plasmids. The most potent response was observed for the 24-residue {beta}-annulus peptide scaffold that forms large soluble assemblies, that has the advantage of low immunogenicity in comparison to larger scaffolds.

Medical students who were attached to the EDs had their clinical training affected. Methods: We surveyed teaching faculty in a tertiary teaching hospital in Singapore to assess if they would consider delivering clinical teaching to medical students during the outbreak and conducted a thematic analysis of their responses. Results: 53.6% felt that medical students should not undergo clinical teaching in the ED and 60.7% did not wish to teach medical students during the outbreak. Three themes arose during the analysis of the data - Cognitive Overload of Clinical Teachers, Prioritisation of Clinical Staff Welfare versus Medical Students, and Risk of Viral Exposure versus Clinical Education. Conclusion: During a pandemic, a balance needs to be sought between clinical service and education, and faculty attitudes towards teaching in high-risk environments can shift their priorities in favour of providing the former over the latter.

OBJECTIVE We measure life course complexity from a period perspective and decompose the results according to age and transition type. METHODS Complexity is measured as the number of distinct states visited (NDS) and the average number of visits to each visited state (ANV). Measures are based on sequences taken from different cohorts from a similar age onward, until a common period of interest. Period complexity is the sum of the cohort-specific differences in complexity reached at the beginning and at the end of the period of interest, summed through years of age. RESULTS Analyzing life courses of Dutch women born 1977-2000, we find decreases in NDS and increases in ANV from both perspectives. Changes are explained by a decrease in transitions to being married and an increase in returns to the parental home and living alone. CONCLUSIONS A woman who would experience the complexity of the years 2017-2018 throughout her life course would visit fewer distinct states and return more often to the same states than any average woman born between 1977-1978 and 1987-1988 actually did. This means that life courses might continue to become less linear in the future and that some of the parts that constitute them might continue to become more often omitted. CONTRIBUTION Our approach allows us to analyze holistically the influence of temporary circumstances on life course complexity, which might prove useful in assessing the impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on the transition to adulthood.","Boissonneault, M.",Demographic Research,74,1

The purpose of the research study described in this article was to identify the sources and kinds of disruptions observed in various maritime supply chains as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and their impact on the operations of various types of seaport terminals, namely those serving bulk (universal, specialised) and general cargoes (universal, specialised). An additional purpose was to identify the dependencies between the type of terminal and its main function, and the tactical decisions adopted by the particular terminals. The research was carried out using the multiple-case study method. The study covered some selected port terminals functioning in Polish seaports (Gdańsk, Szczecin, Świnoujście), applying direct, semi-structured in-depth interviews. The analysis of the results was carried out using the inductive reasoning method. The research study has shown that as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic some maritime supply chains ceased to exist, some of them were operating with decreased cargo volumes, while in other cases the transshipment volumes actually rose during the pandemic. Among terminal operators’ tactical responses to disruptions in maritime supply chains, there were pro-active and adaptive measures. Pro-active (offensive) measures included actions taken by an enterprise in order to engage in new maritime supply chains, and even participating in establishing new maritime chains in response to limitations caused by the pandemic. Adaptive (defensive) measures covered actions taken by the port terminals as a consequence of changes in the existing maritime supply chains, caused by the pandemic in the port’s foreland or hinterland. The research study results revealed that the terminals extent of engagement and tactical decisions related to the pandemic were depended on the type of terminal (universal or specialised) and its main function played within a supply chain.","Mańkowska, Marta Pluciński Michał Kotowska Izabela Filina-Dawidowicz Ludmiła",Energies,74,1

However, at the virus-host interface, additional biomolecular interactions, although being relatively weak in affinity and low in specificity, could also contribute to viral attachment and play important roles in gain- or loss-of-function mutations. In this work, we performed a peptide scanning of the S1 domains of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 by synthesizing 972 16-mer native and mutated peptide fragments using a high throughput in situ array synthesis technology. By probing the array using fluorescently labelled ACE2, a number of previously unknown potential receptor binding sites of S1 have been revealed. 20 peptides were synthesized using solid phase peptide synthesis, in order to validate and quantify their binding to ACE2. Four ACE2-binding peptides were selected, to investigate whether they can be assembled through a biotinylated peptide/neutravidin system to achieve high affinity to ACE2.

However, this is not always accounted for explicitly in mathematical models used for forecasting during influenza outbreaks. We show that, if an influenza outbreak is due to a strain that is similar to one that has emerged previously, then accounting for cross-immunity explicitly can improve the accuracy of real-time forecasts. To do this, we consider two infectious disease outbreak forecasting models. In the first (the ``1-group model''), all individuals are assumed to be identical and partial cross-immunity is not accounted for. In the second (the ``2-group model''), individuals who have previously been infected by a related strain are assumed to be less likely to experience severe disease, and therefore recover more quickly than immunologically naive individuals. We fit both models to case notification data from Japan during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, and then generate synthetic data for a future outbreak by assuming that the 2-group model represents the epidemiology of influenza infections more accurately. We use the 1-group model (as well as the 2-group model for comparison) to generate forecasts that would be obtained in real-time as the future outbreak is ongoing, using parameter values estimated from the 2009 epidemic as informative priors, motivated by the fact that without using prior information from 2009, the forecasts are highly uncertain.In the scenario that we consider, the 1-group model only produces accurate outbreak forecasts once the peak of the epidemic has passed, even when the values of important epidemiological parameters such as the lengths of the mean incubation and infectious periods are known exactly. As a result, it is necessary to use the more epidemiologically realistic 2-group model to generate accurate forecasts.Accounting for partial cross-immunity driven by exposures in previous outbreaks explicitly is expected to improve the accuracy of epidemiological modelling forecasts during influenza outbreaks.","Sachak-Patwa, R.; Byrne, H.

These isolates harbor a mutation in rpoC, and do not fulfill, either the Modern Beijing lineage criteria (L2.2.1.2.2) or the other currently known Ancestral Beijing lineages described so far. Asia Ancestral 5 isolates do not possess mutT2 58 and ogt 12 characteristics of Modern Beijing, but possess ancient evolutionary characteristics. By looking into the literature, we found in a reference isolate ID381, found in Kobe and Osaka, and defined as G3, 36 out of 42 shared and specific SNPs in the same sublineage. Using this study, we also confirmed the intermediate position of the Asia Ancestral 4 recently described in Thailand and suggest an improved classification of the L2 that now includes Asia Ancestral 4 and 5. Increasing the recruitment to around 3000 genomes (including 642 belonging to L2) confirmed our results and suggest new historical ancestral L2 phylogenetically relevant branches that remain to be investigated in detail. We discuss some anthropological and historical data from Japan history and its link to Korea and China. This study shows that the reconstruction of the early history of tuberculosis pandemia in Asia is likely to reveal complex patterns since its emergence.","Guyeux, C.; Senelle, G.; Refregier, G.; Cambau, E.; Sola, C.",,74,5

To improve the disinfection efficiency and reduce the disinfection risky, in this paper, the intelligent robot collaborative disinfection problem is constructed as a Distributed constrained optimization problem, in which each intelligent disinfection robot is modeled as an Agent and the constraint graph is constructed based on the actual application scenario to optimize the comprehensive benefits of energy consumption and machine wear of disinfection robots in the collaborative working process. The Proposed Distributed constrained optimization problem model is solved by the state-of-the-art algorithms DSA, MGM, Max-Sum and RM. Based on our extensive empirical evaluations, we experimentally show that the constructed Distributed constrained optimization problem model for intelligent robot collaborative disinfection can effectively plan the optimal collaborative robot patterns for identified disinfection scenarios as well as recommend the optimum parameters for each disinfection robot. © 2021 IEEE.","Shi, M.; Yang, H.; Liao, X.; Chen, Y.; Xiao, S.; Wu, J.","2021 IEEE International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Computer Applications, ICAICA 2021",74,1

Therefore, they gain much attention as potentially therapeutic and non-invasive diagnostic targets. In this aspect, a comprehensive characterization of the EVs molecular content and understanding EVs functions are especially relevant. However, routine isolation of a usually small amount of high purity EVs is challenging, and analysis requires highly sensitive advanced analytical solutions.

We report about a patient who underwent ABO-incompatible kidney transplantation following coronavirus disease (COVID-19) without a recurrence of infection. Case report A 68-year-old woman presented with end-stage renal failure due to primary autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease; accordingly, hemodialysis was initiated in September 2020. Her medical history included bilateral osteoarthritis, lumbar spinal stenosis, hypertension, and hyperuricemia. In mid-January 2021, she contracted severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection from her husband. Both of them were hospitalized and received conservative treatment. Since their symptoms were mild, they were discharged after 10 days. The patient subsequently underwent ABO-incompatible kidney transplantation from her husband who recovered from COVID-19 in March 2021. Before kidney transplantation, her COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction test was negative, confirming the absence of pre-existing COVID-19 immediately before the procedure. Computed tomography revealed no pneumonia. Initial immunosuppression was induced by administering tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, methylprednisolone, basiliximab, rituximab, and 30 g intravenous immunoglobulin. Double-filtration plasmapheresis and plasma exchange were performed once before ABO-incompatible kidney transplantation. The renal allograft functioned immediately, and the postoperative course was normal without rejection. COVID-19 did not recur. In addition, her serum creatinine levels and renal function had otherwise remained stable. Conclusion Living kidney transplantation was safely performed in a patient with COVID-19 without postoperative complications or rejection. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 infection during transplantation surgery must be considered.","Kijima, Yu; Shimizu, Tomokazu; Sekido, Eri; Kato, Shinya; Kano, Kana; Toguchi, Makoto; Horiuchi, Toshihide; Nozaki, Taiji; Omoto, Kazuya; Inui, Masashi; Toma, Hiroshi; Iida, Shoichi; Takagi, Toshio",,74,9

Scientific research in medicine is the only means to overcome novel and complex diseases like COVID-19. To sum up the therapeutic wild-goose chase, many available antivirals and repurposed drugs have failed to show successful clinical evidence in patient recovery, several vaccine candidates are still waiting in the trial pipelines and a few have become available to the common public for administration in record time. However, with upcoming evidence of coronavirus mutations, available vaccines may thrive on the spirit of doubt about efficacy and effectiveness towards these new strains of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV2). In all these collective uncertainties, plasma therapy has shown a ray of hope for critically ill patients. To date, with very few published case studies of convalescent plasma in COVID-19, there are two school of thought process in the scientific community regarding plasma therapy efficiency and this leads to confusion due to the lack of optimal randomized and controlled studies. Without undertaking any robust scientific studies, evidence or caution, accepting any therapy unanimously may cause more harm than good, but with a clearer understanding of SARS-CoV2 immunopathology and drug response, plasma therapy might be the silver lining against COVID-19 for the global community.

The main reason for this is the still limited availability of existing automated phenotyping tools and facilities. Additionally, constructing a custom-made automated solution is a daunting task for most research groups specializing in biology. Here, we describe SPIRO, the Smart Plate Imaging Robot, an automated platform that acquires time-lapse photos of up to four vertically oriented Petri plates in a single experiment. SPIRO was designed for biologists by biologists; thus, its assembly does not require experience in engineering or programming and its operation is sufficiently intuitive to be carried out without training. SPIRO has a small footprint optimal for fitting into standard incubators for plants and microbes, and is equipped with an LED light source for imaging in the dark, thus allowing acquisition of photos under optimal growth conditions. SPIRO’s web-based user interface allows setting up experiments and downloading data remotely, without interfering with samples growth. SPIRO’s excellent image quality is optimal for automated image processing, which we demonstrate with two semi-automated assays for analysis of commonly used phenotypic traits: seed germination and root growth. Moreover, the robot can be easily customized for a specific use, as all information about SPIRO, including the models for 3D-printed structural components, control software, and scripts for image analysis, are released under permissive open-source licenses.","Ohlsson, Jonas A; Leong, Jia Xuan; Elander, Pernilla H; Dauphinee, Adrian N; Ballhaus, Florentine; Johansson, Johan; Lommel, Mark; Hofmann, Gero; Betnér, Staffan; Sandgren, Mats; Schumacher, Karin; Bozhkov, Peter V; Minina, Elena A",bioRxiv,74,1

The beyond-Newtonian potential is developed by using the Fodor-Hoenselaers-Perj\'es procedure. An expansion in the Kerr potential is performed and terms up-to the first non-Newtonian contribution of both the mass and spin effects are included. With this potential, a model for a test particle of infinitesimal mass orbiting in the equatorial plane of the two primaries is examined. The introduction of a parameter, $\epsilon$, allows examination of the system as it transitions from the Newtonian to the beyond-Newtonian regime. The evolution and stability of the fixed points of the system as a function of the parameter $\epsilon$ is also studied. The dynamics of the particle is studied using the Poincar\'e map of section and the Maximal Lyapunov Exponent as indicators of chaos. Intermediate values of $\epsilon$ seem to be the most chaotic for the two cases of primary mass-ratios ($=0.001,0.5$) examined. The amount of chaos in the system remains higher than the Newtonian system as well as for the planar circular restricted three-body problem with Schwarzschild-like primaries for all non-zero values of $\epsilon$.","De, Shounak; Roychowdhury, Suparna; Banerjee, Roopkatha",,74,31

This study builds upon previous literature that has analyzed the trends in opioid distribution and assesses changes in opioid prescription preferences. Methods The amount of fentanyl base distributed in the US from 2010-2019 was obtained from the Drug Enforcement Administrations Automated Reports and Consolidated Ordering System (ARCOS). Fentanyl derivatives (sufentanil, alfentanil, remifentanil) were also analyzed using ARCOS from 2010-2017, the most recent date reported. Census data from the American Community Survey was used to correct for population. Prescriptions, units, and reimbursement of fentanyl and fentanyl citrate formulations for 2010 and 2019 were obtained from Medicaid and prescriber specialty in Medicare Part D. Results Total grams of fentanyl distributed in the US from 2010 to 2019 decreased by 63%. Correspondingly, there was a 65% decrease in the milligrams per person distributed when correcting for population. From a regional perspective, Ohio had the greatest decrease (-79.3%) while Mississippi saw the smallest (-44.5%). Medicaid reimbursement in 2019 was $165 million for over eight hundred-thousand prescriptions with the majority to generic (99.7%) and injectable (77.6%) formulations. Interventional pain management and anesthesia were over-represented, and hematology/oncology under-represented for fentanyl in Medicare. Conclusion The production and distribution of fentanyl-based substances has decreased, although not uniformly, in the US over the last decade. Additionally, the most prescribed formulations of fentanyl have transitioned away from transdermal, potentially in an effort to regulate its availability. Although impactful, the overdose deaths attributed to synthetic opioid deaths continue to increase highlighting the need for public health interventions beyond the pharmaceutical and medical communities.","Stemrich, R.

Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital (MTRH) is the only tertiary referral hospital in western Kenya and serves a population of 25 million people, including 10 million children. The average number of pediatric cancer diagnoses was 216 cases annually in 2017-2019, well below the anticipated 1500 cases based on cancer epidemiology data. We recently completed a comprehensive Needs Assessment suggesting that due to inadequate pediatric oncology education, many clinical diagnoses are missed and correct diagnostic tests are not obtained at county hospitals. Local medical staff expressed interest in educational programs to help augment their understanding and diagnostic evaluation of pediatric oncology. Methods: To address these disparities in medical knowledge, we implemented Project ECHO - a validated virtual guided practice and telementoring model - to connect multidisciplinary specialists at MTRH with staff in medically underserved communities in western Kenya for ongoing training, technical assistance, and mentorship. The ECHO program follows a Hub-and-Spoke design where the specialists at MTRH and pediatric oncologists at Riley Hospital functioned as the 'hub' team and the health care workers at county hospitals were the 'spokes'. Sessions were freely available on Zoom twice monthly and featured both a didactic topic presented by experts and a spoke-led case-based discussion. The discussion utilized dialogue education to promote learning and engagement among the spokes with mentorship from the hub team. Results: The ECHO program launched successfully in January 2020 with a curriculum focused on pediatric oncology for general health care workers. A total of 22 sessions occurred with an average of 23 learners (primarily staff at community hospitals within the referral region) per session. Despite the COVID-19 pandemic, the year-end analysis in January 2021 demonstrated 286 new pediatric patients were diagnosed with cancer at MTRH representing a 33% increase over the 3-year average. Conclusions: The implementation of a telehealth education platform - Project ECHO - focused on diagnosing pediatric cancer in medically underserved communities in Kenya, is a useful model to increase the recognition and earlier referral of childhood cancer in LMICs.","Severance, T.; Olbara, G.

However, even the improper wearing of a facemask can obstruct the goal and lead to the spread of the virus. Therefore, to ensure public safety, a system for monitoring facemasks on faces, commonly known as a facemask detection algorithm, is essential for overcoming this crisis. The facemask detection algorithms are part of the object detection algorithms which are used to detect objects in an image. Among the various object detection algorithms, deep learning showed tremendous performance in facemask detection for its excellent feature extraction capability than the traditional machine learning algorithms. However, there remains a lot of scope for future research to build an efficient facemask detection system. Therefore, this study aims to draw attention to the researchers by providing a narrative and meta-analytic review on all the published works related to facemask detection in the context of Covid-19. Because facemask detection algorithms are run mainly by adopting object detection algorithms, this paper also explores the progress of object detection algorithms over the last few decades. A comprehensive analysis of different datasets used in facemask detection techniques by many studies has been explored. The performance comparison among these algorithms is discussed in narrative and meta-analytic approaches. Finally, this study concludes with a discussion of some of the major challenges and future scope in the related field.","Nowrin, A.; Afroz, S.; Rahman, M. S.; Mahmud, I.; Cho, Y.

COVID-19 is a new disease that is under study and affects people over 65 with the greatest severity worldwide. The most frequent psychiatric symptoms are behavioral disturbances and confusional syndrome among those affected.ObjectivesThe objective is to demonstrate the importance of differential diagnosis in patients with psychiatric symptoms and covid-19.MethodsPatients aged 71 and 77, admitted to psychiatry. They present drowsiness that alternates with episodes of psychomotor agitation in which they verbalize fear of the coronavirus. Personal history: bipolar disorder and schizoaffective disorder. Psychopathological exploration: Spatial-temporal disorientation, uncooperative, fluctuating state of consciousness, verborrheic, salty and incoherent speech at times. Dysphoric mood. Psychomotor restlessness predominantly at night, verbal heteroaggressiveness. Negative to ingestion due to odynophagia. Sensory-perceptual alterations and nihilistic delusions “the virus has killed me, I’m already dead.” Upon admission, they present a cough and fever and are treated with azithromycin and dexamethasone for suspected COVID-19. Complementary tests: chest X-ray bilateral pleural effusion. Cranial CT: Diffuse cortical and subcortical brain parenchyma retraction pattern. PCR positive coronavirus.ResultsAfter overcoming the infection and with psychopharmacological treatment the confusional syndrome remitted.ConclusionsConfusional syndrome can present with different psychiatric symptoms, so the differential diagnosis is very important and even more so in patients older than 65 years who present somatic pathologies or acute infections. The differential diagnosis of confusional syndrome is key to adequate treatment and favor the prognosis.","Barea, M. ValverDe Solis M. O.; Rodriguez, L. Soldado Osuna A.

In some application domains, e.g., energy, environment and health monitoring, it occurs that the target variable is numerical and the problem is known as time series extrinsic regression (TSER). In the literature, some well-known time series classifiers have been extended for TSER problems. As first benchmarking studies have focused on predictive performance, very little attention has been given to interpretability. To fill this gap, in this paper, we suggest an extension of a Bayesian method for robust and interpretable feature construction and selection in the context of TSER. Our approach exploits a relational way to tackle with TSER: (i), we build various and simple representations of the time series which are stored in a relational data scheme, then, (ii), a propositionalisation technique (based on classical aggregation / selection functions from the relational data field) is applied to build interpretable features from secondary tables to""flatten""the data; and (iii), the constructed features are filtered out through a Bayesian Maximum A Posteriori approach. The resulting transformed data can be processed with various existing regressors. Experimental validation on various benchmark data sets demonstrates the benefits of the suggested approach.","Gay, Dominique; Bondu, Alexis; Lemaire, Vincent; Boull'e, Marc",,74,12

This is also observed in the small country of Brunei. As one of the few countries that have successfully mitigated COVID-19 transmissions, Brunei is slowly rebuilding its tourism industry through its community-based tourism (CBT). Following Sharma et al.’s resilience-based framework for reviving the tourism industry post‑COVID-19 established in 2021, this study incorporates responses from semi-structured interviews with 16 local CBT owners on the challenges, the management, and the CBT initiatives during the height of the pandemic until today. These initiatives include diversifying more tour packages and utilising local resources and products. Despite the lockdown imposed by the government, which suspended businesses and restricted all travelling, local CBT operations flourished, generated more income for the owners, and created job opportunities for the community. Such efforts have caused the public to appreciate local cultures, the environment, and ultimately increase CBT experiences in the country. While shedding light on Brunei’s unique management of its tourism industry during the pandemic, this paper also demonstrates theoretical and conceptual contributions to the recent literature of resilient and transformational tourism and provide suggestions on how to manage CBT operations during these challenging times.","Noorashid, Najib Chin Wei Lee",Sustainability,74,10

The virus has been rapidly spread worldwide due to the outbreak. COVID-19 is the third serious coronavirus outbreak in less than 20 years after Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003 and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in 2012. The novel virus has a nucleotide identity closer to that of the SARS coronavirus than that of the MERS coronavirus. Since there is still no vaccine, the main ways to improve personal immunity against this disease are prophylactic care and self-resistance including an increased personal hygiene, a healthy lifestyle, an adequate nutritional intake, a sufficient rest, and wearing medical masks and increasing time spent in well ventilated areas. There is a need for novel antivirals that are highly efficient and economical for the management and control of viral infections when vaccines and standard therapies are absent.

The task of improving the characteristics of pulp has become particularly acute in connection with the COVID-19 epidemic: the demand for disposable nonwoven materials in direct contact with the human skin has increased several times over. The elemental chlorine free (ECF) sulfate pulp bleaching process, which uses chlorine dioxide as a bleaching agent, dominates bleached pulp production worldwide. The chlorine-containing compounds formed as a result of bleaching pollute not only waste water, but also the product itself. In the near future, it is expected that paper products made with chlorine-based bleaches may be banned for the production of sanitary tissue products and food packaging. If the products of the pulp and paper industry do not meet international consumer requirements, the pulp market for these purposes may face undesirable results. The most promising direction of modernization the existing bleaching schemes, both in terms of the process consumption parameters and the quality of the produced pulp, is the use of oxygen-alkaline bleaching in the first stage. Determination of total and organically bound chlorine content in pulp materials in accordance with ISO 11480:2017 on the advanced plant has shown, that the introduction of bleaching schemes using oxygen-alkaline agents will ensure the recommended content of chlorine compounds while maintaining the necessary characteristics of pulp for the manufacture of medical and sanitary tissue products, food packaging. However, high quality of finished products that meet consumers' requirements is possible only if the chlorine content is controlled at all stages of pulp production, since the quantitative indicators of this substance content remain close to the upper allowable limit.","Sofronova, E.

The fund would focus its resources on civil society organizations, supporting their advocacy and strengthening mechanisms for accountability and participation. We propose an initial annual target of US$500 million for the fund, adjusted based on needs assessments.

National Institute for Health and Care Excellence referral guidelines highlight features that may suggest colorectal cancer (CRC) including rectal bleeding, palpable mass, iron deficiency anaemia, but also non-specific symptoms such as weight loss. In those patients referred for investigation on the basis of symptoms alone the yield of CRC is low (2-3%). Faecal immunochemical tests (FIT) quantify faecal haemoglobin (f-Hb) and are widely used in bowel screening programmes. A number of groups have now studied the utility of FIT in patients attending primary care with new bowel symptoms. Studies have concluded that if the FIT is negative and clinical assessment and full blood count normal then the risk of underlying significant bowel disease (SBD) is extremely small. Furthermore, patients with f-Hb ≥400 μgHb/g faeces have >50% risk of SBD and should be investigated urgently.

Here we show that such models can be derived from an integrated-scale analysis generated from three different types of functional relationship: Wells-Riley mathematical model, competing-risks model, and Von Foerster equation, both of the key epidemiological determinants involved and of the functional connections between them. We examine mathematically the impact of engineering control measures such as enhanced air exchange and air filtration rates with personal masking combined with public health interventions such as vaccination, isolation, and contact tracing in containing the spread of indoor airborne infections including influenza, chickenpox, measles, and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). If enhanced engineering controls could reduce the basic reproductive number (R0) below 1.60 for chickenpox and 3 for measles, our simulations show that in such a prepared response with public health interventions would have a high probability of containing the indoor airborne infections. Combinations of engineering control measures and public health interventions could moderately contain influenza strains with an R0 as high as 4. Our analysis indicates that effective isolation of symptomatic patients with low-efficacy contact tracing is sufficient to control a SARS outbreak. We suggest that a valuable added dimension to public health inventions could be provided by systematically quantifying transmissibility and proportion of asymptomatic infection of indoor airborne infection. Practical Implications We have developed a flexible mathematical model that can help determine the best intervention strategies for containing indoor airborne infections. The approach presented here is scalable and can be extended to include additional control efficacies. If a newly emergent airborne infection should appear, the model could be quickly calibrated to data and intervention options at the early stage of the outbreak. Data could be provided from the field to estimate value of R0, the serial interval between cases, the distributions of the latent, incubation, and infectious periods, case fatality rates, and secondary spread within important mixing groups. The combination of enhanced engineering control measures and assigned effective public health interventions would have a high probability for containing airborne infection.","Chen, S-C; Chang, C-F; Liao, C-M",Indoor air,74,15

The realization that the concept of globalization includes global exposure to disease-causing agents that were formerly confined to small, remote areas and that infectious disease outbreaks can have political, economic and social roots and effects is becoming more apparent. Novel infectious disease microbes continue to be discovered because they are new or newly recognized, have expanded their geographic range, have been shown to cause a new disease spectrum, have jumped the species barrier from animals to humans, have become resistant to antimicrobial agents, have increased in incidence or have become more virulent. These emerging infectious disease microbes may have the potential for use as agents of bioterrorism. Factors involved in the emergence of infectious diseases are complex and interrelated and involve all classifications of organisms transmitted in a variety of ways. In 2003, outbreaks of interest included severe acute respiratory syndrome, monkeypox and avian influenza. Information from the human genome project applied to microbial organisms and their hosts will provide new opportunities for detection, diagnosis, treatment, prevention, control and prognosis. New technology related not only to genetics but also to satellite and monitoring systems will play a role in weather, climate and the approach to environmental manipulations that influence factors contributing to infectious disease emergence and control.

We have shown previously that mice inoculated intracerebrally with MHV-A59 develop mild meningoencephalitis followed by chronic central nervous system (CNS) disease, characterized by primary demyelination (1).

Replication of IBV in Vero cells causes extensive cytopathic effects (CPE), leading to destruction of the entire monolayer and the death of infected cells. In this study, we investigated the cell death processes during acute IBV infection and the underlying mechanisms. The results show that both necrosis and apoptosis may contribute to the death of infected cells in lytic IBV infection. Caspase-dependent apoptosis, as characterized by chromosomal condensation, DNA fragmentation, caspase-3 activation, and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase degradation, was detected in IBV-infected Vero cells. Addition of the general caspase inhibitor z-VAD-FMK to the culture media showed inhibition of the hallmarks of apoptosis and increase of the release of virus to the culture media at 16 h postinfection. However, neither the necrotic process nor the productive replication of IBV in Vero cells was severely affected by the inhibition of apoptosis.

In view of its potential uses, such as a gas-phase biosensor or a high-performance air filter, we have tried to verify a previously undescribed binding reaction between protein antigens and corresponding antibodies immobilized on a solid surface by using fluorescence resonance energy transfer between the two. Our data showed that the antibody on a solid surface specifically reacted with a protein antigen supplied from the gas phase under the normal ambient condition. Also discovered was that the reaction occurred even faster than that in the liquid phase under several assay conditions.","Iwanaga, Hiroshi; Tsuzuki, Hirohiko; Kamiyama, Yoichiro; Ueda, Hiroshi",Analytical sciences : the international journal of the Japan Society for Analytical Chemistry,74,28

The presence of L3T4+ cells and in vitro proliferation in response to GPBP are required for the successful transfer. Pathologically, passively transferred EAE in the virus-free PL/J strain was characterized by an infiltration in the central nervous system by small lymphocytes, followed by the appearance of macrophages, and subsequently by primary demyelination. These findings were similar to those previously observed in chronic relapsing EAE in SJL/J mice. However, in some experiments pathologic examination of the spinal cord showed large demyelinating lesions which were necrotic and infiltrated with eosinophilic polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Sera from mice with this pathology contained antibodies to murine hepatitis virus and extensive search identified a few areas of coronavirus replication. The pathology of autoimmune mediated demyelination may be altered in the presence of coronavirus infection but the clinical pattern of EAE expression did not differ between virus-free and coronavirus-infected mice.","Cross, A H; McCarron, R; McFarlin, D E; Raine, C S",Laboratory investigation; a journal of technical methods and pathology,74,17

The correlation of scores and prognosis was evaluated. RESULTS The scores of the nonsurvivors were higher remarkably than those of the surviving group(P<00.01). The scores of the acute physiology score (APS) and year score (YS) in the death group were higher obviously than those of the surviving group(both P<0.01). Elderly patients with severe disease had a high mortality. The scores of APACHE III had positive correlation with the over all fatality rate. When the scores of APACHE III was higher than 60, the fatality rate increased obviously. CONCLUSION The scores of APACHE III in the SARS are correlated with the patient's condition and prognosis.","Shi, Hai-yan; Zhang, Fu-chun; Yin, Chi-biao; Deng, Xi-long",Zhongguo wei zhong bing ji jiu yi xue = Chinese critical care medicine = Zhongguo weizhongbing jijiuyixue,74,17

The patient was placed on assisted respiration support in addition to anti-viral medication. The diagnosis of SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) was made in view of the severe hypoxemia and the characteristic symptoms exhibited by the patient. Despite the best intensive therapy, he clinically deteriorated into multiorgan dysfunction syndrome (MODS) including additional dysfunction of kidney, liver, and heart. We initiated MARS therapy (extracorporeal liver support utilizing albumin dialysis) with intention to positively influence the organ functions in his MODS on the basis of recently published studies which suggested a positive impact of MARS in multiorgan failure secondary to respiratory illnesses and the possible influence on inflammatory mediators and cytokines. The application of 4 intermittent MARS treatments (8 h each, mean blood flow rate 180 ml/min) on 4 consecutive days resulted in an immediate improvement of clinical conditions within the treatment days. The further improvement of organ functions allowed withdrawing the patient from ventilatory support 13 days after start of MARS, and 44 days after admission he was discharged home with completely resolved organ functions and laboratory abnormalities. SARS is a severe form of the epidemic outbreak of atypical pneumonia which remains poorly defined regarding etiology and special therapy recommendations. However, the development and aggravation of this ARDS-like severe acute respiratory syndrome is pathologically associated with the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) which may then mediate or cause MODS. To our knowledge, this is the first report of an application of MARS therapy in MODS which was probably induced by SARS in a patient in China which improved the clinical condition of the patient in multi-organ failure secondary to respiratory failure indicating that MARS might be an additional therapeutic option in multiorgan failure induced by SARS.","Luo, Hong-Tao; Wu, Min; Wang, Min-Min",Artificial organs,74,11

Gas chromatographic mass spectrometric analysis revealed the presence of 13 chemical constituents with thymol (75.2%), p-cymene (6.7%), limonene (5.4), and carvacrol (3.5%) as the major constituents. The oil composition was dominated by the oxygenated monoterpenes. Antibacterial activity of the essential oil and its major constituents (thymol, p-cymene, limonene) was evaluated against Streptococcus pyogenes, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Escherichia coli. The study revealed that the essential oil and its constituents exhibited a broad spectrum and variable degree of antibacterial activity against different strains. Among the tested strains, Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli and Streptococcus pneumoniae were the most susceptible bacterial strain showing lowest MIC and MBC values. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus was the most resistant bacterial strain to the essential oil treatment showing relatively higher MIC and MBC values. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that the essential oil induced potent and dose-dependent membrane damage in S. pyogenes and MRSA bacterial strains. The reactive oxygen species generated by the Monarda punctata essential oil were identified using 2', 7'-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFDA).This study indicated that the Monarda punctata essential oil to a great extent and thymol to a lower extent triggered a substantial increase in the ROS levels in S. pyogenes bacterial cultures which ultimately cause membrane damage as revealed by SEM results.","Li, Hong; Yang, Tian; Li, Fei-Yan; Yao, Yan; Sun, Zhong-Min",International journal of clinical and experimental pathology,74,1

OBJECTIVES To explore the impact of SARS on general practitioners (GPs) in Hong Kong. DESIGN A cross sectional survey. SETTING Community based primary care clinics. PARTICIPANTS 183 family medicine tutors affiliated with a local university. Postal survey sent to all tutors with a 74.8% response rate. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Change of clinical behaviour and practices during the epidemic; anxiety level of primary care doctors. RESULTS All agreed SARS had changed their clinical practices. Significant anxiety was found in family doctors. Three quarters of respondents recalled requesting more investigations while a quarter believed they had over-prescribed antibiotics. GPs who were exposed to SARS or who had worked in high infection districts were less likely to quarantine themselves (10.8% versus 33.3%; p<0.01; 6.5% versus 27.5%; p<0.01 respectively). Exposure to SARS, the infection rates in their working district, and anxiety levels had significant impact on the level of protection or prescribing behaviour. CONCLUSION The clinical practice of GPs changed significantly as a result of SARS. Yet, those did not quarantine themselves suggesting other factors may have some part to play. As failure to apply isolation precautions to suspected cases of SARS was one major reason for its spread, a contingency plan from the government to support family doctors is of utmost importance.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is used as a case example because it is an emerging infection and a prime example of the type of disease that pharmacists may encounter in daily practice (e.g., easily transmitted, resembles the common cold). DATA SOURCES We retrieved data from publications related to medical geography, medical surveillance, and SARS. Data on current SARS cases in Hong Kong were obtained from the Hong Kong Department of Health Web site. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION Variables regarding new cases and deaths due to SARS were evaluated. DATA SYNTHESIS Background information on medical geography and medical surveillance was reviewed. Descriptive statistics were calculated for incidence, prevalence, and the number of deaths due to SARS in Hong Kong from March 14 to May 31, 2003. CONCLUSIONS Emerging infections are a serious concern for both the public and healthcare practitioners. The recent global diffusion of SARS highlights the ease in which diseases can diffuse from place to place. Understanding concepts related to medical geography and medical surveillance can help pharmacists be better prepared to anticipate disease diffusion and to evaluate signs of emerging infections. In turn, this can help pharmacists be better prepared to provide information and care to their patients. The long-term benefit of understanding how diseases spread and the specific activities related to disease detection is an opportunity for expanding the scope of pharmacy practice.","Litaker, John R; Chou, Jennie Y; Novak, Suzanne; Wilson, James P",The Annals of pharmacotherapy,74,5

African-Americans are succumbing to novel SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) at an alarming rate. Current data indicate that while African-Americans represent less than 13.4% of the United States' population, they account for one-third of more than 4.77 million persons with verified COVID-19 infections. Currently, more than 50,258 African-Americans have succumbed to the disease. African-Americans are disproportionately impacted by COVID-19 to an extent unobserved in other racial/ethnic subgroups. In addition, this article describes the physiological event inflammation-mediation storming (cytokine storming). Social determinants of health such as income, education, and employment are hypothesized to impact cogent health care delivery for African-Americans. Included in this article are data on clinical outcomes that highlight the role of pre-existing (health disparities) conditions like diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, obesity, and lung disease, as barriers to optimal outcomes among African-Americans who are hospitalized with COVID-19. Also explored in this article is causation for vascular complications. A further aim of this article is to provide insight into cause and effect rationales for COVID-19 and health disparities, from both biosocial and health inequality perspectives. Linkages between these selected health disparities and COVID-19 are examined to determine possible deteriorating effects of COVID-19. Finally, techniques are offered to render culturally competent care to African-Americans diagnosed with COVID-19 who present concomitantly with health disparities.","Strickland, Ora L; Powell-Young, Yolanda; Reyes-Miranda, Clara; Alzaghari, Omar; Giger, Joyce Newman",Journal of National Black Nurses' Association : JNBNA,74,33

Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (SARS-CoV) uses ER as a site for synthesis and processing of viral proteins. In this report, we demonstrate that infection with SARS-CoV induces the UPR in cultured cells. A comparison with M, E, and NSP6 proteins indicates that SARS-CoV spike (S) protein sufficiently induces transcriptional activation of several UPR effectors, including glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78), GRP94, and C/EBP homologous protein. A substantial amount of S protein accumulates in the ER. The expression of S protein exerts different effects on the three major signaling pathways of the UPR. Particularly, it induces GRP78/94 through PKR-like ER kinase but has no influence on activating transcription factor 6 or X box-binding protein 1. Taken together, our findings suggest that SARS-CoV S protein specifically modulates the UPR to facilitate viral replication.","Chan, Ching-Ping; Siu, Kam-Leung; Chin, King-Tung; Yuen, Kwok-Yung; Zheng, Bojian; Jin, Dong-Yan",Journal of virology,74,19

The site between nsP3 and nsP4 (the 3/4 site) is cleaved most efficiently. Analysis of Semliki Forest virus-specific cleavage sites with shuffled N-terminal and C-terminal half-sites showed that the main determinants of cleavage efficiency are located in the region preceding the cleavage site. Random mutagenesis analysis revealed that amino acid residues in positions P4, P3, P2, and P1 of the 3/4 cleavage site cannot tolerate much variation, whereas in the P5 position most residues were permitted. When mutations affecting cleavage efficiency were introduced into the 2/3 and 3/4 cleavage sites, the resulting viruses remained viable but had similar defects in P1234 processing as observed in the in vitro assay. Complete blockage of the 3/4 cleavage was found to be lethal. The amino acid in position P1' had a significant effect on cleavage efficiency, and in this regard the protease markedly preferred a glycine residue over the tyrosine natively present in the 3/4 site. Therefore, the cleavage sites represent a compromise between protease recognition and other requirements of the virus life cycle. The protease recognizes at least residues P4 to P1', and the P4 arginine residue plays an important role in the fast cleavage of the 3/4 site.","Lulla, Aleksei; Lulla, Valeria; Tints, Kairit; Ahola, Tero; Merits, Andres",Journal of virology,74,4

The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has led to an unprecedented demand for molecular tests and platforms. Our objective was to gain insight into the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on the actual or anticipated shortage of tests, equipment, consumables, and staff required to deliver molecular HPV laboratory services and to consider the implications for the sustainability and development of cervical screening programs. METHODS A 19-item online questionnaire was created and made available online between December 2020 and February 2021. Five companies with clinically validated HPV and SARS-CoV-2 tests in their portfolios were invited to provide a statement on the volumes of molecular COVID-19 tests produced, relevant changes to manufacturing capacity, and their current and post-pandemic strategy for HPV tests. RESULTS We received responses from 57 laboratories representing 30 countries and six continents. Among these, 74% reported experiencing a supply shortage, 54% reported a shortage of personnel, and 33% reported delays in ordering equipment. Three companies described expansion of manufacturing lines, investment in diagnostic infrastructure, and scale-up of manufacturing capacity. Two companies specifically referred to opportunities for the use of platforms for COVID-19 testing to support HPV testing in time. CONCLUSIONS The demand for SARS-CoV-2 testing is competing with HPV testing, compounded by a shortage of staff. This represents a challenge for existing laboratory services and for settings keen to implement HPV-based screening. However, supply challenges may be addressed in time, given the significant investment in manufacturing capacity. In addition, innovation around molecular COVID-19 testing systems may result in solutions that address the shortage of rapid low-cost HPV testing systems for low-resource settings. Finally, because the demand for COVID-19 testing is likely to decrease, this may release both workforce and platform capacity for high-throughput HPV testing. The global health community should be alert to the opportunities around innovation and capacity if cervical cancer elimination goals are to be reached.","Poljak, Mario; Cuschieri, Kate; Waheed, Dur-E-Nayab; Baay, Marc; Vorsters, Alex","Acta dermatovenerologica Alpina, Pannonica, et Adriatica",74,2

One study provided molecular and immunologic evidence for mycobacteria among sarcoidosis subjects from the United States. These studies, while preliminary, provide the groundwork for more in-depth studies of the potential role of mycobacteria in sarcoidosis pathogenesis. Proprionibacteria have also been proposed as a cause of sarcoidosis; a study of the detection of Proprionibacterium species nucleic acids throughout the lung of sarcoidosis and control subjects, however, suggests that these organisms are less likely to be causal. SUMMARY While the studies to date do not fulfill Koch's postulates, they do add further support to the hypothesis that infectious antigens, particularly those from mycobacteria, may have a causal role in some sarcoidosis cases. In future studies that purport to show an association of microbial antigen(s) with sarcoidosis, investigation of genetic risk factors contributing to risk will be important, in order to explain why some patients are found to have an association with microbial antigens and others are not.","Drake, Wonder Puryear; Newman, Lee S",Current opinion in pulmonary medicine,74,4

The first major outbreak occurred in Guangzhou, the capital of Guangdong, between January and March 2003. This study reviews the clinical presentation, laboratory findings and response to four different treatment protocols. Case notes and laboratory findings were analysed and outcome measures were collected prospectively. The SARS outbreak in Guangdong province and the outbreak in Guangzhou associated with hospitals in the city are described, documenting clinical and laboratory features in a cohort of 190 patients randomly allocated to four treatment regimens. Patients were infected by close contact in either family or health-care settings, particularly following procedures likely to generate aerosols of respiratory secretions (e.g. administration of nebulized drugs and bronchoscopy). The earliest symptom was a high fever followed, in most patients, by dyspnoea, cough and myalgia, with 24 % of patients complaining of diarrhoea. The most frequent chest X-ray changes were patchy consolidation with progression to bilateral bronchopneumonia over 5-10 days. Thirty-six cases developed adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), of whom 11 died. There was no response to antibiotics. The best response (no deaths) was seen in the group of 60 patients receiving early high-dose steroids and nasal CPAP (continuous airway positive pressure) ventilation; the other three treatment groups had significant mortality. Cross-infection to medical and nursing staff was completely prevented in one hospital by rigid adherence to barrier precautions during contact with infected patients. The use of rapid case identification and quarantine has controlled the outbreak in Guangzhou, in which more than 350 patients have been infected. Early administration of high-dose steroids and CPAP ventilation appears to offer the best supportive treatment with a reduced mortality compared with other treatment regimens.","Zhao, Z; Zhang, F; Xu, M; Huang, K; Zhong, W; Cai, W; Yin, Z; Huang, S; Deng, Z; Wei, M; Xiong, J; Hawkey, P M",Journal of medical microbiology,74,19

METHODS Prospective observational study over 1 year set in the Lewisham district of south east London. The daily attendance rate of children with acute wheeze at the accident and emergency department of Lewisham Hospital was related to local measurements of ozone, hydrocarbon species, nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulphur dioxide (SO2) and small particulate matter with diameter < 10 microns (PM10). RESULTS An inverse relation was found between the air pollutants and ozone. After seasonal and meteorological adjustment a non-linear U shaped trend was found between incidence of wheeze and ozone. The trend was significant in children < 2 years of age but not in older children. In the younger age group, after adjustment for season, temperature, wind speed, and respiratory infection, the incidence relative to that at the mean daily ozone concentration of 32.7 micrograms/m3, was estimated to increase by 65% (95% confidence interval (95% CI) 22% to 122%) at an ozone concentration of 5 micrograms/m3 (1.5 SDs below the mean) and by 63% (95% CI -6% to 184%) at 80 micrograms/m3 (2.5 SDs above the mean). For several hydrocarbons there were significant positive linear relations found, again in children < 2 years of age but not older children. For benzene, the incidence increased by 8% (95% CI 2 to 13%) per SD (SD 2.8 micrograms/m3) increase in benzene concentration. A same day association between incidence and ozone was found to be the most significant but for other pollutants a lag of 2 days gave the most significant associations. No significant association was found for the non-hydrocarbon pollutants including SO2, NO2, and PM10. CONCLUSIONS A U shaped relation was found between ozone and the incidence of wheezy episodes in young children. Certain hydrocarbon pollutants accumulate in the atmosphere when ozone concentrations are low, and are associated with childhood wheezy episodes. However, the U shaped association of ozone on incidence cannot be explained by these other pollutants. The finding supports an earlier finding that incidences of wheeze are at a minimum when ozone concentrations are 30-40 micrograms/m3.","Buchdahl, R; Willems, C D; Vander, M; Babiker, A",Occupational and environmental medicine,74,16

Budding is first detectable by electron microscopy at 6 to 7 hours post infection in small, smooth, perinuclear vesicles and tubules in a region transitional between the rough endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus. At later times the rough endoplasmic reticulum becomes the major site of budding and accumulation of progeny virus particles. Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy shows that E1 is confined at 6 hours post infection to the perinuclear region while at later times it also accumulates in the endoplasmic reticulum. At 6 hours post infection the second viral glycoprotein, E2, is distributed throughout the endoplasmic reticulum and is not restricted to the site at which budding begins. Core protein, the third protein in virions, can be detected 2 hours before E1 is detectable and budding begins, and at 6 hours post infection it is distributed throughout the cytosol. We conclude that the time and the site at which the maturation of progeny virions occurs is determined by the accumulation of glycoprotein E1 in intracellular membranes. Only rarely do progeny virions bud directly into the cisternae of the Golgi apparatus but at least some already budded virions are transported to the Golgi apparatus where they occur in structures some of which also contain TPPase, a trans Golgi marker.","Tooze, J; Tooze, S; Warren, G",European journal of cell biology,74,28

Factors that suggest serious infection include age younger than one month, poor arousability, petechial rash, delayed capillary refill, increased respiratory effort, and overall physician assessment. Urinary tract infections are the most common serious bacterial infection in children younger than three years, so evaluation for such infections should be performed in those with unexplained fever. Abnormal white blood cell counts have poor sensitivity for invasive bacterial infections; procalcitonin and C-reactive protein levels, when available, are more informative. Chest radiography is rarely recommended for children older than 28 days in the absence of localizing signs. Lumbar puncture is not recommended for children older than three months without localizing signs; it may also be considered for those from one to three months of age with abnormal laboratory test results. Protocols such as Step-by-Step, Laboratory Score, or the Rochester algorithms may be helpful in identifying low-risk patients. Rapid influenza testing and tests for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) may be of value when those diseases are circulating. When empiric treatment is appropriate, suggested antibiotics include ceftriaxone or cefotaxime for infants one to three months of age and ampicillin with gentamicin or with cefotaxime for neonates. For children three months to three years of age, azithromycin or amoxicillin is recommended if pneumonia is suspected; for urinary infections, suggested antibiotics are cefixime, amoxicillin/clavulanate, or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Choice of antibiotics should reflect local patterns of microbial resistance.","Hamilton, Jennifer L; Evans, Susanna G; Bakshi, Munish",American family physician,74,1

Vaccines are available for some organisms, but they are underutilized and/or still in development. To evaluate the potential impact of vaccines, we review studies in which the etiology of childhood community-acquired pneumonia was recorded. In North America and Europe (9 studies), the etiology of pneumonia was established in 62% of studied children (range 43%-88%) by use of noninvasive specific methods for microbiologic diagnosis. The most often identified agents were S. pneumoniae (22%), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (20%), Haemophilus influenzae (7%), and Mycoplasma pneumoniae (15%). In Africa and South America (8 studies), bacteria were recovered from 56% (range 32%-68%) of severely ill children studied by lung aspirate. The most often isolated bacteria were Streptococcus pneumoniae (33%) and Haemophilus influenzae (21%). A high percentage of H. influenzae strains were not serotype b. Throughout the world, children requiring hospitalization were most likely to have infection caused by pneumococcus, H. influenzae or RSV. Out patients also had Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Countries in Africa and Asia recorded 2 to 10 times more children with pneumonia (7 to 40/100 annually) than in the USA. Widespread use of pneumococcal and H. influenzae type b conjugate vaccines could reduce the frequency of childhood pneumonia by one-third. Further reduction will require development of non-type b H. influenzae, RSV and M. pneumoniae vaccines. This could result in a > 50% reduction of pneumonia in children. This goal should be sought and achieved as soon as possible.","Nascimento-Carvalho, C M",The Brazilian journal of infectious diseases : an official publication of the Brazilian Society of Infectious Diseases,74,8

Normal flora or previously unrecognized intestinal pathogens may contribute to the development of disease in susceptible hosts. A newly recognized murine Helicobacter, H. hepaticus, causes hepatitis in mice and in one strain of mice is linked to liver cancer. This study investigates the association between colonization of the lower intestinal tract of multiple genetically altered lines of mice with H. hepaticus, and the occurrence of IBD. MATERIALS AND METHODS Rectal prolapse noted clinically in multiple genetically altered mouse lines was evaluated for the presence of H. hepaticus and histologic evidence of IBD. Fifty-five mice representing 11 different genetic alterations were evaluated. RESULTS H. hepaticus was detected in 85% of mutant mice with rectal prolapse. Histologic evidence of proliferative typhlitis, colitis or proctitis was present in 65% of the animals examined, 89% of which were positive for H. hepaticus as detected by species specific PCR. CONCLUSION The presence of H. hepaticus in association with IBD in multiple lines of genetically altered mice suggests further studies are needed to test experimentally the role H. hepaticus plays in the development of IBD in susceptible mice. Additionally, specific mutant mouse lines infected with H. hepaticus in this study may provide additional models for elucidation of microbial and genetic factors in the pathogenesis of IBD.","Foltz, C J; Fox, J G; Cahill, R; Murphy, J C; Yan, L; Shames, B; Schauer, D B",Helicobacter,74,11

Structure studies of the full-length form of the obligate hexameric enzyme from two CoVs, SARS-CoV and murine hepatitis virus, and its monomeric homologue, XendoU from Xenopus laevis, combined with mutagenesis studies have implicated several residues in enzymatic activity and the N-terminal domain as the major determinant of hexamerization. However, the tight link between hexamerization and enzyme activity in NendoUs has remained an enigma. Here, we report the structure of a trimmed, monomeric form of SARS-CoV nsp15 (residues 28 to 335) determined to a resolution of 2.9 A. The catalytic loop (residues 234 to 249) with its two reactive histidines (His 234 and His 249) is dramatically flipped by approximately 120 degrees into the active site cleft. Furthermore, the catalytic nucleophile Lys 289 points in a diametrically opposite direction, a consequence of an outward displacement of the supporting loop (residues 276 to 295). In the full-length hexameric forms, these two loops are packed against each other and are stabilized by intimate intersubunit interactions. Our results support the hypothesis that absence of an adjacent monomer due to deletion of the hexamerization domain is the most likely cause for disruption of the active site, offering a structural basis for why only the hexameric form of this enzyme is active.","Joseph, Jeremiah S; Saikatendu, Kumar Singh; Subramanian, Vanitha; Neuman, Benjamin W; Buchmeier, Michael J; Stevens, Raymond C; Kuhn, Peter",Journal of virology,74,16

Antisense oligonucleotides as therapeutic agents were proposed as far back as in the 1970s when the antisense strategy was initially developed. Nonetheless, it has taken almost a quarter of a century for this potential to be realized. The principle of antisense technology is the sequence-specific binding of an antisense oligonucleotide to target mRNA, resulting in the prevention of gene translation. The specificity of hybridization by Watson-Crick base pairing make antisense oligonucleotides attractive as tools for targeted validation and functionalization, and as therapeutics to selectively modulate the expression of genes involved in the pathogenesis of diseases. The last few years have seen a rapid increase in the number of antisense molecules progressing past Phase I, II and III clinical trials.

Three CD-91 deletion mutants were constructed--CD-44, CD-58, and CD-61--in which 4,639, 3,236, and 2,953 nucleotides, respectively, were removed from CD-91, resulting in the truncation of the CD-91 long open reading frame (ORF) from 6,465 to 1,311, 1,263, or 2,997 nucleotides in CD-44, CD-58, or CD-61, respectively. Electroporation of in vitro T7-transcribed RNA from the three constructs into IBV helper virus-infected cells resulted in the replication and packaging of CD-58 and CD-61 but not CD-44 RNA. The ORF of CD-61 was further truncated by the insertion of stop codons into the CD-61 sequence by PCR mutagenesis, resulting in constructs CD-61T11 (ORF: nucleotides 996 to 1,058, encoding 20 amino acids), CD-61T22 (ORF: nucleotides 996 to 2,294, encoding 432 amino acids), and CD-61T24 (ORF: nucleotides 996 to 2,450, encoding 484 amino acids), all of which were replicated and packaged to the same levels as observed for either CD-61 or CD-91. Analysis of the D-RNAs showed that the CD-91- or CD-61-specific long ORFs had not been restored. Our data indicate that IBV D-RNAs based on the natural D-RNA, CD-91, do not require a long ORF for efficient replication. In addition, a 1.4-kb sequence, corresponding to IBV sequence at the 5' end of the 1b gene, may be involved in the packaging of IBV D-RNAs or form part of a cis-acting replication element.","Pénzes, Z; Wroe, C; Brown, T D; Britton, P; Cavanagh, D",Journal of virology,74,28

AIM to evaluate the efficiency of changing standard combination therapy to -adrenergic blockers + m-cholinoblockers instead of proceeding to surgical treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS From January 2019 to December 2019, a total of 137 patients with lower urinary treatment were referred to the Pletnev City Clinical Hospital due to limited efficiency of combination therapy with -adrenergic blockers and 5-reductase inhibitors in order to undergone laser enucleation/vaporization of the prostate. After evaluation, 41 patients with absolute indications for surgical treatment or with suspected prostate cancer were excluded. After a comprehensive examination, 96 patients were prescribed tamsulosin 0.4 mg daily in combination with solifenacin 10 mg daily. All patients were followed up for 12 months. RESULTS As a result of using solifenacin, better control over storage symptoms was achieved according to the I-PSS scale (-4 points), which also led to a significant decrease in the total I-PSS score after 12 months of therapy. There was an increase in the mean voided volume (by 53%) after 6 months. Neither Qmax, nor residual urine volume did not change significantly. According to the MIEF-5 scale, an improvement in erectile function was revealed. There was a slight decrease in the average prostate volume and an increase in the PSA level from 3.1 to 4.1 ng/ml. There was no acute urinary retention. However, 6 patients discontinued taking of m-cholinoblockers due to dry mouth. CONCLUSIONS If there are no absolute indications for surgical treatment, changing the combination of -adrenergic blockers + 5-Reductase inhibitors to a combination of -adrenergic blockers + m-cholinoblockers results in a pronounced symptomatic improvement due to alleviation of storage symptoms.","Ergakov, D V; Martov, A G",Urologiia,74,1

The aim of this study is to reveal the evolution forces of SARS-CoV virus by analyzing the nucleotide mutations in these sequences. METHODS We obtained 20 SARS-CoV virus genome sequences from NCBI database, and calculated the ratio of non-synonymous nucleotide substitution per non-synonymous site (Ka) and synonymous nucleotide substitution per synonymous site (Ks) for SARS-CoV virus genes. RESULTS The Ka/Ks ratios for replicase polyprotein ORF1a, ORF1b, and spike protein gene are 1.09 (P=0.6501), 0.38 (P=0.0074), 0.65 (P=0.0685) respectively. CONCLUSION SARS-CoV virus replicase polyprotein ORF1b is undergoing negative selection; negative selection force is also probably operating on spike protein gene.

We previously demonstrated that the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of S protein contains multiple conformational epitopes (Conf I-VI) that confer the major target of neutralizing Abs. Here we show that the recombinant RBDs derived from the S protein sequences of Tor2, GD03, and SZ3, the representative strains of human 2002-2003 and 2003-2004 SARS-CoV and palm civet SARS-CoV, respectively, induce in the immunized mice and rabbits high titers of cross-neutralizing Abs against pseudoviruses expressing S proteins of Tor2, GD03, and SZ3. We also demonstrate that the Tor2-RBD induced-Conf I-VI mAbs can potently neutralize both human SARS-CoV strains, Tor2 and GD03. However, only the Conf IV-VI, but not Conf I-III mAbs, neutralize civet SARS-CoV strain SZ3. All these mAbs reacted significantly with each of the three RBD variants (Tor2-RBD, GD03-RBD, and SZ3-RBD) that differ at several amino acids. Regardless, the Conf I-IV and VI epitopes were completely disrupted by single-point mutation of the conserved residues in the RBD (e.g., D429A, R441A, or D454A) and the Conf III epitope was significantly affected by E452A or D463A substitution. Interestingly, the Conf V epitope, which may overlap the receptor-binding motif and induce most potent neutralizing Abs, was conserved in these mutants. These data suggest that the major neutralizing epitopes of SARS-CoV have been apparently maintained during cross-species transmission, and that RBD-based vaccines may induce broad protection against both human and animal SARS-CoV variants.","He, Yuxian; Li, Jingjing; Li, Wenhui; Lustigman, Sara; Farzan, Michael; Jiang, Shibo",Journal of immunology,74,1

This class of carbohydrate molecule is without peer in structural diversity and is characteristically suitable for storing and displaying biological signals for molecular and cellular recognition. Exploring the biological information contained in sugar chains is an important topic of current postgenomic research. To facilitate these investigations, we have focused on the establishment of a carbohydrate-based microarray technology. Recently, we reported that a large panel of carbohydrate-containing macromolecules, including polysaccharides, natural glycoconjugates, and the mono- and oligosaccharides coupled to carrier molecules, can be stably immobilized on a microglass slide to produce a large-scale carbohydrate microarray. In this review, we attempt to summarize our recent progress in using this technology to uncover the carbohydrate-based biological signals that are recognized by the human and animal immune systems. We also discuss the potential of various platforms of carbohydrate microarrays that were recently established and analyze the challenges to future development of carbohydrate microarray technologies and their applications.","Wang, Denong",Proteomics,74,17

Correlation of these sites with the physical structure of the protein was achieved by use of different approaches. Recombinant pEX plasmids directing the synthesis of various fused S polypeptides were constructed. A hybrid protein containing nine S-specific residues (363 to 371) was shown to express site C epitopes. The other sites were localized through study of the antigenic activity of fragments generated by controlled cleavage of the native protein with different endopeptidases. Two identified cleavage products of 26K and 13K, immunoreactive to site A-B- and site D-specific MAbs respectively, could be aligned on the S primary structure according to N-terminal sequence data. This led us to propose that the major neutralization domain A-B is contained in a region of approximately 200 residues with residue 506 as its N boundary. Similarly, site D epitopes should be located within a stretch of 130 residues, starting at 82 residues from the N terminus. Point mutations identified by direct RNA sequencing of neutralization-resistant mutants were consistent with the proposed location of these sites.","Delmas, B; Rasschaert, D; Godet, M; Gelfi, J; Laude, H",The Journal of general virology,74,19

METHODS Two thousand and sixty-five valid questionnaires were collected from stomatological colleges in Jiangxi province through internet. SPSS 20.0 software was used for statistical analysis, Chi-square test and binary logistic regression were used for single factor and multi factor analysis. RESULTS According to the survey, 74.72% of dental students expressed their concern about the epidemic situation, and 75.93% expressed that they checked the number of confirmed cases in China once or more every day. Students with higher education background, licensed doctor certificate and better family status paid more attention to the epidemic period and frequently checked the information(P<0.05). The categories of information most concerned by all respondents was data such as the number of newly diagnosed patients and the number of cured cases, followed by the diagnosis and treatment of patients with COVID-19.The average score of knowledge about epidemic situation was 5.60±1.88. Analysis of influencing factors showed that the knowledge level of women was higher than that of men（OR=1.371，95%CI:1.143-1.644）.Medical students from Hubei province had a good level of knowledge, high education, party members, and students with medical qualifications had a high level of knowledge about epidemic situation of COVID-19(P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS The epidemic period of COVID-19 is a high concern among dental students in Jiangxi province , and the awareness rate of related knowledge is low. In order to improve the quality of dental personnel training, the medical colleges or school should strengthen the training of students' operations in the hospital, and add relevant courses of public health emergency in the training program.","Zeng, Yi-Xuan; Li, Zhi-Hua; Zhu, Jia; Li, Xiao-Hui; Huang, Min; Ouyang, Zhi-Qiang",Shanghai kou qiang yi xue = Shanghai journal of stomatology,74,9

Hospitalized patients with dermatomyositis (DM) and polymyositis (PM) between 1998 and 2005 in the Shanghai Renji Hospital were retrospectively studied. One hundred and forty-five patients were classified into CADM, classic DM or PM according to the modified Sontheimer's definition or Bohan-Peter's classification criteria. They were further stratified based on the presence or absence of clinical ILD. The Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and COX regression were performed. The predictive factors for ILD and other clinical properties of CADM-ILD were explored. The presence of clinical ILD was a significant risk factor for the poor outcome of DM/PM (OR = 4.237, CI 95%: 1.239-14.49, p = 0.021). Other risk factors are the presence of rashes and elevated urea nitrogen. Patients with DM/PM complicated by ILD had different clinical courses. Patients with CADM-ILD showed a rapidly progressive pattern with 6-month survival rate of 40.8%. The DM-ILD manifested a progressive pattern with a 5-year survival rate of 54%, while PM-ILD was chronic with 5- and 10-year survival rate of 72.4% and 60.3%, respectively. Better preserved muscle strength, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and hypoalbuminemia may herald ILD in DM/PM. Patients with CADM-ILD who later died had lower PO(2), higher lactate dehydrogenase, and prominent arthritis/arthralgia compared with those who survived. The presence of antinuclear antibody seems to be protective. Rapid progressive CADM-ILD is refractory to conventional treatment. ILD is a common complication in over 40% of our hospitalized DM/PM cohort and is also a prominent prognostic indicator. CADM is a special phenotype of DM/PM. CADM-ILD, which is usually rapidly progressive and fatal, requires further investigation.","Ye, Shuang; Chen, Xiao-xiang; Lu, Xiao-ye; Wu, Mei-fang; Deng, Yun; Huang, Wen-qun; Guo, Qiang; Yang, Cheng-de; Gu, Yue-ying; Bao, Chun-de; Chen, Shun-le",Clinical rheumatology,74,9

METHODS The levels of serum IL-2, IL-10, IL-12 and T-lymphocyte subset counts were measured in 35 clinically diagnosed SARS patients by using enzyme linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA). The relationship between the measured results and WBC count was further analyzed. RESULTS The level of serum IL was increased to a great extent in the 35 SARS patients, and the levels of serum IL-2, IL-10 and IL-12 were 242.53 (92.69) pg/ml, 77.43 (63.37) pg/ml and 65.94 (43.21) pg/ml, respectively. The level of serum IL-2 increased markedly (P < 0.01). The peripheral blood CD(3)(+), CD(4)(+) and CD(8)(+) counts were lower than normal in 23 patients (67.7%), 26 patients (74.3%) and 15 patients (42.9%), respectively. The peripheral blood WBC counts were lower than 4.0 x 10(9)/L in 10 patients, and their CD(3)(+), CD(4)(+) and CD(8)(+) counts were 583.90 (315.58) x 10(6)/L, 272.00 (94.13) x 10(6)/L and 209.00 (72.21) x 10(6)/L, respectively. The peripheral blood WBC counts were (4.0 - 10.0) x 10(9)/L in 20 patients, and their CD(3)(+), CD(4)(+) and CD(8)(+) counts were 700.00 (502.96) x 10(6)/L, 347.00 (247.58) x 10(6)/L and 322.05 (228.47) x 10(6)/L, respectively. The peripheral blood WBC counts were higher than 10.0 x 10(9)/L in 5 patients, and their CD(3)(+), CD(4)(+) and CD(8)(+) counts were 1466.00 (630.86) x 10(6)/L, 783.00 (311.14) x 10(6)/L and 640.00 (294.40) x 10(6)/L, respectively. The decreased CD(3)(+), CD(4)(+) and CD(8)(+) counts were consistent with the decreased WBC counts. The level of IL in SARS patients was significantly higher than that in patients with chronic hepatitis B (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS The level of serum IL is closely related to cell immunity in SARS patients. The level of serum IL is increased evidently while CD(3)(+), CD(4)(+) and CD(8)(+) counts decrease. Both serum IL and CD are associated with injury of immune function, and thus they could be regarded as a monitoring index for judging the condition of SARS patients and prescribing immune therapy.","Li, Zhuo; Guo, Xinhui; Hao, Wa; Wu, Yanning; Ji, Yunxia; Zhao, Yanming; Liu, Fang; Xie, Xianchun",Chinese medical journal,74,16

The nsp2 and nsp3 cleavage products have previously been found to interact, a property that allows nsp2 to act as a co-factor in the processing of the downstream part of the polyprotein by the nsp4 protease. Remarkably, upon infection of Vero cells, but not of BHK-21 or RK-13 cells, EAV nsp2 is now shown to be subject to an additional, internal, cleavage. In Vero cells, approximately 50% of nsp2 (61 kDa) was cleaved into an 18 kDa N-terminal part and a 44 kDa C-terminal part, most likely by a host cell protease that is absent in BHK-21 and RK-13 cells. Although the functional consequences of this additional processing step are unknown, the experiments in Vero cells revealed that the C-terminal part of nsp2 interacts with nsp3. Most EAV nsps localize to virus-induced double-membrane structures in the perinuclear region of the infected cell, where virus RNA synthesis takes place. It is now shown that, in an expression system, the co-expression of nsp2 and nsp3 is both necessary and sufficient to induce the formation of double-membrane structures that strikingly resemble those found in infected cells. Thus, the nsp2 and nsp3 cleavage products play a crucial role in two processes that are common to positive-strand RNA viruses that replicate in mammalian cells: controlled proteolysis of replicase precursors and membrane association of the virus replication complex.","Snijder, E J; van Tol, H; Roos, N; Pedersen, K W",The Journal of general virology,74,1

METHODS Fifty depressed patients aged 21-60 years took part in the study. The Schedules for Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry, version 2.0, and the International Personality Disorders Examination were used for diagnosis. Psychometric assessment included the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, the Hamilton Anxiety Scale, the General Assessment of Funtioning Scale, the Newcastle scales and the Diagnostic Melancholia Scale. The DST and 9.00 and 23.00 h MT values were assessed. Statistical analysis included Student's t test, Pearson product moment correlation coefficient and forward stepwise multiple linear regression analysis. RESULTS Melancholic patients had lower 23.00 h MT values in comparison to the rest of the patients and the atypical and 'undifferentiated' patients. CONCLUSION The current study shows that low MT values were closely related to melancholic depression. Distinct quality of mood, psychomotor agitation or retardation and anorexia or weight loss seemed to be responsible for this relationship.","Fountoulakis, K N; Karamouzis, M; Iacovides, A; Nimatoudis, J; Diakogiannis, J; Kaprinis, G; Demitriadou, A; Bech, P",Neuropsychobiology,74,19

METHODS A retrospective cohort study on laboratory-confirmed, adult influenza patients hospitalized in 2004 and 2005 was conducted. For all influenza cases during that period, immunofluorescence assay on nasopharyngeal aspirate was used for rapid diagnosis, and oseltamivir (75 mg twice daily for 5 days) prescribed if the patient presented within 2 days of symptom onset. Independent factors associated with time to discharge were identified using Cox proportional hazards models. An adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) >1 signifies a higher chance of early discharge. Viral shedding and influenza vaccination history were studied during one 'flu' season. RESULTS A total of 356 patients (influenza A 93.5%) were studied. The majority of patients were old (70.2 +/- 8.4 years), had > or = 1 comorbid illness (69.1%) and developed respiratory or cardiovascular complications (69.4%). Oseltamivir initiated within 2 days of illness was associated with shorter total LOS (Kaplan-Meier estimated median 4 versus 6 days [-33%]; aHR for discharge 1.54, 95% confidence intervals [95% CI] 1.23-1.92, P < 0.0001). Older age (> or = 70 years), comorbidities and complications were associated with prolonged LOS. Prolonged viral RNA detection >day 4 of illness (23 out of 99 consecutive patients) was also independently associated with longer LOS (aHR 0.36 [95% CI 0.19-0.71], P = 0.003), whereas influenza vaccination within 6 months was associated with shorter LOS (aHR 2.14 [95% CI 1.18-3.85], P = 0.012). CONCLUSION Our analyses suggest that timely oseltamivir treatment is independently associated with shorter LOS in patients hospitalized for severe influenza. Efforts to ensure early diagnosis and therapeutic intervention are warranted.","Lee, Nelson; Chan, Paul K S; Choi, Kin Wing; Lui, Grace; Wong, Bonnie; Cockram, Clive S; Hui, David S C; Lai, Raymond; Tang, Julian W; Sung, Joseph J Y",Antiviral therapy,74,20

It could be the running cause of the burn out of the health system in many countries. The aim of this paper is to suggest a pathophysiologic hypothesis to explain the main characteristics of severe cases of COVID-19 and its underlying conditions. In fact, the clinical and biological picture of severe cases of COVID-19 can easily be explained by free heme toxicity exceeding the endogenous antioxidant systems. Severe cases of COVID-19 are comparable to acute porphyria. On the other hand, the geographical distribution of severe cases of COVID-19 is directly associated to how fresh or polluted the air is. Finally, the relatively low rate of severe cases of COVID-19 could be explained by the presence of an unstable hemoglobin variant highly sensitive to the intrinsic conditions resulting from the acute pneumonia secondary to SARS-CoV2 infection. The combination of air pollution and free heme toxicity, resulting from the interaction between an unstable hemoglobin variant and SARS-CoV2 infection, seems to be the best scheme to explain clinical and biological manifestations in severe COVID-19. The arguments to support this hypothesis are detailed. We also propose some strategies to verify the concordance of our hypothesis with the reality and the implications it could have, if verified, either for scientists and decision makers.","Zamd, Mohamed; Mtioui, Naoufal; Maoujoud, Omar; Ramdani, Benyounes",American journal of blood research,74,17

Better understanding of the epidemiology of these viruses combined with new rapid diagnostic techniques will provide more rapid and more reliable diagnosis of these agents in the future. Two agents not commonly thought of as causes of LRI in children (rhinoviruses, coronaviruses) should now be added to an already long list. Effective drugs exist for prophylaxis against influenza virus type A and therapy for influenza virus type A, type B, and RSV. While no new antiviral drugs are near clinical use at this time, new antiviral agents are constantly being tested and developed. High-titer, specific antiviral IVIG appears promising for both therapy and prophylaxis. Over the next decade, improved influenza virus vaccines and safe and effective vaccines against HPIV and RSV are expected. Adenoviral vaccines for use in immunocompromised patients are possible, but a generally available vaccine for all children is less likely. Although the basic clinical epidemiology of these viruses has been well investigated over the last 30 years, new molecular techniques are greatly expanding our understanding of these agents. Antigenic and genetic variation is being found in many viruses previously thought homogeneous. The exact role and biologic significance of this variation is just beginning to be explored, but already there is evidence of differences in pathogenicity and immunogenicity in many of these substrains.

Students were not allowed to attend school if their temperature readings were >37.8 degrees C for students < or =12 years old, or > or =37.5 degrees C for students >12 years old. These values had been arbitrarily determined with professional inputs. The aim of this study is to determine the reference ranges of normal oral temperatures of students in Singapore and recommend the cut-off values for febrile patients. This may be used in another similar outbreak of an infectious disease with fever. MATERIALS AND METHODS Four co-ed primary schools and 4 co-ed secondary schools were selected for this study. Four thousand and two hundred primary 1 to secondary 3 students responded (96.8%) and participated in this cross-sectional study. The mean ages of the students in the lowest (primary 1) and highest educational levels (secondary 3) were 7.4 years old and 15.3 years old, respectively. Twelve oral temperature readings per student (i.e. measurements taken 4 times a day in 3 consecutive days) were collected. Forty-six thousand seven hundred and eighty-three (92.8%) out of 50,400 temperature readings were used for the analysis as missing data were excluded. A quantile regression model was applied to estimate reference ranges of normal oral temperatures for students with adjustment for potential confounding factors. RESULTS The age-specific reference ranges of normal oral temperature from this study for students < or =12 years old and >12 years old were 35.7 degrees C to 37.7 degrees C and 35.6 degrees C to 37.4 degrees C, respectively. Temperatures of 37.8 degrees C and 37.5 degrees C are therefore recommended as the oral temperature cut-offs for those < or =12 years old and >12 years old, respectively. CONCLUSION This study has provided empirical data on normal oral temperature cut-offs which could be used during temperature screening in schools.","Kwang, Yoke Pin; Ma, Stefan; Chng, Seo Yi; Chia, Frances M L; Leong, Kam Kei","Annals of the Academy of Medicine, Singapore",74,20

Collecting such datasets is time-consuming and expensive. Until now, very few annotated COVID-19 imaging datasets are available. Although self-supervised learning enables us to bootstrap the training by exploiting unlabeled data, the generic self-supervised methods for natural images do not sufficiently incorporate the context. For medical images, a desirable method should be sensitive enough to detect deviation from normal-appearing tissue of each anatomical region; here, anatomy is the context. We introduce a novel approach with two levels of self-supervised representation learning objectives: one on the regional anatomical level and another on the patient-level. We use graph neural networks to incorporate the relationship between different anatomical regions. The structure of the graph is informed by anatomical correspondences between each patient and an anatomical atlas. In addition, the graph representation has the advantage of handling any arbitrarily sized image in full resolution. Experiments on large-scale Computer Tomography (CT) datasets of lung images show that our approach compares favorably to baseline methods that do not account for the context. We use the learnt embedding to quantify the clinical progression of COVID-19 and show that our method generalizes well to COVID-19 patients from different hospitals. Qualitative results suggest that our model can identify clinically relevant regions in the images.","Sun, Li; Yu, Ke; Batmanghelich, Kayhan",Proceedings of the ...

During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) lockdown of the Danish society, pregnant women were considered to be at increased risk, and access to antenatal care changed. METHODS On 8 April 2020A, a questionnaire was sent to 332 pregnant women previously sampled by general practitioners in two Danish regions. The women were contacted via secured e-mail (e-Boks), and questionnaires were returned until 6 May. RESULTS The questionnaire was returned by 257 women (77%). More than half believed that they were at a high risk of infection with COVID-19, and a third of the women were concerned about the risk of serious disease - especially for their unborn child. Almost 90% isolated at home most of the time. The majority were worried about possible consequences of the pandemic for antenatal care, but very few had actually missed a scheduled preventive consultation with their general practitioner, and only 15% had missed an appointment with their midwife. The majority of the women preferred normal consultations and found no added safety in shifting the consultation from the normal clinical setting.

METHODS: A non sistematic review was performed using literature published until May 23, 2020, using ""Uppertract urothelial tumours"", ""COVID-19"" and ""nephroureterectomy"".as keywords. The resulting manuscript was critically revised by national authors in order to establish common criteria about treatment and follow up. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Four studies were identified that assessed the impact of delaying radical nephrouretrectomy as curative treatment. These studies showed that surgery delays decrease overall survival and cancer specific survival rates in high-risk groups. On the other hand, delaying radical nephrouretrectomy due to ureteroscopy did not affect survival in cohorts of patients with predominately low-grade disease. CONCLUSIONS: A delay in curative treatment of upper tract urothelial tumours for more than three months results in adverse outcomes as overal survival and cancer specific survival. Hence, it is important to prioritize the timely care of this group of patients as far as COVID-19 pandemic allows it.","Galindo Herrero, Isabel; Pérez Fentes, Daniel; Ríos, Emilio; Martínez-Piñeiro, Luis; Palou, Joan; Breda, Alberto; Galante Romo, María Isabel",Archivos espanoles de urologia,74,32

This pilot study describes development of instrumentation and techniques for transabdominal preperitoneal (TAPP) herniorrhaphy using laser-assisted soldering technology. METHODS Anesthetized 20-kg to 25-kg female Yorkshire pigs underwent laparoscopy performed using a 3-trocar technique. Peritoneal incisions were made and pockets created in the preperitoneal space for mesh placement. Parietex TEC mesh segments embedded in 60% collagen-solder were soldered to the muscle surface by using a prototype laser (1.45micro, 4.5W CW, 5mm spot, and 55 degrees C set temperature) and custom laparoscopic handpiece. Parietex TEC mesh segments (Control) were affixed to the muscle with fibrin sealant (Tisseel). Peritoneal closure was with staples (Control) or by soldering collagen embedded Vicryl mesh segments over the peritoneal incision (Mesh/TAPP). Segments were inserted using a specially designed introducer. Animals were recovered and underwent second-look laparoscopy at 6 weeks postimplantation. Mesh sites were harvested after animals were euthanized. RESULTS The mesh-solder constructs were easily inserted and affixed in the TAPP approach. Tisseel tended to drip during application, particularly in vertical and ventral locations. Postoperative healing was similar to Control segments in all cases. Mesh/TAPP closures healed without scarring or adhesion formation. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION Collagen-based tissue soldering permits normal wound healing and may mitigate or reduce use of staples for laparoscopic mesh fixation and peritoneal closure. Laser-assisted mesh fixation and peritoneal closure is a promising alternative for laparoscopic herniorrhaphy. Further development of this strategy is warranted.","Lanzafame, Raymond J; Soltz, Barbara A; Stadler, Istvan; Soltz, Robert",JSLS : Journal of the Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons,74,17

DESIGN Cross-sectional postal survey. SETTING Province of Ontario, Canada. PARTICIPANTS Attending physicians and residents in four specialties at 15 teaching hospitals. INTERVENTIONS We used literature searches and focus groups to design questions related to NIV utilization with respect to frequency, location of and indications for use, awareness of supporting literature, and perceived efficacy. We assessed the survey's clinical sensibility and reliability. We used regression analyses to evaluate practice variation among hospitals and specialties and to determine predictors of more frequent NIV use, initiation of and continued use in nonmonitored settings, and use for specific indications. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Three hundred eighty-five (48%) of 808 physicians responded; 242 used NIV. The two most common indications for NIV use were chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and congestive heart failure. NIV guidelines, protocols, or policies were available in 12 of 15 hospitals. We found variation in NIV utilization among specialties but not hospitals. Specialty (critical care and respirology versus internal and emergency medicine), fewer years of postgraduate experience, and a greater number of noninvasive ventilators were predictors of more frequent NIV use (all p < or = .001). Only 6% of respondents reported initiation of use and continued use most frequently in nonmonitored settings, which increased with the number of noninvasive ventilators (p = .02). Physician characteristics such as awareness of the literature were predictive of NIV use for exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, whereas perceived NIV efficacy was predictive of use for many indications, including congestive heart failure. CONCLUSIONS Self-reported practice variation for bilevel NIV exists among specialties but not hospitals and differs with respect to frequency, location of use, and use for specific indications. Some factors associated with variation in NIV use may be suitable targets for utilization improvement interventions.","Burns, Karen E A; Sinuff, Tasnim; Adhikari, Neill K J; Meade, Maureen O; Heels-Ansdell, Diane; Martin, Claudio M; Cook, Deborah J",Critical care medicine,74,28

In this investigation, we tested 342 animals in the Republic of South Africa and Namibia, including 140 animals from wild populations, for evidence of FCoV infection by serology and/or reverse transcription/nested polymerase chain reaction (RT/nPCR) on feces from 1999 through 2001. Past or current infection was evaluated. Of these, 195 animals had evidence of infection and included 41 animals from wild populations. Serology (indirect immunofluorescence) did not always correlate with viral RNA detection, as seronegative animals were occasionally virus-positive, while many seropositive animals were not shedding virus. Serology indicated the infecting virus was most closely related to type I FCoV. Antibody levels in the majority of animals were low, even in those actively infected. Ten of 48 animals tested at more than one time point by RT/nPCR were shedding virus at multiple time points possibly indicating persistent infection. Infection in free-ranging animals was also notable, as over a quarter of the free-ranging animals tested had evidence of current or previous FCoV infection.

Scientists have found a relatively new way to detect influenza outbreaks early thus reducing the burden of disease by early intervention. This new technology is a social network information system which uses Facebook or Twitter data to detect potential influenza cases. Such system is good to be developed by the Malaysian government as it can detect influenza outbreaks three weeks earlier than the normal pathway. However, to implement this we require good evidence that the development will be accepted by potential users. OBJECTIVE This study was looking at the acceptance towards using social network information system among public health workers. MATERIALS AND METHOD This study was done on 205 Malaysian One Health University Network (MyOHUN) members through email and physical survey. RESULTS Results show that 62.4% public health workers accepted the use technology. The acceptance was shown to be associated with performance expectancy (p<0.05). However, unlike the very famous Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) model, the acceptance of social network information system was not associated with effort expectancy, social factors, facilitating conditions and socio-demographic factors. Therefore, it is suggested that social network information system be developed by the authorities in Malaysia, and be developed in a way that the system could strongly increase performance in detection of outbreak earlier than the current normal pathways. As such the system to be accepted and used, it must be sensitive, specific and be able to detect influenza outbreak early CONCLUSION: The development of social network information system is feasible as it is highly accepted and it's potential to improve early detection of influenza outbreak.","Sulaiman, M H; Aizuddin, A N; Hod, R; Puteh, S E W",The Medical journal of Malaysia,74,28
196146,196146,196146,Two murine coronavirus genes suffice for viral RNA synthesis.,9.769781,6.9920335,1995,"Coronavirus nucleocapsid (N) protein envelops the genomic RNA to form long helical nucleocapsid during virion assembly. Since N protein oligomerization is usually a crucial step in this process, characterization of such an oligomerization will help in the understanding of the possible mechanisms for nucleocapsid formation. The N protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was recently discovered to self-associate by its carboxyl terminus. In this study, to further address the detailed understanding of the association feature of this C-terminus, its oligomerization was systematically investigated by size exclusion chromatography and chemical cross-linking assays. Our results clearly indicated that the C-terminal domain of SARS-CoV N protein could form not only dimers but also trimers, tetramers, and hexamers. Further analyses against six deletion mutants showed that residues 343-402 were necessary and sufficient for this C-terminus oligomerization. Although this segment contains many charged residues, differences in ionic strength have no effects on its oligomerization, indicating the absence of electrostatic force in SARS-CoV N protein C-terminus self-association. Gel shift assay results revealed that the SARS-CoV N protein C-terminus is also able to associate with nucleic acids and residues 363-382 are the responsible interaction partner, demonstrating that this fragment might involve genomic RNA binding sites. The fact that nucleic acid binding could promote the SARS-CoV N protein C-terminus to form high-order oligomers implies that the oligomeric SARS-CoV N protein probably combines with the viral genomic RNA in triggering long nucleocapsid formation.","Luo, Haibin; Chen, Jing; Chen, Kaixian; Shen, Xu; Jiang, Hualiang",Biochemistry,74,28

METHODS Clinical data of 1291 patients with SARS from March to July 2003 in Beijing City were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS In patients with SARS, the absolute numbers of white blood cells, lymphocytes and CD(3), CD(4) and CD(8) lymphocyte subsets decreased during the early period of the disease, being manifested in 56.91%, 88.26%, 47.96%, 45.56% and 41.10% of the patients, respectively. During the first 3 days the median numbers of CD(3), CD(4) and CD(8) were 425 x 10(6)/L, 223 x 10(6)/L, 170 x 10(6)/L, respectively, being the lowest values in the course of the disease. During the second week the corresponding numbers were 536 x 10(6)/L, 267 x 10(6)/L, 224 x 10(6)/L, respectively; they returned to normal by the fourth week (P < 0.05), showing a trend of gradual increase during the disease progression. Comparison of different time points of the same cases also showed that CD(3), CD(4) and CD(8) were lowest in the first 1 - 3 days. The median number of CD(3) was higher (954 x 10(6)/L) during week 3, and there was no significant difference among other 3 weeks (P > 0.05). In the early period of the disease the CRP increased but ESR, C(3) and C(4) were still in normal ranges. CONCLUSIONS In the early period of SARS, the WBC, lymphocytes, CD(3), CD(4) and CD(8) lymphocyte subsets decreased remarkably, and they tended to increase as the disease progressed. Simultaneous decreases in CD(3), CD(4) and CD(8) during the first week is a characteristic immunological change, which may facilitate the early diagnosis of SARS.","Huang, Ci-bo; Wang, Qian; Xie, Gao-qiang; Liu, Ai-hua; Lai, Bei; Chen, Ying-juan; Cheng, Yong-jing; Xu, Hua; Han, De-min",Zhonghua nei ke za zhi,74,19

Different degrees of scientific collaboration and sectoral integration are needed for different types of zoonotic diseases, depending on the health and associated economic gains that can be expected from a One Health approach. Indeed, mitigating zoonotic risks related to emerging diseases with pandemic potential is different from mitigating risks related to endemic zoonotic diseases like brucellosis. Likewise, management of brucellosis at the wildlife-livestock interface in wildlife conservation areas is in essence different from mitigating transmission of a given Brucella species within its preferential host species, which in turn is different from mitigating the spillover of a given Brucella species to non-preferential host species, humans included. Brucellosis economic models often oversimplify and/or wrongly assess transmission between reservoir hosts and spillover hosts. Moreover,they may not properly value non-market outcomes, such as avoidance of human disease, consumer confidence and conservation biology issues. As a result, uncertainty is such that the economic predictions of these models can be questionable. Therefore, understanding the infection biology of Brucella species is a prerequisite.

Objectives This shift gave our Department of Psychiatry a chance to better understand key challenges and opportunities vis-à-vis virtual mental healthcare. We aimed to obtain provider feedback on the use of telepsychiatry and to learn from the provider perspective about patient experiences with video visits. This information will be used to inform the telemedicine strategy at a systems level within our psychiatry department, our academic health system, as well as the field of telemedicine as a whole. Design and Sample A 22-item online questionnaire comprising 16 quantitative and six qualitative items was distributed to providers currently using video visits to provide care. Results A total of 89 mental health providers completed the questionnaire. Outcomes demonstrated that while providers perceive challenges associated with virtual care (e.g., fatigue, technology-related issues, and age-related concerns), they also recognize a number of benefits to themselves and their patients (e.g., convenience and increased access). Overall, provider satisfaction, comfort, and willingness to use telepsychiatry was high. Conclusions The vast majority of providers adapted quickly to the use of virtual platforms; many endorse advantages that suggest virtual care will continue to be a modality they provide in the future, post-COVID-19.

METHODS Between March and July 2020, 1,237 participants were surveyed on 5 widely disseminated COVID-19 rumours (drinking water frequently could be preventive, eating garlic could be preventive, the outbreak arose because of bat soup consumption, the virus was created in an American lab, and the virus was created in a Chinese lab). For each rumour, participants reported whether they had heard, shared or believed each rumour. RESULTS Although most participants had been exposed to COVID-19 rumours, few shared or believed these. Sharing behaviours sometimes occurred in the absence of belief; however, education emerged as a protective factor for both sharing and belief. CONCLUSION Our results suggest that campaigns targeting skills associated with higher education (e.g. epistemology) may prove more effective than counter-rumour messages.","Long, Victoria J E; Koh, Wei Shien; Saw, Young Ern; Liu, Jean Cj","Annals of the Academy of Medicine, Singapore",74,26

The cycle threshold (Ct) values were expected to have an association with clinical manifestation. However, the diagnostic modalities such as quantitative molecular detection and virus isolation were not yet available for the routine test. This study has been conducted to analyze the relationship between the Ct values of qualitative rRT-PCR and the clinical manifestation and to describe the factors determining the result. METHODS from March to April 2020, specimens were sent to our laboratory from different healthcare centers in Jakarta. The patient's characteristic and clinical manifestation were extracted from the specimen's epidemiology forms. The specimens extracted and tested using rRT-PCR, and the Ct value were collected. The data were analyzed using the appropriate statistic test. RESULTS from 339 positive results, the mild to moderate case was 176 (52%) and the severe cases was 163 (48%). Female was dominant in the mild to moderate cases (58%), while the male was prevalent in the severe cases (60%). The median age for mild to moderate case was 35 years old and severe cases was 49 years old. Statistical analysis found relationship between both group with gender (p = 0.001) and age (p < 0.001), but not with the Ct value. CONCLUSION many variables in specimen sampling and processing could affect the Ct value result. In addition, the disease's severity was depended with the host immune response, regardless the number of virus. There was suggested no significant difference between the Ct values of mild-moderate and severe COVID-19, and thus should not be loosely interpreted.","Ibrahim, Fera; Natasha, Augustine; Saharman, Yulia Rosa; Yasmon, Andi; Fithriyah, Fithriyah; Karuniawati, Anis; Ganiesa, Selvia; Sudarmono, Pratiwi",Acta medica Indonesiana,74,31

In the region representing nucleotide positions 4919-5677 upstream from the initiation codon of the 32K non-structural protein gene, we identified two putative functional domains. One of these domains contained four leucine residues repeated exactly in every seventh position, and the other domain represented a cluster of cysteine and histidine residues. The DNA sequence representing these domains was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli as fusion proteins with glutathione S-transferase from Schistosoma japonicum. A high level expression of the cysteine-rich domain was achieved as a fusion protein when the bacterial culture was induced with IPTG. In a solid phase zinc binding assay using the recombinant fusion protein, we found that the protein containing the cysteine-rich domain was able to bind to radioactive zinc in vitro, demonstrating that the polypeptide encoded by the ORF1b of coronavirus is a zinc-binding protein.","Yoo, D; Parker, M D; Cox, G J; Babiuk, L A",Advances in experimental medicine and biology,74,29

The aim of this study was to determine whether implementation of a hands-on mentorship model could provide safe skill transfer for transabdominal preperitoneal (TAPP) repair. METHODS A trainee who had no experience with TAPP repair underwent operative tutorials until the mentor judged that the trainee could carry out the operation independently. Ten patients who underwent an elective TAPP repair were prospectively enrolled in this study. RESULTS No cases had over 5 mL of bleeding, intraoperative/postoperative complications, or recurrence. There were significant differences in operation times between the first 4 cases and the later 5 cases, except for a bilateral inguinal hernia case. CONCLUSION A prospective, single-arm, single-center, case series showed the feasibility of safe skill transfer for TAPP repair using a hands-on mentorship model.","Yamazaki, Masashi; Nomura, Eiji; Uchida, Kazunori; Higami, Shigeo; Noguchi, Wataru; Uda, Shuji; Yamamoto, Soichiro; Tobita, Kosuke; Mukai, Masaya; Makuuchi, Hiroyasu",The Tokai journal of experimental and clinical medicine,74,17

To be more precise the procedure involves the application of powered smallpox scabs or fluid obtained from the pustules of the infected patients. This application is on the superficial scratches made on the skin surface of normal healthy individuals.3 Thus, the variolation is the process in which the virus is inoculated in the patient to produce an antibody response. This process produces signs and symptoms similar to the intended viral infection but usually of the milder form, possibly due to mild quantum exposure of virus particles. In the case of smallpox, this methodology was first used in China, India, and the Middle East before it was introduced into England and North America in the 1720s.4 Due to advancements done in the field of vaccination, this crude method is no longer used today. However, this process was a milestone in science that has led to the development of many vaccines available nowadays.","Sharma, Nilesh K; Sarode, Sachin C; Sarode, Gargi; Patil, Shankargouda",The journal of contemporary dental practice,74,17

By contrast, studies in B cell-deficient (muMT) mice revealed Abs as key effectors in suppressing virus recrudescence. The apparent loss of initial T cell-mediated immune control in the absence of B cells was investigated by comparing T cell populations in CNS mononuclear cells from infected muMT and wild-type mice. Following viral recrudescence in muMT mice, total CD8(+) T cell numbers were similar to those of wild-type mice that had cleared infectious virus; however, virus-specific T cells were reduced at least 3-fold by class I tetramer and IFN-gamma ELISPOT analysis. Although overall T cell recruitment into the CNS of muMT mice was not impaired, discrepancies in frequencies of virus-specific CD8(+) T cells were most severe during acute infection. Impaired ex vivo cytolytic activity of muMT CNS mononuclear cells, concomitant with reduced frequencies, implicated IFN-gamma as the primary anti viral factor early in infection. Reduced virus-specific CD8(+) T cell responses in the CNS coincided with poor peripheral expansion and diminished CD4(+) T cell help. Thus, in addition to the lack of Ab, limited CD8(+) and CD4(+) T cell responses in muMT mice contribute to the ultimate loss of control of CNS infection. Using a model of virus infection restricted to the CNS, the results provide novel evidence for a role of B cells in regulating T cell expansion and differentiation into effector cells.","Bergmann, C C; Ramakrishna, C; Kornacki, M; Stohlman, S A",Journal of immunology,74,17

BACKGROUND The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome in 2003 resulted in a fatality rate of approximately 11%. Nurses in hospitals caring for patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome maintained close contact with the infected patients. The high risk of infection and death associated with caring for patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome had a great impact on nurse retention in hospitals. Nurse turnover in many countries where these outbreaks occurred has been high since the first outbreak occurred in March 2003. METHODS Three hundred and thirty nurses working at a Taiwan hospital during the time of the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak completed the Meyer, Allen & Smith Organizational and Occupational Commitment Scales, Intention to Leave and Perceived Stress of Infection Scales between July and August 2003. RESULTS All three components of occupational and organizational commitments were negatively associated with nurses' intentions to leave the nursing profession and the organization. Nurses' perceptions of the possibility of acquiring severe acute respiratory syndrome infection through caring for these patients had a moderating effect on the relationship between commitment and the intention to leave. CONCLUSIONS Perceived risk to life from infection has a possible influence on the commitment/intention-to-leave model in hospital nurses caring for patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome, and this information can inform hospital and nursing managers about nurse retention following a severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak and the management of commitment in the context of nursing human resources management.","Chang, Chao-Sung; Du, Pey-Lan; Huang, Ing-Chung",Journal of advanced nursing,74,11

High ε levels have been associated with ventilator-associated lung injury (VALI). While both whole lung and regional EELV may be affected by changes in positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), regional variations are not revealed by conventional respiratory system measurements. Differential rates of deflation of adjacent lung units due to regional variation in expiratory time constants (τE) may create localized regions of ε that are significantly greater than implied by whole lung measures. We used functional respiratory imaging (FRI) in an ex vivo porcine lung model to: (i) demonstrate that computed tomography (CT)-based imaging studies can be used to assess global and regional values of ε and τE and, (ii) demonstrate that the manipulation of PEEP will cause measurable changes in total and regional ε and τE values. Our study provides three insights into lung mechanics. First, image-based measurements reveal egional variation that cannot be detected by traditional methods such as spirometry. Second, the manipulation of PEEP causes global and regional changes in R, E, ε and τE values. Finally, regional ε and τE were correlated in several lobes, suggesting the possibility that regional τE could be used as a surrogate marker for regional ε.","Henderson, William R; Molgat-Seon, Yannick; Vos, Wim; Lipson, Rachel; Ferreira, Francisca; Kirby, Miranda; Holsbeke, Cedric Van; Dominelli, Paolo B; Griesdale, Donald E G; Sekhon, Mypinder; Coxson, Harvey O; Mayo, John; Sheel, A William",Physiological reports,74,1

It introduces the use of chicken egg yolk antibody (IgY) solutions in the prevention and cure of viral and bacterial infections. Application for the protection against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), rotavirus, and influenza viruses, as well as for the eradication of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, caries, various enteric bacteria and other pathogens, and toxins have been developed. This approach is a fast, reliable, safe, and tested method for producing molecular shield and protection against emerging pathogens and epidemics. In the current pandemic situation caused by coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), this method of passive immunization could be applied for rapid protection against modifiable agents. The specific IgY antibodies start to accumulate into egg yolks about 3 weeks after the immunization of the chicken. The product can be collected safely, as the antigen is not found in the eggs. This method for microbial safety uses natural means and commonly used food substances, which have been tested and could be produced for both blocking epidemics and applying personalized medicine.","Hakalehto, Elias",The Israel Medical Association journal : IMAJ,74,5

DATA SOURCES Statutory notification data, local tuberculosis programme data, and census data were reviewed. Literature search of PubMed was performed up to December 2005. STUDY SELECTION Original and major review articles related to tuberculosis among health care workers and guidelines for prevention were reviewed. DATA EXTRACTION Relevant data were extracted from our literature review and local sources. DATA SYNTHESIS Earlier experimental data demonstrated an airborne spread of tuberculosis and a steady state mathematical model for quantification of the transmission risk. In the post-chemotherapy era in developed countries, few studies demonstrated an occupational risk of tuberculin conversion outside of outbreak settings, and few studies were able to conclusively demonstrate an increased risk of active tuberculosis among health care workers. In countries with limited resource, the situation may be different, with a higher tuberculosis incidence among health care workers. Local tuberculosis programme and notification data from the Labour Department did not show an increased risk of active tuberculosis among health care workers. Although administrative control, engineering control, and personal protection are widely accepted control measures, it is difficult to quantify their cost-effectiveness. CONCLUSIONS Although an increased liability to tuberculosis among health care workers is expected due to the concentration of infectious patients in their environment, prompt diagnosis and initiation of treatment may minimise the risk. A high background rate of disease and possible healthy worker effect may make it difficult to pick up a small risk differential. With the ongoing threat of a nosocomial outbreak, continuing vigilance is called for.","Tam, C M; Leung, C C",Hong Kong medical journal = Xianggang yi xue za zhi,74,24

Almost identical results were obtained for the two isolates, which were derived from cases of PEDV infection in Belgium and Britain in 1977 and 1987, respectively. The sequences contained a 1323 nucleotide (nt) open reading frame (ORF), which showed moderate identity to the nucleocapsid (N) gene of other coronaviruses. The greatest similarity at both the nucleic acid and protein levels was to the human coronavirus 229E. The PEDV N gene was, however, notably larger than that of the human 229E and porcine transmissible gastroenteritis viruses. This reflects the presence of a putative insertion of approximately 135 nt located towards the middle of the N gene. A second 336 nt ORF, which might encode a leucine-rich protein similar to, but shorter than, the bovine coronavirus internal protein was found within the PEDV N gene. Several RNA motifs typical of coronaviruses were also observed.

In this narrative review, we aim to discuss the usefulness of ACE2-derived peptides in the infection sustained by SARS-CoV-2. METHODS A total of 49 papers pertinent to the purpose of the review were selected from the PubMed and Google Scholar databases. Clinical trials registered at ClinicalTrials.gov and dealing with the use of ACE2-derived medications in COVID-19 were also searched and discussed. RESULTS Preclinical and clinical evidence shows that drugs mimicking or potentiating the effects of ACE2 may reduce the viral load and dampen the inflammatory and fibrotic pathways leading to respiratory distress. ACE2-derived therapeutic peptides may have a better pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile than other ACE2-based medications. They could be easily screened through peptide libraries and chemically modified in order to ameliorate the pharmacological properties. Furthermore, their local administration via an intranasal delivery or inhalation may reduce the risk of systemic side effects, thus conferring a good safety profile. CONCLUSION ACE2-derived peptides may play a dual beneficial role in COVID-19, by either preventing virus spread or inhibiting the secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators in airways. Viral, host, and environmental factors may affect the effectiveness of this therapeutic approach to a various extent and represent therefore a matter of investigation for future studies.","Talotta, Rossella; Roberston, Erle S",American journal of clinical and experimental immunology,74,1

All 15 hemagglutinin subtypes replicated in pheasants, and most subtypes transmitted to naïve contact pheasants, primarily via the fecal-oral route. Many viruses were shed from the gastrointestinal tract of experimentally inoculated pheasants for 14 days or longer. Virus was isolated from the cloacal swabs of one contact pheasant for an unprecedented 45 days. Chukar partridges were less susceptible to infection with avian influenza viruses. The viruses that replicated in chukar partridges were isolated for 7 days after experimental inoculation, predominantly from the respiratory tract. We detected high neutralizing antibody titers with correspondingly low levels of serum hemagglutination inhibition antibody titers in pheasants and chukar partridges when chicken red blood cells were used in serological analyses. When horse erythrocytes were used, antibody titers were comparable to those obtained by using the neutralization assay. More importantly, the results suggested that pheasants can serve as a reservoir of influenza virus. Because of their continuous asymptomatic infection and longer stay in the markets, pheasants are ideal ""carriers"" of influenza A viruses. Their continued presence in live markets contributes to the perpetuation and genetic interaction of influenza viruses there. On the basis of our findings, it does not make good sense to ban quail but not pheasants from the live markets.","Humberd, Jennifer; Guan, Yi; Webster, Robert G",Journal of virology,74,8

This study examined if SARS may result in cardiovascular complications. METHODS AND RESULTS 121 patients (37.5 (SD13.2) years, 36% male) diagnosed to have SARS were assessed continuously for blood pressure, pulse, and temperature during their stay in hospital. Hypotension occurred in 61 (50.4%) patients in hospital, and was found in 28.1%, 21.5%, and 14.8% of patients during the first, second, and third week, respectively. Only one patient who had transient echocardiographic evidence of impaired left ventricular systolic function required temporary inotropic support. Tachycardia was present in 87 (71.9%) patients, and was found in 62.8%, 45.4%, and 35.5% of patients from the first to third week. It occurred independent of hypotension, and could not be explained by the presence of fever. Tachycardia was also present in 38.8% of patients at follow up. Bradycardia only occurred in 18 (14.9%) patients as a transient event. Reversible cardiomegaly was reported in 13 (10.7%) patients, but without clinical evidence of heart failure. Transient atrial fibrillation was present in one patient. Corticosteroid therapy was weakly associated with tachycardia during the second (chi(2) = 3.99, p = 0.046) and third week (chi(2) = 6.53, p = 0.01), although it could not explain tachycardia during follow up.

The mRNAs are produced by a discontinuous transcription in which the leader is linked to the mRNA coding sequences. This process is regulated by transcription-regulating sequences (TRSs) preceding each mRNA, including a highly conserved core sequence (CS) with high identity to sequences present in the virus genome and at the 3' end of the leader (TRS-L). The role of TRSs was analyzed by reverse genetics using a full-length infectious coronavirus cDNA and site-directed mutagenesis of the CS. The canonical CS-B was nonessential for the generation of subgenomic mRNAs (sgmRNAs), but its presence led to transcription levels at least 10(3)-fold higher than those in its absence. The data obtained are compatible with a transcription mechanism including three steps: (i) formation of 5'-3' complexes in the genomic RNA, (ii) base-pairing scanning of the nascent negative RNA strand by the TRS-L, and (iii) template switching during synthesis of the negative strand to complete the negative sgRNA. This template switch takes place after copying the CS sequence and was predicted in silico based on high base-pairing score between the nascent negative RNA strand and the TRS-L and minimum DeltaG.","Zúñiga, Sonia; Sola, Isabel; Alonso, Sara; Enjuanes, Luis",Journal of virology,74,24

Newer viruses are still being discovered and those that are already known are being incriminated in the aetiology of clinical conditions with hitherto unknown causes. Apart from frequently causing infections in the general community, many types of viruses are also significant nosocomial pathogens. While it is generally agreed that we underestimate the proportion of nosocomial infections that are viral, due to a lack of routine monitoring, viruses easily account for more than 30% of the cases of hospital-acquired infections in many paediatric settings. Indeed, the relative importance of viruses in this respect is increasing due to a number of societal and demographic changes as well as alterations in healthcare practices. Safe vaccines against many common nosocomial viral agents are currently unavailable while there is also a virtual lack of effective and affordable chemotherapy against them. There is, therefore, renewed emphasis on preventive strategies by better understanding of the relative importance of various vehicles in the nosocomial spread of viruses and by infection control using microbicides. This, in turn, has stimulated considerable interest in the development of formulations that are not only safer but which also have demonstrated activity against major types of nosocomial viral pathogens. Further, much work is now underway to design better methods to assess the virucidal activity of microbicides used to decontaminate hands, reusable medical devices and environmental surfaces in critical areas of healthcare settings. It is anticipated that these approaches will result in reducing the health and economic impact of nosocomial infections due to viruses.","Sattar, S A",The Journal of hospital infection,74,16

Based on this observation, we postulated that hUCBDSCs might promote megakaryocytopoiesis. to test this hypothesis, we developed a megakaryocyte/hUCBDSC co-culture model and a hematopoietic microenvironment injury model in nude mice. We explored the ability and mechanisms by which hUCBDSCs promoted the proliferation of megakaryocytes in vitro, and we also explored their capacity to restore the hematopoietic microenvironment in vivo. As expected, hUCBDSCs were more efective than hBMSCs at enhancing the proliferation of megakaryocyte lines from HeL cells and restoring megakaryocytopoiesis in a hematopoietic microenvironment injury model in nude mice. thrombopoietin (tpo) and stromal cell derived factor-1 (SDF-1) are two of the key factors underlying this capacity. We also found that gap junction intercellular communication (GJIC) between HeL cells and hUCBDSCs might be partially absent. our data provide the first evidence that hUCBDSCs play a regulatory role during megakaryocytopoiesis, which might be important for designing treatments for patients with megakaryocytic injury.","Gao, Lei; Chen, Xing-Hua; Feng, Yi-Mei; Zhang, Xi; Yu, Shi-Cang; Gao, Li; Zhang, Cheng; Liang, Xue; Peng, Xian-Gui; Wang, Qing-Yu",Cell cycle,74,20

At the early stage of the outbreak, the government of Bangladesh imposed lockdown and quarantine approaches to prevent the spread of the virus, which impacted people's daily life and health. The COVID-19 pandemic has also affected people's economic status, healthcare facilities and other lifestyle factors in Bangladesh. We aimed to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health among the Bangladeshi population. METHODS: We conducted an online cross-sectional survey among 672 Bangladeshi people aged between 15 and 65 years all over the country from 15 April to 10 May 2020. After obtaining electronic consent, we conducted a survey assessing people's sociodemographic profiles and psychometric measures. We used The University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) Loneliness Scale-8, Patient Health Questionnaire-9, Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-Item Scale and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index to assess loneliness, depression, anxiety and sleep disturbance, respectively. RESULTS: The prevalence of loneliness, depression, anxiety and sleep disturbance was estimated at 71% (mild: 32%, moderate: 29%, severe: 10%), 38% (mild: 24%, moderate: 11%, severe: 3%), 64% (mild: 30%, moderate: 17%, severe: 17%) and 73% (mild: 50%, moderate: 18%, severe: 5%), respectively. In Bangladesh, the key factors associated with poor mental health during COVID-19 were female sex, unemployment, being a student, obesity and living without a family. The present study also identified statistically significant interrelationships among the measured mental health issues. CONCLUSIONS: A large portion of respondents reported mental health problems during the COVID-19 pandemic in Bangladesh. The present study suggests longitudinal assessments of mental health among Bangladeshi people to determine the gravity of this issue during and after the pandemic. Appropriate supportive programmes and interventional approaches would address mental health problems in Bangladesh during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Das, Rajesh; Hasan, Md Rakib; Daria, Sohel; Islam, Md Rabiul",BMJ Open,74,20

This study analyzes state-level geographical distribution of COVID-19 cases and age distribution of Obstetricians and gynecologists (OB/GYNs) to project which US regions will experience a more significant COVID-19 patient burden and provides a guide for vaccine distribution in the OB/GYN workforce. Methods The Association of American Medical Colleges' state-level workforce data is combined with COVID-19 case data reported by Johns Hopkins University. All data and code are available at https://github.com/cxr244/covid-obgyn. Results Our findings illustrate that OB/GYNs in the Midwestern region of the US experience the highest number of COVID-19 patients per OB/GYN over 60 years of age: North Dakota, South Dakota, Iowa, Wisconsin, and Idaho have the highest burden of COVID-19 patients per OB/GYN, warranting vaccine distribution priority. Additionally, states with the highest proportion of OB/GYNs over the age of 60 like Florida (38%), New Mexico (37%), Alabama (36%), California (36%), and New Jersey (34%), should be strongly considered for priority vaccine allocation, to mitigate predicted OB/GYN workforce shortages. Conclusion When planning and executing vaccine allocation, especially in the early stages of distribution, it is critical to evaluate which communities can benefit the greatest from the limited number of vaccines. A strategy of distribution of COVID-19 vaccines to older physicians with a more significant COVID-19 burden can minimize shortages of providers within these states and ensure adequate access to women's healthcare within the communities they serve.","Shastri, T.; Rasendran, C.; Markwei, M.; Hur, C.; Goje, O.",Cureus,74,24

We develop a genetic algorithm technique to identify key model parameters employing COVID19 data from South Korea. Stability, bifurcations and dynamic behavior are analyzed. Parametric analysis reveals conditions for sustained epidemic equilibria to occur.

To assess whether self-reported perceptions of COVID-19 and personal characteristics are associated with protective behaviors among general adults and to compare patterns in six different countries. METHODS: This cross-sectional study uses the secondary data collected through an online survey between 15 and 23 April 2020 across six countries (China, Italy, Japan, Korea, the UK, and the USA). A total of 5945 adults aged 18 years or older were eligible for our analysis. A logistic regression model was used to estimate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) of three recommended behaviors (wearing a mask, handwashing, and avoiding social gatherings). RESULTS: In most countries except for China, the participants who perceived wearing a mask as being extremely effective to curtail the pandemic were more likely to wear a mask (OR, 95%CI: Italy: 4.14, 2.08-8.02; Japan: 3.59, 1.75-7.30; Korea: 7.89, 1.91-31.63: UK: 9.23, 5.14-17.31; USA: 4.81, 2.61-8.92). Those who perceived that handwashing was extremely effective had higher ORs of this preventive behavior (OR, 95%CI: Italy: 16.39, 3.56-70.18; Japan: 12.24, 4.03-37.35; Korea: 12.41, 2.02-76.39; UK: 18.04, 2.60-152.78; USA: 10.56, 2.21-44.32). The participants who perceived avoiding social gathering as being extremely effective to curtail the pandemic were more likely to take this type of preventive behavior (OR, 95%CI: China: 3.79, 1.28-10.23; Korea: 6.18, 1.77-20.60; UK: 4.45, 1.63-11.63; USA: 4.34, 1.84-9.95). The associations between personal characteristics, living environment, psychological status, and preventive behaviors varied across different countries. Individuals who changed their behavior because of recommendations from doctors/public health officials were more likely to take preventive behaviors in many countries. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that higher perceived effectiveness may be a common factor to encourage preventive behaviors in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. These results may provide a better understanding of the homogeneity and heterogeneity of factors related to preventive behaviors and improve public health policies in various countries and groups.","Fujii, Ryosuke; Suzuki, Kensuke; Niimi, Junichiro",Environ Health Prev Med,74,1

At the same time, many graduate-prepared nurses lack preparation in teaching and pedagogical frameworks. PROBLEM: Literature on how PhD programs in nursing prepare graduates for teaching indicates that there is typically more emphasis on research than pedagogical learning. APPROACH: With the shift to remote learning under the COVID-19 pandemic, the University of California Irvine created a Graduate Fellows program to provide support to faculty while offering graduate students education in pedagogy and remote learning. OUTCOMES: Fellows were satisfied and reported increased understanding of challenges in teaching and increasing comfort with nurse faculty roles. CONCLUSIONS: The collaborative efforts of fellows and faculty provided important resources at a critical time, and insights gained can inform similar projects in nursing faculty development.","Burton, Candace W; Rodrigues, Sarah M; Jones-Patten, Alexandria E; Ju, Eunae; Abrahim, Heather L; Saatchi, Babak; Wilcox, Stephen P; Bender, Miriam",Nurse educ,74,1

This reconstruction has several applications, from helping patients with neurodegenerative diseases recall past events to gathering clues from multiple sources to identify recent contacts and places visited - a critical new application for the current health crisis. This paper takes steps towards integrating, connecting and summarizing the heterogeneous collection of data into episodic narratives using scripts - prototypical plans for everyday activities. Specifically, we propose a matching algorithm that groups several digital traces from many different sources into script instances (episodes), and we provide a technique for ranking the likelihood of candidate episodes. We report on the results of a study based on the personal data of real users, which gives evidence that our episode reconstruction technique 1) successfully integrates and combines traces from different sources into coherent episodes, and 2) augments users' memory of their past actions.","Kalokyri, Varvara; Borgida, Alexander; Marian, Am'elie",,74,29

Methods: Epidemiological investigation was conducted to collect the information of confirmed COVID-19 cases, including demographic, epidemiological and clinical information. Results: As of 25 February 2020, a total of 91 confirmed COVID-19 cases had been reported in Gansu. The epidemic of COVID-19 in Gansu can be divided as three different stages, i.e. imported case stage, imported-case plus indigenous case stage, and indigenous case stage. A total of 63 cases were clustered cases (69.23%), 3 cases were medical staff infected with non-occupational exposure. The initial symptoms included fever (54.95%, 50/91), cough (52.75%, 48/91), or fatigue (28.57%, 26/91), the proportion of each symptom showed a decreasing trend along with the three epidemic stages, but only the differences in proportions of fever (trend &#967;2=2.20, P<0.05) and fatigue (trend &#967;2=3.18, P<0.05) among the three epidemic stages were statistically significant. The cases with critical severe symptoms accounted for 42.85% (6/14), 23.73% (14/59) and 16.67% (3/18), respectively, in three epidemic stages, showed a decreasing trend (H=6.45, P<0.05). Also, the incubation period prolonged along with the epidemic stage (F=51.65, P<0.01), but the intervals between disease onset and hospital visit (F=5.32, P<0.01), disease onset and diagnosis (F=5.25, P<0.01) became shorter along with the epidemic stage. Additionally, the basic reproduction number (R0) had decreased from 2.61 in imported case stage to 0.66 in indigenous case stage. Conclusions: The COVID-19 epidemic in Gansu was caused by the imported cases, and about 2/3 cases were clustered ones. No medical worker was observed to be infected by occupational exposure. With the progression of COVID-19 epidemic in Gansu, the change in initial symptom and incubation period suggests, the early screening cannot only depend on body temperature monitoring.","Gou, F X; Zhang, X S; Yao, J X; Yu, D S; Wei, K F; Zhang, H; Yang, X T; Yang, J J; Liu, H X; Cheng, Y; Jiang, X J; Zheng, Y H; Wu, B; Liu, X F; Li, H",Zhonghua Liu Xing Bing Xue Za Zhi,74,16

Renal patients undergoing hemodialysis run the risk not only of suffering but also of transmitting and spreading COVID-19 due to multiple factors, both procedural and logistical, associated with the process. These include the long duration of the technique, collective transfer to and from the centres, and the waiting time before performing the technique, aspects that make strict isolation difficult and therefore increase not only the risk of contagion between patients but also between specialist health professionals, which makes it more difficult to replace professionals. Prevention, protection, detection, isolation and distribution measures are essential in the management of the epidemic and must be taken from the initial stage.

Of the extracellular vesicles, exosomes are the most widely sorted and extensively explored for their contents and function. The size of the nanovesicular structures (exosomes) range from 30 to 140 nm and are present in various biological fluids such as saliva, plasma, urine etc. These cargo-laden extracellular vesicles arise from endosome-derived multivesicular bodies and are known to carry proteins and nucleic acids. Exosomes are involved in multiple physiological and pathological processes, including cellular senescence. Exosomes mediate signaling crosstalk and play a critical role in cell-cell communications. Exosomes have evolved as potential biomarkers for aging-related diseases. Aging, a physiological process, involves a progressive decline of function of organs with a loss of homeostasis and increasing probability of illness and death. The review focuses on the classic view of exosome biogenesis, biology, and age-associated changes. Owing to their ability to transport biological information among cells, the review also discusses the interplay of senescent cell-derived exosomes with the aging process, including the susceptibility of the aging population to COVID-19 infections.","Saheera, Sherin; Potnuri, Ajay Godwin; Krishnamurthy, Prasanna",,74,20

Cognitive impairment in patients with spinocerebellar ataxia type 12 has not been evaluated. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cognitive impairment in patients diagnosed with spinocerebellar ataxia type 12 (SCA12). METHODS: We conducted a cross sectional study and enrolled 30 (20 male and 10 female) genetically confirmed SCA12 patients and 30 healthy, age, gender and education matched individuals as controls. Cognitive domains were tested using a battery of validated neurocognitive tests. RESULT: Mean age of patients was 51.6 ± 8.0 years and mean disease duration was 5.3 ± 3.0 years. Mean International Cooperative Ataxia Rating Scale (ICARS) score was 29.8 ± 12.5. SCA 12 patients scored significantly lower than controls in executive function and new learning ability. Other tested cognitive domains were also affected but did not reach statistical significance. Age, age at onset, severity of ataxia, disease duration and CAG repeat length did not correlate with cognitive impairment. CONCLUSION: Cognitive impairment is a part of the spectrum of SCA12 and is characterized by dysfunction in executive function and new learning ability even early in the course of disease.","Agarwal, Amit; Kaur, Harsimarpreet; Agarwal, Ayush; Nehra, Ashima; Pandey, Shivam; Garg, Ajay; Faruq, Mohammed; Rajan, Roopa; Shukla, Garima; Goyal, Vinay; Srivastava, Achal Kumar",Parkinsonism Relat Disord,74,16

The first approach is more goal-focused while the latter is more autonomy-focused. Here we compared these two approaches in motor performance and psychological outcomes. Nineteen resistance-trained participants (10-males) first completed one repetition-maximum (RM) tests in the barbell-squat and bench-press, and were familiarized with the isometric mid-thigh pull (IMTP). In the next two counterbalanced sessions, participants completed two sets of the squat and bench-press using 70%1RM, and two sets of the IMTP. In the predetermined session, participants completed 10 repetitions in all sets, and in the self-selected session, participants chose how many repetitions to complete out of an 8-12 range. Bar-velocity was measured in the squat and bench-press, and force production in the IMTP. Enjoyment, perceived-autonomy, and approach-preferences were collected post-sessions. We observed comparable bar-velocity, force production, and enjoyment in both conditions (all BF01 > 2.1), and an even approach-preferences split. However, in the self-selected condition, participants demonstrated considerable variability in the number of repetitions and reported greater perceived-autonomy.

This study examines the risks that the COVID-19 pandemic poses to equitable access to essential medicines and vaccines (EMV) for universal health coverage in Africa. METHODS: We searched medical databases and grey literature up to 2 October 2020 for studies reporting data on prospective pathways and innovative strategies relevant for the assessment and management of the emerging risks in accessibility, safety, quality, and affordability of EMV in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. We used the resulting pool of evidence to support our analysis and to draw policy recommendations to mitigate the emerging risks and improve preparedness for future crises. RESULTS: Of the 310 records screened, 134 were included in the analysis. We found that the disruption of the international system affects more immediately the capability of low- and middle-income countries to acquire the basket of EMV. The COVID-19 pandemic may facilitate dishonesty and fraud, increasing the propensity of patients to take substandard and falsified drugs. Strategic regional cooperation in the form of joint tenders and contract awarding, joint price negotiation and supplier selection, as well as joint market research, monitoring, and evaluation could improve the supply, affordability, quality, and safety of EMV. Sustainable health financing along with international technology transfer and substantial investment in research and development are needed to minimize the vulnerability of African countries arising from their dependence on imported EMV. To ensure equitable access, community-based strategies such as mobile clinics as well as fees exemptions for vulnerable and under-served segments of society might need to be considered. Strategies such as task delegation and telephone triage could help reduce physician workload. This coupled with payments of risk allowance to frontline healthcare workers and health-literate healthcare organization might improve the appropriate use of EMV. CONCLUSIONS: Innovative and sustainable strategies informed by comparative risk assessment are increasingly needed to ensure that local economic, social, demographic, and epidemiological risks and potentials are accounted for in the national COVID-19 responses.","Amimo, Floriano; Lambert, Ben; Magit, Anthony; Hashizume, Masahiro",Global Health,74,14

OBJECTIVE: To investigate prevalence and factors associated with COVID-19 misinformation in Australia, and changes over time. METHODS: Adults 18 years and over completed a prospective national longitudinal survey in 2020 (n=4362 April; n=1882 May; n=1369 June). RESULTS: Stronger agreement with misinformation was associated with younger age, male gender, lower education, and language other than English at home (all P<.01). After controlling for these variables, misinformation beliefs were significantly associated (P<.001) with lower digital health literacy, lower perceived threat of COVID-19, lower confidence in government, and lower trust in scientific institutions. Analyses of specific government-identified misinformation revealed 3 clusters: prevention (associated with men and younger age), causation (associated with lower education and greater social disadvantage), and cure (associated with younger age). Lower institutional trust and greater rejection of official government accounts were associated with greater agreement.

At each timepoint total saliva transcriptome and proteome, and small RNA from salivary extracellular vesicles were profiled, including mRNA, miRNA, piRNA and bacterial RNA. The two 24-h periods were used in a paired analysis to remove daily variation and reveal vaccination responses. Over 18,000 omics longitudinal series had statistically significant temporal trends compared to a healthy baseline. Various immune response and regulation pathways were activated following vaccination, including interferon and cytokine signaling, and MHC antigen presentation. Immune response timeframes were concordant with innate and adaptive immunity development, and coincided with vaccination and reported fever. Overall, mRNA results appeared more specific and sensitive (timewise) to vaccination compared to other omics.

Increased interest in remote neuropsychological assessment techniques in the face of the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic warrants an updated review of relevant remote assessment literature. While recent reviews of videoconference-based neuropsychological applications have been published, no updated compilation of empirical TBCA research has been completed. Therefore, this scoping review offers relevant empirical research to inform clinical decision-making specific to teleneuropsychology. METHOD: Peer-reviewed studies addressing TBCA were included. Broad search terms were related to telephone, cognitive, or neuropsychological assessment and screening. After systematic searching of the PubMed and EBSCO databases, 139 relevant articles were retained. RESULTS: In total, 17 unique cognitive screening measures, 20 cognitive batteries, and 6 single-task measures were identified as being developed or adapted specifically for telephone administration. Tables summarizing the identified cognitive assessments, information on diagnostic accuracy, and comparisons to face-to-face cognitive assessment are included in supplementary materials. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, literature suggests that TBCA is a viable modality for identifying cognitive impairment in various populations. However, the mode of assessment selected clinically should reflect an understanding of the purpose, evidence, and limitations for various tests and populations. Most identified measures were developed for research application to support gross cognitive characterization and to help determine when more comprehensive testing was needed. While TBCA is not meant to replace gold-standard, face-to-face evaluation, if appropriately utilized, it can expand scope of practice, particularly when barriers to standard neuropsychological assessment occur.","Carlew, Anne R; Fatima, Hudaisa; Livingstone, Julia R; Reese, Caitlin; Lacritz, Laura; Pendergrass, Cody; Bailey, Kenneth Chase; Presley, Chase; Mokhtari, Ben; Cullum, Colin Munro",Arch Clin Neuropsychol,74,22

No research has empirically validated declines in surgical volume in Japan, based on the usage of surgical triage. We aimed to identify whether the announcement of surgical priorities by each Japanese surgical society may have affected the surgical volume decline during the 1st wave of this pandemic. METHODS: We extracted 490,719 available cases of patients aged > 15 years who underwent elective major surgeries between July 1, 2018, and June 30, 2020. After the categorization of surgical specialities, we calculated descriptive statistics to compare the year-over-year trend and conducted an interrupted time series analysis to validate the decline of each surgical procedure. RESULTS: Monthly surgical cases of eight surgical specialities, especially ophthalmology and ear/nose/throat surgeries, decreased from April 2020 and reached a minimum in May 2020. An interrupted time series analysis showed no significant trends in oncological and critical surgeries. CONCLUSION: Non-critical surgeries showed obvious and statistically significant declines in case volume during the 1st wave of the COVID-19 pandemic according to the statement of each surgical society in Japan.","Okuno, Takuya; Takada, Daisuke; Shin, Jung-Ho; Morishita, Tetsuji; Itoshima, Hisashi; Kunisawa, Susumu; Imanaka, Yuichi",Surg. today,74,31

Using the US state-level data, our analysis finds that both policies and information on transmission risks are important determinants of people's social distancing behavior, and shows that a change in policies explains a large fraction of observed changes in social distancing behavior. Our counterfactual experiments indicate that removing all policies would have lead to 30 to 200 times more additional cases by late May. Removing only the non-essential businesses closures (while maintaining restrictions on movie theaters and restaurants) would have increased the weekly growth rate of cases between -0.02 and 0.06 and would have lead to -10% to 40% more cases by late May. Finally, nationally mandating face masks for employees on April 1st would have reduced the case growth rate by 0.1-0.25. This leads to 30% to 57% fewer reported cases by late May, which translates into, roughly, 30-57 thousand saved lives.","Chernozhukov, Victor; Kasaha, Hiroyuki; Schrimpf, Paul",,74,26

Lower production of type I and III interferons and higher levels of inflammatory mediators upon SARS-CoV2 infection contribute to COVID-19 pathogenesis. Optimal interferon production and controlled inflammation are essential to limit COVID-19 pathogenesis. However, the aggravated inflammatory response observed in COVID-19 patients causes severe damage to the host and frequently advances to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Toll-like receptor 7 and 8 (TLR7/8) signaling pathways play a central role in regulating induction of interferons (IFNs) and inflammatory mediators in dendritic cells. Controlled inflammation is possible through regulation of TLR mediated response without influencing interferon production to reduce COVID-19 pathogenesis. This review focuses on inflammatory mediators that contribute to pathogenic effects and the role of TLR pathways in the induction of interferon and inflammatory mediators and their contribution to COVID-19 pathogenesis. We conclude that potential TLR7/8 agonists inducing antiviral interferon response and controlling inflammation are important therapeutic options to effectively eliminate SARS-CoV2 induced pathogenesis. Ongoing and future studies may provide additional evidence on their safety and efficacy to treat COVID-19 pathogenesis.","Dyavar, Shetty Ravi; Singh, Rahul; Emani, Rohini; Pawar, Ganesh P; Chaudhari, Vinod D; Podany, Anthony T; Avedissian, Sean N; Fletcher, Courtney V; Salunke, Deepak B",Biomed Pharmacother,74,22

Because of the phylogenetic similarity to humans, rhesus macaques are an animal model of choice for many virus-challenge and vaccine-evaluation studies, including SARS-CoV-2. Here, we show that immunization of macaques with SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein generates potent receptor binding domain cross- neutralizing antibody (nAb) responses to both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1, in contrast to human infection or vaccination where responses are typically SARS-CoV-2-specific. Furthermore, the macaque nAbs are equally effective against SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern. Structural studies show that different immunodominant sites are targeted by the two primate species. Human antibodies generally target epitopes strongly overlapping the ACE2 receptor binding site (RBS), whereas the macaque antibodies recognize a relatively conserved region proximal to the RBS that represents another potential pan-SARS-related virus site rarely targeted by human antibodies. B cell repertoire differences between the two primates appear to significantly influence the vaccine response and suggest care in the use of rhesus macaques in evaluation of vaccines to SARS-related viruses intended for human use. ONE SENTENCE SUMMARYBroadly neutralizing antibodies to an unappreciated site of conservation in the RBD in SARS- related viruses can be readily induced in rhesus macaques because of distinct properties of the naive macaque B cell repertoire that suggest prudence in the use of the macaque model in SARS vaccine evaluation and design.","He, Wan-ting; Yuan, Meng; Callaghan, Sean; Musharrafieh, Rami; Song, Ge; Silva, Murillo; Beutler, Nathan; Lee, Wen-Hsin; Yong, Peter; Torres, Jonathan L.; Melo, Mariane; Zhou, Panpan; Zhao, Fangzhu; Zhu, Xueyong; Peng, Linghang; Huang, Deli; Anzanello, Fabio; Ricketts, James; Parren, Mara; Garcia, Elijah; Ferguson, Melissa; Rinaldi, William; Rawlings, Stephen A.; Nemazee, David; Smith, Davey M.; Briney, Bryan; Safonova, Yana; Rogers, Thomas; Crotty, Shane; Irvine, Darrell J.; Ward, Andrew B.; Wilson, Ian A.; Burton, Dennis R.; Andrabi, Raiees",,74,24

Soluble decoy receptors, in which the ACE2 ectodomain is engineered to block S with high affinity, potently neutralize infection and, because of close similarity with the natural receptor, hold out the promise of being broadly active against virus variants without opportunity for escape. Here, we directly test this hypothesis. We find that an engineered decoy receptor, sACE22v2.4, tightly binds S of SARS-associated viruses from humans and bats, despite the ACE2-binding surface being a region of high diversity. Saturation mutagenesis of the receptor-binding domain followed by in vitro selection, with wild-type ACE2 and the engineered decoy competing for binding sites, failed to find S mutants that discriminate in favor of the wild-type receptor. We conclude that resistance to engineered decoys will be rare and that decoys may be active against future outbreaks of SARS-associated betacoronaviruses.","Chan, Kui K; Tan, Timothy J C; Narayanan, Krishna K; Procko, Erik",Sci.

SARS-CoV-2, can cause a pandemic infection with severe acute lung injury respiratory distress syndrome in patients with COVID-19, that can lead to patient death across all ages. The pathology associated with pandemic infection is linked to an over-response of immune cells, including virus-activated macrophages and mast cells (MCs). The local inflammatory response in the lung that occurs after exposure to SARS-CoV-2 is due to a complex network of activated inflammatory innate immune cells and structural lung cells such as bronchial epithelial cells, endothelial cells and fibroblasts. Bronchial epithelial cells and fibroblasts activated by SARS-CoV-2 can result in the up-regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and induction of MC differentiation. In addition, endothelial cells which control leukocyte traffic through the expression of adhesion molecules are also able to amplify leukocyte activation by generating interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6 and CXC chemokines. In this pathologic environment, the activation of mast cells (MCs) causes the release of histamine, proteases, cytokines, chemokines and arachidonic acid compounds, such as prostaglandin D2 and leukotrienes, all of which are involved in the inflammatory network. Histamine is stored endogenously within the secretory granules of MCs and is released into the vessels after cell stimulation. Histamine is involved in the expression of chemokine IL-8 and cytokine IL-6, an effect that can be inhibited by histamine receptor antagonists. IL-1 is a pleiotropic cytokine that is mainly active in inflammation and immunity. Alveolar macrophages activated by SARS-CoV-2 through the TLR produce IL-1 which stimulates MCs to produce IL-6. IL-1 in combination with IL-6 leads to excessive inflammation which can be lethal. In an interesting study published several years ago (by E. Vannier et al., 1993), it was found that histamine as well as IL-1 are implicated in the pathogenesis of pulmonary inflammatory reaction, after micorganism immune cell activation. IL-1 in combination with histamine can cause a strong increase of IL-1 levels and, consequently, a higher degree of inflammation. However, it has been reported that histamine alone has no effect on IL-1 production. Furthermore, histamine enhances IL-1-induced IL-6 gene expression and protein synthesis via H2 receptors in peripheral monocytes. Therefore, since MCs are large producers of histamine in inflammatory reactions, this vasoactive amine, by increasing the production of IL-1, can amplify the inflammatory process in the lung infected with SARS-CoV-2. Here, we have proposed for the first time an emerging role for histamine released by MCs which in combination with IL-1 can cause an increase in lung inflammation induced by the viral infection SARS-CoV-2.","Conti, P; Caraffa, Al; Tetè, G; Gallenga, C E; Ross, R; Kritas, S K; Frydas, I; Younes, A; Di Emidio, P; Ronconi, G",J Biol Regul Homeost Agents,74,17

The aim of this study is to investigate the impact of quarantine on the self-perceived preparedness of dental graduates and to explore the efficacy of online education from students’ perspectives. METHODS: The questionnaire distributed to dental students comprised of two main sections. The first part covered the online education experience, and the second part measured the level of self-perceived preparedness for a range of cognitive, communication and professional skills. RESULTS: The survey yielded a response rate of 72%. The majority of students (77%) agreed that they missed educational experiences as a result of the lockdown. More than half of them felt less motivated to follow-up with distant e-learning and believed that online assessment is not a good method for evaluation. A high percentage of the students (66%) thought that online group discussions had a positive value while 67% preferred online lectures compared to theatre lectures.

Increasing age (HR 1.49 every 10 years, 95% CI:1.25–1.8, p < 0.001), South Asian ethnicity (HR 2.92, 95% CI:1.73–4.9, p < 0.001), and cerebrovascular disease (HR 1.93, 95% CI:1.18–3.2, p = 0.008) also predicted mortality. Within the cancer cohort, systemic anti-cancer therapy (SACT) within 60 days of COVID-19 diagnosis was an independent risk factor for mortality (HR 2.30, 95% CI: 1.16–4.6, p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Along with known risk factors, cancer and SACT confer an independent risk for mortality following COVID-19. Further studies are needed to understand the socio-economic influences and pathophysiology of these associations.","Sng, Christopher C.

In Costa Rica, 20% of all infections and 27% of all ICU cases during the initial weeks of the outbreak were healthcare workers. The existing recommendations and protocols on how to care for an infected patient that requires acute surgical management have been applied successfully in various scenarios. We look to describe the first case of a COVID-19 patient that required surgical management in Costa Rica and present a summary of the protection measures utilized in a tertiary care hospital. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A review of literature utilizing Embase, Medline Complete and Google Scholar was performed. A surgical case report using the SCARE statement guidelines was drafted and a brief summary of the 54 items contained in the hospital’s COVID-19 surgical protocol is described. CASE PRESENTATION: We present the case of a 29 year old obese male who had acute appendicitis with perforation that contracted SARS-CoV-2 and became symptomatic at home on pod#3, who later required multiple surgeries to address an infected abdominal hematoma both while having an active COVID-19 infection and afterwards. CONCLUSIONS: Safety measures for both staff and patients are of the utmost importance during the current coronavirus pandemic. Limitations in the availability of personal protection equipment as well a lack of knowledge and experience with handling surgical patients with this condition have led to various safety and attention protocols being drafted. The successful management of this patient is the first experience in Costa Rica on how to properly address staff safety during a surgical procedure. None of the workers involved in care of this patient were diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2.","Sanchez-Betancourt, Alfredo; Sibaja-Alvarez, Pablo; Gonzalez-Cole, Milagros; Mendez-Barboza, Ivannia; Ledezma-Cruz, Crishtna; Vargas-Paez, Priscilla",Surg Case Rep,74,5

No published treatment to date has been shown to adequately control the inflammation and respiratory symptoms associated with COVID-19, apart from oxygen therapy and assisted ventilation. We evaluated the effects of using high dose oral and/or IV glutathione in the treatment of 2 patients with dyspnea secondary to COVID-19 pneumonia. METHODS: Two patients living in New York City (NYC) with a history of Lyme and tick-borne co-infections experienced a cough and dyspnea and demonstrated radiological findings consistent with novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP). A trial of 2 g of PO or IV glutathione was used in both patients and improved their dyspnea within 1 h of use. Repeated use of both 2000 mg of PO and IV glutathione was effective in further relieving respiratory symptoms. CONCLUSION: Oral and IV glutathione, glutathione precursors (N-acetyl-cysteine) and alpha lipoic acid may represent a novel treatment approach for blocking NF-κB and addressing “cytokine storm syndrome” and respiratory distress in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.","Horowitz, Richard I.; Freeman, Phyllis R.; Bruzzese, James",Respir Med Case Rep,74,10

For patients in pain and without symptoms that could potentially be attributed to COVID-19 (cough, fevers/chills, lethargy, myalgias, anosmia and so on), NSAIDs should continue to remain a viable option to provide analgesia to patients in need.","Herzberg, Daniel L; Sukumaran, Harry P; Viscusi, Eugene",Reg Anesth Pain Med,74,16

While the current COVID-19 pandemic affects everyone, marginalized and Indigenous communities in the United States experience disproportionate burdens of COVID-19 morbidity and mortality as well as socioeconomic and environmental impacts. In this brief research report, we examine 41 publicly available tribal public health and emergency preparedness codes to gain a better understanding of the institutional public health capacity that exists during this time. Of the codes collected, only nine mention any data sharing provisions with local, state, and federal officials while 21 reference communicable diseases. The existence of these public health institutions is not directly tied to the outcomes in the current pandemic; however, it is plausible that having such codes in place makes responding to public health crises now and in the future less reactionary and more proactive in meeting community needs.

Using comprehensive death records covering around 300 million Chinese people, we estimate the impacts of city and community lockdowns on non-COVID-19 mortality outside of Wuhan. Employing a difference-in-differences method, we find that lockdowns reduced the number of non-COVID-19 deaths by 4.9% (cardiovascular deaths by 6.2%, injuries by 9.2%, and non-COVID-19 pneumonia deaths by 14.3%). The health benefits are likely driven by significant reductions in air pollution, traffic, and human interactions. A back-of-the-envelope calculation shows that more than 32,000 lives could have been saved from non-COVID-19 diseases/causes during the 40 days of the lockdown on which we focus. The results suggest that the rapid and strict virus countermeasures not only effectively controlled the spread of COVID-19 but also brought about massive unintended public health benefits. These findings can help better inform policymakers around the world about the benefits and costs of city and community lockdowns policies in dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic.","Qi, Jinlei; Zhang, Dandan; Zhang, Xiang; Yin, Peng; Liu, Jianmei; Pan, Yuhang; Takana, Tanakao; Xie, Peiyu; Wang, Zhaoguang; Liu, Shuocen; Gao, George Fu; He, Guojun; Zhou, Maigeng",,74,20

SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19 acquiring mutations and circulating as new variants. Herein, we have found three new antiviral peptides (AVPs) against the SARS-CoV-2. These AVPs are analogous to the spike glycoprotein of the SARS-CoV-2. Antiviral peptides, i.e., Seq12, Seq12m, and Seq13m, can block the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2, which is necessary for communicating with the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Also, these AVPs sustain their antiviral properties, even after the insertion of 25 mutations in the RBD (Rosetta and FoldX based). Further, Seq12 and Seq12m showed negligible cytotoxicity. Besides, the binding free energies calculated using MM-PB/GBSA method are also in agreement with the molecular docking studies. The molecular interactions between AVPs and the viral membrane protein (M) also showed a favorable interaction suggesting it could inhibit the viral re-packaging process. In conclusion, this study suggests Seq12, Seq12m, and Seq13m could be helpful to fight against SARS-CoV-2. These AVPs could also aid virus diagnostic tools and nasal spray against SARS-CoV-2 in the future.","Dutta, Kunal; Elmezayen, Ammar D.; Al-Obaidi, Anas; Zhu, Wei; Morozova, Olga V.; Shityakov, Sergey; Khalifa, Ibrahim",J Mol Struct,74,1

The mechanisms that determine the age-dependent susceptibility remain largely unclear. Here, we found that the paucity of invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells together with immaturity of the immune system was related to the susceptibility of neonatal mice to EV71 infection. iNKT cells were crucial antiviral effector cells to protect young mice from EV71 infection before their adaptive immune systems were fully mature. EV71 infection led to activation of iNKT cells depending on signaling through TLR3 but not other TLRs. Surprisingly, iNKT cell activation during EV71 infection required TLR3 signaling in macrophages, but not in dendritic cells (DCs). Mechanistically, interleukin (IL)-12 and endogenous CD1d-restricted antigens were both required for full activation of iNKT cells. Furthermore, CD1d-deficiency led to dramatically increased viral loads in central nervous system and more severe disease in EV71-infected mice. Altogether, our results suggest that iNKT cells may be involved in controlling EV71 infection in children when their adaptive immune systems are not fully developed, and also imply that iNKT cells might be an intervention target for treating EV71-infected patients.","Zhu, Kai; Yang, Juhao; Luo, Kaiming; Yang, Chunhui; Zhang, Na; Xu, Ruifeng; Chen, Jianxia; Jin, Mingfei; Xu, Bin; Guo, Nining; Wang, Jianrong; Chen, Zuolong; Cui, Ying; Zhao, Hui; Wang, Yan; Deng, Chaoyang; Bai, Li; Ge, Baoxue; Qin, Cheng-Feng; Shen, Hao; Yang, Chun-Fu; Leng, Qibin",PLoS Pathog,74,10

To date, however, detection has required the user to provide multiple signal enhancement solutions and been limited to protein targets. We solve these challenges by using mathematical equations to guide the device design of a novel 2DPN, which leverages multiple fluidic inputs to apply fully dried solutions of hydrogen peroxide, diaminobenzidine, and horseradish peroxidase signal enhancement reagents to enhance the limit-of-detection of numerous nucleic acid products. Upon rehydration in our unique 2DPN design, the dried signal enhancement solution reduces the limit-of-detection (LOD) of the device to 5 × 10(11) nucleic acid copies/mL without increasing false positive detection. Our easy-to-use device retains activity after 28 days of dry storage and produces reliable signal enhancement 40 min after sample application.

Moreover, an analysis of the answers gathered in areas with different prevalence of the disease was carried out. All Lombardy’s dentists were sent an online ad hoc questionnaire. The questionnaire was divided into four domains: personal data, precautionary measures (before patient arrival; in the waiting room; in the operating room), awareness, and perception. Three thousand five hundred ninety-nine questionnaires were analyzed. Five hundred two (14.43%) participants had suffered one or more symptoms referable to COVID-19. Thirty-one subjects were positive to the virus SARS-CoV-2 and 16 subjects developed the disease. Only a small number of dentists (n = 72, 2.00%) were confident of avoiding infection; dentists working in low COVID-19 prevalence areas were more confident than those working in the Milan area and high prevalence area (61.24%, 61.23%, and 64.29%, p < 0.01 respectively). The level of awareness was statistically significantly higher (p < 0.01) in the Milan area (71.82%) than in the other areas.

We present recent data on disease-modifying therapies (DMT) before/during pregnancy and while breastfeeding, with treatment recommendations. RECENT FINDINGS: Observational data support the safety of injectable DMTs (glatiramer acetate, interferon-beta) for use in pregnancy, while some oral DMTs might be associated with fetal risk. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) before pregnancy such as rituximab or natalizumab likely do not pose significant fetal risks, but can cross the placenta with neonatal hematological abnormalities if given in the second trimester or later. Breastfeeding is associated with decreased risk of postpartum relapses. Finally, injectables and mAbs likely have low transfer into breastmilk. SUMMARY: Many women with MS do not require DMTs during pregnancy, although injectables could be continued. For women with highly active MS, cell-depleting therapies could be given before conception, or natalizumab could be continued through pregnancy, with monitoring of the fetus. Women should be encouraged to breastfeed, and those with higher relapse risk could consider injectables or mAbs while breastfeeding. Further data on safety of DMTs around pregnancy are needed. Maximizing function through non-pharmacologic approaches is complementary to DMTs. Special considerations for pregnancy and DMTs during the COVID-19 pandemic are needed.","Krysko, Kristen M.; Bove, Riley; Dobson, Ruth; Jokubaitis, Vilija; Hellwig, Kerstin",Curr Treat Options Neurol,74,28

However, the anti-vax community exhibits a broader range of “flavors” of COVID-19 topics, and hence can appeal to a broader cross-section of individuals seeking COVID-19 guidance online, e.g. individuals wary of a mandatory fast-tracked COVID-19 vaccine or those seeking alternative remedies. Hence the anti-vax community looks better positioned to attract fresh support going forward than the pro-vax community. This is concerning since a widespread lack of adoption of a COVID-19 vaccine will mean the world falls short of providing herd immunity, leaving countries open to future COVID-19 resurgences.

METHODS: We collected a comprehensive dataset containing individual death records between 2015 and 2020, from the Ecuadorian National Institute of Statistics and Census and the Ecuadorian Ministry of Government. We computed the number of excess deaths across time, geographical locations and demographic groups using Poisson regression methods. RESULTS: Between 1 January and 23 September 2020, the number of excess deaths in Ecuador was 36 402 [95% confidence interval (CI): 35 762–36 827) or 208 per 100 000 people, which is 171% of the expected deaths in that period in a typical year. Only 20% of the excess deaths are attributable to confirmed COVID-19 deaths. Strikingly, in provinces that were most affected by COVID-19 such as Guayas and Santa Elena, the all-cause deaths are more than double the expected number of deaths that would have occurred in a normal year. The extent of excess deaths in men is higher than in women, and the number of excess deaths increases with age. Indigenous populations had the highest level of excess deaths among all ethnic groups. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the exceptionally high level of excess deaths in Ecuador highlights the enormous burden and heterogeneous impact of COVID-19 on mortality, especially in older age groups and Indigenous populations in Ecuador, which was not fully revealed by COVID-19 death counts. Together with the limited testing in Ecuador, our results suggest that the majority of the excess deaths were likely to be undocumented COVID-19 deaths.","Cuéllar, Leticia; Torres, Irene; Romero-Severson, Ethan; Mahesh, Riya; Ortega, Nathaniel; Pungitore, Sarah; Hengartner, Nicolas; Ke, Ruian",Int J Epidemiol,74,1

Each participant underwent four successive systematic nasopharyngeal swabs before and during their stay in Saudi Arabia. Carriage of the main respiratory pathogens was assessed by PCR. 121 pilgrims were included and 93.4% reported respiratory symptoms during the study period. The acquisition of rhinovirus, coronaviruses and Staphylococcus aureus occurred soon after arrival in Saudi Arabia and rates decreased gradually after days 5 and 6. In contrast, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Klebsiella pneumoniae carriage increased progressively until the end of the stay in Saudi Arabia. Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis carriage increased starting around days 12 and 13, following an initial clearance. Influenza viruses were rarely isolated. We observed an independent positive mutual association between S. aureus and rhinovirus carriage and between H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis carriage. Dual carriage of H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis was strongly associated with S. pneumoniae carriage (OR = 6.22). Finally, our model showed that M. catarrhalis carriage was negatively associated with K. pneumoniae carriage. Chronic respiratory disease was associated with symptoms of LRTI. K. pneumoniae, M. catarrhalis-S. aureus and H. influenzae-rhinovirus dual carriage was associated with LRTI symptoms.

One of the methods for endosomal escape of CPP-fused molecules is photochemical internalization (PCI), which is based on the use of light and a photosensitizer and relies on photoinduced endosomal membrane destabilization to release the cargo molecule. Currently, it remains unclear how this delivery strategy behaves after photostimulation. Recent findings, including our studies using CPP-cargo-photosensitizer conjugates, have shed light on the photoinduced endosomal escape mechanism. In this review, we discuss the structural design of CPP-photosensitizer and CPP-cargo-photosensitizer conjugates, and the PCI mechanism underlying their application.","Soe, Tet Htut; Watanabe, Kazunori; Ohtsuki, Takashi",Molecules,74,12

Though vaccines against COVID-19 are now available, around the globe there is some hesitancy in getting the vaccine. This hesitancy to get vaccinated against COVID-19 is a complex phenomenon with various factors playing a role. This study aims at understanding the perception and expectations of the people about COVID-19 vaccine and the factors influencing the vaccine acceptance. This information is crucial to challenge vaccine hesitancy and to win the combat against the COVID-19 Pandemic through voluntary vaccine efforts. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey among the residents of the UAE to understand the expectations and perception on vaccination against COVID-19. The survey was conducted online, and the survey design included participant samples to be representative of UAE’s demographics. The results of the survey were analysed with various demographical variables of interest. RESULTS: The survey showed that people were more likely to get vaccinated when vaccines are (i) endorsed by trusted government health authorities, (ii) recommended by physicians and family doctors, and (iii) the merits are effectively communicated through government websites and trusted news channels. Availability of vaccines at multiple sites and providing vaccines free of charges are likely to improve the rate of vaccination. The perceptions, expectations and the motivational factors needed for people to get vaccinated differed with age, gender, marital status, income level, and employment status. CONCLUSION: To attain herd immunity against COVID-19, a large proportion of the population needs to be vaccinated and to achieve this the vaccination campaigns should target on specific expectations and motivational factors pertaining to each target group to successfully overcome the challenge of vaccine hesitancy.

Moreover, T. cruzi population structure exhibits linkage with the diversity of several strongly selected genes, with gene expression profiles, and with some major phenotypic traits. We discuss the evolutionary significance of these results, and their implications in terms of applied research (molecular epidemiology/strain typing, analysis of genes of interest, vaccine and drug design, immunological diagnosis) and of experimental evolution. Lastly, we revisit the long-term debate of describing new species within the T. cruzi taxon.","Tibayrenc, Michel; Ayala, Francisco J.",Acta Trop,74,21

We aimed to investigate the impact of the pandemic on acute alcohol intoxication (AAI) in France. METHODS We identified all hospital stays related to alcohol abuse in 2018-2020. Differences in number of hospitalizations between 2019 and 2020 were tested using Poisson regressions. Differences between observed and expected deliveries of drugs used in alcohol dependence in 2020 were also studied. RESULTS There was a decrease in the number of hospitalizations for AAI between 2019 and 2020 (-9677[-11·4%],RR:0·89[0·88-0·89]). This decrease was observed among men and women of all age groups, except women ≥ 85 years. We observed an increase in in-hospital mortality during 2020 and more hospitalizations for AAI with certain medical complications, especially during the first 2020 lockdown. There was a drop in observed deliveries of drugs used in alcohol dependence during the first 2020 lockdown. CONCLUSIONS The decrease in the number of hospitalizations for AAI in 2020 could be explained by several factors: fewer available hospital beds due to COVID-19, individuals with AAI delaying or avoiding medical care due to COVID-19 fears, and decreases driven by younger age groups returning to live with parents and socializing less. While alcohol consumption patterns have changed with the implementation of social distancing measures and lockdowns, the increase in mortality and the share of hospitalizations with complications suggest that these measures had an impact on event severity in a context of strained access to healthcare.","Karila, Laurent; Roussot, Adrien; Mariet, Anne-Sophie; Benyamina, Amine; Falissard, Bruno; Mikaeloff, Yann; Quantin, Catherine",Drug and alcohol dependence,74,30

However, lipidated mAtg8s, including the most frequently used autophagosomal membrane marker LC3B, are found on cellular membranes other than autophagosomes. Here we put forward a hypothesis that the lipidation of mAtg8s, termed ‘Atg8ylation', is a general membrane stress and remodeling response analogous to the role that ubiquitylation plays in tagging proteins. Ubiquitin and mAtg8s are related in sequence and structure, and the lipidation of mAtg8s occurs on its C-terminal glycine, akin to the C-terminal glycine of ubiquitin. Conceptually, we propose that mAtg8s and Atg8ylation are to membranes what ubiquitin and ubiquitylation are to proteins, and that, like ubiquitylation, Atg8ylation has a multitude of downstream effector outputs, one of which is autophagy.","Kumar, Suresh; Jia, Jingyue; Deretic, Vojo",Cell stress,74,16

We examined the effect of these interventions and behavioral changes on the incidence of COVID-19 as well as on influenza virus infections which may share some aspects of transmission dynamics with COVID-19. MethodsWe reviewed policy interventions and measured changes in population behaviours through two telephone surveys, on January 20-23 and February 11-14. We analysed data on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases, influenza surveillance data in outpatients of all ages, and influenza hospitalisations in children. We estimated the daily effective reproduction number (Rt), for COVID-19 and influenza A(H1N1). FindingsCOVID-19 transmissibility has remained at or below 1, indicating successful containment to date. Influenza transmission declined substantially after the implementation of social distancing measures and changes in population behaviours in late January, with a 44% (95% confidence interval, CI: 34% to 53%) reduction in transmissibility in the community, and a 33% (95% CI: 24% to 43%) reduction in transmissibility based on paediatric hospitalization rates. In the two surveys we estimated that 74.5% and 97.5% of the general adult population wore masks when going out, and 61.3% and 90.2% avoided going to crowded places, respectively. ImplicationsContainment measures, social distancing measures and changes in population behaviour have successfully prevented spread of COVID-19. The social distancing measures and behavioural changes led to a substantial reduction in influenza transmission in early February 2020. However, it may be challenging to avoid fatigue and sustain these measures and population behaviours as COVID-19 continues to spread globally.

When PM enters into a respiratory tract, the first body tissues to be directly exposed are the cells of respiratory tissues and pulmonary surfactant. Pulmonary surfactant is a pivotal component to modulate surface tension of alveoli during respiration. A lot of studies have proved that PM would interact with pulmonary surfactant to affect the alveolar activity, and meanwhile, pulmonary surfactant would be adsorbed to the surface of PM to change the toxic effect of PM. This review focuses on recent studies of the interactions between micro/nanoparticles (synthesized and environmental particles) and pulmonary surfactant (natural surfactant and its models), as well as the health effects that caused by PM through a few significant aspects, such as surface properties of PM, including size, surface charge, hydrophobicity, shape, chemical nature, etc. Moreover, in vitro and in vivo studies showed that PM leads to oxidative stress, inflammatory response, fibrosis, and cancerization in living bodies. By providing a comprehensive picture of PM-surfactant interaction, this review will benefit both researchers for further studies and policy-makers for setting up more appropriate regulations to reduce the adverse effects of PM on public health.","Wang, Feifei; Liu, Jifang; Zeng, Hongbo",Adv Colloid Interface Sci,74,1

Two multi-spanning food vacuole membrane proteins are known, the multidrug resistance protein 1 (PfMDR1) and Chloroquine Resistance Transporter (PfCRT). Both modulate resistance to drugs that act in the food vacuole. To investigate the formation and behaviour of the food vacuole membrane we have generated inducible GFP fusions of chloroquine sensitive and resistant forms of the PfCRT protein. The inducible expression system allowed us to follow newly-induced fusion proteins, and corroborated a previous report of a direct trafficking route from the ER/Golgi to the food vacuole membrane. These parasites also allowed the definition of a food vacuole compartment in ring stage parasites well before haemozoin crystals were apparent, as well as the elucidation of secondary PfCRT-labelled compartments adjacent to the food vacuole in late stage parasites. We demonstrated that in addition to previously demonstrated Brefeldin A sensitivity, the trafficking of PfCRT is disrupted by Dynasore, a non competitive inhibitor of dynamin-mediated vesicle formation. Chloroquine sensitivity was not altered in parasites over-expressing chloroquine resistant or sensitive forms of the PfCRT fused to GFP, suggesting that the PfCRT does not mediate chloroquine transport as a GFP fusion protein.","Ehlgen, Florian; Pham, James S.; de Koning-Ward, Tania; Cowman, Alan F.; Ralph, Stuart A.",PLoS One,74,1

According to the crystal structure of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which binds to the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD), 15 amino acids of ACE2 have considerable interaction with RBD. Therefore, a new peptide based on these amino acids was designed as the functional group for AuNP. On the basis of the obtained results, functionalized AuNPs have remarkable effects on the RBD and strongly interact with this protein of SARS-CoV-2. Among the studied nanoparticles, the AuNP functionalized by new peptide forms a more stable complex with RBD in comparison with ACE2, which is the human receptor for SARS-CoV-2.

Here we characterise the differential risk of hospitalisation and death in Sao Paulo state, Brazil and show how vulnerability to COVID-19 is shaped by socioeconomic inequalities. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study using hospitalised severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) notified from March to August 2020, in the Sistema de Monitoramento Inteligente de Sao Paulo (SIMI-SP) database. We examined the risk of hospitalisation and death by race and socioeconomic status using multiple datasets for individual-level and spatio-temporal analyses. We explained these inequalities according to differences in daily mobility from mobile phone data, teleworking behaviour, and comorbidities. Findings: Throughout the study period, patients living in the 40% poorest areas were more likely to die when compared to patients living in the 5% wealthiest areas (OR: 1.60, 95% CI: 1.48 - 1.74) and were more likely to be hospitalised between April and July, 2020 (OR: 1.08, 95% CI: 1.04 - 1.12).

DHODH is a mitochondrial inner membrane enzyme responsible for catalytic conversion of dihydroorotate into orotate, a rate-limiting step in the de novo synthesis of the pyrimidine nucleotides. LF produces cellular depletion of pyrimidine nucleotides required for cell growth and proliferation. Based on the affected cells the outcome can be attainable as immunosuppression, antiproliferative, and/or the recently gained attention of the antiviral potentials of LF and its new congeners. Also, protein tyrosine kinase inhibition is an additional mechanistic benefit of LF, which inhibits immunological events such as cellular expansion and immunoglobulin production with an enhanced release of immunosuppressant cytokines. LF is approved for the treatment of autoimmune arthritis of rheumatoid and psoriatic pathogenesis. Also, LF has been used off-label for the treatment of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. However, LF antiviral activity is repurposed and under investigation with related compounds under a phase-I trial as a SARS CoV-2 antiviral in cases with COVID-19.

Next-generation sequencing is the state of the art in open-view pathogen detection, and one of the few methods available at the earliest stages of an epidemic, even when the biological threat is unknown. Analyzing the samples as the sequencer is running can greatly reduce the turnaround time, but existing tools rely on close matches to lists of known pathogens and perform poorly on novel species. Machine learning approaches can predict if single reads originate from more distant, unknown pathogens but require relatively long input sequences and processed data from a finished sequencing run. Incomplete sequences contain less information, leading to a trade-off between sequencing time and detection accuracy. Using a workflow for real-time pathogenic potential prediction, we investigate which subsequences already allow accurate inference. We train deep neural networks to classify Illumina and Nanopore reads and integrate the models with HiLive2, a real-time Illumina mapper. This approach outperforms alternatives based on machine learning and sequence alignment on simulated and real data, including SARS-CoV-2 sequencing runs. After just 50 Illumina cycles, we observe an 80-fold sensitivity increase compared to real-time mapping. The first 250 bp of Nanopore reads, corresponding to 0.5 s of sequencing time, are enough to yield predictions more accurate than mapping the finished long reads. The approach could also be used for screening synthetic sequences against biosecurity threats.","Bartoszewicz, Jakub M; Genske, Ulrich; Renard, Bernhard Y",Brief. bioinform,74,32

To the best of our knowledge, these are among the earliest data that focus on the risk for depression among a sizeable sample of the Italian general population during the COVID-19 outbreak. Our results indicate emotion dysregulation and reduced hedonic tone as potential factors predicting COVID-19-related depression severity and provide insight into developing targeted intervention policies.","Moccia, Lorenzo; Janiri, Delfina; Giuseppin, Giulia; Agrifoglio, Benedetta; Monti, Laura; Mazza, Marianna; Caroppo, Emanuele; Fiorillo, Andrea; Sani, Gabriele; Di Nicola, Marco; Janiri, Luigi",Int J Environ Res Public Health,74,8

Currently, there is a critical shortage of proven treatment options and an urgent need to understand the pathogenesis of multi-organ failure and lung damage. Cytokine storm is associated with severe inflammation and organ damage during COVID-19. However, a detailed molecular pathway defining this cytokine storm is lacking, and gaining mechanistic understanding of how SARS-CoV-2 elicits a hyperactive inflammatory response is critical to develop effective therapeutics. Of the multiple inflammatory cytokines produced by innate immune cells during SARS-CoV-2 infection, we found that the combined production of TNF-α and IFN-γ specifically induced inflammatory cell death, PANoptosis, characterized by gasdermin–mediated pyroptosis, caspase-8–mediated apoptosis, and MLKL–mediated necroptosis. Deletion of pyroptosis, apoptosis, or necroptosis mediators individually was not sufficient to protect against cell death. However, cells deficient in both RIPK3 and caspase-8 or RIPK3 and FADD were resistant to this cell death. Mechanistically, the STAT1/IRF1 axis activated by TNF-α and IFN-γ co-treatment induced iNOS for the production of nitric oxide. Pharmacological and genetic deletion of this pathway inhibited pyroptosis, apoptosis, and necroptosis in macrophages. Moreover, inhibition of PANoptosis protected mice from TNF-α and IFN-γ–induced lethal cytokine shock that mirrors the pathological symptoms of COVID-19. In vivo neutralization of both TNF-α and IFN-γ in multiple disease models associated with cytokine storm showed that this treatment provided substantial protection against not only SARS-CoV-2 infection, but also sepsis, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, and cytokine shock models, demonstrating the broad physiological relevance of this mechanism. Collectively, our findings reveal that blocking the COVID-19 cytokine-mediated inflammatory cell death signaling pathway identified in this study may benefit patients with COVID-19 or other cytokine storm-driven syndromes by limiting inflammation and tissue damage. The findings also provide a molecular and mechanistic description for the term cytokine storm. Additionally, these results open new avenues for the treatment of other infectious and autoinflammatory diseases and cancers where TNF-α and IFN-γ synergism play key pathological roles.","Karki, Rajendra; Sharma, Bhesh Raj; Tuladhar, Shraddha; Williams, Evan Peter; Zalduondo, Lillian; Samir, Parimal; Zheng, Min; Sundaram, Balamurugan; Banoth, Balaji; Malireddi, R.

The megatrends are seen as major forces that will sharp the future of food experiences. The postmodern consumer finds himself in very conflicting situations within a short timeframe. Here, food becomes an identity-forming element that serves closeness and family-like structures even in situations of singling out. The strengthening of local concepts, authenticity, and current movements such as organic food, the slow food movement, and the concept of value cocreation is identified as important counterparts to singularization, demographic change, urbanization, and globalization within the transformation economy. These concepts also reflect the increasing search for purpose by consumers rather than pure consumption. Based on these developments, this chapter proposes approaches for retailers, gastronomy, and event organizers to develop future concepts of food experiences. As an outlook, food art and food design are considered to support the industry in anticipating the future of food experiences.","Doppler, Susanne; Steffen, Adrienne","Case Studies on Food Experiences in Marketing, Retail, and Events",74,24

This paper establishes the importance of rural–urban commuting in India. As per estimates from Periodic Labour Force Survey 2018–2019, an estimated 18.8 million individuals living in rural are working in urban India and the share of earnings from urban in total non-farm rural earnings is 19.3%. Among all rural workers, 7.3% are rural–urban commuters while only 2.1% of urban workers are urban–rural commuters. We document large variations at the sub-national level. Our results from a multinomial model to understand the factors associated with commuting highlight the importance of lagged regional unemployment rate. A high rural unemployment rate acts as a push factor, and a low urban unemployment rate acts as a pull factor for rural–urban commuting. The urbanness of occupations in a region is also an important correlate of commuting. The paper concludes by highlighting the need to prioritize questions in India’s labour force survey that would help understand the nature of labour mobility and strength of rural–urban linkages.","Bhatt, Vasavi; Chandrasekhar, S.; Sharma, Ajay",Indian J Labour Econ,74,1

Primary objective of study was to analyse the 14-day and 28-day mortality. Secondary objectives were to correlate age, comorbidities and remission status with outcome. Methods Retrospective multicentre observational study conducted in 11 centres across India. Total 130 patients with hematological malignancies and COVID-19 were enrolled. Results Fever and cough were commonest presentation. Eleven % patients were incidentally detected. Median age of our cohort was 49.5 years. Most of our patients had a lymphoid malignancy (n = 91). One-half patients (52%) had mild infection, while moderate and severe infections contributed to one-fourth each. Sixty seven patients (52%) needed oxygen For treatment of COVID-19 infection, half(n = 66) received antivirals. Median time to RT-PCR COVID-19 negativity was 17 days (7–49 days). Nearly three-fourth (n = 95) of our patients were on anticancer treatment at time of infection, of which nearly two-third (n = 59;64%) had a delay in chemotherapy. Overall, 20% (n = 26) patients succumbed. 14-day survival and 28-day survival for whole cohort was 85.4% and 80%, respectively. One patient succumbed outside the study period on day 39.

Antimalarial drug chloroquine (CHL) and its safer derivative hydroxychloroquine (HCHL) have been proposed to be repurposed to treat SARS coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of COVID-19. CHL/HCHL have anti-inflammatory activity and are used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis and lupus. Although, CHL/HCHL have an anti-viral activity against several viruses in cell-cultures, the anti-viral activity in-vivo is questionable. Repurposing of CHL/HCHL to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection is appealing. However, there is empirical evidence from animal studies with other viruses suggesting that CHL/HCHL may have an untoward paradoxical effect. One thus cannot exclude the possibility that CHL may increase the severity of the disease and prove deleterious both for the patients and public health efforts to contain the highly contagious and explosive spread of SARS-CoV-2.","Sharma, Anuj",Microbes Infect,74,20

The objective of this study was to investigate the differences between mortality registered as due to COVID-19 and the excess all-cause mortality reported in countries worldwide during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Ecological analysis of 22 countries compared five-year historical all-cause mortality, reported all-cause mortality and expected all-cause mortality (calculated as the historical mortality plus the reported deaths attributed to COVID-19). Data available from the first week of January 2020 to that most recently available were analysed. RESULTS: Compared to the preceding five years, there was an excess of 716 616 deaths of which 64.3% were attributed to COVID-19. The proportion of deaths registered as COVID-19 related/excess deaths varied markedly between countries, ranging between 30% and 197% in those countries that had an excess of deaths during the period of observation. In most countries where a definite peak in COVID-19 related deaths occurred, the increase in reported all-cause mortality preceded the increase in COVID-19 reported mortality. During the latter period of observation, a few countries reported fewer all-cause deaths than the historical figures. CONCLUSION: The increases in all-cause mortality preceded the increase in COVID-19 mortality in most countries that had definite spikes in COVID-19 mortality. The number of deaths attributed to COVID-19 was underestimated by at least 35%. Together these findings suggest that calculation of excess all-cause mortality is a better predictor of COVID-19 mortality than the reported rates, in those countries experiencing definite increases in mortality.","Kung, Stacey; Doppen, Marjan; Black, Melissa; Braithwaite, Irene; Kearns, Ciléin; Weatherall, Mark; Beasley, Richard; Kearns, Nethmi",ERJ Open Res,74,21

The common risk factors identified with regard to suicidal behavior are fear of COVID-19, economic instability, poor access to healthcare facilities, pre-existing psychiatric disorders, and social disconnect. The studies done so far have reported either case studies or have made an effort to understand the risk factors. An understanding of the underlying causal pattern from existing theories, behind these risks, will enable adopting appropriate prevention mechanisms. Hence, this review examines evidence related to risk factors of suicides that occurred during COVID 19 and discusses it in the light of three major theoretical approaches: interpersonal model, stress diathesis model, and cognitive model. The insights obtained from the three viewpoints reveal that perceived burdensomeness, thwarted belongingness, stress sensitivity, cognitive errors such as magnification, catastrophic thinking, arbitrary inference, and mind-reading are likely reasons behind these risk factors for suicide. It is suggested that awareness regarding COVID-19 stressors, use of community-based approaches like gatekeeper training, and brief online psychotherapy by using techniques of mindfulness, interpersonal psychotherapy, and cognitive behavior therapy can be useful in reducing suicide risk during COVID-19.","Raj, Saurabh; Ghosh, Debasruti; Singh, Tushar; Verma, Sunil K.; Arya, Yogesh K.",Front Psychiatry,74,17

Unlike conventionally developed vaccines, Biovacc-19’s method of operation is upon nonhuman-like (NHL) epitopes in 21.6% of the composition of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)’s spike protein, which displays distinct distributed charge including the presence of a charged furin-like cleavage site. The logic of the design of the vaccine is explained, which starts with empirical analysis of the aetiology of SARS-CoV-2. Mistaken assumptions about SARS-CoV-2’s aetiology risk creating ineffective or actively harmful vaccines, including the risk of antibody-dependent enhancement. Such problems in vaccine design are illustrated from past experience in the human immunodeficiency viruses domain. We propose that the dual effect general method of action of this chimeric virus’s spike, including receptor binding domain, includes membrane components other than the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor, which explains clinical evidence of its infectivity and pathogenicity. We show the nonreceptor dependent phagocytic general method of action to be specifically related to cumulative charge from insertions placed on the SARS-CoV-2 spike surface in positions to bind efficiently by salt bridge formations; and from blasting the spike we display the NHL epitopes from which Biovacc-19 has been down-selected.","Sørensen, Birger; Susrud, Andres; Dalgleish, Angus George",QRB discovery,74,23

We aim to identify the risk factors for the transmission of COVID-19 using data on mainland China. We estimated attack rate (AR) at county level. Logistic regression was used to explore the role of transportation in the nationwide spread. Generalized additive model and stratified linear mixed-effects model were developed to identify the effects of multiple meteorological factors on local transmission. The ARs in affected counties ranged from 0.6 to 9,750.4 per million persons, with a median of 8.8. The counties being intersected by railways, freeways, national highways or having airports had significantly higher risk for COVID-19 with adjusted odds ratios (ORs) of 1.40 (p =0.001), 2.07 (p <0.001), 1.31 (p =0.04), and 1.70 (p <0.001), respectively. The higher AR of COVID-19 was significantly associated with lower average temperature, moderate cumulative precipitation and higher wind speed. Significant pairwise interactions were found among above three meteorological factors with higher risk of COVID-19 under low temperature and moderate precipitation. Warm areas can also be in higher risk of the disease with the increasing wind speed. In conclusion, transportation and meteorological factors may play important roles in the transmission of COVID-19 in mainland China, and could be integrated in consideration by public health alarm systems to better prevent the disease.","Wei, Jia-Te; Liu, Yun-Xia; Zhu, Yu-Chen; Qian, Jie; Ye, Run-Ze; Li, Chun-Yu; Ji, Xiao-Kang; Li, Hong-Kai; Qi, Chang; Wang, Ying; Yang, Fan; Zhou, Yu-Hao; Yan, Ran; Cui, Xiao-Ming; Liu, Yuan-Li; Jia, Na; Li, Shi-Xue; Li, Xiu-Jun; Xue, Fu-Zhong; Zhao, Lin; Cao, Wu-Chun",Int J Hyg Environ Health,74,33

While pathogen evolution, co-infection, and behavioural changes have been proposed as possible mechanisms for the occurrence of subsequent outbreaks, the effect of public health interventions remains undetermined. METHODS: We develop mean-field and stochastic epidemiological models for disease transmission, and perform simulations to show how control measures, such as drug treatment and isolation of ill individuals, can influence the epidemic profile and generate sequences of infection waves with different characteristics. RESULTS: We demonstrate the impact of parameters representing the effectiveness and adverse consequences of intervention measures, such as treatment and emergence of drug resistance, on the spread of a pathogen in the population. If pathogen resistant strains evolve under drug pressure, multiple outbreaks are possible with variability in their characteristics, magnitude, and timing. In this context, the level of drug use and isolation capacity play an important role in the occurrence of subsequent outbreaks. Our simulations for influenza infection as a case study indicate that the intensive use of these interventions during the early stages of the epidemic could delay the spread of disease, but it may also result in later infection waves with possibly larger magnitudes. CONCLUSIONS: The findings highlight the importance of intervention parameters in the process of public health decision-making, and in evaluating control measures when facing substantial uncertainty regarding the epidemiological characteristics of an emerging infectious pathogen. Critical factors that influence population health including evolutionary responses of the pathogen under the pressure of different intervention measures during an epidemic should be considered for the design of effective strategies that address short-term targets compatible with long-term disease outcomes.","Wessel, Lindsay; Hua, Yi; Wu, Jianhong; Moghadas, Seyed M",BMC Public Health,74,1

In the present study this tentative marker of recurrent infections was used to study the pathogenetic background of otitis media with effusion (OME). Altogether 57 consecutive children, aged 2–11 years, who came for tympanostomy and/or adenoidectomy were divided into three subgroups: 25 of them had OME and a history of recurrent acute otitis media (rAOM/OME +), 20 had OME without an infectious background (inf- /OME +), and 12 had a history of recurrent upper respiratory infections (inf +/OME —) without OME. All the children were free of acute illness at the time of sampling. Differences between the groups were seen in IFN yields when leukocyte cultures were stimulated with adeno-, rhino-, corona-, respiratory syncytial or influenza A viruses. Leukocytes from inf- /OME + children produced more IFN than those of the other two groups. Though no sex differences in the IFN responses were seen among rAOM/OME + and inf + /OME- children, leukocytes from inf- /OME + girls produced significantly higher amounts of IFN than those of inf- /OME + boys, or rAOM/OME + and inf + /OME- children. These differences between clinically different groups of children support the view that the etiology of OME can be heterogeneous.","Pitkäranta, Anne; Hovi, Tapani; Karma, Pekka",International Journal of Pediatric Otorhinolaryngology,74,20

Sociocultural and regulatory aspects, as well as health policies, play a central role in addition to medical care and prescription practices. The users mainly display self-involved motivations related to cognitive enhancement, emotional stability, and adaptivity. Natural stimulants, as well as drugs, represent substance abuse groups. The latter comprise purines, methylxanthines, phenylethylamines, modafinil, nootropics, antidepressants but also benzodiazepines, β-adrenoceptor antagonists, and cannabis. Predominant pharmacodynamic target structures of these substances are the noradrenergic/dopaminergic and cholinergic receptor/transporter systems. Further targets comprise adenosine, serotonin, and glutamate receptors. Meta-analyses of randomized-controlled studies in healthy individuals show no or very limited verifiability of positive effects of pNE on attention, vigilance, learning, and memory. Only some members of the substance abuse groups, i.e., phenylethylamines and modafinil, display positive effects on attention and vigilance that are comparable to caffeinated drinks. However, the development of new antidementia drugs will increase the availability and the potential abuse of pNE. Social education, restrictive regulatory measures, and consistent medical prescription practices are essential to restrict the phenomenon of neuroenhancement with its social, medical, and ethical implications.

Herein, we report for the first time the inhibitory activity of polycyclic peptides, particularly, derivatives of glycopeptide antibiotics teicoplanin and eremomycin, against a panel of 12 recombinant human protein kinases and two protein kinases (CK1 and CK2) isolated from rat liver. Several of the investigated compounds inhibited various PKs with IC(50) values below 10 μM and caused >90% suppression of the enzyme activity at 10 μM concentration. Kinetic analysis of the protein kinase CK2α inhibition by the teicoplanin aglycon analogue (7) demonstrated the non-competitive mechanism of inhibition (with regard to ATP). Interestingly, the inhibitory activity of some investigated compounds correlated with the earlier described antiviral activity against HIV, HCV, and other corona- and flaviviruses.","Cozza, G.; Fortuna, M.; Meggio, F.; Sarno, S.; Kubbutat, M.

Based on their satisfactory in vitro antioxidant potency, researchers have identified this molecule as an efficient remedy for neuropathological as well as metabolic disorders. Some of this therapeutic activity is accomplished by upregulation of cytoprotective molecular pathways capable of restoring the enzymatic antioxidant activity and normal mitochondrial functions. Sirtuin-3 has been discovered as a key player for achieving the neuroprotective role of fucoidan by managing these pathways, whose ultimate goal is retrieving the entirety of the antioxidant response and preventing apoptosis of neurons, thereby averting neurodegeneration and brain injuries. Another pathway whereby fucoidan exerts neuroprotective capabilities is by interactions with P-selectin on endothelial cells, thereby preventing macrophages from entering the brain proper. Furthermore, beneficial influences of fucoidan have been established in hepatocytes after xenobiotic induced liver injury by decreasing transaminase leakage and autophagy as well as obtaining optimal levels of intracellular fiber, which ultimately prevents fibrosis. The hepatoprotective role of this marine polysaccharide also includes a sirtuin, namely sirtuin-1 overexpression, which alleviates obesity and insulin resistance through suppression of hyperglycemia, reducing inflammation and stimulation of enzymatic antioxidant response. While fucoidan is very effective in animal models for brain injury and neuronal degeneration, in general, it is accepted that fucoidan shows somewhat limited potency in liver. Thus far, it has been used in large doses for treatment of acute liver injuries. Thus, it appears that further optimization of fucoidan derivatives may establish enhanced versatility for treatments of various disorders, in addition to brain injury and disease.","Dimitrova-Shumkovska, Jasmina; Krstanoski, Ljupcho; Veenman, Leo",Mar Drugs,74,18

Epidemiologic studies have demonstrated that age is one of the strongest risk factors influencing the morbidity and mortality of COVID-19. Here, we interrogate the transcriptional features and cellular landscapes of the aging human lung through integrative analysis of bulk and single-cell transcriptomics. By intersecting these age-associated changes with experimental data on host interactions between SARS-CoV-2 or its relative SARS-CoV, we identify several age-associated factors that may contribute to the heightened severity of COVID-19 in older populations. We observed that age-associated gene expression and cell populations are significantly linked to the heightened severity of COVID-19 in older populations. The aging lung is characterized by increased vascular smooth muscle contraction, reduced mitochondrial activity, and decreased lipid metabolism. Lung epithelial cells, macrophages, and Th1 cells decrease in abundance with age, whereas fibroblasts, pericytes and CD4+ Tcm cells increase in abundance with age. Several age-associated genes have functional effects on SARS-CoV replication, and directly interact with the SARS-CoV-2 proteome. Interestingly, age-associated genes are heavily enriched among those induced or suppressed by SARS-CoV-2 infection. These analyses illuminate potential avenues for further studies on the relationship between the aging lung and COVID-19 pathogenesis, which may inform strategies to more effectively treat this disease.","Chow, Ryan D.; Chen, Sidi",bioRxiv,74,28

However, a lack of spatial awareness may cause unintentional violations of this new measure. Against this backdrop, we propose an active surveillance system to slow the spread of COVID-19 by warning individuals in a region-of-interest. Our contribution is twofold. First, we introduce a vision-based real-time system that can detect SD violations and send non-intrusive audio-visual cues using state-of-the-art deep-learning models. Second, we define a novel critical social density value and show that the chance of SD violation occurrence can be held near zero if the pedestrian density is kept under this value. The proposed system is also ethically fair: it does not record data nor target individuals, and no human supervisor is present during the operation. The proposed system was evaluated across real-world datasets.","Yang, Dongfang; Yurtsever, Ekim; Renganathan, Vishnu; Redmill, Keith A.; Özgüner, Ümit",Sensors (Basel),74,15

To understand the impact that COVID-19 has had on the myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) patient population, we conducted an internet based survey. Methods: Survey: This survey was hosted Mayo Clinic's secured REDCap system for online surveys with a link to the survey alongside a brief description posted via the www.mpnqol.com website, as well as other MPN organizational partners. Survey responses were completely anonymous. Questions included MPN-Total symptom score (TSS), NCCN distress thermometer (NCCN-DT), questions regarding impact on medical care, and questions from CDC COVID-19 community survey question bank regarding the impact of social distancing as well as changes in health behaviors. Distress thermometer, MPN-TSS, and/or questions related to the impact of COVID-19 on MPN treatment were analyzed by: MPN diagnosis, among those with ET, PV, or MF diagnoses; medication status; stay at home order; community spread; and country. Associations were tested using Kruskal-Wallis or Wilcoxon rank sum tests (for continuous variables) or Fisher Exact tests (for categorical variables). Analysis: Results: Patient Demographics (Table 1): 1560 people responded to the survey, 1217 were eligible for analysis. Median age was 62 (range: 21-93), and 298 (24.6%) respondents were male. There were respondents from USA, Australia, Canada, Netherlands, Ireland, and UK. 233 patients (19.2%) have myelofibrosis, 419 (34.6%) polycythemia vera and 543 (44.8%) essential thrombocythemia. At the time of the COVID outbreak, 1026 (84.3%) were on MPN directed medical therapy, including ruxolitinib (15.3%), interferon (14.7%), hydroxyurea (42.7%) and ASA (47.7%). 165 (13.6%) respondents received COVID testing, of which 5 had positive tests. Impact on MPN Care (Table 2): We sought to understand how patient's clinical care changed. Over half respondents who spoke to their MPN doctor had a telemedicine visit after COVID19 (57.1%). 422 (36.5%) patients spaced out visits, of which 99 (22.7%) felt there were consequences. A change in therapy due to COVID-1 occurred in only 5.4% of patients. MPN Symptom Burden and QoL: Data captured on the NCCN-DT had a median of 4 (0-10). MPN-SAF-TSS composite score was collected in 1150 respondents, median score was 26 (0-90). These scores are higher than those previously reported. Pandemic Impact on Lifestyle (Table 1): 595 (49.5%) of patients report living in a community where there is significant COVID-19 spread. 946 (78.9%) reported that COVID-19 has impacted their day to day life. 198 (17.2%) of patients agreed, or strongly agreed that COVID had a significant impact on their finances. 799 (67.8%) had a stay at home order. Of those who quarantined (112), the median duration was 30d (1-120). The majority of people increased hand-washing, and cleaning habits. 954 (81.7%) respondents reported wearing masks in public. 908 (76.8%) reported increased stress from social distancing. The majority of respondents report using healthy coping habits, such as reaching out to friends/loved ones, breathing and relaxation, as well as healthy diet. Less than 15% of patients report unhealthy coping strategies, such as use of opioids, benzodiazepines, alcohol, or cannabis Factors associated with response: There were no differences in responses based on type of MPN. If a patient was on medication, they were more likely to have spoken to their provider (p<0.001). If there was a stay at home order in place, there was a higher MPN-TSS score (p<0.001). If the respondent lived in an area of high community spread, they had a higher NCCN-DT score (p<0.001). Patients in the USA had a higher NCCN-DT score (p=0.001), were more likely to stretch out the duration of time between visits (p<0.001) and less likely to have a telemedicine visit (p<0.001). Although fewer respondents in the USA thought COVID-19 was a serious disease (p=0.02), a higher percentage of respondents wore masks (p <0.001). Conclusions: In our survey of MPN patients, there were many changes noted in clinical care. The use of telemedicine was common, and at least a third had significant changes in their care. Most experienced increased stress, however, employed healthy coping strategies. Only a minority of patients had a COVID test, and only 5 were positive, further data will be needed to understand the impact of COVID infection.

Maintaining public access to EMCCs without delay is crucial in case of disease outbreak despite the significant increased activity and the difficulties to mobilize extra staff resources. The aim of our study was to assess the impact of two-level filtering on EMCC performance during the COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: A before-after monocentric prospective study was conducted at the EMCC at the Nantes University Hospital. Using telephone activity data, we compared EMCC performance during 2 periods. In period one (February 27th to March 11th 2020), call takers managed calls as usual, gathering basic information from the caller and giving first aid instructions to a bystander on scene if needed. During period two (March 12th to March 25th 2020), calls were answered by a first-line call taker to identify potentially serious conditions that required immediate dispatch. When a serious condition was excluded, the call was immediately transferred to a second-line call taker who managed the call as usual so the first-line call taker could be rapidly available for other incoming calls. The primary outcome was the quality of service at 20 s (QS20), corresponding to the rate of calls answered within 20 s. We described activity and outcome measures by hourly range. We compared EMCC performance during periods one and two using an interrupted time series analysis. RESULTS: We analyzed 45,451 incoming calls during the two study periods: 21,435 during period 1 and 24,016 during period 2. Between the two study periods, we observed a significant increase in the number of incoming calls per hour, the number of connected call takers and average call duration. A linear regression model, adjusted for these confounding variables, showed a significant increase in the QS20 slope (from − 0.4 to 1.4%, p = 0.01), highlighting the significant impact of two-level filtering on the quality of service. CONCLUSIONS: We found that rapid access to our EMCC was maintained during the COVID-19 pandemic via two-level filtering. This system helped reduce the time gap between call placement and first-line call-taker evaluation of a potentially life-threatening situation. We suggest implementing this system when an EMCC faces significantly increased activity with limited staff resources.","Penverne, Y.; Leclere, B.; Labady, J.; Berthier, F.; Jenvrin, J.; Javaudin, F.; Montassier, E.",Scand J Trauma Resusc Emerg Med,74,16

Our primary objective was to estimate the percentage of cases reported in the general community, considered as those that occurred outside of long-term care facilities (LTCFs), in specific provinces and Canada as a whole. We applied a methodology using the delay-adjusted case fatality ratio (CFR) to all cases and deaths, as well as those representing the general community. Our second objective was to assess whether the assumed CFR (mean = 1.38%) was appropriate for calculating underestimation of cases in Canada. Estimates were developed for the period from March 11th, 2020 to September 16th, 2020. Estimates of the percentage of cases reported (PrCR) and CFR varied spatially and temporally across Canada. For the majority of provinces, and for Canada as a whole, the PrCR increased through the early stages of the pandemic. The estimated PrCR in general community settings for all of Canada increased from 18.1% to 69.0% throughout the entire study period. Estimates were greater when considering only those data from outside of LTCFs. The estimated upper bound CFR in general community settings for all of Canada decreased from 9.07% on March 11th, 2020 to 2.00% on September 16th, 2020. Therefore, the true CFR in the general community in Canada was likely less than 2% on September 16th. According to our analysis, some provinces, such as Alberta, Manitoba, Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia, and Saskatchewan reported a greater percentage of cases as of September 16th, compared to British Columbia, Ontario, and Québec. This could be due to differences in testing rates and criteria, demographics, socioeconomic factors, race, and access to healthcare among the provinces. Further investigation into these factors could reveal differences among provinces that could partially explain the variation in estimates of PrCR and CFR identified in our study. The estimates provide context to the summative state of the pandemic in Canada, and can be improved as knowledge of COVID-19 reporting rates and disease characteristics are advanced.","Dougherty, Brendan P.; Smith, Ben A.; Carson, Carolee A.; Ogden, Nicholas H.",Infect Dis Model,74,19

Secondarily, cells and mediators associated with inflammation, pathological expression of major histocompatibility foci on hepatocytes and biliary epithelia, aberrant initiation of apoptosis, modification of the extracellular matrix, and depletion of natural antioxidants can each play pivotal roles. Cholestatic liver injury derived from extrahepatic mechanical obstruction or intrahepatic cholestasis (many causes) can induce membrane damage subsequent to accumulation of membranocytolytic bile acids, copper retention, and membrane peroxidation.

Accordingly, the global economy as well is facing the worst economic catastrophe since the 1930s Great Depression. The case in Egypt is similar to the rest of the world. Despite being threatened by GDP decline and income losses; the Egyptian government has reacted early to restrain the pandemic outbreak. By mid-March, many measures had been undertaken to contain the spread of the virus. More than three months after imposing them, Egypt began lifting many of the restrictions put in place to curb the spread of coronavirus. Predictions of the potential spread of Covid-19 based on time series Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and econometric Autoregressive-Distributed Lag (ARDL) forecasting models are utilized in this paper for designing and/or evaluating countermeasures. The aim of this study is threefold, first using the most recent available data to find the best prediction models for daily cases and death in Egypt and forecast them up to 7 November 2020. Second, to analyze the effect of mobility on the incidence of the pandemic using Google Community Mobility Reports (GCMR) to evaluate the results of easing lockdown restrictions. Finally, providing some recommendations that may help lessen the spread of the virus and eradicate new deaths as possible. The results revealed that mobility of population is affecting the incidence of new cases of Covid-19 significantly over the period of the study. Additionally, the total number of infections on November 7 2020 is expected to reach 102,352 cases, while the total death toll is predicted to be 5,938 according to the most accurate methods of forecasting. Accordingly, in order to sustain the predicted flat pandemic curve, many restrictions must be continued and emergency mechanisms need to be considered. For instance, adhering to the precautions of social distancing advised by the health minister and the declared hygiene rules to ensure that infection is prevented or transmitted is necessary. Besides, being prepared with re-imposing lockdown strategies and health system support are essential among others. It should also be noted that this expected pattern can shift, yet that depends on people's actions.","Nosier, S.; Beram, R. S.",,74,16

Data showing the cytokine profiles in humans during the acute phase of MERS-CoV infection are limited. In this study, we have analyzed the profile of cytokine responses in plasma samples from patients with confirmed MERS-CoV infections (n = 7) compared to healthy controls (n = 13). The cytokine profiles, including T helper (Th) 1, Th2 and Th17 responses, were analyzed using cytometric bead array (CBA).

First, we found an upregulation of interleukin (IL)-1β and interferon (IFN)-γ mRNA levels and considerable expansions of macrophage and cluster of differentiation (CD) 8α+ T cell populations in lungs of chicken as early as day one post-hatch, following pre-hatch delivery of resiquimod. Second, we observed that resiquimod was able to act as an adjuvant when resiquimod was delivered pre-hatch along with an inactivated IBV vaccine. Finally, when the resiquimod pretreated one-day-old chickens were infected with IBV, reduction in viral shedding via oral and fecal routes was observed at 3 days post- infection. Overall, this study shows that the pre-hatch delivered resiquimod increases cell-mediated immune responses in lungs with an advantage of reduction in IBV shedding.","De Silva Senapathi, Upasama; Aboelkhair, Mohamed; Puro, Kekungu; Ali, Mariam; Amarasinghe, Aruna; Abdul-Cader, M.

However, through all this, families will continue to become pregnant, give birth, and breastfeed. Unfortunately, care of the childbearing family has been de-prioritized during the pandemic. Additionally, many healthcare practices during the pandemic have not been positive for the childbearing family or breastfeeding. Despite recommendations from the World Health Organization to promote early, direct breastfeeding and skin to skin contact, these and other recommendations are not being followed in the clinical setting. For example, some mothers have been forced to go through labor and birth alone in some institutions whilst some hospitals have limited or no parental visitation to infants in the NICU. Furthermore, hospitals are discharging mothers and their newborns early, limiting the amount of time that families receive expert lactation care, education, and technical assistance. In addition, some hospitals have furloughed staff or transferred them to COVID-19 wards, further negatively impacting direct care for families and their newborns. We are concerned that these massive changes in the care of childbearing families will be permanently adopted. Instead, we must use the pandemic to underscore the importance of human milk and breastfeeding as lifesaving medical interventions. We challenge healthcare professionals to change the current prenatal and post-birth practice paradigms to protect lactation physiology and to ensure that all families in need receive equal access to evidence-based lactation education, care and technical assistance.","Spatz, Diane L.; Davanzo, Riccardo; Müller, Janis A.; Powell, Rebecca; Rigourd, Virginie; Yates, Ann; Geddes, Donna T.; van Goudoever, Johannes B.; Bode, Lars",Front Pediatr,74,24

Embryos were divided into three groups and were inoculated in the chorioallantoic sac with 0.2 mL of UNAM-97, Mass 41 IBV (positive control), or sterile PBS (negative control). Forty-eight hours later the allatoic fluid was taken and used to start a cycle of eight passages through 9-d-old embryos. Seven days after the last passage, embryos were harvested and macroscopic lesions in all organs were recorded. Proventriculus and gizzard samples were obtained from all embryos and routinely processed for microscopic and ultrastructural examinations. The UNAM-97 IBV variant strain caused two macroscopic lesions uncommon for Mexican strains: thin-walled proventriculus and gizzard, as well as urate accumulation within an extra-embryonic peritoneal sac, leaving the body through the umbilical duct and accompanied by the yolk sac. At microscopic level, two relevant findings were observed to be produced by this variant. In the proventriculus, there was a decrease in the gland papillary branching, while the gizzard showed a significant reduction in mucosa thickness and tubular-to-proliferative-cell ratio, as well as an absence of hyaline secretion in the lumen. Electrodense material scattered in proventricular and gizzard cells was observed, with a structure consistent with that of coronaviruses. These pathological chicken embryo findings have not been reported as being caused by other IBV strains in Mexico.","Escorcia, M; Fortoul, TI; Petrone, VM; Galindo, F; Lopez, C; Tellez, G",Poultry Science,74,1

The WHO declared the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak as a public health emergency of international concern, since then several scientists are dedicated to its study. It has been observed that many human viruses have codon usage biases that match highly expressed proteins in the tissues they infect and depend on the host cell machinery for the replication and co-evolution. In this work, we analysed 91 molecular features and codon usage patterns for 339 viral genes and 463 human genes that consisted of 677,873 codon positions. Hereby, we selected the highly expressed genes from human lung tissue to perform computational studies that permit to compare their molecular features with those of SARS, SARS-CoV-2 and MERS genes. The integrated analysis of all the features revealed that certain viral genes and overexpressed human genes have similar codon usage patterns. The main pattern was the A/T bias that together with other features could propitiate the viral infection, enhanced by a host dependant specialization of the translation machinery of only some of the overexpressed genes. The envelope protein E, the membrane glycoprotein M and ORF7 could be further benefited. This could be the key for a facilitated translation and viral replication conducting to different comorbidities depending on the genetic variability of population due to the host translation machinery. This is the first codon usage approach that reveals which human genes could be potentially deregulated due to the codon usage similarities between the host and the viral genes when the virus is already inside the human cells of the lung tissues. Our work leaded to the identification of additional highly expressed human genes which are not the usual suspects but might play a role in the viral infection and settle the basis for further research in the field of human genetics associated with new viral infections. To identify the genes that could be deregulated under a viral infection is important to predict the collateral effects and determine which individuals would be more susceptible based on their genetic features and comorbidities associated.","Maldonado, Lucas L.; Bertelli, Andrea Mendoza; Kamenetzky, Laura",Sci Rep,74,23

Many, if not most of the diagnostic targets currently in use were produced early in the pandemic, using genomes sequenced and shared in early 2020. As viral diversity increases, mutations may arise in diagnostic target sites that have an impact on the performance of diagnostic tests. Here, we report on a local outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 which had gained an additional mutation at position 28890 of the nucleocapsid protein, on a background of pre-existing mutations at positions 28881, 28882, 28883 in one of the main circulating viral lineages in Wales at that time. The impact of this additional mutation had a statistically significant impact on the Ct value reported for the N gene target designed by the Chinese CDC and used in a number of commercial diagnostic products. Further investigation identified that, in viral genomes sequenced from Wales over the summer of 2020, the N gene had a higher rate of mutations in diagnostic target sites than other targets, with 115 issues identified affecting over 10% of all cases sequenced between February and the end of August 2020. In comparison an issue was identified for ORFab, the next most affected target, in less than 1.4% of cases over the same time period. This work emphasises the potential impact that mutations in diagnostic target sites can have on tracking local outbreaks, as well as demonstrating the value of genomics as a routine tool for identifying and explaining potential diagnostic primer issues as part of a laboratory quality management system. This work also indicates that with increasing genomic sequencing data availability, there is a need to re-evaluate the diagnostic targets that are in use for SARS-CoV-2 testing, to better target regions that are now demonstrated to be of lower variability.","Moore, C.; Davies, L.; Rees, R.; Gifford, L.; Lewis, H.; Plimmer, A.; Mack, A.; Pacchiarini, N.; Southgate, J.

In the present study, we aimed to evaluate the impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on dental practice by conducting an online questionnaire among the Iranian dental practitioners and finding their perspectives on the subject. METHODS: This report is based on a questionnaire that was conducted among Iranian dentists. The survey included questions that evaluate the dentists’ perceptions and attitudes toward the COVID-19 pandemic and its effect on their personal life, financial status, and the quality of dental services for patients. RESULTS: Overall, 240 dentists contributed to this study (214 general dentists and 26 specialists). The majority of the participants (n = 170, 70%) did not perform non-emergency procedures during the pandemic. The dental practitioners have suggested several strategies to decrease the risk of contagion, such as reducing treatment sessions (n = 90, 37%), strict triage of patients (n = 156, 64%), and using personal protective equipment (n = 108, 45%). However, most of the dentists (n = 210, 87%) had problems, providing personal protective equipment during the pandemic. Moreover, 97% (n = 234) of the participants reported that they encountered a decrease in their financial income since the eruption of the pandemic. CONCLUSION: Dental health care workers are at the highest risk of contracting COVID-19. Thus, dental practitioners ought to execute the standard protocols more cautiously during the pandemic. They could also lower their work hours and limit dental procedures to emergency treatments to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission. Besides, the public organizations should provide proper equipment for the dental practitioners to decrease the risk of contagion.","Ahmadi, Hanie; Ebrahimi, Alireza; Ghorbani, Farhad",BMC Oral Health,74,24

A Schwannoma-L-2 somatic cell hybrid persistently yielding high titres of mouse hepatitis virus strain JHM,9.710649,7.1154118,1984-09-30,"Abstract Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) causes encephalitis and demyelination in the central nervous system (CNS) of susceptible rodents. Astrocytes are one of the major targets for MHV infection in the CNS, and respond to MHV infection by expressing diverse molecules that may contribute to CNS pathogenesis. Here we characterized the activation of an immediate-early transcription factor Egr-1 by MHV infection in an astrocytoma cell line. We found that the expression of Egr-1 was dramatically increased following virus infection. Using various inhibitors of mitogen-activated protein kinases, we identified that the extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 were involved in the activation of Egr-1 transcription by MHV infection. Experiments with ultraviolet light-inactivated virus revealed that the induction of Egr-1 did not require virus replication and was likely mediated during cell entry. We further found that over-expression of Egr-1 suppressed the expression of BNip3, a pro-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family. This finding may provide an explanation for our previously observed down-regulation of BNip3 by MHV infection in astrocytoma cells (Cai, Liu, Yu, and Zhang, Virology 316:104–115, 2003). Furthermore, knockdown of Egr-1 by an siRNA inhibited MHV propagation, suggesting the biological relevance of Egr-1 induction to virus replication. In addition, the persistence/demylinating-positive strains (JHM and A59) induced Egr-1 expression, whereas the persistence/demylinating-negative strain (MHV-2) did not. These results indicate a correlation between the ability of MHVs to induce Egr-1 expression and their ability to cause demyelination in the CNS, which may suggest a potential role for the induction of Egr-1 in viral pathogenesis.","Cai, Yingyun; Liu, Yin; Zhang, Xuming",Virology,74,10

Besides pneumonia and acute lung injury (ALI) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), other features became evident in the context of COVID-19. These includes endothelial and coagulation dysfunction with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), along with the occurrence of neurological alterations. The multi-system nature of such viral infection is a witness to the exploitation and impairment of ubiquitous subcellular and metabolic pathways for the sake of its life-cycle, ranging from host cell invasion, replication, transmission, up to a cytopathic effect and overt systemic inflammation. In this frame, alterations in cell-clearing systems of the host are emerging as a hallmark in the pathogenesis of various respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2. Indeed, exploitation of the autophagy and proteasome pathways might contribute not only to the replication of the virus at the site of infection but also to the spreading of either mature virions or inflammatory mediators at both cellular and multisystem levels. In this frame, besides a pharmacological therapy, many researchers are wondering if some non-pharmacological substances might counteract or positively modulate the course of the infection. The pharmacological properties of natural compounds have gained increasing attention in the field of alternative and adjunct therapeutic approaches to several diseases. In particular, several naturally-occurring herbal compounds (mostly polyphenols) are reported to produce widespread antiviral, anti-inflammatory, and anti-oxidant effects while acting as autophagy and (immuno)-proteasome modulators.

Although the mechanisms driving severe disease progression remain unknown, it is possible that the abrupt clinical deterioration observed in patients with critical disease corresponds to a discrete underlying expansion of viral tropism, from infection of cells comprising respiratory linings and alveolar epithelia to direct infection and activation of inflammatory monocytes and macrophages. Dysregulated immune responses could then contribute to disease severity. This article discusses the potential role of monocyte/macrophage (Mo/Mϕ) infection by SARS-CoV-2 in mediating the immune response in severe COVID-19. Additional mechanisms of immune-enhanced disease, comprising maladaptive immune responses that may aggravate rather than alleviate severity, are also discussed. Severe acute clinical worsening in COVID-19 patients may be influenced by the emergence of antibodies that participate in hyperinflammatory monocyte response, release of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), thrombosis, platelet apoptosis, viral entry into Fc gamma receptor (FcγR)-expressing immune cells, and induction of autoantibodies with cross-reactivity against host proteins. While the potential roles of Mo/Mϕ infection and immune-enhanced pathology in COVID-19 are consistent with a broad range of clinical and laboratory findings, their prominence remains tentative pending further validation. In the interim, these proposed mechanisms present immediate avenues of inquiry that may help to evaluate the safety of candidate vaccines and antibody-based therapeutics, and to support consideration of pathway-informed, well-tolerated therapeutic candidates targeting the dysregulated immune response.","Hussman, John P.",Front Med (Lausanne),74,28

A timeline was reconstructed to chronicle significant events. Numbers were obtained for patients on treatment, treatments breaks, and COVID-19 infections amongst staff and patients. RESULTS: The COVID-19 surge had a tremendous impact on the health system including cessation of all of surgeries, including oncologic surgery, as well as transfer of all inpatient oncology services to makeshift outpatient facilities.

Ten urban hotspots accounted for 590 cases at 220 addresses (2.68 case/address), compared to 1,843 cases at 1,292 addresses in areas outside hotspots (1.43 case/address). Overall, 12% of population residing in hotspot areas accounted for 24% of all COVID-19 cases. Hotspots were concentrated in neighborhoods with low-income apartments and mobile home communities. People living in hotspots tended to be minorities and from lower socioeconomic background. Conclusion Geographic and residential risk factors might significantly account for overall burden of COVID-19 and its associated racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities. Results could geospatially guide community outreach efforts (e.g., testing/tracing, and vaccine roll out) for populations at risk for COVID-19.","Juhn, Young J.; Wheeler, Philip; Wi, Chung-Il; Bublitz, Joshua; Ryu, Euijung; Ristagno, Elizabeth; Patten, Christi",Mayo Clin Proc Innov Qual Outcomes,74,1

The B cell response showed converging IGHV3-driven BCR clusters closely associated with SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Clonality and skewing of TCR repertoires was associated with interferon type I and III responses, early CD4+ and CD8+ T cell activation and counterregulation by the coreceptors BTLA, Tim-3, PD-1, TIGIT and CD73. Tfh, Th17-like and nonconventional (but not classical anti-viral) Th1 cell polarizations were induced. SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell responses were driven by TCR clusters shared between patients with a characteristic trajectory of clonotypes and traceability over the disease course. Our data provide fundamental insight into adaptive immunity to SARS-CoV-2 with the actively updated repository providing a resource for the scientific community urgently needed to inform therapeutic concepts and vaccine development.","Schultheiß, Christoph; Paschold, Lisa; Simnica, Donjete; Mohme, Malte; Willscher, Edith; von Wenserski, Lisa; Scholz, Rebekka; Wieters, Imke; Dahlke, Christine; Tolosa, Eva; Sedding, Daniel G.; Ciesek, Sandra; Addo, Marylyn; Binder, Mascha",Immunity,74,1

The outbreak of pandemic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID 2019) has caused a global health emergency. Identification of regions with high risk for COVID 19 outbreak is a major priority of the governmental organizations and epidemiologists worldwide. The aims of the present study were to analyze the risk factors of coronavirus outbreak and identify areas with a high risk of human infection with virus in Fars Province, Iran. A geographic information system (GIS) based machine learning algorithm (MLA), support vector machine (SVM), was used for the assessment of the outbreak risk of COVID 19 in Fars Province, Iran. The daily observations of infected cases was tested in the third-degree polynomial and the autoregressive and moving average (ARMA) models to examine the patterns of virus infestation in the province and in Iran. The results of disease outbreak in Iran were compared with the data for Iran and the world. Sixteen effective factors including minimum temperature of coldest month (MTCM), maximum temperature of warmest month (MTWM), precipitation in wettest month (PWM), precipitation of driest month (PDM), distance from roads, distance from mosques, distance from hospitals, distance from fuel stations, human footprint, density of cities, distance from bus stations, distance from banks, distance from bakeries, distance from attraction sites, distance from automated teller machines (ATMs), and density of villages were selected for spatial modelling. The predictive ability of an SVM model was assessed using the receiver operator characteristic area under the curve (ROC AUC) validation technique. The validation outcome reveals that SVM achieved an AUC value of 0.786 (March 20), 0.799 (March 29), and 86.6 (April 10) a good prediction of change detection. The growth rate (GR) average for active cases in Fars for a period of 41 days was 1.26, whilst it was 1.13 in country and the world. The results of the third-degree polynomial and ARMA models revealed an increasing trend for GR with an evidence of turning, demonstrating extensive quarantines has been effective. The general trends of virus infestation in Iran and Fars Province were similar, although an explosive growth of the infected cases is expected in the country. The results of this study might assist better programming COVID 19 disease prevention and control and gaining sorts of predictive capability would have wide ranging benefits.","Pourghasemi, Hamid Reza; Pouyan, Soheila; Farajzadeh, Zakariya; Sadhasivam, Nitheshnirmal; Heidari, Bahram; Babaei, Sedigheh; Tiefenbacher, John P",,74,24

Several studies showed that the glycosylation of virus spike (S) protein and the Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor on the host cell is critical for the virus infectivity. Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations were used to explore the role of a novel mutated O-glycosylation site (D494S) on the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of S protein. This site was suggested as a key mediator of virus-host interaction. By exploring the dynamics of three O-glycosylated models and the control systems of unglcosylated S4944 and S494D complexes, it was shown that the decoration of S494 with elongated O-glycans results in stabilized interactions on the direct RBD-ACE2. Calculation of the distances between RBD and two major H1, H2 helices of ACE2 and the interacting pairs of amino acids in the interface showed that the elongated O-glycan maintains these interactions by forming several polar contacts with the neighbouring residues while it would not interfere in the direct binding interface. Relative binding free energy of RBD-ACE2 is also more favorable in the O-glycosylated models with longer glycans. The increase of RBD binding affinity to ACE2 depends on the size of attached O-glycan. By increasing the size of O-glycan, the RBD-ACE2 binding affinity will increase. Hence, this crucial factor must be taken into account for any further inhibitory approaches towards RBD-ACE2 interaction.","Rahnama, Shadi; Azimzadeh Irani, Maryam; Amininasab, Mehriar; Ejtehadi, Mohammad Reza",Sci Rep,74,20

One model to forecast disease spread depends on clinical parameters and transmission rates. Output includes the basic reproduction number R0 and the log growth rate r in the exponential phase. Methods UK data on reported deaths is used to estimate r. A likelihood for the transmission parameters is defined from a gaussian density for r using the mean and standard error of the estimate. Parameter samples from the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm lead to an estimate and credible interval for R0 and forecasts for severe and critical cases, and deaths during a lockdown. Results In the exponential phase, the UK growth rate for log(deaths) is r = 0.224 with s.e. 0.005. R0 = 5.81 with 90% CI (5.08 , 6.98). In a 12 week lockdown from 24 March with transmission parameters reduced to 20% of their previous values, around 63,000 severely ill patients will need hospitalisation by mid June, 37,000 critically ill will need intensive care, whilst over 81,000 are expected to die. Had the lockdown begun on 17 March around 16,500 severe, 9,250 critical cases and 18,500 deaths would be expected by early June. With 10% transmission, severe and critical cases peak in April. Discussion The R0 estimate is around twice the value quoted by the UK government. The NHS faces extreme pressures, even if transmission is reduced ten-fold. An earlier lockdown could have saved many lives.","Dropkin, Greg",,74,30

He was treated with tocilizumab and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG). After 6 days of treatment in ICU, he was extubated. Case 2 was a 68-year-old woman undergoing maintenance hemodialysis for 17 years who also exhibited ARDS due to COVID-19. Her clinical course resembles case 1.

These adaptive capacities require collaborative learning and working, as the complexities of changes and challenges can rarely be addressed by individuals alone or single healthcare disciplinary knowledge. So, there is a need to understand how collaborative learning practices can be developed and supported both intra and inter disciplinary in healthcare. The aim of the study is to explore the relationship between collaborative learning, and resilience to establish a framework that supports the development and application of adaptive capacities across diverse healthcare contexts and levels. Collaborative learning is premised on learning as something that occurs continuously through everyday work in the healthcare systems as professionals engaging in clinical work, and interacting with other coworkers, patients and stakeholders making local adaptations in respond to needs. METHOD AND ANALYSIS: The study applies a mixed methods design in a two-phased approach to explore and develop the relationship between collaborative learning and resilience. Phase One is exploratory using literature review, meta-synthesis, interviews and focus groups as data collection methods in empirical studies in different healthcare contexts. Phase Two uses participatory approach to develop and test a collaborative learning framework followed by an evaluation to appraise its utility using observation and focus groups as data collection procedures. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Phase One of the study is approved by the Norwegian Centre for Research Data (reference no. 864334). The findings will be disseminated through scientific articles, presentations at international conferences and through social media and popular press. This includes establishing a set of learning tools for adaptive use, that is made publicly available in Open Access repositories.","Haraldseid-Driftland, Cecilie; Aase, Karina; Wiig, Siri; Billett, Stephen",BMJ Open,74,33

METHODS: Throat swabs from patients with an ILI presenting to physicians in sentinel practices were collected during the 2016–2017 influenza season. RESULTS: A total of 52 samples tested positive by FilmArray Respiratory Panel. Forty percent were influenza A virus, and subtype H3N2 virus was the major epidemic strain. However, nearly 60% of ILI cases seen at sentinel sites were caused by non-influenza pathogens. The results of the FilmArray assay and cell culture were identical, and this assay was more sensitive than a rapid influenza diagnostic test. Genetic analyses revealed new influenza A H3N2 variants belonging to a novel subclade 3C.2a2. CONCLUSIONS: The FilmArray assay facilitates urgent testing and laboratory surveillance for common viral and bacterial respiratory pathogens. This study demonstrated the use of a highly sensitive assay using clinical samples that is feasible for application worldwide. This may lead to an increased rate of diagnosis of viral infections and to improved patient outcomes, and in particular to a reduction in the overuse of antibiotics and antivirals.","Chiu, Shu-Chun; Lin, Yung-Cheng; Wang, Hsiao-Chi; Hsu, Jen-Jen; Yeh, Ting-Kai; Liu, Hsin-Fu; Lin, Jih-Hui",Int J Infect Dis,74,17

Disproportionate spread of COVID-19 among the Indian community in Kuwait prompted heightened surveillance in this community. Aims: To study the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 patients and their contacts among the Indian community in Kuwait. Methods: Data collection was done as a part of contact tracing efforts undertaken by the Kuwaiti Ministry of Health. Results: We analysed contact-tracing data for the initial 1348 laboratory-confirmed Indian patients and 6357 contacts (5681 close and 676 casual). The mean (standard deviation) age of the patients was 39.43 (10.5) years and 76.5% of the cases were asymptomatic or had only mild symptoms. Asymptomatic patients were significantly older [40.05 (10.42) years] than patients with severe symptoms [37.54 (10.54) years] (P = 0.024). About 70% of the patients were living in shared accommodation. Most of the close contacts were living in the same household, as compared with casual contacts, who were primarily workplace contacts (P < 0.001). Among the different occupations, healthcare workers had the highest proportion of cases (18.4%). Among the 216 pairs of cases with a clear relationship between the index and secondary cases, the mean serial interval was estimated to be 3.89 (3.69) days, with a median of 3 and interquartile range of 1-5 days. Conclusion: An early increase in the number of COVID-19 cases among the Indian community could be primarily attributed to crowded living conditions and the high proportion of healthcare workers in this community.","Baskaradoss, Jagan Kumar; Alsumait, Aishah; Malik, Shaheer; Ariga, Jitendra; Geevarghese, Amrita; Francis, Roy; Vazhiyodan, Ajay; Alexander, Rajesh; Menon, Pramod; Behzadi, Sahar; AlWuhaib, Fatma; Al-Ghimlas, Fahad; AlSeaidan, Mohammad; Almudhaf, Buthaina",East Mediterr Health J,74,1

Dietary patterns are different based on cultural, environmental, technological, and economic factors. Nutritional deficiencies of energy, protein, and specific micronutrients have been shown to contribute to depressed immune function and increased susceptibility to infections. We aimed to explore the relation of dietary factors with global infection and mortality rates of COVID-19 in this study. DESIGN: In the current ecological study, the countries that had national dietary data from the Global Dietary Databases of the United Nations and Coronavirus disease statistics from the World Health Organization (WHO) were included. The countries that had Coronavirus disease statistics from the WHO were consecutively checked for the recent data of the dietary factors. SETTING: World. PARTICIPANTS: 158 countries across the world. MEASUREMENTS: infection and mortality rates of COVID-19; dietary factors. RESULTS: The median crude infection and mortality rates by COVID-19 were 87.78 (IQR: 468.03) and 0.0015 (IQR: 0.0059), respectively. The two highest percentage of the crude infection rate were between 0 and 500 (75.9%) and 500–1000 (8.9%) per one million persons. The regression analysis showed that the crude infection rate has been increased by raising consuming fruits (Beta: 0.237; P=0.006) and calcium (Beta: 0.286; P=0.007) and was decreased with rising consuming beans and legumes (Beta: −0.145; P=0.038). The analysis showed that the crude mortality rate was increased by raising consuming sugar-sweetened beverages (Beta: 0.340; P<0.001). Whereas, the crude mortality rate by COVID-19 has been decreased by increasing fruits consuming (Beta: −0.226; P=0.047) and beans and legumes (Beta: −0.176; P=0.046). CONCLUSION: The present study showed the higher intake of fruits and sugar-sweetened beverages had a positive effect on infection and mortally rates by COVID-19, respectively. In contrast, the higher intake of beans and legumes had a negative effect on both increasing infection and mortality rates.","Abdulah, Deldar Morad; Hassan, A. B.",J Nutr Health Aging,74,20

Although passive immunization with COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP) provides a safe and viable therapeutic option, the selection of optimal units for therapy in a timely fashion remains a barrier. Study design and methods: Since virus neutralization is a necessary characteristic of plasma that can benefit recipients, the neutralizing titers of plasma samples were measured using a retroviral-pseudotype assay. Binding antibody titers to the spike (S) protein were also determined by a clinically available serological assay (Ortho-Vitros total IG), and an in-house ELISA. The results of these assays were compared to a measurement of antibodies directed to the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV2 S protein (Promega Lumit Dx). Results: All measures of antibodies were highly variable, but correlated, to different degrees, with each other. However, the anti-RBD antibodies correlated with viral neutralizing titers to a greater extent than the other antibody assays. Discussion: Our observations support the use of an anti-RBD assay such as the Lumit Dx assay, as an optimal predictor of the neutralization capability of CCP.","Janaka, S. K.; Clark, N. M.; Evans, D.

Among the first responders to this monumental workforce development challenge were the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration-funded Technology Transfer Centers (TTCs), which are charged with building the behavioral health workforce’s capacity to provide evidence-based prevention, treatment, and recovery services. TTCs documented unprecedented attendance at their events in the early months of the pandemic. This study applied content analysis to identify the most common COVID-related technical assistance (TA) topics and examine attendance by topic from March to July 2020. Across 393 events, TA topics explicitly related to COVID-19 encompassed eight emergent themes: (a) delivering services via telehealth, (b) providing support and services to behavioral health consumers, (c) promoting workforce self-care, (d) understanding new laws/policies, (e) delivering evidence-based practices, (f) advancing racial equity, (g) offering networking spaces, and (h) altering organizational management and communication infrastructure. The most heavily attended events focused on the TA themes “Advancing Racial Equity” (average = 352) and “Telehealth Service Delivery” (average = 271). There was a documented shift from more intensive TA to briefer, more targeted TA provision. The TTCs rapidly virtualized training and TA offerings to address workforce needs and serve as a model for providing remote workforce development support during the COVID-19 pandemic and future national crises.","Molfenter, Todd",Transl Behav Med,74,16

Therefore, this pilot study aimed to evaluate the effects of a dog-assisted education program on the postural, oculomotor, linguistic, and autonomy dimensions in children affected by severe and multiple disabilities. A total of 14 children aged 3–12 years and affected by intellectual and physical disabilities participated in 12 sessions of the dog-assisted program where participants had to play with dogs. Children who participated in the study improved their postural control, eye-motor coordination, expression of sensations and feelings, spontaneous interaction, autonomy, and confidence. ABSTRACT: Animal-assisted interventions have shown promising benefits in different populations such as children with cerebral palsy or autism spectrum disorder. Human–animal interaction leads to different physical, cognitive, and emotional benefits in the child. The aim of the current pilot study was to evaluate the effects of a dog-assisted education program on the postural, oculomotor, linguistic and autonomy dimensions in children affected by severe and multiple disabilities. Fourteen children aged 3–12 years and affected by intellectual and physical disabilities participated in a dog-assisted program consisted of 12 sessions. The intervention involved different types of activities, exercises, and games with the dogs. A strict protocol to ensure animal wellbeing and avoid any type of stress or fatigue was followed. Children who participated in the study improved their postural control, eye-motor coordination, expression of sensations and feelings, spontaneous interaction, autonomy, and confidence. However, these results must be taken with caution due to the lack of a control group and the heterogeneity of the participants.","Lobato Rincón, Luis Lucio; Rivera Martín, Beatriz; Medina Sánchez, María Ángeles; Villafaina, Santos; Merellano-Navarro, Eugenio; Collado-Mateo, Daniel",Animals (Basel),74,5

Utilizing Oxford Nanopore technologies, we sequenced paired samples of three patients with positive RT-PCR results in a 1–2-month window period, and subsequent phylogenetics and genetic polymorphism analysis of these genomes was performed. Herein, we report, for the first time, genomic evidence of one case of reinfection in Colombia, exhibiting different SARS-CoV-2 lineage classifications between samples (B.1 and B.1.1.269). Furthermore, we report two cases of possible viral persistence, highlighting the importance of deepening our understanding on the evolutionary intra-host traits of this virus throughout different timeframes of disease progression. These results emphasize the relevance of genomic surveillance as a tool for understanding SARS-CoV-2 infection dynamics, and how this may translate effectively to future control and mitigations efforts, such as the national vaccination program.","Ramírez, Juan David; Muñoz, Marina; Ballesteros, Nathalia; Patiño, Luz H.; Castañeda, Sergio; Rincón, Carlos A.; Mendez, Claudia; Oliveros, Carolina; Perez, Julie; Márquez, Elizabeth K.; Ortiz, Frank de los Santos; Correa-Cárdenas, Camilo A.; Duque, Maria Clara; Paniz-Mondolfi, Alberto",Vaccines (Basel),74,6

This study was carried out retrospectively at the Burn Unit of Dicle University Medical Faculty Hospital. The burn cases during the COVID‐19 outbreak were compared with those of the previous 2 years. Statistical analyses were carried out using the IBM SPSS (Statistics Package for Social Sciences) Statistics 25. Descriptive statistics, independent samples t‐test, Kolmogorov‐Smirnov test, and Shapiro‐Wilk test were used for data evaluation. Results were evaluated at 95% confidence interval and P < .05 significance level. It was determined that burn cases were reduced by half during the COVID‐19 compared to the previous 2 years. Despite the increase in the number of third‐degree burns and surgeries, it was determined that the length of hospital stay decreased by an average of two thirds. Hot liquids have been identified as the most important cause of burns in all years. New studies should be conducted in order to examine the social dimension of COVID‐19 pandemic in burn cases and to prevent these cases completely. The short hospital stay preferred by clinicians after COVID‐19 and possible problems that may arise should be investigated.","Akkoç, Mehmet Fatih; Bülbüloğlu, Semra; Özdemir, Mehmet",Int Wound J,74,1

PEDV pathogenesis is strain-specific, and studies in neonatal pigs have demonstrated that the PEDV non-S-INDEL strains are more pathogenic than the PEDV S-INDEL strains. RNA viruses, including PEDV, can interact with a large number of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) in the intestinal mucosa, including toll-like receptors (TLRs) and RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs). We investigated the differential gene modulation of TLRs, RIG-I, and downstream mediators on the intestinal mucosa of neonatal pigs infected with PEDV S-INDEL and non-S-INDEL strains. Ten five-day-old piglets were inoculated orally with 10 ml of 10(4) TCDI(50)/ml of either PEDV non-S-INDEL or S-INDEL strains. PEDV S-INDEL infection induced pro-inflammatory cytokines through the non-canonical NF-κB signaling pathway by activating RIG-I. In contrast, PEDV non-S-INDEL infection suppressed the induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines and type 1 interferon production by down-regulation of TLRs and downstream signaling molecules.","Temeeyasen, G.; Sinha, A.; Gimenez-Lirola, L.G.; Zhang, J.Q.; Piñeyro, P.E.",Virology,74,26

Each of these processes is characterized by a myriad of injurious events, including apoptosis, microvascular dysfunction, abnormal coagulation, and dysregulated host immunity. Only recently have platelets—long considered merely effectors of thrombosis—been implicated in inflammatory conditions and the pathobiology of these disease processes. A growing body of evidence suggests a prominent role for maladaptive platelet activation and aggregation during sepsis and ARDS and has begun to underscore the pluripotential influence of platelets on outcomes in critical illness. Not only do platelets enhance vascular injury through thrombotic mechanisms but also appear to help orchestrate pathologic immune responses and are pivotal players in facilitating leukocyte recruitment to vulnerable tissue. These events contribute to the organ damage and poor patient outcomes that still plague the care of these high-risk individuals. An understanding of the role of platelets in critical illness also highlights the potential for both the development of risk stratification schema and the use of novel, targeted therapies that might alter the natural history of sepsis, acute lung injury, and ARDS. Future studies of adenosine, platelet polyphosphates, and the platelet transcriptome/proteome also should add considerably to our ability to unravel the mysteries of the versatile platelet.","Katz, Jason N.; Kolappa, Kamalkumar P.; Becker, Richard C.",Chest,74,6

OBJECTIVE: To identify and assess the psychological effects of the COVID‐19 pandemic on healthcare professionals in Khartoum state hospitals 2021. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Generalized Anxiety Scale (GAD‐7), Perceived Stress Scale (PSS‐10), and Work–Family Balance Measure Scale were used to assess the psychological impact of doctors and nurses working in four big hospitals in Sudan, by an online questionnaire, analyzed by the statistical package for social science (SPSS) during February. RESULTS: Most of the participants had minimal to mild anxiety according to GAD‐7 score, 121 (35.2%) and 103 (29.9%), respectively. Using PSS‐10, the cutoff point was determined as 19 as the mean for total score was 19.2 ± 6.2, accordingly, more than half had high levels of stress (scored 19 and above) 189 (54.9%). For the Work–Family Balance Scale, 10 was regarded as the cutoff point. There was a significant association between specialty and stress level p‐value .032. No significant correlations were found between age and stress level, neither between age and anxiety level (r −.100, p‐value .064 and r = −.022, p‐value .683, respectively).

Our previous studies have demonstrated that peptides derived from HR2 region could inhibit SARS-CoV entry. However, synthesis of these peptides is at high cost. In this study, we designed two recombinant proteins, one containing two HR1 and one HR2 peptides (denoted HR121), and the other consisting of two HR2 and one HR1 peptides (designated HR212). These two proteins could be easily purified with the low cost of production, exhibiting high stability and potent inhibitory activity on entry of the HIV/SARS pseudoviruses with IC(50) values of 4.13 and 0.95 μM, respectively.

OBJECTIVES: This review aims to ascertain how the pandemic has impacted primary care service provision/patients and to examine strategies to mitigate these impacts. METHODS: The scoping review framework comprised a six-stage process developed by Arksey and O'Malley. The search process was guided by the Joanna Briggs Institute three-step search strategy and involved searching the PubMed, Embase, Scopus, CINAHL Plus, and Cochrane Library databases. The review is reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews. A thematic analysis approach by Braun and Clarke was used to interpret the findings. RESULTS: Thirty-two studies from 18 countries and six continents were included, 13 reported original research, three were reviews, and 16 were case reports reporting healthcare systems’ experiences of dealing with the pandemic. Emerging themes concerned the COVID-19 pandemic’s impact on primary care service provision and patients, the impact of the rapid transition to telemedicine due to COVID-19 on primary care, and strategies to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on primary care (i.e. infection prevention and control measures, alternatives/modifications to traditional service delivery or workflow, government policy responses, and education).

These groups include picorna-, alpha-, and coronaviruses infecting animals and como-, poty-, tobamo-, tricorna-, hordei-, and furoviruses of plants, totalling 21 viruses. It has been demonstrated that the viral NTP-motif-containing proteins constitute three distinct families, the sequences within each family being similar to each other at a statistically highly significant level. A lower, but still valid similarity has also been revealed between the families. An overall alignment has been generated, which includes several highly conserved sequence stretches. The two most prominent of the latter contain the socalled “A” and “B” sites of the NTP-motif, with four of the five invariant amino acid residues observed within these sequences. These observations, taken together with the results of comparative analysis of the positions occupied by respective proteins (domains) in viral multidomain proteins, suggest that all the NTP-motif-containing proteins of positive-strand RNA viruses are homologous, constituting a highly diverged monophyletic group. In this group the “A” and “B” sites of the NTP-motif are the most conserved sequences and, by inference, should play the principal role in the functioning of the proteins. A hypothesis is proposed that all these proteins posses NTP-binding capacity and possibly NTPase activity, performing some NTP-dependent function in viral RNA replication. The importance of phylogenetic analysis for the assessment of the significance of the occurrence of the NTP-motif (and of sequence motifs of this sort in general) in proteins is emphasized.","Gorbalenya, Alexander E.; Blinov, Vladimir M.; Donchenko, Alexei P.; Koonin, Eugene V.",J Mol Evol,74,2

The success of RV infection was assayed by semi-nested RT-PCR of the mucosal surface fluid taken 48 h after incubation. Intracellular RVs were visualized by in situ hybridization (ISH). Secretion of the cytokines, IL-6 and IL-8, into the culture media was quantitated by ELISA. After 7 days of culture, the turbinate mucosae did not show significant damage. A PCR product indicating successful RV infection was detected in 5 out of 10 mucosal tissues. ISH showed a very small number of positively stained cells focally located in the epithelial layer. In the beginning 24 h after infection, secretion of IL-6 and IL-8 into the culture media of infected mucosae was significantly greater than into the media of control mucosae.

METHODS: Symptomatic pregnant women with COVID‐19 diagnosis in whom PCR for SARS‐CoV‐2 was performed at delivery using maternal serum and at least one of the biological samples: cord blood (CB), amniotic fluid (AF), colostrum and/or oropharyngeal swab (OPS) of the neonate. The association of parameters with maternal, AF and/or CB positivity and the influence of SARS‐CoV‐2 positivity in AF and/or CB on neonatal outcomes were investigated. RESULTS: Overall 73.4% (80/109) were admitted in hospital due to COVID‐19, 22.9% needed intensive care and there were four maternal deaths. Positive RT‐PCR for SARS‐CoV‐2 was observed in 14.7% of maternal blood, 13.9% of AF, 6.7% of CB, 2.1% of colostrum and 3.7% of OPS samples. The interval between COVID‐19 symptoms and delivery was inversely associated with SARS‐CoV‐2 positivity in the maternal blood (p = 0.002) and in the AF and/or CB (p = 0.049). Maternal viremia was associated with positivity for SARS‐CoV‐2 in AF and/or CB (p = 0.001). SARS‐CoV‐2 positivity in the compartments was not associated with neonatal outcomes.

In a representative sample of 1142 families, the adults responsible for food purchases and in charge of preparing meals were assessed with a self-administrated questionnaire measuring quantity and typology of FW. These data were linked with food purchases figures measured as an average of four weeks. Italian families wasted 399 kg of food per week (4.4% of the weight of food purchased), which correspond to a monetary value of €1.052 (3.8% of the overall food expenditure). Clustering the food groups according to waste quantity, typology, and monetary value made it possible to show that price has a role in the generation of food waste, as the lower the unitary cost, the higher the quantity of waste. Consequently, foods with high unitary costs were less wasted. The results of this study showed that Italian consumers are sensitive to the economic impact of waste and this should be considered in sensitization campaigns.","Aureli, Vittoria; Scalvedi, Maria Luisa; Rossi, Laura",Foods,74,16

It has been determined that the disease is very contagious and can cause acute respiratory distress (ARD). Medical imaging has the potential to help identify, detect, and quantify the severity of this infection. This work seeks to develop a novel auto-detection technique for verified COVID-19 cases that can detect aberrant alterations in traditional X-ray pictures. METHODS: Nineteen separate-colored layers were created from X ray scans of patients diagnosed with COVID-19. Each layer represents objects that have a similar contrast and can be represented by a single color. On a single layer, objects with similar contrasts are formed. A single color image was created by extracting all the objects from all the layers. The prototype model could recognize a wide range of abnormal changes in the image texture based on color differentiation. This was true even when the contrast values of the detected uncleared abnormalities varied a little. RESULTS: The results indicate that the proposed novel method is 91% accurate in detecting and grading COVID-19 lung infection when compared to the opinions of three experienced radiologists evaluating chest X-ray images. Additionally, the method can be used to determine the infection site and severity of the disease by categorizing the X-rays into five severity levels. CONCLUSION: By comparing affected tissue to healthy tissue, the proposed COVID-19 auto-detection method can identify locations and indicate the severity of the disease, as well as predict where the disease may spread.","Alqahtani, Mohammed; Abbas, Mohamed; Alqahtani, Ali; Alshahrani, Mohammad; Alkulib, Abdulhadi; Alelyani, Magbool; Almarhaby, Awad",Current medical imaging,74,20

A series of wind tunnel experiments were conducted using a 1:30 scale model that represented the real structures under study. The objective of this paper is to study the behaviour of concentration fluctuations through transient analysis. Tracer gas was continuously released from a point source located at different positions, and a time series of fluctuating concentrations were recorded at a large number of points using fast flame ionization detectors. The experimental data were analysed to provide a comprehensive data set including variances and associated statistical quantities. Both the unsteady characteristics of the system and their potential practical impact are presented and discussed. Under crowd living conditions, the air pollutant exhausted from one household could probably re-enter into the neighbouring households, traveling with ambient airflow. Such pollutant dispersion process is defined as air cross-contamination in this study. The results indicate that the wind-induced cross-contamination around the studied type of high-rise building should not be overlooked, and the fluctuating concentrations should be paid attention to particularly during the evaluation of a potential contamination risk. This study can help deepen our understanding of the mechanisms of air cross-contamination, and will be useful for implementing optimization strategies to improve the built environments in metropolitan cities such as Hong Kong.","Liu, X.P.; Niu, J.L.; Kwok, K.C.S.",J Hazard Mater,74,16

Therefore, this study aims to probe psychological resilience of healthcare workers. The findings of this study showed that in order to raise psychological resilience of healthcare professionals working during the COVID-19 pandemic their quality of sleep, positive emotions and life satisfaction need to be enhanced. Psychological resilience levels of healthcare workers in their later years were found to be higher. Doctors constitute the group with the lowest levels of psychological resilience among healthcare workers. The current study is considered to have contributed to the literature in this regard.

Therefore, we undertook to investigate changes in the lipid metabolism and survival rate, using 3D4/31 macrophages and Dudleya brittonii which has been used as a traditional asthma treatment. METHODS: 3D4/31 macrophages were used as the in vitro porcine alveolar macrophages model. The cells were activated by exposure to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). Dudleya brittonii extraction was performed with distilled water. For evaluating the cell survival rate, we performed the water-soluble tetrazolium salt cell viability assay and growth curve analysis. To confirm cell death, cell cycle and intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were measured using flow cytometric analysis by applying fluorescence dye dichlorofluorescein diacetate and propidium iodide. Furthermore, we also evaluated cellular lipid accumulation with oil red O staining, and fatty acid synthesis related genes expression levels using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) with SYBR green dye. Glycolysis, fatty acid oxidation, and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle related gene expression levels were measured using qPCR after exposure to Dudleya brittonii extract (DB) for 12 h. RESULTS: The ROS production and cell death were induced by PMA treatment, and exposure to DB reduced the PMA induced downregulation of cell survival. The PMA and DB treatments upregulated the lipid accumulation, with corresponding increase in the acetyl-CoA carboxylase alpha, fatty acid synthase mRNA expressions. DB-PMA co-treatment reduced the glycolysis genes expression, but increased the expressions of fatty acid oxidation and TCA cycle genes. CONCLUSION: This study provides new insights and directions for further research relating to the immunity of porcine respiratory system, by employing a model based on alveolar macrophages and natural materials.","Kim, Hyungkuen; Jeon, Eek Hyung; Park, Byung-Chul; Kim, Sung-Jo",Asian-Australas J Anim Sci,74,16

Nurses' disaster competence, motivation for disaster engagement, and factors that impact their motivation to respond to disaster events need to be understood. The purposes of the study were to determine the predictive relationships between Taiwanese nurses' disaster competence, anticipatory disaster stress, and motivation for disaster engagement. A cross-sectional design was used to analyze data collected between August 2017 and December 2017 from eight hospitals in southern Taiwan. Ninety participants who met the recruitment criteria completed and returned questionnaires with an 88.24% response rate. Data collection involved administering the Disaster Nursing Competence Questionnaire, Anticipatory Disaster Stress Questionnaire, and the Motivation of Disaster Engagement Questionnaire. The results indicated that anticipatory disaster stress was positively correlated with disaster competence and motivation for disaster engagement. Disaster competence and willingness to join a hospital disaster rescue predicts an individuals' motivation for disaster engagement.

To accomplish that goal, we have developed a mathematical model that describes the control of a SARS-CoV-2 infection by the innate and adaptive immune components. Invasion of the virus triggers the innate immunity, whereby interferon renders some of the target cells resistant to infection, and infected cells are removed by effector cells. The adaptive immune response is represented by plasma cells and virus-specific antibodies. The model is parameterized and then validated against viral load measurements collected in COVID-19 patients. We apply the model to simulate three potential anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapies: (1) Remdesivir, a repurposed drug that has been shown to inhibit the transcription of SARS-CoV-2, (2) an alternative (hypothetical) therapy that inhibits the virus’ entry into host cells, and (3) convalescent plasma transfusion therapy. Simulation results point to the importance of early intervention, i.e., for any of the three therapies to be effective, it must be administered sufficiently early, not more than a day or two after the onset of symptoms. The model can serve as a key component in integrative platforms for rapid in silico testing of potential COVID-19 therapies and vaccines.","Sadria, Mehrshad; Layton, Anita T.",Viruses,74,15

Materials and Methods: This study was first started in 2019 in the western of Romania, to analyze the differences regarding the implantations of intra-cardiac devices such as permanent pacemakers (PPM), cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT), or implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICD) in 351 patients with and without DM and the situation was reanalyzed at the end of 2020. Results: of the first 351 patients with and without DM. 28.20% of these patients had type 2 DM (p = 0.022), exceeding more than twice the prevalence of DM in the general population (11%). Patients with DM were younger (p = 0.022) and required twice as often CRT (p = 0.002) as non-diabetic patients. The state of these procedures was reanalyzed at the end of 2020, a dramatic decrease of all new device implantations being observed, both in non-diabetic and in patients with type 2 DM (79.37%, respectively 81.82%).

To assess its prevalence, it is necessary to have adequate models that allow real-time modeling of the impact of various quarantine measures by the state. The SIR model, which is implemented using a multi-agent system based on mobile cellular automata, was improved. The paper suggests ways to improve the rules of the interaction and behavior of agents. Methods of comparing the parameters of the SIR model with real geographical, social and medical indicators have been developed. That allows the modeling of the spatial distribution of COVID-19 as a single location and as the whole country consisting of individual regions that interact with each other by transport, taking into account factors such as public transport, supermarkets, schools, universities, gyms, churches, parks. The developed model also allows us to assess the impact of quarantine, restrictions on transport connections between regions, to take into account such factors as the incubation period, the mask regime, maintaining a safe distance between people, and so on. A number of experiments were conducted in the work, which made it possible to assess both the impact of individual measures to stop the pandemic and their comprehensive application. A method of comparing computer-time and dynamic parameters of the model with real data is proposed, which allowed assessing the effectiveness of the government in stopping the pandemic in the Chernivtsi region, Ukraine. A simulation of the pandemic spread in countries such as Slovakia, Turkey and Serbia was also conducted.

Quantitative evidence has shown that many young people have struggled with their mental health, but little is understood about the qualitative impact of social distancing restrictions on mental health, wellbeing and social lives. We therefore sought to elicit the views and experiences of adolescents and young adults living in the UK during the pandemic. Methods Semi-structured qualitative interviews were undertaken with 37 participants aged 13-24. Results We identified 4 superordinate themes most commonly described by participants about their experiences during the pandemic, including: a) missing social contact during lockdown, b) disruption to education, c) changes to social relationships, and d) improved wellbeing during lockdown. Although we identified some positive experiences during the pandemic, including an increased awareness of mental health and stronger relationship ties, many said they struggled with loneliness, a decline in mental health, and anxiety about socialising after the pandemic. Conclusions Findings suggest that some young people may have felt less stigma talking about their mental health now compared to before the COVID-19 pandemic. However, many are worried about how the pandemic has affected their education and social connections and may require additional psychological, practical and social support. Our findings highlight the important role that education providers play in providing a source of information and support to adolescents and young adults during times of uncertainty.","McKinlay, A.

AIMS: We sought to measure the global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the volumes for mechanical thrombectomy, stroke, and intracranial hemorrhage hospitalizations over a three-month period at the height of the pandemic (1 March–31 May 2020) compared with two control three-month periods (immediately preceding and one year prior). METHODS: Retrospective, observational, international study, across 6 continents, 40 countries, and 187 comprehensive stroke centers. The diagnoses were identified by their ICD-10 codes and/or classifications in stroke databases at participating centers. RESULTS: The hospitalization volumes for any stroke, intracranial hemorrhage, and mechanical thrombectomy were 26,699, 4002, and 5191 in the three months immediately before versus 21,576, 3540, and 4533 during the first three pandemic months, representing declines of 19.2% (95%CI, −19.7 to −18.7), 11.5% (95%CI, −12.6 to −10.6), and 12.7% (95%CI, −13.6 to −11.8), respectively. The decreases were noted across centers with high, mid, and low COVID-19 hospitalization burden, and also across high, mid, and low volume stroke/mechanical thrombectomy centers. High-volume COVID-19 centers (−20.5%) had greater declines in mechanical thrombectomy volumes than mid- (−10.1%) and low-volume (−8.7%) centers (p < 0.0001). There was a 1.5% stroke rate across 54,366 COVID-19 hospitalizations. SARS-CoV-2 infection was noted in 3.9% (784/20,250) of all stroke admissions. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic was associated with a global decline in the volume of overall stroke hospitalizations, mechanical thrombectomy procedures, and intracranial hemorrhage admission volumes. Despite geographic variations, these volume reductions were observed regardless of COVID-19 hospitalization burden and pre-pandemic stroke/mechanical thrombectomy volumes.",,Int J Stroke,74,24

However, thus far, it is not clear whether viral infection plays an important role in the etiology of nonresponding CAP and whether there is a significant difference in the clinical characteristics between viral and nonviral nonresponding CAP. METHODS: From 2016 to 2019, nonresponding CAP patients were retrospectively enrolled in our study. All patients received bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and virus detection in BAL fluid by multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and clinical, laboratory, and radiographic data were collected. RESULTS: A total of 43 patients were included. The median age was 62 years, and 65.1% of patients were male. Overall, 20 patients (46.5%) were identified with viral infection. Of these viruses, influenza virus (n = 8) and adenovirus (n = 7) were more frequently detected, and others included herpes simplex virus, human enterovirus, cytomegalovirus, human coronavirus 229E, rhinovirus, and parainfluenza virus. Compared with nonviral nonresponding CAP, only ground-glass opacity combined with consolidation was a more common imaging manifestation in viral nonresponding CAP. However, no obvious differences were found in clinical and laboratory findings between the presence and the absence of viral infections. CONCLUSIONS: Viral infections were particularly frequent in adults with nonresponding CAP. The ground-glass opacity combined with consolidation was a specific imaging manifestation for viral nonresponding CAP, while the clinical and laboratory data showed no obvious differences between viral and nonviral nonresponding CAP.","Zhang, Hao; Han, Yinling; Jin, Zhangchu; Ying, Yinghua; Lan, Fen; Huang, Huaqiong; Wang, Shaobin; Zhou, Hongwei; Zhang, Rong; Hua, Wen; Shen, Huahao; Li, Wen; Yan, Fugui",Can Respir J,74,3

One such example is the activation of mast cells, basophils and eosinophils via the stimulation of the FcεRI receptor by IgE/allergen complexes. The possible role of Syk in inflammatory signaling cascades has led to the development of pharmacological agents designed to block the Syk catalytic domain as potential novel therapeutics. Whilst the enzymatic activity of Syk lends towards the design of small-molecule inhibitors, other attention has focused on the possibility of targeting Syk expression using anti-sense oligonucleotides as an alternate means of anti-inflammatory therapy. In this study, we compared the ability of multiple optimized Syk siRNA sequences and small-molecule Syk inhibitors to block FcεRI-mediated signal transduction, degranulation and TNFα secretion in the basophilic cell line RBL-2H3. We also characterized the specificity of each siRNA sequence with regards to off-target induction of the interferon-inducible gene IFIT1. We identified a single siRNA sequence, which displayed a favorable profile of efficient Syk knockdown, blockage of FcεRI-mediated signal transduction, degranulation and TNFα secretion and a lack of IFIT1 induction. The effect of this siRNA was comparable to that of the Syk kinase domain inhibitors BAY61-3606 and R406. The identification of an active and specific Syk siRNA could be a basis for the development of therapeutic Syk siRNAs against inflammatory diseases.","Sanderson, Michael P.; Gelling, Stephen J.; Rippmann, Jörg F.; Schnapp, Andreas",Cell Immunol,74,20

A review of literature concerning the association between hypokinetic arrhythmias and COVID‐19 from January 2020 to February 2021 was performed. The key‐words used for the research were: “sinus node disfunction,” “sick sinus syndrome (SSS),” “sino‐atrial block,” “atrio‐ventricular block (AVB),” “bradyarrhythmias,” and “COVID‐19″ or ”SARS‐CoV‐2.″ Excluding “relative bradycardia,” a total of 38 cases of bradyarrhythmia related to SARS‐CoV‐2 infection have been described, even in very young people, requiring in many cases a definitive pacemaker implantation. Furthermore, we report a case of non‐hospitalized 47‐years old man with a SSS developed as a consequence of mild SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. While in all described cases heart conduction disorders were found at presentation of the infection or during hospitalization for COVID‐19, in our case the diagnosis of SSS was made after the resolution of the infection. Although rarely, heart conduction disorders may occur during COVID‐19 and the present case highlights that a cardiological follow up may be desirable even after the resolution of infection, especially in the presence of symptoms suggesting a possible heart involvement.","Gatto, Maria Chiara; Persi, Alessandro; Tung, Marzia; Masi, Rosa; Canitano, Stefano; Kol, Amir",Pacing Clin Electrophysiol,74,16

It can be observed that currently in India the spread pattern is nearly exponential. It can be seen further that the number of cases is still continuing to grow very fast. Therefore, instead of going for rigorous time series analysis, we may opt for looking at the data from a recent date downwards, and short term forecasts based on simple numerical analytical methods can be made accordingly.","Baruah, H.

This swift response should ensure clearance of the threat and resolution of stimuli which drive inflammation. However, once the threat is subdued this influx of immune cells should be followed by clearance of recruited cells through apoptosis and subsequent efferocytosis, expectoration or retrograde migration back into the circulation. This cycle of cell recruitment, containment of threat and then clearance of immune cells and repair is held in exquisite balance to limit host damage. Advanced age is often associated with detrimental changes to the balance described above. Cellular functions are altered including a reduced ability to traffic accurately towards inflammation, a reduced ability to clear pathogens and sustained inflammation. These changes, seen with age, are heightened in lung disease, and most chronic and acute lung diseases are associated with an exaggerated influx of immune cells, such as neutrophils, to the airways as well as considerable inflammation. Indeed, across many lung diseases, pathogenesis and progression has been associated with the sustained presence of trafficking cells, with examples including chronic diseases such as Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease and Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis and acute infections such as Pneumonia and Pneumonitis. In these instances, there is evidence that dysfunctional and sustained recruitment of cells to the airways not only increases host damage but impairs the hosts ability to effectively respond to microbial invasion. Targeting leukocyte migration in these instances, to normalise cellular responses, has therapeutic promise. In this review we discuss the current evidence to support the trafficking cell as an immunotherapeutic target in lung disease, and which potential mechanisms or pathways have shown promise in early drug trials, with a focus on the neutrophil, as the quintessential trafficking immune cell.","Belchamber, Kylie B.

All aspects of the coagulation cascade, primary hemostasis, coagulation, and fibrinolysis, can be affected. As a consequence, thrombosis and disseminated intravascular coagulation, hemorrhage, or both, may occur. Investigation of coagulation disorders as a consequence of different viral infections have not been performed uniformly. Common pathways are therefore not fully elucidated. In many severe viral infections there is no treatment other than supportive measures. A better understanding of the pathophysiology behind the association of viral infections and coagulation disorders is crucial for developing therapeutic strategies. This is of special importance in case of severe complications, such as those seen in hemorrhagic viral infections, the incidence of which is increasing worldwide.

We evaluated the changes in retinal detachment (RD) presentation and surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic and propose solutions to minimize the detrimental effects of lockdown on RD diagnosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar were searched for relevant articles with the keywords “Retinal detachment” AND “Coronavirus OR COVID-19 OR SARS OR MERS.” RESULTS: The COVID-19 lockdown was associated a 53–66% reduction in RD presentation. The decrease in the rate of macula-on RD, the increase in the mean duration of symptoms, and the rise in the number of patients with proliferative vitreoretinopathy were all suggestive of a delayed presentation of RD. Moreover, a drop of 56–62% in RD repair surgeries was observed. However, the most frequently performed ophthalmic surgery changed from cataract surgery in April 2019 to RD repair in April 2020. Using phacovitrectomy instead of vitrectomy alone can reduce the number of operations in ophthalmology centers, decrease the use of personal protective equipment by 50%, and cut costs per patient by 17–20%. Also, developing a well-organized telemedicine system can decrease unnecessary visits and delayed presentations. CONCLUSION: Delay in RD presentation and surgery is associated with a poorer prognosis. Optimizing the guidelines of RD management and developing a well-organized telemedicine system can minimize the impact of lockdown on RD management.","Roshanshad, Amirhossein; Binder, Susanne",Spektrum Augenheilkd,74,26

RNA pseudoknots are also of interest because of their key role in the control of ribosomal frameshifting by viral RNAs. Their mechanical properties are directly relevant to their unfolding by ribosomes during translation. We have used optical tweezers to study the kinetics and thermodynamics of mechanical unfolding and refolding of single RNA molecules. Here we describe the unfolding of the frameshifting pseudoknot from infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), three constituent hairpins, and three mutants of the IBV pseudoknot. All four pseudoknots cause −1 programmed ribosomal frameshifting. We have measured the free energies and rates of mechanical unfolding and refolding of the four frameshifting pseudoknots. Our results show that the IBV pseudoknot requires a higher force than its corresponding hairpins to unfold. Furthermore, its rate of unfolding changes little with increasing force, in contrast with the rate of hairpin unfolding. The presence of Mg(2+) significantly increases the kinetic barriers to unfolding the IBV pseudoknot, but has only a minor effect on the hairpin unfolding. The greater mechanical stability of pseudoknots compared to hairpins, and their kinetic insensitivity to force supports the hypothesis that −1 frameshifting depends on the difficulty of unfolding the mRNA.","Green, Lisa; Kim, Chul-Hyun; Bustamante, Carlos; Tinoco, Ignacio",J Mol Biol,74,24

Yet, the socio-contextual determinants of a biopsychosocial phenomenon as sleep are poorly investigated. We examine changes concomitantly occurring in the child's sleep per familial and community stressors. Methods During the pre-COVID-19 outbreak period, in 24 minority children (5.4±1.7 years old, 54.2% girls), sleep was objectively measured 24-hours for two consecutive weeks, and this was repeated three times over the study period of three months. The caregiver filled out questionnaires surveying sociodemographic, community and family aspects. Results Children went to bed at 22:26 and woke up at 07:04, with each a variability of about 50 minutes. Money and time were revealed as related key stressors to sleep. Five dimensions best fitted their association. In general, concurrent changes within the individual child indicate that mean sleep variables seem to relate to predominantly features of the stressors (explained variance of 34.7% to 56.7%), while variability of sleep tends to associate to situational aspects of the stressors (explained variance of 30.4% to 61.8%). Associations were best explained in terms of the 24-hour dimension, particularly exposing sleep variability. Conclusion Individual variabilities in a child's sleep are associated with familial resources, such as caregiver's time to self, money and basic needs. Time spent in bed, a modifiable factor by society and shaper of sleep quantity and quality, plays a key role in stressor-sleep associations. Insights from biopsychosocial perspectives may be valuable for understanding COVID-19 sleep studies, and the development of (post-)COVID-19 sleep recommendations.","Alaribe, Calista U.; Nwabara, Odochi U.; Spruyt, Karen",,74,1

In the present days, the development of mathematical models to simulate the dynamic behavior of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is considered an important theme due to the quantity of infected people worldwide. In this work, the objective is to determine an optimal control strategy for vaccine administration in COVID-19 pandemic treatment considering real data from China. Two optimal control problems (mono- and multi-objective) to determine a strategy for vaccine administration in COVID-19 pandemic treatment are proposed. The first consists of minimizing the quantity of infected individuals during the treatment. The second considers minimizing together the quantity of infected individuals and the prescribed vaccine concentration during the treatment. Methods: An inverse problem is formulated and solved in order to determine the parameters of the compartmental Susceptible-Infectious-Removed model. The solutions for both optimal control problems proposed are obtained by using Differential Evolution and Multi-objective Optimization Differential Evolution algorithms. Results: A comparative analysis on the influence related to the inclusion of a control strategy in the population subject to the epidemic is carried out, in terms of the compartmental model and its control parameters. The results regarding the proposed optimal control problems provide information from which an optimal strategy for vaccine administration can be defined. Conclusions: The solution of the optimal control problem can provide information about the effect of vaccination of a population in the face of an epidemic, as well as essential elements for decision making in the economic and governmental spheres.","Libotte, Gustavo Barbosa; Lobato, Fran Sérgio; Platt, Gustavo Mendes; Silva Neto, Antônio J.",Comput Methods Programs Biomed,74,1

We performed an observational clinical study aimed to identify the safety and immunogenicity of influenza vaccine in cured leprosy patients. A total of 65 participants from a leprosarium were recruited into leprosy cured group or control group, and received a 0.5 ml dose of the inactivated split-virion trivalent influenza vaccine and a follow-up 28 days proactive observation of any adverse events. Hemagglutination and hemagglutination inhibition test was performed to evaluate serum antibody titer, flow cytometry was conducted to screen of cytokines level. The total rate of reactogenicity was 0.0% [0/41] in leprosy cured group and 37.5% [9/24] in control group. The seroconversion rate for H1N1 was difference between leprosy cured group and control group (41.83% vs 79.17%, P = .0082), but not for H3N2 (34.25% vs 50.00%, P = .4468). At day 0, leprosy cured group have relatively high concentration of interleukin-6, interleukin-10, tumor necrosis factor, interferon-γ, and interleukin-17 compared to control group. The interleukin-2 concentration increased 2 weeks after vaccination compared to pre-vaccination in leprosy cured group, but declined in control group (0.92 pg/ml vs −0.02 pg/ml, P = .0147). Leprosy cured group showed a more rapid down-regulation of interleukin-6 when influenza virus was challenged compared to control group (−144.38 pg/ml vs −11.52 pg/ml, P < .0001). Subgroup analysis revealed that the immunization administration declined interleukin-17 concentration in Tuberculoid type subgroup, but not in Lepromatous type subgroup or control group.

The green tea component epigallocatechin 3 gallate (EGCG) is particularly promising because it reportedly inhibits viral replication and viral entry in vitro. However, conclusive evidence for its predominant activity is needed. We tested EGCG effects on the native virus isolated from COVID-19 patients in two independent series of experiments using VERO cells and two different treatment schemes in each series. The results confirmed modest cytotoxicity of EGCG and its substantial antiviral activity. The preincubation scheme aimed at infection prevention has proven particularly beneficial. We complemented that finding with a detailed investigation of EGCG interactions with viral S-protein subunits, including S2, RBD, and the RBD mutant harboring the N501Y mutation. Molecular modeling experiments revealed N501Y-specific stacking interactions in the RBD-ACE2 complex and provided insight into EGCG interference with the complex formation. Together, these findings provide a molecular basis for the observed EGCG effects and reinforce its prospects in COVID-19 prevention therapy.","Tsvetkov, Vladimir; Varizhuk, Anna; Kozlovskaya, Liubov; Shtro, Anna; Lebedeva, Olga; Komissarov, Andrey; Vedekhina, Tatjana; Manuvera, Valentin; Zubkova, Olga; Eremeev, Artem; Shustova, Elena; Pozmogova, Galina; Lioznov, Dmitry; Ismukhametov, Aydar; Lazarev, Vassili; Lagarkova, Maria",Biochimie,74,23

Additionally, research on the public attention to COVID-19 as reflected through frames on social media is scarce. OBJECTIVE: This study identified the frames about the COVID-19 pandemic in the public discourse on Twitter, which voices diverse opinions. This study also investigated the amount of public attention to those frames on Twitter. METHODS: We collected 22 trending hashtags related to COVID-19 in the United States and 694,582 tweets written in English containing these hashtags in March 2020 and analyzed them via thematic analysis. Public attention to these frames was measured by evaluating the amount of public engagement with frames and public adoption of those frames. RESULTS: We identified 9 frames including “public health guidelines,” “quarantine life,” “solidarity,” “evidence and facts,” “call for action,” “politics,” “post-pandemic life,” “shortage panic,” and “conflict.” Results showed that some frames such as “call for action” are more appealing than others during a global pandemic, receiving greater public adoption and engagement. The “call for action” frame had the highest engagement score, followed by “conflict” and “evidence and facts.” Additionally, “post-pandemic life” had the highest adoption score, followed by “call for action” and “shortage panic.” The findings indicated that the frequency of a frame on social media does not necessarily mean greater public adoption of or engagement with the frame. CONCLUSIONS: This study contributes to framing theory and research by demonstrating how trending hashtags can be used as new user-generated data to identify frames on social media. This study concludes that the identified frames such as “quarantine life” and “conflict” and themes such as “isolation” and “toilet paper panic” represent the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. The consequences could be (1) exclusively related to COVID-19, such as hand hygiene or isolation; (2) related to any health crisis such as social support of vulnerable groups; and (3) generic that are irrespective of COVID-19, such as homeschooling or remote working.","Tahamtan, Iman; Potnis, Devendra; Mohammadi, Ehsan; Miller, Laura E; Singh, Vandana",J Med Internet Res,74,1

DESIGN A cross-sectional, open, online electronic survey from May 9, 2020, to June 14, 2020. SETTING Electronic survey open internationally and advertised through Canadian-based social media platforms. PARTICIPANTS Eligible participants understood English and had been pregnant during the COVID-19 pandemic (ie, were pregnant at the time of survey completion or had delivered an infant on or after March 11, 2020). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Potential sources of concern related to the pandemic, calculated as the proportion of participants who endorsed each concern among those for whom the concern was relevant. Differences in the proportion of individuals endorsing each concern were compared by parity using modified Poisson regression. Frequency of concerns was examined in terms of level of distress, as per the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K6), using multivariable linear regression. RESULTS Out of 1477 participants, 87.3% were Canadian. Top concerns included the following: hospital policies related to support persons during labour (80.9%), not being able to introduce the baby to family and friends (80.1%), and developing COVID-19 while pregnant (79.2%). Primiparous participants were more likely than multiparous participants to be concerned about accessing in-person prenatal classes (51.5% vs 13.3%; relative risk = 3.88; 95% CI 2.02 to 4.98) and cancellation of hospital tours (35.0% vs 5.6%, relative risk = 6.26; 95% CI 4.25 to 9.20), among other concerns. The mean (SD) K6 score was 6.7 (3.8) within the moderate to high distress range. Number of concerns reported was associated with K6 score in both primiparous (β = 0.24; 95% CI 0.20 to 0.29; P < .0001) and multiparous (β = 0.30; 95% CI 0.24 to 0.36; P < .0001) individuals. CONCLUSION Pregnant individuals have unique concerns during the COVID-19 pandemic and the findings indicate the importance of targeted support strategies to meet the particular needs of both primiparous and multiparous pregnant individuals.","Bogler, Tali; Hussain-Shamsy, Neesha; Schuler, Andrée; Pirmohamed, Jenna; Shore, Eliane M; Wijayasinghe, Sheila; Dennis, Cindy-Lee; Vigod, Simone N; Barker, Lucy C",Canadian family physician Medecin de famille canadien,74,24
657008,657008,657008,Sequence analysis of the 3′-end of feline calicivirus genome,9.925944,6.7573,1991-08-31,"Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) belongs to the recently recognized Arteriviridae family within the genus Arterivirus, order Nidovirales, which also includes equine arteritis virus (EAV), lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus (LDV), and simian hemorrhagic fever virus (SHFV). Mature viral particles are composed of an envelope 50–72 nm in diameter, with an isometric core about 20–30 nm enclosing a linear positive-stranded RNA genome of approximately 15 kb. The virions are assembled by the budding of preformed nucleocapsids into the lumen of the smooth endoplasmic reticulum and/or Golgi apparatus. The mature virions are then released by exocytosis. The viral genome contains eight open reading frames (ORFs) which are transcribed in cells as a nested set of subgenomic mRNAs. The ORF1a and ORF1b situated at the 5′end of the genome represent nearly 75% of the viral genome and code for proteins with apparent replicase and polymerase activities. The major structural proteins consist of a 25 kDa envelope glycoprotein (GP(5)), an 18–19 kDa unglycosylated membrane protein (M), and a 15 kDa nucleocapsid (N) protein, encoded by ORFs 5, 6 and 7, respectively. The N protein is the more abundant protein of the virion and is highly antigenic, which therefore makes it a suitable candidate for the detection of virus-specific antibodies and diagnosis of the disease. Four to five domains of antigenic importance have been identified for the N protein, a common conformational antigenic site for European and North American strains being localized in the central region of the protein. In cells and virions, both M and GP(5) occur in heterodimeric complexes linked by disulfide bonds. The expression products of ORFs 2 and 4 are also incorporated into virus particles as additional minor membrane-associated glycoproteins designated as GP(2) and GP(4), with M(r) of 29 and 31 kDa, respectively. The structural nature of the ORF3 product, a highly glycosylated protein with an apparent M(r) of 42 kDa, is still being debated, in view of the apparently conflicting data on its presence in virus particles. Nonetheless, the GP(3) of North American and European strains has been shown to be antigenic, providing protection for piglets against PRRSV infection in the absence of a noticeable neutralizing humoral response. Pigs exposed to the native form of GP(5) by means of DNA immunization develop specific neutralizing and protecting antibodies. The GP(5) is involved in antigenic variability, apoptosis, and possibly antibody-dependent enhancement phenomena. The GP(4) also possesses antigenic determinants that trigger the immune system to produce neutralizing antibodies. Each of the PRRSV structural proteins carries common and type-specific antigenic determinants that permit the ability to differentiate between European and North American strains. The potential use of the PRRSV structural proteins in subunit recombinant-type vaccines is also discussed.","Dea, S.; Gagnon, C. A.; Mardassi, H.; Pirzadeh, B.; Rogan, D.",Arch Virol,74,16

AIMS: In this multicentre study, we compared the psychological outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic in various countries in the Asia-Pacific region and identified factors associated with adverse psychological outcomes. METHOD: From 29 April to 4 June 2020, the study recruited healthcare workers from major healthcare institutions in five countries in the Asia-Pacific region. A self-administrated survey that collected information on prior medical conditions, presence of symptoms, and scores on the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales and the Impact of Events Scale-Revised were used. The prevalence of depression, anxiety, stress and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) relating to COVID-19 was compared, and multivariable logistic regression identified independent factors associated with adverse psychological outcomes within each country. RESULTS: A total of 1146 participants from India, Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia and Vietnam were studied. Despite having the lowest volume of cases, Vietnam displayed the highest prevalence of PTSD. In contrast, Singapore reported the highest case volume, but had a lower prevalence of depression and anxiety. In the multivariable analysis, we found that non-medically trained personnel, the presence of physical symptoms and presence of prior medical conditions were independent predictors across the participating countries. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights that the varied prevalence of psychological adversity among healthcare workers is independent of the burden of COVID-19 cases within each country. Early psychological interventions may be beneficial for the vulnerable groups of healthcare workers with presence of physical symptoms, prior medical conditions and those who are not medically trained.","Chew, Nicholas W.

MMP-2 and MMP-9 levels in plasma from patients with COVID-19 treated in the ICU (COVID-19 group) and Control patients were measured with the zymography. The study groups were matched for age, sex, hypertension, diabetes, BMI, and obesity profile. MMP-2 levels were lower and MMP-9 levels were higher in a COVID-19 group (p<0.0001) compared to Controls. MMP-9 levels in COVID-19 patients were not affected by comorbidity such as hypertension or obesity. MMP-2 levels were affected by hypertension (p<0.05), but unaffected by obesity status.

In particular, hydroxychloroquine was once widely used as a treatment for the new coronavirus pneumonia epidemic in 2020. Retinopathy caused by hydroxychloroquine is normally irreversible, but little attention has been paid to it. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 38-year-old young Chinese woman was taking oral hydroxychloroquine 400 mg daily to control lupus disease activity for six years after the diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). She did not have any history of eye disease and was admitted to the hospital with a sudden blurring of both eyes. DIAGNOSES: The diagnosis of retinal macular degeneration caused by hydroxychloroquine was made after excluding other interfering diseases based on the patient's long-term use of hydroxychloroquine and the results of the eye examination. INTERVENTIONS: The patient was discontinued from hydroxychloroquine. To control the recurrence of SLE, she was given intravenous methylprednisolone, oral tacrolimus and mycophenolate. Meanwhile, she was asked to take extra care of her eyes and to come to the hospital every three months to have her vision checked. OUTCOMES: The patient's blurred vision improved one week later. Three months later, her vision examination showed no further decline (0.4 in the right eye and 0.6 in the left eye). Meanwhile, the SLE disease activity index (SLEDAI) decreased from six points to five points currently. LESSONS: Retinopathy caused by hydroxychloroquine is irreversible and there is no particularly effective treatment. Discontinuation of hydroxychloroquine, better daily eye protection, and regular vision checks are the keys to preventing retinopathy. Although hydroxychloroquine causing retinal toxicity was mentioned several years ago, the rate and severity of retinal toxicity require further research. How to get more patients to take care of their eyes requires continuous and increased education by doctors.","Wang, Gang; Zhuo, Ning; Liao, Zheng; Qi, Wei; Tian, Feng; Wen, Zhenhua; Li, Jingyang",Medicine (Baltimore),74,16

This study aims to compare the public reactions towards the COVID-19 pandemic between the United Kingdom and the United States from March 6, 2020 to April 2, 2020. Data: The numbers of confirmed COVID-19 cases in the United Kingdom and the United States were obtained from the 1Point3Acres website. Twitter data were collected using COVID-19 related keywords from March 6, 2020 to April 2, 2020. Methods: Temporal analyses were performed on COVID-19 related Twitter posts (tweets) during the study period to show daily trends and hourly trends. The sentiment scores of the tweets on COVID-19 were analyzed and associated with the policy announcements and the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases. Topic modeling was conducted to identify related topics discussed with COVID-19 in the United Kingdom and the United States. Results: The number of daily new confirmed COVID-19 cases in the United Kingdom was significantly lower than that in the United States during our study period. There were 3,556,442 COVID-19 tweets in the United Kingdom and 16,280,065 tweets in the United States during the study period. The number of COVID-19 tweets per 10,000 Twitter users in the United Kingdom was lower than that in the United States. The sentiment scores of COVID-19 tweets in the United Kingdom were less negative than those in the United States. The topics discussed in COVID-19 tweets in the United Kingdom were mostly about the gratitude to government and health workers, while the topics in the United States were mostly about the global COVID-19 pandemic situation.

Furthermore, many cases of multiorgan failure are thrombotic in nature. Since the outbreak of COVID-19, D-dimer testing has been used extensively to evaluate COVID-19-associated thrombosis, but does not provide a complete view of the disease because it probes blood coagulation, but not platelet activity. Due to this limitation, D-dimer testing fails to account for thrombotic events which occur despite low D-dimer levels, such as sudden stroke in young patients and autopsy-identified widespread microthrombi in multiple organs. Here we report the landscape of circulating platelet aggregates in COVID-19 obtained by large-scale single-cell image-based profiling and temporal monitoring of the blood of COVID-19 patients (n = 110). Surprisingly, our analysis shows the anomalous presence of excessive platelet aggregates in nearly 90% of all COVID-19 patients, including those who were not clinically diagnosed with thrombosis and those with low D-dimer levels (less than 1 ug/mL). Additionally, results indicate a strong link between the concentration of platelet aggregates and the severity and mortality of COVID-19. Finally, high-dimensional analysis and comparison with other diseases reveal that COVID-19 behaves as a product of thrombosis (localized) and infectious diseases (systemic), as a cause of systemic thrombosis.","Zhou, Y.; Nishikawa, M.; Kanno, H.; Xiao, T.; Suzuki, T.; Ibayashi, Y.; Harmon, J.; Takizawa, S.; Hiramatsu, K.; Nitta, N.; Kameyama, R.; Peterson, W.; Takiguchi, J.; Shifat-E-Rabbi, M.; Zhuang, Y.; Yin, X.; Rubaiyat, A.; Deng, Y.; Zhang, H.; Rhode, G.; Iwasaki, W.; Yatomi, Y.; Goda, K.",,74,11

This paper focused on extracting nanocellulose from sugarcane bagasse and coir (cocos nucifera) using chemical methods including mercerisation, bleaching and acid hydrolysis. Taguchi Design of Experiment showed that the optimum alkaline treatment conditions of bagasse were at 2 wt% NaOH at 90 °C for 16 h. The morphological changes occurring along each treatment stage were observed using Fourier-Transform Infrared spectroscopy and Scanning Electron Microscopy. The differences in the nanoparticles extracted from the two biomass were studied through the determination of crystallinity indexes and particle size. Cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) from coir exhibited a total crystallinity index (TCI) of 1.03 and an average particle size of 137.3 nm while CNCs extracted from sugarcane bagasse under similar treatment conditions had a TCI of 0.85 and an average particle size of around 48 µm. Dynamic Light Scattering findings showed risks of agglomeration after freeze drying. Bio-nanocomposite films with polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) as matrix were manufactured by the solvent casting process. The highest tensile strength (38.2 MPa) was obtained for CNCs extracted from coir at a CNC/PVA loading of 0.5 wt%, representing a 96.9% increase in the tensile strength as compared to the unreinforced PVA matrix.

Adaptor protein complexes (AP), which mediate protein sorting in endocytic and secretory transport pathways, are one of the conserved viral targets with many viruses possessing AP-interacting motifs. We present here different mechanisms of viral interference with AP complexes and the functional consequences that allow for efficient viral propagation and evasion of host immune defense. The ubiquity of this phenomenon is evidenced by the fact that there are representatives for AP interference in all major viral families, covered in this review. The best described examples are interactions of human immunodeficiency virus and human herpesviruses with AP complexes. Several other viruses, like Ebola, Nipah, and SARS-CoV-2, are pointed out as high priority disease-causative agents supporting the need for deeper understanding of virus-AP interplay which can be exploited in the design of novel antiviral therapies.","Strazic Geljic, Ivana; Kucan Brlic, Paola; Musak, Lucija; Karner, Dubravka; Ambriović-Ristov, Andreja; Jonjic, Stipan; Schu, Peter; Rovis, Tihana Lenac",Int J Mol Sci,74,16

These actions forced many physicians to adopt new techniques, such as telemedicine, to continue patient care, which has proven to be useful in continued care for those with non-COVID-19 pathologies. Various factors, such as security, confidentiality, cost-effectiveness, comfort, and the risk of malpractice, influence the perception of telemedicine among medical practitioners. The aim of this study was to adapt an existing instrument and validate it into a new Spanish version. The instrument is about the perceptions and knowledge of telemedicine in healthcare professionals. METHODS: The original questionnaire surveyed 6 domains with 40 questions, and each question was measured with a five-point Likert scale ranging from very high [5] to very low [1]. The survey was translated to Spanish using machine translation. The translation was reviewed independently, and then, a consensus was achieved regarding minor changes in the syntax of the survey to facilitate understanding. After expert feedback and questionnaire review, the research team members proposed reducing the instrument to 13 items in 4 domains due to the similarity of some questions. The sample was divided into 2randomly selected groups. Eligibility criteria included physicians providing private or public services with active medical/clinical practice. RESULTS: In total, 382 surveys were collected and separated into two random samples, S1 and S2 (198 and 184, respectively). In exploratory factor analysis (EFA), the 13 items were grouped into four theoretical domains, and item 7 presented cross loading between factors and was removed. Confirmatory factor analysis was performed to assess the scale reliability and interscale associations; three models were tested. Global Cronbach’s alpha for internal consistency was 0.76 for the EFA. The goodness of fit measures root mean square error of approximation and comparative fit index were 0.009 and 0.999, respectively, for the best model. CONCLUSIONS: The translated instrument was clear, with adequate internal consistency, readability, and appropriate for application in the physician setting. This validated questionnaire made it possible to evaluate physicians’ knowledge of telemedicine to increase its use, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Persons living with diagnosed HIV may be more prone to COVID-19 infection and severe outcomes, yet few studies have assessed this possibility at a population level. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between HIV diagnosis and COVID-19 diagnosis, hospitalization, and in-hospital death in New York State. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study, conducted in New York State, including New York City, between March 1 and June 15, 2020, matched data from HIV surveillance, COVID-19 laboratory-confirmed diagnoses, and hospitalization databases to provide a full population-level comparison of COVID-19 outcomes between persons living with diagnosed HIV and persons living without diagnosed HIV. EXPOSURES: Diagnosis of HIV infection through December 31, 2019. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The main outcomes were COVID-19 diagnosis, hospitalization, and in-hospital death. COVID-19 diagnoses, hospitalizations, and in-hospital death rates comparing persons living with diagnosed HIV with persons living without dianosed HIV were computed, with unadjusted rate ratios and indirect standardized rate ratios (sRR), adjusting for sex, age, and region. Adjusted rate ratios (aRRs) for outcomes specific to persons living with diagnosed HIV were assessed by age, sex, region, race/ethnicity, transmission risk, and CD4(+) T-cell count–defined HIV disease stage, using Poisson regression models. RESULTS: A total of 2988 persons living with diagnosed HIV (2109 men [70.6%]; 2409 living in New York City [80.6%]; mean [SD] age, 54.0 [13.3] years) received a diagnosis of COVID-19. Of these persons living with diagnosed HIV, 896 were hospitalized and 207 died in the hospital through June 15, 2020. After standardization, persons living with diagnosed HIV and persons living without diagnosed HIV had similar diagnosis rates (sRR, 0.94 [95% CI, 0.91-0.97]), but persons living with diagnosed HIV were hospitalized more than persons living without diagnosed HIV, per population (sRR, 1.38 [95% CI, 1.29-1.47]) and among those diagnosed (sRR, 1.47 [95% CI, 1.37-1.56]). Elevated mortality among persons living with diagnosed HIV was observed per population (sRR, 1.23 [95% CI, 1.07-1.40]) and among those diagnosed (sRR, 1.30 [95% CI, 1.13-1.48]) but not among those hospitalized (sRR, 0.96 [95% CI, 0.83-1.09]). Among persons living with diagnosed HIV, non-Hispanic Black individuals (aRR, 1.59 [95% CI, 1.40-1.81]) and Hispanic individuals (aRR, 2.08 [95% CI, 1.83-2.37]) were more likely to receive a diagnosis of COVID-19 than White individuals, but they were not more likely to be hospitalized once they received a diagnosis or to die once hospitalized. Hospitalization risk increased with disease progression to HIV stage 2 (aRR, 1.29 [95% CI, 1.11-1.49]) and stage 3 (aRR, 1.69 [95% CI, 1.38-2.07]) relative to stage 1. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort study, persons living with diagnosed HIV experienced poorer COVID-related outcomes relative to persons living without diagnosed HIV; Previous HIV diagnosis was associated with higher rates of severe disease requiring hospitalization, and hospitalization risk increased with progression of HIV disease stage.","Tesoriero, James M.; Swain, Carol-Ann E.; Pierce, Jennifer L.; Zamboni, Lucila; Wu, Meng; Holtgrave, David R.; Gonzalez, Charles J.; Udo, Tomoko; Morne, Johanne E.; Hart-Malloy, Rachel; Rajulu, Deepa T.; Leung, Shu-Yin John; Rosenberg, Eli S.",JAMA Netw Open,74,5

Although the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended face mask use by the general public, there is a lack of evidence on the effect of face mask policies on the spread of COVID-19 at the state level. OBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of the Executive Order on face mask use on COVID-19 cases and mortality in NY. DESIGN: A comparative interrupted time series analysis was used to assess the impact of the Executive Order in NY with Massachusetts (MA) as a comparison state. PARTICIPANTS: We analyzed data on COVID-19 in NY and MA from March 25 to May 6, 2020. INTERVENTION: The Executive Order on face mask use in NY. MAIN MEASURES: Daily numbers of COVID-19 confirmed cases and deaths. KEY RESULTS: The average daily number of confirmed cases in NY decreased from 8549 to 5085 after the Executive Order took effect, with a trend change of 341 (95% CI, 187–496) cases per day. The average daily number of deaths decreased from 521 to 384 during the same two time periods, with a trend change of 52 (95% CI, 44–60) deaths per day. Compared to MA, the decreasing trend in NY was significantly greater for both daily numbers of confirmed cases (P = 0.003) and deaths (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The Executive Order on face mask use in NY led to a significant decrease in both daily numbers of COVID-19 confirmed cases and deaths. Findings from this study provide important evidence to support state-level policies that require face mask use by the general public.

The epidemiology, clinical, and zoonotic impacts of these species are however largely unknown. The study aimed to investigate the presence of Chlamydia spp. in the intestines of growing pigs and in conjunctival swabs from finisher pigs, and relate the findings to clinical signs. RESULTS: By histology, 20 of 48 pigs had intestinal lesions that may be consistent with chlamydial infection. By PCR, forty-six of the pigs were positive whereas two samples were inhibited. Sequencing of 19 DNA extracts identified these as Chlamydia suis. By immunohistochemistry, 32 of 44 samples were positive and a significant relationship was detected between macroscopically visible intestinal lesions and a high degree of infection. By real-time PCR, a significant difference was detected between pigs with and without conjunctivitis when a Ct value of 36 was employed but not when a Ct value of 38 was employed. CONCLUSIONS: Chlamydia suis was demonstrated in most samples and overall, no correlation to clinical signs was detected. However, a correlation was noted between samples with a high degree of infection and the presence of clinical signs. It is possible, that the intensive pig production systems studied might predispose for the transmission and maintenance of the infection thus increasing the infectious load and the risk for disease in the pig.","Englund, Stina; Hård af Segerstad, Carl; Arnlund, Frida; Westergren, Eva; Jacobson, Magdalena",BMC Vet Res,74,16

Many providers transitioned from seeing their patients in person to virtually using telemedicine platforms with limited training and experience using this medium. In pediatric rheumatology, this was further complicated as musculoskeletal exams typically require hands-on assessment of patients. The objective of this study was to examine the adoption of telemedicine into pediatric rheumatology practices, to assess its benefits and challenges, and to gather opinions on its continued use. A survey was sent to the lead representatives of each Pediatric Rheumatology Care and Outcomes Improvement Network (PR-COIN) site to collect data about their center's experience with telemedicine during the COVID-19 pandemic. Quantitative data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, and qualitative data were thematically analyzed. Responses were received from the majority [19/21 (90%)] of PR-COIN sites. All respondents reported transitioning from in-person to primarily virtual patient visits during the COVID-19 pandemic. All centers reported seeing both new consultations and follow-up patients over telemedicine. Most centers reported using both audio and video conferencing systems to conduct their telemedicine visits. The majority of respondents [13/19 (68%)] indicated that at least 50% of their site's providers consistently used pediatric Gait Arms Legs and Spine (pGALS) to perform active joint count assessments over telemedicine. Over half of the centers [11/19 (58%)] reported collecting patient-reported outcomes (PROs), but the rate of reliably documenting clinical components varied. A few sites [7/19 (37%)] reported performing research-related activity during telemedicine visits. All centers thought that telemedicine visits were able to meet providers' needs and support their continued use when the pandemic ends. Benefits reported with telemedicine visits included convenience and continuity of care for families. Conversely, challenges included limited ability to perform physical exams and varying access to technology. Pediatric rheumatology providers were able to transition to conducting virtual visits during the COVID-19 pandemic. Healthcare providers recognize how telemedicine can enhance their practice, but challenges need to be overcome in order to ensure equitable, sustainable delivery of quality and patient-centered care.","Goh, Y.

For example, cells of immune system express various pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that detect danger via recognizing specific pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and mount a specific immune response. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are one of these PRRs expressed by various immune cells. However, they were first discovered in the Drosophila melanogaster (common fruit fly) as genes/proteins important in embryonic development and dorso-ventral body patterning/polarity. Till date, 13 different types of TLRs (TLR1-TLR13) have been discovered and described in mammals since the first discovery of TLR4 in humans in late 1997. This discovery of TLR4 in humans revolutionized the field of innate immunity and thus the immunology and host-pathogen interaction. Since then TLRs are found to be expressed on various immune cells and have been targeted for therapeutic drug development for various infectious and inflammatory diseases including cancer. Even, Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) among various TLR genes have been identified among the different human population and their association with susceptibility/resistance to certain infections and other inflammatory diseases. Thus, in the present review the current and future importance of TLRs in immunity, their pattern of expression among various immune cells along with TLR based therapeutic approach is reviewed.","Vijay, Kumar",Int Immunopharmacol,74,1

To cope with the epidemic disaster, most provinces and cities in China have adopted prevention and control measures such as home isolation, blocking transportation, and extending the Spring Festival holiday, which has caused a serious impact on China's output of various sectors, international trade, and labor employment, ultimately generating great losses to the Chinese economic system in 2020. But how big is the loss? How can we assess this for a country? At present, there are few analyses based on quantitative models to answer these important questions. In the following, we describe a quantitative-based approach of assessing the potential impact of the COVID-19 epidemic on the economic system and the sectors taking China as the base case. The proposed approach can provide timely data and quantitative tools to support the complex decision-making process that government agencies (and the private sector) need to manage to respond to this tragic epidemic and maintain stable economic development. Based on the available data, this article proposes a hypothetical scenario and then adopts the Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model to calculate the comprehensive economic losses of the epidemic from the aspects of the direct shock on the output of seriously affected sectors, international trade, and labor force. The empirical results show that assuming a GDP growth rate of 4-8% in the absence of COVID-19, GDP growth in 2020 would be -8.77 to -12.77% after the COVID-19. Companies and activities associated with transportation and service sectors are among the most impacted, and companies and supply chains related to the manufacturing subsector lead the economic losses. Finally, according to the calculation results, the corresponding countermeasures and suggestions are put forward: disaster recovery for key sectors such as the labor force, transportation sector, and service sectors should be enhanced; disaster emergency rescue work in highly sensitive sectors should be carried out; in the long run, precise measures to strengthen the refined management of disaster risk with big data resources and means should be taken.","Tan, Ling; Wu, Xianhua; Guo, Ji; Santibanez-Gonzalez, Ernesto D R",Risk anal,74,9

These non-canonical caps include metabolic cofactors, such as NAD(+)/NADH, FAD, cell wall precursors UDP-GlcNAc, alarmones, e.g. dinucleotides polyphosphates, ADP-ribose and potentially other nucleoside derivatives. They are installed at the 5′ position of RNA via template-dependent incorporation of nucleotide analogues as an initiation substrate by RNA polymerases. However, the discovery of NAD-capped processed RNAs in human cells suggests the existence of alternative post-transcriptional NC capping pathways. In this review, we compiled growing evidence for a number of these other mechanisms which produce various non-canonically capped RNAs and a growing repertoire of capping small molecules. Enzymes shown to be involved are ADP-ribose polymerases, glycohydrolases and tRNA synthetases, and may potentially include RNA 3′-phosphate cyclases, tRNA guanylyl transferases, RNA ligases and ribozymes.

RESULTS: Of the 204 responses (125/481 in phase 1 and 79/320 in phase 2), 183 responses were included. Respondents from first-responder hospitals were more willing to manage non-intubated hypoxemic patients in neutral pressure rooms, while respondents from private hospitals preferred negative-pressure rooms (p < 0.001). In both the phases, private hospital doctors were less comfortable to use any form of noninvasive oxygen therapies in neutral-pressure rooms compared to first-responder hospitals (low-flow oxygen therapy: 72 vs 50%, p < 0.01; HFNO: 47 vs 24%, p < 0.01 and NPPV: 38 vs 28%, p = 0.20). INTERPRETATION: Variations existed in practices among first-responder and private intensivists/anesthetists. The resource optimal private hospital intensivists/anesthetists were less comfortable using noninvasive oxygen therapies in managing COVID-19 patients. This may reflect differential resource availability necessitating resolution at national, state, and local levels. HOW TO CITE THIS ARTICLE: Subramaniam A, Haji JY, Kumar P, Ramanathan K, Rajamani A.

Using a lens of biopower, this article considers what sort of biopolitical subjectivities were produced in and through New Zealand crowdfunding campaigns during the 2020 COVID-19 lockdown. It focuses on a discursive and dialogical analysis of 59 online medical crowdfunding campaigns that were active during lockdown and chose to mention the pandemic. These pages pointed to interrelated biological, social and economic precarities, speaking to questions about how citizens navigate uneven needs during uncertain times. Findings showed that crowdfunders referred to the pandemic in order to narrate their own situation in culturally coherent ways and to establish context-specific relations of care. This included contextualising their needs through establishing shared crisis narratives that also made the infrastructural contexts of healthcare visible and performing relational labour in ways that aligned with nationally specific affective regimes. By highlighting their own vulnerability, crowdfunders strategically mobilised broader lockdown discourses of self-sacrifice on behalf of vulnerable people. In this way, New Zealand’s lockdown produced subjectivities both drawing on wider neoliberal moral regimes and specific to the nuanced and emergent moral systems of pandemic citizenship.","Wardell, Susan",Biosocieties,74,26

Nous décrivons ici leur évolution. Matériels et méthodes Les données cliniques, virologiques et radiologiques des patients ont été recueillies. La recherche de COVID-19 a été réalisée sur prélèvement nasopharyngé (NP), sérique, urinaire et fécal par RT-PCR semi-quantitative au diagnostic puis régulièrement au cours du suivi. La guérison, clinico-virologique, était définie par une disparition des symptômes et une négativation des RT-PCR sur 2 prélèvements NP à 48heures d’intervalle. Résultats Parmi les 4 patients confirmés, 3 présentations cliniques différentes ont été identifiées : – un cas de défaillance respiratoire à j10 d’évolution : un homme de 31 ans présentant initialement une toux fébrile. La charge virale (CV) SARS-CoV-2 sur le premier écouvillon NP était modérée (26,5 Cycle Threshold [CT]). La radiographie de thorax montrait un syndrome interstitiel bilatéral. À j10, le patient a présenté une détresse respiratoire aiguë avec nécessité d’oxygénothérapie haut débit et surveillance en réanimation. Le scanner thoracique montrait des plages de verre dépoli bilatérales et des opacités alvéolaires. Un traitement par remdesivir a été introduit, arrêté précocement à j5 en raison d’une cytolyse hépatique et d’une éruption cutanée non grave. L’évolution, clinique et virologique, a été favorable avec négativation de la RT-PCR sur prélèvement NP à partir de j11 ; – deux cas de pneumonies non compliquées : 2 femmes de 30 et 46 ans, diagnostiquées à j2, devant une toux et une fièvre modérée. Les radiographies de thorax étaient normales. Les scanners thoraciques réalisés de manière systématique montraient respectivement une condensation alvéolaire et des plages de verre dépoli. Au diagnostic, les CV sur écouvillon NP étaient élevées, 22 et 18,5 CT respectivement. Pour les 2 patientes, les selles étaient positives à SARS-CoV-2. L’évolution a été rapidement favorable avec disparition des symptômes et négativation des RT-PCR sur prélèvement NP à j9 pour l’une et en cours pour l’autre ; – un cas de SDRA : un homme de 80 ans, sans comorbidité majeure, avec pneumonie bilatérale sévère d’emblée compliquée d’une surinfection précoce à Acinetobacter baumannii et Aspergillus flavus. Au diagnostic, la CV sur écouvillon NP était modérée à 29,5 CT. Le SARS-CoV-2 a également été retrouvé en faible quantité dans le sang (36,9 CT) et dans la plèvre (37,3 CT). Un traitement par remdesivir a été introduit. L’évolution du patient a été défavorable avec décès à j24 en défaillance multiviscérale. Conclusion Trois profils cliniques de gravité variable d’infection COVID-19 ont été identifiés, de la pneumonie paucisymptomatique au SDRA. Au 16/02/20, 2 patients étaient guéris et sortis d’hospitalisation, 1 patiente était devenue asymptomatique et en cours de guérison virologique et 1 patient était décédé des suites de complications. Des investigations complémentaires restent nécessaires pour mieux connaître cette infection émergente.","Parisey, M.; Le Pluart, D.; Deconinck, L.; Bouadma, L.; Patrier, J.; Houhou-Fidouh, N.; Descamps, D.; Lescure, F.; Yazdanpanah, Y.",Médecine et Maladies Infectieuses,74,1

The severity of COVID-19 pathophysiology is greatly depended on several comorbidities, like hypertension, diabetes mellitus (DM), respiratory and cardiovascular disease, out of which DM has emerged as a major risk factor. The current review focuses on the link among the expression of ACE2, use of ACE inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers (ARBs), and risk of COVID-19 pathogenesis in DM. The review also emphasizes on synergistic detrimental effect of DM and COVID-19 on the immune system in provoking uncontrolled cytokine storm which eventually leads to lethal consequences. Finally, several possible therapeutic strategies have been highlighted to reduce the excess of risk associated with COVID-19 in people with DM.","Sarkar, Sanjib; Das, Dibyendu; Borsingh Wann, Sawlang; Kalita, Jatin; Manna, Prasenjit",Diabetes Res Clin Pract,74,1

Virus discovery continues to expand the existing understating of virus classification, and the increased interest in bats globally as reservoirs or carriers of zoonotic agents has fuelled the continued detection and characterisation of new lyssaviruses and other viral zoonoses. Although the transmission of lyssaviruses from bat species to humans or terrestrial species appears rare, interest in these viruses remains, through their ability to cause the invariably fatal encephalitis—rabies. The association of bats with other viral zoonoses is also of great interest. Much of the EU is free of terrestrial rabies, but several bat species harbor lyssaviruses that remain a risk to human and animal health. Whilst the rabies virus is the main cause of rabies globally, novel related viruses continue to be discovered, predominantly in bat populations, that are of interest purely through their classification within the lyssavirus genus alongside the rabies virus. Although the rabies virus is principally transmitted from the bite of infected dogs, these related lyssaviruses are primarily transmitted to humans and terrestrial carnivores by bats. Even though reports of zoonotic viruses from bats within the EU are rare, to protect human and animal health, it is important characterise novel bat viruses for several reasons, namely: (i) to investigate the mechanisms for the maintenance, potential routes of transmission, and resulting clinical signs, if any, in their natural hosts; (ii) to investigate the ability of existing vaccines, where available, to protect against these viruses; (iii) to evaluate the potential for spill over and onward transmission of viral pathogens in novel terrestrial hosts. This review is an update on the current situation regarding zoonotic virus discovery within bats in the EU, and provides details of potential future mechanisms to control the threat from these deadly pathogens.","Shipley, Rebecca; Wright, Edward; Selden, David; Wu, Guanghui; Aegerter, James; Fooks, Anthony R; Banyard, Ashley C",Trop Med Infect Dis,74,28

Previous laboratory and field studies linking stress to physiological measures are limited by small samples, narrow demographics, and artificial stress manipulations, whereas large-scale studies often do not capture measures like BP reactivity in daily life. We examined perceived stress, emotions, heart rate, and BP during daily life using a 3-wk app-based study. We confirmed the validity of a smartphone-based optic sensor to measure BP and then analyzed data from more than 330,000 daily responses from over 20,000 people. Stress was conceptualized as the ratio of situational demands relative to individual resources to cope. We found that greater demands were associated with higher BP reactivity, but critically, the ratio of demands relative to resources improved prediction of BP changes. When demands were higher and resources were lower, there was higher BP reactivity. Additionally, older adults showed greater concordance between self-reported stress and physiologic responses than younger adults. We also observed that physiologic reactivity was associated with current emotional state, and both valence and arousal mattered. For example, BP increased with high-arousal negative emotions (e.g., anger) and decreased with low-arousal positive emotions (e.g., contentment). Taken together, this work underscores the potential for expanding stress science and public health data using handheld phones to reliably and validly measure physiologic responses linked to stress, emotion, and physical health.","Gordon, Amie M.; Mendes, Wendy Berry",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,74,24

Since the bottle neck step is the production of pressor Ang II, this was targeted pharmacologically in 1970s and successful ACE inhibitors such as captopril were produced to treat hypertension. Researches on domain specific ACE inhibitors are continuing to produce effective hypertension controlling drugs with fewer side effects. ACE2 was discovered in 2000; it converts Ang II into Ang(1–7), thereby reducing the concentration of Ang II as well as increasing that of Ang(1–7), an important enzyme for Ang(1–7)/Mas receptor signaling.

While RNA recombination is required during normal CoV replication, the mechanisms and determinants of CoV recombination are not known. CoVs encode an RNA proofreading exoribonuclease (nsp14-ExoN) that is distinct from the CoV polymerase and is responsible for high-fidelity RNA synthesis, resistance to nucleoside analogues, immune evasion, and virulence. Here, we demonstrate that CoVs, including SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, and the model CoV murine hepatitis virus (MHV), generate extensive and diverse recombination products during replication in culture. We show that the MHV nsp14-ExoN is required for native recombination, and that inactivation of ExoN results in decreased recombination frequency and altered recombination products. These results add yet another critical function to nsp14-ExoN, highlight the uniqueness of the evolved coronavirus replicase, and further emphasize nsp14-ExoN as a central, completely conserved, and vulnerable target for inhibitors and attenuation of SARS-CoV-2 and future emerging zoonotic CoVs.","Gribble, Jennifer; Stevens, Laura J.; Agostini, Maria L.; Anderson-Daniels, Jordan; Chappell, James D.; Lu, Xiaotao; Pruijssers, Andrea J.; Routh, Andrew L.; Denison, Mark R.",PLoS Pathog,74,16

The disease appears to be under control now; however, the possible return of SARS must be emphasized. Although many clinical experiments have been reported, the treatment of SARS is largely anecdotal, and so far no treatment consensus has been reached. We summarize 14 clinical reports and attempt to assess the effectiveness of various treatment regimens. A combination treatment of steroids and ribavirin was widely used empirically from the outset of the epidemic. In general, the use of steroids for SARS seemed beneficial, but the optimal timing, dosage, and duration of treatment have not yet been determined. On the other hand, ribavirin administration apparently reduced neither the rate of intratracheal intubation nor that of mortality. Moreover, significant toxicity, such as hemolytic anemia, has been attributed to ribavirin. A few preliminary trials and in vitro data suggest the possibility of treating SARS with interferon. Other agents, including the HIV protease inhibitor glycyrrhizin and convalescent plasma, remain to be evaluated.","Fujii, Takeshi; Iwamoto, Aikichi; Nakamura, Tetsuya",Journal of Infection and Chemotherapy,74,8

Yet the increase in living alone has been one of the most marked demographic trends of the post-apartheid period. The trend, which has occurred alongside the persistence in individual labor migration patterns and a decline in rates of union formation, has been driven by changes among working-age adults, rather than among older adults. This is the first empirical study to investigate the mental health implications of living alone among all adults in South Africa using national longitudinal data. The data come from five waves of the panel household survey, the National Income Dynamics Study (NIDS), conducted from 2008 to 2017. Information on depressive symptoms was collected from all adults (15 years and older), who were asked the ten questions which make up the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Short Depression Scale (CES-D 10). Adults who lived alone reported significantly higher depression scores than other adults, in the pooled ordinary least squares models, and in the fixed effects model, which controlled for any unobservable, time-invariant differences between the two groups of adults. Vulnerability to depression was moderated by adults’ preferences to continue living in their area of residence (as a measure of their social integration), but the positive relationship remained sizeable and significant across all models. The findings shed light on a further dimension of the migrant labor system in South Africa, which has not received adequate attention in the empirical literature, viz. the mental health implications for adults of solo migration, and they provide further motivation for the provision of affordable and safe family housing in local areas of employment.","Posel, Dorrit",SSM Popul Health,74,1

METHODS: ENSEMBLE PLUS is a randomized, double-blind substudy to the single-arm ENSEMBLE study (NCT03085810). In ENSEMBLE, patients with early stage relapsing-remitting MS received OCR 600 mg initially as two 300 mg IV infusions 2 weeks apart and subsequently as a single 3.5-hour 600 mg infusion every 24 weeks for 192 weeks. In ENSEMBLE PLUS, OCR 600 mg administered over the approved 3.5-hour infusion time (conventional duration) is compared with a 2-hour infusion (shorter duration). The primary end point was the proportion of patients with infusion-related reactions (IRRs) after the first randomized dose (assessed during and up to 24 hours postinfusion). RESULTS: From November 1, 2018, to September 27, 2019, 580 patients were randomized 1:1 to the conventional or shorter infusion group. After the first randomized dose, 67 of 291 patients (23.1%) in the conventional and 71 of 289 patients (24.6%) in the shorter infusion group experienced IRRs. Most IRRs were mild or moderate in both groups; one patient in each group experienced a severe IRR, and in both groups, 98.6% (136 of 138) of all IRRs resolved without sequelae. No IRRs were serious, life-threatening, or fatal. No IRR-related discontinuation occurred. During the first randomized dose, 14 of 291 (4.8%) and 25 of 289 (8.7%) patients in the conventional and shorter infusion groups, respectively, had IRRs leading to infusion slowing/interruption. CONCLUSION: The frequency and severity of IRRs were similar between conventional and shorter OCR infusions. Shortening the infusion time to 2 hours reduces the total infusion site stay time and lessens the overall patient and site staff burden. CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This interventional study provides Class I evidence that the frequency and severity of IRRs were similar at the first randomized dose using OCR (600 mg) infusions of conventional and shorter duration in patients with relapsing-remitting MS.

In particular, urbanisation trends and the increasing demands of urban mobility place additional pressure on existing transportation infrastructure, and this creates new challenges for urban planners in terms of developing integrated and sustainable urban mobility policies. Here, we take a novel and holistic approach to analysing transformative pathways towards sustainable urban mobility, considering the complex dynamics in metropolitan regions. To achieve this, we develop a toolset to assess the impact of potential measures to be taken by decision makers. Our innovative approach is based on the introduction of a new system framework to link the interrelated sector parameters of mobility systems by considering the effects of innovative mixed methods (both qualitative and quantitative) on scenario development and evaluation on the basis of global trends at the macro scale and their specific influences on the mobility sector at the local scale. To this end, we used a participatory modelling approach to develop scenarios and evaluate them as integrated simulation runs via a comprehensive and holistic system dynamics (SD) model. Thus, we estimated dynamic interdependencies between all of the factors relating to the mobility sector and then assigned business decision-making criteria to the urban systems. Furthermore, we introduced a sustainable net present value framework to estimate the sustainability outcomes of government investment in urban mobility infrastructure. A case study relating to the Rhine-Rhine-Ruhr metropolitan region in Germany was applied in order to simulate four scenarios co-created with stakeholders involved in our study, namely, Smart City, Sustainable/Healthy City, Deurbanisation and Business-as-Usual (BaU), which served as a solid basis from which to quantify path dependencies in terms of policy implementation. At the same time, recommendations were derived for sustainable mobility transformation within metropolitan regions.","Ani, Melkonyan; Jennifer, Koch; Fabian, Lohmar; Vasanth, Kamath; Munteanu, Victoria; Alexander Schmidt, J.; Bleischwitz, Raimund",Sustain Cities Soc,74,18

Despite intense experimental studies of graphene field effect transistor as DNA hybridization detector, the mechanism of detection and changes in the electrical properties of the device is not investigated in detail. To this end, we have investigated an armchair graphene nanoribbon (AGNR) interconnected between gold electrodes as a detector of DNA hybridization. Using non-equilibrium Green’s function method and density functional theory, the effect of 1-pyrenebutanoic acid succinimidyl ester (PBASE) linker, probe, and target DNA on the electrical properties of the device has been investigated at zero bias voltage. The results show that, after functionalization of AGNR with PBASE, the conductance of the device increases while functionalization with probe and target DNA leads to a decrease in conductance. The changes in the projected density of states on the AGNR and transmission around Fermi energy are the reason for the change in conductance of the system. In all cases, both charge transfer and electrostatic gating are responsible for the change in the electrical properties of the system. The results show that our device detects DNA hybridization with a sensitivity of 10% at zero bias voltage, and by applying a suitable gate voltage, it can show higher sensitivity.

Three strains showed amino acid insertions: PEDv/MEX/GTO/LI‐DMZC15/2015 and PEDv/MEX/QRO/LI‐DMZC45/2016 showed one amino acid insertion ((424)Y(425) and (447)D(448), respectively), and PEDv/MEX/QRO/LI‐DMZC49/2019 showed one and two amino acid insertions ((422)C(423) and (537)SQ(538)), with the second insertion in the COE region. These results provide evidence of the prevalence of emerging, non‐Indel‐S strains of the virus are currently circulating in Mexico during 2016–2018, when three of which have amino acid insertions: PEDv/MEX/GTO/IN‐DMZC15/2015 and PEDv/MEX/QRO/IN‐DMZC45/2016 have one amino acid insertion each ((424)Y(425) and (447)D(448), respectively), and PEDv/MEX/QRO/IN‐DMZC49/2019 has one ((422)C(423)) and two amino acid insertions ((537)SQ(538)), the latter being in the COE region, which could generate new antigenic variants.","Reveles‐Félix, Saúl; Carreón‐Nápoles, Rosalba; Mendoza‐Elvira, Susana; Quintero‐Ramírez, Víctor; García‐Sánchez, Juvencio; Martínez‐Bautista, Rebeca; Saavedra‐Montañez, Manuel; Mosqueda Gualito, Juan Joel; Sánchez‐Betancourt, José Ivan",Transbound Emerg Dis,74,1

In this study, a total of 2,930 (662 males and 2,268 females) adults answered a questionnaire obtaining information on their demographics, posttraumatic stress symptoms (i.e., intrusion and avoidance), social media exposure, social media involvement, and self-efficacy. Results of the latent profile analysis identified four latent profiles of posttraumatic stress symptoms, which are, no symptoms, high intrusion–low avoidance, moderate symptoms, and high symptoms. The multinomial logistic regression analyses revealed the contributors to the posttraumatic stress symptoms subgroups. Adults with high social media involvement were classified into the high intrusion–low avoidance group, whereas adults with low self-efficacy were included in the moderate symptoms group. Meanwhile, adults with high social media involvement and low self-efficacy were included in the high symptoms group. Interventions may focus on decreasing social media involvement for the adults in the high Intrusion–low avoidance group, improving self-efficacy for the adults in the moderate symptoms group, and reducing social media involvement and improving self-efficacy for the adults in the high symptoms group.","Duan, Wenjie; Guan, Qiujie; Jin, Qiuping",Front Public Health,74,10

Although trauma-focused cognitive behavior therapy (TF-CBT) has a strong evidence base, it is rarely adopted, delivered with adequate fidelity, or evaluated in the most common setting where youth access mental health services—schools. Given that individual behavior change is ultimately required for successful implementation, even when organizational factors are firmly in place, focusing on individual-level processes represents a potentially parsimonious approach. Beliefs and Attitudes for Successful Implementation in Schools (BASIS) is a pragmatic, motivationally focused multifaceted strategy that augments training and consultation and is designed to target precise mechanisms of behavior change to produce enhanced implementation and youth clinical outcomes. This study protocol describes a hybrid type 2 effectiveness-implementation trial designed to concurrently evaluate the main effects, mediators, and moderators of both the BASIS implementation strategy on implementation outcomes and TF-CBT on youth mental health outcomes. METHODS: Using a cluster randomized controlled design, this trial will assign school-based mental health (SMH) clinicians and schools to one of three study arms: (a) enhanced treatment-as-usual (TAU), (b) attention control plus TF-CBT, or (c) BASIS+TF-CBT. With a proposed sample of 120 SMH clinicians who will each recruit 4–6 youth with a history of trauma (480 children), this project will gather data across 12 different time points to address two project aims. Aim 1 will evaluate, relative to an enhanced TAU condition, the effects of TF-CBT on identified mechanisms of change, youth mental health outcomes, and intervention costs and cost-effectiveness. Aim 2 will compare the effects of BASIS against an attention control plus TF-CBT condition on theoretical mechanisms of clinician behavior change and implementation outcomes, as well as examine costs and cost-effectiveness. DISCUSSION: This study will generate critical knowledge about the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of BASIS—a pragmatic, theory-driven, and generalizable implementation strategy designed to enhance motivation—to increase the yield of evidence-based practice training and consultation, as well as the effectiveness of TF-CBT in a novel service setting.

Until now, there is no known safe treatment, hence the immunity system of the individual has a crucial role in recovering from this contagious disease. In general, the aged individuals probably have the highest rate of mortality due to COVID-19. It is well known that this immunity system can be affected by the age of the individual, so it is wise to consider an age-structured SEIR system to model Coronavirus transmission. For the COVID-19 epidemic, the individuals in the incubation stage are capable of infecting the susceptible individuals. All the mentioned points are regarded in building the responsible predictive mathematical model. The investigated model allows us to predict the spread of COID-19 in South Africa, Turkey, and Brazil. The epidemic peak outbreak in these countries is considered, and the estimated time of the end of infection is regarded by the help of some numerical simulations. Further, the influence of the isolation of the infected persons on the spread of COVID-19 disease is investigated.","Djilali, Salih; Ghanbari, Behzad",Chaos Solitons Fractals,74,10

This review covers the advances in vaccine nanotechnology with a perspective on the advantages of virus mimicry towards immune potentiation. It provides an overview to the different types of nanomaterials utilized for nanoparticle vaccine development, including functionalization strategies that bestow nanoparticles with virus-like features. As understanding of human immunity and vaccine mechanisms continue to evolve, recognizing the fundamental semblance between synthetic nanoparticles and viruses may offer an explanation for the superiority of nanoparticle vaccines over conventional vaccines and may spur new design rationales for future vaccine research.

The impact of SARS-CoV-2 on the quality of care for patients with liver disease is still unknown. AIMS: The Italian Association for the Study of the Liver (AISF) conducted a survey to assess the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on hepatology units activities in Italy. METHODS: A prospective web-based survey was proposed to all AISF active members. The survey was available online from April 8 2020 to May 3 2020 (lockdown phase in Italy). RESULTS: 194 AISF members answered the questionnaire, most of whom were specialists in Gastroenterology (41%) or Internal Medicine (28%), and worked in Northern Italy (51%). 26% of hepatology wards had been converted into COVID-19 wards, and 33% had had bed reductions. All hepatological activities, including the management of patients with decompensated liver disease, liver transplant and HCC had been significantly reduced/stopped. The number of physicians answering that their practices had not been modified ranged between 0.6% (for chronic hepatitis) to 47% (for the execution of paracentesis). The recorded answers were consistent among different regions, and did not show any north-south gradient CONCLUSION: COVID-19 outbreak significantly impacted on hepatological clinical activity. This survey can serve as a basis to compare the impact of future measures aimed at delivering an acceptable level of liver care during a national pandemic or crisis.","Aghemo, Alessio; Masarone, Mario; Montagnese, Sara; Petta, Salvatore; Ponziani, Francesca Romana; Russo, Francesco Paolo",Dig Liver Dis,74,1

It is unclear if people with depressive symptoms understand or apply COVID-19 information differently to the general population. Therefore, this study aimed to examine associations between depression, health beliefs, and face mask use during the COVID-19 pandemic among the general population in Hong Kong. This study gathered data from 11,072 Hong Kong adults via an online survey. Respondents self-reported their demographic characteristics, depressive symptoms (PHQ-9), face mask use, and health beliefs about COVID-19. Hierarchical logistic regression was used to identify independent variables associated with depression. The point-prevalence of probable depression was 46.5% (n = 5,150). Respondents reporting higher mask reuse (OR = 1.24, 95%CI 1.17–1.34), wearing masks for self-protection (OR = 1.03 95%CI 1.01–1.06), perceived high susceptibility (OR = 1.15, 95%CI 1.09–1.23), and high severity (OR = 1.33, 95%CI 1.28–1.37) were more likely to report depression. Depression was less likely in those with higher scores for cues to action (OR = 0.82, 95%CI 0.80–0.84), knowledge of COVID-19 (OR = 0.95, 95%CI 0.91–0.99), and self-efficacy to wear mask properly (OR = 0.90 95%CI 0.83–0.98). We identified a high point-prevalence of probable major depression and suicidal ideation during the COVID-19 outbreak in Hong Kong, but this should be viewed with caution due to the convenience sampling method employed. Future studies should recruit a representative probability sample in order to draw more reliable conclusions. The findings highlight that COVID-19 health information may be a protective factor of probable depression and suicidal ideation during the pandemic. Accurate and up-to-date health information should be disseminated to distressed and vulnerable subpopulations, perhaps using digital health technology, and social media platforms to prompt professional help-seeking behavior.","Bressington, Daniel Thomas; Cheung, Teris Cheuk Chi; Lam, Simon Ching; Suen, Lorna Kwai Ping; Fong, Tommy Kwan Hin; Ho, Hilda Sze Wing; Xiang, Yu-Tao",Front Psychiatry,74,1

The catalytic dyad His-41 and Cys-145 in the active pocket between domain I and II seem to polarize the π-electron density of the peptide bond between Gln and Ser in the octapeptide, leading to an increase of positive charge on C(CO) of Gln and negative charge on N(NH) of Ser. The possibility of enhancing the chemical bond between Gln and Ser based on the “distorted key” theory [Anal. Biochem. 233 (1996) 1] is examined. The scissile peptide bond between Gln and Ser is found to be solidified through “hybrid peptide bond” by changing the carbonyl group CO of Gln to CH(2) or CF(2). This leads to a break of the π-bond system for the peptide bond, making the octapeptide (AVLQSGFR) a “distorted key” and a potential starting system for the design of anti SARS drugs.","Du, Qi-Shi; Wang, Shu-Qing; Zhu, Yu; Wei, Dong-Qing; Guo, Hong; Sirois, Suzanne; Chou, Kuo-Chen",Peptides,74,20

The aim of this study‐based register is to support rapid and living evidence synthesis, including an evidence ecosystem of COVID‐19 research (CEOsys). In November and December 2020 we conducted an evaluation of the CCSR for CEOsys, measured its performance and identified areas for improvement. METHODS: For the evaluation we generated a purposive sample of 286 studies from 20 reviews to calculate the CCSR's comprehensiveness (sensitivity), accuracy (correctly classified and linked studies) and currency (time to publish and process references). RESULTS: Our sample showed that the CCSR had an overall comprehensiveness of 77.2%, with the highest coverage for interventional studies (94.4%). The study register had 100% coverage for trial registry records, 86.5% for journal articles and 52.4% for preprints. 98.3% of references were correctly classified with regard to study type, and 93.4% with regard to study aim. 89% of studies were correctly linked. 81.4% of references were published to the register in under 30 days, with 0.5 day (median) for trial registry records, 2 days for journal articles and 56 days for preprints. CONCLUSION: The CCSR had high comprehensiveness, accurate study classifications and short publishing times for journal articles and trial registry records in the sample. We identified that coverage and publishing time for preprints needed improvement. Finally, the evaluation illustrated the value of a study‐based register for identifying additional study references for analysis in evidence synthesis.","Metzendorf, Maria‐Inti; Featherstone, Robin M.",Res Synth Methods,74,1

Les priorités sanitaires et les circuits de soins sont modifiés. La chirurgie d’urgence reste prioritaire. Les interventions pour chirurgie fonctionnelles sont à reporter. La chirurgie par laparoscopie doit suivre des règles strictes pour ne pas exposer les professionnels à un surrisque. Le questionnement principal concerne la chirurgie oncologique, opérer ou reporter ? Il existe probablement un sur risque opératoire induit par la pandémie qui doit être mis en balance avec le retard de prise en charge chirurgical. Pour chaque type de cancer, colon, pancréas, œsogastrique, hépatocarcinome, la morbi-mortalité est rappelée et mise en parallèle avec le risque oncologique lié au retard à la chirurgie et/ou au temps de doublement de la tumeur. Cette comparaison permet de proposer des stratégies, ainsi pour les cancers coliques (T1-2, N0), il est souhaitable de retarder la chirurgie. Pour les lésions coliques avancées, il semble prudent de recommander une chimiothérapie néo adjuvante et d’attendre. Pour les cancers du rectum T3-4 et/ou N+, une radio-chimiothérapie est indiquée, une radiothérapie courte devra être discutée (suivie d’une période d’attente) afin de réduire le temps d’exposition à l’hôpital et d’éviter les infections. La majorité des chirurgies complexes à forte morbi-mortalité, œsogastrique, hépatique ou pancréatique doivent sans doute le plus souvent être reportée. Summary The COVID-19 pandemic is changing the organization of healthcare and has a direct impact on digestive surgery. Healthcare priorities and circuits are being modified. Emergency surgery is still a priority. Functional surgery is to be deferred. Laparoscopic surgery must follow strict rules so as not to expose healthcare professionals (HCPs) to added risk. The question looms large in cancer surgery – go ahead or defer? There is probably an added risk due to the pandemic that must be balanced against the risk incurred by deferring surgery. For each type of cancer – colon, pancreas, oesogastric, hepatocellular carcinoma – morbidity and mortality rates are stated and compared with the oncological risk incurred by deferring surgery and/or the tumour doubling time. Strategies can be proposed based on this comparison. For colonic cancers T1-2, N0, it is advisable to defer surgery. For advanced colonic lesions, it seems judicious to undertake neoadjuvant chemotherapy and then wait. For rectal cancers T3–4 and /or N+, chemoradiotherapy is indicated, short radiotherapy must be discussed (followed by a waiting period) to reduce time of exposure in the hospital and to prevent infections. Most complex surgery with high morbidity and mortality – oesogastric, hepatic or pancreatic – is most often best deferred.","Tuech, J.-J.; Gangloff, A.; Di Fiore, F.; Michel, P.; Brigand, C.; Slim, K.; Pocard, M.; Schwarz, L.",Journal de chirurgie viscerale,74,32

In this study, using patient-derived multi-omics data and in vitro infection assays, we aimed to understand the role of key metabolic pathways that can regulate severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) reproduction and their association with disease severity. We used multi-omics platforms (targeted and untargeted proteomics and untargeted metabolomics) on patient samples and cell line models along with immune phenotyping of metabolite transporters in patient blood to understand viral-induced metabolic modulations. We also modulated key metabolic pathways that were identified using multi-omics data to regulate the viral reproduction in vitro. COVID-19 disease severity was characterized by increased plasma glucose and mannose levels. Immune phenotyping identified altered expression patterns of carbohydrate transporter, GLUT1, in CD8(+) T-cells, intermediate and non-classical monocytes, and amino acid transporter, xCT, in classical, intermediate, and non-classical monocytes. In in vitro lung epithelial cell (Calu-3) infection model we found that glycolysis and glutaminolysis are essential for virus replication and blocking these metabolic pathways caused significant reduction in virus production. Taken together, we therefore hypothesized that SARS-CoV-2 utilizes and rewires pathways governing central carbon metabolism leading to the efflux of toxic metabolites and associated with disease severity. Thus, the host metabolic perturbation could be an attractive strategy to limit the viral replication and disease severity.","Krishnan, Shuba; Nordqvist, Hampus; Ambikan, Anoop T.; Gupta, Soham; Sperk, Maike; Svensson-Akusjärvi, Sara; Mikaeloff, Flora; Benfeitas, Rui; Saccon, Elisa; Ponnan, Sivasankaran Munusamy; Rodriguez, Jimmy Esneider; Nikouyan, Negin; Odeh, Amani; Ahlén, Gustaf; Asghar, Muhammad; Sällberg, Matti; Vesterbacka, Jan; Nowak, Piotr; Végvári, Ákos; Sönnerborg, Anders; Treutiger, Carl Johan; Neogi, Ujjwal",Mol Cell Proteomics,74,16

Feelings of nostalgia are said to occur during times of hardship and difficult transitionary periods, such as the first COVID-19 lockdown in the United Kingdom in 2020. Here, the reassurance of the past might have held certainty that could sustain a sense of meaning and purpose in life and influence wellbeing. The aims of the presented study were to explore the nature of music-induced nostalgia during the lockdown, by analysing participants’ narratives conjured by the music and their emotional responses to them, and to determinethe extent that using nostalgic music listening as an emotion regulation strategy had an impact on wellbeing. Data was collected by means of an online questionnaire, which retrospectively investigated nostalgic music during the lockdown. Participants listened to a self-selected piece of music that they had listened to 3 months prior whichinduced feelings of nostalgia, reported their resulting emotion and the content of memories associated with their nostalgia, and completed a questionnaire rating their experienced effect of nostalgia in relation to their piece of music. Following this, we investigated the functions that nostalgic music tends to have in regulating emotions through means of a pre-validated scale. 570 participants (34% identified as male) were recruited (age years M = 44, SD = 16). Concurrent with existing research, the findings suggest that there are significant differences in the affective and narrative content of nostalgicmusic listening in relation to which emotion regulation strategy was used, and that employing nostalgic music listening as a form of approaching difficult emotions can have a positive impact on wellbeing.","Gibbs, Hannah; Egermann, Hauke",Front Psychol,74,21

OBJECTIVE: Measuring patient‐centred health services in partnership with citizens, health professionals and decision makers. DESIGN: National participatory survey in a large test set of hospitals at national level. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: A total of 387 hospital visits conducted in 16 Italian regions by over 1,500 citizens and health professionals during 2017‐2018. MAIN VARIABLES AND OUTCOME MEASURES: An ad hoc checklist was used to assess person‐centredness in hospital care through 243 items, grouped in 4 main areas, 12 sub‐areas and 29 person‐centred criteria (scored 0‐10). GEE linear multivariate regression was used to explore the relation between hospital characteristics and person‐centredness. RESULTS: Person‐centred scores were moderately high, with substantial variation overall (median score: 7.0, range: 3.2‐9.5) and by area (Care Processes: 6.8, 2.0‐9.8; Access: 7.4, 2.7‐9.7; Transparency: 6.7, 3.4‐9.5 and Relationship: 7.3, 0.8‐10.0). Multivariate regression found higher scores for increasing volumes of activity (quartile increase: +0.21; 95% CI: 0.13, 0.29) and lower scores in the south and islands (−1.03; −1.62,‐0.45). DISCUSSION: The checklist has been applied successfully by over 1,500 collaborators who assessed hospitals in 16 distinct Regions and Autonomous Provinces of Italy. Despite an overall positive mark, all scores were highly variable by location and hospital characteristics. CONCLUSION AND PATIENT OR PUBLIC CONTRIBUTION: A national participatory programme to improve patient‐centredness in Italian hospitals highlighted critical areas with the direct input of citizens.","Cardinali, Flavia; Carzaniga, Sara; Duranti, Giorgia; Labella, Barbara; Lamanna, Alessandro; Cerilli, Micaela; Caracci, Giovanni; Carinci, Fabrizio",Health Expect,74,24

Methods The provinces that reported more than 500 cases of COVID−19 till February 18, 2020 were selected as the major endemic area. The Verhulst model was used to fit the growth rate of cumulative confirmed cases. The R0 of COVID−19 was calculated using the parameters of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and COVID−19, respectively. The latent class of R0 was analyzed using a latent profile analysis model. Results The median R0 calculated from SARS and COVID−19 parameters were 1.84 − 3.18 and 1.74 − 2.91, respectively. The R0 calculated from the SARS parameters was greater than that of calculated from the COVID−19 parameters (Z = −4.782 − −4.623, P < 0.01). Both R0 can be divided into three latent classes. The initial value of R0 in class 1 (Shandong Province, Sichuan Province and Chongqing Municipality) was relatively low and decreases slowly. The initial value of R0 in class 2 (Anhui Province, Hunan Province, Jiangxi Province, Henan Province, Zhejiang Province, Guangdong Province and Jiangsu Province) was relatively high and decreases rapidly. Moreover, the initial value of R0 of class 3 (Hubei Province) was between that of class 1 and class 2, but the higher level of R0 lasts longer and decreases slowly. Conclusion The results indicated that overall trend of R0 has been falling with the strengthening of China's comprehensive prevention and control measures for COVID−19, however, presents regional differences.","Xu, Honglv; Yuan, Min; Ma, Liya; Liu, Meng; Zhang, Yi; Liu, Wenwen; Gan, Hong; Tao, Fangbiao",,74,21

It is an antiviral herb that can be used to prevent Influenza virus infections in the border areas between China and Vietnam. Local people call it ‘Purple Ban-lan-gen’ because its root is very similar to that of Strobilanthes cusia (Nees) Kuntze, which is called ‘Southern Ban-lan-gen’ and is listed in Chinese Pharmacopeia. The two species have been used interchangeably locally. However, their pharmacological equivalence has caused concern for years. We have sequenced the chloroplast genome of S. cusia previously. In this study, we sequenced the complete chloroplast genome sequence of S. bantonensis to preform in-depth comparative genetic analysis of the two Strobilanthes species. The chloroplast genome of S. bantonensis is a circular DNA molecule with a total length of 144,591 bp and encodes 84 protein-coding, 8 ribosomes, and 37 transfer RNA genes. The chloroplast genome has a conservative quadripartite structure, including a large single-copy (LSC) region, a small single-copy (SSC) region, and a pair of inverted repeat (IR) regions, with lengths of 92,068 bp, 17,767 bp, and 17,378 bp, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis confirmed that S. bantonensis is closely related to the S. cusia. Compared with other species from Acanthaceae, S. bantonensis has a significantly shortened IR region, suggesting the occurrence of IR contraction events. This study will help future taxonomic, evolutionary, phylogenetic, and bioprospecting studies of the sizeable Strobilanthes genus, which contains over 400 species.","Wu, Wuwei; Li, Jingling; Liu, Yu; Jiang, Mei; Lan, Mingsheng; Liu, Chang","Mitochondrial DNA.

Beside the bacterium Xylella fastidiosa, the main players considered in the model are its insect vectors, Philaenus spumarius, and the host plants (olive trees and weeds) of the insects and of the bacterium. The model was based on a system of ordinary differential equations, the analysis of which provided interesting results about possible equilibria of the epidemic system and guidelines for its numerical simulations. Although the model presented there was mathematically rather simplified, its analysis has highlighted threshold parameters that could be the target of control strategies within an integrated pest management framework, not requiring the removal of the productive resource represented by the olive trees. Indeed, numerical simulations support the outcomes of the mathematical analysis, according to which the removal of a suitable amount of weed biomass (reservoir of Xylella fastidiosa) from olive orchards and surrounding areas resulted in the most efficient strategy to control the spread of the OQDS. In addition, as expected, the adoption of more resistant olive tree cultivars has been shown to be a good strategy, though less cost-effective, in controlling the pathogen. In this paper for a more realistic description and a clearer interpretation of the proposed control measures, a spatial structure of the epidemic system has been included, but, in order to keep mathematical technicalities to a minimum, only two players have been described in a dynamical way, trees and insects, while the weed biomass is taken to be a given quantity. The control measures have been introduced only on a subregion of the whole habitat, in order to contain costs of intervention. We show that such a practice can lead to the eradication of an epidemic outbreak. Numerical simulations confirm both the results of the previous paper and the theoretical results of the model with a spatial structure, though subject to regional control only.","Aniţa, Sebastian; Capasso, Vincenzo; Scacchi, Simone",Bull Math Biol,74,20

While some studies suggest that exposure to pollution is associated with higher rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection, its role is unknown in the development of neurologic symptoms in COVID-19 patients. The response of the central nervous system (CNS) to a SARS-CoV-2 infection may be influenced by its inflammatory state. Interestingly, environmental pollutants such as particulate matter may have neuroinflammatory effects, providing a possible link between exposure to these pollutants and the outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the CNS.

Within the framework of life-history theory (LHT), this pre-registered study investigated whether extrinsic risk (i.e., external factors that pose a risk to an individual’s life, e.g., COVID-19) and existential risk (i.e., risks with outcomes that threaten the existence of humans as a species, e.g., climate change) had similar or different relationships with reproductive decision-making.

Participants were asked about their experiences of COVID-19 and given a series of scales with which to assess their beliefs about climate change. In support of LHT, the study found evidence that knowing people who had been hospitalized with or died of COVID-19 was associated with a greater ideal number of children. Conversely, there was no clear evidence of a relationship between climate change beliefs and reproductive decision-making.

It is common for these insectivorous bats to roost in anthropogenic structures in urban regions. Additionally, Neoromicia capensis have previously been identified as potential hosts for Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-related coronaviruses. This study aimed to ascertain the gastrointestinal virome of these bats, as viruses excreted in fecal material or which may be replicating in rectal or intestinal tissues have the greatest opportunities of coming into contact with other hosts. Samples were collected in five regions of South Africa over eight years. Initial virome composition was determined by viral metagenomic sequencing by pooling samples and enriching for viral particles. Libraries were sequenced on the Illumina MiSeq and NextSeq500 platforms, producing a combined 37 million reads. Bioinformatics analysis of the high throughput sequencing data detected the full genome of a novel species of the Circoviridae family, and also identified sequence data from the Adenoviridae, Coronaviridae, Herpesviridae, Parvoviridae, Papillomaviridae, Phenuiviridae, and Picornaviridae families. Metagenomic sequencing data was insufficient to determine the viral diversity of certain families due to the fragmented coverage of genomes and lack of suitable sequencing depth, as some viruses were detected from the analysis of reads-data only. Follow up conventional PCR assays targeting conserved gene regions for the Adenoviridae, Coronaviridae, and Herpesviridae families were used to confirm metagenomic data and generate additional sequences to determine genetic diversity. The complete coding genome of a MERS-related coronavirus was recovered with additional amplicon sequencing on the MiSeq platform. The new genome shared 97.2% overall nucleotide identity to a previous Neoromicia-associated MERS-related virus, also from South Africa. Conventional PCR analysis detected diverse adenovirus and herpesvirus sequences that were widespread throughout Neoromicia populations in South Africa. Furthermore, similar adenovirus sequences were detected within these populations throughout several years. With the exception of the coronaviruses, the study represents the first report of sequence data from several viral families within a Southern African insectivorous bat genus; highlighting the need for continued investigations in this regard.","Geldenhuys, Marike; Mortlock, Marinda; Weyer, Jacqueline; Bezuidt, Oliver; Seamark, Ernest C.

Despite this progress, contemporary STEMI care does not consistently meet the national guideline-recommended goals, which offers an opportunity for further improvement in STEMI outcomes. The lack of single, comprehensive, national STEMI registry complicates our ability to improve STEMI outcomes in particular for high-risk STEMI subsets such as cardiac arrest (CA) and/or cardiogenic shock (CS). Objectives To address this need, the Midwest STEMI Consortium (MSC) was created as a collaboration of 4 large, regional STEMI care systems to provide a comprehensive, multicenter, and prospective STEMI registry without any exclusionary criteria. Methods The MSC is a collaboration of 4 large, regional STEMI care systems: Iowa Heart Center in Des Moines, IA; Minneapolis Heart Institute Foundation in Minneapolis, MN; Prairie Heart Institute in Springfield, IL; and The Christ Hospital in Cincinnati, OH. Each has similar standardized STEMI protocol and together include 6 percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)-capable hospitals and over 100 non-PCI-capable hospitals. Each center had a prospective database that was transferred to a data coordinating center to create the multicenter database. The comprehensive database includes traditional risk factors, cardiovascular history, medications, time to treatment data, detailed angiographic characteristics, and short- and long-term clinical outcomes up to 5-year for myocardial infarction, stroke, and cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. Ten-year mortality rates were assessed by using national death index. Results Currently, the comprehensive database (03/2003-01/2020) includes 14,911 consecutive STEMI patients with mean age of 62.3 ± 13.6 years, female gender (29%), and left anterior descending artery as the culprit vessel (34%). High risk features included: Age >75 years (19%), left ventricular ejection fraction <35% (15%), CA (10%), and CS (8%). Conclusion This collaboration of 4 large, regional STEMI care systems with broad entry criteria including high-risk STEMI subsets such as CA and/or CS provides a unique platform to conduct clinical research studies to optimize STEMI care.","Yildiz, Mehmet; Sharkey, Scott; Aguirre, Frank V.; Tannenbaum, Mark; Garberich, Ross; Smith, Timothy D.; Shivapour, Daniel; Schmidt, Christian W.; Pacheco-Coronado, Roberto; Rohm, Heather S.; Chambers, Jenny; Coulson, Teresa; Garcia, Santiago; Henry, Timothy D.",Cardiovascular Revascularization Medicine,74,33

METHODS: We systematically identified all PLWH who were diagnosed with COVID-19 at a large hospital from 3 March to 26 April 2020 during an outbreak in Massachusetts. We analyzed each of the cases to extract information including demographics, medical comorbidities, clinical presentation, and illness course after COVID-19 diagnosis. RESULTS: We describe a cohort of 36 PLWH with confirmed COVID-19 and another 11 patients with probable COVID-19. Almost 85% of PLWH with confirmed COVID-19 had a comorbidity associated with severe disease, including obesity, cardiovascular disease, or hypertension.

Differences between physician and sleep technologist concerns with regard to viral exposure and mitigation strategies may inform protocols to ensure safety and promote patient and health-care worker resilience and retention. METHODS: An anonymous online survey aimed at sleep medicine practitioners was active from April 29, 2020 to May 8, 2020. RESULTS: We obtained 379 responses, including from 75 physicians and 283 technologists. The proportion of all the respondents who were extremely/very concerned about the following: exposing patients (70.8%), exposing technologists (81.7%), and droplet (82.7%) and airborne (81.6%) transmission from CPAP. The proportion of respondents who felt that aerosol precautions were extremely/very important varied by scenario: always needed (45.6%); only with CPAP (25.9%); and needed, despite negative viral testing (67.0%). More technologists versus physicians rated the following as extremely/very important: testing parents for COVID-19 (71.2 vs 47.5%; P = .01), high-efficiency particulate air filters (75.1 vs 61.8%; P = .02), and extremely/very concerned about shared-ventilation systems (65.9 vs 51.5%; shared ventilation P = .041).

All isolates could not be identified for known viral pathogens by routine diagnostic assays. They were pooled into 8 groups of 5–6 isolates to reduce the sequencing cost. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) was conducted for each group of mixed samples, and the proposed data analysis pipeline was used to identify viral pathogens in these mixed samples. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was individually conducted for each of these 42 isolates depending on the predicted viral types in each group. Two isolates remained unknown after these tests. Moreover, iteration mapping was implemented for each of these 2 isolates, and predicted human parechovirus (HPeV) in both. In summary, our NGS pipeline detected the following viruses among the 42 isolates: 29 human rhinoviruses (HRVs), 10 HPeVs, 1 human adenovirus (HAdV), 1 echovirus and 1 rotavirus. We then focused on the 10 identified Taiwanese HPeVs because of their reported clinical significance over HRVs. Their genomes were assembled and their genetic diversity was explored. One novel 6-bp deletion was found in one HPeV-1 virus. In terms of nucleotide heterogeneity, 64 genetic variants were detected from these HPeVs using the mapped NGS reads. Most importantly, a recombination event was found between our HPeV-3 and a known HPeV-4 strain in the database. Similar event was detected in the other HPeV-3 strains in the same clade of the phylogenetic tree. These findings demonstrated that the proposed NGS data analysis pipeline identified unknown viruses from the mixed clinical samples, revealed their genetic identity and variants, and characterized their genetic features in terms of viral evolution.","Gong, Yu-Nong; Chen, Guang-Wu; Yang, Shu-Li; Lee, Ching-Ju; Shih, Shin-Ru; Tsao, Kuo-Chien",PLoS One,74,23

METHODS: After 15 yr of clinical use, findings of a pharmacovigilance report (February 1996–March 2012) relating to the four-factor PCC Beriplex P/N (CSL Behring, Marburg, Germany) were analysed and are presented here. Furthermore, a review of the literature with regard to the efficacy and safety of four-factor PCCs was performed. RESULTS: Since receiving marketing authorization (February 21, 1996), ∼647 250 standard applications of Beriplex P/N have taken place. During this time, 21 thromboembolic events judged to be possibly related to Beriplex P/N administration have been reported, while no incidences of viral transmission or heparin-induced thrombocytopenia were documented. The low risk of thromboembolic events reported during the observation period (one in ∼31 000) is in line with the incidence observed with other four-factor PCCs. CONCLUSIONS: In general, four-factor PCCs have proven to be well tolerated and highly effective in the rapid reversal of vitamin K antagonists.","Hanke, A.A.; Joch, C.; Görlinger, K.",Br J Anaesth,74,16

There is no report of any clinically endorsed antiviral medications or antibodies that are successful against COVID-19. It has quickly spread everywhere, presenting tremendous well-being, financial, ecological, and social difficulties to the whole human populace. The COVID flare-up is seriously disturbing the worldwide economy. Practically all the countries are battling to hinder the transmission of the malady by testing and treating patients, isolating speculated people through contact following, confining huge social affairs, keeping up total or incomplete lockdown, etc. Proper scheduling of nursing workers and optimal designation of nurses may significantly affect the quality of clinical facilities. It is delivered by eliminating unbalanced workloads or undue stress, which could lead to decreased nurse performance and potential human errors., Nurses are frequently asked to leave while caring for all sick patients. However, regular scheduling formulas are not thought to consider this possibility because they are out of scheduling control in typical scenarios. In this paper, a novel model of the Hybrid Salp Swarm Algorithm and Genetic Algorithm (HSSAGA) is proposed to solve nurses’ scheduling and designation. The findings of the suggested test function algorithm demonstrate that this algorithm has outperformed state-of-the-art approaches.","Abadi, Moein Qaisari Hasan; Rahmati, Sara; Sharifi, Abbas; Ahmadi, Mohsen",Appl Soft Comput,74,16

However, it is proving to be more dangerous during the COVID-19 pandemic. Tobacco use may increase the risk of being infected, increases the chances of complications, and also increases the probability of its spread. We assessed the awareness about this association and the impact of the lockdown on tobacco use among tobacco users registered before the lockdown for LifeFirst, a tobacco dependence treatment program. METHODS: 1016 tobacco users were under active follow-up in their course of the 6-month counselling program. From 14 to 28 May 2020, 650 (64%) of these registered users were contacted by counsellors for follow-up sessions over the telephone. Semi-structured questionnaires were filled in during the calls. RESULTS: Two-thirds (67%) of tobacco users were unaware of the association between tobacco and COVID-19. Only 30% of the users felt that the current situation had affected their tobacco use, the commonest impacts being unavailability and increased prices of tobacco products. While this was seen as an opportunity to quit by some users, some reported increased tobacco use due to increased stress. Of the 219 (34%) tobacco users who quit tobacco during the lockdown, 51% quit because of the lockdown and their concern over COVID-19. Abstinence among those who were aware of the association between the coronavirus and tobacco was twice that among those who were not aware. CONCLUSIONS: Awareness activities about the harmful effects of tobacco during the coronavirus pandemic have to be strengthened. Measures to motivate and support tobacco users to quit have to be provided through cessation services.","Gupte, Himanshu A.; Mandal, Gauri; Jagiasi, Dinesh",Tob Prev Cessat,74,1
