It is a causative agent of enteric and respiratory diseases of cattle. The S1 subunit of the viral S glycoprotein is responsible for virus binding to host-cell receptors, induction of neutralizing antibody and hemagglutinin activity. The entire S1 genomic region (2304 bp) of two enteric bovine coronavirus isolates from Austria, one respiratory and one enteric isolate from Slovakia were analyzed at the genetic level. The comparative analysis of those four isolates revealed 97.1-98.6% similarity at the nucleotide and 95.6-98.6% at the amino acid level. No differences between enteric and respiratory isolates were observed at the genetic level. The isolates were clustered in the phylogenetic tree with European isolates independently of their enteric or respiratory origin.","Vilček, S; Jacková, A; Kolesárová, M; Vlasáková, M",Acta virologica,832,9

Preliminary report of first series.,8.392798,3.4539583,2015,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE We aimed to investigate the safety and efficacy of the Push and Fluff technique (PFT) as compared with the standard unsheathing technique for closed-cell stent retrievers in acute ischemic stroke. METHODS Acute ischemic stroke thrombectomy database was analyzed (September 2010 to January 2015) with the Trevo Retriever as a primary strategy. The PFT was compared with our internal standard unsheathing technique and with the Trevo Versus Merci Retrievers for Thrombectomy Revascularization of Large Vessel Occlusions in Acute Ischemic Stroke 2 (TREVO2) trial. Additionally, a silicon flow model was used to compare cell size/configuration, wall apposition/device diameter, and degree of foreshortening/device length across the 2 techniques. RESULTS One hundred fifty-one out of 662 patients qualified for the study. The PFT (n=71) was associated with higher rates of first-pass reperfusion (54% versus 35%, P=0.03; 54% versus 32.6%, P<0.01), lower number of passes (1.3±0.8 versus 1.8±1.0, P<0.01; 1.7±1.0 versus 2.4±1.6, P<0.01), and higher rates of modified treatment in cerebral ischemia-3 reperfusion (58% versus 40%, P=0.03; 58% versus 14%, P<0.01) as compared with the standard unsheathing technique (n=81) and the TREVO2 Trevo arm (n=88), respectively. No differences in hemorrhagic complications were observed across the groups. The in vitro model indicated that, compared with standard unsheathing technique, PFT resulted in improved wall apposition (device diameter, 75% larger) and cell size (mean area, 51% larger) at the cost of a mild degree of foreshortening (25% length reduction). CONCLUSIONS The PFT is safe and leads to optimization of wall apposition and cell size/configuration, resulting in higher chances of first-pass reperfusion, lower number of passes, and better rates of complete reperfusion.","Haussen, Diogo C; Rebello, Leticia C; Nogueira, Raul G",Stroke,832,13

Outcome of randomized prospective trial.,8.626745,3.5082014,2020-03-01,"BACKGROUND Japan has established comprehensive education-scholarship programs to supply physicians in rural areas. Their entrants now comprise 16% of all medical students, and graduates must work in rural areas for a designated number of years. These programs are now being adopted outside Japan, but their medium-term outcomes and inter-program differences are unknown. METHODS A nationwide prospective cohort study of newly licensed physicians 2014-2018 (n = 2454) of the four major types of the programs-Jichi Medical University (Jichi); regional quota with scholarship; non-quota with scholarship (scholarship alone); and quota without scholarship (quota alone)-and all Japanese physicians in the same postgraduate year (n = 40,293) was conducted with follow-up workplace information from the Physician Census 2018, Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare. In addition, annual cross-sectional survey for prefectural governments and medical schools 2014-2019 was conducted to obtain information on the results of National Physician License Examination and retention status for contractual workforce. RESULTS Passing rate of the National Physician License Examination was highest in Jichi, followed in descending order by quota with scholarship, the other two programs, and all medical graduates. The retention rate for contractual rural service of Jichi graduates 5 years after graduation (n = 683; 98%) was higher than that of quota with scholarship (2868; 90%; P < 0.001) and scholarship alone (2220; 81% < 0.001). Relative risks of working in municipalities with the least population density quintile in Jichi, quota with scholarship, scholarship alone, and quota alone in postgraduate year 5 were 4.0 (95% CI 3.7-4.4; P < 0.001), 3.1 (2.6-3.7; < 0.001), 2.5 (2.1-3.0; < 0.001), and 2.5 (1.9-3.3; < 0.001) as compared with all Japanese physicians. There was no significant difference between each program and all physicians in the proportion of those who specialized in internal medicine or general practice in postgraduate years 3 to 5 CONCLUSIONS: Japan's education policies to produce rural physicians are effective but the degree of effectiveness varies among the programs. Policymakers and medical educators should plan their future rural workforce policies with reference to the effectiveness and variations of these programs.","Matsumoto, Masatoshi; Matsuyama, Yasushi; Kashima, Saori; Koike, Soichi; Okazaki, Yuji; Kotani, Kazuhiko; Owaki, Tetsuhiro; Ishikawa, Shizukiyo; Iguchi, Seitaro; Okazaki, Hitoaki; Maeda, Takahiro",Human resources for health,832,19

Yet, limited information exists on the longer-term (>6 months) effects of iCBT and adherence to these interventions. OBJECTIVE The primary aim of this study was to evaluate the longitudinal (12 months) effectiveness of a fully automated, self-guided iCBT intervention called Thrive, designed to enhance engagement with a rural population of adults with depression symptoms. The secondary aim was to determine whether the program adherence enhanced the effectiveness of the Thrive intervention. METHODS We analyzed data from 181 adults who used the Thrive intervention. Using self-reports, participants were evaluated at baseline, 8 weeks, 6 months, and 12 months for the primary outcome of depression symptom severity using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) scale and secondary outcome measures, namely, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale-7 (GAD-7) scores, Work and Social Adjustment Scale (WSAS) scores, Conner-Davidson Resilience Scale-10 (CD-RISC-10) scores, and suicidal ideation (ninth item of the PHQ-9 scale) scores. The Thrive program adherence was measured using the numbers of program logins, page views, and lessons completed. RESULTS The assessment response rates for 8-week, 6-month, and 12-month outcomes were 58.6% (106/181), 50.3% (91/181), and 51.4% (93/181), respectively. By 8 weeks, significant improvements were observed for all outcome measures. These improvements were maintained at 12 months with mean reductions in severities of depression (mean -6.5; P<.001) and anxiety symptoms (mean -4.3; P<.001). Improvements were also observed in work and social functioning (mean -6.9; P<.001) and resilience (mean 4.3; P<.001). Marked decreases were observed in suicidal ideation (PHQ-9 ninth item score >1) at 6 months (16.5%) and 12 months (17.2%) compared to baseline (39.8%) (P<.001). In regard to the program adherence, cumulative counts of page views and lessons completed were significantly related to lower PHQ-9, GAD-7, and WSAS scores and higher CD-RISC-10 scores (all P values <.001 with an exception of page views with WSAS for which P value was .02). CONCLUSIONS The Thrive intervention was effective at reducing depression and anxiety symptom severity and improving functioning and resilience among a population of adults from mostly rural communities in the United States. These gains were maintained at 1 year. Program adherence, measured by the number of logins and lessons completed, indicates that users who engage more with the program benefit more from the intervention.

People with multimorbidity have higher health care costs, which can create a financial burden. OBJECTIVE To synthesize qualitative research exploring experience of financial burden for people with multimorbidity. SEARCH STRATEGY Six databases were searched in May 2019. A grey literature search and backward and forward citation checking were also conducted. INCLUSION CRITERIA Studies were included if they used a qualitative design, conducted primary data collection, included references to financial burden and had at least one community-dwelling adult participant with two or more chronic conditions. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Screening and critical appraisal were conducted by two reviewers independently. One reviewer extracted data from the results section; this was checked by a second reviewer. GRADE-CERQual was used to summarize the certainty of the evidence. Data were analysed using thematic synthesis. MAIN RESULTS Forty-six studies from six continents were included. Four themes were generated: the high costs people with multimorbidity experience, the coping strategies they use to manage these costs, and the negative effect of both these on their well-being. Health insurance and government supports determine the manageability and level of costs experienced. DISCUSSION Financial burden has a negative effect on people with multimorbidity. Continuity of care and an awareness of the impact of financial burden of multimorbidity amongst policymakers and health care providers may partially address the issue. PATIENT OR PUBLIC CONTRIBUTION Results were presented to a panel of people with multimorbidity to check whether the language and themes 'resonated' with their experiences.","Larkin, James; Foley, Louise; Smith, Susan M; Harrington, Patricia; Clyne, Barbara",Health expectations : an international journal of public participation in health care and health policy,832,14

Several important steps in epilepsy surgery have been achieved since, including resection techniques such as anterior temporal lobectomy and selective amygdalohippocampectomy, both resulting in 70-80% seizure freedom and distinct differences in neuropsychological outcomes. The most recent addition to techniques for epilepsy surgery is minimally invasive thermal therapy. Significant advances in imaging technology and thermal ablation have opened a novel avenue for epilepsy treatment, permitting surgical intervention with seizure-freedom rates approaching the success of traditional methods but with reduced invasiveness, blood loss and duration of postoperative hospital stay. Here, we review recent advances on stereotactic ablation techniques focused on epilepsy surgery. Finally, we present emerging navigation techniques, which allow a higher degree of freedom. The described technologies render precise navigation of the ablation probe to avoid critical structures along the trajectory path and open novel pathways to further minimize invasiveness and improve safety and efficacy.

In an attempt to decrease such morbidity, we present a novel approach: delayed laparoscopic management. CASE A patient with placenta increta was delivered by Caesarean section, followed by closure of the uterine incision, with the placenta left in situ. The patient underwent total laparoscopic hysterectomy three weeks later. She did not receive any blood product transfusions, either at the time of Caesarean section or at the time of hysterectomy. CONCLUSION A laparoscopic approach may be considered for delayed surgical management of abnormal placentation. Key factors for success consist of a multi-disciplinary approach, the availability of skilled laparoscopic surgeons and advanced endoscopic equipment, and the availability of resources in the event of complications.","Arendas, Kristina; Lortie, Karine J; Singh, Sukhbir S",Journal of obstetrics and gynaecology Canada : JOGC = Journal d'obstetrique et gynecologie du Canada : JOGC,832,28

AIMS To examine the role of comorbidities and complications in predicting in-hospital mortality since the introduction of continuous flow (CF)-LVAD. METHODS The Nationwide Inpatient Sample was queried from 2010 to 2014 using International Classification of Disease-9 code for LVAD among patients 18 years or older. The sample consisted of 2,359 patients (mean age = 55 ± 13.7 years, 76.8% men, 59.3% Caucasian). RESULTS Comparative analysis revealed mortality did not differ from 2010 to 2014 (p = 0.653). Increases in comorbidities of atrial fibrillation, acute kidney injury, mechanical ventilation, body mass index ≥ 25, cerebrovascular disease, and mild liver disease were evidenced over the 5-year period (p values ≤ 0.049). Multivariate analysis showed that significant predictors of mortality were comorbid hemodialysis (AOR = 7.62, 95% CI [4.78, 12.27]), cerebrovascular disease (AOR = 5.38, 95% CI [3.49, 8.26]), mechanical ventilation (AOR = 3.83, 95% CI [2.84, 5.18]), mild liver disease (AOR = 1.96, 95% CI [1.38, 2.76]), and acute kidney injury (AOR = 1.62, 95% CI [1.16, 2.28]). Predictive complications included disseminated intravascular coagulation (AOR = 6.41, 95% CI [2.79, 6.84]), sepsis (AOR = 4.37, 95% CI [2.79, 6.84]), septic shock (AOR = 3.9, 95% CI [2.11, 7.59]), and gastrointestinal bleed (AOR = 1.81, 95% CI [1.11, 2.93]).

Initial report.,8.365345,3.6101377,2014,"BACKGROUND Transplantation of neural stem cells (NSCs) has been proposed as a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of ischemia/reperfusion (I/R)-induced brain injury. However, existing evidence has also challenged this therapy on its limitations, such as the difficulty for stem cells to survive after transplantation due to the unfavorable microenvironment in the ischemic brain. Herein, we have investigated whether preconditioning of NSCs with adjudin, a small molecule compound, could enhance their survivability and further improve the therapeutic effect for NSC-based stroke therapy. METHOD We aimed to examine the effect of adjudin pretreatment on NSCs by measuring a panel of parameters after their transplantation into the infarct area of ipsilateral striatum 24 hours after I/R in mice. RESULTS We found that pretreatment of NSCs with adjudin could enhance the viability of NSCs after their transplantation into the stroke-induced infarct area. Compared with the untreated NSC group, the adjudin-preconditioned group showed decreased infarct volume and neurobehavioral deficiency through ameliorating blood-brain barrier disruption and promoting the expression and secretion of brain-derived neurotrophic factor. We also employed H2O2-induced cell death model in vitro and found that adjudin preconditioning could promote NSC survival through inhibition of oxidative stress and activation of Akt signaling pathway. CONCLUSION This study showed that adjudin could be used to precondition NSCs to enhance their survivability and improve recovery in the stroke model, unveiling the value of adjudin for stem cell-based stroke therapy.","Zhang, Tingting; Yang, Xiao; Liu, Tengyuan; Shao, Jiaxiang; Fu, Ningzhen; Yan, Aijuan; Geng, Keyi; Xia, Weiliang",Stem cell research & therapy,832,24

Comperative study of WTP vs. Toupet fundoplication - results of 151 consecutive cases.,8.4879465,3.5838642,2016,"BACKGROUND Viral upper and lower respiratory tract infections (URI, LRI) are common in infants. We determined the prevalence of viral URI and its complications, including acute otitis media (AOM) and LRI, and assessed the effect of bacterial-viral interactions, and genetic and environmental risks on AOM development. METHODS Healthy infants were enrolled from near birth and followed to the first episode of AOM up to 12 months of age. Nasopharyngeal specimens were collected at monthly intervals (months 1-6, 9) and during viral URI episodes for bacterial culture and viral polymerase chain reaction studies. Subjects were followed closely for AOM development. RESULTS A total of 367 infants were followed for 286 child-years; 887 URI (305 infants) and 180 AOM episodes (143 infants) were documented. Prevalence of URI, LRI, and AOM in the first year was 3.2, 0.25, and 0.67 per child-year, respectively. Cumulative AOM incidence by ages 3, 6, and 12 months was 6%, 23%, and 46%. Infants with and without AOM had 4.7 and 2.3 URI episodes per child-year, respectively (P < .002). Pathogenic bacterial colonization rates by month were significantly higher in infants with AOM (P < .005). Breastfeeding reduced both URI and AOM risks (P < .05). Significant bacterial-viral interactions occurred with Moraxella catarrhalis and a variety of respiratory viruses and altered URI and AOM risks. CONCLUSIONS Almost half of infants experienced AOM by age 1. Important AOM risk factors included frequent viral URI, pathogenic bacterial colonization, and lack of breastfeeding. Bacterial-viral interactions may play a significant role in AOM pathogenesis and deserve further investigation.","Chonmaitree, Tasnee; Trujillo, Rocio; Jennings, Kristofer; Alvarez-Fernandez, Pedro; Patel, Janak A; Loeffelholz, Michael J; Nokso-Koivisto, Johanna; Matalon, Reuben; Pyles, Richard B; Miller, Aaron L; McCormick, David P",Pediatrics,832,31

However, there are no clear guidelines regarding the optimal ventilation strategy. We hypothesized that airway pressure release ventilation (APRV) would mitigate lung injury in a preterm porcine neonatal model. METHODS Preterm piglets were delivered on gestational day 98 (85% of 115day term), instrumented, and randomized to volume guarantee (VG; n=10) with low tidal volumes (5.5cm3kg-1) and PEEP 4cmH2O or APRV (n=10) with initial ventilator settings: PHigh 18cmH2O, PLow 0cmH2O, THigh 1.30s, TLow 0.15s. Ventilator setting changes were made in response to clinical parameters in both groups. Animals were monitored continuously for 24hours. RESULTS The mortality rates between the two groups were not significantly different (p>0.05). The VG group had relatively increased oxygen requirements (FiO2 50%±9%) compared with the APRV group (FiO2 28%±5%; p>0.05) and a decrease in PaO2/FiO2 ratio (VG 162±33mmHg; APRV 251±45mmHg; p<0.05). The compliance of the VG group (0.51±0.07L·cmH2O-1) was significantly less than the APRV group (0.90±0.06L·cmH2O-1; p<0.05). CONCLUSION This study demonstrates that APRV improves oxygenation and compliance as compared with VG.

Materials and methods This was an interventional study with 30 children of age 6-10 years came to the Department of Pedodontics and Preventive Dentistry. The intervention was distraction with virtual reality eyeglasses and the parameters considered includes pain perception analyzed subjectively by Wong Baker FACES pain rating scale and objectively by FLACC scale; anxiety was analyzed physiologically by measuring pulse rate and oxygen saturation levels using pulse oximeter. The parameters were recorded before the treatment, i.e., baseline, during and as well as after the restorative treatment procedure. The values noted were tabulated and subjected to appropriate statistical analysis with p value set at 0.05. Results The study displayed a very high statistical significance in reduction of pain perception and anxiety levels in all the comparisons made at three time periods, i.e., baseline, during and after treatment procedure (p < 0.0001). Conclusion Virtual reality distraction can be considered as a budding distraction tool in the arena of behavior management that helps adapt the child to dental environment and able to deliver qualitative dental care. Clinical significance Managing an anxious child is one of the challenging tasks for a pediatric dentist in the day-to-day life. As the world progresses with newer interventions, virtual reality distraction is one among them that has the ability to reduce pain perception and anxiety in children with a positive approach.

OBJECTIVES: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the relationship between ACI and mortality risk in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines were followed in abstracting data and assessing validity. We searched MEDLINE, Scopus and Web of Science to locate all articles published up to 10 April 2020 reporting data of COVID-19 survivors and nonsurvivors developing ACI as a complication of the infection. Quality assessment was performed using the Newcastle-Ottawa quality assessment scale. Data were pooled using the Mantel-Haenszel random effects models with odds ratio as the effect measure with the related 95% confidence interval. Statistical heterogeneity between groups was measured using the Higgins I statistic. RESULTS: Eight studies, enrolling 1686 patients (mean age 59.5 years), met the inclusion criteria and were included in the final analysis. Data regarding the outcome of patients complicated with ACI were available for 1615 patients. Of these, 387 (23.9%) experienced ACIs as COVID-19 complications during the hospitalization. The incidence of ACI was significantly higher among non survivors when compared with survivors (61.6 vs. 6.7%, Pâ<â0.0001). The pooled analysis confirmed a significantly increased risk of death in COVID-19 patients complicated with ACI during the disease (odds ratio: 21.6, 95% confidence interval: 8.6-54.4, Pâ<â0.0001, Iâ=â82%). CONCLUSION: Development of ACI during COVID-19 significantly increases the risk of death during the infection.","Zuin, Marco; Rigatelli, Gianluca; Zuliani, Giovanni; Bilato, Claudio; Zonzin, Pietro; Roncon, Loris",J Cardiovasc Med (Hagerstown),832,16

To determine the effect of the 2-dose BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccination schedule in individuals who recovered from COVID-19 (COVID-19-recovered subjects) compared with naive subjects, we evaluated SARS-CoV-2 Spike-specific T and B cell responses, as well as specific IgA, IgG, IgM, and neutralizing antibodies titers in 22 individuals who received the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, 11 of whom had a previous history of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Evaluations were performed before vaccination and then weekly until 7 days after second injection. Data obtained clearly showed that one vaccine dose is sufficient to increase both cellular and humoral immune response in COVID-19-recovered subjects without any additional improvement after the second dose. On the contrary, the second dose proved mandatory in naive subjects to further enhance the immune response. These findings were further confirmed at the serological level in a larger cohort of naive (n = 68) and COVID-19-recovered (n = 29) subjects, tested up to 50 days after vaccination. These results question whether a second vaccine injection in COVID-19-recovered subjects is required, and indicate that millions of vaccine doses may be redirected to naive individuals, thus shortening the time to reach herd immunity.","Mazzoni, Alessio; Di Lauria, Nicoletta; Maggi, Laura; Salvati, Lorenzo; Vanni, Anna; Capone, Manuela; Lamacchia, Giulia; Mantengoli, Elisabetta; Spinicci, Michele; Zammarchi, Lorenzo; Kiros, Seble Tekle; Rocca, Arianna; Lagi, Filippo; Colao, Maria Grazia; Parronchi, Paola; Scaletti, Cristina; Turco, Lucia; Liotta, Francesco; Rossolini, Gian Maria; Cosmi, Lorenzo; Bartoloni, Alessandro; Annunziato, Francesco",J. clin. invest,832,16

The purpose of this study is to determine if there is C. acnes present on the incision scalpel in patients undergoing shoulder arthroplasty despite extensive skin preparation techniques to prevent wound contamination. METHODS: The authors collected a consecutive case series of patients meeting inclusion criteria. Patients were included if they underwent either primary or revision shoulder arthroplasty at the tertiary-care hospital with the senior author during the study period. Culture swab samples, testing for presence of C. acnes, were collected from 17 consecutive patients who underwent shoulder arthroplasty with a single, fellowship-trained surgeon between November 2019 and March 2020. Culture reports were recorded as ""positive"" or ""negative"" after 21 days. Institutional Review Board approval of the study protocol was obtained. The null hypothesis was that there would be no cases with knife blades ""culture positive"" for C. acnes. RESULTS: 17 patients were identified and fit inclusion criteria. There were 12 males (mean age 64.3y, range 48y-79y) and 5 females (mean age 69.8y, range 59y-79y). Two patients (11.8%) were found to have C. acnes growth on the skin knife. Both patients were males over the age of 70 undergoing primary reverse shoulder arthroplasty with no history of previous shoulder infections. CONCLUSION: The presence of C. acnes on the skin blade in 2 patients validates concerns that there is C. acnes present in dermal tissue despite extensive attention to eradication of these microbes. There was a high rate of C. acnes contamination on scalpel blades used for initial skin incisions and the authors conclude that there is value in discarding these blades from the surgical field.","Levy, Benjamin J; Grimm, Nathan L; Jimenez, Andrew E; Shea, Kevin P; Mazzocca, Augustus D",J. shoulder elbow surg,832,27

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the temporal and spatial distributions of 3 infected families in a high-rise apartment building and examine the associated environment variables to verify the role of fecal aerosols. DESIGN: Epidemiologic survey and quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analyses on throat swabs from the participants; 237 surface and air samples from 11 of the 83 flats in the building, public areas, and building drainage systems; and tracer gas released into bathrooms as a surrogate for virus-laden aerosols in the drainage system. SETTING: A high-rise apartment building in Guangzhou, China. PARTICIPANTS: 9 infected patients, 193 other residents of the building, and 24 members of the building's management staff. MEASUREMENTS: Locations of infected flats and positive environmental samples, and spread of virus-laden aerosols. RESULTS: 9 infected patients in 3 families were identified. The first family had a history of travel to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epicenter Wuhan, whereas the other 2 families had no travel history and a later onset of symptoms. No evidence was found for transmission via the elevator or elsewhere. The families lived in 3 vertically aligned flats connected by drainage pipes in the master bathrooms. Both the observed infections and the locations of positive environmental samples are consistent with the vertical spread of virus-laden aerosols via these stacks and vents. LIMITATION: Inability to determine whether the water seals were dried out in the flats of the infected families. CONCLUSION: On the basis of circumstantial evidence, fecal aerosol transmission may have caused the community outbreak of COVID-19 in this high-rise building.

METHODS: This controlled cross-sectional study was based on phone interviews of patients discharged from hospital after COVID-19 compared to the control group composed of individuals hospitalized during the same period due to non-COVID-19 causes. Patients were classified as having previous CP based on the ICD-11/IASP criteria, de novo pain (i.e. any new type of pain, irrespective of the pain status before hospital stay), and de novo CP (i.e. persistent or recurring de novo pain, lasting more than 3 months) after COVID-19. We assessed pain prevalence and its characteristics, including headache profile, pain location, intensity, interference, and its relationship with fatigue, and persistent anosmia. Forty-six COVID-19 and 73 control patients were included. Both groups had similar sociodemographic characteristics and past medical history. RESULTS: Length of in-hospital-stay and ICU admission rates were significantly higher amongst COVID-19 survivours, while mechanical ventilation requirement was similar between groups. Pre-hospitalisation pain was lower in COVID-19 compared to control group (10.9% vs. 42.5%; p = 0.001). However, the COVID-19 group had a significantly higher prevalence of de novo pain (65.2% vs. 11.0%, p = 0.001), as well as more de novo headache (39.1%) compared to controls (2.7%, p = 0.001). New-onset CP was 19.6% in COVID-19 patients and 1.4% (p = 0.002) in controls. These differences remained significant (p = 0.001) even after analysing exclusively (COVID: n = 40; controls: n = 34) patients who did not report previous pain before the hospital stay. No statistically significant differences were found for mean new-onset pain intensity and interference with daily activities between both groups. COVID-19 pain was more frequently located in the head/neck and lower limbs (p < 0.05). New-onset fatigue was more common in COVID-19 survivours necessitating inpatient hospital care (66.8%) compared to controls (2.5%, p = 0.001). COVID-19 patients who reported anosmia had more new-onset pain (83.3%) compared to those who did not (48.0%, p = 0.024). CONCLUSION: COVID-19 was associated with a significantly higher prevalence of de novo CP, chronic daily headache, and new-onset pain in general, which was associated with persistent anosmia. SIGNIFICANCE: There exists de novo pain in a substantial number of COVID-19 survivours, and some develop chronic pain. New-onset pain after the infection was more common in patients who reported anosmia after hospital discharge.","Soares, Felipe Henriques Carvalho; Kubota, Gabriel Taricani; Fernandes, Ana Mércia; Hojo, Bruno; Couras, Catarina; Costa, Bárbara Venturoti; Lapa, Jorge Dornellys da Silva; Braga, Luíza Mansur; Almeida, Matheus Merula de; Cunha, Pedro Henrique Martins da; Pereira, Vítor Hugo Honorato; Morais, Adriano Donizeth Silva de; Teixeira, Manoel Jacobsen; Ciampi de Andrade, Daniel",Eur. j. pain (Lond.),832,20

More specifically, it affects people with various risk factors, which are more frequent in patients suffering from psychiatric disorders. Psychiatrists need to know: (i) how to identify, the risks associated with the prescription of psychotropic drugs and which can prove to be counterproductive in their association with COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019), (ii) how to assess in terms of benefit/risk ratio, the implication of any hasty and brutal modification on psychotropic drugs that can induce confusion for a differential diagnosis with the evolution of COVID-19. We carried out a review of the literature aimed at assessing the specific benefit/risk ratio of psychotropic treatments in patients suffering from COVID-19. Clinically, symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 (fever, cough, dyspnea, digestive signs) can be caused by various psychotropic drugs and require vigilance to avoid false negatives and false positives. In infected patients, psychotropic drugs should be used with caution, especially in the elderly, considering the pulmonary risk. Lithium and Clozapine, which are the reference drugs in bipolar disorder and resistant schizophrenia, warrant specific attention. For these two treatments the possibility of a reduction in the dosage - in case of minimal infectious signs and in a situation, which does not allow rapid control - should ideally be considered taking into account the clinical response (even biological; plasma concentrations) observed in the face of previous dose reductions. Tobacco is well identified for its effects as an inducer of CYP1A2 enzyme. In a COVID+ patient, the consequences of an abrupt cessation of smoking, particularly related with the appearance of respiratory symptoms (cough, dyspnea), must therefore be anticipated for patients receiving psychotropics metabolized by CYP1A2. Plasma concentrations of these drugs are expected to decrease and can be related to an increase risk of relapse. The symptomatic treatments used in COVID-19 have frequent interactions with the most used psychotropics. If there is no curative treatment for infection to SARS-CoV-2, the interactions of the various molecules currently tested with several classes of psychotropic drugs (antidepressants, antipsychotics) are important to consider because of the risk of changes in cardiac conduction. Specific knowledge on COVID-19 remains poor today, but we must recommend rigor in this context in the use of psychotropic drugs, to avoid adding, in patients suffering from psychiatric disorders, potentially vulnerable in the epidemic context, an iatrogenic risk or loss of efficiency.","Javelot, H; Llorca, P-M; Drapier, D; Fakra, E; Hingray, C; Meyer, G; Dizet, S; Egron, A; Straczek, C; Roser, M; Masson, M; Gaillard, R; Fossati, P; Haffen, E",Encephale,832,4
