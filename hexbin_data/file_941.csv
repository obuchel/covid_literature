185896,Transmission scenarios for Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and how to tell them apart.,2013,"Today new trends in new media and advertising have revolutionized the whole world. Social media have enabled health sectors to access the potential audience and persuade them effectively. In this regard, coronavirus is currently a prevalent disease as it is disseminated with great speed and a distinct composition in 2020. In addition, many people are still unaware of its severity and lack any relevant information and this is burdening the healthcare system, especially in Jordan. This chapter aims to explore the role of Facebook in health awareness concerning Covid-19 in Jordan. It has adopted the descriptive approach, using a content-analysis form that consists of main categories and sub-topics carefully selected to analyze three Facebook pages for the official Jordanian institutions. These Facebook pages are directly linked to Covid-19, namely: The Prime Ministry, the Ministry of Health, and the Crisis Management Center (CMC). The study analyzed their posts regarding Covid-19 awareness during the period from April 1, 2020 to April 30, 2020. Through the analysis process, six topics were revealed in terms of health awareness: its attractive approach, source of information, factors, size of interaction, and method of presentation and language. The success of using Facebook for Covid-19 awareness requires that other official institutions raise their level of Facebook use in solving different issues, guiding citizens as to how the work is done through it and strengthening the partnership between official institution and citizens through this network. This opens the door to further research that independently addresses awareness topics and analyses of other Facebook pages to reveal more about Covid-19 and to more studies addressing the use of official institutions’ pages by social media to spread awareness of the current health crisis worldwide. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Al-Shakhanbeh, Z.

195290,"Investigation of an imported case of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection in Florence, Italy, May to June 2013.",2013,"To understand the genetic diversity of the S2 gene of infectious bronchitis viruses (IBV) isolated in Japan, we determined the nucleotide sequences of these IBVs using the reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction method coupled with direct sequencing. IBV isolated in Japan were classified into six different groups by phylogenetic analysis based on the S2 gene. However, the classification based on the S2 gene of IBV isolated in Japan was different for some of the strains from those obtained with our previous analysis of the S1 gene. This suggested that genetic recombination between the virus strains classified into different genetic groups had occurred in poultry, and that recombinant viruses might be epidemic in Japan.","Mase, Masaji; Inoue, Toshikazu; Yamaguchi, Shigeo; Imada, Tadao",The Journal of veterinary medical science,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19346695/,941
198259,"Laboratory-confirmed case of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection in Malaysia: preparedness and response, April 2014.",2014,"Sixteen cesarean-derived colostrum-deprived piglets were infected oronasally with CV777 coronavirus on the second or third day of life. Two uninfected piglets were controls. They were killed at 96 and 120 hours after birth. After an incubation period of 22 to 36 hours, all principals showed severe diarrhea. The principals were killed between 12 and 120 hours after infection. Exfoliation of enterocytes were seen first in the piglet killed 24 hours after infection (two hours after the diarrhea began). From that time on, shortening and fusion of villi was present in all small intestinal parts. Affected cells showed vacuolation. The histochemical study showed that infected piglets had decreased activity of all four enzymes studied. The light microscope showed no lesions in the absorptive colonic epithelium. The significance of the lesions in relation to intestinal dysfunction is discussed, and lesions are compared to those of transmissible gastroenteritis and porcine rotavirus infection.","Coussement, W; Ducatelle, R; Debouck, P; Hoorens, J",Veterinary pathology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6280359/,941
