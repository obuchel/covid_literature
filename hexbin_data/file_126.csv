253,253,253,Avian influenza: The tip of the iceberg,16.985165,8.625256,2008,"For some years now, we have been living with the fear of an impending pandemic of avian influenza (AI). Despite the recognition, in 1996, of the global threat posed by the highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza virus found in farmed geese in Guangdong Province, China, planning for the anticipated epidemic remains woefully inadequate; this is especially true in developing countries such as Saudi Arabia. These deficiencies became obvious in 1997, with the outbreak of AI in the live animal markets in Hong Kong that led to the transmission of infection to 18 humans with close contact with diseased birds; there were six reported deaths.[1] In 2003, with the reemergence of H5N1 (considered the most likely AI virus) in the Republic of Korea and its subsequent spread to Thailand, Vietnam, Hong Kong and China. Many countries started aggressively making preparations to meet the threat.[2] The pressure for real action from governments has increased. Most developed countries have requested increased funding for the search for a more effective vaccine, for stockpiling possibly helpful antiviral drugs, and for intensifying domestic and global surveillance.[3] Most countries, however, continue to be inadequately prepared for such an epidemic, especially with regard to animal surveillance in the farm market and surveillance among migratory birds. Even now, most countries do not have the ability to detect disease among humans in the early stages of an outbreak nor do most hospitals comply with effective infection control measures that could curtail the spread of the virus in the early stages of an epidemic. In Saudi Arabia we are rapidly implementing many of these measures.[4]","Balkhy, Hanan",Ann Thorac Med,126,22
4263,4263,4263,Three-year experience with immediate extubation in pediatric patients after congenital cardiac surgery,17.165272,8.636673,2020-01-06,"BACKGROUND: In pediatric cardiac anesthesiology, there is increased focus on minimizing morbidity, ensuring optimal functional status, and using health care resources sparingly. One aspect of care that has potential to affect all of the above is postoperative mechanical ventilation. Historically, postoperative ventilation was considered a must for maintaining patient stability. Ironically, it is recognized that mechanical ventilation may increase risk of adverse outcomes in the postoperative period. Hence, many institutions have advocated for immediate extubation or early extubation after many congenital heart surgeries which was first reported decades ago. METHODS: 637 consecutive patient charts were reviewed for pediatric patients undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass. Patients were placed into three groups. Those that were extubated in the operating room (OR) at the conclusion of surgery (Immediate Extubation or IE), those that were extubated within six hours of admission to the ICU (Early Extubation or EE) and those that were extubated sometime after six hours (Delayed Extubation or DE). Multiple variables were then recorded to see which factors correlated with successful Immediate or Early Extubation. RESULTS: Overall, 338 patients (53.1%) had IE), 273 (42.8%) had DE while only 26 patients (4.1%) had EE. The median age was 1174 days for the IE patients, 39 days for the DE patients, whereas 194 days for EE patients (p < 0.001). Weight and length were also significantly different in at least one extubation group from the other two (p < 0.001). The median ICU LOS was 3 and 4 days for IE and EE patients respectively, whereas it was 9.5 days for DE patients (p < 0.001). DE group had a significant longer median anesthesia time and cardiopulmonary bypass time than the other two extubation groups (p > 63,826.88 < 0.001). Regional low flow perfusion, deep hypothermia, deep hypothermic circulatory arrest, redo sternotomy, use of other sedatives, furosemide, epinephrine, vasopressin, open chest, cardiopulmonary support, pulmonary edema, syndrome, as well as difficult intubation were significantly associated with delayed extubation (IE, EE or DE). CONCLUSIONS: Immediate and early extubation was significantly associated with several factors, including patient age and size, duration of CPB, use of certain anesthetic drugs, and the amount of blood loss and blood replacement. IE can be successfully accomplished in a majority of pediatric patients undergoing surgery for congenital heart disease, including in a minority of infants.","Tirotta, Christopher F.; Alcos, Stephen; Lagueruela, Richard G.; Salyakina, Daria; Wang, Weize; Hughes, Jessica; Irizarry, Marysory; Burke, Redmond P.",J Cardiothorac Surg,126,31

10964,10964,10964,The Utility of Diaphragm Ultrasound in Reducing Time to Extubation,16.744225,8.5738,2020-04-13,"BACKGROUND: Patient-related risk factors for the development of postoperative pulmonary complications (PPCs) include age ≥ 60-years, congestive heart failure, hypoalbuminemia and smoking. The effect of obesity is unclear and has not been shown to independently increase the likelihood of PPCs in trauma patients undergoing trauma laparotomy. We hypothesized the likelihood of mortality and PPCs would increase as body mass index (BMI) increases in trauma patients undergoing trauma laparotomy. METHODS: The Trauma Quality Improvement Program (2010–2016) was queried to identify trauma patients ≥ 18-years-old undergoing trauma laparotomy within 6-h of presentation. A multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to determine the likelihood of PPCs and mortality when stratified by BMI. RESULTS: From 8,330 patients, 2,810 (33.7%) were overweight (25–29.9 kg/m(2)), 1444 (17.3%) obese (30–34.9 kg/m(2)), 580 (7.0%) severely obese (35–39.9 kg/m(2)), and 401 (4.8%) morbidly obese (≥ 40 kg/m(2)). After adjusting for covariates including age, injury severity score, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, smoking, and rib/lung injury, the likelihood of PPCs increased with increasing BMI: overweight (OR = 1.37, CI 1.07–1.74, p = 0.012), obese (OR = 1.44, CI 1.08–1.92, p = 0.014), severely obese (OR = 2.20, CI 1.55–3.14, p < 0.001), morbidly obese (OR = 2.42, CI 1.67–3.51, p < 0.001), compared to those with normal BMI. In addition, the adjusted likelihood of mortality increased for the morbidly obese (OR = 2.60, CI 1.78–3.80, p < 0.001) compared to those with normal BMI. CONCLUSION: Obese trauma patients undergoing emergent trauma laparotomy have a high likelihood for both PPCs and mortality, with morbidly obese trauma patients having the highest likelihood for both. This suggests obesity should be accounted for in risk prediction models of trauma patients undergoing laparotomy.

STUDY DESIGN: Surveys were developed and administered to neonatologists and eligible families. Quantitative analysis was conducted using standard statistical methods. Qualitative analysis was conducted using NVivo software. Focus groups were conducted with the same groups, and audio recordings were obtained and analyzed for recurring themes. RESULTS: Both parents and physicians value QOL as a metric for guiding care in the NICU. Parents were more likely to accept higher levels of disability, while neonatologists were more likely to accept higher levels of dependence on medical equipment. In relation to infant QOL, predominant themes expressed in the parent focus groups were stress levels in the NICU, advocating as parents, and the way in which long-term outcomes were presented by the medical team; in the physician focus group, the ambiguity of predicting outcomes and thus QOL was the main theme. CONCLUSIONS: Both parents and physicians recognize the importance of QOL in the decision-making process for critically ill infants, but the two groups differ in their assessment of what QOL means in this context. These data suggest that QOL cannot be adequately defined for standardized use in a clinical context, and as such, should be used thoughtfully by neonatologists in discussions of end- of-life care.","Adams, Shannon Y.; Tucker, Richard; Clark, Melissa A.; Lechner, Beatrice E.",J Perinatol,126,1

Many viruses encode proteins that interfere with host innate immune recognition in order to promote infection. STAT2 is divergent between species and therefore has a role in species restriction of some viruses. To understand the role of STAT2 in human metapneumovirus (HMPV) infection of human and murine tissues, we first infected STAT2(−/−) mice and found that HMPV could be serially passaged in STAT2(−/−), but not WT, mice. We then used in vitro methods to show that HMPV inhibits expression of both STAT1 and STAT2 in human and primate cells, but not in mouse cells. Transfection of the murine form of STAT2 into STAT2-deficient human cells conferred resistance to STAT2 inhibition. Finally, we sought to understand the in vivo role of STAT2 by infecting hSTAT2 knock-in mice with HMPV, and found that mice had increased weight loss, inhibition of type I interferon signaling, and a Th2-polarized cytokine profile compared to WT mice. These results indicate that STAT2 is a target of HMPV in human infection, while the murine version of STAT2 restricts tropism of HMPV for murine cells and tissue.","Rogers, Meredith C.; Miranda-Katz, Margot; Zhang, Yu; Oury, Tim D.; Uccellini, Melissa B.; García-Sastre, Adolfo; Williams, John V.",Viruses,126,1

Women with epilepsy, MG, and MS were recruited consecutively at the time of their follow-up visits at a neurology clinic. Data were collected using 3 standardized questionnaires, and presented using descriptive statistics. A logistic regression was performed to determine variables associated with decisions regarding abstaining from pregnancy and encouraging other women to conceive. A total of 272 (83 epilepsy, 69 MG, and 120 MS) women with a mean age of 29.9 ± 8.0 years participated. The proportion of women who abstained from or postponed pregnancy was 41.2% and 31.4%, respectively. The concerns mentioned most often were disease worsening during pregnancy, peripartum and postpartum, side effects of medications on the unborn child, and inability to care for the child. Older age was independently associated with the decision to abstain from pregnancy (odds ratio [OR] 1.14, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.04 - 1.25). Higher knowledge levels were independently associated with encouraging other women to have children (OR 1.3, 95% CI 1.11–1.53). Over 50% of women reported that they were not counseled on issues related to pregnancy and childbirth. In conclusion, we identified a major influence of epilepsy, MG, and MS on pregnancy and family planning. Comprehensive counseling programs are needed to help women with these neurological diseases make informed family-planning decisions.","Alanazy, Mohammed H.; Asiri, Alanood; Edrees, Maha F.; Abuzinadah, Ahmad R.",Medicine (Baltimore),126,19

Setting programmatic targets, particularly in generalised epidemics, could incorporate estimates of the size of the population likely to be eligible for PrEP using incidence-based thresholds. We estimated the proportion of men and women who would be eligible for PrEP and the number of HIV infections that could be averted in Malawi, Mozambique, and Zambia using prioritisation based on age, sex, geography, and markers of risk. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We analysed the latest nationally representative Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) of Malawi, Mozambique, and Zambia to determine the proportion of adults who report behavioural markers of risk for HIV infection. We used prevalence ratios (PRs) to quantify the association of these factors with HIV status. Using a multiplier method, we combined these proportions with the number of new HIV infections by district, derived from district-level modelled HIV estimates. Based on these numbers, different scenarios were analysed for the minimum number of person-years on PrEP needed to prevent 1 HIV infection (NNP). An estimated total of 38,000, 108,000, and 46,000 new infections occurred in Malawi, Mozambique, and Zambia in 2016, corresponding with incidence rates of 0.43, 0.63, and 0.57 per 100 person-years. In these countries, 9%–20% of new infections occurred among people with a sexually transmitted infection (STI) in the past 12 months and 40%–42% among people with either an STI or a non-regular sexual partner (NP) in the past 12 months (STINP). The models estimate that around 50% of new infections occurred in districts with incidence rates ≥1.0% in Mozambique and Zambia and ≥0.5% in Malawi. In Malawi, Mozambique, and Zambia, 35.1%, 21.9%, and 12.5% of the population live in these high-incidence districts. In the most parsimonious scenario, if women aged 15–34 years and men 20–34 years with an STI in the past 12 months living in high-incidence districts were to take PrEP, it would take a minimum of 65.8 person-years on PrEP to avert 1 HIV infection per year in Malawi, 35.2 in Mozambique, and 16.4 in Zambia. Our findings suggest that 3,300, 5,200, and 1,700 new infections could be averted per year in the 3 countries, respectively. Limitations of our study are that these values are based on modelled estimates of HIV incidence and self-reported behavioural risk factors from national surveys. CONCLUSIONS: A large proportion of new HIV infections in these 3 African countries were estimated to occur among people who had either an STI or an NP in the past year, providing a straightforward means to set PrEP targets. Greater prioritisation of PrEP by district, sex, age, and behavioural risk factors resulted in lower NNPs thereby increasing PrEP cost-effectiveness, but also diminished the overall impact on reducing new infections","Stelzle, Dominik; Godfrey-Faussett, Peter; Jia, Chuan; Amiesimaka, Obreniokibo; Mahy, Mary; Castor, Delivette; Hodges-Mameletzis, Ioannis; Chitembo, Lastone; Baggaley, Rachel; Dalal, Shona",PLoS Med,126,1

The present study was grounded in theories of coping and psychological adjustment, and a dual process model was formulated to address some resolved issues regarding socioeconomic disparities in health. For a robust test of the proposed dual process model, data were collected from two Asian countries—Hong Kong and Indonesia—with different socioeconomic heritage and conditions. Consistent with the predictions of our model, the present findings revealed that coping flexibility was a psychological mechanism underlying the positive association between social capital and health for the lower SES group, whereas active coping was a psychological mechanism underlying this positive association for the higher SES group. These patterns of results were largely replicable in both Asian samples, providing robust empirical support for the proposed dual process model.","Cheng, Cecilia; Cheng, Fanny; Atal, Saloni; Sarwono, Sarlito",Int J Environ Res Public Health,126,22

RESULTS: In the present study, an attempt was made to elucidate the vaccine candidates/diagnostic molecules against botulism using immuno proteomic approach. C. botulinum type B secretome was elucidated when it was grown in TPGY as well as CMM media. Predominant 51 proteins were identified in both the media using 2-DE and mass spectrometry analysis. 2D gels (CMM & TPGY) were probed with respected proteins mice antiserum and obtained 17 and 10 immunogenic proteins in TPGY as well as CMM media respectively. Hypothetical protein CLOSPO_00563, ornithine carbamoyl transferase, FlaA, molecular chaperone GroEL and secreted protease proteins were found as the common immuno dominant proteins in both media. Polyclonal Antibodies raised against C. botulinum types A and E showed cross-reactivity with secretome C. botulinum type B at the lowest dilution (1:1000) but did not show cross reactivity with highest dilution (1:30,000) with C. botulinum type B secretome. Polyclonal antibodies against C. botulinum type F secretome did not show cross reactivity with C. botulinum type B secretome.

METHODS: A scoping review was performed studying published reviews after 2008, focusing on outcome of CPR in patients aged ≥ 70 years following IHCA and OHCA. In addition, 11 (IHCA) and 19 (OHCA) eligible studies published after the 2 included reviews were analyzed regarding: return of spontaneous circulation, survival until hospital discharge, long-term survival, neurological outcome, discharge location or other measurements for quality of life (QoL). RESULTS: The survival until hospital discharge ranged between 11.6 and 28.5% for IHCA and 0–11.1% for OHCA, and declined with increasing age. The same trend was seen regarding 1-year survival rates with 5.7–25.0% and 0–10% following IHCA and OHCA, respectively. A good neurological outcome defined as a Cerebral Performance Category (CPC) 1–2 was found in 11.5–23.6% (IHCA) and up to 10.5% (OHCA) of all patients. However, the proportion of CPC 1–2 among patients surviving until hospital discharge was 82–93% (IHCA) and 77–91.6% (OHCA). Few studies included other QoL measures as an outcome variable. Other risk factors aside from age were identified, including nursing home residency, comorbidity, non-shockable rhythm, non-witnessed arrest. The level of frailty was not studied as a predictor of arrest outcome in the included studies. CONCLUSIONS: Hospital survival rates following IHCA and OHCA in the older population improved in the recent decade, though do not exceed 28.5% and 11.1%, respectively. The effect of age on outcome remains controversial and age should not be used as the sole decision criterium whether to initiate CPR. Future research should study frailty and resilience as an independent predictor regardless of age, and add broader, extensive QoL measures as outcome variables.

Until now, nineteen genotypes have been identified. The lack of proofreading property of viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) together with recombination among the intra- and inter-genotypes of the virus results in high diversity. However, data specific to the molecular evolutionary perspective of the complete genome of HPeV remains limited. This study aimed to analyze the phylogenetic, molecular evolution, and recombination characteristics of the complete genome of HPeV strains isolated in Thailand during 2009–2012. Fifty-eight samples that were previously confirmed to be HPeV positive and then evaluated for genotyping were subjected to complete genome amplification to generate ten overlapping PCR fragments using a set of in-house designed primers. The same position of the viral genome was read in triplicate using direct Sanger sequencing. All samples were classified into the same previously defined genotypes in both whole-genome and VP1 phylogenic tree. However, sample B1091/HPeV14/2011 exhibited discordant grouping between whole-genome and VP1 on the phylogenetic tree. Bootscan analysis revealed that B1091/HPeV14/2011 inherited from two genotypic viruses, including VP1 from HPeV14, and the rest of the genome from HPeV1B.

STUDY DESIGN: Clinical data from 106 infants 23–28 weeks gestation who received PND for weaning from MV during 2011–2017 were evaluated. PND was started at a dose of 0.1 mg/kg/d tapered over 5–7 d. Treatment success was defined as extubated and free from MV on d14 after start of treatment. RESULT: Treatment was successful in 83 (78%) infants. Demographics and age of treatment did not differ between groups. In the failure group, a higher proportion were on HFOV and FiO(2) ≥ 0.50 before treatment, compared to the successful group. CONCLUSION: In most infants, PND resulted in successful weaning from MV. Reduced need for oxygen in infants not extubated may be beneficial, but it is unknown if this offsets the risks. The long-term effects PND in ventilator dependent infants need to be evaluated.","Kurtom, Waleed; Schmidt, Augusto; Jain, Deepak; Vanbuskirk, Silvia; Schott, Alini; Bancalari, Eduardo; Claure, Nelson",J Perinatol,126,1

Unlike traditional medical imaging, our unconstrained setup with accessible handheld digital cameras, along with the unstructured open surgery scene, makes this task uniquely challenging. We investigate one common procedure, thyroidectomy, during which surgeons must avoid damaging the recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN), which is responsible for human speech. We evaluate our segmentation algorithm on a diverse dataset across varied and challenging settings of operating room image capture, and show strong segmentation performance in the optimal image capture condition.

Patients suffer from debilitating headaches, pulsatile tinnitus, nausea, vomiting, photophobia and radicular pain. At this rate, treatment cost will increase to 462.7 million pounds sterling annually by 2030. Weight loss is the only proven disease-modifying therapy for reversal of idiopathic intracranial hypertension. Bariatric surgery leads to superlative weight loss and reversal of related comorbidities. The case series and literature review aim to raise awareness of bariatric surgery as a safe and effective treatment modality for idiopathic intracranial hypertension. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The literature review comprises three systematic analysis and one randomised control trial which were identified after a PubMed search. In the case series, we have included four patients with a preoperative diagnosis of long-standing idiopathic intracranial hypertension. They were referred to our department for bariatric surgery by the neuro-ophthalmologist between January and December 2018. They were followed up for 2 years after bariatric surgery. RESULTS: All four patients were women with a mean age of 34 years. Mean body mass index reduced from 47.3 kg/m(2) before surgery to 30 kg/m(2) at the end of 2 years after surgery. They showed significant improvement or resolution in their symptoms related to idiopathic intracranial hypertension, and none of them required further cerebrospinal fluid pressure reducing procedures. CONCLUSION: Bariatric surgery is a safe and effective method of treating idiopathic intracranial hypertension. It is superior compared to medical management and cerebrospinal fluid pressure reducing procedures which have high rates of recurrence.","Mahendran, Vimaladhithan; Ricart, Pol; Levine, Fridi; White, Emma; Abolghasemi-Malekabadi, Karen; Williams, Madeleine; Wadley, Martin S; Perry, Anthony; Robinson, Steven John",Obes Surg,126,33
19592,19592,19592,Clinical analysis of redo aortic root replacement after cardiac surgery: a retrospective study,16.696508,8.537643,2021-07-28,"BACKGROUND: Guidelines recommend evaluation for electrographic seizures in neonates and children at risk, including after cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Although initial research using screening electroencephalograms (EEGs) in infants after CPB found a 21% seizure incidence, more recent work reports seizure incidences ranging 3–12%. Deep hypothermic cardiac arrest was associated with increased seizure risk in prior reports but is uncommon at our institution and less widely used in contemporary practice. This study seeks to establish the incidence of seizures among infants following CPB in the absence of deep hypothermic cardiac arrest and to identify additional risk factors for seizures via a prediction model. METHODS: A retrospective chart review was completed of all consecutive infants ≤ 3 months who received screening EEG following CPB at a single center within a 2-year period during 2017–2019. Clinical and laboratory data were collected from the perioperative period. A prediction model for seizure risk was fit using a random forest algorithm, and receiver operator characteristics were assessed to classify predictions. Fisher’s exact test and the logrank test were used to evaluate associations between clinical outcomes and EEG seizures. RESULTS: A total of 112 infants were included. Seizure incidence was 10.7%. Median time to first seizure was 28.1 h (interquartile range 18.9–32.2 h). The most important factors in predicting seizure risk from the random forest analysis included postoperative neuromuscular blockade, prematurity, delayed sternal closure, bypass time, and critical illness preoperatively. When variables captured during the EEG recording were included, abnormal postoperative neuroimaging and peak lactate were also highly predictive. Overall model accuracy was 90.2%; accounting for class imbalance, the model had excellent sensitivity and specificity (1.00 and 0.89, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Seizure incidence was similar to recent estimates even in the absence of deep hypothermic cardiac arrest. By employing random forest analysis, we were able to identify novel risk factors for postoperative seizure in this population and generate a robust model of seizure risk. Further work to validate our model in an external population is needed.

On that day the dentist William T. G. Morton successfully gave the first public ether anesthesia in Boston. From then on it was possible to save people from pain with justifiable risk and at the same time to protect them from psychological damage by inducing unconsciousness. The German philosopher Peter Sloterdijk, one of the most renowned and effective philosophers of our times, deduced that from then on humans, to some extent, had a right to unconsciousness when in psychophysical distress. This postulate unfolded from his concept of “anthropotechnics” developed around 1997, meaning the idea of treating human nature as an object of possible improvements. According to Sloterdijk, in favorable cases a synthesis of man and technology can result in a significant improvement of human capabilities in the sense of “enhancement”, i.e. an increase, an improvement or even an expansion of intellectual, physical or psychological possibilities, as it were in a transgression of the human (so-called transhumanism). Man should go into vertical tension, i.e. strive for higher aims and exploit his inherent potential, he should not dwell in the horizontal. This is not meant as an appeal but as an imperative: “You must change your life!”. In this context modern anesthesia may prove helpful: be operated on by others in order to undergo an enhancement. Or, in its most extreme form, the operation in the “auto-operational curved space”, a person can even operate on himself as has been dramatically demonstrated by Rogozov, a young Russian physician and trainee surgeon who successfully performed a self-appendectomy under local anesthesia at the Novolazarevskaya Antarctic Station in 1961; however, the implementation of this idea is a long way off. On the one hand, many countries lack qualified personnel in sufficiently large numbers to perform even vital operations with patients under anesthesia. On the other hand, over the decades it has become clear that anesthesia is obviously beneficial for mankind in that it offers relief from pain and psychological stress but that it can also often show its dark side: substance abuse, use of anesthetics in torture and in executions. In addition, the role of anesthetics in resuscitation, palliative care, and allaying executions is unclear or controversial. Finally, the necessary formal legal steps to acknowledge a “human right to unconsciousness” have not yet been implemented.","Lewandowski, K.; Kretschmer, B.; Schmidt, K. W.",Anaesthesist,126,16

Prominent among these needs are high rates of co-occurring psychiatric conditions that contribute to increased functional impairments and often necessitate mental health services. Executive functioning deficits are associated with ASD as well as common co-occurring conditions (e.g., attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder) and an evidence-based intervention has been developed and tested to address executive functioning within the school context. There is an urgent need to implement indicated evidence-based interventions for youth with ASD receiving care in community mental health settings. Interventions that optimally “fit” the mental health services context as well as the complex and co-occurring mental health needs of these youth have the potential to improve key clinical outcomes for this high priority population. METHODS: This mixed-methods developmental study will apply the Exploration, Preparation, Implementation, Sustainment implementation framework and a community-academic partnership approach to systematically adapt and test an evidence-based executive functioning intervention for youth with ASD for delivery in community mental health settings. Specific aims are to (1) conduct a need and context assessment to inform the systematic adaptation an executive functioning evidence-based intervention; (2) systematically adapt the clinical intervention and develop a corresponding implementation plan, together entitled “Executive Functioning for Enhancing Community-based Treatment for ASD,” (EFFECT for ASD); and (3) conduct a feasibility pilot test of EFFECT for ASD in community mental health settings. DISCUSSION: Tailoring evidence-based interventions for delivery in community-based mental health services for youth with ASD has the potential to increase quality of care and improve child outcomes. Results from the current study will serve as the foundation for large-scale hybrid implementation and effectiveness trials and a generalizable approach for different service systems of care and clinical populations.

And Danshen class injections are commonly used in the treatment of acute coronary syndrome in China. Thus, the Bayesian network meta-analysis was devised to investigate the efficacy of different Danshen class injections against acute coronary syndrome. METHODS: Eligible inclusion and exclusion criteria were established in advance. Then, a systematic literature search was performed in several databases from inception to February 2020. Further, the included randomized controlled trials data were adopted to calculation, prepare graphs and multidimensional cluster analysis by WinBUGS 1.4.3, Stata V.13.0 and R 3.6.1 software, respectively. RESULTS: A total of 53 eligible randomized controlled trial studies with 6401 patients were obtained that evaluated the clinical effectiveness rate, the level of hypersensitive C-reactive protein, C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, fibrinogen, and adverse reactions after the application of Danshen class injections plus western medicine. Compared with western medicine alone, Danshen class injections combined with western medicine therapy were associated with significantly improved the therapeutic effect. In addition, the results of the multidimensional cluster analysis demonstrated that Danhong injection + western medicine and Danshen injection + western medicine had better therapeutic effects. However, since most eligible randomized controlled trial studies did not focus on the monitoring of adverse reactions, the safety of these Chinese herbal injections needs to be further explored. CONCLUSION: Based on this Bayesian network meta-analysis results, Danhong injection + western medicine and Danshen injection + western medicine might have a better impact on acute coronary syndrome patients. Nevertheless, more large samples, high-quality clinical and multicenter randomized controlled trial studies should be tested and verified in the future.","Guo, Siyu; Wu, Jiarui; Ni, Mengwei; Jia, Shanshan; Zhang, Jingyuan; Zhou, Wei; Liu, Xinkui; Wang, Miaomiao; Zhang, Xiaomeng",Front Pharmacol,126,1

The current diagnostic procedure of COVID-19 follows reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) based approach which however is less sensitive to identify the virus at the initial stage. Hence, a more robust and alternate diagnosis technique is desirable. Recently, with the release of publicly available datasets of corona positive patients comprising of computed tomography (CT) and chest X-ray (CXR) imaging; scientists, researchers and healthcare experts are contributing for faster and automated diagnosis of COVID-19 by identifying pulmonary infections using deep learning approaches to achieve better cure and treatment. These datasets have limited samples concerned with the positive COVID-19 cases, which raise the challenge for unbiased learning. Following from this context, this article presents the random oversampling and weighted class loss function approach for unbiased fine-tuned learning (transfer learning) in various state-of-the-art deep learning approaches such as baseline ResNet, Inception-v3, Inception ResNet-v2, DenseNet169, and NASNetLarge to perform binary classification (as normal and COVID-19 cases) and also multi-class classification (as COVID-19, pneumonia, and normal case) of posteroanterior CXR images. Accuracy, precision, recall, loss, and area under the curve (AUC) are utilized to evaluate the performance of the models. Considering the experimental results, the performance of each model is scenario dependent; however, NASNetLarge displayed better scores in contrast to other architectures, which is further compared with other recently proposed approaches. This article also added the visual explanation to illustrate the basis of model classification and perception of COVID-19 in CXR images.","Punn, Narinder Singh; Agarwal, Sonali",Appl Intell,126,26

Evidence suggests that patients with HSD/hEDS who experience knee and back complaints improve with exercise-based therapy. However, no study has focused on exercise-based treatment for the shoulder in this patient group. The potential benefits of strengthening the shoulder muscles, such as increased muscle-tendon stiffness, may be effective for patients with HSD/hEDS who often display decreased strength and increased shoulder laxity/instability. The primary aim is to investigate the short-term effectiveness of a 16-week progressive heavy shoulder strengthening programme and general advice (HEAVY) compared with low-load training and general advice (LIGHT), on self-reported shoulder symptoms, function, and quality of life. METHODS: A superiority, parallel group, randomised controlled trial will be conducted with 100 patients from primary care with HSD/hEDS and shoulder complaints (persistent pain and/or instability) for more than 3 months. Participants will be randomised to receive HEAVY (full range of motion, high load) or LIGHT (neutral to midrange of motion, low load) strengthening programme three times weekly with exercises targeting scapular and rotator cuff muscles. HEAVY will be supervised twice weekly, and LIGHT three times during the 16 weeks. The primary outcome will be between-group difference in change from baseline to 16-week follow-up in the Western Ontario Shoulder Instability Index (WOSI, 0-2100 better to worse). Secondary outcomes will include a range of self-reported outcomes covering symptoms, function, and quality of life, besides clinical tests for shoulder strength, laxity/instability, and proprioception. Outcome assessors will be blinded to group allocation. Participants will be kept blind to treatment allocation through minimal information about the intervention content and hypotheses. Primary analyses will be performed by a blinded epidemiologist. DISCUSSION: If effective, the current heavy shoulder strengthening programme will challenge the general understanding of prescribing low-load exercise interventions for patients with HSD/hEDS and provide a new treatment strategy. The study will address an important and severe condition using transparent, detailed, and high-quality methods to potentially support a future implementation.

Pancytopenia with reticulocytopenia was the predominant feature in the initial laboratory investigations, pointing to aplastic anemia. Chest computed tomography surprisingly showed typical findings suggestive of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Infection was later confirmed by positive real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assay (RT-PCR) for SARS-CoV-2. CONCLUSIONS: Infants with COVID-19 can have non-specific manifestations and a high index of suspicion should be kept in mind especially in regions with a high incidence of the disease.

This presented clinicians with a new challenge in risk stratification of patients with dyspnoea due to suspected COVID19. This review searched existing literature to identify existing modalities to remotely assess patients with acute respiratory distress, which can be adapted for the COVID-19 pandemic and in future similar situations. METHODS: We conducted a systematic search of Medline, Embase and Medrxiv for studies of the remote assessment of dyspnoea in acute respiratory disorders in adults/children. The study was registered on PROSPERO (ID: CRD42020202292): 3014 abstracts were screened independently by two reviewers and 32 studies were progressed to full text screening. RESULTS: Five studies were selected for review, including 1317 patients. Two studies assessed video consultation, two assessed telephone related triage tools, and one study assessed an online triage tool for dyspnoea. In one study, video consultation was found to have 83% sensitivity for diagnosing ‘severe’ respiratory distress in comparison to face-to-face assessment. The online triage tool was found to have 87.5% sensitivity for detecting dyspnoea requiring emergency level care. CONCLUSION: A range of successful remote risk stratification tools and clinical features were identified for assessing dyspnoea severity which can be adapted to COVID-19 and future pandemics to assess respiratory distress via telemedicine. These findings will influence development of comprehensive evidence-based tools to assess dyspnoea which will reduce resource strain during current/future pandemics.

This topic is becoming increasingly relevant as the number of issued prescriptions in Slovenia is rising every year, treatment with prescription medicine is experienced by almost everyone. Medicine packaging must therefore provide essential information effectively and efficiently. AIM: The purpose of this thesis is to improve current heterogeneous conditions by developing a standardized design system for all prescription drugs by taking into account users’ needs at each stage of the process. The final goal is a simpler and more effective use of products for everyone involved. METHODS: Research was conducted in three stages. In the first stage, the existing condition in packaging design was analysed: information hierarchy/arrangement on 8 significant manufacturers’ products considering 1 - the type of information and 2 - different user groups. Second stage consisted of conducting surveys with 2 focus groups representing two main user groups who use the packaging differently - medicine consumers and healthcare professionals.(1) Consumer focus group consisted of 81 participants, recruited randomly from various age groups (age 10 to 89). They were asked closed-ended questions. Healthcare professionals focus group consisted of 5 pharmacists with extensive experience. They were asked open-ended questions. The collected data from both research stages was statistically and qualitatively analysed in order to define the main problems with medicine packaging design and use. Identified problems were then addressed through the design process. The third stage included development of a standardised design system in accordance with information design theory and cognitive psychology findings.(2) These helped establish the system building blocks/rules: information hierarchy and organization, use of colour, shape and typography. RESULTS: Analysis of existing conditions clearly exposed the heterogeneity and unsuitability of the majority of medicine packaging design. These caused similar problems to both user groups: trouble finding information (73 %), lack/redundancy of information (47 %/17 %), illegible, unreadable typography (39 %), distracting visual elements (26 %), unclear distinction between medicines (17 %). These lead to various consequences: incorrect route of administration (39 %), consuming/prescribing expired (30 %) or incorrect product (8 %), time loss (8 %). Each of these problems was addressed through establishment of new, highly precise rules in packaging design: regulating hierarchy and typography, introducing visual categorization through symbols and illustrations (information category, pharmaceutical form, ATC group) and color-coding medicine strength. The rules form a standardised system which provides unity, consistency and quality regulation, improving the everyday experience of many people. CONCLUSION: The research was carried out as a part of a BA thesis. The execution of the project would require a change in the legislation on state level. It therefore serves as a speculative proposal, aiming to raise questions that are currently not being addressed properly within the industry. The possibility of implementation could be recognized through gradual transformation of individual rules/building blocks of the system into new state regulations or guidelines. Discussion with the industry and the profession has not yet been carried out due to the Covid-19 crisis. REFERENCES: 1. Heinio RL, RUSKO E, Van der Waarde K.

There is an urgent need to investigate university students’ experience and perceptions of online learning during the pandemic so as to optimize online learning strategies in tertiary education during and after the pandemic. Based on self-determination theory and the social cognitive perspective, the present study investigated the relationship between perceived relatedness with instructors and classmates, online self-regulated learning (OSRL), perceived learning gains, and satisfaction of 572 Chinese undergraduate students. Through structural equation modeling (SEM) and bootstrapping, we found: (1) relatedness was positively associated with OSRL; (2) relatedness had no direct effect on either perceived learning gains or satisfaction; (3) OSRL has a full mediating effect on the relationship between relatedness and perceived learning gains; (4) there was a serial mediating effect of OSRL and perceived learning gains on the relationship between relatedness and satisfaction; and (5) task strategies and goal setting contributed most to OSRL’s mediating effects. Our work provides university instructors, online course designers, and online platform providers with new insights into the importance of supporting undergraduate students’ OSRL (particularly task strategies and goal setting) via developing social connections for improving their perceived learning gains and satisfaction in online learning environments.","Zhou, Xiaohua; Chai, Ching Sing; Jong, Morris Siu-Yung; Xiong, Xi Bei",Asia-Pacific Edu Res,126,1

Despite an update of aPL in 2006, several patients had typical clinical events without the classical biological criteria. The aim of our study was to evaluate the hypercoagulability state with both thrombin generation (TG) profiles and activated protein C resistance (aPCR) in different types of APS. Methods: We retrospectively included 41 patients with Sydney criteria classification (tAPS, oAPS) and no clinical manifestation of APS with persistent aPL (biological APS). A thrombin generation assay was performed with a Fluoroskan Ascent fluorometer in platelet-poor plasma (PPP). Activated protein C resistance was measured as a ratio: ETP(+aPC)/ETP(-aPC) × 100. Results: Thrombotic APS and oAPS had an increase of global thrombin generation (ETP(control) = 808 nM.min (756–853) vs. 1265 nM.min (956–1741) and 1863 nM.min (1434–2080), respectively) (Peak(control) = 78 nM (74–86) vs. 153 nM (109–215) and 254 nM.min (232–289), respectively). Biological APS had only a lag time increase (T(control) = 4.89 ± 1.65 min vs. 13.6 ± 3.9 min). An increased aPCR was observed in tAPS (52.7 ± 16.4%), oAPS (64.1 ± 14.6%) as compared to the control group (27.2 ± 13.8%). Conclusion: Our data suggest an increase of thrombin generation in thrombotic and obstetrical APS and no hypercoagulable states in patients with biological APS. The study of a prospective and a larger controlled cohort could determine the TGA useful for APS monitoring and could confirm an aPCR evaluation in PPP.","Billoir, Paul; Miranda, Sébastien; Levesque, Herve; Benhamou, Ygal; Le Cam Duchez, Véronique",J Clin Med,126,20

Emerging virtual reality and augmented reality can allow people to interact with products and places where products are produced even from very distant places, with a positive impact on their purchase intentions. Applying the theory of planned behaviour, this study focuses on the Parmigiano Reggiano cheese, one of the most exported Italian foods. A sample of consumers was surveyed online to explore the role of virtually visiting the food production place on consumers’ intention to physically visit the production place and on their intention to buy the food. The empirical results deriving from a structural equation model developed on 399 completed and valid questionnaires indicate that the opportunity to experience products through virtual tours positively influences consumer behaviours. Young males show the highest intention to physically visit the food production place and to buy the cheese. Findings provide new insights for the emerging literature on the use of virtual reality to experience products through virtual interaction and the impact that interactive technologies have on consumer purchase intentions. Local areas can use virtual tours to improve food tourism and stimulate food product sales. To our knowledge, this paper represents one of the first empirical endeavours aimed at exploring the impact of virtual tours on consumers’ buying and visiting intentions when a food product and a dairy are concerned.","De Canio, F.; Martinelli, E.; Peruzzini, M.; Marchi, G.",Ital,126,17

Fundc1 levels and mitophagy were significantly reduced in LPS-stimulated H9C2 cardiomyocytes but were significantly increased by irisin treatment. Irisin significantly increased ATP production and the activities of mitochondrial complexes I and III in the LPS-stimulated cardiomyocytes. Irisin also improved glucose metabolism and significantly reduced LPS-induced levels of reactive oxygen species by increasing the activities of antioxidant enzymes, glutathione peroxidase (GPX), and superoxide dismutase (SOD), as well as levels of reduced glutathione (GSH). TUNEL assays showed that irisin significantly reduced LPS-stimulated cardiomyocyte apoptosis by suppressing the activation of caspase-3 and caspase-9. However, the beneficial effects of irisin on oxidative stress, mitochondrial metabolism, and viability of LPS-stimulated H9C2 cardiomyocytes were abolished by silencing Fundc1. These results demonstrate that irisin abrogates mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and apoptosis through Fundc1-related mitophagy in LPS-stimulated H9C2 cardiomyocytes. This suggests irisin is a potentially useful treatment for septic cardiomyopathy, though further investigations are necessary to confirm our findings.","Jiang, Xiaoqing; Cai, Shumin; Jin, Yinghui; Wu, Feng; He, Jing; Wu, Xixuan; Tan, Ying; Wang, Yu",Oxid Med Cell Longev,126,1

SUMMARY ANSWER: E3G testing provides an alternative to serum E2 assessment and a new “patient friendly” approach for COH monitoring. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: In many IVF clinics basic monitoring tools for controlled ovarian stimulation during IVF procedure are ultrasound measurements of follicle growth and hormone assessment of serum E2 levels. The monitoring can occur 4–6 times during stimulation, but repeated blood sampling causes patient stress. In contrast, E3G sampling, one of principal metabolites of estradiol in urine, is non-invasive and can be performed by the patients themselves and measured by fluorescent immunoassay. A correlation has been shown between concentrations of E2 present in plasma and concentrations of E3G in different phases of menstruation cycle. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: This is a pilot, prospective study, in a single IVF clinic. Twenty female participants were recruited November 2020 -January 2021, aged 25–43 years and BMI: 18–28kg/m2. Dynamic change of serum E2 and urine E3G at ovarian stimulation monitoring are being analyzed. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Concurrent urine E3G and serum E2 values were collected from patients who provided between 2 and 4 samples on different days of their COH IVF cycle. Serum E2 values were assessed routinely, while E3G values were measured and validated using a fluorescent immunoassay Mira Fertility Plus® analyzer.Main results and the role of chance: The urine E3G of assay was validated for intra- and inter-assay variability with a coefficient of variation of < 20%. It was also validated for analytical and functional sensitivity and sample stability. Linear regression of serum E2 and E3G values of 56 early morning urine samples who had evaluated between Days 4 and 13 of menstruation cycle provided an R = 0,81. Urine E3G values also correlated to follicle growth. Patient survey results showed that urine sampling was the preferred method of analysis. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: We have provided proof of principle that urine E3G measurement can be accurately carried out using fluorescent immunoassay technology during routine COH for IVF cycles. The patients’ study group has to be expanded in order to enable us to find the appropriate place of urine E3G assay in COH protocol. Wider implications of the findings: Urine E3G testing correlates well to serum E2 assessment in COH. Urine E3G assay provides an alternative to serum-based assessment. The ease of urine sampling allows a reduction in patient discomfort during venopuncture, costs, time, and infection risks in epidemics/pandemics, like COViD–19, and offers a patient-friendly approach to ovarian stimulation.

It is of great value to study the changes in the immune microenvironment of GGO to elucidate the occurrence and evolution of early lung adenocarcinoma. Although the changes of IL-6 and NK cells in lung adenocarcinoma have caught global attention, we have little appreciation for how IL-6 and NK cells in the lung GGO affect the progression of early lung adenocarcinoma. METHODS: We analyzed the RNA sequencing data of surgical specimens from 21 patients with GGO-featured primary lung adenocarcinoma and verified the changes in the expression of IL-6 and other important immune molecules in the TCGA and GEO databases. Next, we used flow cytometry to detect the protein expression levels of important Th1/Th2 cytokines in GGO and normal lung tissues and the changes in the composition ratio of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). Then, we analyzed the effect of IL-6 on NK cells through organoid culture and immunofluorescence. Finally, we explored the changes of related molecules and pathway might be involved. RESULTS: IL-6 may play an important role in the tumor microenvironment of early lung adenocarcinoma. Further research confirmed that the decrease of IL-6 in GGO tissue is consistent with the changes in NK cells, and there seems to be a correlation between these two phenomena. CONCLUSION: The IL-6 expression status and NK cell levels of early lung adenocarcinoma as GGO are significantly reduced, and the stimulation of IL-6 can up-regulate or activate NK cells in GGO, providing new insights into the diagnosis and pathogenesis of early lung cancer.","Zhang, Pengfei; He, Boxue; Cai, Qidong; Tu, Guangxu; Peng, Xiong; Zhao, Zhenyu; Peng, Weilin; Yu, Fenglei; Wang, Min; Tao, Yongguang; Wang, Xiang",Front Oncol,126,13

The stochastic production frontier estimation with selectivity correction is employed, besides matching technique to obtain unbiased estimates on technology efficiency. The empirical analysis finds that adopting emerging technologies enhances the productivity of SMEs. After observed and unobserved factors are controlled, the technical efficiency of adopters is higher by more than 26% on average, compared to non-adopters. Moreover, if the gap among production frontiers is considered, the difference in productivity would rise further.

Proper back transformation is used to infer about the original Poisson means. The square root transformation makes the normal approximation of the transformed data more justifiable with added homoscedasticity. We obtain exact analytical formulas for the bias and mean squared error of the proposed EB estimators.

In this time series-based analysis, dynamics of multidisciplinary care for chronic pain and opioid prescribing are analyzed over a forty-four year time span. Three distinct periods are identified, each defined by distinct research areas, as well as priorities regarding the use of opioids and the appropriate management of chronic pain. These scientometrically defined periods align with timelines identified previously by narrative historical accounts. Through cross-correlation with a mortality time series, a significant two-year lag between opioid overdose mortality and citation dynamics is identified between 2004 and 2019. This analysis demonstrates a bidirectional relationship between the scientific literature and the North American opioid overdose crisis, suggesting that the scientific literature is both reflective and generative of an important health and social phenomenon. A scientometric phenomenon of memory lapse, namely an overt and prolonged failure to cite older relevant literature, is identified using a metric of mean time to citation. It is proposed that this metric can be used to analyze changes in emerging literature and thus predict the nature of clinical and policy responses to the opioid crisis, and thus potentially to other health and social phenomena.","Sud, Abhimanyu; Cheng, Darren K.; Moineddin, Rahim; Zlahtic, Erin; Upshur, Ross",Scientometrics,126,20

However, although a recent whole-exome sequencing revealed abundant heterogeneic mutation accumulation in cancers, identification and synthesis of autoantibodies against specific cancer-associated antigens is still difficult in cancer patients owing to the very small number of B cells producing autoantibodies. In the present study, to identify autoantibodies targeting tumor antigens, we measured the titer of autoantibodies in high-grade glioma patients' plasma and identified two patients with elevated autoantibodies to a few transmembrane proteins. Specific B cells producing autoantibody against vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) 2 were immunostained with labeled protein and anti-human IgG antibody, and then collected by a single cell sorter. Finally, 22 antibody genes were successfully identified using direct IgG cloning from single B cell mRNA, and two antibody clones were found to have significant VEGFR2-specific binding affinity. The current direct human IgG gene cloning technique for identifying human antibodies derived from IgG-memory B cells avoids time-consuming procedures such as phage display-based antibody-library screening, and therefore may be applicable to identifying human autoantibodies in a variety of disorders including cancers even when antibody elevation is not detected because of a very small number of memory B cells.","Iizuka, Akira; Komiyama, Masaru; Oshita, Chie; Kume, Akiko; Ashizawa, Tadashi; Mitsuya, Koichi; Hayashi, Nakamasa; Nakasu, Yoko; Yamaguchi, Ken; Akiyama, Yasuto",Immunology letters,126,5

RECENT FINDINGS Elderly patients undergoing cardiac arrest (CA) challenge the appropriateness of attempting cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Current literature suggests that factors traditionally associated with survival to hospital discharge and neurologically intact survival after CA cardiac arrest in general (e.g. presenting ryhthm, bystander CPR, targeted temperature management) may not be similarly favorable in elderly patients. Alternative factors meaningful for outcome in this special population include prearrest functional status, comorbidity load, the specific age subset within the elderly population, and CA location (i.e., nursing versus private home). Age should therefore not be a standalone criterion for withholding CPR. Attempts to perform CPR in an elderly patient should instead stem from a shared decision-making process. SUMMARY An appropriate CPR attempt is an attempt resulting in neurologically intact survival. Appropriate CPR in elderly patients requires better risk classification.

Such pulseless electrical activity (PEA) in newborn infants has not previously been thoroughly described. The aim of this study was to further investigate the occurrence of non-perfusing cardiac rhythms in asphyxiated piglets and the potential implications for the success of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and short-term survival. METHODS Neonatal piglets (1-4 days, 1.7-2.4kg) had their right common carotid artery exposed and enclosed with a real-time ultrasonic flow probe. Heart rate (HR) was continuously measured and recorded using ECG. This allowed simultaneous monitoring of HR via ECG and CBF. The piglets were asphyxiated until cardiac arrest, defined as no CBF and no audible beat upon precordial auscultation. CPR was performed until return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC, defined as a HR ≥100 bpm). ECG traces were retrospectively assessed. RESULTS Nine out of 21 piglets (43%) had QRS-complexes on their ECG while no CBF and no audible heart sounds could be detected. Five (56%) of the piglets with PEA and 12/12 (100%) piglets with asystole at cardiac arrest obtained ROSC (p = 0.02). Thirty-three per cent of the piglets with PEA versus 58% with asystole survived to 4 hours post-ROSC (p = 0.39). CONCLUSION Cardiac arrest in the presence of a non-perfusing cardiac rhythm on ECG is common in asphyxiated piglets. Clinical arrest in the presence of a non-perfusing cardiac rhythm on ECG may reduce the success of CPR.","Solevåg, Anne Lee; Luong, Deandra; Lee, Tze-Fun; O'Reilly, Megan; Cheung, Po-Yin; Schmölzer, Georg M",PloS one,126,1

Exposures were performed through diet using environmentally relevant concentrations of MPs over 4 months. No modification of classical biomarkers, lipid peroxidation, genotoxicity or F0 behaviour was observed. A significant decrease in growth was reported after at least two months of exposure. This decrease was similar between species, independent from the type of MPs polymer and the presence or not of spiked chemicals, but was much stronger in females. The reproduction was evaluated and it revealed a significant decrease in the reproductive output for both species and in far more serious numbers in medaka. PVC appeared more reprotoxic than PE as were MPs spiked with PFOS and benzophenone-3 compared to MPs spiked with benzo[a]pyrene. Further, PVC-benzophenone-3 produced behavioural disruption in offspring larvae. These results obtained with two species representing different aquatic environments suggest that microplastics exert toxic effects, slightly different according to polymers and the presence or not of sorbed chemicals, which may lead in all cases to serious ecological disruptions.","Cormier, Bettie; Le Bihanic, Florane; Cabar, Mathieu; Crebassa, Jean-Claude; Blanc, Mélanie; Larsson, Maria; Dubocq, Florian; Yeung, Leo; Clérandeau, Christelle; Keiter, Steffen H; Cachot, Jérôme; Bégout, Marie-Laure; Cousin, Xavier",Journal of hazardous materials,126,1

These symptoms are also known as a behavioral risk marker in predicting pediatric mood disorders. The underlying neural mechanism of emotional dysregulation, however, remains unclear. This study used the diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) technique to identify anatomically specific variation in white-matter microstructure that is associated with pediatric emotional dysregulation severity. Thirty-two children (mean age 9.53 years) with varying levels of emotional dysregulation symptoms were recruited by the Massachusetts General Hospital and underwent the DTI scans at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Emotional dysregulation severity was measured by the empirically-derived Child Behavior Checklist Emotional Dysregulation Profile that includes the Attention, Aggression, and Anxiety/Depression subscales. Whole-brain voxel-wise regression tests revealed significantly increased radial diffusivity (RD) and decreased fractional anisotropy (FA) in the cingulum-callosal regions linked to greater emotional dysregulation in the children. The results suggest that microstructural differences in cingulum-callosal white-matter pathways may manifest as a neurodevelopmental vulnerability for pediatric mood disorders as implicated in the clinical phenotype of pediatric emotional dysregulation. These findings may offer clinically and biologically relevant neural targets for early identification and prevention efforts for pediatric mood disorders.","Hung, Yuwen; Uchida, Mai; Gaillard, Schuyler L; Woodworth, Hilary; Kelberman, Caroline; Capella, James; Kadlec, Kelly; Goncalves, Mathias; Ghosh, Satrajit; Yendiki, Anastasia; Chai, Xiaoqian J; Hirshfeld-Becker, Dina R; Whitfield-Gabrieli, Susan; Gabrieli, John D E; Biederman, Joseph",NeuroImage.

Next, we demonstrate that a mesh-based sleeve coupled to the myocardium improves function in an acute porcine heart failure model. Then, we analyze the biological integration of global interface material candidates (medical mesh and silicone) in a healthy and infarcted murine model and show that a mesh interface yields superior mechanical coupling via pull-off force, histology, and microcomputed tomography. These results can inform the design of a therapeutic approach where a mesh-based soft robotic DCC is implanted, allowed to biologically integrate with the epicardium, and actuated for active assistance at a later timepoint. This strategy may result in more efficient coupling of extracardiac sleeves to heart tissue, and lead to increased augmentation of heart function in end-stage heart failure patients.","Horvath, Markus A; Varela, Claudia E; Dolan, Eimear B; Whyte, William; Monahan, David S; Payne, Christopher J; Wamala, Isaac A; Vasilyev, Nikolay V; Pigula, Frank A; Mooney, David J; Walsh, Conor J; Duffy, Garry P; Roche, Ellen T",Annals of biomedical engineering,126,1

The aim of this study was to investigate whether a preinstalled nasopharyngeal airway (NPA) in the right nasal passageway can facilitate NGI in anesthetized and intubated patients. METHODS A prospective randomized controlled trial including 108 patients scheduled for elective intra-abdominal surgeries requiring a nasogastric tube (NGT) was conducted. Fifty-three patients were randomized to receive NGI through a preinstalled NPA in the right nasal passageway (Group NPA) and 55 patients to receive NGI via the right nostril (Group O). The primary outcomes were success rates of NGI at first attempt, success rates of NGI in accumulative attempts, durations of successful NGI at the first attempt and success rates of NGI for the rescuing methods. The secondary outcomes were bleeding incidence and hemodynamic changes induced by NGI. RESULTS Success rate of NGI at the first attempt was 83.0% in Group NPA compared with 47.3% in Group O [P < 0.001; absolute risk reduction (ARR) = 35.7%, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 19.1-52.4%; relative risk reduction (RRR) = 67.8%] and success rate of NGI in accumulative attempts (two attempts maximum) was 88.7% in Group NPA compared with 63.6% in Group O (P = 0.002; ARR = 25.0%, 95% CI = 9.7-40.4%; RRR = 68.9%). Duration for NGI successful at the first attempt in Group NPA was significantly longer than that in Group O (56.3 vs. 27.1 s; P < 0.001; Mean difference = 29.2 s, 95% CI = 20.0-38.4 s). Neither bleeding incidence nor hemodynamic response is significantly different between the two study groups. CONCLUSIONS The study indicates a preinstalled NPA in the right nasal passageway facilitates NGI in anesthetized and intubated patients as an initial NGI method and as a rescuing method for patients undergoing two unsuccessful initial attempts of NGI without a preinstalled NPA. However, the NPA method proved to take more time than the routine method for NGI successful at the first attempt.

The costs to the health care system are increasing in light of Medicare penalties for readmissions for certain conditions. Surgical site infection following implant-based breast reconstruction (IBR) remains challenging. The rates of positive cultures and isolated microorganisms in IBR are unknown. This systematic review summarizes the reported microorganisms and positive culture rates in the existing literature. METHODS A systematic review was performed using the guidelines outlined in Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses. Articles were included if breast implant infection rates and culture results were reported. Further subgroup analysis of culture positive infections was performed. RESULTS A total of 25 studies were included, encompassing 25,177 IBR. Implant infections were reported in 1356 reconstructions (5.4%). Cultures were positive in 74.5% of infections. Gram-positive bacteria were the most common (68.6%), of which Staphylococcus species (51%) was the most isolated pathogen, followed by Pseudomonas. A subgroup analysis showed that early infections (63% vs 88%), radiotherapy (82% vs 93%), and acellular dermal matrix use (90% vs 100%) were associated with lower positive culture rates than their respective counterparts. Patients who received chemotherapy had higher positive culture results (94% vs 83%). Isolated microorganisms also varied among the subgroups. CONCLUSIONS This systematic review outlines reported microorganisms in IBR. Staphylococcus species and Pseudomonas were the most frequently reported microorganism. Negative cultures were reported in up to 25.5% of infections. Patients with early infections, radiotherapy, and acellular dermal matrix demonstrated higher negative culture rates.

Our objective was to examine the frequency of FS glucose monitoring in Veterans Affairs (VA) NH residents with diabetes mellitus, type II (T2DM). DESIGN AND SETTING National retrospective cohort study in 140 VA NHs. PARTICIPANTS NH residents with T2DM and older than 65 years admitted to VA NHs between 2013 and 2015 following discharge from a VA hospital. MEASUREMENTS NH residents were classified into five groups based on their highest hypoglycemia risk glucose-lowering medication (GLM) each day: no GLMs; metformin only; sulfonylureas; long-acting insulin; and any short-acting insulin. Our outcome was a daily count of FS measurements. RESULTS Among 17,474 VA NH residents, mean age was 76 (standard deviation (SD) = 8) years and mean hemoglobin A1c was 7.6% (SD = 1.5%). On day 1 after NH admission, 49% of NH residents were on short-acting insulin, decreasing slightly to 43% at day 90. Overall, NH residents had an average of 1.9 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.8-1.9) FS measurements on NH day 1, decreasing to 1.4 (95% CI = 1.3-1.4) by day 90. NH residents on short-acting insulin had the most frequent FS measurements, with 3.0 measurements (95% CI = 2.9-3.0) on day 1, decreasing to 2.6 measurements (95% CI = 2.5-2.7) by day 90. Less frequent FS measurements were seen for NH residents receiving long-acting insulin (2.1 (95% CI = 2.0-2.2) on day 1) and sulfonylureas (1.7 (95% CI = 1.5-1.8) on day 1). Even NH residents on metformin monotherapy had 1.1 (95% CI = 1.1-1.2) measurements on day 1, decreasing to 0.5 (95% CI = 0.4-0.6) measurements on day 90. CONCLUSION Although guidelines recommend less frequent glucose monitoring for NH residents, we found that many VA NH residents receive frequent FS monitoring. Given the uncertain benefits and potential for substantial patient burdens and harms, our results suggest decreasing FS monitoring may be warranted for many low hypoglycemia risk NH residents.","Jeon, Sun Y; Shi, Ying; Lee, Alexandra K; Hunt, Lauren; Lipska, Kasia; Boscardin, John; Lee, Sei",Journal of the American Geriatrics Society,126,19

Given that 41% of all young persons are enrolled in universities, and the increased vulnerabilities faced by SGM young persons during the pandemic, it is imperative to understand the effects of alcohol use on mental health among SGM university students amid COVID-19. This study aims to examine the associations between changes in alcohol use since the start of COVID-19 and mental distress among SGM university students in the U.S., and to explore sex-stratified differences. METHODS A nonprobability cross-sectional sample of 509 SGM university students (Mage = 22.04 years, SD = 3.99) were retrospectively surveyed online between May-August 2020 and asked if their alcohol use had changed since the start of COVID-19. Statistical analyses explored the association between changes in alcohol use since the start of COVID-19 and mental distress. RESULTS Average psychological distress (M = 27.79, SD = 7.82) was relatively high as per existing research and established clinical cutoff scores. Roughly 32% had increased alcohol use since the start of COVID-19.

Though solid dressings composed of alginate can absorb water and promote wound healing, they are not effective hemostatic materials, particularly against massive hemorrhage. The purpose of this study is to attempt to increase the hemostatic capabilities of alginate by means of hydrophobic modification. Previous studies have illustrated that modifying a different polysaccharide, chitosan, in this way enhances its hemostatic efficacy as well as its adhesion to tissue. Here, it was hypothesized that modifying alginate with hydrophobic groups would demonstrate analogous effects. METHODS Fifteen Yorkshire swine were randomized to receive hydrophobically-modified (hm) alginate lyophilized sponges (n=5), unmodified alginate lyophilized sponges (n=5), or standard Kerlix™ gauze dressing (n=5) for hemostatic control. Following a splenectomy, arterial puncture (6mm punch) of the femoral artery was made. Wounds were allowed to freely bleed for 30s, at which time dressings were applied and compressed for 3min in a randomized fashion. Fluid resuscitation was given to preserve the baseline mean arterial pressure. Wounds were monitored for 180min after arterial puncture, and surviving animals were euthanized. RESULTS Blood loss for the hm-alginate group was significantly less than the two control groups of (1) alginate and (2) Kerlix™ gauze (p=<0.0001). Furthermore, 80% of hm-alginate sponges were able to sustain hemostasis for the full 180min, whereas 0% of dressings from the control groups were able to achieve initial hemostasis. CONCLUSIONS Hm-alginate demonstrates a greatly superior efficacy, relative to unmodified alginate and Kerlix™ gauze dressings, in achieving hemostasis from a lethal femoral artery puncture in swine. This is a similar result as has been previously described when performing hydrophobic modification to chitosan. The current study further suggests that hydrophobic modification of a hydrophilic biopolymer backbone can significantly increase the hemostatic capabilities relative to the native biopolymer.","Dowling, Matthew B; Chaturvedi, Apurva; MacIntire, Ian C; Javvaji, Vishal; Gustin, John; Raghavan, Srinivasa R; Scalea, Thomas M; Narayan, Mayur",Injury,126,1

As the COVID-19 pandemic emerged, hospitals rapidly adapted prone positioning for acutely ill patients into a new process: awake self-prone positioning. Could a large health care system safely and rapidly implement awake self-prone positioning in COVID-19 units to prevent respiratory failure from progressing among a surge of inpatients? REVIEW OF EVIDENCE The team extensively reviewed the literature. Using evidence from 22 case reports, peer-reviewed standards, and studies, they developed an awake self-prone positioning guideline. IMPLEMENTATION The guideline was implemented in April 2020 in critical care and COVID-19 units. Multimodal education included a concise guideline and real-time support from intensive care unit nurses, clinical nurse specialists, and nursing professional development specialists. EVALUATION Awake self-prone positioning was a new procedure, and relevant data were obtained from the electronic medical record. From March 18 to August 5, 2020, 1000 COVID-19-related admissions occurred; 272 patients had a high-flow nasal cannula, 111 (41%) of whom had documentation of awake self-prone positioning. SUSTAINABILITY This guideline is now an established part of COVID-19 care and has been integrated into practice in units caring for patients with the disease. CONCLUSIONS Nurses adapted quickly to using awake self-prone positioning as a plan of care for hypoxic patients. This practice may help hospitals adjust care delivery for these patients and effectively maintain patients in non-intensive care units. (Critical Care Nurse.

However, isolation and preservation of a cell's native gene expression state from an intact embryo remain problematic. RESULTS Here, we present a strategy for in vivo single cell profiling that optimizes cell identification, isolation and amplification of nucleic acids with nominal bias and sufficient material detection. We first tested several photoconvertible fluorescent proteins to selectively mark a cell(s) of interest in living chick embryos then accurately identify and isolate the same cell(s) in fixed tissue slices. We determined that the dual color mDendra2 provided the optimal signal/noise ratio for this purpose. We developed proper procedures to minimize cell death and preserve gene expression, and suggest nucleic acid amplification strategies for downstream analysis by microfluidic reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction or RNAseq. Lastly, we compared methods for single cell isolation and found that our fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) protocol was able to preserve native transcripts and generate expression profiles with much higher efficiency than laser capture microdissection (LCM). CONCLUSIONS Quantitative single cell gene expression profiling may be accurately applied to interrogate complex cell dynamics events during embryonic development by combining photoconversion cell labeling, FACS, proper handling of isolated cells, and amplification strategies.","Morrison, Jason A; Box, Andrew C; McKinney, Mary C; McLennan, Rebecca; Kulesa, Paul M",Developmental dynamics : an official publication of the American Association of Anatomists,126,1

With the confident identification of these landmarks, radiographs could provide more assistance in preoperative evaluations, intraoperative guidance, and postoperative assessments. PURPOSE To quantify the radiographic locations of endoscopic landmarks of the proximal femur. STUDY DESIGN Descriptive laboratory study. METHODS Ten cadaveric specimens were dissected, and radio-opaque hardware was placed for each landmark of interest. Radiographs were obtained and measurements recorded in anteroposterior (AP) and Dunn 45° views. RESULTS In the AP view, the gluteus medius insertion was located a mean 12.9 ± 2.4 mm and 34.7 ± 5.1 mm from the piriformis fossa and vastus tubercle, respectively. The piriformis fossa was a mean 14.8 ± 5.9 mm and 4.9 ± 1.9 mm from the anterior and posterior tips of the greater trochanter, respectively. The anterior and posterior tips of the greater trochanter were a mean 14.8 ± 5.1 mm from each other. In the Dunn 45° view, the piriformis fossa was a mean 13.3 ± 2.0 mm, and the vastus tubercle was a mean 21.5 ± 6.0 mm, from the gluteus medius insertion. Moreover, the vastus tubercle was a mean 33.5 ± 6.4 mm from the anterior tip of the greater trochanter and 31.6 ± 8.5 mm from the posterior tip of the greater trochanter. CONCLUSION In spite of the variation in cadaveric sizes, quantitative descriptions of endoscopic landmarks were reproducible in clinical views.

Thirty-six participants with major depressive disorder (MDD) and MADRS scores ≥20 were enrolled in a nonrandomized 6-week open-label trial of commercially available antidepressants. Twice daily, a mobile device prompted participants to self-report the 6 items of the HamD6 sub-scale derived from the Hamilton rating scale for depression (HamD17). Morning EMA reports asked ""how do you feel now"" whereas evening reports gathered a full-day impression. Clinicians who were blinded to the EMA data rated the MADRS, HamD17 and HamD6 at screen, baseline and weeks 2,4, and 6. Hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) examined the course of the EMA assessments and convergence between EMA scores and clinician ratings. HLM analyses revealed strong correlations between AM and PM EMA derived HamD6 scores and revealed significant improvements over time. EMA improvements were significantly correlated with the clinician rated HamD6 scores at endpoint and predicted clinician rated HamD6 score changes from baseline to endpoint (p < .001). There was a large correlation between EMA and clinician derived HamD6 scores at each in-person assessment after baseline. Treatment response defined by EMA matched the clinician rated HamD6 treatment responses in 33 of 36 cases (91.7%). EMA derived symptom scores appear to be efficient and valid measures to track daily symptomatic change in clinical trials and may provide more accurate measures of symptom severity than the episodic ""snapshots"" that are currently used as clinical outcomes. These findings support further investigation of EMA for assessment in clinical trials.","Targum, Steven D; Sauder, Colin; Evans, Miriam; Saber, John N; Harvey, Philip D",Journal of psychiatric research,126,16

Although there have been many studies on HER 2 breast cancer treatment and management in recent years, there is a lack of comprehensive reports on the treatment outcomes and disparities within the available literature. Hence, this review aimed to determine the treatment outcomes and their associated factors among patients with HER2-positive breast cancer. METHODS A computer-based systematic literature search was conducted using PubMed, EMBASE, and Google scholar databases of articles published from 2000 to 2020. The following key terms (HER 2 positive breast cancer, predictor, determinant, associated factor) and Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms (breast neoplasms, treatment outcome, and risk factors) were used to search the English language published articles. RESULTS In most studies, trastuzumab was the most commonly used treatment regimen used in combination with chemotherapeutic agents. Generally, most of the studies (15 studies) showed that the overall survival outcome was relatively higher after treatment among HER2 positive breast cancer patients. Nonetheless, two studies showed that the absence of significant change in the overall survival despite adequate treatment was given to the study participants. In addition, three studies demonstrated a partial response after treating HER2-positive breast cancer patients. CONCLUSION Generally, the overall survival outcome was relatively higher after treatment among HER2 positive breast cancer patients. The addition of trastuzumab in most of the studies has shown improvement in the overall survival and the disease-free survival rate of the study patients.","Degu, Amsalu; Yussuf, Asha",Journal of oncology pharmacy practice : official publication of the International Society of Oncology Pharmacy Practitioners,126,27

A recent randomized control trial proposed prehabilitation to reduce the postoperative morbidity in patients undergoing major abdominal surgery. Currently, there is a lack of evidence of using prehabilitation for patients undergoing gastrectomy for gastric cancer. The aim of our study is to demonstrate that home-based prehabilitation can reduce postoperative morbidity after gastrectomy for gastric cancer. METHODS PREFOG is a multi-center, open-label randomized control trial comparing 90-days postoperative morbidity rate after gastrectomy for gastric cancer between patients with or without prehabilitation. One-hundred twenty-eight patients will be randomized into an intervention or control group. The intervention arm will receive trimodal home-based prehabilitation including nutritional, psychological and exercise interventions. Secondary outcomes of the study will include physical and nutritional status, anxiety and depression level, quality of life, postoperative mortality rates and full completion of the oncological treatment as determined by the multidisciplinary tumor board. DISCUSSION PREFOG study will show if home-based trimodal prehabilitation is effective to reduce postoperative morbidity after gastrectomy for gastric cancer. Moreover, this study will allow us to determine whether prehabilitation can improve physical fitness and activity levels, nutritional status and quality of life as well as reducing anxiety and depression levels after gastrectomy for gastric cancer.

The main purpose of this two-year follow-up case study was, therefore, to examine whether syllable complexity may be considered as a robust indicator in CAS and whether it can explain the persistence of errors and, if so, at what age. This was tested in a boy followed up annually from age 5 to 7 who was administered a narrative task. Data analyses used the Phon program to estimate accuracies of different syllabic structures, phones, singleton and cluster consonants. Overall, the findings suggest that this child experienced difficulty producing syllabic structure commensurately with the level of complexity of the target structures. Notably, the presence of syllable planning/sequencing deficit found in French data clearly supports the hypotheses according to which (a) there is a relationship between the level of complexity of syllabic structures and their simplification and (b) the persistence of errors on the most complex syllables remains, becoming a robust indicator for identifying CAS from other speech disorders. Further cross-language investigations on syllable complexity in CAS are needed to design better assessments and to plan efficient intervention.","Canault, Mélanie; Thai-van, Hung; Le Normand, Marie-Thérèse",Clinical linguistics & phonetics,126,16

Our work identified that PDCD4 is highly expressed in axons and dendrites of CNS and PNS neurons, with loss and gain of function experiments in cortical and dorsal root ganglia primary neurons demonstrating the capacity of PDCD4 to negatively control axonal growth. To explore PDCD4 transcriptome and translatome targets we used Ribo-Seq and uncovered a list of potential targets with known functions as axon/neurite outgrowth regulators. In addition, we observed that PDCD4 can be locally synthesized in adult axons in vivo and its levels decrease at the site of peripheral nerve injury and before nerve regeneration. Overall, our findings demonstrate that PDCD4 can act as a new regulator of axonal growth via the selective control of translation, providing a target mechanism for axon regeneration and neuronal plasticity processes in neurons.","Di Paolo, Andres Pablo; Eastman, Guillermo; Mesquita Ribeiro, Raquel; Farias, Joaquina; Macklin, Andrew; Kislinger, Thomas; Colburn, Nancy; Munroe, David; Sotelo Sosa, Jose Roberto; Dajas Bailador, Federico; Sotelo Silveira, Jose Roberto",RNA,126,1

However, despite evidence that laryngoscope handles could be a source of nosocomial infection, neither our institution nor the American Society of Anesthesiologists has any specific guidelines for handle disinfection. We hypothesized that laryngoscope handles may be sufficiently contaminated with bacteria and viruses to justify the implementation of new handle-cleaning protocols. METHODS Sixty laryngoscope handles from the adult operating rooms were sampled with premoistened sterile swabs. Collection was performed between cases, in operating rooms hosting a broad variety of subspecialty procedures, after the room and equipment had been thoroughly cleaned for the subsequent case. Samples from 40 handles were sent for aerobic bacterial culture, and antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed for significant isolates. Samples from 20 handles were examined for viral contamination using a polymerase chain reaction assay that detects 17 respiratory viruses. RESULTS Of the 40 samples sent for culture, 30 (75%) were positive for bacterial contamination. Of these positive cultures, 25 (62.5%) yielded coagulase-negative staphylococci, seven (17.5%) Bacillusspp. not anthracis, three (7.5%) alpha-hemolytic Streptococcusspp., and one each (2.5%) of Enterococcusspp., Staphylococcus aureus(S. aureus), and Corynebacteriumspp. No vancomycin-resistant enterococci, methicillin-resistant S. aureus, or Gram-negative rods were detected. All viral tests were negative. CONCLUSION We found a high incidence of bacterial contamination of laryngoscope handles despite low-level disinfection. However, no vancomycin-resistant enterococci, methicillin-resistant S. aureus, Gram-negative rods, or respiratory viruses were detected. Our results support adoption of guidelines that include, at a minimum, mandatory low-level disinfection of laryngoscope handles after each patient use.","Call, Tyler R; Auerbach, Frederic J; Riddell, Scott W; Kiska, Deanna L; Thongrod, Sumena C; Tham, See Wan; Nussmeier, Nancy A",Anesthesia and analgesia,126,28

METHODS From April 2008 to October 2013, 66 pancreatic resections were performed at the Iwakuni Clinical Center. The milk test has been routinely conducted at the institute whenever possible during pancreatectomy. The milk test comprises the following procedure: A nasogastric tube is inserted until the third portion of the duodenum, followed by injection of 100 mL of milk through the tube. If a chyle leak is present, the patient tests positive in this milk test based on the observation of a white milky discharge. Positive milk test rates, leakage sites, and chylous ascites incidence were examined. LigaSure™ (LS; Covidien, Dublin, Ireland), a vessel-sealing device, is routinely used in pancreatectomy. Positive milk test rates before and after use of LS, as well as drain discharge volume at the 2(nd) and 3(rd) postoperative days, were compared retrospectively. Finally, positive milk test rates and chylous ascites incidence were compared with the results of a previous report. RESULTS Fifty-nine milk tests were conducted during pancreatectomy. The positive milk test rate for all pancreatectomy cases was 13.6% (8 of 59 cases). One case developed postoperative chylous ascites (2.1% among the pancreatoduedenectomy cases and 1.7% among all pancreatectomies). Positive rates by procedure were 12.8% for pancreatoduodenectomy and 22.2% for distal pancreatectomy. Positive rates by disease were 17.9% for pancreatic and 5.9% for biliary diseases. When comparing results from before and after use of LS, positive milk test rates in pancreatoduodenectomy were 13.0% before and 12.5% after, while those in distal pancreatectomy were 33.3% and 0%. Drainage volume tended to decrease when LS was used on the 3(rd) postoperative day (volumes were 424 ± 303 mL before LS and 285 ± 185 mL after, P = 0.056). Both chylous ascites incidence and positive milk test rates decreased slightly compared with those rates from the previous study. CONCLUSION Positive milk test rates and chylous ascites incidence decreased over time. Sealing technology may thus play an important role in preventing postoperative chylous ascites.","Aoki, Hideki; Utsumi, Masashi; Sui, Kenta; Kanaya, Nobuhiko; Kunitomo, Tomoyoshi; Takeuchi, Hitoshi; Takakura, Norihisa; Shiozaki, Shigehiro; Matsukawa, Hiroyoshi",World journal of gastrointestinal surgery,126,5

DESIGN Case-control study. SETTING Neonatal Intensive Care Unit of the Wilhelmina Children's Hospital, The Netherlands. PATIENTS 68 (41 males) small for gestational age (SGA) (birth weight <10th percentile) and 136 (82 males) appropriate for gestational age (AGA) (birth weight 20th-80th percentile) neonates, matched for gender, gestational age, ventilatory and blood pressure support. METHODS Regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rScO2) and cerebral fractional tissue oxygen extraction (cFTOE) as measured by near-infrared spectroscopy throughout the first 72 h of life were compared between SGA and AGA neonates. The effect of gender was also explored within these comparisons. RESULTS SGA neonates demonstrated higher rScO2 (71% SEM 0.2 vs 68% SEM 0.2) and lower cFTOE (0.25 SEM 0.002 vs 0.29 SEM 0.002) than AGA neonates. There was an independent effect of gender on rScO2 and cFTOE, resulting in the finding that SGA males displayed highest rScO2 and lowest cFTOE (73% SEM 0.3 respectively 0.24 SEM 0.003). AGA males and SGA females showed comparable rScO2 (69% SEM 0.2 vs 69% SEM 0.4) and cFTOE (0.28 SEM 0.002 vs 0.28 SEM 0.004). AGA females showed lowest rScO2 and highest cFTOE (66% SEM 0.2 respectively 0.30 SEM 0.002). CONCLUSIONS Growth restriction and gender influence cerebral oxygenation and oxygen extraction in preterm neonates throughout the first 3 days of life.","Cohen, Emily; Baerts, Willem; Alderliesten, Thomas; Derks, Jan; Lemmers, Petra; van Bel, Frank",Archives of disease in childhood.

The role of ventilation in removing exhaled airborne bio-aerosols and preventing cross infections has been multidisciplinary extensively studied after the SARS outbreak in 2003. The characteristics of droplet-borne, short-range airborne and long-range airborne transmission of infectious diseases were identified. Increasing ventilation rate can effectively reduce the risk of long-range airborne transmission, while it may be of little useful in preventing the droplet-borne transmission. To maintain the airflow direction from clean cubicles to dirty cubicles is an effective way to prevent the cross infection between cubicles, which is widely used in hospital isolation rooms. Field measurements showed that wrong air flow direction was due to poor construction quality or maintenance. The impacts of different airflow patterns on removing large droplets and fine droplet nuclei were discussed. Some new concepts in general ventilation systems and local personalized equipment were also introduced. This review updates current knowledge of the airborne transmission of pathogens and the improvement of ventilation efficiency concerning the infection prevention.","Qian, Hua; Zheng, Xiaohong",Journal of thoracic disease,126,16

Objective The purpose of this study was to assess factors associated with smoking status in a sample of students in the northern Kosovo province. Materials and methods A total of 514 students enrolled in University in Kosovska Mitrovica, Kosovo, were recruited between April to June 2015 at Student Public Health Center during mandatory health checks. Participants filled in socio-demographic and behavioral questionnaire and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). Based on responses about smoking, students were categorized in non-smokers, former smokers, light smokers (1-13 cigarettes/day) and heavy smokers (> 13 cigarettes/day). Results Of 514 students, 116 (22.6%) classified themselves as smokers. Higher education level of fathers (Odds ratio [OR]=2.89, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.30-6.44, p=0.009), not living with smokers (OR=0.42, 95%CI 0.15-0.97, p=0.017) and longer exposure to second hand smoke (OR=1.07, 95%CI 1.01-1.13, p=0.036) was associated with former smoking. Studying medical and natural sciences (OR=2.07, 95%CI 1.05-4.18, p=0.040), consuming alcohol (OR=2.98, 95%CI 1.19-10.03, p=0.020), living with smokers (OR=2.88, 95%CI 1.49-5.56, p=0.002), longer exposure to second hand smoke (OR=1.06, 95%CI 1.01-1.11, p=0.019) and having a more intense depressive symptoms (OR=1.08, 95%CI 1.03-1.13, p=0.002) was associated with light smoking. Being male (OR=0.22, 95%CI 0.07-0.41, p=0.001), older (OR=1.47, 95%CI 1.21-1.78, p=0.001), living with smokers (OR=3.78, 95%CI 1.69-8.07, p=0.001), longer daily exposure to second-hand smoke (OR=1.10, 95%CI 1.04-1.16, p=0.001), and having more severe depressive symptoms (OR=1.12, 95%CI 1.07-1.18, p=0.001) were associated with heavy smoking. Conclusion Smoking prevention and cessation programs should include the entire community, because exposure to environmental second hand smoke may facilitate initiation and more intense smoking. Screening of student smokers for depression should be prioritized in the process of rebuilding the framework for primary and secondary prevention in the post-conflict period.","Gazibara, Tatjana; Milic, Marija; Parlic, Milan; Stevanovic, Jasmina; Mitic, Nebojsa; Maric, Gorica; Tepavcevic, Darija Kisic; Pekmezovic, Tatjana",African health sciences,126,5

In this study, the snapshot microplastic profile of an urban stream was assessed in the Braamfontein Spruit, located in Johannesburg the largest city in South Africa. The abundance of microplastics was determined in water, Chironomus sp. larvae and sediment, while in situ parameters were taken to investigate their relationship to the microplastic profile of the different matrices. Microplastics were detected in water (mean of 705 particles m-3), Chironomus sp. larvae (mean of 53.4 particles g-1 wet weight) and sediment (mean of 166.8 particles kg-1 dry weight). The study found evidence of how urban stream characteristics such as a weir, stream depth and velocity could affect the abundance and dispersion of microplastics. The results indicate that areas of increased depth and decreased flow allowed microplastics to settle down to the sediment where benthic macroinvertebrates could ingest these fragments. Large obstructions like a weir also increased microplastic counts in sediment and invertebrates above the obstruction, with a decrease of fragments after the obstruction, however, microplastics in surface water were able to flow over the obstruction and increase in abundance downstream. This study concludes that first order urban streams such as the Braamfontein Spruit may be contributing large numbers of microplastics to higher order streams and large rivers in times of increased flow.","Dahms, Heinrich T J; van Rensburg, Gregg J; Greenfield, Richard",The Science of the total environment,126,1

Concurrently, macrophages shift between alternate and classical activation. A key enzyme upregulated in alternatively activated macrophages is indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase, which converts tryptophan to kynurenine for de novo synthesis of nicotinamide. Nicotinamide can be used to replenish cellular NAD+ supplies. We hypothesize that an insufficient cellular NAD+ supply is the root cause of metabolic shifts in macrophages. We assert that manipulation of nicotinamide pathways may correct deleterious immune responses. We propose evaluation of nicotinamide (Vitamin B3) and analogues, including isoniazid, nicotinamide mononucleotide and nicotinamide riboside, as potential therapy for infectious causes of sepsis, including COVID-19.","Suchard, Melinda S; Savulescu, Dana M",The FEBS journal,126,1

In the Mediterranean basin, several isolates from two major Begomovirus species are involved in outbreaks and persistent epidemics. A real-time TaqMan PCR assay was developed and evaluated for the rapid and multiplex detection and differentiation of two begomoviruses often found in mixed infections in the region, Tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV) and Tomato yellow leaf curl Sardinia virus (TYLCSV). This assay was 1000-fold more sensitive than conventional PCR assays described previously, allowing the use of simple template preparation methods and eliminating the need for total nucleic acid purification. The viral DNA template was obtained by spotting sap extract derived from TYLCV or TYLCSV infected tissues on a nylon membrane or by directly using crude plant extracts in the real-time reaction cocktail. Preliminary results showed that this method can successfully detect and discriminate virus species from infected tomato, bean, pepper and different weed species obtained from the Mediterranean basin, the USA and Japan, allowing the simple, fast and cost-effective testing of a large number of samples in certification schemes. The assay can also be used for the detection of these two begomovirus species in their whitefly vector biotypes of the Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius) species group.","Papayiannis, L C; Iacovides, T A; Katis, N I; Brown, J K",Journal of virological methods,126,12

Pathotyping of four selected Brazilian strains showed that they all caused a considerable level of ciliostasis in the trachea but at a somewhat lower level than did M41 and Brazilian strains 50/96, 57/96, 62/96 and 64/96 representing four different serotypes that had been reported earlier. In contrast to the M41 challenge strain, all Brazilian isolates replicated in kidney tissue in a high percentage of non-vaccinated challenged birds, clearly showing that they are nephropathogenic. As for the tracheal protection, the results using Massachusetts (Mass) vaccination against the recent strains seemed to show protection higher on average than for the strains reported earlier. A single or twofold vaccination with a Mass vaccine resulted in a mean tracheal protection level against the four challenge strains of 92% and 90%, respectively, whereas a single and twofold vaccination with a Mass vaccine halved the percentage of infected kidneys (14% and 13%, respectively, P < .05) compared to that of the unvaccinated birds (27%). The combination of the Mass and the 793B vaccine provided on average a tracheal protection of 99% and a reduction of the percentage of infected kidneys to a mean of 2%. This was a significantly (P < .05) higher protection than that achieved by a single or twofold Mass vaccination, showing the added value of the 793B vaccination following priming with a vaccine of the Mass type.","De Wit, J J; Brandao, P; Torres, C A; Koopman, R; Villarreal, L Y",Avian pathology : journal of the W.V.P.A,126,26

Coaxial tubing systems incorporate the inspiratory tube within the lumen of the expiratory one. We hypothesized that by design, these tubing systems increase resistance to air flow compared with conventional ones. METHODS We investigated the flow-dependent pressure gradient across coaxial, conventional disposable, and conventional reusable tubing systems from 3 different manufacturers. Additionally, the additional work of breathing and perception of resistance during breathing through the different devices were determined in 18 healthy volunteers. RESULTS The pressure gradient across coaxial tubing systems was up to 6 times higher compared with conventional ones (1.90 ± 0.03 cm H2O vs 0.34 ± 0.01 cm H2O, P < .001) and was higher during expiration compared with inspiration (P < .001). Additional work of breathing and perceived breathing resistance were highest in coaxial tubing systems, accordingly.

Moreover, in a worldwide population, periodontal disease is often associated with cardiovascular diseases. Emerging studies have reported that one of the major pathogens related to periodontitis is Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis), which triggers the inflammatory intracellular cascade. Here, we hypothesized a possible protective effect of ascorbic acid (AA) in the restoration of the physiological molecular pathway after exposure to lipopolysaccharide derived from P. gingivalis (LPS-G). In particular, human gingiva-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hGMSCs) and endothelial-differentiated hGMSCs (e-hGMSCs) exposed to LPS-G showed upregulation of p300 and downregulation of DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1), proteins associated with DNA methylation and histone acetylation. The co-treatment of AA and LPS-G showed a physiological expression of p300 and DNMT1 in hGMSCs and e-hGMSCs. Moreover, the inflammatory process triggered by LPS-G was demonstrated by evaluation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and their intracellular localization. AA exposure re-established the physiological ROS levels. Despite the limitations of in vitro study, these findings collectively expand our knowledge regarding the molecular pathways involved in periodontal disease, and suggest the involvement of epigenetic modifications in the development of periodontitis.","Pizzicannella, Jacopo; Marconi, Guya Diletta; Guarnieri, Simone; Fonticoli, Luigia; Della Rocca, Ylenia; Konstantinidou, Fani; Rajan, Thangavelu Soundara; Gatta, Valentina; Trubiani, Oriana; Diomede, Francesca",Histochemistry and cell biology,126,1

Few reports have addressed the practicality of SILS in children. Our current experience with regard to feasibility and effectiveness of SILS in children is presented. METHODS A retrospective review of the operative database for patients operated on using SILS in our department from March 2009 to July 2010 was performed. Data regarding the type of the procedure, age, sex, operative performance, hospital stay, and complications were collected. MAIN RESULTS Among 43 patients, cholecystectomy was performed in 11; appendectomy, in 10; unroofing for ovarian cysts, in 5; unroofing for splenic cysts, in 4; oophorectomy, in 6 (ovarian torsion, 2; teratoma, 4); ovary-preserving teratoma excision, in 1; splenectomy, in 1; gonadectomy, in 3; and varicocelectomy, in 2. There were no conversions to standard laparoscopic or open techniques. The only postoperative complication was a wound infection that occurred after an appendectomy. CONCLUSION Although currently more expensive, SILS can be performed in children in almost every pediatric surgical procedure that can be accomplished with conventional laparoscopic techniques. The most significant contribution of SILS procedure is cosmesis.

We conducted an economic evaluation of pralatrexate from a societal perspective in Korea based on data from the PROPEL phase II study. METHODS Using a Markov model with a weekly cycle, we simulated the experience of patients with R/R PTCL receiving pralatrexate or CC for 15 years. The model consists of five health states; initial treatment, treatment pause, subsequent treatment, stem cell transplantation (SCT) success, and death. Comparative effectiveness was based on PROPEL phase II single-arm study and its matched historical control analysis. Costs included drug, drug administration, monitoring, adverse event management, and SCT costs. RESULTS The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of the base case was $39,153 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. The results of one-way sensitivity analysis ranged from $33,949 to $51,846 per QALY gained, which remained within an implicit willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of anticancer drugs in Korea. CONCLUSIONS Pralatrexate is a cost-effective intervention with improved OS and incremental costs within the WTP limit. Pralatrexate could function as a new therapeutic option for patients suffering from life-threatening R/R PTCL.","Park, Seonyoung; Kim, Ah-Young; Cho, Hyeonseok; Baik, Deborah; Lee, Hankil; Cho, Sunghwa; Kang, Hye-Young",BMC cancer,126,1

This was a retrospective review of 214 sites of pulmonary artery reconstruction at a single center from 2000 to 2014. We excluded patients with unifocalization of aortopulmonary collaterals. Primary outcome was reintervention for each type of patch. Total number of patch sites was 214 (180 patients). Median follow-up was 3.7 years. Patch materials and number of sites were branch patch homograft (92), bovine pericardium (44), autologous pericardium (41), and porcine intestinal submucosal patch (37). Median age and weight at the time of patch reconstruction were 12.1 months and 8.5 kg. Reintervention occurred at 34 sites (15.9%). With Cox proportional hazards regression, the following variables were associated with reinterevention: preoperative renal failure - hazard ratio of 4.36 (1.87-10.16), p<0.001 and weight at surgery - hazard ratio 0.93 (0.89-0.98), p=0.004. Patch type was not related to reintervention (p=0.197). Cost per unit patch ranged from $0 (dollars, US) for untreated autologous pericardium to $6,105 for homograft branch patch. In this retrospective analysis, there was no relationship between type of patch used for main or central branch pulmonary artery reconstruction and subsequent reintervention on that site.

METHODS A subset of studies reporting on QoL outcome measures were extracted from literature identified in a recent scoping search of Medline, Embase, Pubmed, NHS Economic Evaluation Database (Prospero registration CRD42016047332). The systematic scoping search examined impacts on patients waiting for orthopaedic specialist care. Two independent reviewers ranked study design using the National Health and Medical Research Council aetiology evidence hierarchy, and appraised study quality using Critical Appraisal Skills Programme tools. QoL measures were mapped against waiting period timepoints. RESULTS The scoping search yielded 142 articles, of which 18 reported on impact on QoL. These studies reported only on patients waiting for hip and/or knee replacement surgery. The most recent study reported on data collected in 2006/7. The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index and the SF-36 were the most commonly reported QoL measures. QoL was measured at variable timepoints in the waiting period (from a few weeks to greater than 12 months). The impact of waiting on QoL was inconsistent. CONCLUSION The evidence base was over 10 years old, reported only on patients with hip and knee problems, and on limited QoL outcome measures, and with inconsistent findings. A better understanding of the impact on QoL for patients waiting for specialist care could be gained by using standard timepoints in the waiting period, patients with other orthopaedic conditions, comprehensive QoL measures, as well as expectations, choices and perspectives of patients waiting for specialist care.","Morris, Joanne; Twizeyemariya, Asterie; Grimmer, Karen","Quality of life research : an international journal of quality of life aspects of treatment, care and rehabilitation",126,16

Acute fetal systemic inflammation in very preterm chronically catheterized sheep fetuses is not driven by cells in the fetal blood.,17.101753,8.496108,2016,"AIM The at-risk mental state (ARMS) allows clinicians to identify individuals who have an increased risk of developing psychosis. At present, most screening for psychosis-risk is carried out within help-seeking populations; however, screening within educational settings may allow clinicians to identify individuals at-risk earlier and to increase the rate of detection. This review aimed to examine screening for the ARMS in educational settings, with the key questions: what screening tools have been used in educational settings, can screening in educational settings detect individuals with ARMS, what threshold scores in screening tools indicate a positive screen in educational settings, are there comorbid mental health conditions associated with the ARMS in educational settings? METHODS Searches were carried out in PsycINFO, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Scopus and Web of Science and reference lists of included articles searched. Results were summarized using narrative synthesis. RESULTS Nine papers were included for narrative synthesis. A variety of screening tools have been used when screening for the ARMS in educational settings. The majority of studies have been conducted in schools. The prevalence of the ARMS reported in ranges from 1% to 8%. CONCLUSIONS The ARMS indicates the presence of distressing symptoms for which intervention may be beneficial. Screening programmes within educational settings may allow outreach for prodromal symptoms at an earlier stage than clinical settings currently provided for.","Howie, Clare; Potter, Claire; Shannon, Ciaran; Davidson, Gavin; Mulholland, Ciaran",Early intervention in psychiatry,126,12

Described herein is a useful and convenient method for intermittent vascular occlusion, which was standardized for laparoscopic hepatectomy. METHODS A tourniquet system consisting of cloth tape and a 20-cm catheter was used for intermittent vascular occlusion. This was placed through a hole in the abdominal wall from which a 5-mm trocar had been extracted. By operating this tourniquet system outside the patient's body, we were easily able to repeat intermittent vascular occlusion. Twenty-three patients underwent laparoscopic hepatectomy using this system. RESULTS The mean time of operation and vascular occlusion were 311.6 and 83.6 min, respectively. The mean blood loss was 215.0 mL. There were no intraoperative blood transfusions or critical postoperative complications. The average length of postoperative hospital stay was 6.5 days. The mean time to place this system was 354 s, and there were no complications caused by this system. CONCLUSION During totally laparoscopic hepatectomy, surgeons can perform intermittent vascular occlusion safely by using this method.","Okuda, Yukihiro; Honda, Goro; Kurata, Masanao; Kobayashi, Shin",Asian journal of endoscopic surgery,126,1

This glycoprotein spike determines the interaction of coronaviruses with the environment and the host. In this paper, we perform all atomic molecular dynamics simulations of the interaction between the SARS-CoV-2 trimeric glycoprotein spike and surfaces of materials. We considered a material with high hydrogen bonding capacity (cellulose) and a material capable of strong hydrophobic interactions (graphite). Initially, the spike adsorbs to both surfaces through essentially the same residues belonging to the receptor binding subunit of its three monomers. Adsorption onto cellulose stabilizes in this configuration, with the help of a large number of hydrogen bonds developed between cellulose and the three receptor-binding domains of the glycoprotein spike. In the case of adsorption onto graphite, the initial adsorption configuration is not stable and the surface induces a substantial deformation of the glycoprotein spike with a large number of adsorbed residues not pertaining to the binding subunits of the spike monomers.","Malaspina, David C; Faraudo, Jordi",Biointerphases,126,24

The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of LR on morbidity and mortality in octogenarians. METHOD This was a retrospective analysis of all patients who underwent rectal surgery for cancer between 2003 and 2013 in a teaching hospital. The primary aim of the study was to assess the influence of surgical approach on mortality and morbidity of rectal resection in patients ≥ 80 years old. Regression analysis was performed to control the effect of covariables on the clinical outcome. RESULTS Of 408 patients 203 were in the LR group and 205 in the OR group including 303 (74.3%) less than 80 years and 105 (25.7%) over 80 years. The mortality was lower in the LR group compared with the OR group for patients under 80 years (0% vs 4.6%; P = 0.049) and no different in the over 80 group (11.5% vs 9.4%; P = 0.859). In younger patients, the OR group showed longer hospital stay (9 vs 7 days; P < 0.001) and more complications (44.1% vs 29.8%; P = 0.042). Medical complications were more frequent in LR group than OR group octogenarians (40.4% vs 20.8%; P = 0.009) as well as grade C anastomotic leakage (13.8 vs 10.7; P = 0.041). CONCLUSION LR for rectal cancer showed clinical advantages in patients under 80 years and was as safe as OR in patients over 80 years, although the advantages of laparoscopic surgery were lost in the elderly group due to a higher rate of medical complications. OR may be an option in elderly patients with important comorbidities.","Landi, F; Vallribera, F; Rivera, J P; Bertoli, P; Armengol, M; Espín, E",Colorectal disease : the official journal of the Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland,126,16

An important feature of syndecan-1 related to its role in pathologies is that it can be shed from the surface of cells as an intact ectodomain composed of the extracellular core protein and attached heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate chains. Shed syndecan-1 remains functional and impacts cell behavior both locally and distally from its cell of origin. Shedding of syndecan-1 is initiated by a variety of stimuli and accomplished predominantly by the action of matrix metalloproteinases. The accessibility of these proteases to the core protein of syndecan-1 is enhanced, and shedding facilitated, when the heparan sulfate chains of syndecan-1 have been shortened by the enzymatic activity of heparanase. Interestingly, heparanase also enhances shedding by upregulating the expression of matrix metalloproteinases. Recent studies have revealed that heparanase-induced syndecan-1 shedding contributes to the pathogenesis and progression of cancer and viral infection, as well as other septic and non-septic inflammatory states. This review discusses the heparanase/shed syndecan-1 axis in disease pathogenesis and progression, the potential of targeting this axis therapeutically, and the possibility that this axis is widespread and of influence in many diseases.","Rangarajan, Sunil; Richter, Jillian R; Richter, Robert P; Bandari, Shyam K; Tripathi, Kaushlendra; Vlodavsky, Israel; Sanderson, Ralph D",The journal of histochemistry and cytochemistry : official journal of the Histochemistry Society,126,16

Changes in Medicare laws have resulted in an increased use of oxygen cylinders and a reduction in the use of liquid oxygen devices. The aim of this survey was to assess the impact of perceived satisfaction with various oxygen delivery devices on perceived mobility and quality of life (QOL) of oxygen-dependent subjects with COPD. METHODS A survey was developed to measure perceived satisfaction with current portable oxygen delivery devices, perceived mobility, and perceived QOL. The survey was deployed via a link posted on the COPD Foundation's COPD360SOCIAL social media site for 5 weeks, which resulted in the recruitment of 529 participants, of which 417 were included in the data analysis. RESULTS Quantile regression analysis revealed that the median perceived device satisfaction score was significantly higher in the liquid oxygen device group (P < .001) compared with the portable oxygen cylinder and portable oxygen concentrator (POC) groups. The median perceived mobility score was significantly higher in the liquid oxygen device group (P < .001) compared with the portable oxygen cylinder group, but not the POC group. The median QOL score was significantly higher in the liquid oxygen device group (P < .001) compared with the POC and portable oxygen cylinder groups. Moreover, partial least-squares structural equation modeling regression analysis showed that perceived mobility is significantly affected by perceived satisfaction with the long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) device (adjusted R2 = 0.15, P < .001), and perceived QOL is significantly affected by both perceived satisfaction with the LTOT device and perceived mobility (adjusted R2 = 0.45, P < .001). CONCLUSIONS For individuals with COPD requiring LTOT, perceived satisfaction with a portable LTOT device significantly and positively affects perceived mobility and QOL.","Mussa, Constance C; Tonyan, Laura; Chen, Yi-Fan; Vines, David",Respiratory care,126,1

Medical management alone may offer satisfactory treatment without the risk associated with surgical drainage. Therefore, we performed a systematic review of medical treatment alone compared to surgical drainage for the treatment of PTA. DATA SOURCES MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane CENTRAL, and ClinicalTrials.gov. REVIEW METHODS Studies comparing the outcomes of medically treated to surgically treated patients were included. Risk of bias was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. All screening and data extraction were completed by 2 independent reviewers. Meta-analysis was performed using a random-effects model. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS Ten cohort studies and 2 randomized studies were included (ntotal = 33,468). Study quality was low, with only 1 study providing multivariable analysis. The combined rate of treatment failure in patients initially treated with medical management alone was 5.7% compared to 5.5% in the surgical group. There was no statistically significant difference in the odds of treatment failure between interventions through random-effects meta-analysis (odds ratio [OR], 1.10; 95% CI, 0.53-2.26; I 2 = 41%; P = .13). Subgroup analysis excluding pediatric-specific studies revealed similar odds of treatment failure when initially managed with medical intervention (OR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.56-1.50; P = .39; I 2 = 0%). CONCLUSION Meta-analysis of available studies demonstrated no difference in odds of treatment failure for patients with PTA managed through medical intervention alone compared to surgical intervention. These findings should be interpreted with caution due to high probability of bias and overall low quality of studies.","Forner, David; Curry, Dennis E; Hancock, Kristy; MacKay, Colin; Taylor, S Mark; Corsten, Martin; Trites, Jonathan R; Rigby, Matthew H",Otolaryngology--head and neck surgery : official journal of American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery,126,31

In the format most often used, a polypeptide is displayed on the surface of a filamentous phage by genetic fusion to one of the coat proteins, creating a chimeric coat protein, and coupling phenotype (the protein) to genotype (the gene within). As the gene encoding the chimeric coat protein is packaged within the phage, selection of the phage on the basis of the binding properties of the polypeptide displayed on the surface simultaneously results in the isolation of the gene encoding the polypeptide. This unit describes the background to the technique, and illustrates how it has been applied to a number of different problems, each of which has its neurobiological counterparts.

This review systematically examined the characteristics and outcomes of interventions promoting illness uncertainty management among cancer patients and/or their family caregivers. METHODS PubMed, Scopus, PsycINFO, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Embase, and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews were systematically searched for relevant literature. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-experimental studies focusing on interventions for uncertainty management in cancer patients and/or their family caregivers. RESULTS Our database searches yielded 26 studies. Twenty interventions were only offered to cancer patients, who were mostly elder, female, and White. All interventions included informational support. Other intervention components included emotional support, appraisal support, and instrumental support. Most interventions were delivered in person and via telephone (n = 8) or exclusively in person (n = 7). Overall, 18 studies identified positive intervention effects on illness uncertainty outcomes. CONCLUSION This systematic review foregrounds the promising potential of several interventions-and especially multi-component interventions-to promote uncertainty management among cancer patients and their family caregivers. To further improve these interventions' effectiveness and expand their potential impact, future uncertainty management interventions should be tested among more diverse populations using rigorous methodologies.","Guan, Ting; Qan'ir, Yousef; Song, Lixin",Supportive care in cancer : official journal of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer,126,1

Bovine have been proposed to be the primary host and three main viral lineages (D/OK-like, D/660-like and D/Japan-like) have been described. Experimental infections were so far performed in swine, ferret, calf and guinea pig, in order to study IDV pathogenesis.We developed a murine experimental model to ease the study of IDV pathogenesis and immune response. DBA/2 mice were inoculated with 105 TCID50 of D/bovine/France/5920/2014 (D/OK-like). No clinical signs and weight loss were observed. Viral replication was observed mainly in the upper respiratory tract (nasal turbinates) but also in lower respiratory tract of infected mice, with a peak at 4 days post-infection. Moreover, the virus was also detected in the intestines. All infected mice seroconverted by 14 days post infection. Transcriptomic analyses demonstrated that IDV induced an activation of pro-inflammatory genes such as IFN-γ and CCL2. Inoculation of NFκB-luciferase and Ifnar1-/- mice demonstrated that IDV induced mild inflammation and that type I interferons response was not necessary in IDV clearance. Adaptation of IDV by serial passages in mice was not sufficient to induce disease or increased pathogenesis.Taken together, present data and comparisons with the calf model show that our mouse model allows for the study of IDV replication and fitness (before selected viruses may be inoculated on calves) and also of the immune response.ImportanceInfluenza D virus (IDV), a new genus of Orthomyxoviridae family, presents a large host range and a worldwide circulation. The pathogenicity of this virus has been studied in the calf model. The mouse model is frequently used to enable a first assessment of a pathogen's fitness, replication and pathogenesis for influenza A and B viruses. We showed that DBA/2 mice are a relevant in vivo model for the study of IDV replication. This model will allow for rapid IDV fitness and replication evaluation and will enable phenotypic comparisons between isolated viruses. It will also allow for a better understanding of the immune response induced after IDV infection.","Oliva, J; Mettier, J; Sedano, L; Delverdier, M; Bourgès-Abella, N; Hause, B; Loupias, J; Pardo, I; Bleuart, C; Bordignon, P J; Meunier, E; Le Goffic, R; Meyer, G; Ducatez, M F",Journal of virology,126,10

Current projections indicate that all PIC will experience an economic contraction in 2020, ranging from -1.0% in Tuvalu to -21.7% in Fiji, worse than most countries globally on average. Given that more than 80% of financing for health in the Pacific comes from domestic and external public sources, the net impact of the economic contraction on resources for health will depend on whether overall public spending can offset the decline in economic activity and how health will be prioritized in government budgets relative to other sectors. Without active reprioritization, most countries could see a slowdown or even decline in per capita levels of public spending for health in the region, risking gains made in advancing universal health coverage in recent years. If health ministries do not act quickly and in consort with other ministries (particularly ministries of finance), including by taking active steps to improve the efficient use of existing resources and other measures to mitigate the economic effects of the crisis on resources for health, it is likely that current economic circumstances will result in unplanned changes. These changes may not deliver the health outcomes that the health ministries would select themselves and may result in a reversal of hard-fought health gains.","Tandon, Ajay; Ivatts, Susan; Cowley, Peter; Roubal, Tomas; Dodd, Rebecca; Pepperall, Jane; Mikkelsen-Lopez, Inez; Irava, Wayne Jeremy; Palu, Toomas",Health systems and reform,126,1

A higher proportion of patients with influenza A virus infection than type B were observed. The influenza activity started in week 47/2019, and influenza positivity rate was ≥ 50% for 2 weeks (05-06/2020) rather than 5-8 weeks in the previous five seasons. In many countries a rapid reduction in sentinel reports and the highest influenza activity was observed in weeks 09-13/2020. Reporting was reduced from week 14/2020 across the Region coincident with the onset of widespread circulation of SARS-CoV-2.ConclusionsOverall, influenza type A viruses dominated; however, there were varying patterns across the Region, with dominance of B/Victoria-lineage viruses in a few countries. The COVID-19 pandemic contributed to an earlier end of the influenza season and reduced influenza virus circulation probably owing to restricted healthcare access and public health measures.","Adlhoch, Cornelia; Sneiderman, Miriam; Martinuka, Oksana; Melidou, Angeliki; Bundle, Nick; Fielding, James; Olsen, Sonja J; Penttinen, Pasi; Pastore, Lucia; Pebody, Richard",Euro surveillance : bulletin Europeen sur les maladies transmissibles = European communicable disease bulletin,126,29

Meta-analysis of three qualifying studies demonstrated a positive correlation between higher CPAP pressures and degree of MEP rise during CPAP use compared to baseline with mean difference of 25.1 daPa (95% confidence interval [18.7, 31.4]) at 5 cm H2O and 81.9 daPa (95% confidence interval [60.2, 103.5]) at 10 cm H2O. Short-term effects of CPAP use were reviewed in four studies that showed a transient rise in MEP. Three separate studies examining the long-term effects of CPAP use showed resting MEP was higher in patients with severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), which might be related to progressive eustachian tube dysfunction as a complication of severe OSA. CONCLUSION Short-term CPAP use is associated with transient elevations of MEP in adult ears. Long-term CPAP use might produce beneficial MEP changes, especially in patients with OSA and eustachian tube dysfunction.","Ma, Cheng; Yuen, Erick; Nguyen, Shaun A; Meyer, Ted A; Lambert, Paul R","Otology & neurotology : official publication of the American Otological Society, American Neurotology Society [and] European Academy of Otology and Neurotology",126,5

Here, we demonstrate a novel role for NA in enhancing host cell survival by activating the Src/Akt signaling axis via an interaction with carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 6/cluster of differentiation 66c (C6). NA/C6 interaction leads to increased tyrosyl phosphorylation of Src, FAK, Akt, GSK3β, and Bcl-2, which affects cell survival, proliferation, migration, differentiation, and apoptosis. siRNA-mediated suppression of C6 resulted in a down-regulation of activated Src, FAK, and Akt, increased apoptosis, and reduced expression of viral proteins and viral titers in influenza virus-infected human lung adenocarcinoma epithelial and normal human bronchial epithelial cells. These findings indicate that influenza NA not only aids in the release of progeny virions, but also cell survival during viral replication.","Gaur, Pratibha; Ranjan, Priya; Sharma, Shipra; Patel, Jenish R; Bowzard, J Bradford; Rahman, Shah K; Kumari, Rashmi; Gangappa, Shivaprakash; Katz, Jacqueline M; Cox, Nancy J; Lal, Renu B; Sambhara, Suryaprakash; Lal, Sunil K",The Journal of biological chemistry,126,1

Non-compliance is predominantly attributed to side effects, lack of illness insight, reduced well-being or poor therapeutic alliance. However, other still neglected factors may also play a role. Further, little is known about whether psychiatric patients without psychosis who are increasingly prescribed neuroleptics differ in terms of medication compliance or about reasons for non-compliance by psychosis patients. As direct questioning is notoriously prone to social desirability biases, we conducted an anonymous survey. After a strict selection process blind to results, 95 psychiatric patients were retained for the final analyses (69 participants with a presumed diagnosis of schizophrenia psychosis, 26 without psychosis). Self-reported neuroleptic non-compliance was more prevalent in psychosis patients than non-psychosis patients. Apart from side effects and illness insight, main reasons for non-compliance in both groups were forgetfulness, distrust in therapist, and no subjective need for treatment. Other notable reasons were stigma and advice of relatives/acquaintances against neuroleptic medication. Gain from illness was a reason for non-compliance in 11-18% of the psychosis patients. Only 9% of all patients reported no side effects and full compliance and at the same time acknowledged that neuroleptics worked well for them. While pills were preferred over depot injections by the majority of patients, depot was judged as an alternative by a substantial subgroup. Although many patients acknowledge the need and benefits of neuroleptic medication, non-compliance was the norm rather than the exception in our samples.","Moritz, Steffen; Peters, Maarten J V; Karow, Anne; Deljkovic, Azra; Tonn, Peter; Naber, Dieter",Mental illness,126,31

Design: Randomized cross-over trial. Setting: Research laboratory in a tertiary rehabilitation hospital. Participants: Convenience sample of 12 chronic stroke survivors. Outcome measures: Bilateral CSE measures of intracortical inhibition and facilitation, motor thresholds, and motor evoked potential (MEP) latency using transcranial magnetic stimulation. Upper limb functional measures of dexterity (Box and Blocks Test) and strength (pinch and grip strength). Results: Twelve (10 males; 62.50 ± 9.0 years old) chronic stroke (26.70 ± 23.0 months) survivors with moderate level of residual impairment participated. MEP latency from the ipsilesional hemisphere was lengthened after HIIT (pre: 24.27 ± 1.8 ms, and post: 25.04 ± 1.8 ms, p = 0.01) but not MICE (pre: 25.49 ± 1.10 ms, and post: 25.28 ± 1.0 ms, p = 0.44). There were no significant changes in motor thresholds, intracortical inhibition or facilitation. Pinch strength of the affected hand decreased after MICE (pre: 8.96 ± 1.9 kg vs. post: 8.40 ± 2.0 kg, p = 0.02) but not after HIIT (pre: 8.83 ± 2.0 kg vs. post: 8.65 ± 2.2 kg, p = 0.29). Regardless of type of aerobic exercise, higher total energy expenditure was associated with greater increases in pinch strength in the affected hand after exercise (R2 = 0.31, p = 0.04) and decreases in pinch strength of the less affected hand (R2 = 0.26 p = 0.02). Conclusion: A single bout of HIIT resulted in lengthened nerve conduction latency in the affected hand that was not engaged in the exercise. Longer latency could be related to the cross-over effects of fatiguing exercise or to reduced hand spasticity. Somewhat counterintuitively, pinch strength of the affected hand decreased after MICE but not HIIT. Regardless of the structure of exercise, higher energy expended was associated with pinch strength gains in the affected hand and strength losses in the less affected hand. Since aerobic exercise has acute effects on MEP latency and hand strength, it could be paired with upper limb training to potentiate beneficial effects.","Abraha, Beraki; Chaves, Arthur R; Kelly, Liam P; Wallack, Elizabeth M; Wadden, Katie P; McCarthy, Jason; Ploughman, Michelle",Frontiers in physiology,126,1

Facing this clinical condition, where the maintenance of the dentin-pulp complex vitality is imperative, is challenging in Dentistry. Dental pulp stem cells conditioned medium contains trophic factors that could help in this task. This in vivo pilot study aimed to evaluate the effects of the human dental pulp stem cells conditioned medium on the dental pulp tissue response to vital pulp therapy. MATERIAL AND METHODS Concentrated conditioned medium was obtained by incubating characterized human dental pulp stem cells with fresh culture medium. Pulp exposures performed at the first upper molars (n = 20) of Wistar rats were directly capped with: MTA or MTA + Conditioned Medium. Four and 8 weeks later, the samples were qualitatively analyzed in histological sections (H&E). RESULTS When the conditioned medium was associated with MTA, there were a high percentage of samples presenting formation of dentin bridges and small percentage of pulp tissue with inflammatory signs in both experimental times. The conditioned medium improved the organization of the newly formed hard tissue. CONCLUSIONS The association of dental pulp stem cell conditioned medium with MTA showed beneficial effects on dentin-pulp complex regeneration and has promising potential for studies in regenerative dentistry.","Sarra, Giovanna; Machado, Manoel Eduardo de Lima; Caballero-Flores, Héctor Valentin; Moreira, Maria Stella; Pedroni, Ana Clara Fagundes; Marques, Márcia Martins",Tissue & cell,126,16

Filling an unmet need for realistic large-animal models, we here present an ovine model of tendon injury for the comparative study of adult scarring repair and fetal regeneration. Complete regeneration of the fetal tendon within 28 days is demonstrated, while adult tendon defects remained macroscopically and histologically evident five months post-injury. In addition to a comprehensive histological assessment, proteome analyses of secretomes were performed. Confirming histological data, a specific and pronounced inflammation accompanied by activation of neutrophils in adult tendon defects was observed, corroborated by the significant up-regulation of pro-inflammatory factors, neutrophil attracting chemokines, the release of potentially tissue-damaging antimicrobial and extracellular matrix-degrading enzymes, and a response to oxidative stress. In contrast, secreted proteins of injured fetal tendons included proteins initiating the resolution of inflammation or promoting functional extracellular matrix production. These results demonstrate the power and relevance of our novel ovine fetal tendon regeneration model, which thus promises to accelerate research in the field. First insights from the model already support our molecular understanding of successful fetal tendon healing processes and may guide improved therapeutic strategies.","Ribitsch, Iris; Bileck, Andrea; Aldoshin, Alexander D; Kańduła, Maciej M; Mayer, Rupert L; Egerbacher, Monika; Gabner, Simone; Auer, Ulrike; Gültekin, Sinan; Huber, Johann; Kreil, David P; Gerner, Christopher; Jenner, Florien",International journal of molecular sciences,126,1

Objective To synthesize the current evidence on key organizational attributes and processes of international organ donation programs associated with successful outcomes and to generate a framework to categorize those attributes. Design Scoping Review using a mixed methods approach for data extraction. Setting Databases included PubMed, CINAHL, Embase, LILACS, ABI Business ProQuest, Business Source Premier, and gray literature (organ donation association websites, Google Scholar-first 8 pages), and searches for gray literature were performed, and relevant websites were perused. Sample Organ donation programs or processes. Methods We systematically searched the literature to identify any research design, including text and opinion papers and unpublished material (research data, reports, institutional protocols, government documents, etc). Searches were completed on January 2018, updated it in May 2019, and lastly in March 2020. Title, abstracts, and full texts were screened independently by 2 reviewers with disagreements resolved by a third. Data extraction followed a mixed method approach in which we extracted specific details about study characteristics such as type of research, year of publication, origin/country of study, type of journal published, and key findings. Studies included considered definitions and descriptions of success in organ donation programs in any country by considering studies that described (1) attributes associated with success or effectiveness, (2) organ donation processes, (3) quality improvement initiatives, (4) definitions of organ donation program effectiveness, (5) evidence-based practices in organ donation, and (6) improvements or success in such programs. We tabulated the type and frequency of the presence or absence of reported improvement quality indicators and used a qualitative thematic analysis approach to synthesize results. Results A total of 84 articles were included. Quantitative analysis identified that most of the included articles originated from the United States (n = 32, 38%), used quantitative approaches (n = 46, 55%), and were published in transplant journals (n = 34, 40.5%). Qualitative analysis revealed 16 categories that were described as positively influencing success/effectiveness of organ donation programs. Our thematic analysis identified 16 attributes across the 84 articles, which were grouped into 3 categories influencing organ donation programs' success: context (n = 39, 46%), process (n = 48, 57%), and structural (n = 59, 70%). Limitations Consistent with scoping review methodology, the methodological quality of included studies was not assessed. Conclusions This scoping review identified a number of factors that led to successful outcomes. However, those factors were rarely studied in combination representing a gap in the literature. Therefore, we suggest the development and reporting of primary research investigating and measuring those attributes associated with the performance of organ donation programs holistically.

METHODS This project has a quasi-experimental research design, based on a pilot study of 14 subjects aged above 65 years. They received eight sessions of singing group therapy given by a social robot or an occupational therapist. Completed copies of a therapeutic-factor questionnaire were then collected. RESULTS At the 4th week, the scores for 8 therapeutic factors were higher in sessions with the occupational therapist than the robot-directed sessions, reaching a statistically significant level; at the 8th week, the scores for 3 therapeutic factors, including imparting of information, were higher in sessions with the occupational therapist than in sessions with the robot. The top scoring therapeutic factor in the robot sessions was group cohesiveness. CONCLUSIONS Social robots may be good companion tools for elderly care during this COVID-19 outbreak, but group therapy sessions supervised by real-person therapists still have higher therapeutic factor scores than those conducted by robots.

IOCP can be used to assess the severity of PV stenosis and to identify potential portosystemic collateral pathways. The present study reviewed the utility of IOCP and the outcomes of patients who underwent assessment with an IOCP. Consecutive primary LDLTs were performed in 488 pediatric recipients between November 2005 and October 2019. IOCP was used in patients who were unable to achieve sufficient PV flow after the ligation of collaterals. In total, 11 patients underwent IOCP to assess potential portosystemic collateral pathways. The median age and body weight was 8 months (IQR, 6-11 months) and 6.6 kg (IQR, 5.7-8.9 kg), respectively. The reasons for using the IOCP were recurrent PV thrombus in seven patients and insufficient PV flow in four patients. IOCP revealed remaining collaterals in six patients and residual hypoplastic PV in eight patients. Two patients required additional interruption of the potential collaterals under IOCP, which were unable to be recognized as a dominant portosystemic collateral pathway on preoperative imaging. All eight patients with residual hypoplastic PV required vein graft interposition for the complete removal of the hypoplastic PV. All the patients are currently doing well with a median follow-up period of 4.9 years (IQR, 2.2-5.6 years).

Thrombosis in placental and spinal vessels and subsequent ischemic injury in EHV-1-infected horses manifests clinically as abortion and myeloencephalopathy. We have previously shown that addition of heparin anticoagulants to equine platelet-rich plasma (PRP) can abolish ex vivo EHV-1-induced platelet activation. The goal of this study was to test whether platelets isolated from horses treated with unfractionated heparin (UFH) or low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) were resistant to ex vivo EHV-1-induced activation. In a masked, block-randomized placebo-controlled cross-over trial, 9 healthy adult horses received 4 subcutaneous injections at q. 12 h intervals of one of the following treatments: UFH (100 U/kg loading dose, 3 maintenance doses of 80 U/kg), 2 doses of LMWH (enoxaparin) 80 U/kg 24 h apart with saline at the intervening 12 h intervals, or 4 doses of saline. Blood samples were collected before treatment and after 36 h, 40 h (4 h after the last injection) and 60 h (24 h after the last injection). Two strains of EHV-1, Ab4 and RacL11, were added to PRP ex vivo and platelet membrane expression of P selectin was measured as a marker of platelet activation. Drug concentrations were monitored in a Factor Xa inhibition (anti-Xa) bioassay. We found that LMWH, but not UFH, inhibited platelet activation induced by low concentrations (1 × 106 plaque forming units/mL) of both EHV-1 strains at 40 h. At this time point, all horses had anti-Xa activities above 0.1 U/ml (range 0.15-0.48 U/ml) with LMWH, but not UFH. By 60 h, a platelet inhibitory effect was no longer detected and anti-Xa activity had decreased (range 0.03 to 0.07 U/ml) in LMWH-treated horses. Neither heparin inhibited platelet activation induced by high concentrations (5 × 106 plaque forming units/mL) of the RacL11 strain. We found substantial between horse variability in EHV-1-induced platelet activation at baseline and after treatment. Minor injection site reactions developed in horses given either heparin. These results suggest that LMWH therapy may prevent thrombotic sequelae of EHV-1, however further evaluation of dosage regimens is required.","Stokol, Tracy; Serpa, Priscila B S; Brooks, Marjory B; Divers, Thomas; Ness, Sally",Frontiers in veterinary science,126,22

METHODS Small-bowel capsule endoscopy records, prospectively collected from 30 participating centers in the Lombardy Registry from October 2011 to December 2013, were included in the study if the clinical indication was obscure gastrointestinal bleeding and the capsule reached the cecum. Based on capsule findings, we created two groups: P2 (significant findings) and P0-1 (normal/negligible findings). Groups were compared for age, gender, small-bowel transit time, type of instrument, modality of capsule performance (outpatients vs inpatients), bowel cleanliness, and center volume. RESULTS We retrieved and scrutinized 1,433 out of 2,295 capsule endoscopy records (62.4%) fulfilling the inclusion criteria. Patients were 67 ± 15 years old, and 815 (57%) were males. In comparison with patients in the P0-1 group, those in the P2 group (n = 776, 54%) were older (P < 0.0001), had a longer small-bowel transit time (P = 0.0015), and were more frequently examined in low-volume centers (P < 0.001).

With the advent of minimal invasive surgery, the thoracoscopic elongation technique has been developed. METHODS Retrospective description of a single-center experience with the thoracoscopic treatment of patients with long gap esophageal atresia over a 7-year period. RESULTS Between 2007 and May 2014, 10 children with long gap esophageal atresia were treated by thoracoscopic elongation technique. In two children, the procedure failed. Eight children successfully underwent thoracoscopic traction with delayed primary anastomosis. Initially, all patients had a gastrostomy. During the course, the technique evolved into delayed primary anastomosis directly after birth without the use of a gastrostomy. CONCLUSION Thoracoscopic elongation technique in long gap esophageal atresia not only is feasible, but can nowadays also be performed directly after birth without the use of a gastrostomy. With this development, we have entered a new era in the management of long gap esophageal atresia.","van der Zee, David C; Gallo, Gabriele; Tytgat, Stefaan H A",Surgical endoscopy,126,1

A subset of these CTBs differentiate along an invasive pathway, penetrating the decidua and anchoring the placenta to the uterus. A critical hurdle in pregnancy is the ability of these cells to migrate, invade, and remodel spiral arteries, ensuring adequate blood flow to nourish the developing fetus. While advances continue in describing the molecular features regulating the differentiation of these cells, assessment of their global proteomic changes at midgestation remain undefined. Here, using sequential window acquisition of all theoretical fragment-ion spectra (SWATH), a data-independent acquisition strategy, we characterized the protein repertoire of second trimester human CTBs during their differentiation towards an invasive phenotype. This mass spectrometry-based approach allowed identification of 3,026 proteins across four culture time points corresponding to sequential stages of differentiation, confirming the expression dynamics of established molecules and offering new information into other pathways involved. The availability of a SWATH CTB global spectral library serves as a beneficial resource for hypothesis generation and a foundation for further understanding of CTB differentiation dynamics.","Chen, Hao; Williams, Katherine E; Kwan, Elaine Y; Kapidzic, Mirhan; Puckett, Kenisha A; Aburajab, Rayyan K; Robinson, Joshua F; Fisher, Susan J",Development,126,1

Treatment should be considered for symptomatic patients or for those at risk for complications, especially retroperitoneal bleeding which is correlated to tumor size, grade of the angiogenic component and to the presence of tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). This study reports our single-center experience with the use of selective arterial embolization (SAE) in the management of symptomatic and asymptomatic renal AMLs. METHODS In this retrospective mono-centric study, all demographic and imaging data, medical records, angiographic features, outpatient charts and follow-up visits of patients who underwent prophylactic or emergency SAE for AMLs between January 2005 and July 2016 were reviewed. Tumor size and treatment outcomes were assessed at baseline and after the procedure during follow-up. Computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or ultrasonography was used to evaluate AML shrinkage. Renal function was measured pre- and post-procedure. RESULTS Twenty-three patients (18 females, 5 males; median age, 45 years; range, 19-85 years) who underwent SAE either to treat bleeding AML (n=6) or as a prophylactic treatment (n=17) were included. Overall, 34 AMLs were embolized. TSC status was confirmed for 6 patients. Immediate technical success rate was 96% and 4 patients benefitted from an additional procedure. Major complications occurred in 3 patients and minor post-embolization syndrome (PES) in 14 patients. The mean AML size reduction rate was 26.2% after a mean follow-up was 20.5 months (range, 0.5-56 months), and only non-TSC status was significantly associated with better shrinkage of tumor (P=0.022). Intralesional aneurysms were significantly more frequent in patients with hemorrhagic presentation (P=0.008). There was no change in mean creatinine level after SAE. CONCLUSIONS SAE is a safe and effective technique to manage renal AMLs as a preventive treatment as well as in emergency setting, with significant reduction in tumor size during follow-up. A multidisciplinary approach remains fundamental, especially for TSC patients. In addition to size, the presence of intralesional aneurysms should be considered in any prophylactic treatment decision.","Bardin, Florian; Chevallier, Olivier; Bertaut, Aurélie; Delorme, Emmanuel; Moulin, Morgan; Pottecher, Pierre; Di Marco, Lucy; Gehin, Sophie; Mourey, Eric; Cormier, Luc; Mousson, Christiane; Midulla, Marco; Loffroy, Romaric",Quantitative imaging in medicine and surgery,126,1

With the advent of computer-aided design/manufacturing and customized craniofacial implants (CCIs), there seems to be more suited alternatives. In this study, the authors report their institutional experience and outcome using immediate, single-stage, CCI-based reconstruction for benign and malignant skull neoplasm defects. METHODS A retrospective review of a prospectively maintained database of all implant cranioplasties performed between 2011 and 2014, by a single craniofacial surgeon at a tertiary academic medical institution was performed. Preoperative and postoperative computed tomography scans with 3D reconstruction were performed for the purpose of assessing adequate resection and reconstructive outcomes. Primary endpoints included length of surgery, predicted defect versus postoperative implant surface area, contour irregularities, and complications. RESULTS Of the 108 patients with cranioplasty identified, 7 patients were found to undergo immediate CCI-based reconstruction for calvarial neoplasms; 4 patients (4/7, 57%) presented with malignant pathology. All defects were >5 cm2. As compared with their original size, all implants were modified intraoperatively between 0.2% and 40.8%, with a mean of 13.8%. With follow-up ranging between 1 and 16 months, there were no implant-related complications identified. The immediate and long-term aesthetic results, as well as patient satisfaction, were ideal. CONCLUSION With this preliminary experience, the authors have successfully demonstrated that immediate customized implant reconstructive techniques, by way of intraoperative modification, are both safe and feasible for benign and malignant skull neoplasms. The authors believe that with wider acceptance of this multidisciplinary approach and increased surgeon familiarity, this technique will soon become the reconstructive standard of care.","Berli, Jens U; Thomaier, Lauren; Zhong, Shuting; Huang, Judy; Quinones, Alfredo; Lim, Michael; Weingart, Jon; Brem, Henry; Gordon, Chad R",The Journal of craniofacial surgery,126,12

We present further analyses of the mortality and severe disability data from the Safety and Efficacy of NeuroFlo Technology in Ischemic Stroke trial. MATERIALS AND METHODS The Safety and Efficacy of NeuroFlo Technology in Ischemic Stroke trial was a multicenter, randomized, controlled trial that evaluated the safety and effectiveness of the NeuroFlo catheter in patients with stroke. The current analysis was performed on the as-treated population. All-cause and stroke-related mortality rates at 90 days were compared between groups, and logistic regression models were fit to obtain ORs and 95% CIs for the treated versus not-treated groups. We categorized death-associated serious adverse events as neurologic versus non-neurologic events and performed multiple logistic regression analyses. We analyzed severe disability and mortality by outcomes of the mRS. Patient allocation was gathered by use of a poststudy survey. RESULTS All-cause mortality trended in favor of treated patients (11.5% versus 16.1%; P = .079) and stroke-related mortality was significantly reduced in treated patients (7.5% versus 14.2%; P = .009). Logistic regression analysis for freedom from stroke-related mortality favored treatment (OR, 2.41; 95% CI, 1.22, 4.77; P = .012). Treated patients had numerically fewer neurologic causes of stroke-related deaths (52.9% versus 73.0%; P = .214). Among the 90-day survivors, nominally fewer treated patients were severely disabled (mRS 5) (5.6% versus 7.5%; OR, 1.72; 95% CI, 0.72, 4.14; P = .223). Differences in allocation of care did not account for the reduced mortality rates. CONCLUSIONS There were consistent reductions in all-cause and stroke-related mortality in the NeuroFlo-treated patients. This reduction in mortality did not result in an increase in severe disability.","Schellinger, P D; Shuaib, A; Köhrmann, M; Liebeskind, D S; Jovin, T; Hammer, M D; Sen, S; Huang, D Y; Solander, S; Gupta, R; Leker, R R; Saver, J L",AJNR.

OBJECTIVES It was our aim to compare the frequency of 8 relevant viruses in 109 hospitalized LRTI patients and 144 healthy controls. METHODS Virus infection was determined by seroconversion and ELISA for anti-virus antibodies in repeated serum samples. Bacterial infection was diagnosed in respiratory specimens, blood cultures and urine. RESULTS The LRTI patient cohort consisted of 49 patients with community-acquired pneumonia, 30 patients with acute bronchitis and 30 chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients with acute exacerbation. Viral infection was detected in 89 (82%) LRTI patients compared with 32 (22%) in healthy controls (relative risk 3.42, 95% confidence interval 2.48-4.72; p < 0.0001). The most frequent viral pathogens were: influenza B (23%), adenovirus (16%) and parainfluenza virus 3 (12%). Importantly, infections with more than 1 virus were detected in 63% (n = 57) of LRTI patients with viral infection, which represents 52% of all LRTI patients. No multiple virus infection was detected in the healthy controls. Patients with community-acquired pneumonia were more often infected with adenovirus and respiratory syncytial virus as compared with the other LRTI patients (p = 0.046 and 0.0009, respectively). CONCLUSIONS There is a high incidence of single and multiple viral infections in LRTI patients requiring hospitalization. The data indicate the need for regular virus diagnosis and the development of point of care tools that enables a fast diagnosis of the most common viruses and bacteria. The data also imply the need to consider antiviral therapy in positive LRTI cases.","Gencay, Mikael; Roth, Michael; Christ-Crain, Mirjam; Mueller, Beat; Tamm, Michael; Stolz, Daiana",Respiration; international review of thoracic diseases,126,4

We investigated the delay of IAT and factors associated with such delay. METHODS MR CLEAN was a randomized trial of IAT plus usual care versus usual care alone (n=500). With multivariable linear regression, we analyzed the effect of intravenous treatment, general anesthesia, off-hours and inter-hospital transfer on time to admission to the emergency department (ED) of the intervention center and time to treatment. Furthermore, we assessed compliance with a target of 75 min for time from ED to treatment, and calculated the potential absolute increase in the number of patients with a good outcome (modified Rankin Scale score ≤2) if this target had been achieved in all treated patients. RESULTS Inter-hospital transfer prolonged time to ED by 140 min (95% CI 129 to 150) but reduced time from ED to treatment by 77 min (95% CI 64 to 91). Time from ED to treatment was increased by 19 min by general anesthesia (95% CI 5 to 33) and total time was increased by 23 min during off-hours (95% CI 6 to 40). The in-hospital target was achieved in 11.5% (22/192) of patients. Full compliance with the target time of 75 min from ED to treatment would have increased the proportion of patients with a good outcome by 7.6% (95% CI 6.7% to 8.5%). CONCLUSION Inter-hospital transfer is an important cause of delay in the delivery of IAT and every effort should be made to avoid transfers and reduce transfer-related delay. Furthermore, in-hospital workflow should be optimized to improve functional outcome after IAT.","Venema, Esmee; Boodt, Nikki; Berkhemer, Olvert A; Rood, Pleunie P M; van Zwam, Wim H; van Oostenbrugge, Robert J; van der Lugt, Aad; Roos, Yvo B W E M; Majoie, Charles B L M; Lingsma, Hester F; Dippel, Diederik W J",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,126,19

METHODS A total of 268 patients who underwent LATG with Roux-en-Y reconstruction were included in this study. Two types of EJ were applied for LATG: conventional ETS EJ and SETE EJ. The surgical outcomes and postoperative complications were compared. RESULTS The mean reconstruction time in the SETE group was shorter than that in the ETS group (41.6 ± 8.0 min vs 51.3 ± 9.2 min, P = 0.000). The incidences of total EJ-related complications, EJ leakage, and EJ stricture in the SETE group and ETS group were 1.1% (1/92) and 10.2% (18/176), 1.1% (1/92) and 4.0% (7/176), and 0 and 6.2% (11/176), respectively. The incidence of total EJ-related complications in the SETE group was lower than that of the ETS group (P = 0.006), and the incidence of EJ stricture in the SETE group was lower than that of the ETS group (P = 0.034).

PROPOSE This study commits to providing a digital solution for precise bone augmentation in the field of oral implantology. MATERIALS AND METHODS After collecting the data of patients' intraoral scanning and DICOM (digital imaging and communications in medicine), the implant position is digitally designed, and the alveolar bone is digitally augmented around the ideal implant position. On the premise of ensuring that the thickness of labial bone is 2 mm, and there is sufficient alveolar bone 3 to 4 mm apically from the ideal gingival margin for implant placing, we carry out excessive augmentation of 0.5 and 1 mm on the labial bone and alveolar crest, respectively, to compensate for possible bone resorption after 6 months. After 3D printing the reconstructed alveolar bone model, the titanium mesh is trimmed and preformed on the alveolar bone model. Outcomes are reported in terms of mean values (5%-95% percentile values). RESULTS Thirty implant sites have accepted this novel virtually designed alveolar bone augmentation. Before the second-stage surgery, the average vertical bone gain was 2.48 mm (0.29-6.32), the average horizontal bone gain was 4.11 mm (1.19-8.74), the average height of the residual alveolar bone above the implant platform was 1.44 mm (0.59-2.92), the average thickness of the labial bone width at the implant platform was 2.00 mm (0.93-3.64), the average thickness of the labial bone width at 2 mm apically from the implant platform was 2.74 mm (1.40-5.46). The virtual augmentation of each tooth position was 349.41 mm3 (165.70-482.70), while the actual augmentation of each tooth position was 352.94 mm3 (159.24-501.78), the accuracy of the final actual augmentation reached 95.82% (range from 88.53% to 99.15%). CONCLUSION This case series suggests that a virtually digital guided bone regeneration (GBR) workflow is precise and controllable. The practicality, safety and effectiveness of this procedure needs to be compared to other bone augmentation procedures in randomized controlled trials.","Li, Songhang; Zhang, Tianxu; Zhou, Mi; Zhang, Xiaolin; Gao, Yang; Cai, Xiaoxiao",Clinical implant dentistry and related research,126,16

We aimed to describe drug utilization, disease progression, and adverse drug events of COVID-19. Methods A retrospective, single-center case series study enrolled 165 consecutive hospitalized COVID-19 patients who were followed up until March 25, 2020, from a designated hospital in Wuhan. Patients were grouped by a baseline degree of severity: non-severe and severe. An analytical study of drug utilization, disease progression, and adverse events (AEs) of COVID-19 was conducted. Results Of the 165 COVID-19 cases, antivirals, antibacterials, glucocorticoids, and traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) were administered to 92.7%, 98.8%, 68.5%, and 55.2% of patients, respectively. The total kinds of drugs administered to the severe subgroup [26, interquartile range (IQR) 18-39] were 11 more than the non-severe subgroup (15, IQR 10-24), regardless of comorbidities. The 2 most common combinations of medications in the 165 cases were 'antiviral therapy + glucocorticoids + TCM' (81, 49.1%) and 'antiviral therapy + glucocorticoids' (23, 13.9%). Compared with non-severe cases, severe cases received more glucocorticoids (88.5% vs. 66.2%, P=0.02), but less TCM (50.0% vs. 63.3%, P=0.20), and suffered a higher percentage of death (34.6% vs. 7.2%, P=0.001). At the end of the follow-up, 130 (78.8%) patients had been discharged, and 24 (14.5%) died. There were 13 patients (7.9%) who had elevated liver enzymes, and 49 patients (29.7%) presented with worsening kidney function during the follow-up. Conclusions Of the 165 COVID-19 patients, the fatality rate remained high (14.5%). Drug utilization for COVID-19 was diverse and generally complied with the existing guidelines. Combination regimens containing antiviral drugs might be beneficial to assist COVID-19 recovery. Additionally, liver and kidney AEs should not be ignored.","Sun, Feng; Kou, Hao; Wang, Shengfeng; Lu, Yun; Zhao, Houyu; Li, Wenjing; Zhou, Qingxin; Jiang, Qiaoli; Cheng, Yinchu; Yang, Kun; Zhuo, Lin; Xu, Yang; Wu, Dongfang; Zhan, Siyan; Cheng, Hong",Annals of translational medicine,126,5

The anticancer drugs chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxy CQ (HCQ) might inhibit tumor progression and invasiveness. However, the mechanism by which CQ and HCQ influence BC is undetermined. In this study, CQ and HCQ treatments inhibited the migration and invasion of two BC cell types (5637 and T24) through expression modulation of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2), which belongs to the matrix MMP family and is a key mediator of cancer progression. Moreover, additional data revealed that the migrative and invasive effects of BC cells treated with CQ or HCQ were abolished after treatment with rapamycin, which induces autophagy, demonstrating that CQ and HCQ functions in BC are based on autophagy inhibition. In conclusion, our research demonstrated that CQ and HCQ regulated cell motility in BC through MMP-2 downregulation by targeting autophagy functions, providing a novel therapeutic strategy for BC treatment.","Chou, Kuang-Yu; Chen, Po-Chun; Chang, An-Chen; Tsai, Te-Fu; Chen, Hung-En; Ho, Chao-Yen; Hwang, Thomas I-Sheng",Environmental toxicology,126,33

No randomized data are available regarding the safety and efficacy of endovascular therapy beyond 6 h from symptom onset. Aim The aim of the study is to demonstrate that, among patients with large vessel anterior circulation occlusion who have a favorable imaging profile on computed tomography perfusion or magnetic resonance imaging, endovascular therapy with a Food and Drug Administration 510 K-cleared mechanical thrombectomy device reduces the degree of disability three months post stroke. Design The study is a prospective, randomized, multicenter, phase III, adaptive, blinded endpoint, controlled trial. A maximum of 476 patients will be randomized and treated between 6 and 16 h of symptom onset. Procedures Patients undergo imaging with computed tomography perfusion or magnetic resonance diffusion/perfusion, and automated software (RAPID) determines if the Target Mismatch Profile is present. Patients who meet both clinical and imaging selection criteria are randomized 1:1 to endovascular therapy plus medical management or medical management alone. The individual endovascular therapist chooses the specific device (or devices) employed. Study outcomes The primary endpoint is the distribution of scores on the modified Rankin Scale at day 90.

This study aims to summarize the international experience of performance-based risk-sharing arrangements (PBRSAs) and identify the preconditions for a successful implementation of such schemes. Their implications for the Chinese healthcare market are discussed. METHODS A systematic literature review (in PubMed) was conducted to review the evidence on the nature and performance of PBRSAs in the past 10 years. Grey literature was searched for reports in government websites of the countries in scope. RESULTS The search identifies 463 records from PubMed and 3 additional records from other sources. Thirty-one publications are included in the final review. The following preconditions were identified to support a successful implementation of PBRSAs: (1) Identify meaningful and feasible outcome measurements; (2) Establish an effective and efficient data collection infrastructure; (3) Control of the implementation costs; (4) Develop governance and administrative infrastructure to allow delisting and rebate/refund; (5) Clarify personal data protection issues. CONCLUSIONS The implementation of PBRSAs has proven to be challenging. Although the Chinese healthcare system is not yet well equipped to implement such schemes, some recent changes may pave the way to successful PBRSAs for particular innovative products.","Xu, Weiwei; Wu, Jing",International journal of technology assessment in health care,126,30

The proposed approach, xDNN is using prototypes. Prototypes are actual training data samples (images), which are local peaks of the empirical data distribution called typicality as well as of the data density. This generative model is identified in a closed form and equates to the pdf but is derived automatically and entirely from the training data with no user- or problem-specific thresholds, parameters or intervention. The proposed xDNN offers a new deep learning architecture that combines reasoning and learning in a synergy. It is non-iterative and non-parametric, which explains its efficiency in terms of time and computational resources. From the user perspective, the proposed approach is clearly understandable to human users. We tested it on challenging problems as the classification of different lighting conditions for driving scenes (iROADS), object detection (Caltech-256, and Caltech-101), and SARS-CoV-2 identification via computed tomography scan (COVID CT-scans dataset). xDNN outperforms the other methods including deep learning in terms of accuracy, time to train and offers an explainable classifier.","Angelov, Plamen; Soares, Eduardo",Neural networks : the official journal of the International Neural Network Society,126,1

However, the challenges facing cancer interception for early detection and prevention include length bias in which current screening and surveillance approaches frequently miss rapidly progressing cancers that then present at advanced stages in the clinic with symptoms (underdiagnosis). In contrast, many early detection strategies detect benign conditions that may never progress to cancer during a lifetime, and the patient dies of unrelated causes (overdiagnosis). This challenge to cancer interception is believed to be due to the speed at which the neoplasm evolves, called length bias sampling; rapidly progressing cancers are missed by current early detection strategies. In contrast, slowly or non-progressing cancers or their precursors are selectively detected. This has led to the concept of cancer interception, which can be defined as active interception of a biological process that drives cancer development before the patient presents in the clinic with an advanced, symptomatic cancer. The solutions needed to advance strategies for cancer interception require assessing the rate at which the cancer evolves over time and space. This is an essential challenge that needs to be addressed by robust study designs including normal and non-progressing controls when known to be appropriate.","Reid, Brian J",Cellular and molecular gastroenterology and hepatology,126,20

JMV5038 was first characterized through physico-chemical tests and it exhibited high melting point and logP value, an important pH-sensitivity that led to the formation of well-identified degradation products at low pH, as well as a substantial solubility value in silylated castor oil (ICO). Then, JMV5038-loaded HNP were formulated through a thermostabilized emulsion process based on the sol-gel cross-linking of ICO. They showed high loading efficiency and their in vitro release kinetic assessed in a biorelevant PBS/octanol biphasic system showed a constant sustained release over one month. The cytotoxic activity and cytocompatibility of HNP were evaluated on A375 melanoma cells and NIH 3T3 cells, respectively.

This drug is characterized by a long half-life (more than 200 hours), a favorable safety profile, and an activity against a wide array of gram-positive organisms, including several strains of Staphylococci and Enterococci. METHODS In this study, we presented 3 cases of critically ill patients treated with dalbavancin. All patients were therapeutically monitored for plasma dalbavancin concentrations; ultrafiltrate dalbavancin concentrations were assessed in a patient undergoing continuous renal-replacement therapy. Dalbavancin concentrations were measured using a validated liquid chromatographic method coupled with mass spectrometry. RESULTS All 3 severely ill patients experiencing necrotizing fasciitis were successfully treated during the acute phase with dalbavancin. Dalbavancin clearance in patient 3 (0.334 L/h) was considerably increased compared with values measured in the other 2 patients (0.054 and 0.075 L/h) and with data reported in the literature (0.04-0.06 L/h). CONCLUSIONS Our case reports presented preliminary evidence that dalbavancin can be considered a therapeutic option for necrotizing fasciitis in intensive care unit patients.

We aim to develop a tool that incorporates clinical and imaging data to predict outcomes after endovascular therapy. METHODS In a derivation cohort of anterior circulation large vessel occlusion stroke patients treated with endovascular therapy within 8 hours from time last seen well (n=247), we performed logistic regression to identify independent predictors of good outcome (90-day modified Rankin Scale, 0-2). Factors were weighted based on β-coefficients to derive the Pittsburgh Outcomes After Stroke Thrombectomy (POST) score. POST was validated in an institutional endovascular database (University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, n=393) and the Diffusion-Weighted Imaging Evaluation for Understanding Stroke Evolution Study-2 (DEFUSE-2) data set (n=105), as well as in patients treated beyond 8 hours (n=194) and in octogenarians (n=111). RESULTS In the derivation cohort, independent predictors (P<0.1) of good outcome included 24- to 72-hour final infarct volume (in cm(3), P<0.001), age (years, P<0.001), and parenchymal hematoma types 1 and 2 (H, P=0.01). POST was calculated as age+0.5×final infarct volume+15×H. Patients with POST score <60 had a 91% chance of good outcome compared with 4% with POST score ≥120. POST accurately predicted good outcomes in the derivation (area under the curve [AUC]=0.85) and validation cohorts (University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, AUC=0.81; DEFUSE-2, AUC=0.86), as well as in patients treated beyond 8 hours (AUC, 0.85) and octogenarians (AUC=0.76). POST had better predictive accuracy for good and poor outcome than the ischemic stroke predictive risk score (iSCORE). CONCLUSIONS POST score is a validated predictor of outcome in patients with anterior circulation large vessel occlusions after endovascular therapy.","Rangaraju, Srikant; Liggins, John T P; Aghaebrahim, Amin; Streib, Christopher; Sun, Chung-Huan; Gupta, Rishi; Nogueira, Raul; Frankel, Michael; Mlynash, Michael; Lansberg, Maarten; Albers, Gregory; Jadhav, Ashutosh; Jovin, Tudor G",Stroke,126,12

This issue has become even more relevant since the outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and the necessity for minimum distances between passengers. We propose an approach that allows to dynamically navigate passengers around dangerously crowded stations to better distribute the passenger load across an entire urban public transport network. This is achieved through the introduction of new constraints into routing requests, that enable the avoidance of specific nodes in a network. These requests consider walks, bikes, metros, subways, trams and buses as possible modes of transportation. An implementation of the approach is provided in cooperation with the Munich Travel Corporation (MVG) for the city of Munich, to simulate the effects on a real city's urban traffic flow. Among other factors, the impact on the travel time was simulated given that the two major exchange points in the network were to be avoided. With an increase from 26.5 to 26.8 minutes on the average travel time, the simulation suggests that the time penalty might be worth the safety benefits.","Klinker, Jens; Selmi, Mohamed Hechem; Avezum, Mariana; Jonas, Stephan",Studies in health technology and informatics,126,1

The primary objective of this study was to identify the rates and predicting factors of unplanned 30-day readmissions at a community-based hospital. PATIENTS AND METHODS This study is a retrospective review of a single-center community-based hospital administrative and clinical records identifying unplanned readmissions. Risk factors for readmissions due to surgical site infections, pain, medical vs. procedure-related complications, and the number of readmissions were studied using multiple logistic regression analysis. RESULTS A total overall readmission rate was 7.3 % (79 readmissions for 1077 patients). The readmission rates for thoracolumbar and cervical surgeries were 5.5 % and 1.8 %, respectively. The mean duration to primary readmission was 11.4 + 8.5 days. The most common procedure-related complication diagnosed at readmittance was wound-related complications (26 readmissions, 32.9 %). The most common non-surgical complication was a drug reaction or overdose (10.1 %). Multivariate logistic regression analyses revealed that longer hospitalization was a highly significant predictor of wound-related complications, followed by discharge to home or home care, and lower ASA scores (all <0.048). A younger age predicted readmissions due to pain (p = 0.014) and longer OR time did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.079). Higher ASA scores predicted readmissions due to medical vs. surgical complications (p = 0.028). There were no statistically significant predictors identified for more than one readmission during the 30-day post-discharge period. CONCLUSIONS The overall rate of 30-day unplanned readmissions at a community-based hospital was 7.3 % for patients undergoing spinal surgeries and was similar to the rates reported by larger academic tertiary care institutions and registry-based studies. The study suggests that surgical site infections was the most common reason for readmissions, which was predictive by longer hospitalization, discharge disposition, and lower ASA scores.","Villavicencio, Alan; Rajpal, Sharad; Lee Nelson, E; Avoian, Samantha; Burneikiene, Sigita",Clinical neurology and neurosurgery,126,16

This method applied a network motif-based approach, combining a human signaling network and high-throughput gene expression data to distinguish breast cancer samples from normal samples. Our method has higher classification performance and better classification accuracy stability than the mutual information (MI) method or the individual gene sets method. It may become a useful tool for identifying and treating patients with breast cancer and other cancers, thus contributing to clinical diagnosis and therapy for these diseases.","Chen, Lina; Qu, Xiaoli; Cao, Mushui; Zhou, Yanyan; Li, Wan; Liang, Binhua; Li, Weiguo; He, Weiming; Feng, Chenchen; Jia, Xu; He, Yuehan",Scientific reports,126,1

However, despite numerous investigations, there are still debates on the organization of this brain region. In vivo neuroimaging techniques such as resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) can be used to define the functional circuitry of brain areas, producing results largely consistent with gold-standard invasive tract-tracing techniques and offering the opportunity for cross-species comparisons within the same modality. Our results using resting-state fMRI from macaque monkeys to uncover the intrinsic functional architecture of the LFC corroborate previous findings and inform current debates. Specifically, within the dorsal LFC, we show that 1) the region along the midline and anterior to the superior arcuate sulcus is divided in two areas separated by the posterior supraprincipal dimple, 2) the cytoarchitectonically defined area 6DC/F2 contains two connectional divisions, and 3) a distinct area occupies the cortex around the spur of the arcuate sulcus, updating what was previously proposed to be the border between dorsal and ventral motor/premotor areas. Within the ventral LFC, the derived parcellation clearly suggests the presence of distinct areas: 1) an area with a somatomotor/orofacial connectional signature (putative area 44), 2) an area with an oculomotor connectional signature (putative frontal eye fields), and 3) premotor areas possibly hosting laryngeal and arm representations. Our results illustrate in detail the intrinsic functional architecture of the macaque LFC, thus providing valuable evidence for debates on its organization.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Resting-state functional MRI is used as a complementary method to invasive techniques to inform current debates on the organization of the macaque lateral frontal cortex. Given that the macaque cortex serves as a model for the human cortex, our results help generate more fine-tuned hypothesis for the organization of the human lateral frontal cortex.","Goulas, Alexandros; Stiers, Peter; Hutchison, R Matthew; Everling, Stefan; Petrides, Michael; Margulies, Daniel S",Journal of neurophysiology,126,12

However, it can have severe adverse effects, such as rectal bleeding, perforation, and sepsis. PRESENTATION OF CASE We report the case of a healthy 28-year-old man who presented to the emergency department with sudden-onset diffuse abdominal pain and hematochezia. He had undergone stapled hemorrhoidopexy 5days earlier and was discharged after an uneventful postoperative course. For the present condition, after immediate evaluation, we successfully performed emergency laparoscopic repair of the rectal perforation without any stoma. His postoperative course was uneventful, and he was discharged on postoperative day 16. DISCUSSION This is a rare case of rectal perforation after stapled hemorrhoidopexy in which the perforation was treated successfully by laparoscopic repair. In most cases of rectal perforation following stapled hemorrhoidopexy, surgeons perform open laparotomy and create diverting stoma. However, our patient underwent totally laparoscopic lavage and primary closure without diverting stoma. Multiple investigators have reported that laparoscopic lavage for perforated diverticulitis may be an appropriate treatment option. Factors favoring this approach include early surgery, young age, sufficient irrigation, and meticulous primary closure. CONCLUSION Stapled hemorrhoidopexy can have severe adverse effects, such as rectal bleeding, pelvic sepsis, and rectal perforation, which are potentially life-threatening. Laparoscopic lavage and primary repair without stoma can be performed successfully in select patients with rectal perforation following stapled hemorrhoidopexy.","Ryu, Seokyong; Bae, Byung-Noe",International journal of surgery case reports,126,15

However, little is known about the genetic diversity, evolution, and patterns of viral transmission during mass gatherings, particularly how much diversity is generated by in situ transmission compared to that imported from other locations. Here, we describe the genome-scale evolution of influenza A viruses sampled from the Hajj pilgrimages at Makkah during 2013 to 2015. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the diversity of influenza viruses at the Hajj pilgrimages was shaped by multiple introduction events, comprising multiple cocirculating lineages in each year, including those that have circulated in the Middle East and those whose origins likely lie on different continents. At the scale of individual hosts, the majority of minor variants resulted from de novo mutation, with only limited evidence of minor variant transmission or minor variants circulating at subconsensus level despite the likely identification of multiple transmission clusters. Together, these data highlight the complexity of influenza virus infection at the Hajj pilgrimages, reflecting a mix of global genetic diversity drawn from multiple sources combined with local transmission, and reemphasize the need for vigilant surveillance at mass gatherings.IMPORTANCE Large population sizes and densities at mass gatherings such as the Hajj (Makkah, Saudi Arabia) can contribute to outbreaks of respiratory virus infection by providing local hot spots for transmission followed by spread to other localities. Using a genome-scale analysis, we show that the genetic diversity of influenza A viruses at the Hajj gatherings during 2013 to 2015 was largely shaped by the introduction of multiple viruses from diverse geographic regions, including the Middle East, with only little evidence of interhost virus transmission at the Hajj and seemingly limited spread of subconsensus mutational variants. The diversity of viruses at the Hajj pilgrimages highlights the potential for lineage cocirculation during mass gatherings, in turn fuelling segment reassortment and the emergence of novel variants, such that the continued surveillance of respiratory pathogens at mass gatherings should be a public health priority.","Cobbin, Joanna C A; Alfelali, Mohammad; Barasheed, Osamah; Taylor, Janette; Dwyer, Dominic E; Kok, Jen; Booy, Robert; Holmes, Edward C; Rashid, Harunor",Journal of virology,126,19

DESIGN Prospective cohort study METHODS: Ninety-one eyes of 91 patients with narrow angles were consecutively enrolled in this prospective interventional study. All patients were classified into primary angle-closure suspect (PACS), primary angle-closure (PAC) and primary angle-closure glaucoma (PACG). If both eyes were eligible, one eye was randomly selected for study inclusion. ACV, ACD and ACA were evaluated using Scheimpflug imaging technology at three time points: at baseline (T0), 45 min after application of pilocarpine before LPI (T1) and at one-month post-LPI (T2). RESULTS PACS, PAC and PACG groups included 25 (27.4%), 24 (26.3%) and 42 (46.1%) eyes, respectively. At both time points T1 and T2, mean pupil diameter, ACV and ACA changed significantly (P = 0.00). In all subgroups, ACD decreased significantly at T1 and then increased significantly at T2. ACA was widened by 6 degrees in angles < 26 degrees as compared to 3 degrees in > 26 degrees eyes. In PACG group, mean ACV increased significantly between T0 and T2 (P = 0.0). Other parameters like mean cornea volume (P = 0.27), central corneal thickness (P = 0.29) showed no significant change between time points (T0, T1 and T2). Pilocarpine instillation caused a significant increase in ACA, ACV and ACD CONCLUSION: Scheimpflug imaging detected significant changes in ACD post-LPI and post-pilocarpine in all groups.

This paper presents a novel body contouring device which uses pulsed, vacuum-assisted non-focused ultrasound. OBJECTIVE To evaluate the clinical safety and efficacy of the vacuum-assisted acoustic wave technology for circumference reduction of the abdominal region. METHODS Eighteen healthy women with a BMI under 25 underwent four 20-minute fat reduction treatments in the abdominal region, at 1-week intervals. Efficacy was evaluated by the change in abdominal circumference up to 12 weeks post-treatment relative to baseline and by comparison of before and after photos by two blinded evaluators. Subjects rated their satisfaction with the treatment procedure and outcomes. Safety was evaluated by adverse events, local skin reaction, and pain assessments. RESULTS One week after the final session, the mean reductions in abdominal circumference measured 5.4±2.6 cm. At 1 month after the last session, the cumulative reduction in circumference was 5.8±3.2 cm. Measurements take at 3 months after the last treatment showed abdominal circumferences decrease of an average 5.2±3.1 cm relative to baseline measures. All patients reported a painless procedure and there were no treatment-induced severe adverse events. Most patients reported a positive change in body contour, with all subjects saying they would highly recommend the treatment to others. Assessments performed by blinded evaluators ranked 6 cases as very to extremely improved and an additional 7 cases as somewhat improved. No dramatic weight fluctuations were recorded. CONCLUSIONS This study demonstrates that a 4-treatment course with an acoustic wave ultrasound applicator with 1-week intervals, leads to a significant reduction in abdominal circumference, lasting up to at least 3 months with no pain or side effects reported.","Verner, Ines",Dermatologic therapy,126,27

However, it is controversial whether endometriomas should be surgically removed before assisted reproduction technology. Our purpose was to evaluate whether surgical stripping of endometriomas in subfertile women improves the chance of a live birth. Secondary outcomes were impact on ovarian reserve and pain. MATERIAL AND METHODS We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis with results reported in accordance to the PRISMA guidelines. A summary of findings table was developed using GRADE. We searched Medline and Embase. Two reviewers performed the screening. RESULTS Of 686 manuscripts, we included one randomized controlled trial and nine retrospective cohort studies, mostly of low quality. The odds ratio for live birth after surgery [compared with conservative management before in vitro fertilization (IVF)/intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI)] was 0.87 (95% CI 0.64-1.18, six studies, I2 = 3%; ⨁◯◯◯, VERY LOW quality). The mean difference of antral follicle count was -2.09 (95% CI -4.84 to 0.67, four studies). No difference was observed regarding antral follicle count between the two groups (MD -2.09, 95% CI -4.84 to 0.67, four studies, ⨁◯◯◯, VERY LOW quality). Pain outcome was not reported in the included studies. CONCLUSION The very low quality evidence suggests no difference in odds ratio of live birth between women who underwent surgery for endometriomas before IVF/ICSI compared with conservative management.

Opiate-based pain regimens remain the cornerstone of rib fracture management; however, concerns around opioids have fostered interest in alternative analgesics. Ketamine is currently being used in lieu of opioids, but little evidence exists supporting its use within the trauma population. METHODS A prospective, randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trial of adult patients with three or more rib fractures admitted to a Level I trauma center was conducted. Exclusion criteria included age older than 64 years, Glasgow Coma Scale score less than 13, and chronic opiate use. The experimental arm received low-dose ketamine (LDK) at 2.5 μg·kg·min while the placebo cohort received an equivalent rate of 0.9% normal saline. All infusions were continued for 48 hours. The primary outcome was reduction in numeric pain score (NPS) during the first 24 hours. Secondary outcomes studied included oral morphine equivalent (OME) utilization, length of stay, epidural rates, pulmonary complications, and adverse events. RESULTS Forty-five (49%) of 91 patients were randomized to the experimental arm. Both groups were similar in makeup. Overall, 74.7% were male, had a median age of 49 years, and an Injury Severity Score (ISS) of 14. Low-dose ketamine was not associated with a significant reduction in 24-hour NPS or OME totals. Subgroup analysis of 45 severely injured patients (ISS, >15) demonstrated that LDK was associated with a significant reduction in OME utilization during the first 24 hours (35.7 vs. 68, p = 0.03), 24 hours to 48 hours (64.2 vs. 96, p = 0.03), and overall (152.1 vs. 198, p = 0.048). No difference in other secondary outcomes or adverse events was noted. CONCLUSION Low-dose ketamine failed to decrease NPS or OME within the overall cohort, but a decrease in OME was observed among patients with an ISS greater than 15. Confirmatory studies are necessary to determine if LDK is a useful adjunct among severely injured patients.

The aim of this study was to identify risk factors for weight gain during short-, middle- and long-term treatment with antipsychotic drugs in this young population. We analysed a combined prospective and a retrospective observational cohort of Dutch children and adolescents, starting with risperidone, aripiprazole or pipamperone treatment. Linear mixed models were used to test whether sex, age, baseline body-mass-index (BMI) z score, type of antipsychotic, dose equivalent/kg, duration of use, previous antipsychotic use, ethnicity, physical exercise, IQ, concomitant medication, and psychiatric classification predicted the BMI z score for a follow-up of < 15 weeks, 15-52 weeks or > 52 weeks. A total of 144 patients were included with a median [interquartile range ([IQR)] age of 9 (4) years and median follow-up of 30 (73) weeks. During the complete follow-up, the median (IQR) weight gain was 0.37 (0.95) BMI z score points. Antipsychotic-induced weight gain was found to be most pronounced during the first 15 weeks of use (BMI z score increase per week β = 0.02, 95% CI 0.01-0.03, p = 0.002). A higher baseline BMI z score and the absence of stimulant use were associated with a higher BMI z score during the entire follow-up and after 15 weeks, respectively. Previous treatment with an antipsychotic drug was associated with less weight gain during the first 15 weeks of treatment. Our findings underscore the importance of close patient monitoring during the first weeks of antipsychotic treatment with a focus on patients with a high baseline BMI z score.","van der Esch, Casper C L; Kloosterboer, Sanne M; van der Ende, Jan; Reichart, Catrien G; Kouijzer, Mirjam E J; de Kroon, Matthias M J; van Daalen, Emma; Ester, Wietske A; Rieken, Rob; Dieleman, Gwen C; Hillegers, Manon H J; van Gelder, Teun; Koch, Birgit C P; Dierckx, Bram",European child & adolescent psychiatry,126,27

High perceived stress levels endanger physical and mental health and affect work efficiency and patient safety. Therefore, it is urgent to understand the perceived stress levels of medical staff and explore its risk factors. We recruited 600 medical staff from the radiology departments of 32 public hospitals in Sichuan Province, China, to evaluate perceived stress scores via a mobile app-based questionnaire. The results showed that the perceived stress level among medical staff in the radiology departments during the COVID-19 outbreak was high and a sense of tension was strongly present. A positive correlation was found between anxiety score and perceived stress. Multivariate analysis showed that risk factors for perceived stress were female, existing anxiety, and fears of being infected at work, an uncontrollable outbreak, and not being able to pay rent or mortgage. Conversely, good knowledge about COVID-19, being unmarried, and working in a higher-grade hospital were protective factors for perceived stress. Therefore, more attention should be given to medical staff in the radiology departments that present the risk factors outlined above. Timely risk assessment of psychological stress and effective intervention measures should be taken for these high-risk groups to keep their perceived stress within normal limits.","Huang, Lei; Wang, Yun; Liu, Juan; Ye, Pengfei; Chen, Xijian; Xu, Huayan; Guo, Yingkun; Qu, Haibo; Ning, Gang","Psychology, health & medicine",126,31

METHODS A review of patients who underwent radical hysterectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy for invasive cervical cancer between 1990 and 2006 was performed. On the basis of body mass index (BMI) (calculated as weight [kg]/[height (m)](2)), women were categorized as normal weight (BMI 18.5-24.9), overweight (BMI 25.0-29.9), obese (BMI 30.0-34.9), or morbidly obese (BMI at least 35.0). RESULTS Four hundred eight women met the inclusion criteria. Of these, 155 (38%) were normal weight, 126 (31%) were overweight, 77 (19%) were obese, and 50 (12%) were morbidly obese. There were no statistically significant differences between these four groups in age, Charlson comorbidity score, smoking history, stage, histologic grade or subtype, tumor size, depth of invasion, transfusion rate, operative time, or intraoperative complications. Higher BMI was significantly correlated with higher estimated operative blood loss (P=.001). There were no statistically significant differences between the groups in pathologic findings, length of postoperative hospital stay, postoperative complications, readmission rate, or proportion of women receiving adjuvant radiotherapy. At a median follow-up time of 64 months, there were no differences between groups in rates of recurrence or death from disease. CONCLUSION Radical hysterectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy is feasible for obese and morbidly obese women with cervical cancer. Obesity alone should not be a contraindication to radical hysterectomy in women with cervical cancer.","Frumovitz, Michael; Sun, Charlotte C; Jhingran, Anuja; Schmeler, Kathleen M; Dos Reis, Ricardo; Milam, Michael R; Soliman, Pamela T; Taylor, Kristal; Ramirez, Pedro T",Obstetrics and gynecology,126,28

We investigated whether nasal rather than intrapulmonary application of Protollin, a mucosal adjuvant composed of TLR2 and TLR4 ligands, is sufficient to elicit protection against murine allergic lower airway disease. Wild-type, Tlr2(-/-), or Tlr4(-/-) BALB/c mice were sensitized to a birch pollen allergen extract (BPEx), then received either intranasal or intrapulmonary administrations of Protollin or Protollin admixed with BPEx, followed by consecutive daily BPEx challenges. Nasal application of Protollin or Protollin admixed with BPEx was sufficient to inhibit allergic lower airway disease with minimal collateral lung inflammation. Inhibition was dependent on TLR4 and was associated with the induction of ICOS in cells of the nasal mucosa and on both CD4+Foxp3+ and CD4+Foxp3- T cells of the draining lymph nodes (LNs), as well as their recruitment to the lungs. Adoptive transfer of cervical LN CD4+ICOS+, but not CD4+ICOS-, cells inhibited BPEx-induced airway hyperresponsiveness and bronchoalveolar lavage eosinophilia. Thus, our data indicate that expansion of resident ICOS-expressing CD4+ T cells of the cervical LNs by nasal mucosal TLR4 stimulation may inhibit the development of allergic lower airway disease in mice.","Shalaby, Karim H; Jo, Taisuke; Nakada, Emily; Allard-Coutu, Alexandra; Tsuchiya, Kimitake; Hirota, Nobuaki; Qureshi, Salman T; Maghni, Karim; Rioux, Clément R; Martin, James G",Journal of immunology,126,8

In this study, we investigated the mechanistic basis of variability in oral absorption of a model hydrophobic compound with pH-dependent solubility, BMS-955829, after oral dosing in rats, dogs, and cynomolgus monkeys. The contribution of regional absorption to pharmacokinetic variability was assessed in ported monkeys by direct intraduodenal and intraileal administration. The effect of BMS-955829 on gastric emptying and intestinal motility was investigated by radiography after co-administration of barium. BMS-955829 exhibited species dependent oral bioavailability, with high variability in monkeys. During regional absorption studies, highest rate of drug absorption was observed after direct intraduodenal administration. Radiography studies indicated that BMS-955829 slowed gastric emptying and intestinal motility. The effect of rate and site of drug release on oral exposure was studied using different drug product formulations. Reducing the rate of drug release reduced oral exposure variability without compromising exposure in cynomolgus monkeys. This effect was likely mediated by avoidance of rapid initial absorption and drug effect on gastric emptying and intestinal transit within the biorelevant timeframe. Thus, drug release rate can modulate the effect of physiological factors on variability in the oral absorption of sensitive compounds.","Narang, Ajit S; Balakrishnan, Anand; Morrison, John; Li, Jinjiang; Wang, Jennifer; Gu, Huidong; Taylor, Katrina; Santone, Kenneth; Ehrmann, Jon; Beyer, Sophie; Lu, Xujin; Ketner, Rod; Pizzano, Jennifer; Orcutt, Tami; Shields, Eric; Dulac, Heidi; Aborn, Sharon; Batchelder, Margaret; Lentz, Kimberley",European journal of pharmaceutics and biopharmaceutics : official journal of Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Pharmazeutische Verfahrenstechnik e.V,126,19

However, studies in rodent models directly testing the activity of ARB treatment on behavior and AD-relevent pathology including neuroinflammation, Aβ levels, and cerebrovascular function, have produced mixed results. APOE4 is a major genetic risk factor for AD and has been linked to many of the same functions as those purported to be modulated by ARB treatment. Therefore, evaluating the effects of ARB treatment on behavior and AD-relevant pathology in mice that express human APOE4 could provide important information on whether to further develop ARBs for AD therapy. In this study, we treated female and male mice that express the human APOE4 gene in the absence (E4FAD-) or presence (E4FAD+) of high Aβ levels with the ARB prodrug candesartan cilexetil for a duration of 4 months. Compared to vehicle, candesartan treatment resulted in greater memory-relevant behavior and higher hippocampal presynaptic protein levels in female, but not male, E4FAD- and E4FAD+ mice. The beneficial effects of candesartan in female E4FAD- and E4FAD+ mice occurred in tandem with lower GFAP and Iba1 levels in the hippocampus, whereas there were no effects on markers of cerebrovascular function and Aβ levels. Collectively, these data imply that the effects of ARBs on AD-relevant pathology may be modulated in part by the interaction between APOE genotype and biological sex. Thus, the further development of ARBs could provide therapeutic options for targeting neuroinflammation in female APOE4 carriers.","Scheinman, Sarah B; Zaldua, Steve; Dada, Adedoyin; Krochmaliuk, Kateryna; Dye, Katherine; Marottoli, Felecia M; Thatcher, Gregory R J; Tai, Leon M",Frontiers in neuroscience,126,28

Staff symptoms, previous swab testing, and antibody prevalence were correlated with patient admissions to investigate this assumption. DESIGN Cross-sectional study. SETTING A large critical care department in a tertiary-care teaching hospital in London, United Kingdom. SUBJECTS Staff working in critical care. INTERVENTIONS None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Participants completed a questionnaire and provided a serum sample for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 antibody testing over a 3-day period in April 2020. We compared the timing of symptoms in staff to the coronavirus disease 2019 patient admissions to critical care. We also identified factors associated with antibody detection. Of 625 staff, 384 (61.4%) reported previous symptoms and 124 (19.8%) had sent a swab for testing. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 infection had been confirmed in 37 of those swabbed (29.8%). Overall, 21% (131/625) had detectable severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 antibody, of whom 9.9% (13/131) had been asymptomatic. The peak onset of symptoms among staff occurred 2 weeks before the peak in coronavirus disease 2019 patient admissions. Staff who worked in multiple departments across the hospital were more likely to be seropositive. Staff with a symptomatic household contact were also more likely to be seropositive at 31.3%, compared with 16.2% in those without (p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS Staff who developed coronavirus disease 2019 were less likely to have caught it from their patients in critical care. Other staff, other areas of the hospital, and the wider community are more likely sources of infection. These findings indicate that personal protective equipment was effective at preventing transmission from patients. However, staff also need to maintain protective measures away from the bedside.","El Bouzidi, Kate; Pirani, Tasneem; Rosadas, Carolina; Ijaz, Samreen; Pearn, Matthew; Chaudhry, Shehnila; Patel, Sameer; Sureda-Vives, Macià; Fernandez, Natalia; Khan, Maryam; Cherepanov, Peter; McClure, Myra O; Tedder, Richard S; Zuckerman, Mark",Critical care medicine,126,16

However, molecular mechanisms underlying the autoimmunity remain to be fully elucidated. Even though toll-like receptors (TLRs) and Nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like2 (Nrf2) pathways are implicated in autoimmune diseases (ADs), interplay of OS, TLR and Nrf2 in TCE-mediated autoimmune response remains unexplored. This study was, therefore, undertaken to clearly establish a link among OS, TLR4 and Nrf2 pathways in TCE-induced autoimmunity. Groups of female MRL+/+ mice were treated with TCE, sulforaphane (SFN, an antioxidant) or TCE + SFN (TCE, 10 mmol/kg, i.p., every 4th day; SFN, 8 mg/kg, i.p., every other day) for 6 weeks. TCE exposure led to greater formation of serum 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE)-protein adducts, HNE-specific circulating immune complexes (CICs) and protein carbonyls which were associated with significant increases in serum antinuclear antibodies (ANAs). Moreover, incubation of splenocytes from TCE-treated mice with HNE-modified proteins resulted in enhanced splenocyte proliferation and cytokine release evidenced by increased expression of cyclin D3, Cyclin-dependent kinase 6 (CDK6) and phospho-pRb as well as increased release of IL-6, TNF-α and INF-γ. More importantly, TCE exposure resulted in increased expression of TLR4, MyD88, IRAK4, NF-kB and reduced expression of Nrf2 and HO-1 in the spleen. Remarkably, SFN supplementation not only attenuated TCE-induced OS, upregulation in TLR4 and NF-kB signaling and downregulation of Nrf2, but also ANA levels. These results, in addition to providing further support to a role of OS, also suggest that an interplay among OS, TLR4 and Nrf2 pathways contributes to TCE-mediated autoimmune response. Attenuation of TCE-mediated autoimmunity by SFN provides an avenue for preventive and/or therapeutic strategies for ADs involving OS.","Wang, Gangduo; Wang, Hui; Banerjee, Nivedita; Khan, M Firoze",Toxicology and applied pharmacology,126,1

Professional medical societies endorse LARC use in AYAs and, more recently, have emphasized the importance of using a reproductive justice framework when providing LARC. This article reviews reproductive justice, discusses contraceptive coercion, examines bias, and highlights interventions that promote equitable reproductive healthcare. RECENT FINDINGS Research indicates that both bias and patient characteristics influence provider LARC practices. AYA access to comprehensive LARC services is limited, as counseling, provision, management, and removal are not offered at all sites providing reproductive healthcare to AYAs. Interventions aimed at addressing provider bias and knowledge, clinic policies, confidentiality concerns, insurance reimbursement, and systems of oppression can improve AYA access to equitable, comprehensive contraceptive care. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated inequities in reproductive healthcare, as well as provided unique innovations to decrease barriers, including telemedicine LARC services. SUMMARY Clinicians who care for AYAs should honor reproductive autonomy by approaching contraceptive services with a reproductive justice lens. This includes implementing patient-centered contraceptive counseling, increasing access to LARC, eliminating barriers to LARC removal, and committing to systemic changes to address healthcare inequities.","Bryson, Amanda; Koyama, Atsuko; Hassan, Areej",Current opinion in pediatrics,126,1

METHODS Parents were recruited using purposive sampling. Interviews were conducted with English- or Spanish-speaking parents with a full term newborn and regular access to a car. Interviews were conducted by phone, and recorded and transcribed verbatim. Interviews were conducted until thematic saturation was reached. Data were organized for analysis using Atlas.ti, and codes grouped by theme using constant comparison. RESULTS 30 parents were enrolled. Barriers and facilitators to optimal CRS use were classified into three themes, as were thoughts on the pros and cons regarding remote car seat checks. Themes on barriers and facilitators included motor vehicle and CRS features (such as age and size of the motor vehicle and presence of the Lower Anchors and Tethers for Children LATCH system), resources (availability, accessibility, and accuracy of resources), and parental factors (parental emotions and characteristics). Themes related to pros and cons of remote car seat checks included the ability (and challenge) of remote car seat checks to identify and correct errors, the potential use of remote car seat checks in certain situations (such as CRS transitions and periods of growth), and convenience of remote car seat checks (including increased availability and ease of access). Subthemes with further detail were arranged within each theme identified. CONCLUSION From a parent perspective, there are several identified barriers and facilitators of optimal CRS use. Although car seat checks were identified as a resource, in-person accessibility was an issue, and there were mixed opinions on technology-assisted remote car seat checks. These results provide a foundation for additional study on targeted interventions, including remote interventions for which there is an increased need due to the COVID-19 pandemic.","Kendi, Sadiqa; Howard, Mary Beth; Mohamed, Mohamed A; Eaddy, Samuel; Chamberlain, James M",Traffic injury prevention,126,1

This is predicted to impact the visual ecology of many organisms, affecting both their intra- and interspecific interactions. Here, we show the effects of different artificial light sources on multiple aspects of hawkmoth visual ecology, including their perception of floral signals for pollination, the potential for intraspecific sexual signalling, and the effectiveness of their visual defences against avian predators. Light sources fall into three broad categories: some that prevent use of chromatic signals for these behaviours, others that more closely mimic natural lighting conditions, and, finally, types whose effects vary with light intensity and signal colour. We find that Phosphor Converted (PC) amber LED lighting - often suggested to be less harmful to nocturnal insects - falls into this third disruptive group, with unpredictable consequences for insect visual ecology depending on distance from the light source and the colour of the objects viewed. The diversity of impacts of artificial lighting on hawkmoth visual ecology alone argues for a nuanced approach to outdoor lighting in environmentally sensitive areas, employing intensities and spectra designed to limit those effects of most significant concern.","Briolat, Emmanuelle S; Gaston, Kevin J; Bennie, Jonathan; Rosenfeld, Emma J; Troscianko, Jolyon",Nature communications,126,19

Presence of tandem occlusions may hamper intracranial access and potentially increases the risk of procedural complications of endovascular treatment (EVT). Our aim was to assess neurological, functional and technical outcome and complications of EVT for intracranial LVO in patients with CAD in comparison to patients with ACAO and to patients without CAD or ACAO. Methods: We analyzed data of the MR CLEAN trial intervention arm and MR CLEAN Registry, acquired in 16 Dutch EVT-centers. Primary outcome was the change in stroke severity by comparing the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score at 24-48 h after treatment vs. baseline. Secondary outcomes included reperfusion rate and symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH). We compared outcomes and complications between patients with CAD vs. patients with ACAO and patients without CAD or ACAO. Results: In total, we identified 74 (4.7%) patients with CAD, 92 (5.9%) patients with ACAO and 1398 (89.4%) patients without CAD or ACAO. Neurological improvement at short-term after EVT in patients with CAD was significantly better compared to ACAO (resp. mean -5 vs. mean -1 NIHSS point; p = 0.03) and did not differ compared to patients without CAD or ACAO (-4 NIHSS points; p = 0.62). Rates of successful reperfusion in patients with CAD (47%) was comparable to patients with ACAO (47%; p = 1.00), but was less often achieved compared to patients without CAD or ACAO (58%; p = 0.08). Occurrence of sICH did not differ significantly between CAD patients (5%) and ACAO (11%; p = 0.33) or without CAD/ACAO (6%; p = 1.00). Conclusion: EVT in patients with intracranial LVO due to CAD results in neurological improvement comparable to patients without tandem occlusions. Therefore, carotid artery dissection by itself should not be a contraindication for endovascular treatment in stroke patients with intracranial large vessel occlusion. Although more challenging endovascular procedures are to be suspected in both patients with CAD or ACAO, accurate distinction between CAD and ACAO might influence clinical decision making as better clinical outcome can be expected in patients with CAD.","Compagne, Kars C J; Goldhoorn, R B; Uyttenboogaart, Maarten; van Oostenbrugge, Robert J; van Zwam, Wim H; van Doormaal, Pieter J; Dippel, Diederik W J; van der Lugt, Aad; Emmer, Bart J; van Es, Adriaan C G M",Frontiers in neurology,126,1

MATERIAL AND METHODS March 11 is considered as the beginning of COVID-19 and, changes in the number of the outpatient clinic examinations, non-surgical procedures, and surgery in the 8-week period before and during the pandemic were evaluated by weeks. Age, gender, and comorbid diseases of the operated patients were compared statistically. The symptoms, complaints, mortality, and morbidity conditions of the patients were recorded by contacting them. Descriptive data and chi-square test were used. RESULTS The number of COVID-19 cases has been reported as 8,916 for the hospital, 88,412 for the city and 150,593 for the country. The mean age of the operated patients before and after 11 March was 51 and 47, and comorbidities were 79 and 40, respectively, and there was no statistically significant difference(p<0.05). The number of patients examined was 2,309 and 868, the number of operated patients 173 and 94, the number of patients undergoing non-surgical procedures were 371 and 174, respectively. The names and numbers of surgical and non-surgical procedures are listed according to European Association of Urology (EAU) priority classification. In follow-up, no complication because of COVID-19 was observed in any patient. CONCLUSION Our study showed that, although the numbers have decreased, similar operations can be performed in daily urology practice without any contamination and mortality during the pandemic compared to the prepandemic period, by taking precautions and following the algorithms.","Soytaş, Mustafa; Boz, Mustafa Yücel; Güzelburç, Vahit; Çalık, Gökhan; Horuz, Rahim; Akbulut, Ziya; Albayrak, Selami",Turkish journal of urology,126,23

Adolescent depression screening might miss those with unidentified suicide risk. Our primary objective in this study was to compare the magnitude of positive screen results across different approaches. METHODS From June 2019 to October 2020, 803 mostly Medicaid-enrolled adolescents aged ≥12 years with no recent history of depression or self-harm were screened with the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 Modified for Adolescents (PHQ-9A) and the Ask Suicide-Screening Questions (ASQ) across 12 primary care practices. Two PHQ-9A screening strategies were evaluated: screening for any type of depression or other mental illness (positive on any item) or screening for major depressive disorder (MDD) (total score ≥10). RESULTS Overall, 56.4% of patients screened positive for any type of depression, 24.7% screened positive for MDD, and 21.1% screened positive for suicide risk. Regardless of PHQ-9A screening strategy, the ASQ identified additional subjects (eg, 2.2% additional cases compared with screening for any type of depression or other mental illness and 8.3% additional cases compared with screening positive for MDD). Of those with ≥6 month follow-up, 22.9% screened positive for any type of depression (n = 205), 35.6% screened positive for MDD (n = 90), and 42.7% with a positive ASQ result (n = 75) had a depression or self-harm diagnosis or an antidepressant prescription. CONCLUSIONS Suicide risk screening identifies cases not identified by depression screening. In this study, we underscore opportunities and challenges in primary care related to the high prevalence of depression and suicide risk. Research is needed regarding optimal screening strategies and to help clinicians manage the expected number of screening-identified adolescents.","Kemper, Alex R; Hostutler, Cody A; Beck, Kristen; Fontanella, Cynthia A; Bridge, Jeffrey A",Pediatrics,126,16

Methods We conducted the second of a series of online surveys via SurveyMonkey.com of people with COPD between May 1, 2020 and May 31, 2020. Frequency, percent, and Fisher's exact test (two-sided) were calculated using SPSS version 26. Results More than half of respondents (157, 64%), indicated that they started using telemedicine in 2020. Forty-seven percent of respondents had at least one exacerbation since January 1, 2020. Respondents who had at least one exacerbation in 2020 were more likely to start using telemedicine in 2020 than respondents who did not report any exacerbation in 2020 (75.7% versus 54.3%, p < 0.001). Respondents reporting a 2020 exacerbation indicated significantly higher avoidance of emergency healthcare since the pandemic began (27.8%) as compared to those who did not have an exacerbation in 2020 (10.1%), p < 0.001. Conclusions In response to social distancing and other COVID-19 precautions, people with COPD are avoiding traditional, in-person health care environments and turning to telemedicine to prevent and manage exacerbations.

Besides conventional approaches, CytoSorb® hemoadsorption might be another treatment option. We report on an 81-year-old female patient treated in our intensive care unit (ICU) with severe digitoxin intoxication, acute renal failure, and urinary tract infection (UTI). As physiological digitoxin elimination kinetics are known to appear slow, and also in regard to the renal failure, the decision was made to initiate continuous renal replacement therapy combined with CytoSorb hemoadsorption. The patient was hemodynamically stabilized within the first 4 h of treatment and initially required catecholamines to be stopped within 24 h of treatment. Pre- and post-adsorber drug level measurements showed a rapid elimination of digitoxin. Antibiotic treatment with piperacillin/tazobactam was initiated, and despite CytoSorb hemoadsorption therapy and its known potential to reduce plasma concentrations of several drugs, the UTI was successfully treated. After 3 days of CytoSorb treatment, digitoxin plasma levels were stable and almost normalized, and no clinical signs of intoxication were present. Five days after presentation, the patient was transferred from the ICU in a stable condition. CytoSorb hemoadsorption may be an easily available, efficient, and less cost-intensive therapy option than treatment with the Fab fragment, which is the currently recommended therapy for digitalis intoxications. Therefore, the use of CytoSorb might represent an alternative treatment for life-threatening complications of digitoxin intoxications.","Breuer, Thomas Georg Karl; Quast, Daniel Robert; Wiciok, Stephan; Labedi, Adnan; Ellrichmann, Gisa",Blood purification,126,24

At present, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is primarily used to detect SARS-CoV-2. Despite the high sensitivity, the PCR process is time-consuming and complex which limits its applicability for rapid testing of large-scale outbreaks. Here, we propose a rapid and easy-to-implement approach for SARS-CoV-2 detection based on surface enhanced infrared absorption (SEIRA) spectroscopy. The evaporated gold nano-island films are used as SEIRA substrates which are functionalized with the single-stranded DNA probes for specific binding to selected SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences. The infrared absorption spectra are analyzed using the principal component analysis method to identify the key characteristic differences between infected and control samples. The SEIRA-based biosensor demonstrates rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2, completing the detection of 1 μM viral nucleic acids within less than 5 min without any amplification. When combined with the recombinase polymerase amplification treatment, the detection capability of 2.98 copies per μL (5 aM) can be completed within 30 min. This approach provides a simple and economical alternative for COVID-19 diagnosis, which can be potentially useful in monitoring and controlling future pandemics in a timely manner.","Yao, Zhiqi; Zhang, Qiongdi; Zhu, Wenting; Galluzzi, Massimiliano; Zhou, Wenhua; Li, Jia; Zayats, Anatoly V; Yu, Xue-Feng",Nanoscale,126,13

Oxidative stress occurs when there is an imbalance between free radical activity and antioxidant activity, which can be studied in insects by transcriptome analysis. This study aimed to apply a meta-analysis approach to evaluate insect oxidative transcriptomes using publicly available data. We collected oxidative stress response-related RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data for a wide variety of insect species, mainly from public gene expression databases, by manual curation. Only RNA-seq data of Drosophila melanogaster were found and were systematically analyzed using a newly developed RNA-seq analysis workflow for species without a reference genome sequence. The results were evaluated by two metric methods to construct a reference dataset for oxidative stress response studies. Many genes were found to be downregulated under oxidative stress and related to organ system process (GO:0003008) and adherens junction organization (GO:0034332) by gene enrichment analysis. A cross-species analysis was also performed. RNA-seq data of Caenorhabditis elegans were curated, since no RNA-seq data of insect species are currently available in public databases. This method, including the workflow developed, represents a powerful tool for deciphering conserved networks in oxidative stress response.","Bono, Hidemasa",bioRxiv,126,25

We designed a content-based image retrieval system for medical imaging, which reduces the gap between access to information and the availability of useful repositories to meet these needs. The system operates on the principle of query-by-example, in which users provide medical images, and the system displays a set of related images.

The untreated, primary, secondary and tertiary treated wastewater samples were collected over a time frame ranging from under-lockdown to post-lockdown conditions. The results showed that SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in 13 out of 40 wastewater samples in Jaipur district, Rajasthan and in 5 out of 14 wastewater samples in the Haridwar District, Uttarakhand with the E gene predominantly observed as compared to the N and RdRp target genes in later time-points of sampling. The Ct values of genes present in wastewater samples were correlated with the incidence of patient and community cases of COVID-19. This study further indicates that the viral RNA could be detected after the primary treatment but was not present in secondary or tertiary treated samples. This study implies that aerobic biological wastewater treatment systems such as moving bed biofilm reactor (MBBR) technology and sequencing batch reactor (SBR) are effective in virus removal from the wastewater. This work might present a new indication that there is little to no risk in relation to SARS-CoV-2 while reusing the treated wastewater for non-potable applications. In contrast, untreated wastewater might present a potential route of viral transmission through WWTPs to sanitation workers and the public.

In light of the prevalence of the current Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), which is characterized as highly contagious and very complicated, it is urgent and necessary to find a quick way that can be practically implemented for diagnosing COVID-19. The danger of the virus lies in the fact that patients can spread the disease without showing any symptoms. Moreover, several vaccines have been produced and vaccinated in large numbers but, the outbreak does not stop. Therefore, it is urgent and necessary to find a quick way that can be prac-tically implemented for diagnosing COVID-19 cases. One of the most important ways to combat this disease is the early detection of the virus by using technology to identify and isolate patients. The combined results of recent researches showed that both CT and CXR scan correctly diagnosed COVID-19 in 87% and 80% of infected people. From these perspectives, this research paper aims to employ a deep learning model using the convolutional neural network (CNN) to detect and diagnose COVID-19 from both CT and CXR scans. The CNN is being used for features extraction and then detect COVID-19 cases in a little bit of time. Dataset collections of CT and CXR scans are being applied for examining the pro-posed CNN-based COVID-19 detection model. The results show that the pro-posed C NN-based COVID-19 detection model can achieve an accuracy of 99%, effectively speeding up the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 patients from CT and CXR scans.","Baz, M.; Zaini, H.; El-sayed, H.

The findings indicate that the pandemic forces companies to consider total costs more holistically, beyond the purchase price, and that collaboration with suppliers and developing new sources of supply is of growing importance to reduce risk in the supply chain. However, the change involved in responding to risks will take time, and for many companies, the hardest work is still ahead.

However, such models rarely explicitly appeals to theories of human behaviour to justify model assumptions. Here we propose a novel mathematical model of disease transmission via fomites (luggage trays) at airport security screening during an outbreak. Our model incorporates the self-protective behaviour of using hand sanitiser gel in line with the extended parallel processing model (EPPM) of behaviour. We find that changing model assumptions of human behaviour in line with the EPPM gives qualitatively different results on the optimal placement of hand sanitiser gels within an airport compared to the model with naive behavioural assumptions. Specifically, that it is preferable to place hand sanitiser gels after luggage screening in most scenarios, however in situations where individuals perceive high threat and low efficacy this strategy may need to be reviewed. This model demonstrates how existing behavioural theories can be incorporated into mathematical models of infectious disease.","Walters, C. E.; Bekker-Nielsen Dunbar, M.; Weston, D.; Hall, I.

Compared to the conventional process design, which is influenced by an empirical ""trial-and-error"" principle, the simulative process design offers the possibility of reducing development time and costs while at the same time improving the process understanding. A possible simulation technique to achieve these goals is the Finite Element Method (FEM). The FEM enables the calculation of the thermo-mechanical load spectrum underlying the machining process. Therefore, different input models are required. One of the most critical input models is the material model, which describes the constitutive material behavior. To determine the material model parameters, either (conventional) material tests, which require an extrapolation into the regime of metal cutting, or inverse techniques are used, where the process itself is used as a material test. Using the inverse technique, the model parameters are modified iteratively until a predefined agreement between simulations and experiments is achieved. The evaluation of the agreement bases on integral process variables, such as the cutting force, and their simulative counterparts. However, the procedure of the inverse determination requires high computational efforts and is not robust. This paper presents a novel approach to enhance the robustness of the inverse material model parameter determination from the cutting process. Orthogonal cutting tests on AISI 1045 steel have been conducted on a broaching machine tool over a range of different cutting speeds and undeformed chip thicknesses to set an experimental database. Thereby, the workpiece material was investigated in the two different heat treatments: normalized and coarse-grain annealed. The machining experiments showed differences in terms of the integral process results when comparing the two heat treatments. These results motivated for the development of a methodology capable to determine material model parameters robust and inversely from the machining process, which can be used with lower computational effort. To simulate the machining process, a Coupled-Eulerian-Lagrangian (CEL) model of the orthogonal cutting process has been set up. The material model parameters have been inversely determined using the Downhill-Simplex-Algorithm, which has been modified for this case. By using the Downhill-Simplex-Algorithm, it was possible to determine material model parameters within 17 iterations and achieving an average deviation between the experiment and the simulations below 10 %. Thereby, different process observables such as temperature, forces, and chip form have been used for the evaluation. Through this method, it is possible to determine material model parameters, which enable a good match between experiments and simulations with a low computational effort.","Bergs, Thomas; Hardt, Marvin; Schraknepper, Daniel",Procedia Manufacturing,126,33

The study objective was to examine associations between teamwork and leadership factors and clinician burnout as the care burden increased over 8 months of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Across two California hospitals, cross-sectional surveys were administered to emergency department (ED) personnel in July and December 2020 (N1 = 328 & N2 = 356). Overall burnout (“Overall, based on your definition of burnout, how would you rate your level of burnout?”) and worsening burnout during the crisis (“Compared to your level of burnout prior to COVID, to what extent is your current level of burnout worse, improved or the same?”) were measured on a 5-point Likert scale and analyzed as binary variables. Burnout was defined as having at least some burnout (ie, reporting at least “definitely” burning out). Worsening burnout was defined as either burnout that had “gotten much worse” or “gotten a little worse” since before the COVID-19 crisis. These outcomes were assessed in relation to joint problem-solving (JPS), clear process and leader inclusiveness using logistic regressions. Models controlled for age, sex, race, location, tenure and shift, as well as county COVID-19 case burden using open-access data from John Hopkins University’s Coronavirus Resource Center. Results: The sample across both waves consisted of 75 attendings (14.79%), 50 residents/fellows (9.89%), 38 advance practice providers (5.56%), 254 registered nurses (37.13%) and 90 other ED personnel (therapists, social workers, etc.) (13.16%). Burnout increased over time, where 32.22% reported burnout in wave 1 and 56.51% in wave 2. Worsening burnout also increased over time, 57.32% to 80.52% respectively. Clear process and leader inclusiveness were significantly associated with lower odds of burnout across both time points, 0.28 (p < 0.001) and 0.45 (p < 0.05) in wave 1 and 0.30 (p <0.01) and 0.35 (p < 0.01) in wave 2, respectively (Figure 1). Joint-problem solving was significantly associated with lower odds of burnout in wave 2 only, 0.60 (p-value < 0.01). All factors were significantly associated with lower odds of worsening burnout in wave 2 only, 0.45 (p < 0.01) for JPS, 0.29 (p < 0.01) for clear process and 0.37 (p < 0.05) for leader inclusiveness (Figure 1). Conclusions: During a prolonged crisis, communicating a clear process to ED personnel, and encouraging leaders to include staff in decisions may do more to reduce burnout early on. However, solving problems together and relying on staff interchangeably may continue to prevent burnout as time goes on and the burden of disease increases. When managing burnout among ED personnel, leaders should focus initially on providing structure, and then, reinforce strong teamwork to help their staff continue on.

Mixing and Displacement ventilation systems, are the common mode of air diffusion strategies adopted in the aircraft cabin. However, air movement using these strategies showcased an ease of infection-spread and uneven thermal comfort levels. Hence, the need to develop existing design of air circulation systems for optimized use in aircraft cabins. In this study, we selected two different models of mixing ventilation to study better airflow leading to thermal comfort. The focus of this study is to accurately investigate and study airflow distribution and thermal stability in a cabin space of an aircraft. A Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model is applied to simulate a cabinspace environment inside a Boeing 767–300 airplane at cruise conditions. CFD model was prepared based on an extensive literature survey. Besides, the airflow and thermal stability effect of re-circulation on airborne transmission was also discussed in this paper. A countermeasure design has been proposed, analyzed, and compared with the base model to improve air distribution and thermal stability inside the cabin. By comparing the two models in terms of the distribution of velocity and temperature, this study found that the improved design has more uniform airflow. The results show that the modified design having distributed inlets reduces the path of airflow and may reduce the risk of airborne transmissions such as SARS-CoV-1 (SARS) and the SARS-CoV-2 (Covid-19). In a future further study, we may do with the DPM method to exactly know the effect on airborne transmission.","Ahmed Mboreha, Chanfiou Tytelman Xavier Nwaokocha Collins Layeni Abayomi Okeze Ruth C.; Shaibu Amiri, Abdalah",Materials Today: Proceedings,126,9

Unfortunately, many supervised learning methods usually suffer from the problem of scarce labeled molecules in the chemical space, where such property labels are generally obtained by Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculation which is extremely computational costly. An effective solution is to incorporate the unlabeled molecules in a semi-supervised fashion. However, learning semi-supervised representation for large amounts of molecules is challenging, including the joint representation issue of both molecular essence and structure, the conflict between representation and property leaning. Here we propose a novel framework called Active Semi-supervised Graph Neural Network (ASGN) by incorporating both labeled and unlabeled molecules. Specifically, ASGN adopts a teacher-student framework. In the teacher model, we propose a novel semi-supervised learning method to learn general representation that jointly exploits information from molecular structure and molecular distribution. Then in the student model, we target at property prediction task to deal with the learning loss conflict. At last, we proposed a novel active learning strategy in terms of molecular diversities to select informative data during the whole framework learning. We conduct extensive experiments on several public datasets.

Using in vitro translation assays and enzymatic and chemical probes for RNA structure, we have defined features of the pseudoknot that promote efficient frameshifting. Heterologous RNA structures, e.g. a hairpin, a tRNA or a synthetic pseudoknot, substituted downstream of the shifty site fail to promote frameshifting, suggesting that specific features of the MMTV pseudoknot are important for function. Site-directed mutations of the MMTV pseudoknot indicate that the pseudoknot junction, including an unpaired adenine nucleotide between the two stems, provides a specific structural determinant for efficient frameshifting.

The immunological fragment of the S protein (Ala251-His641, SARS_S1b) is believed to be essential for SARS_CoV entering the host cell through S protein-ACE-2 interaction. We have quantitatively characterized the thermally induced and GuHCl-induced unfolding features of SARS_S1b using circular dichroism (CD), tryptophan fluorescence, and stopped-flow spectral techniques. For the thermally induced unfolding at pH 7.4, the apparent activation energy (E(app)) and transition midpoint temperature (Tm) were determined to be 16.3 +/- 0.2 kcal/mol and 52.5 +/- 0.4 degrees C, respectively. The CD spectra are not dependent on temperature, suggesting that the secondary structure of SARS_S1b has a relatively high thermal stability. GuHCl strongly affected SARS_S1b structure. Both the CD and fluorescent spectra resulted in consistent values of the transition middle concentration of the denaturant (Cm, ranging from 2.30 to 2.45 M) and the standard free energy change (deltaG(o), ranging from 2.1 to 2.5 kcal/mol) for the SARS_S1b unfolding reaction. Moreover, the kinetic features of the chemical unfolding and refolding of SARS_S1b were also characterized using a stopped-flow CD spectral technique. The obvious unfolding reaction rates and relaxation times were determined at various GuHCl concentrations, and the Cm value was obtained, which is very close to the data that resulted from CD and fluorescent spectral determinations. Secondary and three-dimensional structural predictions by homology modeling indicated that SARS_S1b folded as a globular-like structure by beta-sheets and loops; two of the four tryptophans are located on the protein surface, which is in agreement with the tryptophan fluorescence result. The three-dimensional model was also used to explain the recently published experimental results of S1-ACE-2 binding and immunizations.","Yu, Changying; Gui, Chunshan; Luo, Haibin; Chen, Lili; Zhang, Liang; Yu, Hao; Yang, Sheng; Jiang, Weihong; Shen, Jianhua; Shen, Xu; Jiang, Hualiang",Biochemistry,126,1

MATERIALS AND METHODS Serial thin-section CT scans in 30 patients (17 men, aged 42.5 years +/- 12.2 [SD]) with SARS were reviewed by two radiologists together for predominant patterns of lung abnormalities: ground-glass opacities, ground-glass opacities with superimposed linear opacities, consolidation, reticular pattern, and mixed pattern (consolidation, ground-glass opacities, and reticular pattern). Scans were classified according to duration in weeks after symptom onset. Longitudinal changes of specific abnormalities were documented in 17 patients with serial scans obtained during 3 weeks. Each lung was divided into three zones; each zone was evaluated for percentage of lung involvement. Summation of scores from all six lung zones provided overall CT score (maximal CT score, 24). RESULTS Median CT scores increased from 1 in the 1st week to 12.5 in the 2nd week. Ground-glass opacities with or without smooth interlobular septal thickening and consolidation were predominant patterns found during the 1st week. Ground-glass opacities with superimposed irregular reticular opacities, mixed pattern, and reticular opacities were noted from the 2nd week and peaked at or after the 4th week. After the 4th week, 12 (55%) of 22 patients had irregular linear opacities with or without associated ground-glass opacities and CT scores greater than 5; five of these patients had bronchial dilatation. When specific opacities were analyzed in 17 patients, consolidation generally resolved completely (n = 4) or to minimal residual opacities; six (55%) of 11 patients with ground-glass opacities had substantial residual disease (CT scores > 5) on final scans. CONCLUSION There is a temporal pattern of lung abnormalities at thin-section CT in SARS. Predominant findings at presentation are ground-glass opacities and consolidation. Reticulation is evident after the 2nd week and persists in half of all patients evaluated after 4 weeks. Long-term follow-up is required to determine whether the reticulation represents irreversible fibrosis.","Ooi, Gaik C; Khong, Pek L; Müller, Nestor L; Yiu, Wai C; Zhou, Lin J; Ho, James C M; Lam, Bing; Nicolaou, Savvas; Tsang, Kenneth W T",Radiology,126,1

METHODS Retrospective analysis of the epidemiological history, clinical presentation, the change of laboratory tests, chest radiography, and treatment of 15 SARS patients with cardiac arrest. RESULTS The average age of the patients was 60 years. Eight had a history of exposure to SARS patients, among them 6 were household contacts. Eight patients had no underlying diseases, and another 8 complained of extreme anxiety. Abnormalities of cardiac enzymes were present in 10 patients. Myocardial ischemia and arrhythmia were present in 5 patients. Bilateral, multifocal lung infiltrates were present in 13 of the 15 patients. Four patients died after defecation and 9 died during relatively stable periods. CONCLUSIONS It was suggested that the causes for cardiac arrest in SARS patients may include: (1) the lung injury caused by the SARS virus leads to hypoxemia and thus an unsteady state of the myocardial electricity; (2) SARS virus directly causes injury to the myocardial cells and/or the conduct system; (3) SARS infection aggravates the original myocardial pathological change, worsening the conduct block; (4) extreme anxiety leads to extra secretion of catecholamine, which causes instability of myocardial electricity; (5) defecation worsens hypoxemia, which induces arrhythmia (ventricular fibrillation) and causes cardiac arrest.","Pan, Shi-fen; Zhang, Hong-yu; Li, Chun-sheng; Wang, Chen",Zhonghua jie he he hu xi za zhi = Zhonghua jiehe he huxi zazhi = Chinese journal of tuberculosis and respiratory diseases,126,30

The objective of this study is to describe epidemiology of non-surgical febrile patients at the ED and to identify risk factors for adverse outcome. METHODS Blood, sputum, urine and faeces cultures, urine sediments and throat swaps for viral diagnostics were obtained from febrile ED patients. Outcome parameters were bacterial/viral infection, non-bacterial/non-viral infection, non-infectious febrile disease; mortality, hospital admission, admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) and length of hospital stay. RESULTS 213 Patients were included (87.8% were hospitalised, 8.5% were admitted to ICU, 4.2% died). In 75 patients (35.2%), bacterial infection was confirmed; in 78 patients (36.6%) bacterial infection was suspected. In nine patients (4.2%), viral diagnosis was confirmed; in six patients (2.8%), a viral condition was suspected. The most frequently encountered infection was bacterial pneumonia (58 patients, 27.2%). Only older age was correlated with mortality (ρ=0.176, p=0.01). CONCLUSION A majority of the febrile patients were admitted to the hospital, mostly for bacterial infection. An overall mortality rate of 4.2% was registered. Only a few risk factors for adverse outcome could be identified in this cohort. Overall, the outcome of patients presenting with fever at the ED is rather benign.","Limper, M; Eeftinck Schattenkerk, D; de Kruif, M D; van Wissen, M; Brandjes, D P M; Duits, A J; van Gorp, E C M",The Netherlands journal of medicine,126,28

Being provocative is important because the future may be very unfamiliar and demands an approach of critical thinking, which can best be activated by having to consider the prospective reality of one or more substantially different policy operational environments. The factors that are shaping our future may also be quite disruptive (for example from 1989 to 1994 when the Cold War abruptly ended, the Soviet Union dissolved and the internet was born). Consequently it is essential that any forward preparedness efforts explore a range of plausible options and not immediately discount those that may in today's terms appear unlikely. The author reviews the methods through to the point where scenario parameters are defined, and then switches to observations about how the process can influence and provoke policy formulation. The results of the foresight and scenarios employment are described by Willis in another paper in this volume.","Smith, Jack E",Veterinaria italiana,126,16

Particular attention is given to genetic characteristic of this virus ,to mechanism of its invasion into the human organism, replication and interection with ACE-2 receptors ,as well as to the basic targets for the action of existing drugs with antiviral activity against COVID-19. Currently, the following medications are used to treat COVID-19: remdesivir, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), ribavirin, lopinavir/ritonavir. According to a recent theory of coronavirus treatment, the starting point for the mechanism of action of a potential etiotropic drug is the inhibition of the coronavirus main protease (Mpro/3CLpro) and the papain-like protease (PLpro). Among the drugs listed above, lopinavir acts through this mechanism but is characterized by severe side effects.It is emphasized that remdesivir as adenosine analog provides inhibitory action on RNA dependent RNA-Polymerase,but there are controversial views about reduction in mortality during using of this drug against COVID-19. The present paper discusses the mechanism of action of a potential etiotropic drug against coronavirus, which implies the replacement of the nucleotides involved in the process of translation of the virus with their analogs with the aim to ""inhibit"" the ribosome and block the production of viral proteins.","Ratiani, L; Gegechkory, S; Machavariani, K; Shotadze, T; Sanikidze, T; Intskirveli, N",Georgian medical news,126,33

Video electroencephalography recordings and data from a near infrared spectroscopy cerebral/somatic oximeter were gathered and related to electrographic seizure onset and offset as determined by a paediatric epileptologist. All four patients showed haemodynamic changes associated with epileptiform activities. The increased blood flow clearly coincided with epileptiform activity and continued to increase as the epileptiform activity built up. Regional cerebral oxygen saturation increased in the epileptogenic focus, perhaps due to loss of cerebrovascular autoregulation. These findings reinforce that near infrared spectroscopy can potentially be used in a wide spectrum of patients with epilepsy regardless of the underlying brain pathology.","Monrad, Priya; Sannagowdara, Kumar; Bozarth, Xiuhua; Bhosrekar, Sugandha; Hecox, Kurt; Nwosu, Michelle; Schwabe, Michael; Meyer, Michael; Szabo, Aniko; Prigge, Jenna; Lemke, Russ; Horn, Briana; Whelan, Harry T",Journal of near infrared spectroscopy,126,1

In this work, the brain gene expression pattern of sea bream (Sparus aurata) in response to nodavirus infection was investigated. We used the suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) method to generate a subtracted cDNA library enriched with gene transcripts differentially expressed after 1 day post-infection. Some of the ESTs from the infected tissues fell in gene categories related to stress and immune responses. For the reverse library (ESTs expressed in controls compared with infected tissues) the most abundant transcripts were of ribosomal and mitochondrial nature. Several ESTs potentially induced by virus exposure were selected for in vivo expression studies. We observed a clear difference in expression between infected and control samples for two candidate genes, ubiquitin conjugating enzyme 7 interacting protein, which seems to play an important role in apoptosis and the interferon induced protein with helicase C domain 1 (mda-5) that contributes to apoptosis and regulates the type I IFN production, a key molecule of the antiviral innate response in most organisms.","Dios, S; Poisa-Beiro, L; Figueras, A; Novoa, B",Molecular immunology,126,19

In many RNA viruses the viral 3'UTR establishes a recognition and initiation site for viral RNA replication. Thus the transgenic transcript may contain a functional virus replication site. Experiments were designed to determine if a challenging virus would recognize this replication site on a nuclear derived transcript and synthesize the complementary RNA. These data demonstrate that upon infection by a virus that recognizes the viral replication site, a full-length complement of the transgenic transcript is produced. In these experiments the replication complex of Brome Mosaic bromovirus recognized the transgenic transcript derived from a Cowpea Chlorotic Mottle bromovirus transgene.

Law enforcement plays an important role in assessing and investigating activities involved in an event of bioterrorism or biocrime. Key to a successful biosecurity program is increased awareness and early detection of threats facilitated by an integrated network of responsibilities and capabilities from government, academic, private, and public assets.

Two different molecular biology-based assays--real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and repetitive element PCR--are described and demonstrate how molecular biology tools may be utilized to aid in the investigative process. Technologies relied on by microbial forensic scientists need to be properly validated so that the methods used are understood and so that interpretation of results is carried out within the limitations of the assays. The three types of validation are preliminary, developmental, and internal. The first is necessary for rapid response when a threat is imminent or an attack has recently occurred.

The severity of the disease is characterized, in part, by a dysregulated immune response. CD16+ monocytes are innate immune cells involved in inflammatory responses to viral infections, and tissue repair, among other functions. We characterized the transcriptional changes in CD16+ monocytes from PBMC of people with COVID-19, and from healthy individuals using publicly available single cell RNA sequencing data. CD16+ monocytes from people with COVID-19 compared to those from healthy individuals expressed transcriptional changes indicative of increased cell activation, and induction of a migratory phenotype. We also analyzed COVID-19 cases based on severity of the disease and found that mild cases were characterized by upregulation of interferon response and MHC class II related genes, whereas the severe cases had dysregulated expression of mitochondrial and antigen presentation genes, and upregulated inflammatory, cell movement, and apoptotic gene signatures. These results suggest that CD16+ monocytes in people with COVID-19 contribute to a dysregulated host response characterized by decreased antigen presentation, and an elevated inflammatory response with increased monocytic infiltration into tissues. Our results show that there are transcriptomic changes in CD16+ monocytes that may impact the functions of these cells, contributing to the pathogenesis and severity of COVID-19.","Chilunda, Vanessa; Martinez-Aguado, Pablo; Xia, Li C; Cheney, Laura; Murphy, Aniella; Veksler, Veronica; Ruiz, Vanessa; Calderon, Tina M; Berman, Joan W",Front Immunol,126,24

While expressed on the surface of human cells, such as lung, heart, kidney, neurons, and endothelial cells (EC), ACE2 is the entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2. Here, we would like to highlight that ACE2 is predominant on the EC membrane. Many of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) symptoms have been associated with the large recruitment of immune cells, directly affecting EC. Additionally, cytokines, hypoxia, and complement activation can trigger the activation of EC leading to the coagulation cascade. The EC dysfunction plus the inflammation due to SARS-CoV-2 infection may lead to abnormal coagulation, actively participating in thrombo-inflammatory processes resulting in vasculopathy and indicating poor prognosis in patients with COVID-19.

Recent studies have reported that similar to SARS-CoV, this strain expresses a spike protein (S) with a receptor binding domain (RBD) that binds to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) - an enzyme expressed mostly in the endothelium, kidneys, heart, gastrointestinal tract and lungs - to facilitate viral entry and intracellular replication. Incidentally, the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is integral to physiologic control of both ACE and ACE2 expression, and is an essential system utilized by SARS-CoV-2, albeit with varying schools of thought on how it can affect viral entry. In this paper, we will review current knowledge on the RAAS and how it can be affected by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and corticosteroid use at the organ and cellular levels. We will then discuss the relevance of these interactions on organ-specific ACE2 expression, and provide scientific insights on how this mechanism can potentially affect SARS-CoV-2 infection in the early phases of disease. From the standpoint of other known viruses, we will then aim to discuss the potential uses or restrictions of these drugs in viral infection, and provide an update on relevant studies about COVID-19.","Cabbab, Iris Louise N; Manalo, Rafael Vincent M",Virus Res,126,23

The study involved patients with COVID-19, proved by PCR test, admitted to the “Ospedali Riuniti Padova Sud” COVID-19 referral center in the Veneto region, Italy. The algorithms considered were the Recursive Partition Tree (RPART), the Support Vector Machine (SVM), the Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), and Random Forest. The resampled performances were reported for each MLT, considering the sensitivity, specificity, and the Receiving Operative Characteristic (ROC) curve measures. The study enrolled 341 patients. The median age was 74 years, and the male gender was the most prevalent. The Random Forest algorithm outperformed the other MLTs in predicting in-hospital mortality, with a ROC of 0.84 (95% C.I. 0.78–0.9). Age, together with vital signs (oxygen saturation and the quick SOFA) and lab parameters (creatinine, AST, lymphocytes, platelets, and hemoglobin), were found to be the strongest predictors of in-hospital mortality.

The virus is estimated to have infected more than 1.5 million individuals. The available reports suggest that gastrointestinal (GI) involvement in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is common and in some cases the GI symptoms may precede the respiratory symptoms. In addition to direct effects of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, the infected patients remain at risk for the complications commonly managed by gastroenterology and hepatology consultants. The most commonly reported GI manifestation of COVID-19 is diarrhea, which is reported in a third to up to more than half of the patients. Mild to moderate elevation of the liver enzymes are also common, although no case of acute liver failure has been reported so far. Many of the medications used for treatment of COVID-19 can also be associated with GI symptoms or liver injury and can be included in the differential diagnosis in these patients. Although the diagnosis of the infection is currently based on RNA analysis in respiratory samples, the available literature on fecal shedding of this virus suggests that fecal RNA testing might prove to be a useful diagnostic test. It is reasonable to delay all non-urgent endoscopic procedures during the peak of the pandemic and use additional protective equipment such as N95 respirators during endoscopy while most patients can be considered high risk for having been exposed to the virus.","Hajifathalian, Kaveh; Mahadev, Srihari; Schwartz, Robert E; Shah, Shawn; Sampath, Kartik; Schnoll-Sussman, Felice; Brown, Robert S; Carr-Locke, David; Cohen, David E; Sharaiha, Reem Z",World J Gastroenterol,126,24

MEHODS: An online survey was used to explore the views of young people with epilepsy (n = 71) and caregivers (n = 130) in June 2020. It included questions on the impact of the pandemic and associated restrictions on the child's epilepsy and on child and parental wellbeing. RESULTS: One in three young people and 29 % of caregivers reported that the young person's seizures had increased during the pandemic (only 10 % of young people and 8% of caregivers reported a decrease). Half of young people reported that they were more reluctant to go to hospital. Thirty-one percent of young people and 20 % of parents reported difficulties getting epilepsy medication whilst a significant minority of young people (18 %) and caregivers (25 %) reported that the young person had investigations/assessments cancelled by their hospital. The majority of young people reported their sleep (72 %), mood (64 %) and levels of physical activity (53 %) had deteriorated. Caregivers experienced increases in stress (55 %) and anxiety (52 %). Epilepsy nurses were seen as the most helpful support CONCLUSIONS: Results indicate that the pandemic and associated restrictions have had a negative impact on young people with epilepsy. Perceived increases in seizures, reluctance to go to hospital and cancelled investigations are likely to impact on epilepsy management. The wider psychosocial impact is also likely to be significant with increases in child and caregiver mental health problems in an already vulnerable group.","Reilly, Colin; Muggeridge, Amy; Cross, J Helen",Seizure,126,24

METHODS: COVID-19 cases and deaths from 28 February to 21 May 2020 of 37 WHO European countries were aggregated into 12 consecutive weeks. The fuzzy C-means clustering was performed to identify similar countries in COVID-19 incidence and mortality rate. Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient and log-log linear regression analyses were performed to set up relation between COVID-19 mortality rate and age. Mann-Whitney (Wilcoxon) test was used to explore differences between countries possessing higher mortality rate and age. RESULTS: Based on the highest value of the coefficient of overall separation five clusters of similar countries were identified for incidence rate, mortality rate and in total. Analysis according to weeks offered trends where progress of COVID-19 incidence and mortality rate was visible. Pearson coefficient (0.69) suggested moderately strong connection between mortality rate and age, Mann-Whitney (Wilcoxon) test proved statistically significant differences between countries experiencing higher mortality rate and age vs. countries having both indicators lower (p < 0.001). Log-log linear regression analysis defined every increase in life expectancy at birth in total by 1% meant growth in mortality rate by 22% (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Spain, Belgium and Ireland, closely followed by Sweden and Great Britain were identified as the worst countries in terms of incidence and mortality rate in the monitored period. Luxembourg, Belarus and Moldova accompanied the group of the worst countries in terms of incidence rate and Italy, France and the Netherland in terms of mortality rate. Correlation analysis and the Mann-Whitney (Wilcoxon) test proved statistically significant positive relationship between mortality rate and age. Log-log linear regression analysis proved that higher age accelerated the growth of mortality rate.","Zach, Hana; Hanová, Martina; Letkovicová, Mária",Cent Eur J Public Health,126,3

The student-led Cambridge University Wilderness Medicine Society devised a low-cost wilderness medicine teaching weekend that can be replicated at other institutions. METHODS: The weekend course consisted of small-group lessons introducing the roles of the expedition doctor and expedition leader and the assessment and management of acute conditions in remote environments. This was followed by a 3-station circuit to teach the principles of casualty triage, splinting, and construction of rope stretchers. These skills were then practiced in simulations in which participants rotated roles as care providers and patients. Participant confidence was compared before the course and immediately on course completion using the related-samples Wilcoxon signed-ranks test with significance accepted at P<0.05. Usefulness of course content and perceptions of learning were also assessed. RESULTS: Sixty-one medical students attended the wilderness teaching weekend and completed the structured feedback questionnaires. Participants rated the course highly in terms of usefulness of course content (mean±SD=18.3±1.9, range=12-20) and perceptions of learning (mean±SD=37.6±2.6, range=31-40), with 92% of participants ""strongly agreeing"" that the course was of high quality. There was an improvement in perceived confidence after course completion (P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: We have demonstrated that a teaching program consisting of structured, low-cost ""teaching weekends"" is a potential solution to the lack of centralized national wilderness medicine teaching and can be integrated, with minimal disruption, into the undergraduate curriculum.","To, Benjaman; Tailor, Bhavesh V; Beverley, Jodie; Moore, George; Peng, Yuhan",Wilderness Environ Med,126,20

211194,211194,211194,Stroke in COVID-19 patients-A case series from Italy,16.9604,8.661087,2020,"BACKGROUND: Falls amongst older people are common; however, around 40% of falls could be preventable. Medications are known to increase the risk of falls in older adults. The debate about reducing the number of prescribed medications remains controversial, and more evidence is needed to understand the relationship between polypharmacy and fall-related hospital admissions. We examined the effect of polypharmacy on hospitalization due to a fall, using a large nationally representative sample of older adults. METHODS: Data from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA) were used. We included 6220 participants aged 50+ with valid data collected between 2012 and 2018.The main outcome measure was hospital admission due to a fall. Polypharmacy -the number of long-term prescription drugs- was the main exposure coded as: no medications, 1-4 medications, 5-9 medications (polypharmacy) and 10+ medications (heightened polypharmacy). Competing-risk regression analysis was used (with death as a potential competing risk), adjusted for common confounders, including multi-morbidity and fall risk-increasing drugs. RESULTS: The prevalence of people admitted to hospital due to a fall increased according to the number of medications taken, from 1.5% of falls for people reporting no medications, to 4.7% of falls among those taking 1-4 medications, 7.9% of falls among those with polypharmacy and 14.8% among those reporting heightened polypharmacy. Fully adjusted SHRs for hospitalization due to a fall among people who reported taking 1-4 medications, polypharmacy and heightened polypharmacy were 1.79 (1.18; 2.71), 1.75 (1.04; 2.95), and 3.19 (1.61; 6.32) respectively, compared with people who were not taking medications. CONCLUSIONS: The risk of hospitalization due to a fall increased with polypharmacy. It is suggested that prescriptions in older people should be revised on a regular basis, and that the number of medications prescribed be kept to a minimum, in order to reduce the risk of fall-related hospital admissions.","Zaninotto, P; Huang, Y T; Di Gessa, G; Abell, J; Lassale, C; Steptoe, A",BMC Public Health,126,26

Early reports describe high venous thromboembolism (VTE) and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) rates, but data are limited. This multicenter, retrospective study described the rate and severity of hemostatic and thrombotic complications of 400 hospital-admitted COVID-19 patients (144 critically ill) primarily receiving standard-dose prophylactic anticoagulation. Coagulation and inflammatory parameters were compared between patients with and without coagulation-associated complications. Multivariable logistic models examined the utility of these markers in predicting coagulation-associated complications, critical illness, and death. The radiographically-confirmed VTE rate was 4.8% (95% CI, 2.9-7.3%) and the overall thrombotic complication rate was 9.5% (6.8-12.8%). The overall and major bleeding rates were 4.8% (2.9-7.3%) and 2.3% (1.0-4.2%). In the critically ill, radiographically-confirmed VTE and major bleeding rates were 7.6% (3.9-13.3%) and 5.6% (2.4-10.7%). Elevated D-dimer at initial presentation was predictive of coagulation-associated complications during hospitalization [D-dimer >2,500 ng/mL, adjusted OR for thrombosis, 6.79 (2.39-19.30), adjusted OR for bleeding, 3.56 (1.01-12.66)], critical illness, and death. Additional markers at initial presentation predictive of thrombosis during hospitalization included platelet count >450×109/L [adjusted OR, 3.56 (1.27-9.97)], C-reactive protein (CRP) >100 mg/L [adjusted OR, 2.71 (1.26-5.86)], and erythrocyte sedimentation rate >40 mm/h [adjusted OR, 2.64 (1.07-6.51)]. ESR, CRP, fibrinogen, ferritin, and procalcitonin were higher in patients with thrombotic complications than those without. DIC, clinically-relevant thrombocytopenia, and reduced fibrinogen were rare and were associated with significant bleeding manifestations. Given the observed bleeding rates, randomized trials are needed to determine any potential benefit of intensified anticoagulant prophylaxis in COVID-19 patients.","Al-Samkari, Hanny; Karp Leaf, Rebecca S; Dzik, Walter H; Carlson, Jonathan Ct; Fogerty, Annemarie E; Waheed, Anem; Goodarzi, Katayoon; Bendapudi, Pavan; Bornikova, Larissa; Gupta, Shruti; Leaf, David; Kuter, David J; Rosovsky, Rachel P",Blood,126,25

Besides endothelial cells, thrombin and platelets, also neutrophil granulocytes appear to play an important role. Neutrophils extrude extracellular nets which are histone- and protease-coated web-like DNA structures, activate coagulation and platelets, and release radicals and proteases such as elastase. The unique phylogenetically ancient and ""versatile"" inhibitor &#945;2 -M contributes particularly during childhood to the antithrombin activity of plasma, binds a broad spectrum of proteases and interacts with other mediators of inflammation such as cytokines.

Trial managers have played a key role in decision-making, undertaking risk assessments and adapting trial processes, working closely with other members of the research team. This article presents some of the ways in which trial management processes have been altered and the key role that trial managers have played. It has been born out of discussions between trial managers in the UK who are members of the UK Trial Managers' Network (UKTMN), a national network of trial management professionals managing non-commercial trials.In these unprecedented times, clinical trials have faced many uncertainties and broad-ranging challenges encompassing a range of activities including prioritising patient safety amidst the pandemic, consenting and recruiting new participants into trials, data collection and management and intervention delivery. In many cases, recruitment has been paused whilst mitigations have been put in place to continue data collection. Innovative solutions have been implemented to ensure we continue, where possible, to deliver high-quality clinical trials. Technology has provided many solutions to these challenges, and trial managers have adapted to new ways of working whilst continuing to deliver their clinical trials. Trial management groups are now faced with new uncertainties around re-starting clinical trials, and it is unclear currently how this will go, though working together with sponsors, funders and site teams is clearly a priority.Clinical trial teams have worked together to ensure their trials have adapted quickly whilst ensuring participant safety is given utmost importance. There are clear examples where the trial community have come together to share experiences and expertise, and this should continue in the future to ensure the innovative practices developed become embedded in the design and conduct of clinical trials in the future.","Mitchell, Eleanor J; Ahmed, Khaled; Breeman, Suzanne; Cotton, Seonaidh; Constable, Lynda; Ferry, Gillian; Goodman, Kirsteen; Hickey, Helen; Meakin, Garry; Mironov, Katy; Quann, Niamh; Wakefield, Natalie; McDonald, Alison",Trials,126,26

Losartan is the ARB that was chosen to be tested in this study. METHODS: Patients with COVID-19 and mild hypoxia (receipt of &#8804; 3 L/min O2 by nasal cannula) admitted to three hospitals were randomized in a 1:1 ratio within 72 h of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid testing confirmation to prospectively receive standard of care (SOC) alone or SOC plus losartan 12.5 mg orally every 12 h for 10 days or until hospital discharge, with the option to titrate upward dependent on blood pressure tolerability. Primary composite endpoint was receipt of mechanical ventilation or death before receiving ventilation. Subjects were followed until discharge to home or until an endpoint was met in the hospital. RESULTS: Sixteen subjects received an ARB plus SOC and 15 subjects received SOC alone. The median age was 53 years for both groups. Median time from hospital admission to study enrollment was 2 days (range 1-6) for the ARB group and 2 days (range 1-4) for the SOC group. Mean Charlson comorbidity index was 2 for both groups. One subject in each group achieved the composite endpoint. CONCLUSION: This small prospective randomized open-label study showed no clinically significant impacts of ARB therapy in mildly hypoxemic patients hospitalized with COVID-19 early in the pandemic. A larger prospective randomized placebo-controlled trial would be needed to confirm these findings or capture less pronounced effects and probably should focus on outpatients earlier in disease course.

Unitary regimes tended to have stronger policy measures in place early on relative to federalist states but relaxed these restrictions sooner. Countries with greater freedom (political rights and civil liberties) and those that spend less on public health also exhibited slower early policy responses, but caught up within three to four months after the pandemic reached their country. There is no evidence that women leaders, viewed as a whole, put in place more aggressive polices to combat the virus relative to their male counterparts.

As MIS-C combines clinical features of Kawasaki disease and Toxic Shock Syndrome (TSS), we aimed to compare the immunological profile of pediatric patients with these different conditions. We analyzed blood cytokine expression, and the T cell repertoire and phenotype in 36 MIS-C cases, which were compared to 16 KD, 58 TSS, and 42 COVID-19 cases. We observed an increase of serum inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-10, IL-18, TNF-&#945;, IFNÎ³, CD25s, MCP1, IL-1RA) in MIS-C, TSS and KD, contrasting with low expression of HLA-DR in monocytes. We detected a specific expansion of activated T cells expressing the Vß21.3 T cell receptor ß chain variable region in both CD4 and CD8 subsets in 75% of MIS-C patients and not in any patient with TSS, KD, or acute COVID-19; this correlated with the cytokine storm detected. The T cell repertoire returned to baseline within weeks after MIS-C resolution. Vß21.3+ T cells from MIS-C patients expressed high levels of HLA-DR, CD38 and CX3CR1 but had weak responses to SARS-CoV-2 peptides in vitro. Consistently, the T cell expansion was not associated with specific classical HLA alleles. Thus, our data suggested that MIS-C is characterized by a polyclonal Vß21.3 T cell expansion not directed against SARS-CoV-2 antigenic peptides, which is not seen in KD, TSS and acute COVID-19.","Moreews, Marion; Le Gouge, Kenz; Khaldi-Plassart, Samira; Pescarmona, Rémi; Mathieu, Anne-Laure; Malcus, Christophe; Djebali, Sophia; Bellomo, Alicia; Dauwalder, Olivier; Perret, Magali; Villard, Marine; Chopin, Emilie; Rouvet, Isabelle; Vandenesh, Francois; Dupieux, Céline; Pouyau, Robin; Teyssedre, Sonia; Guerder, Margaux; Louazon, Tiphaine; Moulin-Zinsch, Anne; Duperril, Marie; Patural, Hugues; Giovannini-Chami, Lisa; Portefaix, Aurélie; Kassai, Behrouz; Venet, Fabienne; Monneret, Guillaume; Lombard, Christine; Flodrops, Hugues; De Guillebon, Jean-Marie; Bajolle, Fanny; Launay, Valérie; Bastard, Paul; Zhang, Shen-Ying; Dubois, Valérie; Thaunat, Olivier; Richard, Jean-Christophe; Mezidi, Mehdi; Allatif, Omran; Saker, Kahina; Dreux, Marlène; Abel, Laurent; Casanova, Jean-Laurent; Marvel, Jacqueline; Trouillet-Assant, Sophie; Klatzmann, David; Walzer, Thierry; Mariotti-Ferrandiz, Encarnita; Javouhey, Etienne; Belot, Alexandre",Sci. immunol,126,16

Currently, many countries vaccinate their population in descending order of age to minimize the deaths caused by the disease; however, the effectiveness of this strategy needs to be quantitatively assessed. We employed the susceptible-infected-recovered-dead (SIRD) model to investigate various vaccination strategies. In complex network, the case fatality rate (CFR)-based method was shown to be more effective than the load-based strategy when there is a low supply of vaccine; however, when there is a sufficient quantity of vaccine, the load-based strategy is more effective than the CFR-based strategy. We also constructed a metapopulation model with empirical human contact and CFR data for SARS-CoV-2 and investigated vaccination strategies. We found that the age-based strategy, which is currently employed in many countries, is more effective when the basic reproduction number is high and vaccination supply is low, but the rate-based method outperforms the age-based strategy when there is sufficiently high supply of vaccine. Simulated annealing is performed to find the optimal vaccination strategy. We identified a first-order phase transition in the vaccination strategies which is characterized by discontinuous transition in the optimal strategy and the hysteresis. This phase transition implies that mixing the age-based and rate-based strategy is ineffective in reducing the number of deaths. These conclusions are valid even when the heterogeneous degree distribution of human contact is considered.","Jhun, Bukyoung; Choi, Hoyun",,126,16

We focus on the scaling limits with a large population, functional law of large numbers (FLLN) and functional central limit theorems (FCLT), while the large and moderate deviations for some Markovian epidemic models are also reviewed. In the FLLN, the limits are a set of Volterra integral equations, and in the FCLT, the limits are stochastic Volterra integral equations driven by Gaussian processes. We relate our deterministic limits to the results in the seminal papers by Kermack and McKendrick published in 1927, 1932 and 1933, where the varying infectivity and susceptibility/immunity were already considered.

The effect of environmental temperature on transmissibility and fatality rate of COVID-19 and protective efficacy of Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccination towards COVID-19 remains ambiguous. Therefore, we explored the global impact of environmental temperature and neonatal BCG vaccination coverage on transmissibility and fatality rate of COVID-19. The COVID-19 data for reported cases, deaths and global temperature were collected from 31st December 2020 to 3rd April 2020 for 67 countries. Temperature data were split into quartiles for all three categories (minimum temperature, maximum temperature and mean temperature). The impact of three types of temperature data and policy of BCG vaccination on COVID-19 infection was determined by applying the multivariable two-level negative binomial regression analysis keeping daily new cases and daily mortality as outcome. The highest number of cases fell in the temperature categories as following: mean temperature in the second quartile (6°C to 10.5°C), median 26, interquartile range (IQR) 237; minimum temperature in the first quartile (-26°C to 1°C), median 23, IQR 173; maximum temperature in the second quartile (10°C to 16°C), median 27.5, IQR 219. For the minimum temperature category, 28% statistically significant lower incidence was noted for new cases from the countries falling in the second quartile (2°C to 6°C) compared with countries falling in the first quartile (-26°C to 1°C) (incidence rate ratio [IRR] 0.72, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.57 to 0.93). However, no statistically significant difference in incidence rate was observed for mean temperature categories in comparison to the first quartile. Countries with BCG vaccination policy had 58% less mortality as compared with countries without BCG coverage (IRR 0.42; 95% CI 0.18 to 0.95). Our exploratory study provides evidence that high temperature might not be associated with low transmissibility and countries having neonatal BCG vaccination policy had a low fatality rate of COVID-19.","Kumar, Amit; Misra, Shubham; Verma, Vivek; Vishwakarma, Ramesh K; Kamal, Vineet Kumar; Nath, Manabesh; Prakash, Kiran; Upadhyay, Ashish Datt; Sahu, Jitendra Kumar",PLoS One,126,7

It consisted of multiple-choice and open-ended questions where students could provide examples of positive and/or negative supervision strategies. Open answered questions were coded as either examples of positive or negative support. RESULTS: PhD students were divided into two groups: those with improved or unchanged supervision during the pandemic (group 1, n = 185), versus those whose supervision worsened (group 2, n = 69). Group 1 received more help from supervisors and more frequent supervision via both online and alternative platforms (email/messages and telephone). There was no significant difference in educational-stage, gender or caretaking responsibilities between the groups. CONCLUSIONS: It is important for the scientific community to learn how to provide the best possible supervision for PhD students during the pandemic. Our data suggests that more frequent supervision, and using a diverse array of meeting platforms is helpful. In addition, it is important for the students to feel that they have their supervisor's emotional support. Several students also expressed that they would benefit from an extension of their PhD programs due to delays caused by the pandemic.","Börgeson, Emma; Sotak, Matus; Kraft, Jamie; Bagunu, Grace; Biörserud, Christina; Lange, Stephan",BMC Med Educ,126,16

The design of novel drug-drug interaction for COVID-19 patients is an open area of research. Also, the development of the COVID-19 rapid testing kits is still a challenging task. Methodology This review focuses on two prime challenges caused by urgent needs to effectively address the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic, i.e., the development of COVID-19 classification tools and drug discovery models for COVID-19 infected patients with the help of artificial intelligence (AI) based techniques such as machine learning and deep learning models. Results In this paper, various AI-based techniques are studied and evaluated by the means of applying these techniques for the prediction and diagnosis of COVID-19 disease. This study provides recommendations for future research and facilitates knowledge collection and formation on the application of the AI techniques for dealing with the COVID-19 epidemic and its consequences. Conclusions The AI techniques can be an effective tool to tackle the epidemic caused by COVID-19. These may be utilized in four main fields such as prediction, diagnosis, drug design, and analyzing social implications for COVID-19 infected patients.","Kumar, Vijay Singh Dilbag Kaur Manjit Damaševičius Robertas",PeerJ Computer Science,126,24

BACKGROUND: Nurse turnover is a current global problem in health care system, especially given the severe nurse shortages. Retention of nurses requires an understanding of the characteristics of the resigning nurses, their attitudes and their reasons for leaving. METHODS: A matching case-control study was conducted among 100 resigning nurses and 200 matched remaining nurses. Questionnaires were used to survey the professional characteristics and attitudes of the participating nurses. In addition, exit interviews were used to assess the reasons to leave of resigning nurses. RESULTS: Resigning nurses had higher education, less seniority and fewer managerial positions compared with remaining nurses. In addition, resigning nurses had lower professional autonomy and higher aspirations for professional advancement. The reasons to leave cited by the resigning nurses were distance of the workplace from home and working conditions as well as aspiring for professional advancement. CONCLUSIONS: The interface between high education and having few opportunities for advanced positions may lead to resignation. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT: We recommend organisational interventions for training new hospital nurses through professional career path development, such as mentoring programme.","Kerzman, Hana; Van Dijk, Dina; Siman-Tov, Maya; Friedman, Shoshy; Goldberg, Shoshy",J. nurs. manag,126,16

Despite the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on racial/ethnic minorities, the extent and reliability of race reporting in COVID research is unclear. METHODS: COVID-19 research published in three top medical journals during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic was reviewed and assessed for race reporting and proportional representation. RESULTS: Of the 95 manuscripts that were identified, 56 reporting on 252,262 patients met eligibility. Thirty-five (62.5%) did not report race distribution and 15 (26.7%) did not report ethnicity. There was no difference based on journal (P = 0.87), study sponsor (P = 0.41), whether the study was retrospective or prospective (P = 0.33), or observational vs interventional (P = 0.11). Studies with &#8805;250 patients were more likely to report on race (OR 4.01, 95% CI: 1.12-14.37, P = 0.027), and North American (USA and Canada) studies were more likely than European studies (OR 7.88, 95% CI: 1.73-37.68, P = 0.006) to report on race. COVID-19 research mirrored USA COVID-19 racial incidence; however, both showed higher distribution of COVID-19 infection among Blacks and a smaller proportion of Whites compared to the USA population. This suggests that research is broadly representing infection rates and that social determinants of health are impacting racial distribution of infection. CONCLUSIONS: Despite increasing awareness of racial disparities and inequity, COVID-19 research during the first wave of the pandemic lacked appropriate racial/ethnicity reporting. However, research mirrored COVID-19 incidence in the USA, with an increased burden of infection among Black individuals.","Raghav, Kanwal; Anand, Seerat; Gothwal, Anirudh; Singh, Pooja; Dasari, Arvind; Overman, Michael J; Loree, Jonathan M",Int J Infect Dis,126,26

In this group of society, life satisfaction is particularly associated with the emotional area. The notion of life satisfaction is related to many factors, such as personality traits, moods and various life events, and poses challenges in various aspects of everyday life. Given that mental health is one of the determinants of the quality of life of older adults, it is reasonable to conduct research among this growing group of the population. The aim of this study was to assess life satisfaction and depressive symptoms in mentally active older adults in Poland. METHODS: The study covered 125 attendees at the University of Healthy Senior (UHS) and 125 auditing students at the University of Psychogeriatric Prophylaxis (UPP), organised by the Faculty of Health Sciences at the Medical University of Bialystok, of whom 78.3% were female and 21.7% male. The study was conducted using four standardised scales: the Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS), Beck Depression Inventory, Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). RESULTS: Seniors who participated in the study were satisfied with their lives; the average SWLS score was 23 points. Men rated their level of satisfaction higher than women: the median score on the SWLS was 26 points for men and 23 points for women. Life satisfaction and mental disorders did not differ on the basis of sex, age, or education (the type of place of education attended). As the level of depression increased, life satisfaction decreased. Statistically significant correlations of average strength were found between the point values of the four measures of depression under consideration and were evenly distributed from 0.57 to 0.69. CONCLUSIONS: The high level of life satisfaction and a low level of mental disorders should be maintained in this population, and additional educational activities should be organised among seniors on a large scale. There were no differences in the distribution of psychometric measure scores among the three compared age groups of respondents in this study. Each of the questionnaires used measured of different aspects of depressive conditions, and it is worth using them in parallel rather than interchangeably.","Van Damme-Ostapowicz, Katarzyna; Cybulski, Mateusz; Galczyk, Monika; Krajewska-Kulak, Elzbieta; Sobolewski, Marek; Zalewska, Anna",BMC Geriatr,126,24

SARS-CoV-2-Nluc can be used to measure neutralizing antibody activity in patient sera within 5 hours, and it produces results in concordance with a plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT). Additionally, using SARS-CoV-2-Nluc infection of A549 cells expressing human ACE2 receptor (A549-hACE2), we show that the assay can be used for antiviral screening. Using the optimized SARS-CoV-2-Nluc assay, we evaluate a panel of antivirals and other anti-infective drugs, and we identify nelfinavir, rupintrivir, and cobicistat as the most selective inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2-Nluc (EC50 0.77 to 2.74 µM). In contrast, most of the clinically approved antivirals, including tenofovir alafenamide, emtricitabine, sofosbuvir, ledipasvir, and velpatasvir were inactive at concentrations up to 10 µM. Collectively, this high-throughput platform represents a reliable tool for rapid neutralization testing and antiviral screening for SARS-CoV-2.","Xie, Xuping; Muruato, Antonio E; Zhang, Xianwen; Lokugamage, Kumari G; Fontes-Garfias, Camila R; Zou, Jing; Liu, Jianying; Ren, Ping; Balakrishnan, Mini; Cihlar, Tomas; Tseng, Chien-Te K; Makino, Shinji; Menachery, Vineet D; Bilello, John P; Shi, Pei-Yong",Nat Commun,126,26

When an operation continues for an extended duration, regression of spinal anesthesia often leads to general anesthesia. Here we present a case of extended spinal anesthesia assisted by monitored anesthesia care. Case presentation: A 32-year-old male who suffered from persistent pain of the right knee was diagnosed with rupture of the right anterior cruciate ligament. Arthroscopic surgery of the right knee was conducted with spinal anesthesia. A local anesthetic mixture of 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine 12 mg with 50 μg of epinephrine was used. The surgery took longer than expected with a total anesthesia time of 402 minutes. In the final 30 minutes of surgery, spinal anesthesia regressed and the procedure was completed under monitored anesthesia care (MAC). Clinical discussion: When spinal anesthesia is on regression during the final stage of surgery, the application of MAC safely secures additional operation time. By adopting MAC, the patient avoided general anesthesia and had minimal physiological distress and a rapid recovery. Another benefit of MAC is the reduced consumption of resources. Further, by avoiding endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation, the risk of transmission of infectious agents is minimized. Conclusion: In situations where spinal anesthesia is regressing close to the end of a surgical procedure, the application of MAC has potential benefits over general anesthesia. These benefits are particularly relevant during the current COVID-19 pandemic. © 2021 The Authors","Park, J.; Song, S. W.; Kim, D. W.; Lee, K. H.",Annals of Medicine and Surgery,126,11

Occasionally, it may arise from benign causes, such as endoscopic intervention, trauma, and prolonged intubation. Case Presentation. A 24-year old previously healthy pregnant female was diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia and was intubated. Due to non-reassuring fetal status, an emergency cesarean section was performed at the 36th week of gestation;the baby tested negative for COVID-19 and was separated. Throughout her illness, the patient was treated for recurrent bouts of pneumonia, coupled with findings of pneumothorax and pneumomediastinum- all of which were attributed to pulmonary fibrosis from Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). A chest and neck CT scan (figure 1), however, confirmed the presence of a tracheoesophageal fistula (TEF), along with a hyperinflated endotracheal (ET) cuff. A temporizing procedure, involving tracheostomy with an extended length tracheal tube, was performed. The long-term plan was to surgically correct the TEF after nutritional upbuilding and liberation from the ventilator, however the patient succumbed to her infections. Discussion.The findings of a communication between the trachea and the esophagus tie all of these events together: the pneumothorax and pneumomediastinum, as well as the recurrent bouts of pneumonia from recurrent aspiration through the fistula. Despite its rarity (0.3-3%), tracheoesophageal fistulas are a very real possibility in patients who require prolonged invasive ventilation. A retrospective study by Fiacchino et al. noted a significant increase in full thickness tracheal lesions in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, which may be caused by several factors: the presence of an overinflated endotracheal (ET) cuff, prolonged steroid use, hypoxic injury, as well as possible direct injury of the tracheal mucosa from the Coronavirus itself [1]. This case highlights the importance of keeping a high index of suspicion for tracheal injury in patients who experience prolonged periods of intubation. It also underlies the high morbidity and mortality rate associated with TEF, albeit being a rare disease. Lastly, it highlights yet another possible long-term complication of COVID-19.

Therefore, we aimed to describe the distribution of these risk factors across Europe. Subject and methods: Prevalence of risk factors for severe COVID-19 was identified based on interviews from 73,274 Europeans aged 50+ participating in the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) in 2017. Burden of disease was estimated using population data from Eurostat. Results: A total of 75.3% of the study population (corresponding to approx. 60 million European men and 71 million women) had at least one risk factor for severe COVID-19, 45.9% (approx. 36 million men and 43 million women) had at least two factors, and 21.2% (approx. 17 million men and 20 million women) had at least three risk factors. The prevalence of underlying medical conditions ranged from 4.5% for cancer to 41.4% for hypertension, and the region-specific prevalence of having at least three risk factors ranged from 18.9% in Northern Europe to 24.6% in Eastern Europe. Conclusions: Information about the prevalence of risk factors might help authorities to identify the most vulnerable subpopulations with multiple risk factors of severe COVID-19 and thus to decide appropriate strategies to mitigate the pandemic.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Data were obtained from the China Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS). Type 2 diabetes was reported by participants themselves in each survey wave. The duration of follow-up was defined as the period from the first visit to the first time self-reported type 2 diabetes, death, or other loss to follow-up from CHNS. The patterns of change trajectories in BMI were derived by latent class trajectory analysis method. The Fine and Gray regression model was used to estimate HRs with corresponding 95% CIs for type 2 diabetes. RESULTS: Four patterns of the trajectories of change in BMI were identified among Chinese adults, 42.7% of participants had stable BMI change, 40.8% for moderate BMI gain, 8.9% for substantial BMI gain and 7.7% for weight loss. During the follow-up with mean 11.2 years (158 637 person-years contributed by 14 185 participants), 498 people with type 2 diabetes (3.7%) occurred. Risk of type 2 diabetes was increased by 47% among people who gained BMI more substantially and rapidly (HR: 1.47, 95% CI 1.08 to 2.02, p=0.016) and increased by 20% among those in people with the moderate BMI gain (HR: 1.20, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.48, p=0.078), compared with those with stable BMI change. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term substantial gain of BMI was significantly associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes in the Chinese adults.","Mi, Baibing; Wu, Chenlu; Gao, Xiangyu; Wu, Wentao; Du, Jiaoyang; Zhao, Yaling; Wang, Duolao; Dang, Shaonong; Yan, Hong",,126,26

Sarcopenic obesity is a relatively new term. It is a clinical condition that primarily affects older adults. There are several endocrine-hormonal, metabolic and lifestyle aspects involved in the occurrence of sarcopenic obesity that affect pathophysiological aspects that, in turn, contribute to CVD and neoplasms. However, there is no available evidence on the role of sarcopenic obesity in the occurrence of CVD and cancer and its pathophysiological interplay. Therefore, this review aims to describe the pathophysiological aspects and the clinical and epidemiological evidence on the role of sarcopenic obesity related to the occurrence and mortality risk of various types of cancer and cardiovascular disease.

At high latitudes, the average daily intensity of red and blue parts of the spectrum is not very high; for many crops cultivated under greenhouse conditions, it reaches the sufficient level only on clear summer days. The problem of insufficient illumination in greenhouses is usually solved with artificial light sources. This article describes a technology for the manufacture of photoconversion fluoropolymer films for greenhouses. The fluoropolymer films described in the paper make use of original gold nanoparticles and nanoparticles with fluorescence in the blue or red region of the spectrum. In the polymer film, nanoparticles aggregate in the form of ""beads"", which enhances the field of the optical wave. The film photoconverts UV and violet light into blue and red light. Gold nanoparticles also partially convert energy in the green region of the spectrum (not used by plants) into heat, which is also important for agriculture at high latitudes. In addition, impregnation of gold nanoparticles into fluoropolymer significantly increases the lifetime of the film. The films described in the paper can significantly increase the productivity of greenhouses located at high latitudes. Plants cultivated under the films have more chlorophyll and a higher intensity of photosynthesis - although their system of distance stress signals is, to a certain degree, suppressed.","Gudkov, Sergey V; Simakin, Alexander V; Bunkin, Nikolay F; Shafeev, Georgy A; Astashev, Maxim E; Glinushkin, Alexey P; Grinberg, Marina A; Vodeneev, Vladimir A",J Photochem Photobiol B,126,16

We investigated whether the expression levels of intestinal MAdCAM-1, PECAM-1 (CD31) and CAV-1 are affected by endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress following brief treatment with tunicamycin (TN). We administered a single dose of TN intraperitoneally. Twenty-four hours later, MAdCAM-1, PECAM-1 and CAV-1 expression levels in Peyer's patches and villi were examined using immunohistochemistry (IHC), immunofluorescence (IF) and western blotting. Immunostaining of MAdCAM-1 and CAV-1 in control and TN treated Peyer's patches and villi exhibited similar staining patterns. The immunoreactivity of PECAM-1 was similar for the control and TN treated Payer's patches, whereas staining was decreased significantly in TN treated villi. Our findings suggest that short term TN treatment did not affect leukocyte movement to lymphoid compartments of the small intestine, but it altered villus architecture due to decreased PECAM-1 expression.","Öztel, Zübeyde; Gazan, Sibel; Balcan, Erdal",Biotech Histochem,126,24

This study aimed to assess the perceived impacts of the pandemic on practice changes, financial implications, and mental health of the physician members of the American Medical Society for Sports Medicine (AMSSM). METHODS: Online surveys were sent to physician members of the AMSSM, with questions asking about demographic information and personal associations to COVID-19. The main outcome measures included self-reported clinical practice volumes, visit types (telemedicine, face-to-face), Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-4) scores, personal finances, clarity of practice guidelines, and personal protective equipment (PPE) availability. RESULTS: A total of 825 respondents completed the initial survey, with a subset completing follow-ups. In-person clinical and procedural volumes were reported to be reduced to just 17.9% and 13.7% of the pre-pandemic baseline volumes at the first survey (March 2020), but increased to 81.1% and 77.3% (August 2020), respectively. PHQ-4 anxiety subscores significantly decreased over time (p < 0.001); younger physicians and female physicians were more likely to have higher scores (p < 0.05). Reported physician income significantly increased over time (p < 0.05), and financial concerns steadily decreased (p < 0.001). The perception of having an adequate PPE significantly increased over the study (p < 0.001) but not for having clear practice guidelines (p > 0.05). Physicians have become increasingly aware of others testing positive for the virus, but not themselves or someone they live with. CONCLUSIONS: Sports medicine physicians have been heavily impacted by the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, with some recovery since it started. Sports medicine physicians should be aware of pandemic-related practice changes and resulting mental health and financial implications.","Cushman, Daniel M; York, Elizabeth; Asay, Alexandra; Ross, Brendon; Teramoto, Masaru; McCormick, Zachary L",Phys Sportsmed,126,16

Objective: To evaluate the immunogenicity of the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine (Janssen/Johnson & Johnson) in humans, including the kinetics, magnitude, and phenotype of SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific humoral and cellular immune responses. Design, Setting, and Participants: Twenty-five participants were enrolled from July 29, 2020, to August 7, 2020, and the follow-up for this day 71 interim analysis was completed on October 3, 2020; follow-up to assess durability will continue for 2 years. This study was conducted at a single clinical site in Boston, Massachusetts, as part of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 1 clinical trial of Ad26.COV2.S. Interventions: Participants were randomized to receive 1 or 2 intramuscular injections with 5 × 1010 viral particles or 1 × 1011 viral particles of Ad26.COV2.S vaccine or placebo administered on day 1 and day 57 (5 participants in each group). Main Outcomes and Measures: Humoral immune responses included binding and neutralizing antibody responses at multiple time points following immunization. Cellular immune responses included immunospot-based and intracellular cytokine staining assays to measure T-cell responses. Results: Twenty-five participants were randomized (median age, 42; age range, 22-52; 52% women, 44% male, 4% undifferentiated), and all completed the trial through the day 71 interim end point. Binding and neutralizing antibodies emerged rapidly by day 8 after initial immunization in 90% and 25% of vaccine recipients, respectively. By day 57, binding and neutralizing antibodies were detected in 100% of vaccine recipients after a single immunization. On day 71, the geometric mean titers of spike-specific binding antibodies were 2432 to 5729 and the geometric mean titers of neutralizing antibodies were 242 to 449 in the vaccinated groups. A variety of antibody subclasses, Fc receptor binding properties, and antiviral functions were induced. CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses were induced. Conclusion and Relevance: In this phase 1 study, a single immunization with Ad26.COV2.S induced rapid binding and neutralization antibody responses as well as cellular immune responses. Two phase 3 clinical trials are currently underway to determine the efficacy of the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine.

The method of data analysis was based on a two-stage Heckman model. Based on empirical data, the majority (93%) of the households are willing to pay for the indigenous plants. Furthermore, factors such as the age of the household’s head, marital status, size of households, financial returns and economic benefit of indigenous plants significantly influenced income and willingness to pay for indigenous plants by the households. Thus, indigenous plants have the potential to penetrate local and international markets and can be used to improve the economies, livelihood, and food security status of rural households in South Africa. Indigenous plant cultivation can increase agro-food system species diversity while conserving plant species indigenous to this area of South Africa. Encouraging both consumption and production of indigenous plants can also help diversify local economies and communities.","Abiodun Olusola, Omotayo Ndhlovu Peter Tshepiso Seleke Christopher Tshwene Olagunju Kehinde Oluseyi Adeyemi Oladapo Aremu",Sustainability,126,4

We used a novel application of Optimal Transport for computing the distance between the normalized patterns induced by bivariate time series for each pair of cities.

METHODS: We prospectively enrolled 77 patients with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 infection admitted to our intermediate care unit in Pisa between March 5 and March 30, 2020, with follow up until hospital discharge or death. Logistic regression was used identify variables potentially associated with adverse outcomes and those P <0.10 were entered into a multivariate logistic regression model. Cumulative probability for lack of adverse outcomes in patients with or without low baseline diaphragm muscle mass was calculated with the Kaplan-Meier product-limit estimator. RESULTS: The main findings of this study are that 1) patients who developed adverse outcomes had thinner diaphragm than those who did not (2.0 vs. 2.2 mm, P=0.001), 2) DT and lymphocyte count were independent significant predictors of adverse outcomes, with end-expiratory DT being the strongest (ß=-708; OR=0.492; P=0.018). CONCLUSIONS: Diaphragmatic ultrasound may be a valid tool to evaluate the risk of respiratory failure. Evaluating the need of mechanical ventilation treatment should be based not only on PaO2/FiO2, but on a more comprehensive assessment including DT because if the lungs become less compliant a thinner diaphragm, albeit free of intrinsic abnormality, may become exhausted, thus contributing to severe respiratory failure.","Corradi, Francesco; Isirdi, Alessandro; Malacarne, Paolo; Santori, Gregorio; Barbieri, Greta; Romei, Chiara; Bove, Tiziana; Vetrugno, Luigi; Falcone, Marco; Bertini, Pietro; Guarracino, Fabio; Landoni, Giovanni; Forfori, Francesco",Minerva anestesiol,126,16

Despite efforts to clarify the virus transmission, especially in indoor scenarios, several aspects of SARS-CoV-2 spread are still rudimentary. This study evaluated the contamination of the air and surfaces by SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the COVID-19 isolation ward of a hospital in Milan, Italy. A total of 42 air and surface samples were collected inside five different zones of the ward including contaminated (COVID-19 patients' area), semi-contaminated (undressing room), and clean areas. SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection was performed using real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Overall, 24.3% of swab samples were positive, but none of these were collected in the clean area. Thus, the positivity rate was higher in contaminated (35.0%) and semi-contaminated (50.0%) areas than in clean areas (0.0%; P<0.05).

All the air samples collected from the contaminated area, namely the intensive care unit and corridor, were positive while viral RNA was not detected in either semi-contaminated or clean areas. These results showed that environmental contamination did not involve clean areas, but the results also support the need for strict disinfection, hand hygiene and protective measures for healthcare workers as well as the need for airborne isolation precautions.","Razzini, Katia; Castrica, Marta; Menchetti, Laura; Maggi, Lorenzo; Negroni, Lucia; Orfeo, Nicola V; Pizzoccheri, Alice; Stocco, Matteo; Muttini, Stefano; Balzaretti, Claudia M",Sci Total Environ,126,10

In Tama City in Tokyo, 12-lead ECG and serum creatinine concentration have been included as essential examinations in specific health checkups to diagnose AF and CKD. In the present study, we investigated the impact of CKD classification on new-onset AF in the general population.MethodsâandâResults:Among 13,478 subjects aged 40-74 years at entry (age, 65.6±7.8 years; men, 42.0%), renal impairment with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <60 mL/min/1.73 m2and proteinuria were found in 15.5% and 4.6%, respectively. CKD severity in individual subjects was classified according to a heatmap of the Japanese Society of Nephrology as 81.3% in the green, 15.1% in the yellow, 2.5% in the orange, and 0.9% in the red. Of those without AF in 2012, it had developed in 115 up to 2017; thus, the new-onset AF incidence rate was 2.6/1,000 person-years.

SARS-CoV-2 nsp12, its RNA polymerase, shares homology in the nucleotide uptake channel with the HCV orthologue enzyme NS5B. Besides, HCV enzyme NS5A has pleiotropic activities, such as RNA binding, that are shared with various SARS-CoV-2 proteins. Thus, anti-HCV NS5B and NS5A inhibitors, like sofosbuvir and daclatasvir, respectively, could be endowed with anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity. METHODS: SARS-CoV-2-infected Vero cells, HuH-7 cells, Calu-3 cells, neural stem cells and monocytes were used to investigate the effects of daclatasvir and sofosbuvir. In silico and cell-free based assays were performed with SARS-CoV-2 RNA and nsp12 to better comprehend the mechanism of inhibition of the investigated compounds. A physiologically based pharmacokinetic model was generated to estimate daclatasvir's dose and schedule to maximize the probability of success for COVID-19. RESULTS: Daclatasvir inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication in Vero, HuH-7 and Calu-3 cells, with potencies of 0.8, 0.6 and 1.1 µM, respectively. Although less potent than daclatasvir, sofosbuvir alone and combined with daclatasvir inhibited replication in Calu-3 cells. Sofosbuvir and daclatasvir prevented virus-induced neuronal apoptosis and release of cytokine storm-related inflammatory mediators, respectively. Sofosbuvir inhibited RNA synthesis by chain termination and daclatasvir targeted the folding of secondary RNA structures in the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Concentrations required for partial daclatasvir in vitro activity are achieved in plasma at Cmax after administration of the approved dose to humans. CONCLUSIONS: Daclatasvir, alone or in combination with sofosbuvir, at higher doses than used against HCV, may be further fostered as an anti-COVID-19 therapy.","Sacramento, Carolina Q; Fintelman-Rodrigues, Natalia; Temerozo, Jairo R; Da Silva, Aline de Paula Dias; Dias, Suelen da Silva Gomes; da Silva, Carine Dos Santos; Ferreira, André C; Mattos, Mayara; Pão, Camila R R; de Freitas, Caroline S; Soares, Vinicius Cardoso; Hoelz, Lucas Villas Bôas; Fernandes, Tácio Vinício Amorim; Branco, Frederico Silva Castelo; Bastos, Mônica Macedo; Boechat, Núbia; Saraiva, Felipe B; Ferreira, Marcelo Alves; Jockusch, Steffen; Wang, Xuanting; Tao, Chuanjuan; Chien, Minchen; Xie, Wei; Patel, Dinshaw; Garzia, Aitor; Tuschl, Thomas; Russo, James J; Rajoli, Rajith K R; Pedrosa, Carolina S G; Vitória, Gabriela; Souza, Letícia R Q; Goto-Silva, Livia; Guimarães, Marilia Zaluar; Rehen, Stevens K; Owen, Andrew; Bozza, Fernando A; Bou-Habib, Dumith Chequer; Ju, Jingyue; Bozza, Patrícia T; Souza, Thiago Moreno L",J Antimicrob Chemother,126,1

In recent years, researchers have proposed many excellent crowd counting methods, but these methods still have some problems such as insufficient information obtained in the output density map. Based on it, this paper proposed a crowd counting method based on Spatial Joint Upsampling(SJU). The method uses VGG-16 as the backbone of front-end. Meanwhile the back-end network extracts rich pixel details and spatial context information by adding cascaded joint upsampling model to combine multi-layer high-resolution feature maps, which ultimately have reached the effect of reducing the computational complexity and lifting the accuracy. Experimental results show that SJU has better performance than most crowd counting methods. This method has achieved MAE/MSE of 62.1/99.8 and 7.6/11.5 on the two parts of the public dataset ShanghaiTech A and B, respectively. The MAE/MSE after conducting curriculum learning on this dataset is 61.3/99.2. In addition, this method has also achieved excellent results on the large-scale complex crowd dataset NWPU-Crowd, with a MAE/MSE of 105.1/419.3, indicating that the Spatial Joint Upsampling(SJU) network has outstanding performance in the task of crowd counting in complex scenes. © 2020 IEEE.","Ding, X.; Lan, S.","2020 International Conference on Intelligent Computing and Human-Computer Interaction, ICHCI 2020",126,16

Here we report the results of a survey of approximately 4,500 Principal Investigators (PIs) at U.S.- and Europe-based research institutions. Distributed in mid-April 2020, the survey solicited information about how scientists' work changed from the onset of the pandemic, how their research output might be affected in the near future, and a wide range of individuals' characteristics. Scientists report a sharp decline in time spent on research on average, but there is substantial heterogeneity with a significant share reporting no change or even increases. Some of this heterogeneity is due to field-specific differences, with laboratory-based fields being the most negatively affected, and some is due to gender, with female scientists reporting larger declines. However, among the individuals' characteristics examined, the largest disruptions are connected to a usually unobserved dimension: childcare. Reporting a young dependent is associated with declines similar in magnitude to those reported by the laboratory-based fields and can account for a significant fraction of gender differences. Amidst scarce evidence about the role of parenting in scientists' work, these results highlight the fundamental and heterogeneous ways this pandemic is affecting the scientific workforce, and may have broad relevance for shaping responses to the pandemic's effect on science and beyond.","Myers, Kyle R.; Tham, Wei Yang; Yin, Yian; Cohodes, Nina; Thursby, Jerry G.; Thursby, Marie C.; Schiffer, Peter E.; Walsh, Joseph T.; Lakhani, Karim R.; Wang, Dashun",,126,16

Since the main route of infection with SARS-CoV-2 is probably via contact with virus-containing droplets of the exhaled air, any method of securing the airway is of extremely high risk for the health care professionals involved. We evaluated the aerosol exposure to the interventional team during a tracheotomy in a semi-quantitative fashion. In addition, we present novel protective measures. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To visualize the air movements occurring during a tracheotomy, we used a breathing simulator filled with artificial fog. Normal breathing and coughing were simulated under surgery. The speed of aerosol propagation and particle density in the direct visual field of the surgeon were evaluated. RESULTS: Laminar air flow (LAF) in the OR reduced significantly the aerosol exposure during tracheostomy. Only 4.8â±â3.4% of the aerosol was in contact with the surgeon. Without LAF, however, the aerosol density in the inspiratory area of the surgeon is ten times higher (47.9â±â10.8%, pâ<â0.01). Coughing through the opened trachea exposed the surgeon within 400ms with 76.0â±â8.0% of the aerosol - independent of the function of the LAF. Only when a blocked tube was inserted into the airway, no aerosol leakage could be detected. DISCUSSION: Coughing and expiration during a surgical tracheotomy expose the surgical team considerably to airway aerosols. This is potentially associated with an increased risk for employees being infected by airborne transmitted pathogens. Laminar airflow in an operating room leads to a significant reduction in the aerosol exposure of the surgeon and is therefore preferable to a bedside tracheotomy in terms of infection prevention. Ideal protection of medical staff is achieved when the procedure is performed under endotracheal intubation and muscle relaxation.","Loth, Andreas German; Guderian, Daniela Brigitta; Haake, Birgit; Zacharowski, Kai; Stöver, Timo; Leinung, Martin",Shock (Augusta Ga.),126,1

Public opinion was focused on this information as well, to understand how quickly the epidemic was spreading. When an increase/decrease was communicated, especially a large one, it was not easy to understand if it was due to a change in the epidemic evolution or if it was a fluctuation due to other reasons, such as an increase in the number of swabs or a delay in the swab processing. In this work, we propose a nonlinear asymmetric diffusion model, which includes information on the daily number of swabs, to describe daily fluctuations in the number of confirmed cases in addition to the main trend of the outbreak evolution. The class of diffusion models has been selected to develop our proposal, as it also allows estimation of the total number of confirmed cases at the end of the outbreak.

The objective of this review was to summarize current evidence regarding the use of cloth masks to prevent respiratory viral infections, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), among health care clinicians. METHODS: We searched 5 databases, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website, and the reference lists of identified articles on April 3, 2020. All identified publications were independently screened by 2 reviewers. Two authors independently extracted data and graded the studies. Randomized control trials (RCTs) were graded using the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) checklist, and observational and nonhuman subject studies were graded using 11 domains common across frequently used critical appraisal tools. All discrepancies were resolved by consensus. RESULTS: Our search identified 136 original publications. Nine studies met inclusion criteria. We performed a qualitative synthesis of the data from these studies. Four nonrandomized trials, 3 laboratory studies, 1 single-case experiment, and 1 RCT were identified. The laboratory studies found that cloth materials provided measurable levels of particle filtration but were less efficacious at blocking biologic material than medical masks. The RCT found that cloth masks were associated with significantly more viral infections than medical masks. CONCLUSIONS: The current literature suggests that cloth materials are somewhat efficacious in filtering particulate matter and aerosols but provide a worse fit and inferior protection compared to medical masks in clinical environments. The quality and quantity of literature addressing this question are lacking. Cloth masks lack evidence for adequate protection of health care clinicians against respiratory viral infections.","Daoud, Ariel Kiyomi; Hall, Jessica Kole; Petrick, Haylie; Strong, Anne; Piggott, Cleveland",Ann Fam Med,126,24

METHODS: Novel series of 8-(proline/pyrazole)-substituted xanthine analogs has been synthesized. The affinity and selectivity of compounds to adenosine receptors have been assessed by radioligand binding studies. The synthesized compounds also showed good bronchospasmolytic properties (increased onset of bronchospasm; decreased duration of jerks) with 100% survival of animals in comparison to the standard drug. Besides, compound 8f & 9f showed good binding affinity in comparison to other synthesized compounds in the micromolar range. RESULTS: The maximum binding affinity of these compounds was observed for A2B receptors, which is ~ 7 or 10 times higher as compared to A1, A2A and A3 receptors. The newly synthesized derivatives 8f, 9a-f, 17g-m, and 18g-m displayed significant protection against histamine aerosol induced bronchospasm in guinea pigs. CONCLUSION: Newly synthesized proline/pyrazole based xanthines compounds showed a satisfactory binding affinity for adenosine receptor subtypes.

Human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) causes the common cold.

In this study, we report docking simulation with two Mpro enzymes and five flavonols and three dihydroflavonols, in vitro inhibition of the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, and in vitro inhibition of the HCoV 229E replication. The docking simulation results predicted that (+)-dihydrokaempferol, (+)-dihydroquercetin, (+)-dihydromyricetin, kaempferol, quercetin, myricentin, isoquercetin, and rutin could bind to at least two subsites (S1, S1, S2, and S4) in the binding pocket and inhibit the activity of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro.

The proportion of persons with myopia who wore eyeglasses in Hubei province was based on data from a previous study. Exposures: Daily wearing of eyeglasses for more than 8 hours. Main Outcomes and Measures: The main outcomes were the proportions of daily wearers of eyeglasses among patients admitted to the hospital with COVID-19 and among the local population. Data on exposure history, clinical symptoms, underlying diseases, duration of wearing glasses, and myopia status and the proportion of people with myopia who wore eyeglasses in Hubei province were collected. People who wore glasses for more than 8 hours a day were defined as long-term wearers. Results: A total of 276 patients with COVID-19 were enrolled. Of these, 155 (56.2%) were male, and the median age was 51 (interquartile range, 41-58) years. All those who wore glasses for more than 8 hours a day had myopia and included 16 of 276 patients (5.8%; 95% CI, 3.04%-8.55%). The proportion of people with myopia in Hubei province, based on a previous study, was 31.5%, which was much higher than the proportion of patients with COVID-19 who had myopia in this sample. Conclusions and Relevance: In this cohort study of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in Suizhou, China, the proportion of inpatients with COVID-19 who wore glasses for extended daily periods (>8 h/d) was smaller than that in the general population, suggesting that daily wearers of eyeglasses may be less susceptible to COVID-19.","Zeng, Weibiao; Wang, Xiaolin; Li, Junyu; Yang, Yong; Qiu, Xingting; Song, Pinhong; Xu, Jianjun; Wei, Yiping",JAMA ophthalmol.

At present, there is no specific antiviral treatment recommended for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Liu Shen capsule (LS), a traditional Chinese medicine, has been proven to have a wide spectrum of pharmacological properties, such as anti-inflammatory, antiviral and immunomodulatory activities. However, little is known about the antiviral effect of LS against SARS-CoV-2. Herein, the study was designed to investigate the antiviral activity of SARS-CoV-2 and its potential effect in regulating the host's immune response. The inhibitory effect of LS against SARS-CoV-2 replication in Vero E6 cells was evaluated by using the cytopathic effect (CPE) and plaque reduction assay. The number of virions of SARS-CoV-2 was observed under transmission electron microscope after treatment with LS. Proinflammatory cytokine expression levels upon SARS-CoV-2 infection in Huh-7 cells were measured by real-time quantitative PCR assays. The results showed that LS could significantly inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication in Vero E6 cells, and reduce the number of virus particles and it could markedly reduce pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-&#945;, IL-6, IL-1ß, IL-8, CCL-2/MCP-1 and CXCL-10/IP-10) production at the mRNA levels. Moreover, the expression of the key proteins in the NF-&#954;B/MAPK signaling pathway was detected by western blot and it was found that LS could inhibit the expression of p-NF-&#954;B p65, p-I&#954;B&#945; and p-p38 MAPK, while increasing the expression of I&#954;B&#945;. These findings indicate that LS could inhibit SARS-CoV-2 virus infection via downregulating the expression of inflammatory cytokines induced virus and regulating the activity of NF-&#954;B/MAPK signaling pathway in vitro, making its promising candidate treatment for controlling COVID-19 disease.","Ma, Qinhai; Pan, Weiqi; Li, Runfeng; Liu, Bin; Li, Chufang; Xie, Yuqi; Wang, Zhoulang; Zhao, Jin; Jiang, Haiming; Huang, Jicheng; Shi, Yongxia; Dai, Jun; Zheng, Kui; Li, Xiaobo; Yang, Zifeng",Pharmacol Res,126,16

An early-stage detection of COVID-19 is crucial for the containment of the pandemic it has caused. In this study, a transfer learning-based COVID-19 screening technique is proposed. The motivation of this study is to design an automated system that can assist medical staff especially in areas where trained staff are outnumbered. The study investigates the potential of transfer learning-based models for automatically diagnosing diseases like COVID-19 to assist the medical force, especially in times of an outbreak. In the proposed work, a deep learning model, i.e., truncated VGG16 (Visual Geometry Group from Oxford) is implemented to screen COVID-19 CT scans. The VGG16 architecture is fine-tuned and used to extract features from CT scan images. Further principal component analysis (PCA) is used for feature selection. For the final classification, four different classifiers, namely deep convolutional neural network (DCNN), extreme learning machine (ELM), online sequential ELM, and bagging ensemble with support vector machine (SVM) are compared. The best performing classifier bagging ensemble with SVM within 385 ms achieved an accuracy of 95.7%, the precision of 95.8%, area under curve (AUC) of 0.958, and an F1 score of 95.3% on 208 test images. The results obtained on diverse datasets prove the superiority and robustness of the proposed work. A pre-processing technique has also been proposed for radiological data. The study further compares pre-trained CNN architectures and classification models against the proposed technique.","Singh, Mukul; Bansal, Shrey; Ahuja, Sakshi; Dubey, Rahul Kumar; Panigrahi, Bijaya Ketan; Dey, Nilanjan",Med Biol Eng Comput,126,6

Approximately 80% of the infected patients are largely asymptomatic or have mild symptoms such as fever or cough, while rest of the patients display varying degrees of severity of symptoms, with an average mortality rate of 3-4%. Severe symptoms such as pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome may be caused by tissue damage, which is mostly due to aggravated and unresolved innate and adaptive immune response, often resulting from a cytokine storm. Here, we discuss how an intricate interplay among infected cells and cells of innate and adaptive immune system can lead to such diverse clinicopathological outcomes. Particularly, we discuss how the emergent nonlinear dynamics of interaction among the components of adaptive and immune system components and virally infected cells can drive different disease severity. Such minimalistic yet rigorous mathematical modeling approaches are helpful in explaining how various co-morbidity risk factors, such as age and obesity, can aggravate the severity of CoVID-19 in patients. Furthermore, such approaches can elucidate how a fine-tuned balance of infected cell killing and resolution of inflammation can lead to infection clearance, while disruptions can drive different severe phenotypes. These results can help further in a rational selection of drug combinations that can effectively balance viral clearance and minimize tissue damage.","Sahoo, Sarthak; Jhunjhunwala, Siddharth; Jolly, Mohit Kumar",J Indian Inst Sci,126,24

As female patients usually experience longer delays before diagnosis and treatment, we assessed whether women were more affected by the dramatic drop in hospital admissions for ACS during the Covid-19 pandemic. METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of clinical and angiographic characteristics of consecutive patients who were admitted for ACS at 15 hospitals in Northern Italy comparing men and women data. The study period was defined as the time between the first confirmed case of Covid-19 in Italy (February 20, 2020) and March 31, 2020. We compared hospitalization rates between the study period and two control periods: the corresponding period during the previous year (February 20 to March 31, 2019) and the earlier period during the same year (January 1 to February 19, 2020). Incidence rate ratios comparing the study period with each of the control periods were calculated with the use of Poisson regression. RESULTS: Of the 547 patients who were hospitalized for ACS during the study period, only 127 (23%) were females, accounting for a mean of 3.1 admissions per day, while ACS hospitalized males were 420, with a mean of 10.2 admissions per day. There was a significant decrease driven by a similar reduction in ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) diagnosis in both sexes compared to the control periods. A trend toward a greater reduction in admitted females was shown in the intra-year control period (46% admission reduction in females vs 37% in males, with females accounting for 26% of ACS, P=0.10) and a significant reduction when compared to the previous year control period (40% admission reduction in females vs 23% in males, with females accounting for 28% of ACS, P=0.03), mainly related to Unstable Angina diagnosis. CONCLUSION: The Covid-19 pandemic period closed the gap between men and women in ACS, with similar rates of reduction of hospitalized STEMI and NSTEMI and a trend toward greater reduction in UA admission among women. Furthermore, many typical differences between males and females regarding ischemic heart disease presentations and vessel distribution were leveled.","Barbero, Umberto; Moncalvo, Cinzia; Trabattoni, Daniela; Pavani, Marco; Amoroso, Gisella Rita; Bocchino, Pier Paolo; Truffa Giachet, Alessandra; Saglietto, Andrea; Monticone, Silvia; Secco, Gioel Gabrio; Campo, Gianluca; Verardi, Roberto; Iannaccone, Mario; Galvani, Marcello; Ugo, Fabrizio; Infantino, Vincenzo; Olivotti, Luca; Mennuni, Marco; Vercellino, Matteo; Gili, Sebastiano; Zucchetti, Ottavio; Casella, Gianni; Giammaria, Massimo; De Benedictis, Michele; Tolomeo, Paolo; Doronzo, Baldassarre; Grosso Marra, Walter; Rognoni, Andrea; Montefusco, Antonio; Patti, Giuseppe; Mancone, Massimo; De Ferrari, Gaetano Maria; D039,; Ascenzo, Fabrizio",Am J Cardiovasc Dis,126,20

Methods: Number, characteristics and delay to presentation of ACAs to our institution during the study period (28 February-30 April 2020) were compared with the corresponding 2019 period. Non-parametric correlation analyses between daily SARS-CoV-2 cases in Malta, Italy and the UK and daily ACAs were performed. Differences in cardiac death distribution (community vs. in-hospital) during the two periods were analysed. Results: There was a significant decline in daily ACAs in 2020 (median 3 [IQR 3]) vs. 2019 (median 5 [IQR 4]), p < 0.001. Patient characteristics were comparable. Delay to presentation for 2020 ACAs was significantly higher across all categories (ST-elevation myocardial infarction [STEMI] median: 2019 [1 h, IQR 1] vs. 2020 [4 h, IQR 43.8], p = 0.009; non-ST-elevation-acute coronary syndrome [NSTE-ACS] median: 2019 [4 h, IQR 71] vs. 2020 [48 h, IQR 199], p = 0.001; non-ACS median: 2019 [24 h, IQR 95] vs. 2020 [84 h, IQR 499.8], p < 0.001). There was a significant negative correlation between ACAs and daily Malta SARS-CoV-2 infection cases (r s = -0.298, p = 0.018) but not with cases in Italy and the UK when controlling for Malta cases. Significantly more cardiac deaths occurred in the community in 2020 (107, 61.8%) compared to 2019 (87, 46.8%) (p = 0.004).

Methods: A 30-year-old female visited emergency ophthalmology care at the Siena Crosslinking Centre, Italy, for a bilateral eye redness lasting two weeks, associated with unilateral photophobia and blurred vision in her right eye. She visited on the 23rd of March 2020 in the full pandemic period and presented chills and fever with a temperature of 39.0°C, associated with complete loss of taste. Since eye examination findings, systemic symptoms and epidemiological criteria correlated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, she was referred to Siena University Hospital, Italy, for the SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal buffer and haematological examinations for uveitis. Results: Eye examination revealed bilateral conjunctival hyperaemia with acute follicular conjunctivitis associated with right eye acute anterior uveitis characterized by diffuse pigmentary and whitish immune precipitates over the anterior capsule of the crystalline lens and initial anterior lens opacity explaining the blurred vision. Adjunctive prophylactic eye topical treatment, included in the acronym SHYPIO (0.02% sodium hypochlorite solution, 0.6% povidone iodine eye-drops and 10.50% ozonized oil eye-drops), was associated with conventional uveitis therapy to prevent the virus spread through the ocular surface route. Conclusion: Our report demonstrates that complicated acute anterior uveitis (iridocyclitis) with blurred vision could be associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, being potentially sight-threatening for early complicated lens opacity.

There is a need to compile and summarize QI availability, feasibility, and global compliance in real-world registries. METHODS AND RESULTS: A systematic review of PubMed and Web of Science was conducted including all original articles reporting the use of the ESC QIs in AMI patients. Methods and reporting follow the guidelines of the PRISMA Statement and the protocol was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42020190541). Among the 220 screened citations, 9 studies met the inclusion criteria after full-text review. Among these 9 studies, there were 11 different cohorts. Patients were recruited from three different continents (31 countries). The number of QIs assessed ranged from 6 to 20, with 5 studies (56%) reporting data for at least 75% of the 20 QIs. There were room for improvement in terms of data availability (i.e. domain 6 measuring patient's satisfaction), feasibility (i.e. difficulties to find all data for composite QIs in domain 7), and attainment (i.e. high levels of compliance with the percentage of reperfused ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction patients, but low levels for a timely reperfusion). CONCLUSIONS: Our systematic review has shown that it is possible to measure most QIs in existing registries, and that there is room for improvement in terms of data availability, feasibility, and levels of attainment to QIs. Our findings may influence the design of future registries to capture this information and help in QIs definition updates.","Rossello, Xavier; Massó-van Roessel, Albert; Perelló-Bordoy, Antoni; Mas-Lladó, Caterina; Ramis-Barceló, Maria F; Vives-Borrás, Miquel; Pons, Jaume; Peral, Vicente",European heart journal.

There is increasing interest in developing complement regulatory and inhibitory agents to treat complement dysfunction. In this study, we describe the nanobody hC3Nb3, which is specific for the C-terminal C345c domain of human and mouse complement component C3/C3b/C3c and potently inhibits C3 cleavage by the alternative pathway. A high-resolution structure of the hC3Nb3-C345c complex explains how the nanobody blocks proconvertase assembly. Surprisingly, although the nanobody does not affect classical pathway-mediated C3 cleavage, hC3Nb3 inhibits classical pathway-driven hemolysis, suggesting that the C-terminal domain of C3b has an important function in classical pathway C5 convertase activity. The hC3Nb3 nanobody binds C3 with low nanomolar affinity in an SDS-resistant complex, and the nanobody is demonstrated to be a powerful reagent for C3 detection in immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry.

To address this issue, it is essential to determine levels of anxiety, depression, and traumatic stress, and sources of stress, and to identify subgroups of HCWs at a higher risk of adverse mental health outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study of symptoms of mental illness in HCWs in the area surrounding Detroit, Michigan. The online survey included questions about demographics, health and clinical factors, and sources of stress. Several tools were used to assess psychiatric symptoms among HCWs, including the Perceived Stress Scale, the Patient Health Questionnaire depression scale, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item assessment, and the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist for DSM-5. The adequacy of personal protective equipment, patient resources, and training for highly contagious diseases were rated. RESULTS: The sample (N = 129) was predominantly female (51.2%) and White (65.9%), with 30.2% screening positive for clinical follow-up to assess anxiety, 20.9% for moderate to severe depression, and 16.3% for elevated traumatic stress. Differences were found by self-reported psychiatric diagnosis and chronic conditions, and role on treatment teams. CONCLUSIONS: Frontline HCWs demonstrate high levels of stress and trauma symptoms. Timely screening and accommodations may be needed during health care crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic.","Daviskiba, Sydney E; MacKenzie, Megan A; Dow, Miriam; Johnston, Peyton; Balon, Richard; Javanbakht, Arash; Arfken, Cynthia L",Ann Clin Psychiatry,126,1

The optimal treatment of patients is not yet standardized. We use a serology-based therapeutic strategy based on the presence of antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus, in which patients with positive serology receive aggressive anti-inflammatory treatment with high-dose dexamethasone and/or tocilizumab and patients with negative serology receive early convalescent plasma therapy. We also analyze the immunological impact of this therapy in the recovery of T cells, B cells and NK cells during hospitalization in a COVID-19 infectious ward. Our results suggest that aggressive therapy with early administration of convalescent plasma and high-dose dexamethasone may be of benefit in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection and might avoid progression of lung damage or need of admission in intensive care. This strategy did not impair immune responses against SARS-CoV-2, as 93% of the patients generated antibodies against the virus. Independently of previous immunological status of the patients, serology-guided therapy might benefit even patients with a high CIRS-G score, immunosuppressed or medically debilitated individuals and elderly patients. T cell disturbances were most frequent in patients who required high-dose dexamethasone, and B cell depletion was most frequent in patients who received tocilizumab.

These agents aggregate and expand exponentially at the tumor site, resulting in potent immune activation and tumor clearance. Moreover, the ability to elaborate these cells with therapeutic agents, such as antibodies, enzymes, and immunostimulatory molecules, presents an unprecedented opportunity to specifically modulate the tumor microenvironment through cell-mediated drug delivery. This unique pharmacology, combined with significant advances in synthetic biology and cell engineering, has established a new paradigm for cells as vectors for drug delivery. Targeted cellular micropharmacies (TCMs) are a revolutionary new class of living drugs, which we envision will play an important role in cancer medicine and beyond.

A secondary aim was to investigate differences between those who frequently included their children in cooking activities during the COVID-19 pandemic and those that included their children less, on a number of factors such as working from home, parents' diet quality and cooking skills confidence. DESIGN: Cross-continental survey with Wilcoxon signed ranks, Independent t-tests, Mann Whitney-U, Chi2, and a binomial logistic regression used for assessment. SETTING: Online. PARTICIPANTS: A convenience sample of parents over 18 years from the island of Ireland (N=180), Great Britain (N=312), United States of America (N=120), New Zealand (N=166). RESULTS: In three regions, parents' time spent cooking and inclusion of children in everyday cooking activities increased (p<0.001). Country (OR=3.6, 95% CI=1.7-7.6), education (OR=1.6, 95% CI =1.1-2.4), cooking skills confidence (OR=1.02, 95% CI=1.009-1.032) and a parental higher intake of vegetables (OR=1.3, 95% CI=1.1-1.5) were significant predictors of a more frequent inclusion of children in cooking activities. CONCLUSIONS: While there a number of key benefits to including children in cooking for the children such as providing life skills and increases in diet quality, this study highlighted a higher intake of vegetables by parents who included children more frequently in cooking activities. With continued lockdowns due to COVID-19 and perhaps more flexibility in working from home in the future, including children in cooking activities should be a key public health message for both children and parents.","Benson, Tony; Murphy, Blain; McCloat, Amanda; Mooney, Elaine; Dean, Moira; Lavelle, Fiona",Public Health Nutr,126,29

The complexes were studied in solution as paramagnetic CEST (paraCEST) agents and after loading into Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast cells as cell-based CEST (cellCEST) agents. The fluorophores attached to the complexes through an amide linkage imparted an unusual pH dependence to the paraCEST properties of all four complexes through of ionization of a group that was attributed to the amide NH linker. The furthest shifted CEST peak for the hydroxypropyl-based complexes changed by â¼90 ppm upon increasing the pH from 5 to 7.5. At acidic pH, the Co(II) complexes exhibited three to four CEST peaks with the most highly shifted CEST peak at 200 ppm. The complexes demonstrated substantial paramagnetic water proton shifts which is a requirement for the development of cellCEST agents. The large shift in the proton resonance was attributed to an inner-sphere water at neutral pH, as shown by variable temperature 17O NMR spectroscopy studies. Labeling of yeast with one of these paraCEST agents was optimized with fluorescence microscopy and validated by using ICP mass spectrometry quantitation of cobalt. A weak asymmetry in the Z-spectra was observed in the yeast labeled with a Co(II) complex, toward a cellCEST effect, although the Co(II) complexes were toxic to the cells at the concentrations necessary for observation of cellCEST.","Patel, Akanksha; Abozeid, Samira M; Cullen, Paul J; Morrow, Janet R",Inorg Chem,126,24

First, even before COVID-19, health and health care have been in a time of fundamental transformation. Second, given the role Board Certification plays in supporting improvement of healthcare, Board Certification itself must respond to these changes. Third, to move forward, ABFM and the wider Board community must address a series of wicked problems - i.e., problems which are both complex-with many root causes-and complicated- in which interventions create new problems.

A group of educators deployed a virtual curriculum utilizing telemedicine and electronic health record (EHR) technologies. METHODS: Nine students participated in a formal curriculum of high-value critical care medicine topics designed to meet the learning objectives of the in-person experience. Students obtained patient histories and directed physical examinations virtually via telemedicine. They followed assigned patients, submitted clinical documentation, and practiced electronic order entry using a non-production EHR copy. At conclusion these students completed the same evaluation used for ""in-person"" CCM rotations earlier in the year. RESULTS: Students rated the virtual rotation comparably to the traditional rotation in most evaluated criteria. Lower rated areas included ""perform minor procedures"", ""patient counseling"", and ""interprofessional experiences"". Students' narrative responses specifically noted strengths of the ""student focus"" and the ability to practice in an EHR copy. DISCUSSION: Students and preceptors generally found that the virtual curriculum provided adequate educational opportunities. Certain areas were clearly lacking, as expected. Students felt the dedication of the faculty to the students' educational needs was the most important factor contributing to the success of the program. The results suggest several ways telemedicine and EHR technologies might enhance clinical medical education in the future. CONCLUSION: This methodology was successful in providing elements of a CCM rotation experience. This technology could prove efficacious for primary care rotations where in-person training is not feasible due to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.","Shoemaker, Margrit M; Lippold, Cassiopia; Schreiber, Richard; Levy, Bruce",Int J Med Inform,126,16

This article applied NLP to explore the concept of equity in community psychology. The COVID-19 crisis has made pre-existing health equity gaps even more salient. Community psychology has a specific interest in working with organizations, systems, and communities to address social determinants that perpetuate inequities by refocusing interventions around achieving health and wellness for all. This article examines how community psychology has discussed equity thus far to identify strengths and gaps for future research and practice. The results showed the prominence of community-based participatory research and the diversity of settings researchers work in. However, the total number of abstracts with equity concepts was lower than expected, which suggests there is a need for a continued focus on equity.","Scaccia, Jonathan P",,126,20

We aimed to describe the electrophysiological characteristics of AMC-AP and the related anatomy. METHODS AND RESULTS: This study involved eight (male/female = 3/5, mean age 42.6 ± 10.5 years) patients with left-sided AP successfully ablated in the AMC region. The retrograde atrial activation sequence was analysed and compared via recordings at the His-bundle (HB), coronary sinus (CS), and roving catheter during tachycardia, and the peak of QRS from the same cardiac circle used as time reference. Of the eight patients, two received prior ablations. During tachycardia, the activation time at the proximal CS (CSp), lateral CS (CSl), and HB region averaged 120 ± 26 ms, 124 ± 29 ms, and 117 ± 21 ms following the reference, respectively (P = 0.86). The latest atrial activation was recorded in the posterior CS which averaged 135 ± 25 ms following the reference. Placing the ablation catheter to AMC via retrograde approach was attempted in all cases but stable positioning achieved in none. Via transseptal approach, the ablation catheter could be easily placed at the AMC and recorded the earliest retrograde atrial activations with 60 ± 27 ms earlier than the relatively 'earliest' CS/HB recordings, and ablation at this site successfully eliminated AP conduction. No patients had recovered AP conduction after at least 12-month follow-up. CONCLUSION: AMC-AP is featured by recording comparable retrograde atrial activation times at CSp, CSl, and HB with the latest recordings at the posterior CS. Stable placement and successful ablation in the AMC via retrograde aortic approach was difficult but can be achieved via transseptal approach.","Li, Meng-Meng; Long, De-Yong; Sang, Cai-Hua; Jiang, Chen-Xi; Guo, Xue-Yuan; Zhao, Xin; Li, Song-Nan; Wang, Wei; Tang, Ri-Bo; Li, Jing-Ye; Dai, Wen-Li; Kong, Xiang-Yi; Zuo, Song; Ning, Man; Li, Xu; Wu, Jia-Hui; Dong, Jian-Zeng; Du, Xin; Ma, Chang-Sheng",Europace,126,32

METHODS: In this retrospective study, 30 patients with Coronavirus Disease-19 admitted to our hospital from January 18 to February 5, 2020, were selected as the research subjects. All cases were examined by lung ultrasound and CT. Lung lesions were reviewed by blinded observers, with imaging scores being used to analyze the ultrasound findings of lung lesions in patients with Coronavirus Disease-19 and with chest CT being used as the reference standard. The clinical value of ultrasound in the noninvasive assessment of lung lesions was evaluated. RESULTS: Lung ultrasound signs in patients with Coronavirus Disease-19 were mainly manifested as interstitial pulmonary edema (90.0â%, 27/30) and pulmonary consolidations (20.0â%, 6/30). The lung lesions were mainly distributed in the subpleural and peripheral pulmonary zones. The lower lobe and the dorsal region had a greater tendency to be involved. There was moderate agreement (Kappaâ=â0.529) between the noninvasive assessment of bedside ultrasound for lung lesions in patients with Coronavirus Disease-19 and CT. The ultrasound scores to evaluate mild, moderate and severe lung lesions exhibited sensitivity of 68.8â% (11/16), 77.8â% (7/9), 100.0â% (2/2), specificity of 85.7â% (12/14), 76.2â% (16/21), 92.9â% (26/28), and diagnostic accuracy of 76.7â% (23/30), 76.7â% (23/30), 93.3â% (28/30), respectively. The follow-up dynamic ultrasound examination showed that the condition of all patients worsened gradually, with the ultrasound scores of lung lesions increasing to varying degrees. CONCLUSION: Though the diagnostic efficacy of bedside ultrasound is relatively low for mild to moderate patients, it is high for severe patients. Bedside ultrasound has important clinical significance for noninvasive assessment and dynamic observation of lung lesions in patients with Coronavirus Disease-19, which is worth further consideration.","Lu, Wuzhu; Zhang, Shushan; Chen, Binghui; Chen, Jiaxin; Xian, Jianzhong; Lin, Yuhong; Shan, Hong; Su, Zhong Zhen",Ultraschall Med,126,16

We use a 5 year dataset from China's air quality monitoring network to assess the impact of control measures on air pollution. Pollutant concentration time series are decomposed to account for the inter-annual trend, seasonal cycles and the effect of Lunar New Year, which coincided with the COVID-19 outbreak. Over 2015-2019, there were significant negative trends in particulate matter (PM2.5, -6% yr-1) and sulphur dioxide (SO2, -12% yr-1) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2, -2.2% yr-1) whereas there were positive trends in ozone (O3, + 2.8% yr-1). We quantify the change in air quality during the LNY holiday week, during which pollutant concentrations increase on LNY's day, followed by reduced concentrations in the rest of the week. After accounting for interannual trends and LNY we find NO2 and PM concentrations were significantly lower during the lockdown period than would be expected, but there were no significant impacts on O3. Largest reductions occurred in NO2, with concentrations 27.0% lower on average across China, during the lockdown. Average concentrations of PM2.5 and PM10 across China were respectively 10.5% and 21.4% lower during the lockdown period. The largest reductions were in Hubei province, where NO2 concentrations were 50.5% lower than expected during the lockdown. Concentrations of affected pollutants returned to expected levels during April, after control measures were relaxed.","Silver, Ben; He, Xinyue; Arnold, Steve R.; Spracklen, Dominick V.",Environ.Res.Lett.,126,16

To ensure adequate testing, one must test trading strategies in a variety of market scenarios -- which includes both scenarios that represent ordinary market days as well as stressed markets (most recently observed due to the beginning of COVID pandemic).

OF leverages online finder devices to detect the presence of missing offline devices using Bluetooth and report an approximate location back to the owner via the Internet. While OF is not the first system of its kind, it is the first to commit to strong privacy goals. In particular, OF aims to ensure finder anonymity, untrackability of owner devices, and confidentiality of location reports. This paper presents the first comprehensive security and privacy analysis of OF. To this end, we recover the specifications of the closed-source OF protocols by means of reverse engineering. We experimentally show that unauthorized access to the location reports allows for accurate device tracking and retrieving a user's top locations with an error in the order of 10 meters in urban areas. While we find that OF's design achieves its privacy goals, we discover two distinct design and implementation flaws that can lead to a location correlation attack and unauthorized access to the location history of the past seven days, which could deanonymize users.

This frail patient group requires specialist care, and disruption to services is likely to result in increases in morbidity, mortality and long-term healthcare costs. AIMS: To assess disruption to hip fracture services during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A questionnaire was designed for completion by a senior clinician or service manager in each participating unit between April-September 2020. The survey was incorporated into existing national-level audits in Germany (n = 71), Scotland (n = 16), and Ireland (n = 16). Responses from a further 82 units in 11 nations were obtained via an online survey. RESULTS: There were 185 units from 14 countries that returned the survey. 102/160 (63.7%) units reported a worsening of overall service quality, which was attributed predominantly to staff redistribution, reallocation of inpatient areas, and reduced access to surgical facilities. There was a high rate of redeployment of staff to other services: two thirds lost specialist orthopaedic nurses, a third lost orthogeriatrics services, and a quarter lost physiotherapists. Reallocation of inpatient areas resulted in patients being managed by non-specialised teams in generic wards, which increased transit of patients and staff between clinical areas. There was reduced operating department access, with 74/160 (46.2%) centres reporting a >50% reduction. Reduced theatre efficiency was reported by 135/160 (84.4%) and was attributed to staff and resource redistribution, longer anaesthetic and transfer times, and delays for preoperative COVID-19 testing and using personal protective equipment (PPE). CONCLUSION: Hip fracture services were disrupted during the COVID-19 pandemic and this may have a sustained impact on health and social care. Protection of hip fracture services is essential to ensure satisfactory outcomes for this vulnerable patient group.","Hall, Andrew J; Clement, Nicholas D; MacLullich, Alasdair M J; Ojeda-Thies, Cristina; Hoefer, Christine; Brent, Louise; White, Timothy O; Duckworth, Andrew D",Surg.

DESIGN: Descriptive study. SETTING: Seven PICUs in England. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: (1) Modelling using historical Paediatric Intensive Care Audit Network data; (2) space, staff, equipment, clinical care, communication and governance considerations during repurposing of PICUs; (3) characteristics, interventions and outcomes of adults cared for in repurposed PICUs. RESULTS: Seven English PICUs, accounting for 137 beds, repurposed their space, staff and equipment to admit critically ill adults. Neighbouring PICUs increased their bed capacity to maintain overall bed numbers for children, which was informed by historical data modelling (median 280-307 PICU beds were required in England from March to June). A total of 145 adult patients (median age 50-62 years) were cared for in repurposed PICUs (1553 bed-days). The vast majority of patients had COVID-19 (109/145, 75%); the majority required invasive ventilation (91/109, 85%). Nearly, a third of patients (42/145, 29%) underwent a tracheostomy. Renal replacement therapy was provided in 20/145 (14%) patients. Twenty adults died in PICU (14%). CONCLUSION: In a rapid and unprecedented effort during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, seven PICUs in England were repurposed to care for adult patients. The success of this effort was underpinned by extensive local preparation, close collaboration with adult intensivists and careful national planning to safeguard paediatric critical care capacity.","Sinha, Ruchi; Aramburo, Angela; Deep, Akash; Bould, Emma-Jane; Buckley, Hannah L; Draper, Elizabeth S; Feltbower, Richard; Mitting, Rebecca; Mahoney, Sarah; Alexander, John; Playfor, Stephen; Chan-Dominy, Amy; Nadel, Simon; Suntharalingam, Ganesh; Fraser, James; Ramnarayan, Padmanabhan",Arch. dis. child,126,17

Technological solutions are a complement that can help citizens to be informed about the risk in their environment. Although measures such as contact traceability have been successful in some countries, their use raises society's resistance. This paper proposes a variation of the consensus processes in directed networks to create a risk map of a determined area. The process shares information with trusted contacts: people we would notify in the case of being infected. When the process converges, each participant would have obtained the risk map for the selected zone. The results are compared with the pilot project's impact testing of the Spanish contact tracing app (RadarCOVID). The paper also depicts the results combining both strategies: contact tracing to detect potential infections and risk maps to avoid movements into conflictive areas. Although some works affirm that contact tracing apps need 60% of users to control the propagation, our results indicate that a 40% could be enough. On the other hand, the elaboration of risk maps could work with only 20% of active installations, but the effect is to delay the propagation instead of reducing the contagion. With both active strategies, this methodology is able to significantly reduce infected people with fewer participants.

They have also produced unprecedented exploitation of Earth's life support systems, moving the planet into a new geological epoch, the Anthropocene-one defined by human influence on natural systems. The health sector has been complicit in this influence. Bioethics, too, must acknowledge its role-the environmental threats that will shape human health in this century represent a 'perfect moral storm' challenging the ethical theories of the last. The US conservationist Aldo Leopold saw this gathering storm more clearly than many, and in his Land Ethic describes the beginnings of a route to safe passage. Its starting point is a reinterpretation of the ethical relationship between humanity and the 'land community', the ecosystems we live within and depend upon; moving us from 'conqueror' to 'plain member and citizen' of that community. The justice of the Land Ethic questions many presuppositions implicit to discussions of the topic in biomedical ethics. By valuing the community in itself-in a way irreducible to the welfare of its members-it steps away from the individualism axiomatic in contemporary bioethics. Viewing ourselves as citizens of the land community also extends the moral horizons of healthcare from a solely human focus. Taking into account the 'stability' of the community requires intergenerational justice.

We identify and discuss three potential use cases of HCTs in the current pandemic: evaluating efficacy, converging on correlates of protection, and improving understanding of pathogenesis and the human immune response. We outline the limitations of HCTs and find that HCTs are likely to be most useful for vaccine candidates currently in preclinical stages of development. We conclude that, while currently limited in their application, there are scenarios in which HCTs would be extremely beneficial. Therefore, the option of conducting HCTs to accelerate SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development should be preserved. As HCTs require many months of preparation, we recommend an immediate effort to (1) establish guidelines for HCTs for COVID-19; (2) take the first steps toward HCTs, including preparing challenge virus and making preliminary logistical arrangements; and (3) commit to periodically re-evaluating the utility of HCTs.","Nguyen, Linh Chi; Bakerlee, Christopher W; McKelvey, T Greg; Rose, Sophie M; Norman, Alexander J; Joseph, Nicholas; Manheim, David; McLaren, Michael R; Jiang, Steven; Barnes, Conor F; Kinniment, Megan; Foster, Derek; Darton, Thomas C; Morrison, Josh",Clin. infect. dis,126,17

These require determination of the measurement accuracy (error) and its traceability (measurement uncertainty). Within error estimation, the size-of-source effect (SSE) is an important error source. The SSE is the relation between the physical size of a target and the instrument's nominal target size. This study presents a direct evaluation of the error due to the SSE. A stable and uniform temperature, generated by blackbodies, was measured by a high-quality thermal imager. To limit the generated radiation, custom-made blocking tiles with different apertures were used. Effects of aperture shapes and positions, camera-target distances and temperature levels on the error were investigated. The study findings suggest that due to the SSE the measured temperatures are too low, especially at longer camera-target distances. The SSE error depends on the number of pixels available and included into the region of interest, for which the accurate measurement is about to be performed. For an accurate temperature measurement, an array of at least 10 × 10 pixels should be exposed to the observed target radiation, while 3 × 3 central pixel area should be included in the temperature calculation.","Pusnik, Igor; Gersak, Gregor",Sensors (Basel),126,16

Some infected individuals present mild or no symptoms, while others present severe illness with some fatal outcomes. Multiple lines of management have been suggested for critically ill patients, such as intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and steroids. IVIG is the main treatment for patients with X-linked agammaglobulinemia. Multiple studies have reported that these patients have excellent outcomes when they contract COVID-19. This report describes the clinical course of COVID-19 pneumonia due to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in a 19-year-old man on IVIG replacement therapy for X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA). CASE REPORT A patient with XLA receiving a monthly dose of IVIG and having bronchiectasis managed by prophylactic azithromycin presented with fever, shortness of breath, productive cough, and diarrhea. He was admitted to our hospital with SARS-CoV-2 infection. His treatment course for COVID-19 was uncomplicated and had excellent results. He completed a 10-day course of piperacillin/tazobactam and his symptoms resolved 3 days after admission, without complications, oxygen supplementation, or intensive care unit admission. CONCLUSIONS Patients with XLA have weakened immunity and therefore may present with an infection as a first symptom. This report describes the mild course of COVID-19 pneumonia in an immunologically vulnerable patient with XLA who presented with SARS-CoV-2 infection while undergoing IVIG replacement therapy. Currently, IVIG is one of many supportive immune therapies undergoing clinical evaluation in patients with severe COVID-19.","Almontasheri, Ali; Al-Husayni, Faisal; Alsuraihi, Anas K; Binyahib, Hanan; Albanna, Amr S",Am J Case Rep,126,21

However, use of these therapies, if ineffective, might delay initiation of invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) in some patients. We aimed to determine early predictors of NIRS failure and develop a simple nomogram and online calculator that can identify patients at risk of NIRS failure. METHODS: We did a retrospective, multicentre observational study in 23 hospitals designated for patients with COVID-19 in China. Adult patients (&#8805;18 years) with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection and acute respiratory failure receiving NIRS were enrolled. A training cohort of 652 patients (21 hospitals) was used to identify early predictors of NIRS failure, defined as subsequent need for IMV or death within 28 days after intensive care unit admission. A nomogram was developed by multivariable logistic regression and concordance statistics (C-statistics) computed. C-statistics were validated internally by cross-validation in the training cohort, and externally in a validation cohort of 107 patients (two hospitals). FINDINGS: Patients were enrolled between Jan 1 and Feb 29, 2020. NIV failed in 211 (74%) of 286 patients and HFNC in 204 (56%) of 366 patients in the training cohort. NIV failed in 48 (81%) of 59 patients and HFNC in 26 (54%) of 48 patients in the external validation cohort. Age, number of comorbidities, respiratory rate-oxygenation index (ratio of pulse oximetry oxygen saturation/fraction of inspired oxygen to respiratory rate), Glasgow coma scale score, and use of vasopressors on the first day of NIRS in the training cohort were independent risk factors for NIRS failure. Based on the training dataset, the nomogram had a C-statistic of 0·80 (95% CI 0·74-0·85) for predicting NIV failure, and a C-statistic of 0·85 (0·82-0·89) for predicting HFNC failure. C-statistic values were stable in both internal validation (NIV group mean 0·79 [SD 0·10], HFNC group mean 0·85 [0·07]) and external validation (NIV group value 0·88 [95% CI 0·72-0·96], HFNC group value 0·86 [0·72-0·93]). INTERPRETATION: We have developed a nomogram and online calculator that can be used to identify patients with COVID-19 who are at risk of NIRS failure. These patients might benefit from early triage and more intensive monitoring.

In this work we evaluated the concentration of VitD in COVID-19 patients experiencing acute respiratory infections of different levels of severity excluding those who underwent invasive respiratory support. METHODS: The levels of serum VitD and C-reactive protein (CRP) were analyzed in 118 consecutive hospitalized COVID-19 patients (74M, 44F), confirmed with rRT-PCR. Of these patients with ventilation support 52 (44.1%) received oxygen via nasal cannula, oxygen mask or an oxygen mask with a reservoir, 48 (40.7%) were on a continuous positive airway pressure device (CPAP) and 18 (15,3%) on non-invasive mechanical ventilation (NIMV). RESULTS: The median values (range) of VitD and of CRP were 15.1 ng/mL (1.3-73.3) and 14.2 mg/L (5.0-151.2), respectively. A negative correlation from VitD levels and those of CRP (correlation coefficient - 0.259: P=0.005) was observed. VitD levels in O2 support patients were significantly higher than in both CPAP and NIMV patients. No statistical differences were found for CRP levels (P=0.834) among the three type of oxygen support. Fewer patients with O2 support had VitD <30 ng/mL and <20 ng/mL than CPAP and NIMV patients. There were no relationships between VitD and the three classes of IgM (P=0.419) and of IgG (P=0.862) SARS-CoV-2 antibodies values. The behavior was the same for CRP. CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that a significant proportion of COVID-19 patients have a VitD deficiency and that this condition is more frequent in CPAP and in NIMV patients.","Barassi, Alessandra; Pezzilli, Raffaele; Mondoni, Michele; Rinaldo, Rocco F; DavÌ, Matteo; Cozzolino, Mario; D039, Melzi; Eril, Gian Vico; Centanni, Stefano",Panminerva med,126,16

""Vaping"" is described as the use of electronic cigarettes (E-Cigarettes or E-Cigs), which has only more recently been available to the public (~10 years) but has quickly emerged as a popular means of tobacco consumption worldwide. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak as a global pandemic in March 2020. SARS-CoV-2 can easily be transmitted between people in close proximity through direct contact or respiratory droplets to develop coronavirus infectious disease 2019 (COVID-19). Symptoms of COVID-19 range from a mild flu-like illness with high fever to severe respiratory distress syndrome and death. The risk factors for increased disease severity remain unclear. Herein, we utilize a murine-tropic coronavirus (beta coronavirus) MHV-A59 along with a mouse model and measures of pathology (lung weight/dry ratios and histopathology) and inflammation (ELISAs and cytokine array panels) to examine whether vaping may exacerbate the pulmonary disease severity of coronavirus disease. While vaping alone did result in some noted pathology, mice exposed with intranasal vaped e-liquid suffered more severe mortality due to pulmonary inflammation than controls when exposed to coronavirus infection. Our data suggest a role for vaping in increased coronavirus pulmonary disease in a mouse model. Furthermore, our data indicate that disease exacerbation may involve calcium (Ca2+) dysregulation, identifying a potential therapeutic intervention.","Sivaraman, V.; Parker, D.; Zhang, R.; Jones, M.

Disparities in the consultation burden of sub-specialities and socio-demographic differences in teleconsultation utilization were also assessed. METHODS: Al-Shifa Trust Eye Hospital Rawalpindi began audio and video teleconsultation using broadband telecommunication services during the lockdown. Patients' and consultations' data gathered during the first three weeks after the commencement of this programme were compared with data from the four weeks prior to lockdown. The weekly consultation ratio and overall consultation burden of sub-specialities were measured. Chi-Square tests of association determined the relationship between different variables (socioeconomic status and consultation characteristics) and consultation modality (on-site vs online). RESULTS: In total, 17507 on-site consultations (4377/week) were conducted compared to 1431 teleconsultations (477/week), which maintained 10.89% of the weekly pre-lockdown eye care services. The post-lockdown teleconsultation programme saw a relatively higher percentage of service utility among female (47.09% vs 44.71%), younger-age (31.33±19.45 vs 41.25±23.32 years) and higher-socioeconomic-status (32.21% vs 0.30%) patients compared to pre-lockdown on-site consultations. The most common indication for teleconsultation was red-eye (16.70%). While cornea and glaucoma clinics maintained most of the pre-lockdown services (30.42% and 29% respectively), the highest dropout was seen in optometric and vitreoretinal services supporting only 5.54% and 8.28% of pre-lockdown services, respectively.

The diagnoses of CTX and sitosterolemia are often delayed for many years because of lack of physician awareness, often resulting in significant and unnecessary progression of disease. CTX may present with chronic diarrhea, juvenile onset cataracts, strikingly large xanthomas, and neurologic disease in the setting of a normal serum cholesterol, but markedly elevated serum or plasma cholestanol levels. These patients have a defect in producing the bile acid chenodoxycholate, and oral chenodeoxycholate therapy is essential for these patients in order to prevent neurologic complications. Sitosterolemia can present with xanthomas, anemia, thrombocytopenia, splenomegaly, very premature heart disease, and serum cholesterol levels that may be normal or elevated, along with marked elevations of plasma ß-sitosterol. These patients have a defect causing overabsorption of ß-sitosterol, and the treatment of choice is oral ezetimibe. SLOS presents with growth delay, intellectual disability, multiple structural anomalies, and low serum cholesterol levels, and the defect is reduced cholesterol production. Treatment consists of dietary cholesterol supplementation and oral bile acid therapy which raises serum cholesterol levels and may improve symptoms. The metabolic and genetic defects in these disorders have been defined.

This method requires a small amount of blood (usually 10 mL) and is rapid (less than 2 weeks to isolate antigen-specific mAbs). Due to the application of antigens as the bait to capture the specific memory B cells, the majority of isolated mAbs are true binders to the antigen, which increases the isolation efficiency. Here, applying this approach, we describe the characterization of mAbs against Zika virus from a convalescent patient sample. From 10 mL whole blood, we sorted 33 Zika envelope (E) protein-interacting single memory B cells. The Ig genes from 15 cells were determined, and 13 mAbs were found that bind to Zika E protein with varied binding affinities.","Wang, Qihui; Yan, Jinghua",Methods Mol Biol,126,16

We sought to estimate case detection percentages with various routine NP and saliva testing frequencies. DESIGN: Simulation modeling study. METHODS: We constructed a sensitivity function based on the average infectiousness profile of symptomatic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases to determine the probability of being identified at the time of testing. This function was fitted to reported data on the percent positivity of symptomatic COVID-19 patients using NP testing. We then simulated a routine testing program with different NP and saliva testing frequencies to determine case detection percentages during the infectious period, as well as the presymptomatic stage. RESULTS: Routine biweekly NP testing, once every 2 weeks, identified an average of 90.7% (SD, 0.18) of cases during the infectious period and 19.7% (SD, 0.98) during the presymptomatic stage. With a weekly NP testing frequency, the corresponding case detection percentages were 95.9% (SD, 0.18) and 32.9% (SD, 1.23), respectively. A 5-day saliva testing schedule had a similar case detection percentage as weekly NP testing during the infectious period, but identified ~10% more cases (mean, 42.5%; SD, 1.10) during the presymptomatic stage. CONCLUSION: Our findings highlight the utility of routine noninvasive saliva testing for frontline healthcare workers to protect vulnerable patient populations. A 5-day saliva testing schedule should be considered to help identify silent infections and prevent outbreaks in nursing homes and healthcare facilities.","Zhang, Kevin; Shoukat, Affan; Crystal, William; Langley, Joanne M; Galvani, Alison P; Moghadas, Seyed M",Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol,126,16

Since its emergence in December 2019, the virus has rapidly spread, transcending geographic barriers. The World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have declared COVID-19 as a public health crisis. Data regarding COVID-19 in pregnancy is limited, consisting of case reports and small cohort studies. However, obstetric patients are not immune from the current COVID-19 pandemic, and obstetric care will inevitably be impacted by the current epidemic. As such, clinical protocols and practice on labor and delivery units must adapt to optimize the safety of patients and health care workers and to better conserve health care resources. In this commentary, we provide suggestions to meet these goals without impacting maternal or neonatal outcomes. KEY POINTS: â¢ Novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a pandemic.â¢ COVID-19 impacts care of obstetric patients.â¢ Health care should be adapted for the COVID-19 pandemic.","Stephens, Angela J; Barton, John R; Bentum, Nana-Ama Ankumah; Blackwell, Sean C; Sibai, Baha M",Am J Perinatol,126,1

Personality was assessed in January/February 2020 when the public was not aware of the spread of coronavirus in the USA. Participants were reassessed in late March 2020 with four sets of questions about the pandemic: concerns, precautions, preparatory behaviours, and duration estimates. The sample consisted of N = 2066 participants (mean age = 51.42; range = 18-98; 48.5% women). Regression models were used to analyse the data with age, gender, education, race, and ethnicity as covariates. Consistent with the preregistered hypotheses, higher neuroticism was related to more concerns and longer duration estimates related to COVID-19, higher extraversion was related to shorter duration estimates, and higher conscientiousness was associated with more precautions. In contrast to the preregistered hypotheses, higher neuroticism was associated with fewer precautions and unrelated to preparatory behaviours. Age moderated several trait-response associations, suggesting that some of the responses were associated more strongly in older adults, a group at risk for complications of COVID-19. For example, older adults high in conscientiousness prepared more. The present findings provide insights into how personality predicts concerns and behaviours related to the COVID-19 pandemic. © 2020 European Association of Personality Psychology.","Aschwanden, Damaris; Strickhouser, Jason E; Sesker, Amanda A; Lee, Ji Hyun; Luchetti, Martina; Stephan, Yannick; Sutin, Angelina R; Terracciano, Antonio",,126,1

Based on this, the Gruppo Italiano Malattie Ematologiche dell'Adulto (GIMEMA) has recently developed a digital health tool dedicated to patients with hematologic malignancies: the GIMEMA-ALLIANCE platform. OBJECTIVE: The main objectives of this web-based platform are to generate relevant data to better understand quality of life, symptoms, and medication adherence during the COVID-19 pandemic and postpandemic era; to develop a prospective real-life registry on outcomes of patients with hematologic cancer, with or without a diagnosis of COVID-19; and to facilitate patient-centered care in routine practice. METHODS: The platform consists of physician- and patient-secure portals and enables electronic patient-reported outcome (ePRO) assessments with real-time graphical presentation to physicians of individual patient symptoms and quality-of-life outcomes. Automated alerts are sent to treating hematologists based on the following predetermined criteria: presence of clinically important problems and symptoms, problems with adherence to therapy, and risk of COVID-19 diagnosis. The platform also allows physicians to set up video consultations. Clinical information regarding disease and treatment as well as clinical and survival outcomes are also prospectively collected. RESULTS: Recruitment of participants started in December 2020. As of April 2021, a total of 116 patients have been enrolled in this study. Use of this platform may help to improve patient-physician communication and help hematologists in the early recognition of clinically important problems and symptoms of their patients. More than 20 community and university-based hospitals have currently agreed to participate. In addition to patient-reported outcome data, the prospective collection of disease- and treatment-related information, as well as data on possible COVID-19 diagnosis and COVID-19 vaccination, will allow the development of a large database to also identify subgroups of patients at risk of poor outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Data generated via this platform will help to answer clinically relevant questions for patients with hematologic malignancies during the COVID-19 pandemic and postpandemic era. The use of the GIMEMA-ALLIANCE platform in routine practice may also contribute to enhancing patient-centered care.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A web-based questionnaire was designed to differentiate the impact of the pandemic on inpatient and outpatient nuclear medicine operations and on public versus private health systems, respectively. Questions were addressing the following issues: impact on nuclear medicine diagnostics and therapy, use of recommendations, personal protective equipment, and organizational adaptations. The survey was available for 6 days and closed on April 20, 2020. RESULTS: 113 complete responses were recorded. Nearly all participants (97â%) report a decline of nuclear medicine diagnostic procedures. The mean reduction in the last three weeks for PET/CT, scintigraphies of bone, myocardium, lung thyroid, sentinel lymph-node are -14.4â%, -47.2â%, -47.5â%, -40.7â%, -58.4â%, and -25.2â% respectively. Furthermore, 76â% of the participants report a reduction in therapies especially for benign thyroid disease (-41.8â%) and radiosynoviorthesis (-53.8â%) while tumor therapies remained mainly stable. 48â% of the participants report a shortage of personal protective equipment.

This paper introduces a framework for managing, processing, analyzing, detecting, and tracking topics in streaming data. We propose a model selector procedure with a hybrid indicator to tackle the challenge of online topic detection. In this framework, we built an automatic data processing pipeline with two levels of cleaning. Regular and deep cleaning are applied using multiple sources of meta knowledge to enhance data quality. Deep learning and transfer learning techniques are used to classify health-related tweets, with high accuracy and improved F1-Score. In this system, we used visualization to have a better understanding of trending topics. To demonstrate the validity of this framework, we implemented and applied it to health-related twitter data from users originating in the USA over nine months. The results of this implementation show that this framework was able to detect and track the topics at a level comparable to manual annotation.

It is very efficient to apply computer-aided drug design techniques to quickly identify promising drug repurposing candidates, especially after the detailed 3D structures of key viral proteins are resolved. The virus causing COVID-19 is SARS-CoV-2. Taking advantage of a recently released crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 main protease in complex with a covalently bonded inhibitor, N3 (Liu et al., 10.2210/pdb6LU7/pdb), I conducted virtual docking screening of approved drugs and drug candidates in clinical trials. For the top docking hits, I then performed molecular dynamics simulations followed by binding free energy calculations using an end point method called MM-PBSA-WSAS (molecular mechanics/Poisson-Boltzmann surface area/weighted solvent-accessible surface area; Wang, Chem.

The second-best repurposing drug candidate, eravacycline, is synthetic halogenated tetracycline class antibiotic. Streptomycin, another antibiotic and a charged molecule, also demonstrates some inhibitory effect, even though the predicted binding free energy of the charged form (-3.8 kcal/mol) is not nearly as low as that of the neutral form (-7.9 kcal/mol). One bioactive, PubChem 23727975, has a binding free energy of -12.9 kcal/mol. Detailed receptor-ligand interactions were analyzed and hot spots for the receptor-ligand binding were identified. I found that one hot spot residue, His41, is a conserved residue across many viruses including SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, and hepatitis C virus (HCV). The findings of this study can facilitate rational drug design targeting the SARS-CoV-2 main protease.","Wang, Junmei",J Chem Inf Model,126,1

The disease can be spread by both symptomatic and asymptomatic infected individuals. Uncertainty remains over key aspects of the virus infectiousness (particularly the newly emerging variants) and the disease has had severe economic impacts globally. For these reasons, COVID-19 is the subject of intense and widespread discussion on social media platforms including Facebook and Twitter. These public forums substantially influence public opinions and in some cases can exacerbate the widespread panic and misinformation spread during the crisis. Thus, this work aimed to design an intelligent clustering-based classification and topic extracting model named TClustVID that analyzes COVID-19-related public tweets to extract significant sentiments with high accuracy. We gathered COVID-19 Twitter datasets from the IEEE Dataport repository and employed a range of data preprocessing methods to clean the raw data, then applied tokenization and produced a word-to-index dictionary. Thereafter, different classifications were employed on these datasets which enabled the exploration of the performance of traditional classification and TClustVID. Our analysis found that TClustVID showed higher performance compared to traditional methodologies that are determined by clustering criteria. Finally, we extracted significant topics from the clusters, split them into positive, neutral and negative sentiments, and identified the most frequent topics using the proposed model. This approach is able to rapidly identify commonly prevailing aspects of public opinions and attitudes related to COVID-19 and infection prevention strategies spreading among different populations.","Satu, Md Shahriare; Khan, Md Imran; Mahmud, Mufti; Uddin, Shahadat; Summers, Matthew A; Quinn, Julian M W; Moni, Mohammad Ali",Knowl Based Syst,126,17

Recent data suggests a high concentration of SARS-Cov2 receptors, ACE2 or TMPRSS2, in nasal epithelium and cornea, which explains person-to-person transmission. We investigated the prevalence of SARS-CoV2 receptors among reproductive tissues by exploring the single-cell sequencing datasets from uterus, myometrium, ovary, fallopian tube, and breast epithelium. We did not detect significant expression of either ACE2 or TMPRSS2 in the normal human myometrium, uterus, ovaries, fallopian tube, or breast. Furthermore, none of the cell types in the female reproductive organs we investigated, showed the co-expression of ACE2 with proteases, TMPRSS2, Cathepsin B (CTSB), and Cathepsin L (CTSL) known to facilitate the entry of SARS2-CoV2 into the host cell.

We aimed at exploring the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection in IBD patients during the two waves. PATIENTS AND METHODS: All IBD patients with a confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection were enrolled. They were sorted into two groups (those infected before September 2020, and those from September 2020 to January 2021) and compared by demographic and clinical data. RESULTS: Twenty-five patients (out of about 600 with a follow-up visit) were infected with SARS-CoV-2 (4.1%). Sixteen were male and the mean age was 46.5 ± 14.3 years (range 24-74). Six were smokers and 11 had comorbidities; 2 were on steroids and 17 on immunosuppressants or biologics. Three patients (12%) needed hospitalization and other three patients were treated with azithromycin, steroids and LMWH, all of them during the second wave. No patient died or developed any sequelae. Two subjects were infected during the first wave (0.3 vs. 3.83, p<0.0001). Non-significant differences were found between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: A higher number of IBD patients were infected during the second wave. No patient developed a severe form of pneumonia, even those treated with immunosuppressants or biologics. No risk factor for hospitalization was found.","Carparelli, S; Pastore, M R; Valvano, M R; Marseglia, A; Latiano, A; Palmieri, O; Guerra, M; Martino, G; Perri, F; Bossa, F",Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,126,16

Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) often present risk factors for postoperative complications. This accounts for reluctance to include them in ERPs. We compared outcome after right colectomy with an ERP in IBD and non-IBD patients. METHODS: In our GRACE colorectal surgery database comprising 508 patients, we analysed patients scheduled for right colectomy (n = 160). Adherence to the protocol, postoperative complications and length of hospital stay of IBD patients (n = 45) were compared with those of non-IBD patients (n = 115). Data (mean ± SD, median [IQR], count (%)) were compared by Student's t, Mann-Whitney U and chi-square tests when appropriate; p < 0.05 taken as statistically significant. RESULTS: IBD patients were significantly younger (38.9 ± 13.8 vs. 58.9 ± 18.5 years, p < 0.001) and had lower BMI (23.0 ± 5.0 vs. 25.1 ± 5.0 kg m-2, p < 0.01). Adherence to ERP was similar in the two groups. Resumption of eating on the day of the operation was less well tolerated (73.3% vs. 85.2%, p < 0.05) and postoperative pain (p < 0.001) was greater in IBD patients. The incidence of postoperative complications (13.3% vs. 17.3%) and the length of hospital stay (3 [3-4.5] vs. 3 [2-5] days) were comparable in IBD and non-IBD patients, respectively. CONCLUSION: The management of IBD patients in an ERP is not only feasible but also indicated. These patients benefit as much from ERP as non-IBD patients.","Meunier, Anne; Sorce, Giuseppe; Hardy, Pierre-Yves; Coimbra, Carla; Decker, Emmanuel; Joris, Jean",Int. j. colorectal. dis,126,21

Sargramostim is a man-made form of the naturally-occurring protein GM-CSF. TRIAL DESIGN: A phase 4 academic, prospective, 2 arm (1:1 ratio), randomized, open-label, controlled trial. PARTICIPANTS: Patients aged 18-80 years admitted to specialized COVID-19 wards in 5 Belgian hospitals with recent (< 2 weeks prior to randomization) confirmed COVID-19 infection and acute respiratory failure defined as a PaO2/FiO2 below 350 mmHg or SpO2 below 93% on minimal 2 L/min supplemental oxygen. Patients were excluded from the trial in case of (1) known serious allergic reactions to yeast-derived products, (2) lithium carbonate therapy, (3) mechanical ventilation prior to randomization, (4) peripheral white blood cell count above 25.000/µL and/or active myeloid malignancy, (5) high dose systemic steroid therapy (> 20 mg methylprednisolone or equivalent), (6) enrolment in another investigational study, (7) pregnant or breastfeeding or (8) ferritin levels > 2000 µg/mL. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Inhaled sargramostim 125 µg twice daily for 5 days in addition to standard care. Upon progression of disease requiring mechanical ventilation or to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and initiation of mechanical ventilator support within the 5 day period, inhaled sargramostim will be replaced by intravenous sargramostim 125 µg/m2 body surface area once daily until the 5 day period is reached. From day 6 onwards, progressive patients in the active group will have the option to receive an additional 5 days of IV sargramostim, based on the treating physician's assessment. Intervention will be compared to standard of care. Subjects progressing to ARDS and requiring invasive mechanical ventilatory support, from day 6 onwards in the standard of care group will have the option (clinician's decision) to initiate IV sargramostim 125m µg/m2 body surface area once daily for 5 days. MAIN OUTCOMES: The primary endpoint of this intervention is measuring oxygenation after 5 days of inhaled (and intravenous) treatment through assessment of a change in pretreatment and post-treatment ratio of PaO2/FiO2 and through measurement of the P(A-a)O2 gradient (PAO2= Partial alveolar pressure of oxygen, PaO2=Partial arterial pressure of oxygen; FiO2= Fraction of inspired oxygen). RANDOMISATION: Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio. Randomization will be done using REDCap (electronic IWRS system). BLINDING (MASKING): In this open-label trial neither participants, caregivers, nor those assessing the outcomes will be blinded to group assignment. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE): A total of 80 patients with confirmed COVID-19 and acute hypoxic respiratory failure will be enrolled, 40 in the active and 40 in the control group. TRIAL STATUS: SARPAC protocol Version 2.0 (April 15 2020). Participant recruitment is ongoing in 5 Belgian Hospitals (i.e. University Hospital Ghent, AZ Sint-Jan Bruges, AZ Delta Roeselare, University Hospital Brussels and ZNA Middelheim Antwerp).

At present, the disease is centered in Wuhan City and is spreading rapidly to all parts of China, as well as twenty other countries.About 20% of the people infected during the SARS epidemic in 2003 were employees in hospital environments.COVID-19 has infected an even greater number of heath care workers.Therefore, ophthalmologists need to understand the disease and recognize the importance of taking preventive measures.Although ophthalmologists do not work on the front lines of the outbreak, due to their area of expertise, a variety of situations, such as infection consultations or ophthalmic emergency treatments, can lead to the exposure of ophthalmologists to high-risk environments.This risk will only increase as the number of infected patients continues to increase.When dealing with seemingly normal ophthalmic patients, the vigilance of ophthalmologists and associated staff tends to be significantly reduced.To better protect patients, families, and health care workers, it is strongly recommended that in addition to the standard precautions for the care of all patients, strict contact precautions and droplet precautions need to be taken by ophthalmologists.These measures include (1) wearing an efficient mask (an N95 mask); (2) always performing hand hygiene before and after examining a patient; (3) wearing sterile gloves when entering a patient’s room and touching a patient; (4) wearing a gown when contact is expected with items and environmental surfaces surrounding a patient or when the patient is incontinent or has diarrhea or a surgical or other invasive wound with oozing fluid; (5) cleaning and disinfecting ophthalmic equipment and correctly handling medical waste after examination to prevent transmission to patients who are subsequently examined; (6) wearing goggles and a disposable mask to cover the front and sides of the face before touching a patient, as the virus could spread through the ocular surface; (7) performing the relevant screening for COVID-19 for regular patients who have conjunctivitis and respiratory symptoms at the same time; (8) prohibiting the use of infected patients as potential donors for corneal transplants and temporarily adding donor 2019-CoV screening to the medical standard of the eye bank during the outbreak; (9) for the purposes of scientific research, diagnosis, and other special needs, packing, shipping, and transporting collected specimens according to the relevant dangerous biological goods regulations.","Li, Zhijie",Zhonghua Shiyan Yanke Zazhi Chin.

One potential contributor to these challenges is the use of pesticides, particularly aquatic herbicides applied to aquatic habitats inhabited by amphibians. Critical issues of concern are the potential toxicity and teratogenicity of these herbicides towards amphibians. Using the FETAX protocol, three globally used formulations, including diquat dibromide (Midstream), glufosinate ammonium (Basta), and imazapyr (Arsenal), were assessed for embryotoxicity, teratogenicity, and growth inhibition. Developing Xenopus laevis embryos were exposed for 96 h at concentrations of 0.5-3.0 mg/L, 1.6-3.0 mg/L, and 20-45 mg/L for Midstream, Basta, and Arsenal respectively. The 96-h LC50 estimates were 0.83 mg/L acid equivalent (a.e.), 36 mg/L a.e., and 2.2 mg/L a.e., whereas the EC50 estimates were 0.24 mg/L a.e., 28.13 mg/L a.e., and 2.01 mg/L a.e. for the Midstream, Arsenal, and Basta formulations, respectively. These two estimates produced Teratogenic Index of 3.5, 1.3, and 1.1 for Midstream, Arsenal, and Basta, respectively, indicating a high risk of malformation induction by Midstream and moderate risk for Arsenal. Regarding growth inhibition, lowest observable effect concentrations of 0.5 mg/L, 25 mg/L, and 2.0 mg/L were computed for Midstream, Arsenal, and Basta, respectively, producing the minimum concentration inhibiting growth (MCIG) ratios of 0.62, 0.69, and 0.89 for the three formulations. These MICG values are higher than the standard 0.30 growth inhibitors benchmark, suggesting that the formulations are not growth inhibitors at the evaluated concentrations. This study provides evidence of the embryotoxic and teratogenic status of Midstream and the embryotoxicity of Basta. There is a need to further characterise the physiological and ecological impacts of these formulations to ensure responsible use and the safety of amphibians and other wildlife.","Babalola, Oluwaseun Olusegun; Truter, Johannes Christoff; Van Wyk, Johannes Hannes",Arch. environ. contam. toxicol,126,24

Atorvastatin was suggested a dose-dependent pro-angiogenic effect and ameliorating BBB permeability beyond its cholesterol-lowering effects. This study examined our hypothesis that, during vascular remodeling after stroke, treatment with atorvastatin could facilitate BBB maturation in remodeling vasculature in ischemic brain. Adult spontaneously hypertensive rats underwent middle cerebral artery occlusion with reperfusion (MCAO/RP). Atorvastatin, at dose of 3 mg/kg, was delivered daily starting at 14 days after MCAO/RP onset for 7 days. The rats were studied at multiple time points up to 8 weeks with multimodal-MRI, behavior tests, immunohistochemistry, and biochemistry. The delayed treatment of atorvastatin significantly reduced infarct size and BBB permeability, restored cerebral blood flow, and improved the neurological outcome at 8 weeks after MCAO/RP. Postmortem studies showed that atorvastatin promoted angiogenesis and stabilized the newly formed vessels in peri-infarct areas. Importantly, atorvastatin facilitated maturation of BBB properties in the new vessels by promoting endothelial tight junction (TJ) formation. Further in vivo and in vitro studies demonstrated that proliferating peri-vascular pericytes expressing neural-glial antigen 2 (NG2) mediated the role of atorvastatin on BBB maturation through regulating endothelial TJ strand formations. Our results suggested a therapeutic potential of atorvastatin in facilitating a full BBB integrity and functional stroke recovery, and an essential role for pericyte-mediated endothelial TJ formation in remodeling vasculature.","Yang, Yirong; Yang, Lisa Y; Salayandia, Victor M; Thompson, Jeffrey F; Torbey, Michel; Yang, Yi",Transl. stroke res.

However, this virus is reported as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) and all countries are trying to control and lockdown all places. The main objective of this work is to solve the five different tasks such as I) Predicting the spread of coronavirus across regions. II) Analyzing the growth rates and the types of mitigation across countries. III) Predicting how the epidemic will end. IV) Analyzing the transmission rate of the virus. V) Correlating the coronavirus and weather conditions. The advantage of doing these tasks to minimize the virus spread by various mitigation, how well the mitigations are working, how many cases have been prevented by this mitigations, an idea about the number of patients that will recover from the infection with old medication, understand how much time will it take to for this pandemic to end, we will be able to understand and analyze how fast or slow the virus is spreading among regions and the infected patient to reduce the spread based clear understanding of the correlation between the spread and weather conditions. In this paper, we propose a novel Support Vector Regression method to analysis five different tasks related to novel coronavirus. In this work, instead of simple regression line we use the supported vectors also to get better classification accuracy.

According to current literature, impairment of SARS-CoV-2 clearance due to genetic and viral features, lower levels of interferons, increased neutrophil extracellular traps, and increased pyroptosis and probable other unknown mechanisms create a background for severe disease course complicated by macrophage activation syndrome and cytokine storm. Various genetic mutations may also constitute a risk factor for severe disease course and occurrence of cytokine storm in COVID-19. Once, immunologic complications like cytokine storm occur, anti-viral treatment alone is not enough and should be combined with appropriate anti-inflammatory treatment. Anti-rheumatic drugs, which are tried for managing immunologic complications of COVID-19 infection, will also be discussed including chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, JAK inhibitors, IL-6 inhibitors, IL-1 inhibitors, anti-TNF-&#945; agents, corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), and colchicine. Early recognition and appropriate treatment of immunologic complications will decrease the morbidity and mortality in COVID-19 infection, which requires the collaboration of infectious disease, lung, and intensive care unit specialists with other experts such as immunologists, rheumatologists, and hematologists.","Soy, Mehmet; Keser, Gökhan; Atagündüz, Pamir; Tabak, Fehmi; Atagündüz, Isik; Kayhan, Servet",Clin Rheumatol,126,1

In this study, the COVID-19 connection with various weather parameters like temperature, wind speed, and relative humidity is investigated and the future scenario of COVID-19 is predicted based on the Gaussian model (GM). This study is conducted in Delhi, the capital city of India, during the lowest mobility rate due to strict lockdown nationwide for about two months from March 15 to May 17, 2020. Spearman correlation is applied to obtain the interconnection of COVID-19 cases with weather parameters. Based on statistical analysis, this has been observed that the temperature parameter shows a significant positive trend during the period of study. The number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 is fitted with respect to the number of days by using the Gaussian curve and it is estimated on the basis of the model that maximum cases will go up to 123,886 in number. The maximum number of cases will be observed during the range of 166 ± 36 days. It is also estimated by using the width of the fitted GM that it will take minimum of 10 months for the complete recovery from COVID-19. Additionally, the linear regression technique is used to find the trend of COVID-19 cases with temperature and it is estimated that with an increase in temperature by 1 °C, 30 new COVID-19 cases on daily basis will be expected to observe. This study is believed to be a preliminary study and to better understand the concrete relationship of coronavirus, at least one complete cycle is essential to investigate. The laboratory-based study is essential to be done to support the present field-based study. Henceforth, based on preliminary studies, significant inputs are put forth to the research community and government to formulate thoughtful strategies like medical facilities such as ventilators, beds, testing centers, quarantine centers, etc., to curb the effects of COVID-19.","Awasthi, Amit; Sharma, Aditi; Kaur, Prabhjot; Gugamsetty, Balakrishnaiah; Kumar, Akshay",Environ Dev Sustain,126,24

This observation led us to perform epidemiological analysis, using data in the public domain, to study the correlation of COVID-19 with the prevalence and vaccination strategies for two respiratory pathogens: flu and tuberculosis (TB). Countries showing more than 1000 COVID-19 deaths were selected at three time points during the ongoing pandemic: 17 May, 1 October and 31 December 2020. The major findings of this study that are broadly consistent at all three time points are: First, countries with high flu deaths negatively correlate with COVID-19 deaths/million. Second, TB incidences and deaths negatively correlate with COVID-19 deaths/million. Countries displaying high TB and flu deaths (Nigeria, Ethiopia, Myanmar, Indonesia, India) display lower COVID-19 deaths/million compared to countries with low TB and flu deaths (Italy, Spain, USA, France). Third, countries with greater flu vaccination display lower flu incidences but higher COVID-19 deaths/million and mortality rates. On the other hand, Bacillus Calmette Guerin (BCG) vaccination negatively correlates with Covid-19 deaths/million. Fourth, countries with only BCG, but no flu, vaccination show delayed and lower number of COVID-19 deaths/million compared to countries with flu, but no BCG, vaccination. Fifth, countries with high BCG vaccination coverage as well as high TB deaths display the lowest COVID-19 deaths/million. The implications of this global study are discussed with respect to the roles of respiratory infections and vaccinations in lowering COVID-19 deaths.","Pathak, Sanmoy; Jolly, Mohit Kumar; Nandi, Dipankar",Hum Vaccin Immunother,126,23

Massive changes in the health care system imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic clearly impact the overall quality of medical care. In this survey, we aim to explore experiences and concerns of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) regarding the current pandemic. METHODS: A 40-item web-based questionnaire on disease-related experiences and concerns during the COVID-19 pandemic was made available to patients with IBD from 28 April 2020 to 31 July 2020. RESULTS: An increased risk of SARS-CoV2 infection was a concern for 56.7% of the 1199 patients (aged 41.3±12.8, women 77%, Crohn's disease 58.8%, ulcerative colitis 38.5%); 61.7% feared an increased risk of severe disease course of COVID-19. Effective preventive measures in either outpatient practices or hospitals were observed by 84.7% of the patients. Appointments with an IBD specialist were canceled in 38.7%, frequently on the patients' initiative. Telecommunication visits were considered an acceptable alternative to personal visits by 71.0%. Medication was reduced or paused in 6.9% because of the pandemic. A swab (SARS-CoV2-PCR) was done in 13.2% of the patients; only 3 patients (0.25%) were tested positive. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic is a major concern of patients with IBD. However, the cumulative prevalence in our cohort is low. Patients at risk should be identified and counseled individually. When required because of the local COVID-19 situation, telecommunication visits and liberal prescription policies are advisable to reduce in-person contacts, while ensuring continuous therapy and maintaining communication with patients.","Schlabitz, Franziska; Teich, Niels; Riesner-Wehner, Anica; Böhm, Sebastian; Greinert, Robin; Eisenmann, Stephan; Michl, Patrick; Walldorf, Jens",J. clin. gastroenterol,126,10

Globally, scientists are working day and night to find the best possible solution to treat the deadly virus. During the first few months of 2020, the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak quickly developed into a pandemic, with a mortality rate that was increasing at an exponential rate day by day. As a result, scientists have turned to a drug repurposing approach, to rediscover the potential use and benefits of existing approved drugs. Currently, there is no single drug approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), for the treatment of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2, previously known as 2019-nCoV) that causes COVID-19. Based on only in-vitro studies, several active drugs are already in the clinical pipeline, made possible by following the compassionate use of medicine protocols. This method of repurposing and the use of existing molecules like Remdesivir (GS-5734), Chloroquine, Hydroxychloroquine, etc. has proven to be a landmark in the field of drug rediscovery.

We aimed to describe the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 among children and adult staff in summer schools. METHODS: During July 2020 we prospectively recruited children and adult staff attending summer schools in Barcelona who had SARS-CoV-2 infection. Primary SARS-CoV-2 infections were identified through: (1) surveillance program in 22 summer schools' of 1905 participants, involving weekly saliva sampling for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR during 2-5 weeks; (2)cases identified through the Catalonian Health Surveillance System of children diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection by nasopharyngeal RT-PCR. All centres followed prevention protocols: bubble groups, hand washing, facemasks and conducting activities mostly outdoors. Contacts of a primary case within the same bubble were evaluated by nasopharyngeal RT-PCR. Secondary attack rates and effective reproduction number in summer schools(R*) were calculated. RESULTS: Among the over 2000 repeatedly screened participants, 30children and 9adults were identified as primary cases. A total of 253 close contacts of these primary cases were studied (median 9 (IQR 5-10) for each primary case), among which twelve new cases (4.7%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2. The R* was 0.3, whereas the contemporary rate in the general population from the same areas in Barcelona was 1.9. CONCLUSIONS: The transmission rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection among children attending school-like facilities under strict prevention measures was lower than that reported for the general population. This suggests that under preventive measures schools are unlikely amplifiers of SARS-CoV-2 transmission and supports current recommendations for school opening.","Jordan, Iolanda; de Sevilla, Mariona Fernandez; Fumado, Victoria; Bassat, Quique; Bonet-Carne, Elisenda; Fortuny, Claudia; Garcia-Miquel, Aleix; Jou, Cristina; Adroher, Cristina; Casas, María Melé; Girona-Alarcon, Mònica; Garcia, María Hernández; Tomas, Gemma Pons; Ajanovic, Sara; Arias, Sara; Balanza, Núria; Baro, Bárbara; Millat-Martinez, Pere; Varo, Rosauro; Alonso, Sergio; Álvarez-Lacalle, Enric; López, Daniel; Claverol, Joana; Cubells, Marta; Brotons, Pedro; Codina, Anna; Cuadras, Daniel; Bruijning-Verhagen, Patricia; Faust, Saul; Munro, Alasdair; Muñoz-Almagro, Carmen; Català, Martí; Prats, Clara; Garcia-Garcia, Juan José; Gratacós, Eduard",Clin. infect. dis,126,16

Many clinical trials and insights are ongoing in the struggle with this pandemic of SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 entry into the host cell requires host cell angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) and glucose regulated protein 78 (GRP78). On the other hand, proteolytic activation of the viral spike protein (S protein) needs the host cell serine proteases, including transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2), cathepsins, trypsin and furin.

From the richest and most advanced nations to the poorest and least developed it exposed all of our vulnerabilities. The loss of life, health disparities and economic adversities, aggravated by political and ideological tensions, added multiple layers of stress and anxieties to an already stressed American society. METHODS: The educational institutions in the United States from the central to the local units demonstrated coherence in leadership, guided with flexibility and compassion, which paved the way for smooth operations. However, the anxiety among students and faculty on university and college campuses, is undeniable. In-person instruction was haulted. Research labs and officeswere locked down or operating with limited personnel Thus, the challenges to have timely instruction and to move the research enterprise forward have been enormous. Provided here is a perspective gathered from a literature search using PubMed and google with search words ""COVID-19, stress, college students"", ""COVID-19, stress, US graduate students"", and ""COVID-19, stress, postdoc researchers"". RESULTS: This article is an opinion piece, part personal and part peer experiences. It is presented in light of studies suggesting that the COVID-19 pandemic has imposed significant mental stress and anxiety upon students and faculty members within the academy. CONCLUSION: Loss of face-to-face interactions as a result of virtual instruction, lack of in-person mentoring, and loss of research productivity has taken its toll on the mental health and well- being of the academic community. Despite the challenges of the pandemic, the ingenuity of the human spirit has innovated solutions to catch up on research productivity and to pursue academic excellence.","Salim, Samina",Curr. neuropharmacol,126,1

Random effects analyses of randomized clinical trials and matched control data demonstrated that patients with COVID-19 transfused with convalescent plasma exhibited a lower mortality rate compared with patients receiving standard treatments. Additional analyses showed that early transfusion (within 3 days of hospital admission) of higher titer plasma is associated with lower patient mortality. These data provide evidence favoring the efficacy of human convalescent plasma as a therapeutic agent in hospitalized patients with COVID-19.","Klassen, Stephen A; Senefeld, Jonathon W; Johnson, Patrick W; Carter, Rickey E; Wiggins, Chad C; Shoham, Shmuel; Grossman, Brenda J; Henderson, Jeffrey P; Musser, James; Salazar, Eric; Hartman, William R; Bouvier, Nicole M; Liu, Sean T H; Pirofski, Liise-Anne; Baker, Sarah E; van Helmond, Noud; Wright, R Scott; Fairweather, DeLisa; Bruno, Katelyn A; Wang, Zhen; Paneth, Nigel S; Casadevall, Arturo; Joyner, Michael J",Mayo Clin Proc,126,22

Instead of developing two individual technologies, the 6G cellular network is expected to naturally support both communication and radar functionalities with shared hardware and carrier frequencies. In this regard, radio access technology (RAT)-based scatterer localization system is one of the important aspects of joint communication and sensing system (JCAS) that uses communication signals between transceivers to determine the location of scatterers in and around the propagation paths. In this article, we first identify the challenges of RAT-based scatterer localization system, then present single- and multiple-bounce reflection loss (RL) simulation results for three common building materials in indoor environments.

This study investigated implicit self-esteem-unconscious valenced self-evaluation-as a potential pathway linking childhood abuse with depression and suicidal ideation. A sample of youth aged 8-16 years (N = 240) completed a self-esteem Implicit Association Test (IAT) and assessments of abuse exposure, and psychopathology symptoms, including depression, suicidal ideation, anxiety, and externalizing symptoms. Psychopathology symptoms were re-assessed 1-3 years later. Childhood abuse was positively associated with baseline and follow-up depression symptoms and suicidal ideation severity, and negatively associated with implicit self-esteem. Lower implicit self-esteem was associated with both depression and suicidal ideation assessed concurrently and predicted significant increases in depression and suicidal ideation over the longitudinal follow-up period. Lower implicit self-esteem was also associated with baseline anxiety, externalizing symptoms, and a general psychopathology factor (i.e. p-factor). We found an indirect effect of childhood abuse on baseline and follow-up depression symptoms and baseline suicidal ideation through implicit self-esteem. These findings point to implicit self-esteem as a potential mechanism linking childhood abuse to depression and suicidal ideation.","Reid-Russell, Azure; Miller, Adam Bryant; Cvencek, Dario; Meltzoff, Andrew N; McLaughlin, Katie A",Dev Psychopathol,126,2

The scarcity of trained molecular biologists for analyzing PCR results makes data verification a challenge. Artificial intelligence (AI) was designed to ease verification, by detecting atypical profiles in PCR curves caused by contamination or artifacts. Four classes of simulated real-time RT-PCR curves were generated, namely, positive, early, no, and abnormal amplifications. Machine learning (ML) models were generated and tested using small amounts of data from each class. The best model was used for classifying the big data obtained by the Virology Laboratory of Simon Bolivar University from real-time RT-PCR curves for SARS-CoV-2, and the model was retrained and implemented in a software that correlated patient data with test and AI diagnoses. The best strategy for AI included a binary classification model, which was generated from simulated data, where data analyzed by the first model were classified as either positive or negative and abnormal. To differentiate between negative and abnormal, the data were reevaluated using the second model. In the first model, the data required preanalysis through a combination of prepossessing. The early amplification class was eliminated from the models because the numbers of cases in big data was negligible. ML models can be created from simulated data using minimum available information. During analysis, changes or variations can be incorporated by generating simulated data, avoiding the incorporation of large amounts of experimental data encompassing all possible changes. For diagnosing SARS-CoV-2, this type of AI is critical for optimizing PCR tests because it enables rapid diagnosis and reduces false positives. Our method can also be used for other types of molecular analyses.","Villarreal-González, Reynaldo; Acosta-Hoyos, Antonio J; Garzon-Ochoa, Jaime A; Galán-Freyle, Nataly J; Amar-Sepúlveda, Paola; Pacheco-Londoño, Leonardo C",Molecules (Basel),126,1

OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to identify the clinical characteristics and risk factors associated with severe incidence of SARS ­CoV­2 infection. PATIENTS AND METHODS: All adult patients (median [IQR] age, 52 [37-58] years) consecutively admitted to the Dabieshan Medical Center from January 30, 2020 to February 11, 2020 were collected and reviewed. Only patients diagnosed with COVID­19 according to the World Health Organization interim guidance were included in this retrospective cohort study. RESULTS: A total of 108 patients with COVID­19 were retrospectively analyzed. Twenty­five patients (23.1%) developed severe disease, and of those 12 patients (48%) died. Advanced age, comorbidities (most commonly hypertension), higher blood leukocyte count, neutrophil count, higher C­reactive protein level, D­dimer level, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) score, and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score were associated with greater risk of COVID­19, and so were lower lymphocyte count and albumin level. Multivariable regress ion showed increasing odds of severe COVID­19 associated with higher SOFA score (odds ratio [OR], 2.45; 95% CI, 1.302-4.608; P = 0.005), and lymphocyte count less than 0.8 × 109/l (OR, 9.017; 95% CI, 2.808-28.857; P <0.001) on admission. Higher SOFA score (OR, 2.402; 95% CI, 1.313-4.395; P = 0.004) on admission was identified as risk factor for in­hospital death. CONCLUSIONS: Lymphocytopenia and a higher SOFA score on admission could help clinicians to identify patients at high risk for developing severe COVID­19. More related studies are needed in the future.","Yao, Qingchun; Wang, Peng; Wang, Xingguang; Qie, Guoqiang; Meng, Mei; Tong, Xiwen; Bai, Xue; Ding, Min; Liu, Weiming; Liu, Keke; Chu, Yufeng",Pol Arch Intern Med,126,16

This paper focuses on Veterans as a potentially vulnerable group that might be systematically more exposed to infection than others because of their co-morbidities, i.e., greater incidence of physical and mental health challenges. Using data on 122 Veteran Healthcare Systems (HCS), this paper tests three machine learning models for predictive analysis. The combined LASSO and ridge regression with five-fold cross validation performs the best. We find that socio-demographic features are highly predictive of both cases and deaths-even more important than any hospital-specific characteristics. These results suggest that socio-demographic and social capital characteristics are important determinants of public health outcomes, especially for vulnerable groups, like Veterans, and they should be investigated further.","Makridis, Christos A; Mudide, Anish; Alterovitz, Gil",Pac Symp Biocomput,126,1

Although most transplanted patients mounted spike-specific T helper cell responses, frequencies were significantly reduced compared to controls and dialysis patients, accompanied by a broad impairment in effector cytokine production, memory differentiation and activation-related signatures. Spike-specific CD8+ T cell responses were less abundant than their CD4+ counterparts in healthy controls and hemodialysis patients and almost undetectable in transplant patients.

There is a relevant gap between the legal framework and the actual state of implementation. Healthcare providers play an important role in this implementation process as they are increasingly confronted with the application of telemedical scenarios. Therefore, the aim of this survey was to determine attitudes towards telemedicine of postgraduate trainees in Family Medicine (FM) in Germany. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted between July and October 2016 among postgraduate trainees in FM throughout Germany. The questionnaire covered four topics: attitudes towards telemedicine, barriers for the implementation of telemedicine, assessment of useful telemedical applications and telemedicine scenarios. A descriptive approach was used to analyze the data in order to derive determinants for the implementation of telemedicine. RESULTS: In total, 388 postgraduate trainees from 13 of the 16 federal states in Germany answered the survey. Seventy-eight percent were female. Participants' mean age was 36 years. The majority of participants believed that only a fraction of the already existing technology in telemedicine is being used (70 %). The largest perceived barrier to telemedicine was data safety concerns. More than half of the participants (54 %) believed that telemedicine would change the doctor-patient relationship. 51 % of the participants were interested in training in telemedicine. In this respect, it is important to note that 27 % of the postgraduate trainees said their willingness to practice in rural areas might be facilitated through the availability of telemedical backup for family physicians. CONCLUSIONS: Participating trainees in FM in Germany think that the potential for telemedicine is not yet fully exploited. Based on the results of this survey the next steps to be taken for the implementation of telemedicine applications can be addressed.","Waschkau, Alexander; Flägel, Kristina; Goetz, Katja; Steinhäuser, Jost",,126,1

However, individuals and organizations may lack the experience and skills that would be considered fundamental prerequisites to adopting telehealth in less urgent times. What are those skills? Before the pandemic, the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) convened national experts to identify and articulate a consensus set of critical telehealth skills for clinicians. Methods: Through a structured review of the literature, followed by several rounds of review and refinement by committee and community members via a modified Delphi process, the committee came to consensus on a set of skills required by clinicians to provide quality care via telehealth. Conclusion: The consensus set of telehealth skills presented in this paper, developed by the AAMC and national experts, can serve providers and health systems seeking to ensure that clinicians are prepared to meet the demand for care delivered via telehealth now and in the future.","Galpin, Kevin; Sikka, Neal; King, Sarah L; Horvath, Keith A; Shipman, Scott A",Telemed. j. e. health,126,16

However, traditional air cleaning systems (e.g. fibrous filter, electrostatic removal system) have some risks in operation process, including re-aerosolization and electric breakdown. To avoid these risks, the current study proposed an UV+Filter (ultraviolet and fibrous pleated filter) system to efficiently capture airborne SARS-CoV-2 aerosols and deactivate them in filter medium. It is challenging to quantitatively design UV+Filter due to complex characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 aerosols (e.g. aerodynamic size, biological susceptibility) and hybrid filtration/disinfection processes. This study numerically investigated the overall performances of different air cleaning devices (e.g. Fibrous-filter, UV+Filter, two-stage ESP (electrostatic precipitator) et al.) for removal of SARS-CoV-2 aerosols and compared them in term of filtration efficiency, energy consumption and secondary pollution. The prediction of developed models was validated with the experimental data from literature. UV+Filter is the most reliable and safest, while its energy consumption is highest.

T cells play a critical role in antiviral immunity but their numbers and functional state in COVID-19 patients remain largely unclear. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the counts of T cells and serum cytokine concentration from data of 522 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and 40 healthy controls. In addition, the expression of T cell exhaustion markers were measured in 14 COVID-19 cases. Results: The number of total T cells, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were dramatically reduced in COVID-19 patients, especially in patients requiring Intensive Care Unit (ICU) care. Counts of total T cells, CD8+ T cells or CD4+ T cells lower than 800, 300, or 400/µL, respectively, were negatively correlated with patient survival. T cell numbers were negatively correlated to serum IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-&#945; concentration, with patients in the disease resolution period showing reduced IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-&#945; concentrations and restored T cell counts. T cells from COVID-19 patients had significantly higher levels of the exhausted marker PD-1. Increasing PD-1 and Tim-3 expression on T cells was seen as patients progressed from prodromal to overtly symptomatic stages. Conclusions: T cell counts are reduced significantly in COVID-19 patients, and the surviving T cells appear functionally exhausted. Non-ICU patients with total T cells counts lower than 800/µL may still require urgent intervention, even in the immediate absence of more severe symptoms due to a high risk for further deterioration in condition.","Diao, Bo; Wang, Chenhui; Tan, Yingjun; Chen, Xiewan; Liu, Ying; Ning, Lifen; Chen, Li; Li, Min; Liu, Yueping; Wang, Gang; Yuan, Zilin; Feng, Zeqing; Zhang, Yi; Wu, Yuzhang; Chen, Yongwen",Front Immunol,126,16

ST-4 is a TCR-enhanced mutant derived from superantigen staphylococcal enterotoxin C2 (SEC2), which can hyperactivate CD4+ T cells without MHC class II molecules. However, whether ST-4/SEC2 can enhance metabolic reprogramming in CD8+ T cells remains poorly understood. In this study, we found that ST-4, but not SEC2, could induce proliferation of purified CD8+ T cell from BALB/c mice in Vß8.2- and -8.3-specific manners. Results of gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy analysis showed that fatty acid contents in CD8+ T cells were increased after ST-4 stimulation. Flow cytometry and Seahorse analyses showed that ST-4 significantly promoted mitochondrial energy metabolism in CD8+ T cells. We also observed significantly upregulated levels of gene transcripts for fatty acid uptake and synthesis, and significantly increased protein expression levels of fatty acid and mitochondrial metabolic markers of mTOR/PPARÎ³/SREBP1 and p38-MAPK signaling pathways in ST-4-activated CD8+ T cells. However, blocking mTOR, PPARÎ³, SREBP1, or p38-MAPK signals with specific inhibitors could significantly relieve the enhanced fatty acid catabolism and mitochondrial capacity induced by ST-4. In addition, blocking these signals inhibited ST-4-stimulated CD8+ T cell proliferation and effector functions. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that ST-4 enhanced fatty acid and mitochondria metabolic reprogramming through mTOR/PPARÎ³/SREBP and p38-MAPK signaling pathways, which may be important regulatory mechanisms of CD8+ T cell activation. Understanding the effects of ST-4-induced regulatory metabolic networks on CD8+ T cells provide important mechanistic insights to superantigen-based tumor therapy.","Fu, Xuanhe; Xu, Mingkai; Zhang, Huiwen; Li, Yongqiang; Li, Yansheng; Zhang, Chenggang",J Immunol,126,24

The routine blood workup parameters of COVID-19 patients did not change much and their mean counts were in the normal range. There were 38.5% of control patients had higher procalcitonin (PCT) levels than 0.5 ng/mL, which was significantly higher than that percentage of COVID-19 patients (X2 = 22.636; P < .05), and COVID-19 patients were also more likely to have decreased or normal urea and creatinine levels than control patients (X2 = 24.930, 8.480; P < .05).Younger age, exposure to Wuhan, fever, cough, and slight changes in routine blood workup parameters, urea and creatinine were important features discriminating COVID-19 from control patients. Slightly increased, but far less than 0.5 ng/mL, PCT levels also differentiated COVID-19 patients from control patients.","Chen, Xinyi; Yang, Yi; Huang, Min; Liu, Lili; Zhang, Xianxiang; Xu, Jing; Geng, Shaoqing; Han, Bo; Xiao, Jiangfeng; Wan, Yanyun",J. med. virol,126,31

Moreover, little is known about the effects that on-campus students may have on local higher-risk communities. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to estimate the range of potential community and campus COVID-19 exposures, infections, and mortality under various university reopening plans and uncertainties. METHODS: We developed campus-only, community-only, and campus × community epidemic differential equations and agent-based models, with inputs estimated via published and grey literature, expert opinion, and parameter search algorithms. Campus opening plans (spanning fully open, hybrid, and fully virtual approaches) were identified from websites and publications. Additional student and community exposures, infections, and mortality over 16-week semesters were estimated under each scenario, with 10% trimmed medians, standard deviations, and probability intervals computed to omit extreme outliers. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to inform potential effective interventions. RESULTS: Predicted 16-week campus and additional community exposures, infections, and mortality for the base case with no precautions (or negligible compliance) varied significantly from their medians (4- to 10-fold). Over 5% of on-campus students were infected after a mean of 76 (SD 17) days, with the greatest increase (first inflection point) occurring on average on day 84 (SD 10.2 days) of the semester and with total additional community exposures, infections, and mortality ranging from 1-187, 13-820, and 1-21 per 10,000 residents, respectively. Reopening precautions reduced infections by 24%-26% and mortality by 36%-50% in both populations. Beyond campus and community reproductive numbers, sensitivity analysis indicated no dominant factors that interventions could primarily target to reduce the magnitude and variability in outcomes, suggesting the importance of comprehensive public health measures and surveillance. CONCLUSIONS: Community and campus COVID-19 exposures, infections, and mortality resulting from reopening campuses are highly unpredictable regardless of precautions. Public health implications include the need for effective surveillance and flexible campus operations.","Benneyan, James; Gehrke, Christopher; Ilies, Iulian; Nehls, Nicole",JMIR Public Health Surveill,126,12

Matériels et méthodes Pendant la première vague de l’épidémie, l’Espagne, l’Italie, la France, le Portugal, le Canada et les États-Unis ont présenté une propagation précoce, une mortalité/morbidité élevée, et une réponse de santé publique initiale limitée, jusqu’à des mesures de confinement national ou régional. Dans un contexte où l’accès aux tests était limité, nous avons estimé le nombre de reproduction de base (R0) régional à partir de la croissance des nombres de décès quotidiens enregistrés tels que rapportés par les autorités sanitaires nationales. Les données météorologiques ont été extraites à partir des données mises à disposition par l’US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration via le package R {worldmet}. La relation entre R0 et les paramètres météorologiques a été analysée par un modèle généralisé additif (GAM) sous l’hypothèse d’une relation linéaire ou non linéaire (splines) en ajustant sur la densité de population, la proximité avec la première région touchée du pays et la proportion de personnes&gt;80 ans. Résultats Après exclusion des régions n’ayant pas présenté une phase de croissance exponentielle, 63 régions ont été analysées sur les 128 régions/états des 6 pays étudiés. Le R0 a été estimé sur une durée médiane de 11jours (interquartile=9–14). La valeur médiane de R0 était de 2,58 (interquartile=2,08–2,66). L’humidité absolue médiane était de 4,98g/m3 (min-max: 2,26, 11,32) et la température 9.8°C (min-max: −2, 19,9). Dans le modèle multivarié, la température et l’humidité étaient négativement associées à la transmissibilité du SARS-CoV-2. Une diminution de 1g/m3 était associée à une augmentation de 0,15 du R0 (p-value=0,034, déviance expliquée 33,6 %). La température était également négativement associée au R0, mais avec une relation non linéaire : en dessous de 10°C, la baisse d’1°C de la température était associée à une augmentation de 0,16 du R0 (p-value=0,00655, devance expliquée 41,5 %). Conclusion Nos résultats confirment que la transmissibilité du SARS-CoV-2 dépendait des conditions météorologiques/climatiques en l’absence de mesures de contrôle, durant la première vague, et quantifient cet écart. Il existait un écart de près d’une unité de R0 entre les régions ayant un climat hivernal doux (humidité ∼8g/m3, températures ∼10°C et plus) et celle ayant un climat rigoureux (humidité 3g/m3, températures&lt;5°C). Cette dépendance repose probablement à la fois sur des effets biologiques sur la survie du virus, sa diffusion et sa capacité à pénétrer les muqueuses hôtes et des effets comportementaux liés aux habitudes hivernales. La transition entre des conditions estivales et automnales dans l’hémisphère nord a probablement contribué à l’accélération de la 2e vague dans les pays occidentaux. Les stratégies de contrôle du virus doivent prendre en compte l’augmentation de la transmissibilité en conditions hivernales.","Landier, J.; Paireau, J.; Rebaudet, S.; Legendre, E.; Lehot, L.; Fontanet, A.; Cauchemez, S.; Gaudart, J.",Infectious Diseases Now,126,1

This study considers whether greeting/affectionate touch is a function of characteristics such as race, gender, and socioeconomic status. Data come from Wave 1 (2005-2006) of the NSHAP study from the United States. Results reveal that women experienced more frequent touch relative to men, net of several features of the interpersonal environment. Mediation analyses revealed that gender differences in associations with touch were partially explained by women's greater participation in formal and informal social activity. No patterns were detected related to race, education, or wealth. This study situates greeting/affectionate touch as a form of corporeal non-verbal interaction that offers a unique lens into patterns of social connection.

It has confined people to their homes, radically disturbed their taken-for-granted knowledge and beliefs, and forced them to alter behaviors once casually, even unthinkingly, employed in their everyday personal, working, and social lives. What has been learned? How might this experience stimulate a reimagining of the curriculum? More fundamentally, how might it lead to the development of a knowledgeable, intelligent, effective public, able to engage freely and equally in decision-making at all levels of social, cultural, political, and economic life, as a condition for personal freedom? This article explores the implications of ""lockdown"" or ""confinement"" to homes, which has suspended freedom of movement, limited the freedom to associate with others, and established rituals of hygiene regarding surfaces. These experiences of physical confinement and limitation of ordinary freedoms raise the central question of how to return to ""normal"" and, indeed, what will count as normal. In exploring the issues posed by these questions, this article offers an approach to pedagogical and curriculum practice that seeks to embed democratic practice at all levels of organization and interaction between individuals.","Goodson, Ivor F; Schostak, John F",Prospects (Paris),126,26

To reduce the impact of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, the Italian Government decision-makers issued a series of law decrees that imposed measures limiting social contacts, stopped non-essential production activities, and restructured public health care in order to privilege assistance to patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. Health care services were substantially limited including planned hospitalization and elective surgeries. These substantial measures were criticized due to their impact on individual rights including freedom and autonomy, but were justified by the awareness that hospitals would have been unable to cope with the surge of infected people who needed treatment for COVID-19. The imbalance between the need to guarantee ordinary care and to deal with the pandemic, in a context of limited health resources, raises ethical concerns as well as clinical management issues. The emergency scenario caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, especially in the lockdown phase, led the Government and health care decision-makers to prioritize community safety above the individuals' rights. This new community-centered approach to clinical care has created tension among the practitioners and exposed health workers to malpractice claims.

The fusion process of two cell aggregates is commonly studied as the coalescence of two viscous drops. However, tissues are complex materials and can exhibit viscoelastic behaviour. It is known that elastic effects can prevent the complete fusion of two drops, a phenomenon known as arrested coalescence. Here we report the presence of this phenomenon in stem cell aggregates and provide a theoretical framework which agrees with the experiments. In addition, agent-based simulations show that cell protrusion activity controls a solid-to-fluid phase transition, revealing that arrested coalescence can be found in the vicinity of an unjamming transition. By analysing the dynamics of the fusion process and combining it with nanoindentation measurements, we obtain the effective viscosity, shear modulus and surface tension of the aggregates. More generally, our work provides a simple, fast and inexpensive method to characterize the mechanical properties of viscoelastic materials.","Oriola, David; Marin-Riera, Miquel; Anlas, Kerim; Gritti, Nicola; Matsumiya, Marina; Aalderink, Germaine; Ebisuya, Miki; Sharpe, James; Trivedi, Vikas",,126,23

It is therefore important to evaluate associated cognitive factors. We aimed to obtain first endorsement rate estimates of coronavirus-related conspiracy beliefs in a German-speaking general population sample and investigate whether delusion-related reasoning biases and paranoid ideation are associated with such beliefs. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional non-probability online study, quota-sampled for age and gender, with 1684 adults from Germany and German-speaking Switzerland. We assessed general and specific coronavirus conspiracy beliefs, reasoning biases [jumping-to-conclusions bias (JTC), liberal acceptance bias (LA), bias against disconfirmatory evidence (BADE), possibility of being mistaken (PM)], and paranoid ideation, using established experimental paradigms and self-report questionnaires. RESULTS: Around 10% of our sample endorsed coronavirus-related CT beliefs at least strongly, and another 20% to some degree. Overall endorsement was similar to levels observed in a UK-based study (Freeman et al., 2020b). Higher levels of conspiracy belief endorsement were associated with greater JTC, greater LA, greater BADE, higher PM, and greater paranoid ideation. Associations were mostly small to moderate and best described by non-linear relationships. CONCLUSIONS: A noticeable proportion of our sample recruited in Germany and German-speaking Switzerland endorsed coronavirus conspiracy beliefs strongly or to some degree. These beliefs are associated with reasoning biases studied in delusion research. The non-probability sampling approach limits the generalizability of findings. Future longitudinal and experimental studies investigating conspiracy beliefs along the lines of reasoning are encouraged to validate reasoning aberrations as risk factors.","Kuhn, Sarah Anne Kezia; Lieb, Roselind; Freeman, Daniel; Andreou, Christina; Zander-Schellenberg, Thea",Psychol Med,126,23

Methods: A total of 1122 HCW (approximately 25% of the employees) of a large tertiary care hospital in India were recruited for this cross-sectional study. COVID PCR-positive HCW were excluded. Based on their risk-assessment, participants were grouped into three categories. A questionnaire was administered and they were tested for SARS-CoV-2-IgG antibodies using the chemiluminescence. Results: The overall seroprevalence among workers was 11.94%, which included 19.85% in COVID units, 11.09% in non-COVID units, and 8% in administrative workers (p=0.007). Antibody prevalence was highest in the department of gastroenterology (11.94%), followed by oncology (10.53%), pathology (10.26%), emergency medicine (7.84%) and critical care medicine (7%). Housekeeping staff, food and beverage staff, lab assistants and technicians had higher seroprevalence rate than doctors and nurses (p < 0.0001). HCW with a history of BCG vaccination in childhood and those who received an adequate prophylactic dose of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) had a lower seroprevalence as compared to those who did not (7.31% vs. 16.8% and 1.30% vs. 11.25% respectively). Conclusion: BCG vaccination, HCQ prophylaxis, and the job profile influence the seroprevalence rate in HCW. Seroprevalence rate and follow-up evaluation of its durability may help hospitals to triage their staff at risk, rationalize their placement, prioritize the use of PPE, thereby potentially reducing the risk.","Goenka, Mahesh; Afzalpurkar, Shivaraj; Goenka, Usha; Das, Sudipta Sekhar; Mukherjee, Mohuya; Jajodia, Surabhi; Shah, Bhavik Bharat; Patil, Vikram Uttam; Rodge, Gajanan; Khan, Ujjwayini; Bandyopadhyay, Syamasis",J Assoc Physicians India,126,23

METHODS: The search was conducted on April 30 and May 7, 2020, using Ovid database and Google search. Patients' characteristics, clinical outcomes, as well as selected characteristics regarding antibiotic use (indication, class used, rates and types of bacterial secondary and co-infection, and duration of treatment) were analyzed. RESULTS: Nineteen clinical studies reporting data from 2834 patients were included. Mean rate of antibiotic use was 74.0 % of cases. Half the studies reported occurrence of a bacterial co-infection or complication (10 studies). Amongst the latter, at least 17.6 % of patients who received antibiotics had secondary infections. Pooled data of 4 studies show that half of patients receiving antibiotics were not severe nor critical. Detailed data on antibiotic use lack in most articles. CONCLUSIONS: The present review found a major use of antibiotics amongst Covid-19 hospitalized patients, mainly in an empirical setting. There is no proven efficacy of this practice. Further research to determine relevant indications for antibiotic use in Covid-19 patients is critical in view of the significant mortality associated with secondary infections in these patients, and the rising antimicrobial resistance.","Chedid, Marie; Waked, Rami; Haddad, Elie; Chetata, Nabil; Saliba, Gebrael; Choucair, Jacques",J Infect Public Health,126,29

These claims comprised all Covid-19-tested cases and history of medical service use for the past 3 years in these patients. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality, and the secondary outcome was need for ventilator care. Among 7590 patients diagnosed with Covid-19, two distinct cohorts were generated based on NSAID or acetaminophen prescription within 2 weeks before Covid-19 diagnosis. A total of 398 patients was prescribed NSAIDs, and 2365 patients were prescribed acetaminophen. After propensity score matching, 397 pairs of data set were generated, and all-cause mortality of the NSAIDs group showed no significant difference compared with the acetaminophen group (4.0% vs. 3.0%; hazard ratio [HR], 1.33; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.63-2.88; P = 0.46).

Since these attacks target system measurement process, this paper focuses on the problem of improving the resiliency of dynamical observers against FDIA. Specifically, we propose an attack-resilient pruning algorithm which attempts to exclude compromised channels from being processed by the observer. The proposed pruning algorithm improves attack-localization precision to $100\%$ with high probability, which correspondingly improves the resiliency of the underlying UKF to FDIA. The improvements due to the developed resilient pruning-based observer is validated through a numerical simulation of a two-layer path-tracking control platform of differential-driven wheeled mobile robot (DDWMR) under FDIA.","Zheng, Yu; Anubi, Olugbenga Moses",,126,26

The currently used PCR as well as chest X-ray and CT scanning have important disadvantages. The aim of this study is to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of POCUS in patients with suspected pulmonary manifestations of COVID-19 in the ED. METHODS: This prospective diagnostic accuracy study was conducted at the ED of our non-academic level 1 trauma centre (Isala, Zwolle, the Netherlands). Patients were enrolled between 14 April and 22 April 2020. Patients (aged &#8805;16 years) with suspected COVID-19 presenting to the ED underwent POCUS. All patients received current standard of care, including PCR (naso-oropharyngeal swab). Outcome of POCUS was compared with PCR or CT scan outcome to determine diagnostic accuracy. Diagnostic accuracy measures were calculated using 2×2 contingency tables. RESULTS: 100 patients were eligible to participate in this study, data of 93 patients were analysed. 27 (29%) patients were found positive for COVID-19 by PCR or CT. POCUS had a sensitivity of 89% (95% CI 70% to 97%), specificity of 59% (95% CI 46% to 71%), negative predictive value of 93% (95% CI 79% to 98%) and positive predictive value of 47% (95% CI 33% to 61%). In a subgroup of patients without previous cardiopulmonary disease (n=37), POCUS had a sensitivity of 100% (95% CI 70% to 100%), specificity of 76% (95% CI 54% to 90%), negative predictive value of 100% (95% CI 79% to 100%) and positive predictive value of 67% (95% CI 41% to 86%).

Tele-Savvy is delivered over 43 days to groups of 6-8 caregivers in seven weekly synchronous sessions accompanied by 36 brief asynchronous video lessons. We enrolled 23 cohorts of 15 eligible caregivers (N=261), randomized 2:2:1 to active, attention control, and usual care arms. We assessed caregiver psychological well-being and caregiving mastery at baseline and 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. Multilevel linear models assessed outcomes over the three time points examined. The trial was slightly truncated, with DSMB approval, because of the apparent confounding psychological effects of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) restrictions. RESULTS: Study findings indicate statistically and clinically significant benefits to Tele-Savvy arm caregivers (with moderate to large effect sizes) in the areas of depression, perceived stress, reaction to care-recipients' behaviors and enhancement of caregiver mastery. Expected benefits for caregiver burden and anxiety were not found. DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Findings attest to program efficacy and the viability of employing distance means to improve family caregivers' emotional well-being and sense of mastery in the caregiving role over a 6-month period. Next steps entail finding alternate ways to deliver the program to those with connectivity and/or time constraint problems.","Hepburn, Kenneth; Nocera, Joe; Higgins, Melinda; Epps, Fayron; Brewster, Glenna S; Lindauer, Allison; Morhardt, Darby; Shah, Raj; Nash, Rachel; Griffiths, Patricia C",GerontologistGerontologist,126,20

No specific studies have been found that evaluate the impact of the coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2) pandemic on AA and its surgical management. An analysis was made on the influence of this new pathology on the clinical course of AA. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Retrospective observational study was conducted on patients operated on for AA from January to April 2020. They were classified according to the time of the appendectomy, before the declaration of the state of alarm (pre-COVID-19), and after its declaration (post-COVID-19) in Spain, one the most affected countries in the world. An evaluation was made of demographic variables, duration of symptoms, type of appendicitis, surgical time, hospital stay, and postoperative complications. RESULTS: The study included 66 patients (41 pre-COVID-19; 25 post-COVID-19) with mean age of 10.7 ± 3 and 9.3 ± 3.1; P = .073, respectively. Fever was found in a higher number of post-COVID-19 patients (52 vs. 19.5%; P = 0.013), as well as a higher CRP (72.7 ± 96.2 vs. 31.3 ± 36.2 mg/dL; P = 0.042). This group presented with a higher proportion of complicated appendicitis when compared to pre-COVID-19 (32 vs. 7.3%; P = 0.015). The mean hospital stay was longer in the post-COVID-19 group (5.6 ± 5.9 vs. 3.2 ± 4.3 days; P = 0.041). No differences were found in the time of onset of symptoms or surgical time. CONCLUSIONS: The SARS-Cov-2 pandemic influenced the time of diagnosis of appendicitis, as well as its course, and mean hospital stay. Peritonitis was more frequently seen. As a result of the significant circumstances, delaying diagnosis and treatment of AA during SARS-Cov-2 pandemic, inappropriate management of this common surgical disorder has been noticed.","Velayos, María; Muñoz-Serrano, Antonio Jesús; Estefanía-Fernández, Karla; Sarmiento Caldas, Ma Carmen; Moratilla Lapeña, Lucas; López-Santamaría, Manuel; López-Gutiérrez, Juan Carlos",An Pediatr (Barc),126,24

However, few studies in sub-Saharan Africa have examined its deleterious consequences on mental health. Therefore, we investigated the prevalence and changes in boredom, anxiety and psychological well-being before and during the COVID-19 pandemic in Ghana. METHODS: Data for this study were drawn from an online survey of 811 participants that collected retrospective information on mental health measures including symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder, boredom, and well-being. Additional data were collected on COVID-19 related measures, biosocial (e.g. age and sex) and sociocultural factors (e.g., education, occupation, marital status). Following descriptive and psychometric evaluation of measures used, multiple linear regression was used to assess the relationships between predictor variables and boredom, anxiety and psychological well-being scores during the pandemic. Second, we assessed the effect of anxiety on psychological well-being. Next, we assessed predictors of the changes in boredom, anxiety, and well-being. RESULTS: Before the COVID-19 pandemic, 63.5% reported better well-being, 11.6% symptoms of anxiety, and 29.6% symptoms of boredom. Comparing experiences before and during the pandemic, there was an increase in boredom and anxiety symptomatology, and a decrease in well-being mean scores. The adjusted model shows participants with existing medical conditions had higher scores on boredom (ß = 1.76, p < .001) and anxiety (ß = 1.83, p < .01). In a separate model, anxiety scores before the pandemic (ß = -0.25, p < .01) and having prior medical conditions (ß = -1.53, p < .001) were associated with decreased psychological well-being scores during the pandemic. In the change model, having a prior medical condition was associated with an increasing change in boredom, anxiety, and well-being. Older age was associated with decreasing changes in boredom and well-being scores. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first in Ghana to provide evidence of the changes in boredom, anxiety and psychological well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic. The findings underscore the need for the inclusion of mental health interventions as part of the current pandemic control protocol and public health preparedness towards infectious disease outbreaks.","Boateng, Godfred O; Doku, David Teye; Enyan, Nancy Innocentia Ebu; Owusu, Samuel Asiedu; Aboh, Irene Korkoi; Kodom, Ruby Victoria; Ekumah, Benard; Quansah, Reginald; Boamah, Sheila A; Obiri-Yeboah, Dorcas; Nsabimana, Epaphrodite; Jansen, Stefan; Armah, Frederick Ato",BMC Public Health,126,24

We examined the feasibility of a novel virtual Facebook community platform for public engagement on health research statewide in Minnesota.Methods:The Facebook platform, MN Research Link, was evaluated from June 19, 2019 to June 30, 2020. Facebook advertisements and boosts were used to recruit followers. Content, based on prior formative work, included health research information and interactive postings (e.g., live interviews with researchers). Standard metrics obtained from Facebook analytics included participation (followers), content reach (views), and engagement (likes, shares, comments, clicks).Results:During the 12-month period, we acquired 1406 followers (31% rural residents), with a retention of followers of 99.7%. Mean number of views per month was 9379.83 (Mdn = 2791, range 724–41,510). Engagement metrics indicated a mean of 535.2 likes, shares, comments, and/or clicks per month (Mdn = 296.5, range 55–1535). The page continued to acquire new followers, but a slight decrease in engagement was observed in the final months after state COVID-19 mitigation strategies were implemented.Conclusion:As the complexity of CTS continues to grow, along with social distancing measures resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, the availability of virtual digital platforms to reach and engage community stakeholders in conversations about health and research has increasing importance. Preliminary findings from this program evaluation indicate that a Facebook community platform is feasible to engage Minnesota residents in conversations around health and research topics. Future work will evaluate its potential for reach, scale, and sustainability.","Patten, Christi A.; Joyce, E.

Last years wildfires resulted in the worst air quality on record in the Western US due to toxic wildfire smoke (PM 2.5 pollution) traveling from distant wildfires and this year can potentially be even worse due to extremely dry conditions. Aerosol precautions such as high-filtration (Hi-Fi) masks and HEPA air purifiers are useful to effectively reduce inhalation of most of these toxic aerosols. Whereas the lack of fit or filtration in a mask or use of an air purifier of insufficient size (capacity) for the room can inadvertently render these precautions ineffective. Here we investigate the publics concerns about wildfires and the COVID-19 variants (e.g. delta), their use of aerosol precautions, and whether these are being done in an effective manner. MethodsWe conducted a national survey of 2,250 US residents in order to understand public concerns about airborne threats and their usage of airborne (aerosol) precautions. ResultsWe find over 66% of US residents surveyed are worried about inhaling COVID-19 and its variants, and 52% are worried about toxic wildfire particles in the air. In the mountain and pacific regions the latter rises to 73%. Only a quarter are using masks with higher filtration and high level of fit (or Hi-Fi masks e.g. N95 or similar such as elastomeric N95 or KF94). Two-thirds are still using loose-fitting cloth or surgical masks. Just over 40% of respondents report using air purifiers at home, and of this group only 40% use it in their bedroom where they sleep. Of those using air purifiers, the majority said they chose the size of their air purifier based on ""most popular"" models, ""recommendations,"" or ""reviews."" However, of those using air purifiers only 42% reported doing a calculation (or using a calculator) to estimate the right size of air purifier needed for the room they are using it in. Notably, a much higher percentage of people (than average) reported use of Hi-Fi masks and home air purifiers in certain occupations such as doctors, healthcare, first responders, public safety, engineering, military, and construction. ConclusionNational survey data suggests most US residents are worried about wildfire smoke and Covid variants (e.g. delta variant) but a majority are not prepared for it. Preparation with aerosol precautions will also be useful for future pandemics and national biodefense.","Srikrishna, Devabhaktuni",,126,16

Information regarding the impact of cardiovascular complication on fatal outcome is scarce. Objective: To evaluate the association of underlying cardiovascular disease (CVD) and myocardial injury with fatal outcomes in patients with COVID-19. Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective single-center case series analyzed patients with COVID-19 at the Seventh Hospital of Wuhan City, China, from January 23, 2020, to February 23, 2020. Analysis began February 25, 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures: Demographic data, laboratory findings, comorbidities, and treatments were collected and analyzed in patients with and without elevation of troponin T (TnT) levels. Results: Among 187 patients with confirmed COVID-19, 144 patients (77%) were discharged and 43 patients (23%) died. The mean (SD) age was 58.50 (14.66) years. Overall, 66 (35.3%) had underlying CVD including hypertension, coronary heart disease, and cardiomyopathy, and 52 (27.8%) exhibited myocardial injury as indicated by elevated TnT levels. The mortality during hospitalization was 7.62% (8 of 105) for patients without underlying CVD and normal TnT levels, 13.33% (4 of 30) for those with underlying CVD and normal TnT levels, 37.50% (6 of 16) for those without underlying CVD but elevated TnT levels, and 69.44% (25 of 36) for those with underlying CVD and elevated TnTs. Patients with underlying CVD were more likely to exhibit elevation of TnT levels compared with the patients without CVD (36 [54.5%] vs 16 [13.2%]). Plasma TnT levels demonstrated a high and significantly positive linear correlation with plasma high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels (ß = 0.530, P < .001) and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels (ß = 0.613, P < .001). Plasma TnT and NT-proBNP levels during hospitalization (median [interquartile range (IQR)], 0.307 [0.094-0.600]; 1902.00 [728.35-8100.00]) and impending death (median [IQR], 0.141 [0.058-0.860]; 5375 [1179.50-25695.25]) increased significantly compared with admission values (median [IQR], 0.0355 [0.015-0.102]; 796.90 [401.93-1742.25]) in patients who died (P = .001; P < .001), while no significant dynamic changes of TnT (median [IQR], 0.010 [0.007-0.019]; 0.013 [0.007-0.022]; 0.011 [0.007-0.016]) and NT-proBNP (median [IQR], 352.20 [174.70-636.70]; 433.80 [155.80-1272.60]; 145.40 [63.4-526.50]) was observed in survivors (P = .96; P = .16). During hospitalization, patients with elevated TnT levels had more frequent malignant arrhythmias, and the use of glucocorticoid therapy (37 [71.2%] vs 69 [51.1%]) and mechanical ventilation (31 [59.6%] vs 14 [10.4%]) were higher compared with patients with normal TnT levels. The mortality rates of patients with and without use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers was 36.8% (7 of 19) and 21.4% (36 of 168) (P = .13). Conclusions and Relevance: Myocardial injury is significantly associated with fatal outcome of COVID-19, while the prognosis of patients with underlying CVD but without myocardial injury is relatively favorable. Myocardial injury is associated with cardiac dysfunction and arrhythmias. Inflammation may be a potential mechanism for myocardial injury. Aggressive treatment may be considered for patients at high risk of myocardial injury.","Guo, Tao; Fan, Yongzhen; Chen, Ming; Wu, Xiaoyan; Zhang, Lin; He, Tao; Wang, Hairong; Wan, Jing; Wang, Xinghuan; Lu, Zhibing",JAMA Cardiol,126,33

Study focuses to explore the clinical relevancy of Coagulation assays; prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), thrombin time (TT), fibrinogen (FIB), D-dimer and international normalised ratio (INR) and their response to palliative chemotherapy in advanced stage NSCLC. METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted between 2013 and 2019 in Jiangsu Cancer hospital, Nanjing, PR. China. Medical records of 5445 patients were succinctly reviewed and classified accordingly to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. A total of 216 advanced NSCLC patients who used a first line chemotherapy and antiangiogenic therapy regimen were enrolled in this study under ethical approval (JSCH-2020C-009). Blood samples were collected from these patients to measure the response levels of these coagulation parameters at time of admission to hospital and at the beginning of 4 cycles of Palliative therapy. We find the clinical value of all these coagulation parameters by using SPSS 24. Univariate Cox regression and Multivariate Cox regression models were used to identify the factors that were associated with progression free survival (PFS) and the response to palliative chemotherapy. RESULTS: In the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis for overall median (95%CI) survival of high pre-treatment coagulation parameters showed shorter PFS compared to normal pre-treatment except TT and their overall median (95%CI) follow up was 3.3(3.12-3.47). Coagulation parameters have showed clinical relevance as a potential independent prognostic factor of PFS in the Univariate Cox regression. In multivariable model, Age (&#8805; 60 years vs. <60 years), cancer differentiation (Unknown vs. Poor), PT (High vs. Normal) range, FIB (High vs. Normal) range, and D-dimer (High vs. Normal) range, (p = 0.025, p = 0.045, p = 0.029, p = 0.049, and p = 0.011 respectively) were associated as a prognostic factor of PFS in NSCLC. Patients on 3-drugs regimen found to have better PFS compared to the ones taking the 2-drugs treatment regimen (p= 0.043). CONCLUSION: The high range of PT, FIB, and D-dimers was associated with poor prognosis of advanced-stage NSCLC. Our findings also confirmed that patients on 3-drugs regimen showed longer PFS compared to 2-drugs regimen.","Abbas, Muhammad; Kassim, Said Abasse; Wang, Zhong-Chang; Shi, Meiqi; Hu, Yiqiao; Zhu, Hai-Liang",Int J Clin Pract,126,1

Methods: Seven data bases were searched. Research criteria included cohort and case-control studies, carried out worldwide and published before September 9, 2020, that compared the serum antibody levels of hospitalized COVID-19 cases that RP after discharge to those that did NRP. Results: There is some evidence that immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibody levels in RP cases were lower compared with NRP cases. The hypothesis of incomplete clearance aligns with these findings. The possibility of false negative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR test results during viral clearance is also plausible, as concentration of the viral ribonucleic acid (RNA) in nasopharyngeal and fecal swabs fluctuate below the limits of RT-PCR detection during virus clearance. The probability of reinfection was less likely to be the cause of retesting positive because of the low risk of exposure where cases observed a 14 day-quarantine after discharge. Conclusion: More studies are needed to better explain the immune response of recovered COVID-19 cases retesting positive after discharge.","Atchessi, N.; Striha, M.; Edjoc, R.; Abalos, C.; Lien, A.; Waddell, L.; Gabrani-Juma, I.; Thompson, E.; Dawson, T.",Canada Communicable Disease Report,126,6

Many of the world's most marginalised women work, however, in more informal or insecure jobs, beyond the scope of such employment protections. This narrative review focuses upon the health impact of such casual work upon menopausal women, and specifically upon the menopausal symptoms they experience. Casual work, even in less-then-ideal conditions, is not inherently detrimental to the wellbeing of menopausal women; for many, work helps manage the social and emotional challenges of the menopause transition. Whereas women in higher status work tend to regard vasomotor symptoms as their main physical symptom, women in casual work report musculoskeletal pain as more problematic. Menopausal women in casual work describe high levels of anxiety, though tend to attribute this not to their work as much as their broader life stresses of lifelong poverty and ill-health, increasing caring responsibilities, and the intersectionally gendered ageism of the social gaze. Health and wellbeing at menopause is determined less by current working conditions than by the early life experiences (adverse childhood experiences, poor educational opportunities) predisposing women to poverty and casual work in adulthood. Approaches to supporting menopausal women in casual work must therefore also address the lifelong structural and systemic inequalities such women will have faced. In the era of COVID-19, with its devastating economic, social and health effects upon women and vulnerable groups, menopausal women in casual work are likely to face increased marginalisation and stress.

(USRAP), leveraging data from a national survey of resettlement stakeholders conducted in 2020 2 The survey examined USRAP from the time that refugees arrive in the United States Its design and questionnaire were informed by three community gatherings organized by Refugee Council USA in the fall and winter of 2019, extensive input from an expert advisory group, and a literature review This study finds that USRAP serves important purposes, enjoys extensive community support, and offers a variety of effective services Overall, the survey finds a high degree of consensus on the US resettlement program’s strengths and objectives, and close alignment between its services and the needs of refugees at different stages of their settlement and integration Because its infrastructure and community-based resettlement networks have been decimated in recent years, the main challenges of subsequent administrations, Congresses, and USRAP stakeholders will be to rebuild, revitalize, and regain broad and bipartisan support for the program This article also recommends specific ways that USRAP’s programs and services can be strengthened Among the study’s findings: 3 Most refugee respondents identified USRAP’s main purpose(s) as giving refugees new opportunities, helping them to integrate, offering hope to refugees living in difficult circumstances abroad, and saving lives High percentages of refugees reported that the program allowed them to support themselves soon after arrival (92 percent), helped them to integrate (77 percent), and has a positive economic impact on local communities (71 percent) Refugee respondents also reported that the program encourages them to work in jobs that do not match their skills and credentials (56 percent), does not provide enough integration support after three months (54 percent), does not offer sufficient financial help during their first three months (49 percent), and reunites families too slowly (47 percent) Respondents identified the following main false ideas about the program: refugees pose a security risk (84 percent), use too many benefits and drain public finances (83 percent), and take the jobs of the native-born (74 percent) Refugee respondents reported using public benefits to meet basic needs, such as medical care, food, and housing Non-refugee survey respondents believed at high rates that former refugees (69 percent) and refugee community advocate groups (64 percent) should be afforded a voice in the resettlement process Non-refugee respondents indicated at high rates that the program’s employment requirements limit the time needed for refugees to learn English (65 percent) and limit their ability to pursue higher education (59 percent) Eighty-six percent of non-refugee respondents indicated that the Reception and Placement program is much too short (56 percent) or a little too short (30 percent) Respondents identified a wide range of persons and institutions as being very helpful to refugees in settling into their new communities: these included resettlement staff, friends, and acquaintances from refugees’ country of origin, members of places of worship, community organizations led by refugees or former refugees, and family members Refugee respondents identified finding medical care (61 percent), housing (52 percent), and a job (49 percent) as the most helpful services in their first three months in the country Refugees reported that the biggest challenge in their first year was to find employment that matched their educational or skill levels or backgrounds The needs of refugees and the main obstacles to their successful integration differ by gender, reflecting at least in part the greater childcare responsibilities borne by refugee women Refugee men reported needing assistance during their first three mo ths in finding employment (68 percent), English Language Learning (ELL) courses (59 percent), and orientation services (56 percent), while refugee women reported needing orientation services (81 percent) and assistance in securing childcare (64 percent), finding ELL courses (53 percent), and enrolling children in school (49 percent) To open-response questions, non-refugee respondents identified as obstacles to the integration of men: digital literacy, (lack of) anti–domestic violence training, the need for more training to improve their jobs, the new public benefit rule, transportation to work, low wages, the need for more mental health services, cultural role adjustment, and lack of motivation Non-refugee respondents identified as obstacles to the integration of women: lack of childcare and affordable housing, the different cultural roles of women in the United States, lack of affordable driver’s education classes, a shortage of ELL classes for those with low literacy or the illiterate, digital literacy challenges, difficulty navigating their children’s education and school systems, transportation problems, poorly paying jobs, and lack of friendships with US residents Non-refugee respondents report that refugee children also face unique obstacles to integration, including limited funding or capacity to engage refugee parents in their children’s education, difficulties communicating with refugee families, and the unfamiliarity of teachers and school staff with the cultures and backgrounds of refugee children and families LGBTQ refugees have many of the same basic needs as other refugees — education, housing, employment, transportation, psychosocial, and others — but face unique challenges in meeting these needs due to possible rejection by refugees and immigrants from their own countries and by other residents of their new communities Since 2017, the number of resettlement agencies has fallen sharply, and large numbers of staff at the remaining agencies have been laid off As a result, the program has suffered a loss in expertise, institutional knowledge, language diversity, and resettlement capacity Resettlement agencies and community-based organizations (CBOs) reported at high rates that to accommodate pre-2017 numbers of refugees, they would need higher staffing levels in employment services (66 percent), general integration and adjustment services (62 percent), mental health care (44 percent) and medical case management (44 percent) Resettlement agencies indicated that they face immense operational and financial challenges, some of them longstanding (like per capita funding and secondary migration), and some related to the Trump administration’s hostility to the program Section I introduces the article and provides historic context on the US refugee program Section II outlines the resettlement process and its constituent

Together with Src and other signaling proteins, the Na/K-ATPase forms an oxidant amplification loop (NKAL), amplifies ROS, and participates in cytokines storm in obesity. The development of a peptide fragment of the &#945;1 subunit, NaKtide, has been shown to negatively regulate Src. Several groups showed that the systemic administration of the cell permeable modification of NaKtide (pNaKtide) or its selective delivery to fat tissue-adipocyte specific expression of NaKtide-ameliorate the systemic elevation of inflammatory cytokines seen in chronic obesity. Severe acute respiratory syndrome - coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the RNA Coronavirus responsible for the COVID-19 global pandemic, invades cells via the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptor (ACE2R) that is appended in inflamed fat tissue and exacerbates the formation of the cytokines storm. Both obesity and heart and renal failure are well known risks for adverse outcomes in patients infected with COVID-19. White adipocytes express ACE-2 receptors in high concentration, especially in obese patients. Once the virus invades the white adipocyte cell, it creates a COVID19-porphyrin complex which degrades and produces free porphyrin and iron and increases ROS. The increased formation of ROS and activation of the NKAL results in a further potentiated formation of ROS production, and ultimately, adipocyte generation of more inflammatory mediators, leading to systemic cytokines storm and heart failure. Moreover, chronic obesity also results in the reduction of antioxidant genes such as heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), increasing adipocyte susceptibility to ROS and cytokines. It is the systemic inflammation and cytokine storm which is responsible for many of the adverse outcomes seen with COVID-19 infections in obese subjects, leading to heart failure and death. This review will also describe the potential antioxidant drugs and role of NaKtide and their demonstrated antioxidant effect used as a major strategy for improving obesity and epicardial fat mediated heart failure in the context of the COVID pandemic.","Xie, Zi-Jian; Novograd, Joel; Itzkowitz, Yaakov; Sher, Ariel; Buchen, Yosef D; Sodhi, Komal; Abraham, Nader G; Shapiro, Joseph I",,126,16

Methods: We performed a systematic review of studies that explored pre-existing CVD and its traditional risk factors as risk factors of severe COVID-19 (defined as death, acute respiratory distress syndrome, mechanical ventilation, or intensive care unit admission). We searched PubMed and Embase for papers in English with original data (&#8805;10 cases of severe COVID-19). Using random-effects models, we pooled relative risk (RR) estimates and conducted meta-regression analyses. Results: Of the 661 publications identified in our search, 25 papers met our inclusion criteria, with 76,638 COVID-19 patients including 11,766 severe cases. Older age was consistently associated with severe COVID-19 in all eight eligible studies, with RR >~5 in >60-65 versus <50 years. Three studies showed no change in the RR of age after adjusting for covariate(s). In univariate analyses, factors robustly associated with severe COVID-19 were male sex (10 studies; pooled RR = 1.73, [95% CI 1.50-2.01]), hypertension (8 studies; 2.87 [2.09-3.93]), diabetes (9 studies; 3.20 [2.26-4.53]), and CVD (10 studies; 4.97 [3.76-6.58]). RR for male sex was likely to be independent of age. For the other three factors, meta-regression analyses suggested confounding by age. Only four studies reported multivariable analysis, but most of them showed adjusted RR ~2 for hypertension, diabetes, and CVD. No study explored renin-angiotensin system inhibitors as a risk factor for severe COVID-19. Conclusions: Despite the potential for confounding, these results suggest that hypertension, diabetes, and CVD are independently associated with severe COVID-19 and, together with age and male sex, can be informative for predicting the risk of severe COVID-19.","Matsushita, Kunihiro; Ding, Ning; Kou, Minghao; Hu, Xiao; Chen, Mengkun; Gao, Yumin; Honda, Yasuyuki; Zhao, Di; Dowdy, David; Mok, Yejin; Ishigami, Junichi; Appel, Lawrence J",Glob Heart,126,26

In order to understand VOC driven breakthrough infection we investigated 14 individuals who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 after being administered a single or double dose of Covishield (ChAdOx1, Serum Institute of India) from the city of Varanasi, which is located in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh. Genomic analysis revealed that 78.6% (11/14) of the patients were infected with the B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant. Notably, the frequency (37%) of this variant in the region was significantly lower (p<0.01), suggesting that the vaccinated people were asymmetrically infected with the Delta variant. Most of the patients tested displayed mild symptoms, indicating that even a single dose of the vaccine can help in reducing the severity of the disease.

Enrolled CLHIV received standard of care WHO-recommended first-line ART. At the final study visit, a dried blood spot sample was obtained for viral load and genotypic resistance testing. RESULTS: Among 72 successfully genotyped CLHIV, 49 (68.1%) received ABC/3TC/LPV/r, and 23 (31.9%) received ABC/3TC/EFV. All but 2 children on ABC/3TC/LPV/r were <3 years and all CLHIV on ABC/3TC/EFV were &#8805;3 years. Overall, 80.6% (58/72) had at least one drug resistance mutation (DRM). DRMs to NNRTIs and NRTIs were found among 65% and 51% of all CLHIV, respectively, with no statistical difference by ART regimen. More CLHIV on ABC/3TC/EFV, 47.8% (11/23), were found to have 0 or only 1 effective antiretroviral drug remaining in their current regimen compared to 8.2% (4/49) on ABC/3TC/LPV/r. CONCLUSIONS: High levels of NNRTI and NRTI DRMs among CLHIV receiving ABC/3TC/LPV/r suggests a lasting impact of failed PMTCT interventions on DRMs. However, drug susceptibility analysis, reveals that CLHIV with detectable viremia on ABC/3TC/LPV/r are more likely to have maintained at least two effective agents on their current HIV regimen than those on ABC/3TC/EFV.","Hackett, Stephanie; Teasdale, Chloe A; Pals, Sherri; Muttiti, Anthony; Mogashoa, Mary; Chang, Joy; Zeh, Clement; Ramos, Artur; Rivadeneira, Emilia D; DeVos, Joshua; Sleeman, Katrina; Abrams, Elaine J",Clin. infect. dis,126,24

SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in development, and those being distributed currently, have been designed to induce neutralizing antibodies using the spike protein of the virus as an immunogen. However, the immunological correlates of protection against the virus remain unknown. This raises questions about the efficacy of current vaccination strategies. In addition, safety profiles of several vaccines seem inadequate or have not yet been evaluated under controlled experimentation. Here, evidence from the literature regarding the efforts already made to identify the immunological correlates of protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection are summarized. Furthermore, key biological features of most of the advanced vaccines and considerations regarding their safety and expected efficacy are highlighted.","Federico, Maurizio",Cytokine Growth Factor Rev,126,20

Dense models provide a rich representation of the environment facilitating higher-level scene understanding, perception, and planning. Our system employs dense depth prediction with a hybrid mapping architecture combining state-of-the-art sparse features and dense fusion-based visual SLAM algorithms within an integrated framework. Our novel contributions include design of hybrid sparse-dense camera tracking and loop closure, and scale estimation improvements in dense depth prediction. We use the motion estimates from the sparse method to overcome the large and variable inter-frame displacement typical of outdoor vehicle scenarios. Our system then registers the live image with the dense model using whole-image alignment. This enables the fusion of the live frame and dense depth prediction into the model. Global consistency and alignment between the sparse and dense models are achieved by applying pose constraints from the sparse method directly within the deformation of the dense model. We provide qualitative and quantitative results for both trajectory estimation and surface reconstruction accuracy, demonstrating competitive performance on the KITTI dataset. Qualitative results of the proposed approach are illustrated in https://youtu.be/Pn2uaVqjskY.

To date, a systematic method to improve the perceived quality of health services by healthcare users in Peru has not been established. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the quality of health services in two PPP hospitals in Peru using the Kano model. A prospective cross-sectional descriptive observational study was carried out through a health service satisfaction survey using the Kano model methodology, measuring six categories of attributes. A total of 250 users of the health services were surveyed in the two PPP hospitals, located in Lima and Callao, using non-probability convenience sampling. Of the 31 attributes evaluated by the patients, 27 (81%) were classified as having a one-dimensional-type attribute, 3 (10%) were reported as mandatory, and 1 (3%) was considered as inverse. These results suggest that the presence of most of the attributes evaluated was relevant to maintaining the level of user satisfaction and that the absence of these attributes generated dissatisfaction in the users. The results showed that the users' evaluation of health services was multidimensional-namely, their evaluation was focused not only on the interaction space between the patient and medical personnel but also addressed other interaction services.","Barrios-Ipenza, Fernando; Calvo-Mora, Arturo; Criado-García, Fernando; Curioso, Walter H",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),126,24

Tourism businesses are compelled to adapt to shifts in consumer demand as well as government regulatory changes. The objective in this paper is to investigate the responses and adaptations to the impacts of COVID-19 of tourism businesses in South Africa’s most tourism-dependent locality. The research reports on 20 qualitative interviews undertaken with a cross-section of tourism enterprises in Bela-Bela Local Municipality, Limpopo province, which is overwhelmingly oriented towards the market of domestic tourism. Major results are local businesses are financially negatively impacted by the subdued nature of domestic leisure travel together with the near total collapse of business travel as well as the imperative to conform to new COVID-19 safety and health protocols. Adaptive responses have included downsizing of businesses, including worker retrenchments, pricecutting, limited initiatives towards product diversification, energetic social media marketing and repurposing of properties. Key challenges for Bela-Bela tourism enterprises relate to immediate financial issues and most especially in the context that minimal support has been provided by national government to assist their business survival. Future business prospects are not viewed favourably such that business closures and a hollowing out of the tourism enterprise base accompanying job losses in tourism appear inevitable. © 2020 AJHTL /Author(s)","Rogerson, J.

If these strategies are not adapted for minority patients of lower socioeconomic status, health inequality will further increase. Patient-centered models of care can successfully improve access and experience for minority patients. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to present the development process and preliminary acceptability of altering in-person onboarding procedures into internet-based, remote procedures for a mobile health (mHealth) intervention in a population with limited digital literacy. METHODS: We actively recruited safety-net patients (English- and Spanish-speaking adults with diabetes and depression who were receiving care at a public health care delivery system in San Francisco, United States) into a randomized controlled trial of text messaging support for physical activity. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, we modified the in-person recruitment and onboarding procedures to internet-based, remote processes with human support. We conducted a preliminary evaluation of how the composition of the recruited cohort might have changed from the pre-COVID-19 period to the COVID-19 enrollment period. First, we analyzed the digital profiles of patients (n=32) who had participated in previous in-person onboarding sessions prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. Next, we documented all changes made to our onboarding processes to account for remote recruitment, especially those needed to support patients who were not very familiar with downloading apps onto their mobile phones on their own. Finally, we used the new study procedures to recruit patients (n=11) during the COVID-19 social distancing period. These patients were also asked about their experience enrolling into a fully digitized mHealth intervention. RESULTS: Recruitment across both pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 periods (N=43) demonstrated relatively high rates of smartphone ownership but lower self-reported digital literacy, with 32.6% (14/43) of all patients reporting they needed help with using their smartphone and installing apps. Significant changes were made to the onboarding procedures, including facilitating app download via Zoom video call and/or a standard phone call and implementing brief, one-on-one staff-patient interactions to provide technical assistance personalized to each patient's digital literacy skills. Comparing recruitment during pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 periods, the proportion of patients with digital literacy barriers reduced from 34.4% (11/32) in the pre-COVID-19 cohort to 27.3% (3/11) in the COVID-19 cohort. Differences in digital literacy scores between both cohorts were not significant (P=.49). CONCLUSIONS: Patients of lower socioeconomic status have high interest in using digital platforms to manage their health, but they may require additional upfront human support to gain access. One-on-one staff-patient partnerships allowed us to provide unique technical assistance personalized to each patient's digital literacy skills, with simple strategies to troubleshoot patient barriers upfront. These additional remote onboarding strategies can mitigate but not eliminate digital barriers for patients without extensive technology experience.

If we focus on data from China, the first country hit by COVID-19 it is clearly observed that physical activity decreased from 10,000 average steps per day to ~6,000 daily steps throughout the country since the quarantine was declared. Although the decrease in levels of physical activity and increase in sitting behavior (time spent sitting) is an inevitable reaction of social isolation and the current confinement conditions, its consequences in the short and medium term could be more severe than expected. This is corroborated by a study carried out in men who underwent an intervention where they reduced the number of daily steps from 10,501 to 1,344 for 2 weeks 5. A similar trend was observed in another study where physically inactive men reduced their number of steps from 6,203 to 1,394 steps per day for 3 weeks. These studies provide evidence that short periods of induced physical inactivity and increased sitting behavior, which to some extent induce the current conditions of confinement or social isolation during this COVID-19 pandemic, could have important metabolic implications on the health of the population.","Celis-Morales, C.; Salas-Bravo, C.; Yanez, A.; Castillo, M.",Revista Medica de Chile,126,20

Methods: We studied 144 consecutive COVID-19 patients admitted to a single center in intensive or subintensive care units. Those with previous thyroid dysfunctions or taking interfering drugs were excluded. Differently from previous reports, TSH, FT3, FT4, thyroglobulin (Tg), anti-Tg autoantibodies (TgAb) were measured at baseline and every 3-7 days. C-reacting protein (CRP), cortisol and IL-6 were also assayed. Results: The majority of patients had a normal TSH at admission, usually with normal FT4 and FT3. Low TSH levels were found either at admission or during hospitalization in 39% of patients, associated with low FT3 in half of the cases. FT4 and Tg levels were normal, and TgAb-negative. TSH and FT3 were invariably restored at the time of discharge in survivors, whereas were permanently low in most deceased cases, but only FT3 levels were predictors of mortality. Cortisol, CRP and IL-6 levels were higher in patients with low TSH and FT3 levels. Conclusions: Almost half of our COVID-19 patients without interfering drugs had normal TFTs both at admission and during follow-up. In this series, the transient finding of low TSH with normal FT4 and low FT3 levels, inversely correlated with CRP, cortisol and IL-6 and associated with normal Tg levels, is likely due to the cytokine storm induced by SARS-Cov-2 with a direct or mediated impact on TSH secretion and deiodinase activity, and likely not to a destructive thyroiditis.","Campi, Irene; Bulgarelli, Ilaria; Dubini, Antonella; Perego, Giovanni Battista; Tortorici, Elena; Torlasco, Camilla; Torresani, Erminio; Rocco, Lorenzo; Persani, Luca; Fugazzola, Laura",Eur J Endocrinol,126,16

Knowledge of the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 is needed to accurately monitor the spread of the epidemic and to calculate the infection fatality rate (IFR). These measures may help the authorities to make informed decisions and adjust the current societal interventions. The objective was to perform nationwide real-time seroprevalence surveying among blood donors as a tool to estimate previous SARS-CoV-2 infections and the population based IFR. METHODS: Danish blood donors aged 17-69 years giving blood April 6 to May 3 were tested for SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin M and G antibodies using a commercial lateral flow test. Antibody status was compared between geographical areas and an estimate of the IFR was calculated. The seroprevalence was adjusted for assay sensitivity and specificity taking the uncertainties of the test validation into account when reporting the 95% confidence intervals (CI). RESULTS: The first 20,640 blood donors were tested and a combined adjusted seroprevalence of 1.9% (CI: 0.8-2.3) was calculated. The seroprevalence differed across areas. Using available data on fatalities and population numbers a combined IFR in patients younger than 70 is estimated at 89 per 100,000 (CI: 72-211) infections. CONCLUSIONS: The IFR was estimated to be slightly lower than previously reported from other countries not using seroprevalence data. The IFR is likely several fold lower than the current estimate. We have initiated real-time nationwide anti-SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence surveying of blood donations as a tool in monitoring the epidemic.","Erikstrup, Christian; Hother, Christoffer Egeberg; Pedersen, Ole Birger Vestager; Mølbak, Kåre; Skov, Robert Leo; Holm, Dorte Kinggaard; Sækmose, Susanne Gjørup; Nilsson, Anna Christine; Brooks, Patrick Terrence; Boldsen, Jens Kjærgaard; Mikkelsen, Christina; Gybel-Brask, Mikkel; Sørensen, Erik; Dinh, Khoa Manh; Mikkelsen, Susan; Møller, Bjarne Kuno; Haunstrup, Thure; Harritshøj, Lene; Jensen, Bitten Aagaard; Hjalgrim, Henrik; Lillevang, Søren Thue; Ullum, Henrik",Clin. infect. dis,126,12

We aim to study if vaccination alters virological and serological kinetics in breakthrough infections. MethodsWe conducted a multi-centre retrospective cohort study of patients in Singapore who had received a licensed mRNA vaccine and been admitted to hospital with B.1.617.2 SARS-CoV-2 infection. We compared the clinical features, virological and serological kinetics (anti-nucleocapsid, anti-spike and surrogate virus neutralization titres) between fully vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals. ResultsOf 218 individuals with B.1.617.2 infection, 84 had received a mRNA vaccine of which 71 were fully vaccinated, 130 were unvaccinated and 4 received a non-mRNA. Despite significantly older age in the vaccine breakthrough group, the odds of severe COVID-19 requiring oxygen supplementation was significantly lower following vaccination (adjusted odds ratio 0.07 95%CI: 0.015-0.335, p=0.001). PCR cycle threshold (Ct) values were similar between both vaccinated and unvaccinated groups at diagnosis, but viral loads decreased faster in vaccinated individuals. Early, robust boosting of anti-spike protein antibodies was observed in vaccinated patients, however, these titers were significantly lower against B.1.617.2 as compared with the wildtype vaccine strain. ConclusionThe mRNA vaccines are highly effective at preventing symptomatic and severe COVID-19 associated with B.1.617.2 infection.

Depression and anxiety are the result of implicit beliefs (not cognitions) that all experience is unrewarding and threatening, these being components of the implicit belief that life is bad. Implicit beliefs are formed automatically from contextual cues and in healthy individuals are consistent with rational appraisal. They become more negative than reality through a process of adaptation when behaviors, directed by rational thinking, repeatedly create cues that signify lack of reward or threat. Such behaviors occur when social or other obligations lead people to choose behaviors that fail to satisfy their own unique goals in life and approach threatening situations, contrary to their automatic reactions. Therapeutic interventions and lifestyle change reverse these adaptive processes by positive experiences that create positive implicit beliefs, a change effected in different ways by contextual and specific mechanisms both of which correct the same fault of negative implicit beliefs. Effective therapeutic relationships and interventions are achieved by detecting and responding to a patient's unique needs and goals and their associated implicit beliefs. Mental health requires not only that people experience life as good as defined by their own goals and beliefs but also the avoidance of contexts where social and other pressures induce people to behave in ways inconsistent with their automatically generated feelings.","Hyland, Michael E",Clin Psychol Rev,126,16

METHODS: Cytokine and chemokine levels and characterisation of immune cell subsets from 20 COVID-19 cases after hospital admission (17 critically ill and 3 severe patients) and 16 convalescent patients were determined using a multiplex immunoassay and flow cytometry, respectively. RESULTS: IP-10, MCP-1, MIG, IL-6, and IL-10 levels were significantly higher in acute severe/critically ill patients with COVID-19, whereas were normal in patients who had reached convalescence. CD8 T cells in severe and critically ill COVID-19 patients expressed high levels of cytotoxic granules (granzyme B and perforin)and was hyperactivated as evidenced by the high proportions of CD38. Furthermore, the cytotoxic potential of natural killer (NK) cells, and the frequencies of myeloid dendritic cells and plasmacytoid dendritic cells was reduced in patients with severe and critical COVID-19; however, these dysregulations were found to be restored in convalescent phases. CONCLUSION: Thus, elicitation of the hyperactive cytokine-mediated inflammatory response, dysregulation of CD8 T and NK cells, and deficiency of host myeloid and plasmacytoid DCs, may contribute to COVID-19 pathogenesis and provide insights into potential therapeutic targets and strategies.","Chen, Qigao; Yu, Baodan; Yang, Yihao; Huang, Jiewen; Liang, Ying; Zhou, Jing; Li, Lianzhong; Peng, Xuechun; Cheng, Bolin; Lin, Yongping",Int Immunopharmacol,126,28
388319,388319,388319,Timing of intervention in asymptomatic patients with valvular heart disease,16.905792,8.662712,2020,"We suggest a novel mathematical framework for the in-homogeneous spatial spreading of an infectious disease in human population, with particular attention to COVID-19. Common epidemiological models, e.g., the well-known susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) model, implicitly assume uniform (random) encounters between the infectious and susceptible sub-populations, resulting in homogeneous spatial distributions. However, in human population, especially under different levels of mobility restrictions, this assumption is likely to fail. Splitting the geographic region under study into areal nodes, and assuming infection kinetics within nodes and between nearest-neighbor nodes, we arrive into a continuous, ""reaction-diffusion"", spatial model. To account for COVID-19, the model includes five different sub-populations, in which the infectious sub-population is split into pre-symptomatic and symptomatic. Our model accounts for the spreading evolution of infectious population domains from initial epicenters, leading to different regimes of sub-exponential (e.g., power-law) growth. Importantly, we also account for the variable geographic density of the population, that can strongly enhance or suppress infection spreading. For instance, we show how weakly infected regions surrounding a densely populated area can cause rapid migration of the infection towards the populated area. Predicted infection ""heat-maps"" show remarkable similarity to publicly available heat-maps, e.g., from South Carolina. We further demonstrate how localized lockdown/quarantine conditions can slow down the spreading of disease from epicenters. Application of our model in different countries can provide a useful predictive tool for the authorities, in particular, for planning strong lockdown measures in localized areas-such as those underway in a few countries.","Tsori, Yoav; Granek, Rony",PLoS One,126,30

Recently proposed methods based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have demonstrated their potential in image processing tasks, including some medical image analysis tasks. Those methods can learn various feature representations with numerous weight-shared convolutional kernels, however, the missed diagnosis rate of regions of interest (ROIs) is still high in medical image segmentation. Two crucial factors behind this shortcoming, which have been overlooked, are small ROIs from medical images and the limited context information from the existing network models. In order to reduce the missed diagnosis rate of ROIs from medical images, we propose a new segmentation framework which enhances the representative capability of small ROIs (particularly in deep layers) and explicitly learns global contextual dependencies in multi-scale feature spaces. In particular, the local features and their global dependencies from each feature space are adaptively aggregated based on both the spatial and the channel dimensions. Moreover, some visualization comparisons of the learned features from our framework further boost neural networks' interpretability. Experimental results show that, in comparison to some popular medical image segmentation and general image segmentation methods, our proposed framework achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the liver tumor segmentation task with 91.18% Sensitivity, the COVID-19 lung infection segmentation task with 75.73% Sensitivity and the retinal vessel detection task with 82.68% Sensitivity. Moreover, it is possible to integrate (parts of) the proposed framework into most of the recently proposed Fully CNN-based models, in order to improve their effectiveness in medical image segmentation tasks.","Pang, Shuchao; Du, Anan; Yu, Zhenmei; Orgun, Mehmet A",Methods (S.

Climacteric symptoms and other risk factors were evaluated by generalized estimating equations. RESULTS: The prevalence of headache complaints is associated with menopausal stages. Perimenopausal women have relatively high prevalence of headache symptoms, especially stage +1a women (59.0%) compared to late postmenopausal women (37.8%), although menopause stages were not statistically significant in the multivariate analysis. Women who had headache at baseline and depression were much more likely to have headache during menopause. According to the univariate and multivariate analyses in women without headache at baseline, starting menopausal status, insomnia, sweats, and depression were independently associated with newly developed headache. CONCLUSIONS: Symptoms of generalized headache were less prevalent in late postmenopausal women.

Scholars rethinking property beyond the normative “ownership model” have explored the seeming paradoxicality of resisting dispossession through legal forms of possession that reproduce deprivation. In this paper, I consider the possibilities for taking back the concept of possession itself by examining claims to “vacant” property in Philadelphia. I put taking back through a citywide “land bank” in conversation with the taking over of a poor people’s movement that occupies government-owned properties as a means of survival and political mobilization.

This offers the possibility to answer a number of highly relevant questions, regarding the evolution of the virus and the role mutations play in its spread among the population. We focus on spike proteins, as they bear the main responsibility for the effectiveness of the virus diffusion by controlling the interactions with the host cells. Using the available temporal structure of the sequencing data for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in the UK, we demonstrate that every wave of the pandemic is dominated by a different variant. Consequently, the time evolution of each variant follows a temporal structure encoded in the epidemiological Renormalisation Group approach to compartmental models. Machine learning is the tool of choice to determine the variants at play, independent of (but complementary to) the virological classification. Our Machine Learning algorithm on spike protein sequencing provides a simple and unbiased way to identify, classify and track relevant virus variants without any prior knowledge of their characteristics. Hence, we propose a new tool that can help preventing and forecasting the emergence of new waves, and that can be used by decision makers to define short and long term strategies to curb the current COVID-19 pandemic or future ones. HighlightsO_LIObjectives To study the relation between mutations of SARS-CoV-2, the emergence of relevant variants and the multi-wave pattern of the COVID-19 pandemic. C_LIO_LISetting Genomic sequencing of the SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins in the UK nations (England, Scotland, Wales). Epidemiological data for the number of infections in the UK nations, South Africa, California and India. C_LIO_LIMethodology We designed a simple Machine Learning algorithm based on the Levenshtein distance on the spike protein sequences to cluster the available dataset and define variants. We set up a time-sensitive procedure that allows to define a variant as a chain of subsequent clusters. The Mutation epidemiological Renormalisation Group (MeRG) framework is used to describe the epidemiological data. C_LIO_LIResults Our analysis of the sequencing data from England, Wales and Scotland shows that: O_LIA Machine Learning analysis based only on the spike proteins allows to efficiently identify the variants of concern and of interest, as well as other variants relevant for the diffusion of the virus. C_LIO_LIWe identify a branching relation between variants, thus reconstructing the phylogeny of the main variants. C_LIO_LIComparison with the epidemiological data demonstrates that each new wave is dominated by a new emerging variant, thus confirming the hypothesis that there is a strong correlation between the emergence of variants and the multi-wave pattern. C_LIO_LIThe number of infected by each variant can be modelled via an independent logistic function (sigmoid), thus confirming the MeRG approach. Analyses of the epidemiological data for South Africa, California and India further corroborate this result. C_LI C_LIO_LIConclusions Using a simple Machine Learning algorithm, we are able to identify, classify and track relevant virus variants without any prior knowledge of their characteristics. While our analysis is only based on spike protein sequencing and is unbiased, the results are validated by other informed methods based on the complete genome. By correlating the variant definition to epidemiological data, we discover that each new wave of the COVID-19 pandemic is driven and dominated by a new emerging variant, as identified by our Machine Learning analysis. The results are seminal to the development of a new strategy to study how SARS-CoV-2 variants emerge and to predict the characteristics of future mutations of the spike proteins. Furthermore, the same methodology can be applied to other viral diseases, like influenza, if sufficient sequencing data is available. Hence, we provide an effective and unbiased method to identify new emerging variants that can be responsible for the onset of a new epidemiological wave. Our Machine Learning strategy is, in fact, a new tool that can help preventing and forecasting the emergence of new waves, and it can be used by decision makers to define short and long term strategies to curb the current COVID-19 pandemic or future ones.

Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are potent gastric acid suppressing medications. Whether PPI use vs non-use is associated with severe Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) outcomes remains uncertain. We aimed to compare severe COVID-19 outcomes between current outpatient PPI users and non-users. MethodsWe conducted a retrospective propensity score-weighted analysis of a national cohort of US veterans with established care who tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) through January 9, 2021, and who had 60 days of follow-up. The positive test date was the index date. Current outpatient PPI use up to and including the index date (primary exposure) was compared to non-use, defined as no PPI prescription fill in the 365 days prior to the index date. The primary outcome was a composite of use of mechanical ventilation or death within 60 days. Weighted logistic regression models evaluated severe COVID-19 outcomes between current PPI users vs non-users. ResultsOf 97,674 Veterans with SARS-CoV-2 testing, 14,958 tested positive (6262 [41.9%] current PPI users, 8696 [58.1%] non-users) and comprised the analytic cohort. After weighting, all covariates were well-balanced. In the weighted cohort, there was no difference in the primary composite outcome (8.2% vs 8.0%; OR 1.03, 95% CI 0.91-1.16), secondary composite outcome, nor individual component outcomes between current PPI users and non-users. There was no significant interaction between age and PPI use on outcomes. ConclusionAmong patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, current PPI use vs non-use is not associated with severe COVID-19 outcomes.","Shah, Shailja C.; Halvorson, Alese; McBay, Brandon; Dorn, Chad; Wilson, Otis; Tuteja, Sony; Chang, Kyong-Mi; Suzuki, Ayako; Hunt, Christine; Hauger, Richard; Cho, Kelly; Siew, Edward; Matheny, Michael; Hung, Adriana; Greevy, Robert; Roumie, Christianne",,126,17

Currently available commercial serology assays lack the ability to specifically identify nAbs. An ELISAbased nAb assay (GenScript cPass neutralization antibody assay) has recently received emergency use authorization from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the performance characteristics of this assay and compare and correlate it with the commercial assays that detect SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG. DESIGN: Specimens from SARS-COV-2 infected patients (n=124), healthy donors obtained pre-pandemic (n=100), and from patients with non-COVID (coronavirus disease 2019) respiratory infections (n=92) were analyzed using this assay. Samples with residual volume were also tested on three commercial serology platforms (Abbott, EUROIMMUN, Siemens). Twenty-eight randomly selected specimens from patients with COVID-19 and 10 healthy controls were subjected to a Plaque Reduction Neutralization Test (PRNT). RESULTS: The cPass assay exhibited 96.1% (95% CI, 94.9%-97.3%) sensitivity (at >14 days post- positive PCR), 100% (95% CI, 98.0%-100.0%) specificity and zero cross-reactivity for the presence of non- COVID respiratory infections. When compared to the plaque reduction assay, 97.4% (95% CI, 96.2%-98.5%) qualitative agreement and a positive correlation (R2 =0.76) was observed. Comparison of IgG signals from each of the commercial assays with the nAb results from PRNT/cPass assays displayed >94.7% qualitative agreement and correlations with R2=0.43/0.68 (Abbott), R2=0.57/0.85 (EUROIMMUN) and R2=0.39/0.63 (Siemens), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The combined data support the use of cPass assay for accurate detection of the nAb response. Positive IgG results from commercial assays associated reasonably with nAbs presence and can serve as a substitute.","Nandakumar, Vijayalakshmi; Profaizer, Tracie; Lozier, Bucky K; Elgort, Marc G; Larragoite, Erin T; Williams, Elizabeth S C P; Solis-Leal, Antonio; Lopez, J Brandon; Berges, Bradford K; Planelles, Vicente; Rychert, Jenna; Slev, Patricia R; Delgado, Julio C",Arch. pathol. lab. med.

COVID-19 poses a serious threat to human life. The clinical manifestations of COVID-19 are diverse and severe and 20% of infected patients are reported to be in a critical condition. A loss in lung function and pulmonary fibrosis are the main manifestations of patients with the severe form of the disease. The lung function is affected, even after recovery, thereby greatly affecting the psychology and well-being of patients, and significantly reducing their quality of life. METHODS: Participants must meet the following simultaneous inclusion criteria: over 18 years of age, should have recovered from severe or critical COVID-19 cases, should exhibit pulmonary fibrosis after recovery, and should exhibit Qi-Yin deficiency syndrome as indicated in the system of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). The eligible candidates will be randomized into treatment or control groups. The treatment group will receive modern medicine (pirfenidone) plus TCM whereas the control group will be administered modern medicine plus TCM placebo. The lung function index will be continuously surveyed and recorded. By comparing the treatment effect between the two groups, the study intend to explore whether TCM can improve the effectiveness of modern medicine in patients with pulmonary fibrosis arising as a sequelae after SARS-CoV-2 infection. DISCUSSION: Pulmonary fibrosis is one of fatal sequelae for some severe or critical COVID-19 cases, some studies reveal that pirfenidone lead to a delay in the decline of forced expiratory vital capacity, thereby reducing the mortality partly. Additionally, although TCM has been proven to be efficacious in treating pulmonary fibrosis, its role in treating pulmonary fibrosis related COVID-19 has not been explored. Hence, a multicenter, parallel-group, randomized controlled, interventional, prospective clinical trial has been designed and will be conducted to determine if a new comprehensive treatment for pulmonary fibrosis related to COVID-19 is feasible and if it can improve the quality of life of patients. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This multicenter, parallel-group, randomized controlled, interventional, prospective trial was registered at the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR2000033284) on 26th May 2020 (prospective registered).","Lu, Zhen-Hui; Yang, Chun-Li; Yang, Gai-Ge; Pan, Wen-Xu; Tian, Li-Guang; Zheng, Jin-Xin; Lv, Shan; Zhang, Shao-Yan; Zheng, Pei-Yong; Zhang, Shun-Xian",Infect Dis Poverty,126,16

Such data can guide service improvement, especially when connecting the public health community to the latest research during such incidents. Four U.S. public health outbreaks were used to measure DOCLINE’s capacity to support information seeking behaviors: requests during the Summer 2019 measles outbreak;the Fall 2019 e-cigarette lung injury event;the 2018–2019 influenza season;and early stages of the 2020 COVID-19 outbreak. NLM Medical Subject Headings were used to identify related requests. A team of NLM librarians analyzed these for trends in request volume, geographic and institution type, and content. While the number of PHE-related requests did not make up a large percentage of the total placed, there were identifiable increases during the selected periods. These originated from a variety of geographic locations, with some noticeable intersection with outbreak areas. Hospitals initiated the most requests. This investigation provides evidence that DOCLINE data can be used to drive system development and that a targeted ILL system with rapid turnaround times is an especially valuable library resource during PHEs.

This led to the UK government advising patients with blood cancers to shield, massive re-organisation of NHS haematology and cancer services, and changes in treatment plans for thousands of patients. Given the unknown effects that relaxation of social-distancing measures will have on the infection rate, we review the evidence to date to see whether a history of haematological malignancy is associated with increased risk of COVID-19. Multivariable analysis of large population studies, taking other known risk factors into account, do indicate that patients with haematological malignancy, especially those diagnosed recently, are at increased risk of death from COVID-19 compared to the general population. The evidence that this risk is higher than for those with solid malignancies is conflicting. There is suggestive evidence from smaller cohort studies that those with myeloid malignancy may be at increased risk within the blood cancer population, but this needs to be confirmed on larger studies. Ongoing large collaborative efforts are required to gain further evidence regarding specific risk factors for severe complications of COVID-19.","El-Sharkawi, Dima; Iyengar, Sunil",Br J Haematol,126,1

METHODS: This study determined the emission concentrations of Gram-negative bacteria and Staphylococcus aureus bioaerosols from two WWTPs under various aeration modes. Then, a strict quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) was performed on several exposure scenarios associated with occupational health risks of temporary entrants (researchers, visitors, and inspectors) and staffs (field engineer and laboratory technician). RESULTS: Although the bioaerosol concentrations were generally regarded as safe according to existing standards, these bioaerosols' health risks were still unacceptable. The microbial bioaerosols posed considerable infection health risks in WWTPs. These risks were generally above the WHO and US EPA benchmarks. The health risks of females were always smaller than those of male of grown-up age group. Staffs that had been exposed to bioaerosols for a long time were found to have higher health risks compared with temporary entrants. In addition, field engineers equipped with PPE rendered low health risks, thus revealing that wearing PPE could effectively reduce the occupational health risks. CONCLUSION: This study provided novel data and enriched the knowledge of microbial bioaerosol emission's health risks from various aeration modes in WWTPs. Management decisions could be executed by authorities on the basis of the results of QMRA for field engineers equipped with PPE to reduce the related occupational health risks.","Yan, Cheng; Leng, Ya-Li; Wu, Jun-Ting",Int. arch. occup. environ. health,126,14

Here, we review the literature to date of the short-term and long-term consequences of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection on the heart. RECENT FINDINGS: Early case reports described a spectrum of cardiovascular manifestations of COVID-19, including myocarditis, stress cardiomyopathy, myocardial infarction, and arrhythmia. However, in most cases, myocardial injury in COVID-19 appears to be predominantly mediated by the severity of critical illness rather than direct injury to myocardium from viral particles. While cardiac magnetic resonance imaging remains a powerful tool for diagnosing acute myocarditis, it should be used judiciously in light of low baseline prevalence of myocarditis. Guiding an athletic patient through return to play (RTP) after COVID-19 infection is a challenging process. More recent data show RTP has been a safe endeavor using a screening protocol. ""Long COVID"" or post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection has also been described. The reported symptoms span a large breadth of cardiopulmonary and neurologic complaints including fatigue, palpitations, chest pain, breathlessness, brain fog, and dysautonomia including postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS). Management of POTS/dysautonomia primarily centers on education, exercise, and salt and fluid repletion. Our understanding of the impact of COVID-19 on the cardiovascular system is constantly evolving. As we enter a new age of survivorship, additional research is needed to catalogue the burden of persistent cardiopulmonary symptoms. Research is also needed to learn how acute management may alter the likelihood and prevalence of this chronic syndrome.","Chilazi, Michael; Duffy, Eamon Y; Thakkar, Aarti; Michos, Erin D",Curr Atheroscler Rep,126,21

Immunization through large-scale vaccination is the cornerstone of infection prevention in this population. This study aims to identify risk factors for low response to the BNT-162b2 (Pfizer BioNTech) vaccine in a HD cohort. Materials and MethodsObservational prospective study of a HD group followed in a Portuguese Public Founded Hemodialysis Center who received BNT-162b2 vaccination. Specific anti-Spike IgG was evaluated as arbitrary units per milliliter (AU/mL) on two separate occasions: 3 weeks after the first dose and 3 weeks after the second. IgG titers, Non-Responders (NR), and Weak-Responders (WR) after each dose were evaluated against risk factors that included demographic, clinical and analytical variables. ResultsHumoral response evaluated by IgG anti-Spike levels showed a strong correlation with Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) and intact parathormone (iPTH) after each inoculation (1st dose: {rho}=-0.64/0.54; 2nd dose: {rho}=-0.66/0.63, respectively; p<0.01 throughout). After completing both doses: 1) NR were associated with female sex (p<0.01), lower albumin and iPTH (p=0.01); 2) WR showed higher CCI, older age, lower iPTH and lower albumin (p=<0.01, p=0.03, p<0.01, p=0.05, respectively) and, consistently, associated with CCI over 8, age over 75, iPTH under 150 ng/L, female sex, dialysis vintage under 24 months and central venous catheter (CVC) over arteriovenous fistula (p=0.01, p=0.03, p<0.01, p=0.01, p=0.01, p<0.01, respectively). A binary regression model using CCI, sex (male) and CVC was statistically significant in prediction of WR after the 2nd dose with OR (95% CI): 1.81 (1.06-3.08); 0.05 (0.01-0.65); 13.55 (1.06-174.18), respectively (p=0.01). ConclusionOlder age, higher CCI, lower iPTH and albumin, CVC as vascular access and recent hemodialysis initiation (less than 2 years) associate with lower response to vaccination in our study. A higher comorbidity burden is suggested as a more significant surrogate marker for low immunogenicity rather than age alone.

In the pre-cancerous state of cirrhosis, there is an accumulation of neoantigens that may be specifically targetable through immunotherapy. We asked if immune checkpoint inhibition could prevent tumorigenesis in a mouse model of diethylnitrosamine (DEN) and carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) induced HCC. We found that initiation of anti-PD-1 therapy prior to tumorigenesis could prevent up to 46% of liver tumors. This significant reduction in tumor burden was accompanied by infiltration of CD4+ T helper and CD8+ cytotoxic T cells into the liver parenchyma. Importantly, Anti-PD-1 therapy did not exacerbate liver dysfunction or worsen overall health in this liver disease model. Given the safety and preservation of quality of life observed with long-term immunotherapy use, an immunotherapy chemoprevention strategy is likely associated with a low risk-to-benefit ratio and high value care in select patients. These results encourage a prevention trial in cirrhotic patients with the highest risk of developing HCC.","Chung, Andrew S; Mettlen, Marcel; Ganguly, Debolina; Lu, Tianshi; Wang, Tao; Brekken, Rolf A; Hsiehchen, David; Zhu, Hao",Cancer prev. res.

We aimed to investigate susceptibility to COVID-19 in patients with autoimmune rheumatic diseases during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: We did a multicentre retrospective study of patients with autoimmune rheumatic diseases in Hubei province, the epicentre of the COVID-19 outbreak in China. Patients with rheumatic diseases were contacted through an automated telephone-based survey to investigate their susceptibility to COVID-19. Data about COVID-19 exposure or diagnosis were collected. Families with a documented history of COVID-19 exposure, as defined by having at least one family member diagnosed with COVID-19, were followed up by medical professionals to obtain detailed information, including sex, age, smoking history, past medical history, use of medications, and information related to COVID-19. Findings: Between March 20 and March 30, 2020, 6228 patients with autoimmune rheumatic diseases were included in the study. The overall rate of COVID-19 in patients with an autoimmune rheumatic disease in our study population was 0·43% (27 of 6228 patients). We identified 42 families in which COVID-19 was diagnosed between Dec 20, 2019, and March 20, 2020, in either patients with a rheumatic disease or in a family member residing at the same physical address during the outbreak. Within these 42 families, COVID-19 was diagnosed in 27 (63%) of 43 patients with a rheumatic disease and in 28 (34%) of 83 of their family members with no rheumatic disease (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 2·68 [95% CI 1·14-6·27]; p=0·023). Patients with rheumatic disease who were taking hydroxychloroquine had a lower risk of COVID-19 infection than patients taking other disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (OR 0·09 [95% CI 0·01-0·94]; p=0·044). Additionally, the risk of COVID-19 was increased with age (adjusted OR 1·04 [95%CI 1·01-1·06]; p=0·0081). Interpretation: Patients with autoimmune rheumatic disease might be more susceptible to COVID-19 infection than the general population.

The pandemic spread has challenged the National Health System, requiring reallocation of most of the available health care resources to treat COVID-19-positive patients, generating a competition with other health care needs, including cancer. Patients with cancer are at higher risk of developing critical illness after COVID-19 infection. Thus, mitigation strategies should be adopted to reduce the likelihood of infection in all patients with cancer. At the same time, suboptimal care and treatments may result in worse cancer-related outcome. In this article, we attempt to estimate the individual risk-benefit balance to define personalized strategies for optimal breast cancer management, avoiding as much as possible a general untailored approach.

IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Managing patients with breast cancer during the COVID-19 outbreak is challenging. The present work highlights the need to estimate the individual patient risk of infection, which depends on both epidemiological considerations and individual clinical characteristics. The management of patients with breast cancer should be adapted and personalized according to the balance between COVID-19-related risk and the expected benefit of treatments.

For this, we mainly consider AI-driven tools that employ two different types of image data, namely chest Computed Tomography (CT) and X-ray. We elaborate on their strengths and weaknesses by taking the following important factors into account: i) dataset size; ii) model fitting criteria (over-fitting and under-fitting); iii) transfer learning in the deep learning era; and iv) data augmentation. Medical imaging tools do not explicitly analyze model fitting. Also, using transfer learning, with fewer data, one could possibly build Covid-19 deep learning model but they are limited to education and training. We observe that, in both image modalities, neither the dataset size nor does data augmentation work well for Covid-19 screening purposes because a large dataset does not guarantee all possible Covid-19 manifestations and data augmentation does not create new Covid-19 cases.","Santosh, K C; Ghosh, Sourodip",J Med Syst,126,30

Early reports document substantially higher case fatality rates for HCT recipients than faced by the general population. The threat to individual patients is real, but at present, we do not have a clear picture of how much of this threat is present within the first year after HCT, as the majority of cases in early reports occurred after the first year. Still unknown is how infection rates and outcomes vary with time after HCT. This is important because center-specific survival estimates for reporting purposes focus on 1-year post-HCT mortality. Transplant centers have dramatically changed practices due to the pandemic. For many centers, quality assurance processes and procedures were disrupted, and these changes likely affected team performance. Centers have been affected unevenly by the pandemic, by time, location, and COVID-19 burden. Assessment of center-specific survival depends on the ability to adjust for risk factors such as COVID-19 that are outside center control using consistent methods so that team performance based on controllable risk factors can be ascertained. The Center of International Blood and Marrow Transplantation Research (CIBMTR) convened a working group for the 2020 Center Outcomes Forum (COF) to assess the impact of COVID-19 on both patient-specific risks and center-specific performance.

This study will also assess provider preference on personal protective equipment (PPE) during UDS and awareness of relevant international guidelines. The outcome is to offer a practical means of reducing the risk of aerosol transmission during UDS, to include a protocol for screening patients, and to consider safer methods of inducing urethral leak-point pressure. Methods A 14-point, multiple-response, online questionnaire was designed through Survey Monkey. This was dis-tributed to healthcare workers involved in UDS via email, WhatsApp, and Twitter. This included, of varying experience; urologists, urogynaecologists, clinical nurse specialists, and clinical scientists across the United Kingdom (UK), United States of America (USA), Australia, Europe, and Middle-East. Results The study was conducted over two weeks and there were 104 responses to the survey. The majority of respondents were consultants (60%) and 73% of respondents performed UDS regularly. There were 56.7% of respondents who felt that UDS was safe to be re-instated and there were 52.8% who did not feel coughing was safe during the procedure. At the time of the survey, 83.5% were unaware of any national or international urological guidelines on the best practice for urodynamics during this era and 52.8% of clinicians stated they would wear PPE during UDS if it were reinstated. Conclusion The majority of respondents felt safe to reinstate UDS; however, they felt more official guidance and recommendation is needed. Our proposed protocol can provide a safe and practical approach that keeps healthcare workers and patients safe.","Jabbar, Talal; Mills, Samuel; Simpson, Richard; Jones, Adam; Campbell, Iain; Abed, Omar Al-Mula",J.

We assess the efficacy of the cordon sanitaire to delay the introduction and onset of local transmission of COVID-19 in other major cities in mainland China. METHODS: We estimated the number of infected travellers from Wuhan to other major cities in mainland China from November 2019 to February 2020 using previously estimated COVID-19 prevalence in Wuhan and publicly available mobility data. We focused on Beijing, Chongqing, Hangzhou, and Shenzhen as four representative major cities to identify the potential independent contribution of the cordon sanitaire and holiday travel. To do this, we simulated outbreaks generated by infected arrivals in these destination cities using stochastic branching processes. We also modelled the effect of the cordon sanitaire in combination with reduced transmissibility scenarios to simulate the effect of local non-pharmaceutical interventions. RESULTS: We find that in the four cities, given the potentially high prevalence of COVID-19 in Wuhan between December 2019 and early January 2020, local transmission may have been seeded as early as 1-8 January 2020. By the time the cordon sanitaire was imposed, infections were likely in the thousands. The cordon sanitaire alone did not substantially affect the epidemic progression in these cities, although it may have had some effect in smaller cities. Reduced transmissibility resulted in a notable decrease in the incidence of infection in the four studied cities. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that sustained transmission was likely occurring several weeks prior to the implementation of the cordon sanitaire in four major cities of mainland China and that the observed decrease in incidence was likely attributable to other non-pharmaceutical, transmission-reducing interventions.","Quilty, Billy J; Diamond, Charlie; Liu, Yang; Gibbs, Hamish; Russell, Timothy W; Jarvis, Christopher I; Prem, Kiesha; Pearson, Carl A B; Clifford, Samuel; Flasche, Stefan; Klepac, Petra; Eggo, Rosalind M; Jit, Mark",BMC Med,126,4

One key aspect, compared to other recent pandemics, is the level of urgency, which has started a race for finding adequate answers. Solutions for efficient prevention approaches, rapid, reliable, and high throughput diagnostics, monitoring, and safe therapies are needed. Research across the world has been directed to fight against COVID-19. Biomedical science has been presented as a possible area for combating the SARS-CoV-2 virus due to the unique challenges raised by the pandemic, as reported by epidemiologists, immunologists, and medical doctors, including COVID-19's survival, symptoms, protein surface composition, and infection mechanisms. While the current knowledge about the SARS-CoV-2 virus is still limited, various (old and new) biomedical approaches have been developed and tested.

This study aims to determine perceptions of physicians in our institution on the role of telemedicine in cancer care during the COVID-19 pandemic and to assess its perceived benefits and barriers. Methods. This is a cross-sectional study of physicians involved in cancer care in a tertiary referral hospital in the Philippines. We administered a 21-item online survey questionnaire between August to October 2020. Results. We received and analyzed 84 physician responses. Ninety-six percent of physicians currently use telemedicine, an increase from 59% pre-pandemic. Eighty-nine percent use telemedicine for follow-up virtual consults, while 75% use telemedicine for case discussions in multidisciplinary meetings. The mean number of monthly patient consults conducted through telemedicine increased to 29.5 (SD: 24.8) from a pre-pandemic mean of 7.7 (SD: 18.7). Eighty-four percent of respondents perceived its main benefit as an infection control measure. The other perceived benefits of telemedicine include convenience (78%), accessibility to cancer care (72%), cost-effectiveness (68%), and time efficiency (44%). A quarter of the respondents believed that telemedicine has the potential to improve cancer outcomes. Ninety-two percent of the respondents expressed that they will use telemedicine occasionally in their practice. Conclusion. Telemedicine was perceived by Filipino physicians in a tertiary hospital as an acceptable solution for the provision of cancer care during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Tele-oncology should be further investigated to maximize patient and physician satisfaction and improve cancer outcomes.

Although a superspreader is an individual who undergoes more viral shedding and transmission than others, it appears likely that environmental factors have a substantial role in SSEs. We categorise SSEs into two distinct groups: 'societal' and 'isolated' SSEs. METHODS: We summarise SSEs that have occurred using multiple databases that have been cross referenced to ensure numbers are as reliable as we can ascertain. This enables more focussed and productive control of the current pandemic and future pandemics, especially as countries and regions ease lockdown restrictions. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: 'Societal' SSEs pose a significant threat as members of the event are free to mingle and can infect individuals in the outside community. On the other hand, 'isolated' SSEs can be effectively quarantined as only a few individuals can transmit the virus from the isolated community to the outside community, therefore lowering further societal infection.","Majra, Dasha; Benson, Jayme; Pitts, Jennifer; Stebbing, Justin",J. infect,126,22

Patients and methods: We conducted a nationwide online survey among adult patients with PACS as defined by symptoms persisting over 4 weeks following a confirmed or probable COVID-19, without any identified alternative diagnosis. Information concerning PACS symptoms, vaccine type and scheme and its effect on PACS symptoms were studied. Results: Six hundred and twenty surveys were completed and 567 satisfied the inclusion criteria and were analyzed. Respondents were 83.4% of women of median age 44 (IQR 25-75: 37-50). Initial infection was proven in 365 patients (64%) and 5.1% had been hospitalized to receive oxygen. 396 patients had received at least one injection of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine at the time of the survey, after a median of 357 [198-431] days following the initially-reported SARS-CoV-2 infection. Among the 380 patients who reported persistent symptoms at the time of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, 201 (52.8%) reported variation of symptoms following the injection, without difference based on the type of vaccine used. After a complete vaccination scheme, 93.3% (28/30) of initially seronegative patients reported a positive anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG. 170 PACS patients had not been vaccinated. The most common reasons for postponing SARS-CoV-2 vaccine were a fear of worsening PACS symptoms (55.9%) and the idea that vaccination was contraindicated because of PACS (15.6%). Conclusion: Our study suggests that SARS-CoV-2 vaccination is well tolerated in the majority of PACS patients and has good immunogenicity. Disseminating these reassuring data might prove crucial to increase vaccine coverage in patients with PACS.","SCHERLINGER, Marc; Pijnenburg, Luc; Chatelus, Emmanuel; Arnaud, Laurent; Gottenberg, Jacques-Eric; Sibilia, Jean; Felten, Renaud",,126,16

MATERIAL AND METHODS: This is an observational, retrospective descriptive study of 507 patients with a diagnosis of neurocognitive disorder (according to DSM-5 criteria) evaluated in a referral centre in Bogotá, Colombia, in 2015. RESULTS: Among the group of patients assessed, analyses reveal mean age for minor neurocognitive disorders of 71.04 years, and 75.32 years for major neurocognitive disorder (P <0.001). A total of 62.72% of the sample were female. The most prevalent aetiology of the neurocognitive disorders was Alzheimer's disease, followed by behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia and neurocognitive disorders due to multiple aetiologies. BD occur more frequently in neurocognitive disorder due to behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia (100%), Alzheimer's disease (77.29%) and vascular disease (76.19%). The most prevalent BD in the group assessed were apathy (50.75%), irritability (48.45%), aggression (16.6%), and emotional lability (14.76%). CONCLUSIONS: BD are highly prevalent in patients with diagnosis of major neurocognitive disorder. BD are more prevalent in behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia than any other group. Apathy, irritability, emotional lability and aggression are the BD that occur with greater prevalence in our sample.

However, seminars, meetings and conferences are necessary for updating our knowledge and skills. Web-based seminars (webinars) are the solutions to this issue. This study aimed to show the participant behaviour when webinars present at the COVID-19 pandemic era. METHODS: From December 2017 to July 2020, 58 webinars were broadcasted via the Uropedia, electronic library of SUST. Data of all webinars were collected with the YouTube analytics and application of the Uropedia. Data of streaming webinars included participant behaviours such as content views, engagement time, total unique attendees, average engagement time and the number of audience to leads. Data were split into two groups; group-1 is webinars before COVID-19 (before March 2020) and group-2 is the webinars during COVID-19. RESULTS: Total broadcast time and total page view number were found to be 112.6 hours (6761 minutes) and 15 919, respectively. The median participant age was 40.1 y. Median content view and median engagement time were found to be 261.0 and 12.2 minutes, respectively. Comparison of two groups revealed a significant increment in the content views (group-1; 134.0 range = 86.0-87.0 and group-2; 414.0 range = 296.0-602.0, P < .001) and the number of the unique attendees (group 1; 18.0 range = 10.0-26.0 and group-2; 57.0 range = 27.0-100.0, P < .001) following COVID-19. However, the median engagement time of the audience did not seem to change with the COVID-19 pandemic (group-1; 11.5 range = 10.0-13.3 minutes and group-2; 13.2 range = 9.4-18.1 minutes, P = .12). CONCLUSION: The webinars are effective ways to share information and have many advantages, including low cost, reaching a high number of audiences. Audience number and page visits seemed to increase following the COVID-19 pandemic. However, this era did not seem to affect the critical attitude of the audience, which is engagement time.","Tanidir, Yiloren; Gokalp, Fatih; Akdogan, Nebil; Batur, Ali Furkan; Sekerci, Cagri Akin; Egriboyun, Sedat; Deger, Mutlu; Sahin, Bahadir; Akarken, Ilker; Aydin, Cemil; Altan, Mesut; Ozman, Oktay; Ucar, Murat; Gudeloglu, Ahmet; Ongun, Sakir; Akbal, Cem; Esen, Adil",Int J Clin Pract,126,26

The World Health Organisation has suggested that governments take a proactive response to vaccine hesitancy 'hotspots' based on social and behavioural insights. METHODS: Representative longitudinal online survey of over 3000 adults from Australia that examines the demographic, attitudinal, political and social attitudes and COVID-19 health behavior correlates of vaccine hesitance and resistance to a COVID-19 vaccine. RESULTS: Overall, 59% would definitely get the vaccine, 29% had low levels of hesitancy, 7% had high levels of hesitancy and 6% were resistant. Females, those living in disadvantaged areas, those who reported that risks of COVID-19 was overstated, those who had more populist views and higher levels of religiosity were more likely to be hesitant or resistant while those who had higher levels of household income, those who had higher levels of social distancing, who downloaded the COVID-Safe App, who had more confidence in their state or territory government or confidence in their hospitals, or were more supportive of migration were more likely to intend to get vaccinated. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that vaccine hesitancy, which accounts for a significant proportion of the population can be addressed by public health messaging but for a significant minority of the population with strongly held beliefs, alternative policy measures may well be needed to achieve sufficient vaccination coverage to end the pandemic.","Edwards, Ben; Biddle, Nicholas; Gray, Matthew; Sollis, Kate",PLoS One,126,25

MATERIAL AND METHODS Seventy-four patients with COVID-19 were prospectively followed for longitudinal assessment of somatic symptom burden and sleep quality. We used the 8-item Somatic Symptom Scale (SSS-8) and the modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) scale for somatic symptom burden and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index for sleep quality investigation. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify independent factors associated with somatic symptom burden and sleep quality. RESULTS Although the degree of physical discomfort and sleep quality issues tended to decline during self-quarantine, patients still experienced these problems to a certain degree. Univariate and multivariate analyses showed that SSS-8 scores at admission (relative risk [RR] 1.234, 95% CI 1.075-1.417, P=0.003) and mMRC scores at discharge (RR 2.420, 95% CI 1.251-4.682, P=0.009) were 2 independent prognostic indicators of somatic symptom burden. In addition, muscle pain as a chief complaint (RR 4.682, 95% CI 1.247-17.580, P<0.022) and history of use of hypnotic drugs (RR 0.148, 95% CI 0.029-0.749, P<0.019) were 2 independent indicators of patient sleep quality during hospitalization. CONCLUSIONS To the best of our knowledge, the present study was the first dynamic assessment of the somatic symptom burden and sleep quality in patients with COVID-19 during hospitalization and quarantine after discharge. Patients with high somatic symptom burden at admission, especially muscle pain as the chief complaint, are prone to having a higher physical burden and more sleep disturbance at discharge.","Huang, Shujie; Zhuang, Weitao; Wang, Dongya; Zha, Lulu; Xu, Xi; Li, Xiangdong; Shi, Qiuling; Wang, Xin Shelley; Qiao, Guibin",Med Sci Monit,126,16

The Moyal parameters give all the information to describe the form and the impact of the illness outbreak in the different affected countries and its global impact. We checked that the Moyal distribution can accurately fit the daily report of {\it{new confirmed cases of infected people}} (NCC) per country, in that places where the contagion is reaching their final phase, describing the beginning, the most intense phase and the descend of the contagion, simultaneously . In order to achieve the purpose of this work, it is important to work with a complete and well compilated set of the data to be used to fit the curves. Data from European countries like France, Spain, Italy Belgium, Sweden, United Kingdom, Denmark and others like USA and China, have been used. Also, the correlation between the parameters of the Moyal distribution fitting and the general public health measures imposed in each country, have been discussed. A relation between those policies and the features of the Moyal distribution, in terms of their parameters and critical points, is shown; from that, it can be seen that the knowledge of the time evolution of the epidemiological curve, their critical points, superposition properties and rates of the rising and the ending, could help to find a way to estimate the efficiency of social distancing measures, imposed in each country, and anticipate the different phases of the pandemic.","Bernal-Alvarado, Jose de Jesus; Delepine, David",,126,16

In the United States, there has been a strong partisan divide between the Democratic and Republican party's narratives about the pandemic which resulted in polarization of individual behaviors and divergent policy adoption across regions. As shown in this case, as well as in most major social issues, strongly polarized narrative frameworks facilitate such narratives. To understand polarization and other social chasms, it is critical to dissect these diverging narratives. Here, taking the Democratic and Republican political social media posts about the pandemic as a case study, we demonstrate that a combination of computational methods can provide useful insights into the different contexts, framing, and characters and relationships that construct their narrative frameworks which individual posts source from. Leveraging a dataset of tweets from elite politicians in the U.S., we found that the Democrats' narrative tends to be more concerned with the pandemic as well as financial and social support, while the Republicans discuss more about other political entities such as China. We then perform an automatic framing analysis to characterize the ways in which they frame their narratives, where we found that the Democrats emphasize the government's role in responding to the pandemic, and the Republicans emphasize the roles of individuals and support for small businesses. Finally, we present a semantic role analysis that uncovers the important characters and relationships in their narratives as well as how they facilitate a membership categorization process. Our findings concretely expose the gaps in the""elusive consensus""between the two parties. Our methodologies may be applied to computationally study narratives in various domains.","Jing, Elise; Ahn, Yong-Yeol",,126,24

Our micro-level model keeps track of the infection state for each individual at every point in time, ranging from susceptible, exposed, infectious to recovered. We develop a Monte Carlo EM algorithm to infer contact-channel specific infection transmission probabilities. Our algorithm uses Gibbs sampling to draw samples of the latent infection status of each individual over the entire time period of analysis, given the latent infection status of all contacts and test outcome data. Experimental results with simulated data demonstrate our CRISP model can be parametrized by the reproduction factor $R_0$ and exhibits population-level infectiousness and recovery time series similar to those of the classical SEIR model. However, due to the individual contact data, this model allows fine grained control and inference for a wide range of COVID-19 mitigation and suppression policy measures. Moreover, the algorithm is able to support efficient testing in a test-trace-isolate approach to contain COVID-19 infection spread. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first model with efficient inference for COVID-19 infection spread based on individual-level contact data; most epidemic models are macro-level models that reason over entire populations.

The kindergartens reopened on April 20, and the schools on April 27 and May 11 of 2020. The effect of these measures is largely unknown since the role of children in the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus is still unclear. There are only a few studies of school closures as a separate intervention to other social distancing measures, and little research exists on the effect of school opening during a pandemic. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to model the effect of opening kindergartens and the schools in Norway in terms of a change in the reproduction number (R). A secondary objective was to assess if we can use the estimated R after school openings to infer the rates of transmission between children in schools. METHODS: We used an individual-based model (IBM) to assess the reopening of kindergartens and schools in two Norwegian cities, Oslo, the Norwegian capital, with a population of approximately 680 000, and Tromsø, which is the largest city in Northern Norway, with a population of approximately 75 000. The model uses demographic information and detailed data about the schools in both cities. We carried out an ensemble study to obtain robust results in spite of the considerable uncertainty that remains about the transmission of SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: We found that reopening of Norwegian kindergartens and schools are associated with a change in R of 0.10 (95%CI 0.04-0.16) and 0.14 (95%CI 0.01-0.25) in the two cities under investigation if the in-school transmission rates for the SARS-CoV-2 virus are equal to what has previously been estimated for influenza pandemics. CONCLUSION: We found only a limited effect of reopening schools on the reproduction number, and we expect the same to hold true in other countries where nonpharmaceutical interventions have suppressed the pandemic. Consequently, current R-estimates are insufficiently accurate for determining the transmission rates in schools. For countries that have closed schools, planned interventions, such as the opening of selected schools, can be useful to infer general knowledge about children-to-children transmission of SARS-CoV-2.","Rypdal, Martin; Rypdal, Veronika; Jakobsen, Per Kristen; Ytterstad, Elinor; Løvsletten, Ola; Klingenberg, Claus; Rypdal, Kristoffer",PLoS One,126,25

Although this gratitude is undoubtedly appreciated by many, we must be cautious about overuse of the term 'hero' in such discussions. The challenges currently faced by healthcare workers are substantially greater than those encountered in their normal work, and it is understandable that the language of heroism has been evoked to praise them for their actions. Yet such language can have potentially negative consequences. Here, I examine what heroism is and why it is being applied to the healthcare workers currently, before outlining some of the problems associated with the heroism narrative currently being employed by the media. Healthcare workers have a clear and limited duty to treat during the COVID-19 pandemic, which can be grounded in a broad social contract and is strongly associated with certain reciprocal duties that society has towards healthcare workers. I argue that the heroism narrative can be damaging, as it stifles meaningful discussion about what the limits of this duty to treat are. It fails to acknowledge the importance of reciprocity, and through its implication that all healthcare workers have to be heroic, it can have negative psychological effects on workers themselves. I conclude that rather than invoking the language of heroism to praise healthcare workers, we should examine, as a society, what duties healthcare workers have to work in this pandemic, and how we can support them in fulfilling these.","Cox, Caitríona L",J Med Ethics,126,15

RESULTS: A NSL model (area under the curve (AUC) 0.932) and a NL model (AUC 0.903) were developed based on neutrophil percentage and lactate dehydrogenase with and without oxygen saturation (SaO2) using the training dataset. AUCs of the NSL and NL models in the test dataset were 0.910 and 0.871, respectively. The risk scoring systems corresponding to these two models were established. The AUCs of the NSL and NL scores in the training dataset were 0.928 and 0.901, respectively. At the optimal cut-off value of NSL score, the sensitivity and specificity were 94% and 82%, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of NL score were 94% and 75%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: These scores may be used to predict the risk of death in severe COVID-19 patients and the NL score could be used in regions where patients' SaO2 cannot be tested.","Fan, Xiude; Zhu, Bin; Nouri-Vaskeh, Masoud; Jiang, Chunguo; Feng, Xiaokai; Poulsen, Kyle; Baradaran, Behzad; Fang, Jiansong; Ade, Erfan Ahmadi; Sharifi, Akbar; Zhao, Zhigang; Han, Qunying; Zhang, Yong; Zhang, Liming; Liu, Zhengwen",Virol J,126,21

This novel pandemic and non-pharmaceutical interventions of lockdown and confinement implemented citywide, regionally or nationally are affecting virus transmission, people&#x2019;s travel patterns, and air quality. Many studies have been conducted to predict the diffusion of the COVID-19 disease, assess the impacts of the pandemic on human mobility and on air quality, and assess the impacts of lockdown measures on viral spread with a range of Machine Learning (ML) techniques. This literature review aims to analyze the results from past research to understand the interactions among the COVID-19 pandemic, lockdown measures, human mobility, and air quality. The critical review of prior studies indicates that urban form, people&#x2019;s socioeconomic and physical conditions, social cohesion, and social distancing measures significantly affect human mobility and COVID-19 viral transmission. During the COVID-19 pandemic, many people are inclined to use private transportation for necessary travel to mitigate coronavirus-related health problems. This review study also noticed that COVID-19 related lockdown measures significantly improve air quality by reducing the concentration of air pollutants, which in turn improves the COVID-19 situation by reducing respiratory-related sickness and deaths. It is argued that ML is a powerful, effective, and robust analytic paradigm to handle complex and wicked problems such as a global pandemic. This study also explores the spatio-temporal aspects of lockdown and confinement measures on coronavirus diffusion, human mobility, and air quality. Additionally, we discuss policy implications, which will be helpful for policy makers to take prompt actions to moderate the severity of the pandemic and improve urban environments by adopting data-driven analytic methods.

The stem-loop 2 motif (s2m) is one such element with an unusually high degree of sequence conservation, being found in the 3' UTR in the genomes of many astroviruses, some picornaviruses and noroviruses, and a variety of coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. The evolutionary conservation and its occurrence in all viral subgenomic transcripts implicates a key role of s2m in the viral infection cycle. Our findings indicate that the element, while stably folded, can nonetheless be invaded and remodelled spontaneously by antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) that initiate pairing in exposed loops and trigger efficient sequence-specific RNA cleavage in reporter assays. ASOs also act to inhibit replication in an astrovirus replicon model system in a sequence-specific, dose-dependent manner and inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication in cell culture. Our results thus permit us to suggest that the s2m element is readily targeted by ASOs, which show promise as anti-viral agents.IMPORTANCEThe highly conserved stem-loop 2 motif (s2m) is found in the genomes of many RNA viruses including SARS-CoV-2. Our findings indicate that the s2m element can be targeted by antisense oligonucleotides. The anti-viral potential of this conserved element represents a promising start for further research into targeting conserved elements in RNA viruses.","Lulla, Valeria; Wandel, Michal P; Bandyra, Katarzyna J; Ulferts, Rachel; Wu, Mary; Dendooven, Tom; Yang, Xiaofei; Doyle, Nicole; Oerum, Stephanie; Beale, Rupert; O039,; Rourke, Sara M; Randow, Felix; Maier, Helena J; Scott, William; Ding, Yiliang; Firth, Andrew E; Bloznelyte, Kotryna; Luisi, Ben F",J. virol,126,27

Limited studies have reported on family members' experiences and support needs. AIM: To explore the experiences and support needs of family members of ventilated COVID-19 patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). DESIGN: Exploratory, qualitative design, using in-depth individual telephone interviews, and analyzed using thematic analysis. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Ten family members of adult COVID-19 patients in the ICU. RESULT: Seven key themes represented family members' experiences: (a) reactions to the COVID-19 diagnosis, (b) COVID-19 as a destabilizing force on the family unit, (c) COVID-19's effects on bereavement outcomes, (d) desperately seeking information, (e) family member needs, (f) conflicting feelings about video calls, and (g) appreciation of care. Family members' feelings about the patient's diagnosis and how the virus was contracted exacerbated their stress and anxiety. They struggled to feel informed about care that they could not witness and had difficulty understanding information. Family members reported that video calls were unhelpful. While these experiences made them question the quality of care, they expressed their appreciation of the frontline healthcare providers taking care of their loved ones. CONCLUSION: The stress and uncertainty of family members of critically ill patients with COVID-19 were influenced by their inability to feel connected to the patient and informed about care. Healthcare providers should assess each individual family's burden and preferences, and this should include establishing structured, timely, and consistent communication regarding patient care during the pandemic including early referral to palliative care.","Chen, Chiahui; Wittenberg, Elaine; Sullivan, Suzanne S; Lorenz, Rebecca A; Chang, Yu-Ping",Am J Hosp Palliat Care,126,29

The virus spread quickly, particularly in the North of Italy, with three regions (Lombardy, Veneto and Emilia-Romagna) being the most severely affected. These three regions accounted for >80% of SARS-CoV-2 positive cases when the tight lockdown was established (March 8). These regions include one of Europe's areas of heaviest air pollution, the Po valley. Air pollution has been recently proposed as a possible risk factor of SARS-CoV-2 infection, due to its adverse effect on immunity and to the possibility that polluted air may even carry the virus. We investigated the association between air pollution and subsequent spread of the SARS-CoV-2 infection within these regions. We collected NO2 tropospheric levels using satellite data available at the European Space Agency before the lockdown. Using a multivariable restricted cubic spline regression model, we compared NO2 levels with SARS-CoV-2 infection prevalence rate at different time points after the lockdown, namely March 8, 22 and April 5, in the 28 provinces of Lombardy, Veneto and Emilia-Romagna. We found little association of NO2 levels with SARS-CoV-2 prevalence up to about 130 µmol/m2, while a positive association was evident at higher levels at each time point. Notwithstanding the limitations of the use of aggregated data, these findings lend some support to the hypothesis that high levels of air pollution may favor the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Filippini, Tommaso; Rothman, Kenneth J; Goffi, Alessia; Ferrari, Fabrizio; Maffeis, Giuseppe; Orsini, Nicola; Vinceti, Marco",Sci Total Environ,126,25

At the end of 2019, the world was once again confronted with a health-threatening situation: the emergence of the novel coronavirus. Media can construct health risk information through narratives or stories they provide. Nevertheless, not every pandemic represented was equal. The media could build risk perception about global or local outbreaks. In light of that, this article aims to describe how the media in Indonesia framed the novel coronavirus disease issue (COVID-19) before the pandemic. This article utilized the framing analysis method, literature review, and was guided by health and risk communication framework. This article provided contextual novelty by presenting the analysis of Indonesian newspaper coverage concerning health and risk communication.

The history of past human coronavirus outbreaks resulting in similar health emergencies suggests there will be a substantial prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among COVID-19 survivors. To prepare neuropsychologists for the difficult task of differentiating PTSD-related from neuropathology-related deficits in the oncoming wave of COVID-19 survivors, we integrate research across a spectrum of related areas.Methods: Several areas of literature were reviewed: psychiatric, neurologic, and neuropathological outcomes of SARS and MERS patients; neurological outcomes in COVID-19 survivors; PTSD associated with procedures common to COVID-19 patients; and differentiating neuropsychological deficits due to PTSD from those due to acquired brain injuries in other patient groups.Conclusions: Heightened risk of PTSD occurred in MERS and SARS survivors. While data concerning COVID-19 is lacking, PTSD is known to occur in patient groups who undergo similar hospital courses, including ICU survivors, patients who are intubated and mechanically ventilated, and those that experience delirium. Research with patients who develop PTSD in the context of mild traumatic brain injury further suggests that PTSD may account for some or all of a patient's subjective cognitive complaints and neuropsychological test performance.

A feature of the clinical syndrome of COVID-19 is the development of pronounced immunopathological reactions and disorders of hemostasis, leading to the development of a wide range of cardiovascular complications. The course of COVID-19 may be complicated by the development of acute myocardial infarction, venous and arterial thrombosis and thromboembolism in various vascular pools, the development of acute myocardial damage and myocarditis. Among the gastroenterological manifestations, diarrhea, nausea or vomiting, as well as abdominal pain, are most often detected. These symptoms may precede the appearance of respiratory signs of the disease, and in some cases come to the fore in the clinical picture of the disease.

Foram utilizadas ratas (Rattus norvegicus), as quais foram divididas em oito grupos experimentais (n= 5 animais/ grupo) de acordo com o tratamento: A ômega3; B - melatonina; C - exercício físico; D - ômega-3 e melatonina; E - ômega3 e exercício físico; F - melatonina e exercício físico; G - ômega-3, melatonina e exercício físico; H controle. Os protocolos foram iniciados a partir dos 60 dias de idade e prosseguiu até o desmame da prole (165 dias de idade). A prole (n= 15 machos/ grupo) foi submetida ao mesmo protocolo das respectivas matrizes desde o desmame até os 70 dias de idade. A massa corporal aos 30 dias pós-natal (M30) dos animais do grupo B (42,47 g ± 1,23) apresentou-se menor do que a massa corporal dos grupos A (72,71 g ± 3,06), C (71,14 g ± 2,52), D (66,69 g ± 1,88), E (53,91 g ± 0,87), F (67,18 g ± 3,02), G (62,00 g ± 5,02) e H (58,18 g ± 2,62).

Aos 60 dias os níveis de HDL do grupo F (77,13 g ± 13,32) foram superiores quando comparado ao grupo D (25,98 g ± 2,51). Para o VLDL e Triglicerídeo, o grupo F apresentou valor médio de VLDL de 56,00 mg/dL ± 4,40 e de Triglicerídeo de 280,00 mg/dL ± 22,00, enquanto que E apresentou média de 31,49 mg/dL ± 4,74 para VLDL e 157,4 mg/dL ± 23,68 para triglicerídeo, e D apresentou VLDL de 27,12 mg/dL ± 1,78 e triglicerídeo de 135, 6 mg/dL ± 8,90. Em relação à glicemia, os grupos A (39,20 mg/dL ± 14,39), C (39,40 mg/dL ± 9,14) e F (20,60 mg/dL ± 4,57) mostraram-se diferentes quando comparados ao grupo H (155,6 mg/dL ± 16,80), e o grupo D (248,2 mg/dL ± 24,48) diferiu dos grupos A, B (95,60 mg/dL ± 14,39), C, E (131,4 mg/dL ± 28,95), F e G (40,75 mg/dL ± 9,30). Houve ainda diferença significativa entre o grupo E e o grupo F. Em relação à morfometria do hipocampo em M30, apenas o grupo D (24,24% ± 1,31) diferiu dos grupos A (19,68% ± 1,03) e G (19,00% ± 0,45), apresentando uma maior densidade neuronal. Em M60 o grupo B (22,63% ± 0,34) apresentou número de neurônios superior aos grupos A (19,68% ± 1,03), C (15,61% ± 0,58), E (20,50% ± 0,43), F (19,91% ± 0,42) e H (16,97% ± 0,40). Já no grupo C houve redução neuronal em relação aos grupos A, D (23,22% ± 0,46), E, F e G (21,14% ± 0,35). Quando observado o grupo D, este apresentou maior número de neurônios do que os grupos A, E, F e H. Por fim, os grupos A, E, F e G apresentaram maior densidade neuronal quando comparados ao grupo H. Para o teste de reconhecimento não houve diferença entre os tratamentos avaliados aos 30 e 60 dias de idade.

The MERS-CoV receptor, DPP4, and hCoV-229E receptor, ANPEP, were expressed mainly from the compact morula to the blastocyst stages. Transcripts of the MERS-CoV alternate receptor LGALS1 were detected in most cells at all stages of development. TMPRSS2 transcripts were detected in the epiblast, primitive endoderm, and trophectoderm, while transcripts of the endosomal proteases CTSL, CTSB, and FURIN were expressed in most cells at all stages of development. ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were co-expressed in a proportion of epiblast and trophectoderm cells. The embryonic cells expressed genes involved in ESCRT, viral replication, SARS-CoV-2 interactions, and coronavirus infectivity. The ACE2 and TMPRSS2 co-expressing cells were enriched in genes associated with lipid metabolism, lysosome, peroxisome, and oxidative phosphorylation pathways. CONCLUSION: Preimplantation and implantation stage human embryos could be permissive to multiple hCoVs.","Colaco, S; Chhabria, K; Singh, D; Bhide, A; Singh, N; Singh, A; Husein, A; Mishra, A; Sharma, R; Ashary, N; Modi, D",J. assist. reprod. genet,126,23

This study aims to assess COVID-19 and Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome (MIS-C) in Latin American children, to appropriately plan and allocate resources to face the pandemic on a local and international level. METHODS: Ambispective multicenter cohort study from 5 Latin American countries. Children 18 years of age or younger with microbiologically confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection or fulfilling MIS-C definition were included. FINDINGS: Four hundred nine children were included, with a median age of 3.0 years (interquartile range 0.6-9.0). Of these, 95 (23.2%) were diagnosed with MIS-C. One hundred ninety-one (46.7%) children were admitted to hospital and 52 (12.7%) required admission to a pediatric intensive care unit. Ninety-two (22.5%) patients required oxygen support: 8 (2%) were started on continuous positive airway pressure and 29 (7%) on mechanical ventilation. Thirty-five (8.5%) patients required inotropic support. The following factors were associated with pediatric intensive care unit admission: preexisting medical condition (P < 0.0001), immunodeficiency (P = 0.01), lower respiratory tract infection (P < 0.0001), gastrointestinal symptoms (P = 0.006), radiologic changes suggestive of pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (P < 0.0001) and low socioeconomic conditions (P = 0.009). CONCLUSIONS: This study shows a generally more severe form of COVID-19 and a high number of MIS-C in Latin American children, compared with studies from China, Europe and North America, and support current evidence of a more severe disease in Latin/Hispanic children or in people of lower socioeconomic level. The findings highlight an urgent need for more data on COVID-19 in Latin America.","Antúnez-Montes, Omar Yassef; Escamilla, Maria Isabel; Figueroa-Uribe, Augusto Flavio; Arteaga-Menchaca, Erick; Lavariega-Saráchaga, Manuel; Salcedo-Lozada, Perla; Melchior, Priscilla; de Oliveira, Rodrigo Beréa; Tirado Caballero, Juan Carlos; Redondo, Hernando Pinzon; Montes Fontalvo, Laura Vanessa; Hernandez, Roger; Chavez, Carolina; Campos, Francisco; Uribe, Fadia; Del Aguila, Olguita; Rios Aida, Jorge Alberto; Buitrago, Andrea Parra; Betancur Londoño, Lina Maria; Mendoza Vega, León Felipe; Hernández, Carolina Almeida; Sali, Michela; Higuita Palacio, Julian Esteban; Gomez-Vargas, Jessica; Yock-Corrales, Adriana; Buonsenso, Danilo",Pediatr Infect Dis J,126,16

This article describes our approach to teaching, observations, and experience. This case study examines three factors: Firstly, the impact of distance education on overall assessments of students. Using descriptive statistics, the results of student evaluations were compared from the overall assessments for the last six academic years. It was found that distance learning does not affect excellent students and eliminates the number of students who do not pass. Secondly, the participation of students during online lessons, and thirdly, the use of electronic materials. The questionnaire survey and the data from the learning management system Moodle were used to examine the second and third factors.

However, analysis of the underlying molecular mechanisms driving CoronaVac-induced immunity is still limited. Here, we applied a systems biology approach to understand the mechanisms behind the adaptive immune response to CoronaVac in a cohort of 50 volunteers immunized with 2 doses of CoronaVac. Vaccination with CoronaVac led to an integrated immune response that included several effector arms of the adaptive immune system including specific IgM/IgG, humoral response and other immune response, as well as the innate immune system as shown by complement activation. Metabolites associated with immunity were also identified implicating the role of metabolites in the humoral response, complement activation and other immune response. Networks associated with the TCA cycle and amino acids metabolic pathways, such as phenylalanine metabolism, phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis, and glycine, serine and threonine metabolism were tightly coupled with immunity. Critically, we constructed a multifactorial response network (MRN) to analyze the underlying interactions and compared the signatures affected by CoronaVac immunization and SARS-CoV-2 infection to further identify immune signatures and related metabolic pathways altered by CoronaVac immunization. These results suggest that protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2 can be achieved via multiple mechanisms and highlights the utility of a systems biology approach in defining molecular correlates of protection to vaccination.","Wang, Yi; Wang, Xiaoxia; Luu, Laurence Don Wai; Chen, Shaojin; Fu, Jin; Wang, Shufang; Huang, Xiaolan; Wang, Licheng; Zhou, Xiaocui; Chen, Xi; Cui, Xiaodai; Li, Jieqiong; Tai, Jun; Zhu, Xiong",,126,21

In this study, 57 fecal samples from dogs with diarrhea in Anhui Province, eastern China, were collected. Among these, five samples were identified to be infected with CaKoV, by polymerase chain reaction targeting the CaKoV 3D gene. The five CaKoV strains were subjected to phylogenetic analysis. The sequences of VP1 from the five CaKoV strains were 93.6%-96.1% identical to each other and 91.75%-97.95% identical to other reported CaKoV VP1 sequences. In addition, the complete genome of one strain was successfully amplified and sequenced. The genome consisted of 8223 nucleotides and shared 94.6%-97.0% nucleotide and 93.1%-94.0% amino acid sequence identity with other CaKoV isolates. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the CaKoV strain from Anhui Province was similar to other Chinese strains, and it was more closely related to feline and mouse kobuviruses than to sheep and bovine kobuviruses. Interestingly, all of the CaKoV-positive samples were coinfected with canine parvovirus. The finding of CaKoV infection in dogs with diarrhea and coinfection with canine parvovirus are a cause for concern and highlight the need for management and preventive measures.","Wang, Yong; Cui, Yongqiu; Li, Yeqiu; Wang, Xiaopeng; Yang, Kankan; Zhang, Da; Zhao, Liang; Bai, Caixia; Jiang, Shudong; Li, Yongdong",Arch. virol,126,16

The pandemic, which emerged in China and widespread all over the world, has no specific treatment till now. The reported antiviral activities of isoflavonoids encouraged us to find out its in silico anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity. In this work, molecular docking studies were carried out to investigate the interaction of fifty-nine isoflavonoids against hACE2 and viral Mpro. Several other in silico studies including physicochemical properties, ADMET and toxicity have been preceded. The results revealed that the examined isoflavonoids bound perfectly the hACE-2 with free binding energies ranging from -24.02 to -39.33 kcal mol-1, compared to the co-crystallized ligand (-21.39 kcal mol-1). Furthermore, such compounds bound the Mpro with unique binding modes showing free binding energies ranging from -32.19 to -50.79 kcal mol-1, comparing to the co-crystallized ligand (binding energy = -62.84 kcal mol-1). Compounds 33 and 56 showed the most acceptable affinities against hACE2. Compounds 30 and 53 showed the best docking results against Mpro.

More robust immune activation in women has been proposed to contribute to decreased disease severity, although systemic inflammation has been associated with worse outcomes in COVID-19 infection. Whether systemic inflammation contributes to sex differences in COVID-19 infection is not known. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We examined sex differences in inflammatory markers among 453 men (mean age 61) and 328 women (mean age 62) hospitalized with COVID-19 infection at the Massachusetts General Hospital from March 8 to April 27, 2020. Multivariable linear regression models were used to examine the association of sex with initial and peak inflammatory markers. Exploratory analyses examined the association of sex and inflammatory markers with 28-day clinical outcomes using multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS: Initial and peak CRP were higher in men compared with women after adjustment for baseline differences (initial CRP: ß 0.29, SE 0.07, p = 0.0001; peak CRP: ß 0.31, SE 0.07, p<0.0001) with similar findings for IL-6, PCT, and ferritin (p<0.05 for all). Men had greater than 1.5-greater odds of dying compared with women (OR 1.71, 95% CI 1.04-2.80, p = 0.03). Sex modified the association of peak CRP with both death and ICU admission, with stronger associations observed in men compared with women (death: OR 9.19, 95% CI 4.29-19.7, p <0.0001 in men vs OR 2.81, 95% CI 1.52-5.18, p = 0.009 in women, Pinteraction = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: In a sample of 781 men and women hospitalized with COVID-19 infection, men exhibited more robust inflammatory activation as evidenced by higher initial and peak inflammatory markers, as well as worse clinical outcomes. Better understanding of sex differences in immune responses to COVID-19 infection may shed light on the pathophysiology of COVID-19 infection.","Lau, Emily S; McNeill, Jenna N; Paniagua, Samantha M; Liu, Elizabeth E; Wang, Jessica K; Bassett, Ingrid V; Selvaggi, Caitlin A; Lubitz, Steven A; Foulkes, Andrea S; Ho, Jennifer E",PLoS One,126,16

In the first part, several liquid phase microextraction (LPME) and magnetic solid phase extraction (MSPE) methods were compared to each other in order to observe their extraction ability for the analyte. VA-SFDF-LPME method was selected as an efficient and easy extraction method due to its higher extraction efficiency. Optimization studies were carried out for the parameters such as extraction solvent type, sodium hydroxide volume/concentration, sample volume, spraying number and mixing type/period. Tukey's method based on post hoc test was applied to all experimental data for the selection of optimum values. Optimum extraction parameters were found to be 12 mL initial sample volume, two sprays of dichloromethane, 0.75 mL of 60 g/kg sodium hydroxide and 15 s vortex. Under the optimum conditions, limit of detection and quantification (LOD and LOQ) were calculated as 2.8 and 9.2 µg/kg, respectively. Detection power of the GC-MS system was increased by approximately 317 folds with the developed extraction/preconcentration method.

However, the study of asymptomatic patients is still rare, and the understanding of its potential transmission risk is still insufficient. In this study, epidemiological investigations were conducted in the Zhejiang province to understand the epidemiology and clinical characteristics of asymptomatic patients with COVID-19. Methods: This retrospective study was carried out on 22 asymptomatic patients and 234 symptomatic patients with COVID-19 who were hospitalized in Zhejiang Duodi Hospital from January 21 to March 16, 2020. The characteristics of epidemiology, demography, clinical manifestations, and laboratory data of mild patients were compared and analyzed. Results: The median age was 28 years in asymptomatic patients and 48 years in symptomatic patients. The proportion who were female was 77.3% in asymptomatic patients and 36.3% in symptomatic patients (p < 0.001). The proportion of patients with coexisting diseases was 4.5% in asymptomatic patients and 38.0% in symptomatic patients (p=0.002). The proportion of patients with increased CRP was 13.6% in the asymptomatic group and 61.1% in the symptomatic group (p < 0.001). The proportion of patients received antiviral therapy was 45.5% in the asymptomatic group and 97.9% in the symptomatic group (p < 0.001). The proportion of patients received oxygen therapy was 22.7% in the asymptomatic group and 99.1% in symptomatic patients (p < 0.001). By March 16, 2020, all patients were discharged from the hospital, and no symptoms had appeared in the asymptomatic patients during hospitalization. The median course of infection to discharge was 21.5 days in asymptomatic patients and 22 days in symptomatic patients. Conclusions: Asymptomatic patients are also infectious; relying only on clinical symptoms, blood cell tests, and radiology examination will lead to misdiagnosis of most patients, leading to the spread of the virus. Investigation of medical history is the best strategy for screening asymptomatic patients, especially young people, women, and people without coexisting disease, who are more likely to be asymptomatic when infected. Although the prognosis is good, isolation is critical for asymptomatic patients, and it is important not to end isolation early before a nucleic acid test turns negative.","Dai, Wei; Chen, Xinmiao; Xu, Xiaoting; Leng, Zhefeng; Yu, Wenwen; Lin, Hui; Li, Huiying; Lin, Jie; Qiu, Zhangwei; Dai, Yuanrong",Can Respir J,126,30

Methods: IgM and IgG antibody levels were assessed via chemiluminescence immunoassay in 338 COVID-19 patients. Results: IgM levels increased during the first week after SARS-CoV-2 infection, peaked 2 weeks and then reduced to near-background levels in most patients. IgG was detectable after 1 week and was maintained at a high level for a long period. The positive rates of IgM and/or IgG antibody detections were not significantly different among the mild, severe and critical disease groups. Severe and critical cases had higher IgM levels than mild cases, whereas the IgG level in critical cases was lower than those in both mild and severe cases. This might be because of the high disease activity and/or a compromised immune response in critical cases. The IgM antibody levels were slightly higher in deceased patients than recovered patients, but IgG levels in these groups did not significantly differ. A longitudinal detection of antibodies revealed that IgM levels decreased rapidly in recovered patients, whereas in deceased cases, either IgM levels remained high or both IgM and IgG were undetectable during the disease course. Conclusion: Quantitative detection of IgM and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 quantitatively has potential significance for evaluating the severity and prognosis of COVID-19.","Hou, Hongyan; Wang, Ting; Zhang, Bo; Luo, Ying; Mao, Lie; Wang, Feng; Wu, Shiji; Sun, Ziyong",Clin.

445203,445203,445203,Covid-19-Associated Pulmonary Aspergillosis: The Other Side of the Coin,16.98155,8.820211,2020,"Concentrations of the major ions (Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, K+, NH4+, Cl-, HCO3-, SO42- and NO3-), pH and electrical conductivity (EC) values in the rainwater (RW) samples at 16 stations in Syria were determined for characterizing the principal factors affecting the chemical composition of precipitation (P) in this country. Collection of the RW samples was made on a monthly basis during the period (1989-2006). The volume-weighted mean (VWM) values calculated for the different parameters at all stations show VWM values of 6.84 and 96 µS/cm for pH and EC, respectively. The ionic trend of the VWM concentrations (µeq/L) in the RW samples of entire dataset follows the descending order: Ca2+ &#8805; HCO3- > SO42- > Mg2+ > Cl- > Na+ > NO3- > K+ > NH4+. The lowest pH and EC values were found for the southern mountainous stations, while the highest were reported for the interior inland stations, depending on the amount of carbonate dust present in the atmosphere. The major part of the RW salinity (> 70%) was due to Ca2+, HCO3- and SO42- concentrations. The highest concentrations of Na+ and Cl- were found for the Tartous coastal station, where the Na+/Cl- ratio (0.84 ± 0.16) was remarkably very close to that of the Mediterranean Sea (MS) value (0.86), implying thus the sea spray effect. The highest NO3- concentrations (&#8776; 8-9 mg/L), with relatively high SO42-/NO3- ratios (> 2 ± 1), were found for the major cities (Damascus, Homs and Aleppo), implying hence the influence of intensive traffics and urban pollutions. The pH parameter was moderately linked with Ca2+ and HCO3- (R2 &#8776; 0.36), while EC was correlated with all ions, except NH4+. This later ion was weakly correlated with NO3- (R2 &#8776; 0.23). Strong correlations were found between Ca2+ and SO42- (R2 &#8776; 0.80) and between Cl- and Na+ (R2 &#8776; 0.95). Ca2+ and Mg2+ ions were the most responsible for neutralizing the RW acidity. The role of K+ and NH4+ as acidity neutralizers was small. By using the principal component analysis (PCA), five major factors, explaining &#8776; 87% of the total variance, were suggested for the possible sources affecting the chemical composition of RW in this country. The factors are (1) crustal natural materials, (2) sea salts, (3) fossil fuel combustion, (4) rural activity, and (5) biomass burning.","Kattan, Zuhair",,126,5

The data on stability of infectious SARS-CoV-2 on surfaces and in suspension have been put into perspective, as these inform the need for hygiene. We evaluated the efficacies of formulated microbicidal actives against alpha- and beta-coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2. The coronaviruses SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, human coronavirus 229E, murine hepatitis virus-1, or MERS-CoV were deposited on prototypic HITES or spiked into liquid matrices along with organic soil loads. Alcohol-, quaternary ammonium compound-, hydrochloric acid-, organic acid-, p-chloro-m-xylenol-, and sodium hypochlorite-based microbicidal formulations were evaluated per ASTM International and EN standard methodologies. All evaluated formulated microbicides inactivated SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses in suspension or on prototypic HITES. Virucidal efficacies (&#8805; 3 to &#8805; 6 log10 reduction) were displayed within 30 s to 5 min. The virucidal efficacy of a variety of commercially available formulated microbicides against SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses was confirmed. These microbicides should be useful for targeted surface and hand hygiene and disinfection of liquids, as part of infection prevention and control for SARS-CoV-2 and emerging mutational variants, and other emerging enveloped viruses.","Ijaz, M Khalid; Nims, Raymond W; Zhou, Sifang Steve; Whitehead, Kelly; Srinivasan, Vanita; Kapes, Tanya; Fanuel, Semhar; Epstein, Jonathan H; Daszak, Peter; Rubino, Joseph R; McKinney, Julie",Sci Rep,126,29

Research grant providers such as the European Union increasingly require open access publishing of research results and data. However, despite its significance to research, the adoption rate of open data technology remains low across all disciplines, especially in Europe where research has primarily focused on technical solutions (such as Zenodo or the Open Science Framework) or considered only parts of the issue. METHODS AND FINDINGS: In this study, we emphasized the non-technical factors perceived value and uncertainty factors in the context of academia, which impact researchers' acceptance of open data-the idea that researchers should not only publish their findings in the form of articles or reports, but also share the corresponding raw data sets. We present the results of a broad quantitative analysis including N = 995 researchers from 13 large to medium-sized universities in Germany. In order to test 11 hypotheses regarding researchers' intentions to share their data, as well as detect any hierarchical or disciplinary differences, we employed a structured equation model (SEM) following the partial least squares (PLS) modeling approach. CONCLUSIONS: Grounded in the value-based theory, this article proclaims that most individuals in academia embrace open data when the perceived advantages outweigh the disadvantages. Furthermore, uncertainty factors impact the perceived value (consisting of the perceived advantages and disadvantages) of sharing research data. We found that researchers' assumptions about effort required during the data preparation process were diminished by awareness of e-science technologies (such as Zenodo or the Open Science Framework), which also increased their tendency to perceive personal benefits via data exchange. Uncertainty factors seem to influence the intention to share data. Effects differ between disciplines and hierarchical levels.","Stieglitz, Stefan; Wilms, Konstantin; Mirbabaie, Milad; Hofeditz, Lennart; Brenger, Bela; López, Ania; Rehwald, Stephanie",PLoS One,126,0

METHODS: We conducted a systematic research of the literature, collecting data regarding the evidence on tumor degeneration from AWE after CS. Moreover, we reported a case of clear cell borderline tumor (CCBT) originating from AWE. RESULTS: We included data of 37 patients with diagnosis of CCC. The average time between the last CS and the diagnosis of CCC was around 15 years. Overall, 26.0% and 73.9% patients received exclusive local abdominal resection of the lesion and additional surgery, respectively. Lymph nodes involvement was detected in 26.0 % patients and adjuvant chemotherapy was administered in 52.0 % cases. During follow-up period, 15.2% patients died of disease, 32.6% had no evidence of disease, and 17.4% recurred. We diagnosed a CCBT arose in a patients with AWE and a personal history of several surgical procedures for endometriosis, a CS and a subsequent transverse laparotomy. We performed an open bilateral ovariectomy and a large excision of the endometriotic abdominal lesion. CONCLUSION: Tumor degeneration from AWE seems to be a real occurrence with an increasing number of events. Considering the lack of risk factors and diagnostic instruments for tumor degeneration, the removal of AWE localization could be advisable, even though there was long average time between the trigger surgery and the tumor finding.","Ferrari, Federico; Valenti, Gaetano; Forte, Sara; Ardighieri, Laura; Iraci Sareri, Marco; Barra, Fabio; Sartori, Enrico; Odicino, Franco",J Obstet Gynaecol Res,126,16

The recurrent spreading of CoVs imposes an ongoing threat to global health and the economy. Since no specific therapy for these CoVs is available, any beneficial approach (including nutritional and dietary approach) is worth investigation. Based on recent advances in nutrients and phytonutrients research, a novel combination of vitamin C, curcumin and glycyrrhizic acid (VCG Plus) was developed that has potential against CoV infection. System biology tools were applied to explore the potential of VCG Plus in modulating targets and pathways relevant to immune and inflammation responses. Gene target acquisition, gene ontology and Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment were conducted consecutively along with network analysis. The results show that VCG Plus can act on 88 hub targets which are closely connected and associated with immune and inflammatory responses. Specifically, VCG Plus has the potential to regulate innate immune response by acting on NOD-like and Toll-like signaling pathways to promote interferons production, activate and balance T-cells, and regulate the inflammatory response by inhibiting PI3K/AKT, NF-&#954;B and MAPK signaling pathways. All these biological processes and pathways have been well documented in CoV infections studies. Therefore, our findings suggest that VCG Plus may be helpful in regulating immune response to combat CoV infections and inhibit excessive inflammatory responses to prevent the onset of cytokine storm. However, further in vitro and in vivo experiments are warranted to validate the current findings with system biology tools. Our current approach provides a new strategy in predicting formulation rationale when developing new dietary supplements.","Chen, Liang; Hu, Chun; Hood, Molly; Zhang, Xue; Zhang, Lu; Kan, Juntao; Du, Jun",Nutrients,126,22

Despite the large number of nurses in practice, a variety of factors contribute to the availability of RNs able to meet health care-related demands, leading out-of-practice nurses to seek reentry into the workforce. To develop the skills and knowledge needed to deliver safe and effective care, nurses seeking to return to practice need access to formally structured continuing education opportunities. Nursing refresher courses have historically filled this gap, effectively supporting the reemployment of nurses by preparing them for clinical practice. The COVID-19 pandemic is among the most recent factors encouraging nurse reentry, thus furthering the need for continuing education in support of license renewal. This article provides insight into the development of a university-based refresher program for Texas nurses seeking to reactivate licensure and gain the theoretical and clinical knowledge needed to return to nursing considering the health care demands produced by this unprecedented crisis.

This study aimed to evaluate if and how child and adolescent psychiatric visits to hospital emergency departments (EDs) changed during the pandemic lockdown, which started in Italy on February 24, 2020. METHODS: We examined all ED visits by patients under 18 years of age in the 7 weeks prior to February 24, 2020, and in the subsequent 8 weeks of COVID-19 lockdown at two urban university hospitals, in Turin and Rome, Italy. ED visits during the corresponding periods of 2019 served as a comparison using Poisson regression modeling. The clinician's decision to hospitalize or discharge home the patient after the ED visit was examined as an index of clinical severity. RESULTS: During the COVID-19 lockdown, there was a 72.0% decrease in the number of all pediatric ED visits (3,395) compared with the corresponding period in 2019 (12,128), with a 46.2% decrease in psychiatric visits (50 vs 93). The mean age of psychiatric patients was higher in the COVID-19 period (15.7 vs 14.1 years). No significant changes were found in hospitalization rate or in the prevalence distribution of the primary reason for the psychiatric ED visit (suicidality, anxiety/mood disorders, agitation). CONCLUSIONS: In the first 8 weeks of the COVID-19-induced social lockdown, the number of child and adolescent psychiatric ED visits significantly decreased, with an increase in patient age. This decrease does not appear to be explained by severity-driven self-selection and might be due to a reduction in psychiatric emergencies or to the implementation of alternative ways of managing acute psychopathology.","Davico, Chiara; Marcotulli, Daniele; Lux, Caterina; Calderoni, Dario; Cammisa, Luca; Bondone, Claudia; Rosa-Brusin, Martina; Secci, Ilaria; Porro, Marzia; Campanile, Roberta; Bosia, Chiara; Di Santo, Federica; Terrinoni, Arianna; Ricci, Federica; Amianto, Federico; Urbino, Antonio; Ferrara, Mauro; Vitiello, Benedetto",J. clin. psychiatr,126,14

Therefore, there is an urgent need for automatic semantic indexing models which can effectively scale-up to newly introduced concepts and rapidly evolving distributions of the hyperfocused related literature. In this research, we present a novel semantic indexing approach based on the state-of-the-art self-supervised representation learning and transformer encoding exclusively suitable for pandemic crises. We present a case study on a novel dataset that is based on COVID-19 papers published and manually indexed in PubMed. Our study shows that our self-supervised model outperforms the best performing models of BioASQ Task 8a by micro-F1 score of 0.1 and LCA-F score of 0.08 on average. Our model also shows superior performance on detecting the supplementary concepts which is quite important when the focus of the literature has drastically shifted towards specific concepts related to the pandemic. Our study sheds light on the main challenges confronting semantic indexing models during a pandemic, namely new domains and drastic changes of their distributions, and as a superior alternative for such situations, propose a model founded on approaches which have shown auspicious performance in improving generalization and data efficiency in various NLP tasks.

Methods: A retrospective cohort study was carried out to analyze the clinical data of selective endoscopy performed at the Endoscopic Center, Zhongshan Hospital of Fudan University from February 20 to March 6, 2020. Clinical data included epidemiological questionnaire, chief complaints, endoscopic findings and biopsy pathology results, etc. All medical staff had blood test for IgM/IgG antibodies of COVID-19. Patients and their families were followed up by phone to determine whether they were infected with COVID-19. Meanwhile, the clinical data of selective endoscopy during the same period from February 20 to March 6, 2019 were collected as the control group to compare the overall results of endoscopy examinations during the epidemic and the detection rate of GI malignancy. Results: A total of 911 patients underwent endoscopy in the epidemic period group, and a total of 5746 cases in the control group, which was 6.3 times over the epidemic period group. In the epidemic period group, 544 cases received gastroscopy and 367 cases received colonoscopy, while 3433 cases received gastroscopy and 2313 cases received colonoscopy in the control group, which were both 6.3 times of epidemic period group. Gastroscopy revealed that 39 patients (7.2%) were diagnosed with upper GI malignancies in the epidemic period group and 77 patients (2.2%) in the control group with significant difference (&#967;(2)=40.243, P<0.001). The detection rate of gastric cancer in these two groups was 3.3% (n=18) and 1.7% (n=59) respectively with significant difference (&#967;(2)=6.254,P=0.012). The detection rate of esophageal cancer was 3.7% (n=20) and 0.5% (n=18) respectively with significant difference (&#967;(2)=49.303,P<0.001). Colonoscopy revealed that colorectal cancer was found in 32 cases (8.7%) of the epidemic period group and 88 cases (3.8%) of the control group with significant difference (&#967;(2)=17.888, P<0.001). During the epidemic period, no infection of medical staff was found through the blood test of IgM/IgG antibodies on COVID-19. No patient and family members were infected with COVID-19 by phone follow-up. Conclusion: Compared with the same period in 2019, the number of selective endoscopy decreases sharply during the epidemic period, while the detection rate of various GI malignant tumors increases significantly, which indicates that patients with high-risk symptoms of GI malignancies should still receive endoscopy as soon as possible. Provided strict adherence to the epidemic prevention standards formulated by the state and professional societies, it is necessary to carry out clinical diagnosis and treatment as soon as possible.","Zhu, L; Cai, M Y; Shi, Q; Wang, P; Li, Q L; Zhong, Y S; Yao, L Q; Zhou, P H",Zhonghua Wei Chang Wai Ke Za Zhi,126,28

C. elegans thermosensory neurons alleviate lifespan-shortening effects of high temperatures via sterol endocrine signaling and probably through systemic regulation of cytosolic proteostasis. At low temperatures, C. elegans displays a long lifespan by upregulating the cold-sensing TRPA channel, lipid homeostasis, germline-mediated prostaglandin signaling, and autophagy. In addition, co-chaperone p23 amplifies lifespan changes affected by high and low temperatures.

Since its outbreak, SARS-CoV-2 has had a major impact on clinical diagnostic laboratories. The scientific community has quickly risen to the occasion and reports of new developments have arrived at an unprecedented scale. At present, there is a growing list of over 400 SARC-CoV-2 diagnostic tests either in development or approved for clinical use. This presentation reviews the current laboratory methods available for testing COVID- 19 in microbiology laboratories and also provides an insight into the future diagnostics approaches. METHODS: Proper respiratory specimen collected at the appropriate time and from the right anatomical site is critical in the accurate and timely diagnosis of SARSCoV2. While oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal swabs are recommended for the detection of early infection, other lower respiratory tract specimens like the sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage are used for late detection and monitoring of patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Real-time RT-PCR based molecular assay remains the test of choice for the etiological diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 while serological tests are being introduced as supplementary tools. Finally, there is an urgent need for scaling up the diagnostic capacity by the introduction of reliable and accurate point-of-care tests which will assist in effective control of this outbreak.

Recent data were reviewed between January 1, 2019 and March 20, 2021 by searching English language manuscripts for studies documenting clinical outcomes in HIV care and the patient experience. A PubMed, Google Scholar, and bibliography review based on the search terms ""HIV,"" ""telemedicine,"" and ""telehealth"" was conducted. Studies included in this analysis were comprised of adult patients living with HIV, receiving care for HIV via telemedicine with reported clinical outcomes or perceptions of using telemedicine in the management of their HIV care. Of the 179 studies identified, 12 met inclusion for this analysis. Only two studies provided data on clinical outcomes of HIV (virologic outcomes), one pre-pandemic and one during COVID-19. The study evaluating viral suppression during COVID-19 demonstrated lower rates of virologic suppression and lower rates of missed appointments when shelter-in-place orders were issued compared to before the start of the pandemic. The remaining studies focused on patient-related outcomes as they related to the usability and adoption of telehealth models. Many practices documented the benefits and limitations of telemedicine based on the rapid switch from traditional in-person clinics. Benefits included retention in care for patients who lived a far distance from clinic, privacy for patients not wanting to be seen attending an HIV clinic, and more flexibility in scheduling appointments. Some limitations included patients' access to technology, ability and willingness to use technology, and privacy of patients who are homeless and reside in a shelter where homelessness is 3 times greater in people living with HIV compared to the general population. Healthcare should be tailored to the individual patient by assessing their needs and limitations, particularly with patients who may be at risk for discontinuation of care, particularly in the homeless population. In addition, there are mixed data on factors such as age, sex, and race being limiting factors in willingness to use technology. From the studies reviewed, willingness to engage with technology did not differ by age, sex, or race but did differ by access and willingness to use technology. Greater limitations were access to appropriate devices for telemedicine and digital literacy. Although there have been difficulties with the switch to telemedicine in clinics during the COVID-19 pandemic, many patients have reported being satisfied with care and would be interested in continuing once the shelter-in-place order is lifted. Future studies should focus on the provision of HIV care using telemedicine beyond the pandemic and focus on ways to improve the telemedicine experience for the patient.","Smith, E.; Badowski, M.

In social media and scientific journals, some wrong references were given to a ""normal epidemic curve"" and also to a ""log-normal curve/distribution"". For many years, textbooks and courses of reputable institutions and scientific journals have disseminated misleading concepts. For example, calling histogram to plots of epidemic curves or using epidemic data to introduce the concept of a Gaussian distribution, ignoring its temporal indexing. Although an epidemic curve may look like a Gaussian curve and be eventually modelled by a Gauss function, it is not a normal distribution or a log-normal, as some authors claim. A pandemic produces highly-complex data and to tackle it effectively statistical and mathematical modelling need to go beyond the ""one-size-fits-all solution"". Classical textbooks need to be updated since pandemics happen and epidemiology needs to provide reliable information to policy recommendations and actions.","Gonçalves, Luzia; Turkman, Maria Antónia Amaral; Geraldes, Carlos; Marques, Tiago A; Sousa, Lisete",Journal of epidemiology and global health (Online),126,20

The aim of this study is to compare rates of Do-Not-Attempt CPR (DNACPR) documentation in older hospitalised patients before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This was a retrospective repeated cross-sectional study. Data including co-morbidities and resuscitation status was collected on 300 patients with COVID-19 hospitalised from March 1st to May 31s t 2020. DNACPR documentation rates in patients aged &#8805;65 years with a diagnosis of COVID-19 were compared to those without COVID-19 admitted during the same period and also compared to documentation rates pre-COVID-19 pandemic (March 1st to May 31s t 2019). RESULTS: Of 300 COVID-19-positive patients, 28% had a DNACPR order documented during their admission. Of 131 older (&#8805;65 years) patients with COVID-19, 60.3% had a DNACPR order compared to 25.4% of 130 older patients without COVID-19 (p < 0.0001). During a comparable time period pre-pandemic, 15.4% of 130 older patients had a DNACPR order in place (p < 0.0001). Fifty percent of DNACPR orders were recorded within 24 hours of a positive swab result for SARS-CoV-2. Of older COVID-19-positive patients, 39.2% were referred to palliative care services and 70.2% survived. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has prompted more widespread and earlier decision-making regarding resuscitation status. Although case-fatality-rates were higher for older hospitalised patients with COVID-19, many older patients survived the illness. Advance care planning should be prioritised in all patients and should remain good clinical practice despite the pandemic.","Connellan, D; Diffley, K; McCabe, J; Cotter, A; McGinty, T; Sheehan, G; Ryan, K; Cullen, W; Lambert, J S; Callaly, E L; Kyne, L",Age ageing,126,17

It is suggested that leptin could be the missing link between obesity and severe COVID-19. Our study aimed to unravel the link between adipokines, COVID-19 status, immune response, and outcomes in severe pneumonia. METHODS: In this prospective observational single-center study, 63 immunocompetent patients with severe pneumonia (36 non-COVID-19 and 27 COVID-19) were enrolled, most required intensive care. Clinical and biological characteristics (glucose metabolism, plasma adipokines, and cytokine concentrations) and outcomes were compared. RESULTS: At similar baseline severity, COVID-19 patients required mechanical ventilation for significantly longer than non-COVID-19 patients (p = 0.0049). Plasma concentrations of leptin and adiponectin were respectively positively and negatively correlated with BMI and glucose metabolism (glycemia and insulinemia), but not significantly different between the two groups. Leptin levels were negatively correlated with IL-1ß and IL-6, but the adipokines were not correlated with most other inflammatory mediators, baseline severity (SOFA score), or the duration of mechanical ventilation. CONCLUSION: Adipokine levels were correlated with BMI but not with most inflammatory mediators, severity, or outcomes in severe pneumonia, regardless of the origin. The link between obesity, dysregulated immune response, and life-threatening COVID-19 requires further investigation.

Prone positioning has been used successfully in adult patients with ARDS and has been shown to decrease mortality. The efficacy of prone positioning in pediatric ARDS is less clear. In this review, we discuss the physiologic principles and literature on prone positioning in adults and children relative to COVID-19. RECENT FINDINGS: There are limited published data on prone positioning in respiratory failure because of COVID-19. The use of proning in nonintubated patients with COVID-19 may improve oxygenation and dyspnea but has not been associated with improved outcomes. Initial adult cohort studies of intubated patients undergoing prone positioning in severe ARDS related to COVID-19 have shown an improvement in mortality. Although the use of proning in children with severe COVID-19 is recommended, data supporting its use is scarce. SUMMARY: Additional studies to evaluate the efficacy of prone positioning in pediatric ARDS are needed to provide evidence for or against this treatment strategy in children. Given the unknown evolution of this pandemic, collaborative research efforts across pediatric centers provides the greatest opportunity to develop a data driven-approach to make use of this potential therapy.","Leroue, Matthew K; Maddux, Aline B; Mourani, Peter M",Curr Opin Pediatr,126,16

Unfortunately, current facility-based testing compounds shortcomings in testing availability, neglecting those who are frail or physically unable to travel to a testing facility. METHODS: We developed an emergency medical service (EMS)-based home testing and evaluation program, leveraging existing community EMS resources. This program has kept vulnerable populations out of the emergency department, reduced cost, and improved access to care. RESULTS: Our EMS-based testing program can test approximately 15 homebound patients per day. Through April 2020 our program had performed 477 home-based tests. Additionally, we have recently undertaken several mass testing operations, testing up to 900 patients per testing site. CONCLUSION: Facility-based SARS-CoV-2 testing requires that a patient physically present to a facility for a nasopharyngeal swap to be collected. Unfortunately, access may be limited for patients that are homebound, chronically ill, or without a means of private transportation. By leveraging existing EMS infrastructure in new ways, our community has been able to keep almost 500 vulnerable patients in their home. Using EMS, we can strengthen the healthcare system's response to the evolving COVID-19 pandemic and support at-risk populations, including those that are underserved, homebound, and frail.","Goldberg, Scott A; Bonacci, Robert A; Carlson, Lucas C; Pu, Charles T; Ritchie, Christine S",West J Emerg Med,126,24

However, the impact of obesity on clinical outcomes including mortality in COVID-19 has been poorly systematically investigated until now. We aimed to compare clinical outcomes among COVID-19 patients divided into three groups according to the body mass index (BMI). METHODS: We retrospectively collected data up to May 31st, 2020. 3635 patients were divided into three groups of BMI (<25 kg/m2; n = 1110, 25-30 kg/m2; n = 1464, and >30 kg/m2; n = 1061). Demographic, in-hospital complications, and predictors for mortality, respiratory insufficiency, and sepsis were analyzed. RESULTS: The rate of respiratory insufficiency was more recorded in BMI 25-30 kg/m2 as compared to BMI < 25 kg/m2 (22.8% vs. 41.8%; p < 0.001), and in BMI > 30 kg/m2 than BMI < 25 kg/m2, respectively (22.8% vs. 35.4%; p < 0.001). Sepsis was more observed in BMI 25-30 kg/m2 and BMI > 30 kg/m2 as compared to BMI < 25 kg/m2, respectively (25.1% vs. 42.5%; p = 0.02) and (25.1% vs. 32.5%; p = 0.006). The mortality rate was higher in BMI 25-30 kg/m2 and BMI > 30 kg/m2 as compared to BMI < 25 kg/m2, respectively (27.2% vs. 39.2%; p = 0.31) (27.2% vs. 33.5%; p = 0.004). In the Cox multivariate analysis for mortality, BMI < 25 kg/m2 and BMI > 30 kg/m2 did not impact the mortality rate (HR 1.15, 95% CI: 0.889-1.508; p = 0.27) (HR 1.15, 95% CI: 0.893-1.479; p = 0.27).

We compared cases identified through symptomatic surveillance and contact tracing, and estimated the time from symptom onset to confirmation, isolation, and admission to hospital. We estimated metrics of disease transmission and analysed factors influencing transmission risk. FINDINGS: Cases were older than the general population (mean age 45 years) and balanced between males (n=187) and females (n=204). 356 (91%) of 391 cases had mild or moderate clinical severity at initial assessment. As of Feb 22, 2020, three cases had died and 225 had recovered (median time to recovery 21 days; 95% CI 20-22). Cases were isolated on average 4·6 days (95% CI 4·1-5·0) after developing symptoms; contact tracing reduced this by 1·9 days (95% CI 1·1-2·7). Household contacts and those travelling with a case were at higher risk of infection (odds ratio 6·27 [95% CI 1·49-26·33] for household contacts and 7·06 [1·43-34·91] for those travelling with a case) than other close contacts. The household secondary attack rate was 11·2% (95% CI 9·1-13·8), and children were as likely to be infected as adults (infection rate 7·4% in children <10 years vs population average of 6·6%). The observed reproductive number (R) was 0·4 (95% CI 0·3-0·5), with a mean serial interval of 6·3 days (95% CI 5·2-7·6). INTERPRETATION: Our data on cases as well as their infected and uninfected close contacts provide key insights into the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2. This analysis shows that isolation and contact tracing reduce the time during which cases are infectious in the community, thereby reducing the R. The overall impact of isolation and contact tracing, however, is uncertain and highly dependent on the number of asymptomatic cases. Moreover, children are at a similar risk of infection to the general population, although less likely to have severe symptoms; hence they should be considered in analyses of transmission and control.

However, to date, there have been no published articles on how conducting TA virtually may impact the process and experience. The COVID-19 global pandemic led to a rapid increase in virtual delivery of psychological services, including assessments. Assessors adapted procedures to ensure that clients were served ethically, the assessor-client relationship was considered, and the results were deemed valid. This empirical case study was conducted to evaluate test validity, therapeutic alliance, and the clinician's and client's experience of a TA conducted virtually. The validity of test administration was evaluated by experts, who reviewed video of the administration and test results; no concerns regarding integrity and interpretability of the results were identified. Therapeutic alliance, session process, and virtual presence were measured after each session. Both clinician and client reported positive experiences. The overall impact of the TA was evaluated through quantitative assessment of the client's experience and qualitative analysis of interviews. Collectively, this research demonstrates the feasibility of conducting a TA virtually, in an efficacious manner, that leads to positive client outcomes.","David, Raja M; Carroll, Allison J; Smith, Justin D",J Pers Assess,126,16

For this purpose a special class of branching processes with two types of individuals is considered. These models are intended to use only the observed daily statistics to estimate the main parameter of the infection and to give a prediction of the mean value of the non-observed population of the infected individuals. Similar problems are considered also in the case when the processes admit an immigration component. This is a serious advantage in comparison with other more complicated models where the officially reported data are not sufficient for estimation of the model parameters.

In the absence of effective treatments, it is necessary to search for new therapies and therapeutic targets. Platelets play a fundamental role in respiratory disorders resulting from viral infections, being the first line of defense against viruses and essential in maintaining lung function. The direct application of platelet lysate (PL) obtained from the platelet-rich plasma of healthy donors could help in the improvement of the patient due its anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, antifibrotic, and repairing effects. This work evaluates PL nebulization by analyzing its levels of growth factors and its biological activity on lung fibroblast cell cultures, besides describing a scientific basis for its use in this kind of pathology. The data of the work suggest that the molecular levels and biological activity of the PL are maintained after nebulization. Airway administration would allow acting directly on the lung tissue modulating inflammation and stimulating reparative processes on key structures such as the alveolocapillary barrier, improving the disease and sequels. The protocol developed in this work is a first step for the study of nebulized PL both in animal experimentation and in clinical trials.","Beitia, Maider; Delgado, Diego; Sánchez, Pello; Vallejo de la Cueva, Ana; Cugat, José Ramón; Sánchez, Mikel",Int. j. mol. sci.

Aims: We investigated how the COVID-19 pandemic influenced surveillance for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), focusing on patients with hepatitis C virus infection who were receiving surveillance for HCC after sustained virologic response (SVR) in Japan. Methods: Patients who achieved SVR between 1995 and 2017 and continued receiving surveillance were compared by month in terms of the rate at which they kept their scheduled visits for HCC surveillance from July 2019 to May 2020. Results: The percentage of kept scheduled visits was above 97% before February 2020. By contrast, it declined sharply after March 2020 when COVID-19 became pandemic; the percentages were 75.5% in March, 63.0% in April, and 49.1% in May 2020 (July 2019-February 2020 vs. March-May 2020, p<0.0001). Similar declines were observed in patients with cirrhosis or advanced fibrosis and in those with a history of HCC. Whereas most patients who cancelled a scheduled visit before February 2020 did not reschedule it, the majority of patients with cancellations after March 2020 did want to reschedule. Conclusions: The percentages of scheduled visits that were kept declined rapidly after COVID-19 became pandemic in Japan, where the spread of COVID-19 is relatively mild and the legal restriction of people's behavior and movement is absent. Instituting measures to follow-up with cancelled patients and resume surveillance will be necessary in the future.","Toyoda, Hidenori; Yasuda, Satoshi; Kiriyama, Seiki; Tanikawa, Makoto; Hisanaga, Yasuhiro; Kanamori, Akira; Kitabatake, Shusuke; Yamamoto, Satoshi; Shiota, Shohei; Furoi, Manabu; Koyabu, Takahiro; Furukawa, Daiju; Kumada, Takashi; Sumida, Yoshio",,126,16

Several trials have correlated poor oral hygiene with hyper-inflammation. Similarly, COVID-19 severity has been linked to hyper-inflammatory responses. Hence, in this study, we assumed that increased COVID-19 severity may be linked to poor oral health status. This was achieved through assessing oral health status, severity of COVID-19 symptoms, C-reactive protein (CRP) levels and duration of recovery.Methods Cross-sectional study based on a questionnaire; 308 Egyptian patients with confirmed positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests were included in the study after exclusion criteria. The questionnaire was designed with two sections: the first section for oral health evaluation and the second section for COVID-19 severity evaluation. Assessment of the effect of oral health on COVID-19 severity was performed using an oral health score. The effect of oral health on CRP and recovery period were evaluated as secondary endpoints. Data of CRP levels and COVID-19 PCR tests were collected via the questionnaire and confirmed by reviewing medical records.Results The correlation between oral health and COVID-19 severity showed a significant inverse correlation (p <0.001, r = -0.512). Moreover, the correlation between oral health with recovery period and CRP values also revealed a significant inverse correlation (p <0.001, -0.449 and p <0.001, -0.190, respectively), showing that poor oral health was correlated to increased values of CRP and delayed recovery period.Conclusions Our study provided some evidence that oral health could have a potential impact on the severity of COVID-19. However, the correlation is limited by the study design. A more substantial research project is required to address this relation.","Kamel, Amany Hany Mohamed; Basuoni, Ahmed; Salem, Zeinab A; AbuBakr, Nermeen",Br. dent. j,126,16

METHODS: From mid-January to March 2020, we extracted publicly available data regarding the spread and control of COVID-19 from 31 provincial health authorities and major media outlets in mainland China. Based on these data, we conducted descriptive analyses of the epidemic in the six most-affected provinces. RESULTS: School closures, travel restrictions, community-level lockdown, and contact tracing were introduced concurrently around late January but subsequent epidemic trends differed among provinces. Compared with Hubei, the other five most-affected provinces reported a lower crude case fatality ratio and proportion of critical and severe hospitalised cases. From March 2020, as the local transmission of COVID-19 declined, switching the focus of measures to the testing and quarantine of inbound travellers may have helped to sustain the control of the epidemic.

OBJECTIVES: To compare the immunopathology of COVID-19 acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) to that of non-COVID-19 ARDS, and to identify biomarkers associated with mortality in patients with COVID-19 ARDS. METHODS: Prospective observational monocenter study. Immunocompetent patients diagnosed with RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and ARDS admitted between March 8 and March 30, 2020 were included and compared with patients with non-COVID-19 ARDS. The primary clinical endpoint of the study was mortality at day 28. Flow cytometry analyses and serum cytokines measurements were performed at days 1-2 and 4-6 of ICU admission. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: As compared with patients with non-COVID-19 ARDS (n=36), those with COVID-19 (n=38) were not significantly different regarding age, gender, and SOFA and SAPS II scores but exhibited a higher day-28 mortality (34% vs 11%, p=0.030). COVID-19 patients showed profound and sustained T CD4+ (p=0.002), CD8+ (p<0.0001) and B (p<0.0001) lymphopenia, higher HLA-DR expression on monocytes (p<0.001) and higher serum concentrations of EGF, GM-CSF, IL-10, CCL2/MCP-1, CCL3/MIP-1a, CXCL10/IP-10, CCL5/RANTES, and CCL20/MIP-3a. After adjusting on age and SOFA, serum CXCL10/IP-10 (p=0.047) and GM-CSF (p=0.050) were higher and naso-pharyngeal RT-PCR cycle threshold values lower (p=0.010) in COVID-19 patients who were dead at day-28. CONCLUSIONS: Profound global lymphopenia and a ""chemokine signature"" were observed in COVID-19 ARDS. Increased serum concentrations of CXCL10/IP-10 and GM-CSF, together with higher naso-pharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 viral load, were associated with day-28 mortality.

Since, no specific antiviral drug is proven effective for treatment against COVID-19, identification of new therapeutics is an urgent need. In this study, flavonoid compounds were analyzed for its inhibitory potential against important protein targets of SARS-CoV-2 using computational approaches. Virtual docking was performed for screening of flavonoid compounds retrieved from PubChem against the main protease of SARS-CoV-2 using COVID-19 docking server. The cut off of dock score was set to >-9kcal/mol and screened compounds were individually docked against main protease, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, and spike proteins using AutoDock 4.1 software. Finally, lead flavonoid compounds were subjected to ADMET analysis. A total of 458 flavonoid compounds were virtually screened against main protease target and 36 compounds were selected based on the interaction energy value >-9kcal/mol. Furthermore, these compounds were individually docked against protein targets and top 10 lead compounds were identified. Among the lead compounds, agathisflavone showed highest binding energy value of -8.4 kcal/mol against main protease, Albireodelphin showed highest dock score of -9.8 kcal/mol and -11.2 kcal/mol against RdRp, and spike proteins, respectively. Based on the high dock score and ADMET properties, top 5 lead molecules such as Albireodelphin, Apigenin 7-(6''-malonylglucoside), Cyanidin-3-(p-coumaroyl)-rutinoside-5-glucoside, Delphinidin 3-O-beta-D-glucoside 5-O-(6-coumaroyl-beta-D-glucoside) and (-)-Maackiain-3-O-glucosyl-6''-O-malonate were identified as potent inhibitors against main protease, RdRp, and spike protein targets of SARS-CoV-2. These all compounds are having non-carcinogenic and non-mutagenic properties.This study finding suggests that the screened compounds include Albireodelphin, Apigenin 7-(6''-malonylglucoside), Cyanidin-3-(p-coumaroyl)-rutinoside-5-glucoside, Delphinidin 3-O-beta-D-glucoside 5-O-(6-coumaroyl-beta-D-glucoside) and (-)-Maackiain-3-O-glucosyl-6''-O-malonate could be the potent inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 targets.","Ragavan Rameshkumar, Marimuthu; Indu, Purushothaman; Arunagirinathan, Narasingam; Venkatadri, Babu; El-Serehy, Hamed A; Ahmad, Ajaz",,126,29

Hence, ways of perceiving multiple connections and complexity are fundamental when seeking to describe, understand and address concerns and questions related to change. PROPOSAL: In response to calls in the literature, we introduce three examples of contemporary organisational theory which can be used to understand and operationalise change within medical education. These theories, institutional logics, paradox theory and complexity leadership theory, respectively, are relatively unknown in medical education. However, they provide a way of making sense of the complexity of change creatively. Specifically, they cross-cut different levels of analysis and allow us to 'zoom in' to micro levels, as well as to 'zoom out' and connect what is happening at the individual level (the micro level) to what happens at a wider institutional and even national or international level (the macro level), thereby providing a means of understanding the interactions among individuals, teams, organisations and systems. We highlight the potential value of these theories, provide a brief discussion of the few studies that have used them in medical education, and then briefly critique each theory. CONCLUSIONS: We hope that by drawing the attention of readers to the potential of these management theories, we can unlock some of the complexity of change in medical education, support new ways of thinking and open new avenues for research.","Gordon, Lisi; Cleland, Jennifer A",Med. educ,126,23

The protocol was registered with the Open Science Framework (DOI: 10.17605/OSF.IO/34ZAV).Results: In total, 18 studies comprising 114 pregnant women were included in the review. Fever (87.5%) and cough (53.8%) were the most commonly reported symptoms, followed by fatigue (22.5%), diarrhea (8.8%), dyspnea (11.3%), sore throat (7.5%), and myalgia (16.3%). The majority of patients (91%) had cesarean delivery due to various indications. In terms of fetal and neonatal outcomes, stillbirth (1.2%), neonatal death (1.2%), preterm birth (21.3%), low birth weight (<2500 g, 5.3%), fetal distress (10.7%), and neonatal asphyxia (1.2%) were reported. There are reports of neonatal infection, but no direct evidence of intrauterine vertical transmission has been found.Conclusions: The clinical characteristics of pregnant women with COVID-19 are similar to those of non-pregnant adults. Fetal and neonatal outcomes appear good in most cases, but available data only include pregnant women infected in their third trimesters. Further studies are needed to ascertain long-term outcomes and potential intrauterine vertical transmission.","Yang, Ziyi; Wang, Min; Zhu, Ziyu; Liu, Yi",J Matern Fetal Neonatal Med,126,33

We describe a case of a middle-aged COVID-19-positive man who presented with pulmonary oedema and acute respiratory failure. He was initially diagnosed with acute respiratory distress syndrome. Later in the hospital course, his pulmonary oedema and respiratory failure worsened as result of severe acute mitral valve regurgitation secondary to direct valvular damage from COVID-19 infection. The patient underwent emergent surgical mitral valve replacement. Pathological evaluation of the damaged valve was confirmed to be secondary to COVID-19 infection. The histopathological findings were consistent with prior cardiopulmonary autopsy sections of patients with COVID-19 described in the literature as well as proposed theories regarding ACE2 receptor activity. This case highlights the potential of SARS-CoV-2 causing direct mitral valve damage resulting in severe mitral valve insufficiency with subsequent pulmonary oedema and respiratory failure.","Khanduri, Ayesha; Anand, Usha; Doss, Maged; Lovett, Louis",BMJ case reports,126,23

Apart from death because of coronavirus infection, the pandemic brought unbearable psychological pressure to all. We assessed the psychological pressure on college and university students in India through cluster sampling. Methods: The students responded (n = 209) to an online questionnaire following the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7) and Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) with some other basic information. Results: According to GAD-7 scoring, we found the respondent students had severe anxiety (1.44%), moderately severe anxiety (14.35%), moderate anxiety (36.36%) and mild anxiety (47.85%). Following HAM-A scoring, anxiety level among the students could be scaled as severe (0.96%), high (4.31%), moderate (13.40%) and mild anxiety (34.93%) level. Age of the students was a confounding factor (p = 0.049, HAM-A) of experiencing anxiety, students <20 years of age were more anxious. We found female students to be more anxious than the males following the HAM-A scoring tool. Academic delays (R2 = 0.996, p = 0.036) and impact on daily life (R2 = 0.996, p = 0.117) were positively associated with anxiety symptoms, while social support was marginally correlated (R2 = 0.726, p = 0.069) with the anxiety level. Conclusions: As the study found almost all the students are experiencing anxiety because of the current pandemic situation, continuous observation of psychological health for all is recommended as well as establishing psychological intervention during the preparedness phase.","Biswas, Saroni; Biswas, Anirban",Z Gesundh Wiss,126,1

Initiatives such as the ""15-minutes city"" have been put in place to shift the attention from monocentric city configurations to polycentric structures, increasing the availability and diversity of local urban amenities. Ultimately they expect to increase local walkability and increase mobility within residential areas. While we know how urban amenities influence human mobility at the city level, little is known about spatial variations in this relationship. Here, we use mobile phone, census, and volunteered geographical data to measure geographic variations in the relationship between origin-destination flows and local urban accessibility in Barcelona. Using a Negative Binomial Geographically Weighted Regression model, we show that, globally, people tend to visit neighborhoods with better access to education and retail. Locally, these and other features change in sign and magnitude through the different neighborhoods of the city in ways that are not explained by administrative boundaries, and that provide deeper insights regarding urban characteristics such as rental prices. In conclusion, our work suggests that the qualities of a 15-minutes city can be measured at scale, delivering actionable insights on the polycentric structure of cities, and how people use and access this structure.","Graells-Garrido, Eduardo; Serra-Burriel, Feliu; Rowe, Francisco; Cucchietti, Fernando M; Reyes, Patricio",PLoS One,126,7

Design, setting, participants, and outcome measuresA cross-sectional study was conducted between December 2020 and January 2021, involving 1382 respondents aged 18 years and above from all eight divisions in Bangladesh. We used multiple linear regression to identify sociodemographic predictors of risk perception and multiple logistic regression to determine the relationship between risk perception and preventive practice. ResultsLow risk perception regarding COVID-19 was present among one-fifth of the respondents (19.8%). Younger age, being male, low education, single marital status, and rural residence were significantly associated with a low perceived risk of COVID-19. Hand washing and wearing mask were practiced by 80% and 67% of respondents, respectively. A low prevalence was noticed for social distancing (31%), avoiding social gathering (31%), and covering face while coughing/sneezing (18%). Furthermore, respondents with a high risk perception were found to be more likely than those with a low risk perception to practice all recommended COVID-19 preventive behaviors-hand washing (OR=2.4, 95% CI=1.5, 3.7), mask use (OR=3.4, 95% CI=2.3, 5), social distancing (OR=3.7, 95% CI=2.4, 5.6), sanitizer use (OR=2.7, 95% CI=1.8, 4.1), avoiding gathering (OR=2.3, 95% CI=1.6, 3.5), avoid touching face and mouth (OR=2.8, 95% CI=1.5, 5.3), and covering mouth while coughing/sneezing (OR=7, 95% CI=3.6, 13.4). ConclusionConsiderable number of Bangladeshi adults had low risk perception and low practice of some vital COVID-19 preventive behaviors before the onset of second wave of corona. All preventive practices were also influenced by respondents risk perception. This highlights the importance of strengthening and optimizing risk communication strategy even when the number of corona cases are low.

A recommendation was issued to postpone all elective surgical practices. However, some confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients required life-saving emergent surgeries. METHODS: To facilitate emergent surgical interventions for these patients, we have reviewed the current literature and established an algorithm of precautions to be taken by operating room team members during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: The initial algorithm of preparation for surgical intervention during the COVID-19 pandemic was relatively simple. However, the abrupt increase of confirmed COVID-19 cases due to returned overseas travelers since mid-March, 2020, disrupted the routine hospital clinical service. Due to the large number of febrile patients, the algorithm was therefore revised according to travel history, occupation, contact and cluster history (TOCC), unexplained fever/symptoms and emergent/non-emergent surgery. TOCC (+) patients presenting with otherwise unexplained fever/symptoms would be regarded as belonging to the fifth category of ""severe special infectious pneumonia."" If the patient requires emergent surgery to relieve the non-life-threatening disorders, two times of negative COVID-19 tests are necessary before the operation is approved. For life-threatening situations without two negative results of COVID-19 tests, the operation schedule should be approved by the Chairman of Surgery Management Committee. CONCLUSION: The application of a clear and integrated algorithm for operating room team members aids in effective personal protective equipment facilitation to keep both healthcare providers and patients safe as well as to prevent hospital-based transmission of COVID-19.","Hung, Jung-Jyh; Wang, Fu-Der; Ma, Hsu; Tsou, Mei-Yung; Dai, Hung-Da; Lin, Yi-Han; Chen, Wei-Ming; Liu, Chin-Su",J.

However, because transfusion support needs of COVID-19 patients are not well known, its impact on hospital blood supply is uncertain. The objective of this study was to assess the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on transfusion demand. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Transfusion records during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic (March 1-April 30, 2020) were reviewed in our center to assess changes in blood requirements. RESULTS: During this period 636 patients received a total of 2934 blood components, which reflects a 17.6% reduction in transfusion requirements with regard to the same period of 2019, and blood donations in Madrid dropped by 45%. The surgical blood demand decreased significantly during the outbreak (50.2%). Blood usage in the hematology and oncology departments remained unchanged, while the day ward demand halved, and intensive care unit transfusion needs increased by 116%. A total of 6.2% of all COVID inpatients required transfusion support. COVID-19 inpatients consumed 19% of all blood components, which counterbalanced the savings owed to the reduction in elective procedures. CONCLUSION: Although only a minority of COVID-19 inpatients required transfusion, the expected reduction in transfusion needs caused by the lack of elective surgical procedures is partially offset by the large number of admitted patients during the peak of the pandemic. This fact must be taken into account when planning hospital blood supply.","Velázquez-Kennedy, Kyra; Luna, Alejandro; Sánchez-Tornero, Adrián; Jiménez-Chillón, Carlos; Jiménez-Martín, Ana; Vallés Carboneras, Ana; Tenorio, María; García García, Irene; López-Jiménez, Francisco Javier; Moreno-Jiménez, Gemma",Transfusion,126,16

If true, this hypothesis may have practical value in allocating resources to particular patients while using a relatively inexpensive imaging technique. The difficulty of testing such a hypothesis comes from the need for large sets of labelled data, which not only need to be well-annotated but also should contemplate the post-imaging severity outcome. On this account, this paper presents a methodology for extracting features from a limited data set with outcome label (patient required ICU admission or not) and correlating its significance to an additional, larger data set with hundreds of images. The methodology employs a neural network trained to recognise lung pathologies to extract the semantic features, which are then analysed with a shallow decision tree to limit overfitting while increasing interpretability. This analysis points out that only a few features explain most of the variance between patients that developed severe symptoms. When applied to an unrelated, larger data set with labels extracted from clinical notes, the method classified distinct sets of samples where there was a much higher frequency of labels such as `Consolidation', `Effusion', and `alveolar'. A further brief analysis on the locations of such labels also showed a significant increase in the frequency of words like `bilateral', `middle', and `lower' in patients classified as with higher chances of going severe. The methodology for dealing with the lack of specific ICU label data while attesting correlations with a data set containing text notes is novel; its results suggest that some pathologies should receive higher weights when assessing disease severity.","Gomes, Douglas P.

In the epigenetics analysis, DNA methylation and histone modification analyses have been actively studied for a long time, and many important findings were accumulated. On the other hand, recently, attention has also been focused on RNA modification in the field of epigenetics; now it is known that RNA modification is associated with various biological functions, such as regulation of gene expression. Among RNA modifications, functional analysis of N6-methyladenosine (m6A), the most abundant RNA modification found from humans to plants is actively progressing, and it has also been known that m6A abnormality is involved in cancer and other diseases. Importantly, recent studies have shown that m6A is related to viral infections. Considering the current world situation under threat of viral infections, it is important to deepen knowledge of RNA modification from the viewpoint of viral diseases.

The COVID-19 epidemic in Greece was explored through a Monte Carlo uncertainty analysis framework, and the optimal values for the parameters that determined the transmission dynamics could be obtained before, during, and after the interventions to control the epidemic. The dynamic change of the fraction of asymptomatic individuals was shown. The analysis of the modelling results at the intra-annual climatic scale allowed for in depth investigation of the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 and the significance and relative importance of the model parameters. Moreover, the analysis at this scale incorporated the exploration of the forecast horizon and its variability. Three discrete peaks were found in the transmission rates throughout the investigated period (15 February-15 December 2020). Two of them corresponded to the timing of the spring and autumn epidemic waves while the third one occurred in mid-summer, implying that relaxation of social distancing and increased mobility may have a strong effect on rekindling the epidemic dynamics offsetting positive effects from factors such as decreased household crowding and increased environmental ultraviolet radiation. In addition, the epidemiological state was found to constitute a significant indicator of the forecast reliability horizon, spanning from as low as few days to more than four weeks. Embedding the model in an ensemble framework may extend the predictability horizon.

It necessitated extensive use ofpersonal protective equipment (PPE) by health care workers which rapidly became in short supply. We previously describeda novel negative airway pressure respirator and a cadaveric model to evaluate the escape of aerosolized particles. We nowpresent a novel personal protective mask that can be made out of components readily available at most hospitals in timesof shortage. Methods: A prototype mask (N-99) was designed by connecting an in-line anesthesia circuit HEPA N-99 filter to a standardAmbu mask. The mask is fixed to the user's face using adjustable rubber straps. To demonstrate the protective efficacy, themask was fit tested on 10 healthy participants using standard sugar hood technique ([ Fig. 1 ]). Our recently publishedcadaveric model was used to assess the escape of particles from the novel mask. Our model utilizes white colored smoke tosimulate the SARS-CoV-2 virus and a high-definition camera to capture the smoke particles on a black background. The N-99 mask, with and without the filter, was compared with no mask, a standard surgical mask, and a commercially availableN-95 mask. Results: The hood fit test was successful in every volunteer demonstrating good fit and protection. All the participants alsodescribed the N-99 mask as more comfortable, than a traditional N-95. The cadaveric model revealed that the novel N-99mask was able to block 98% ([ Fig. 2 ]) of the particles whereas the other masks were less effective ([ Fig. 3 ]). Discussion: We present a novel N-99 mask made with readily available hospital supplies. Based upon our cadaveric model,the N-99 mask seems more effective at filtering submicron particles better than a standard N-95 mask. The N-99 maskcould also be applied to a patient suspected of being infected to prevent virus spreading while other measures are put inplace. Future directions include refining the design to further increase the comfort and adapt the filter to our previouslydescribed NAPR mask.","Lavergne, P.; Khoury, T.; Chitguppi, C.; Toskala, E.; Rabinowitz, M.

SARS-CoV-2 enters host cells by binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 and activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system may affect susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and outcome of patients with COVID-19. METHODS: In this prospective single-center study, we determined the serum levels of ACE-2, angiotensin II and aldosterone in patients with COVID-19 compared to control patients presenting with similar symptoms in the emergency unit. RESULTS: We analyzed serum samples from 24 SARS-CoV-2 positive and 61 SARS-CoV-2 negative patients. SARS-CoV-2 positive and control patients did not differ in baseline patients characteristics, symptoms and clinical presentation. Mean serum concentrations of ACE2, angiotensin II, and aldosterone did not differ between the SARS-CoV-2 positive and the control group. In line with this, serum potassium as surrogate parameter for RAAS activity and blood pressure were similar in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, we did not find evidence for altered RAAS activity including angiotensin II, aldosterone, or potassium levels, and blood pressure in patients with COVID-19.","Rieder, Marina; Wirth, Luisa; Pollmeier, Luisa; Jeserich, Maren; Goller, Isabella; Baldus, Niklas; Schmid, Bonaventura; Busch, Hans-Joerg; Hofmann, Maike; Kern, Winfried; Bode, Christoph; Duerschmied, Daniel; Lother, Achim",Am J Hypertens,126,21

In this commentary, an analytical discursive approach was chosen to owe to Africa's unique situation of weak health systems, with most of its member states showing an initial reluctance to deal openly with the COVID-19 situation. This paper discusses five major control measures doped the SHEF2 Model i.e. (""SHEF2""- S: Social distancing, H: Hands, E: Elbows, F: Face, F: Feel) of COVID-19 implemented in Africa. We also review the issues related to implementing SHEF2 control measures in Africa. The measures being taken in Asia, Europe, and North America such as social distancing and regular hand washing are a particular challenge for African countries with dense populations, unequal access to water, and limited social safety nets. COVID-19 is challenging the public health and socio-political systems of all affected African countries. The burden of COVID-19 demands rapid and decisive action to be taken, yet the comparison shows how difficult it is was for an unknown new coronavirus disease. In line with the steps being taken across the globe to control and contain COVID-19 pandemic, African countries are preparing for the great effects of this pandemic and ensuing deep recession thus the reason we assert, the greater hope for African countries is implementing an aggressive SHEF2 model strategy.

The advent of Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 has resulted in an increased deployment and use of mHealth-linked POC diagnostics in SSA. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the accuracy of mobile-linked point-of-care diagnostics in SSA. Our systematic review and meta-analysis were guided by the Preferred Reporting Items requirements for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis. We exhaustively searched PubMed, Science Direct, Google Scholar, MEDLINE, and CINAHL with full text via EBSCOhost databases, from mHealth inception to March 2021. The statistical analyses were conducted using OpenMeta-Analyst software. All 11 included studies were considered for the meta-analysis. The included studies focused on malaria infections, Schistosoma haematobium, Schistosoma mansoni, soil-transmitted helminths, and Trichuris trichiura. The pooled summary of sensitivity and specificity estimates were moderate compared to those of the reference representing the gold standard. The overall pooled estimates of sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio, negative likelihood ratio, and diagnostic odds ratio of mobile-linked POC diagnostic devices were as follows: 0.499 (95% CI: 0.458–0.541), 0.535 (95% CI: 0.401–0.663), 0.952 (95% CI: 0.60–1.324), 1.381 (95% CI: 0.391–4.879), and 0.944 (95% CI: 0.579–1.538), respectively. Evidence shows that the diagnostic accuracy of mobile-linked POC diagnostics in detecting infections in SSA is presently moderate. Future research is recommended to evaluate mHealth devices’ diagnostic potential using devices with excellent sensitivities and specificities for diagnosing diseases in this setting.","Osei, Ernest Nkambule Sphamandla Josias Vezi Portia Nelisiwe Mashamba-Thompson Tivani P.",Diagnostics,126,16

Although several ophthalmology organizations have released guidance on appropriate PPE for surgical procedures and ophthalmology clinics, there is limited experimental evidence that demonstrates the efficacy of various interventions that have been suggested. In this study, we evaluated high-risk aspects of the slit-lamp exam and the effect of various PPE interventions, specifically the use of a surgical mask and a slit-lamp shield. DESIGN: Experimental simulation study. METHODS: This was a single-center study in a patient simulation population. This study examined the presence of particles in the air near or on a slit-lamp, a simulated slit-lamp examiner, or a simulated patient using a fluorescent surrogate of respiratory droplets. RESULTS: Simulated coughing without a mask or slit-lamp shield resulted in widespread dispersion of fluorescent droplets during the model slit-lamp examination. Coughing with a mask resulted in the most significant decrease in droplets; however, particles still escaped from the top of the mask. Coughing with the slit-lamp shield alone blocked most of forward particle dispersion; however, significant distributions of respiratory droplets were found on the slit-lamp joystick and table. Coughing with both a mask and slit-lamp shield resulted in the least dispersion to the simulated examiner and the simulated patient. Scanning electron microscopy demonstrated particle sizes of 3-100 µm. CONCLUSIONS: Masking had the greatest effect in limiting spread of respiratory droplets, whereas slit-lamp shields and gloves also contributed to limiting exposure to droplets from SARS-CoV-2 during slit-lamp examination.","Shah, Sahil H; Garg, Anupam K; Patel, Shiv; Yim, Wonjun; Jokerst, Jesse V; Chao, Daniel L",Am J Ophthalmol,126,1

DESIGN: Qualitative comparative case study design of nurse staffing systems in England and Wales. METHODS: Data will be collected through a variety of sources: individual interviews, observations of relevant meetings and analysis of key documents. Ethical approval for the study was granted in August 2020 from The Healthcare Research Ethics Committee (SREC reference: REC741). Data generation will be informed by science and technology studies and practice theories. DISCUSSION: Ensuring adequate numbers of nurses are available to care for patients in response to shifting demand is an international policy priority. Emerging evidence on the use of formal workforce planning methodologies across the developed world highlights both the centrality of nurses' professional judgement in nurse staffing methodologies and the urgent need for theoretically informed research to better understand and conceptualise its contribution to decision-making. This study is designed to address this gap in understanding. It takes advantage of nurses' experiences of managing the service and staffing impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic and differences in strategic approaches to nurse staffing systems between England and Wales. IMPACT: The research will: make visible the knowledge and skills that underpin professional judgement in nurse staffing decisions and provide a conceptual language with which to articulate this; lay the foundations for evidence-based programmes of nurse education and continuing professional development; furnish the evidence to inform the development of nurse-led decision support tools to augment professional judgement; and generate wider insights into the effectiveness of nurse staffing systems in practice.","Jacob, Nina; Burton, Chris; Hale, Rachel; Jones, Aled; Lloyd, Amy; Rafferty, Anne Marie; Allen, Davina",J. adv. nurs,126,20

We aimed to describe epidemiological features and clinical course in Shanghai. Methods: We retrospectively analysed 325 cases admitted at Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, between January 20 and February 29, 2020. Results: 47.4% (154/325) had visited Wuhan within 2 weeks of illness onset. 57.2% occurred in 67 clusters; 40% were situated within 53 family clusters. 83.7% developed fever during the disease course. Median times from onset to first medical care, hospitalization and negative detection of nucleic acid by nasopharyngeal swab were 1, 4 and 8 days. Patients with mild disease using glucocorticoid tended to have longer viral shedding in blood and feces. At admission, 69.8% presented with lymphopenia and 38.8% had elevated D-dimers. Pneumonia was identified in 97.5% (314/322) of cases by chest CT scan. Severe-critical patients were 8% with a median time from onset to critical disease of 10.5 days. Half required oxygen therapy and 7.1% high-flow nasal oxygen. The case fatality rate was 0.92% with median time from onset to death of 16 days. Conclusion: COVID-19 cases in Shanghai were imported.

This resulted in an unprecedented backlog of procedures in most clinical practices including pediatrics. Our group developed an internal process toward the rational development of an algorithm prioritizing elective procedures. This was based on patient disease severity defined by the presence of alert symptoms, symptom severity for dysphagia and abdominal pain, and diagnostic investigation findings. The underlying rationale is to prioritize patients in whom suspected disease course would be greatest impacted by endoscopy. We developed a nurse phone call-based process utilizing REDCap®, identifying relevant symptoms categorized by severity, and a validated functional impairment questionnaire for abdominal pain. We abstracted key laboratory and radiological findings also categorized by severity. The order of priority of procedures was established on the basis of a 4-tiered system factoring both presence and severity of symptoms or prior diagnostic testing results. We present the framework that we have adopted toward prioritizing procedures with the assumption that it offers an objective methodology and that can be efficiently and more broadly applied to other similar practice scenarios.

We suggest benefits of a lower range of serum ferritin as has occurred for total serum cholesterol and fasting blood glucose levels. Observations during a prospective randomized study using phlebotomy in patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) offered unique insights into dual roles of serum ferritin both as an iron status marker and acute phase reactant. Robust positive associations between serum ferritin, interleukin 6 [IL-6], tissue necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a), and high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) were discovered. Elevated serum ferritin and IL-6 levels associated with increased mortality and with reduced mortality at ferritin levels < 100 ng/mL. Epidemiologic studies demonstrate similar outcomes. Extremely elevated ferritin and IL-6 levels also occur in individuals with high mortality due to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Disordered iron metabolism reflected by a high range of serum ferritin level signals disease severity and outcomes. Based upon experimental and epidemiologic data, we suggest testing the hypotheses that optimal ferritin levels for cardiovascular mortality reduction range from 20-100 ng/mL with % transferrin levels from 20-50%, to ensure adequate iron status and that ferritin levels above 194 ng/mL associate with all-cause mortality in population cohorts.","DePalma, Ralph G; Hayes, Virginia W; O039,; Leary, Timothy J",Metallomics (Print),126,16

The diagnosis is usually performed by RT-PCR or CT chest scan. Lung ultrasonography (LUS) has been proposed as an alternative method to monitor patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. To assess the diagnostic performance of LUS, we performed LUS using a portable device and adapting a protocol already used in Acute Respiratory Syndrome. We used the score obtained with the index we created to assess for LUS diagnostic performance as compared to lung CT chest scan and to predict for oxygen requirements. Daily bedside LUS was easy to perform and microbiologically safe. LUS was 89% sensitive and 100% specific in predicting CT chest scan abnormalities, and 95% sensitive and 67% specific in detecting oxygen requirements. This is the first report on the diagnostic performance of LUS as compared to CT chest scan for the diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia and assessments of oxygen requirements by LUS. LUS could help in the orientation of dyspneic patients to intensive care.

We report the clinical case of a young patient who presented to the Emergency Department with respiratory failure and clinical symptoms, radiological aspects, and blood tests compatible with COVID-19; two swabs and a serology test for SARS-CoV-2 were performed, both resulted negative, but the respiratory failure worsened. Peripheral eosinophilia guided us to consider the possibility of a rare disease such as AEP, even if radiology findings were not pathognomonic. Therefore, we decided to perform a flexible bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) at the lingula, which showed the presence of eosinophilia greater than 40%. As a consequence, we treated the patient with high-dose corticosteroids that completely resolved the respiratory symptoms. This case report highlights the difficulty of making alternative diagnoses during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially for rare lung diseases such as AEP, which may have initial characteristics similar to COVID-19.","Livrieri, Francesco; Ghidoni, Giulia; Piro, Roberto; Menzella, Francesco; Cavazza, Alberto; Lazzaretti, Claudia; Massari, Marco; Montanari, Gloria; Fontana, Matteo; Facciolongo, Nicola Cosimo",Int Med Case Rep J,126,16

We hypothesize that patients with Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) may develop a hypermetabolic state, which may be a major contributing factor to the extraordinary ventilatory and oxygenation demands in patients with COVID-19. METHOD: Resting energy expenditure (REE), carbon dioxide production (VCO2 ), and oxygen consumption (VO2 ) were measured by indirect calorimetry on 7 critically ill patients with COVID-19. RESULTS: The median measured REE was 4044 kcal/d, which was 235.7% ± 51.7% of predicted. The median VCO2 was 452 mL/min (range, 295-582 mL/min), and the median VO2 was 585 mL/min (range, 416-798 mL/min). CONCLUSION: Critically ill patients with COVID-19 are in an extreme hypermetabolic state.

The confirmed patients in isolation hotels, hospital ward, and fever clinical were mainly middle-aged and elderly, and most of them were women. The positive rate in isolation hotels and fever clinics gradually decreased over time. There were no significant differences between genders among those six nucleic acid collection sites (P < .05). The hospital wards have the highest positive rate; however, close contact sites have lowest one. Patients who are discharged from hospitals may still have potential risks.

METHODS: Cross-sectional data were collected during the period of tightest restrictions between 26 April 2020 and 6 June 2020. Eligible participants included all Russian adults aged 18 years and over. Participants reported their sleep patterns and problems, frequency and duration of walking, moderate- and vigorous-intensity PA, and muscle strengthening activities before COVID-19 and during the past 7 days. Access to an outdoor green space and fitness centres, use of online resources, adherence to self-isolation recommendations and other preventive measures from Ministry of Health were self-reported. RESULTS: The sample included 2432 participants from 62 regions, 83% of who were female. There was a significant decline in the number of days per week participants reported not getting enough sleep (3.21 ± 2.44 to 2.86 ± 2.57; P < 0.001); participants also reported an increase in the number of days per week they had trouble falling asleep (1.70 ± 2.24 to 2.13 ± 2.48; P < 0.001).

The lack of knowledge on the precise mechanism of viral pathogenesis is impeding medical intervention. In this study, we have taken both in silico and in vitro experimental approaches to unravel the mechanism of viral pathogenesis associated with complement and coagulation pathways. Based on the structural similarities of viral and host proteins, we initially generated a protein-protein interactome profile. Further computational analysis combined with Gene Ontology (GO) analysis and KEGG pathway analysis predicted key annotated pathways associated with viral pathogenesis. These include MAPK signaling, complement, and coagulation cascades, endocytosis, PD-L1 expression, PD-1 checkpoint pathway in cancer and C-type lectin receptor signaling pathways. Degree centrality analysis pinned down to MAPK1, MAPK3, AKT1, and SRC are crucial drivers of signaling pathways and often overlap with the associated pathways. Most strikingly, the complement and coagulation cascade and platelet activation pathways are interconnected, presumably directing thrombotic activity observed in severe or critical cases of COVID-19. This is complemented by in vitro studies of Huh7 cell infection and analysis of the transcriptome and proteomic profile of gene candidates during viral infection. The most known candidates associated with complement and coagulation cascade signaling by KEGG pathway analysis showed significant up-regulated fold change during viral infection. Collectively both in silico and in vitro studies suggest complement and coagulation cascade signaling are a mechanism for intravascular coagulation, thrombotic changes, and associated complications in severe COVID-19 patients.","Tiwari, Ritudhwaj; Mishra, Anurag R; Mikaeloff, Flora; Gupta, Soham; Mirazimi, Ali; Byrareddy, Siddappa N; Neogi, Ujjwal; Nayak, Debasis",,126,26

OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to shed light on relations between caregiver mental reaction to the pandemic and caregiver distress related to neuropsychiatric symptoms, memory impairment progression, and functional impairment of people with neurocognitive disorder during the period of confinement in Greece. METHODS: The study included caregivers of patients with mild (Nâ=â13) and major (Nâ=â54) neurocognitive disorder. The caregiver-based telephone interview was based on items of the neuropsychiatric inventory questionnaire, the AD8 Dementia Screening Instrument, and the Bristol Activities of Daily Living Scale. Regarding the mental impact of the COVID-19 crisis on caregivers, four single questions referring to their worries in the last seven days were posed, in addition to the scales Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-Item (GAD-7) and the 22-item Impact of Event Scale-revised (IES-R). A stepwise linear regression model was employed for studying the relationship between caregiver distress and demographic and clinical data and caregiver mental reaction to COVID-19 pandemic outbreak. RESULTS: Caregiver distress severity during the confinement period was influenced not only by memory deficits (pâ=â0.009) and neuropsychiatric symptoms (pâ< â0.001) of patients, but also by caregiver hyperarousal (pâ=â0.003) and avoidance symptoms (pâ=â0.033) and worries directly linked to the COVID-19 crisis (pâ=â0.022). CONCLUSION: These observations provide further evidence for the urgent need for support of caregivers of patients with neurocognitive disorder during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Alexopoulos, Panagiotis; Soldatos, Rigas; Kontogianni, Evagellia; Frouda, Maria; Loanna Aligianni, Souzana; Skondra, Maria; Passa, Maria; Konstantopoulou, Georgia; Stamouli, Evangelia; Katirtzoglou, Evgenia; Politis, Anastasios; Economou, Polychronis; Alexaki, Maria; Siarkos, Kostas; Politis, Antonios",J. alzheimers dis,126,11

We assessed the psychological impact of the lockdown on Belgian residents in urology and their resounding on the quality of the training. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A self-administered anonymous questionnaire assessing the risk of burnout in a pandemic situation and its impact on the quality of the training was e-mailed to the members of the European Society of Residents in Urology of Belgium (ESRU-B). We used the Copenhagen Burnout Inventory score which assesses the different dimensions of burnout (personal (CBIP), professional (CBIPro), relational (CBIR)). Several questions evaluating impact on residents' health and apprehension of the future were included. The survey lasted for 5 days. Comparison of parameters before and during the coronavirus crisis was made using paired samples t-test or Chi2 test were. RESULTS: Fifty percent (62/126) of the ESRU-B members replied to the questionnaire. If 93% of the responders reported a negative impact on the quality of their practical training (CI95=[0.07-1.10]; P=0.83), 56% and 61.7% reported a positive impact of the crisis on their life and on their theoretical training respectively. Burnout risk scores were significantly reduced (P<0.001) for each dimension 7.26 to 3.40 (CBIP), 9.02 to 4.35 (CBIPro) and 4.42 to 3.03 (CBIR) respectively. CONCLUSION: Despite a negative impact on the daily work quality, the decrease in activity induced by the lockdown did not have a negative psychological impact on Belgian residents in urology but stress the opportunity to review the current training system to be better balanced between practice and theoretical formation.","Degraeve, A; Lejeune, S; Muilwijk, T; Poelaert, F; Piraprez, M; Svistakov, I; Roumeguère, T",Prog. urol.

However, there is a paucity of concussion research related to para sport, and prior International Concussion in Sport (CIS) consensus papers have not substantively addressed this population. To remedy this and to improve concussion care provided to para athletes, the concussion in para sport (CIPS) multidisciplinary expert group was created. This group analysed and discussed in-depth para athlete-specific issues within the established key clinical domains of the current (2017) consensus statement on CIS. Due to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the group held all meetings by video conferencing. The existing Sport Concussion Assessment Tool 5 (SCAT5) for the immediate on-field and office-based off-field assessment of concussion was evaluated as part of this process, to identify any para athlete-specific concerns. Regular preparticipation and periodic health examinations are essential to determine a baseline reference point for concussion symptoms but pose additional challenges for the interpreting clinician. Further considerations for concussion management for the para athlete are required within the remove, rest, reconsider and refer consensus statement framework. Considering return to sport (RTS), the 2017 CIS consensus statement has limitations when considering the RTS of the para athlete. Case-by-case decision making related to RTS following concussion is imperative for para athletes. Additional challenges exist for the evaluation and management of concussion in para athletes. There is a need for greater understanding of existing knowledge gaps and attitudes towards concussion among athlete medical staff, coaches and para athletes. Future research should investigate the use and performance of common assessment tools in the para athlete population to better guide their clinical application and inform potential modifications. Concussion prevention strategies and sport-specific rule changes, such as in Para Alpine Skiing and Cerebral Palsy Football, also should be carefully considered to reduce the occurrence of concussion in para athletes.","Weiler, Richard; Blauwet, Cheri; Clarke, David; Dalton, Kristine; Derman, Wayne; Fagher, Kristina; Gouttebarge, Vincent; Kissick, James; Lee, Kenneth; Lexell, Jan; Van de Vliet, Peter; Verhagen, Evert; Webborn, Nick; Ahmed, Osman Hassan",Br. j. sports med,126,16

Systematic review,16.762653,8.733962,2020,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The outbreak of the current pandemic begun from the first individual of a 55-year old from Hubei province in China, the disease instigated by the new coronavirus spreading across the world. Scientists presently speculate this coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, originated in a bat and by one way or another jumped to another creature, potentially the pangolin, which at that point gave it to people. The ailment is currently spreading between individuals with no animal delegate. Researchers are struggling to follow the infection back to where it started to become familiar with its spread. In the event that, for example, specialists can locate the soonest cases, they might have the option to distinguish the creature have where the infection hides. In March and April 2020, researchers detailed that this virus created normally. Coronavirus has been become of the serious global phenomena in the recent years and has negative effects in the entire world health and economy. The virus is believed to have been associated with a host animal which human contracted. Subsequently, human-to-human infection began. Through migration as humans have become complex with easy mobility the disease has traveled to the entire continent. Now, numerous scientist are going on in the hope of obtaining medication and vaccination to prevent the spread of the disease and mortality of the disease. It is important that we obtain quantitative and qualitative information about the etiology of this disease which is crucial. Mathematical modeling is capable of providing qualitative information on many parameters that guides the decision making of health practitioners. In this work we focus the optimal control of COVID-19 with the help of Non Pharmaceutical Interventions (NPIs). To find the role of factors/parameters in the transmission of the syndrome we find R0; the ratio of reproduction for the proposed model. METHODS: To find the role of parameters in the transmission of the syndrome we find R0; the ratio of reproduction for the proposed model. On the basis of sensitivity indices of the parameters we apply Non Pharmaceutical Interventions(NPIs) to control the sensitive parameters and hence formulate the optimal control mode. With the help of Hamiltonian and Lagrangian we minimize the density of contaminated stuff and infected human population. RESULTS: We focus the optimal control of COVID-19 with the help of Non Pharmaceutical Interventions(NPIs). On the basis of sensitivity indices of the parameters we apply Non Pharmaceutical Interventions(NPIs) to control the sensitive parameters and hence formulate the optimal control model. The major NPIs are, STAY HOME, SANITIZER (wash hands), EARLY CASE DETECTION (PCR Test) and FACE MASK. These NPIs helps in mitigation and reducing the size of outbreak of the disease. CONCLUSION: We check the existence of the optimal solution for the system. At the end, Using matlab we produce numerical simulations for validation of results of control variables. The results demonstrate that if there is no control (variables/interventios), 900 out 1000 susceptible individuals may be infected (exposed) in very short period. As such a circumstances no agency fighting against COVID-19 could be successful due to its limited resources.","Zamir, Muhmmad; Shah, Zahir; Nadeem, Fawad; Memood, Arif; Alrabaiah, Hussam; Kumam, Poom",Comput Methods Programs Biomed,126,16

Methods: Retrospective analysis of subjects undergoing PoC-RAT for COVID-19 infection at a tertiary level dedicated eye care facility. Decision making with regard to commencement of elective surgeries post COVID-19 related discontinuation of services, contact tracing of HCPs and ancillary hospital staff exposed to known COVID-19 cases and implementation of back-to-work policy for all staff based upon the results of PoC-RAT were studied. Results: A total of 311 subjects (224 patients and 87 hospital staff) were tested. Overall positivity rate was around 7%. Asymptomatic patients who were screened preoperatively had a lower positivity rate at around 3% compared to the staff (who were either known contacts or were symptomatic) at around 17%. Contact tracing found three-quarters of the staff at low risk and only one quarter at medium or high risk. Among patients, 97% of those followed up for at least 2 weeks after the test remained healthy. For staff, this was around 65%. Conclusion: Based on our preliminary results, we suggest that PoC-RAT may be considered routinely for indication-based preoperative screening of asymptomatic patients, and for on-campus screening, contact tracing and implementation of BTW policies for HCPs and ancillary hospital staff at a tertiary level eye care facility.","Tripathy, Devjyoti; Roy, Avik Kumar; Khanna, Rohit C; Jalali, Subhadra; Panigrahy, Bharat; Parija, Deepthi Chandran; Rath, Suryasnata",Indian J Ophthalmol,126,26

Impacts on the mental health conditions and the associated predictors relating to adults in Pakistan, the fifth most populous country in the world, during the COVID-19 remain understudied. Our aim was to investigate distress, anxiety, and overall mental health and their associated predictors among Pakistani adults in this pandemic. We specifically examine mental health issues based on the distance from the epicenter, (a predictor that has revealed opposing evidence in other countries) based on the theories of typhoon eye effect and ripple effect. The sample consisted of 601 adults who were surveyed online about 2.5 months into the outbreak across Pakistan with varying distances from the epicenter of COVID-19 of Karachi. RESULTS: The results showed that 9.2 and 19.0% of the participants surpassed the cut-off criteria for distress and anxiety disorders, respectively. Overall, the distance from the epicenter positively predicted the mental health of adults in Pakistan, and family size negatively moderated this effect. The distance from the epicenter negatively predicted distress and anxiety disorders for adults in large families, which are quite common in Pakistan. CONCLUSION: The evidence of the study interestingly finds that the prediction of the mental health of people by their distance from the epicenter depends on family size. The evidence of this study can help to provide initial indicators for mental health care providers to screen vulnerable groups in Pakistan, a populous country that continues struggling to cope with the COVID-19 pandemic.","Lateef, Tooba; Chen, Jiyao; Tahir, Muhammad; Lateef, Teba Abdul; Chen, Bryan Z; Li, Jizhen; Zhang, Stephen X",Global Health,126,1

It is known that chronic cardiovascular diseases are associated with the risk of severe course and lethal outcomes both in COVID-19 and other infectious diseases. Therefore, in each case it is necessary to study the interaction and mutual influence of different components of the treatment program prescribed to such patients.The purpose of this work was to evaluate the effect of coagulation activity on the course of a novel coronavirus infection (COVID-19) and to justify the management of comorbid patients having been received novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs) in previously selected doses according to indications in concomitant somatic diseases. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Total 76 cases of confirmed coronavirus infection in patients who had been received initial therapy on an outpatient basis were analyzed. 26 patients who received NOACs (rivaroxaban, apixaban, dabigatran) made up the main group and 50 - the comparison (control) group in which patients had not been administered any drugs that affect blood clotting until the episode of COVID-19. All patients have been prescribed therapy following the Provisional guidelines «Prevention, diagnosis and treatment of coronavirus infection (COVID-19)¼ (https://static-0.minzdrav.gov.ru/system/attachments/attaches/). RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The number of hospitalizations was significantly fewer in the group of patients who had been received NOACs (19 vs. 66% in the control group). No deaths or cases of severe respiratory and/or renal failure were observed in the main group, while adverse outcomes were noted in 14% of patients who had not been administered these drugs. CONCLUSION: Taking NOACs reduces the probability of severe course and adverse outcomes in the development of coronavirus infection caused by SARS-CoV-2, which indicates a significant contribution of coagulation mechanisms to the pathogenesis in COVID-19. There were no indications for drug replacement and correction of anticoagulant therapy regimens in patients who received adequate therapy with oral anticoagulants for treating a non-severe form of coronavirus infection in ambulatory patient settings.","Ruzhentsova, T A; Khavkina, D A; Chukhliaev, P V; Garbuzov, A A; Ploskireva, A A",Vopr Virusol,126,10

Vaccination is the best way to prevent PEDV infection in young piglets.Objective: To enhance the efficacy of an inactivated vaccine against PEDV, we evaluated the adjuvant properties of Fc domain of IgG.Methods: Fifteen crossbred gilts (180 â¼ 210 days old) were used. Five pigs in group 1 were intramuscularly vaccinated twice at 4 weeks and 2 weeks prior to farrowing with 106 TCID50 of inactivated PEDV. Five pigs in group 2 were intramuscularly vaccinated twice at 4 weeks and 2 weeks prior to farrowing with 106 TCID50 of inactivated PEDV-sFc. Five pigs in group 3 were not vaccinated and served as negative controls. Serum samples were collected at farrowing and subjected to ELISA, a serum neutralizing (SN) test, and a cytokine assay. Statistical analysis was performed by a two-tailed unpaired t-test.Results: Vero cells expressing swine IgG Fc on its surface was established. When PEDV was propagated in the cells expressing the swine Fc, PEDV virion incorporated the Fc. Immunization of pigs with inactivated PEDV harbouring Fc induced significantly higher antibody production against PEDV, comparing to the immunization with normal inactivated PEDV. In addition, we observed significantly increased IFN-Î³ levels in sera.Conclusion: Our results indicate that Fc molecule facilitate immune responses and PEDV harbouring Fc molecule could be a possible vaccine candidate. However, a challenge experiment would be needed to investigate the protective efficacy of PEDV harbouring Fc.","Park, Jung-Eun; Jang, Hyun; Kim, Ju-Hun; Hyun, Bang-Hun; Shin, Hyun-Jin",Vet Q,126,26

A large Health Information Exchange (HIE) in Southeast Texas, which assembles and shares electronic health information among providers to facilitate patient care, was leveraged to identify COVID-19 patients, create a cohort, and identify risk factors for both favorable and unfavorable outcomes. The initial sample consists of 8,874 COVID-19 patients ascertained from the pandemic's onset to June 12th, 2020 and was created for the analyses shown here. We gathered demographic, lifestyle, laboratory, and clinical data from patient's encounters across the healthcare system. Tobacco use history was examined as a potential risk factor for COVID-19 fatality along with age, gender, race/ethnicity, body mass index (BMI), and number of comorbidities. Of the 8,874 patients included in the cohort, 475 died from COVID-19. Of the 5,356 patients who had information on history of tobacco use, over 26% were current or former tobacco users. Multivariable logistic regression showed that the odds of COVID-19 fatality increased among those who were older (odds ratio = 1.07, 95% CI 1.06, 1.08), male (1.91, 95% CI 1.58, 2.31), and had a history of tobacco use (2.45, 95% CI 1.93, 3.11). History of tobacco use remained significantly associated (1.65, 95% CI 1.27, 2.13) with COVID-19 fatality after adjusting for age, gender, and race/ethnicity. This effort demonstrates the impact of having an HIE to rapidly identify a cohort, aggregate sociodemographic, behavioral, clinical and laboratory data across disparate healthcare providers electronic health record (HER) systems, and follow the cohort over time. These HIE capabilities enable clinical specialists and epidemiologists to conduct outcomes analyses during the current COVID-19 pandemic and beyond.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the topics associated with the public discourse against wearing masks in the United States. We also studied the relationship between the anti-mask discourse on social media and the number of new COVID-19 cases. METHODS: We collected a total of 51,170 English tweets between January 1, 2020, and October 27, 2020, by searching for hashtags against wearing masks. We used machine learning techniques to analyze the data collected. We investigated the relationship between the volume of tweets against mask-wearing and the daily volume of new COVID-19 cases using a Pearson correlation analysis between the two-time series. RESULTS: The results and analysis showed that social media could help identify important insights related to wearing masks. The results of topic mining identified 10 categories or themes of user concerns dominated by (1) constitutional rights and freedom of choice; (2) conspiracy theory, population control, and big pharma; and (3) fake news, fake numbers, and fake pandemic. Altogether, these three categories represent almost 65% of the volume of tweets against wearing masks. The relationship between the volume of tweets against wearing masks and newly reported COVID-19 cases depicted a strong correlation wherein the rise in the volume of negative tweets led the rise in the number of new cases by 9 days. CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrated the potential of mining social media for understanding the public discourse about public health issues such as wearing masks during the COVID-19 pandemic. The results emphasized the relationship between the discourse on social media and the potential impact on real events such as changing the course of the pandemic. Policy makers are advised to proactively address public perception and work on shaping this perception through raising awareness, debunking negative sentiments, and prioritizing early policy intervention toward the most prevalent topics.","Al-Ramahi, Mohammad; Elnoshokaty, Ahmed; El-Gayar, Omar; Nasralah, Tareq; Wahbeh, Abdullah",JMIR Public Health Surveill,126,24

Sedation or general anaesthetic are often required to close lacerations safely and to a good surgical standard. Our hospital introduced the use of local anaesthetic gel (LAT) following an audit, to reduce the need for paediatric admissions. In light of the current COVID-19 pandemic, this can be a valuable tool to help avoid admissions. OBJECTIVES: To ascertain the usefulness of LAT gel in reducing paediatric admissions. METHODS: Data was collected prospectively of all children presenting to the paediatric emergency department for input by the oral and maxillofacial team after the introduction of LAT gel. Data collected included age, aetiology, length and position of laceration, associated injuries and management. Use of LAT gel and other anaesthetics was recorded. FINDINGS: Over a 12 month period, 536 children attended the paediatric ED. Paediatric lacerations accounted for 45% of the reasons for attendance. LAT gel was used in management of 33% of patients with facial lacerations. The use of the gel was successful in 76% of occasions. Ninety children (16.8% of all attendances) were admitted to hospital during this time, of which 49 were paediatric lacerations. CONCLUSION: LAT gel is an effective adjunct to management of laceration in the paediatric population.","Dua, Radhika; Fan, Kathleen",Surg. (Edinb.),126,2

Since the COVID-19 emerged, the number of patients with an acute respiratory failure has increased in the health units. This chaotic situation has led to a deficiency in health resources. Thus, this study, using the concepts of the multiattribute utility theory (MAUT), puts forward a mathematical model to aid physicians in the screening decision problem. The model is used to generate which of the three alternatives is the best one for where patients with suspected COVID-19 should be treated, namely, an intensive care unit (ICU), a hospital ward, or at home in isolation. Also, a decision information system, called SIDTriagem, is constructed and illustrated to operate the mathematical model proposed.","Roselli, Lucia Reis Peixoto; Frej, Eduarda Asfora; Ferreira, Rodrigo José Pires; Alberti, Alexandre Ramalho; de Almeida, Adiel Teixeira",Comput Math Methods Med,126,1

While nucleic acid based tests are considered to be more sensitive with respect to serological tests but present gold standard qRT-PCR-based assays possess limitations such as low sample throughput, requirement for sophisticated reagents and instrumentation. To overcome these shortcomings, recent efforts of incorporating LAMP-based isothermal detection, and minimizing the number of reagents required are on rise.

Over 23 million positive cases of COVID-19 have been reported till late August 2020. Medical images such as chest X-rays and Computed Tomography scans are becoming one of the main leading clinical diagnosis tools in fighting against COVID-19, underpinned by Artificial Intelligence based techniques, resulting in rapid decision-making in saving lives. This article provides an extensive review of AI-based methods to assist medical practitioners with comprehensive knowledge of the efficient AI-based methods for efficient COVID-19 diagnosis. Nearly all the reported methods so far along with their pros and cons as well as recommendations for improvements are discussed, including image acquisition, segmentation, classification, and follow-up diagnosis phases developed between 2019 and 2020. AI and machine learning technologies have boosted the accuracy of Covid-19 diagnosis, and most of the widely used deep learning methods have been implemented and worked well with a small amount of data for COVID-19 diagnosis. This review presents a detailed mythological analysis for the evaluation of AI-based methods used in the process of detecting COVID-19 from medical images. However, due to the quick outbreak of Covid-19, there are not many ground-truth datasets available for the communities. It is necessary to combine clinical experts' observations and information from images to have a reliable and efficient COVID-19 diagnosis.

The study uses the retrospective analysis of space-time scan statistic to detect the clusters of COVID-19 in mainland China with a different maximum clustering radius at the family-level based on case dates of onset. The results show that the detected clusters vary with the clustering radius. Forty-three space-time clusters were detected with a maximum clustering radius of 100 km and 88 clusters with a maximum clustering radius of 10 km from 2 December 2019 to 20 June 2020. Using a smaller clustering radius may identify finer clusters. Hubei has the most clusters regardless of scale. In addition, most of the clusters were generated in February. That indicates China’s COVID-19 epidemic prevention and control strategy is effective, and they have successfully prevented the virus from spreading from Hubei to other provinces over time. Well-developed provinces or cities, which have larger populations and developed transportation networks, are more likely to generate space-time clusters. The analysis based on the data of cases from onset may detect the start times of clusters seven days earlier than similar research based on diagnosis dates. Our analysis of space-time clustering based on the data of cases on the family-level can be reproduced in other countries that are still seriously affected by the epidemic such as the USA, India, and Brazil, thus providing them with more precise signals of clustering.","Xu, Min; Cao, Chunxiang; Zhang, Xin; Lin, Hui; Yao, Zhong; Zhong, Shaobo; Huang, Zhibin; Shea Duerler, Robert",Int J Environ Res Public Health,126,1

We examined the following COVID-19 outcomes within federal penitentiaries and contrasted them with the overall population in the penitentiaries' respective provincial jurisdictions: testing, prevalence, the proportion recovered, and fatality. Methods: Data for prisons were obtained from the Correctional Service of Canada and, for the general population, from COVID-19 Esri Canadian Outbreak Tracking Hub. Data were retrieved between March 30 and April 21, 2020, and are accurate to this date. Penitentiary-, province- and sex-specific frequency statistics for each outcome were calculated. Results: Data on 50 of 51 penitentiaries (98%) were available. Of these, 72% of penitentiaries reported fewer tests per 1000 population than the Canadian general population average (16 tests/1000 population), and 24% of penitentiaries reported zero tests. Penitentiaries with high levels of testing were those that already had elevated COVID-19 prevalence. Five penitentiaries reported an outbreak (at least one case). Hardest hit penitentiaries were those in Quebec and British Columbia, with some prisons reporting COVID-19 prevalence of 30% to 40%. Of these, two were women's prisons. Female prisoners were over-represented among cases (31% of cases overall, despite representing 5% of the total prison population). Conclusion: Increased sentinel or universal testing may be appropriate given the confined nature of prison populations. This, along with rigorous infection prevention control practices and the potential release of prisoners, will be needed to curb current outbreaks and those likely to come.","Blair, A.; Parnia, A.; Siddiqi, A.",,126,3

Thus, coaches had to face with the novel challenge of minimizing the potential decline in fitness during this period of training disruption. METHODS: In this observational pre- to posttest study involving Norwegian female football players (18.8 ± 1.9 years, height 1.68 ± 0.4 m, mass 61.3 ± 3.7 kg), we investigated the effects of a prescribed home-based and group-based intervention, implemented during the COVID-19 lockdown, on maximal muscular force production and high velocity variables. Specifically, maximal partial squat strength one repetition maximum (1RM), counter movement jump (CMJ) and 15 m sprint time were assessed 1 week prior to the lockdown and 12 weeks after the onset of lockdown. We also collected training content and volume from the prescribed training program and self-reported perceived training quality and motivation toward training. RESULTS: We observed no change in 1RM [pretest: 104 ± 12 kg, posttest: 101 ± 11 kg (P = 0.28)], CMJ height [pretest: 28.1 ± 2.3 cm, posttest: 26.8 ± 1.9 (P = 0.09)], and 15 m sprint time [pretest: 2.60 ± 0.08 s, posttest: 2.61 ± 0.07 s (P = 0.52)]. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that a prescribed home-based and group-based intervention with increased training time devoted to strength, jump, and sprint ability, and regulated to obtain a sufficient infection control level is feasible and effective to preserve strength, jumping, and sprinting abilities of high-level female football players during a ∼ 3-month period of a pandemic-induced lockdown.","Pedersen, Sigurd; Johansen, Dag; Casolo, Andrea; Randers, Morten B.; Sagelv, Edvard H.; Welde, Boye; Winther, Andreas Kjæreng; Pettersen, Svein Arne",Front Physiol,126,16

This collaboration should be within the framework of the International Health Regulations. Collaboration between countries should be encouraged in a way that acknowledges the benefits that derive from sharing biological material and establishing equitable collaborative research partnerships. The focus of pandemic preparedness should include upstream prevention through better collaboration between human and animal health sciences to enhance capacity to identify potential pathogens before they become serious human threats, and to prevent their emergence where possible.

In this study, we aimed to examine the preventative effects of the antiviral drug remdesivir on pulmonary fibrosis. We used a mouse model of bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis to evaluate the effects of remdesivir on pulmonary fibrosis in vivo and further explored the potential pharmacological mechanisms of remdesivir in lung fibroblasts and alveolar epithelial cells in vitro. The preventive remdesivir treatment was started on the day of bleomycin installation, and the results showed that remdesivir significantly alleviated bleomycin-induced collagen deposition and improved pulmonary function. In vitro experiments showed that remdesivir dose-dependently suppressed TGF-β1-induced lung fibroblast activation and improved TGF-β1-induced alveolar epithelial to mesenchymal transition. Our results indicate that remdesivir can preventatively alleviate the severity of pulmonary fibrosis and provide some reference for the prevention of pulmonary fibrosis in patients with COVID-19.","Li, Xiaohe; Liu, Rui; Cui, Yunyao; Liang, Jingjing; Bi, Zhun; Li, Shimeng; Miao, Yang; Zhang, Liang; Li, Xiaoping; Zhou, Honggang; Yang, Cheng",Front Pharmacol,126,15

OBJECTIVES: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2–related multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children is frequently associated with shock; endothelial involvement may be one of the underlying mechanisms. We sought to describe endothelial dysfunction during multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children with shock and then assess the relationship between the degree of endothelial involvement and the severity of shock. DESIGN: Observational study. SETTING: A PICU in a tertiary hospital. PATIENTS: Patients aged under 18 (n = 28) with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2–related multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children and shock, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Correlations between endothelial marker levels and shock severity were assessed using Spearman coefficient. The median (interquartile range) age was 9 years (7.5–11.2 yr). Sixteen children presented with cardiogenic and distributive shock, 10 presented with cardiogenic shock only, and two presented with distributive shock only. The median left ventricular ejection fraction, troponin level, and lactate level were, respectively, 40% (35–45%), 261 ng/mL (131–390 ng/mL), and 3.2 mmol/L (2–4.2 mmol/L). Twenty-five children received inotropes and/or vasopressors; the median Vasoactive and Inotropic Score was 8 (5–28).

An outbreak in an elderly care home occurred in our county at the time of the second vaccination. We describe a package of measures to control the outbreak and to prevent a spill over into the general population. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: After outbreak confirmation, a package of measures such as quarantine of the elderly care home, staff and visitors, and their households was implemented. By sequential testing, quarantine measures were lifted. Surveillance of staff and residents by rapid antigen test and symptom monitoring was used in parallel. RESULTS: The outbreak was on-going for around 17 days until it was noticed by a symptomatic external staff member as index case. A total of 23 out of 96 residents (24.0%) and nine out of 114 staff (7.9%) were infected. Three residents died. Effective first-dose vaccine coverage was 85.4% in residents, 27.4% in internal, and 10.5% in external staff. Given the long latency period, the use of household quarantine prevented a spill over into the public. Already 16 days after notification of the index case the outbreak could be declared over. CONCLUSIONS: Interferences between vaccination coverage and outbreak characteristics in regard to an extended latency period were observed. Household quarantine of case as well as contact households is of increased importance in the era of vaccination to prevent further spread into the general population until population-based control measures and lockdowns can be lifted.","Weigl, Josef A.

We have conducted a study to detect bacterial contamination of room surfaces and room air during CT colonography and confirm the efficacy of room disinfection procedures carried out between examinations. METHODS: Systematic sampling of the CT examination couch and horizontal surfaces 1 m and 3 m from the couch was performed before and after patient examinations. A 1 m3 sample of room air was obtained during patient examinations. Samples were processed using routine laboratory methods. A case-control study design was used (30 CT colonography and 30 routine body CT scans). RESULTS: Evidence of airborne dissemination of bacteria was detected in >30% of CT colonography examinations and <10% of control examinations (p = 0.01). No pathogenic bacteria were detected in surface samples taken before patient examinations. CONCLUSION: The room disinfection policy in use in our CT department is effective in eliminating pathogenic bacteria from surfaces in the patient environment. CT colonography causes contamination of room air with enteric bacteria in a significant proportion of cases. ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: CT colonography may possibly be an aerosol-generating procedure.

Ivermectin is a putative antiviral compound; the proposed mechanism is the inhibition of nuclear translocation of viral proteins, facilitated by mammalian host importins, a necessary process for propagation of infections. We systematically reviewed the evidence for the applicability of ivermectin against viral infections including SARS‐CoV‐2 regarding efficacy, mechanisms and selective toxicity. The SARS‐CoV‐2 genome was mined to determine potential nuclear location signals for ivermectin and meta‐analyses for in vivo studies included all comparators over time, dose range and viral replication in multiple organs. Ivermectin inhibited the replication of many viruses including those in Flaviviridae, Circoviridae and Coronaviridae families in vitro. Real and mock nuclear location signals were identified in SARS‐CoV‐2, a potential target for ivermectin and predicting a sequestration bait for importin β, stopping infected cells from reaching a virus‐resistant state. While pharmacokinetic evaluations indicate that ivermectin could be toxic if applied based on in vitro studies, inhibition of viral replication in vivo was shown for Porcine circovirus in piglets and Suid herpesvirus in mice. Overall standardized mean differences and 95% confidence intervals for ivermectin versus controls were −4.43 (−5.81, −3.04), p < 0.00001. Based on current results, the potential for repurposing ivermectin as an antiviral agent is promising. However, further work is needed to reconcile in vitro studies with clinical efficacy. Developing ivermectin as an additional antiviral agent should be pursued with an emphasis on pre‐clinical trials in validated models of infection.","Kinobe, Robert T.; Owens, Leigh",Fundam Clin Pharmacol,126,20

The intensity of treatment is currently guided by cytogenetic and molecular genetic risk classifications; however, these incompletely predict outcomes, requiring additional information for more accurate predictions. Objective We aimed to identify potential prognostic implications of epigenetic modification of histone proteins in relation to driver mutations in chromatin, splicing and transcriptional regulators in adult-onset acute lymphoblastic (ALL) and myeloid leukemia (AML). Design Bone marrow (BM) and peripheral blood (PB) samples were collected from 114 newly diagnosed B-cell ALL, 14 T-cell ALL, and 241 AML patients who were admitted at the MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC) between September 1991 and March 2007. Proteomic profiling was performed using reverse phase protein array and additional mutational analysis was performed on 65 AML BM aspirates. Setting H3K4Me2, H3K4Me3 and H3K27Me3 levels were evaluated along with the expression of 227 other protein antibodies at time of diagnosis. Patients or other participants Patient's ages ranged from 16 to 81 years (median=40±16) in ALL and from 17 to 87 years (median=64±16) in AML. Interventions Patients were treated according to standard MDACC treatment protocols. Main outcome measures Overall survival was considered as the primary study outcome. Results H3K4Me2, H3K4Me3 and H3K27Me3 were significantly higher in AML than in ALL. In AML, greater loss of H3K27Me3 was associated with increased proliferative potential and shorter overall survival in the whole patient population (HR=0.64, 95%CI=0.47-0.87, p=0.004) and in subsets, e.g. cytogenetically normal AML (HR=0.62, 95%CI=0.40-0.97, p=0.03) and IDH1 mutated patients (HR=0.21, 95%CI=0.062-0.72, p=0.009). H3K27Me3 was lower in ASXL1, BCOR, U2AF1 and SRSF2 mutated subgroups (p<0.05). Moreover, AML patients with decreased H3K27Me3 demonstrated an upregulated anti-apoptotic phenotype. In ALL, levels of histone methylation correlated with response to tyrosine kinase inhibitor in patients who carried the Philadelphia cytogenetic aberration and prior smoking behavior. Conclusions Proteomic profiling of histone modifications has clinical implications in acute leukemia and support the idea that epigenetic patterns contribute to a more accurate picture of the leukemic state and complement cytogenetic and molecular genetic subgrouping. H3K27Me3 measurement might be a suitable method to improve acute leukemia outcome prediction and subsequent treatment intensity stratification in selected subgroups.","Dijk, Anneke van; Hoff, Fieke; Qiu, Yihua; Jabbour, Elias; Bont, Eveline de; Bruggeman, Sophia; Horton, Terzah; Kornblau, Steven",Clinical Lymphoma Myeloma and Leukemia,126,20

The present study reports on the safety and outcome of durvalumab use after CRT in a real-world, multicenter, retrospective cohort. METHODS: Two hundred thirty-eight patients have been included. We collected data on systemic therapy, radiation therapy, the timing between CRT and durvalumab, number of durvalumab cycles, reasons for non-starting or discontinuation, incidence and grade of adverse events (AEs), and progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). RESULTS: One hundred fifty-five patients out of 238 (65.1%) received at least one durvalumab dose: 91 (58.7%) after concomitant CRT (cCRT) and 64 (41.3%) after sequential CRT (sCRT). Programmed-death ligand 1 (PD-L1) status was unknown in 7/155 (4.5%), negative in 14 (9.1%), and positive ≥1% in 134/155 (86.4%). The main reasons for non-starting durvalumab were progression (10.1%), PD-L1 negativity (7.5%), and lung toxicity (4.6%). Median follow-up time was 14 months (range 2–29); 1-year PFS and OS were 83.5% (95%CI: 77.6–89.7) and 97.2% (95%CI: 94.6–99.9), respectively. No significant differences in PFS or OS were detected for cCRT vs. sCRT, but the median PFS was 13.5 months for sCRT vs. 23 months for cCRT. Potentially immune-related AEs were recorded in 76/155 patients (49.0%). Pneumonitis was the most frequent, leading to discontinuation in 11/155 patients (7.1%). CONCLUSIONS: Durvalumab maintenenace after concurrent or sequential chemoradiation for unresectable, stage III NSCLC showed very promising short-term survival results in a large, multicenter, restrospective, real-world study. Durvalumab was the first drug obtaining a survival benefit over CRT within the past two decades, and the present study contributes to validating its use in clinical practice.","Bruni, Alessio; Scotti, Vieri; Borghetti, Paolo; Vagge, Stefano; Cozzi, Salvatore; D’Angelo, Elisa; Giaj Levra, Niccolò; Fozza, Alessandra; Taraborrelli, Maria; Piperno, Gaia; Vanoni, Valentina; Sepulcri, Matteo; Trovò, Marco; Nardone, Valerio; Lattanzi, Elisabetta; Bou Selman, Said; Bertolini, Federica; Franceschini, Davide; Agustoni, Francesco; Jereczek-Fossa, Barbara Alicja; Magrini, Stefano Maria; Livi, Lorenzo; Lohr, Frank; Filippi, Andrea Riccardo",Front Oncol,126,14

Using additions to nonaccruals to measure credit quality, we find a linear association with provisions, that controlling for charge-offs induces misspecification, and no evidence of provision asymmetry.

The initial epidemiological investigations showed that COVID-19 occurred more likely in adults, with patients younger than 10 years old accounting for less than 1% of the total number of confirmed cases, and infant infections were more rare. In our case, we present an infant who was only 35 days old when he was tested positive for COVID-19. PATIENT CONCERNS: In this report, a 35 day-old male infant with atypical symptoms had close contact with 2 confirmed patients of COVID-19 who were his grandmother and mother. DIAGNOSIS: The patient was diagnosed as COVID-19 after his oropharyngeal swab tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assay. INTERVENTIONS: The therapeutic schedule included aerosol inhalation of recombinant human interferon α-2b and supportive therapy. OUTCOMES: Two consecutive (1 day apart) oropharyngeal swabs tested negative for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; then, the patient was discharged on February 27, 2020. LESSONS: Strengthening infants’ virus screening in families with infected kins is important for early diagnosis, isolation, and treatment when symptoms are atypical. The infectivity of infants with mild or asymptomatic COVID-19 should not be ignored because this may be a source of transmission in the community.","Cao, Wen; Mai, Gang; Liu, Zhen; Ren, Haoyuan",Medicine (Baltimore),126,6

Apart from its known acute respiratory involvements, the CNS manifestations of COVID-19 are common. These neurological symptoms are diverse and could range from mild nonspecific or specific symptoms such as the loss of various sensory perceptions, the worrying autoimmune Guillain–Barré syndrome, to the life-threatening acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, and the CNS-mediated respiratory distress. An autopsy report documented the presence of SARS-CoV2 in brain tissues of a COVID-19 patient. However, there is no definite conclusion on the mechanisms of SARS-CoV2 neuroinvasion. These proposed mechanisms include the direct viral invasion, the systemic blood circulation, or the distribution of infected immune cells. Concerning these different neuropathophysiologies, COVID-19 patients who are presenting with either the early-onset, multiple, and severe CNS symptoms or rapid respiratory deterioration should be suspected for the direct viral neuroinvasion, and appropriate management options should be considered. This article reviews the neurological manifestations, the proposed neuroinvasive mechanisms, and the potential neurological sequelae of SARS-CoV2.","Gasmi, Amin; Tippairote, Torsak; Mujawdiya, Pavan Kumar; Gasmi Benahmed, Asma; Menzel, Alain; Dadar, Maryam; Bjørklund, Geir",Mol Neurobiol,126,1

The need for IgG/IgM combined antibody test is booming, but data on diagnostic indexes evaluation was inadequate. The aim of this study was to evaluate diagnostic indexes of a rapid IgG/IgM combined antibody test for SARS-CoV-2. Methods A total of 179 patients were enrolled. Serum were collected for IgG-IgM combined antibody test and corresponding nasal and pharyngeal swab specimens were collected for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR. According to SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR results, patients under study were categorized as PCR positive group in 90 patients and PCR negative group in 89 patients. Results 1. Of the 90 PCR positive samples, 77 were tested positive by SARS-CoV-2 IgG-IgM test kit, yielding a sensitivity of 85.6%. Meanwhile, of the 89 PCR negative sample, 8 samples were detected positive, resulting in a specificity of 91%. Positive predictive value, negative predictive value and accuracy of this test kit was 95.1%, 82.7%, and 88.3%, respectively. Kappa efficiency between IgG/IgM test kit and RT-PCR were 0.75. 2. Accuracy in mild/common and severe/critical subgroup were 73.9% and 97.7%, respectively. Accuracy in clinical confirmed, suspected cases and other disease subgroups were 70%, 60%, and 100%, respectively. 3. Patients were further divided into 0-7, 8-15 and >= 16 groups according to the time from illness onset to sample collection. Sensitivity, specificity and accuracy in these three groups were 18.8%, 77.8% and 40%; 100%, 50% and 87.5%; 100%, 64.3%, and 93.9, respectively. Conclusion The sensitivity and specificity of this ease-of-use IgG/IgM combined test kit were adequate, plus short turnaround time, no specific requirements for additional equipment or skilled technicians, all of these collectively contributed to its competence for mass testing. At the current stage, it cannot take the place of SARA-CoV-2 nucleic acid RT-PCR, but can be served as a complementary option for RT-PCR. The combination of RT-PCR and IgG-IgM combined test kit could provide further insight into SARS-CoV-2 infection diagnosis.","Liu, Ying; Liu, Yueping; Diao, Bo; Ren, Feifei; Wang, Yue; Ding, Jinya; Huang, Qianchuan",,126,1

We leveraged the registry data to perform an exponential random graph model (ERGM) network analysis to examine demographic and symptomological homophilies of SARS-CoV-2 transmission networks in Hokkaido and Kanagawa. Our analysis showed: (1) Age, symptom, and asymptomatic status homophilies in both prefectures; (2) Asymptomatic infections increased as the virus was passed from primary cases to secondary and tertiary ones; (3) Transmission was mostly seen at the primary and secondary levels, with none occurring beyond quaternary; (4) Transmission occurred primarily in healthcare settings, as well as in families. ABSTRACT: Kanagawa and Hokkaido were affected by COVID-19 in the early stage of the pandemic. Japan’s initial response included contact tracing and PCR analysis on anyone who was suspected of having been exposed to SARS-CoV-2. In this retrospective study, we analyzed publicly available COVID-19 registry data from Kanagawa and Hokkaido (n = 4392). Exponential random graph model (ERGM) network analysis was performed to examine demographic and symptomological homophilies. Age, symptomatic, and asymptomatic status homophilies were seen in both prefectures. Symptom homophilies suggest that nuanced genetic differences in the virus may affect its epithelial cell type range and can result in the diversity of symptoms seen in individuals infected by SARS-CoV-2. Environmental variables such as temperature and humidity may also play a role in the overall pathogenesis of the virus. A higher level of asymptomatic transmission was observed in Kanagawa. Moreover, patients who contracted the virus through secondary or tertiary contacts were shown to be asymptomatic more frequently than those who contracted it from primary cases. Additionally, most of the transmissions stopped at the primary and secondary levels. As expected, significant viral transmission was seen in healthcare settings.","Andalibi, Ali; Koizumi, Naoru; Li, Meng-Hao; Siddique, Abu Bakkar",Biology (Basel),126,26

METHOD: In total, 231 patients with COVID-19 disease were included in the study. D-dimer levels were estimated using immunoturbidimetric assay with normal range of 0-500 μg/mL. In the current research, the primary outcome was the in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: In the present research, 39 (16.8%) COVID-19 cases died during the index hospitalization. In a multivariable analysis; age, D-dimer (3(rd) day) (OR: 1.00, 95% CI: 1.00-1.00, p<0.001), WBC count, and creatinine were independent predictors of the in-hospital death for COVID-19 cases. The ideal value of D-dimer level on the 3(rd) day of hospitalization was 774 μq/mL (area under curve (AUC): 0.903, 95% CI: 0.836-0.968; p<0.01) with sensitivity of 83.2% and specificity of 83.6%. It was noted that D-dimer level on the 3(rd) day of hospitalization had a higher sensitivity (83.2% vs 67.6%, respectively) and AUC value than that of D-dimer level on admission (0.903 vs 0.799, respectively). CONCLUSION: The main finding in this investigation was that D-dimer elevation on the 3(rd) of hospitalization is more sensitive predictor of in-hospital mortality than D-dimer elevation on admission in COVID-19 patients. Even though further investigations are needed to forecast precise prognosis in patients with COVID-19 disease in terms of D-dimer levels, we believe that D-dimer levels on the 3(rd) day of hospitalization have an enhanced potential to be used as a prognostic marker in routine clinical practice.","Selcuk, Murat; Cinar, Tufan; Gunay, Nuran; Keskin, Muhammed; Cicek, Vedat; Kilic, Sahhan; Asal, Süha; Orhan, Ahmet L.",Medeni Med J,126,17

However, there is limited evidence on this issue in Thailand. We aimed to evaluate the association of economic burden during the first phase of the pandemic and the risk of adverse mental health outcomes in the Thai population. METHODS: We recruited 2,303 participants aged 18 years or above with employment/full‐time jobs before the national lockdown in April–May 2020. The measures of economic burden were job loss, income loss, and financial problems related to the outbreak. The outcomes included depressive symptoms, anxiety, and perceived stress. The association between economic burden and adverse mental health outcomes was evaluated using multivariable logistic regression models. RESULTS: Individuals who lost their jobs during the COVID‐19 pandemic had a higher risk of perceived stress compared to those who maintained their job (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 2.40; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.28–4.51; p = .006). A higher risk of anxiety was observed in individuals with a monthly income loss of 50% (adjusted OR, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.03–1.99; p = .035; individuals without income loss, reference group) or over. Self‐reported financial problems were significantly associated with adverse mental health outcomes (nonexperienced financial problems, reference group): Adjusted ORs of 1.84 (95% CI, 1.34–2.51; p < .001) for depressive symptoms, 2.00 (95% CI, 1.48–2.71; p < .001) for anxiety, and 2.12 (95% CI, 1.51–2.95; p < .001) for perceived stress. CONCLUSIONS: Economic burden, especially self‐reported financial problems, was associated with adverse mental health outcomes. However, long‐term studies are needed to address the mental health consequences of COVID‐19 and economic downturns.","Ruengorn, Chidchanok; Awiphan, Ratanaporn; Wongpakaran, Nahathai; Wongpakaran, Tinakon; Nochaiwong, Surapon",Depress Anxiety,126,29

However, this is not observed in nature. Similarly, the order of nucleotides is not random (e.g., in the human genome, guanine follows cytosine at a frequency of ~0.0125, or a quarter the number of times predicted by random representation). Codon usage and codon order are also nonrandom. Furthermore, nucleotide and codon biases vary between species. Such biases have various drivers, including cellular proteins that recognize specific patterns in nucleic acids, that once triggered, induce mutations or invoke intrinsic or innate immune responses. In this review we examine the types of compositional biases identified in viral genomes and current understanding of the evolutionary mechanisms underpinning these trends.

Additionally, whether kidney outcomes have evolved during the course of the pandemic is unknown. METHODS: We used electronic records to identify COVID-19 patients with and without AKI admitted to 3 New York Hospitals between March 2 and August 25, 2020. Outcomes included AKI overall and according to admission week, AKI stage, the requirement for new renal replacement therapy (RRT), mortality and recovery of kidney function. Logistic regression was utilized to assess associations of patient characteristics and outcomes. RESULTS: Out of 4732 admissions 1386 (29.3%) patients had AKI. Among those with AKI, 717 (51.7%) had Stage 1, 132 (9.5%) Stage 2, 537 (38.7%) stage 3, and 237 (17.1%) required RRT initiation. In March 536/1648 (32.5%) of patients developed AKI compared with 15/87 (17.2%) in August (P<0.001 for monthly trend) whereas RRT initiation was required in 6.9% and 0% of admission, in March and August respectively. Mortality was higher with than without AKI (51.6% vs 8.6%) and was 71.9% in individuals requiring RRT. However, most patients with AKI who survived hospitalization (77%) recovered to within 0.3 mg/dL of baseline creatinine. Among those surviving to discharge, 62% discontinued RRT. CONCLUSIONS: AKI impacts a high proportion of admitted COVID-19 patients and is associated with high mortality, particularly when RRT is required. AKI incidence appears to be decreasing over time and kidney function frequently recovers in those who survive.","Charytan, David M.; Parnia, Sam; Khatri, Minesh; Petrilli, Christopher M.; Jones, Simon; Benstein, Judith; Horwitz, Leora I.",Kidney Int Rep,126,1

As the clinical symptoms of MERS tend to be non-specific, the incubation period has been shown to complement differential diagnosis, especially to rule out influenza. However, because an infection event is seldom directly observable, the present study aims to construct a diagnostic model that predicts the probability of MERS diagnosis given the time from immigration to illness onset among imported cases which are suspected of MERS. Addressing censoring by considering the transmission dynamics in an exporting country, we demonstrate that the illness onset within 2 days from immigration is suggestive of influenza. Two exceptions to suspect MERS even for those with illness onset within 2 days since immigration are (i) when we observe substantial community transmissions of MERS and (ii) when the cases are at high risk of MERS (e.g. cases with close contact in hospital or household). It is vital to collect the information of the incubation period upon emergence of a novel infectious disease, and moreover, in our model, the fundamental transmission dynamics including the initial growth rate has to be explored to differentiate the disease diagnoses with non-specific symptoms.","Ejima, Keisuke; Aihara, Kazuyuki; Nishiura, Hiroshi",J Theor Biol,126,9

Students are more engaged with online activities, which may affect their mental health. Therefore, the present study aims to investigate the magnitude of psychological health of the Bangladeshi students, where the role of online use behaviors is also investigated. METHODS: An online‐based cross‐sectional survey was conducted between 7 October 2020 and 2 November, 2020 among Bangladeshi students utilizing a convenience sampling technique. The survey questionnaire included items concerning sociodemographics, behavior and health‐related variables, online use behaviors, Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ‐2), and Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD‐2). Descriptive and inferential statistics were used to present the data (i.e., binary logistic regression was performed to examine the association between variables and hierarchical regression analysis was performed to predict the variance for depression and anxiety). RESULTS: Out of 601 included students, 260 and 196 students reported the symptoms of depression (43.3%) and anxiety (32.6%), respectively, where female students experienced a higher level of psychological problems. The psychological suffering was also significantly associated with medical college students, having an affair, less sleep time, not performing physical exercise, excessive internet use, and not watching news during online activities. After adjusting all of the studied variables in the hierarchical regression models, it explained 10% and 9.6% variance of depression and anxiety, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: During this pandemic situation, a relatively higher level of psychological complications was observed among the Bangladeshi students. Regrettably, any specific policy was absent in the country to assuage that outcome.

After immunization, the specific antibodies are transported to the egg yolk from which the antibodies then can be purified. A laying hen produces more than 20 g of yolk antibodies (IgY) per year. These antibodies also have biochemical properties that make them attractive for peroral immunotherapy: They neither activate mammalian complement nor interact with mammalian Fc receptors that could mediate inflammatory response in the gastrointestinal tract.

A subset of adverse childhood experiences, household dysfunction [(HHD) e.g.; parental substance use, mental illness, incarceration, suicide, intimate partner violence, separation/divorce, homelessness], are robust predictors of behavioral disorders; however, few studies have investigated the link between HHD and PIU and PSU and potential protective factors, such as social support, among students. Methods: Data are from a diverse California student sample (N = 1027). The Smartphone Addiction Scale—Short Version and Internet Addiction Test assessed dimensions of addiction. Regression models tested associations between students’ level of HHD (No HHD, 1–3 HHD, ≥4 HHD) and PSU and PIU, and the role of extrafamilial social support in these relationships, adjusting for age, gender, ethnicity, SES, employment loss due to COVID-19, and depression. Results: Compared to students reporting no HHD, students with ≥4 HHD had twice the odds (AOR: 2.03, 95% CI: 1.21–3.40) of meeting criteria for PSU, while students with 1–3 HHD and ≥4 HHD had three and six times the odds of moderate to severe PIU (AORs: 2.03–2.46, CI:1.21–3.96) after adjusting for covariates. Extrafamilial social support was inversely associated with PIU and moderated the HHD–PSU association for students with 1–3 HHD.

Mutations in MECP2 cause neurodevelopmental disorders including Rett syndrome (RTT). MECP2 exon 2 is spliced into two alternative messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) isoforms encoding MECP2-E1 or MECP2-E2 protein isoforms that differ in their N-termini. MECP2-E2, isolated first, was used to define the general roles of MECP2 in methyl-deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) binding, targeting of transcriptional regulatory complexes, and its disease-causing impact in RTT. It was later found that MECP2-E1 is the most abundant isoform in the brain and its exon 1 is also mutated in RTT. MECP2 transcripts undergo alternative polyadenylation generating mRNAs with four possible 3′untranslated region (UTR) lengths ranging from 130 to 8600 nt. Together, the exon and 3′UTR isoforms display remarkable abundance disparity across cell types and tissues during development. These findings indicate discrete means of regulation and suggest that protein isoforms perform non-overlapping roles. Multiple regulatory programs have been explored to explain these disparities. DNA methylation patterns of the MECP2 promoter and first intron impact MECP2-E1 and E2 isoform levels. Networks of microRNAs and RNA-binding proteins also post-transcriptionally regulate the stability and translation efficiency of MECP2 3′UTR isoforms. Finally, distinctions in biophysical properties in the N-termini between MECP2-E1 and E2 lead to variable protein stabilities and DNA binding dynamics. This review describes the steps taken from the discovery of MECP2, the description of its key functions, and its association with RTT, to the emergence of evidence revealing how MECP2 isoforms are differentially regulated at the transcriptional, post-transcriptional and post-translational levels.","Rodrigues, Deivid Carvalho; Mufteev, Marat; Ellis, James",Hum Mol Genet,126,20

The model itself is a compartmental model in which each compartment is divided into a number of age-groups. The parameter of the model are estimated using an optimisation scheme and some known results from the theory of monotone systems such that the model output agrees with some collected data on the spread of SARS-CoV-2. To highlight the strengths of this framework, a few case studies are presented in which different populations are subjected to different containment strategies. They include cases in which the containment policies switch between scenarios with different levels of severity. Then a case study on herd immunity due to vaccination is presented. And then it is shown how we can use this framework to optimality distribute a limited number of vaccine units in a given population to maximise their impact and lower the total number of infectious individuals.","Bokharaie, V.",,126,10

While rapidly emerging evidence indicates a deterioration of mental health in general, it remains unknown whether the pandemic will have an impact on GD in mental health. To this end, we investigate the association of the pandemic and its countermeasures affecting everyday life, labor, and households with changes in GD in aggression, anxiety, depression, and the somatic symptom burden. We analyze cross-sectional data from 10,979 individuals who live in Germany and who responded to the online survey “Life with Corona” between October 1, 2020 and February 28, 2021. We estimate interaction effects from generalized linear models. The analyses reveal no pre-existing GD in aggression but exposure to COVID-19 and COVID-19 countermeasures is associated with sharper increases in aggression in men than in women. GD in anxiety decreased among participants with children in the household (with men becoming more anxious). We also observe pre-existing and increasing GD with regards to the severity of depression, with women presenting a larger increase in symptoms during the hard lockdown or with increasing stringency. In contrast to anxiety, GD in depression increased among participants who lived without children (women > men), but decreased for individuals who lived with children; here, men converged to the levels of depression presented by women. Finally, GD in somatic symptoms decreased during the hard lockdown (but not with higher stringency), with men showing a sharper increase in symptoms, especially when they lived with children or alone. Taken together, the findings indicate an increase in GD in mental health as the pandemic unfolded in Germany, with rising female vulnerability to depression and increasing male aggression. The combination of these two trends further suggests a worrying mental health situation for singles and families. Our results have important policy implications for the German health system and public health policy. This public health challenge requires addressing the rising burden of pandemic-related mental health challenges and the distribution of this burden between women and men, within families and for individuals who live alone.","Abreu, Liliana; Koebach, Anke; Díaz, Oscar; Carleial, Samuel; Hoeffler, Anke; Stojetz, Wolfgang; Freudenreich, Hanna; Justino, Patricia; Brück, Tilman",Front Psychol,126,16

Alveolar macrophages (AMs) mount cellular defenses against IAV and MRSA infection, which occurs via the nucleotide‐binding domain‐like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome. However, the activity and function of the NLRP3 inflammasome in MRSA pneumonia secondary to IAV infection remain unclear. To clarify this, we studied MRSA infection secondary to IAV both in vitro and in mouse model. The expression of the NLRP3 inflammasome was evaluated by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, immunofluorescence, Western blot, and enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay. The lung pathology and the rate of weight change were observed. We found that IAV infection for 1 week activated NLRP3 inflammasome. The enhanced expression of NLRP3, caspase‐1, and cleaved caspase‐1 was associated with MRSA infection secondary to IAV, but the expression of interleukin (IL)‐1β decreased in superinfection with MRSA both in vitro and in vivo. The aggravated inflammatory pathology in MRSA pneumonia secondary to IAV infection was associated with decreased expression of IL‐1β. And increased weight loss in MRSA pneumonia secondary to IAV infection was related to decreased concentration of IL‐1β in serum. It infers that superinfection with MRSA reduces expression of IL‐1β someway, and decreased expression of IL‐1β impairs the host immunity and leads to aggravated pneumonia. These results contributed to our understanding of the detailed activity of the NLRP3 inflammasome, IL‐1β, and their relationship with aggravation of MRSA pneumonia secondary to IAV infection. Immunotherapy targeting the IL‐1β signaling pathway could be possible therapeutic strategy for secondary MRSA pneumonia.","Shi, Yunfeng; Shi, Xiaohan; Liang, Jingjing; Luo, Jinmei; Ba, Junhui; Chen, Jianning; Wu, Benquan",J Med Virol,126,28

Traumatic events (TEs) are frequently experienced within the population and are known to dysregulate the stress response system and to be associated with psychiatric and physical disorders. GPs may feel reluctant to confront TEs for a variety of reasons, such as a lack of sufficient training in trauma-informed care or a fear of causing harm when discussing a patient’s more complicated issues, among others. This perspective paper aims to review the existing studies that support the practice of trauma-informed healthcare and to summarise best practices. Studies have shown that patients appreciate the questions that clinicians ask them about trauma-related issues and that they understand that this can be important for their healthcare. Furthermore, asking about trauma-related issues in a patient-centered and empathic way can result in better doctor–patient relationships, which improves the levels of satisfaction of both the patient and the doctor with the consultation, as well as improved health-related outcomes. As past traumatic experiences increase the risk of developing post-traumatic stress disorder on exposure to a new TE, the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic has led to trauma-informed care becoming even more important if the strategy is to continue to invest in preventive medicine.","Tomaz, Teresa; Castro-Vale, Ivone",Healthcare (Basel),126,32

We have conducted this systematic review and meta-analysis on efficacy and safety of the drug FVP as a treatment for COVID-19. METHODS: Databases like Pubmed, Pubmed Central, Scopus, Embase, Google Scholar, preprint sites, and clinicaltirals.gov were searched. The studies with the standard of care (SOC) and FVP as a treatment drug were considered as the treatment group and the SOC with other antivirals and supportive care as the control group. Quantitative synthesis was done using RevMan 5.4. Clinical improvement, negative conversion of reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), adverse effects, and oxygen requirements were studied. RESULTS: We identified a total of 1798 studies after searching the electronic databases. Nine in the qualitative studies and four studies in the quantitative synthesis met the criteria. There was a significant clinical improvement in the FVP group on the 14th day compared to the control group (RR 1.29, 1.08–1.54). Clinical deterioration rates were less likely in the FVP group though statistically not significant (OR 0.59, 95% CI 0.30–1.14) at the endpoint of study (7–15 days).

Following the optimization of the incubation conditions, the quantification of the encapsulated lysozyme was performed to evaluate the encapsulation efficiency of each FIL-based system. The release of the protein was tested applying variables such as time, temperature, and ultrasound frequency. The experimental results suggest that the aggregation behavior of FILs is not significantly influenced by the protein and/or protein buffer and supports their application for the design of delivery systems with high encapsulation efficiencies, maintaining the biological activity of either encapsulated and released protein.","Vieira, N.

Using technology like that employed in speech recognition technology, we developed a smartphone-based algorithm for rapid and accurate diagnosis of AECOPD. The algorithm incorporates patient-reported features (age, fever, and new cough), audio data from five coughs and can be deployed by novice users. We compared the accuracy of the algorithm to expert clinical assessment. In patients with known COPD, the algorithm correctly identified the presence of AECOPD in 82.6% (95% CI: 72.9–89.9%) of subjects (n = 86). The absence of AECOPD was correctly identified in 91.0% (95% CI: 82.4–96.3%) of individuals (n = 78). The diagnostic agreement was maintained in milder cases of AECOPD (PPA: 79.2%, 95% CI: 68.0–87.8%), who typically comprise the cohort presenting to primary care.

However, it remains unclear the extent to which observed discriminative performance is attributable to behavioral change after receiving test results. We conducted a retrospective study in a sample of medical interns who received COVID-19 test results from March to December 2020. Our data confirmed that sensor data were able to differentiate between symptomatic COVID-19 positive and negative individuals with good accuracy (area under the curve (AUC) = 0.75). However, removing post-result data substantially reduced discriminative capacity (0.75 to 0.63; delta= −0.12, p=0.013). Removing data in the symptomatic period prior to receipt of test results did not produce similar reductions in discriminative capacity. These findings suggest a meaningful proportion of the discriminative capacity of wearable sensor data for SARS-CoV-2 infection may be due to behavior change after receiving test results.","Cleary, Jennifer L.; Fang, Yu; Sen, Srijan; Wu, Zhenke",medRxiv,126,22

This has been shown to be a major factor in countries that have been successful in containing COVID-19 transmission. Early detection of cases is important, and the use of geospatial technology can support to detect and easily identify potential hotspots that will require timely response. The use of spatial analysis with geographic information systems (GIS) had proved to be effective in providing timely and effective solutions in supporting epidemic response and pandemics over the years. It has developed and evolved rapidly with a complete technological tool for representing data, model construction, visualization and platform construction among others. METHODS: we conducted a geospatial analysis to develop a web mapping application using ArcMap and ArcGIS online to guide and support active case search of potential COVID-19 cases, within 500m radius of COVID-19 confirmed cases to improve detection and testing of suspected cases. RESULTS: the web mapping application tool guides the active case search teams in the field, with clear boundaries on the houses to be visited within 500-meter radius of confirmed positive cases, to conduct active case search of all cases of severe acute respiratory illnesses (SARI), acute respiratory illnesses (ARI), pneumonia etc, to detect and test for COVID-19 towards containing the pandemic. CONCLUSION: the use of GIS and spatial statistical tools have become an important and valuable tool in decision-making and, more importantly, guiding health care professional and other stakeholders in the response being carried out in a more coherent and easy manner. It has proven to be effective in supporting the active case search process to rapidly detect, test and isolate cases during the process, towards containing the COVID-19 pandemic.","Bello, Isah Mohammed; Moyo, Thandekile Ntombikayise; Munyanyi, Manes; Akpan, Godwin Ubong; Isibor, Irene; Sunganai, Lincoln Charimari; Umar, Abubakar Sadiq; Krishnan, Ravi Shankar Santhana Gopala; Touray, Kebba; Rupfutse, Maxwell; Manangazira, Portia; Ntale, Alex Gasasira; Fussum, Daniel; Mkanda, Pascal",Pan Afr Med J,126,21

The immune responses in the airway that are associated with mortality are poorly understood. Studies of the cellular immunology of the infant airway have traditionally been hindered by the limited sample volumes available from the young, frail children who are admitted to hospital with pneumonia. This is further compounded by the relatively low frequencies of certain immune cell phenotypes that are thought to be critical to the clinical outcome of infection. To address this, we developed a novel in-silico deconvolution method for inferring the frequencies of immune cell phenotypes in the airway of children with different survival outcomes using proteomic data. Methods Using high-resolution mass spectrometry, we identified > 1,000 proteins expressed in the airways of children who were admitted to hospital with clinical pneumonia. 61 of these children were discharged from hospital and survived for more than 365 days after discharge, while 19 died during admission. We used unsupervised learning by random forest to derive protein classification markers that could be used to deconvolve individual immune cell phenotypes. We applied these phenotype-specific signatures to high-resolution mass spectrometry-based proteomic data obtained from airway samples collected at admission from infants and children who were discharged from hospital and survived for at least one year as well as those who died from pneumonia during the course of admission. Main Results We identified protein classification markers for 33 immune cell phenotypes. Eosinophil-associated protein markers were significantly elevated in airway secretions obtained from pneumonia survivors and were downregulated in children who subsequently died. To confirm these results, we analyzed clinical parameters from >10,000 children who had been admitted with pneumonia in the previous 10 years. The results of this retrospective analysis mirrored airway deconvolution data and showed that survivors had significantly elevated eosinophils at admission compared to fatal cases of pneumonia. Conclusions Airway eosinophils appear to be a critical immune cell phenotype for pneumonia survival in infants and young children.","Sande, Charles J; Waeni, Jacqueline M; Njunge, James M; Mutunga, Martin N; Gicheru, Elijah; Kibinge, Nelson K; Gwela, Agnes",bioRxiv,126,20

The purpose of this study was to define lung perfusion changes in COVID-19 cases with DECT, as well as to reveal any possible links between perfusion changes and laboratory findings. METHODS Patients who had a positive RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 and a contrast-enhanced chest DECT examination were included in the study. The pattern and severity of perfusion deficits were evaluated, as well as the relationships between perfusion deficit severity and laboratory results and CT severity ratings. The paired t-test, Wilcoxon test, and Student's t-test were used to examine the changes in variables and perfusion deficits. p < 0.05 was regarded as statistically significant. RESULTS Study population consisted of 40 patients. Mean age was 60.73 ± 14.73 years. All of the patients had perfusion deficits at DECT images. Mean perfusion deficit severity score of the population was 8.45 ± 4.66 (min.-max, 1-19). In 24 patients (60%), perfusion deficits and parenchymal lesions matched completely. In 15 patients (37.5%), there was partial match. D dimer, CRP levels, CT severity score, and perfusion deficit severity score all had a positive correlation. CONCLUSIONS Perfusion deficits are seen not only in opacification areas but also in parenchyma of normal appearance. The CT severity score, CRP, D-dimer, and SpO2 levels of the patients were determined to be related with perfusion deficit severity.

Policy responses have disrupted usual patterns of movement in society, locally and globally, with resultant impacts on national economies and human well-being. These interventions have primarily centred on enforcing lockdowns and introducing social distancing recommendations, leading to questions of trust and competency around the role of institutions and the administrative apparatus of state. This study demonstrates the unequal societal impacts in population movement during a national ‘lockdown’. METHODS: We use nationwide mobile phone movement data to quantify the effect of an enforced lockdown on population mobility by neighbourhood deprivation using an ecological study design. We then derive a mobility index using anonymised aggregated population counts for each neighbourhood (2253 Census Statistical Areas; mean population n=2086) of national hourly mobile phone location data (7.45 million records, 1 March 2020–20 July 2020) for New Zealand (NZ). RESULTS: Curtailing movement has highlighted and exacerbated underlying social and spatial inequalities. Our analysis reveals the unequal movements during ‘lockdown’ by neighbourhood socioeconomic status in NZ. CONCLUSION: In understanding inequalities in neighbourhood movements, we are contributing critical new evidence to the policy debate about the impact(s) and efficacy of national, regional or local lockdowns which have sparked such controversy.","Campbell, Malcolm; Marek, Lukas; Wiki, Jesse; Hobbs, Matthew; Sabel, Clive E; McCarthy, John; Kingham, Simon",J Epidemiol Community Health,126,16

OBJECTIVE: Perform a microbiological diagnosis in COVID19-related cutaneous manifestations. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was performed with 64 patients with cutaneous manifestations associated with COVID-19 who underwent serological and nasopharyngeal reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: Out of the 64 patients, 6 patients had positive RT-PCR, with all of them developing SARS-CoV-2 IgG and 4 of them had positive IgM + IgA. Of the 58 patients with negative RT-PCR, 8 cases had positive IgM + IgA and only one of them had IgG seroconversion. Therefore, the infection was demonstrated in 7 cases (10.9%) and was doubtful in 7 other cases (10.9%) who presented negative RT-PCR and presence of IgA + IgM without subsequent seroconversion of IgG. Fifty patients (78.1%) had negative serological tests. The most frequent cutaneous pattern was pseudo-chilblain (48.4%) followed by maculo-papular pattern (26.6%), urticarial lesions (10.9%), vesicular eruptions (6.3%) and livedoid pattern (4.7%).

To figure out how these actors distorted public opinion and sentiment expressions in the outbreak, this study selected three critical timepoints in the development of the pandemic and conducted a topic-based sentiment analysis for bot-generated and human-generated tweets. The findings show that suspected social bots contributed to as much as 9.27% of COVID-19 discussions on Twitter. Social bots and humans shared a similar trend on sentiment polarity—positive or negative—for almost all topics. For the most negative topics, social bots were even more negative than humans. Their sentiment expressions were weaker than those of humans for most topics, except for COVID-19 in the US and the healthcare system. In most cases, social bots were more likely to actively amplify humans’ emotions, rather than to trigger humans’ amplification. In discussions of COVID-19 in the US, social bots managed to trigger bot-to-human anger transmission.

Thus, the objective of this study was to measure such changes among Asian–American (AA) adults, overall and by ethnic subgroup. METHODS: Using a nationally derived nonprobability sample, 3084 AA adults were recruited, including 1737 East Asian, 570 South Asian, 587 Southeast Asian, and 124 multiethnic Asian adults. Participants completed an online survey with questions related to sociodemographics, health status, and diet and food shopping behaviors, including questions related to COVID‐19.

Amino‐bisphosphonates (N‐BPs) have anti‐inflammatory properties and have been shown to reduce the incidence of lower respiratory infections, cardiovascular events, and cancer. We conducted a population‐based retrospective observational cohort study with the primary objective of determining if oral N‐BPs treatment can play a role in the susceptibility to development of severe COVID‐19. Administrative International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical ModificationI (ICD‐9‐CM) and anatomical‐therapeutic chemical (ATC) code data, representative of Italian population (9% sample of the overall population), were analyzed. Oral N‐BPs (mainly alendronate and risedronate) were included in the analysis, zoledronic acid was excluded because of the low number of patients at risk. Incidence of COVID‐19 hospitalization was 12.32 (95% confidence interval [CI], 9.61–15.04) and 11.55 (95% CI, 8.91–14.20), of intensive care unit (ICU) utilization because of COVID‐19 was 1.25 (95% CI, 0.38–2.11) and 1.42 (95% CI, 0.49–2.36), and of all‐cause death was 4.06 (95% CI, 2.50–5.61) and 3.96 (95% CI, 2.41–5.51) for oral N‐BPs users and nonusers, respectively. Sensitivity analyses that excluded patients with prevalent vertebral or hip fragility fractures and without concomitant glucocorticoid treatment yielded similar results. In conclusion, we found that the incidence of COVID‐19 hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) utilization, and COVID‐19 potentially related mortality were similar in N‐BPs–treated and nontreated subjects. Similar results were found in N‐BPs versus other anti‐osteoporotic drugs. We provide real‐life data on the safety of oral N‐BPs in terms of severe COVID‐19 risk on a population‐based cohort. Our results do not support the hypothesis that oral N‐BPs can prevent COVID‐19 infection and/or severe COVID‐19; however, they do not seem to increase the risk. © 2021 The Authors.

Thus, the study aimed to compare the results of the anti-SARS-CoV-2 tests to evaluate the application of the WHO standard unitage (the binding antibody units; BAU/mL) for a measurement of response to the vaccination. Methods: Patients undergoing vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 with Pfizer/BioNTech BNT162b2 (BNT162b2) (n = 79), referred for SARS-CoV-2 antibody measurement prior to vaccination and 21 days after dose 1, and 8, 14, and 30 days after dose 2 were included. The sera were tested with three assays: Elecsys SARS-CoV-2 S (Roche), LIAISON(®) SARS-CoV-2 TrimericS IgG (DiaSorin), and SARS-CoV-2 IgG II Quant (Abbott). Results: The three assays showed varying correlations at different time points in the study. The overall agreement for all samples was moderate to high (ρ = 0.663–0.902). We observed the most uniform agreement for the day of dose 2 (ρ = 0.775–0.825), while it was least consistent for day 8 (ρ = −0.131–0.693) and 14 (ρ = −0.247–0.603) after dose 2. The dynamics of changes of the SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels in patients without history of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection appears homogenous based on the Roche results, more heterogenous when considering the DiaSorin results, and in between for the Abbott results. Conclusions: The results highlight the need for further work on the international standard of measurement of SARS-CoV-2 Ig, especially in the era of vaccination. The serological assays can be useful to detect IgG/IgM antibodies to assess the response to the vaccination. However, they cannot be used interchangeably. In terms of the evaluation of the immune response to the BNT162b2 vaccine, Roche and Abbott kits appear to be more useful.","Lukaszuk, Krzysztof; Kiewisz, Jolanta; Rozanska, Karolina; Dabrowska, Malgorzata; Podolak, Amira; Jakiel, Grzegorz; Woclawek-Potocka, Izabela; Lukaszuk, Aron; Rabalski, Lukasz",Vaccines (Basel),126,1

It has been shown to be multiphosphorylated. However, the phosphorylation sites are still unknown. In this study, we used liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS) to analyze the phosphorylation sites of N protein expressed in Sf9 cells. The results showed that N protein contains two phosphorylation sites. Since N protein can regulate IL-10, which may facilitate PRRSV replication, we constructed four plasmids (pCA-XH-GD, pCA-A105, pCA-A120 and pCA-A105-120) and transfected them into Pig alveolar macrophages (PAMs,3D4/2). The qPCR results showed that mutations at residues 105 and 120 were associated with down-regulation of the IL-10 mRNA level, potentially decreasing the viral growth ability. Then, we mutated the phosphorylation sites (S105A and S120A) and rescued three mutated viruses, namely, A105, A120 and A105-120. Compared with wild-type virus titers, the titers of the mutated viruses at 48 hpi were significantly decreased. The Nsp(non-structural protein) 9 qPCR results were consistent with the multistep growth kinetics results. The infected PAMs (primary PAMs) results were similar with Marc-145.The findings indicated that the mutations impaired the viral replication ability. The confocal microscopy results suggested that mutations to residues 105 and 120 did not affect N protein distribution. Whether the mutations affected other functions of N protein and what the underlying mechanisms are need further investigation. In conclusion, our results show that residues 105 and 120 are phosphorylation sites and are important for N protein function and for viral replication ability.","Chen, Yao; Xing, Xiulin; Li, Qi; Feng, Songlin; Han, Xiaoliang; He, Shuyi; Zhang, Guihong",Vet Microbiol,126,28

Using protein-protein docking and dynamics simulation, we examined the interactions of five SARS-CoV-2 variations’ receptor-binding domains with the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) receptor in host cells. A comparison of protein-protein docking and dynamics simulations showed that these point mutations significantly altered the structural behavior of the spike (S) protein, affecting RBD binding to hACE2 at the respective sites. Further research is needed to determine whether these changes affect drug–S protein binding and its potential therapeutic impact. ABSTRACT: Since the beginning of the coronavirus 19 (COVID-19) pandemic in late 2019, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been evolving through the acquisition of genomic mutations, leading to the emergence of multiple variants of concern (VOCs) and variants of interest (VOIs). Currently, four VOCs (Alpha, Beta, Delta, and Gamma) and seven VOIs (Epsilon, Zeta, Eta, Theta, Iota, Kappa, and Lambda) of SARS-CoV-2 have been identified in worldwide circulation. Here, we investigated the interactions of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of five SARS-CoV-2 variants with the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) receptor in host cells, to determine the extent of molecular divergence and the impact of mutation, using protein-protein docking and dynamics simulation approaches. Along with the wild-type (WT) SARS-CoV-2, this study included the Brazilian (BR/lineage P.1/Gamma), Indian (IN/lineage B.1.617/Delta), South African (SA/lineage B.1.351/Beta), United Kingdom (UK/lineage B.1.1.7/Alpha), and United States (US/lineage B.1.429/Epsilon) variants. The protein-protein docking and dynamics simulation studies revealed that these point mutations considerably affected the structural behavior of the spike (S) protein compared to the WT, which also affected the binding of RBD with hACE2 at the respective sites. Additional experimental studies are required to determine whether these effects have an influence on drug–S protein binding and its potential therapeutic effect.","Celik, Ismail; Yadav, Rohitash; Duzgun, Zekeriya; Albogami, Sarah; El-Shehawi, Ahmed M.; , Fatimawali; Idroes, Rinaldi; Tallei, Trina Ekawati; Emran, Talha Bin",Biology (Basel),126,20

Fortunately, in recent years perspectives and discourses have changed. More prominence has been given to the rigorous scientific effort that led to the discovery of cannabis’ many physiological actions and endogenous signalling mechanisms. The endocannabinoid system is a complex and heterogeneous pro-homeostatic network comprising different receptors with several endogenous ligands, numerous metabolic enzymes and regulatory proteins. Therefore, it is not surprising that alterations and dysfunctions of the endocannabinoid system are observed in almost every category of disease. Such high degree of pathophysiological involvement suggests the endocannabinoid system is a promising therapeutic target and prompted the translation of resurgent scientific findings into clinical therapies. Shifting attitudes toward cannabis also raised other matters such as increased patient awareness, prescription requests, self-medication, recreational use, recognition of new knowledge gaps, renewed scientific activity, and seemingly exponential growth of the cannabis industry. This review, following a general overview of cannabis and the endocannabinoid system, assiduously describes its role within the context of cardiovascular diseases, paying particular attention to the Janus influence that endocannabinoid system modulators can have on the cardiovascular system.","Rabino, Martina; Mallia, Sara; Castiglioni, Elisa; Rovina, Davide; Pompilio, Giulio; Gowran, Aoife",Pharmaceuticals (Basel),126,24

This lockdown mandated closure of private and public transportation. The patients with hematological malignancies were at risk of delayed consultation, admission and missing scheduled chemotherapy. Since there is no official tele-health or e-health system established in hospitals, we decided to use Viber, a free text and call app to trace and provide information about patient admission and treatment schedule. This use of Viber during the pandemic was found to be very helpful, none of the patients missed chemotherapy and we were able to admit more patients than before. Patients found this strategy very convenient and cost-effective and suggested that we continue this service in future even after the lockdown is lifted. This preliminary experience of using Viber for cancer care consultations in Nepal at the time of the COVID-19 pandemic suggests the utility and acceptability of using mobile technology to improve access to health care services in a low-income country.

Recent studies suggest intravascular neutrophil activation and subsequent immune cell–triggered immunothrombosis as a central pathomechanism linking the heterogenous clinical picture of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19). We sought to study whether immunothrombosis is a pathognomonic factor in COVID‐19 or a general feature of (viral) pneumonia, as well as to better understand its upstream regulation. APPROACH AND RESULTS: By comparing histopathological specimens of SARS‐CoV‐2 with influenza‐affected lungs, we show that vascular neutrophil recruitment, NETosis, and subsequent immunothrombosis are typical features of severe COVID‐19, but less prominent in influenza pneumonia. Activated neutrophils were typically found in physical association with monocytes. To explore this further, we combined clinical data of COVID‐19 cases with comprehensive immune cell phenotyping and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid scRNA‐seq data. We show that a HLADR(low) CD9(low) monocyte population expands in severe COVID‐19, which releases neutrophil chemokines in the lungs, and might in turn explain neutrophil expansion and pulmonary recruitment in the late stages of severe COVID‐19. CONCLUSIONS: Our data underline an innate immune cell axis causing vascular inflammation and immunothrombosis in severe SARS‐CoV‐2 infection.","Nicolai, Leo; Leunig, Alexander; Brambs, Sophia; Kaiser, Rainer; Joppich, Markus; Hoffknecht, Marie‐Louise; Gold, Christoph; Engel, Anouk; Polewka, Vivien; Muenchhoff, Maximilian; Hellmuth, Johannes C.; Ruhle, Adrian; Ledderose, Stephan; Weinberger, Tobias; Schulz, Heiko; Scherer, Clemens; Rudelius, Martina; Zoller, Michael; Keppler, Oliver T.; Zwißler, Bernhard; von Bergwelt‐Baildon, Michael; Kääb, Stefan; Zimmer, Ralf; Bülow, Roman D.; von Stillfried, Saskia; Boor, Peter; Massberg, Steffen; Pekayvaz, Kami; Stark, Konstantin",J Thromb Haemost,126,21

Understanding how COVID-19 has affected mental health care delivery within primary care settings will be critical to inform future policy and practice decisions during the later phases of the pandemic and beyond. The objective of our study was to describe the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on primary care teams’ delivery of mental health care. METHODS: A qualitative study using focus groups conducted with primary care teams in Ontario, Canada. Focus group data was analysed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: We conducted 11 focus groups with 10 primary care teams and a total of 48 participants. With respect to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health care in primary care teams, we identified three key themes: i) the high demand for mental health care, ii) the rapid transformation to virtual care, and iii) the impact on providers. CONCLUSIONS: From the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic, primary care quickly responded to the rising mental health care demands of their patients. Despite the numerous challenges they faced with the rapid transition to virtual care, primary care teams have persevered. It is essential that policy and decision-makers take note of the toll that these demands have placed on providers.

Various vaccination strategies against toxoplasmosis in rodent models have been used in the past few decades; however, effective vaccines remain a challenge. A recombinant adenovirus vaccine expressing ubiquitin-conjugated multi-stage antigen segments (Ad-UMAS) derived from different life-cycle stages of T. gondii was constructed previously. Here, we compared the immune responses and protection effects in vaccination of mice with Ad-UMAS by five vaccination routes including intramuscular (i.m.), intravenous (i.v.), subcutaneous (s.c.), intraoral (i.o.), and intranasal (i.n.). Much higher levels of T. gondii-specific IgG and IgA antibodies were detected in the sera of the intraoral and intranasal vaccination groups on day 49 compared with controls (p < 0.05). The percentages of CD8(+) T-cells in mice immunized intranasally and intraorally were larger than in mice immunized intramuscularly (p < 0.05). The highest level of IL-2 and IFN-γ was detected in the group with nasal immunization, and splenocyte proliferation activity was significantly enhanced in mice immunized via the oral and nasal routes. Furthermore, the higher survival rate (50%) and lower cyst numbers observed in the intraoral and intranasal groups all indicate that Ad-UMAS is far more effective in protecting mice against T. gondii infection via the mucosal route. Ad-UMAS could be an effective and safe mucosal candidate vaccine to protect animals and humans against T. gondii infection.","Wang, Ting; Yin, Huiquan; Li, Yan; Zhao, Lingxiao; Sun, Xiahui; Cong, Hua",Parasite,126,16

The D‐dimer is frequently elevated in COVID‐19, but other markers of coagulation activation, including the prothrombin fragment 1.2 (PF1.2) are poorly described. METHODS: We studied hospitalized adults with COVID‐19 and PF1.2 measurement performed at any time during hospitalization. We evaluated the relationship between PF1.2 and synchronously measured D‐dimer. We utilized receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis to evaluate optimal thresholds for diagnosing thrombosis and multivariable logistic regression to evaluate association with thrombosis. RESULTS: 115 patients were included [110 (95.7%) critically ill]. PF1.2 and D‐dimer were moderately positively correlated (r=0.542, P<0.001) but significant discordance was observed in elevation of each marker above the laboratory reference range (59.0% elevated PF1.2 vs. 98.5% elevated D‐dimer). Median PF1.2 levels were higher in patients with thrombosis than those without (611 vs. 374 pmol/L, P=0.006). In ROC analysis, PF1.2 had superior specificity and conferred a higher positive likelihood ratio in identifying patients with thrombosis than D‐dimer (PF1.2 threshold of >523 pmol/L: 69.2% sensitivity, 67.7% specificity; >924 pmol/L: 37.9% sensitivity, 87.8% specificity). In multivariable analysis, a PF1.2 >500 pmol/L was significantly associated with VTE [adjusted odds ratio (OR) 4.26, 95% CI, 1.12‐16.21, P=0.034] and any thrombotic manifestation (adjusted OR 3.85, 95% CI, 1.39‐10.65, P=0.010); conversely, synchronously measured D‐dimer was not significantly associated with thrombosis. 90.6% of patients with a non‐elevated PF1.2 result did not develop VTE. CONCLUSIONS: PF1.2 may be a useful assay, and potentially more discriminant than D‐dimer, in identifying thrombotic manifestations in hospitalized patients with COVID‐19.

We also aimed to investigate whether muscle strength and flexibility would change when the players returned to play after COVID-19 confinement. METHODS Thirty professional male soccer (Age; 24.9±4.8 yrs, BMI; 22.7±1.4 kg/m2) players participated in this study. Hamstring eccentric strength, hip abduction-adduction strength and posterior chain flexibility (PCF) were measured before (time 1) and after the home confinement period (time 2) and after return to play (time 3). Repeated measures of ANOVA was used for statistical analysis. RESULTS PCF decreased from time 1 to time 2 (p=0.005) but it increased from time 2 to time 3 (p=0.03). Hamstring eccentric strength decreased from time 1 to time 2 for both dominant (p=0.002) and non-dominant (p=0.04) limbs and no difference was observed between time 2 and time 3 (p>0.05). Hip abductor and adductor strength did not change between time 1 and time 2 (p>0.05) but they increased from time 2 and time 3 in the dominant limb (p<0.05). Five players (16%) had muscle injuries including hamstrings and adductors when they returned to play. CONCLUSION This study showed that 8-week COVID-19 confinement had an adverse effect on hamstring eccentric strength and PCF and 3 players had hamstring muscle injuries when they returned to play. Therefore, soccer players can be at risk of hamstring muscle injuries due to long-term detraining. Hip abductor and adductor strength seem not to be negatively affected by 8-week COVID-19 confinement. However, 2 players had adductor strain when they returned to play.","Demir, Cigdem; Subasi, Burak; Harput, Gulcan",The Physician and sportsmedicine,126,16

Gene therapy has the potential to meet this goal and the discovery of RNA interference (RNAi) has lead to a new class of highly selective therapeutics. However, initial enthusiasm is reduced due to safety concerns associated with virus-based delivery vectors that are used for in vivo delivery. Viral vectors for siRNA delivery into target cells are used because of their high target specificity and delivery efficacy (endosomal escape). Recent discoveries suggest that a specialized form of nano-sized lipid vesicles called exosomes can incorporate and transport functional RNAs into target cells and may serve as an attractive alternative. Evidence is accumulating that most pluricellular organisms sustain exosome-based communications via inter-cellular exchange of mRNA and miRNAs between cells. We discovered that viruses have found ways to exploit this communication pathway and we argue here that adaptations of exosomes imposed by viruses maybe exploited for superior delivery of RNA in vivo. We discuss recent discoveries in exosome biogenesis their physical properties, targeting and delivery strategies and how the knowledge of exosome production in virus infected cells could propel their entry into clinical settings.","Koppers-Lalic, Danijela; Hogenboom, Marye M.; Middeldorp, Jaap M.; Pegtel, D.

Furthermore, various reports suggest that the interaction between COVID-19 and host-microbiota homeostasis is mediated through the modulation of microRNAs (miRNAs). Thus, in this review, we aim to summarize the association between human microbiota and miRNAs in COVID-19 pathogenesis. [METHODS]: We searched for the existing literature using the keywords such “COVID-19 or microbiota,” “microbiota or microRNA,” and “COVID-19 or probiotics” in PubMed until March 31, 2021. Subsequently, we thoroughly reviewed the articles related to microbiota and miRNAs in COVID-19 to generate a comprehensive picture depicting the association between human microbiota and microRNAs in the pathogenesis of COVID-19. [RESULTS]: There exists strong experimental evidence suggesting that the composition and diversity of human microbiota are altered in COVID-19 patients, implicating a bidirectional association between the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 encoded miRNAs and host cellular microRNAs modulated by human microbiota can interfere with viral replication and regulate host gene expression involved in the initiation and progression of COVID-19. These findings suggest that the manipulation of human microbiota with probiotics may play a significant role against SARS-CoV-2 infection by enhancing the host immune system and lowering the inflammatory status. [CONCLUSION]: The human microbiota-miRNA axis can be used as a therapeutic approach for COVID-19. Hence, further studies are needed to investigate the exact molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of miRNA expression in human microbiota and how these miRNA profiles mediate viral infection through host-microbe interactions.","Hong, Bok Sil; Kim, Myoung-Ryu",Phys Act Nutr,126,24

Many guidelines recommend using aerosol precautions during ""aerosol generating procedures"" (AGPs) and droplet (<5 m) precautions at other times. However, there is emerging evidence that respiratory activities such as cough and not AGPs are the important source of aerosols. Methods We used a novel chamber with an optical particle counter sampling at 100 L/min to count and size-fractionate all exhaled particles (0.5-25 m). We compared emissions from ten healthy subjects during respiratory ""activities"" (quiet breathing, talking, shouting, forced expiratory maneuvers, exercise and coughing) with respiratory ""therapies"" designated as AGPs: high flow nasal oxygen (HFNO) and single or dual circuit non-invasive positive pressure ventilation, NIPPV-S and NIPPV-D, respectively. Activities were repeated wearing facemasks. Results Compared to quiet breathing, respiratory activities increased particle counts between 34.6-fold (95% confidence interval [CI], 15.2 to 79.1) during talking, to 370.8-fold (95% CI, 162.3 to 847.1) during coughing (p<0.001). During quiet breathing, HFNO at 60 L/min increased counts 2.3-fold (95% CI, 1.2 to 4.4) (p=0.03) and NIPPV-S and NIPPV-D at 25/10 cm H2O increased counts by 2.6-fold (95% CI, 1.7 to 4.1) and 7.8-fold (95% CI, 4.4 to 13.6) respectively (p<0.001). During activities, respiratory therapies and facemasks reduced emissions compared to activities alone. Conclusion Talking, exertional breathing and coughing generate substantially more aerosols than the respiratory therapies HFNO and NIPPV which can reduce total emissions. The risk of aerosol exposure is underappreciated and warrants widespread targeted interventions.","Wilson, N.; Marks, G.; Eckhardt, A.; Clarke, A.; Young, F.; Garden, F.; Stewart, W.; Cook, T.; Tovey, E.",,126,1

This case series reports the location, severity, and prevalence of focal peripheral nerve injuries involving the upper limb identified in an acute COVID-19 rehabilitation setting. The purpose of this study was to report observations and to explore the challenges in assessing these patients. METHODS: Participants were patients with suspected peripheral nerve injuries following discharge from COVID-19 critical care who were referred to the peripheral nerve injury multidisciplinary team. The patients studied had suspected peripheral nerve injuries following discharge from COVID-19 critical care and were referred to the peripheral nerve injury multidisciplinary team. Data were collected retrospectively on what peripheral neuropathies were observed, with reference to relevant investigation findings and proning history. RESULTS: During the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom, 256 patients were admitted to COVID-19 critical care of Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Birmingham, United Kingdom. From March to June 2020, a total of 114 patients required prone ventilation. In this subgroup, a total of 15 patients were identified with clinical findings of peripheral nerve injuries within the upper limb. In total, 30 anatomical nerve injuries were recorded. The most commonly affected nerve was the ulnar nerve (12/30) followed by the cords of the brachial plexus (10/30). Neuropathic pain and muscle wasting were identified, signifying a high-grade nerve injury. CONCLUSION: Peripheral nerve injuries may be associated with prone positioning on intensive care units, although other mechanisms, such as those of a neuroinflammatory nature, cannot be excluded. IMPACT: Proning-related upper limb peripheral nerve injuries are not discussed widely in the literature and may be an area of further consideration when critical care units review their proning protocols. Physical therapists treating these patients play a key part in the management of this group of patients by optimizing the positioning of patients during proning, making early identification of peripheral nerve injuries, providing rehabilitation interventions, and referring to specialist services if necessary.","O'Sullivan, Joel; Miller, Caroline; Jeffrey, Jack; Power, Dominic",Phys Ther,126,1

To develop an image-guided navigation technology that will help in surgical education, we explored the performance of a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based computer vision system in detecting intraoperative objects. METHODS: The surgical videos used for annotation were recorded during surgeries conducted in the Department of Surgery of Tokyo Women’s Medical University from 2019 to 2020. Abdominal endoscopic images were cut out from manually captured surgical videos. An open-source programming framework for CNN was used to design a model that could recognize and segment objects in real time through IBM Visual Insights. The model was used to detect the GI tract, blood, vessels, uterus, forceps, ports, gauze and clips in the surgical images. RESULTS: The accuracy, precision and recall of the model were 83%, 80% and 92%, respectively. The mean average precision (mAP), the calculated mean of the precision for each object, was 91%. Among surgical tools, the highest recall and precision of 96.3% and 97.9%, respectively, were achieved for forceps. Among the anatomical structures, the highest recall and precision of 92.9% and 91.3%, respectively, were achieved for the GI tract. CONCLUSION: The proposed model could detect objects in operative images with high accuracy, highlighting the possibility of using AI-based object recognition techniques for intraoperative navigation.

Methods: A single-center longitudinal, online-based survey was conducted in healthcare workers from a department of anesthesiology and critical care in Bavaria, the most affected federal state in Germany at the time of assessment. Validated scores for depression, anxiety, somatic disorders, burnout, resilience, and self-management were used and complemented by questions about perceived COVID-19-related stressors. In parallel, patient characteristics in the ICU were collected. Results: 24 and 23 critically ill COVID-19 patients were treated during both observation periods in April/May and November/December 2020, respectively. 87.5% and 78.2% of patients had moderate to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome. From March 6, 2020 onwards, the hospital had switched to a command and control-based hospital incident command system (HICS) and increased work forces. Point prevalence of depression-like symptoms (13.6% and 12.8%) and burnout (21.6% and 17.4%) in the department’s healthcare professionals was high. Exposure to SARS-CoV-2 did not increase psychological burden. Consequences of the lockdown were rated as highly distressing by a majority of all ICU personnel. High self-reported trait resilience was protective against signs of depression, generalized anxiety, and burnout. Conclusions: During the pandemic, healthcare professionals have been suffering from increased psychological distress compared to reference data for both the general population and ICU personnel. General effects of the lockdown appear more relevant than actual COVID-19 patient contact. High trait resilience has a protective effect, yet vulnerable individuals may require specific support. Prevention against potential after effects of the lockdown, and in particular measures allowing to avoid another lockdown, appear warranted.","Schmid, Benedikt; Schulz, Stefan M.; Schuler, Michael; Göpfert, Dennis; Hein, Grit; Heuschmann, Peter; Wurmb, Thomas; Pauli, Paul; Meybohm, Patrick; Rittner, Heike L.",Ger Med Sci,126,24

The present study attempted to explore the management of catheter ablation in arrhythmia patients during the pandemic. METHODS AND RESULTS: From 1 January 2020 to 24 March 2020, a total of 269 arrhythmia patients hospitalized for catheter ablation under strict risk assessments and careful infection prevention were retrospectively analysed and considered for our analysis at our centre. Preventive measured included a 14 day quarantine, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) nucleic acid detection, adoption of personal protection equipment, application of hand disinfectant, management of hospital visitors, and maintenance of environmental hygiene. Three patients who had fever following ablation and were finally excluded from SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, and no hospital infection occurred during the 3.1 ± 1.5 day hospitalization period. Additionally, 258/269 (95.9%) patients were free from arrhythmia after a median 133 day follow‐up (Q1, 81; Q3, 143; ending 1 June 2020), and no SARS‐CoV‐2 infections occurred at follow‐up. CONCLUSIONS: By adopting strict risk assessments and careful infection prevention measures, catheter ablation in patients with arrhythmia can be safely and effectively performed during the COVID‐19 epidemic in well‐controlled areas.","Li, Kaige; Qin, Mu; Jiang, Weifeng; Zhang, Yu; Wu, Shaohui; Xu, Kai; Liu, Xu",ESC Heart Fail,126,1

A multicenter study in Spain (BIOCOVID-Spain study),17.131577,8.539186,2021-02-16,"Acute lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) are a major worldwide health problem, particularly in childhood. About 30–50% of acute LRTIs are viral in origin with influenza A infection a key cause of explosive community outbreaks. Many different influenza A viruses occur naturally in animal reservoirs and present a constant threat of zoonotic infections and global pandemics. Since 2009, when pandemic (H1N1) influenza A emerged from a swine origin, there have been a number of different zoonotic influenza A transmissions into the human population, including H1N1 and H3N2 variant viruses in North America and H7N9 viruses in China. The segmented nature of the influenza A virus genome and the circulation of these viruses in wild bird, domestic poultry and mammalian reservoirs presents a continuous opportunity for reassortment of viral genes and the emergence of a novel pandemic virus. Constant vigilance is required. The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome in 2003 and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus in 2012, highlights the fact that other serious respiratory viral infections in humans may originate in animals. Enhanced awareness of the potential for serious human respiratory disease in association with travel, or animal exposure, should form part of clinical assessment. Rapid developments in genomic technology improve the ability to diagnose previously undetected pathogens. Preventative measures for influenza include annual vaccination and treatment with antiviral drugs such as neuraminidase inhibitors, oseltamivir and zanamivir. Subtype-dependent resistance to antivirals can develop and should be closely monitored.","Zambon, Maria",Medicine (Abingdon),126,16

Especially music students needed to adapt their musical learning to this particular situation. Mostly affected by the lockdown was the musical practicing behavior, especially when practicing at the University of Music was not possible. In this study, music students in their second and third semesters were asked to provide information on their practicing situations during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) lockdown. They were required to fill in questionnaires about the practicing time and concepts of self-efficacy and self-regulation for musical learning. The data of 18 music students were collected. For the analysis, they were compared with the answers of 15 music students who were asked the same questions half a year earlier before the pandemic situation occurred. The results showed that the music students relocated mostly to their parents' homes for practicing during the lockdown. In the amount of practicing, the bachelor of music students practiced less during lockdown compared with before the lockdown. The mean self-efficacy for musical learning did not differ between before and during the lockdown. For the self-regulated musical learning, the music students showed significantly higher values in the subscale on reflecting and creating a framework for the progress of musical learning during the lockdown. The findings indicate that the music students developed certain self-regulated learning skills during the lockdown and managed to find suitable solutions in continuing with their musical learning without reservation.","Nusseck, Manfred; Spahn, Claudia",Front Psychol,126,1

Treatment with anti-inflammatory drugs either does not prevent disease progression (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs], colchicine), or is recommended only at the advanced disease stage (dexamethasone). Fluvoxamine and amantadine are drugs used to treat neurological and psychiatric diseases. Fluvoxamine is a selective serotonin uptake inhibitor, whereas amantadine is an old antiviral variably influencing brain neurotransmitter systems, and repurposed to Parkinson's disease. Both drugs are agonists of sigma-1 receptors located in the endoplasmic reticulum, which effect seems responsible for their anti-inflammatory activity. Moreover, amantadine was found to dampen the expression of cathepsin-L, a lysosomal enzyme implicated in SARS-CoV-2 virus entry to target cells. In two small controlled clinical trials, early treatment of SARS-CoV-2-infected persons with fluvoxamine fully prevented COVID-19 symptoms. Anecdotal evidence shows that amantadine may be similarly effective. Both drugs are easily available, inexpensive and have favorable safety profiles.

We have identified IFNβ-1a as the most promising drug to be repurposed for COVID-19. The rationale relies on the evidence of IFNβ anti-viral activity in vitro against SARS-CoV-2 and animal models resembling SARS-CoV-2 infection and on a recent clinical trial where IFNβ was indicated as the key component of a successful therapeutic combination. METHODS: This is a randomized, controlled, open-label, monocentric, phase II trial (INTERCOP trial). One hundred twenty-six patients with positive swab detection of SARS-CoV-2, radiological signs of pneumonia, and mild-to-moderate disease will be randomized 2:1 to IFNβ-1a in addition to standard of care vs standard of care alone. No other anti-viral drugs will be used as part of the regimens, both in the control and the intervention arms. IFNβ-1a will be administered subcutaneously at the dose of 44 mcg (equivalent to 12 million international units) three times per week, at least 48 h apart, for a total of 2 weeks. The primary outcome is the time to negative conversion of SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal swabs. Secondary outcomes include improvement or worsening in a clinical severity score measured on a 7-point ordinal scale (including transfer to intensive care unit and death), oxygen- and ventilator-free days, mortality, changes in pulmonary computed tomography severity score, hospital stay duration, reduction of viral load measured on nasopharyngeal swabs, number of serious adverse events, and changes in biochemical markers of organ dysfunction. Exploratory outcomes include blood cell counts, cytokine and inflammatory profile, peripheral mRNA expression profiles of interferon-stimulated genes, and antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 and to IFNβ-1a. INTERCOP is the first study to specifically investigate the clinical benefits of IFNβ-1a in COVID-19 patients. DISCUSSION: Potential implications of this trial are multifaceted: should the primary outcome be fulfilled and the treatment be safe, one may envisage that IFNβ-1a be used to reduce the infectivity of patients with mild-to moderate disease. In case IFNβ-1a reduced the duration of hospital stay and/or ameliorated the clinical status, it may become a cornerstone of COVID-19 treatment. TRIAL REGISTRATION: EudraCT 2020-002458-25.

While the exact pathogenesis is yet to be elucidated, the role of neuro-immune signaling has recently emerged. Despite major advances in pharmacotherapy, antidepressant use is marred by limited efficacy and potential side effects. Cannabidiol (CBD), a phytocannabinoid, exerts antidepressant-like effects in experimental animals. This study investigated the impact of CBD on sickness behavior (SB), a measure of depressive-like response, and neuro-immune changes induced by lipopolysaccharides (LPS) in mice. METHODS: Socially isolated rodents were administered with LPS to trigger SB. and treated with CBD or its vehicle. Animals were submitted to forced swimming test, to evaluate depressive-like behavior, and to open field test, to evaluate locomotory activity. Immediately after behavioral analyses, animals were euthanized and had their hypothalamus, prefrontal cortex and hippocampus dissected, to proceed neurotrophins and cytokines analyses. ELISA was used to detect IL-1β, BDNF and NGF; and cytometric beads array to measure IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IFN-γ, TNF-α and IL-10 levels. RESULTS: CBD effectively prevented SB-induced changes in the forced swim test without altering spontaneous locomotion. This phytocannabinoid also partially reversed LPS-evoked IL-6 increase in both the hypothalamus and hippocampus. In addition, CBD prevented endotoxin-induced increase in BDNF and NGF levels in the hippocampus of SB animals. CONCLUSIONS: Apparently, CBD prevents both behavioral and neuro-immunological changes associated with LPS-induced SB, which reinforces its potential use as an antidepressant which modulates neuroinflammation. This opens up potentially new therapeutic avenues in MDD.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A two-phase study was performed, including an analysis of questionnaire data and conducted interviews with members of the care panel of the Netherlands Patients Federation. The questionnaire assessed 14 types of interventions, satisfaction (score 0–10) with received interventions, needs, experiences, and desired improvements in nurses’ support. Interviews further explored experiences and improvements. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and a thematic analysis approach. RESULTS: Fifty-nine participants completed the questionnaire, and 14 of the 59 participants were interviewed. The satisfaction score for interventions was 7.9 (IQR 7–9). The most common interventions were: “noticing when I don’t take medication as prescribed” (n = 35), “helping me to find solutions to overcome problems with using medications” (n = 32), “helping me with taking medication” (n = 32), and “explaining the importance of taking medication at the right moment” (n = 32). Fifteen participants missed ≥1 of the 14 interventions. Most mentioned the following: “regularly asking about potential problems with medication use” (33%), “regularly discussing whether using medication is going well” (29%), and “explaining the importance of taking medication at the right moment” (27%). Twenty-two participants experienced the following as positive: improved self-management of adequate medication taking, a professional patient–nurse relationship to discuss adherence problems, and nurses’ proactive attitude to arrange practical support for medication use. Thirteen patients experienced the following as negative: insufficient timing of home visits, rushed appearance of nurses, and insufficient expertise about side effects and taking medication. Suggested improvements included performing home visits on time, more time for providing support in medication use, and more expertise about side effects and administering medication. CONCLUSION: Overall, participants were satisfied, and few participants wanted more interventions. Nurses’ support improved participants’ self-management of medication taking and enabled patients to discuss their adherence problems.

Tailoring services to the needs of this population requires careful work to identify, monitor and evaluate areas of care; however, published work in this area to guide service priorities is limited. This paper presents work done by the Australian Youth Cancer Services to operationalise and deliver quality care to adolescents and young adults with cancer, focusing on nationally coordinated service improvement initiatives and activity data collection in four areas that are of particular concern to young people diagnosed with cancer: clinical trial enrolment, oncofertility, psychosocial care and survivorship. This account may be instructive for health services seeking to improve the delivery and monitoring of cancer care provided to adolescents and young adults. ABSTRACT: Adolescents and young adults (aged 15–25 years) diagnosed with cancer have unique medical and psychosocial experiences and care needs, distinct from those of paediatric and older adult patients. Since 2011, the Australian Youth Cancer Services have provided developmentally appropriate, multidisciplinary and comprehensive care to these young patients, facilitated by national service coordination and activity data collection and monitoring. This paper reports on how the Youth Cancer Services have conceptualised and delivered quality youth cancer care in four priority areas: clinical trial participation, oncofertility, psychosocial care and survivorship. National activity data collected by the Youth Cancer Services between 2016–17 and 2019–20 are used to illustrate how service monitoring processes have facilitated improvements in coordination and accountability across multiple indicators of quality youth cancer care, including clinical trial participation, access to fertility information and preservation, psychosocial screening and care and the transition from active treatment to survivorship. Accounts of both service delivery and monitoring and evaluation processes within the Australian Youth Cancer Services provide an exemplar of how coordinated initiatives may be employed to deliver, monitor and improve quality cancer care for adolescents and young adults.","Patterson, Pandora; Allison, Kimberley R.; Bibby, Helen; Thompson, Kate; Lewin, Jeremy; Briggs, Taia; Walker, Rick; Osborn, Michael; Plaster, Meg; Hayward, Allan; Henney, Roslyn; George, Shannyn; Keuskamp, Dominic; Anazodo, Antoinette",Cancers (Basel),126,19

Traditional modes of knowledge dissemination have not been feasible. A rapid solution was needed to share guidance and implementation examples among the global Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) community. We designed the IPC Global Webinar Series to bring together subject matter experts and IPC professionals in the fight against COVID-19. METHODS: The Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes (ECHO) model was adapted to create an interactive global knowledge network. Speakers and panelists provided presentations and answers to questions from participants. The webinars were simultaneously interpreted to five languages and recorded for later access. RESULTS: Thirteen webinar sessions were completed from May 14 through August 6, 2020. On average, 634 participants attended each session (range: 393 – 1,181). Each session was represented by participants from an average of over 100 countries; sessions 1-3 had participation from approximate 120 countries, and sessions 6 and 12 had participation from approximately 80 countries. DISCUSSION: The IPC Global Webinar Series shared critical information and promoted peer-to-peer learning during the COVID-19 pandemic response. The webinar sessions reached a broader audience than many in-person events. The webinar series was rapidly scaled and can be rapidly re-activated as needed. Our lessons learned in designing and implementing the series can inform design of other global health virtual knowledge networks. The continued and expanded use of adapted virtual communities of practice and other learning networks for the IPC community can serve as a valuable tool for addressing COVID-19 and other infectious disease threats.","Wilson, Kathryn; Dennison, Cori; Struminger, Bruce; Armistad, Amy; Osuka, Hanako; Montoya, Eva; Padoveze, Maria Clara; Arora, Sanjeev; Park, Benjamin; Lessa, Fernanda C",Clin Infect Dis,126,14

In sport specifically, athletes have had to deal with frustration of their objectives and changes in their usual training routines. The challenging and disruptive situation could hold implications for their well-being. This study examined the effect of the COVID-19 lockdown on changes in athletes’ reported eudaimonic well-being (subjective vitality) and goal motives (autonomous and controlled) over time (i.e., pre-lockdown and during lockdown). The relationship of resilience to changes in subjective vitality was also determined, and changes in athletes’ goal motives were examined as potential mediators. Participants were 127 Spanish university athletes aged between 18 and 34 years (M = 21.14; SD = 2.77). Approximately 4 months before the start of the lockdown in Spain (T1), athletes responded to a questionnaire assessing their resilience, goal motives, and subjective vitality. Around 6 months later into the lockdown period (T2), athletes’ goal motives and subjective vitality were assessed again. Growth modeling using hierarchical linear models revealed a significant decrease of autonomous goal motives and subjective vitality during the lockdown, but athletes did not show change over time in controlled goal motives. Path analysis, adjusting T2 measures for their corresponding T1 measures, showed that resilience significantly predicted changes in athletes’ autonomous goal motives, which then accounted for changes in subjective vitality. The indirect effect was significant. Resilience did not predict changes in athletes’ controlled goal motives. However, changes in controlled goal motives negatively predicted changes in subjective vitality during lockdown. The findings suggest negative impacts of the COVID-19 lockdown on athletes’ goal motives and eudaimonic well-being. Results also support the hypothesized mediational role of autonomous goal motives in the relationship between resilience and subjective vitality during the lockdown. As such, findings confirm the relevance of resilience to a key feature of athletes’ eudaimonic well-being and the importance of enhancing their autonomous goal striving.","Martínez-González, Natalia; Atienza, Francisco L.; Tomás, Inés; Duda, Joan L.; Balaguer, Isabel",Front Psychol,126,22

RSV infections peaked in July to October, were relatively more common in children <1 year and in the northernmost hospital. IAV infections peaked in December to February and were relatively more common in patients >5 years in the central region. Coinfection with IAV or RSV was associated with increased disease severity compared with patients only infected with HBoV or HRV. Over a hundred genomes belonging to 13 families and 24 genera were obtained via metagenomic sequencing, including novel viruses and viruses less commonly associated with ARIs. Phylogenetic and phylogeographic analyses further indicated that neighboring countries were the most likely source of many virus lineages causing ARIs in Vietnam and estimated the period that specific lineages have been circulating. Our study illustrates the value of applying the state-of-the-art virus diagnostic methods (multiplex RT-PCR and metagenomic sequencing) and phylodynamic analyses at a national level to generate an integrated picture of viral ARI epidemiology.","Lu, Lu; Robertson, Gail; Ashworth, Jordan; Pham Hong, Anh; Shi, Ting; Ivens, Alasdair; Thwaites, Guy; Baker, Stephen; Woolhouse, Mark",Front Microbiol,126,16

HCoV infections can be associated with respiratory and extrarespiratory manifestations, including central nervous system involvement. Furthermore, unlike other RNA viruses, HCoVs can easily mutate and recombine when different strains infect the same cells and give rise to a novel virus with unpredictable host ranges and pathogenicity. Thus, circulating HCoVs should be closely monitored to detect the spread of particularly virulent strains in the community at an early stage and to facilitate the development of adequate preventive and therapeutic measures.","Principi, Nicola; Bosis, Samantha; Esposito, Susanna",Emerg Infect Dis,126,28

Until now various bio-assays are successfully implemented based on different mixing modules present on such lab-on-chips. In present work, the concept of such dedicated virtual modules has been eliminated and a novel module-less-synthesis (MLS) method is proposed for accomplishing high-performance bio-protocols. Various shift-patterns (movements) of the micro-droplets are identified to accomplish entire mixing in lesser time compared to earlier module-based synthesis methods. We have also computed the percentage of mixing accomplishment for each directional-shift of the mixer-droplet. However, path congestion problem and operational errors are inevitable in MLS approach. Hence, the path congestion and washing problem in MLS is addressed by tweaking the earlier MLS approach and a new modified-MLS (MMLS) method is proposed. Finally, washing optimization technique on MMLS method is also given. Different real-life bio assays like PCR, IVD are tested with the proposed technique as well as synthetic benchmarks (hard test benches) are also incorporated in the experiments. For both kind of benchmarks synthesis performance improved with bioassay completion time ([Formula: see text] ) significantly reduced compared to existing synthesis approaches on DMFB platform.","Chakraborty, Sarit; Chakraborty, Susanta",SN Appl Sci,126,16

Methods Case data of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 infection in Hangzhou City, Zhejiang Province in China were collected, and chest HRCT signs of infected patients in four age groups (<18 years, 18–44 years, 45–59 years, ≥60 years) were compared. Results Small patchy, ground-glass opacity (GGO), and consolidations were the main HRCT signs in 98 patients with confirmed COVID-19 infections. Patients aged 45–59 years and aged ≥60 years had more bilateral lung, lung lobe, and lung field involvement, and greater lesion numbers than patients <18 years. GGO accompanied with the interlobular septa thickening or a crazy-paving pattern, consolidation, and air bronchogram sign were more common in patients aged 45–59 years, and ≥60 years, than in those aged <18 years, and aged 18–44 years.

This is extremely important in the setting of older women, who have treatment-specific goals which may differ from their younger counterparts, and may include conservation of quality of life rather than curative intent of treatment. One method employed to assist with this is the use of tumour-based prognostic and predictive tools. This article explores six of the most common tumour-based tools currently available on the market: MammaPrint, Oncotype DX, Mammostrat, Prosigna, EndoPredict, IHC4. The article discusses the creation and validation of these tools, their use and validation in older women, and future directions in the field. With the exception of Oncotype Dx, which has also been licensed for prediction of response from adjuvant chemotherapy, these tools have been licensed for use as prognostic tools only, mainly in the setting of adjuvant therapy following surgery. The evidence base for use in older women is strongest for Mammostrat and PAM50, although overall the evidence is much weaker than that in younger women. Where older women have been included in validation studies, this is often in small numbers, or the exact proportion of older women is unknown. In practice, all six of the tools are recommended to be utilised on surgical excision specimens, as well as in core needle biopsy (CNB) specimens in all of the tools except Mammostrat. This is extremely important in the setting of older women, of whom a large proportion do not undergo surgery. The suggested nature of the sample is formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded in all the tools except MammaPrint, which can also be performed on fresh-frozen samples. Future development of prognostic tools in older women with breast cancer should focus on treatment dilemmas specific to this population. This includes the decision of primary treatment between surgery or endocrine therapy and decisions regarding adjuvant therapy, in particular, chemotherapy.","Gordon-Craig, Sophie; Parks, Ruth M.; Cheung, Kwok-Leung",Oncol Ther,126,9

Although many elective procedures were put on hold, a cohort of patients who underwent surgery prior to the outbreak of the pandemic were rendered unable to participate in standard post-operative care. The purpose of this study was to determine the methods of post-operative care in arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction patients who received care during an early height of the pandemic to those who received standard of care in the prior year. We aimed to correlate those results with 1-year clinical outcomes in the form of subjective surveys. METHODS Retrospective chart review was used to identify patients who underwent primary anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction in February and March of 2020 (case) and 2019 (control) at a single institution. Workman's compensation patients were excluded. Identified patients were asked to report post-operative care received, satisfaction with care, and complete the IKDC and Lysholm outcome measures. Surveys were conducted minimum 1-year post-operative. RESULTS 236 patients were identified, including 103 in 2020 and 133 in 2019. Follow-up data was collected for 73 patients (70.9%) in 2020 and 97 patients (72.9%) in 2019. Fifty-one COVID cohort patients (69.9%) had at least one clinical visit conducted via telehealth, compared to zero in the control. There were no differences in IKDC (82.8 ± 13.2 vs 85.0 ± 12.0, P=0.29) and Lysholm (89.2 ± 11.3 vs 89.6 ± 10.8, P=0.82) between groups. There were no differences in patient satisfaction with the care received (82.9 ± 22.4 vs 81.9 ± 21.8, P=0.79). CONCLUSION Despite disruptions in care, anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction patients have excellent 1-year outcomes during the pandemic. Telehealth follow-up appointments may be appropriate for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction patients beyond the pandemic and do not seem to adversely affect short-term patient reported outcome measures.","Lee, Donghoon; Lencer, Adam J; Gibbs, Brian S; Paul, Ryan W; Tjoumakaris, Fotios P",The Physician and sportsmedicine,126,29

There is limited research of patient and clinician experiences and perceptions of these clinics and the aim of this study is to provide further information to help improve patient experience and guide service delivery. METHODS: A mixed methods research design was employed comprising of a patient satisfaction survey, and patient and clinician interviews. Consultant ophthalmologists were recruited from throughout the UK, and patients and data gathering clinical staff recruited from the Manchester Royal Eye Hospital and Bristol Eye Hospital. RESULTS: We received a total of 148 patient satisfaction questionnaires with an overall response rate of 55.4%. Most respondents were diagnosed with primary open angle glaucoma (33.9%) at Manchester and glaucoma suspect status at Bristol (50.6%). Patients had high levels of confidence in the person conducting the tests (94.8% Manchester, 98.8% Bristol), and most were likely to recommend the service to family or friends (94.8% Manchester, 92.6% Bristol). We interviewed 10 consultant ophthalmologists, 10 data gathering staff and 20 patients. A number of key themes emerged from the transcribed interviews including: patient experience, clinician perception of patient experience, service delivery, staffing and staff experience, and patient safety. CONCLUSIONS: Glaucoma virtual clinics can be acceptable to both clinicians and patients, including those with a varied complexity of glaucoma and glaucoma-related disease. Dissatisfaction seemed to relate to poor communication or processes and systems within the service rather than complexity of disease.","Gunn, Patrick J.

While the knowledge on the acute phase of the disease has rapidly expanded, little is known on the consequences of COVID-19 following clinical remission. We set up a multidisciplinary COVID-19 follow-up outpatient clinic to identify and address the clinical needs of COVID-19 survivors. Here we describe the features of our follow-up programme. METHODS: The multidisciplinary assessment comprises a complete physical examination, respiratory evaluation (peripheral oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, dyspnoea assessment, lung ultrasound and pulmonary function), cardiovascular assessment (electrocardiography, echocardiography), nutritional assessment (anthropometrics, mini Nutritional Assessment screening tool), neurological examination including cognitive tests, and mental health assessment. All data are prospectively collected, and blood is sampled for biobanking. RESULTS: Since 7 April to 5 June, 2020, 453 out of the 1388 COVID-19 survivors managed at our University Hospital have been evaluated at the Outpatient COVID-19 Follow-up Clinic. The characteristics of the follow-up cohort are similar to those of the whole cohort of COVID-19 in terms of demographics, comorbidities, and COVID-19 severity upon ED presentation, indicating that the follow-up cohort is representative of the whole cohort. CONCLUSIONS: Continuous patient monitoring might give an answer to the numerous unsolved questions about what comes next in this pandemic and beyond.

This study evaluated possible changes in child eating behaviors, parental feeding practices, and parental motivations when buying food during the lockdown, compared to the period before the lockdown. Parents of 498 children aged 3-12 years (238 boys; M=7.32; SD=2.27) completed an online survey with items from validated questionnaires (e.g., CEDQ, CEBQ, HomeSTEAD). They reported on their (child’s) current situation during the lockdown, and retrospectively on the period before the lockdown. Many parents reported changes in child eating behaviors, feeding practices, and food shopping motivations. When changes occurred, child appetite, food enjoyment, food responsiveness and emotional overeating significantly increased during the lockdown. Increased child boredom significantly predicted increased food responsiveness, emotional overeating and snack frequency in between meals. When parents changed their practices, they generally became more permissive: less rules, more soothing with food, more child autonomy. They bought pleasurable and sustainable foods more frequently, prepared more home-cooked meals and cooked more with the child. Level of education and increased stress level predicted changes in parental practices and motivations. This study provides insights in factors that can induce positive and negative changes in families’ eating, feeding and cooking behaviors.

Rather than modulating ER stress in host cells, TUDCA abolished the proton conductivity of viral M2 by disrupting its oligomeric states, which induces inefficient viral infection. We also showed that M2 penetrated cells, whose intracellular uptake depended on its proton channel activity, an effect observed in both TUDCA and M2 inhibitor amantadine. The identification and application of TUDCA as an inhibitor of M2 proton channel will expand our understanding of IAV biology and complement current anti-IAV arsenals.","Li, Ning; Zhang, Yanxu; Wu, Shuangxiu; Xu, Ruodan; Li, Zhiqing; Zhu, Jindong; Wang, Hongliang; Li, Xiao; Tian, Mingyao; Lu, Huijun; Jin, Ningyi; Jiang, Chengyu",Sci Bull (Beijing),126,1

With older and more medically vulnerable people tending to stay at home to avoid contracting the virus, it is unclear how the behavior of people with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) has changed. The aim of this study was to determine if delays in presentation and healthcare service delivery for AMI exist during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to the same period a year prior. METHODS: In this single-center, retrospective study, we evaluated patients admitted with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) or non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) during early months of the COVID-19 pandemic (March 11, 2020 to April 20, 2020) compared to patients admitted with same diagnosis during the same period a year prior. RESULTS: There were 30 and 62 patients who presented with NSTEMI in the pandemic and pre-pandemic eras, respectively. The median pain-to-door time was significantly larger during the pandemic compared to pre-pandemic era (1,885 (880, 5,732) vs. 606 (388, 944) min, P < 0.0001). There was a significant delay in door-to-reperfusion time during the pandemic with a median time of 332 (182, 581) vs. 194 (92, 329) min (P = 0.0371). There were 24 (80%) and 25 (42%) patients who presented after 12 h of pain onset in pandemic and pre-pandemic eras, respectively (P = 0.0006). There were 47 and 60 patients who presented with STEMI during the pandemic timeframe of study and pre-pandemic timeframe, respectively. The median pain-to-door time during the pandemic was significantly larger than that of the pre-pandemic (620 (255, 1,500) vs. 349 (146, 659) min, P = 0.0141). There were 22 (47%) and 14 (24%) patients who presented after 12 h of pain onset in the pandemic and pre-pandemic eras, respectively (P = 0.0127). There was not a significant delay in door-to-reperfusion time (P = 0.9833). There were no differences in in-hospital death, stroke, or length of hospitalization between early and late presenters, as well as between pandemic and pre-pandemic eras. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, this study found that patients waited significantly longer during the pandemic to seek medical treatment for AMI compared to before the pandemic, and that pandemic-specific protocols may delay revascularization for NSTEMI patients. These findings resulted in more than a threefold increase from the onset of symptoms to revascularization increasing the risks for future complications such as left ventricular dysfunction and cardiovascular death. Efforts should be made to increase patients’ awareness regarding consequences of delayed presentation, and to find a balance between hospital evaluation strategies and goals of minimizing total ischemic time.","Aldujeli, Ali; Hamadeh, Anas; Briedis, Kasparas; Tecson, Kristen M.; Rutland, Joshua; Krivickas, Zilvinas; Stiklioraitis, Simas; Briede, Kamilija; Aldujeili, Montazar; Unikas, Ramunas; Zaliaduonyte, Diana; Zaliunas, Remigijus; Vallabhan, Ravi C.; McCullough, Peter A.",Cardiol Res,126,1

Amino acid exchanges within the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein variant of B.1.1.7 affect inter-monomeric contact sites within the trimer (A570D and D614G) as well as the ACE2-receptor interface region (N501Y), which comprises the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein. However, the molecular consequences of mutations within B.1.1.7 on spike protein dynamics and stability or ACE2 binding are largely unknown. Here, molecular dynamics simulations comparing SARS-CoV-2 wild type with the B.1.1.7 variant revealed inter-trimeric contact rearrangements, altering the structural flexibility within the spike protein trimer. Furthermore, we found increased flexibility in direct spatial proximity of the fusion peptide due to salt bridge rearrangements induced by the D614G mutation in B.1.1.7. This study also implies a reduced binding affinity for B.1.1.7 with ACE2, as the N501Y mutation restructures the RBD–ACE2 interface, significantly decreasing the linear interaction energy between the RBD and ACE2. Our results demonstrate how mutations found within B.1.1.7 enlarge the flexibility around the fusion peptide and change the RBD–ACE2 interface. We anticipate our findings to be starting points for in depth biochemical and cell biological analyses of B.1.1.7.","Socher, Eileen; Conrad, Marcus; Heger, Lukas; Paulsen, Friedrich; Sticht, Heinrich; Zunke, Friederike; Arnold, Philipp",Biomedicines,126,30

However, scant research has highlighted the distinctive features of Japan’s reaction and the challenges encountered. To clarify these points and examine Japan’s first response to COVID-19, we performed a content analysis. Minutes of expert meetings were analyzed from multiple viewpoints, including epidemiology, health systems, border control, and health communication. The obscure evolution of the testing strategy, the usefulness of retrospective contact tracing, the rapid scientific risk assessment, a sluggish expansion of health system capacity and response in border control, and misunderstanding between risk communication and crisis communication are made evident by our analysis. Examining previous responses and gathering lessons learned in each country will improve global responses to COVID-19 and strengthen regional health security.

Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based diagnostic tests are expensive, reliant on centralized labs, can take days to deliver results, and are prone to backlogs and supply shortages. Antigen tests that bind and detect the surface proteins of a virus are rapid and scalable but suffer from high false negative rates. To address this problem, an inexpensive, simple, and robust 60-minute do-it-yourself (DIY) workflow to detect viral RNA from nasal swabs or saliva with high sensitivity (0.1 to 2 viral particles/μL) and specificity (>97% true negative rate) utilizing reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) was developed. ALERT (Accessible LAMP-Enabled Rapid Test) incorporates the following features: (1) increased shelf-life and ambient temperature storage, compared to liquid reaction mixes, by using wax layers to isolate enzymes from other reagents; (2) improved specificity compared to other LAMP end-point reporting methods, by using sequence-specific QUASR (quenching of unincorporated amplification signal reporters); (3) increased sensitivity, compared to methods without purification through use of a magnetic wand to enable pipette-free concentration of sample RNA and cell debris removal; (4) quality control with a nasopharyngeal-specific mRNA target; and (5) co-detection of other respiratory viruses, such as influenza B, by multiplexing QUASR-modified RT-LAMP primer sets.

The objective of this study was to assess feasibility and safety of tDCS for stroke in an outpatient clinical setting. Individuals with stroke in outpatient therapy received tDCS during physical therapy sessions. Feasibility was assessed with screening, enrollment, withdrawal, and adherence numbers, tDCS impressions, and perceived benefits and detriments of tDCS. Acute changes in fatigue and self-reported function and pre-post changes in fatigue were also assessed. Safety was assessed as adverse events and side effects. In total, 85 individuals were screened, and 10 were enrolled. Most exclusions were unrelated to clinical feasibility. In total, 3 participants withdrew, so 7 participants completed 2 sessions/week for 5–6 weeks with 100% adherence. In total, 71% reported positive impressions of tDCS. tDCS setup decreased to 5–7 min at end of study. There was one adverse event unrelated to tDCS. Mild to moderate side effects (tingling, itching, pinching, and fatigue) were experienced. In total, 86% of participants recounted benefits of tDCS. There were acute improvements in function and energy.

Since these seminal developments, neuropathological, neurochemical, molecular biological and genetic discoveries contributed to elucidate the pathology of PD. Oxidative stress, the consequences of reactive oxidative species, reduced antioxidative capacity including loss of glutathione, excitotoxicity, mitochondrial dysfunction, proteasomal dysfunction, apoptosis, lysosomal dysfunction, autophagy, suggested to be causal for ɑ-synuclein fibril formation and aggregation and contributing to neuroinflammation and neural cell death underlying this devastating disorder. However, there are no final conclusions about the triggered pathological mechanism(s) and the follow-up of pathological dysfunctions. Nevertheless, it is a fact, that iron, a major component of oxidative reactions, as well as neuromelanin, the major intraneuronal chelator of iron, undergo an age-dependent increase. And ageing is a major risk factor for PD. Iron is significantly increased in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) of PD. Reasons for this finding include disturbances in iron-related import and export mechanisms across the blood–brain barrier (BBB), localized opening of the BBB at the nigro-striatal tract including brain vessel pathology. Whether this pathology is of primary or secondary importance is not known. We assume that there is a better fit to the top-down hypotheses and pathogens entering the brain via the olfactory system, then to the bottom-up (gut-brain) hypothesis of PD pathology. Triggers for the bottom-up, the dual-hit and the top-down pathologies include chemicals, viruses and bacteria. If so, hepcidin, a regulator of iron absorption and its distribution into tissues, is suggested to play a major role in the pathogenesis of iron dyshomeostasis and risk for initiating and progressing ɑ-synuclein pathology. The role of glial components to the pathology of PD is still unknown. However, the dramatic loss of glutathione (GSH), which is mainly synthesized in glia, suggests dysfunction of this process, or GSH uptake into neurons. Loss of GSH and increase in SNpc iron concentration have been suggested to be early, may be even pre-symptomatic processes in the pathology of PD, despite the fact that they are progression factors. The role of glial ferritin isoforms has not been studied so far in detail in human post-mortem brain tissue and a close insight into their role in PD is called upon. In conclusion, “iron” is a major player in the pathology of PD. Selective chelation of excess iron at the site of the substantia nigra, where a dysfunction of the BBB is suggested, with peripherally acting iron chelators is suggested to contribute to the portfolio and therapeutic armamentarium of anti-Parkinson medications.","Riederer, P.; Monoranu, C.; Strobel, S.; Iordache, T.; Sian-Hülsmann, J.",J Neural Transm (Vienna),126,1

This study aimed to evaluate the effects of acute or recent infection with SARS-CoV-2 on the course and outcomes of dengue fever in children. We prospectively enrolled 44 children with a clinical and laboratory diagnosis of dengue fever. Assessment of acute and recent SARS-CoV-2 infection was done using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and IgG antibody through ELISA. Children were grouped based on evidence of SARS-CoV-2 exposure and clinical severity, and outcomes were compared. The median age of the study cohort was 96 months (interquartile range [IQR]: 69-129 months). Fever (98%), vomiting (78%), abdominal pain (68%), hepatomegaly (68%), and edema (32%) were the common features. About two-thirds (N = 30) had severe dengue; 20 (45%) had dengue shock. Liver dysfunction (58%) and acute kidney injury (25%) were other major organ dysfunctions. Nineteen (43%) children stayed in the pediatric intensive care unit for a median duration of 5 days (IQR: 2-11 days). None had acute SARS-CoV2 infection; however, IgG against SARS-CoV-2 was detected in 15 (34%) cases. Children with recent exposure to SARS-CoV-2 showed a trend toward a lower incidence of acute kidney injury, fewer organ dysfunctions, and a lower frequency of invasive ventilation. Four children (9%) died; none of the deaths were in the SARS-CoV-2-exposed group. The present study exposes preliminary evidence that dengue fever might follow a less severe course in children with recent exposure to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

However, there are anecdotal reports of hospitalization from protracted COVID-19 complications despite such confirmed viral clearance, presenting a clinical conundrum. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of 222 hospitalized COVID-19 patients to compare those that were readmitted post-viral clearance (hospitalized post-clearance cohort, n = 49) with those that were not re-admitted post-viral clearance (non-hospitalized post-clearance cohort, n = 173) between February and October 2020. In order to differentiate these two cohorts, we used neural network models for the ‘augmented curation’ of comorbidities and complications with positive sentiment in the Electronic Hosptial Records physician notes. FINDINGS: In the year preceding COVID-19 onset, anemia (n = 13 [26.5%], p-value: 0.007), cardiac arrhythmias (n = 14 [28.6%], p-value: 0.015), and acute kidney injury (n = 7 [14.3%], p-value: 0.030) were significantly enriched in the physician notes of the hospitalized post-clearance cohort.

The development of severe disease and mortality is higher in older individuals, males and those with other co-morbidities, and may vary across ethnic groups. However, so far, no host genetic factor has been clearly associated with susceptibility and development of severe disease. To understand the impact of host genetics on expression of ACE2 (SARS-CoV-2 receptor) during RNA virus infection we performed a GWAS for ACE2 expression in HCV-infected liver tissue from 195 individuals. We discovered that polymorphisms in the host IFNL region which control expression of IFNL3 and IFNL4 modulate ACE2 expression. ACE2 expression was regulated additionally by age, with a subsidiary effect of co-morbidity. The IFNL locus controlled expression of a gene network incorporating many well-known interferon-stimulated genes which anti-correlated with ACE2 transcript levels. The same anti-correlation was found in the gastrointestinal tract, a site of SARS-CoV-2 replication where inflammation driven interferon-stimulated genes are negatively correlated with ACE2 expression. The interferon dependent regulation of ACE2 was identified in a murine model of SARS-CoV-1 suggesting conserved regulation of ACE2 across species. Polymorphisms in the IFNL region, as well as age, may impact not only on classical antiviral responses but also on ACE2 with potential consequences for clinical outcomes in distinct ethnic groups and with implications for therapeutic interventions.","Ansari, M.

Water quality data based upon the real-time water monitoring for four locations (Below Tawi Bridge, Bhagwati Nagar, Belicharana and Surajpur) have been obtained from the web link of Jammu and Kashmir Pollution Control Board. The important parameters used in the present study include pH, alkalinity, hardness, conductivity, BOD and COD. The river was designated fit for bathing in all the monitoring locations except Bhagwati Nagar which recorded a BOD value >5 mg/L because of domestic sewage and municipal waste dumping. The overall water quality in the river during lockdown was good and falls in Class B with pH (7.0–8.5), alkalinity (23.25–185.0 mg/L), hardness (84.25–177.5 mg/L), conductivity (117–268 ms/cm). The improved water quality obtained during lockdown is never long-lasting as evident from the BOD and COD values observed during Unlock 1.0 due to accelerated anthropogenic activities in response to overcoming the economic loss, bringing the river water quality back to the degraded state. The statistical analysis known as cluster analysis has also been performed to evaluate the homogeneity of various monitoring sites based on the physicochemical variables.

As a sustainable and environmental friendly renewable energy power technology, concentrated solar power (CSP) integrates power generation and energy storage to ensure the smooth operation of the power system. However, the cost of CSP is an obstacle hampering the commercialization of this emerging industry, so the paper studies the technical characteristics, economic analysis, and policy implications of CSP. This paper sorts out the relevant policies of CSP and uses the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) model by considering financial parameters, investment parameters, operation and maintenance parameters, tax parameters, capacity parameters, etc., to analyze the economics of CSP. The model parameters are set by the actual situation of CSP projects. The economic evaluation of different technology types of parabolic trough (PT), solar tower (ST), secondary reflection ST, and linear Fresnel reflector (LFR) is carried out. The LCOE of PT project is 1.11 RMB/kWh (0.17 US$/kWh), the ST project is 0.93 RMB/kWh (0.14 US$/kWh), the secondary reflection ST project is 0.97 RMB/kWh (0.15 US$/kWh), and the LFR project is 0.92 RMB/kWh (0.14 US$/kWh). The results show that the grid parity era of CSP in China is within reach, and ST is the most potential technology type. Based on the results of economic analysis and the problems faced by CSP in China, this paper puts forward policy implications by preferential loans, tax incentives, and R&D fund support to promote the development of CSP.","Xu, Yan; Pei, Jiamei; Yuan, Jiahai; Zhao, Guohao",Environ Sci Pollut Res Int,126,6

This paper aims to evaluate lymphocyte subsets in the pathophysiology of COVID-19 and as predictive factors for severe disease. Patient and methods: A prospective cohort study of patients with SARS-CoV-2 bilateral pneumonia recruited at hospital admission. Demographics, medical history, and data regarding SARS-CoV-2 infection were recorded. Patients systematically underwent complete laboratory tests, including parameters related to COVID-19 as well as lymphocyte subsets study at the time of admission. Severe disease criteria were established at admission, and patients were classified on remote follow-up according to disease evolution. Linear regression models were used to assess associations with disease evolution, and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) and the corresponding Area Under the Curve (AUC) were used to evaluate predictive values. Results: Patients with critical COVID-19 showed a decrease in CD3+CD4+ T cells count compared to non-critical (278 (485 IQR) vs. 545 (322 IQR)), a decrease in median CD4+/CD8+ ratio (1.7, (1.7 IQR) vs. 3.1 (2.4 IQR)), and a decrease in median CD4+MFI (21,820 (4491 IQR) vs. 26,259 (3256 IQR)), which persisted after adjustment. CD3+CD8+ T cells count had a high correlation with time to hospital discharge (PC = −0.700 (−0.931, −0.066)).

The aim of this first-in-man study was to determine the effect of delta inulin adjuvant on the safety and immunogenicity of a reduced dose seasonal influenza vaccine. Healthy male and female adults aged 18–65 years were recruited to participate in a randomized controlled study to compare the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of a reduced-dose 2007 Southern Hemisphere trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine formulated with Advax™ delta inulin adjuvant (LTIV + Adj) when compared to a full-dose of the standard TIV vaccine which does not contain an adjuvant. LTIV + Adj provided equivalent immunogenicity to standard TIV vaccine as assessed by hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assays against each vaccine strain as well as against a number of heterosubtypic strains. HI responses were sustained at 3 months post-immunisation in both groups. Antibody landscapes against a large panel of H3N2 influenza viruses showed distinct age effects whereby subjects over 40 years old had a bimodal baseline HI distribution pattern, with the highest HI titers against the very oldest H3N2 isolates and with a second HI peak against influenza isolates from the last 5–10 years. By contrast, subjects >40 years had a unimodal baseline HI distribution with peak recognition of H3N2 isolates from approximately 20 years ago. The reduced dose TIV vaccine containing Advax adjuvant was well tolerated and no safety issues were identified. Hence, delta inulin may be a useful adjuvant for use in seasonal or pandemic influenza vaccines.

We show that after 72 hr of challenge, a spike-based vaccine confers acute protection in lung, but not in brain. However, combining a spike-based vaccine with a nucleocapsid-based vaccine confers acute protection in both lung and brain. These findings suggest that nucleocapsid-specific immunity can improve the distal control of SARS-CoV-2, suggesting the inclusion of nucleocapsid in next-generation COVID-19 vaccines.","Dangi, Tanushree; Class, Jacob; Palacio, Nicole; Richner, Justin M.; Penaloza-MacMaster, Pablo",Cell Rep,126,1

Additionally, a circular economy has been proposed as the most efficient production system since it allows for reducing and reutilizing different wastes. Current agriculture is responsible for producing high quantities of organic agricultural waste (e.g., discarded fruits and vegetables, peels, leaves, seeds or forestall residues), that usually ends up underutilized and accumulated, causing environmental problems. Interestingly, these agri-food by-products are potential sources of valuable bioactive molecules such as tannins. Tannins are phenolic compounds, secondary metabolites of plants widespread in terrestrial and aquatic natural environments. As they can be found in plenty of plants and herbs, they have been traditionally used for medicinal and other purposes, such as the leather industry. This fact is explained by the fact that they exert plenty of different biological activities and, thus, they entail a great potential to be used in the food, nutraceutical and pharmaceutical industry.

This study utilized an Experience-Sampling-Method (ESM), using the smartphone-based mood monitoring application, MoodPrism. Participants were prompted once a day to complete a brief survey inquiring about symptoms of depression and anxiety, and several well-being indices, including arousal, emotional valence, self-esteem, motivation, social connectedness, meaning and purpose, and control. Participants were N = 755 Australians (aged 13 years and above) who downloaded and used MoodPrism, between 2018 and 2020. Results showed that anxiety symptoms significantly increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, but not during the bushfires.

In contrast, depressive symptoms increased significantly during the bushfires, which maintained during the pandemic. Most indices of well-being decreased significantly during the bushfires, and further again during the pandemic.

Non structural protein 1 (nsp1) is found in all beta coronavirus that cause severe respiratory disease. This protein is considered as a virulence factor and has an important role in pathogenesis. This study aims to elucidate the structural conformations of nsp1 to aid in the prediction of epitope sites and identification of important residues for targeted therapy against COVID-19. In this study, molecular modelling coupled with molecular dynamics simulations were performed to analyse the conformational landscape of nsp1 homologs of SARS-CoV1, SARS-CoV2 and MERS-CoV. Principal component analysis escorted by free energy landscape revealed that SARS-CoV2 nsp1 protein shows greater flexibility compared to SARS-CoV1 and MERS-CoV nsp1. Sequence comparison reveals that 28 mutations are present in SARS-CoV2 nsp1 protein compared to SARS-CoV1 nsp1. Several B-cell and T-cell epitopes were identified by an immunoinformatics approach. SARS-CoV2 nsp1 protein binds with the interface region of the palm and finger domain of POLA1 via hydrogen bonding and salt bridge interactions. Taken together, these in silico findings may help in the development of therapeutics specific against COVID-19.","Chaudhuri, Ankur",J Mol Struct,126,5

OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the effect of statins on mortality in four groups hospitalized with (SARS-CoV-2) infection (continued statin, newly initiated statin, discontinued statin, never on statin). DESIGN: In a single center cohort study of 1179 patients hospitalized with SARS-CoV-2 infection, the outcome of death, Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission or hospital discharge was evaluated. Patients’ statin use, laboratory data, and co-morbidities were determined via chart review and electronic health records. Using marginal structural models to account for timing of statin initiation and competing risks, we compared the likelihood of severe outcomes in the four statin exposure groups. SETTING: Academic medical center in the United States PARTICIPANTS: Patients hospitalized with SARS-CoV-2 infection MEASUREMENTS: 28-day mortality, ICU admission, or discharge RESULTS: Among 1179 patients, 360 were never on a statin, 311 were newly initiated on a statin, 466 were continued on a statin, and 42 had a statin discontinued. In this cohort, 154 (13.1%) patients died by 28-days. With marginal structural model analysis, statin use reduced the hazard of 28-day mortality (HR 0.566 [CI 0.372, 0.862], p = 0.008). Both new initiation of statins (HR 0.493 [CI 0.253, 0.963], p=0.038) and continuing statin therapy reduced the hazard of 28-day mortality (HR 0.270 [CI 0.114, 0.637], p=0.003). Sensitivity analysis found that statin use was associated with improved mortality for patients > 65 years, but not for patients 65 years or younger. LIMITATION: Observational design CONCLUSION: Statin therapy during hospitalization for SARS-CoV-2 infection, including new initiation and continuation of therapy, was associated with reduced short-term mortality.","Memel, Zoe N.; Lee, Jenny J.; Foulkes, Andrea S.; Chung, Raymond T.; Thaweethai, Tanayott; Bloom, Patricia P.",medRxiv,126,3

METHODS: We systematically searched Medline, Embase, Web of science, Cochrane CENTRAL and Google scholar to identify studies related to COVID-19 and 2009 influenza pandemic. The pooled incidence rates of clinical features were estimated using DerSimonian-Laird random-effects model with Freeman-Tukey double arcsine transformation method. RESULTS: We found the incidence rates of fever, cough, shortness of breath, sore throat, rhinorrhea, myalgia/muscle pain or vomiting were significantly higher in influenza compared to COVID-19 patients. The incidence rates of comorbidities including cardiovascular disease/ hypertension and diabetes were significantly higher in COVID-19 patients compared with influenza patients. In contrast, comorbidities such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and immunocompromised conditions were significantly more common in influenza compared to COVID-19 patients. Unexpectedly, the estimated rates of intensive care unit admission, treatment with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, treatment with antibiotics and fatality were comparable between hospitalized COVID-19 and 2009 influenza pandemic patients. CONCLUSIONS: This study comprehensively estimated the differences and similarities of the clinical features and burdens of hospitalized COVID-19 and 2009 influenza pandemic patients.

Such obese animals would not only allow us to explore obesity but would also represent models to study diseases and conditions that develop with obesity or where obesity represents a risk factor. Indeed, obese subjects, as well as animal models of obesity, develop pathologies such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, inflammation and metabolic disorders. Therefore, obese animals would represent models for numerous diseases. Although those diseases can be induced in animals by chemicals or drugs without obesity development, having them developed as consequences of obesity has numerous advantages. These advantages include mimicking natural pathogenesis processes, using diversity in obesity models (diet, animal species) to study the related variabilities and exploring disease intensity and reversibility depending on obesity development and treatments. Importantly, therapeutic implications and pharmacological tests represent key advantages too. On the other hand, obesity prevalence is continuously increasing, and, therefore, the likelihood of having a patient suffering simultaneously from obesity and a particular disease is increasing. Thus, studying diverse diseases in obese animals (either induced naturally or developed) would allow researchers to build a library of data related to the patterns or specificities of obese patients within the context of pathologies. This may lead to a new branch of medicine specifically dedicated to the diseases and care of obese patients, similar to geriatric medicine, which focuses on the elderly population.","Ghanemi, Abdelaziz; Yoshioka, Mayumi; St-Amand, Jonny",Medicina (Kaunas),126,20

However, the cost-prohibitive nature of highly localized data collection and sparsity of representative signals, has made it challenging to identify neighborhood scale prevalence of disease. To overcome this challenge, we utilize alternative data sources, which are both less sparse and representative of localized disease prevalence: using query data from a large commercial search engine, we identify the prevalence of respiratory illness in the United States, localized to census tract geographic granularity. Focusing on asthma and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), we construct a set of features based on searches for symptoms, medications, and disease-related information, and use these to identify illness rates in more than 23 thousand tracts in 500 cities across the United States. Out of sample model estimates from search data alone correlate with ground truth illness rate estimates from the CDC at 0.69 to 0.76, with simple additions to these models raising those correlations to as high as 0.84. We then show that in practice search query data can be added to other relevant data such as census or land cover data to boost results, with models that incorporate all data sources correlating with ground truth data at 0.91 for asthma and 0.88 for COPD.","Abdur Rehman, Nabeel; Counts, Scott",PLoS One,126,24

We assessed this relationship with influenza and other respiratory viruses in young children. Methods. A case-control study was nested within a prospective cohort study of acute respiratory illness (ARI) in Andean children <3 years of age (RESPIRA-PERU study). Weekly household visits were made to identify ARI and obtain nasal swabs for viral detection using real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. Monthly nasopharyngeal (NP) samples were obtained to assess pneumococcal colonization. We determined whether specific respiratory viral ARI episodes occurring within the interval between NP samples increased the risk of NP acquisition of new pneumococcal serotypes. Results. A total of 729 children contributed 2128 episodes of observation, including 681 pneumococcal acquisition episodes (new serotype, not detected in prior sample), 1029 nonacquisition episodes (no colonization or persistent colonization with the same serotype as the prior sample), and 418 indeterminate episodes. The risk of pneumococcal acquisition increased following influenza-ARI (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 2.19; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02–4.69) and parainfluenza-ARI (AOR, 1.86; 95% CI, 1.15–3.01), when compared with episodes without ARI. Other viral infections (respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, human rhinovirus, and adenovirus) were not associated with acquisition. Conclusions. Influenza and parainfluenza ARIs appeared to facilitate pneumococcal acquisition among young children. As acquisition increases the risk of pneumococcal diseases, these observations are pivotal in our attempts to prevent pneumococcal disease.","Grijalva, Carlos G.; Griffin, Marie R.; Edwards, Kathryn M.; Williams, John V.; Gil, Ana I.; Verastegui, Hector; Hartinger, Stella M.; Vidal, Jorge E.; Klugman, Keith P.; Lanata, Claudio F.",Clinical Infectious Diseases,126,33

People who were born preterm may be at greater risk for COVID-19 because their early exposure to oxygen at birth increases their risk of being hospitalized when infected with RSV and other respiratory viruses. Our prior studies in mice showed how high levels of oxygen (hyperoxia) between postnatal days 0–4 increases the severity of influenza A virus infections by reducing the number of alveolar epithelial type 2 (AT2) cells. Because AT2 cells express the SARS-CoV-2 receptors angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE2) and transmembrane protease/serine subfamily member 2 (TMPRSS2), we expected their expression would decline as AT2 cells were depleted by hyperoxia. Instead, we made the surprising discovery that expression of Ace2 and Tmprss2 mRNA increases as mice age and is accelerated by exposing mice to neonatal hyperoxia. ACE2 is primarily expressed at birth by airway Club cells and becomes detectable in AT2 cells by one year of life. Neonatal hyperoxia increases ACE2 expression in Club cells and makes it detectable in 2-month-old AT2 cells. This early and increased expression of SARS-CoV-2 receptors was not seen in adult mice who had been administered the mitochondrial superoxide scavenger mitoTEMPO during hyperoxia. Our finding that early life insults such as hyperoxia enhances the age-dependent expression of SARS-CoV-2 receptors in the respiratory epithelium helps explain why COVID-19 lung disease is greater in the elderly and people with pre-existing co-morbidities.","Yee, Min; Cohen, E.

Chemokine receptor 2 (CCR2)-dependent monocyte trafficking plays an essential role in the establishment of CD8 TRMs in lungs of IAV-infected mice. Here, we used a combination adjuvant-based subunit vaccine strategy that evokes multifaceted (TC1/TC17/TH1/TH17) IAV nucleoprotein-specific lung TRMs, to determine whether CCR2 and monocyte infiltration are essential for vaccine-induced TRM development and protective immunity to IAV in lungs. Following intranasal vaccination, neutrophils, monocytes, conventional dendrtitic cells (DCs) and monocyte-derived DCs internalized and processed vaccine antigen in lungs. We also found that Basic Leucine Zipper ATF-Like Transcription Factor 3 (BATF-3)-dependent DCs were essential for eliciting T cell responses, but CCR2 deficiency enhanced the differentiation of CD127HI/KLRG-1LO, OX40+veCD62L+ve and mucosally imprinted CD69+veCD103+ve effector and memory CD8 T cells in lungs and airways of vaccinated mice. Mechanistically, increased development of lung TRMs, induced by CCR2 deficiency was linked to dampened expression of T-bet, but not altered TCF-1 levels or T cell receptor signaling in CD8 T cells. T1/T17 functional programming, parenchymal localization of CD8/CD4 effector and memory T cells, recall T cell responses and protective immunity to a lethal IAV infection were unaffected in CCR2-deficient mice. Taken together, we identified a negative regulatory role for CCR2 and monocyte trafficking in mucosal imprinting and differentiation of vaccine-induced TRMs. Mechanistic insights from this study may aid the development of T-cell-based vaccines against respiratory viral pathogens including IAV and SARS-CoV-2. Importance While antibody-based immunity to influenza A virus (IAV) is type and sub-type specific, lung and airway-resident memory T cells that recognize conserved epitopes in the internal viral proteins are known to provide heterosubtypic immunity. Hence, broadly protective IAV vaccines need to elicit robust T-cell memory in the respiratory tract. We have developed a combination adjuvant-based IAV nucleoprotein vaccine that elicits strong CD4 and CD8 T cell memory in lungs and protects against H1N1 and H5N1 strains of IAV. In this study, we examined the mechanisms that control vaccine-induced protective memory T cells in the respiratory tract. We found that trafficking of monocytes into lungs might limit the development of anti-viral lung-resident memory T cells, following intranasal vaccination. These findings suggested that strategies that limit monocyte infiltration can potentiate vaccine-induced frontline T-cell immunity to respiratory viruses such as IAV and SARS-CoV-2.","Lee, Woojong; Kingstad-Bakke, Brock; Kedl, Ross M.; Kawaoka, Yoshihiro; Suresh, M.",bioRxiv,126,5

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new strain of coronavirus that causes the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). WHO has identified COVID-19 as a pandemic as it has spread across the globe due to its highly contagious nature. For early diagnosis of COVID-19, the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test is commonly done. However, it suffers from a high false-negative rate of up to 67% if the test is done during the first five days of exposure. As an alternative, research on the efficacy of deep learning techniques employed in the identification of COVID-19 disease using chest X-ray images is intensely pursued. As pneumonia and COVID-19 exhibit similar/ overlapping symptoms and affect the human lungs, a distinction between the chest X-ray images of pneumonia patients and COVID-19 patients becomes challenging. In this work, we have modeled the COVID-19 classification problem as a multiclass classification problem involving three classes, namely COVID-19, pneumonia, and normal. We have proposed a novel classification framework which combines a set of handpicked features with those obtained from a deep convolutional neural network. The proposed framework comprises of three modules. In the first module, we exploit the strength of transfer learning using ResNet-50 for training the network on a set of preprocessed images and obtain a vector of 2048 features. In the second module, we construct a pool of frequency and texture based 252 handpicked features that are further reduced to a set of 64 features using PCA. Subsequently, these are passed to a feed forward neural network to obtain a set of 16 features. The third module concatenates the features obtained from first and second modules, and passes them to a dense layer followed by the softmax layer to yield the desired classification model. We have used chest X-ray images of COVID-19 patients from four independent publicly available repositories, in addition to images from the Mendeley and Kaggle Chest X-Ray Datasets for pneumonia and normal cases. To establish the efficacy of the proposed model, 10-fold cross-validation is carried out. The model generated an overall classification accuracy of 0.974 [Formula: see text] 0.02 and a sensitivity of 0.987 [Formula: see text] 0.05, 0.963 [Formula: see text] 0.05, and 0.973 [Formula: see text] 0.04 at 95% confidence interval for COVID-19, normal, and pneumonia classes, respectively. To ensure the effectiveness of the proposed model, it was validated using an independent Chest X-ray cohort and an overall classification accuracy of 0.979 was achieved. Comparison of the proposed framework with state-of-the-art methods reveal that the proposed framework outperforms others in terms of accuracy and sensitivity. Since interpretability of results is crucial in the medical domain, the gradient-based localizations are captured using Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM). In summary, the results obtained are stable over independent cohorts and interpretable using Grad-CAM localizations that serve as clinical evidence.","Rajpal, Sheetal; Lakhyani, Navin; Singh, Ayush Kumar; Kohli, Rishav; Kumar, Naveen",Chaos Solitons Fractals,126,21

This is the first study to compare injury pattern during the two months lockdown period with the data of corresponding months from years 2016-2020. Also we compared the age- and sex-wise distribution patterns of these injuries for the above mentioned period. METHODS: This retrospective cross sectional study was conducted by the Department of Orthopaedics in Guru Gobind Singh Medical College and Hospital (GGSMCH) in Faridkot, Punjab. Secondary data for patient's age and sex, mode of injury, and site of injury was collected through record review for the period of two months (24(th) March to 24(th) May) for five consecutive years of 2016-2020. Descriptive analysis and Chi-square test was used to see the association between age and sex with mode and type of injury. RESULTS: The five year injury trends reflected that the proportion of injuries in 2016 was 16.5% (n = 48) of the total musculoskeletal injuries (n = 291) which rose to 23.4% (n = 68) in 2020. Majority of the patients were males (80%), and belonged to adult age group (69.4%) followed by elderly (17.2%), adolescents (8.6%) and children (4.8%). The proportion of road traffic accidents out of all injuries significantly reduced during the lock down period of two months in 2020 (p = 0.001). On the contrary, the proportion of injuries due to falls as well as unspecified assault increased significantly in 2020 as compared to previous years. CONCLUSIONS: The proportion of musculoskeletal injuries have increased from 2016-2020. Unspecified assault and all types of falls pushed the road traffic accidents to third position during the lockdown period in 2020 as compared to previous four years.

Because of the low oral bioavailability and improvement of buccal/oral cavity hygiene, traditional use by chewing B. serrata gum may be more beneficial than oral use. It is the cheapest option for a lot of poorer people. The promising effect of B. serrata and BA can be attributed to its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, cardioprotective, anti-platelet aggregation, antibacterial, antifungal, and broad antiviral activity. B. serrata and BA act by multiple mechanisms. The most common mechanism may be through direct interaction with IκB kinases and inhibiting nuclear factor-κB-regulated gene expression. However, the most recent mechanism proposed that BA not only inhibited the formation of classical 5-lipoxygenase products but also produced anti-inflammatory LOX-isoform-selective modulators. In conclusion a small to moderate dose B. serrata extract may be useful in the enhancing adaptive immune response in mild to moderate symptoms of COVID-19. However, large doses of BA may be beneficial in suppressing uncontrolled activation of the innate immune response. More clinical results are required to determine with certainty whether there is sufficient evidence of the benefits against COVID-19.","Gomaa, Adel A.; Mohamed, Hamdy S.; Abd-ellatief, Rasha Bakheet; Gomaa, Mohamed A.",Inflammopharmacology,126,26

El diagnóstico es clínico, por lo que es fundamental un acucioso examen físico y una neumootoscopía para evaluar la movilidad timpánica. Hay dos tendencias respecto al manejo, tratamiento antibiótico inmediato u observación estricta (dependiendo de las características del paciente y del cuadro clínico). Los gérmenes más frecuentes son los virus, Neumococo, Haemophilus influenza y Moraxella catarrhalis. La prevalencia de cada uno de ellos varía según región geográfica y según la presencia de vacunación. La resistencia a antibióticos ha ido en aumento en estos años, pero aún puede considerarse sensible a amoxicilina por lo que se recomienda su uso como primera línea. En el caso de fracaso a tratamiento pueden utilizarse asociaciones con B-lactámicos y/o cefalosporinas, dejando en forma excepcional clindamicina o quinolonas. Aquellos niños con OMA recurrente requerirán evaluación por especialidad para mayor estudio y tratamiento. SUMMARY Acute otitis media is a very frequent cause of medical visit and antimicrobial use in children. Clinical diagnosis should be performed with pneumatic otoscopy. Management of AOM requires a thorough clinical exam and updated knowledge of local patterns of microorganisms involved and antimicrobial susceptibility profiles, knowing that the presence of these microorganisms in AOM transtimpanic exudate cultures may vary depending on geographical areas and vaccination. AOM can be treated either with inmediate antibiotic or with observation depending on patients and clinical characteristics. The most common microorganism causing AOM are Pneumococcus, Haemophilus Influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. S. pneumoniae has acquired resistance to penicillin in the last decade that cannot be extrapolated to Amoxicillin. Based on this data Amoxicillin is recommended as the first choice. For amoxicillin failure, cefalosporins or B lactamase can be prescribed. Patients that presents with recurrent AOM should be refered to otolaryngologist for further evaluation and treatment.","Krause, Francisco J.",Revista Médica Clínica Las Condes,126,26

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a cross-sectional (n =268) study from a public dental college in Riyadh. We collected data on MWB and CPS. An 18-item online survey was used to collect the responses from the participants. The inter-rater reliability for the finalised survey came out to be 0.86. RESULTS: The participants (54.3%) who were infected with COVID-19 recorded that their CPS were significantly affected (almost 4 times higher) as compared to others (OR= 4.02; P=0.0004). However, 42.2% reported infection control measures at clinics resulted in bringing significant (OR=2.22, P=0.04) psychological upsets, for those who were infected with COVID-19. Participants (45.1%) also reported that they have difficulty in recalling old memories or information due to the COVID-19 pandemic; among them, 46.7% were the ones who (and/or any family member) were exposed to COVID-19. CONCLUSION: The study spotlighted the extent of dental students’ MWB and its significant effect on their CPS once (themselves or a family member) infected with COVID-19. Moreover, levels of infection control measures at clinics resulted in psychological upsets for dental students. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The issue is fundamental as participants enter the clinical workforce and face the ever-increasing demands of dental practice.","Alrashed, Fahad Abdulaziz; Sattar, Kamran; Habib, Syed Rashid; Ahmad, Tauseef; Al Rashoud, Abdulaziz Saud; SAFHI, Turki ali Y; Almajed, Abdulrhman Hamad M; Alnafisah, Hamad Ali H; Alharbi, Norah Hamad; Alsubiheen, Abdulrahman",Psychol Res Behav Manag,126,19

However, the mechanisms underlying these neurologic complications remain elusive. In this study, we aimed at determining whether neurologic symptoms were caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) direct infection or by either systemic or local proinflammatory mediators. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, we checked for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by quantitative reverse transcription PCR, SARS-CoV-2–specific antibodies, and 49 cytokines/chemokines/growth factors (by Luminex) in the CSF +/− sera of a cohort of 22 COVID-19 patients with neurologic presentation and 55 neurologic control patients (inflammatory neurologic disorder [IND], noninflammatory neurologic disorder, and MS). RESULTS: We detected anti–SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin G in patients with severe COVID-19 with signs of intrathecal synthesis for some of them. Of the 4 categories of tested patients, the CSF of IND exhibited the highest level of cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors. By contrast, patients with COVID-19 did not present overall upregulation of inflammatory mediators in the CSF. However, patients with severe COVID-19 (intensive care unit patients) exhibited higher concentrations of CCL2, CXCL8, and vascular endothelium growth factor A (VEGF-A) in the CSF than patients with a milder form of COVID-19. In addition, we could show that intrathecal CXCL8 synthesis was linked to an elevated albumin ratio and correlated with the increase of peripheral inflammation (serum hepatocyte growth factor [HGF] and CXCL10). CONCLUSIONS: Our results do not indicate active replication of SARS-CoV-2 in the CSF or signs of massive inflammation in the CSF compartment but highlight a specific impairment of the neurovascular unit linked to intrathecal production of CXCL8.","Bernard-Valnet, Raphael; Perriot, Sylvain; Canales, Mathieu; Pizzarotti, Beatrice; Caranzano, Leonardo; Castro-Jiménez, Mayté; Epiney, Jean-Benoit; Vijiala, Sergiu; Salvioni-Chiabotti, Paolo; Anichini, Angelica; Salerno, Alexander; Jaton, Katia; Vaucher, Julien; Perreau, Matthieu; Greub, Gilbert; Pantaleo, Giuseppe; Du Pasquier, Renaud A.",Neurol Neuroimmunol Neuroinflamm,126,1

This paper provides information about perceptions and other factors that may influence smokers’ ENDS use and substitution for cigarettes. We conducted 12 online focus groups (N = 61) among smokers who had never tried using ENDS (Never Users, N = 11), currently used both cigarettes and ENDS (Dual Users, N = 21), used but discontinued ENDS (Rejectors, N = 14), and switched completely to ENDS use (Switchers, N = 15). Thematic analysis was used to interpret the transcripts. Participants described initial interest in trying ENDS in hopes of quitting smoking and because of convenience (i.e., due to rules, regulations, or social norms). Risk perceptions and higher prices relative to cigarettes were reported as disadvantages of ENDS that discouraged initiation. Dual Users and Rejectors reported product problems (e.g., products breaking) and dissatisfaction (i.e., inability to satisfy cravings for cigarettes) as factors that lowered their substitutability for cigarettes or led to discontinuing ENDS use. Switchers indicated that satisfaction, lack of product problems, and perceived safety facilitated successfully switching from cigarette smoking to exclusive ENDS use. However, Switchers reported trying many products before they found ones that satisfied their needs.

METHODS: Consecutive patients who underwent chest CT because of clinical suspicion of COVID-19 were included. CT scans were prospectively evaluated by frontline general radiologists who were on duty at the time when the CT scan was performed and retrospectively assessed by a chest radiologist in an independent and blinded manner. Real-time reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction was used as reference standard. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) were calculated. Sensitivity and specificity of the frontline general radiologists were compared to those of the chest radiologist using the McNemar test. RESULTS: 56 patients were included. Sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV for the frontline general radiologists were 89.3% [95% confidence interval (CI): 71.8%, 97.7%], 32.1% (95% CI: 15.9%, 52.4%), 56.8% (95% CI: 41.0%, 71.7%), and 75.0% (95% CI: 42.8%, 94.5%), respectively. Sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV for the chest radiologist were 89.3% (95% CI: 71.8%, 97.7%), 75.0% (95% CI: 55.1%, 89.3%), 78.1% (95% CI: 60.0%, 90.7%), and 87.5% (95% CI: 67.6%, 97.3%), respectively. Sensitivity was not significantly different (p = 1.000), but specificity was significantly higher for the chest radiologist (p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: Chest CT interpreted by frontline general radiologists achieves insufficient screening performance. Although specificity of a chest radiologist appears to be significantly higher, sensitivity did not improve. A negative chest CT result does not exclude COVID-19. ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: Our study shows that chest CT interpreted by frontline general radiologists achieves insufficient diagnostic performance to use it as an independent screening tool for COVID-19. Although specificity of a chest radiologist appears to be significantly higher, sensitivity is still insufficiently high.","Krdzalic, Jasenko; de Jaegere, Tom M.H.; Kwee, Robert M.",Br J Radiol,126,1

However, with COVID-19, eye infections and other unusual complications are possible with such unsuspected bacteria. CASE PRESENTATION: The patient is a 76-year-old white male from a nursing home tested positive for COVID-19 and was sent from a nursing facility for left eye drainage and psychiatric evaluation. Upon presentation, the patient was not fully oriented and could not provide a history of the eye drainage. CT scan showed sinusitis with left orbital and periorbital abscess formation, cellulitis, and extensive osteomyelitis. He underwent endoscopic transnasal drainage and orbiotomy. Cultures returned positive for methicillin-resistant Stapholococcus aureus (MRSA), Streptococcus constellatus, and Peptoniphilus indolicus. He was maintained on several days of IV antibiotics and returned to the nursing home. He then presented 2 months later and required enucleation of his globe, due to the presence of multiple scleral perforations in the setting of orbital abscess, as well as removal of necrotic orbital bone. CONCLUSIONS: Given the concomitant infection with COVID-19 and unusual presentation, the patient’s sinus cultures support the notion that COVID-19 can affect the presence of bacteria within certain anatomical regions. Specifically, Peptoniphilus indolicus is not normally found outside of the vagina or gut biome. Avascular, pale mucosa and bone of the nasal cavity was noted during surgery of this COVID-19 infected patient, which is in contrast to the friable and edematous tissue typically found in acutely infected sinuses. Our patient’s orbital abscess began to drain spontaneously through the skin, which is rare for orbital abscesses. Also uncommon with orbital abscesses is the need for enucleation, which in this case was deemed necessary given that the abscess had perforated the sclera in multiple locations.","Shires, Courtney Brooke; Klug, Theodore; Dryden, Stephen; Ford, Joshua",Int J Surg Case Rep,126,24

METHODS: Data were collected at two time points in the winter in Hong Kong, during which influenza is most prevalent. At Time 1, older adults (N = 141) completed self-report measures of SDT (perceived autonomy support from senior center staff, autonomous motivation for influenza prevention) and TPB (attitude, subjective norm, perceived behavioral control, and intention for influenza prevention) constructs with respect to facemask used to prevent infection. Two weeks later, at Time 2, participants’ acceptance of a facemask to prevent influenza in the presence of an experimenter with flu-like symptoms was recorded. RESULTS: Path analysis found that perceived autonomy support of senior center staff was positively and significantly linked to autonomous motivation for facemask use, which, in turn, was positively related to intentions to wear facemasks through the mediation of attitude, subjective norm, and perceived behavioral control. However, the effect of intention on facemask use was not significant. CONCLUSIONS: Results generally support the proposed framework and the findings of previous studies with respect to intention, but the non-significant intention-behavior relationship may warrant future research to examine the reasons for older adults not to wear facemasks to prevent seasonal influenza despite having positive intentions to do so.","Chung, Pak-Kwong; Zhang, Chun-Qing; Liu, Jing-Dong; Chan, Derwin King-Chung; Si, Gangyan; Hagger, Martin S.",BMC Public Health,126,1

The intervention was developed using the International Patient Decision Aids Standards quality criteria and Ottawa Decision Support Framework. Twelve focus groups were conducted (September and October 2020) to explore the views of healthcare professionals (HCPs) and relatives of children with β-TM, in six cities. The focus groups were attended by 117 participants (60 HCPs and 57 relatives). Thematic analysis showed that the DeSIRe was considered acceptable for supporting relatives to make informed decisions about cascade screening, and potentially feasible for use in clinical practice. Suggestions for changing some words, the structure and adding information about how carrier testing relates to consanguineous marriages will enable further development of the DeSIRe. Participants generally welcomed the DeSIRe; however, they highlighted the perceived need to use more directive language, hence showed a cultural preference for directive genetic counselling.

To assess the analytical performance of the SD BIOLINE Rota/Adeno Rapid kit, we determined its detection limit, reproducibility, cross-reactivity, and analytical reactivity for adenovirus subtypes, and performed interference studies. RESULTS: The overall agreement rates among the tested methods were 91.5% for rotavirus and 85.5% for adenovirus. On the basis of mRT-PCR, the overall agreement, positive agreement, and negative agreement rates of the ICA were 95.6%, 100%, and 94.9% for rotavirus, and 94.0%, 71.4%, and 94.8% for adenovirus, respectively. Using the ICA, we detected all the subtypes of adenovirus tested, but the analytical reactivities for adenovirus subtypes were different between the 4 adenovirus detection methods.

In light of the recent surge in reported infections we have developed asymmetric five-primer reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) assays for detection of MERS-CoV. Isothermal amplification assays will facilitate the development of portable point-of-care diagnostics that are crucial for management of emerging infections. The RT-LAMP assays are designed to amplify MERS-CoV genomic loci located within the open reading frame (ORF)1a and ORF1b genes and upstream of the E gene. Additionally we applied one-step strand displacement probes (OSD) for real-time sequence-specific verification of LAMP amplicons. Asymmetric amplification effected by incorporating a single loop primer in each assay accelerated the time-to-result of the OSD-RT-LAMP assays. The resulting assays could detect 0.02 to 0.2 plaque forming units (PFU) (5 to 50 PFU/ml) of MERS-CoV in infected cell culture supernatants within 30 to 50 min and did not cross-react with common human respiratory pathogens.","Bhadra, Sanchita; Jiang, Yu Sherry; Kumar, Mia R.; Johnson, Reed F.; Hensley, Lisa E.; Ellington, Andrew D.",PLoS One,126,16

What is not clear for SARS-CoV-2 is how rapidly this response occurs, or when antibodies with protective capability evolve. Hence, defining the events of SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion and the time frame for the development of antibodies with protective potential may help to explain the different clinical presentations of COVID-19. Furthermore, accurate descriptions of seroconversion are needed to inform the best use of serological assays for diagnostic testing and serosurveillance studies. Here, we describe the humoral responses in a cohort of hospitalised COVID-19 patients (n = 19) shortly following the onset of symptoms. Commercial and ‘in-house’ serological assays were used to measure IgG antibodies against different SARS-CoV-2 structural antigens–Spike (S) S1 sub-unit and Nucleocapsid protein (NP)–and to assess the potential for virus neutralisation mediated specifically by inhibition of binding between the viral attachment protein (S protein) and cognate receptor (ACE-2). Antibody response kinetics varied amongst the cohort, with patients seroconverting within 1 week, between 1–2 weeks, or after 2 weeks, following symptom onset. Anti-NP IgG responses were generally detected earlier, but reached maximum levels slower, than anti-S1 IgG responses. The earliest IgG antibodies produced by all patients included those that recognised the S protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) and were capable of inhibiting binding to ACE-2. These data revealed events and patterns of SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion that may be important predictors of the outcome of infection and guide the delivery of clinical services in the COVID-19 response.","Murrell, Isa; Forde, Donall; Zelek, Wioleta; Tyson, Linda; Chichester, Lisa; Palmer, Nicki; Jones, Rachel; Morgan, B.

The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in millions of workers being repeatedly laid off and rehired according to local public health conditions. This may be bad news for market efficiency. Typical employment relations—which resemble non-enforceable (implicit) contracts—rely on reciprocity (Brown et al. in Econometrica 72:747–780, 2004), and hence could be harmed when workers’ efforts no longer guarantee reemployment in the next period. In this paper we extend the BFF paradigm to include a per-period probability (0%, 10%, 50%) of publicly observable “shutdown”, where a specific firm cannot contract with any workers for several periods. A Perfect Bayesian Equilibrium exists in which these shutdowns destabilize relationships, but do not harm efficiency. Our experiment shows that, remarkably, market efficiency can be maintained even with very frequent stochastic shutdowns. However, the dynamic of relational contracts changes from one where a worker finds stable employment to one where she juggles multiple employers, laying the burden of maintaining productivity upon workers and worsening worker-side inequality.

The benefit of machine learning, as an essential aspect of artificial intelligence, on past epidemics offers a new line to tackle the novel Coronavirus outbreak. Accurate short-term forecasting of COVID-19 spread plays an essential role in improving the management of the overcrowding problem in hospitals and enables appropriate optimization of the available resources (i.e., materials and staff).This paper presents a comparative study of machine learning methods for COVID-19 transmission forecasting. We investigated the performances of deep learning methods, including the hybrid convolutional neural networks-Long short-term memory (LSTM-CNN), the hybrid gated recurrent unit-convolutional neural networks (GAN-GRU), GAN, CNN, LSTM, and Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM), as well as baseline machine learning methods, namely logistic regression (LR) and support vector regression (SVR). The employment of hybrid models (i.e., LSTM-CNN and GAN-GRU) is expected to eventually improve the forecasting accuracy of COVID-19 future trends. The performance of the investigated deep learning and machine learning models was tested using confirmed and recovered COVID-19 cases time-series data from seven impacted countries: Brazil, France, India, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, and the US. The results reveal that hybrid deep learning models can efficiently forecast COVID-19 cases. Also, results confirmed the superior performance of deep learning models compared to the two considered baseline machine learning models. Furthermore, results showed that LSTM-CNN achieved improved performances with an averaged mean absolute percentage error of 3.718%, among others.","Dairi, Abdelkader; Harrou, Fouzi; Zeroual, Abdelhafid; Hittawe, Mohamad Mazen; Sun, Ying",J Biomed Inform,126,27

In this study, a PDCoV isolate, CHN-SC2015, was isolated from Sichuan Province in southwest China. The isolate was characterized by a cytopathic effect, immunofluorescence, and electron microscopy. CHN-SC2015 titers in LLC-PK cells ranged from 10(4.31) to 10(8.22) TCID(50)/mL during the first 30 passages. During serial passage, 11 nucleotide mutations occurred in the S gene, resulting in nine amino acid changes. A whole genome sequencing analysis demonstrated that CHN-SC2015 shares 97.5%–99.1% identity with 59 reference strains in GenBank. Furthermore, CHN-SC2015 contained 6-nt deletion and 9-nt insertion in the ORF1ab gene, 3-nt deletion in the S gene and 11-nt deletion in its 3′UTR compared with other reference strains available in GenBank. A phylogenetic analysis showed that CHN-SC2015 is more closely related to other PDCoV strains in China than to the strains from Southeast Asia, USA, Japan, and South Korea, indicating the diversity of genetic relationships and regional and epidemic characteristics among these strains. A recombination analysis indicated that CHN-SC2015 experienced recombination events between SHJS/SL/2016 and TT-1115. In vivo infection demonstrated that CHN-SC2015 is highly pathogenic to sucking piglets, causing diarrhea, vomiting, dehydration, and death. Virus was shed daily in the feces of infected piglets and upon necropsy, was found distributed in the gastrointestinal tract and in multiple organs.

Institutional implementation of the COVID-19-focused guidelines requires both proof of feasibility and education of HCW. Pediatric critical care medical directors at The University of Texas Southwestern/Children’s Health System of Texas (UTSW/CHST) created a guideline for the resuscitation of COVID-19 patients. The simulation team used in situ simulation to demonstrate guideline feasibility and to create educational materials. METHODS: A UTSW/CHST guideline incorporated COVID-19-focused AHA and other national organizational recommendations to fit the institutional needs. A high-fidelity in situ simulation helped test the feasibility and optimize the UTSW/CHST guideline. We developed a novel form of rapid cycle deliberate practice (RCDP), expert-driven RCDP, in which all simulation participants are experts, to debrief the simulation. RESULTS: In situ simulation with expert-driven RCDP demonstrated guideline feasibility in the resuscitation of a COVID-19 patient while balancing the protection of HCW. Expert-driven RCDP allowed for real-time alterations to the guideline during the simulation event. Video recording and dissemination of the simulation allowed for the education of over 300 staff on the new recommendations. CONCLUSIONS: High-fidelity in situ simulation with expert-driven RCDP created a rapid consensus among expert critical care providers to develop the UTSW/CHST guideline and quickly adopt the new AHA recommendations. This debriefing method helped minimize the risk of HCW exposure by minimizing the number of required participants and time for simulation. We recommend using this distinctive, expert-driven RCDP debriefing method for expeditious testing of COVID-19-focused processes at other institutions.

The concept of cytokine storm syndromes (CSS) encompasses diverse conditions or circumstances that coalesce around potentially lethal hyperinflammation with hemodynamic compromise and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. Macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) is a prototypic form of CSS that develops in the context of rheumatic diseases, particularly systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis. The treatment of MAS relies heavily upon corticosteroids and cytokine inhibitors, which have proven to be lifesaving therapies in MAS, as well as in other forms of CSS. Within months of the recognition of SARS-CoV2 as a human pathogen, descriptions of COVID-19 patients with hyperinflammation emerged. Physicians immediately grappled with identifying optimal therapeutic strategies for these patients, and despite clinical distinctions such as marked coagulopathy with endothelial injury associated with COVID-19, borrowed from the experiences with MAS and other CSS. Initial reports of patients treated with anti-cytokine agents in COVID-19 were promising, but recent large, better-controlled studies of these agents have had mixed results suggesting a more complex pathophysiology. Here, we discuss how the comparison of clinical features, immunologic parameters and therapeutic response data between MAS and hyperinflammation in COVID-19 can provide new insight into the pathophysiology of CSS.","Ombrello, Michael J.; Schulert, Grant S.",Transl Res,126,3

Few studies have explored the risk factors for the recovery time of patients with COVID-19. This study aimed to explore risk factors associated with long-term hospitalization in patients with COVID-19. Methods: In this retrospective study, patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 hospitalized in a hospital in Wuhan by March 30, 2020, were included. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, and radiological data from COVID-19 patients on hospital admission were extracted and were compared between the two groups, defined as short- and long-term hospitalization, respectively according to the median hospitalization time. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression methods were performed to identify risk factors associated with long-term hospitalization in patients with COVID-19. Results: A total of 125 discharged patients with COVID-19 were reviewed, including 123 general patients and two severe patients. The median hospitalization time was 13.0 days (IQR 10.0–17.0). Among them, 66 patients were discharged <14 days (short-term group) and 59 patients were discharged ≥14 days (long-term group). Compared with the short-term group, patients in the long-term group had significantly higher levels of C-reactive protein (P = 0.000), troponin I (P = 0.002), myoglobin (P = 0.037), aspartate aminotransferase (P = 0.005), lactic dehydrogenase (P = 0.000), prothrombin time (P = 0.030), fibrinogen (P = 0.000), and D-dimer (P = 0.006), but had significantly lower levels of lymphocyte count (P = 0.001), platelet count (P = 0.017), albumin (P = 0.001), and calcium (P = 0.000). Additionally, the incidences of hypocalcemia (P = 0.001), hyponatremia (P = 0.021), hypochloremia (P = 0.019), and bilateral pneumonia (P = 0.000) in the long-term group were significantly higher than those in the short-term group. Multivariable regression showed that hypocalcemia (P = 0.007, OR 3.313, 95% CI 1.392–7.886), hypochloremia (P = 0.029, OR 2.663, 95% CI 1.104–6.621), and bilateral pneumonia (P = 0.009, OR 5.907, 95% CI 1.073–32.521) were independent risk factors associated with long-term hospitalization in patients with COVID-19. Furthermore, a ROC curve where the area under the ROC was 0.766 for retained variables is presented. Conclusions: Hypocalcemia, hypochloremia, and bilateral pneumonia on hospital admission were independent risk factors associated with long-term hospitalization in patients with COVID-19. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to highlight the importance of electrolyte imbalance in predicting the hospitalization time of patients with COVID-19.","Wu, Yiqun; Hou, Bingbo; Liu, Jielan; Chen, Yingying; Zhong, Ping",Front Med (Lausanne),126,18

Here we investigate why a recently published study by van Dorp et al. failed to detect such higher transmissibility of the G614 variant using homoplasy-based methods. We show that both low diversity and recombination confound the methods utilized by van Dorp et al. and significantly decrease their sensitivity. Furthermore, though they claim no evidence of recombination in their dataset, we and several other studies identify a subset of the sequences as recombinants, possibly enough to affect their statistic adversely.","Giorgi, Elena E.; Bhattacharya, Tanmoy; Fischer, Will; Yoon, Hyejin; Abfalterer, Werner; Korber, Bette",bioRxiv,126,20

Methods: We conducted an online descriptive cross-sectional study among 273 undergraduate pharmacy students at the University of Zambia. A partial proportional odds regression model was used to determine the predictors of anxiety. All statistical tests were set at 95% confidence level (p<0.05). Results: A response rate of 70% was obtained with the majority of the students being female 51.6%. Of the 273 respondents, 23.8% did not experience anxiety, 34.4% experienced mild anxiety, 24.9% experienced moderate anxiety while 16.9% experienced severe anxiety about COVID-19. It was also found that 61.2% of students reported that their attention to mental health increased during the COVID-19 pandemic whereas 44.3% reported an increased resting time with a significant reduction in relaxation 51.3% and physical activity 45.4% time. Factors that affected mental health included; reduced family care (OR: 2.27; 95% CI: 1.09-4.74 ), not changing attention to mental health (OR: 0.33; 95% CI: 0.18-0.62), being in the final year of study (OR: 0.33; 95% CI: 0.13-0.84), reduced time of resting (OR: 2.10; 95% CI: 1.26-3.50) and feeling helpless (OR: 0.42; 95% CI:0.23-0.75).

Nowadays, IFNs (specifically type I IFNs), have been ascribed as the cytokines that bridge the innate and adaptive immunity soon after the recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) by the infected host. Notably, a unifying mechanism for type I IFN production has been established upon innate immune detection. Thus, TLR 3, 4, 7 and 9 associate endosomal recognition of PAMPs to type I IFN responses, a mechanism that has been shown in plasmacytoid dendritic cells to be dependent on the PI3K/mTOR/S6K pathway. It is worth noting that pathogen recognition triggers a fine-tuned controlled program that not only includes the production of antiviral (IFN) and pro-inflammatory cytokines to initiate the antiviral response but also signals the cessation of the response through the induction of suppressors of cytokine signaling (SOCS). SOCS in turn is under tight regulation of the TAM receptors (protein tyrosine kinase receptors TYRO3, AXL and MER), and activation of which thereby protects the host from the threats of autoimmune diseases.","Bonjardim, Cláudio A.; Ferreira, Paulo C.P.; Kroon, Erna G.",Immunol Lett,126,24

However, fairness perceptions did not differ anymore after the interview. Furthermore, there were no differences between the three interview media concerning psychological and physiological indicators of strain or interview anxiety.

These subjects develop local and systemic hyper-inflammation, which are associated with thrombotic complications and multi-organ failure. Therefore, understanding SARS-CoV-2 induced hyper-inflammation in elderly men is a pressing need. Here we focus on the role of extracellular DNA, mainly mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and telomeric DNA (telDNA) in the modulation of systemic inflammation in these subjects. In particular, extracellular mtDNA is regarded as a powerful trigger of the inflammatory response. On the contrary, extracellular telDNA pool is estimated to be capable of inhibiting a variety of inflammatory pathways. In turn, we underpin that telDNA reservoir is progressively depleted during aging, and that it is scarcer in men than in women. We propose that an increase in extracellular mtDNA, concomitant with the reduction of the anti-inflammatory telDNA reservoir may explain hyper-inflammation in elderly male affected by COVID-19. This scenario is reminiscent of inflamm-aging, the portmanteau word that depicts how aging and aging related diseases are intimately linked to inflammation.","Storci, Gianluca; Bonifazi, Francesca; Garagnani, Paolo; Olivieri, Fabiola; Bonafè, Massimiliano",Ageing Res Rev,126,16

Currently available instruments may not be sensitive to the concerns about COVID-19 in postacute and long-term care and their applications in telehealth remain to be clarified. OBJECTIVE: We investigated the psychometric properties of the Mood-5 Scale (M5) as a rapid self-assessment of the COVID-19 psychological burden among postacute and long-term care residents. METHODS: Residents (N=131), aged 50 years and above, from 20 postacute and long-term care facilities in Maryland, USA, were evaluated in-person or via telehealth (43/131, 32.8%) across a 4-week period (May 11 to June 5, 2020) during the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 psychological burden experienced by the residents was rated by geriatric psychologists who independently reviewed their clinical documentation. Psychometric analyses were performed on the M5 in relation to psychological tests, COVID-19 psychological burden, and diagnostic data collected during the evaluation. RESULTS: The M5 demonstrated acceptable internal consistency (Cronbach α=.77). M5 scores were not confounded by demographic variables or telehealth administration (P>.08). Convergent validity for the M5 was established via positive associations with anxiety (r=0.56, P<.001) and depressive (r=0.49, P<.001) symptoms. An M5 cutoff score of 3 demonstrated strong sensitivity (0.92) and adequate specificity (0.75) for identifying COVID-19 psychological distress among postacute and long-term care residents (area under the curve of 0.89, positive predictive value=0.79, negative predictive value=0.91). CONCLUSIONS: The M5 is a reliable and valid tool for self-assessment of mood that can help identify postacute and long-term care residents with significant psychological burden associated with COVID-19. It can be completed in less than 1 minute and is appropriate for use in both in-person and virtual visits.","Mansbach, William E; Mace, Ryan A; Tanner, Melissa A",JMIR Aging,126,30

METHODS: A cardiac phantom with a simulated PD was imaged under different R using different gamma cameras and reconstruction algorithms. The residual activity from precedent stress administration was simulated by modeling effective half-times in each compartment of the phantom and assuming a delay of 3 hours between the stress and rest studies. The net contrast (NC) of the PD in the rest study was assessed for different R, PD positions and scanner/software combinations. The optimal R will be the one that minimize the NC in the rest images RESULTS: The activity concentration ratio R, the position of the PD and the scanner/software combinations were all main effects with a statistically significant impact on the NC, in decreasing order of relevance. The NC diminished significantly only for R values up to 2. No further improvement was observed for NC for R values above 2 and up to 3. NC was significantly higher in anteroseptal than in posterolateral positions of the PD and higher for solid-state cameras. CONCLUSIONS: A rest-stress activity concentration ratio R of 2 in single-day stress-first myocardial perfusion imaging is enough to achieve the maximum net contrast in the PD. This ratio should be used to optimize patient’s radiation exposure.

Extracellular vesicles carry a variety of cargo, including RNAs, proteins, lipids and DNA, which can be taken up by other cells, both in the direct vicinity of the source cell and at distant sites in the body via biofluids, and elicit a variety of phenotypic responses. Owing to their unique biology and roles in cell–cell communication, extracellular vesicles have attracted strong interest, which is further enhanced by their potential clinical utility. Because extracellular vesicles derive their cargo from the contents of the cells that produce them, they are attractive sources of biomarkers for a variety of diseases. Furthermore, studies demonstrating phenotypic effects of specific extracellular vesicle-associated cargo on target cells have stoked interest in extracellular vesicles as therapeutic vehicles. There is particularly strong evidence that the RNA cargo of extracellular vesicles can alter recipient cell gene expression and function. During the past decade, extracellular vesicles and their RNA cargo have become better defined, but many aspects of extracellular vesicle biology remain to be elucidated. These include selective cargo loading resulting in substantial differences between the composition of extracellular vesicles and source cells; heterogeneity in extracellular vesicle size and composition; and undefined mechanisms for the uptake of extracellular vesicles into recipient cells and the fates of their cargo. Further progress in unravelling the basic mechanisms of extracellular vesicle biogenesis, transport, and cargo delivery and function is needed for successful clinical implementation.

METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional prevalence study at three maternity hospitals (one tertiary referral hospital and two secondary maternities) in Melbourne, Australia. SARS-CoV-2 testing was offered to all pregnant women attending face-to-face antenatal visits and to those attending the hospital with symptoms of possible coronavirus disease, between 6(th) and 19(th) of May 2020. Testing was performed by multiplex-tandem polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on combined oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal swabs. The primary outcome was the proportion of positive SARS-CoV-2 tests. FINDINGS: SARS-CoV-2 testing was performed in 350 women, of whom 19 had symptoms of possible COVID-19. The median maternal age was 32 years (IQR 28 to 35 years), and the median gestational age at testing was 33 weeks and four days (IQR 28 weeks to 36 weeks and two days).

The major clinical features include persistent fever, chills/rigor, myalgia, malaise, dry cough, headache and dyspnoea. Less common symptoms include sputum production, sore throat, coryza, dizziness, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. Older subjects may present with decrease in general well‐being, poor feeding, fall/fracture and delirium, without the typical febrile response. Common laboratory features include lymphopenia with depletion of CD4 and CD8 lymphocytes, thrombocytopenia, prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time, elevated D‐Dimer, elevated alanine transminases, lactate dehydrogenase and creatinine kinase. The constellation of compatible clinical and laboratory findings, together with the rather characteristic radiological features especially on HRCT and the lack of clinical response to broad‐spectrum antibiotics, should quickly arouse suspicion of SARS. The positivity rates of urine, nasophargyngeal aspirate and stool specimen have been reported to be 42%, 68% and 97%, respectively, on day 14 of illness, whereas serology for confirmation may take 28 days to reach a detection rate above 90%.

Since most respiratory viruses are known to show a seasonal pattern of infection, it has been hypothesised that SARS-CoV-2 may be seasonally dependent as well. The present study looks at a possible effect of atmospheric temperature, which is one of the suspected factors influencing seasonality, on the evolution of the pandemic. Basic procedures: Since confirming a seasonal pattern would take several more months of observation, we conducted an innovative day-to-day micro-correlation analysis of nine outbreak locations, across four continents and both hemispheres, in order to examine a possible relationship between atmospheric temperature (used as a proxy for seasonality) and outbreak progression. Main findings: There was a negative correlation between atmospheric temperature variations and daily new cases growth rates, in all nine outbreaks, with a median lag of 10 days. Principal conclusions: The results presented here suggest that high temperatures might dampen SARS-CoV-2 propagation, while lower temperatures might increase its transmission. Our hypothesis is that this could support a potential effect of atmospheric temperature on coronavirus disease progression, and potentially a seasonal pattern for this virus, with a peak in the cold season and rarer occurrences in the summer. This could guide government policy in both the Northern and Southern hemispheres for the months to come.","Rouen, A.; Adda, J.; Roy, O.; Rogers, E.; Lévy, P.",Epidemiology and infection,126,22

However, comprehensive global data analyses for its healthcare management are lacking. METHODS: In this study we have researched through published scientific articles and international health care guidelines to find out actually about our knowledge for this new pandemic from SARS-CoV-2 and related COVID-19 disease that emerged from December 2019 in China in order to better manage this health emergency. RESULTS: The pathogens represented by microorganisms (bacteria, mycetes or viruses) show their effect after days and are responsible for epidemics/pandemics as dangerous as the greater their possibility of transmission, especially by inhalation, and therefore their infectivity. CONCLUSIONS: The appearance of new pathogenic viruses for humans such as the SARS-CoV-2, which previously were found only in the animal world occurs through the spillover (is the third documented of an animal coronavirus to humans), it is thought that it could also be the same also for the origin of this virus.

Attempts were made to reduce footfall within all institutions and within the study unit; this led to alterations in fracture clinic provision. An alternative method was developed whereby most of the initial contacts were in person and much of the follow-up was done remotely. The aim of this study was to evaluate patient satisfaction and views on this alteration in service. Methods The first 299 patients who had fracture clinic appointments delivered by telephone consultation at this institution during the pandemic in early 2020 were retrospectively identified and sent a postal survey. Satisfaction levels were assessed through a degree of agreement with statements (nine items), yes/no answers (four questions), and space for comments. Results One hundred and thirty-one survey responses were included (44% response rate). The majority of patients (82%) were satisfied overall with the care they received. Although 78% of patients stated that they preferred a telephone consultation to attend a face-to-face hospital appointment during the pandemic, only 22% stated they would have preferred this in normal (pre-COVID-19) times. Interestingly 62% of patients stated they would be happy for further fracture clinic appointments to be carried out in the same way. Discussion Most of the remote consultations were in follow-up rather than new patients. Patients were adaptable to this alternative method of care delivery. There could be a role for its integration into the options for fracture clinic delivery in the future.","Graham, Selina; Lostis, Emilie; Pearce, Oliver; Kelly, Michael",Cureus,126,20

Eosinopenia may predict a poor prognosis of COVID-19. However, to date, there is no detailed analysis of the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients with eosinopenia. Research question: The aim of this study was to describe clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients with eosinopenia. Study Design and Methods: This was a multi-center retrospective study conducted in three tertiary hospitals. A total of 59 patients with COVID-19 were reviewed from January 23, 2020 to March 10, 2020. We described clincial characteristics of patients with COIVD-19 and eosinopenia phenotype. Results: The median age of patients with COVID-19 was 39 years old, and 32 (54,2%) were male. Patients with severe type had higher proportions of dyspnea (50%) and gastrointestinal symptoms (50%) compared with mild or moderate patients. Laboratory findings indicated that lower counts of lymphocyte and eosnophils were observed in patients with severe type. Cough, sputum, and fatigue were more common symptoms in eosinopenia patients compared with non-eosinopenia patients. High proportion of comorbidities was observed in eosinopenia patients. Laboratory findings indicated that lymphocyte counts (median: 101 cells/l ) in eosinopenia patients were significantly less than those of non-eosinopenia patients (median: 167 cells/l, p<0.001). The use of corticosteroids therapy in COVID-19 patients with eosinopenia were notably higher than those in patients with non-eosinopenia (50% vs 13.8%, respectively, p=0.005). Compared with parameters in non-eosinopenia patients, eosinopenia patients were more inclined to have less lymphocyte counts (OR value 6.566, 95%CI[1.101-39.173], p=0.039). Interpretation Eosinopenia are very common in COVID-19 patient, particularly in severe patients. Common symptoms included fever, cough, sputum, and fatigue are frequent in eosinopenia patients. Eosinopenia may represent a novel phenotype in COVID-19, which needs further investigation.","Cheng, Y.; Zhou, Y.; Zhu, M.; Zha, L.; Lu, Z.; Ding, Z.; Yang, J.; Yang, G.",,126,29

We commenced virtual reviews as an innovative way of offering the service at our large adult CF centre (350 pwCF), and maintained this for most pwCF when shielding ended in August 2020. We now report on the initial impact of this system on patient engagement with physiotherapy. Method: We compared outpatient clinic contacts pre-COVID (01/01/2020–17/03/2020) with remote contacts during shielding (18/3/20–31/7/20) and also when shielding had ended (up to 30/9/20), specifically looking at physiotherapy input. Results: Pre-COVID, there were 324 face-to-face clinic visits, where 244 pwCF (75%) accessed a physiotherapist, 9 (3%) declined review, and in 71 (22%) cases it was not offered due to lack of capacity. During shielding, in 424 virtual clinics, 352 pwCF (83%) accessed a physiotherapist, 64 (15%) declined/did not access physio, and 10 (2%) were not offered review. Once shielding ended, in 281 virtual clinics, 234 pwCF (83%) accessed physio review, 45 (16%) declined/did not access review and 7 (3%) were not offered review. Conclusion: We found virtual clinics during the COVID pandemic a useful way of providing physiotherapy review for our pwCF, and indeed it helped improve capacity. The increased capacity and uptake after shielding ended suggests preference by pwCF for reviews in this way.","Scott, E.; Ledson, M.; Walshaw, M.",Journal of Cystic Fibrosis,126,7

However, iNATs can generate spurious amplicons, especially in the absence of target sequences, resulting in false positive results. This is especially true if signals are based on non-sequence-specific probes, such as intercalating dyes or pH changes. In addition, pathogens often prove to be moving, evolving targets, and can accumulate mutations that will lead to inefficient primer binding and thus false negative results. Internally redundant assays targeting different regions of the target sequence can help to reduce such false negatives. Here we describe rapid conversion of three previously described SARS-CoV-2 LAMP assays that relied on non-sequence-specific readout into assays that can be visually read using sequence-specific fluorogenic oligonucleotide strand exchange (OSD) probes. We evaluate one-pot operation of both individual and multiplex LAMP-OSD assays and demonstrate detection of SARS-CoV-2 virions in crude human saliva.","Bhadra, Sanchita; Riedel, Timothy E.; Lakhotia, Simren; Tran, Nicholas D.; Ellington, Andrew D.",bioRxiv,126,26

Questions have been raised whether in Multiple Sclerosis (MS) patients they could induce disease exacerbation and whether vaccines could possibly act as a trigger in the onset of MS in susceptible populations. So far, no correlation has been found between the vaccinations against influenza, hepatitis B, tetanus, human papillomavirus, measles, mumps, rubella, varicella zoster, tuberculosis, yellow fever, or typhoid fever and the risk of MS. Further research is needed for the potential protective implications of the tetanus and Bacillus Calmette–Guerin vaccines in MS patients. Nowadays with the emerging coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and recent vaccinations approval and arrival, the risk-benefit in MS patients with regards to safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccination in those treated with immunosuppressive therapies is of paramount importance. In this manuscript, we demonstrate how different vaccine types could be related to the immunopathogenesis of MS and discuss the risks and benefits of different vaccinations in MS patients.","Witman Tsur, Shani; Adrian Zaher, Eli; Tsur, Meydan; Kania, Karolina; Kalinowska-Łyszczarz, Alicja",Int J Mol Sci,126,20

Here, the dynamics of this epidemic is studied by using a generalized logistic function model and extended compartmental models with and without delays. For a chosen population, it is shown as to how forecasting may be done on the spreading of the infection by using a generalized logistic function model, which can be interpreted as a basic compartmental model. In an extended compartmental model, which is a modified form of the SEIQR model, the population is divided into susceptible, exposed, infectious, quarantined, and removed (recovered or dead) compartments, and a set of delay integral equations is used to describe the system dynamics. Time-varying infection rates are allowed in the model to capture the responses to control measures taken, and distributed delay distributions are used to capture variability in individual responses to an infection. The constructed extended compartmental model is a nonlinear dynamical system with distributed delays and time-varying parameters. The critical role of data is elucidated, and it is discussed as to how the compartmental model can be used to capture responses to various measures including quarantining. Data for different parts of the world are considered, and comparisons are also made in terms of the reproductive number.

Furthermore, we report for the first time in South Korea that a domestic cat was infected with SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: An epidemiological investigation was conducted to investigate the group outbreak. In addition, to verify cat–cat or cat–human transmission, we monitored whether exposed cats or humans were infected. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) of the viral full-length genome test was conducted on the positive samples from both owners and the cats. RESULTS: Total number of SARS-CoV-2 cases rose from 78 individuals, who visited a religious facility who were involved in 42 transmitted cases in the community, either through close contact with household members (47.62%) or through a group outbreak (16.67%).
