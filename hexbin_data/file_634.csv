3620,Period of Measurement in Time-Series Predictions of Disease Counts from 2007 to 2017 in Northern Nevada: Analytics Experiment,2019-01-15,"BACKGROUND: The literature in statistics presents methods by which autocorrelation can identify the best period of measurement to improve the performance of a time-series prediction. The period of measurement plays an important role in improving the performance of disease-count predictions. However, from the operational perspective in public health surveillance, there is a limitation to the length of the measurement period that can offer meaningful and valuable predictions. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to establish a method that identifies the shortest period of measurement without significantly decreasing the prediction performance for time-series analysis of disease counts. METHODS: The data used in this evaluation include disease counts from 2007 to 2017 in northern Nevada. The disease counts for chlamydia, salmonella, respiratory syncytial virus, gonorrhea, viral meningitis, and influenza A were predicted. RESULTS: Our results showed that autocorrelation could not guarantee the best performance for prediction of disease counts. However, the proposed method with the change-point analysis suggests a period of measurement that is operationally acceptable and performance that is not significantly different from the best prediction. CONCLUSIONS: The use of change-point analysis with autocorrelation provides the best and most practical period of measurement.","Talaei-Khoei, Amir; Wilson, James M; Kazemi, Seyed-Farzan",JMIR Public Health Surveill,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6350093/,634
12542,Psychological distress among mountainous farmers in Vietnam: a cross-sectional study of prevalence and associated factors,2020-08-06,"PURPOSE: DM and trauma are leading causes of death in Hispanic patients, yet the interaction between them remains obscure. We aimed to assess the complications and in-hospital mortality rate of Hispanic diabetic trauma patients. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was carried out using data from the Puerto Rico Trauma Hospital databank. Patients were matched based on gender, age, mechanism of injury, Glasgow Coma Scale, and Injury Severity Score using propensity-score matching. From 2000 to 2014, a total of 1134 patients with DM were compared to 1134 patients who did not have DM. The outcomes measured were hospital and TICU lengths of stay, days on mechanical ventilation, complications, and in-hospital mortality rate. A logistic regression model was carried out to evaluate the relationship of DM with complications and mortality after trauma. RESULTS: Hispanic patients with DM had longer hospital and TICU stays and required mechanical ventilation for extended periods. Complications, predominantly of an infectious nature, were more common among DM patients than they were among non-DM patients: 31.3% in the DM group vs. 11.6% in the non-DM group (OR 3.46; 95% CI 2.77–4.31). Despite an increase in the number of complications, DM was not associated with higher in-hospital mortality rates. CONCLUSIONS: DM is associated with a twofold increase in complications in Hispanic diabetic trauma patients, which may account for their longer hospital and TICU stays. This indicates that diabetic Hispanic trauma patients may need earlier and more aggressive intervention to reduce their risk of developing complications.","Guzman-Martinez, Alanna Maria; Garcia-Rodriguez, Omar; Ramos-Melendez, Ediel Omar; Guerrios-Rivera, Lourdes; Rodriguez-Ortiz, Pablo",Eur J Trauma Emerg Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7427756/,634

17312,Nutritional Implications of Baby-Led Weaning and Baby Food Pouches as Novel Methods of Infant Feeding: Protocol for an Observational Study,2021-04-21,"BACKGROUND: Understanding the epidemic of chronic kidney disease of uncertain etiology may be critical for health policies and public health responses. Recent studies have shown that microplastics (MPs) contaminate our food chain and accumulate in the gut, liver, kidney, muscle, and so on. Humans manufacture many plastics-related products. Previous studies have indicated that particles of these products have several effects on the gut and liver. Polystyrene (PS)-MPs (PS-MPs) induce several responses, such as oxidative stress, and affect living organisms. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of PS-MPs in kidney cells in vitro and in vivo. METHODS: PS-MPs were evaluated in human kidney proximal tubular epithelial cells (HK-2 cells) and male C57BL/6 mice. Mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS), endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, inflammation, and autophagy were analyzed in kidney cells. In vivo, we evaluated biomarkers of kidney function, kidney ultrastructure, muscle mass, and grip strength, and urine protein levels, as well as the accumulation of PS-MPs in the kidney tissue. RESULTS: Uptake of PS-MPs at different concentrations by HK-2 cells resulted in higher levels of mitochondrial ROS and the mitochondrial protein Bad. Cells exposed to PS-MPs had higher ER stress and markers of inflammation. MitoTEMPO, which is a mitochondrial ROS antioxidant, mitigated the higher levels of mitochondrial ROS, Bad, ER stress, and specific autophagy-related proteins seen with PS-MP exposure. Furthermore, cells exposed to PS-MPs had higher protein levels of LC3 and Beclin 1. PS-MPs also had changes in phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and protein kinase B (AKT)/mitogen-activated protein kinase (mTOR) signaling pathways. In an in vivo study, PS-MPs accumulated and the treated mice had more histopathological lesions in the kidneys and higher levels of ER stress, inflammatory markers, and autophagy-related proteins in the kidneys after PS-MPs treatment by oral gavage. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that PS-MPs caused mitochondrial dysfunction, ER stress, inflammation, and autophagy in kidney cells and accumulated in HK-2 cells and in the kidneys of mice. These results suggest that long-term PS-MPs exposure may be a risk factor for kidney health. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP7612","Wang, Yung-Li; Lee, Yu-Hsuan; Hsu, Yung-Ho; Chiu, I-Jen; Huang, Cathy Chia-Yu; Huang, Chih-Chia; Chia, Zi-Chun; Lee, Chung-Pei; Lin, Yuh-Feng; Chiu, Hui-Wen",Environ Health Perspect,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8101928/,634

19478,Understanding the Lived Experience of North American Dental Patients With a Single-Tooth Implant in the Upper Front Region of the Mouth: Protocol for a Qualitative Study,2021-06-18,"The proliferation of internet-based home-sharing platforms like Airbnb has raised heated debates, with many in the general public believing that the presence of Airbnb listings can lead to an increase in crime and disorder in residential neighborhoods. Despite the importance of this debate to residents, policymakers, and other stakeholders, few studies have examined the causal linkage between Airbnb listings and crime in neighborhoods. We conduct the first such empirical test in Boston neighborhoods, focusing on two potential mechanisms: (1) the inflow of tourists might generate or attract crime; and (2) the creation of transient properties undermines local social dynamics. Corresponding to these mechanisms, we examine whether the number of tourists (approximated with reviews) or the prevalence of listings predict more incidents of private conflict, social disorder, and violence both concurrently and in the following year. We find evidence that increases in Airbnb listings–but not reviews–led to more violence in neighborhoods in later years. This result supports the notion that the prevalence of Airbnb listings erodes the natural ability of a neighborhood to prevent crime, but does not support the interpretation that elevated numbers of tourists bring crime with them.","Ke, Laiyang; T.

Owing to a tumultuous history, importance of ethical research cannot be over emphasized in today's world and the concept of informed consent becomes the guardian of ethics, not only to improve the bonding between the participant and researcher aiding a wholehearted involvement but also ensuring safety for the participants from research related injury/loss. Subject information sheet (SIF) and Informed consent form (ICF) are the fundamental elements of informed consent document. Process of obtaining them from illiterate and vulnerable populations involves the legally authorized representative (LAR) and impartial witness. Audiovisual recording becomes important in case of clinical trials. Process of obtaining informed consent becomes challenging for vulnerable populations as well as during pandemic situations.

20216,Integrated Smoking Cessation for Smokers With Serious Mental Illness: Protocol for a Convergent Mixed Methods Implementation Evaluation Study,2021-07-27,"BACKGROUND: Infections are among the leading causes of maternal mortality and morbidity. The Global Maternal Sepsis and Neonatal Initiative, launched in 2016 by WHO and partners, sought to reduce the burden of maternal infections and sepsis and was the basis upon which the Global Maternal Sepsis Study (GLOSS) was implemented in 2017. In this Article, we aimed to describe the availability of facility resources and services and to analyse their association with maternal outcomes. METHODS: GLOSS was a facility-based, prospective, 1-week inception cohort study implemented in 713 health-care facilities in 52 countries and included 2850 hospitalised pregnant or recently pregnant women with suspected or confirmed infections. All women admitted for or in hospital with suspected or confirmed infections during pregnancy, childbirth, post partum, or post abortion at any of the participating facilities between Nov 28 and Dec 4 were eligible for inclusion. In this study, we included all GLOSS participating facilities that collected facility-level data (446 of 713 facilities). We used data obtained from individual forms completed for each enrolled woman and their newborn babies by trained researchers who checked the medical records and from facility forms completed by hospital administrators for each participating facility. We described facilities according to country income level, compliance with providing core clinical interventions and services according to women's needs and reported availability, and severity of infection-related maternal outcomes. We used a logistic multilevel mixed model for assessing the association between facility characteristics and infection-related maternal outcomes. FINDINGS: We included 446 facilities from 46 countries that enrolled 2560 women. We found a high availability of most services and resources needed for obstetric care and infection prevention. We found increased odds for severe maternal outcomes among women enrolled during the post-partum or post-abortion period from facilities located in low-income countries (adjusted odds ratio 1·84 [95% CI 1·05–3·22]) and among women enrolled during pregnancy or childbirth from non-urban facilities (adjusted odds ratio 2·44 [1·02–5·85]). Despite compliance being high overall, it was low with regards to measuring respiratory rate (85 [24%] of 355 facilities) and measuring pulse oximetry (184 [57%] of 325 facilities). INTERPRETATION: While health-care facilities caring for pregnant and recently pregnant women with suspected or confirmed infections have access to a wide range of resources and interventions, worse maternal outcomes are seen among recently pregnant women located in low-income countries than among those in higher-income countries; this trend is similar for pregnant women. Compliance with cost-effective clinical practices and timely care of women with particular individual characteristics can potentially improve infection-related maternal outcomes.

20579,From the President’s Desk,2021-05-12,"In order to circumvent the limited access and donor variability of human primary alveolar cells, directed differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) into alveolar-like cells, provides a promising tool for respiratory disease modeling and drug discovery assays. In this work, a unique, miniaturized 96-Transwell microplate system is described where hiPSC-derived alveolar-like cells were cultured at an air–liquid interface (ALI). To this end, hiPSCs were differentiated into lung epithelial progenitor cells (LPCs) and subsequently matured into a functional alveolar type 2 (AT2)-like epithelium with monolayer-like morphology. AT2-like cells cultured at the physiological ALI conditions displayed characteristics of AT2 cells with classical alveolar surfactant protein expressions and lamellar-body like structures. The integrity of the epithelial barriers between the AT2-like cells was confirmed by applying a custom-made device for 96-parallelized transepithelial electric resistance (TEER) measurements. In order to generate an IPF disease-like phenotype in vitro, the functional AT2-like cells were stimulated with cytokines and growth factors present in the alveolar tissue of IPF patients. The cytokines stimulated the secretion of pro-fibrotic biomarker proteins both on the mRNA (messenger ribonucleic acid) and protein level. Thus, the hiPSC-derived and cellular model system enables the recapitulation of certain IPF hallmarks, while paving the route towards a miniaturized medium throughput approach of pharmaceutical drug discovery.","Bluhmki, Teresa; Traub, Stefanie; Müller, Ann-Kathrin; Bitzer, Sarah; Schruf, Eva; Bammert, Marie-Therese; Leist, Marcel; Gantner, Florian; Garnett, James P; Heilker, Ralf",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8382767/,634
20580,An overview of the viral haemorrhagic fevers for the primary care doctor,2020-06-26,"Anti-melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5-positive dermatomyositis-associated interstitial lung disease (MDA5(+) DM-ILD) is a life-threatening disease. This study aimed to develop a novel pulmonary CT visual scoring method for assessing the prognosis of the disease, and an artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm-based analysis and an idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF)-based scoring were conducted as comparators. A retrospective cohort of hospitalized patients with MDA5(+) DM-ILD was analyzed. Since most fatalities occur within the first half year of the disease course, the primary outcome was the six-month all-cause mortality since the time of admission. A ground glass opacity (GGO) and consolidation-weighted CT visual scoring model for MDA5(+) DM-ILD, namely ‘MDA5 score’, was then developed with C-index values of 0.80 (95%CI 0.75–0.86) in the derivation dataset (n = 116) and 0.84 (95%CI 0.71–0.97) in the validation dataset (n = 57), respectively. While, the AI algorithm-based analysis, namely ‘AI score’, yielded C-index 0.78 (95%CI 0.72–0.84) for the derivation dataset and 0.77 (95%CI 0.64–0.90) for the validation dataset. These findings suggest that the newly derived ‘MDA5 score’ may serve as an applicable prognostic predictor for MDA5(+) DM-ILD and facilitate further clinical trial design. The AI based CT quantitative analysis provided a promising solution for ILD evaluation.","Xu, Wenwen; Wu, Wanlong; Zhang, Danting; Chen, Zhiwei; Tao, Xinwei; Zhao, Jiangfeng; Wang, Kaiwen; Wang, Xiaodong; Zheng, Yu; Ye, Shuang",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8382835/,634
20584,From the president’s desk,2021-03-09,"The purpose of this paper is to establish a green supply chain differential game model for green technology research and development based on a secondary green supply chain composed of a single manufacturer and a single retailer.

The green supply chain members are coordinated through the dynamic wholesale price mechanism, and numerical simulation is used as a methodology, to verify and explain the results. The study found that compared to decentralized decision-making, the level of green technology and the total profit of green channels are higher under centralized decision-making. When the coordination parameters are within a certain range, the dynamic wholesale price mechanism can coordinate the behavior of manufacturers and retailers. The result also discovers that under the dynamic wholesale price mechanism, with the increase of investment cost coefficient, or the increase of price sensitivity or the decrease of consumer's environmental awareness, the green technology level, product green degree, price, retailer's profit, and the total profit of green channel is decreased. In contrast, the wholesale price and manufacturer's profits are increased.","Mohsin, A.K.M.; Far Abid Hossain, Syed; Tushar, Hasanuzzaman; Iqbal, Mohammed Masum; Hossain, Alamgir",Heliyon,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8384889/,634

Method: a descriptive study, of the survey type, with retrospective data collection (2008 to 2017) and a quantitative approach. The dependent variables surgical hospitalizations in Brazil, costs, length of stay and mortality and the independent variables regime/legal nature (public and private) were obtained from the Informatics Department of the Unified Health System. The Mann-Whitney test was used for analysis. RESULTS: the average number of hospitalizations through the Unified Health System was 4,214,083 hospitalizations/year, 53.5% occurred in private hired hospitals and 46.5% in public hospitals (p=0.001). The financial transfer was greater for the private sector (60.6%) against 39.4% for the public (p=0.001). The average stay was 4.5 days in the public hospital and 3.1 days in its private counterpart (p<0.001). Mortality was higher in the public (1.8%) than in the private hospital (1.4%) (p<0.001). CONCLUSION: there was predominance of surgical hospitalizations through the Unified Health System in private hospitals with greater financial transfer to this sector, to the detriment of the public.

For patients with glioblastoma (GBM), management is further complicated by a poor prognosis, feelings of isolation, urgency to treat, and cognitive decline associated with this rare and progressive disease. For these reasons, it is imperative that shared decision-making (SDM) be integrated into standard practice to ensure that the risks and benefits of all treatments are discussed and weighed with the patient’s expectations and goals in mind. In this manuscript, the importance of SDM in GBM and the potential benefits to the practice and patient are discussed from the unique perspective of advocacy leaders. Their insights from interactions with patients and caregivers provide a template for empowering patients, improving patient-physician communication and understanding, and reducing patient and caregiver anxieties.

The aim of our study was to assess the diversity of biofilm formed in different urinary tract diseases and their impact on monocytes’ adherence and activation. The bacteria were obtained from patients with different kidney problems. Some of the patients were after renal transplantation, some of them were not. Changes in the size and granularity of monocytes, as well as their adherence to biofilm, were assessed using FACSVerse flow cytometer after 1 h co-incubation of monocytes and bacterial biofilm in 37 °C. The obtained results were validated against monocytes incubated without bacteria. The isolates from patients with chronic kidney disease formed the most adherent biofilm regardless the presence or absence of inflammatory reaction. Adherence of monocytes also increased during therapy with immunosuppressive agents, but monocytes’ response was different when cyclosporine or tacrolimus were used. Additionally the presence of inflammatory reaction in patients with kidney disease modified the monocytes response when the immunosuppressive drugs were used. Considering the obtained results, we conclude that the changes of monocytes’ morphology in response to biofilm formed by Gram negative rods could become a tool to detect urinary tract infection, especially in those groups of patients, where the knowledge of ongoing inflammation is important and the standard tools fail to detect it.","Daca, Agnieszka; Gołębiewska, Justyna; Bronk, Marek; Jarzembowski, Tomasz",World J Microbiol Biotechnol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8476471/,634

31866,An Interview with Gordon D. Schiff,2020-04-29,"Not so long ago health policy was about little more than the provision of medical care. The availability of treatment is important for those in need of cure, but by now it is a well-shown fact that health is generally determined to a much greater extent by other factors. Genetic constitution, lifestyle choices and socio-economic environment largely explain why some of us become ill or die earlier than others who remain healthy (Mackenbach 1996; McKeown 1976; Wilkinson and Marmot 2003). While some of these factors fall under the control of an individual, the majority does not. Research increasingly indicates how remarkably sensitive our health seems to be to what has become known as the ‘social determinants of health’. These factors generally fall beyond the control of an individual, but can nonetheless be influenced on a population level. This causes a shift in the focus of health policy from the classic provision of health care to policies specifically designed to influence the causal factors of ill-health in different non-medical fields. The flipside of that evolution is a significant increase of the state’s influence in the sphere of individual lives. A pertinent question remains the one that asks for the legitimate role of governments in modifying, discouraging or prohibiting behaviors that lead to ill-health. To what extent can and should we hold public policy responsible for us leading a healthy life? Most scholars will argue that governments indeed have a role to play, but that the limits will be reached when public health measures would imply large sacrifices of individual liberty.","Luyten, Jeroen","Justice, Luck & Responsibility in Health Care",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7178843/,634
41907,Highly efficient and durable antibacterial cotton fabrics finished with zwitterionic polysulfobetaine by one-step eco-friendly strategy,2020-11-10,"CASE REPORT - INTRODUCTION: The most recognised presentation of SARS-CoV-2 infection thus far has been respiratory, with hypoxia secondary to bilateral pneumonia and severe acute respiratory distress syndrome as a result of the host response to the virus. We describe the investigation and management of a case of severe life threatening myocarditis, with no respiratory symptoms, occurring in a young healthcare-worker during the early pandemic. CASE REPORT - CASE DESCRIPTION: A 37-year-old male healthcare-worker presented with dizziness, fever, and diarrhoea. He had no previous medical history. A month prior he had experienced a 5-day fever which self-resolved. On presentation, he was in cardiogenic shock with raised temperature. Blood tests demonstrated lymphocytopenia, raised troponin (peak 490ng/L) and BNP>35,000ng/L. He was transferred directly to critical care. Repeated PCR-swab testing for SARS-CoV-2 were negative. All other viral-testing and autoimmune screen were negative. ECG showed sinus-rhythm and CT-chest demonstrated lower-lobe consolidation with pleural-effusions. Echocardiogram revealed significantly impaired biventricular-function with LVEF of 21%. He had evidence of LV-wall thickening, bi-atrial dilation and raised pulmonary-artery systolic pressures. Despite IV antibiotics for pneumonia and shock-dose hydrocortisone 50mg QDS, he deteriorated requiring two inotropes. He was discussed with the ECMO-team at a tertiary-centre who suggested referral to our centre for consideration of immunosuppression and the patient was transferred. Serology was sent for SARS-CoV-2 to GOSH on a research basis as at the time there was not commercially available or approved assay. Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance (CMR) was delayed due to inability to lie flat. After much discussion (Pre-RECOVERY trial results) 0.75mg/kg prednisolone was started with rapid effect. Inotropes were weaned within 24 hours with subsequent step-down to a cardiac ward. CMR-imaging confirmed myocarditis with characteristic tissue characterisation (raised T1/T2 mapping) and patchy late gadolinium-enhancement. Serial echocardiograms and serum cardiac biomarkers all improved in keeping with the clinical picture. The serological result returned and revealed the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 IgG. ACE-inhibitors, beta-blockade and diuretics were utilised to manage secondary heart failure from myocarditis. He was discharged on weaning oral prednisolone with close follow-up from the rheumatology and cardiology teams. Blood tests 1-month post-discharge demonstrated normalisation of troponin and BNP. Repeat CMR demonstrated normalisation of LV function with no evidence of oedema or myocarditis, with only residual late gadolinium-enhancement. CASE REPORT - DISCUSSION: This previously healthy young man presented during the initial peak of the COVID-19 pandemic and had considerable occupational exposure. At that point, although multiple confirmed cases of this condition had been identified, experience was still limited regarding extra-pulmonary manifestations. Since that time our understanding of the variability of COVID-19 has become apparent. Literature describes a variety of presentations beyond pulmonary including cardiac, ENT, neurological and gastrointestinal, as well as systemic manifestation including hyperinflammatory states and vasculitis. Myocarditis was identified at an early stage from imaging and blood tests, and this was presumed to be likely viral in origin. At that time, there were limited case reports of COVID-19 induced myocarditis, although this remained a differential once routine viral-screening returned negative. Repeated viral swabs for COVID-19 returned negative, however it was noted that he initially did have symptoms a month prior, and it was unclear whether his acute presentation was related to active COVID-19 infection or the sequelae of this. Serum antibody tests were sent to a specialist laboratory, and this ultimately confirmed previous COVID-19 exposure. The decision was made to implement high-dose prednisolone therapy to manage what was felt to be a likely secondary inflammatory phenomenon of COVID-19 at a time when this was not really recognised. There was initial caution regarding this approach due to previous significant negative outcomes of steroid use in the SARS and MERS pandemics. In the subsequent period after this gentleman’s case, the preliminary findings from the RECOVERY trial were made available, from which national guidance advises dexamethasone as the only current licensed therapy in managing COVID-19 in certain circumstances. Use and subsequent recovery following high-dose prednisolone suggests similar principles with this treatment, as well as managing cases who may present with non-pulmonary involvement of COVID-19. CASE REPORT - KEY LEARNING POINTS: Our experience in this case suggests multiple factors from which we can learn from, although since the time of this gentleman’s presentation, a greater understanding of COVID-19 has already highlighted key areas of learning. For this case, the recognition of possible myocarditis without respiratory symptoms as among the possible presentations of COVID-19 is notable. We were able to utilise different methods of imaging to assess the extent of cardiac inflammation and cardiac function. Of highlight would be through use of Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance, which was implemented as part of the initial diagnostic process, as well as ongoing monitoring post-discharge. With this method we can identify subtle changes of the myocardium which can help detect early relapse, and in future may be of significance for diagnosis and monitoring of potential future COVID-19 associated myocarditis. As we hope to one day move towards a post-COVID-19 global climate, perhaps the most important learning point is the possibility of delayed organ/systemic manifestation secondary to COVID-19 infection. For this case, the presumption is that he may have developed the primary infection 1 month prior to presentation. The context of repeated negative PCR-swab results, but the subsequent confirmation of prior exposure on antibody testing would potentially support this. His first presentation appeared to be a mild self-limiting illness, although his later acute presentation was that of significant potential risk, which fortunately he was able to recover from. This however highlights a particular concern regarding the long-term impact of COVID-19 not just on chronic co-morbidity such as long term cardiac failure or respiratory disease, but also the potential re-presentation of those who are deemed to have fully recovered from the virus. As time continues following the first wave of cases, we must remain vigilant of future complications yet to manifest.","El-Ghazali, Shawki; Sivalokanathan, Sanjay; Foley, Michael; Ganesaratnam, Inithan; Pearse, Simon; Varnava, Amanda; Malhotra, Aneil; Cole, Graham; Youngstein, Taryn",Rheumatol Adv Pract,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7607353/,634
48436,A69 THE EFFECT OF COVID-19 PANDEMIC ON CURRENT AND FUTURE ENDOSCOPIC PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT PRACTICES: A NATIONAL SURVEY OF 77 ENDOSCOPISTS,2021-03-04,"Videos with superimposed external subtitles constitute the major part of modern video content. However, there are quite a lot of diverse videos with embedded subtitles as well. In this regard, the problem arises of extracting and converting embedded subtitles into modern formats of external subtitles. Important steps in solving this problem are detection, localization, and binding of these subtitles to frames of the video stream. This paper proposes a method for detection and localization of embedded subtitles in video stream. The method is based on the search for static regions in the frames of the video stream and subsequent analysis of the connected areas inside them. Based on the results of this analysis, we determine whether a region belongs to the area of subtitles and localize text strings in the detected subtitles. The proposed method does not require large computational costs and can work in real time.","Valery, Grishkin; Jean, Sene",Computational Science and Its Applications - ICCSA 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7974961/,634

Currently, three vaccines have been authorized by the United States Food and Drug Administration for emergency use to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. With COVID-19 vaccination rates increasing, it is important to know whether immunodeficient patients have the capacity to mount an immune response with the available vaccines. CASE REPORT: A 78-year-old female with Common Variable Immunodeficiency and anti-IgA antibodies who is naïve to IVIgG treatment responded positively to a COVID-19 mRNA vaccine. Successful seroconversion was proved by having positive COVID-19 spike protein IgG antibodies weeks after the vaccination. Her recent IgG, IgA, and IgM levels were all significantly reduced. Previously, she had no response to the polysaccharide pneumococcal vaccine, but did maintain titers afterTdap vaccination. DISCUSSION: Immunodeficient patients are a susceptible population during a pandemic. Unfortunately, there is a paucity of research on the infectivity, vaccination, and outcome of these patients during the COVID-19 outbreak. Our patient with CVID was able to respond to protein/toxoid vaccines, but did not respond to polysaccharide pneumococcal vaccine. After inoculation with an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine she was able to create COVID-19 spike protein IgG antibodies. CONCLUSION: We present a case of successful vaccination to COVID-19 by an mRNA vaccine in an IVIgG naïve CVID patient.","Jalil, Maaz; Abraham, John M.; Hostoffer, Robert",Allergy Rhinol (Providence),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8514739/,634

Currently, COVID-19 has become a new source of stigmatization. AIMS The aim of the present study is to analyze longitudinally the evolution of intersectional perceived discrimination and internalized stigma among the general population of Spain, at three points in time throughout the confinement. METHOD Participants completed an online survey. RESULTS Results show an increase in both variables from the first to the second evaluation, and a slight decrease from the second to the third evaluation. Moreover, these changes are explained by depression, anxiety and family support. CONCLUSIONS These findings indicate the factors that need to be considered to reduce the perception of discrimination and the internalization of stigma, and their detrimental consequences, during an especially stressful event such as the current pandemic outbreak.","Ugidos, Carolina; López-Gómez, Aída; Castellanos, Miguel Ángel; Saiz, Jesús; González-Sanguino, Clara; Ausín, Berta; Muñoz, Manuel",The International journal of social psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1177/0020764020975802; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33274660/,634

61344,Home sleep testing in the era of COVID-19: a community perspective.,2020-06-05,"Financial conflicts of interest (FCOIs) could bias the potentially practice-changing oncologic randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of tomorrow. This investigation characterized the FCOIs of the principal investigators (PIs) of all currently accruing trials of the four (adult) cooperative groups of the National Clinical Trials Network. For this study, the PI list was first compiled, and each name was then searched in the CMS Open Payments database. For each transaction (general payments (GPs) or research funding (RF)), the amount/number/source of payments was recorded. Results showed that from 2014-2019, the 91 PIs collectively accepted nearly one-third of a billion dollars ($10 477 023 GPs and $320 096 233 RF). The mean and median GP was $6505 and $945 respectively, and $301 693 and $49 824 RF respectively. Multivariable Gamma regression analysis revealed that higher GP sums were associated with RCTs involving any type of systemic therapy, and higher RF sums with medical oncologist PIs, trials with phase III components, and RCTs involving radiotherapy (P < 0.05 for all). Both higher-volume GPs and RF were predicted by PIs having accepted payment(s) from the manufacturer of the drug utilized in their RCT (P < 0.001 GP, P = 0.008 RF). Taken together, the main message of this investigation is that FCOIs may be particularly high in PIs of phase III systemic therapy trials, especially if the PI accepted payments from the manufacturer of the drug utilized in their trial. Such RCTs should be thoroughly scrutinized by medical journals, the FDA, and insurance companies for potential “industry bias” that could influence the integrity of their conclusions.

Generally, their discharges are co-treated with domestic wastewaters, resulting in a decrement of the recalcitrant compound concentrations in the final effluent due to water dilution. However, as many PhCs resist normal treatments, pollutant load does not change. This paper compares the chemical characteristics of hospital and domestic wastewaters on the basis of an experimental investigation for macro-pollutants and literature data for PhCs. A membrane biological reactor pilot plant fed by a hospital effluent is tested in order to evaluate the feasibility of treating these kinds of wastewaters with membrane systems. The paper then presents the possible scenarios in the management of the effluent of a large hospital situated in a small town. In particular, it reports on a case study of designing a (new) treatment plant for the effluent of the 900 bed hospital in Ferrara, Northern Italy, located on the outskirts of the town.

In a few regions in England, a nurse designated to helping families may exist. This study aimed to describe this seldom-observed nursing role and its content. It used an investigative qualitative case study design based on the analysis of two YoD clinical nurse specialists (CNSs) describing the work they did in providing post-diagnostic care to YoD service users. The CNSs address various areas affected by mid-life dementia, including patients' mental health, caregiver stress and families' psycho-social problems. They use various approaches in delivering care, including making home visits, acting as a personal contact for service users and liaising with other health and social care services. Desirable attributes of a CNS service include service users having access to the same CNS throughout their care, receiving timely care and experiencing longer-term support and reassurance. In the post-diagnostic period, service user needs are often more psycho-social than medical, and the CNS role can complement and add value to clinical appointments. The role allows service users to be managed in the community, to receive information, guidance and advice and can prevent and de-escalate problems.","Spreadbury, John H; Kipps, Christopher M",British journal of community nursing,https://doi.org/10.12968/bjcn.2020.25.12.604; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33275505/,634

This study investigated the effects of hyperglycemia, oxidative stress (H(2)O(2)), nitric oxide (NO) and peroxynitrite (ONOO(-)) on the modulation of antiviral (MDA-5, IRF-3 and phospho-IRF-3), inflammatory (NF-kappaB) and pro/anti-apoptotic molecules (Bax and Bcl-2) in BALB/c mice thymocytes. Each of the experimental conditions, except the weakest NO concentration, resulted in down-regulation of MDA-5, IRF-3 and phospho-IRF-3. In contrast, each of the experimental conditions elicited up-regulation of NF-kappaB, Bcl-2 and Bax. These results suggest that hyperglycemia, oxidative and nitrosative stress may contribute to the reduced immunity of the host by altering the MDA-5/IRF-3/phosphoIRF-3 axis, as well as contributing to the mechanisms of inflammatory reaction via increased NF-kappaB, and to augmented turnover rate of thymocyte cells via Bcl2/Bax up-regulation.","Kocic, G; Sokolovic, D; Jevtovic, T; Veljkovic, A; Kocic, R; Nikolic, G; Basic, J; Stojanovic, D; Cencic, A; Stojanovic, S",Redox report : communications in free radical research,https://doi.org/10.1179/174329210x12650506623564; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20663294/,634

Missing teeth can be replaced by various methods including dental implants. The stability, a more natural appearance, and minimizing the risk of bone resorption attribute to its direct anchor into bones. Nevertheless, diabetic patients may experience failure of implant placement due to microvascular complications that lead to sluggish healing after surgery. In addition, some medications are believed to impair bone healing, thus compromising dental implant success. This paper evaluates osseointegration and crestal bone loss of implants placed in medically compromised patients. A retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted using patient records from Department of Prosthodontics, Saveetha Dental College, Chennai, from June 2019 to March 2020. Patients who had dental implants and were medically compromised were chosen randomly. Data were collected and then subjected to statistical analysis. Descriptive statistics analysis was done to find the correlation between crestal bone loss and medically compromised individuals. Microsoft Excel 2016 data spreadsheets were used to collect data, which were later exported to SPSS. Among 89 patients, more than 60% experienced crestal bone loss following implant placement. Diabetic patients recorded the highest prevalence of bone loss in comparison to other medically compromised patients. A significant association was found between crestal bone loss and diabetic patients (p < 0.05) Patients whose diseases were under control with medication were also observed to have bone loss. Overall, the prevalence of crestal bone loss seems to be higher in diabetic patients compared to other medically compromised patients. There seems to be definite correlation between diabetes and crestal bone loss.","Soh, Nurul Husniyah Binti Che; Duraisamy, Revathi; B, Arthi",Journal of long-term effects of medical implants,https://doi.org/10.1615/jlongtermeffmedimplants.2020035938; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33463924/,634

DESIGN A prospective diagnostic accuracy study according to STAndards for the Reporting of Diagnostic accuracy studies (STARD) criteria. SETTING A county hospital with acute inpatient SCI unit. PATIENTS Thirty-nine subjects with SCI and tetraplegia were enrolled. All of the subjects underwent BSE, and 26 subjects completed the VFSS. METHODS Individuals with SCI underwent a BSE followed by a VFSS within 72 hours of the BSE. The subjects were diagnosed as having dysphagia if they had positive findings in either BSE or VFSS. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values were calculated by using VFSS as the criterion standard. RESULTS Fifteen subjects (38%) were diagnosed as having dysphagia based on the BSE results. Among the subjects who completed the VFSS, 11 were diagnosed with dysphagia (42%) and 4 were diagnosed with aspiration (10%). Of the 26 subjects who completed both BSE and VFSS, only 1 subject was diagnosed differently compared with BSE (3.8%). Different diet recommendations were made in 4 cases after VFSS versus BSE. Different liquid recommendations were made in 8 cases after VFSS versus BSE. Sensitivity of BSE was 100% (95% confidence interval [CI], 71.5%-100%), specificity was 93.3% (95% CI, 68.1%-99.8%). A positive predictive value of BSE was 91.7% (95% CI, 61.5%-100%), and the negative predictive value was 100% (95% CI, 76.8%-100%). CONCLUSIONS Dysphagia is present in approximately 38% of individuals with acute tetraplegia. Because only one of the 21 subjects was diagnosed differently based on VFSS, we believe that BSE is an appropriate screening tool for dysphagia for individuals with cervical SCI. However, VFSS provided additional information on diet and liquid recommendations, so there appears to be an important clinical role for the VFSS.","Shem, Kazuko L; Castillo, Kathleen; Wong, Sandra Lynn; Chang, James; Kao, Ming-Chih; Kolakowsky-Hayner, Stephanie A","PM & R : the journal of injury, function, and rehabilitation",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pmrj.2012.01.002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22541374/,634

86688,Pride and Uncertainty: A Qualitative Study of Danish Nursing Staff in Temporary COVID-19 Wards.,2021-01-21,"Vascular disease is a common cause of death within the United States. Herein, we present a method to examine the contribution of flow dynamics towards vascular disease pathologies. Unhealthy arteries often present with wall stiffening, scarring, or partial stenosis which may all affect fluid flow rates, and the magnitude of pulsatile flow, or pulsatility index. Replication of various flow conditions is the result of tuning a flow pressure damping chamber downstream of a blood pump. Introduction of air within a closed flow system allows for a compressible medium to absorb pulsatile pressure from the pump, and therefore vary the pulsatility index. The method described herein is simply reproduced, with highly controllable input, and easily measurable results. Some limitations are recreation of the complex physiological pulse waveform, which is only approximated by the system. Endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, and fibroblasts are affected by the blood flow through the artery. The dynamic component of blood flow is determined by the cardiac output and arterial wall compliance. Vascular cell mechano-transduction of flow dynamics may trigger cytokine release and cross-talk between cell types within the artery. Co-culture of vascular cells is a more accurate picture reflecting cell-cell interaction on the blood vessel wall and vascular response to mechanical signaling. Contribution of flow dynamics, including the cell response to the dynamic and mean (or steady) components of flow, is therefore an important metric in determining disease pathology and treatment efficacy. Through introducing an in vitro co-culture model and pressure damping downstream of blood pump which produces simulated cardiac output, various arterial disease pathologies may be investigated.","Elliott, Winston; Scott-Drechsel, Devon; Tan, Wei",Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,https://doi.org/10.3791/53224; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26554396/,634

Our aim was to compare patency rates of different access and renal replacement treatment (RRT) modalities in patients with bilateral central vein stenosis/occlusion. MATERIAL AND METHODS Data on all patients presenting to a tertiary referral vascular access centre with end-stage vascular access (defined by bilateral central vein stenosis/occlusion with loss of upper limb access) over a 5-year period were included. 3, 6 and 12-month patencies of translumbar catheters (TLs), tunnelled femoral catheters (Fem), native long saphenous vein loops (SV), prosthetic mid-thigh loop grafts (ThGr), peritoneal dialysis (PD), and expedited donation after cardiac death (DCD) cadaveric renal transplants (Tx) via local allocation policies were compared using log-rank test. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was used to estimate long-term access survival. RESULTS One hundred forty-six vascular access modalities were attempted in 62 patients (62 Fem, 25 TL, 15 SV, 25 ThGr, 8 PD, 11 Tx). Median follow-up was 876±57 days. Three, 6 and 12-month primary-assisted patencies for each modality were as follows: Fem: 75.4%, 60% and 28%; TL: 88%, 65% and 50%; SV: 87.5%, 60% and 44.6%; ThGr: 64%, 38% and 23.5%; PD: 62.5%, 62.5% and 50%; Tx: 72.7%, 72.7% and 72.7%. SV had better secondary patency at 900 days (76.9%) than ThGr (49.2%) or Fem (35.8%) (p<0.01). No patients died as a result of loss of access. CONCLUSION Patients with bilateral central vein stenosis often require more than one vascular access modality to achieve a ""personal access solution."" Native long saphenous vein loops provided the best long-term patency. Expedited renal transplantation with priority local allocation of DCD organs to patients with precarious vascular access provides a potential solution to this difficult problem.","Aitken, Emma; Jackson, Andrew J; Kasthuri, Ram; Kingsmore, David B",The journal of vascular access,https://doi.org/10.5301/jva.5000268; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25041913/,634

94709,Editor Introduction.,2021,"BACKGROUND Since 2019, a novel coronavirus named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has emerged worldwide. Apart from fever and respiratory complications, acute kidney injury has been observed in a few patients with coronavirus disease 2019. Furthermore, according to recent findings, the virus has been detected in urine. Angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2) has been proposed to serve as the receptor for the entry of 2019-nCoV, which is the same as that for the severe acute respiratory syndrome. This study aimed to investigate the possible cause of kidney damage and the potential route of 2019-nCoV infection in the urinary system. METHODS We used both published kidney and bladder cell atlas data and new independent kidney single-cell RNA sequencing data generated in-house to evaluate ACE2 gene expression in all cell types in healthy kidneys and bladders. The Pearson correlation coefficients between ACE2 and all other genes were first generated. Then, genes with r values larger than 0.1 and P values smaller than 0.01 were deemed significant co-expression genes with ACE2. RESULTS Our results showed the enriched expression of ACE2 in all subtypes of proximal tubule (PT) cells of the kidney. ACE2 expression was found in 5.12%, 5.80%, and 14.38% of the proximal convoluted tubule cells, PT cells, and proximal straight tubule cells, respectively, in three published kidney cell atlas datasets. In addition, ACE2 expression was also confirmed in 12.05%, 6.80%, and 10.20% of cells of the proximal convoluted tubule, PT, and proximal straight tubule, respectively, in our own two healthy kidney samples. For the analysis of public data from three bladder samples, ACE2 expression was low but detectable in bladder epithelial cells. Only 0.25% and 1.28% of intermediate cells and umbrella cells, respectively, had ACE2 expression. CONCLUSION This study has provided bioinformatics evidence of the potential route of 2019-nCoV infection in the urinary system.","Lin, Wei; Fan, Jue; Hu, Long-Fei; Zhang, Yan; Ooi, Joshua D; Meng, Ting; Jin, Peng; Ding, Xiang; Peng, Long-Kai; Song, Lei; Tang, Rong; Xiao, Zhou; Ao, Xiang; Xiao, Xiang-Cheng; Zhou, Qiao-Ling; Xiao, Ping; Zhong, Yong",Chinese medical journal,https://doi.org/10.1097/cm9.0000000000001439; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33883412/,634

METHODS Patients with clinical N0 non-small cell lung cancer and total tumour size >30 mm on preoperative computed tomography who underwent complete resection with lobectomy between January 2007 and December 2017 were included. The patients were divided into three groups: pure solid tumour, low ground glass opacity ratio (1-39%) tumour and high ground glass opacity ratio (≥40%) tumour. The cut-off line was determined based on the recurrence rate for every 10% ground glass opacity ratio. RESULTS Among the 227 study patients, 129 (56.8%) had a pure solid tumour, 54 (23.8%) had a low ground glass opacity ratio tumour and 44 (19.4%) had a high ground glass opacity ratio tumour. Three-year recurrence-free survival was significantly shorter in patients with a pure solid tumour (57.4%) than in patients with a low ground glass opacity ratio (74.5%; P = 0.009) or a high ground glass opacity ratio tumour (92.1%; P < 0.001). Multivariable analysis showed that ground glass opacity ratio was a significant independent prognostic factor for recurrence-free survival (hazard ratio, 0.175; P = 0.037). CONCLUSION Pure solid tumours comprised a large proportion of non-small cell lung cancer tumours >30 mm in size and their prognosis was poor. The presence of ground glass opacity and their relative proportion affect prognosis in patients with clinical N0 non-small cell lung cancer tumours >30 mm in size, similar to those with small-sized tumours.","Kagimoto, Atsushi; Tsutani, Yasuhiro; Handa, Yoshinori; Mimae, Takahiro; Miyata, Yoshihiro; Okada, Morihito",Japanese journal of clinical oncology,https://doi.org/10.1093/jjco/hyaa167; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32901276/,634

However, the exact features of antibody responses that govern COVID-19 disease outcomes remain unclear. In this study, we analyzed humoral immune responses in 229 patients with asymptomatic, mild, moderate and severe COVID-19 over time to probe the nature of antibody responses in disease severity and mortality. We observed a correlation between anti-spike (S) immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels, length of hospitalization and clinical parameters associated with worse clinical progression. Although high anti-S IgG levels correlated with worse disease severity, such correlation was time dependent. Deceased patients did not have higher overall humoral response than discharged patients. However, they mounted a robust, yet delayed, response, measured by anti-S, anti-receptor-binding domain IgG and neutralizing antibody (NAb) levels compared to survivors. Delayed seroconversion kinetics correlated with impaired viral control in deceased patients. Finally, although sera from 85% of patients displayed some neutralization capacity during their disease course, NAb generation before 14 d of disease onset emerged as a key factor for recovery. These data indicate that COVID-19 mortality does not correlate with the cross-sectional antiviral antibody levels per se but, rather, with the delayed kinetics of NAb production.","Lucas, Carolina; Klein, Jon; Sundaram, Maria E; Liu, Feimei; Wong, Patrick; Silva, Julio; Mao, Tianyang; Oh, Ji Eun; Mohanty, Subhasis; Huang, Jiefang; Tokuyama, Maria; Lu, Peiwen; Venkataraman, Arvind; Park, Annsea; Israelow, Benjamin; Vogels, Chantal B F; Muenker, M Catherine; Chang, C-Hong; Casanovas-Massana, Arnau; Moore, Adam J; Zell, Joseph; Fournier, John B; Wyllie, Anne L; Campbell, Melissa; Lee, Alfred; Chun, Hyung J; Grubaugh, Nathan D; Schulz, Wade L; Farhadian, Shelli; Dela Cruz, Charles; Ring, Aaron M; Shaw, Albert C; Wisnewski, Adam V; Yildirim, Inci; Ko, Albert I; Omer, Saad; Iwasaki, Akiko",Nature medicine,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-021-01355-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33953384/,634

104350,The Aging Tsunami and Senior Healthcare Development in China.,2018,"BACKGROUND Delirium is frequent in patients in the ICU, but its association with the outcome of weaning from mechanical ventilation has not been assessed. Circadian rhythm alteration may favor delirium. In the current study, we assessed the impact of delirium during weaning and associated alterations in the circadian rhythm of melatonin excretion. METHODS This was a substudy of 70 participants of the B-type Natriuretic Peptide for the Fluid Management of Weaning trial, comparing two fluid management strategies during weaning. Patients with or without delirium (as assessed using the Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU) were compared in terms of baseline characteristics and outcomes and the circadian rhythm of melatonin excretion using the 24-h excretion of its urinary metabolite 6-sulfatoxymelatonin (aMT6s). RESULTS Among the 70 patients included, 43 (61.4%) experienced delirium at the initiation of weaning. Delirium at the initiation of weaning was associated with more alcohol consumption, a greater severity of illness, and medication use before weaning (including neuromuscular blockade, antibiotics, sedatives, and narcotics). Delirium at the initiation of weaning was associated with more respiratory and neurologic complications and a reduced probability of successful extubation (Cox multivariate model hazard ratio of successful extubation = 0.54; 95% CI, 0.30-0.95; P = .03). Delirium was also associated with a significant reduction in peak, mean, amplitude, and total values of aMT6s urinary excretion during the first 24 h of weaning (general linear model F statistic = 5.81, P = .019). CONCLUSIONS Delirium is frequent at the initiation of ventilator weaning. It is associated with a prolongation of weaning and an alteration in the circadian rhythm of melatonin excretion.

METHODS A national analysis of unintentional fatal drowning rates per 100,000 population over 16 years (2004/05-2019/20) was conducted. Baseline rates (three-year average 2004/05-2006/07) were compared to the current three-year average (2017/18-2019/20) by sex, age group, drowning location and jurisdiction. RESULTS The overall rate of unintentional fatal drowning during the period decreased by 28%. Substantial reductions were observed in children 0-4 years (-63%) and 5-14 years (-56%). Progress has been less pronounced among people aged 75 years and over (-11%) and 15-24-year-olds (-14%). All locations and jurisdictions recorded reductions, aside from rocks (+46%). CONCLUSIONS Although the strategy fell short of its aspirational target of a 50% reduction in drowning by the year 2020, this target was exceeded in key age groups, including children. Implications for public health: The AWSS is a powerful tool to align drowning prevention sector actions to agreed objectives. Forthcoming strategies must take into consideration demographic and social change, areas where limited progress has been made and the latest evidence to guide future priorities.","Peden, Amy E; Scarr, Justin-Paul; Mahony, Alison J",Australian and New Zealand journal of public health,https://doi.org/10.1111/1753-6405.13124; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34028908/,634
111060,Unmasking the mask: the role of personal protective equipment for ophthalmologists caring for asymptomatic patients during the COVID-19 pandemic.,2020,"Identifying antibodies (Abs) that neutralize infectious agents is the first step for developing therapeutics, vaccines, and diagnostic tools for these infectious agents. However, current approaches for identifying neutralizing Abs (nAbs) typically rely on dilution-based assays that are costly, inefficient, and only survey a small subset of the entire repertoire. There are also intrinsic biases in many steps of conventional nAb identification processes. More importantly, conventional assays rely on simple Ab-antigen binding assays, which may not result in identifying the most potent nAbs, as the strongest binder may not be the most potent nAb. Droplet microfluidic systems have the capability to overcome such limitations by conducting complex multi-step assays with high reliability, resolution, and throughput in a pico-liter volume water-in-oil emulsion droplet format. Here, we describe the development of PRESCIENT (Platform for the Rapid Evaluation of antibody SucCess using Integrated microfluidics ENabled Technology), a droplet microfluidic system that can enable high-throughput single-cell resolution identification of nAb repertoires elicited in response to viral infection. We demonstrate PRESCIENT's ability to identify Abs that neutralize a model viral agent, Murine coronavirus (murine hepatitis virus), which causes high mortality rates in experimentally infected mice. In-droplet infection of host cells by the virus was first demonstrated, followed by demonstration of in-droplet neutralization by nAbs produced from a single Ab-producing hybridoma cell. Finally, fluorescence intensity analyses of two populations of hybridoma cell lines (nAb-producing and non-nAb-producing hybridoma cell lines) successfully discriminated between the two populations. The presented strategy and platform have the potential to identify and investigate neutralizing activities against a broad range of potential infectious agents for which nAbs have yet to be discovered, significantly advancing the nAb identification process as well as reinvigorating the field of Ab discovery, characterization, and development.","Wippold, Jose A; Wang, Han; Tingling, Joseph; Leibowitz, Julian L; de Figueiredo, Paul; Han, Arum",Lab on a chip,https://doi.org/10.1039/c9lc01165j; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32196032/,634

We report data from a cohort of ART-naïve South African children who initiated first-line ART. METHODS ART-eligible CLHIV aged 0-12 years were enrolled from 2012 to 2014 at five public South African facilities and followed for up to 24 months. Enrolled CLHIV received standard of care WHO-recommended first-line ART. At the final study visit, a dried blood spot sample was obtained for viral load and genotypic resistance testing. RESULTS Among 72 successfully genotyped CLHIV, 49 (68.1%) received ABC/3TC/LPV/r, and 23 (31.9%) received ABC/3TC/EFV. All but 2 children on ABC/3TC/LPV/r were <3 years and all CLHIV on ABC/3TC/EFV were ≥3 years. Overall, 80.6% (58/72) had at least one drug resistance mutation (DRM). DRMs to NNRTIs and NRTIs were found among 65% and 51% of all CLHIV, respectively, with no statistical difference by ART regimen. More CLHIV on ABC/3TC/EFV, 47.8% (11/23), were found to have 0 or only 1 effective antiretroviral drug remaining in their current regimen compared to 8.2% (4/49) on ABC/3TC/LPV/r. CONCLUSIONS High levels of NNRTI and NRTI DRMs among CLHIV receiving ABC/3TC/LPV/r suggests a lasting impact of failed PMTCT interventions on DRMs. However, drug susceptibility analysis, reveals that CLHIV with detectable viremia on ABC/3TC/LPV/r are more likely to have maintained at least two effective agents on their current HIV regimen than those on ABC/3TC/EFV.","Hackett, Stephanie; Teasdale, Chloe A; Pals, Sherri; Muttiti, Anthony; Mogashoa, Mary; Chang, Joy; Zeh, Clement; Ramos, Artur; Rivadeneira, Emilia D; DeVos, Joshua; Sleeman, Katrina; Abrams, Elaine J",Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America,https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciaa1068; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32735012/,634

The study aims to estimate the proportion of IPV among adult Arab women before and during the COVID-19 lockdown and to identify its possible predictors during the lockdown. METHODS A cross-sectional study was conducted between April and June 2020 using an online questionnaire. The sample included 490 adult Arab women aged 18 years and above, who live with their husbands. Data was collected using a Google forms designed questionnaire that included the socio-demographic characteristics, nature of lockdown, and exposure to different types of IPV before and during COVID-19 lockdown and the frequency of their occurrence. McNemar's test was used to determine differences in the exposure to IPV before and during the lockdown, while logistic regression analysis was performed to identify the predictors of exposure to IPV during the lockdown. RESULTS Half of women reported that they were ever exposed to IPV with psychological violence ranking 1st. Exposure to any type of IPV and exposure to psychological, physical, and sexual violence have significantly increased during the lockdown compared to before the lockdown. The frequency of exposure to the different types of IPV ranged from 1-3 times per month to almost every day, but the most commonly reported was 1-3 times per month. Predictors of exposure to IPV during the COVID-19 lockdown included country of residence, family income, and whether the husband lost his job during lockdown. CONCLUSIONS IPV has increased during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown in the Arab countries, and it was associated with the socioeconomic consequences of the pandemic on families. Actions towards raising awareness about the problem among professionals and the community, early detection, and provision of appropriate services are mandatory.","El-Nimr, Nessrin A; Mamdouh, Heba M; Ramadan, Amal; El Saeh, Haider M; Shata, Zeinab N",The Journal of the Egyptian Public Health Association,https://doi.org/10.1186/s42506-021-00077-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34132902/,634

Following in-vitro challenge with Mtb, AM from each group displayed overlapping but distinct profiles of significantly up- and down-regulated genes in response to Mtb. Comparatively, AM isolated from both PLWH and PrEP subjects presented a substantially weaker transcriptional response. In addition, AM from HC subjects challenged with Mtb responded with pronounced chromatin accessibility changes while AM obtained from PLWH and PrEP subjects displayed no significant changes in their chromatin state.

The pulmonary manifestations of COVID-19 have been well described in the literature. Two similar human coronaviruses that cause Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-1) are known to cause disease in the central and peripheral nervous systems. Emerging evidence suggests COVID-19 has neurologic consequences as well. Observations This review serves to summarize available information regarding coronaviruses in the nervous system, identify the potential tissue targets and routes of entry of SARS-CoV-2 into the central nervous system, and describe the range of clinical neurological complications that have been reported thus far in COVID-19 and their potential pathogenesis. Viral neuroinvasion may be achieved by several routes, including transsynaptic transfer across infected neurons, entry via the olfactory nerve, infection of vascular endothelium, or leukocyte migration across the blood-brain barrier. The most common neurologic complaints in COVID-19 are anosmia, ageusia, and headache, but other diseases, such as stroke, impairment of consciousness, seizure, and encephalopathy, have also been reported. Conclusions and Relevance Recognition and understanding of the range of neurological disorders associated with COVID-19 may lead to improved clinical outcomes and better treatment algorithms. Further neuropathological studies will be crucial to understanding the pathogenesis of the disease in the central nervous system, and longitudinal neurologic and cognitive assessment of individuals after recovery from COVID-19 will be crucial to understand the natural history of COVID-19 in the central nervous system and monitor for any long-term neurologic sequelae.","Zubair, Adeel S; McAlpine, Lindsay S; Gardin, Tova; Farhadian, Shelli; Kuruvilla, Deena E; Spudich, Serena",JAMA neurology,https://doi.org/10.1001/jamaneurol.2020.2065; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32469387/,634

We hypothesized that the nature of penetrating injury differs significantly by gender and that these injuries in women are associated with important psychosocial and environmental factors. MATERIALS AND METHODS A level 1 urban trauma center registry was queried for all patients with penetrating injuries from 2002-2010. Patient and injury variables (demographics and mechanism of injury) were abstracted and compared between genders; additional social and psychiatric histories and perpetrator information were collected from the records of admitted female patients. RESULTS Injured women were more likely to be Caucasian, suffer stab wounds instead of gunshot wounds, and present with a higher blood alcohol level than men. Compared with women with gunshot wounds, those with stab wounds were three times more likely to report a psychiatric or intimate partner violence history. Women with self-inflicted injuries had a significantly greater incidence of prior penetrating injury and psychiatric and criminal history. Male perpetrators outnumbered female perpetrators; patients frequently not only knew their perpetrator but also were their intimate partners. Intimate partner violence and random cross-fire incidents each accounted for about a quarter of injuries observed. CONCLUSIONS Penetrating injuries in women represent a nonnegligible subset of injuries seen in urban trauma centers. Psychiatric and social risk factors for violence play important roles in these cases, particularly when self-infliction is suspected. Resources allocated for urban violence prevention should proportionately reflect the particular patterns of violence observed in injured women.","Jacovides, Christina L; Bruns, Brandon; Holena, Daniel N; Sims, Carrie A; Wiebe, Douglas J; Reilly, Patrick M; Pascual, Jose L",The Journal of surgical research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jss.2013.06.026; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23890398/,634
127668,Feeding the Beast.,2020-08-11,"INTRODUCTION Timely availability of effective influenza vaccine will be critical to mitigate the next influenza pandemic. The mission of Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) is to develop medical countermeasures against pandemics, including influenza and other health security threats. AREAS COVERED Despite considerable gains in pandemic vaccine preparedness since 2009, old and new challenges threaten the pandemic influenza response capabilities of the U.S. Government: insufficient U.S.-based vaccine production, two-dose vaccination regimen, logistically complex adjuvanted formulation, and sustained surge manufacturing capacity despite no commercial market for pandemic vaccines. Although the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has re-exposed these gaps in preparedness and response, previous investments into flexible influenza vaccine technologies proved to be critical to accelerate COVID-19 vaccine development. EXPERT OPINION BARDA addresses these challenges by implementing a pandemic influenza vaccine strategy with two key goals: 1) accelerating vaccine development and production (faster) and 2) improving vaccine performance (better). This strategy involves an end-to-end approach, including increasing manufacturing and fill-finish capacity; improving release testing speed; and funding clinical trials to improve current vaccine utilization. As demonstrated by the COVID-19 response, continued investments into this pandemic influenza vaccine strategy will further enhance the ability to respond to future emerging pandemic pathogens.","Newland, Matthew; Durham, David; Asher, Jason; Treanor, John J; Seals, Jonathan; Donis, Ruben O; Johnson, Robert",Expert review of vaccines,https://doi.org/10.1080/14760584.2021.1886931; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33576708/,634

133611,Bridging therapy for achalasia in a second trimester pregnant patient.,2019,"Human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a major cause of lower respiratory tract disease, especially in young children and the elderly. The fusion protein (F) exists in a pre- and postfusion conformation and is the main target of RSV-neutralizing antibodies. Highly potent RSV-neutralizing antibodies typically bind sites that are unique to the prefusion conformation of F. In this study we screened a single-domain antibody (VHH) library derived from a llama immunized with prefusion-stabilized F and identified a prefusion F-specific VHH that can neutralize RSV A at subnanomolar concentrations. Structural analysis revealed that this VHH primarily binds to antigenic site I while also making contacts with residues in antigenic site III and IV. This new VHH reveals a previously underappreciated membrane-proximal region sensitive for neutralization.ImportanceRSV is an important respiratory pathogen. This study describes a prefusion F-specific VHH that primarily binds to antigenic site I of RSV F. This is the first time that a prefusion F-specific antibody that binds this site is reported. In general, antibodies that bind to site I are poorly neutralizing, whereas the VHH described here neutralizes RSV A at subnanomolar concentrations. Our findings contribute to insights into the RSV F antigenic map.","Rossey, Iebe; Hsieh, Ching-Lin; Sedeyn, Koen; Ballegeer, Marlies; Schepens, Bert; Mclellan, Jason S; Saelens, Xavier",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.02279-20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33692208/,634

The purpose of this study was to investigate the clinical features of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). MATERIALS AND METHODS A retrospective analysis was performed on the confirmed cases of COVID-19, who were admitted to the North Hospital of Changsha first Hospital (Changsha Public Health treatment Center) from January 17 to February 7, 2020. RESULTS The median age of COVID-19 patients was 45 years (range 33.5-57). The male patients accounted for 49.7%, 64.6% of the patients had a history of exposure in Wuhan, and 31.7% had family aggregation. The median days of onset were six, and the incidence of severe illness was 18.6%. Compared with the non-severe group, the severe group showed statistical significance in older age, hypertension, bilateral lung plaque shadow, decrease in lymphocyte count, increase in C-reactive protein (CRP), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), lactate dehydrogenase, and creatine kinase. CONCLUSIONS Age, combined hypertension, oxygenation index, double lung patch, decreased lymphocyte count, and elevated levels of C-reactive protein, aspartate aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase, and creatine kinase can be used as predictors of the disease severity.","Zheng, F; Tang, W; Li, H; Huang, Y-X; Xie, Y-L; Zhou, Z-G",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,https://doi.org/10.26355/eurrev_202003_20711; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32271459/,634

Uncarboxylated osteocalcin (ucOC) may participate in the regulation of glucose metabolism, thus measurement of ucOC could be useful in evaluating interactions between bone and glucose metabolism. We developed recombinant antibodies and immunoassay to specifically detect ucOC in human blood samples. ucOC-specific recombinant antibodies were selected from an antibody library by phage display. Four candidates were characterized, and one (Fab-AP13) was used to set up an immunoassay with a pre-existing MAb. Plasma ucOC levels were measured in subjects with normal fasting blood glucose (≤ 6 mmol/l, N = 46) or with hyperglycemia (≥ 7 mmol/l, N = 29). Further, we analyzed ucOC in age- and gender-matched patients with diagnosed type 2 diabetes (T2D, N = 49). Antibodies recognized ucOC without cross-reaction to carboxylated osteocalcin. Antibodies had unique binding sites at the carboxylation region, with Glu17 included in all epitopes. Immunoassay was set up and characterized. Immunoassay detected ucOC in serum and plasma, with on average 1.6-fold higher levels in plasma. ucOC concentrations were significantly lower in subjects with hyperglycemia (median 0.58 ng/ml, p = 0.008) or with T2D diagnosis (0.68 ng/ml, p = 0.015) than in subjects with normal blood glucose (1.01 ng/ml). ucOC negatively correlated with fasting plasma glucose in subjects without T2D (r = - 0.24, p = 0.035) but not in T2D patients (p = 0.41). Our immunoassay, based on the novel recombinant antibody, allows for specific and sensitive detection of ucOC in human circulation. Correlation between ucOC and plasma glucose suggests interactions between osteocalcin and glucose metabolism in humans.","Arponen, Milja; Brockmann, Eeva-Christine; Kiviranta, Riku; Lamminmäki, Urpo; Ivaska, Kaisa K",Calcified tissue international,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00223-020-00746-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32839842/,634
136429,Sleepless in a pandemic: a medical student's perspective.,2021-01-12,"Introduction: Contact tracing has the potential to control outbreaks without the need for stringent physical distancing policies, e.g. civil lockdowns. Unlike forward contact tracing, backward contact tracing identifies the source of newly detected cases. This approach is particularly valuable when there is high individual-level variation in the number of secondary transmissions (overdispersion). Methods: By using a simple branching process model, we explored the potential of combining backward contact tracing with more conventional forward contact tracing for control of COVID-19. We estimated the typical size of clusters that can be reached by backward tracing and simulated the incremental effectiveness of combining backward tracing with conventional forward tracing. Results: Across ranges of parameter values consistent with dynamics of SARS-CoV-2, backward tracing is expected to identify a primary case generating 3-10 times more infections than a randomly chosen case, typically increasing the proportion of subsequent cases averted by a factor of 2-3. The estimated number of cases averted by backward tracing became greater with a higher degree of overdispersion. Conclusion: Backward contact tracing can be an effective tool for outbreak control, especially in the presence of overdispersion as is observed with SARS-CoV-2.","Endo, Akira; Leclerc, Quentin J; Knight, Gwenan M; Medley, Graham F; Atkins, Katherine E; Funk, Sebastian; Kucharski, Adam J",Wellcome open research,https://doi.org/10.12688/wellcomeopenres.16344.2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33154980/,634
137892,Protection at the Frontlines: Rapid Organization and Delivery of COVID-19 Personal Protective Equipment Training.,2020,"Endocannaboid signaling plays a regulatory role in various (neuro)biological functions. 2-Arachidonoyglycerol (2-AG) is the most abundant endocannabinoid, and while its canonical biosynthetic pathway involving phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C and diacylglycerol lipase α is known, alternative pathways remain unsettled. Here, we characterize a non-canonical pathway implicating glycerophosphodiesterase 3 (GDE3, from GDPD2 gene). Human GDE3 expressed in HEK293T cell membranes catalyzed the conversion of lysophosphatidylinositol (LPI) into monoacylglycerol and inositol-1-phosphate. The enzyme was equally active against 1-acyl- and 2-acyl-LPI. When using 2-acyl LPI, where arachidonic acid is the predominant fatty acid, LC-MS analysis identified 2-AG as the main product of LPI hydrolysis by GDE3. Furthermore, inositol-1-phosphate release into the medium occurred upon addition of LPI to intact cells, suggesting that GDE3 is actually an ecto-lysophospholipase C. In cells expressing G-protein-coupled receptor GPR55, GDE3 abolished 1-acyl-LPI-induced signaling. In contrast, upon simultaneous expression of GDE3 and cannabinoid receptor CB2, 2-acyl-LPI evoked the same signal as that induced by 2-AG. These data strongly suggest that, beside simply degrading the GPR55 LPI ligand, GDE3 can act as a switch between GPR55 and CB2 signaling. Coincident with a major expression of both GDE3 and CB2 in spleen, spleens from transgenic mice lacking GDE3 displayed doubling of LPI content, compared to wild type mice. Decreased production of 2-AG in whole spleen was also observed, supporting the in vivo relevance of our findings. These data thus open a new research avenue in the field of endocannabinoid generation and reinforce the view of GPR55/LPI being genuine actors of endocannabinoid system.","Briand-Mésange, Fabienne; Pons, Véronique; Allart, Sophie; Masquelier, Julien; Chicanne, Gaetan; Beton, Nicolas; Payrastre, Bernard; Muccioli, Giulio G; Ausseil, Jérôme; Davignon, Jean-Luc; Salles, Jean-Pierre; Chap, Hugues",The Journal of biological chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.ra120.015278; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32917725/,634

Real-time imaging and display at video-rate speed are critical for clinical utility of the IVPA-US imaging technology. Here, we demonstrate a portable IVPA-US system capable of imaging at up to 25 frames per second in real-time display mode. This unprecedented imaging speed was achieved by concurrent innovations in excitation laser source, rotary joint assembly, 1 mm IVPA-US catheter size, differentiated A-line strategy, and real-time image processing and display algorithms. Spatial resolution, chemical specificity, and capability for imaging highly dynamic objects were evaluated by phantoms to characterize system performance. An imaging speed of 16 frames per second was determined to be adequate to suppress motion artifacts from cardiac pulsation for in vivo applications. The translational capability of this system for the detection of lipid-laden plaques was validated by ex vivo imaging of an atherosclerotic human coronary artery at 16 frames per second, which showed strong correlation to gold-standard histopathology. Thus, this high-speed IVPA-US imaging system presents significant advances in the translational intravascular and other endoscopic applications.","Hui, Jie; Cao, Yingchun; Zhang, Yi; Kole, Ayeeshik; Wang, Pu; Yu, Guangli; Eakins, Gregory; Sturek, Michael; Chen, Weibiao; Cheng, Ji-Xin",Scientific reports,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-017-01649-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28469205/,634

Previously, it has been shown that L(pro) is involved in the inhibition of the type I interferon (IFN) response by FMDV. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here we demonstrate that FMDV Lb(pro), a shorter form of L(pro), has deubiquitinating activity. Sequence alignment and structural bioinformatics analyses revealed that the catalytic residues (Cys51 and His148) are highly conserved in FMDV Lb(pro) of all seven serotypes and that the topology of FMDV Lb(pro) is remarkably similar to that of ubiquitin-specific protease 14 (USP14), a cellular deubiquitylation enzyme (DUB), and to that of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) papain-like protease (PLpro), a coronaviral DUB. Both purified Lb(pro) protein and in vivo ectopically expressed Lb(pro) removed ubiquitin (Ub) moieties from cellular substrates, acting on both lysine-48- and lysine-63-linked polyubiquitin chains. Furthermore, Lb(pro) significantly inhibited ubiquitination of retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I), TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1), TNF receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6), and TRAF3, key signaling molecules in activation of type I IFN response. Mutations in Lb(pro) that ablate the catalytic activity (C51A or D163N/D164N) or disrupt the SAP (for SAF-A/B, Acinus, and PIAS) domain (I83A/L86A) abrogated the DUB activity of Lb(pro) as well as its ability to block signaling to the IFN-β promoter. Collectively, these results demonstrate that FMDV Lb(pro) possesses DUB activity in addition to serving as a viral proteinase and describe a novel mechanism evolved by FMDV to counteract host innate antiviral responses.","Wang, Dang; Fang, Liurong; Li, Ping; Sun, Li; Fan, Jinxiu; Zhang, Qingye; Luo, Rui; Liu, Xiangtao; Li, Kui; Chen, Huanchun; Chen, Zhongbin; Xiao, Shaobo",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.02589-10; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21307201/,634

The lens-expressed long noncoding RNA OIP5-AS1 was upregulated in lens epithelial cells from patients with cataracts, suggesting its pathogenic role in cataracts. We investigated the regulatory role of OIP5-AS1 in the development of cataracts as well as potential RNA binding proteins, downstream target genes, and upstream transcription factors. Methods Clinical capsules and ex vivo and in vitro cataract models were used to test OIP5-AS1 expression. Cell apoptosis was detected using Western blots, JC-1 staining, and flow cytometry. Ribonucleoprotein immunoprecipitation-qPCR was performed to confirm the interaction of OIP5-AS1 and POLG. Chromatin immunoprecipitation-qPCR was used to determine the binding of TFAP2A and the OIP5-AS1 promoter region. Results OIP5-AS1 was upregulated in cataract lenses and B3 cells under oxidative stress. OIP5-AS1 knockdown protected B3 cells from H2O2-induced apoptosis and alleviated lens opacity in the ex vivo cataract model. HuR functioned as a scaffold carrying OIP5-AS1 and POLG mRNA and mediated the decay of POLG mRNA. POLG was downregulated in the cataract lens and oxidative-stressed B3 cells, and POLG depletion decreased the mtDNA copy number and MMP, increased reactive oxygen species production, and sensitized B3 cells to oxidative stress-induced apoptosis. POLG overexpression reversed these effects. TFAP2A bound the OIP5-AS1 promoter and contributed to OIP5-AS1 expression. Conclusions We demonstrated that OIP5-AS1, activated by TFAP2A, contributed to cataract formation by inhibiting POLG expression mediated by HuR, thus leading to increased apoptosis of lens epithelial cells and aggravated lens opacity, suggesting that OIP5-AS1 is a potential target for cataract treatment.","Jing, Ruihua; Ma, Bo; Qi, Tiantian; Hu, Conghui; Liao, Chongbing; Wen, Chan; Shao, Yongping; Pei, Cheng",Investigative ophthalmology & visual science,https://doi.org/10.1167/iovs.61.12.3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33006594/,634

STUDY DESIGN Cross-sectional survey. SETTING Twelve US academic otolaryngology programs. METHODS A questionnaire was administered that encompassed sociodemographic and professional features, the Expanded Physician Well-being Index for distress, the 2-item Maslach Burnout Inventory for professional burnout, the Patient Health Questionnaire-2 screen for major depressive disorder, and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-2 screen for generalized anxiety disorder. RESULTS The survey response rate was 56% and included 186 attending physicians. The average respondent age was 47 years; 72% were men; 93% were married or partnered; and 86% had children. Distress was present in 40%, professional burnout in 26%, positive depression screening in 8%, and positive anxiety screening in 11%. In a univariable setting, age, hours worked in a typical week, nights on call in a typical week, and years of practice were significantly associated with distress, although in a multivariable setting, only hours worked in a typical week remained significantly associated with a positive Expanded Physician Well-being Index screen (odds ratio for each 10-hour increase, 2.61; 95% CI, 1.73-3.93; P < .001). In a univariable setting, hours worked in a typical week was significantly associated with a positive Maslach Burnout Inventory screen.

More data is required on their comparability, particularly amongst those with milder infections and in the general practice population. The aim of this study was to compare four high throughput automated anti SARS-CoV-2 assays using samples collected from hospitalised patients and healthcare workers with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. In addition, we collected general practice samples to compare antibody results and determine seroprevalence. METHODS Samples were collected from 57 hospitalised patients and 9 healthcare workers at 14 days and at 28 days following confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Samples were also collected from 225 patients presenting to general practice. Four assays were used: Abbott Architect IgG, Beckman Coulter DxI 800 IgG, Roche Cobas e801 total antibody and Siemens Advia Centaur XPT total antibody. RESULTS All 4 assays showed concordance at 14 days in 83.9% of hospitalised patients and in 66.7% of healthcare workers. All 4 assays showed concordance at 28 days in 88.4% of hospitalised patients and 77.8% of healthcare workers. The sensitivity to detect recent infection was higher for the IgG assays than the total assays. All 4 assays showed concordance of 95.1% in the general practice population. Seroprevalence ranged from 4.9-5.8% depending on the assay used.

However, little was known about whether fipronil and fipronil sulfone transferred into fetus through the blood placenta barrier. Our objectives were to investigate the transplacental transfer and the pharmacokinetics of fipronil and fipronil sulfone in rats. Male and 13-day gestation female Sprague-Dawley rats were used in pharmacokinetics and transplacental transfer experiments, respectively. Biological samples were collected at each time point after fipronil intravenous or oral administration. To monitor fipronil and fipronil sulfone in the plasma, placenta, amniotic fluid, and fetus, a validated liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method was developed. After fipronil administration in male rats, the oral bioavailability decreased while the biotransformation increased as the dose increased, revealed an enhancement of first-pass effect and a fast metabolism in vivo. The results of fipronil transplacental transfer in pregnant rats demonstrated that the concentration of fipronil and fipronil sulfone varied in the following order respectively: placenta > plasma > fetus > amniotic fluid and plasma > placenta > fetus > amniotic fluid. This is the first direct evidence that fipronil and fipronil sulfone cross the blood placental barriers and enter the fetus. The amount of fipronil distributed to the fetus was greater than that of fipronil sulfone in the short term, but by contrast, pharmacokinetic data showed that the latter stayed longer in the body. These findings provide constructive information for public health alarm. Significance Statement Fipronil and fipronil sulfone interfere with the GABAergic system. Fipronil can cause thyroid dysfunction, which may affect brain growth and nerve development. Although we knew that fipronil and fipronil sulfone could enter eggs, there was no direct evidence that they would enter fetuses.

We thus compared a prototype zero-heat-flux thermometer with simultaneous measurements from a pulmonary artery catheter. Specifically, we tested the hypothesis that zero-heat-flux temperatures are sufficiently accurate for routine clinical use. METHODS Core temperature was measured from the thermistor of a standard pulmonary artery catheter and with a prototype zero-heat-flux deep-tissue thermometer in 105 patients having nonemergent cardiac surgery. Zero-heat-flux probes were positioned on the lateral forehead and lateral neck. Skin surface temperature probes were attached to the forehead just adjacent to the zero-heat-flux probe. Temperatures were recorded at 1-minute intervals, excluding the period of cardiopulmonary bypass, and for the first 4 postoperative hours. Zero-heat-flux and pulmonary artery temperatures were compared with bias analysis; differences exceeding 0.5°C were considered to be potentially clinically important. RESULTS The mean duration in the operating room was 279 ± 75 minutes, and the mean cross-clamp time was 118 ± 50 minutes. All subjects were monitored for an additional 4 hours in the intensive care unit. The average overall difference between forehead zero-heat-flux and pulmonary artery temperatures (i.e., forehead minus pulmonary artery) was -0.23°C (95% limits of agreement of ±0.82); 78% of the differences were ≤0.5°C. The average intraoperative temperature difference was -0.08°C (95% limits of agreement of ±0.88); 84% of the differences were ≤0.5°C. The average postoperative difference was -0.32°C (95% limits of agreement of ±0.75); 84% of the differences were ≤0.5°C. Bias and precision values for neck site were similar to the forehead values. Uncorrected forehead skin temperature showed an increasing negative bias as core temperature decreased. CONCLUSIONS Core temperature can be noninvasively measured using the zero-heat-flux method. Bias was small, but precision was slightly worse than our designated 0.5°C limits compared with measurements from a pulmonary artery catheter.","Eshraghi, Yashar; Nasr, Vivian; Parra-Sanchez, Ivan; Van Duren, Albert; Botham, Mark; Santoscoy, Thomas; Sessler, Daniel I",Anesthesia and analgesia,https://doi.org/10.1213/ane.0000000000000319; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25045862/,634
168896,The Association between Using Personal Protective Equipment and Headache among Healthcare Workers in Saudi Arabia Hospitals during the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is a well-established efficient therapy for hematological diseases, but Graft-Versus-Host Disease (GVHD) is a major and frequent complication encumbering its outcome despite the administration of calcineurin inhibitor based GvHD-prophylaxis. Corticosteroids represent the worldwide first line treatment, however in case of steroid refractory acute GVHD there is no consensus about a subsequent treatment although Ruxolitinib is subject to a phase III trial. Multiple molecules have been tried, most of them immunosuppressive, increasing the risk of deadly infections and transplantation-related mortality (TRM). Recent studies reported that mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) infusion which have immune modulatory abilities might be effective and harmless in steroid or treatment-refractory GVHD (R-GVHD). In France, MSCs are considered as an Advanced Therapy Medicinal Product. For 4 years, its administration as a compassionate use is subject to approval by an expert committee from SFGM-TC before its validation by the French regulatory agency (ANSM). We retrospectively analyzed the demands for MSC use in France since 2011 for patients suffering from R-GVHD. We evaluated the response at day 28 (range 23-28) and at the last follow-up and its safety. Eleven demands were validated by both expert committee and ANSM, 8 patients (pts) received ex-vivo expanded MSCs, 1 pt refused the therapy, 1 infusion was postponed due to COVID-19 related sanitary crisis and the last 1 didn't receive MSCs due to relapse. Among pts who received MSCs, median age was 6 years (2-69), sex ratio was 0,6. All pts underwent their first HSCT for either malignant disease (62,5%) or non-malignant disease (37,5%). Four pts were transplanted from sibling donor, 2 pts from mismatched unrelated donors and 2 pts from haplo-identical donors. Stem cells source was bone marrow for 4 pts, peripheral blood stem cells for 3 and cord blood for 1. Donors median age was 28,8 years (0-49,5), 1 male had a female donor. Six pts got a myeloablative conditioning regimen (TBI-based for 2). All pts received a ciclosporin-based (CSA) GVHD prophylaxis (CSA alone, n=1;CSA + Mycophenolate Mofetil (MMF) or Methotrexate, n=7). Five pts had ATG. Six pts were suffering from acute GVHD, while 2 from extensive chronic GVHD (cGVHD). All 6 pts with acute GVHD presented a grade III or IV, refractory to corticosteroids and at least 2 other lines of GVHD therapy. All but one had a multipolar GVHD with at least 2 affected organs. Five pts were still taking corticosteroids, and six were taking additional immunosuppressive molecules (Tacrolimus, Ruxolitinib, Etanercetp, Inolimomab, MMF) at time of MSC infusion. Five pts received German commercialized MSCs (Obnitixâ, MEDAC, Germany;see Bader et al, 2018), 2 get mother's derived MSCs (not the initial donor), and 1 from a third-party donor. A median of 4 infusions were administered (1-4), once a week for 4 weeks. Mean single dose of MSCs was 1.23.10e6/kg (range: 0,86 - 3). No toxicity was reported except for 1 pt who experienced anaphylactic reaction within minutes, leading to the interruption of infusion (mother's derived MSCs prepared with fetal bovine serum where all other preparations were performed with platelet lysate). The median time from GVHD onset to first MSC infusion was 135 days (63-457). Overall response rate was 86% (6/7) at the first and at the last evaluation with 1 complete response (CR) and 5 partial responses (reduction of at least one grade of at least one affected organ). One pt did not respond and the last 1 was not evaluable due to anaphylactic reaction. Both were suffering from cGVHD. Among the seven pts who received complete MSC infusions, median follow-up was 1,5 months (1,1-18,5) due to premature TRM, overall survival (OS) at six months was 33,3%. Five pts died, all of them from a transplantation-related cause: GVHD n=2, severe infections n=3. Literature reported better outcomes lately, Bader and al, 2019 reported a 64% OS at 6 months and 51% of CR at last follow up. Those disparities might be explained by a delayed treatment after GVHD onset (135 days versus 28 days) and a median of 3 (2-10) therapies after receiving corticosteroids before MSC infusion due to difficulty to obtain MSCs in France. Besides, we included patient suffering from R-cGVHD. Regarding those results, MSC efficacy and safety should be confirmed in a proper clinical trial.

174372,Compliance with personal protective equipment use among non-medical healthcare professionals during Covid-19 pandemic,2021,"The Covid-19 pandemic has clearly represented an unprecedented health crisis throughout 2020 that has implied great changes at both the informational and media levels. Audiovisual content has increased considerably, and health institutions have been interested in demonstrating their position as reliable and first-rate information sources. Indeed, the amount of content disseminated in just 2 months after the declaration of the pandemic exceeded that produced throughout 2019. This study describes the response to this health crisis by the Spanish National Health System on YouTube. To achieve this, the 1,035 audiovisual pieces published by official channels in 2020 were analyzed. To carry out this analysis, each piece was classified into one of seven types (from press conferences to tutorials, recommendations, informative pieces, or testimonials), while the topic covered, the format, as well as the number of views and user comments were determined. The period of greatest production corresponded to the first wave and subsequent deescalation, and the health institution that emitted most messages was the Ministry of Health with 603 videos, 170 animations, and 262 hybrid pieces combining pure video, text, and icons. Animations and hybrid pieces were the most successful messages, being used primarily as guidance to disseminate recommendations and healthy habits. The results of this study highlight the use of animations as a suitable informative resource for education and health promotion. In addition, it identifies the main weaknesses, threats, strengths, and opportunities presented by health audiovisual information on YouTube.","Loiti-Rodriguez, S.; Genaut-Arratibel, A.; Cantalapiedra-Gonzalez, M.

177664,Association between telecommuting environment and low back pain among Japanese telecommuting workers: A cross-sectional study,2021-07-19,"Telebehavioral health emerged as an important practice during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic as an opportunity for continued evidence-based mental health intervention, while minimizing exposure to coronavirus contagion. Though preliminary research suggests feasibility and positive outcomes of telebehavioral health practice for people with schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders, there is limited research about implementation and effectiveness of this practice (Kasckow et al., 2014). This case series highlights the transition from in-person to telebehavioral health practice of a Cognitive Behavioral Social Skills Training for Schizophrenia group due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This article summarizes: (a) the staff procedures needed to transition the group from in-person to telebehavioral health, (b) participant outcome data, (c) session attendance data, and (d) survey results from facilitators and participants about barriers and facilitators of the transition to telebehavioral health, and about how the virtual platform altered the therapeutic relationship and engagement. Participant outcome and engagement data suggest that, not only were two participants able to transition to telehealth and complete the program, but both participants also showed notable improvement in treatment engagement, goal progress, and skill acquisition. Surveys of six facilitators and one participant highlight how the transition to telebehavioral health had treatment advantages (e.g., therapeutic relationship, treatment engagement, group dynamics). Though survey results highlighted several implementation challenges in using the new virtual platform (e.g., technological connectivity, confidential space for engagement), no survey respondents reported that participation in this program resulted in harm to facilitators or participants. All facilitators and one participant agreed that the transition from in-person to virtual services was easy and reduced transportation barriers. Given the limited treatment engagement for this population (Lora et al., 2012) and the importance of early intervention to maximize clinical outcomes (Black et al., 2001, Bottlender et al., 2003), unanimous facilitator and participant report about improved patient attendance and participation in treatment after the transition to telebehavioral health was critically important. Though results of this case study are promising in suggesting telebehavioral health could be a viable modality for providing psychosocial treatment to people with schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders, more rigorous study is needed.","Joseph, Hannah L.; State University, Georgia",Cognitive and Behavioral Practice,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cbpra.2021.06.007,634

Lactate utilization was positively correlated with blood lactate concentration in the healthy calves, but its turnover was markedly reduced in diarrheic animals. The decreased turnover was not due to inhibition of lactate oxidation, but appeared to relate to decreased gluconeogenesis. Glucose entry rate was not affected by diarrhea, but was a function of glucose concentration.","Case, G L; Phillips, R W; Cleek, J L",American journal of veterinary research,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6776854/,634
195136,Personal Protective Equipment: A Cross-Sectional Study in Frontline Healthcare Workers During COVID-19 Outbreak in Tunisia.,2020,"Background Traditional surgical dogma is that paediatric appendicitis necessitates an appendicectomy; however there is an increasing cohort of evidence suggesting that non-operative management (NOM) using antibiotic therapy is safe and effective. During the COVID-19 surge (April - June 2020) with centralization of paediatric surgical care and risks from anaesthetics to both patients and staff a NOM pathway was used to manage clinically diagnosed appendicitis in the Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick Children (RBHSC). Methods Prospective data collection was undertaken of all children (<16 years) diagnosed with appendicitis who entered the NOM pathway in RBHSC from 01/04/2020 to 30/06/2020. This was compared to a cohort from the same timeframe in 2019. Primary end-points were inpatient success rate of NOM and 30-day success rate of NOM (success defined as no appendectomy performed). Results 47 patients completed the NOM pathway, with 43% (20/47) suspected to have complicated appendicitis. The cohort was similar to that of 2019 in terms of age (p=0.1) and sex (p=0.8), but was 155% larger (42 v. 20).For those with simple appendicitis, there was a 96% (26/27) success rate of NOM on discharge, with a 93% (25/27) 30-day success rate. For complicated appendicitis, there was a 40% (8/20) success rate on discharge, with a 30% (6/20) 30-day success rate. Conclusion The use of a NOM pathway for paediatric appendicitis during the COVID-19 surge in Northern Ireland was safe and effective for staff and patients. With a small sample size and restricted follow up more evidence is required to prove if this is an effective treatment modality with a return to normal theatre availability. In the interests of antibiotic stewardship we would not advocate NOM pathways utilisation by non-surgical clinicians.","Colvin, D; Lawther, S",The Ulster medical journal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34276086/,634

201218,Pandemia,2020,"OBJECTIVE To assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated lockdowns on public interest in ophthalmology. METHODS Search interest data for ophthalmic services and conditions were collected from January 1, 2019 to June 21, 2020. Temporal statistical analysis was used to identify significant trends. Weekly data on ophthalmic services and conditions search interest obtained from Google Trends were analyzed with analysis of variance testing and the generalized linear model based on dates. RESULTS Ophthalmic services searches decreased after the first COVID-19 case in the country (p<0.001); ophthalmic services and conditions search interest also declined after the first COVID-19 case and lockdown orders in each state (p<0.001). Following the first in-state COVID-19 case, search interest in ophthalmic services fell more than for ophthalmic conditions (p=0.0088). Lockdown and COVID-19 had similar effects on ophthalmic services search interest (p=0.2246), but interest in ophthalmic conditions decreased more after lockdown than after the first in-state case (p<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS Most of the decrease in search interest in ophthalmic services was associated with COVID-19 rather than lockdown orders, suggesting that public interest in ophthalmic care may be more sensitive to changes in the COVID-19 pandemic than lockdown orders.","Lin, John C; Jiang, Lan; Scott, Ingrid U; Greenberg, Paul B",Rhode Island medical journal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33517603/,634

203387,Impact of Personal Protective Equipment on Surgical Performance During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"BACKGROUND: In Thailand, alcohol is consumed in social setting. The Thai government introduced a ban on alcohol sales and other measures at the beginning of COVID-19 lockdown with gradual lifts. However, drinking behaviors, behaviors of community members, and alcohol marketing activities during the ban and lifts have not been described. METHODS: We contracted a survey research firm to conduct four phone-based cross-sectional surveys between April and July 2020 (n = 6239 participants in total). Participants were recruited from all regions and Bangkok. We also summarized alcohol control measures as reported by multiple sources. We analyzed data from Waves 1 thru 4 using descriptive statistics with adjustment for sampling weight. RESULTS: A total of 6239 persons participated in the 4 waves of surveys. Among survey respondents who were drinkers, half did not drink alcohol during the alcohol sale ban while one-third reported drinking less than usual in the past 30 days. Almost no participant reported drinking more than usual. During the ban (Wave 1), one-sixth of respondents noticed social drinking in their areas while less than 6 percent reported witnessing alcohol sale. Online parties were the predominant alcohol marketing activity, but became less common during Wave 3 compared to Wave 2. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Ever drinkers either abstained from alcohol or drank less than usual during the ban on alcohol sale. However, social drinking and alcohol sale persisted despite the ban.","Wichaidit, Wit; Sittisombut, Monsicha; Assanangkornchai, Sawitri; Vichitkunakorn, Polathep",Drug Alcohol Depend,,634

Despite notable successes in helping to protect the ocean, the scale of actions is simply not now meeting the overriding scale and nature of the ocean's problems that confront us.Moving into a post-COVID-19 world, new policy decisions will need to be made. Some, especially those developed prior to the pandemic, will require changes to their trajectories; others will emerge as a response to this global event. Reconnecting with nature, and specifically with the ocean, will take more than good intent and wishful thinking. Words, and how we express our connection to the ocean, clearly matter now more than ever before.The evolution of the ocean narrative, aimed at preserving and expanding options and opportunities for future generations and a healthier planet, is articulated around six themes: (1) all life is dependent on the ocean; (2) by harming the ocean, we harm ourselves; (3) by protecting the ocean, we protect ourselves; (4) humans, the ocean, biodiversity, and climate are inextricably linked; (5) ocean and climate action must be undertaken together; and (6) reversing ocean change needs action now.This narrative adopts a 'One Health' approach to protecting the ocean, addressing the whole Earth ocean system for better and more equitable social, cultural, economic, and environmental outcomes at its core. Speaking with one voice through a narrative that captures the latest science, concerns, and linkages to humanity is a precondition to action, by elevating humankind's understanding of our relationship with 'planet Ocean' and why it needs to become a central theme to everyone's lives.

208235,Management of diabetes during fasting and COVID-19 - Challenges and solutions,2020,"The current COVID-19 pandemic is evolving rapidly into one of the most devastating public health crises in recent history. By mid-July 2020, reported cases exceeded 13 million worldwide, with at least 575,000 deaths and 7.33 million people recovered. In Oman, over 61,200 confirmed cases have been reported with an infection rate of 1.3. Spatial modeling of disease transmission is important to guide the response to the epidemic at the subnational level. Sociodemographic and healthcare factors such as age structure, population density, long-term illness, hospital beds and nurse practitioners can be used to explain and predict the spatial transmission of COVID-19. Therefore, this research aimed to examine whether the relationships between the incidence rates and these covariates vary spatially across Oman. Global Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), spatial lag and spatial error regression models (SLM, SEM), as well as two distinct local regression models (Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) and multiscale geographically weighted regression MGWR), were applied to explore the spatially non-stationary relationships. As the relationships between these covariates and COVID-19 incidence rates vary geographically, the local models were able to express the non-stationary relationships among variables. Furthermore, among the eleven selected regressors, elderly population aged 65 and above, population density, hospital beds, and diabetes rates were found to be statistically significant determinants of COVID-19 incidence rates. In conclusion, spatial information derived from this modeling provides valuable insights regarding the spatially varying relationship of COVID-19 infection with these possible drivers to help establish preventative measures to reduce the community incidence rate.","Mansour, Shawky; Al Kindi, Abdullah; Al-Said, Alkhattab; Al-Said, Adham; Atkinson, Peter",Sustain Cities Soc,,634
211384,Addendum: Primary care management of the coronavirus (COVID-19),2020,"The possibility of contamination of human skin by infectious virions plays an important role in indirect transmission of respiratory viruses but little is known about the fundamental physico-chemical aspects of the virus-skin interactions. In the case of coronaviruses, the interaction with surfaces (including the skin surface) is mediated by their large glycoprotein spikes that protrude from (and cover) the viral envelope. Here, we perform all atomic simulations between the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein and human skin models. We consider an ""oily"" skin covered by sebum and a ""clean"" skin exposing the stratum corneum. The simulations show that the spike tries to maximize the contacts with stratum corneum lipids, particularly ceramides, with substantial hydrogen bonding. In the case of ""oily"" skin, the spike is able to retain its structure, orientation and hydration over sebum with little interaction with sebum components. Comparison of these results with our previous simulations of the interaction of SARS-CoV-2 spike with hydrophilic and hydrophobic solid surfaces, suggests that the""soft"" or ""hard"" nature of the surface plays an essential role in the interaction of the spike protein with materials.","Domingo, Marc; Faraudo, Jordi",,,634

While 61.0% of gynecological cancer survivors (GCS) in Japan belonged to a working-age group (20-64 years old), the number of working GCS within the working-age population has increased. In Japan, it seems that there has been more interest in striking a balance between cancer treatment and work, especially since 2016 when the Cancer Control Act was amended and national guidelines for working CSs were published. Maintaining employment after gynecological cancer diagnosis remains an important issue for not only GCS and their families but also employers and society. GCS suffered from various symptoms including cancer-related fatigue, pain, menopausal symptoms, lymphedema, and psychological distress, which made maintaining employment difficult for them.

In this study, I applied an adapted SIR model previously used in South Korea to model the MERS outbreak, which is also caused by a coronavirus, to estimate the evolution of the curve of active cases in the case of the Portuguese situation, using Italian dara. I then construct five different scenarios for the evolution of covid-19 in Portugal. In the out of control scenario, the number of active cases could reach as much as ~40,000 people on the 5th of April (out-of-control scenario). If the self-protective and control are taken in the same level as what was considered for the South Korean model, this number could have be reduced to about 800 cases (scenario 1). Considering that this scenario is now unrealistic, three other scenarios were devised. In all these scenarios, the government measures had a 50\% effectiveness when compared to the measures in Korea. But in scenario 2 the transmission rate $\beta$ was effectively reduced to 50\%, In this scenario active cases could reach circa 7,000 people. In scenario 3, the transmission rate $\beta$ was reduced to 70\% of its initial value, in which the number of cases would reach a peak of ~11,000 people. And finally in scenario 4, $\beta$ was reduced to 80\%. In this scenario, the peak would be reached at about ~13,000 cases. This study shows the importance of control and self-protecting measure to bring down the number of affected people by following the recommendations of the WHO and health authorities. With the appropriate measures, this number can be brought down to ~7,000-13,000 people. Hopefully that will be the case not just in Portugal, but in the rest of the World.","Teles, Pedro",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.10047v2.pdf,634

This geographic disparity, in addition to deeply rooted structural inequities, have posed additional challenges to adequately diagnose and provide care for individuals of all ages living in these settings. We describe the impact that COVID-19 has had on geographically disparate populations in the United States and share our recommendations on what might be done to ameliorate the current situation.","Tan, Tina Q; Kullar, Ravina; Swartz, Talia H; Mathew, Trini A; Piggott, Damani A; Berthaud, Vladimir",J Infect Dis,,634
219693,Headaches Associated With Personal Protective Equipment - A Cross-Sectional Study Among Frontline Healthcare Workers During COVID-19,2020,"BACKGROUND: Pneumatosis intestinalis (PI) is a rare condition usually occurring among adults who have undergone solid organ transplant and are taking steroid therapy. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) virus uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 in gastrointestinal epithelium as a receptor for entry process. Due to the steroid intake, the COVID-19 virus is present in the patient's gastrointestinal tract for extended period of time. It may therefore increase the possibility of PI in such patients. It is usually asymptomatic, with a clinical spectrum ranging from indolent to life-threatening. Unfortunately, there are no algorithms concerning diagnosis and treatment of PI. AIM OF STUDY: The aim of this study is to highlight the problem of PI induced by COVID-19, especially in high-risk groups such as solid organs recipients. CONCLUSION: On the basis of the presented case of a severe course of COVID-19-induced PI, we conclude that laparotomy with bowel resection can be a feasible and a safe option for treatment.","Laski, D; Biernat, K; Kaska, L",Transplant. proc,,634

Bacterial co-infections are associated with unfavourable outcomes in respiratory viral infections; however, microbiological and antibiotic data related to COVID-19 are sparse. Adequate use of antibiotics in line with antibiotic stewardship (ABS) principles is warranted during the pandemic. We performed a retrospective study of clinical and microbiological characteristics of 140 COVID-19 patients admitted between February and April 2020 to a German University hospital, with a focus on bacterial co-infections and antimicrobial therapy. The final date of follow-up was 6 May 2020. Clinical data of 140 COVID-19 patients were recorded: The median age was 63.5 (range 17-99) years; 64% were males. According to the implemented local ABS guidelines, the most commonly used antibiotic regimen was ampicillin/sulbactam (41.5%) with a median duration of 6 (range 1-13) days. Urinary antigen tests for Legionella pneumophila and Streptococcus peumoniae were negative in all cases. In critically ill patients admitted to intensive care units (n = 50), co-infections with Enterobacterales (34.0%) and Aspergillus fumigatus (18.0%) were detected. Blood cultures collected at admission showed a diagnostic yield of 4.2%. Bacterial and fungal co-infections are rare in COVID-19 patients and are mainly prevalent in critically ill patients. Further studies are needed to assess the impact of antimicrobial therapy on therapeutic outcome in COVID-19 patients to prevent antimicrobial overuse. ABS guidelines could help in optimising the management of COVID-19. Investigation of microbial patterns of infectious complications in critically ill COVID-19 patients is also required.","Rothe, Kathrin; Feihl, Susanne; Schneider, Jochen; Wallnöfer, Fabian; Wurst, Milena; Lukas, Marina; Treiber, Matthias; Lahmer, Tobias; Heim, Markus; Dommasch, Michael; Waschulzik, Birgit; Zink, Alexander; Querbach, Christiane; Busch, Dirk H; Schmid, Roland M; Schneider, Gerhard; Spinner, Christoph D",Eur. j. clin. microbiol. infect. dis,,634
220729,[The paradox of emergency services during the COVID-19 crisis],2020,"This paper reports the presentation and management of an older female patient who was diagnosed with Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and discharged from an intensive care unit (ICU) after prolonged hospitalization. The patient's COVID-19 test was negative; therefore, she was monitored in the COVID-19 general clinic with normal levels of oxygen saturation (SpO2 ). The patient had been taking Plaquenil for rheumatoid arthritis for a long time. Azithromycin was administered first, and then, the treatment continued with favipiravir according to the national treatment protocol in Turkey. On the third day in the COVID-19 general clinic, she was transferred to the ICU because of decreased saturation levels. Owing to worsening respiratory status and SpO2 <70%, the patient was intubated on the sixth day in the ICU, and every day, she was nursed in a prone position for >16 hours. We believe that the treatment and care activities under qualified and effective nursing care, such as providing appropriate respiratory support at the right time, early initiation and maintenance of anticoagulant therapy, long-term prone positioning, maintaining sufficient fluid resuscitation, and early commencement of balanced enteral nutrition, contributed to the successful discharge of the patient from the ICU. The patient was finally extubated on the 23rd day. Respiratory support was continued with oxygen administered at 2 lt/min through a nasal canula with SpO2 at 94%. We believe that by combining all these factors, the patient's results improved. She was discharged from the ICU after 25 days without any organ dysfunction. During the 25 days of care in the ICU, infectious disease protection and isolation rules were strictly adhered to, and personal protective equipment was worn.","Kebapci, Ayda; Kütük, Kübra; Eker, Emine",Nurs. crit. care,,634

221049,COVID-19 poses novel challenges for global primary care,2020,"BACKGROUND: Residual and recurrent stones remain one of the most important challenges of hepatolithiasis and are reported in 20 to 50% of patients treated for this condition. To date, the two most common surgical procedures performed for hepatolithiasis are choledochojejunostomy and T-tube drainage for biliary drainage. The goal of the present study was to evaluate the therapeutic safety and perioperative and long-term outcomes of choledochojejunostomy versus T-tube drainage for hepatolithiasis patients with sphincter of Oddi laxity (SOL). METHODS/DESIGN: In total, 210 patients who met the following eligibility criteria were included and were randomized to the choledochojejunostomy arm or T-tube drainage arm in a 1:1 ratio: (1) diagnosed with hepatolithiasis with SOL during surgery; (2) underwent foci removal, stone extraction and stricture correction during the operation; (3) provided written informed consent; (4) was willing to complete a 3-year follow-up; and (5) aged between 18 and 70 years. The primary efficacy endpoint of the trial will be the incidence of biliary complications (stone recurrence, biliary stricture, cholangitis) during the 3 years after surgery. The secondary outcomes will be the surgical, perioperative and long-term follow-up outcomes. DISCUSSION: This is a prospective, single-centre and randomized controlled two-group parallel trial designed to demonstrate which drainage method (Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy or T-tube drainage) can better reduce biliary complications (stone recurrence, biliary stricture, cholangitis) in hepatolithiasis patients with SOL.

OBJECTIVES: Describe the perceptions of health professionals in the Central Maghreb (Tunisia, Algeria and Morocco) as to the Strengths/Opportunities and Weaknesses/Threats of the national response plans against COVID-19, during the first weeks of their execution, and report their proposals for optimizing the performance of control strategies. METHODS: This is a qualitative study of the perceptions of health professionals in the Maghreb Central regarding their experience of the first six weeks of fighting the COVID-19 pandemic. The data was collected using the ""Delphi"" technique in one turn, based on an electronic form such as ""Google Form"", developed according to SWOT analysis. The respondents' verbatim was grouped into homogeneous groups of items, the occurrence of which was subsequently measured. RESULTS: A total of 382 health professionals from the Maghreb Central participated in this study, with a median age of 37 years and a median professional tenure of 10 years. The major force of the Maghreb response strategies, the most shared by the respondents, was the performance of the human resources mobilized (doctors, biologists, nurses, etc.) who succeeded in quickly learning from the international epidemiological expertise accumulated in Asia and in Europe. The fight against COVID-19 in the Central Maghreb was confronted with the general and chronic fragility of the national health systems and the low support of the general population for the recommendations of the steering committees of response, threatening the capacity of the Maghreb to confront new epidemics. CONCLUSION: The success of the national response plans against COVID-19 and of possible epidemics or pandemics in the Central Maghreb, is strongly attributed to the commitment of health professionals and to community participation, necessitating the launch of assistant motivation programs. and development of health personnel and mobilization and loyalty of civil society.","Ben Abdelaziz, Ahmed; Benzarti, Sofien; Achouri, Mohamed Yacine; Nouira, Sarra; Mlouki, Imen; Yahia, Faten; Ben Abdelaziz, Asma; Barhoumi, Tarek; Quessar, Asmaa; Ben Salem, Kamel",Tunis Med,,634

It has also challenged conventional wisdom and empirical understandings in the comparative politics and policy of health. Three major questions present themselves: First, some of the countries considered to be the most prepared-having the greatest capacity for outbreak response-have failed to respond effectively to the pandemic. How should our understanding of capacity shift in light of COVID-19, and how can we incorporate political capacity into thinking about pandemic preparedness? Second, several of the mechanisms through which democracy has been shown to be beneficial for health have not traveled well to explain the performance of governments in this pandemic. Is there an authoritarian advantage in disease response? Third, after decades in which coercive public health measures have increasingly been considered counterproductive, COVID-19 has inspired widespread embrace of rigid lockdowns, isolation, and quarantine enforced by police. Will these measures prove effective in the long run and reshape public health thinking? This article explores some of these questions with emerging examples, even amid the pandemic when it is too soon to draw conclusions.","Kavanagh, Matthew M; Singh, Renu",J. health polit. policy law,,634

Ash, the residue from stoves and fires, is a material used for cleaning hands in settings where soap is not widely available. OBJECTIVES: To assess the benefits and harms of hand cleaning with ash compared with hand cleaning using soap or other materials for reducing the spread of viral and bacterial infections. SEARCH METHODS: On 26 March 2020 we searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, WHO Global Index Medicus, and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included all types of studies, in any population, that examined hand cleaning with ash compared to hand cleaning with any other material. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently screened titles and full texts, and one review author extracted outcome data and assessed risk of bias, which another review author double-checked. We used the ROBINS-I tool for observational studies, we used RoB 2.0 for three interventional studies, and we used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence. We planned to synthesise data with random-effects meta-analyses. Our prespecified outcome measures were overall mortality, number of cases of infections (as defined in the individual studies), severity of infectious disease, harms (as reported in the individual studies), and adherence. MAIN RESULTS: We included 14 studies described in 19 records using eight different study designs, but only one randomised trial. The studies were primarily conducted in rural settings in low- and lower-middle-income countries. Six studies reported outcome data relevant to our review. A retrospective case-control study and a cohort study assessed diarrhoea in children under the age of five years and self-reported reproductive tract symptoms in women, respectively. It was very uncertain whether the rate of hospital contacts for moderate-to-severe diarrhoea in children differed between households that cleaned hands using ash compared with households cleaning hands using soap (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.11; very low-certainty evidence). Similarly, it was very uncertain whether the rate of women experiencing symptoms of reproductive tract infection differed between women cleaning hands with ash compared with cleaning hands using soap (RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.12 to 1.86; very low-certainty evidence) or when compared with handwashing with water only or not washing hands (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.13 to 1.96; very low-certainty evidence). Four studies reported on bacteriological counts after hand wash. We rated all four studies at high risk of bias, and we did not synthesise data due to methodological heterogeneity and unclear outcome reporting.

METHODS: Using both qualitative and quantitative approaches, this study investigates strategies used by the Taiwan government to communicate the COVID-19 outbreak and public responses toward these strategies. RESULT: Novel uses of Facebook posts on outbreak communication were identified, including solidarity, reviews of actions, press conferences, and the use of animal and cartoon images. Quantitative results showed that the public responded significantly more frequently to messages generating positive affects, such as posts that reviewed government actions and public efforts; posts that expressed thanks, approval, or comradeship; and posts that paired text with photographs of frontline workers or cute animals. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that, amid a disease outbreak, the public not only look for updated situations and guidelines but also for affective affirmation from government agencies.","Lien, Chia Yu; Wu, Yun-Hsuan",Glob Health Promot,,634

We adapt a control banding model for aerosol-transmissible infectious disease pandemic planning to encourage the use of source and pathway controls before receptor controls (personal protective equipment). Built on the recognition that aerosol-transmissible organisms are likely to exhibit a dose-response function, such that higher exposures result from longer contact times or higher air concentrations, this control banding model offers a systematic method for identifying a set of source and pathway controls that could eliminate or reduce the need for receptor controls. We describe several examples for workers at high risk of exposure in essential or return to work categories.

The clinical features and subsequent medical treatment, combined with the impact of a global pandemic, require specific nutritional therapy in hospitalised adults. This document aims to provide Australian and New Zealand clinicians with guidance on managing critically and acutely unwell adult patients hospitalised with COVID-19. These recommendations were developed using expert consensus, incorporating the documented clinical signs and metabolic processes associated with COVID-19, the literature from other respiratory illnesses, in particular acute respiratory distress syndrome, and published guidelines for medical management of COVID-19 and general nutrition and intensive care. Patients hospitalised with COVID-19 are likely to have preexisting comorbidities, and the ensuing inflammatory response may result in increased metabolic demands, protein catabolism, and poor glycaemic control. Common medical interventions, including deep sedation, early mechanical ventilation, fluid restriction, and management in the prone position, may exacerbate gastrointestinal dysfunction and affect nutritional intake. Nutrition care should be tailored to pandemic capacity, with early gastric feeding commenced using an algorithm to provide nutrition for the first 5-7 days in lower-nutritional-risk patients and individualised care for high-nutritional-risk patients where capacity allows. Indirect calorimetry should be avoided owing to potential aerosole exposure and therefore infection risk to healthcare providers. Use of a volume-controlled, higher-protein enteral formula and gastric residual volume monitoring should be initiated. Careful monitoring, particularly after intensive care unit stay, is required to ensure appropriate nutrition delivery to prevent muscle deconditioning and aid recovery. The infectious nature of SARS-CoV-2 and the expected high volume of patient admissions will require contingency planning to optimise staffing resources including upskilling, ensure adequate nutrition supplies, facilitate remote consultations, and optimise food service management. These guidelines provide recommendations on how to manage the aforementioned aspects when providing nutrition support to patients during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.","Chapple, Lee-Anne S; Fetterplace, Kate; Asrani, Varsha; Burrell, Aidan; Cheng, Allen C; Collins, Peter; Doola, Ra039; eesa,; Ferrie, Suzie; Marshall, Andrea P; Ridley, Emma J",Aust Crit Care,,634

To date, no study has identified specific infection control methods. We aimed to provide practical methods for COVID-19 risk reduction during breast cancer screening mammography (MMG) by examining an overview of potential contamination routes of aerosols and possible risks for patients and health care providers. METHODS: Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations were conducted for airflow and aerosol dispersion in a 3D virtual model of a mobile MMG laboratory room. This model was constructed based on the actual mobile screening MMG bus 'Cosmos' in the Chiba Foundation for Health Promotion & Disease Prevention. Examiner and patient geometries were obtained by scanning an actual human using a 3D Scanner. Contamination of the room was evaluated by counting the numbers of suspended and deposited aerosols. RESULTS: We applied the CFD simulation model to the exhalation of small or large aerosols from a patient and examiner in the MMG laboratory. Only 14.5% and 54.5% of large and small aerosols, respectively, were discharged out of the room with two doors open. In contrast, the proportion of large and small aerosols discharged out of the room increased to 96.6% and 97.9%, respectively, with the addition of forced gentle wind by the blower fan. This simulation was verified by a mist aerosol experiment conducted in the mobile MMG laboratory. CONCLUSION: Adding forced ventilation to a MMG laboratory with two doors open may enable risk reduction dramatically. This could be applied to other clinical situations.","Takada, Mamoru; Tanaka, Gaku; Hashimoto, Hideyuki; Hirai, Yasuyuki; Fukushima, Taichi; Nagashima, Takeshi; Otsuka, Masayuki; Imazeki, Fumio",Breast cancer (Tokyo. 1994),,634

253847,The emotional impact of COVID-19: From medical staff to common people,2020,"In recent work we reported the vibrational spectrum of more than 100,000 known protein structures, and a self-consistent sonification method to render the spectrum in the audible range of frequencies (Extreme Mechanics Letters, 2019). Here we present a method to transform these molecular vibrations into materialized vibrations of thin water films using acoustic actuators, leading to complex patterns of surface waves, and using the resulting macroscopic images in further processing using deep convolutional neural networks. Specifically, the patterns of water surface waves for each protein structure is used to build training sets for neural networks, aimed to classify and further process the patterns. Once trained, the neural network model is capable of discerning different proteins solely by analyzing the macroscopic surface wave patterns in the water film. Not only can the method distinguish different types of proteins (e.g. alpha-helix vs hybrids of alpha-helices and beta-sheets), but it is also capable of determining different folding states of the same protein, or the binding events of proteins to ligands.

Ozone is a harmful pollutant and is responsible for many health issues. However, some reports suggest that ozone is a strong disinfectant, and can kill the viruses. We hereby, report on the vulnerability of ozone due to COVID-19 lockdown whose levels flutter from surging to saturation in a highly polluted Indian capital, due to significant decline in anthropogenic emissions of ozone precursors. Average observed levels stabilized at 30 ppb, 12 ppb, 740 ppb, and 900 ppb for ozone (O3), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), carbon monoxide (CO) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) respectively during lockdown period from 27th March to 10th April 2020. The NO2, CO and VOC declined by 50 %, 37 %, 38 % respectively during the lockdown period of 2020 as compared to similar period in 2019. The anomalous response of ozone during the lockdown is explained by resolving the poorly known complex O3-NOx-VOCs mechanism with the help of data from air monitoring stations in Delhi, India. The data obtained from this study advances the fundamental understanding of ozone chemistry that may lead to improved ozone parameterization in chemical transport models and better planning of ozone risk management strategies for any global mega cities.","Rathod, A; Sahu, S K; Singh, S; Beig, G",Heliyon,,634

There was no correlation between plasma sodium concentrations and sodium input. Plasma concentrations of chloride were elevated, those of potassium decreased. These findings are consistent with abnormally increased renal sodium reabsorption, possibly caused by increased angiotensin II activity secondary to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-induced downregulation of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors. As hypernatremia was associated with increased length of intensive care unit stay, special attention should be paid to the electrolyte status of COVID-19 patients.","Zimmer, Milena A; Zink, Anne K; Weißer, Christian W; Vogt, Ulrike; Michelsen, Andrea; Priebe, Hans-Joachim; Mols, Georg",A A Pract,,634

The government increased Seoul's social distancing to the 2.5 level, and the number of confirmed cases is increasing daily. Due to a shortage of hospital beds, treatment is difficult. Furthermore, gatherings at the end of the year and the beginning of next year are expected to worsen the effects. The purpose of this paper is to emphasize the importance of prediction timing rather than prediction of the number of confirmed cases. Thus, in this study, five groups were set according to minimum, maximum, and high variability. Through empirical data analysis, the groups were subdivided into a total of 19 cases. The cumulative number of COVID-19 confirmed cases is predicted using the auto regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model and compared with the actual number of confirmed cases. Through group and case-by-case prediction, forecasts can accurately determine decreasing and increasing trends. To prevent further spread of COVID-19, urgent and strong government restrictions are needed. This study will help the government and the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency (KDCA) to respond systematically to a future surge in confirmed cases.","Lee, Da Hye; Kim, Youn Su; Koh, Young Youp; Song, Kwang Yoon; Chang, In Hong",,,634

268098,Contributing factors to personal protective equipment shortages during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"PURPOSE: Methadone maintenance treatment is a life-saving treatment for people with opioid use disorders (OUD). The coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) has introduced many concerns surrounding access to opioid treatment. In March 2020, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) issued guidance allowing for the expansion of take-home methadone doses. We sought to describe changes to treatment experiences from the perspective of persons receiving methadone at outpatient treatment facilities for OUD. METHODS: We conducted an in-person survey among 104 persons receiving methadone from three clinics in central North Carolina in June and July 2020. Surveys collected information on demographic characteristics, methadone treatment history, and experiences with take-home methadone doses in the context of COVID-19 (i.e., before and since March 2020). RESULTS: Before COVID-19, the clinic-level percent of participants receiving any amount of days' supply of take-home doses at each clinic ranged from 56% to 82%, while it ranged from 78% to 100% since COVID-19. The clinic-level percent of participants receiving a take-homes days' supply of a week or longer (i.e., &#8805;6 days) since COVID-19 ranged from 11% to 56%. Among 87 participants who received take-homes since COVID-19, only four reported selling their take-home doses. CONCLUSIONS: Our study found variation in experiences of take-home dosing by clinic and little diversion of take-home doses. While SAMSHA guidance should allow expanded access to take-home doses, adoption of these guidelines may vary at the clinic level. The adoption of these policies should be explored further, particularly in the context of benefits to patients seeking OUD treatment.","Figgatt, Mary C; Salazar, Zach; Day, Elizabeth; Vincent, Louise; Dasgupta, Nabarun",J Subst Abuse Treat,,634

We show that, while an early lockdown shifts the contagion in time, beyond a critical value of lockdown strength the epidemic tends to restart after lifting the restrictions. We characterize the relative importance of different lockdown lifting schemes by accounting for two fundamental sources of heterogeneity, i.e. geography and demography. First, we consider Italian Regions as separate administrative entities, in which social interactions between age classes occur. We show that, due to the sparsity of the inter-Regional mobility matrix, once started, the epidemic spreading tends to develop independently across areas, justifying the adoption of mobility restrictions targeted to individual Regions or clusters of Regions. Second, we show that social contacts between members of different age classes play a fundamental role and that interventions which target local behaviours and take into account the age structure of the population can provide a significant contribution to mitigate the epidemic spreading. Our model aims to provide a general framework, and it highlights the relevance of some key parameters on non-pharmaceutical interventions to contain the contagion.","Scala, Antonio; Flori, Andrea; Spelta, Alessandro; Brugnoli, Emanuele; Cinelli, Matteo; Quattrociocchi, Walter; Pammolli, Fabio",Sci Rep,,634

Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) is an analytical technique with promising impact for the point-of-care diagnosis of viruses. It has been applied to a variety of influenza A virus subtypes, such as the H1N1 and the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. In this work, a review of the strategies used for the detection of RVsZO by SERS is presented. In addition, relevant information about the SERS technique, anthropozoonosis, and RVsZO is provided for a better understanding of the theme. The direct identification is based on trapping the viruses within the interstices of plasmonic nanoparticles and recording the SERS signal from gene fragments or membrane proteins. Quantitative mono- and multiplexed assays have been achieved following an indirect format through a SERS-based sandwich immunoassay. Based on this review, the development of multiplex assays that incorporate the detection of RVsZO together with their specific biomarkers and/or secondary disease biomarkers resulting from the infection progress would be desirable. These configurations could be used as a double confirmation or to evaluate the health condition of the patient.","Saviñon-Flores, Fernanda; Méndez, Erika; López-Castaños, Mónica; Carabarin-Lima, Alejandro; López-Castaños, Karen A; González-Fuentes, Miguel A; Méndez-Albores, Alia",Biosensors (Basel),,634

However, several studies demonstrated that not only microorganisms are affected by the disinfectants, but also ocular epithelial cells, which come into contact via residuals at reinsertion of the lens. Visible light has been demonstrated to achieve an inactivation effect on several bacterial and fungal species. Combinations with other disinfection methods often showed better results compared to separately applied methods. We therefore investigated contact lens disinfection solutions combined with 405 nm irradiation, with the intention to reduce the disinfectant concentration of ReNu Multiplus, OptiFree Express or AOSept while maintaining adequate disinfection results due to combination benefits. Pseudomonads, staphylococci and E. coli were studied with disk diffusion assay, colony forming unit (cfu) determination and growth delay. A log reduction of 4.49 was achieved for P. fluorescens in 2 h for 40% ReNu Multiplus combined with an irradiation intensity of 20 mW/cm2 at 405 nm. For AOSept the combination effect was so strong that 5% of AOSept in combination with light exhibited the same result as 100% AOSept alone. Combination of disinfectants with visible violet light is therefore considered a promising approach, as a reduction of potentially toxic ingredients can be achieved.","Hoenes, Katharina; Spellerberg, Barbara; Hessling, Martin",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,634

Makers provided protection to thousands of Californians using locally organized Facebook groups to share patterns, collaborate, problem solve, coordinate mask requests and distribution, and build community when the supply chain fell short.

301210,Using Automated Machine Learning to Predict the Mortality of Patients With COVID-19: Prediction Model Development Study,2021,"SEIR (Susceptible - Exposed - Infected - Recovered) approach is a classic modeling method that has frequently been applied to the study of infectious disease epidemiology. However, in the vast majority of SEIR models and models derived from them transitions from one population group to another are described using the mass-action law which assumes population homogeneity. That causes some methodological limitations or even drawbacks, particularly inability to reproduce observable dynamics of key characteristics of infection such as, for example, the incubation period and progression of the diseases symptoms which require considering different time scales as well as probabilities of different disease trajectories. In this paper, we propose an alternative approach to simulate the epidemic dynamics that is based on a system of differential equations with time delays to precisely reproduce a duration of infectious processes (e.g. incubation period of the virus) and competing processes like transition from infected state to the hospitalization or recovery. The suggested modeling approach is fundamental and can be applied to the study of many infectious disease epidemiology. However, due to the urgency of the COVID-19 pandemic we have developed and calibrated the delay-based model of the epidemic in Germany and France using the BioUML platform. Additionally, the stringency index was used as a generalized characteristic of the non-pharmaceutical government interventions implemented in corresponding countries to contain the virus spread. The numerical analysis of the calibrated model demonstrates that adequate simulation of each new wave of the SARS-CoV-2 virus spread requires dynamic changes in the parameter values during the epidemic like reduction of the population adherence to non-pharmaceutical interventions or enhancement of the infectivity parameter caused by an emergence of novel virus strains with higher contagiousness than original one.

311886,Prediction Models for the Clinical Severity of Patients With COVID-19 in Korea: Retrospective Multicenter Cohort Study,2021,"OBJECTIVES: The rapid production of a large volume of literature during the early phase of the COVID-19 outbreak created a substantial burden for clinicians and scientists. Therefore, this manuscript aims to identify and describe the scientific literature addressing COVID-19 from a dental research perspective, in terms of the manuscript origin, research domain, study type, and level of evidence (LoE). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data were retrieved from Web of Science, Scopus, and PubMed. A descriptive analysis of bibliographic data, collaboration network, and keyword co-occurrence analysis were performed. Articles were further classified according to the field of interest, main research question, type of study, and LoE. RESULTS: The present study identified 296 dental scientific COVID-19 original papers, published in 89 journals, and co-authored by 1331 individuals affiliated with 429 institutions from 53 countries. Although 81.4% were single-country papers, extensive collaboration among the institutions of single countries (Italian, British, and Brazilian institutions) was observed. The main research areas were as follows: the potential use of saliva and other oral fluids as promising samples for COVID-19 testing, dental education, and guidelines for the prevention of COVID-19 transmission in dental practice. The majority of articles were narrative reviews, cross-sectional studies, and short communications. The overall LoE in the analyzed dental literature was low, with only two systematic reviews with the highest LoE I. CONCLUSION: The dental literature on the COVID-19 pandemic does not provide data relevant to the evidence-based decision-making process. Future studies with a high LoE are essential to gain precise knowledge on COVID-19 infection within the various fields of Dentistry. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The published dental literature on COVID-19 consists principally of articles with a low level of scientific evidence which do not provide sufficient reliable high-quality evidence that is essential for decision making in clinical dental practice.","Jacimovic, Jelena; Jakovljevic, Aleksandar; Nagendrababu, Venkateshbabu; Duncan, Henry Fergus; Dummer, Paul M H",Clin. oral investig,,634

Here, we deliberately exploit non-neutralizing RBD antibodies, showing they can dramatically assist in neutralization when linked to neutralizing binders. We identified antigen-binding fragments (Fabs) by phage display that bind RBD, but do not block ACE2 or neutralize virus as IgGs. When these non-neutralizing Fabs were assembled into bispecific VH/Fab IgGs with a neutralizing VH domain, we observed a ~ 25-fold potency improvement in neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 compared to the mono-specific bi-valent VH-Fc alone or the cocktail of the VH-Fc and IgG. This effect was epitope-dependent, reflecting the unique geometry of the bispecific antibody toward Spike. Our results show that a bispecific antibody that combines both neutralizing and non-neutralizing epitopes on Spike-RBD is a promising and rapid engineering strategy to improve the potency of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.","Lim, Shion A; Gramespacher, Josef A; Pance, Katarina; Rettko, Nicholas J; Solomon, Paige; Jin, Jing; Lui, Irene; Elledge, Susanna K; Liu, Jia; Bracken, Colton J; Simmons, Graham; Zhou, Xin X; Leung, Kevin K; Wells, James A",MAbs,,634

Our method generates of diverse mixtures of thousands of recombinant antibodies, enriched for specificity and activity against therapeutic targets. Each hyperimmune globulin product comprised thousands to tens of thousands of antibodies derived from convalescent or vaccinated human donors or from immunized mice. Using this approach, we generated hyperimmune globulins with potent neutralizing activity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) in under 3 months, Fc-engineered hyperimmune globulins specific for Zika virus that lacked antibody-dependent enhancement of disease, and hyperimmune globulins specific for lung pathogens present in patients with primary immune deficiency. To address the limitations of rabbit-derived anti-thymocyte globulin, we generated a recombinant human version and demonstrated its efficacy in mice against graft-versus-host disease.","Keating, Sheila M; Mizrahi, Rena A; Adams, Matthew S; Asensio, Michael A; Benzie, Emily; Carter, Kyle P; Chiang, Yao; Edgar, Robert C; Gautam, Bishal K; Gras, Ashley; Leong, Jackson; Leong, Renee; Lim, Yoong Wearn; Manickam, Vishal A; Medina-Cucurella, Angelica V; Niedecken, Ariel R; Saini, Jasmeen; Simons, Jan Fredrik; Spindler, Matthew J; Stadtmiller, Kacy; Tinsley, Brendan; Wagner, Ellen K; Wayham, Nicholas; Tracy, LaRee; Lundberg, Carina Vingsbo; Büscher, Dirk; Terencio, Jose Vicente; Roalfe, Lucy; Pearce, Emma; Richardson, Hayley; Goldblatt, David; Ramjag, Anushka T; Carrington, Christine V F; Simmons, Graham; Muench, Marcus O; Chamow, Steven M; Monroe, Bryan; Olson, Charles; Oguin, Thomas H; Lynch, Heather; Jeanfreau, Robert; Mosher, Rachel A; Walch, Matthew J; Bartley, Christopher R; Ross, Carl A; Meyer, Everett H; Adler, Adam S; Johnson, David S",Nat. biotechnol,,634
333815,Exploring Nurse and Patient Experiences of Developing Rapport During Oncology Ambulatory Care Videoconferencing Visits: Protocol for a Qualitative Study,2021,"Male sex and older age have been reported to be associated with worse outcomes from COVID-19. It was postulated that estrogens may play a role in reducing the severity of the disease and may therefore offer a treatment option for COVID-19 patients. However, more female cases and deaths from COVID-19 have been recorded in Canada. To determine the potential role of estrogens, we analyzed COVID-19 data from Canada, focusing on the impact of sex and age. Although the overall incidence rate is higher in females than in males, when several high risk groups, including health care workers and long-term care residences, which are predominantly females, were excluded, we found that females had a lower incidence rate than males between the ages of 20s to 70s. Interestingly, this sex-based difference is more evident in females of the reproductive ages (20-49) than in postmenopausal patients (60s or older). Males have significantly higher hospitalization, ICU admission, and case fatality rates; however, a greater difference was observed in the older age groups. Finally, symptom manifestation varied between sexes. Some of the symptoms, which were more frequently observed in patients who recovered than patients who died, were more commonly observed in females of the reproductive age compared to their male counterparts. Since only females of the reproductive age have much higher circulating estrogens than males, these findings suggest that estrogens may play a role in reducing COVID-19 incidence and in the development of symptoms, especially those related to better survival.","O039,; Brien, Jacob; Du, Kevin Y; Peng, Chun",J Ovarian Res,,634
337556,3D printing to support the shortage in personal protective equipment caused by COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"2020 will be remembered worldwide for the outbreak of Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), which quickly spread until it was declared as a global pandemic. The main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2, a key enzyme in coronavirus, represents an attractive pharmacological target for inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 replication. Here, we evaluated whether the anti-inflammatory drug Ibuprofen, may act as a potential SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitor, using an in silico study. From molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we also evaluated the influence of ionic strength on the affinity and stability of the Ibuprofen-Mpro complexes. The docking analysis shows that R(-)Ibuprofen and S(+)Ibuprofen isomers can interact with multiple key residues of the main protease, through hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonds, with favourable binding energies (-6.2 and -5.7 kcal/mol, respectively). MM-GBSA and MM-PBSA calculations confirm the affinity of these complexes, in terms of binding energies. It also demonstrates that the ionic strength modifies significantly their binding affinities. Different structural parameters calculated from the MD simulations (120 ns) reveal that these complexes are conformational stable in the different conditions analysed. In this context, the results suggest that the condition 2 (0.25 NaCl) bind more tightly the Ibuprofen to Mpro than the others conditions. From the frustration analysis, we could characterize two important regions (Cys44-Pro52 and Linker loop) of this protein involved in the interaction with Ibuprofen. In conclusion, our findings allow us to propose that racemic mixtures of the Ibuprofen enantiomers might be a potential treatment option against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. However, further research is necessary to determinate their possible medicinal use. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

346130,Advanced infection control for your practice,2021,"Systemic autoimmune diseases (SAD) are a heterogeneous group of diseases with a common aetiopathogenic basis affecting all ages characterised by a systemic phenotypic expression with a wide range of severity and outcomes that often require immunosuppressive therapies, leaving patients at high risk of infection. Knowledge of the impact of COVID-19 in patients with SAD is limited because most are included in studies carried out in patients with autoimmune and rheumatic diseases (mainly inflammatory arthritis). Most studies supported an increased risk of SARS-Cov-2 infection in patients with AD and SAD. Although case-control studies reported no significant differences in the rate of poor outcomes between patients with and without AD, large population-based studies analysing baseline risk factors reported a 2-3 times higher rate of poor outcomes in patients with AD, especially in those with SAD. Individual risk factors associated with poor outcomes included gender male, older age, and underlying comorbidities and therapies (glucocorticoids, sulfasalazine, immunosuppressants and rituximab). Patients with SAD had less favourable COVID-19 outcomes than those with inflammatory arthritis, possibly due to a differentiated underlying therapeutic approach (glucocorticoids, immunosuppressants and B-cell depleting agents for most SAD, anti-cytokine therapies and JAK inhibitors for inflammatory arthritis). Despite the limited evidence, most studies suggest that patients with SAD have an increased risk of a worse evolution of SARS-CoV-2 infection, including a greater risk of hospitalisation/ICU admission and worse survival rates and, therefore, should be considered a high-risk group for COVID-19.","Brito-Zeron, P.; Siso-Almirall, A.; Flores-Chavez, A.; Retamozo, S.; Ramos-Casals, M.",Clinical &amp; Experimental Rheumatology,,634

The higher school is looking for ways to improve the process of education for young people and opens up new opportunities for the transition to distance learning through the introduction of innovative technologies. The purpose of the study is to find out the pros and cons of distance learning, using the analysis of data obtained through a sociological survey of students. Materials and methods. The material of the research was the answers of 122 students of the Stupino branch of the Moscow Aviation Institute (National Research University) from 1 to 3 courses of the full-time department by filling in Google forms. Results. 42.6% of teaching students positively assessed the importance of switching to the remote platform of the LMS MAI, although only a third of the respondents would like to study remotely next semester. Motivation and involvement in the learning process in the new environment is present in 44.3% of respondents, and 63.9 % of students believe that learning a foreign language at a distance makes it difficult to understand new material. In addition, 73.3% of respondents believe that humanities are easier to study remotely, as opposed to technical subjects. In the organization of the educational process through distance learning, 45.1% of the surveyed students discovered new opportunities to continue learning the language. It should be noted that a third of respondents (32.8%) believe that in the near future, higher education can be fully transferred to distance learning. The method of principal components revealed that the attitude of students to distance learning is not related to the motivation to learn. Conclusion. The drastic reformatting of the educational process with limited internal and external resources of the universities intensified their mobilization in an emergency implementation of distance learning technologies, but not in the systematic use of tools online training, require a much longer preparation time and testing on the students in order to develop a competitive and developing educational system, and natural is not always an orderly and systematic approach. © 2021 LLC Ecological Help.

A workable solution for pandemic preparedness requires leaders of all nations to be on the same page (all for one), aiming at a swift turnaround of the crisis in tandem that can only benefit everyone on a global scale (one for all). After all, a public health crisis of this magnitude involves all humankind, demanding not only the most sensible and intelligent adoption of progressive policies and innovative technology, but an effective balancing of emergency supply chain management (SCM) reserve of personal protective equipment (PPE), professional workers and/or other urgently needed resources (e.g., ICU beds) to save lives. Above all, accurate sharing of information and massive-scale testings vis-à-vis targeted isolations must be sustained. Notably, such a framework may not just be limited to infuenza. Here, the authors elaborate on several key strategies and aim to provide grounds for scientific innovations and clearer policy thinking across international boundaries to combat a global public health pandemic via a league of nations conceived as IPPO: Intercontinental Pandemic Preparedness Organization.","Dey, Sukhen; Cheng, Qiang; Tan, Joseph",,,634

However, evidence of their accuracy for fever screening in adults is lacking. This study aimed to compare the accuracy of non-contact infrared thermometers (NCIT) with temporal artery thermometers (TAT) in an adult hospital. METHODS: A prospective observational study was conducted on a convenience sample of non-infectious inpatients in 2 Australian hospitals. NCIT and TAT devices were used to collect body temperature recordings. Participant characteristics included age, gender, skin color, highest temperature, and antipyretic medications recorded in last 24-hour. RESULTS: In 265 patients, a mean difference of ± 0.26°C was recorded between the NCIT (36.64°C) and the reference TAT (36.90°C) temperature devices. Bland-Altman analysis showed that NCIT and TAT temperatures were closely aligned at temperatures <37.5°C, but not at temperatures >37.5°C. NCIT had low sensitivity (16.13%) at temperatures &#8805;37.5°C. An AUROC score of 0.67 (SD 0.05) demonstrated poor accuracy of the NCIT device at temperatures &#8805;37.5°C. CONCLUSION: This is the first study to compare accuracy of NCIT thermometers to TAT in adult patients. Although mass fever screening is currently underway using NCIT, these results indicate that the NCIT may not be the most accurate device for fever mass screening during a pandemic.","Khan, Shahrukh; Saultry, Bridey; Adams, Scott; Kouzani, Abbas Z; Decker, Kelly; Digby, Robin; Bucknall, Tracey",Am. j. infect. control,,634

This study was guided by Rogers' theory of diffusion of innovations where research objectives were to (1) determine where organizations range in the innovation-decision process of remote work adoption, (2) categorize organizations' level of innovativeness with respect to remote work adoption over time, (3) describe how organizational characteristics relate to remote work adoption, (4) describe how the attributes of remote work relate to the likelihood of remote work adoption among organizations, and (5) describe the extent to which organizations have implemented remote work in response to COVID-19 and their favorability towards the practice.This study followed a non-experimental design with a correlational analysis, collecting cross sectional data from a sample of 1,259 organizational leaders recruited through the use of opt-in panels. Data collection was facilitated by an online survey instrument using Qualtrics software, and principles of the Tailored Design Method were used to substantiate construct and face validity.Results showed that the practice of remote work has been implemented by most organizations in the U.S. Findings indicated organizational leaders perceived the practice of remote work positively and international organizations were twice as likely to adopt remote work compared to those operating only domestically.Results also demonstrated how remote work has become a widespread workplace practice that is becoming increasingly standard across organizations in the U.S. Leaders can use the results to develop formal remote work arrangements in their organizations and should consider training existing employees and leaders in the best practices of remote work operations. Findings from this study also provide the Cooperative Extension System with insights into how it should respond to the widespread adoption of remote work with relevant, research-based educational programming in their local communities.

Our analyses involving molecular phylogenetics is a step toward understanding the transmission clusters that can be correlated to pathophysiology of the disease to gain insight into virulence mechanism. As the infections are increasing rapidly, more divergence is expected followed possibly by viral adaptation. We could identify mutational hotspots which appear to be major drivers of diversity among strains, with RBD of spike protein emerging as the key region involved in interaction with ACE2 and consequently a major determinant of infection outcome. We believe that such molecular analyses correlated with clinical characteristics and host predisposition need to be evaluated at the earliest to understand viral adaptability, disease prognosis, and transmission dynamics.","Sheikh, Javaid Ahmad; Singh, Jasdeep; Singh, Hina; Jamal, Salma; Khubaib, Mohd; Kohli, Sunil; Dobrindt, Ulrich; Rahman, Syed Asad; Ehtesham, Nasreen Zafar; Hasnain, Seyed Ehtesham",Infect Genet Evol,,634

Given the wide clinical spectrum of COVID-19, understanding the factors that can predict disease severity will be essential since this will help frontline clinical staff to stratify patients with increased confidence. To investigate the diagnostic value of the temporal radiographic changes, and the relationship to disease severity and viral clearance in COVID-19 patients. In this retrospective cohort study, we included 99 patients admitted to the Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, with laboratory confirmed moderate or severe COVID-19. Temporal radiographic changes and viral clearance were explored using appropriate statistical methods. Radiographic features from HRCT scans included ground-glass opacity, consolidation, air bronchogram, nodular opacities and pleural effusion. The HRCT scores (peak) during disease course in COVID-19 patients with severe pneumonia (median: 24.5) were higher compared to those with pneumonia (median: 10) (p = 3.56 × 10 -12), with more frequency of consolidation (p = 0.025) and air bronchogram (p = 7.50 × 10-6). The median values of days when the peak HRCT scores were reached in pneumonia or severe pneumonia patients were 12 vs. 14, respectively (p = 0.048). Log-rank test and Spearman's Rank-Order correlation suggested temporal radiographic changes as a valuable predictor for viral clearance. In addition, follow up CT scans from 11 pneumonia patients showed full recovery. Given the values of HRCT scores for both disease severity and viral clearance, a standardised HRCT score system for COVID-19 is highly demanded.","Liu, Xiaofan; Zhou, Hong; Zhou, Yilu; Wu, Xiaojun; Zhao, Yang; Lu, Yang; Tan, Weijun; Yuan, Mingli; Ding, Xuhong; Zou, Jinjing; Li, Ruiyun; Liu, Hailing; Ewing, Rob M; Hu, Yi; Nie, Hanxiang; Wang, Yihua",Sci Rep,,634

In a global crisis like the COVID-19 pandemic, a timely surveillance method is urgently needed to track the impact on public mental health. OBJECTIVE: This brief review focuses on the efficiency and quality of data collection in the existing literature. METHODS: The following search strings were used: ((COVID-19) OR (SARS-CoV-2)) AND ((Mental health) OR (psychological) OR (psychiatry)). We screened the titles, abstracts, and texts to exclude irrelevant articles. We used the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale to evaluate the quality of each research. RESULTS: There were 37 relevant mental health surveys of the general public during the COVID-19 pandemic found by searching the database PubMed on July 10, 2020. All the public mental health surveys examined were cross-sectional in design, and the journals efficiently made these available online in an average of 18.7 (range: 1-64) days from the date the article was received. The average duration of recruitment periods was 9.2 (range: 2-35) days, and the average sample size was 5137 (range: 100-56679). However, 73.0% (27/37) of the studies on the general public had scores on the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale of < 3 points, which suggests these studies are of too low quality for inclusion in a meta-analysis. CONCLUSIONS: This review found that the data collection was efficient but generally had a high risk of bias among existing public mental health surveys. Following a recommendation to avoid selection bias, or to apply novel methodologies considering both longitudinal design and high temporal resolution, would help provide a strong basis for the formation of national mental health policies.","Lin, Yu-Hsuan; Chen, Chung-Yen; Wu, Shiow-Ing",J. med. internet res,,634

Following the biopsychosocial model of health, the goal of the current study was to predict people's psychological well-being (PWB) during the initial lockdown phase of the pandemic and to investigate which coping strategies were most common among people with low and high PWB. Participants were 938 volunteers in the United States who responded to an online survey during the lockdown in April 2020. The main findings were that all three groups of variables, biological, psychological, and socio-economic, significantly contributed to PWB explaining 53% variance. Social loneliness and sense of agency were the strongest predictors. PWB was significantly predicted by physical health (not gender nor age); by spirituality, emotional loneliness, social loneliness, and sense of agency; by job security (not income, nor neighborhood safety, nor hours spent on social media). Comparing the coping strategies of participants, results show more intentional coping in the high-PWB group and more passive coping in the low-PWB group. During this unprecedented pandemic, the findings highlight that ability to sustainably cope with the global shifts in daily life depends on actively and intentionally attending to PWB by being one's own agent for physical health, spiritual health, and social connection.","Tuason, Ma Teresa; Güss, C Dominik; Boyd, Lauren",PLoS One,,634

408606,Caring for Bereaved Family Members During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Before and After the Death of a Patient,2020,"The pathogenesis similarity is leading to the introduction of drugs commonly used in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) into coronavirus disease (COVID-19) treatment. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) was widely used for the treatment of infectious diseases and rheumatic diseases. However, there is little knowledge of the relationship between COVID-19 and RA treatment employing TCM formulas. The present work was aimed to compare the similarity and specificity of TCM formulas for the management of COVID-19 and RA, as well as to deduce the potential mechanism of TCM for COVID-19 treatment. Two formulas including lianhuaqingwen (LHQW) and duhuojisheng (DHJS) were selected as the representatives of TCM for COVID-19 and RA treatment, respectively. An integrated network pharmacology was used to investigate their similarity and specificity. Although different herbs are present in the two formulas, they generated fairly similar ingredients, targets, interaction networks and enriched pathways, which were mainly involved in virus infection, inflammation, and immune dysregulation. Undoubtedly, they also exhibited their respective specificity. LHQW showed the cold property and lung channel tropism which dominated heat-clearing and lung-freeing, while DHJS showed the warm property and liver channel tropism. Herbal compatibility of LHQW was more in line with the rules of the TCM formula against coronavirus disease. Although both formulas suggested multifunctionality in virus infection and inflammation, LHQW was inclined to cope with virus infection, while DHJS was inclined to cope with inflammation. Therefore, LHQW was reliable for providing the desired efficacy in COVID-19 management because of its cold property, lung channel tropism, and multifunctionality for coping with virus infection and inflammation.","Li, Zheng; Chen, Hongwei; Zhang, Huixia; Li, Yan; Wang, Caiyun; Bai, Liping; Zhang, Wei; Jiang, Zhihong",ACS Omega,,634

416908,The Geriatric Acute and Post-Acute Fall Prevention Intervention (GAPcare) II to Assess the Use of the Apple Watch in Older Emergency Department Patients With Falls: Protocol for a Mixed Methods Study,2021,"BACKGROUND: Reports suggest that asymptomatic individuals (those with no symptoms at all throughout infection) with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are infectious, but the extent of transmission based on symptom status requires further study. PURPOSE: This living review aims to critically appraise available data about secondary attack rates from people with asymptomatic, pre-symptomatic and symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection. DATA SOURCES: Medline, EMBASE, China Academic Journals full-text database (CNKI), and pre-print servers were searched from 30 December 2019 to 3 July 2020 using relevant MESH terms. STUDY SELECTION: Studies that report on contact tracing of index cases with SARS-CoV-2 infection in either English or Chinese were included. DATA EXTRACTION: Two authors independently extracted data and assessed study quality and risk of bias. We calculated the secondary attack rate as the number of contacts with SARS-CoV-2, divided by the number of contacts tested. DATA SYNTHESIS: Of 927 studies identified, 80 were included. Summary secondary attack rate estimates were 1% (95% CI 0%-2%) with a prediction interval of 0%-10% for asymptomatic index cases in ten studies, 7% (95% CI 3%-11%) with a prediction interval of 1%-40% for pre-symptomatic cases in 11 studies and 6% (95% CI 5%-8%) with a prediction interval of 5%-38% for symptomatic index cases in 40 studies. The highest secondary attack rates were found in contacts who lived in the same household as the index case. Other activities associated with transmission were group activities such as sharing meals or playing board games with the index case, regardless of the disease status of the index case. LIMITATIONS: We excluded some studies because the index case or number of contacts were unclear. CONCLUSION: Asymptomatic patients can transmit SARS-CoV-2 to others, but our findings indicate that such individuals are responsible for fewer secondary infections than people with symptoms.

416909,The Geriatric Acute and Post-Acute Fall Prevention Intervention (GAPcare) II to Assess the Use of the Apple Watch in Older Emergency Department Patients With Falls: Protocol for a Mixed Methods Study,2021,"BACKGROUND: On February 21 2020, in Schiavonia Hospital occurred the first death by COVID-19 in Italy and since this date SARS-CoV-2 caused more than 100,000 deaths in our country. Our hospital was immediately closed and re-opened after 15 days as a reference Covid Hospital. Among services involved in a process of destruction and rebirth there was also the Vascular Access Team. METHODS: We analyzed our Vascular Access Team activity comparing data from the first month (March) in which basically it did not work and data from the following month (April) in which we began to re-build the Team adapting it to the new reality. RESULTS: In all patients admitted to Intensive Care Unit a Centrally Inserted Central Catheter multilumen was placed, but in March only 5.5% of patients admitted to Medicine-Sub-intensive Unit had a catheter different from the short peripheral cannula while in April it was possible to guarantee a more suitable catheter 31.7% of patients admitted to Medicine-Sub-intensive Unit (p < 0.000). In April, compared to March, a significant higher number of Midline were implanted in Medicine-Sub-intensive Unit (36/139 vs 12/238 p < 0.000) where also a higher number of Centrally Inserted Central Catheter and Femoral Inserted Central Catheter were implanted (8/139 vs 1/238 p = 0.003). This change allowed us to implant more vascular accesses in Medicine-Sub-intensive Unit favoring Midline with a longer average duration. Only one patient with Midline developed a catheter vein thrombosis, and in only one patient the device was removed for suspected infection. CONCLUSIONS: The experience we gained will allow us to be more prepared in the future and our experience has highlighted that a structured Vascular Access Team is necessary to respond adequately to COVID-19 patients' needs, to ensure the effectiveness of the maneuver, to reduce complications and to avoid the waste of resources, always working in safe condition.","Deganello, Elisa; Gastaldo, Francesco; Masiero, Sonia; Fasson, Milena; Colopi, Riccardo Ivan; Girotto, Luciano; Monticelli, Jacopo; Marcante, Elena; Furlan, Patrizia; Baldo, Vincenzo; Pilerci, Claudio; Realdon, Piero; Montemurro, Domenico; Rigo, Alberto; Benini, Patrizia; Baratto, Fabio",J Vasc Access,,634

The virus has gone through various pathways of evolution. For understanding the evolution and transmission of SARS-CoV-2, genotyping of virus isolates is of great importance. We present an accurate method for effectively genotyping SARS-CoV-2 viruses using complete genomes. The method employs the multiple sequence alignments of the genome isolates with the SARS-CoV-2 reference genome. The SNP genotypes are then measured by Jaccard distances to track the relationship of virus isolates. The genotyping analysis of SARS-CoV-2 isolates from the globe reveals that specific multiple mutations are the predominated mutation type during the current epidemic. Our method serves a promising tool for monitoring and tracking the epidemic of pathogenic viruses in their gradual and local genetic variations. The genotyping analysis shows that the genes encoding the S proteins and RNA polymerase, RNA primase, and nucleoprotein, undergo frequent mutations. These mutations are critical for vaccine development in disease control.","Yin, Changchuan",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.10965v1.pdf,634
437962,Social isolation as a means of reducing dysfunctional coronavirus anxiety and increasing psychoneuroimmunity,2020,"Overlapping histological features between benign and malignant lesions and a lack of firm diagnostic criteria for malignancy result in high rates of inter-observer variation in the diagnosis of melanocytic lesions. We aimed to investigate the differential expression of five miRNAs (21, 200c, 204, 205, and 211) in benign naevi (n = 42), dysplastic naevi (n = 41), melanoma in situ (n = 42), and melanoma (n = 42) and evaluate their potential as diagnostic biomarkers of melanocytic lesions. Real-time PCR showed differential miRNA expression profiles between benign naevi; dysplastic naevi and melanoma in situ; and invasive melanoma. We applied a random forest machine learning algorithm to classify cases based on their miRNA expression profiles, which resulted in a ROC curve analysis of 0.99 for malignant melanoma and greater than 0.9 for all other groups. This indicates an overall very high accuracy of our panel of miRNAs as a diagnostic biomarker of benign, dysplastic, and malignant melanocytic lesions. However, the impact of variable lesion percentage and spatial expression patterns of miRNAs on these real-time PCR results was also considered. In situ hybridisation confirmed the expression of miRNA 21 and 211 in melanocytes, while demonstrating expression of miRNA 205 only in keratinocytes, thus calling into question its value as a biomarker of melanocytic lesions. In conclusion, we have validated some miRNAs, including miRNA 21 and 211, as potential diagnostic biomarkers of benign, dysplastic, and malignant melanocytic lesions. However, we also highlight the crucial importance of considering tissue morphology and spatial expression patterns when using molecular techniques for the discovery and validation of new biomarkers.","Quiohilag, Katherine; Caie, Peter; Oniscu, Anca; Brenn, Thomas; Harrison, David",Virchows arch,,634

The author was involved in the preclinical and subsequently in the clinical development and post-marketing surveillance of lormetazepam. Here, he reviews the published and unpublished data about lormetazepam dependence and proposes explanations for contradictory views from other authors. On this basis and in contrast to class labeling from regulatory bodies and WHO, the author comes to the conclusion that use of lormetazepam definitely carries a lower risk of inducing dependence and causing abuse than most other benzodiazepines. This applies as well to Sedalam®, the new i.v. application form of lormetazepam, which is much better tolerated than propofol. Because of its pharmacokinetic properties and because all its effects can be fully antagonized with the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil, this innovative intravenous application form of lormetazepam provides an excellent method for premedication, symptomatic treatment of excitation and anxiety in the context of surgical or diagnostic procedures including outpatient interventions and for basic sedation during anesthesia.","Horowski, Reinhard",J Neural Transm (Vienna),,634

449120,Cover,2021,"The disease COVID-19 has developed into a worldwide pandemic. Hyperinflammation and high levels of several cytokines, for example, IL-6, are observed in severe COVID-19 cases. However, little is known about the cellular origin of these cytokines. Here, we investigated whether circulating leukocytes from patients with COVID-19 had spontaneous cytokine production. Patients with hyperinflammatory COVID-19 (n = 6) and sepsis (n = 3) were included at Skåne University Hospital, Sweden. Healthy controls were also recruited (n = 5). Cytokines were measured in COVID-19 and sepsis patients using an Immulite immunoassay system. PBMCs were cultured with brefeldin A to allow cytokine accumulation. In parallel, LPS was used as an activator. Cells were analyzed for cytokines and surface markers by flow cytometry. High levels of IL-6 and measurable levels of IL-8 and TNF, but not IL-1ß, were observed in COVID-19 patients. Monocytes from COVID-19 patients had spontaneous production of IL-1ß and IL-8 (P = 0.0043), but not of TNF and IL-6, compared to controls. No spontaneous cytokine production was seen in lymphocytes from either patients or controls. Activation with LPS resulted in massive cytokine production by monocytes from COVID-19 patients and healthy controls, but not from sepsis patients. Finally, monocytes from COVID-19 patients produced more IL-1ß than from healthy controls (P = 0.0087) when activated. In conclusion, monocytes contribute partly to the ongoing hyperinflammation by production of IL-1ß and IL-8. Additionally, they are responsive to further activation. This data supports the notion of IL-1ß blockade in treatment of COVID-19. However, the source of the high levels of IL-6 remains to be determined.","Kahn, Robin; Schmidt, Tobias; Golestani, Karan; Mossberg, Anki; Gullstrand, Birgitta; Bengtsson, Anders A; Kahn, Fredrik",J. leukoc. biol,,634

455864,Associations between personal protective equipment and nursing staff stress during the COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"BACKGROUND: Trends in the characteristics and disease severity of patients using an after-hours house call (AHHC) medical service changed during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. However, there have been no reports on this issue since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aimed to investigate patients' tendencies to utilize an AHHC medical service for fever or common cold symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study compared the characteristics and disease severity of patients with fever or common cold symptoms utilizing an AHHC medical service offered by a single large company between the control period (December 1, 2018 to April 30, 2019) and the COVID-19 pandemic exposure period (December 1, 2019 to April 30, 2020). We also assessed the proportion of these patients in relation to all patients calling the service for any reason. RESULTS: During the control and COVID-19 pandemic exposure periods, a total of 6462 and 10,003 patients consulted the AHHC medical service, respectively. Of these, 5335 (82.6%) and 7423 (74.2%) patients had fever and common cold symptoms, respectively, during the control and COVID-19 pandemic exposure periods (P < 0.001). The corresponding median (interquartile range) ages were 8 (3-11) and 10 (4-33) years, respectively. The distribution of disease severity differed between the groups. The proportions of patients with mild, moderate, and severe illness were 71.1, 28.7, and 0.2% in the control period and 42.3, 56.7, and 0.9% in the COVID-19 pandemic exposure period, respectively (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID-19 pandemic, the proportion of patients with fever or common cold symptoms was lower than that in the control period, but disease severity was significantly higher.","Inokuchi, Ryota; Morita, Kojiro; Iwagami, Masao; Watanabe, Taeko; Ishikawa, Masatoshi; Tamiya, Nanako",BMC Emerg Med,,634

DesignPopulation based cohort study. SettingSurvey data from the University College London COVID-19 Social Study. ParticipantsData from 633 adults belonging to ethnic minority groups who took part in the study from 23 July 2020 to 14 June 2021 were included. Experiences of racial/ethnic discrimination occurring since the start of the first lockdown were collected in the last week of July 2020. Structural equation modelling was used to model the direct effect of racial/ethnic discrimination on covid-19 vaccine refusal, as well as the indirect effects through low trust in the central UK government and the UK health service to handle the pandemic. The model adjusted for a range of demographic and covid-19-related covariates. Main outcome measuresData on covid-19 vaccination status was collected from 23 December 2020 to 14 June 2021 and operationalised as having had or agreed to have at least one dose versus having been offered but turned it down (refusal). ResultsNearly one in ten (6.7%) who had refused a covid-19 vaccine reported having experienced racial/ethnic discrimination in a medical setting since the start of the pandemic and had experienced twice as many incidents of racial/ethnic discrimination than those who had accepted the vaccine. The total effect of racial/ethnic discrimination on refusing a covid-19 vaccine was nearly 4-fold (odds ratio [OR] = 3.9, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.4 to 10.9) and was mediated by low trust in the health system to handle the pandemic (indirect effect: OR = 2.5, 95% CI = 1.1 to 5.4). ConclusionsFindings underscore the importance of addressing racial/ethnic discrimination in order to increase covid-19 vaccine uptake amongst ethnic minority adults. The results also highlight the crucial role the National Health Service must play in regaining trust from ethnic minority groups in order to overcome vaccine hesitancy. What is already known on this topicCovid-19 vaccine refusal is higher in ethnic minority groups than in white British adults in the UK. Prior research suggests experiences of racial/ethnic discrimination and mistrust of government and the health system are barriers to uptake. However, longitudinal research examining whether the influence of racial/ethnic discrimination on covid-19 vaccine refusal is mediated by government and health system trust is lacking. What this study addsExperiences of racial/ethnic discrimination increased the likelihood of subsequent covid-19 vaccine refusal nearly 4-fold. This effect was mediated by low trust in the healthcare system, but not the government, to handle the pandemic. Findings support addressing issues of mistrust in the healthcare system and discrimination in order to increase vaccine uptake in ethnic minority adults in the UK.","Paul, Elise; Fancourt, Daisy; Razai, Mohammad",,,634

Visual examination of the world map shows a wide variation of death tolls between countries. The main goal of our series is to determine the best predictors of such discrepancy. Methods: This is a retrospective study in which the rate of COVID-19 deaths was correlated with each of the following independent variables: total tests per 1 million population, gross domestic product (GDP), average temperatures per country, ultraviolet index, median age, average BMI per country, food supply, Bacille Calmette-Guerin compulsory status, and passenger traffic. Results: BMI per country proved to be the second best predictor of death rate with an R value of 0.43, and GDP being the best predictor with R = 0.65. Conclusion: This article shows a tight correlation between average BMI, food supply per country, and COVID-19-related deaths. Such predisposing factors might operate by upregulating the inflammation pathway in heavily struck countries, leading to easier triggering of the infamous cytokine storm syndrome. Obesity also increases cardiovascular and respiratory morbidities, which are coupled to increased ICU demand and deaths among infected cases.Video abstract: http://links.lww.com/CAEN/A25.","Fakhry AbdelMassih, Antoine; Ghaly, Ramy; Amin, Abeer; Gaballah, Amr; Kamel, Aya; Heikal, Bassant; Menshawey, Esraa; Ismail, Habiba-Allah; Hesham, Hend; Attallah, Josephine; Eshak, Kirollos; Moursi, Mai; Khaled-Ibn-ElWalid, Mariam; Tawfik, Marwa; Tarek, Mario; Mohy-El-Din, Mayan; Habib, Menna; Hafez, Nada; Bahnan, Odette; Ismail, Passant; Senoussy, Sara; Ghaly, Sherry; Farah, Sousanna; Hozaien, Rafeef; Adel, Veronia; Khaled, Mariam",Cardiovasc Endocrinol Metab,,634

OBJECTIVE: To study COVID-19 symptoms and SARS-CoV-2 PCR-based swab testing among participants of the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS) and Women's Interagency HIV Study (WIHS). METHODS: A telephone survey was collected April-June 30, 2020. Symptom and testing prevalence were explored. Multivariable logistic regression was used to examine the factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 positivity. RESULTS: The survey was completed by 3411 participants, including 2078 (61%) PLWH and 1333 HIV-seronegative (SN) participants from across the US. Thirteen percent (n = 441) were tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection (13.4% of PLWH vs 12.2% of SN). Among those tested, positivity was higher in PLWH than SN (11.2% vs 6.1%, p = 0.08). Reasons for not being tested included testing not being available (30% of participants) and not knowing where to get tested (16% of participants). Most symptoms reported since January 2020 were similar in PLWH and SN, including headache (23% vs. 24%), myalgias (19% vs 18%), shortness of breath (14% vs 13%), chills (12% vs 10%), fever (6% vs 6%) and loss of taste or smell (6% vs 7%). Among PLWH who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 DNA, the most common symptoms were headache (71%), myalgia (68%), cough (68%) and chills (65%). In multivariable analysis among those tested, the odds of SARS-CoV-2 positivity were higher among PLWH than SN (aOR = 2.22 95%CI = 01.01-4.85, p = 0.046) and among those living with others versus living alone (aOR = 2.95 95%CI = 1.18-7.40). CONCLUSION: Prevalence and type of COVID-19 symptoms were similar in PLWH and SN. SARS-CoV-2 infection may be elevated among PLWH.","D039,; Souza, Gypsyamber; Springer, Gayle; Gustafson, Deborah; Kassaye, Seble; Alcaide, Maria L; Ramirez, Catalina; Sharma, Anjali; Palella, Frank J; Tien, Phyllis C; Detels, Roger; Kempf, Mirjam-Colette; Lahiri, Cecile D; Rinaldo, Charles R; French, Audrey L; Margolick, Joseph B; Adimora, Ada A",HIV Res Clin Pract,,634

Research purpose: The purpose of the research was to determine how prepared IOPs are to counsel employees during the pandemic and how responsive they are to provide counselling. Motivation for the study: It is not clear to what extent such counselling is being practised by IOPs in the workplace during the COVID-19 pandemic. Research approach/design and method: A qualitative approach was used to gain an understanding of registered South African IOPs’ experiences of workplace counselling, particularly during the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. Main findings: Regarding preparedness, we found that IOPs are ill-prepared to counsel in the workplace. Preparedness was influenced by participants’ counselling education, skills and knowledge;experience;convictions about counselling;and psychological and organisational preparedness. Whilst some IOPs did engage in more counselling during the COVID-19 pandemic, most reverted to mitigating actions such as referrals, wellness management, equipping managers and change initiatives. Practical/managerial implications: The results of this study indicate that, under pandemic conditions, there is an increased need for counselling practices within the workplace and that IOPs should explore the ways in which they could play a more active role in such counselling. Contribution/value-add: Although we found that IOPs generally responded to employees’ mental health needs in a positive manner, there was a lack of counselling preparedness and responsiveness during the COVID-19 pandemic.","du Plessis, Marieta Thomas Emma C.",SA Journal of Industrial Psychology,,634

466414,Management of psychiatric conditions and delirium during the COVID-19 pandemic across continents: The lessons thus far,2020,"MOTIVATION: Zoonosis, the natural transmission of infections from animals to humans, is a far-reaching global problem. The recent outbreaks of Zikavirus, Ebolavirus, and Coronavirus are examples of viral zoonosis, which occur more frequently due to globalization. In case of a virus outbreak, it is helpful to know which host organism was the original carrier of the virus to prevent further spreading of viral infection. Recent approaches aim to predict a viral host based on the viral genome, often in combination with the potential host genome and arbitrarily selected features. These methods are limited in the number of different hosts they can predict or the accuracy of the prediction. RESULTS: Here, we present a fast and accurate deep learning approach for viral host prediction, which is based on the viral genome sequence only. We tested our deep neural network (DNN) on three different virus species (influenza A virus, rabies lyssavirus, rotavirus A). We achieved for each virus species an AUC between 0.93 and 0.98, allowing highly accurate predictions while using only fractions (100-400 bp) of the viral genome sequences. We show that deep neural networks are suitable to predict the host of a virus, even with a limited amount of sequences and highly unbalanced available data. The trained DNNs are the core of our virus-host prediction tool VIDHOP (VIrus Deep learning HOst Prediction). VIDHOP also allows the user to train and use models for other viruses.

467296,Safe On-Boat Resuscitation by Lifeguards in COVID-19 Era: A Pilot Study Comparing Three Sets of Personal Protective Equipment,2021,"Vaccines against infectious diseases are urgently needed. Therefore, modern analytical method development should be as efficient as possible to speed up vaccine development. The objectives of the study were to identify critical method parameters (CMPs) and to establish a set of steps to efficiently develop and validate a CE-SDS method for vaccine protein analysis based on a commercially available gel buffer. The CMPs were obtained from reviewing the literature and testing the effects of gel buffer dilution. A four-step approach, including two multivariate DoE (design of experiments) steps, was proposed, based on CMPs and was verified by CE-SDS method development for: (i) the determination of influenza group 1 mini-hemagglutinin glycoprotein; and (ii) the determination of polio virus particle proteins from an inactivated polio vaccine (IPV). The CMPs for sample preparation were incubation temperature(s) and time(s), pH, and reagent(s) concentration(s), and the detection wavelength. The effects of gel buffer dilution revealed the CMPs for CE-SDS separation to be the effective length, the gel buffer concentration, and the capillary temperature. The four-step approach based on the CMPs was efficient for the development of the two CE methods. A four-step approach to efficiently develop capillary gel electrophoresis methods for viral vaccine protein analysis was successfully established.","Geurink, Lars; van Tricht, Ewoud; Dudink, Justin; Pajic, Bojana; Sänger-van de Griend, Cari E",Electrophoresis,,634
467324,Pragmatic Recommendations for the Use of Diagnostic Testing and Prognostic Models in Hospitalized Patients with Severe COVID-19 in Low- and Middle-Income Countries,2021,"In this contribution we focus on togetherness, as one of the key notions in the current COVID-19 crisis. Globally, it is seen as vital to stand and act together to combat the virus, and avoid a tragedy of the commons, in which actors are acting out of self-interest and counterproductively to the general interest. In this essay we analyse the current geographical dissonant developments that the required human togetherness across the globe is facing. We find that the main conflicting tendencies, that we summarise as utilitarian locking up, nationalistic locking in and exclusionary locking out, are all employing a notion of togetherness which is largely based on an in-group solidarity based on either age, gender, ethnicity, nationality or fitness. We argue that such narrow definition of togetherness falls short in dealing with the crisis in an effective as well as non-discriminatory manner, and potentially could even lengthen or worsen the corona crisis. We end with a plea for a different conceptualisation of solidarity in the combat of the crisis, a radical non-dividing form of togetherness: agape.","van Uden, Annelies; van Houtum, Henk",Tijdschr.

METHODS This was an observational, cross-sectional study using digital media, of pregnant women exposed to social distancing due to the COVID-19 pandemic, in Fortaleza, Ceará, Northeastern Brazil. Common mental disorders were estimated using the modified Self-Report Questionnaire-20 (SRQ-20) scale, and the feelings towards COVID-19 were assessed using the Fear of COVID-19 scale through telephone calls made in May 2020. COX multivariate regression models were used to verify the associations. RESULTS Of the 1,041 pregnant women, 45.7% (95%CI: 42.7-48.8) had common mental disorders (CMD). All items of the Fear of COVID-19 Scale showed a significant association with the prevalence of CMD (p &lt; 0.001). A CMD risk gradient was observed, going from a prevalence ratio of 1.52 (95%CI: 1.13-2.04) in pregnant women with two positive items to 2.70 (95%CI: 2.08-3.51) for those with four positive items. Early gestational age and the lack of prenatal care were also associated with CMD. CONCLUSIONS The prevalence of common mental disorders in pregnant women was high during the period of social distancing and was aggravated by negative feelings towards COVID-19.","Machado, Márcia Maria Tavares; Rocha, Hermano Alexandre Lima; Castro, Marcia C; Sampaio, Edgar Gomes Marques; Oliveira, Francisco Ariclene; Silva, Jordan Prazeres Freitas da; Aquino, Camila Machado de; Sousa, Liduina de Albuquerque Rocha de; Carvalho, Francisco Herlanio Costa; Altafim, Elisa Rachel Pisani; Correia, Luciano Lima",Rev. saúde pública (Online),,634

480618,Hospitals' Liabilities in Times of Pandemic: Recalibrating the Legal Obligation to Provide Personal Protective Equipment to Healthcare Workers,2020,"The cumulative number of cases in the current global coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has exceeded 100 million, with the number of deaths caused by the infection having exceeded 2.5 million. Recent reports from most frontline researchers have revealed that SARS-CoV-2 can also cause fatal non-respiratory conditions, such as fatal cardiovascular events. One of the important mechanisms underlying the multiple organ damage that is now known to occur during the acute phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection is impairment of vascular function associated with inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2. To manage the risk of vascular dysfunction-related complications in patients with COVID-19, it would be pivotal to clearly elucidate the precise mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 infects endothelial cells to cause vascular dysfunction. In this review, we summarize the current state of knowledge about the mechanisms involved in the development of vascular dysfunction in the acute phase of COVID-19.","Nakano, Hiroki; Shiina, Kazuki; Tomiyama, Hirofumi",Int. j. mol. sci.

482587,[Pandemic COVID-19: what about patients with mental health disorders?],2020,"Background: Cancer is considered to be an independent risk factor for severe illness and higher mortality in patients with Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). These adverse outcomes have been suspected to be more severe in lung cancer patients. The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to outline patient characteristics, challenges in diagnosis and treatment, and outcomes of lung cancer patients with COVID-19. Methods: A comprehensive search was conducted using EMBASE and PUBMED databases using the terms ""COVID"" and ""cancer."" Studies that reported clinical characteristics and/or outcomes of lung cancer patients with COVID-19 were then systematically identified. Meta-analysis for COVID-19 related mortality associated with lung cancer compared to other cancer types was conducted. The results were reported as odds ratio (OR) and confidence intervals (CI) using mixed-effects logistic regression model. Results: The most commonly reported clinical findings in lung cancer patients with COVID-19 were fever and cough, with 68% and 61%, respectively. Laboratory and radiographic findings were consistent with broadly reported data. The meta-analysis noted a statistically significant increase in mortality rate in lung cancer patients compared to other cancer patients, OR 1.62 (95% CI: 1.06-2.48). Lung cancer patients with COVID-19 also reflected greater severity of illness and higher rates of ICU admissions and mechanical ventilation. Conclusions: COVID-19 in lung cancer patients is associated with severe disease and increased mortality relative to patients with other malignancies and the general population. There is conflicting evidence on the effect of specific lung cancer treatments on outcomes. Until more definitive data is available, lung cancer directed treatment should be continued or restarted as early as possible in mild to moderate cases to prevent worsening cancer-related mortality.","Peravali, M; Joshi, I; Ahn, J; Kim, C",JTO Clin Res Rep,,634
484244,Indirect immunofluorescence for detecting anti-neuronal autoimmunity in CSF after COVID-19 - Possibilities and pitfalls,2021,"Baricitinib is an oral Janus kinase (JAK)1/JAK2 inhibitor approved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) that was independently predicted, using artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms, to be useful for COVID-19 infection via proposed anti-cytokine effects and as an inhibitor of host cell viral propagation. We evaluated the in vitro pharmacology of baricitinib across relevant leukocyte subpopulations coupled to its in vivo pharmacokinetics and showed it inhibited signaling of cytokines implicated in COVID-19 infection. We validated the AI-predicted biochemical inhibitory effects of baricitinib on human numb-associated kinase (hNAK) members measuring nanomolar affinities for AAK1, BIKE, and GAK. Inhibition of NAKs led to reduced viral infectivity with baricitinib using human primary liver spheroids. These effects occurred at exposure levels seen clinically. In a case series of patients with bilateral COVID-19 pneumonia, baricitinib treatment was associated with clinical and radiologic recovery, a rapid decline in SARS-CoV-2 viral load, inflammatory markers, and IL-6 levels. Collectively, these data support further evaluation of the anti-cytokine and anti-viral activity of baricitinib and support its assessment in randomized trials in hospitalized COVID-19 patients.","Stebbing, Justin; Krishnan, Venkatesh; de Bono, Stephanie; Ottaviani, Silvia; Casalini, Giacomo; Richardson, Peter J; Monteil, Vanessa; Lauschke, Volker M; Mirazimi, Ali; Youhanna, Sonia; Tan, Yee-Joo; Baldanti, Fausto; Sarasini, Antonella; Terres, Jorge A Ross; Nickoloff, Brian J; Higgs, Richard E; Rocha, Guilherme; Byers, Nicole L; Schlichting, Douglas E; Nirula, Ajay; Cardoso, Anabela; Corbellino, Mario",EMBO Mol Med,,634

487123,Attitude of family members of health care workers during covid-19 - A questionnaire survey,2020,"Comparative welfare state research is inter-disciplinary par excellence! Relative geographical proximity to objects of scientific inquiry, however, invoked subtly diverse traditions of research on EU welfare states on both sides of the Atlantic. This article surveys the rise of social science institutionalism to paradigmatic hegemony in the field of comparative welfare state research since the late 1980s, while highlighting the European twist to welfare state research in comparison to American approach on the same topic. What stands out for the EU context is that, since the 1990s, a number of European welfare scholars engaged with EU institutions and national governments in social investment agenda-setting. Academically, American research maintained the upper hand on theory and methods. Open institutionalism in empirical research (and policy advice) continues to prove indispensable to effectively exploring and explaining transformative two-level European social policy change over the past two decades. However, despite a robust empirical research track record, welfare state open institutionalism has recently had to face a revitalized behavioralist counter-revolution in both sociology and political science. The outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic, and its associated strong comeback of the competent state as a core political agent, is seemingly giving open institutionalism a new lease in academia. © Società editrice il Mulino.","Hemerijck, A.",Stato e Mercato,,634

The ‘compromise’ consisted of a generalised ban on abortion save in three situations: (i) when pregnancy posed a threat to the woman’s life or health (regardless of the stage of development of the foetus);(ii) when pre-natal tests or other medical procedures indicated a high probability of a severe and irreversible foetal impairment or when the foetus is found to be afflicted with an incurable and life-threatening disease (prior to the foetus becoming viable outside the body of the pregnant woman);and (iii) when there are legitimate reasons to suspect that the pregnancy is a result of a prohibited act, such as rape or incest (in which case abortion was allowed in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy). [...]from day one, legislation in Poland has been shaped without regard to the prevailing standards for women’s rights and the protection of reproductive rights. The first move to amend the law was made in 1996 when the then ruling left-wing coalition voted to allow pregnancies to be terminated by women finding themselves in difficult living conditions or dramatic personal circumstances. 10 On 28 May 1997, however, the full panel of 12 judges of the Tribunal ruled – with three dissenting opinions – the latter amendment unconstitutional. 11 The Tribunal argued that the so-called ‘social premise’ for abortion, ‘serves to legalise the termination of pregnancies without sufficiently demonstrating the need to safeguard some other constitutional value, right or liberty, while also relying on vague legalisation criteria, thereby undermining the constitutional guarantees serving to protect human life’.","Gliszczyńska-Grabias, Aleksandra Sadurski Wojciech",European Constitutional Law Review,,634

Immun. 87 (2020) 144-146]",2020,"BACKGROUND: Over the last decade, virtual reality (VR) has emerged as a cutting-edge technology in stroke rehabilitation. VR is defined as a type of computer-user interface that implements real-time simulation of an activity or environment allowing user interaction via multiple sensory modalities. In a stroke population, VR interventions have been shown to enhance motor, cognitive, and psychological recovery when utilized as a rehabilitation adjunct. VR has also demonstrated noninferiority to usual care therapies for stroke rehabilitation. OBJECTIVE: The proposed pilot study aims to (1) determine the feasibility and tolerability of using a therapeutic VR platform in an inpatient comprehensive stroke rehabilitation program and (2) estimate the initial clinical efficacy (effect size) associated with the VR platform using apps for pain distraction and upper extremity exercise for poststroke neurologic recovery. METHODS: This study will be conducted in the Comprehensive Integrated Inpatient Rehabilitation Program at the James A Haley Veterans' Hospital. Qualitative interviews will be conducted with 10 clinical staff members to assess the feasibility of the VR platform from the clinician perspective. A prospective within-subject pretest-posttest pilot design will be used to examine the tolerability of the VR platform and the clinical outcomes (ie, upper extremity neurologic recovery, hand dexterity, pain severity) in 10 veteran inpatients. A VR platform consisting of commercially available pain distraction and upper extremity apps will be available at the participants' bedside for daily use during their inpatient stay (approximately 4-6 weeks). Clinician interviews will be analyzed using qualitative descriptive analysis. Cohen d effect sizes with corresponding 95% CIs will be calculated for upper extremity neurologic recovery, hand dexterity, and pain. The proportion of participants who achieve minimal clinically important difference after using the VR platform will be calculated for each clinical outcome. RESULTS: This study was selected for funding in August 2020. Institutional review board approval was received in October 2020. The project start date was December 2020. The United States Department has issued a moratorium on in-person research activities secondary to COVID-19. Data collection will commence once this moratorium is lifted. CONCLUSIONS: Our next step is to conduct a large multi-site clinical trial that will incorporate the lessons learned from this pilot feasibility study to test the efficacy of a VR intervention in inpatient rehabilitation and transition to home environments. When VR is used in patients' rooms, it serves to provide additional therapy and may reduce clinician burden. VR also presents an opportunity similar to home-based practice exercises. VR can be implemented in both clinical settings and people's own homes, where engagement in ongoing self-management approaches is often most challenging. This unique experience offers the potential for seamless transition from inpatient rehabilitation to the home.

494793,"Availability, Satisfaction and Use of Personal Protective Equipment Among Healthcare Workers: A Cross-Sectional Assessment of Low- and Middle-Income Countries",2020,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has drastically changed life in the United States, as the country has recorded over 23 million cases and 383,000 deaths to date. In the leadup to widespread vaccine deployment, testing and surveillance are critical for detecting and stopping possible routes of transmission. Contact tracing has become an important surveillance measure to control COVID-19 in the United States, and mobile health interventions have found increased prominence in this space. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the use and usability of MyCOVIDKey, a mobile-based web app to assist COVID-19 contact tracing efforts, during the 6-week pilot period. METHODS: A 6-week study was conducted on the Vanderbilt University campus in Nashville, Tennessee. The study participants, consisting primarily of graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and faculty in the Chemistry Department at Vanderbilt University, were asked to use the MyCOVIDKey web app during the course of the study period. Paradata were collected as users engaged with the MyCOVIDKey web app. At the end of the study, all participants were asked to report on their user experience in a survey, and the results were analyzed in the context of the user paradata. RESULTS: During the pilot period, 45 users enrolled in MyCOVIDKey. An analysis of their enrollment suggests that initial recruiting efforts were effective; however, participant recruitment and engagement efforts at the midpoint of the study were less effective. App use paralleled the number of users, indicating that incentives were useful for recruiting new users to sign up but did not result in users attempting to artificially inflate their use as a result of prize offers. Times to completion of key tasks were low, indicating that the main features of the app could be used quickly. Of the 45 users, 30 provided feedback through a postpilot survey, with 26 (58%) completing it in its entirety. The MyCOVIDKey app as a whole was rated 70.0 on the System Usability Scale, indicating that it performed above the accepted threshold for usability. When the key-in and self-assessment features were examined on their own, it was found that they individually crossed the same thresholds for acceptable usability but that the key-in feature had a higher margin for improvement. CONCLUSIONS: The MyCOVIDKey app was found overall to be a useful tool for COVID-19 contact tracing in a university setting. Most users suggested simple-to-implement improvements, such as replacing the web app framework with a native app format or changing the placement of the scanner within the app workflow. After these updates, this tool could be readily deployed and easily adapted to other settings across the country. The need for digital contact tracing tools is becoming increasingly apparent, particularly as COVID-19 case numbers continue to increase while more businesses begin to reopen.","Scherr, Thomas Foster; DeSousa, Jenna Maria; Moore, Carson Paige; Hardcastle, Austin; Wright, David Wilson",JMIR Public Health Surveill,,634

Accumulative evidence suggests that TNP interferes with cognitive functions, however the underlying mechanisms are not known. The aim of this study was to investigate decision-making performance as well as synaptic and large-scale neural synchronized alterations in the spinal trigeminal nucleus (SpV) circuitry and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) neural circuitry in male rats with TNP. Rat gambling task showed that ION-CCI led to decrease the proportion of good decision makers and increase the proportion of poor decision makers. Electrophysiological recordings showed long-lasting synaptic potentiation of local field potential in the trigeminal ganglia-SpV caudalis (SpVc) synapses in TNP rats. In this study, TNP led to disruption of ACC spike timing and basolateral amygdala (BLA) theta oscillation associated with suppressed synchronization of theta oscillation between the BLA and ACC, indicating reduced neuronal communications. Myelination is critical for information flow between brain regions, and myelin plasticity is an important feature for learning. Neural activity in the cortical regions impacts myelination by regulating oligodendrocyte (OL) proliferation, differentiation, and myelin formation. We characterized newly formed oligodendrocyte progenitor cells, and mature OLs are reduced in TNP and are associated with reduced myelin strength in the ACC region. The functional disturbances in the BLA-ACC neural circuitry is pathologically associated with the myelin defects in the ACC region which may be relevant causes for the deficits in decision-making in chronic TNP state.","Murugappan, Suresh K; Hasan, Mahadi; Lei, Zhuogui; Iqbal, Zafar; Ramkrishnan, Aruna S; Wong, Heung Y; Li, Ying",J. neurosci. res,,634

This contrasts with the literature which assumes single-peaked preferences over the space of probability distributions.

We aimed to investigate whether socioeconomic status affected the risk of contracting COVID-19 in the South Korean population. METHODS: The NHIS-COVID-19 database cohort was used in this population-based study. We collected the data of COVID-19 patients who were diagnosed between January 1, 2020 and June 4, 2020 and those of the control population. The income levels of all individuals as of February 2020 were extracted, and study participants were classified into four groups based on quartiles: Q1 (the lowest) to Q4 (the highest). Data were statistically analyzed using multivariable logistic regression modeling. RESULTS: In total, 122,040 individuals-7669 and 114,371 individuals in the COVID-19 and control groups, respectively-were included in the final analysis. The multivariable logistic regression model showed that the Q1 group had a 1.19-fold higher risk of contracting COVID-19 than the Q4 group, whereas the Q2 and Q3 groups showed no significant differences.

In the &#8805;60 years age group, compared with the Q4 group, the Q1, Q2, and Q3 groups showed a 1.39-, 1.29-, and 1.14-fold higher risks of COVID-19, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Lower socioeconomic status was associated with a higher risk of contracting COVID-19 in South Korea. This association was more evident in the older population (age &#8805; 60 years), whereas both lower and higher socioeconomic statuses were associated with higher risks of contracting COVID-19 in the young adult population (in the 20-39 year age group). Strategies for the prevention of COVID-19 should focus on individuals of lower socioeconomic status and on young adults of higher and lower socioeconomic status.","Oh, Tak Kyu; Choi, Jae-Wook; Song, In-Ae",BMC Public Health,,634

We also tested the moderating role of fake news knowledge in reducing the tendency to share fake news. Data were drawn from social media users (n = 650) in Nigeria, and partial least squares was used to analyse the data. Our results suggest that tie strength was the strongest predictor of fake news sharing related to COVID-19 pandemic. We also found perceived herd, SNS dependency, information-seeking and parasocial interaction to be significant predictors of fake news sharing. The effect of status-seeking on fake news sharing, however, was not significant. Our results also established that fake news knowledge significantly moderated the effect of perceived herd, SNS dependency, information-seeking, parasocial interaction on fake news sharing related to COVID-19. However, tie strength and status-seeking effects were not moderated.","Apuke, Oberiri Destiny; Omar, Bahiyah",Health Educ Res,,634

522116,Management of personal protective equipment in New Zealand during the COVID-19 pandemic: report from the Auditor-General,2020,"PURPOSE: Although acute conjunctivitis has been listed from the beginning as a possible sign of COVID-19, the likelihood of this association remains unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between COVID-19 and conjunctivitis. METHODS: In this retrospective, observational study, we recruited all patients with signs and symptoms of acute conjunctivitis seen at the Eye Emergency Department (ED), Turin Eye Hospital, between 01/01/2020 and 12/05/2020 and cross-checked our data with the Piedmont Region online COVID-19 registry in the same period. RESULTS: Among 10,065 patients seen at our ED during the timespan considered, 88 underwent a nasopharyngeal swab (NS) for SARS-CoV-2 detection within 4 weeks before/after our examination. On average, NS was performed -0.72 ± 1.8 weeks before/after eye examination. Of the 77 patients with a negative NS, 26 (33.8%) had a diagnosis of acute conjunctivitis, whereas the remaining 51 (66.2%) had other eye disorders. Among the 11 patients with COVID-19, 7 (63,6%) had a diagnosis of acute conjunctivitis. We found a non-statistically significant increase in NS positivity rate (21.2%) among cases examined at our ED for acute conjunctivitis, compared to the NS positivity rate (7.3%) in patients examined for all other eye conditions (p = 0.092). The Odds Ratio of having a positive NS in patients with acute conjunctivitis was 3.43 (95% I.C. = 0.9-12.8, p = 0.06). Considering online-registry data of Turin population during the same time-span, among 2441 positive NS cases only 27 (1.1%) presented with acute conjunctivitis. CONCLUSION: Our results do not reveal a statistically significant correlation between COVID-19 and acute conjunctivitis. SYNOPSIS: The present study analyzes retrospectively data from a tertiary eye referral center to investigate the relationship between COVID-19 infection and conjunctivitis.","D039,; Amico Ricci, Giuseppe; Del Turco, Claudia; Belcastro, Elena; Palisi, Marco; Romano, Mario R; Pinna, Antonio; Panico, Claudio; La Spina, Carlo",Eur J Ophthalmol,,634

We used high-dimensional cytometry to analyze 125 COVID-19 patients and compare them with recovered and healthy individuals. Integrated analysis of ~200 immune and ~50 clinical features revealed activation of T cell and B cell subsets in a proportion of patients. A subgroup of patients had T cell activation characteristic of acute viral infection and plasmablast responses reaching >30% of circulating B cells. However, another subgroup had lymphocyte activation comparable with that in uninfected individuals. Stable versus dynamic immunological signatures were identified and linked to trajectories of disease severity change. Our analyses identified three immunotypes associated with poor clinical trajectories versus improving health. These immunotypes may have implications for the design of therapeutics and vaccines for COVID-19.","Mathew, Divij; Giles, Josephine R; Baxter, Amy E; Oldridge, Derek A; Greenplate, Allison R; Wu, Jennifer E; Alanio, Cécile; Kuri-Cervantes, Leticia; Pampena, M Betina; D039,; Andrea, Kurt; Manne, Sasikanth; Chen, Zeyu; Huang, Yinghui Jane; Reilly, John P; Weisman, Ariel R; Ittner, Caroline A G; Kuthuru, Oliva; Dougherty, Jeanette; Nzingha, Kito; Han, Nicholas; Kim, Justin; Pattekar, Ajinkya; Goodwin, Eileen C; Anderson, Elizabeth M; Weirick, Madison E; Gouma, Sigrid; Arevalo, Claudia P; Bolton, Marcus J; Chen, Fang; Lacey, Simon F; Ramage, Holly; Cherry, Sara; Hensley, Scott E; Apostolidis, Sokratis A; Huang, Alexander C; Vella, Laura A; Betts, Michael R; Meyer, Nuala J; Wherry, E John",Science (Wash.),,634
590975,Raising awareness about the unintended consequences of hand sanitiser in children,2021-06-28,"Introduction International studies indicate that pandemics and quarantine can lead to significantly increased stress levels and mental illness in those affected. Stress levels and quality of life in selected population groups in the early phase of the lockdown of the corona pandemic were examined. Associations of coping strategies with perceived stress levels and associations of activities to increase well-being with health-related quality of life as an aspect of well-being are presented. Methods Data from the first survey wave of the CoPa study were evaluated, which were collected via online survey. Group differences regarding stress and quality of life were explorative tested by means of Chi-square tests and T-tests. Associations of coping strategies with stress and of activities to increase well-being with health-related quality of life were calculated using linear regression analysis. Results Among the 5315 participants, persons at risk of mental health and those who did not go out in public showed signs of depression, anxiety disorders and stress significantly more often than other participants. Persons with children under 12 years of age showed significantly higher stress levels than others and their health-related quality of life was comparable. Perceived social support and self-efficacy proved to be resources for stress. Humor, physical activity, healthy eating, maintaining daily routines and pursuing specific goals were positively associated with health-related quality of life. Discussion Persons with mental health risks need therapeutic services in times of reduced contact. Selected measures to increase well-being appear to be effective and should be recommended.","Peters, Elke; Hübner, Joachim; Katalinic, Alexander",Dtsch Med Wochenschr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33260231/; https://doi.org/10.1055/a-1275-3792,634

592693,Inequities in end-of-life care among immigrant patients exaggerated by the COVID-19 pandemic,2021-04-20,"Prenatal infections have been linked to the development of schizophrenia (SCZ) and other neurodevelopmental disorders in the offspring, and work in animal models indicates that this is to occur through the maternal inflammatory response triggered by infection. Several studies in animal models demonstrated that acute inflammatory episodes are sufficient to trigger brain alterations in the adult offspring, especially in the mesolimbic dopamine (DA) system, involved in the pathophysiology of SCZ and other disorders involving psychosis. In the current review, we synthesize the literature on the clinical studies implicating prenatal infectious events in the development of SCZ. Then, we summarize evidence from animal models of maternal immune activation (MIA) and the behavioral and molecular alterations relevant for the function of the DAergic system. Furthermore, we discuss the evidence supporting the involvement of maternal cytokines, such as interleukin 6 (IL-6) and leptin (a hormone with effects on inflammation) in mediating the effects of MIA on the fetal brain, leading to the long-lasting effects on the offspring. In particular, IL-6 has been involved in mediating the effects of MIA animal models in the offspring through actions on the placenta, induction of IL-17a, or triggering the decrease in non-heme iron (hypoferremia). Maternal infection is very likely interacting with additional genetic and environmental risk factors in the development of SCZ; systematically investigating how these interactions produce specific phenotypes is the next step in understanding the etiology of complex psychiatric disorders.","Aguilar-Valles, Argel; Rodrigue, Brandon; Matta-Camacho, Edna",Front Psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.00852; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33061910/,634
593954,A method for evaluating health care workers’ personal protective equipment technique,2011-01-21,"Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic is affecting the world unevenly. One of the highest numbers of cases were recorded in the most polluted regions worldwide. The risk factors for severe COVID-19 include diabetes, cardiovascular, and respiratory diseases. It has been known that the same disease might be worsened by chronic exposure to air pollution. The study aimed to determine whether long-term average exposure to air pollution is associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 cases and deaths in Poland. The cumulative number of COVID-19 cases and deaths for each voivodeship (the main administrative level of jurisdictions) in Poland were collected from March 4, 2020, to May 15, 2020. Based on the official data published by Chief Inspectorate of Environmental Protection voivodeship-level long-term exposure to main air pollution: PM(2.5), PM(10), NO(2), SO(2), O(3) (averaged from 2013 to 2018) was established. There were statistically significant correlation between COVID-19 cases (per 100,000 population) and annual average concentration of PM(2.5) (R(2) = 0.367, p = 0.016), PM(10) (R(2) = 0.415, p = 0.009), SO(2) (R(2) = 0.489, p = 0.003), and O(3) (R(2) = 0.537, p = 0.0018). Moreover, COVID-19 deaths (per 100,000 population) were associated with annual average concentration of PM(2.5) (R(2) = 0.290, p = 0.038), NO(2) (R(2) = 0.319, p = 0.028), O(3) (R(2) = 0.452, p = 0.006). The long-term exposure to air pollution, especially PM(2.5), PM(10), SO(2), NO(2), O(3) seems to play an essential role in COVID-19 prevalence and mortality. Long-term exposure to air pollution might increase the susceptibility to the infection, exacerbates the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infections, and worsens the patients’ prognosis. The study provides generalized and possible universal trends. Detailed analyzes of the phenomenon dedicated to a given region require taking into account data on comorbidities and socioeconomic variables as well as information about the long-term exposure to air pollution and COVID-19 cases and deaths at smaller administrative level of jurisdictions (community or at least district level).","Semczuk-Kaczmarek, Karolina; Rys-Czaporowska, Anna; Sierdzinski, Janusz; Kaczmarek, Lukasz Dominik; Szymanski, Filip Marcin; Platek, Anna Edyta",Intern Emerg Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34637085/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11739-021-02834-5,634

In addition, rapid and accurate diagnosis of a large panel of viral and atypical pathogens can be crucial in immunocompromised patients. OBJECTIVES: First, to evaluate the performance of the Simplexa™ Direct assay system in comparison with direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) and customized Taqman® Array Card (TAC) testing for RSV, Flu A, and Flu B in immunocompromised patients. Second, to evaluate different algorithms for the detection of respiratory pathogens in terms of cost, turn-around-time (TAT) and diagnostic yield. STUDY DESIGN: We collected 125 nasopharyngeal swabs (NTS) and 25 BAL samples from symptomatic immunocompromised patients. Samples for which Simplexa™ and TAC results were discordant underwent verification testing. The TAC assay is based on singleplex RT-PCR, targeting 24 viruses, 8 bacteria and 2 fungi simultaneously. RESULTS: The overall sensitivity was significantly lower for DFA testing than for the two molecular methods (p < 0.05). Performance characteristics of Simplexa™ testing were not significantly different compared to TAC testing (p > 0.1). For BAL samples only, the sensitivity and specificity of the Simplexa™ assay was 100%. In total, 6.7, 16 and 18% of samples were positive for Flu A, Flu B or RSV by DFA, Simplexa™ and TAC testing, respectively. When considering not only these pathogens but also all results for TAC, the method identified 93 samples with one or more respiratory pathogens (62%). A co-infection rate of 15.3% was found by TAC. The estimated costs and TAT were 8.2€ and 2 h for DFA, 31.8€ and 1.5 h for Simplexa™ and 55€ and 3 h for TAC testing. CONCLUSIONS: Performing the Simplexa™ test 24 h a day/7 days a week instead of DFA would considerably improve the overall sensitivity and time-to-result, albeit at a higher cost generated in the laboratory. Performing the TAC would increase the diagnostic yield and detection of co-infections significantly.","Steensels, Deborah; Reynders, Marijke; Descheemaeker, Patrick; Curran, Martin D.; Jacobs, Frédérique; Denis, Olivier; Delforge, Marie-Luce; Montesinos, Isabel",J Virol Methods,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166093416304980; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28365410/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2017.03.013; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093416304980,634

NAFLD encompasses a wide spectrum of liver damage, extending from simple steatosis or non-alcoholic fatty liver (NAFL) to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)—the latter is characterized by inflammation and hepatocyte ballooning degeneration, in addition to the steatosis, with or without fibrosis. NAFLD is now the most common cause of chronic liver disease in Western countries and affects around one quarter of the general population. It is a multisystem disorder, which is associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus as well as liver- and cardiovascular-related mortality. Although earlier studies had suggested that NAFL is benign (i.e., non-progressive), cumulative evidence challenges this dogma, and recent data suggest that nearly 25% of those with NAFL may develop fibrosis. Importantly, NAFLD patients are more susceptible to the toxic effects of alcohol, drugs, and other insults to the liver. This is likely due to the functional impairment of steatotic hepatocytes, which is virtually undetectable by current clinical tests. This review provides an overview of the current evidence on the clinical significance of NAFL and discusses the molecular basis for NAFL development and progression.","Mazzolini, Guillermo; Sowa, Jan-Peter; Atorrasagasti, Catalina; Kücükoglu, Özlem; Syn, Wing-Kin; Canbay, Ali",Cells,https://doi.org/10.3390/cells9112458; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33187255/,634

Using spatial analysis to identify service gaps and inform delivery",2020-04-08,"Since 1997, G1-lineage H9N2 avian influenza viruses have been circulating in Asia and later on in the Middle East, and they have been associated to mild respiratory disease, drops in egg production and moderate mortality in chickens, in particular in the presence of concurrent infections. In this study, we investigated the importance of the G1-lineage H9N2 A/chicken/Israel/1163/2011 virus as a primary pathogen in layers, analyzing its tropism and binding affinity for the oviduct tissues, and investigating the long-term impact on egg production. Besides causing a mild respiratory infection, the virus replicated in the oviduct of 60% of the hens causing different degrees of salpingitis throughout the organ, in particular at the level of the infundibulum, where the detection of the virus was associated with severe heterophilic infiltrate, and necrosis of the epithelium. Binding affinity assays confirmed that the infundibulum was the most receptive region of the oviduct. The drop in egg production was at its peek at 2 weeks post-infection (pi) (60% decrease) and continued up to 80 days pi (35% decrease). On day 80 pi, non-laying birds showed egg yolk peritonitis, and histopathological analyses described profound alteration of the infundibulum architecture, duct ectasia and thinning of the epithelium, while the rest of the oviduct and ovary appeared normal. Our results show that this H9N2 virus is a primary pathogen in layer hens, and that its replication in the infundibulum is responsible for acute and chronic lesions that limits the effective functionality of the oviduct, compromising the commercial life of birds.

Global economies are also spiraling towards a recession in fear of this new life-threatening disease. Vaccines that prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection and therapeutics that reduces the risk of severe Covid-19 are thus urgently needed. A rapid method to derive antiviral treatment for Covid-19 is the use of convalescent plasma derived hyperimmune globulin.

The goal of this review is to examine the body of evidence supporting the hypothesis of immune enhancement that could be pertinent to Covid-19. We also discuss how this risk could be mitigated so that both hyperimmune globulin and vaccines could be rapidly translated to overcome the current global health crisis.","de Alwis, Ruklanthi; Chen, Shiwei; Gan, Esther S.; Ooi, Eng Eong",EBioMedicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32344202/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2352396420301432; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352396420301432?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ebiom.2020.102768,634

Méthodes Il s’agit d’une étude transversale ayant inclus 200 patients obèses suivis à l’Unité d’Obésité de l’Institut National de Nutrition de Tunis. Tous les patients ont été contactés par téléphone pour leur demander s’ils ont été infectés par la Covid-19. Les renseignements clinico-biologiques ont été relevés à partir de leur dossiers. Résultats Notre population était âgée en moyenne de 45±15,9 ans avec un sex-ratio F/H=0,3. L’IMC moyen était de 39,4±5,7kg/m2 avec un tour de taille de 120,5±13,7cm et un pourcentage de masse grasse de 44,5±6 %. L’ancienneté de l’obésité chez nos patients était de 15,5±9,9 ans. Une infection par le COVID-19 a été rapportée dans 15,5 % des cas. Un seul patient avait une forme asymptomatique. La forme pauci-symptomatique était observée dans 9,5 %, et la forme mineure dans 5 % des cas. Une forme compliquée de décès était noté chez un patient. L’étude analytique n’a pas montré de relation statistiquement significative entre la sévérité de l’infection et l’âge, la présence de comorbidités, l’IMC et l’ancienneté de l’obésité. Toutefois, une relation statistiquement significative a été retrouvée entre le pourcentage de masse grasse avec l’infection par le COVID-19 d’une part(p = 0,003), et la sévérité de la maladie(p = 0,006). Conclusion L’obésité est non seulement un facteur de gravité, mais aussi un facteur de risque de la maladie.","Moalla, H.; Ben Amor, N.; Ben Yamna, H.; Mahjoub, F.; Berriche, O.; Khalaf, R.; Boumefteh, S.; Gamoudi, A.; Kacem, A.; Jamoussi, H.",Annales d'Endocrinologie,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0003426621010465; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003426621010465; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ando.2021.08.884,634

How can we improve End-of-Life Care during a Pandemic?,2021-02-13,"The positive impact of probiotic strains on human health has become more evident than ever before. Often delivered through food, dietary products, supplements, and drugs, different legislations for safety and efficacy issues have been prepared. Furthermore, regulatory agencies have addressed various approaches toward these products, whether they authorize claims mentioning a disease’s diagnosis, prevention, or treatment. Due to the diversity of bacteria and yeast strains, strict approaches have been designed to assess for side effects and post-market surveillance. One of the most essential delivery systems of probiotics is within food, due to the great beneficial health effects of this system compared to pharmaceutical products and also due to the increasing importance of food and nutrition. Modern lifestyle or various diseases lead to an imbalance of the intestinal flora. Nonetheless, as the amount of probiotic use needs accurate calculations, different factors should also be taken into consideration. One of the novelties of this review is the presentation of the beneficial effects of the administration of probiotics as a potential adjuvant therapy in COVID-19.

Within the comparative scholarship on migration, small states are often presented as “success stories.” This research questions this assumption and empirical data presented here indicates that many contradictions exist within Luxembourg’s migrant integration model. The country’s “success” in fact does not reflect the levels of integration of migrants nationally as significant inequalities are present in Luxembourg. However, the analysis of Luxembourg presented here illustrates how small states have coherently embraced many paradoxes that are inherent to integration strategies throughout Europe with the goal of promoting peaceful coexistence.","Kolnberger, Thomas; Koff, Harlan",Comp Migr Stud,https://doi.org/10.1186/s40878-021-00222-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33898270/,634
609553,Reflections on the lived experience of working with limited personal protective equipment during the COVID‐19 crisis,2020-10-03,"Bat-borne pathogens such as Nipah virus, SARS-CoV2, and Ebola have been causing significant losses to the global economy and human lives. In this paper, the role of afforestation and agroforestry in mitigating risk of bat-borne disease transmission to humans is explored using an epidemiological-agroforestry model of land use decision on private farms. Farmers owning land in fragmented forest areas are financially incentivized to grow Gmelina arborea- based forests or intermix them with agricultural crops. This reduces forest fragmentation through creating connectivity between forest patches. While agroforestry may increase the chances of contact between bats and humans, a reduction in forest fragmentation improves the carrying capacity of bats and reduces their risk of migration and roosting near human dwellings. Results indicate that afforestation on private lands or promoting agroforestry can help reduce the risk of virus transmission to humans. A small sum paid under a payment for ecosystem services (PES) scheme would be sufficient to incentivize farmers to convert their farmlands into Gmelina arborea -based agroforestry or forests. In absence of substantial PES incentives, private landowners may delay land conversion when financial benefits generated through agroforestry timber sales carry higher weight in their optimization decisions. Whereas the socially optimal land use option would be to immediately convert farmland in affected areas to agroforestry or forests. Therefore, from a policy perspective, promoting PES-based forestry and agroforestry in fragmented bat habitats can help prevent spread of deadly viruses in the future. • Agroforestry can help with vector-borne disease transmission risk mitigation. • Bat-borne pathogen risk transmission can be contained through reducing forest fragmentation. • An epidemiological-agroforestry model derives optimal afforestation on private farms. • Payment for Ecosystem Services (PES) can be utilized for promoting agroforestry. • Socially optimal rate of afforestation in affected areas is higher than the farmers' optimal.

610155,COVID-19 appropriate behavior in India: Time to invest for the benefits in future,2021-05-31,"In Dec 2019, a novel pathogen emerged, and within weeks, led to the emergence of the biggest global health crises seen to date. The virus called ‘SARS-CoV-2’, causes coronavirus disease which was named ‘COVID-19’ by the World Health Organization (WHO). The speedy spread of this infection globally became a source of public worry and several unknowns regarding this new pathogen created a state of panic. Mass media became the major source of information about the novel coronavirus. Much like the previous pandemics of SARS (2003), H1N1 (2009), and MERS (2012), the media significantly contributed to the COVID-19 infodemics. In this review, we analyze the role of mass media and public health communications from December 31, 2019 to July 15, 2020, and make scientific inferences. The COVID-19 pandemic highlights multiple social, cultural, and economic issues arising from the media’s arguable role. The racial prejudices linked to the origin of the virus prevented collaborations among scientists to find a solution. Media coverage of coronavirus news during geographical lockdowns, extended quarantines, and financial and social hardships induced fear and caused psychological stress. Domestic and elderly abuse upsurged. The unscientific cures and unverified medicines endorsed by the politicians and fake doctors proved harmful. The media played a worldwide role in coronavirus disease tracking and updates through live updates dashboard. The media allowed for timely interventions by the Center For Disease Control And Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO), enabling a rapid and widespread reach of public health communications. We saw an upward trend for the promotion of health and hygiene practices worldwide by adaption of safe health practices such as increased hand washing, use of face coverings, and social distancing. Media reinforced illness-preventing guidelines daily, and people were encouraged to use telehealth to meet their healthcare needs. Mass media has an imperative role in today’s world and it can provide a unified platform for all public health communications, comprehensive healthcare education guidelines, and robust social distancing strategies while still maintaining social connections. It can enable equal access to healthcare, end discrimination, and social stigmatization. The role of media and public health communications must be understood and explored further as they will be an essential tool for combating COVID-19 and future outbreaks.","Anwar, Ayesha; Malik, Meryem; Raees, Vaneeza; Anwar, Anjum",Cureus,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33072461/; https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.10453,634

Parallel to research focused on risk factors, it could be useful to investigate the factors that help to cope with such crises at an emotional level. Therefore, this study aimed to strengthen the role of variables that protect from subjective distress during the COVID-19 pandemic, explore the pathways between satisfaction with life and perceived stress, and consider the role of coping strategies and defense mechanisms in this relationship. A sample of 1102 Italian participants who were experiencing the COVID-19 lockdown measures (Mage = 34.91, SD = 11.91) completed an online survey in which the Ten Item Perceived Stress Scale, Satisfaction with Life Scale, Coping Orientation to Problems Experienced Inventory and Forty-Item Defense Style Questionnaire were included. The data were analyzed using Pearson’s r correlations and moderation analysis. A chained-mediation model showed that the relationship between life satisfaction and perceived stress is partially mediated by approach coping, positive attitude and mature defenses. This study contributes toward gaining a better understanding of a protective pathway for mental health outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic. The findings could be useful from both a preventive and an intervention perspective.","Gori, Alessio; Topino, Eleonora; Di Fabio, Annamaria",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33186367/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0242402,634

However, the UK government is increasingly reporting data for the ‘Black’ pan‐ethnicity, especially in the even more generalised ‘BAME’ (‘Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic’) acronym in COVID‐19 pandemic reports. The consequences of this practice are addressed. Firstly, with respect to ethical challenges, Black Africans find their conscription by government into the term BAME offensive and do not accept it as a self‐descriptor. This labelling, which subsumes Black Africans’ self‐assigned ethnicity in the census, and consequent misrecognition may be interpreted as a micro‐aggression (a term coined in the 1970s but used here to denote microinvalidation), as suggested in the current black activism of the ‘Black Lives Matter movement’. Secondly, ONS has warned that concealed heterogeneity renders the pan‐ethnicities unreliably crude, making them scientifically inaccurate. Analysts are recommended to present ethnic group data for the full census classification where possible for reasons of validity and respect for the patient as arbiter of their ethnic group.","Aspinall, Peter J.",Sociol Health Illn,https://doi.org/10.1111/1467-9566.13317; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34145604/,634

615797,Is there antibody-dependent enhancement in SARS Coronavirus 2?,2020-05-31,"Our conception of society–space determines the vantage point from which we critique and transform the social world; the subjects and processes we deem significant; and their relation to a social whole. This article treats four broad frameworks engaged by geographers, each providing distinct conceptual insights about society and space. In the first, a Marxist view of inequity, society–space is a ‘structured coherence’ – a sociospatial formation, whose territorial boundaries approximate politicojuridical boundaries. Geographers’ work on the sociospatial dialectic, spatial fix, and time–space compression have leavened understandings of the spatial dynamics in this approach. The second, a post-structuralist/Foucauldian approach, sees society–space as a ‘strategic field’. Space forms part of the technology of governance that constitutes subjects either as normal/abnormal, legal/illegal, or through states of exception – such as the enemy noncombatant or the illegal alien. In the third, a post-structuralist/feminist approach, society–space is seen as a ‘performative field’ in which subjects negotiate doubled positions and paradoxical spaces – affording insights into larger societal constructs such as the gendering of public/private spheres; racialized people’s passing in a white world; or transsexuals performance of sexuality. In the fourth, a Deleuzian approach, society–space is an ‘immanent field’ in which subjects continuously transform themselves, hybridizing, engaging in acts of conjunction, connection, or collaboration with their milieu. Society–space is understood as stabilizing from the composite lattice of practices that are coded and channeled into a kind of social machine.","Ruddick, Susan",International Encyclopedia of Human Geography,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B978008102295510705X; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B978008102295510705X,634

617547,Allowing visitors back in the nursing home during the COVID-19 crisis – A Dutch national study into first experiences and impact on well-being,2020-06-15,"Since December 2019, countries around the world have been struggling with a novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Case series have reported that people with obesity experience more severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). During the COVID-19 pandemic, people have tended to gain weight because of environmental factors imposed by quarantine policies, such as decreased physical activity and increased consumption of unhealthy food. Mechanisms have been postulated to explain the association between COVID-19 and obesity. COVID-19 aggravates inflammation and hypoxia in people with obesity, which can lead to severe illness and the need for intensive care. The immune system is compromised in people with obesity and COVID-19 affects the immune system, which can lead to complications. Interleukin-6 and other cytokines play an important role in the progression of COVID-19. The inflammatory response, critical illness, and underlying risk factors may all predispose to complications of obesity such as diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular diseases. The common medications used to treat people with obesity, such as glucagon-like peptide-1 analogues, statins, and antiplatelets agents, should be continued because these agents have anti-inflammatory properties and play protective roles against cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. It is also recommended that renin–angiotensin system blockers are not stopped during the COVID-19 pandemic because no definitive data about the harm or benefits of these agents have been reported. During the COVID-19 pandemic, social activities have been discouraged and exercise facilities have been closed. Under these restrictions, tailored lifestyle modifications such as home exercise training and cooking of healthy food are encouraged.","Lim, Soo; Shin, Soo Myoung; Nam, Ga Eun; Jung, Chang Hee; Koo, Bo Kyung",J Obes Metab Syndr,https://doi.org/10.7570/jomes20056; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32544885/,634
618806,Availability of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) Among US and Pakistani Doctors in COVID-19 Pandemic,2020-06-10,"BACKGROUND: Unequal access to healthcare is a global medical problem. Telemedicine, recently made possible by technological advances, may mitigate this inequity. However, the usefulness of telemedicine for procedure-driven disciplines, such as otolaryngology, under infectious conditions (e.g., the COVID-19 pandemic) is unknown. METHODS: Telemedicine was made legal in Taiwan by an amendment to the Physician Act in 2018. Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital was the first hospital in Taiwan to provide the telemedicine service by connecting to the Chenggong Branch of Taitung Hospital (CGBTH) in November 2018. This retrospective cohort study included all new and established otolaryngology outpatient consultations between November 2018 and May 2020 at CGBTH. The Current Procedural Terminology and International Classification of Disease, 10th Revision codes, patient demographic data, and questionnaire data were obtained. RESULTS: The study included 123 patients with 218 encounters over 19 months. The majority of complaints were ear-related (52.6%). Overall, 49% of the encounters required a specialized procedure for diagnosis and treatment; of these, cerumen removal was the most common procedure. The patient subjective improvement rate increased over the study period (from 62.0% to 78.9%). The rates of return and case closure were both around 90% in 2018 and 2019. The number of otolaryngology consultations and rate of return declined after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic; however, the subjective improvement and case closure rates remained stable. The telemedicine service saved at least 2 h driving time per visit. CONCLUSIONS: Telemedicine for otolaryngology is a promising approach for remote and underserved regions, as well as during an infectious disease pandemic.","Wu, Ching-Nung; Luo, Sheng-Dean; Lin, Hsin-Ching; Huang, Jui-Ting; Lee, Chih-Hung; Liu, Song-Yan; Tsai, Ming-Hsien; Wang, Chih-Chi; Fan, Sheng; Wang, Pi-Sheng; Lan, Kuo-Chung",Biomed. j.

New models of follow-up care are needed to meet the growing number and needs of this patient group. The potential for patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) to capture key symptoms and online technology to facilitate long-term follow-up has been suggested. OBJECTIVES: Prior to a pilot study exploring the potential for electronic patient-reported symptom monitoring, the content of an online intervention was developed via Delphi methodology. DESIGN AND SETTING: A Delphi process was conducted aiming to obtain consensus amongst the clinicians and patients from 4 hospitals on the key aspects to monitor during follow-up after ovarian cancer treatment, and how to monitor them in an online intervention. A two round Delphi was conducted. Consensus was defined as at least 70% agreement. RESULTS: Out of 43 participants, 30 (18 patients, 12 healthcare professionals) completed round 1 and 19 (11 patients, 8 healthcare professionals) completed round 2. Consensus was reached on the key symptoms to monitor, and the importance of monitoring both duration and frequency of symptoms. Opportunity for review of psychological wellbeing and holistic needs were considered important by both groups. The frequency of online questionnaire completion, timeframe for patients to reflect on (e.g. during the past X weeks), and the choice of PROMs items to monitor symptoms did not reach the consensus threshold. CONCLUSION: It is crucial that any intervention and the selection of PROMs is fully described to ensure transparency about the development and decisions taken. In this work, a set of key symptoms and areas to monitor were agreed, which has informed the design of an online intervention and a subsequent pilot study is now underway. The proposed model of remote follow-up using electronic PROMs could be adapted and explored in other cancer sites.","Shearsmith, Leanne; Kennedy, Fiona; Lindner, Oana C.; Velikova, Galina",J Patient Rep Outcomes,https://doi.org/10.1186/s41687-020-00237-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32857244/,634

Infections and infection control,2014-07-25,"BACKGROUND: Decline in executive functions and related cognitive processes is associated with mobility decline, and these functions might be amenable to cognitive remediation. This study aimed to examine whether a computerised cognitive remediation programme would improve walking in adults aged 70 years and older. METHODS: This single-blind, randomised trial at one academic centre in the USA evaluated the efficacy of an 8-week computerised programme (also known as brain games) of progressive intensity and complexity to improve walking in older adults at high-risk for mobility disability. Inclusion criteria included being 70 years or older; ambulatory; and at high-risk for mobility disability, defined using a cutscore of nine or less (frail range) on the Short Physical Performance Battery and a walking speed of 100 cm/s or less. Individuals with dementia, acute or terminal medical illnesses, recent or planned surgery affecting mobility, mobility limitations solely due to musculoskeletal limitation or pain that prevented them from completing mobility tests, and those who were nursing home residents were excluded. Participants were block randomised (1:1; block size 12 and no stratification) to the intervention group or the control group (low complexity computer games and health education classes). Primary outcomes were change in walking speed at normal pace and walking while talking conditions assessed from baseline to 8 weeks post-intervention by investigators who were masked to group assignment. Groups were compared using the intention-to-treat principle with linear mixed models adjusted for confounders. This trial was registered with ClinicalTrails.gov, NCT02567227. FINDINGS: Between March 1, 2016, and March 12, 2020, 383 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to the intervention or control group. After randomisation, 11 (3%) patients were diagnosed with dementia. 372 (97%; 271 [73%] women) were included in the intention-to-treat analysis. The mean age of participants was 77·0 years [SD 5·6]). 183 (49·2%) participants were Black and 62 (16·7%) were Hispanic. 314 (93%) of the target 338 completers had finished the intervention when the trial was terminated due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Although there were significant within-group improvements in both groups after the 8-week intervention, there was no significant difference in normal walking speed (−1·03 cm/s [SD 1·30]; 95% CI −3·60 to 1·54) and walking while talking conditions (0·59 cm/s [SD 1·61]; 95% CI −2·59 to 3·76) between the intervention and control groups. Similarly, within-group, but no between-group, differences were seen on executive function tests and physical function. There were no severe adverse events related to interventions. INTERPRETATION: Computerised cognitive remediation improved walking in adults aged 70 years and older at high-risk for mobility disability, but improvements were not significantly greater compared with an active control. Although our findings corroborate the within-group improvements on cognition and mobility reported in previous pilot clinical trials, future studies are required to determine the optimal dose, frequency, intensity, and content of computerised cognitive remediation programmes.

This article reviews the history and evaluation of WHC, as well as opportunities for women's health training. Prior studies comparing WHC with traditional primary care and obstetrics/gynecology clinics have found that WHC offer at least similar levels of preventative care, may increase access to care for a more diverse patient population, and improve patient/provider relationship satisfaction. WHC also increase women's health providers' education and research opportunities. There is still a gap in women's health education and training, although residency and fellowship programs have aimed to address this through women's health tracks and fellowships. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and its negative impact on women's access to care have further highlighted the potential of WHC to meet women's health care demands. WHC can provide comprehensive, convenient, and single-site care for women. The increased opportunities for women's health training through WHC give rise to more representation in leadership and investment in women's health.

We also investigated the moderating role of the perceived hospital management responsiveness on these associations. A cross sectional survey was sent to all professionals from 11 hospitals and clinics in the French-speaking part of Switzerland, in July 2020. Out of 2811 professionals who completed the survey, 436 were HCWs reassigned to COVID-19 units during the first wave of the pandemic and constituted our analysis sample. Results indicated that hospital management responsiveness moderated the association between lack of choice and reassignment experience, indicating that the more HCWs perceived responsiveness, the less the lack of choice affected their experience of reassignment and thus their intent to stay and workplace well-being. Lack of choice during reassignments can reduce intent to stay and workplace well-being, in particular if hospital management is not perceived to be responsive during the crisis. Attempts by hospital management to find solutions, such as flexibility in working hours or extraordinary leaves, can alleviate the perceived constraints of reassignment and be considered signs of responsiveness from hospital management.","Gilles, Ingrid; Mabire, Cédric; Perriraz, Margaux; Peytremann-Bridevaux, Isabelle",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34501566/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18178976,634

To understand the basis of the ADA response and the mechanism of ADA-mediated neutralization, we performed an in-depth analysis of the B and T cell responses in two patients. By characterizing a large panel of NZM-specific monoclonal antibodies, we found that, in both patients, the response was polyclonal and targeted different epitopes of the NZM idiotype. The neutralizing activity was acquired through somatic mutations and correlated with a slow dissociation rate, a finding that was supported by structural data. Interestingly, in both patients, the analysis of the CD4(+) T cell response, combined with mass spectrometry-based peptidomics, revealed a single immunodominant T cell epitope spanning the FR2-CDR2 region of the NZM light chain. Moreover, a CDR2-modified version of NZM was not recognized by T cells, while retaining binding to α4 integrins. Collectively, our integrated analysis identifies the basis of T-B collaboration that leads to ADA-mediated therapeutic resistance and delineates an approach to design novel deimmunized antibodies for autoimmune disease and cancer treatment.","Cassotta, Antonino; Mikol, Vincent; Bertrand, Thomas; Pouzieux, Stéphanie; Le Parc, Josiane; Ferrari, Paul; Dumas, Jacques; Auer, Michael; Deisenhammer, Florian; Gastaldi, Matteo; Franciotta, Diego; Silacci-Fregni, Chiara; Fernandez Rodriguez, Blanca; Giacchetto-Sasselli, Isabella; Foglierini, Mathilde; Jarrossay, David; Geiger, Roger; Sallusto, Federica; Lanzavecchia, Antonio; Piccoli, Luca",Nat Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31501610/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-019-0568-2,634

This study assesses COVID-19’s impact on ophthalmology gender authorship distribution and compares the gender authorship proportion of COVID-19 ophthalmology-related articles to previous ophthalmology articles. METHODS: This cohort study includes authors listed in all publications related to ophthalmology in the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset and CDC COVID-19 research database. Articles from 65 ophthalmology journals from January to July 2020 were selected. All previous articles published in the same journals were extracted from PubMed. Gender-API determined authors’ gender. RESULTS: Out of 119,457 COVID-19-related articles, we analyzed 528 ophthalmology-related articles written by 2518 authors. Women did not exceed 40% in any authorship positions and were most likely to be middle, first, and finally, last authors. The proportions of women in all authorship positions from the 2020 COVID-19 group (29.6% first, 31.5% middle, 22.1% last) are significantly lower compared to the predicted 2020 data points (37.4% first, 37.0% middle, 27.6% last) (p < .01). The gap between the proportion of female authors in COVID-19 ophthalmology research and the 2020 ophthalmology-predicted proportion (based on 2002–2019 data) is 6.1% for overall authors, 7.8% for first authors, and 5.5% for last and middle authors. The 2020 COVID-19 authorship group (1925 authors) was also compared to the 2019 group (33,049 authors) based on journal category (clinical/basic science research, general/subspecialty ophthalmology, journal impact factor). CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 amplified the authorship gender gap in ophthalmology. When compared to previous years, there was a greater decrease in women’s than men’s academic productivity.

Precautionary and preventive measures taken to contain this pandemic impacted the social and educational aspects of these students’ lives. All Umm Al-Qura University (UQU) students were invited to participate in an online survey on 30 impacts, both positive and negative, of the COVID-19 pandemic on their lives. Social impact theory (SIT) was applied to illustrate these impacts. The survey yielded 1,360 responses. The results showed high to moderate levels of agreement regarding students’ perceptions of the positive and negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on their lives, with social aspects impacted more than educational ones; and no statistically significant gender differences. Weak correlations were found between the social aspects and the educational aspects of students’ lives in relation to the impact of the pandemic, although all aspects were correlated positively.

632287,A virtual children's hospice in response to COVID-19: The Scottish experience,2020-05-15,"Background: Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a leading cause of hospitalization and mortality in children. Diagnosis remains challenging and there are no reliable tools to objectively risk stratify patients or predict clinical outcomes. Molecular distance to health (MDTH) is a genomic score that measures the global perturbation of the transcriptional profile and may help classify patients by disease severity. We evaluated the value of MDTH to assess disease severity in children hospitalized with CAP. Methods: Children hospitalized with CAP and matched healthy controls were enrolled in a prospective observational study. Blood samples were obtained for transcriptome analyses within 24 h of hospitalization. MDTH scores were calculated to assess disease severity and correlated with laboratory markers, such as white blood cell count, c-reactive protein (CRP), and procalcitonin (PCT), and clinical outcomes, including duration of fever and duration of hospitalization (LOS). Univariate and multivariable logistic regression were applied to assess factors associated with LOS and duration of fever after hospitalization. Results: Among children hospitalized with CAP (n = 152), pyogenic bacteria (PB) were detected in 16 (11%), Mycoplasma pneumoniae was detected in 41 (28%), respiratory viruses (RV) alone were detected in 78 (51%), and no pathogen was detected in 17 (11%) children. Statistical group comparisons identified 6,726 genes differentially expressed in patients with CAP vs. healthy controls (n = 39). Children with confirmed PB had higher MDTH scores than those with RV (p < 0.05) or M. pneumoniae (p < 0.01) detected alone. CRP (r = 0.39, p < 0.0001), PCT (r = 0.39, p < 0.0001), and MDTHs (r = 0.24, p < 0.01) correlated with duration of fever, while only MDTHs correlated with LOS (r = 0.33, p < 0.0001). Unadjusted analyses showed that both higher CRP and MDTHs were associated with longer LOS (OR 1.04 [1–1.07] and 1.12 [1.04–1.20], respectively), however, only MDTH remained significant when adjusting for other covariates (aOR 1.11 [1.01–1.22]). Conclusions: In children hospitalized with CAP MDTH score measured within 24 h of admission was independently associated with longer duration of hospitalization, regardless of the pathogen detected. This suggests that transcriptional biomarkers may represent a promising approach to assess disease severity in children with CAP.","Wallihan, Rebecca G.; Suárez, Nicolás M.; Cohen, Daniel M.; Marcon, Mario; Moore-Clingenpeel, Melissa; Mejias, Asuncion; Ramilo, Octavio",Front Cell Infect Microbiol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fcimb.2018.00382; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30425971/,634

(2) Methods: using the Spanish Register of Specialized Care-Basic Minimum Database, we estimated the incidence of CAP and HAP. We matched each woman with a man with an identical age, according to comorbidities. (3) Results: we analyzed 518,838 cases of CAP and 38,705 cases of HAP, and 5192 ventilator-associated HAPs (13.4%). The incidence of CAP increased over time in both men (from 384.5 to 449.8 cases/105 population) and women (from 244.9 to 301.2 cases/105 population). Men showed a 47% higher adjusted incidence of CAP than women. The incidence of HAP increased over time in both men (from 302.3 to 342.2 cases/105 population) and women (from 139.2 to 167.6 cases/105 population).

635382,Vicarious traumatization: A psychological problem that cannot be ignored during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020-04-20,"AIMS: We aimed to evaluate the long-term impact of fracture-related infection (FRI) on patients’ physical health and psychological wellbeing. For this purpose, quality of life after successful surgical treatment of FRIs of long bones was assessed. METHODS: A total of 37 patients treated between November 2009 and March 2019, with achieved eradication of infection and stable bone consolidation after long bone FRI, were included. Quality of life was evaluated with the EuroQol five-dimension questionnaire (EQ-5D) and German Short-Form 36 (SF-36) outcome instruments as well as with an International Classification of Diseases of the World Health Organization (ICD)-10 based symptom rating (ISR) and compared to normative data. RESULTS: With a mean follow-up of 4.19 years (SD 2.7) after the last surgery, the mean SF-36 score was 40.1 (SD 14.6) regarding the physical health component and 48.7 (SD 5.1) regarding the mental health component, compared to German normative values of 48.4 (SD 9.2) (p < 0.001) and 50.9 (SD 8.8) (p = 0.143). The mean EQ-5D index reached 0.76 (SD 0.27) with a mean EQ-5D visual analogue scale (VAS) rating of 65.7 (SD 22.7) compared to reference scores of 0.88 (p < 0.001) and 72.9 (p < 0.001). Mean scores of the ISR did not reveal significant psychological symptom burden, while an individual analysis showed moderate to severe impairments in 21.6% (n = 8) of the patients. CONCLUSION: Even a mean 4.2 years (SD 2.7) after surgically successful treatment of FRI of long bones, patients report significantly lower quality of life in comparison to normative data. Future clinical studies on FRIs should focus on patient-related outcome measures enabling best possible shared treatment decision-making.

A novel minimally invasive ultrasound-guided technique for procuring tissue samples of major organs was employed which were thereafter subject to histopathological examination. A detailed review of the course in hospital was noted. An analysis was performed to correlate the cause of death ascertained from our minimally invasive technique with the cause of death ascertained clinically. RESULTS: There was adequate tissue sampling in 45 cases, where the minimally invasive autopsy technique confirmed the cause of death in all 45 cases (100%) and made it more specific in 5 cases (11.11%).

Besides damage caused by feeding, it transmits several tospoviruses. Identification of T. palmi at an early stage is crucial in implementing appropriate pest management strategies. Morpho-taxonomic identification of T. palmi based on the adult stage is time-consuming and needs taxonomic expertise. Here, we report a rapid, on-site, field-based assay for identification of T. palmi based on recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA), its first application in insects. RPA primers designed based on 3′ polymorphisms of the Internal Transcribed Spacer 2 region efficiently discriminated T. palmi without any cross-reactivity to other predominant thrips species. RPA was performed with crude DNA, extracted from single T. palmi simply by crushing in sterile distilled water and could be completed within 20 min by holding the reaction tubes in the hand. The assay was further simplified by using fluorescent as well as colorimetric dyes thus eliminating the gel-electrophoresis steps. The presence of T. palmi was visualized by a change in color from dark blue to sky blue. The assay was validated with known thrips specimens and found to be effective in diagnosing the presence of T. palmi in natural vegetation. This on-site, rapid assay for diagnosis of T. palmi can be used by non-expert personnel in the field of quarantine and pest management.","Priti; Jangra, Sumit; Baranwal, V.

The resilience capacity of the urban system plays an important role in disaster risk response and recovery. Strengthening urban disaster resilience is also fundamental to ensuring sustainable development. Various practices and research for enhancing urban disaster resilience have been carried out worldwide but are yet to be reviewed. Accordingly, this paper gives a scientometric review of urban disaster resilience research by using CiteSpace. The time span (January 2001–January 2021) was selected and divided into three phases based on the number of publications. In addition, according to keyword statistics and clustering results, the collected articles are grouped into four hotspot topics: disaster risk reduction, specific disaster resilience research, resilience assessment, and combination research. The results show that most of the existing research is in the first two categories, and articles in the second and fourth categories both show a high growth rate and could be further research directions. The review indicates that urban disaster resilience is essential for a city’s sustainable development. Moreover, the findings provide scholars a full picture of the existing urban disaster resilience research which can help them identify promising research directions. The findings can also help urban government officials and policymakers review current urban disaster management strategies and make further improvements.","Xu, Hui; Li, Yang; Tan, Yongtao; Deng, Ninghui",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33916024/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18073677,634

We found that skeletal muscle recovery was impaired in old compared with young mice after influenza A virus‐induced pneumonia. In young mice, recovery of muscle loss was associated with expansion of tissue‐resident skeletal muscle macrophages and downregulation of MHC II expression, followed by a proliferation of muscle satellite cells. These findings were absent in old mice and in mice deficient in Cx3cr1. Transcriptomic profiling of tissue‐resident skeletal muscle macrophages from old compared with young mice showed downregulation of pathways associated with phagocytosis and proteostasis, and persistent upregulation of inflammatory pathways. Consistently, skeletal muscle macrophages from old mice failed to downregulate MHCII expression during recovery from influenza A virus‐induced pneumonia and showed impaired phagocytic function in vitro. Like old animals, mice deficient in the phagocytic receptor Mertk showed no macrophage expansion, MHCII downregulation, or satellite cell proliferation and failed to recover skeletal muscle function after influenza A pneumonia. Our data suggest that a loss of phagocytic function in a CX3CR1(+) tissue‐resident skeletal muscle macrophage population in old mice precludes satellite cell proliferation and recovery of skeletal muscle function after influenza A pneumonia.","Runyan, Constance E.; Welch, Lynn C.; Lecuona, Emilia; Shigemura, Masahiko; Amarelle, Luciano; Abdala‐Valencia, Hiam; Joshi, Nikita; Lu, Ziyan; Nam, Kiwon; Markov, Nikolay S.; McQuattie‐Pimentel, Alexandra C.; Piseaux‐Aillon, Raul; Politanska, Yuliya; Sichizya, Lango; Watanabe, Satoshi; Williams, Kinola J.N.; Budinger, G.

The method makes full use of the flexible multi-resolution and multi-directional of NSCT, and the global coupling and pulse synchronization excitation characteristics of PCNN, effectively combining the features of IR image with the texture details of VI image. Experimental results show that the algorithm can combine IR and VI image features well. At the same time, the obtained fusion image can better display the texture information of image. The fusion performance in contrast, detail information and other aspects is better than the classical fusion algorithm, which has better visual effect and evaluation index.","Wu, Chunming; Chen, Long",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32946533/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0239535,634
646174,In-Clinic Versus Web-Based Multidisciplinary Exercise-Based Rehabilitation for Treatment of Low Back Pain: Prospective Clinical Trial in an Integrated Practice Unit Model,2021-03-18,"Objectives: To study the association of human rhinovirus (HRV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and human coronavirus infections in children aged 6 months to 12 years with otitis media with effusion (OME). To determine how long HRV RNA can be detected after HRV infection. Methods: Middle ear effusion (MEE) samples collected at the time of tympanostomy tube placement from 100 children with OME were examined. Viral RNA was detected by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. For HRV the results were compared with virus isolation in cell culture. In vitro studies of the persistence of HRV infectivity and RNA were conducted by combining ~10(5) median cell culture infectious doses of HRV with pooled MEE at 37°C and assaying serial samples for 12 weeks. Results: Virus RNA was detected in 30 children. HRV was detected by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction in 19 children with OME and by virus isolation in 5 children. RSV RNA was found in 8 and HCV in 3 children with OME. No dual viral infection was found. Bacterial pathogens were isolated from 35 MEE samples and were associated with viral RNA in 11 cases, most often with HRV (9 cases). Under in vitro conditions, HRV culture positivity declined rapidly (<2 days), but RNA was detectable for up to 8 weeks. Conclusions: These results suggest that virus infection, particularly HRV infection, either alone or concurrent with bacteria, is present in a larger percentage of children with OME than previously suspected. It remains to be determined how often the presence of viral RNA in MEE represents persistent RNA, ongoing viral replication, or recurrent infection.

Here, we provide preliminary data on stem cell based innate defense against a mouse model of coronavirus, murine hepatitis virus-1 (MHV-1) infection. In a mouse model of mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) mediated Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) dormancy, MHV-1 infection in the lung exhibited 20 fold lower viral loads than the healthy control mice, suggesting the potential enhancement of an anti-MHV-1 defense by Mtb. This defense mechanism involves the in vivo expansion and reprogramming of CD271+MSCs in the lung to an enhanced stemness phenotype. The reprogrammed MSCs facilitate the activation of stemness genes, intracellular Mtb replication, and extracellular release of Mtb. The conditioned media of the reprogrammed MSCs exhibit direct anti-viral activity in an in vitro model of MHV-1 induced toxicity to type II alveolar epithelial cells. Thus, our data suggest that reprogrammed MSCs exert a unique innate defense against MHV-1 by activating dormant Mtb. The molecular details of this anti-viral defense mechanism against coronavirus could be further studied to develop a vaccine against COVID-19.","Pathak, Lekhika; Gayan, Sukanya; Pal, Bidisha; Talukdar, Joyeeta; Bhuyan, Seema; Sandhya, Sorra; Yeger, Herman; Baishya, Debabrat; Das, Bikul",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.06.077883,634

Our analysis revealed the occurrence of mutations at 173 residues of Orf3a protein. Subsequently, protein modelling was performed that revealed twelve mutations which can considerably affect the stability of Orf3a. Among the 12 mutations, three mutations (Y160H, D210Y and S171L) also lead to alterations in secondary structure and protein disorder parameters of the Orf3a protein. Further, we used predictive tools to identify five promising epitopes of B-cells, which resides in the mutated regions of Orf3a.

The rollout of vaccines in several parts of the world is being hailed as a solution to the crisis. With newer and more virulent serotypes on the horizon and limited vaccine available, evaluation of safety and immunogenicity is critical for rationalization of vaccine use in public health. Objective To evaluate real world safety, and, immunogenicity of the Covishield vaccine, ChAdOx1 nCoV- 19 Corona Virus Vaccine (Recombinant) in Health Care Workers (HCW) during the national vaccine roll out in the NCR, New Delhi. The safety is evaluated through Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events reported though enhanced pharmacovigilance protocols, and, the immunogenicity by quantitative determination of anti-S1 and anti-S2 specific IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in serum samples collected before the receipt of the vaccine and 14 days after dose 1, using the fully automated LIAISON SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG test using the chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA) Results: In the two weeks after immunization with the Covishield vaccine {ChAdOx1 nCoV- 19 Corona Virus Vaccine (Recombinant)}, none of the 1638 evaluated participants reported any serious adverse events (ie require hospitalization or emergency room visit). Solicited adverse events reported via daily diary cards included pain (62.7%) and soreness (24.1%) at injection site as most common, whereas fever (48.4%), headache (43.4%), myalgia (38.4%), fatigue (33.4%), joint pain (27.0%) and nausea (16.0%) were most common solicited systemic adverse events on day 1. Majority of local and systemic adverse events were seen in first 2 days post vaccination and thereafter they resolved. Lesser reactogenicity was observed in subjects with age >50 years. No major difference was observed in adverse events when subjects were stratified based on history of COVID 19 disease or baseline seropositivity. In our study serostatus improved from 48.2% positive at baseline to 79.0% positive 2 weeks following first dose of vaccination. After first dose of vaccination overall higher percentage (98.2%) of seropositivity rates were observed in those with past history of COVID 19 disease Conclusion: The Covishield vaccine {ChAdOx1 nCoV- 19 Corona Virus Vaccine (Recombinant)}, was safe and reported mild self limiting adverse events over 2-4 days and had an good early (within 2 weeks) seroresponse .This holds the promise of far reaching impact on vaccine availability for a larger population and thereby providing a widespread coverage.","Kataria, S.; Sharma, P.; Deswal, V.; Kumar, K.; Singh, M.

The aim of the current study was to examine the prevalence of moral distress and its domains of influence, and to identify demographic and work-related characteristics associated with moral distress among OSWs. METHODS Data came from the Oncology Social Work Competencies, Opportunities, Roles, and Expertise survey, conducted from August to September 2020 (during the COVID-19 global pandemic). Data collected included demographic information (eg, age, sex, and race) and work-related characteristics (eg, job position, organization type, work setting, employment status, salary, years in the profession, and OSW-C certification). Moral distress was measured using the Measure of Moral Distress for Healthcare Professionals. Tests of association, including multivariate linear regression, were conducted to achieve the research aims. RESULTS Total moral distress scores on the Measure of Moral Distress for Healthcare Professionals (range 0-432) for 745 OSWs ranged from 1 to 273, with an average score of 74.0. The three highest indicators of moral distress were observed in the patient or family experience domain. Higher levels of moral distress were associated with younger age, being a direct service provider, provision of inpatient cancer care, and more years in the profession. CONCLUSION OSWs are experiencing moral distress. Institutional investments in professional education and support of OSWs are needed to mitigate and possibly prevent moral distress experienced by cancer care providers and thus ensure the delivery of quality psychosocial care for patients with cancer and their families.","Guan, Ting; Nelson, Krista; Otis-Green, Shirley; Rayton, Makeeta; Schapmire, Tara; Wiener, Lori; Zebrack, Brad",JCO oncology practice,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34252313/; https://doi.org/10.1200/op.21.00276,634

In these screenings, Fluoxetine inhibited SARS-CoV-2 at a concentration of 0.8{micro}g/ml significantly, and the EC50 was determined with 387ng/ml. Fluoxetine is a racemate consisting of both stereoisomers, while the S-form is the dominant serotonin reuptake inhibitor. We found that both isomers show similar activity on the virus. Fluoxetine treatment resulted in a decrease in viral protein expression. Furthermore, Fluoxetine inhibited neither Rabies virus, human respiratory syncytial virus replication nor the Human Herpesvirus 8 or Herpes simplex virus type 1 gene expression, indicating that it acts virus-specific.

Most of these infections are caused by viruses, but are generally treated with antibiotics. Inappropriate use of antibiotics favors the selection, growth and spread of resistant bacteria; these bacteria colonize the airways and affect the entire community. With the emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, respiratory infections have become more difficult to treat. Effective strategies are needed to restrict the use of antibiotics without harming children that truly need these drugs.

METHODS: a review of randomized and controlled studies about these conditions published in MEDLINE and SCIELO from 2000 to 2006. CONCLUSIONS: Given that most of these infections progress favorably without antibiotics, the use of these drugs should be avoided unless the child belongs to a high risk group for complications, or symptoms persist or worsen with despite symptomatic treatment.

656652,COVID–19 and police personnel: An exploratory community based study from South India,2021-02-27,"OBJECTIVES: To describe the relationship between reported serious operational problems (SOPs), and mortality for patients with COVID-19 admitted to intensive care units (ICUs). DESIGN: English national retrospective cohort study. SETTING: 89 English hospital trusts (i.e. small groups of hospitals functioning as single operational units). PATIENTS: All adults with COVID-19 admitted to ICU between 2nd April and 1st December, 2020 (n = 6,737). INTERVENTIONS: N/A MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Hospital trusts routinely submit declarations of whether they have experienced ‘serious operational problems’ in the last 24 hours (e.g. due to staffing issues, adverse weather conditions, etc.). Bayesian hierarchical models were used to estimate the association between in-hospital mortality (binary outcome) and: 1) an indicator for whether a SOP occurred on the date of a patient’s admission, and; 2) the proportion of the days in a patient’s stay that had a SOP occur within their trust. These models were adjusted for individual demographic characteristics (age, sex, ethnicity), and recorded comorbidities. RESULTS: Serious operational problems (SOPs) were common; reported in 47 trusts (52.8%) and were present for 2,701 (of 21,716; 12.4%) trust days. Overall mortality was 37.7% (2,539 deaths). Admission during a period of SOPs was associated with a substantially increased mortality; adjusted odds ratio (OR) 1.34 (95% posterior credible interval (PCI): 1.07 to 1.68). Mortality was also associated with the proportion of a patient’s admission duration that had concurrent SOPs; OR 1.47 (95% PCI: 1.10 to 1.96) for mortality where SOPs were present for 100% compared to 0% of the stay. CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: Serious operational problems at the trust-level are associated with a significant increase in mortality in patients with COVID-19 admitted to critical care. The link isn’t necessarily causal, but this observation justifies further research to determine if a binary indicator might be a valid prognostic marker for deteriorating quality of care.","Wilde, Harrison; Dennis, John M.; McGovern, Andrew P.; Vollmer, Sebastian J.; Mateen, Bilal A.",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0255377; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34324569/,634
657697,An interesting case of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis following E. coli infection,2019-01-11,"ABSTRACT: Porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV) causes severe diarrhoea in neonatal suckling piglets with a high mortality. Maternal vaccines that can induce lactogenic immunity to protect suckling piglets via colostrums and milk are pivotal for the prevention and control of PEDV infection in neonatal suckling piglets. In this study, a group of pregnant sows were first orally immunized with coated PEDV‐loaded microspheres and boosted with killed PEDV vaccines (heterologous prime‐boost). It has been detected that the levels of PEDV‐specific antibodies (IgG and IgA) in their sera and milks were higher than other negative groups (P < 0·001 or P < 0·05). Furthermore, it has been proved by the neutralization assay that the induced antibodies could significantly inhibit virus infection as compared to other negative groups (P < 0·01 or P < 0·05). Importantly, after PEDV challenge, more than 90% of the suckling piglets delivered by the sows in the heterologous prime‐boost group were completely protected. Overall, the results show that ‘heterologous prime‐boost’ form is an efficient and effective way to provide protection for suckling piglets against PEDV through lactogenic immunity. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: As a widespread swine pathogen, PEDV affects the swine industry enormously. It causes enteritis in swine of all ages and is often fatal in neonatal piglets. Our data show that pregnant sows were immunized with ‘coated PEDV‐loaded microspheres + killed PEDV vaccines’ (heterologous prime‐boost immunization) could protect more than 90% suckling piglets delivered by the sows against the virus. These findings provide a new model of developing safe and effective immunizations for newborn animals against established and emerging enteric infections.","Wen, Z.; Xu, Z.; Zhou, Q.; Li, W.; Wu, Y.; Du, Y.; Chen, L.; Xue, C.; Cao, Y.",Lett Appl Microbiol,https://doi.org/10.1111/lam.13197; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31278766/,634

Several public health interventions were applied to contain the infection. However, the pandemic itself and the lockdown measure negatively influence people's lifestyles and psychological health. Purpose: To explore determinants of healthy dietary intake and depression, and examine the interaction between healthy dietary intake and COVID-19 lockdown on depression. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted at 18 hospitals and health centers from February 14 to May 31, 2020. Data of 8,291 outpatients were collected including patients' characteristics, clinical parameters, health literacy, healthy dietary intake (using the healthy eating score, HES), other health-related behaviors, and depression (using the patient health questionnaire, PHQ). Depression was defined as PHQ score ≥ 10. Results: Protective factors of healthy dietary intake and depression were higher education, better medication payment ability, higher social status, more physical activity, and higher health literacy, whereas older age, ever married, own business or other types of occupation, lockdown, suspected COVID-19 symptoms, and comorbidity were associated with lower HES scores and a higher depression likelihood. Besides, overweight/obesity and alcohol drinking were associated with lower HES scores. As compared with patients not under lockdown and with lowest HES score, those who were under lockdown and with lowest HES score had 10.6 times higher depression likelihood (odds ratio, OR, 10.60; 95% CI 6.88, 16.32; p < 0.001), whereas people with higher HES score had 15% lower depression likelihood (OR 0.85; 95% CI 0.82, 0.89; p < 0.001). Conclusions: Healthy dietary intake and depression were determined by several sociodemographic, clinical, and behavioral factors. Lockdown measure affects people's dietary intake behavior and depression. Importantly, healthy dietary intake potentially modifies the negative effect of lockdown on depression.","Pham, Khue M.; Pham, Linh V.; Phan, Dung T.; Tran, Tien V.; Nguyen, Hoang C.; Nguyen, Minh H.; Nguyen, Huu C.; Ha, Tung H.; Dao, Hung K.; Nguyen, Phuoc B.; Trinh, Manh V.; Do, Thinh V.; Nguyen, Hung Q.; Nguyen, Thao T.

Although many variables are associated with development of NEC, only prematurity has been consistently identified in case-controlled studies. Traditionally, the diving seal reflex has been invoked as the mechanism responsible for ischaemic injury and necrosis. Intestinal ischaemia is likely to be the final common pathway in NEC; however, it is due to the release of vasoconstricting substances, such as platelet activating factor, rather than perinatal asphyxia. Bacteria and/or bacterial toxins are likely to have a key role in the pathogenesis of NEC by fostering production of inflammatory mediators. The role of feeding practices in the pathogenesis of NEC remains controversial. Treatment of infants with NEC generally includes a regimen of bowel rest, gastric decompression, systemic antibiotics and parenteral nutrition. Infants with perforation are generally operated upon; however, there has been recent interest in primary peritoneal drainage as an alternative. Prevention of NEC still remains elusive. Avoidance of preterm birth, use of antenatal steroids and breast-milk feeding are practices that offer the greatest potential benefits.

A major challenge is that the receptor-binding domain (RBD)-only vaccine fails to trigger long-lasting protective immunity if used alone for vaccination. To enhance antigen processing and cross-presentation in draining lymph nodes (DLNs), we developed an interferon (IFN)-armed RBD dimerized by an immunoglobulin fragment (I-R-F). I-R-F efficiently directs immunity against RBD to DLNs. A low dose of I-R-F induces not only high titers of long-lasting neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) but also more comprehensive T cell responses than RBD. Notably, I-R-F provides comprehensive protection in the form of a one-dose vaccine without an adjuvant. Our study shows that the pan-epitope modified human I-R-F (I-P-R-F) vaccine provides rapid and complete protection throughout the upper and lower respiratory tracts against a high-dose SARS-CoV-2 challenge in rhesus macaques. Based on these promising results, we have initiated a randomized, placebo-controlled, phase I/II trial of the human I-P-R-F vaccine (V-01) in 180 healthy adults, and the vaccine appears safe and elicits strong antiviral immune responses.

663913,(RE) currences in COVID-19: (RE)-activation or (RE)-infection?,2021-04-29,"BACKGROUND: A false-negative case of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is defined as a person with suspected infection and an initial negative result by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test, with a positive result on a subsequent test. False-negative cases have important implications for isolation and risk of transmission of infected people and for the management of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We aimed to review and critically appraise evidence about the rate of RT-PCR false-negatives at initial testing for COVID-19. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, as well as COVID-19 repositories, including the EPPI-Centre living systematic map of evidence about COVID-19 and the Coronavirus Open Access Project living evidence database. Two authors independently screened and selected studies according to the eligibility criteria and collected data from the included studies. The risk of bias was assessed using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) tool. We calculated the proportion of false-negative test results using a multilevel mixed-effect logistic regression model. The certainty of the evidence about false-negative cases was rated using the GRADE approach for tests and strategies. All information in this article is current up to July 17, 2020. RESULTS: We included 34 studies enrolling 12,057 COVID-19 confirmed cases. All studies were affected by several risks of bias and applicability concerns. The pooled estimate of false-negative proportion was highly affected by unexplained heterogeneity (tau-squared = 1.39; 90% prediction interval from 0.02 to 0.54). The certainty of the evidence was judged as very low due to the risk of bias, indirectness, and inconsistency issues. CONCLUSIONS: There is substantial and largely unexplained heterogeneity in the proportion of false-negative RT-PCR results. The collected evidence has several limitations, including risk of bias issues, high heterogeneity, and concerns about its applicability. Nonetheless, our findings reinforce the need for repeated testing in patients with suspicion of SARS-Cov-2 infection given that up to 54% of COVID-19 patients may have an initial false-negative RT-PCR (very low certainty of evidence).

In this single center case control study, we measured the rate of MDRB acquisition in patients admitted in COVID-19 ICU and compared it with patients admitted in the same ICU for subarachnoid hemorrhage (controls) matched 1:1 on length of ICU stay and mechanical ventilation. All patients were systematically and repeatedly screened for MDRB carriage. We compared the rate of MDRB acquisition in COVID-19 patients and in control using a competing risk analysis. Of note, although we tried to match COVID-19 patients with septic shock patients, we were unable due to the longer stay of COVID-19 patients. Among 72 patients admitted to the COVID-19 ICUs, 33% acquired 31 MDRB during ICU stay. The incidence density of MDRB acquisition was 30/1000 patient days. Antimicrobial therapy and exposure time were associated with higher rate of MDRB acquisition. Among the 72 SAH patients, 21% acquired MDRB, with an incidence density was 18/1000 patient days. The septic patients had more comorbidities and a greater number of previous hospitalizations than the COVID-19 patients. The incidence density of MDRB acquisition was 30/1000 patient days. The association between COVID-19 and MDRB acquisition (compared to control) risk did not reach statistical significance in the multivariable competing risk analysis (sHR 1.71 (CI 95% 0.93–3.21)). Thus, we conclude that, despite strong physical isolation, acquisition rate of MDRB in ICU patients was at least similar during the COVID-19 first wave compared to previous period.","Bogossian, Elisa G.; Taccone, Fabio S.; Izzi, Antonio; Yin, Nicolas; Garufi, Alessandra; Hublet, Stephane; Njimi, Hassane; Ego, Amedee; Gorham, Julie; Byl, Baudouin; Brasseur, Alexandre; Hites, Maya; Vincent, Jean-Louis; Creteur, Jacques; Grimaldi, David",Microorganisms,https://doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms8111821; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33227956/,634

Within this framework, a flexible algorithmic approach selects a set of turning points for each state, computes distances between them, and determines whether each state is in (or over) a first or second surge. Then, appropriate distances between normalized time series are used to further analyze the relationships between case trajectories on a month-by-month basis. Our algorithm shows that 31 states are experiencing second surges, while four of the 10 largest states are still in their first surge, with case counts that have never decreased. This analysis can aid in highlighting the most and least successful state responses to COVID-19.","James, Nick; Menzies, Max",Chaos,https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0024204; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33003920/,634

This study aimed to describe the features and outcomes of pregnant women with or without SARS-CoV-2 infection after the universal screening was established in a large tertiary care center admitting only obstetric related conditions without severe COVID-19 in Mexico City. This retrospective case-control study integrates data between April 22 and May 25, 2020, during active community transmission in Mexico, with one of the highest COVID-19 test positivity percentages worldwide. Only pregnant women and neonates with a SARS-CoV-2 result by quantitative RT-PCR were included in this study. Among 240 pregnant women, the prevalence of COVID-19 was 29% (95% CI, 24% to 35%); 86% of the patients were asymptomatic (95% CI, 76%-92%), nine women presented mild symptoms, and one patient moderate disease. No pregnancy baseline features or risk factors associated with severity of infection, including maternal age > 35 years, Body Mass Index >30 kg/m(2), and pre-existing diseases, differed between positive and negative women. The median gestational age at admission for both groups was 38 weeks. All women were discharged at home without complications, and no maternal death was reported. The proportion of preeclampsia was higher in positive women than negative women (18%, 95% CI, 10%-29% vs. 9%, 95% CI, 5%-14%, P<0.05). No differences were found for other perinatal outcomes. SARS-CoV-2 test result was positive for nine infants of positive mothers detected within 24h of birth. An increased number of infected neonates were admitted to the NICU, compared to negative neonates (44% vs. 22%, P<0.05) and had a longer length of hospitalization (2 [2–18] days vs. 2 [2–3] days, P<0.001); these are potential proxies for illness severity.

The National Strategy on Suicide Prevention, coordinated by the public-private Action Alliance, was most recently updated in 2012. In early 2021, the Surgeon General's office released a Call to Action to fully implement the national strategy. Six core types of actions to prevent suicide include adopting a broad public health approach, addressing upstream factors including social determinants of health, reducing access to multiple forms of lethal means, adopting evidence-based care for persons at risk, enhancing crisis care and care transitions, and improving the quality and use of suicide-related data. From 1999 through 2018, suicide rates in the U.S. increased by approximately one-third, and suicide had become the tenth leading cause of death. While most recent national data indicate a small reduction in the suicide rate, decreases were not seen across all demographic groups. Population groups which may require special emphasis or outreach efforts include adolescents, working age adults, military veterans, and American Indians/Alaskan Natives. Increases in social isolation, mental distress, and economic hardship during the COVID-19 pandemic indicate clear needs to address the full spectrum of suicidal behavior.

Although most studies on protein folding have been conducted in vitro, providing valuable insights, studies on protein folding in crowded intracellular environments are scarce. This study aimed to explore the effects of intracellular molecular crowding on the folding of mutant transactivator HIV-1 Tat based on intracellular interactions, including TAR RNA, as proof of the previously reported chaperna-RNA concept. Considering that the Tat–TAR RNA motif binds RNA, we assessed the po tential function of TAR RNA as a chaperna for the refolding of R52Tat, a mutant in which the argi nine (R) residues at R52 have been replaced with alanine (A) by site-directed mutagenesis. We mon itored Tat-EGFP and Tat folding in HeLa cells via time-lapse fluorescence microscopy and biolayer interferometry using EGFP fusion as an indicator for folding status. These results show that the refolding of R52A Tat was stimulated well at a 0.3 μM TAR RNA concentration; wild-type Tat refolding was essentially abolished because of a reduction in the affinity for TAR RNA at that con centration. The folding and refolding of R52Tat were mainly promoted upon stimulation with TAR RNA. Our findings provide novel insights into the therapeutic potential of chaperna-mediated fold ing through the examination of as-yet-unexplored RNA-mediated protein folding as well as viral genetic variants that modulate viral evolutionary linkages for viral diseases inside a crowded intra cellular environment.","Kim, Jung Min; Chun, Honggu",Int J Mol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34576162/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms22189998,634

Accordingly, the use of prescription opioids (PO) in Canada increased drastically between 2005 and 2014, only starting to decrease in 2015. Both pain and PO use have serious public health repercussions, disproporionately affecting select socially disadvantaged populations. Food insecurity is a strong risk factor for mental disorders and suicidal outcomes, yet its relationship to chronic pain and PO use is largely unknown. Using two recent cycles from the population representative Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS), we examined the association of household food insecurity status with chronic pain and PO use among Canadians 12 years and older, adjusting for health and sociodemographic characteristics. Compared to food-secure individuals, marginally, moderately, and severely food-insecure individuals had 1.31 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.15–1.48), 1.89 (95% CI 1.71–2.08), and 3.29 (95% CI 2.90–3.74) times higher odds of experiencing chronic pain and 1.55 (95% CI 1.30–1.85), 1.77 (95% CI 1.54–2.04), and 2.65 (95% CI 2.27–3.09) times higher odds of using PO in the past year, respectively. The graded association with food insecurity severity was also found in severe pain experience and pain-induced activity limitations among chronic pain patients and, less consistently, in intensive, excess, and alternative use of PO and its acquisition through means other than medical prescription among past-year PO users. Food insecurity was a much more powerful predictor of chronic pain and PO use than other well-established social determinants of health like income and education. Policies reducing food insecurity may lower incidence of chronic pain and help contain the opioid crisis.","Men, Fei; Fischer, Benedikt; Urquia, Marcelo L.; Tarasuk, Valerie",SSM Popul Health,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssmph.2021.100768; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33763516/,634

However, little is known on porcine IFIT2 (pIFIT2). Here, we performed molecular cloning, expression profile, and transcriptional regulation analysis of pIFIT2. pIFIT2 gene, located on chromosome 14, is composed of two exons and have a complete coding sequence of 1407 bp. The encoded polypeptide, 468 aa in length, has three tetratricopeptide repeat motifs. pIFIT2 gene was unevenly distributed in all eleven tissues studied with the most abundance in spleen. Poly(I:C) treatment notably strongly upregulated the mRNA level and promoter activity of pIFIT2 gene. Upstream sequence of 1759 bp from the start codon which was assigned +1 here has promoter activity, and deltaEF1 acts as transcription repressor through binding to sequences at position − 1774 to − 1764. Minimal promoter region exists within nucleotide position − 162 and − 126. Two adjacent interferon-stimulated response elements (ISREs) and two nuclear factor (NF)-κB binding sites were identified within position − 310 and − 126. The ISRE elements act alone and in synergy with the one closer to start codon having more strength, so do the NF-κB binding sites. Synergistic effect was also found between the ISRE and NF-κB binding sites. Additionally, a third ISRE element was identified within position − 1661 to − 1579.

Cas13a and Cas12a enzymes bound to CRISPR RNA (crRNA) recognize specific nucleic acid targets, initiating cleavage of the targets as well as non-target (trans) nucleic acids. Here, we examine the kinetics of single-turnover target and multi-turnover trans-nuclease activities of both enzymes. High-turnover, non-specific Cas13a trans-RNase activity is coupled to rapid binding of target RNA. By contrast, low-turnover Cas12a trans-nuclease activity is coupled to relatively slow cleavage of target DNA, selective for DNA over RNA, indifferent to base identity, and preferential for single-stranded substrates. Combining multiple crRNA increases detection sensitivity of targets, an approach we use to quantify pathogen DNA in samples from patients suspected of Buruli ulcer disease. Results reveal that these enzymes are kinetically adapted to play distinct roles in bacterial adaptive immunity and show how kinetic analysis can be applied to CRISPR-based diagnostics.","Nalefski, Eric A.; Patel, Nidhi; Leung, Philip J.Y.; Islam, Zeba; Kooistra, Remy M.; Parikh, Ishira; Marion, Estelle; Knott, Gavin J.; Doudna, Jennifer A.; Le Ny, Anne-Laure M.; Madan, Damian",iScience,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34505008/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.isci.2021.102996,634

Two more hCoV outbreaks have since occurred, the most recent being SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The clinical presentation of SARS and MERS is remarkably similar to COVID-19, with hyperinflammation causing a severe form of the disease in some patients. Previous studies show that the expression of the SARS-CoV E protein is associated with the hyperinflammatory response that could culminate in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), a potentially fatal complication. This immune-mediated damage is largely caused by a cytokine storm, which is induced by significantly elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-6, which are partly mediated by the expression of the SARS-CoV E protein. The interaction between the SARS-CoV E protein and the host protein, syntenin, as well as the viroporin function of SARS-CoV E, are linked to this cytokine dysregulation. This review aims to compare the clinical presentation of virulent hCoVs with a specific focus on the cause of the immunopathology. The review also proposes that inhibition of IL-1β and IL-6 in severe cases can improve patient outcome.","Schoeman, Dewald; Fielding, Burtram C.",Front Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33013759/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2020.02086,634

Although all populations are at risk of pneumonia, those at extremes of age and those with immunosuppressive disorders, underlying respiratory disease, and critical illness are particularly vulnerable. Although clinical practice guidelines addressing the management and treatment of pneumonia exist, few of the supporting studies focus on the crucial contributions of the host in pneumonia pathogenesis and recovery. Such essential considerations include the host risk factors that lead to susceptibility to lung infections; biomarkers reflecting the host response and the means to pursue host-directed pneumonia therapy; systemic effects of pneumonia on the host; and long-term health outcomes after pneumonia. To address these gaps, the Pneumonia Working Group of the Assembly on Pulmonary Infection and Tuberculosis led a workshop held at the American Thoracic Society meeting in May 2018 with overarching objectives to foster attention, stimulate research, and promote funding for short-term and long-term investigations into the host contributions to pneumonia. The workshop involved participants from various disciplines with expertise in lung infection, pneumonia, sepsis, immunocompromised patients, translational biology, data science, genomics, systems biology, and clinical trials. This workshop report summarizes the presentations and discussions and important recommendations for future clinical pneumonia studies. These recommendations include establishing consensus disease and outcome definitions, improved phenotyping, development of clinical study networks, standardized data and biospecimen collection and protocols, and development of innovative trial designs.","Dela Cruz, Charles S.; Evans, Scott E.; Restrepo, Marcos I.; Dean, Nathan; Torres, Antonio; Amara-Elori, Isabel; Awasthi, Shanjana; Caler, Elisabet; Cao, Bin; Chalmers, James D.; Chastre, Jean; Cohen, Taylor S.; Cohen, Alan H.; Crothers, Kristina; Di, Y.

The absence of specific treatment neither against SARS‐CoV‐2 nor against acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), the most serious stage of this infection, has emphasized the need to find alternative treatments. Several therapeutics are currently tested and among them, mesenchymal stromal cells. These cells, already used in preclinical models of ARDS, sepsis, and septic shock and also in few clinical trials appear well‐tolerated, promising, but many questions remain unanswered.","Laroye, Caroline; Gibot, Sébastien; Huselstein, Céline; Bensoussan, Danièle",Stem Cells Transl Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32808462/; https://doi.org/10.1002/sctm.20-0239,634

689255,Pragmatic Recommendations for the Management of Acute Respiratory Failure and Mechanical Ventilation in Patients with COVID-19 in Low- and Middle-Income Countries,2021-01-13,"PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to investigate anatomic and morphologic features of inner and outer retinal layers in patients recovered from COVID-19 with Spectral Domain Optical Coherence Tomography (SD-OCT), whether correlate with any symptoms during disease process. METHODS: 32 patients recovered from COVID-19 and age- and gender-matched 36 healthy controls were included in this cross-sectional study. Ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer, macular and peripapiller retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL), inner nuclear layer (INL), outer nuclear layer (ONL), outer plexiform layer (OPL) and the outer retinal hyperreflective bands including external limiting membrane (ELM), ellipsoid zone (EZ) and interdigitation zone (IZ) were examined with SD-OCT. The differences of each retinal layers thickness among subgroup analysis of ocular pain and headache were also compared. RESULTS: Macular RNFL of inner and outer nasal and outer inferior quadrants were thinner in COVID-19 patients compared to healthy control group (p = 0.046, p = 0.014 and p = 0.016, respectively). Thinning in outer superior quadrant of GCIPL and INL quadrants were detected in patients with headache (p = 0.026 and p = 0.01). Superonasal and inferotemporal sectors of pRNFL were thinner in patients with ocular pain compared to patients without ocular pain (p = 0.024 and p = 0.015). Integrity of EZ, ELM and IZ was evaluated as continuous line and protected on each OCT scans. CONCLUSION: The study demonstrated convincing evidence that SARS-CoV-2 can affect the inner and outer retinal layers, with subclinical localized alterations, particularly in patients with headache and ocular pain symptoms during COVID-19 period.

A web-based questionnaire including 28 items was completed by 494 adults (age 31.5 ± 12.4 years). Half of the participants (49.8%) reported good, 44.1% moderate, and 6.1% bad quality of sleep, whereas 17.2% answered that the quality of sleep improved, 56.5% did not change, and 26.3% worsened compared to a normal week. Compared to normal, sleep duration in lockdown increased by 0.24 h (95% CI; 0.13, 0.35; p < 0.001, d = 0.198). More under-weight (32.4%) and obese (34.1%) respondents reported worsened quality of sleep in lockdown compared with normal (25.6%) and overweight participants (22.7%) (p = 0.006, Cramer’s φ = 0.191). A small effect for BMI group on sleep duration was observed (p = 0.011, η(2) = 0.023), where overweight and obese slept less (–0.44 h and –0.66 h, respectively) than normal weight participants. Subjects with the highest percentage of increased food consumption reported decreased sleep duration (p = 0.012) and worsened sleep quality (p = 0.003). Compared with a normal week, physical activity of a high and moderate intensity decreased for 43.0% and 37.0% of participants, did not change in 32.9% and 36.1% of participants, and increased in 24.1% 26.9%, respectively, whereas walking time decreased in 31.3%, did not change in 27.3%, and increased in 41.5% of participants. Increased high and moderate intensity physical activity was related with an improvement in sleep quality (p < 0.001). Those with decreasing walking time reported the highest percentage of decreased sleep quality (p = 0.006) and worsened sleep quality (p = 0.016). In conclusion, both quality and quantity of sleep were impaired during the second lockdown and the observed changes were associated with diet and physical activity.","Papazisis, Zisis; Nikolaidis, Pantelis T.; Trakada, Georgia",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34299743/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18147292,634
