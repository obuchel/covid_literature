70050,Development of the Nurses' Occupational Stressor Scale.,2020-01-19,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW The first guidelines on community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) were published in 1993, but since then many of the challenges regarding the outpatient management of CAP persist. These include the difficulty in establishing the initial clinical diagnosis, its risk stratification, which will dictate the place of treatment, the empirical choice of antibiotics, the relative scarcity of novel antibiotics and the importance of knowing local microbiological susceptibility patterns. RECENT FINDINGS New molecular biology methods have changed the etiologic perspective of CAP, especially the contribution of virus. Lung ultrasound and biomarkers might aid diagnosis and severity stratification in the outpatient setting. Antibiotic resistance is a growing problem that reinforces the importance of novel antibiotics. And finally, prevention and the use of anti-pneumococcal vaccine are instrumental in reducing the burden of disease. SUMMARY Most of CAP cases are managed in the community; however, most research comes from hospitalized severe patients. New and awaited advances might contribute to aid diagnosis, cause and assessment of patients with CAP in the community. This knowledge might prove decisive in the execution of stewardship programmes that maintain current antibiotics, safeguard future ones and reinforce prevention.","Froes, Filipe; Pereira, João Gonçalves; Póvoa, Pedro",Current opinion in infectious diseases,https://doi.org/10.1097/qco.0000000000000435; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29373381/,884

76687,Examination of the Therapeutic Potential of Mouse Oral Mucosa Stem Cells in a Wound-Healing Diabetic Mice Model.,2020-07-06,"OBJECTIVE To describe the ocular manifestations in a case of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). MATERIAL AND METHODS A case of unilateral panuveitis and optic neuritis as initial presentation of COVID-19. RESULTS As it is published, angiotensin-converting-enzyme-2 receptors can be found in many organs, such as the eyes, nerves, and vessels, so extrapulmonary involvement would be expected. According to current evidence and clinical characteristics of the patient, uveitis and optic neuritis could be produced by the virus. CONCLUSIONS It is fundamental to consider panuveitis and optic neuritis as an unusual presentation of ocular involvement in COVID-19 so proper care can be given to the patients.","Benito-Pascual, Blanca; Gegúndez, José A; Díaz-Valle, David; Arriola-Villalobos, Pedro; Carreño, Ester; Culebras, Esther; Rodríguez-Avial, Iciar; Benitez-Del-Castillo, Jose M",Ocular immunology and inflammation,https://doi.org/10.1080/09273948.2020.1792512; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32870739/,884
83583,Bioimpedance Vector Patterns Changes in Response to Swimming Training: An Ecological Approach.,2020-07-06,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES The Canagliflozin and Renal Events in Diabetes with Established Nephropathy Clinical Evaluation (CREDENCE) trial demonstrated that the sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor canagliflozin reduced the risk of kidney failure and cardiovascular events in participants with type 2 diabetes mellitus and CKD. Little is known about the use of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with eGFR <30 ml/min per 1.73 m2. The participants in the CREDENCE study had type 2 diabetes mellitus, a urinary albumin-creatinine ratio >300-5000 mg/g, and an eGFR of 30 to <90 ml/min per 1.73 m2 at screening. This post hoc analysis evaluated participants with eGFR <30 ml/min per 1.73 m2 at randomization. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS Effects of eGFR slope through week 130 were analyzed using a piecewise, linear, mixed-effects model. Efficacy was analyzed in the intention-to-treat population, on the basis of Cox proportional hazard models, and safety was analyzed in the on-treatment population. At randomization (an average of 29 days after screening), 174 of 4401 (4%) participants had an eGFR <30 ml/min per 1.73 m2 (mean [SD] eGFR, 26 [3] ml/min per 1.73 m2). RESULTS From weeks 3 to 130, there was a 66% difference in the mean rate of eGFR decline with canagliflozin versus placebo (mean slopes, -1.30 versus -3.83 ml/min per 1.73 m2 per year; difference, -2.54 ml/min per 1.73 m2 per year; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.90 to 4.17). Effects of canagliflozin on kidney, cardiovascular, and mortality outcomes were consistent for those with eGFR <30 and ≥30 ml/min per 1.73 m2 (all P interaction >0.20). The estimate for kidney failure in participants with eGFR <30 ml/min per 1.73 m2 (hazard ratio, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.35 to 1.27) was similar to those with eGFR ≥30 ml/min per 1.73 m2 (hazard ratio, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.54 to 0.91; P interaction=0.80). There was no imbalance in the rate of kidney-related adverse events or AKI associated with canagliflozin between participants with eGFR <30 and ≥30 ml/min per 1.73 m2 (all P interaction >0.12). CONCLUSIONS This post hoc analysis suggests canagliflozin slowed progression of kidney disease, without increasing AKI, even in participants with eGFR <30 ml/min per 1.73 m2.","Bakris, George; Oshima, Megumi; Mahaffey, Kenneth W; Agarwal, Rajiv; Cannon, Christopher P; Capuano, George; Charytan, David M; de Zeeuw, Dick; Edwards, Robert; Greene, Tom; Heerspink, Hiddo J L; Levin, Adeera; Neal, Bruce; Oh, Richard; Pollock, Carol; Rosenthal, Norman; Wheeler, David C; Zhang, Hong; Zinman, Bernard; Jardine, Meg J; Perkovic, Vlado",Clinical journal of the American Society of Nephrology : CJASN,https://doi.org/10.2215/cjn.10140620; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33214158/,884

95372,Japan's Dental Care Facing Population Aging: How Universal Coverage Responds to the Changing Needs of the Elderly.,2021-09-04,"Background: Each year, 600,000 children under 5 years old die from vaccine-preventable diseases globally. Immunization is an effective way to prevent many diseases, saving two to three million lives per year. The Nepal National Government recommends vaccinations for all children for 11 diseases by 15 months of age. However, only 78% of children between 1-2 years of age have received all recommended vaccines and only 43% receive them at the age-appropriate times for which they are scheduled. Objectives: This protocol describes the development of an intervention - called ""Rejoice Architecture"" - that is informed by three theoretical perspectives: choice architecture, the broken windows theory, and the theory of normative social behavior. We also describe a mixed-methods approach to develop the intervention, which will improve the physical and social environments of health facilities in Makwanpur, Nepal. We hypothesize this intervention will improve immunization behaviors and intentions among mothers of children younger than 2 years, pregnant women, and prospective mothers. Methods: We describe the qualitative formative assessment to understand existing attitudes, norms, and behaviors among caregivers, healthcare workers, and government representatives. The formative assessment will include in-depth interviews, key informant interviews, and focus group discussions. We also describe the overall quasi-experimental study design, used to assess intervention impact. Impact: This study will contribute to the social and behavioral change communication intervention research by offering a novel strategy for increasing immunization. This study will also illustrate to policymakers the value of structural change for health service delivery.","Paul, Alicia; Upreti, Kamana; Nepal, Shraddha; Lohani, Jeevan; Adhikari, Kriti; Rimal, Rajiv",Gates open research,https://doi.org/10.12688/gatesopenres.13168.2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33870101/,884
97749,A Complementary Intervention to Promote Wellbeing and Stress Management for Early Career Teachers.,2021-06-11,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused a pandemic since early 2020. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has already caused more than two million deaths worldwide and affected people's physical and mental health. COVID-19 patients with mild symptoms are generally required to self-isolate and monitor for symptoms at least for 14 days in the case the disease turns towards severe complications. Here, we overviewed the impact of COVID-19 on the patients' general health with a focus on their cardiovascular, respiratory and mental health, and investigated several existing patient monitoring systems. We addressed the limitations of these systems and proposed a wearable telehealth solution for monitoring a set of physiological parameters that are critical for COVID-19 patients such as body temperature, heart rate, heart rate variability, blood oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, blood pressure, and cough. This physiological information can be further combined to potentially estimate the lung function using artificial intelligence (AI) and sensor fusion techniques. The prototype, which includes the hardware and a smartphone app, showed promising results with performance comparable to or better than similar commercial devices, thus potentially making the proposed system an ideal wearable solution for long-term monitoring of COVID-19 patients and other chronic diseases.","Jiang, Wei; Majumder, Sumit; Subramaniam, Sophini; Li, Xiaohe; Khedri, Ridha; Monday, Tapas; Abolghasemian, Mansour; Satia, Imran; Deen, M Jamal",IEEE reviews in biomedical engineering,https://doi.org/10.1109/rbme.2021.3069815; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33784625/,884

In this study, Au@Ag nanorods (Au@AgNRs) were successfully synthesized by coating AuNRs with silver and were shown for the first time to have activity against the replication of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV). Viral titer analysis demonstrated that Au@AgNRs could inhibit PEDV infection by 4 orders of magnitude at 12 h post-infection, which was verified by viral protein expression analysis. The potential mechanism of action showed that Au@AgNRs could inhibit the entry of PEDV and decrease the mitochondrial membrane potential and caspase-3 activity. Additionally, we demonstrated that a large amount of virus proliferation can cause the generation of reactive oxygen species in cells, and the released Ag+ and exposed AuNRs by Au@AgNRs after the stimulation of reactive oxygen species has superior antiviral activity to ensure long-term inhibition of the PEDV replication cycle. The integrated results support that Au@AgNRs can serve as a potential therapeutic strategy to prevent the replication of coronavirus.","Du, Ting; Zhang, Jinyu; Li, Chunqiao; Song, Tao; Li, Ping; Liu, Jifeng; Du, Xinjun; Wang, Shuo",Bioconjugate chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.bioconjchem.0c00506; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33073571/,884

In the context of preparedness through waste management, this study estimated the rate and quantity of generation and the composition of COVID-19 waste in Vietnam from the supply of resources and equipment. Over a year under COVID, 1486 t of COVID-19 waste was produced from the treatment of isolated COVID-19 patients (4.64 kg bed-1 day-1), quarantine in medical facilities (3.86 kg bed-1 day-1), centralised quarantine (46.43 g bed-1 day-1), testing (50 g test-1) and vaccination (10.46 g shot-1). Plastic dominated the waste at 76.7%, followed by paper. The additional management of waste from households with persons under quarantine is likely to reduce infection caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) - contaminated waste.

126293,Inhibiting the Physiological Stress Effects of a Sustained Attention Task on Shoulder Muscle Activity.,2018,"BACKGROUND Delirium is common in palliative care settings and is distressing for patients, their families and clinicians. To develop effective interventions, we need first to understand current delirium care in this setting. AIM To understand patient, family, clinicians' and volunteers' experience of delirium and its care in palliative care contexts. DESIGN Qualitative systematic review and thematic synthesis (PROSPERO 2018 CRD42018102417). DATA SOURCES The following databases were searched: CINAHL, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, Embase, MEDLINE and PsycINFO (2000-2020) for qualitative studies exploring experiences of delirium or its care in specialist palliative care services. Study selection and quality appraisal were independently conducted by two reviewers. RESULTS A total of 21 papers describing 16 studies were included. In quality appraisal, trustworthiness (rigour of methods used) was assessed as high (n = 5), medium (n = 8) or low (n = 3). Three major themes were identified: interpretations of delirium and their influence on care; clinicians' responses to the suffering of patients with delirium and the roles of the family in delirium care. Nursing staff and other clinicians had limited understanding of delirium as a medical condition with potentially modifiable causes. Practice focused on alleviating patient suffering through person-centred approaches, which could be challenging with delirious patients, and medication use. Treatment decisions were also influenced by the distress of family and clinicians and resource limitations. Family played vital roles in delirium care. CONCLUSIONS Increased understanding of non-pharmacological approaches to delirium prevention and management, as well as support for clinicians and families, are important to enable patients' multi-dimensional needs to be met.","Featherstone, Imogen; Hosie, Annmarie; Siddiqi, Najma; Grassau, Pamela; Bush, Shirley H; Taylor, Johanna; Sheldon, Trevor; Johnson, Miriam J",Palliative medicine,https://doi.org/10.1177/02692163211006313; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33784915/,884
135372,People's Response to Potential Natural Hazard-Triggered Technological Threats after a Sudden-Onset Earthquake in Indonesia.,2021-03-24,"Multilayered and stacked cellulose paper has emerged as a promising platform for construction of three-dimensional (3D) cell culture due to its low cost, good biocompatibility and high porosity. However, its poor light transmission makes it challenging to directly and clearly monitor cell behaviors (e.g., growth and proliferation) on the paper-based platform using optical microscope. In this work, we developed a transparent microcrystalline cellulose/polyvinyl alcohol (MCC/PVA) paper with irregular pores through dissolution and regeneration of microcrystalline nanocellulose (MCC), addition of porogen reagent (NaCl) and subsequently dipping in PVA solutions. The transparent MCC paper displays high porosity (up to 90%), adjustable pore size (between 23 μm and 46 μm) and large thickness (from 315 μm to 436 μm) and high light transmission under water (>95%). Through further modification of transparent MCC paper with PVA, the obtained transparent MCC/PVA paper shows enhanced mechanical properties (dry and wet strengths), good hydrophilicity (with a contact angle of 70.8°) and improved biocompatibility (cell viability up to 90%). By stacking and destacking multiple layers of the transparent MCC/PVA paper, it has been used for both 2D and 3D cell culture platforms. The transparent MCC/PVA paper under water enables both direct observation of cell morphology by optical microscope via naked eyes and fluorescence microscope after staining. We envision that the developed transparent MCC/PVA paper holds great potential for future applications in various bioanalytical and biomedical fields, such as drug screening, tissue engineering and organ-on-chips.","Tang, Ruihua; Liu, Li Na; Li, Min; Yao, Xue; Yang, Yaowei; Zhang, Sufeng; Li, Fei",Analytical chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.0c03458; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32962346/,884

147292,A Qualitative Examination of Water Access and Related Coping Behaviors to Understand Its Link to Food Insecurity among Rural Households in the West Region in Cameroon.,2020-07-06,"Pancreatic cancer will gradually become the second leading cause of cancer death due to its poor suitability for surgical treatment, frequent recurrence and metastasis, and insensitivity to radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Strategies for precise early detection and effective targeted treatment of pancreatic cancer are urgently needed. Because of its unique advantages, molecular targeted contrast-enhanced ultrasound imaging (CEUI) has generated new opportunities to overcome this challenge. The aim of this study was to explore multifunctional nanobubbles named IR780-NBs-DTX as novel ultrasound contrast agents (UCAs) for dual-mode targeted imaging and photothermal ablation combined with chemotherapy for pancreatic cancer. An optimized ""film hydration method"" was used to prepare IR780-NBs-DTX in this research. The characteristics and ability of the new UCAs were detected via in vitro, in vivo and ex vivo experiments. The initial dose of 0.15 mg IR-780 iodide/1.0 mg DTX was considered to be the best formula for IR780-NBs-DTX, and the concentration of 6 ×106 bubbles/mL was best for CEUI. The excellent characteristics of IR780-NBs-DTX, including a uniform nanoscale particle size (349.8± 159.1 nm, n= 3), good performance in dual-mode imaging, high stability and reliable biocompatibility, were also proven. In the in vitro cell experiments, IR780-NBs-DTX targeted more pancreatic cancer cells than the control treatments, and the targeting rate was approximately 95.6± 1.7%. Under irradiation with an 808 nm laser, most cells died. Furthermore, the in vivo study demonstrated that IR780-NBs-DTX could precisely detect pancreatic cancer through near infrared fluorescence (NIRF) imaging and CEUI, and the tumor almost disappeared at 18 days after combined treatment. In ex vivo experiments, immunohistochemistry (IHC) and immunofluorescence (IF) showed that the expression of HSP70 increased and that of PCNA decreased, and many apoptotic tumor cells were observed by TUNEL staining in the IR780-NBs-DTX group. The newly prepared IR780-NBs-DTX are novel nanosized UCAs with high efficiency for dual-mode molecular targeted imaging and combined therapy, and they may have future potential applications in the precise detection and effective targeted therapy of small and metastatic lesions in the early stage of pancreatic cancer.","Yang, Hengli; Zhao, Ping; Zhou, Yonggang; Li, Qiaoying; Cai, Wenbin; Zhao, Zongxia; Shen, Jian; Yao, Kechun; Duan, Yunyou",Scientific reports,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-82602-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33737559/,884

156722,The Use of Middle Latency Auditory Evoked Potentials (MLAEP) as Methodology for Evaluating Sedation Level in Propofol-Drug Induced Sleep Endoscopy (DISE) Procedure.,2021-02-20,"BACKGROUND Cyst excision with hepaticojejunostomy is the treatment of choice for choledochal cyst. However, late complications after definitive surgery develop occasionally, including intrahepatic stones and cholangitis, because of bile stasis resulting from anastomotic stricture, intrahepatic bile duct stricture, and remnants of intrahepatic ductal dilatation. In type IV-A choledochal cysts in particular, biliary stricture is frequently observed around the hepatic hilum, and ductoplasty for stricture is necessary. In this article, we present our experiences with totally laparoscopic surgery comprising excision of the extrahepatic bile duct, Roux-en-Y jejunojejunostomy, and wide hepaticojejunostomy combined with hilar ductoplasty for choledochal cyst. METHODS We performed totally laparoscopic surgery on 8 children with choledochal cyst between June 2009 and October 2010. One of them had undergone bile drainage through gallbladder laparoscopically for biliary perforation. Four patients (1 Ic and 3 IV-A cysts) had hepatic duct stricture around the hepatic hilum. Laparoscopic surgery comprising excision of the extrahepatic bile duct and wide Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy with ductoplasty was performed by using four trocars. RESULTS The operation was completed laparoscopically for all patients. The mean operation time was 390 minutes (range, 310-460). The mean postoperative stay was 8.4 days (range, 7-14). After surgery, the dilatation of the intrahepatic bile duct was remarkably reduced in size, and all patients are doing well. CONCLUSION Laparoscopic surgery comprising excision of the extrahepatic bile duct, Roux-en-Y limb formation, and wide hepaticojejunostomy with hilar ductoplasty appears to be feasible for children with choledochal cyst.

CEEPC was founded to promote the 'power of proteomics' and has diligently propagated its Conferences with immense success. It was also the first to promote societal, humanitarian as well as global medical issues in parallel, both on its website and at Conferences, including Malaria, Ebola, Zika, and Coronaviruses. CEEPC has nurtured 'cutting-edge' research and multifaceted proteomics which is pivotal in everyday medicine including emerging viral challenges of today needing deeper understanding of viral proteomics. Proteins can undergo post-translational modifications, enzymatic cleavage and activation or destruction by proteolytic events. Such changes to proteins could be key to understanding disease onset or response to therapy. This is where proteomics plays a major role to decipher and characterize diseases. CEEPC's mission remains to contribute to all approaches of proteomics including 'novel enabling technologies' to study diverse molecular processes or identify structural differences in proteins introduced by mutations, structural variations, modifications or protein truncation in disease.

A PEDV outbreak was observed in March 2008 in a swine herd in Thailand. The disease was diagnosed by clinical symptoms, gross and histopathology and viral detection using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assay. The intestines of the infected piglets were collected, minced and fed to all of the gilts and sows within 2 weeks after the onset of the PEDV outbreak. Reproductive data were collected during a period from January 2007 to July 2008 and were retrospectively evaluated. The farrowing rate (FR), return rate (RR), abortion rate (AR), number of total piglets born per litter (TB), number of piglets born alive per litter (BA), percentage of stillbirth piglets per litter (SB), percentage of mummified fetus per litter (MM) and piglet's birth weight (BW), before and after the PEDV outbreak were compared. It was found that the impact of PEDV infection on the reproductive performance of gilts and sows depended on the period of pregnancy when the females were exposed to the pathogen, and parity number. The pregnant females infected with PEDV during the first 30 days of pregnancy had a 12.6 percentage point decrease of FR (91.1% vs. 78.5%, P=0.003), a 5.7 percentage point increase of RR (3.5% vs. 9.2%, P=0.01), a 1.3 percentage point increase of AR (2.1% vs. 3.4%, P=0.01) and a 2.0 percentage point increase of MM (3.5% vs. 5.6%, P<0.001). SB increased in the pregnant females that were infected with PEDV during 91-120 days of pregnancy (1.8 percentage points, 4.5% vs. 6.2%, P=0.01). The impacts of PEDV infection on subsequent reproductive performance were more severe in the pregnant gilts than the pregnant sows. PEDV infection during the first 30 days of pregnancy resulted in a decrease of TB by 1.4 (11.7 vs. 10.3 piglets/litter, P<0.001) and a decrease of BA by 2.2 (10.7 vs. 8.5 piglets/litter, P<0.001) in the gilts' litters, while the influence of PEDV infection on TB and BA was not significant in sows (P>0.05). It was concluded that natural infection of PEDV in the pregnant gilts and sows caused a reduction of subsequent reproductive performance.","Olanratmanee, Em-On; Kunavongkrit, Annop; Tummaruk, Padet",Animal reproduction science,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.anireprosci.2010.07.004; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20727693/,884

211961,Blockchain in Healthcare: Insights on COVID-19,2020,"Recent updates in the diagnosis and management of chronic inflammatory conditions can be brought together to better understand autoimmune diseases (ADs). With organ-specific or organ-limited and systemic ADs, physicians often are faced with a dilemma when making a diagnosis and may feel a kind of embarrassment when a more distinct nosological entity cannot be found. ADs often overlap with other diseases and good diagnostic procedures for ADs only become evidence-based when refined histopathologic, immunopathologic, and general laboratory analyses are available. Immunofluorescence analyses, Western blotting, CUT & RUN technology allow localization of the site of autoantibody-reactivity on the relevant DNA sequence. The Polymerase chain reaction technology and CRISPR-Cas9, the new gene editor using pools of synthetic non-coding RNAs in screening experiments, are expected to lead to advances in the diagnosis of ADs. The current use of mRNA as a vaccine against COVID-19 has increased confidence in the use of mRNA or long non-coding RNAs in the treatment strategy for ADs. The integration of new knowledge about innate immunity, the complement system, vaccinology, and senescence into the care of patients with ADs expands the therapeutic arsenal of disease-modifying drugs and allows for the repurposing of anti-cytokine monoclonal/biosimilar antibodies, originally designed for chronic inflammatory diseases, for ADs. This review article brings together some of the most relevant ideas;a case report included in this review highlights the difficulty of distinguishing between ADs, chronic inflammation, and/or granular disease.","Lung, T.; Sakem, B.; Hemmerle, A.; Nydegger, M.; Risch, M.; Risch, L.; Nydegger, U.",Journal of Translational Autoimmunity,,884
214647,Post-Pandemic Patient Safety Culture: A Case from a Large Metropolitan Hospital Group in Taiwan,2021,"BACKGROUND: In mid-December 2020, Israel started a nationwide mass vaccination campaign against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In the first few weeks, medical personnel, elderly citizens, and patients with chronic diseases were prioritized. As such, patients with primary and secondary immunodeficiencies were encouraged to receive the vaccine. Although the efficacy of RNA-based COVID-19 vaccines has been demonstrated in the general population, little is known about their efficacy and safety in patients with inborn errors of immunity (IEI). OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to evaluate the humoral and cellular immune response to COVID-19 vaccine in a cohort of patients with IEI. METHODS: A total of 26 adult patients were enrolled, and plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cells were collected from them 2 weeks following the second dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. Humoral response was evaluated by testing anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) receptor-binding domain and antinucleocapsid antibody titers and evaluating neutralizing ability by inhibition of receptor-binding domain-angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 binding. Cellular immune response was evaluated by using ELISpot, estimating IL-2 and IFN-Î³ secretion in response to pooled SARS-CoV-2 S- or M-peptides. RESULTS: Our cohort included 18 patients with a predominantly antibody deficiency, 2 with combined immunodeficiency, 3 with immune dysregulation, and 3 with other genetically defined diagnoses. Twenty-two of them were receiving immunoglobulin replacement therapy. Of the 26 patients, 18 developed specific antibody response, and 19 showed S-peptide-specific T-cell response. None of the patients reported significant adverse events. CONCLUSION: Vaccinating patients with IEI is safe, and most patients were able to develop vaccine-specific antibody response, S-protein-specific cellular response, or both.","Hagin, David; Freund, Tal; Navon, Michal; Halperin, Tami; Adir, Dikla; Marom, Rotem; Levi, Inbar; Benor, Shira; Alcalay, Yifat; Freund, Natalia T",J. allergy clin. immunol,,884
216596,“People Will Continue to Suffer If the Virus Is Around”: A Qualitative Analysis of Sub-Saharan African Children’s Experiences during the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is triggered by a variety of agents, including Staphylococcal Enterotoxin B (SEB). Interestingly, a significant proportion of patients with COVID-19, also develop ARDS. In the absence of effective treatments, ARDS results in almost 40% mortality. Previous studies from our laboratory demonstrated that resveratrol (RES), a stilbenoid, with potent anti-inflammatory properties can attenuate SEB-induced ARDS. In the current study, we investigated the role of RES-induced alterations in the gut and lung microbiota in the regulation of ARDS. Our studies revealed that SEB administration induced inflammatory cytokines, ARDS, and 100% mortality in C3H/HeJ mice. Additionally, SEB caused a significant increase in pathogenic Proteobacteria phylum and Propionibacterium acnes species in the lungs. In contrast, RES treatment attenuated SEB-mediated ARDS and mortality in mice, and significantly increased probiotic Actinobacteria phylum, Tenericutes phylum, and Lactobacillus reuteri species in both the colon and lungs. Colonic Microbiota Transplantation (CMT) from SEB-injected mice that were treated with RES as well as the transfer of L. reuteri into recipient mice inhibited the production of SEB-mediated induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IFN-Î³ and IL-17 but increased that of anti-inflammatory IL-10. Additionally, such CMT and L. reuteri recipient mice exposed to SEB, showed a decrease in lung-infiltrating mononuclear cells, cytotoxic CD8+ T cells, NKT cells, Th1 cells, and Th17 cells, but an increase in the population of regulatory T cells (Tregs) and Th3 cells, and increase in the survival of mice from SEB-mediated ARDS. Together, the current study demonstrates that ARDS induced by SEB triggers dysbiosis in the lungs and gut and that attenuation of ARDS by RES may be mediated, at least in part, by alterations in microbiota in the lungs and the gut, especially through the induction of beneficial bacteria such as L. reuteri.","Alghetaa, Hasan; Mohammed, Amira; Zhou, Juhua; Singh, Narendra; Nagarkatti, Mitzi; Nagarkatti, Prakash",Pharmacol Res,,884

On admission to PICU, she was drowsy, tachycardic, tachypneic, with rashes, and hepatosplenomegaly. Lab findings showed thrombocytopenia, leucopenia, low ESR, normal CRP, elevated liver enzymes, high ferritin, LDH, and triglycerides suggestive of macrophage activation syndrome (MAS). Chest X-ray showed left basal pneumonia and DNA PCR of throat swab revealed adenovirus. She was diagnosed as adenovirus-triggered MAS and was initiated on pulse methylprednisolone (6 mg/kg). Because of suboptimal response after 2 doses, manifested by increasing drowsiness, further fall in platelets and rising ferritin, methylprednisolone dosage was increased to 30 mg/kg/day with the addition of oral cyclosporine (4 mg/kg/day). In view of worsening of the chest X-ray and increasing oxygen requirement, Cidofovir infusion (1 mg/kg thrice weekly) was also started simultaneously considering increased activity of the adenoviral infection concurrent to immunosuppression. Within 48 h, the child showed signs of recovery with improved consciousness, lower oxygen requirements, and improving lab parameters. She was discharged after 3 weeks of IV Cidofovir, on oral prednisolone and cyclosporine.

Additional literature that explores other modes of aerosol generation, such as coughing, vomiting, passing flatus, and loud vocalization, all of which are prevalent during the labor course, was notably omitted. It is clear that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention based their guidance not from the application of scientific principles but from pragmatism owing to the lack of equipment, and our colleagues were urged to follow suit. If we replace recommendations based on scientific principles with recommendations based on supply chain deficiencies, we become complacent with that which is ""good enough under the circumstances."" This is a dangerous precedent on which to base our professional society guidelines.

The concept of a surge of infected patients resulting in an overwhelming number of critical patients has been a central concern in healthcare planning during the COVID-19 era. RECENT FINDINGS: One crucial question remains as to how to manage patients with end stage renal disease and acute kidney injury in case of a massive surge of critically ill infected patients. Some publications address practical and ingenious solutions for just such a surge of need for renal replacement therapy. We present a plan for using a blood pump, readily available dialysis filter, and a prefilter and postfilter replacement fluid set up. This is in conjunction with multiple intravenous pumps to develop a simple hemofiltration apparatus. SUMMARY: The current set up may be a readily available option for use in critical situations where the need for renal replacement therapy outstrips the capacity of traditional hemodialysis services in a hospital or region.","Hanna, Ramy M; Ferrey, Antoney; Rhee, Connie M; Sam, Ramin; Pearce, David; Kalantar-Zadeh, Kamyar; Don, Burl R",Curr Opin Nephrol Hypertens,,884

Therefore, a low-cost, fast, and easily available solution is needed to provide a COVID-19 diagnosis to curb the outbreak. According to recent studies, one of the main symptoms of COVID-19 is coughing. The goal of this research effort is to develop a method for the automatic diagnosis of COVID-19 by detecting cough during recorded conversations. The method is composed of five main modules: sound extraction, sound feature extraction, cough detection, cough classification, and COVID-19 diagnosis. The method extracts relevant features from the audio signal and then uses machine learning and deep learning models, like SVM, KNN, and RNN, to classify them, which can successfully diagnose COVID-19 from audio recordings. Our method has relatively high accuracy when dealing with completely unfamiliar cough samples. When the training set and the test set are from two different databases, it still achieves an accuracy of 81.25% (AUC of 0.79). As more data sets are collected, the model can be further developed and improved to create a machine learning solution based on cough analysis for COVID-19 detection, which may be promoted as a non-clinical self-inspection solution. © 2021 IEEE.","Feng, K.; He, F.; Steinmann, J.; Demirkiran, I.",Conf Proc IEEE SOUTHEASTCON,,884

271078,Feeling Uncertainty during the Lockdown That Commenced in March 2020 in Greece,2021,"INTRODUCTION: Surgical Council on Resident Education (SCORE) curriculum is aligned with the American Board of Surgery (ABS) objectives. Our program adopted the SCORE curriculum in 2015 following poor ABS In-Training Examination (ABSITE) performance and lowest quartile ABS Certifying Exam (CE) and Qualifying Exam (QE) first-time pass rates. We examined the association of SCORE utilization with ABSITE performance and ABS board exam first-time pass rate. METHODS: At a single institution, a retrospective review of surgery residents' SCORE metrics and ABSITE percentile was conducted for academic year 2015 to 2019. Metrics analyzed on SCORE web portal were mean total minutes and total visits per resident for all residents using SCORE that year. First-time pass rates of the ABS QE and CE were examined from 2013 to 2019. Chi-square and linear regression analysis were performed, and a 95% level of confidence was assumed (alpha=.05). RESULTS: Yearly data from categorical general surgery residents showed a significant increase in total minutes, total visits, and ABSITE percentile. Combined first time pass rates for the ABS QE and CE significant increased from 70.8% in 2013-2015 to 93.9% in 2016-2019 (p=0.018).

279601,The Role of Celebrities During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Iran: Opportunity or Threat?,2020,"BACKGROUND: On Dec 31, 2019, China reported a cluster of cases of pneumonia in people at Wuhan, Hubei Province. The responsible pathogen is a novel coronavirus, named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We report the relevant features of the first cases in Europe of confirmed infection, named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), with the first patient diagnosed with the disease on Jan 24, 2020. METHODS: In this case series, we followed five patients admitted to Bichat-Claude Bernard University Hospital (Paris, France) and Pellegrin University Hospital (Bordeaux, France) and diagnosed with COVID-19 by semi-quantitative RT-PCR on nasopharyngeal swabs. We assessed patterns of clinical disease and viral load from different samples (nasopharyngeal and blood, urine, and stool samples), which were obtained once daily for 3 days from hospital admission, and once every 2 or 3 days until patient discharge. All samples were refrigerated and shipped to laboratories in the National Reference Center for Respiratory Viruses (The Institut Pasteur, Paris, and Hospices Civils de Lyon, Lyon, France), where RNA extraction, real-time RT-PCR, and virus isolation and titration procedures were done. FINDINGS: The patients were three men (aged 31 years, 48 years, and 80 years) and two women (aged 30 years and 46 years), all of Chinese origin, who had travelled to France from China around mid-January, 2020. Three different clinical evolutions are described: (1) two paucisymptomatic women diagnosed within a day of exhibiting symptoms, with high nasopharyngeal titres of SARS-CoV-2 within the first 24 h of the illness onset (5·2 and 7·4 log10 copies per 1000 cells, respectively) and viral RNA detection in stools; (2) a two-step disease progression in two young men, with a secondary worsening around 10 days after disease onset despite a decreasing viral load in nasopharyngeal samples; and (3) an 80-year-old man with a rapid evolution towards multiple organ failure and a persistent high viral load in lower and upper respiratory tract with systemic virus dissemination and virus detection in plasma. The 80-year-old patient died on day 14 of illness (Feb 14, 2020); all other patients had recovered and been discharged by Feb 19, 2020. INTERPRETATION: We illustrated three different clinical and biological types of evolution in five patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 with detailed and comprehensive viral sampling strategy. We believe that these findings will contribute to a better understanding of the natural history of the disease and will contribute to advances in the implementation of more efficient infection control strategies.

287231,Investigating the Determinants of High Case-Fatality Rate for Coronavirus Disease 2019 in Italy,2020,"Novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a growing public health crisis. Despite initial focus on the elderly population with comorbidities, it seems that large studies from the worst affected countries follow a sex-disaggregation pattern. Analysis of available data showed marked variations in reported cases between males and females among different countries with higher mortality in males. At this early stage of the pandemic, medical datasets at the individual level are not available; therefore, it is challenging to conclude how different factors have impacted COVID-19 susceptibility. Thus, in the absence of patients' level data, we attempted to provide a theoretical description of how other determinants have affected COVID-19 susceptibility in males compared to females. In this article, we have identified and discussed possible biological and behavioral factors that could be responsible for the increased male susceptibility. Biological factors include - an absence of X-chromosomes (a powerhouse for immune-related genes), a high level of testosterone that inhibits antibody production, and the presence of Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors that facilitate viral replication. Similarly, behavioral factors constitute - higher smoking and alcohol consumptions, low level of handwashing practices, and high-risk behavior like non-adherence to health services and reluctance to follow public health measures in males.

The review reveals that the three social capital dimensions uniquely and both positively and negatively affect different SCRs. The findings further suggest that the perceived SCRs can influence the structural and relational capital.Practical implicationsThis study calls for practitioners to consider the cognitive alignment with their supply network partners, their relational investments, as well as the interorganizational processes and systems in managing and alleviating SCRs.Originality/valueThis review offers a theoretical articulation of how various aspects of CIRs affect SCRs. Specifically, this study extends the existing understanding of the role of social capital in SCRs through offering a synthesis of dominant findings and discourses, and avenues for future research.","Daghar, Anis Alinaghian Leila Turner Neil",Supply Chain Management,,884

Therefore, elevated volume ventilations, usually reached during physical efforts and exercise, are a potential source of contamination. On the other hand, the lockdown period which has lasted for nearly 2 months and is actually involving several countries worldwide, obliged a large part of human population to sedentary behaviors, drastically reducing their physical activity level, and reducing their cardiopulmonary fitness. Therefore, cardiopulmonary exercise testing could be beneficial, so that a safe and well-weighted return to pre-lockdown active lifestyle can be efficiently planned.

There are high chances of getting false positives and false negatives identifying the COVID-19 symptoms through existing medical practices such as PCR (polymerase chain reaction) and RT-PCR (reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction). It might lead to a community spread of the disease. The alternative of these tests can be CT (Computer Tomography) imaging or X-rays of the lungs to identify the patient with COVID-19 symptoms more accurately. Furthermore, by using feasible and usable technology to automate the identification of COVID-19, the facilities can be improved. This notion became the basic framework, Res-CovNet, of the implemented methodology, a hybrid methodology to bring different platforms into a single platform. This basic framework is incorporated into IoMT based framework, a web-based service to identify and classify various forms of pneumonia or COVID-19 utilizing chest X-ray images. For the front end, the.NET framework along with C# language was utilized, MongoDB was utilized for the storage aspect, Res-CovNet was utilized for the processing aspect. Deep learning combined with the notion forms a comprehensive implementation of the framework, Res-CovNet, to classify the COVID-19 affected patients from pneumonia-affected patients as both lung imaging looks similar to the naked eye. The implemented framework, Res-CovNet, developed with the technique, transfer learning in which ResNet-50 used as a pre-trained model and then extended with classification layers. The work implemented using the data of X-ray images collected from the various trustable sources that include cases such as normal, bacterial pneumonia, viral pneumonia, and COVID-19, with the overall size of the data is about 5856.

Daily CO2 emissions are estimated from a diverse range of activity data, including the hourly to daily electrical power generation data of 31 countries, monthly production data and production indices of industry processes of 62 countries/regions, and daily mobility data and mobility indices for the ground transportation of 416 cities worldwide. Individual flight location data and monthly data were utilized for aviation and maritime transportation sector estimates. In addition, monthly fuel consumption data corrected for the daily air temperature of 206 countries were used to estimate the emissions from commercial and residential buildings. This Carbon Monitor dataset manifests the dynamic nature of CO2 emissions through daily, weekly and seasonal variations as influenced by workdays and holidays, as well as by the unfolding impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Carbon Monitor near-real-time CO2 emission dataset shows a 8.8% decline in CO2 emissions globally from January 1st to June 30th in 2020 when compared with the same period in 2019 and detects a regrowth of CO2 emissions by late April, which is mainly attributed to the recovery of economic activities in China and a partial easing of lockdowns in other countries.

METHODS AND RESULTS: Using Danish nationwide registries, we identified patients with a first-time acute cardiovascular admission in two periods: 1) January 2-October 16, 2019 and 2) January 2-October 15, 2020. Weekly incidence rates of a first-time cardiovascular admission, overall and according to subtypes, in the two periods were calculated. The incidence rate of first-time cardiovascular admissions overall was significantly lower during the first weeks of lockdown in 2020 compared with a similar period in 2019 but increased after the gradual reopening of the Danish society. A similar trend was observed for all subgroups of cardiovascular diseases. The mortality rate among patients admitted after March 12 was not significantly different in 2020 compared with 2019 (mortality rate ratio 0.98 [95% CI, 0.91-1.06]). CONCLUSIONS: In Denmark, we observed a substantial decrease in the rate of acute cardiovascular admissions, overall and according to subtypes, during the first weeks of lockdown. However, after the gradual reopening of the Danish society, the admission rates for acute cardiovascular diseases increased and returned to rates similar to those observed in 2019.

Starting from 239 articles, retrieved by the electronic search, only eight studies were included in our systematic review. Povidone Iodine (PVP-I) was effective in killing SARS-CoV-2, demonstrated higher virucidal activity than other commonly used active ingredients. Conflicting results were found about the effectiveness of Chlorhexidine (CHX) while hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) proved less effective than PVP-I. Other active ingredients, such as quaternary ammonium compounds and Ethanol (particularly when combined with essential oils), have also shown promising results in reducing viral load, with results comparable to PVP-I.","Tadakamadla, Jyothi; Boccalari, Elisa; Rathore, Vatsna; Dolci, Carolina; Tartaglia, Gianluca M; Tadakamadla, Santosh Kumar",J Infect Public Health,,884

In this study, we focus on factors that differentiate those who are undecided from those who are either willing or unwilling to accept a prospective COVID-19 vaccine. METHODS: An online survey in May 2020 assessed Australian adults' willingness to receive a COVID-19 vaccine (yes, maybe, no). A multinomial logistical regression of responses (N = 1,313) was used to identify correlates of vaccine willingness between the three groups. RESULTS: 65% were willing to vaccinate, with 27% being in the 'maybe' category. Respondents were more likely to be in the 'maybe' than the 'yes' group when they perceived COVID-19 to be less severe, had less trust in science, were less willing to vaccinate for influenza, and were female. They were more likely to be in the 'maybe' than 'no' group when they perceived COVID-19 as severe, and less likely to be a hoax, had more trust in science, and greater willingness to vaccinate for influenza. A repeat of the survey in November 2020 with a subset of participants found fewer of them saying yes to the vaccine (56%) and more saying maybe (31%). CONCLUSIONS: The effectiveness of any COVID-19 vaccine rollout will be reliant on maximizing uptake. The significant number of people who remain undecided about whether or not to get a COVID-19 vaccine, despite the ongoing devastating consequences of the virus for individuals, communities, and economies, is concerning. Our findings aid current research seeking to inform policy regarding how to convince the undecided to vaccinate.","Attwell, Katie; Lake, Joshua; Sneddon, Joanne; Gerrans, Paul; Blyth, Chris; Lee, Julie",PLoS One,,884

367433,First Responder Resiliency ECHO: Innovative Telementoring during the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has significantly impacted health care systems. However, to date, the trend of hospitalizations in the oncology patient population has not been studied, and the frequency of nosocomial spread to patients with cancer is not well understood. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on inpatient oncology census and determine the nosocomial rate of COVID-19 in patients with cancer admitted at a large academic center. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medical records of patients with cancer diagnosed with COVID-19 and admitted were reviewed to evaluate the temporal trends in inpatient oncology census during pre-COVID-19 (January 2019 to February 2020), COVID-19 (March to May 2020), and post-COVID-19 surge (June to August 2020) in the region. In addition, nosocomial infection rates of SARS-CoV-2 were reviewed. RESULTS: Overall, the daily inpatient census was steady in 2019 (median, 103; range, 92-118) and until February 2020 (median, 112; range, 102-114). However, there was a major decline from March to May 2020 (median, 68; range, 57-104), with 45.4% lower admissions during April 2020. As the COVID-19 surge eased, the daily inpatient census over time returned to the pre-COVID-19 baseline (median, 103; range, 99-111). One patient (1/231, 0.004%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 13 days after hospitalization, and it is unclear if it was nosocomial or community spread. CONCLUSION: In this study, inpatient oncology admissions decreased substantially during the COVID-19 surge but over time returned to the pre-COVID-19 baseline. With aggressive infection control measures, the rates of nosocomial transmission were exceedingly low and should provide reassurance to those seeking medical care, including inpatient admissions when medically necessary. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The COVID-19 pandemic has had a major impact on the health care system, and cancer patients are a vulnerable population. This study observes a significant decline in the daily inpatient oncology census from March to May 2020 compared with the same time frame in the previous year and examines the potential reasons for this decline. In addition, nosocomial rates of COVID-19 were investigated, and rates were found to be very low. These findings suggest that aggressive infection control measures can mitigate the nosocomial infection risk among cancer patients and the inpatient setting is a safe environment, providing reassurance.","Zubiri, Leyre; Rosovsky, Rachel P; Mooradian, Meghan J; Piper-Vallillo, A J; Gainor, Justin F; Sullivan, Ryan J; Marte, Daniel; Boland, Genevieve M; Gao, Xin; Hochberg, Ephraim P; Ryan, David P; McEwen, Corey; Mai, Minh; Sharova, Tanya; Soumerai, Tara E; Bardia, Aditya; Reynolds, Kerry L",Oncologist,,884

The objective of this research is to examine the response of the Shanghai Stock Exchange Composite (SSEC) index, in addition to its relation with macroeconomic variables contributing towards a possible Black Swan Event. We employ an econometric methodology comprising of a unit root test, descriptive statistics, linear regression and correlation analysis for the period 2007-2019. Our results illustarte that the bubble from 2015, which is classified as a Black Swan event by many researchers, has a negative influence on the SSEC index. We can further deduce that there were some psychological effects on the Chinese stock market that lead to both, positive and negative trends of SSEC indices. The main findings confirmed that the Consumer Price Index, Exchange Rate, Interest Rate, Unemployment, GDP and Trade Balance were significantly elaborative macroeconomic variables, that had a substantial impact on the SSEC index.","Stavrova, Elena Paskaleva Mariya Stoykova Ani",Proceedings of CBU in Economics and Business,,884
391851,"Preliminary Analysis of Relationships between COVID19 and Climate, Morphology, and Urbanization in the Lombardy Region (Northern Italy)",2020,"BACKGROUND: Conversations about educational challenges and potential solutions among a globally and culturally diverse group of health professions' educators can facilitate identity formation, mentoring relationships and professional network building. The COVID-19 pandemic has made it even more important to co-create and disseminate knowledge, specifically regarding online and flexible learning formats. APPROACH: Based on the principles of social learning, we combined speed mentoring and world café formats to offer a virtual Zoom&#8482; workshop, with large and small group discussions, to reach health professions' educators across the globe. The goal was to establish a psychologically safe space for dialogue regarding adaptation to online teaching-learning formats. EVALUATION: We aimed to establish psychological safety to stimulate thought-provoking discussions within the various small groups and obtain valuable contributions from participants. From these conversations, we were able to formulate 'hot tips' on how to adapt to (sometimes new) online teaching-learning formats while nurturing teacher and student wellbeing. REFLECTION: Through this virtual workshop we realized that despite contextual differences, many challenges are common worldwide. We experienced technological difficulties during the session, which needed rapid adaptation by the organising team. We encouraged, but did not pressure, participants to use video and audio during breakout discussions as we wanted them to feel safe and comfortable. The large audience size and different time zones were challenging; therefore, leadership had to be resilient and focussed. Although this virtual format was triggered by the pandemic, the format can be continued in the future to discuss other relevant global education topics.","McKimm, Judy; Ramani, Subha; Kusurkar, Rashmi A; Fornari, Alice; Nadarajah, Vishna Devi; Thampy, Harish; Filipe, Helena P; Kachur, Elizabeth K; Hays, Richard",Perspect Med Educ,,884

425477,"What is rural adversity, how does it affect wellbeing and what are the implications for action?",2020,"COVID-19 was declared an international public health emergency in January, and a pandemic in March of 2020. There are over 23 million confirmed COVID-19 cases that have cause over 800 thousand deaths worldwide as of August 19th, 2020. COVID-19 is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. SARS-CoV-2 presents a surface ""spike"" protein that binds to the ACE2 receptor to infect host cells. In addition to the respiratory tract, SARS-Cov-2 can also infect cells of the oral mucosa, which also express the ACE2 receptor. The spike and ACE2 proteins are highly glycosylated with sialic acid modifications that direct viral-host interactions and infection. Maackia amurensis seed lectin (MASL) has a strong affinity for sialic acid modified proteins and can be used as an antiviral agent. Here, we report that MASL targets the ACE2 receptor, decreases ACE2 expression and glycosylation, suppresses binding of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, and decreases expression of inflammatory mediators by oral epithelial cells that cause ARDS in COVID-19 patients. This work identifies MASL as an agent with potential to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 related inflammatory syndromes.","Sheehan, S. A.; Hamilton, K. L.; Retzbach, E.

Student's t-test and Chi-square test were used to compare the continuous and categorical variables, respectively. The logistic regression model was employed to ascertain the risk factors of mortality. This retrospective study involved 123 patients, including 64 dead and 59 survivors. Among them, 57 people were tested for interleukin-6 (IL-6) (20 died and 37 survived). In all included patients, the oxygenation index (PaO2/FiO2) was identified as an independent risk factor (odd ratio [OR] = 0.96, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.928-0.994, p = 0.021). The area under the curve (AUC) was 0.895 (95% CI: 0.826-0.943, p < 0.0001). Among the patients tested for IL-6, the PaO2/FiO2 (OR = 0.955, 95%CI: 0.915-0.996, p = 0.032) and IL-6 (OR = 1.013, 95%CI: 1.001-1.025, p = 0.028) were identified as independent risk factors. The AUC was 0.9 (95% CI: 0.791-0.964, p < 0.0001) for IL-6 and 0.865 (95% CI: 0.748-0.941, p < 0.0001) for PaO2/FiO2.

METHODS: We analysed data from repeated cross-sectional surveys on a representative sample of non-institutionalised Czech adults (18+ years) from both November 2017 (n = 3306; 54% females) and May 2020 (n = 3021; 52% females). We used Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) as the main screening instrument. We calculated descriptive statistics and compared the prevalence of current mood and anxiety disorders, suicide risk and alcohol-related disorders at baseline and right after the first peak of COVID-19 when related lockdown was still in place in CZ. In addition, using logistic regression, we assessed the association between COVID-19-related worries and the presence of mental disorders. RESULTS: The prevalence of those experiencing symptoms of at least one current mental disorder rose from a baseline of 20.02 (95% CI = 18.64; 21.39) in 2017 to 29.63 (95% CI = 27.9; 31.37) in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic. The prevalence of both major depressive disorder (3.96, 95% CI = 3.28; 4.62 v. 11.77, 95% CI = 10.56; 12.99); and suicide risk (3.88, 95% CI = 3.21; 4.52 v. 11.88, 95% CI = 10.64; 13.07) tripled and current anxiety disorders almost doubled (7.79, 95% CI = 6.87; 8.7 v. 12.84, 95% CI = 11.6; 14.05). The prevalence of alcohol use disorders in 2020 was approximately the same as in 2017 (10.84, 95% CI = 9.78; 11.89 v. 9.88, 95% CI = 8.74; 10.98); however, there was a significant increase in weekly binge drinking behaviours (4.07% v. 6.39%). Strong worries about both, health or economic consequences of COVID-19, were associated with an increased odds of having a mental disorder (1.63, 95% CI = 1.4; 1.89 and 1.42, 95% CI = 1.23; 1.63 respectively). CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence matching concerns that COVID-19-related mental health problems pose a major threat to populations, particularly considering the barriers in service provision posed during lockdown. This finding emphasises an urgent need to scale up mental health promotion and prevention globally.","Winkler, P; Formanek, T; Mlada, K; Kagstrom, A; Mohrova, Z; Mohr, P; Csemy, L",Epidemiol Psychiatr Sci,,884

In patients who experience severe disease, acute respiratory distress is often accompanied by a pathological immune reaction, sometimes referred to as 'cytokine storm'. One hallmark feature of the profound inflammatory state seen in patients with COVID-19 who succumb to pneumonia and hypoxia is marked elevation of serum cytokines, especially interferon gamma, tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin 17 (IL-17), interleukin 8 (IL-8) and interleukin 6 (IL-6). Initial experience from the outbreaks in Italy, China and the USA has anecdotally demonstrated improved outcomes for critically ill patients with COVID-19 with the administration of cytokine-modulatory therapies, especially anti-IL-6 agents. Although ongoing trials are investigating anti-IL-6 therapies, access to these therapies is a concern, especially as the numbers of cases worldwide continue to climb. An immunology-informed approach may help identify alternative agents to modulate the pathological inflammation seen in patients with COVID-19. Drawing on extensive experience administering these and other immune-modulating therapies, the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer offers this perspective on potential alternatives to anti-IL-6 that may also warrant consideration for management of the systemic inflammatory response and pulmonary compromise that can be seen in patients with severe COVID-19.","Arnaldez, Fernanda I; O039,; Day, Steven J; Drake, Charles G; Fox, Bernard A; Fu, Bingqing; Urba, Walter J; Montesarchio, Vincenzo; Weber, Jeffrey S; Wei, Haiming; Wigginton, Jon M; Ascierto, Paolo Antonio",J. immunotherap. cancer,,884

DESCRIPTION OF THE PROJECT: Using the advanced practice knowledge and skills, each CNS moved effortlessly between the 3 spheres of influence, patient, nursing, and organization, to address the unique needs of the COVID-positive patient, as well as the routinely ill who still needed care during a pandemic. In addition to observing and addressing opportunities at the bedside, the CNS team was essential in the development of plans of care, crisis care standards, and a structure for critical care cross-training. OUTCOMES: Five themes essential to success were identified: a common motivation and goal, collaboration, the importance of communication in utilizing established groups to create rapid change, power of influence, and the availability of a vast number of resources including professional nursing roles. CONCLUSION: Using the expertise of a specially trained team of CNSs, an effective plan was established to ensure safe, optimal care during the COVID-19 pandemic and effectively support frontline nurses.","Pate, Kimberly; Shaffer, Kathy; Belin, Latasia; Brelewski, Kiersten; Fuller, Kayla; Gold, Charles; Golden, Leslie; Raynor, Nora; Rutledge, Sarah; Spangler, Lacey; Weaver, Kelley",Clin Nurse Spec,,884

Different drug intervention acting at multiple stages of pathogenesis of COVID-19 can substantially reduce the infection induced,thereby decreasing the mortality. Also population level control strategies can reduce the spread of the COVID-19 substantially. Motivated by these observations, in this work we propose and study a multi scale model linking both within-host and between-host dynamics of COVID-19. Initially the natural history dealing with the disease dynamics is studied. Later, comparative effectiveness is performed to understand the efficacy of both the within-host and population level interventions. Findings of this study suggest that a combined strategy involving treatment with drugs such as Arbidol, remdesivir, Lopinavir/Ritonavir that inhibits viral replication and immunotherapies like monoclonal antibodies, along with environmental hygiene and generalized social distancing proved to be the best and optimal in reducing the basic reproduction number and environmental spread of the virus at the population level.","BhanuPrakash, D; Vamsi, D.

470270,Prone Positioning in Non-Intubated Patients With COVID-19 Outside of the Intensive Care Unit: More Evidence Needed,2020,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Stroke assistance is facing changes and new challenges since COVID-19 became pandemic. A variation on the patient influx might be one of the greater concerns, due to fewer people coming to emergency departments or coming too late. However, no data quantifying this have been published until now. The aim was to analyse the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic outbreak on hospital stroke admissions and their characteristics in our region. METHODS: The data of every patient admitted to any hospital of our healthcare system with a diagnosis of ischaemic stroke between 30 December 2019 and 19 April 2020 were reviewed. Demographic and clinical data were recorded and compared between periods before and after the setting of the state of emergency secondary to the COVID-19 outbreak. RESULTS: In total, 354 patients with ischaemic stroke were admitted in our study period. There was a weekly average of 27.5 cases before the setting of the state of emergency against 12 afterwards (P < 0.001). This drop in stroke cases occurred progressively from week 11, persisting in time despite the decrease in confirmed cases of COVID-19. No differences in the proportion of intravenous thrombolysis (21.1% vs. 21.5%, P = 0.935) or endovascular therapy (12.4% vs. 15.2%, P = 0.510) were found, nor in other demographic or clinical characteristics except for median onset-to-door time (102 vs. 183 min, P = 0.015). CONCLUSIONS: This observational study offers the perspective of a whole region in one of the countries more heavily stricken by the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic and shows that the decrease of stroke events, since the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak, happened globally and without any specific patient distribution.","Tejada Meza, H; Lambea Gil, Á; Sancho Saldaña, A; Villar Yus, C; Pardiñas Barón, B; Sagarra Mur, D; Marta Moreno, J",Eur. j. neurol,,884

The analysis is based on the daily transmission rate (DTR). The Chilean response has been based on dynamic quarantines, which are established, lifted or prolonged based on the percentage of infected individuals in the fundamental administrative sections, called communes. This analysis is performed at a national level, at the level of the Metropolitan Region (MR) and at the commune level in the MR according to whether the commune did or did not enter quarantine between late March and mid-May of 2020. The analysis shows a certain degree of efficacy in controlling the pandemic using the dynamic quarantine strategy. However, it also shows that apparent control has only been partially achieved to date. With this policy, the control of the DTR partially falls to 4%, where it settles, and the MR is the primary vector of infection at the country level. For this reason, we can conclude that the MR has not managed to control the disease, with variable results within its own territory.","Grebe, Gonzalo; Vélez, Javier A; Tiutiunnyk, Anton; Aragón-Caqueo, Diego; Fernández-Salinas, Javier; Navarrete, Mónica; Laroze, David",Epidemiol Infect,,884

In this study, we collected open access data to analyze the mechanisms associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) revealed that apoptosis-related pathways were enriched in the cells after SARS-CoV-2 infection, and the results of differential expression analysis showed that biological functions related to endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) and lipid metabolism were disordered. TMBIM6 was identified as a potential target for SARS-CoV-2 in host cells through weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA) of the time course of expression of host and viral proteins. The expression and related functions of TMBIM6 were subsequently analyzed to illuminate how viral proteins interfere with the physiological function of host cells. The potential function of viral proteins was further analyzed by GEne Network Inference with Ensemble of trees (GENIE3). This study identified TMBIM6 as a target protein associated with the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2, which might provide a novel therapeutic approach for COVID-19 in the future.","Han, Qizheng; Wang, Junhao; Luo, Haihua; Li, Lei; Lu, Xinya; Liu, Aihua; Deng, Yongqiang; Jiang, Yong",Aging (Albany NY),,884
498334,Is the Travel Bubble under COVID-19 a Feasible Idea or Not?,2021,"The etiologic agent of the Covid-19 pandemic is the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The viral membrane of SARS-CoV-2 surrounds a helical nucleocapsid in which the viral genome is encapsulated by the nucleocapsid protein. The nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2 is produced at high levels within infected cells, enhances the efficiency of viral RNA transcription, and is essential for viral replication. Here, we show that RNA induces cooperative liquid-liquid phase separation of the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein. In agreement with its ability to phase separate in vitro, we show that the protein associates in cells with stress granules, cytoplasmic RNA/protein granules that form through liquid-liquid phase separation and are modulated by viruses to maximize replication efficiency. Liquid-liquid phase separation generates high-density protein/RNA condensates that recruit the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase complex of SARS-CoV-2 providing a mechanism for efficient transcription of viral RNA. Inhibition of RNA-induced phase separation of the nucleocapsid protein by small molecules or biologics thus can interfere with a key step in the SARS-CoV-2 replication cycle.","Savastano, Adriana; Ibáñez de Opakua, Alain; Rankovic, Marija; Zweckstetter, Markus",Nat Commun,,884
505137,Cardiovascular Comorbidities and Pharmacological Treatments of COVID-19 Patients Not Requiring Hospitalization,2021,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has drastically changed the lives of countless members of the general population. Older adults are known to experience loneliness, age discrimination, and excessive worry. It is therefore reasonable to anticipate that they would experience greater negative outcomes related to the COVID-19 pandemic given their increased isolation and risk for complications than younger adults. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to synthesize the existing research on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and associated isolation and protective measures, on older adults. The secondary objective is to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and associated isolation and protective measures, on older adults with Alzheimer disease and related dementias. METHODS: A rapid review of the published literature was conducted on October 6, 2020, through a search of 6 online databases to synthesize results from published original studies regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on older adults. The Human Development Model conceptual framework-Disability Creation Process was used to describe and understand interactions between personal factors, environmental factors, and life habits. Methods and results are reported following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses Statement. RESULTS: A total of 135 records were included from the initial search strategy of 13,452 individual studies. Of these, 113 (83.7%) studies were determined to be of level 4 according to the levels of evidence classification by the Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine. The presence of psychological symptoms, exacerbation of ageism, and physical deterioration of aged populations were reported in the included studies. Decreased social life and fewer in-person social interactions reported during the COVID-19 pandemic were occasionally associated with reduced quality of life and increased depression. Difficulties accessing services, sleep disturbances, and a reduction of physical activity were also noted. CONCLUSIONS: Our results highlight the need for adequate isolation and protective measures. Older adults represent a heterogeneous group, which could explain the contradictory results found in the literature. Individual, organizational, and institutional strategies should be established to ensure that older adults are able to maintain social contacts, preserve family ties, and maintain the ability to give or receive help during the current pandemic. Future studies should focus on specific consequences and needs of more at-risk older adults to ensure their inclusion, both in public health recommendations and considerations made by policy makers.","Lebrasseur, Audrey; Fortin-Bédard, Noémie; Lettre, Josiane; Raymond, Emilie; Bussières, Eve-Line; Lapierre, Nolwenn; Faieta, Julie; Vincent, Claude; Duchesne, Louise; Ouellet, Marie-Christine; Gagnon, Eric; Tourigny, André; Lamontagne, Marie-Ève; Routhier, François",JMIR Aging,,884

This has led to reports of an increase in mortality for patients with non-Covid health conditions due to delayed definitive management. Patients with severe aortic stenosis have a high annual mortality if left untreated. These patients are at risk due to the reduced number of surgical aortic valve replacements and competition for intensive care facilities during the COVID-19 pandemic. This case series suggests that the minimally invasive transcatheter aortic valve implantation is safe to continue during the COVID-19 pandemic with adjustments to the patient pathway to minimize hospital stay and to reduce patient and staff exposure.

596427,Predicting Intensive Care Unit Admissions for COVID-19 Patients in the Emergency Department,2021-08-31,"Background: The Global Point Prevalence Survey (Global-PPS) provides a standardised method to conduct surveillance of antimicrobial prescribing and resistance at hospital level. The aim of the present study was to assess antimicrobial consumption and resistance in a Jordan teaching hospital as part of the Global-PPS network. Methods: Detailed antimicrobial prescription data were collected according to the Global Point Prevalence Survey protocol. The internet-based survey included all inpatients present at 8:00 am on a specific day in June–July 2018. Resistance data were based on microbiological results available on the day of the PPS. Results: Data were collected for 380 patients admitted to adult wards, 72 admitted children, and 36 admitted neonates. The overall prevalence of antimicrobial use in adult, paediatric, and neonatal wards was 45.3%, 30.6%, and 22.2% respectively. Overall, 36 patients (7.4%) were treated for at least one healthcare-associated infection (HAI). The most frequent reason for antimicrobial treatment was pneumonia. Cephalosporins and carbapenems were most frequent prescribed among adult (50.6%) and paediatric/neonatal wards (39.6%). Overall resistance rates among patients treated for a community or healthcare-associated infection was high (26.0%). Analysis of antibiotic quality indicators by activity revealed good adherence to treatment guidelines but poor documentation of the reason for prescription and a stop/review date in the notes. Conclusion: The present study has established baseline data in a teaching hospital regarding the quantity and quality of prescribed antibiotics in the hospital. The study should encourage the establishment of tailor-made antimicrobial stewardship interventions and support educational programs to enhance appropriate antibiotic prescribing.","Abu Hammour, Khawla; AL-Heyari, Esraa; Allan, Aya; Versporten, Ann; Goossens, Herman; Abu Hammour, Ghayda’; Manaseer, Qusai",Antibiotics (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32933115/; https://doi.org/10.3390/antibiotics9090598,884
652011,Delayed Primary and Specialty Care: The Coronavirus Disease–2019 Pandemic Second Wave,2020-05-07,"The COVID-19 pandemic and corresponding measures impacted the organisation of services for abortion on request in Flanders, Belgium. This study describes abortion centre staff’s perceptions of the influence of protective measures on abortion consultations and procedures, and aims to identify obstacles and opportunities that arose from this situation. Through the anonymised patient records of one Flemish abortion centre, we compared the number of requests and abortions during the first lockdown (16 March–14 June 2020) with the same period in the five preceding years. Using a phenomenological approach, we documented the procedures and conducted interviews (all inductively coded in Nvivo) with the centre’s coordinator, seven psychosocial staff members and three doctors. Though fewer people requested and had an abortion, the pressure on the staff was high due to changed procedures. A substantial change was the substitution of telephone for in-person consultations, which the staff perceived as less suited for discussing worries, contraception counselling, and building trust. The centre remained accessible, but the staff perceived an influence on the emotional reactions of clients. Staff agreed that the lockdown did not negatively influence the abortion procedure itself. However, they felt a negative influence on the level of psychological support they could offer, especially in interactions with clients who were less certain of their choice and clients with whom there was no common language. When the lockdown was relaxed, a triage system was set up to ensure emotionally safe abortion care – as perceived by staff – for all clients.","De Kort, Leen; Wouters, Edwin; Van de Velde, Sarah",Sexual and reproductive health matters,https://doi.org/10.1080/26410397.2021.1921901; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33982638/,884

The outbreak consisted of nine nurses and two roomed-in patient family members. (attack rate 18%). One nurse tested positive with a phylogenetically distinct variant, after a documented infection 83 days prior. Three key points were taken from this investigation. First, it was controlled by adherence to existing guidelines, despite increased transmissibility of the variant. Second, viral sequencing can inform transmission cluster inference, but the epidemiological context is essential to draw appropriate conclusions. Third, reinfections with Alpha variants can occur rapidly after primary infection.","Koopsen, Jelle; Dekker, Mireille; Thung, Philip; Jonges, Marcel; Vennema, Harry; Leenstra, Tjalling; Eggink, Dirk; Welkers, Matthijs R.

671242,Adaptation of Coronavirus (COVID-19) protocols to a Parisian maternity unit during the 2020 pandemic: a managerial perspective.,2020-07-14,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has a marked tropism for the biliary tract; it damages the bile ducts and hepatocytes and can lead to liver decompensation, cirrhosis, and sepsis. The pathogenesis of liver damage and its association with damage to the lung, heart, and brain and to the other protean manifestations of COVID-19 disease are not fully understood. In particular, tissue damage from thinning and leaky blood vessels appears to result from an inflammatory response to the virus rather than the virus itself. This article outlines a new hypothesis of the nature of the inflammatory factor responsible for tissue damage in COVID-19. Review of the literature reveals that COVID-19 disease closely resembles an endogenous form of hypervitaminosis A. We propose that SARS-CoV-2 virus-induced liver damage causes retinoic acid and stored retinyl esters to be released into the circulation in toxic concentrations, unbound to protein, with resulting damage to organs including the lungs, heart, blood vessels, and skin. Several lines of evidence support this model of disease causation. Subject to testing, strategies for the effective treatment and prevention of COVID-19 could include targeting the action and accumulation of retinoids.","Mawson, Anthony R.; Croft, Ashley M.; Gonzalez-Fernandez, Federico",Viral Immunol,https://doi.org/10.1089/vim.2020.0330; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33983857/,884

On the contrary, our viewpoint, supported by additional experimental data for similar cationic amphiphilic drugs, indicates that many of these molecules have both in vitro and in vivo efficacy with no reported phospholipidosis, and therefore, this class of compounds should not be avoided but further explored, as we continue the search for broad spectrum antivirals.","Lane, Thomas R; Ekins, Sean",Journal of chemical information and modeling,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jcim.1c00903; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34516123/,884
