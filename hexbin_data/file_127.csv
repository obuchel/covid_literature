259,259,259,Evidence of Recombination and Genetic Diversity in Human Rhinoviruses in Children with Acute Respiratory Infection,12.522582,9.385155,2009-07-27,"BACKGROUND: Human rhinoviruses (HRVs) are a highly prevalent cause of acute respiratory infection in children. They are classified into at least three species, HRV-A, HRV-B and HRV-C, which are characterized by sequencing the 5′ untranslated region (UTR) or the VP4/VP2 region of the genome. Given the increased interest for novel HRV strain identification and their worldwide distribution, we have carried out clinical and molecular diagnosis of HRV strains in a 2-year study of children with acute respiratory infection visiting one district hospital in Shanghai. METHODOLOGY/FINDINGS: We cloned and sequenced a 924-nt fragment that covered part of the 5′UTR and the VP4/VP2 capsid genes. Sixty-four HRV-infected outpatients were diagnosed amongst 827 children with acute low respiratory tract infection. Two samples were co-infected with HRV-A and HRV-B or HRV-C. By comparative analysis of the VP4/VP2 sequences of the 66 HRVs, we showed a high diversity of strains in HRV-A and HRV-B species, and a prevalence of 51.5% of strains that belonged to the recently identified HRV-C species. When analyzing a fragment of the 5′ UTR, we characterized at least two subspecies of HRV-C: HRV-Cc, which clustered differently from HRV-A and HRV-B, and HRV-Ca, which resulted from previous recombination in this region with sequences related to HRV-A. The full-length sequence of one strain of each HRV-Ca and HRV-Cc subspecies was obtained for comparative analysis. We confirmed the close relationship of their structural proteins but showed apparent additional recombination events in the 2A gene and 3′UTR of the HRV-Ca strain. Double or triple infections with HRV-C and respiratory syncytial virus and/or bocavirus were diagnosed in 33.3% of the HRV-infected patients, but no correlation with severity of clinical outcome was observed. CONCLUSION: Our study showed a high diversity of HRV strains that cause bronchitis and pneumonia in children. A predominance of HRV-C over HRV-A and HRV-B was observed, and two subspecies of HRV-C were identified, the diversity of which seemed to be related to recombination with former HRV-A strains. None of the HRV-C strains appeared to have a higher clinical impact than HRV-A or HRV-B on respiratory compromise.","Huang, Ting; Wang, Wei; Bessaud, Mael; Ren, Peijun; Sheng, Jun; Yan, Huajie; Zhang, Jing; Lin, Xin; Wang, Yongjin; Delpeyroux, Francis; Deubel, Vincent",PLoS One,127,11
1233,1233,1233,Duplex Molecular Assay Intended for Point-of-Care Diagnosis of Influenza A/B Virus Infection,12.548437,9.481331,2013-09-11,"Early diagnosis and management of influenza virus infection directly correlates with the effectiveness in disease control. Current molecular influenza virus tests were designed for use in diagnostic testing facilities, where sophisticated equipment and highly trained technicians are available. A longer turnaround time for the centralized testing than when testing near the sample source could delay the initiation of medical intervention, thereby reducing the efficacy of antiviral treatment. The new assay, the SAMBA (simple amplification-based assay) Flu duplex test, is a dipstick-based molecular assay developed to provide a simple, accurate, and cost-effective solution for the diagnosis of influenza A/B viruses intended for near-patient testing. The test presents an alternative format of influenza virus molecular testing that utilizes isothermal amplification and visual detection of nucleic acid on a test strip. The entire test procedure (extraction, amplification, and detection) is integrated into an enclosed semiautomated system. Analytically, the SAMBA Flu duplex test detects 95 and 85 copies of viral genomes for influenza A and B viruses, respectively, with no cross-reactivity observed against other common respiratory pathogens. The clinical performance was established by blind testing of 328 nasal/throat and nasopharyngeal swab specimens from the United Kingdom and Belgium and comparing the results with the quantitative reverse transcription-PCR method routinely used in two public health laboratories. The SAMBA Flu duplex test showed a clinical sensitivity and specificity of 100% and 97.9% for influenza virus A and 100% and 100% for influenza virus B. The test provides a new technology that could facilitate simple and timely identification of influenza virus infection, potentially resulting in more efficient control measures.","Wu, Liang-Ta; Thomas, Isabelle; Curran, Martin D.; Ellis, Joanna S.; Parmar, Surendra; Goel, Neha; Sharma, Pia I.; Allain, Jean-Pierre; Lee, Helen H.",J Clin Microbiol,127,28
1250,1250,1250,Estimating Potential Infection Transmission Routes in Hospital Wards Using Wearable Proximity Sensors,12.467473,9.50496,2013-09-11,"BACKGROUND: Contacts between patients, patients and health care workers (HCWs) and among HCWs represent one of the important routes of transmission of hospital-acquired infections (HAI). A detailed description and quantification of contacts in hospitals provides key information for HAIs epidemiology and for the design and validation of control measures. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We used wearable sensors to detect close-range interactions (“contacts”) between individuals in the geriatric unit of a university hospital. Contact events were measured with a spatial resolution of about 1.5 meters and a temporal resolution of 20 seconds. The study included 46 HCWs and 29 patients and lasted for 4 days and 4 nights. 14,037 contacts were recorded overall, 94.1% of which during daytime. The number and duration of contacts varied between mornings, afternoons and nights, and contact matrices describing the mixing patterns between HCW and patients were built for each time period. Contact patterns were qualitatively similar from one day to the next. 38% of the contacts occurred between pairs of HCWs and 6 HCWs accounted for 42% of all the contacts including at least one patient, suggesting a population of individuals who could potentially act as super-spreaders. CONCLUSIONS: Wearable sensors represent a novel tool for the measurement of contact patterns in hospitals. The collected data can provide information on important aspects that impact the spreading patterns of infectious diseases, such as the strong heterogeneity of contact numbers and durations across individuals, the variability in the number of contacts during a day, and the fraction of repeated contacts across days. This variability is however associated with a marked statistical stability of contact and mixing patterns across days. Our results highlight the need for such measurement efforts in order to correctly inform mathematical models of HAIs and use them to inform the design and evaluation of prevention strategies.","Vanhems, Philippe; Barrat, Alain; Cattuto, Ciro; Pinton, Jean-François; Khanafer, Nagham; Régis, Corinne; Kim, Byeul-a; Comte, Brigitte; Voirin, Nicolas",PLoS One,127,1
1421,1421,1421,"One family cluster of avian influenza A(H7N9) virus infection in Shandong, China",12.654359,9.367892,2014-02-21,"BACKGROUND: The first case of human infection with avian influenza A (H7N9) virus was identified in March, 2013 and the new H7N9 virus infected 134 patients and killed 45 people in China as of September 30, 2013. Family clusters with confirmed or suspected the new H7N9 virus infection were previously reported, but the family cluster of H7N9 virus infection in Shandong Province was first reported. CASE PRESENTATION: A 36-year-old man was admitted to Zaozhuang City Hospital with progressive respiratory distress and suspicion of impending acute respiratory distress syndrome on April 21. The chest radiography revealed bilateral ground-glass opacities and pulmonary lesions. The second case, the first case’s 4 year old son, was admitted to the same hospital on April 28 with fever and multiple patchy shadows in the bilateral lungs. Both of the two cases were confirmed to infect with H7N9 virus by the results of real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase-chain reaction (rRT-PCR), virus isolation and serum antibody titer. At the same time, one environment samples was detected positive for H7N9 virus in the living poultry market in Zaozhuang. The homologous analysis of the full genome sequence indicated that both viruses from the patients were almost genetically identical. The field epidemiology investigation showed that the two cases had no recognized exposure to poultry, but had the exposure to the environment. The second case had substantial unprotected close exposure to his ill father and developed symptoms seven days after his last contact with his father. After surgery, the index case and his son were discharged on May 16 and May 6, respectively. 11 close contacts of both patients were identified and tested negative both the throat swabs and the serum antibody. CONCLUSION: The infection of the index case probably resulted from contact with environmentally contaminated material. For the son, the probable infection source was from the index case during unprotected exposure, but the possibility from the environment or other sources could not be completely ruled out.","Liu, Ti; Bi, Zhenqiang; Wang, Xianjun; Li, Zhong; Ding, Shujun; Bi, Zhenwang; Wang, Liansen; Pei, Yaowen; Song, Shaoxia; Zhang, Shengyang; Wang, Jianxing; Sun, Dapeng; Pang, Bo; Sun, Lin; Jiang, Xiaolin; Lei, Jie; Yuan, Qun; Kou, Zengqiang; Yang, Bin; Shu, Yuelong; Yang, Lei; Li, Xiyan; Lu, Kaishun; Liu, Jun; Zhang, Tao; Xu, Aiqiang",BMC Infect Dis,127,3
2014,2014,2014,Interval Between Infections and Viral Hierarchy Are Determinants of Viral Interference Following Influenza Virus Infection in a Ferret Model,12.841176,9.715377,2015-12-01,"Background. Epidemiological studies suggest that, following infection with influenza virus, there is a short period during which a host experiences a lower susceptibility to infection with other influenza viruses. This viral interference appears to be independent of any antigenic similarities between the viruses. We used the ferret model of human influenza to systematically investigate viral interference. Methods. Ferrets were first infected then challenged 1–14 days later with pairs of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, influenza A(H3N2), and influenza B viruses circulating in 2009 and 2010. Results. Viral interference was observed when the interval between initiation of primary infection and subsequent challenge was <1 week. This effect was virus specific and occurred between antigenically related and unrelated viruses. Coinfections occurred when 1 or 3 days separated infections. Ongoing shedding from the primary virus infection was associated with viral interference after the secondary challenge. Conclusions. The interval between infections and the sequential combination of viruses were important determinants of viral interference. The influenza viruses in this study appear to have an ordered hierarchy according to their ability to block or delay infection, which may contribute to the dominance of different viruses often seen in an influenza season.","Laurie, Karen L.; Guarnaccia, Teagan A.; Carolan, Louise A.; Yan, Ada W.

2666,2666,2666,"Risk of tuberculosis among air passengers estimated by interferon gamma release assay: survey of contact investigations, Japan, 2012 to 2015",12.431773,9.521799,2017-03-23,"Although the World Health Organization recommends contact investigations around air travel-associated sputum smear-positive tuberculosis (TB) patients, evidence suggests that the information thus obtained may have overestimated the risk of TB infection because it involved some contacts born in countries with high TB burden who were likely to have been infected with TB in the past, or because tuberculin skin tests were used, which are less specific than the interferon gamma release assay (IGRA) particularly in areas where Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccination coverage is high. We conducted a questionnaire survey on air travel-associated TB contact investigations in local health offices of Japan from 2012 to 2015, focusing on IGRA positivity. Among 651 air travel-associated TB contacts, average positivity was 3.8% (95% confidence interval (CI): 2.5–5.6) with a statistically significant increasing trend with older age (p < 0.0094). Positivity among 0–34 year-old contacts was 1.0% (95% CI: 0.12–3.5%), suggesting their risk of TB infection is as small as among Japanese young adults with low risk of TB infection (positivity: 0.85–0.90%). Limiting the contact investigation to fewer passengers (within two seats surrounding the index case, rather than two rows) seems reasonable in the case of aircraft with many seats per row.","Ota, Masaki; Kato, Seiya",Euro Surveill,127,8

They are induced upon infection and are particularly abundant at barrier surfaces, such as the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts. Although they signal through a unique heterodimeric receptor complex comprising IFNLR1 and IL10RB, they activate a downstream signaling pathway remarkably similar to that of type I IFNs and share many functions with them. Yet, they also have important differences which are only now starting to unfold. Here, we review the current literature implicating type III IFNs in the regulation of immunity and homeostasis in the respiratory tract. We survey the common and unique characteristics of type III IFNs in terms of expression patterns, cellular targets, and biological activities and discuss their emerging role in first line defenses against respiratory viral infections. We further explore their immune modulatory functions and their involvement in the regulation of inflammatory responses during chronic respiratory diseases, such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Type III IFNs are, therefore, arising as front-line guardians of immune defenses in the respiratory tract, fine tuning inflammation, and as potential novel therapeutics for the treatment of diverse respiratory diseases, including influenza virus infection and asthma.","Andreakos, Evangelos; Salagianni, Maria; Galani, Ioanna E.; Koltsida, Ourania",Front Immunol,127,1
3097,3097,3097,Supplemental Oxygen–Free Days in Hematopoietic Cell Transplant Recipients With Respiratory Syncytial Virus,12.758541,9.582941,2017-08-07,"BACKGROUND: Clinically meaningful endpoints for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) treatment trials are lacking for hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipients. We evaluated supplemental oxygen use among HCT recipients with RSV infection. METHODS: Subjects were grouped according to the presence of upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) without lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI), URTI progressing to LRTI, and LRTI at presentation. LRTI was defined as a positive lower respiratory tract sample with or without radiographic abnormality (defined as proven or probable LRTI, respectively) or a positive upper respiratory tract sample with radiographic abnormality (possible LRTI). Supplemental oxygen–free days were defined as any day while alive after diagnosis of RSV infection during which ≤2 L of supplemental oxygen per minute was received. RESULTS: Among 230 patients, supplemental oxygen use by day 28 after the first diagnosis of RSV infection was lowest in patients presenting with URTI (31 of 197 [16%]). Supplemental oxygen use was lower in patients with possible LRTI (12 of 45 [27%]) than in those with proven/probable LRTI (29 of 42 [69%]). Patients presenting with proven/probable LRTI had a median of 16 fewer supplemental oxygen–free days than those presenting with URTI (P < .0001). Death only occurred among patients with proven/probable LRTI (11 of 42 [26%]). CONCLUSIONS: Confirmation of RSV infection in the lower respiratory tract provides prognostic information that may help prioritize therapies. Supplemental oxygen–free days as a clinical endpoint may allow smaller sample sizes for trials evaluating RSV antivirals.","Waghmare, Alpana; Xie, Hu; Kimball, Louise; Yi, Jessica; Özkök, Sezen; Leisenring, Wendy; Cheng, Guang-Shing; Englund, Janet A; Watkins, Timothy R; Chien, Jason W; Boeckh, Michael",The Journal of Infectious Diseases,127,28
3152,3152,3152,Comparison of Respiratory Pathogen Detection in Upper versus Lower Respiratory Tract Samples Using the BioFire FilmArray Respiratory Panel in the Immunocompromised Host,12.709271,9.352308,2018-04-05,"BACKGROUND: The FilmArray Respiratory Panel (FARP) (BioFire Diagnostics, Inc.) is a multiplex, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique that can detect 17 respiratory viruses and 3 bacterial targets in a single reaction. Immunocompromised hosts (ICH) with respiratory illnesses often undergo bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). This prospective study aimed to evaluate the yield and concordance of NP and BAL FARP testing when performed on the same patient concurrently. METHODS: From February to December 2016, 125 patients (100 ICH and 25 non-ICH) were enrolled. NP swabs and BAL samples were sent for FARP testing. RESULTS: The yield of the BAL FARP among ICH and non-ICH was 24% (24/100) and 8% (2/25), respectively. The yield of positive NP swabs in ICH was 27% (27/100) versus 4% (1/25) in non-ICH. The majority of patients (89%; 111/125) had concordant results between NP and BAL specimens. Of the 24 ICH patients who had a positive BAL FARP, the majority (79%) had the same pathogen detected from the NP swab. CONCLUSION: The FARP may be useful in the ICH. Given the high concordance, in patients whom a pathogen is identified on the NP FARP, a FARP performed on BAL will likely yield the same result. However, if the NP FARP is negative, performing the test on a BAL sample may have an incremental yield.","Azadeh, Natalya; Sakata, Kenneth K.; Saeed, Ali; Mullon, John J.; Grys, Thomas E.; Limper, Andrew H.; Binnicker, Matthew J.",Can Respir J,127,1

Fully human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) provide an attractive method to overcome many of these hurdles to rapidly produce therapeutics for emerging diseases. METHODS: In this study, we deployed a platform to generate, test, and develop fully human antibodies to Zaire ebolavirus. We obtained specific anti-Ebola virus (EBOV) antibodies by immunizing VelocImmune mice that use human immunoglobulin variable regions in their humoral responses. RESULTS: Of the antibody clones isolated, 3 were selected as best at neutralizing EBOV and triggering FcγRIIIa. Binding studies and negative-stain electron microscopy revealed that the 3 selected antibodies bind to non-overlapping epitopes, including a potentially new protective epitope not targeted by other antibody-based treatments. When combined, a single dose of a cocktail of the 3 antibodies protected nonhuman primates (NHPs) from EBOV disease even after disease symptoms were apparent. CONCLUSIONS: This antibody cocktail provides complementary mechanisms of actions, incorporates novel specificities, and demonstrates high-level postexposure protection from lethal EBOV disease in NHPs. It is now undergoing testing in normal healthy volunteers in preparation for potential use in future Ebola epidemics.","Pascal, Kristen E; Dudgeon, Drew; Trefry, John C; Anantpadma, Manu; Sakurai, Yasuteru; Murin, Charles D; Turner, Hannah L; Fairhurst, Jeanette; Torres, Marcela; Rafique, Ashique; Yan, Ying; Badithe, Ashok; Yu, Kevin; Potocky, Terra; Bixler, Sandra L; Chance, Taylor B; Pratt, William D; Rossi, Franco D; Shamblin, Joshua D; Wollen, Suzanne E; Zelko, Justine M; Carrion, Ricardo; Worwa, Gabriella; Staples, Hilary M; Burakov, Darya; Babb, Robert; Chen, Gang; Martin, Joel; Huang, Tammy T; Erlandson, Karl; Willis, Melissa S; Armstrong, Kimberly; Dreier, Thomas M; Ward, Andrew B; Davey, Robert A; Pitt, Margaret L M; Lipsich, Leah; Mason, Peter; Olson, William; Stahl, Neil; Kyratsous, Christos A",J Infect Dis,127,3

Humoral pattern recognition molecules include complement components, collectins, ficolins, and pentraxins. These molecules are involved in innate immune responses by recognizing microbial moieties and damaged tissues, activating complement, exerting opsonic activity and facilitating phagocytosis, and regulating inflammation. The long pentraxin PTX3 is a prototypic humoral pattern recognition molecule that, in addition to providing defense against infectious agents, plays several functions in tissue repair and regulation of cancer-related inflammation. Characterization of the PTX3 molecular structure and biochemical properties, and insights into its interactome and multiple roles in tissue damage and remodeling support the view that microbial and matrix recognition are evolutionarily conserved functions of humoral innate immunity molecules.","Doni, Andrea; Stravalaci, Matteo; Inforzato, Antonio; Magrini, Elena; Mantovani, Alberto; Garlanda, Cecilia; Bottazzi, Barbara",Front Immunol,127,1

Plasma soluble ST2 (sST2), a prognostic biomarker for heart failure, has been proposed as a diagnostic biomarker of AASs outperforming D-dimer, the current diagnostic standard. We performed a prospective diagnostic accuracy study of sST2 for AASs in the Emergency Department (ED). In 2017–2018, patients were enrolled if they had ≥1 red-flag symptoms (chest/abdominal/back pain, syncope, perfusion deficit) and a clinical suspicion of AAS. sST2 was detected with the Presage® assay. Adjudication was based on computed tomography angiography (CTA) or on diagnostic outcome inclusive of 30-day follow-up. 297 patients were enrolled, including 88 with AASs. The median age was 67 years. In 162 patients with CTA, the median sST2 level was 41.7 ng/mL (IQR 29.4–103.2) in AASs and 34.6 ng/mL (IQR 21.4–51.5) in alternative diagnoses (P = 0.005). In ROC analysis, the AUC of sST2 was 0.63, as compared to 0.82 of D-dimer (P < 0.001).

The research objective is to develop a Saudi e-health literacy scale (SeHL) for measuring e-health literacy among Saudis suffering from non-communicable diseases (NCD). METHODS: Overall, 14 relevant papers in related interdisciplinary fields were reviewed to select the most useful literacy dimensions. From these articles, we extracted the most common dimensions used to measure e-health literacy across the disciplines. Multiple workshops with multidisciplinary team members reviewed and evaluated items for SeHL. RESULTS: Four key aspects of e-health literacy—use of technology/media, information-seeking, usefulness and confidence—were identified and integrated as e-health literacy dimensions. These will be used to measure e-health literacy among Saudi patients with NCDs. A translation from Arabic to English was performed in order to ensure that translation process was accurate. A SeHL scale was developed to measure e-health literacy among Saudi patients. By understanding e-health literacy levels, we will be able to create a patient-education system to be used by patients in Saudi Arabia. CONCLUSIONS: As information technology is increasingly used by people of all ages all over the world, e-health literacy has been identified as a key factor in determining health outcomes.

We investigated the role played by chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) in the influx of T cells to the cardiac tissue of T. cruzi—infected mice. mRNA and protein for the CCR5 ligands CCL3, CCL4, and CCL5 were detected in the hearts of infected mice in association with CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells. There was a high level of CCR5 expression on CD8(+) T cells in the hearts of infected mice. Moreover, CCR5 expression on CD8(+) T cells was positively modulated by T. cruzi infection. CCR5-deficient mice infected with T. cruzi experienced a dramatically inhibited migration of T cells to the heart and were also more susceptible to infection. These results suggest that CCR5 and its ligands play a central role in the control of T cell influx in T. cruzi-infected mice. Knowledge of the mechanisms that trigger and control the migration of cells to the heart in patients with Chagas disease may help in the design of drugs that prevent myocarditis and protect against the development of severe disease.","Machado, Fabiana S.; Koyama, Natalia S.; Carregaro, Vanessa; Ferreira, Beatriz R.; Milanezi, Cristiane M.; Teixeira, Mauro M.; Rossi, Marcos A.i; Silva, João",J Infect Dis,127,3

BALB/c mice were infected with MHV3, subsequently labelled in vivo with (35)S-methionine, and then the liver preparations from both infected and non-infected animals were subjected to two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Comparisons of the patterns by computer image analysis revealed 17 gene products which increased, and 8 gene products which decreased, upon virus infection in their two-dimensional gel spot intensity. We conclude that during MHV3 infection of a susceptible strain of mice, a major modification in protein synthesis occurs. The pattern alterations were not related to the virus gene products but were mostly endogenous mouse proteins. Whether these proteins are a result of a defence attempt by the animal, or are dictated by the virus in order to prevent a protective response from happening, remains to be shown.","Lucchiari, M.A.; Pereira, C.A.; Kuhn, L.; Lefkovits, I.",Res Virol,127,1

(ii) This technique can be applied to viral diagnosis in clinical samples. Objectives and study design: (i) To study the identification of six common respiratory viral pathogens by flow cytometry, in virus infected and uninfected cultured cells, as models of positive and negative clinical samples. (ii) To compare flow cytometry with the established techniques of viral isolation and immunofluorescent microscopy in the diagnosis of respiratory syncytial virus infection in 68 naso-pharyngeal aspirates taken from children and sent to the virology laboratory for routine virological diagnosis. Results: (i) For each virus analysed, populations of infected and non-infected cells were clearly discernable, confirming potential for this method in rapid viral diagnosis in clinical samples. (ii) Two definitions were employed for a sample to be positive by flow cytometry, these were compared with the combined established techniques. The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of flow cytometry were 41%, 98%, 92% and 71% for the first definition and 74%, 88%, 80% and 84% for the second definition respectively. Conclusions: As tested in this study, flow cytometry is less sensitive than established techniques as well as recently developed rapid diagnostic techniques for the diagnosis of respiratory syncytial virus infection. Further evaluation of the potential of flow cytometry in rapid viral diagnosis is warranted.","Johnston, S.L.; Dalal, A.; Mason, S.; Wilson, J.W.; Robinson, B.S.; Holgate, S.T.",Clin Diagn Virol,127,1

Coughing and sneezing by an infected person can emit pathogen-containing particles with diameters less than 10 μm that can reach the alveolar region. Based on our analysis of the sparse literature on respiratory aerosols, we estimated that emitted particles quickly decrease in diameter due to water loss to one-half the initial values, and that in one cough the volume in particles with initial diameters less than 20 μm is 6 × 10(−8) mL. The pathogen emission rate from a source case depends on the frequency of expiratory events, the respirable particle volume, and the pathogen concentration in respiratory fluid. Viable airborne pathogens are removed by exhaust ventilation, particle settling, die-off, and air disinfection methods; each removal mechanism can be assigned a first-order rate constant. The pathogen concentration in well-mixed room air depends on the emission rate, the size distribution of respirable particles carrying pathogens, and the removal rate constants. The particle settling rate and the alveolar deposition fraction depend on particle size. Given these inputs plus a susceptible person's breathing rate and exposure duration to room air, an expected alveolar dose μ is estimated. If the infectious dose is one organism, as appears to be true for tuberculosis, infection risk is estimated by the expression: R = 1 − exp(−μ). Using published tuberculosis data concerning cough frequency, bacilli concentration in respiratory fluid, and die-off rate, we illustrate the model via a plausible scenario for a person visiting the room of a pulmonary tuberculosis case. We suggest that patients termed “superspreaders” or “dangerous disseminators” are those infrequently encountered persons with high values of cough and/or sneeze frequency, elevated pathogen concentration in respiratory fluid, and/or increased respirable aerosol volume per expiratory event such that their pathogen emission rate is much higher than average.","Nicas, Mark; Nazaroff, William W.; Hubbard, Alan",J Occup Environ Hyg,127,1

After the first cases of influenza A(H1N1)v in Mexico and the USA became public, Fresenius Medical Care established a case-based reporting of cases for all of its dialysis clinics located in Europe, Middle East, Africa and Latin America. This paper aims to describe mortality rates of patients on dialysis and to assess the risk profiles. Methods. The survey was developed in Lotus Notes with a secure browser-based form. The form was open to 602 Fresenius Medical Care clinics located in Europe, Middle East, Africa and Latin America. Results. As of 3 September 2009, 306 cases have been reported by 85 clinics located in Argentina, Chile, Brazil, UK and Spain. The mean age was 52.7 ± 17.7 years. The majority of cases (70.6%) were from 20- to 44-year-old and 45- to 64-year-old subgroups. Moreover, 35.3% had no associated comorbidity, 20.3% had two and 4.6% three comorbidities, with heart disease being the most frequent. Fever was the most common symptom, present in 94.4% of the cases, followed by cough (78.8%) and muscle and joint pain (69.3%). Eighty-seven percent were treated with antiviral agents, the majority with oseltamivir. One hundred and three patients (34%) were admitted to hospital because of influenza. Pneumonia was reported for 69 cases, out of which 52 patients belonged to a high-risk group. Mortality rate of all the patients (confirmed, probable and suspected cases) was around 5%. Conclusion. End-stage renal disease patients should be included in first ranks of the priority list for the influenza A (H1N1)v vaccine, as already advocated by some healthcare authorities.","Marcelli, Daniele; Marelli, Cristina; Richards, Nick",Nephrol Dial Transplant,127,3

Age and genotypes were obtained for 40,861 men from the PRACTICAL consortium. The dataset included 201,590 SNPs per subject, and was split into training and testing sets. Established-SNP models considered 65 SNPs that had been previously associated with prostate cancer. Discovery-SNP models used stepwise selection to identify new SNPs. The performance of each PHS model was calculated for random sizes of the training set. The performance of a representative Established-SNP model was estimated for random sizes of the testing set. Mean HR(98/50) (hazard ratio of top 2% to average in test set) of the Established-SNP model increased from 1.73 [95% CI: 1.69–1.77] to 2.41 [2.40–2.43] when the number of training samples was increased from 1 thousand to 30 thousand.

Fortunately, the World Health Organization (WHO) has formally designated scabies as a neglected tropical disease in 2017, in the hope of increasing awareness and encouraging efforts to eradicate it. Also, scabies has recently been included as part of the WHO roadmap for neglected tropical diseases 2021–2030, aimed at ending the neglect to attain the Sustainable Development Goals. MAIN ABSTRACT BODY: This review article places scabies in focus. The literature was reviewed to explore discussions on controversial issues in scabies control, with the aim of clarifying whether global control of scabies is a feasible and worthwhile objective. The existing status of scabies and its burden are discussed along with future prospects for its global control. The article investigates the feasibility of scabies control and provides updates on the various impediments to this goal, such as challenges related to transmission, diagnosis, treatment, and vaccine development. Also examined are relevant research needs, success factors, and reasons for failure. This article aims to increase the global awareness of scabies and promote discussion, enhance coordinated international efforts, and ultimately, enact change at the national and worldwide levels toward the control of this preventable disease of the poor. CONCLUSION: Despite the current challenges, scabies control is now within reach. With sustained interventions, continuous resources, and sincere commitment and support, scabies global control appears to be a worthwhile, realistic goal that is potentially achievable in the not so distant future.","El-Moamly, Amal A.",Trop Med Health,127,28

It may thus contribute to immunometabolic mechanisms of cellular and organ dysfunction in sepsis. Nonetheless, the association of exosomal CD63 with the severity and mortality of sepsis is not well known. Therefore, in the present study, the overall levels of exosomal CD63 were evaluated to ascertain whether they were associated with organ failure and mortality in patients with sepsis. Exosomal CD63 was measured from prospectively enrolled critically-ill patients with sepsis (n = 217) and healthy control (n = 20). To detect and quantify exosomes in plasma, a commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit was used according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The total number of exosomal CD63 was determined by quantifying the immunoreactive CD63. The association between plasma levels of exosomal CD63 and sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score was assessed by a linear regression method. The best cut-off level of exosomal CD63 for 28-day mortality prediction was determined by Youden’s index. Among 217 patients with sepsis, 143 (66%) patients were diagnosed with septic shock. Trends of increased exosomal CD63 levels were observed in control, sepsis, and septic-shock groups (6.6 µg/mL vs. 42 µg/mL vs. 90 µg/mL, p < 0.001). A positive correlation between exosomal CD63 and SOFA scores was observed in patients with sepsis (r value = 0.35). When patients were divided into two groups according to the best cut-off level, the group with higher exosomal CD63 levels (more than 126 µg/mL) was significantly associated with 28-day and in-hospital mortality. Moreover, the Kaplan–Meier survival method showed a significant difference in 90-day survival between patients with high- and low-exosomal CD63 levels (log-rank p = 0.005). Elevated levels of exosomal CD63 were associated with the severity of organ failure and predictive of mortality in critically ill patients with sepsis.","Im, Yunjoo; Yoo, Hongseok; Ko, Ryoung-Eun; Lee, Jin Young; Park, Junseon; Jeon, Kyeongman",Sci Rep,127,1

Carbon nanoparticles in the form of nanostrings are acting as reporters. As carbon nanotags accumulate in the test zone due to formation of an antibody-antigen-carbon nanotag antibody complex, and this allows for the direct visualization of the analytical signal. Under optimal conditions, influenza A virus can be determined in allantoic fluid inoculated with the virus with a limit of detection of 350 TCID(50).mL(−1) (i.e., the 50% tissue culture infectious dose). No interference is found for several other tested proteins, and for closely related viruses. Cell lysates containing different seasonal strains of influenza A viruses (including the H1N1 and H3N2 strains) collected from clinical samples were analyzed. It is demonstrated that the method can detect both influenza A viruses without interference by biological matrices. In our perception, this method has a wide potential in that it may be extended to a generally applicable platform for rapid diagnosis influenza A viruses.

In this chapter, the biophysical and biological aspects relevant for the assessment of health effects related to the use of ionizing radiation in PET and (electro)magnetic fields in MR are summarized. On this basis, the current safety standards will be presented – which, however, do not address the possibility of synergistic effects of ionizing radiation and (electro)magnetic fields.

At times, the nature of the network involved in the transmission of the pathogen (bacteria, virus, macro-parasite, etc.) appears to be clear; however, the nature of the network involved is dependent on the scale (e.g. within-host, between-host, or between-population), the nature of the contact, which ranges from the highly specific (e.g. sexual acts or needle sharing at the person-to-person level) to almost completely non-specific (e.g. aerosol transmission, often over long distances as can occur with the highly infectious livestock pathogen foot-and-mouth disease virus—FMDv—at the farm-to-farm level, e.g. Schley et al. in J. R. Soc. Interface 6:455–462, 2008), and the timescale of interest (e.g. at the scale of the individual, the typical infectious period of the host). Theoretical approaches to examining the implications of particular network structures on disease transmission have provided critical insight; however, a greater challenge is the integration of network approaches with data on real population structures. In this chapter, some concepts in disease modelling will be introduced, the relevance of selected network phenomena discussed, and then results from real data and their relationship to network analyses summarised.

As similar symptoms are elicited by the two pathogens, it is difficult for their differential diagnosis. So far, no reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay has been found to differentiate between H9 AIV and IBV in one reaction. Therefore, developing a sensitive and specific method is of importance to simultaneously detect and differentiate H9 AIV and IBV. In this study, a duplex RT-PCR (dRT-PCR) was established. Two primer sets target the hemagglutinin (HA) gene of H9 AIV and the nucleocapsid (N) gene of IBV, respectively. Specific PCR products were obtained from all tested H9 AIVs and IBVs belonging to the major clades circulating in China, but not from AIVs of other subtypes or other infectious avian viruses. The sensitivity of the dRT-PCR assay corresponding to H9 AIV, IBV and mixture of H9 AIV and IBV were at a concentration of 1×10(1), 1.5×10(1) and 1.5×10(1) 50% egg infective doses (EID(50)) mL(−1), respectively. The concordance rates between the dRT-PCR and virus isolation were 99.1 and 98.2%, respectively, for detection of samples from H9N2 AIV or IBV infected chickens, while the concordance rate was 99.1% for detection of samples from H9N2 AIV and IBV co-infected chickens. Thus, the dRT-PCR assay reported herein is specific and sensitive, and suitable for the differential diagnosis of clinical infections and surveillance of H9 AIVs and IBVs.","WEI, Yan-di; GAO, Wei-hua; SUN, Hong-lei; YU, Chen-fang; PEI, Xing-yao; SUN, Yi-peng; LIU, Jin-hua; PU, Juan",J Integr Agric,127,1

As the challenges of the world increasingly transcend borders, so too have researchers and innovators forged international coalitions to resolve global pathologies. In doing so, new channels of influence and opportunity have opened up for states alongside the ‘traditional’ modes of foreign diplomacy. Understanding how these channels influence global socio-economic outcomes is thereby crucial for scholars interested in the still-ambiguous structure and processes of global governance. This article advances understanding of the domains of science diplomacy by drawing attention to the ‘political intercostalities’ of state actors, scientific communities and other transnational actors within the new architectures of global governance. Here we trace the growing array of informal international associations alongside transgovernmental policy networks and ‘global public-policy partnerships’ that deal with highly specialised and technical matters of international policy and how they are drawn into science diplomacy.

Many diagnostic options have to be taken into account when a patient suffering from lung cancer presents with nonspecific, respiratory, clinical manifestations. A multidisciplinary diagnostic approach is then warranted. The top priority is to rule out those life-threatening causes, such as lung infection, that could be properly treated if a right diagnosis is early. To reach a definite diagnosis frequently requires that one or more diagnostic, pneumologic techniques are performed. Regarding to drug-induced pulmonary disease, prevention is mandatory. In this review we have tried to highlight the risk and characteristics of cytostatic-induced pulmonary toxicity caused by those agents that have been commonly employed to treat lung cancer for the last decades. When treating lung cancer patients, a high clinical suspicion of chemotherapy-induced lung toxicity should be kept in mind since an early withdrawal of the offending drug is the most efficacious therapy.","Cutillas, Jorge Roig; Rodríguez, Elvira Gea; Viñals, Nuria Barral",,127,1

The Health Belief Model (Rosenstock, 1974) suggests the likelihood of using precautionary measures depends on perceived susceptibility, the severity of a disease, and whether effective measures can be taken to reduce the perceived threat of a disease. This daily diary study focused on identifying predictors of daily precautionary behavior in older persons. Between April 1 and June 26, 2020, 261 adults ages 55-79 (M = 64.29, SD = 5.20) completed up to 30 consecutive days of online diaries. We examined whether perceived risk, COVID-19 knowledge, fake news beliefs, information seeking, disruption to routine, in-person interactions, and leaving the house predicted the number of daily precautions participants engaged in. Multilevel modeling was used to examine within-person fluctuations in precautions as well as change in precautions from one day to the next. People who reported higher education, scored higher on the COVID-19 knowledge quiz, had lower fake news beliefs, and perceived a higher risk of contracting COVID-19 endorsed more precautions. At the daily level, increases in the number of in-person interactions, leaving home, and disruption to daily routine were each associated with decreases in precautionary behaviors. Concurrent day and lagged models showed significant interactions between information seeking and perceived risk, suggesting increases in information seeking are related to increases in precautions for those who consider their risk to be low. Findings highlight potentially intervenable factors that influence older adults’ daily decision making related to precautionary actions.","Hughes, MacKenzie; Coblenz, Clara; Smith, Emily; Neupert, Shevaun; Pearman, Ann",Innov Aging,127,22

Here we show that aggregated cultural values of nations, derived from World Values Survey data, have been at least as important as top-down government actions in predicting the impact of COVID-19. At the population level, the cultural factor of cosmopolitanism, together with obesity, predict higher numbers of deaths in the first two months of COVID-19 on the scale of nations. At the state level, the complementary variables of government efficiency and public trust in institutions predict lower death numbers. The difference in effect between individual beliefs and behaviors, versus state-level actions, suggests that open cosmopolitan societies may face greater challenges in limiting a future pandemic or other event requiring a coordinated national response among the population. More generally, mass cultural values should be considered in crisis preparations.

As of 1 May 2020, a total of 3,308,386 confirmed cases have been reported worldwide, with an accumulative mortality of 233,093. Due to the complexity and uncertainty of the pathology of COVID‐19, it is not easy for front‐line doctors to categorise severity levels of clinical COVID‐19 that are general and severe/critical cases, with consistency. The more than 300 laboratory features, coupled with underlying disease, all combine to complicate proper and rapid patient diagnosis. However, such screening is necessary for early triage, diagnosis, assignment of appropriate level of care facility, and institution of timely intervention. A machine learning analysis was carried out with confirmed COVID‐19 patient data from 10 January to 18 February 2020, who were admitted to Tongji Hospital, in Wuhan, China. A softmax neural network‐based machine learning model was established to categorise patient severity levels. According to the analysis of 2662 cases using clinical and laboratory data, the present model can be used to reveal the top 30 of more than 300 laboratory features, yielding 86.30% blind test accuracy, 0.8195 F1‐score, and 100% consistency using a two‐way patient classification of severe/critical to general. For severe/critical cases, F1‐score is 0.9081 (i.e. recall is 0.9050, and precision is 0.9113). This model for classification can be accomplished at a mini‐second‐level computational cost (in contrast to minute‐level manual). Based on available COVID‐19 patient diagnosis and therapy, an artificial intelligence model paradigm can help doctors quickly classify patients with a high degree of accuracy and 100% consistency to significantly improve diagnostic and classification efficiency. The discovered top 30 laboratory features can be used for greater differentiation to serve as an essential supplement to current guidelines, thus creating a more comprehensive assessment of COVID‐19 cases during the early stages of infection. Such early differentiation will help the assignment of the appropriate level of care for individual patients.","Xiao, Yang; Yan, Li; Zhang, Mingyang; Pinkerton, Kent E.; Cao, Haosen; Xiao, Ying; Li, Wei; Li, Shuai; Wang, Yancheng; Li, Shusheng; Cao, Zhiguo; Wong, Gary Wing‐Kin; Xu, Hui; Zhang, Hai‐Tao",,127,1

METHODS We used linked administrative data to derive home-time in all patients admitted for a cerebrovascular event in Alberta, Canada, between 2012 and 2016. Home-time is the number of days spent outside a health institution in the first 90 days after index hospitalization. We used negative binomial regression, adjusted for age, sex, Charlson comorbidity index, and hospital location, to determine the association between home-time and stroke type. In 552 patients enrolled in 4 acute ischemic stroke clinical trials, we used multivariable ordinal logistic regression analysis to determine the association between home-time and mRS score at 90 days. RESULTS Among 15,644 patients (n = 10,428 with ischemic stroke, n = 1,415 with intracerebral hemorrhage, n = 760 with subarachnoid hemorrhage, n = 3,041 with TIA), patients with TIA have the longest home-time, almost triple the number of days at home compared to patients with intracerebral hemorrhage (incidence rate ratio 2.85, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.58-3.15). Among clinical trial ischemic stroke patients, longer home-time was associated with a lower mRS score at 90 days (adjusted common odds ratio 1.04, 95% CI 1.04-1.05). CONCLUSIONS We showed that home-time is an objective and graded indicator that is correlated with disability after stroke. It is obtainable from administrative data, applicable to different stroke types, and a valuable outcome indicator in population-based health services research.","Yu, Amy Y X; Rogers, Edwin; Wang, Meng; Sajobi, Tolulope T; Coutts, Shelagh B; Menon, Bijoy K; Hill, Michael D; Smith, Eric E",Neurology,127,16

Underlying factors contributing to access issues have received little systematic attention. OBJECTIVE To synthesize current literature on disparities in access to hospice and palliative care, highlight the range of sociodemographic groups affected by these inequities, characterize the domains of access addressed, and outline implications for research, policy, and clinical practice. DESIGN An integrative review comprised a systematic search of PubMed, Embase, and CINAHL databases, which was conducted from inception to March 2020 for studies outlining disparities in hospice and palliative care access in the United States. Data were analyzed using critical synthesis within the context of a health care accessibility conceptual framework. Included studies were appraised on methodological quality and quality of reporting. RESULTS Of the articles included, 80% employed non-experimental study designs. Study measures varied, but 70% of studies described differences in outcomes by race, ethnicity, or socioeconomic status. Others revealed disparate access based on variables such as age, gender, and geographic location. Overall synthesis highlighted evidence of disparities spanning 5 domains of access: Approachability, Acceptability, Availability, Affordability, and Appropriateness; 60% of studies primarily emphasized Acceptability, Affordability, and Appropriateness. CONCLUSIONS This integrative review highlights the need to consider various stakeholder perspectives and attitudes at the individual, provider, and system levels going forward, to target and address access issues spanning all domains.","Nelson, Katie E; Wright, Rebecca; Peeler, Anna; Brockie, Teresa; Davidson, Patricia M",The American journal of hospice & palliative care,127,1

This technique is reported to be difficult when large fibroids are involved because of excessive blood loss during surgery. Skillful and fast suturing appears to be associated with reduced blood loss during LM. In this study we compared the surgical outcomes of using bidirectional Stratafix® barbed suture versus conventional suture during LM. METHODS This retrospective study included all patients who underwent LM for the treatment of intramural myoma in our institution between 2015 and 2020. The patients were divided into 2 groups according to the technique of suturing during LM: Group 1 comprised patients in whom Stratafix® barbed suture was used (n = 29), and group 2 comprised those in whom conventional suture was used (n = 15). Data of patient age, myoma size, the number of myoma nodes, hemoglobin levels, total operation time, total suturing time, and blood loss during surgery were compared between the 2 groups. RESULTS No significant differences in age (p = 0.463) or myoma size (P = 0.373) were observed between the 2 groups. Operation time (P = 0.0104), suturing time (P = 0.007), and blood loss (P = 0.0375) during surgery were significantly less with Stratafix® barbed suture than with conventional suture. No patient required intraoperative transfusion or conversion to laparotomy. CONCLUSION The use of bidirectional barbed suture reduces operation time, suturing time, and blood loss. As these new sutures have barbs, no knot-tying is required; thus, continuous suturing becomes very simple and maintaining hemostasis is easy. Unskilled gynecological surgeons who apply this suture technique can also perform LM easily. As the bidirectional barbed suture has multiple points of fixation, this suture technique can reapproximate tissue securely, which reduces the chances of reoperation because of proper suture knotting. Therefore, bidirectional Stratafix® barbed sutures could be an optimal and efficient alternative to conventional sutures for use by gynecological surgeons in Japan.","Nakayama, Kentaro; Razia, Sultana; Ishikawa, Masako; Yamashita, Hitomi; Ishibashi, Tomoka; Sasamori, Hiroki; Sawada, Kiyoka; Kurose, Sonomi; Sato, Seiya; Kyo, Satoru",BMC women's health,127,31

In order to elucidate the underlying mechanisms involved in anemia, this study was designed to assess the antioxidant status and erythrocyte oxidative injuries in Iranian fat-tailed sheep that suffered from malignant theileriosis. The infected animals (infected group), composed of 50 Iranian sheep about 1-2 years old, naturally infected with Theileria sp., were divided into three subgroups according to parasitemia rates (<1%, 1-3%, 3-5%), and ten non-infected animals were also selected as the control group. Blood samples were taken and hematological parameters, the activities of antioxidant enzymes including superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPX) and catalase, erythrocyte osmotic fragility, and serum concentrations of some trace elements (copper, iron, zinc, manganese, and selenium), were measured. As an index of lipid peroxidation, the level of malondialdehyde (MDA) was also determined. According to the results, a significant decrease in red blood cell (RBC) count, packed cell volume, the activities of SOD, GPX, and catalase (P <0.001), and also serum concentrations of Cu, Zn, Mn, and Se (P < 0.05) were evident in the infected sheep. In contrast, significantly increased levels of MDA and erythrocyte osmotic fragility (P < 0.001) as well as serum concentration of iron (P < 0.05) were recorded in the infected animals. The significant decrease in antioxidant enzyme activities and substantial elevated levels of lipid peroxidation and erythrocyte osmotic fragility associated with the increase in parasitemia indicate increased exposure of RBCs to oxidative damage. Also, it appears that disturbed antioxidant defense mechanisms can promote the development of anemia in ovine theileriosis.","Nazifi, S; Razavi, S M; Kianiamin, P; Rakhshandehroo, E",Parasitology research,127,5

The purpose of this study was to determine the number and topics of systematic overviews on the effectiveness of orthopaedic interventions. Methods We performed a review of PubMed, Ovid Embase, Scopus, OrthoEvidence, and the Cochrane Library for dates of publication from January 1, 2006, to February 3, 2017, to identify systematic overviews of randomized clinical trials for the effectiveness of therapeutic interventions involving orthopaedic surgeons. Abstracts were excluded based on the following sequentially applied criteria: (1) the systematic review did not include an intervention for an orthopaedic condition; the intervention was not therapeutic; the intervention was not likely to be applied or influenced by an orthopaedic surgeon; (2) the study was not a systematic review or the study was a single randomized controlled trial, and/or it included nonhuman studies; (3) the systematic review included nonrandomized studies; and (4) the systematic review did not state moderate or strong evidence in support of the study conclusion(s).

Identifying high mortality risk individuals infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus through a prediction instrument that uses simple clinical and analytical parameters at admission can help clinicians to focus on treatment efforts in this group of patients. METHODS Data was obtained retrospectively from the electronic medical record of all COVID-19 patients hospitalized in the Albacete University Hospital Complex until July 2020. Patients were split into two: a generating and a validating cohort. Clinical, demographical, and laboratory variables were included. A multivariate logistic regression model was used to select variables associated with in-hospital mortality in the generating cohort. A numerical and subsequently a categorical score according to mortality was constructed (A.-mortality from 0 to 5%; B.-from 5 to 15%; C.-from 15 to 30%; D.-from 30 to 50%; E.-greater than 50%). These scores were validated with the validation cohort. RESULTS Variables independently related to mortality during hospitalization were age, diabetes mellitus, confusion, SaFiO2, heart rate, and LDH at admission. The numerical score defined ranges from 0 to 13 points. Scores included are: age ≥71 years (3 points), diabetes mellitus (1 point), confusion (2 points), onco-hematologic disease (1 point), SaFiO2 ≤ 419 (3 points), heart rate ≥100 bpm (1point), and LDH ≥390 IU/L (2 points). The area under the curve (AUC) for the numerical and categorical scores from the generating cohort were 0.8625 and 0.848, respectively. In the validating cohort, AUCs were 0.8505 for the numerical score and 0.8313 for the categorical score. CONCLUSIONS .

MIP-T3 interacts specifically with TRAF3, but its function in innate IFN response remains unclear. In this study, we demonstrated a negative regulatory role of MIP-T3 in type I IFN production. Overexpression of MIP-T3 inhibited RIG-I-, MDA5-, VISA-, TBK1-, and IKKε-induced transcriptional activity mediated by IFN-stimulated response elements and IFN-β promoter. MIP-T3 interacted with TRAF3 and perturbed in a dose-dependent manner the formation of functional complexes of TRAF3 with VISA, TBK1, IKKε, and IFN regulatory factor 3. Consistent with this finding, retinoic acid-inducible gene I- and TBK1-induced phosphorylation of IFN regulatory factor 3 was significantly diminished when MIP-T3 was overexpressed. Depletion of MIP-T3 facilitated Sendai virus-induced activation of IFN production and attenuated the replication of vesicular stomatitis virus. In addition, MIP-T3 was found to be dissociated from TRAF3 during the course of Sendai virus infection. Our findings suggest that MIP-T3 functions as a negative regulator of innate IFN response by preventing TRAF3 from forming protein complexes with critical downstream transducers and effectors.","Ng, Ming-Him James; Ho, Ting-Hin; Kok, Kin-Hang; Siu, Kam-Leung; Li, Jun; Jin, Dong-Yan",Journal of immunology,127,1

The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the effects of non-invasive RIPC on clinical and biochemical outcomes in patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery. METHODS A systematic literature search of PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, and Cochrane databases was carried out in February 2020. RCTs investigating the effect of non-invasive RIPC in adults undergoing non-cardiac surgery were included. Meta-analyses and trial sequential analyses (TSAs) were performed on cardiovascular events, acute kidney injury, and short- and long-term mortality. RESULTS Some 43 RCTs including 3660 patients were included. The surgical areas comprised orthopaedic, vascular, abdominal, pulmonary, neurological, and urological surgery. Meta-analysis showed RIPC to be associated with fewer cardiovascular events in non-cardiac surgery (13 trials, 1968 patients, 421 events; odds ratio (OR) 0.68, 95 per cent c.i. 0.47 to 0.96; P = 0.03). Meta-analyses of the effect of RIPC on acute kidney injury (12 trials, 1208 patients, 211 events; OR 1.14, 0.78 to 1.69; P = 0.50; I2 = 9 per cent), short-term mortality (7 trials, 1239 patients, 65 events; OR 0.65, 0.37 to 1.12; P = 0.12; I2 = 0 per cent), and long-term mortality (4 trials, 1167 patients, 9 events; OR 0.67, 0.18 to 2.55; P = 0.56; I2 = 0 per cent) showed no significant differences for RIPC compared with standard perioperative care in non-cardiac surgery. However, TSAs showed that the required information sizes have not yet been reached. CONCLUSION Application of RIPC to non-cardiac surgery might reduce cardiovascular events, but not acute kidney injury or all-cause mortality, but currently available data are inadequate to confirm or reject an assumed intervention effect.","Wahlstrøm, K L; Bjerrum, E; Gögenur, I; Burcharth, J; Ekeloef, S",BJS open,127,5

Biologic therapy for NLRP3-AID yields diverse results. OBJECTIVES We aimed to evaluate the clinical features and outcomes of Chinese adult patients with NLRP3-AID who were treated with tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α inhibitors. METHODS Five patients with NLRP3-AID were diagnosed and treated with TNF-α inhibitors at Peking Union Medical College Hospital between 2017 and 2020 and were followed up for 6 to 12 months. All patients were systematically studied for treatment outcomes, including clinical manifestations and inflammatory markers. RESULTS All five adult NLRP3-AID patients were Chinese Han, and four patients were males. The mean age at disease onset was 4.2 ± 4.1 years, and the mean time of diagnosis delay was 19.8 ± 6 years. All patients received TNF-α inhibitors with or without methotrexate/prednisone. During follow-up, all patients achieved remarkable clinical remission of skin lesions and polyarthritis and showed improvements in acute phase reactants, inflammatory cytokines, patient visual analogue scale, physician global assessment, and 36-item Short Form (SF-36). CONCLUSIONS Early diagnosis and effective therapy for NLRP3-AID are essential for avoiding irreversible organ damage. TNF-α inhibitors might serve as a therapeutic alternative for NLRP3-AID patients who have unsatisfactory responses or no access to interleukin-1 inhibitors.","Wu, Na; Wu, Di; Zhao, Mengzhu; Miao, Junke; Yu, Weihong; Wang, Yi; Shen, Min",Journal of internal medicine,127,31

However, the extent of sexual victimisation in old age psychiatry patients is unknown. Due to insufficient communication skills in both patients and healthcare workers, assessing SV in old age psychiatry patients is challenging. AIMS To assess lifetime and sexual victimisation in the past 12-months, correlates and SV disclosure in an old age psychiatry population. METHODS Between July 2019 and March 2020, 100 patients at three old age psychiatry wards across Flanders participated in a face-to-face structured interview receiving inpatient treatment. The participation rate was 58%. We applied the WHO definition of SV, encompassing sexual harassment, sexual abuse with physical contact without penetration, and (attempted) rape. RESULTS In 57% of patients (65% F, 42% M) SV occurred during their lifetime and 7% (6% F, 9% M) experienced SV in the past 12-months. Half of the victims disclosed their SV experience for the first time during the interview. Only two victims had disclosed SV to a mental health care professional before. CONCLUSIONS Sexual victimisation appears to be common in old age psychiatry patients, yet it remains largely undetected. Although victims did reveal SV during a face-to-face interview to a trained interviewer, they do not seem to spontaneously disclose their experiences to mental health care professionals. In order to provide tailored care for older SV victims, professionals urgently need capacity building through training, screening tools and care procedures. This article is protected by copyright.

Barriers to clinical engagement typically result from funding constraints causing limited access to and flexibility in services. Digital strategies, such as SMS text messaging, offer a low-cost alternative to potentially improve engagement. However, little is known about the efficacy of SMS text messaging in psychosis. OBJECTIVE This review aimed to address this gap, providing insights into the relationship between SMS text messaging and clinical engagement in the treatment of psychosis. METHODS Studies examining SMS text messaging as an engagement strategy in the treatment of psychosis were reviewed. Included studies were published from the year 2000 onward in the English language, with no methodological restrictions, and were identified using 3 core databases and gray literature sources. RESULTS Of the 233 studies extracted, 15 were eligible for inclusion. Most studies demonstrated the positive effects of SMS text messaging on dimensions of engagement such as medication adherence, clinic attendance, and therapeutic alliance. Studies examining the feasibility of SMS text messaging interventions found that they are safe, easy to use, and positively received. CONCLUSIONS Overall, SMS text messaging is a low-cost, practical method of improving engagement in the treatment of psychosis, although efficacy may vary by symptomology and personal characteristics. Cost-effectiveness and safety considerations were not adequately examined in the studies included. Future studies should consider personalizing SMS text messaging interventions and include cost and safety analyses to appraise readiness for implementation.","D'Arcey, Jessica; Collaton, Joanna; Kozloff, Nicole; Voineskos, Aristotle N; Kidd, Sean A; Foussias, George",JMIR mental health,127,23

Most important, the risk for inadvertent thermal injury during electrosurgery can be minimized by a sound comprehension of the predictable behaviors of electricity in living tissue.Guided by the Hippocratic charge of primum non nocere, the ultimate aim of energy-assisted surgery is the attainment of anatomic dissection and hemostasis with the least amount of collateral damage and subsequent scar tissue formation.Ideally, the surgeon’s final view of the operative field should accurately approximate the topography discoverable after postoperative healing. Despite the continued innovation of products borne to reduce thermal damage and then marketed as being comparatively safer, it is the hands and mind of the surgeon that serve to preserve tissue integrity by reducing the burden of delayed thermal necrosis and taking steps to prevent excessive devitalization of tissue. Regardless of the chosen modality, the inseparable and exponentially linked elements of time and the quantity of delivered energy must be integrated while purposefully moderating to attain the desired tissue effect. Ultimately, the reduction of unwanted thermal injury is inherently linked to good surgical judgment and technique, a sound comprehension of the applied energy modality, and the surgeon’s ability to recognize anatomic structures within the field of surgical dissection as well as those within the zone of significant thermal change.During the use of any energy-based device for hemostasis, out of sight must never mean out of mind. If the bowel, bladder, or ureter is in close proximity to a bleeder,they should be sufficiently mobilized before applying energy. Thermal energy should always be withheld until an orderly sequence of anatomic triage is carried out.Whenever a vital structure cannot be adequately mobilized, hemorrhage is preferentially controlled by using mechanical tamponade or suture ligature.","Brill, Andrew I",Obstetrics and gynecology clinics of North America,127,1

While clinical symptoms present in some COVID-19 patients, others have been incidentally identified. The objective of this study was to examine the clinical and laboratory features of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 who were symptomatic or had atypical symptoms and to make a contribution to the literature. METHODS Patients with the likelihood of having COVID-19 pneumonia were evaluated with RT-PCR samples, other laboratory tests, and chest computed tomography. RESULTS There were significant differences between these groups in terms of age, dyspnea, saturation, and comor-bidities including hypertension [HT] in 19 patients, cerebrovascular events [CVE] that were classified as other diseases in two patients (intracranial mass in one patient and Alzheimer's disease in one patient), and CRP and platelet counts (PLT) among the laboratory parameters (for all p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS Atypical symptoms have increased due to the progression of the outbreak. Infected people with atypical symptoms can act as sources of the infection. Therefore, the epidemiological history of these patients should be sought in detail, and individuals with atypical symptoms in society should be identified as soon as possible in order to control the spreading of the disease.","Akpinar, Guleser; Demir, Mehmet C; Sultanoglu, Hasan; Unlu, Elif N; Oksuz, Sukru",Clinical laboratory,127,1

Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are currently widely considered as alternatives to antibiotics in the treatment of infections in aquatic animals. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the effects of NKL-24, a truncated peptide derived from zebrafish NK-lysin, against Yesso scallop (Patinopecten yessoensis) pathogen, Vibrio parahaemolyticus. The results showed that NKL-24 had a potent antibacterial effect against V. parahaemolyticus via a membrane active cell-killing mechanism. The in vitro study showed that sub-lethal levels of NKL-24 obviously reduced bacterial swimming ability and downregulated the transcription of the selected genes associated with V. parahaemolyticus virulence. Studies on NKL-24 biosafety in hemocytes and in Yesso scallop have shown no adverse effects from this peptide. Bacteria challenge test results demonstrated that NKL-24 significantly decreased the mortality and inhibited bacterial growth in the scallop infected with V. parahaemolyticus, while further in vivo examination revealed that NKL-24 could enhance non-specific immune parameters. Moreover, NKL-24 was capable of modulating a series of V. parahaemolyticus-responsive genes in the scallop. These results suggest the protective action of NKL-24 against V. parahaemolyticus and the potential of this peptide as a promising candidate for aquaculture applications.","Shan, Zhongguo; Yang, Yanpeng; Guan, Ning; Xia, Xiaodong; Liu, Weidong",Fish & shellfish immunology,127,17

Proper setting of flow boundary conditions in computational hemodynamic models of coronary arteries is one of the sources of uncertainty weakening the findings of in silico experiments, in consequence of the challenging task of obtaining in vivo 3D flow measurements within the clinical framework. Accordingly, in this study we evaluated the influence of assumptions on inflow velocity profile shape on coronary artery hemodynamics. To do that, (1) ten left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) geometries were reconstructed from clinical angiography, and (2) eleven velocity profiles with realistic 3D features such as eccentricity and differently shaped (single- and double-vortex) secondary flows were generated analytically and imposed as inflow boundary conditions. Wall shear stress and helicity-based descriptors obtained prescribing the commonly used parabolic velocity profile were compared with those obtained with the other velocity profiles. Our findings indicated that the imposition of idealized velocity profiles as inflow boundary condition is acceptable as long the results of the proximal vessel segment are not considered, in LAD coronary arteries. As a pragmatic rule of thumb, a conservative estimation of the length of influence of the shape of the inflow velocity profile on LAD local hemodynamics can be given by the theoretical entrance length for cylindrical conduits in laminar flow conditions.","Lodi Rizzini, Maurizio; Gallo, Diego; De Nisco, Giuseppe; D'Ascenzo, Fabrizio; Chiastra, Claudio; Bocchino, Pier Paolo; Piroli, Francesco; De Ferrari, Gaetano Maria; Morbiducci, Umberto",Medical engineering & physics,127,1

One of the factors questioned is also to be the factors affecting the disease course. In this study, our aim is to determine the factors that affect the course of the disease in the hospitalized patients due to COVID 19 infection and to reveal whether the seasonal change has an effect on the disease course. METHODS Our study was conducted on 1950 PCR test positive patients who were hospitalized for Covid-19 disease between March 16 and July 15. RESULTS As the seasonal temperature increases, decrease in WBC, PLT and albumin levels and increase in LDH and AST levels were observed. Risk of need for ICU has been found statistically significant (p<0.05) with the increase in the age, LDH levels and CRP levels and with the decrease in the Ca and Albumin levels. CONCLUSIONS It is predicted with these results that, seasonal change might have affects on the clinical course of the disease, although it has no affect on the spread of the disease. And it might beneficial to check biochemical parameters such as LDH, CRP, Ca and Albumin to predict the course of the disease.","Solmaz, Ihsan; Özçaylak, Süleyman; Alakuş, Ömer Faruk; Kılıç, Jehat; Kalın, Burhan Sami; Güven, Mehmet; Araç, Songül; Akkoç, Hasan",International journal of clinical practice,127,1

However, evidence shows that some communities are less likely to comply with such instructions than others. This study highlights the factors related to intentions to comply with newly issued health directives during an ongoing extreme crisis, such as the current pandemic. In addition, it compares the impact of these factors on different minority groups and the general population in Israel. METHODS Using an online survey (N=1005), we examined the impact of compliance-related factors on compliance intentions with newly issued health directives in two minority groups in Israel: the ultra-Orthodox Jewish community (N=323) and the Arab community (N=361), as well as in the general population (N=321), during the first outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Participants were presented with a new made-up COVID-19-related instruction simulated to be issued by the Israeli Ministry of Health. Compliance intentions and compliance-related factors were measured. RESULTS The Arab minority expressed greater intentions of complying with the instructions than the other groups. Perceptions on risk and the effectiveness of the instruction were the only two significantly associated factors with compliance intentions in all of the social groups. Additional factors affected different groups to different extents. Trust in government was related to compliance intentions only in the Arab minority. CONCLUSION Intentions to comply with health instructions during a crisis differ in various minority groups and in comparison to the general population, both in their levels and in the factors related to them. Policy-makers and health authorities should consider providing information about the risks and negative outcomes of the crisis as well as the expected effectiveness of the recommended behaviors.

METHODS Twenty-four Sprague-Dawley female rats underwent bladder and epidural catheter implantation. Five days later, cystometry was performed using continuous infusion. Anesthesia with isoflurane, ketamine-xylazine (KX) or fentanyl-fluanisone-midazolam (FFM) was used. After three micturition cycles, intrathecal bupivacaine was administered leading to the suppression of reflex bladder contractions. LPP measurements were performed using vertical tilt. After the initial LPP measurement, animals underwent partial resection of the striated urethral sphincter. The effect was evaluated 6 weeks after surgery, by repeating the LPP measurement in the same animal. RESULTS Ten out of 19 animals showed full micturition cycles under isoflurane, and all 9 animals under KX anesthesia. No significant difference in micturition pressures (Mean ± SEM; 30.1 ± 2.3 vs. 26.8 ± 1.6 mmHg) and LPP (31.0 ± 2.4 vs. 28.0 ± 0.9 mmHg) was observed between isoflurane and KX groups, respectively. Reflex micturition was suppressed with FFM. Bupivacaine led to overflow incontinence in all cases. Sphincter injury caused fibrotic changes and a significant increase in LPP (26.4 ± 2.3 before vs. 46.9 ± 4.6 mmHg after injury, p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS KX anesthesia preserves bladder contractions. Intrathecal bupivacaine eliminates reflex micturition, allowing for repeated LPP measurements in the same animal. Resection of striated sphincter resulted in increased LPP 6 weeks post injury.

Single-center prospective comparison of right- and left-sided transperitoneal hand-assisted laparoscopic donor nephrectomy (HALDN) is presented. PATIENTS AND METHODS Eighty-two living kidney donors underwent HALDN between 2003 and 2008. Right-sided HALDN was performed in 46 living kidney donors. The operative technique of right-sided HALDN was modified to obtain the maximum length of right renal vessels. Outcome data in donors including quality of life as well as graft outcome in recipients were prospectively collected. RESULTS All procedures were laparoscopically completed with no conversion. Mean operative time was 127 minutes (vs. 138 minutes in left HALDN, p = 0.08). The mean warm ischemia time was 41 seconds (vs. 39 seconds in left HALDN, p = 0.23). There was no renal artery or vein thrombosis in any of the grafts. Mean blood loss was 81 mL (vs. 92 mL in left HALDN, p = 0.09). Hospital discharge was on an average of 3.6 days postoperative. Delayed graft function occurred in two recipients: one in the left group and the other in the right group. One-year graft survival rate was 95% in the left group versus 96.9% in the right group (p = 0.08). Further, no statistically significant difference in serum levels of creatinine was seen between the groups 1 year after the transplantation. CONCLUSIONS Right HALDN is technically safe and feasible and results in convenient extension of right renal vessels to full length with no increased incidence of vascular thrombosis.","Hoda, M Raschid; Greco, Francesco; Reichelt, Olaf; Heynemann, Hans; Fornara, Paolo",Journal of endourology,127,1

METHODS This study was conducted in 3 tertiary care referral centers. Since September 2009, we have performed laparoendoscopic single-site surgery in 24 patients diagnosed with ovarian endometriomas. A control group of patients with similar diagnoses who underwent traditional operative laparoscopy during the same period was included (n = 28). In the laparoendoscopic single-site surgery group, a multichannel port was inserted into the peritoneum through a 1.5- to 2.0-cm umbilical incision. RESULTS Patients in the laparoendoscopic single-site surgery group were significantly older (P = .04) and had a higher body mass index (P = .005). Both groups were comparable regarding history of abdominal surgery, lateral pelvic side wall involvement, and cul-de-sac involvement. After we controlled for age and body mass index, the size of the resected endometriomas, duration of surgery, and amount of operative blood loss were comparable in both groups. When required, an additional 5-mm port was inserted in the right or left lower quadrant in the laparoendoscopic single-site surgery group to allow the use of a third instrument for additional tissue retraction or manipulation (10 of 24 patients, 41.6%). However, adhesiolysis was performed more frequently in the conventional laparoscopy group. The duration of hospital stay was <24 hours in both groups. No intraoperative complications were encountered. All incisions healed and were cosmetically satisfactory. CONCLUSION The laparoendoscopic single-site surgery technique is a reasonable initial approach for the treatment of endometriomas. In our experience, an additional side port is usually needed to treat pelvic side wall and cul-de-sac endometriosis that often accompanies endometriomas.","Bedaiwy, Mohamed A; Farghaly, Tarek; Hurd, William; Liu, James; Mansour, Gihan; Fader, Amanda Nickles; Escobar, Pedro",JSLS : Journal of the Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons,127,1

Case series of sleeve gastrectomy (SG) with a transumbilical approach (TUSG) has been reported with various techniques. The objective of this report is to present the technique, surgical results, and 1-year follow-up results of simplified TUSG using rigid instruments. METHODS All of the patients who had undergone SG since July 2010 were offered a transumbilical approach. The operative technique involves a transumbilical incision and the introduction of a SILS® or GelPoint® multiport and a 5-mm metallic accessory trocar laterally in the left flank. Rigid instruments were used in all patients. Gastric transection was made 4-5 cm proximal to the pylorus, calibrated with a 36-Fr bougie. Selected hemostasis to the staple line was achieved with metallic clips. RESULTS A total of 237 patients underwent TUSG. Patient body mass index ranged from 30 to 46 kg/m(2). The mean operative time was 49.5 ± 14.9 min. Six patients presented with early complications, including hemoperitoneum in three cases, antral leak in one case, intestinal perforation in one case, and portal vein thrombosis in one case. Conversion to the multitrocar technique was required in one patient. There were no mortalities. The mean length of hospital stay was 2.2 ± 1 days. The cosmetic result was satisfactory for all of the patients. CONCLUSIONS TUSG is a safe and feasible procedure using the described technique. The insertion of a 5-mm assistance trocar simplifies the procedure, allowing the use of rigid instruments.","Farías, Carlos; Fernández, José Ignacio; Ovalle, Cristián; Cabrera, Carolina; de la Maza, Jaime; Kosiel, Karin; Molina, Ana María",Obesity surgery,127,1

Accurately simulating the rules of water invasion and drainage gas recovery countermeasures in fractured WDGRs, thereby revealing the mechanism of water invasion and an appropriate development strategy, is important for formulating water management measures and enhancing the recovery of gas reservoirs. In this work, physical simulation methods were proposed to gain a better understanding of water invasion and to optimize the water control of fractured WDGRs. Five groups of experiments were designed and conducted to probe the impacts of the distance between the fractures and the gas well, the drainage position, the drainage timing and the aquifer size on the water invasion and production performance of a gas reservoir. The gas and water production and the internal pressure drop were monitored in real time during the experiments. Based on the above experimental works, a theoretical analysis was conducted to quantitatively evaluate the performance of the gas reservoir recovery via the gas well production performance, water invasion, dynamic pressure drop and residual gas and water distribution analysis. The results show that when the fracture scale was appropriate, a gas well drilled close to a fracture (Experiment 1-3) or a high-permeability formation could also produce gas and achieve drainage efficiently. The recovery factor of Experiment 1-3 reached 62.5%, which was 24.6% and 21.1% higher than those of Experiments 1-1 and 1-2, respectively, which had wells drilled in low-permeability areas. Draining water near an aquifer can effectively inhibit water invasion during the early stage of gas recovery. The setup in Experiment 2-1 effectively inhibited water invasion and avoided the formation of water-sealed volumes of gas to recover 30% more gas than recovered with that of Experiment 1-1 without drainage wells. A shorter distance between the drainage well and the aquifer increased the drainage capacity and decreased the gas production capacity, respectively (Well 2 at Point A vs Point B).

For example, due to an infinitely large aquifer, the reserves in Experiment 4-1 were developed by a single well, the gas recovery was only 33.4%.

METHODS A total of 37 female Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into 8 groups: sham stimulation; 5, 250, and 2000 Hz stimulation with 1.5- or 2.0-mA intensity; and a group instilled with capsaicin in the bladder. Using a recently developed bladder sensory threshold device, sine wave electrical stimulation was applied for 90 minutes to the rat bladder. The spinal cord was harvested after the rats were killed. The Fos-IR cells in the spinal regions of the medial dorsal horn, lateral dorsal horn, dorsal commissure, and sacral parasympathetic nucleus were measured. The distributions of the Fos-IR neurons were compared. RESULTS The maximal expression of Fos-IR cells, induced by 250- and 5-Hz stimulation of the bladder, was found at L6 of the spinal cord and was significantly greater than that in the control group (P<.01). Stimulation with 2000 Hz did not induce any Fos-IR cells. Fos-IR neurons were predominantly seen in the sacral parasympathetic nucleus region in response to 250-Hz stimulation and in the dorsal commissure region in response to 5-Hz stimulation. The number of positive neurons was similar to the number caused by capsaicin instillation. CONCLUSION Frequency-specific sine wave electrical stimulation of the rat bladder induced the expression of Fos-IR cells in a neuroselective manner. The bladder sensory threshold device could be used for exploration of the pathophysiology of diseases with disturbances of the afferent pathway of the bladder.","Yamada, Yasuhiro; Ukimura, Osamu; Liu, Guiming; Miki, Tsuneharu; Daneshgari, Firouz",Urology,127,27

Forty CX3CR1GFP/+ mice were randomly divided into 8 groups. In addition to the normal group, the rest of groups were receiving laser treatment. The retina and choroid from the second, third, fourth and fifth group of mice were taken in the 1, 4, 7, 14 days after laser treatment. The mice in the sixth and seventh group received intravitreal injection of 2 µl PPADS or PBS respectively immediately after laser treatment. The mice in the eighth group received topical application of PPADS once per day of three days. The mice in sixth, seventh and eighth group received AF and FFA examination on the fourth day after laser treatment. Immunofluorescence histochemical staining and real-time quantitative PCR were used to evaluate P2 expression and its effect on choroidal neovascularization. After laser treatment, activated microglia can express P2 receptors (P2X4, P2X7, P2Y2 and P2Y12). The expression of P2 increased on the first day after laser damage, peaked on the fourth day (tP2X4 = 6.05, tP2X7 = 2.95, tP2Y2 = 3.67, tP2Y12 = 5.98, all P < 0.01), and then decreased. After PPADS inhibition, compared with the PBS injection group, the mRNA of P2X4, P2X7, P2Y2 and P2Y12 were decreased significantly in the PPADS injection group (tP2X4 = 5.54, tP2X7 = 9.82, tP2Y2 = 3.86, tP2Y12 = 7.91, all P < 0.01) and the PPADS topical application group (tP2X4 = 3.24, tP2X7 = 5.89, tP2Y2 = 6.75, tP2Y12 = 4.97, all P < 0.01). Compared with the PBS injection group, not only the activity of microglia cells but also the leakage of CNV decreased significantly (P < 0.01) in the PPADS injection group and the PPADS topical application group. But between two PPADS groups, the leakage of CNV had no difference (P = 0.864). After laser induced CNV, activated microglia can express P2 receptors. The P2 receptor inhibitor, PPADS, can significantly affect the function of microglia and inhibit the formation of choroidal neovascularization.","Li, Lu; Liu, Juejun; Xu, Amin; Heiduschka, Peter; Eter, Nicole; Chen, Changzheng",Scientific reports,127,1

The scientific community has pointed out concerns related to suboptimal performance of certain tests, although a selection of tests with sensitivity and specificity of >99% is available. Neutralizing antibodies represent a generally accepted surrogate marker of immunological protection against viral infections. In COVID-19, we argue that focusing only on neutralizing antibodies may not be necessary and that evidence of spontaneous clearance of COVID-19 may be a reliable surrogate marker of individuals' immune competency toward future reinfections (regardless of its mechanism) for a period of time. Furthermore, current polymerase chain reaction testing lacks the ability to determine the duration of transmissibility, thus alternatives for direct testing of replicating virus are needed. Broadly applied viable virus testing together with serosurveillance will help reopen the economy with more precision and speed, and help guide isolation, quarantine, and cohorting protocols in conglomerate settings such as correctional facilities, nursing facilities, schools, and long-distance travel.","Krsak, Martin; Henao-Martínez, Andrés F; Franco-Paredes, Carlos",Viral immunology,127,16

We have observed an increase in vertigo consultations during this period, mainly benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. Objective To determine the impact of preventive lockdown on the prevalence and characteristics of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. Methods We did a retrospective study. All patients with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo during July and August 2020 who visited the clinic in Red de Salud UC Christus, Santiago, Chile, were included. Demographic data, clinical characteristics, need for repositioning maneuvers, and medical history was compared with patients seen in July and August 2019. Cases secondary to trauma and with incomplete records were excluded. Results During July and August 2020, 99 patients consulted with a medical history compatible with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, average age 54.5 years, 68.9% were female. Repositioning maneuvers were required in 40.2% of cases. Of 28 patients with vitamin D levels, 27 showed deficiency/insufficiency. In 2019, for July and August, 54 patients were seen in the clinic with an average age of 61.7 years, and 83.3% were female. Repositioning maneuvers were required in 79.6%, and of the nine patients with vitamin D levels, seven presented deficiency/insufficiency. Statistically significant differences were observed regarding age, sex, and need for repositioning maneuvers. Conclusions A high prevalence of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo was observed during preventive lockdown for COVID-19 in our clinic. Patients were generally younger, and although it was more frequent in women, the incidence by sex was not as striking as in the previous year.","Waissbluth, Sofia; García-Huidobro, Francisco; Araya-Céspedes, Macarena",Medwave,127,17

An understanding of the pathogenesis and the development of treatment strategies is of high interest. Recently, neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) have been identified as a potential driver of severe SARS-CoV-2 infections in humans. NETs are extracellular DNA fibers released by neutrophils after contact with various stimuli and accumulate antimicrobial substances or host defense peptides. When massively released, NETs are described to contribute to immunothrombosis in acute respiratory distress syndrome and in vascular occlusions. Based on the increasing evidence that NETs contribute to severe COVID-19 cases, DNase treatment of COVID-19 patients to degrade NETs is widely discussed as a potential therapeutic strategy. Here, we discuss potential detrimental effects of NETs and their nuclease degradation, since NET fragments can boost certain bacterial coinfections and thereby increase the severity of the disease.","de Buhr, Nicole; von Köckritz-Blickwede, Maren",mBio,127,1

This secondary exploratory study is focused on the influence of nerve identification and handling on post-operative pain. METHODS Post-operative VAS pain data and Surgical Pain Scores (SPS) from 507 patients included in this study were analyzed according to whether inguinal nerves were preserved or resected during surgery to investigate whether identification and peri-operative nerve handling impact post-operative pain. RESULTS Preservation of the ilio-hypogastric nerve during Lichtenstein mesh repair with suture fixation was associated with significantly more post-operative pain compared with resection at each follow-up (p ≤ 0.003). This difference was not significant with self-gripping mesh repair. The decrease from baseline in post-operative VAS and SPS scores were significantly greater after self-gripping mesh repair compared to Lichtenstein repair at 1 year, but only when the ilio-hypogastric nerve was preserved (VAS scores, p = 0.009; SPS scores, p = 0.015). No such difference was observed with the ilio-inguinal nerve. When self-gripping mesh was used, preservation of the ilio-hypogastric nerve was associated with significantly greater decreases in post-operative pain (change in VAS score from baseline) compared with Lichtenstein repair at each follow-up (p ≤ 0.018). CONCLUSIONS The ilio-hypogastric nerve is in danger of being traumatized during Lichtenstein mesh repair with suture fixation. The use of self-gripping mesh was shown to reduce the level of post-operative pain when the ilio-hypogastric nerve was preserved. Resection of the ilio-hypogastric nerve during Lichtenstein repair eliminates this difference.","Smeds, S; Nienhuijs, S; Kullman, E; Sanders, D L; Lehnert, T; Ziprin, P; Gingell-Littlejohn, M; Miserez, M; Kingsnorth, A",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,127,1

Fusion images of pre- and post-RFA dynamic CT, and pre- and post-RFA Gd-EOB-DTPA-MRI were created, using a rigid registration method. The minimal ablative margin measured on fusion imaging was categorized into three groups: (1) tumor protruding outside the ablation zone boundary, (2) ablative margin 0-<5.0 mm beyond the tumor boundary, and (3) ablative margin ≥5.0 mm beyond the tumor boundary. The categorization of minimal ablative margins was compared between CT and MR fusion images. RESULTS In 57 (62.0%) HCCs, treatment evaluation was possible both on CT and MR fusion images, and the overall agreement between them for the categorization of minimal ablative margin was good (κ coefficient = 0.676, P < 0.01). MR fusion imaging enabled treatment evaluation in a significantly larger number of HCCs than CT fusion imaging (86/92 [93.5%] vs. 62/92 [67.4%], P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS Fusion of pre- and post-ablation Gd-EOB-DTPA-MRI is feasible for treatment evaluation after RFA. It may enable accurate treatment evaluation in cases where CT fusion imaging is not helpful.","Makino, Yuki; Imai, Yasuharu; Igura, Takumi; Hori, Masatoshi; Fukuda, Kazuto; Sawai, Yoshiyuki; Kogita, Sachiyo; Fujita, Norihiko; Takehara, Tetsuo; Murakami, Takamichi",Abdominal imaging,127,8

METHODS A systematic literature review was conducted using MEDLINE Complete, PsycINFO, EMBASE and AMED. We included articles investigating the impact of the condition on quality of life, symptoms, visual functioning, activities of daily living, well-being, social functioning, and financial status. The studies evaluated were observational, including cross-sectional, prospective cohort and retrospective cohort designs. Outcome data were extracted and synthesized. RESULTS Searches yielded 5114 publications. After screening, 85 studies were included, measuring the following outcomes: visual functioning (n=41); quality of life (n=23); well-being (n=16); functional status (n=14); work (n=2); and visual task performance (n=2). Diabetic retinopathy has a considerable impact on visual functioning and this is greater in people with greater disease severity. Diabetic retinopathy significantly limits activities including working, driving, walking and reading, and has the potential to have a negative impact on psychological well-being. CONCLUSIONS Diabetic retinopathy is associated with poor self-reported visual functioning, well-being, and health-related quality of life.

Here, we report on the feasibility and safety of a new method of long-term repetitive intralymphatic (IL) infusion of immune cells, using implantable delivery ports. METHODS Nine patients with stage IV recurrent colorectal cancer underwent complete resection and received autologous dendritic cells (DCs) loaded with killed autologous tumor cells, KLH and PADRE, for up to four monthly cycles. Leg lymphatic vessels were cannulated, connected to 6.6Fr low-profile implantable subcutaneous delivery ports, and used to infuse 12 doses of DC over each 72 h-long cycle (every 6 h), followed by heparin flushes of the cannula-port system (one 72 h-long cycle per month). The patients who opted for alternative route of vaccine administration (2 patients) or whose ports became non-functional between cycles, continued treatment via intranodal (one injection/cycle) or intradermal (four injections/cycle) routes. RESULTS A total of nine lymphatic cannulations and implantations of subcutaneous delivery ports were attempted in seven patients, with a success rate of eight out of nine (89 %). The average patency of the IL delivery system was 7.5 (±3.2) weeks. All six patients with IL ports successfully completed at least one complete 72 h-long DC infusion cycle (12 injections). Five patients (56 %) completed two full IL cycles (24 IL injections). No patients received more than two IL cycles without replacement of the IL port, due to catheter occlusion and/or local side effects: cellulitis and hematoma. Intranodal and intradermal backup options were used in, respectively, one and two patients. Overall cohort survival was >28 (±25) months. One patient with aggressive recurrent carcinomatosis, who received DC vaccines by intranodal route is alive at > 90 months, without evidence of disease. CONCLUSIONS We conclude that an intermediate-duration IL delivery of multiple doses of immunotherapeutic factors using implantable delivery ports is feasible, highly-tolerable and can be reproducibly performed in cancer patients to administer immune cells, or potentially, other immune factors. However, long-term IL port placement (>7.5 weeks), is not a currently-feasible option.

In addition to their role in fermentation, plant PDCs have also been hypothesized to be involved in aroma formation although, to date, there is no direct biochemical evidence for this function. We investigated the role of PDCs in fruit volatile biosynthesis, and identified a melon pyruvate decarboxylase, PDC1, that is highly expressed in ripe fruits. In vitro biochemical characterization of the recombinant PDC1 enzyme showed that it could not only decarboxylate pyruvate, but that it also had significant activity toward other straight- and branched-chain α-ketoacids, greatly expanding the range of substrates previously known to be accepted by the plant enzyme. RNAi-mediated transient and stable silencing of PDC1 expression in melon showed that this gene is involved in acetaldehyde, propanal and pentanal production, while it does not contribute to branched-chain amino acid (BCAA)-derived aldehyde biosynthesis in melon fruit. Importantly, our results not only demonstrate additional functions for the PDC enzyme, but also challenge the long standing hypothesis that PDC is involved in BCAA-derived aldehyde formation in fruit.","Wang, Minmin; Zhang, Lei; Boo, Kyung Hwan; Park, Eunsook; Drakakaki, Georgia; Zakharov, Florence",The Plant journal : for cell and molecular biology,127,1

However, the typical repair model utilizes an acute injury. In recognition of that distinction, our laboratory developed an overuse animal model; however it is unclear whether induced overuse is necessary in the repair model. We studied the repair properties of overuse-induced tendons compared to normal tendons. We hypothesized that histological and mechanical properties would not be altered between the overuse-induced and normal tendons 1 and 4 weeks after repair. Thirty-one adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to either overuse or cage activity for 4 weeks prior to bilateral supraspinatus tendon repair surgery. Rats were sacrificed at 1 and 4 weeks post-surgery and evaluated for histology and mechanics. Results at 1 week showed no clear histologic changes, but increased inflammatory protein expression in overuse tendons. At 4 weeks, percent relaxation was slightly increased in the overuse group. No other alterations in mechanics or histology were observed. Our results suggest that the effects of the surgical injury overshadow the changes evoked by overuse. Because clinically relevant mechanical parameters were not altered in the overuse group, we conclude that when examining tendons 4 weeks after repair in the classic rat supraspinatus model, inducing overuse prior to surgery is likely to be unnecessary.","Tucker, Jennica J; Riggin, Corinne N; Connizzo, Brianne K; Mauck, Robert L; Steinberg, David R; Kuntz, Andrew F; Soslowsky, Louis J; Bernstein, Joseph",Journal of orthopaedic research : official publication of the Orthopaedic Research Society,127,1

However, limited information is available for miRNAs from Lonicera japonica, which is widely used in East Asian countries owing to various pharmaceutically active secondary metabolites. Selection of suitable reference genes for quantification of target miRNA expression through quantitative real-time (qRT)-PCR is important for elucidating the molecular mechanisms of secondary metabolic regulation in different tissues and varieties of L. japonica. For precise normalization of gene expression data in L. japonica, 16 candidate miRNAs were examined in three tissues, as well as 21 cultivated varieties collected from 16 production areas, using GeNorm, NormFinder, and RefFinder algorithms. Our results revealed combination of u534122 and u3868172 as the best reference genes across all samples. Their specificity was confirmed by detecting the cycling threshold (C t) value ranges in different varieties of L. japonica collected from diverse production areas, suggesting the use of these two reference miRNAs is sufficient for accurate transcript normalization with different tissues, varieties, and production areas. To our knowledge, this is the first report on validation of reference miRNAs in honeysuckle (Lonicera spp.). Restuls from this study can further facilitate discovery of functional regulatory miRNAs in different varieties of L. japonica.","Wang, Yaolong; Liu, Juan; Wang, Xumin; Liu, Shuang; Wang, Guoliang; Zhou, Junhui; Yuan, Yuan; Chen, Tiying; Jiang, Chao; Zha, Liangping; Huang, Luqi",Frontiers in plant science,127,19

A deeper knowledge about the shift in cellular metabolism of Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infected cells could provide new insights about its pathogenic and host response and help to diagnose pulmonary involvement. We explored the association between metabolic and structural changes of lung parenchyma in asymptomatic cancer patients with suspected COVID-19 pneumonia, as a potential added diagnostic value of fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET/CT) scans in this subpopulation. Methods: Within the period of February 19 and May 29, 2020 18F-FDG PET/CT studies were reviewed to identify those cancer patients with suggestive incidental findings of COVID-19 pneumonia. PET studies were interpreted through qualitative (visual) and semiquantitative analysis (measurement of maximum standardized uptake value, SUVmax) evaluating lung findings. Several characteristic signs of COVID-19 pneumonia on computed tomography (CT) were described as COVID-19 Reporting and Data System (CO-RADS) categories (1-6). After comparing SUVmax values of pulmonary infiltrates among different CO-RADS categories, we explored the best potential cut-off values of pulmonary SUVmax against CO-RADS categories as ""gold standard"" result to discard the diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia. Results: CT signs classified as CO-RADS category 5 or 6 were found in 16/41 (39%) oncological patients derived to multimodal PET/CT imaging. SUVmax was higher in patients with CO-RADS 5 and 6 vs. 4 (6.17±0.82 vs. 3.78±0.50, P = 0.04) and vs. 2 and 3 categories (3.59±0.41, P = 0.01). A specificity of 93.8% (IC 95%: 71.7-99.7%) and an accuracy of 92.9% were obtained when combining a CO-RADS score 5-6 with a SUVmax of 2.45 in pulmonary infiltrates. Conclusion: In asymptomatic cancer patients, the metabolic activity in lung infiltrates is closely associated with several combined tomographic changes characteristic of COVID-19 pneumonia. Multimodal 18F-FDG PET/CT imaging could provide additional information during early diagnosis in selected predisposed patients during pandemic. The prognostic implications of simultaneous radiological and molecular findings in cancer and other high-risk subpopulations for COVID-19 pneumonia deserve further evaluation in prospective researches.","Wakfie-Corieh, Cristina Gamila; Ferrando-Castagnetto, Federico; Blanes Garcia, Alba Maria; Garcia-Esquinas, Marta Garcia; Ortega Candil, Aida; Rodriguez Rey, Cristina; Cabrera Martin, Maria Nieves; Delgado Cano, Ana; Carreras Delgado, Jose Luis","Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine",127,31

Microglia initiate neurotropic coronavirus clearance from the CNS, but the role of infiltrating macrophages is not well understood. Here, using mice lacking cell-specific expression of DP1, the receptor for prostaglandin D2 (PGD2), we delineate the relative roles of PGD2 signaling in microglia and macrophages in murine coronavirus-infected mice. We show that the absence of PGD2/DP1 signaling on microglia recapitulated the suboptimal immune response observed in global DP1-/- mice. Unexpectedly, the absence of the DP1 receptor on macrophages had an opposite effect, resulting in enhanced activation and more rapid virus clearance. However, microglia are still required for disease resolution, even when macrophages are highly activated, in part because they are required for macrophage recruitment to sites of infection. Together, these results identify key differences in the effects of PGD2/DP1 signaling on microglia and macrophages and illustrate the complex relationship between the two types of myeloid cells. IMPORTANCE Current understanding about the roles of microglia versus macrophages in viral encephalitis is limited. We previously showed that the signaling of a single prostaglandin, PGD2, through its DP1 receptor on myeloid cells is critical for optimal immune responses in infected mice. Here, we demonstrate that the specific ablation of the DP1 receptor on macrophages and microglia had markedly different effects on outcomes. DP1-/- macrophages exhibited greater phagocytic properties than controls, resulting in enhanced kinetics of virus clearance, while DP1 absence on microglia resulted in increased lethality. Microglia were still required for protection, even when DP1 was not expressed on macrophages. These results suggest that therapeutic strategies directed at specific myeloid subsets in the brain may be useful in the context of viral infections.","Verma, Abhishek Kumar; Zheng, Jian; Mack, Matthias; Ginhoux, Florent; Perlman, Stanley",mBio,127,1

In the present study, feasibility, safety, and efficacy of angioplasty using a drug-eluting balloon (DEB) followed by the implantation of a self-expanding stent (Enterprise) were evaluated for the treatment of ICAD lesions. METHODS Fifty-two patients (median age: 71 years; range: 54-86 years; male/female ratio 37:15) underwent stenting of high-grade ICAD lesions between February 2010 and November 2011 in a single center. Angioplasty using a paclitaxel coated SeQuent Please (B. Braun, Germany) or DIOR (Eurocor, Germany) coronary PTCA balloon, followed by the implantation of a self-expanding stent (Enterprise, Codman, USA) was performed in 54 lesions. Angiographic and clinical follow-up was performed at 6 and 12 weeks, 6 and 12 months, and yearly thereafter. Technical success rate, periprocedural complications, occurrence of recurrent ischemic symptoms, and the development of an ISR were analyzed. RESULTS Angioplasty using a DEB followed by stent implantation was successfully performed in 44 (81 %) cases. DEB insertion failed in 19 % of the cases and angioplasty was finally performed using a conventional PTCA balloon. The combined procedure related permanent neurologic morbidity and mortality rate (stroke, ICH, and subarachnoid hemorrhage) at 30 days and beyond was 5 %. Angiographic and clinical follow-up were obtained in 33 (61 %) lesions in 32 patients. Recurrent stenosis was seen in one (3 %) lesion. CONCLUSION Angioplasty and stenting using a DEB is safe and yields encouragingly low ISR rates. Further technical developments to improve lesion accessibility are, nevertheless, mandatory.","Vajda, Zsolt; Güthe, Thomas; Perez, Marta Aguilar; Kurre, Wiebke; Schmid, Elisabeth; Bäzner, Hansjörg; Henkes, Hans",Cardiovascular and interventional radiology,127,1

Furthermore, conventional four-port laparoscopic cholecystectomy is developing into a single-port procedure. However, in many developing countries, disposable medical products are expensive and adequate medical waste disposable facilities are absent. Advanced medical treatments such as laparoscopic or single-port surgeries are not readily available in many areas of developing countries, and there are often no other sterilization methods besides autoclaving. Moreover, existing reusable metallic ports are impractical and are thus not widely used. MATERIAL AND METHODS We developed a novel controllable, multidirectional single-port device that can be autoclaved, and with a wide working space, which was employed in five patients. RESULTS In all patients, laparoscopic cholecystectomy was accomplished without complications. CONCLUSION Our device facilitates single-port surgery in areas of the world with limited sterilization methods and offers a novel alternative to conventional tools for creating a smaller incision, decrease postoperative pain, and improve cosmesis. This novel device can also lower the cost of medical treatment and offers a promising tool for major surgeries requiring a wide working space.","Hosaka, Seiji; Ohdaira, Takeshi; Umemoto, Satoshi; Hashizume, Makoto; Kawamoto, Shunji",Minimally invasive therapy & allied technologies : MITAT : official journal of the Society for Minimally Invasive Therapy,127,1

OBJECTIVE To report the collective experience of using PED to treat distal anterior circulation aneurysms. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed clinical and radiographic records of all patients who underwent Pipeline embolization of distal anterior circulation aneurysms at 10 US neurosurgical centers between 2011 and 2013. RESULTS Twenty-eight patients (mean age 51.7 years; 18 women) with 28 aneurysms were included in the analyses. Fifteen aneurysms were fusiform, 5 dissecting, and 8 saccular. Average aneurysm size was 12.3 mm; 7 were giant. Twenty aneurysms were located along the middle cerebral artery, 6 along the anterior cerebral artery, and 2 along the anterior communicating artery. PED deployment was successful in 27 patients, with coils utilized in 6 cases. Clinical follow-up was available for an average of 10.7 months (range 3-26). Twenty-seven patients had follow-up neurovascular imaging: 21 aneurysms had complete occlusion, 4 had residual neck filling, and 2 had residual dome filling. Periprocedural complications (<30 days) occurred in 3 patients (10.7%), including 1 case of device failure resulting in stroke. Outcomes were good (modified Rankin Scale score 0 to 2) in 27 patients (96.4%) and fair (modified Rankin Scale 3) in 1.

DSM-5 proposes a melancholia specifier with phenotypic characteristics that could be associated with clinical progression, biological markers or therapeutic response. The Sydney Melancholia Prototype Index (SMPI) is a prototypic scale aimed to improve the diagnosis of melancholia. So far, there is only an English version of the instrument available. The aim of this study is to describe the translation and adaptation of the English version of the SMPI into Brazilian Portuguese. METHODS Translation and cross-cultural adaptation of the self-report (SMPI-SR) and clinician-rated (SMPI-CR) versions into Brazilian Portuguese were done following recommendations of the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR). This guideline includes the following steps: preparation, forward translation, reconciliation, back translation, back translation review, harmonization, cognitive debriefing, debriefing results review, proofreading and final report. RESULTS The Brazilian Portuguese versions of the SMPI were well-accepted by respondents. Changes in about two-thirds of the items were considered necessary to obtain the final Brazilian Portuguese version of the SMPI. CONCLUSIONS Both versions of the SMPI are now available in Brazilian Portuguese. The instrument could become an important option to enhance studies on melancholia in Portuguese-speaking samples.","Messinger, Mateus Frizzo; Caldieraro, Marco Antonio; Mosqueiro, Bruno Paz; da Costa, Felipe Bauer Pinto; Possebon, Gabriela Maria Pereira; Santos, Pedro Victor de Lima Nascimento; Parker, Gordon; Fleck, Marcelo P",Trends in psychiatry and psychotherapy,127,1

Pilot work showed that a peer-led physical activity intervention called PLAN-A was a promising method of increasing physical activity in secondary school age girls. This study examined the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the PLAN-A intervention. METHODS We conducted a cluster randomised controlled trial with Year 9 (13-14 year old) girls recruited from 20 secondary schools. Schools were randomly assigned to the PLAN-A intervention or a non-intervention control group after baseline data collection. Girls nominated students to be peer leaders. The top 18 % of girls nominated by their peers in intervention schools received three days of training designed to prepare them to support physical activity. Data were collected at two time points, baseline (T0) and 5-6 months post-intervention (T1). Participants wore an accelerometer for seven days to assess the primary outcome of mean weekday minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA). Multivariable mixed effects linear regression was used to estimate differences in the primary outcome between the two arms on an Intention-to-Treat (ITT) basis. Resource use and quality of life were measured and a within trial economic evaluation from a public sector perspective was conducted. RESULTS A total of 1558 girls were recruited to the study. At T0, girls in both arms engaged in an average of 51 min of MVPA per weekday. The adjusted mean difference in weekday MVPA at T1 was - 2.84 min per day (95 % CI = -5.94 to 0.25) indicating a slightly larger decline in weekday MVPA in the intervention group. Results were broadly consistent when repeated using a multiple imputation approach and for pre-specified secondary outcomes and sub-groups. The mean cost of the PLAN-A intervention was £2817 per school, equivalent to £31 per girl. Economic analyses indicated that PLAN-A did not lead to demonstrable cost-effectiveness in terms of cost per unit change in QALY. CONCLUSIONS This study has shown that the PLAN-A intervention did not result in higher levels of weekday MVPA or associated secondary outcomes among Year 9 girls. The PLAN-A intervention should not be disseminated as a public health strategy.

In 2006, we made the first report on a minimally invasive technique for kidney transplantation; restricted to a 7-9 cm transverse incision targeted on the anastomotic area of the iliac vessels, and with the meticulously prepared kidney placed in a fitting, retroperitoneal pouch lateral to the skin incision. MATERIALS AND METHODS By combining ""hand-assisted laparoscopic nephrectomy"" and ""minimally invasive kidney transplantation"" - using the same incision (7-8 cm) for hand-assistance, kidney harvesting, and transplantation - we have during 2009 conducted ""minimally invasive renal auto-transplantation"" in two patients. RESULTS In both cases, the postoperative course was uneventful. When examined 3 mo postoperatively, both auto-transplants were shown to have excellent function by renal scintigraphy. CONCLUSIONS Renal auto-transplantation, a traditionally major surgical procedure, can be made minimally invasive by a similar incision as that used for L-LDN.

Because several neurocognitive domains can only be thoroughly assessed from age 4 years onwards, we aimed to determine the effect of late-parenteral nutrition versus early-parenteral nutrition on physical, neurocognitive, and emotional and behavioural development 4 years after randomisation. METHODS This is a preplanned, blinded, 4-year follow-up study of participants included in the PEPaNIC trial (done at University Hospitals Leuven, Belgium; Erasmus Medical Centre Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, Netherlands; and Stollery Children's Hospital, Edmonton, AB, Canada) and of matched healthy children. Studied outcomes were anthropometrics; health status; parent-reported or caregiver-reported executive functions, and emotional and behavioural problems; and clinical tests for intelligence, visual-motor integration, alertness, motor coordination, and memory. Through multivariable linear and logistic regression analyses, after imputation for missing values (≤30%) and adjustment for risk factors, we investigated the effect of early-parenteral nutrition versus late-parenteral nutrition. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01536275. FINDINGS Between March 8, 2016, and Nov 8, 2019, 684 children from the original PEPaNIC trial (356 from the late-parenteral nutrition group and 328 from the early-parenteral nutrition group) were assessed for neurocognitive development at 4-years follow-up. Compared with the control group (369 healthy children), children who had critical illness had lower height (β-estimate -2·11 [95% CI -3·15 to -1·06]; p<0·0001) and head circumference (-0·42 [-0·67 to -0·18]; p=0.00077); and worse health status (eg, hospital admission odds ratio 4·27 [95% CI 3·12 to 5·84]; p<0·0001), neurocognitive (eg, parent-reported or caregiver-reported total executive functioning β-estimate 3·57 [95% CI 1·95 to 5·18], p<0·0001; total intelligence quotient -7·35 [-9·31 to -5·39], p<0·0001), and parent-reported or caregiver-reported emotional and behavioural developmental outcomes (internalising 2·73 [1·19 to 4·28], p=0·00055; externalising 1·63 [0·19 to 3·08], p=0·027; and total behavioural problems 2·95 [1·44 to 4·46], p=0·00013), adjusted for risk factors. Outcomes were never worse in the late-parenteral nutrition group compared with the early-parenteral nutrition group, but patients in the late-parenteral nutrition group had fewer parent-reported or caregiver-reported internalising (β-estimate -1·88 [95% CI -3·69 to -0·07]; p=0·042), externalising (-1·73 [-3·43 to -0·03]; p=0·046), and total emotional and behavioural problems (-2·44 [-4·22 to -0·67]; p=0·0070) than patients who had received early-parenteral nutrition, after adjusting for risk factors, and were no longer different from healthy controls for these outcomes.

The photocatalytic activities of both composites were then investigated through degradation of 4-nitrophenol (4-NP) in aqueous solutions under visible light irradiation. It was found that CuTEPyP/TNTAs could eliminate 95% 4-NP within 4 h, which was considerably higher than the yield obtained with CuTEPyP/TNTs (56%) under the same conditions. Compared to CuTEPyP/TNTs, the improved photocatalytic activity of CuTEPyP/TNTAs can be ascribed to increased light absorption, high separation rate of photo-generated charge pairs, and efficient charge transfer. A plausible photocatalytic degradation mechanism involving hydroxyl radicals, superoxide radical anions and singlet oxygen species was also proposed.

Population = adults and children/adolescents with burns of any aspect of their bodies. Interventions = any aerobic and/or strength exercises delivered as part of a rehabilitation programme by anyone (e.g. physiotherapists, occupational therapists, nurses, doctors, community workers and patients themselves). Comparators = any comparator. Outcomes = any measure of outcome (e.g. quality of life, pain, muscle strength, range of movement, fear or quality of movement). Settings = any setting in any country. METHODS/DESIGN A systematic review will be conducted by two blinded independent reviewers who will search articles on PubMed, CiNAHL, Cochrane library, Medline, Pedro, OTseeker, EMBASE, PsychINFO and EBSCOhost using predefined criteria. Studies of human participants of any age suffering from burns will be eligible, and there will be no restrictions on total body surface area. Only randomised controlled trials will be considered for this review, and the methodological quality of studies meeting the selection criteria will be evaluated using the Cochrane Collaboration tool for assessing risk of bias. The PRISMA reporting standards will be used to write the review. A narrative analysis of the findings will be done, but if pooling is possible, meta-analysis will be considered. DISCUSSION Burns may have a long-lasting impact on both psychological and physical functioning and thus it is important to identify and evaluate the effects of current and past aerobic and strength exercises on patients with burns. By identifying the characteristics of effective exercise programmes, guidelines can be suggested for developing intervention programmes aimed at improving the function of patients with burns. The safety and precautions of exercise regimes and the optimal frequency, duration, time and intensity will also be examined to inform further intervention.

We evaluated whether skin perfusion pressure (SPP) can be used for monitoring of adequacy of tissue perfusion in patients undergoing valvular heart surgery. Seventy-two patients undergoing valve replacement were enrolled. SPP and serum lactate level were assessed after anaesthesia induction (baseline), during CPB, after CPB-off, end of surgery, arrival at intensive care unit, and postoperative 6 h. Lactate was further measured until postoperative 48 h. Association of SPP with lactate and 30-day morbidity comprising myocardial infarction, acute kidney injury, stroke, prolonged intubation, sternal infection, reoperation, and mortality was assessed. Among the lactate levels, postoperative 6 h peak value was most closely linked to composite of 30-day morbidity. The SPP value during CPB and its % change from the baseline value were significantly associated with the postoperative 6 h peak lactate (r = -0.26, P = 0.030 and r = 0.47, P = 0.001, respectively). Optimal cut-off of % decrease in SPP during CPB from baseline value for the postoperative 6 h hyperlactatemia was 48% (area under curve, 0.808; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.652-0.963; P = 0.001). Decrease in SPP >48% during CPB from baseline value was associated with a 12.8-fold increased risk of composite endpoint of 30-day morbidity (95% CI, 1.48-111.42; P = 0.021) on multivariate logistic regression. Large decrease in SPP during CPB predicts postoperative 6 h hyperlactatemia and 30-day morbidity, which implicates a promising role of SPP monitoring in the achievement of optimal perfusion during CPB.","Song, Young; Soh, Sarah; Shim, Jae-Kwang; Park, Kyoung-Un; Kwak, Young-Lan",PloS one,127,1

Transmission of the stimulus to effector proteins must be coordinated, rapid and transient such that the response is not exaggerated and the overall balance of the cell or tissue is retained. Proteomics technology has traditionally been adept at analyzing effector proteins (such as cytoskeletal and heat shock proteins, and those involved in metabolic processes) in studies examining the effects of altered environmental or nutritional conditions, drugs, or genetic manipulation, since these proteins are often highly abundant, soluble and therefore amenable to analysis. Conversely, the proteins mediating the transmission of the signal have been generally under-represented, typically because of their low abundance. One mechanism that has overcome this to some extent is the advent of very high-resolution phosphoproteomics techniques, which have enabled temporal profiling of intracellular signal pathways via quantitative assessment of peptide phosphorylation sites. One group of proteins, however, that still remains under-represented in proteomics studies are those found in the plasma membrane (PM). Such proteins are crucial in sensing changes in the external environment and in stimulating the transmission of the signal intracellularly. This review examines PM proteins and appraises the proteomics approaches currently available for providing a comprehensive analysis of these crucial mediators of signal pathways. We discuss different strategies for enrichment and solubilization of these proteins and include discussion on cross-linking of PM complexes and glycoproteomics as the basis for purification prior to proteomic analyses.","Cordwell, Stuart J; Thingholm, Tine E",Proteomics,127,32

METHODS Systematic searches were performed in the databases PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and The Centre for Reviews and Dissemination database for relevant studies before May 2016. The quality of the methodological design was assessed with items regarding methodology from the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS). The systematic review was reported according to the PRISMA guidelines. RESULTS Thirty-two relevant studies were included. None of the reviewed studied fully complied with the CHEERS methodological checklist. Background and objectives, Target population and subgroups and Setting and location were covered in sufficient details in all studies whereas the Study perspective, Justification of the time horizon, Discount rate, and Estimating resources and costs were covered in less than 50%. Most of the studies (29/32) used the health care sector perspective whereas the societal perspective was applied in three studies. The time horizon was stated in 18/32 of the studies. CONCLUSIONS The methodological quality of studies evaluating costs of robotic surgery was low. The longest follow-up was 4 months and in general, the use of detailed cost data were lacking in most of the investigations. Key determinants, such as purchasing, maintenance costs of the robotic platform, and the use of surgical equipment, were rarely reported. If health care cost analyses lack transparency regarding cost drivers included it may not provide a true foundation for decision-making.","Korsholm, Malene; Sørensen, Jan; Mogensen, Ole; Wu, Chunsen; Karlsen, Kamilla; Jensen, Pernille T",Health economics review,127,29

The model, which makes use of a limited number of parameters, in spite of its simplicity is able of capturing the essential physical features of the epidemic spread highlighting the essential role of the restrictive measures and in particular the timeliness of their application for the containment of the most dramatic consequences. This work also confirms how the epidemic spread, if considered during its statistical-regime evolution, can be properly described - and hence probably better understood - using languages and methodologies typically adopted for chemical processes, such as the Mass Action Law and Chemical Kinetics.","Amadei, Andrea; Aschi, Massimiliano",Theoretical biology forum,127,27

The goal of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to examine the effectiveness of school-based intervention types perceived by Canadian stakeholders in health and education as feasible, acceptable and sustainable in terms of improving physical activity (PA), fruit and vegetable intake, and body weight. We searched multiple databases for studies that evaluated school-based interventions to prevent obesity and associated risk factors (i.e., unhealthy diet, physical inactivity, sedentary behaviour) in children aged 4-18 years from January 1, 2012 to January 28, 2020. From 10,871 identified records, we included 83 and 80 studies in our systematic review and meta-analysis, respectively. Comprehensive School Health (CSH) and interventions which focused on modifications to school nutrition policies showed statistically significant positive effects on fruit intake of 0.13 (95% CI: 0.04, 0.23) and 0.30 (95% CI: 0.1, 0.51) servings per day, respectively. No intervention types showed statistically significant effect on vegetable intake. CSH, modifications to physical education (PE) curriculum, and multicomponent interventions showed statistically significant difference in BMI of -0.26 (95% CI: -0.40, -0.12), -0.16 (95% CI: -0.3, -0.02), and -0.18 (95% CI: -0.29, -0.07), respectively. CSH interventions showed positive effect on step-count per day, but no other types of interventions showed significant effect on any of PA outcome measures. Thus, the results of this systematic review and meta-analysis suggest that decision-makers should carefully consider CSH, multicomponent interventions, modifications to PE curricula and school nutrition policies to prevent childhood obesity.","Dabravolskaj, Julia; Montemurro, Genevieve; Ekwaru, John Paul; Wu, Xiu Yun; Storey, Kate; Campbell, Sandra; Veugelers, Paul J; Ohinmaa, Arto",Preventive medicine reports,127,17

The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of anxiety and depression symptoms among patients with primary ED and PE. METHODS A sample of 57 men (ED = 31; PE = 26) were compared to 25 male outpatients with anxiety disorder (AD) and 25 healthy controls. Principal assessment measures included the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). RESULTS Greater levels of STAI state anxiety were reported among the ED, PE, and AD groups as compared to healthy controls. In contrast ED and AD groups scored higher than controls on the STAI trait anxiety and BDI, but PE scores were not different from healthy controls in both measures. CONCLUSIONS The study findings suggest that both primary ED and PE are conditions associated with significant state anxiety; however, PE appears to be less associated with trait anxiety and depression compared to ED, a finding that corroborates the recent acknowledgement of PE as a more biologically based condition. Limitations and potential clinical implications are also discussed.","Mourikis, Iraklis; Antoniou, Marianthi; Matsouka, Efi; Vousoura, Eleni; Tzavara, Chara; Ekizoglou, Chrysa; Papadimitriou, George N; Vaidakis, Nikos; Zervas, Iannis M",Annals of general psychiatry,127,1

However, current US immigration laws-and their enforcement-not only fail to fulfill migrants' health rights but actively undermine their realization and worsen the pandemic's spread.Specifically, the US immigration system's reliance on detention, which precludes effective social distancing, increases risks of exposure and infection for detainees, staff, and their broader communities. International agreements clearly state that the prolonged, mandatory, or automatic detention of people solely because of their migration status is a human rights violation on its own. But in the context of COVID-19, the consequences for migrants' right to health are particularly acute.Effective alternatives exist: other countries demonstrate the feasibility of adopting and implementing immigration laws that establish far less restrictive, social services-based approaches to enforcement that respect human rights. To protect public health and realize its global commitments, the United States must shift away from detaining migrants as standard practice and adopt effective, humane alternatives-both amid COVID-19 and permanently.

The French College of Obstetrics and Gynecology mandated a multidisciplinary panel of experts to perform a reassessment of the screening program in accordance with international good practice. In France, about 70% of pregnant women are not immune to T. gondii, and 0.2-0.25% become infected during pregnancy. The risk of maternal-fetal transmission of infection is on average 25-29% and depends greatly on the gestational age at seroconversion. In case of fetal transmission, the outcome is livebirth in 95% of cases, with latent congenital toxoplasmosis in 90% of cases and symptomatic forms in 10% of cases, of which 1/3 are severe and 2/3 moderate. Biological techniques have satisfactory performance regarding serologies for the diagnosis of maternal infections and PCR on amniotic fluid for the prenatal diagnosis of congenital toxoplasmosis. Primary prevention of toxoplasmosis is based on hygiene measures that are relatively simple, but poorly implemented. In case of maternal seroconversion, there is a strong case for prenatal prophylactic treatment as soon as possible (ideally within 3 weeks of seroconversion), spiramycin before 14 weeks of gestation (WG), and with a tendency to superiority of the pyrimethamine/sulfadiazine association over spiramycin beyond 14 W G, in order to reduce the risk of symptomatic congenital toxoplasmosis. In case of congenital toxoplasmosis, prompt initiation of treatment reduces the occurrence of cerebral signs and symptoms, as well as retinal lesions. Several medico-economic evaluations of the French toxoplasmosis screening program have been conducted including an individual cost-effectiveness approach with decision analysis which concluded on the profitability of prenatal screening as carried out in France (monthly surveillance of seronegative women, prenatal treatment in case of seroconversion, termination of pregnancy in severe forms). Though most international societies do not recommend systematic screening for mainly financial reasons, if congenital toxoplasmosis appears benign in France today, it is probably thanks to screening and the possibility of early treatment of fetuses and/or newborns. Thus, the panel recommends continuing for now the program in France for prevention of congenital toxoplasmosis.","Picone, Olivier; Fuchs, Florent; Benoist, Guillaume; Binquet, Christine; Kieffer, François; Wallon, Martine; Wehbe, Karl; Mandelbrot, Laurent; Villena, Isabelle",Journal of gynecology obstetrics and human reproduction,127,1

METHODS This retrospective cohort study included COVID-19 patients with oxygen saturation (SatO2) in room air < 92% admitted between March 3 and April 30, 2020. Following the interim protocol, patients could receive dexamethasone or methylprednisolone, and were classified according to oxygen requirements. The primary endpoint was admission to Intensive Care Unit (ICU) or mortality. Kaplan-Meier and Cox hazards analyses were used. RESULTS Of the 115 patients included, 38 received corticosteroids. Among patients requiring high-flow, non-invasive ventilation (NIV) or fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) > 0.40, the HR for death or ICU admission, between corticosteroids and non-corticosteroids group, was 0.07 (95% CI 0.01-0.4), p= 0.002, and for patients requiring low-flow oxygen the HR was 070 (95% CI 0.13-3.8), p= 0.68. Significant differences were also observed when all patients were analyzed together. CONCLUSION A significant reduction in mortality and ICU admission frequency was observed among patients requiring high-flow oxygen or NIV, but not among those requiring low-flow oxygen.

Many programs shifted from in-person to virtual interviews. We evaluated applicant perceptions of the various formats. METHODS All 2019-2020 cardiothoracic fellowship applicants received an electronic survey after completion of the match process. The survey assessed number of in-person/virtual interviews completed, perception of efficacy and likelihood of ranking a program based on format, and strengths/inadequacies of virtual interviews. RESULTS Response rate was 36% (48/133). Seventy-three percent (35/48) of respondents interviewed with more than 10 programs. Fifty-two percent (25/48) of respondents were able to schedule additional interviews once virtual formats were available. A slight majority (56%, 27/48) ranked a program at which they had an in-person interview as their first choice. Interviewing at more than 10 programs was associated with an increased likelihood of successfully matching at a program (p = 0.02). Overwhelmingly, respondents favored an in-person component to the interview process (96%, 46/48). Few respondents (29%, 14/48) felt they could adequately evaluate a program virtually. The factors which had the highest percentages of adequate portrayal during virtual interviews were the didactic schedule/curriculum (81%, 39/48) and case number/autonomy (58%, 28/48). The factors with the lowest percentages were culture/personality (19%, 9/48) and city/lifestyle (15%, 7/48). CONCLUSIONS Applicants strongly favored an in-person component to interviews, highlighting potential deficiencies in the virtual interview process. Programs should consider the addition of virtual tours of their hospitals, narrations from staff and vignettes from current fellows about lifestyle and well-being.","Taylor, Melissa; Wallen, Tyler; Mehaffey, J Hunter; Shirafkan, Ali; Brescia, Alexander; Freeman, Kirsten; Louis, Clauden; Watson, Justin; Okereke, Ikenna C",The Annals of thoracic surgery,127,17

METHODS The authors retrospectively reviewed the clinical and radiological characteristics of patients with RICMs. The features of these RICMs were then compared with features of nonradiation cavernous malformations (CMs) in 270 patients. RESULTS Thirty-two patients with RICMs were identified (56.2% men), with a median age of 31.1 years at RICM diagnosis. The median latency from radiation treatment to RICM diagnosis was 12.0 years (interquartile range 5.0-19.6 years). RICMs were always within the previous radiation port. RICMs were symptomatic at diagnosis in 46.9%, and were associated with symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage at any time in 43.8%. Older age at the time of radiation treatment and higher radiation dose were associated with shorter latency. RICMs tended to be diagnosed at a younger age than nonradiation CMs (median 31.1 vs 42.4 years, respectively; p = 0.054) but were significantly less likely to be symptomatic at the time of diagnosis (46.9% vs 65.8%, respectively; p = 0.036). RICMs were more likely to be multiple CMs than nonradiation CMs (p = 0.0002). Prospectively, the risk of symptomatic hemorrhage was 4.2% for RICMs and 2.3% for nonradiation CMs per person-year (p = 0.556). In the absence of symptoms at presentation, the risk of hemorrhage for RICMs was higher than for nonradiation CMs (4.2% vs 0.35%, respectively; p = 0.118). CONCLUSIONS In this patient population, RICMs occurred within the radiation port approximately 12 years after radiation treatment. Compared with nonradiation CMs, RICMs were more likely to occur as multiple CMs, to present at a younger age, and were at least as likely to cause symptomatic hemorrhage.","Cutsforth-Gregory, Jeremy K; Lanzino, Giuseppe; Link, Michael J; Brown, Robert D; Flemming, Kelly D",Journal of neurosurgery,127,1

METHOD Multiple databases and previous publications were searched through June 2015 to identify all randomized controlled trials of any add-on antidepressants compared with placebo or no-treatment in schizophrenia. Depressive and negative symptoms (primary outcomes), overall symptoms, positive symptoms, side effects, exacerbation of psychosis, and responder rates were examined. Subgroup, meta-regression, and sensitivity analyses were performed, as well as investigations of publication bias and risk of bias. RESULTS Eighty-two randomized controlled trials with a total of 3,608 participants were included. Add-on antidepressants appeared more efficacious than controls for depressive symptoms (standardized mean difference: -0.25, 95% CI=-0.38 to -0.12), negative symptoms (standardized mean difference: -0.30, 95% CI=-0.44 to -0.16), overall symptoms (standardized mean difference: -0.24, 95% CI=-0.39 to -0.09), positive symptoms (standardized mean difference: -0.17, 95% CI=-0.33 to -0.01), quality of life (standardized mean difference: -0.32, 95% CI=-0.57 to -0.06), and responder rate (risk ratio: 1.52, 95% CI=1.29 to 1.78; number-needed-to-treat-to-benefit: 5, 95% CI=4 to 7). The effects on depressive and negative symptoms appeared more pronounced when minimum thresholds of these symptoms were inclusion criteria (standardized mean difference: -0.34, 95% CI=-0.58 to -0.09 and standardized mean difference: -0.58, 95% CI=-0.94 to -0.21, respectively). There were no significant differences between antidepressants and controls in terms of exacerbation of psychosis, premature discontinuation, and the number of participants with at least one adverse event. More patients taking add-on antidepressants suffered from abdominal pain, constipation, dizziness, and dry mouth. CONCLUSIONS Analysis of primary outcomes (depressive and negative symptoms) suggests small, beneficial effects of adjunctive antidepressants. It would appear that this augmentation can be accomplished with a low risk of exacerbation of psychosis and adverse effects. However, secondary and subgroup analyses should be interpreted cautiously and considered exploratory.","Helfer, Bartosz; Samara, Myrto T; Huhn, Maximilian; Klupp, Elisabeth; Leucht, Claudia; Zhu, Yikang; Engel, Rolf R; Leucht, Stefan",The American journal of psychiatry,127,26

This study sought to examine the gender and geographical representation of editors and editorial board members in medical education journals. METHODS Information about individual editors and editorial board members of 10 medical education journals was retrieved from their websites in January 2021, including their gender and the country in which they were based. Countries were categorised according to World Bank Income Classification and World Bank Geographical Regions. We then calculated the Composite Editorial Board Diversity Score for each journal. FINDINGS Of 488 editors and editorial board members, 283 (58.0%) were male, 452 (92.6%) were based in high-income countries and 322 (66.0%) were from the four countries with greatest representation (the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia and Canada). DISCUSSION The composition of medical education journals' editorial leadership teams remains dominated by males and those from higher income and Western countries. Strikingly, little change has taken place since this was last examined 17 years ago despite the field becoming apparently more globalised. As medical education strives to become a more inclusive and diverse discipline, developing policies to create more globally representative editorial leadership teams should now be an urgent priority.","Yip, Sharon Wing Lam; Rashid, Mohammed Ahmed",The clinical teacher,127,2

It typically presents with fevers, myalgias, and erythema migrans, but it can result in disseminated symptoms if left untreated. Lyme carditis is a rare, but potentially fatal complication of Lyme disease, occurring in up to 4-10% of untreated cases. Typically, it presents with atrioventricular conduction abnormalities, which resolve with intravenous antibiotics and temporary pacing if indicated. Diverse cardiac pathology, however, has been associated with Lyme carditis, which may be underrecognized in practice. CASE REPORT A 34-year-old woman with no significant medical history presented with fatigue, dizziness, and shortness of breath, 2 weeks after camping in Rhode Island. Her presenting electrocardiogram demonstrated third-degree heart block. She was noted to have targetoid rashes on her left shoulder and breast on physical examination. On laboratory work-up, she was found to have positive Lyme total antibody enzyme immunoassay and positive Lyme western immunoblot. The findings were diagnostic for Lyme carditis. The patient's cardiac rhythm subsequently converted to slow atrial flutter with variable ventricular response unresponsive to antibiotic therapy. Given evidence suggesting that atrioventricular conduction was preserved, synchronized electrical cardioversion was pursued and was ultimately successful in rhythm conversion to normal sinus rhythm. CONCLUSIONS Although Lyme carditis is rare, this diagnosis should be of high clinical consideration in presentations of cardiac conduction abnormalities with acute onset and without other obvious cause, particularly in Lyme-endemic regions such as the northeastern United States.","Khetpal, Vishal; Wark, Tyler W; Masel, Rebecca; Tran, Cao Thach; Haines, Philip",The American journal of case reports,127,5

Influenza vaccine uptake has remained low in most countries, including Switzerland. The aim of the study was to determine parents’ intentions towards influenza vaccination of their children, as well as themselves, and to assess regional differences. METHODS Parents presenting to four paediatric emergency departments (Zurich, Bern, Bellinzona, Geneva) were asked to complete an online survey during and after the first lockdown of the COVID-19 pandemic (April to June 2020). The anonymised survey included demographic information, vaccination history and intentions to vaccinate against influenza, as well as attitudes towards future vaccination against COVID-19. RESULTS The majority of children (92%; 602/654) were up-to-date on their vaccination schedule. In 2019/2020, 7.2% (47/654) were vaccinated against influenza. Children with chronic illnesses were more frequently vaccinated than healthy children (19.2% vs 5.6%; p = 0.002). For the coming winter season, 111 (17%) parents stated they plan to vaccinate their children against influenza, more than double the rate from last year, and 383 (59.2%) parents suggested they will vaccinate against COVID-19 once a vaccine is available. Regional differences between “German” and “Latin” Switzerland were found for parents’ intent to have their children vaccinated against influenza next season (Zurich and Bern 14.3%, Bellinzona and Geneva 27.2%, p <0.001), but not for a hypothetical vaccination against COVID-19 (Zurich and Bern 59.1%, Bellinzona and Geneva 59.7%, p = 0.894). CONCLUSIONS The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a substantial increase of parents’ intention to vaccinate their children against influenza, especially in hard-hit “Latin” Switzerland. The Swiss government and public health organisations can leverage these regional results to promote influenza vaccination among children for the coming seasons.","Seiler, Michelle; Goldman, Ran D; Staubli, Georg; Hoeffe, Julia; Gualco, Gianluca; Manzano, Sergio; Part Of The International Covid-Parental Attitude Study Covipas Group,",Swiss medical weekly,127,17

Par14 and its isoform Par17 belong to the Parvulin family of PPIases. Par14 can bind AT-rich double-stranded DNA and was shown to be part of the pre-ribosomal ribonucleoprotein (pre-rRNP) complexes, where it functions as an RNA processing factor that is involved in ribosome biogenesis. Its longer isoform Par17 is expressed only in cells of hominids, where it is targeted to the mitochondria. To find binding partners (peptides or proteins) for Par17, we applied the phage display technology. We panned 7-mer and 12-mer peptide libraries against Par17. The consensus sequence XHSXVHØ, where X can be any amino acid and Ø is a hydrophobic amino acid, was enriched from both libraries. We demonstrate the binding of this motif to the PPIase domain of Par17 using phage ELISA and NMR spectroscopy. We propose that residues Met90, Val91, Phe94, Gln95, Glu96, and Ala98 of Par17 are involved in substrate recognition, and that the phage display-selected motif XHSXVHØ can be recognized by Par17 PPIase domain in vivo.","Elfaki, Imadeldin; Knitsch, Andre; Matena, Anja; Bayer, Peter",Journal of peptide science : an official publication of the European Peptide Society,127,1

However, the devices used to generate and deliver these medical aerosols have the potential to release these therapeutics into the local environment and expose caregivers to unwanted medical aerosols. AIM To quantify the levels of fugitive medical aerosol released into the environment during aerosol drug delivery using a manual resuscitation bag with and without filtration. METHODS Time-varying fugitive aerosol concentrations were measured using an aerodynamic particle sizer placed at a position designed to mimic a caregiver. Two nebuliser types were assessed, a vibrating mesh nebuliser and a jet nebuliser. The aerosol dose delivered to the simulated patient lung was also quantified. FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS Filtration of the exhalation port of the manual resuscitation bag was seen to reduce fugitive medical aerosols to ambient levels for both nebuliser types. The vibrating mesh nebuliser delivered the greatest quantity of aerosol to the simulated adult patient (18.44 ± 1.03% versus 3.64 ± 0.26% with a jet nebuliser). The results highlight the potential for exposure to fugitive medical aerosols released during the delivery of aerosol therapy with a manual resuscitation bag and also the potential for significant variation in patient lung dose depending on nebuliser type.","Mac Giolla Eain, Marc; Joyce, Mary; O'Sullivan, Andrew; McGrath, James A; MacLoughlin, Ronan",The Journal of hospital infection,127,1

Previous studies have found no relationship between month of the year and surgical volume. However, seasonal events and greater use of high-deductible health insurance plans may cause U.S. patients to schedule elective surgery later in the calendar year. The hypothesis was that elective anesthesia caseloads would be higher in December than in other months. METHODS This review analyzed yearly adult case data in Florida and Texas locations of a multistate anesthesia practice from 2017 to 2019. To focus on elective caseload, the study excluded obstetric, weekend, and holiday cases. Time trend decomposition analysis was used with seasonal variation to assess differences between December and other months in daily caseload and their relationship to age and insurance subgroups. RESULTS A total of 3,504,394 adult cases were included in the analyses. Overall, daily caseloads increased by 2.5 ± 0.1 cases per day across the 3-yr data set. After adjusting for time trends, the average daily December caseload in 2017 was 5,039 cases (95% CI, 4,900 to 5,177), a 20% increase over the January-to-November baseline (4,196 cases; 95% CI, 4,158 to 4,235; P < 0.0001). This increase was replicated in 2018: 5,567 cases in December (95% CI, 5,434 to 5,700) versus 4,589 cases at baseline (95% CI, 4,538 to 4,641), a 21.3% increase; and in 2019: 6,103 cases in December (95% CI, 5,871 to 6,334) versus 5,045 cases at baseline (95% CI, 4,984 to 5,107), a 21% increase (both P < 0.001). The proportion of commercially insured patients and those aged 18 to 64 yr was also higher in December than in other months. CONCLUSIONS In this 3-yr retrospective analysis, it was observed that, after accounting for time trends, elective anesthesia caseloads were higher in December than in other months of the year. Proportions of commercially insured and younger patients were also higher in December. When compared to previous studies finding no increase, this pattern suggests a recent shift in elective surgical scheduling behavior.

The present COVID-19 pandemic has brought the world to its knees resulting in overstretched healthcare systems, increased health inequalities and disruptions to people’s right to health including life-saving routine immunization programs across the world. Design/methodology/approach: This is a commentary paper. Findings: Immunization remains one of the most successful, safe, cost-effective and proven fundamental disease prevention measures in the history of public health. However, the COVID-19 pandemic has effectively thrown the world's immunization practices out of gear, depriving approximately 80 million infants, in rich and poor countries alike, at risk of triggering a resurgence of vaccine-preventable diseases such as diphtheria, measles and polio. It is estimated that each COVID-19 death averted by suspending immunization sessions in Africa could lead to 29-347 future deaths due to other diseases including measles, yellow fever, polio, meningitis, pneumonia and diarrhoea. Originality/value: The value of implementing robust immunization policies cannot be underestimated. Risks associated with postponing immunization services and the fact that COVID-19 is now an integral part of human civilization have resulted in several countries making special efforts to continue their immunization services. However, critical precautionary measures are warranted to prevent COVID-19 among healthcare service providers, facilitators, caregivers and children during the immunization sessions. © 2020, Sanjeev Singh, Sruti Singha Roy and Kirti Sundar Sahu.","Singh, S.; Singha Roy, S.; Sahu, K.

Postgraduate (PG) health sciences students (HSSs) are the frontline healthcare workers who are susceptible to psychological issues like depression, anxiety and stress during such stressful pandemic period. The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between the psychological issues such as depression, anxiety and stress and the level of resilience among PG HSSs during the COVID-19 pandemic. Materials and Methods: The present cross-sectional online survey was conducted by the department of Psychiatry of tertiary health care center from Maharashtra state of India over a 10 days period (from April 15, 2020 to April 24, 2020), with a sample size of 195 which was calculated by using the formula of sample size calculation for the cross-sectional study design. Data were collected using the purposive sampling method from the PG HSSs. Data were recorded from the study participants in an online structured questionnaire prepared for the study using the sociodemographic details and the two scales namely Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale-21 item (DASS-21) and Brief Resilience Scale (BRS). DASS-21 scale was used to assess the presence and severity of depression, anxiety, and stress, while BRS scale was used to assess the level of resilience among the PG HSSs. Data were collected and analyzed using the SPSS software version 15.0, Fisher's exact test, and Pearson's correlation test. Results: Prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress were 43.1%, 68.7%, and 11.3%, respectively. There was a high positive correlation between all three subscales of DASS-21 (depression, anxiety, and stress subscales). On BRS, 2 (1.0%) study participants had high resilience, 120 (61.5%) had normal resilience, and 73 (37.5%) Conclusion: Study concluded that significant proportion of PG HSSs had psychological impact of COVID-19 in the form of depression, anxiety and stress. Programs such as timely evaluation of mental health status and stress management to address these psychological issues should be a priority. In long terms, increasing the resilience of PG HSSs can have protective value against the psychological issues during the stressful events of infectious disease outbreaks like COVID-19 pandemic.

Yet, most countries with high disease burdens rely entirely on facility-based passive surveillance systems, which miss the vast majority of cases in rural settings with low access to health care. This is especially true for malaria, for which the World Health Organization estimates that routine surveillance detects only 14% of global cases. The goal of this study was to estimate the unobserved burden of malaria missed by routine passive surveillance in a rural district of Madagascar to produce realistic incidence estimates across space and time, less sensitive to heterogeneous health care access. Methods: We use a geographically explicit dataset of the 73,022 malaria cases confirmed at health centers in the Ifanadiana District in Madagascar from 2014 to 2017. Malaria incidence was adjusted to account for underreporting due to stock-outs of rapid diagnostic tests and variable access to healthcare. A benchmark multiplier was combined with a health care utilization index obtained from statistical models of non-malaria patients. Variations to the multiplier and several strategies for pooling neighboring communities together were explored to allow for fine-tuning of the final estimates. Separate analyses were carried out for individuals of all ages and for children under five. Cross-validation criteria were developed based on overall incidence, trends in financial and geographical access to health care, and consistency with geographic distribution in a district-representative cohort. The most plausible sets of estimates were then identified based on these criteria. Results: Passive surveillance was estimated to have missed about 4 in every 5 malaria cases among all individuals and 2 out of every 3 cases among children under five. Adjusted malaria estimates were less biased by differences in populations' financial and geographic access to care. Average adjusted monthly malaria incidence was nearly four times higher during the high transmission season than during the low transmission season. Geographic distribution in the adjusted dataset revealed high transmission clusters in low elevation areas in the northeast and southeast of the district that were stable across seasons and transmission years. Conclusions: Understanding local disease dynamics from routine passive surveillance data can be a key step towards achieving universal access to diagnostics and treatment. Methods presented here could be scaled-up thanks to the increasing availability of e-health disease surveillance platforms for malaria and other diseases across the developing world.","Hyde, E.; Bonds, M.

Notably, individuals with mental disorders have been reported to have a higher risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2. Personality traits could represent an important determinant of preventative health behavior and, therefore, the risk of contracting the virus. Aims We examined overlapping genetic underpinnings between major psychiatric disorders, personality traits, and susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods Linkage disequilibrium score regression was used to explore the genetic correlations of COVID-19 susceptibility with psychiatric disorders and personality traits based on data from the largest available respective genome-wide association studies (GWAS). In two cohorts (the PsyCourse (n=1346) and the HeiDE (n=3266) study), polygenic risk scores were used to analyze if a genetic association between, psychiatric disorders, personality traits, and COVID-19 susceptibility exists in individual-level data. Results We observed no significant genetic correlations of COVID-19 susceptibility with psychiatric disorders. For personality traits, there was a significant genetic correlation for COVID-19 susceptibility with extraversion (p=1.47x10-5; rg=0.284). Yet, this was not reflected in individual-level data from the PsyCourse and HeiDE studies. Conclusions We identified no significant correlation between genetic risk factors for severe psychiatric disorders and genetic risk for COVID-19 susceptibility. Among the personality traits, extraversion showed evidence for a positive genetic association with COVID-19 susceptibility, in one but not in another setting. Overall, these findings highlight a complex contribution of genetic and non-genetic components in the interaction between COVID-19 susceptibility and personality traits or mental disorders.","Heilbronner, U.; Streit, F.; Vogl, T.; Senner, F.; Sabrina, S.; Reich-Erkelenz, D.; Papiol, S.; Oraki Kohshour, M.; Klohn-Saghatolislam, F.; Kalman, J.

Our research is intended to aid in minimizing the spread of coronavirus by developing technology for authorities to discern if face masks are being worn properly. We collected data from the Internet and increased it synthetically by augmentation. Two publicly available datasets were merged: the face mask detection dataset and the MASKEDFACE-NET dataset. Our data was annotated manually and then made into a graphical user interface (GUI) for semi-automatic annotation. The multiple object detection networks were trained for three states of face mask wearing: with_mask, without_mask, and mask_weared_incorrect. Four two-stage object detection models were trained and tested during the experiment. The results are compared based on the mean average precisions and scores. The networks achieved above 91% accuracy in both mean average precisions and scores for the three classes of object. We applied these object detectors to our annotation tool for quick semi-supervised annotation. The proposed mask status detection system can aid in reducing the spread of COVID-19 if deployed in a real-world scenario. Our data labeling tool with annotation, augmentation, and automatic suggestion can help further research into these types of technologies. © 2021 ACM.","Bhattarai, B.; Raj Pandeya, Y.; Lee, J.","6th International Conference on Machine Learning Technologies, ICMLT 2021",127,1

Governments had to both undertake (unprecedented) restrictive measures to manage the spread of COVID-19 and to rely on citizens' willingness to adhere to these measures. Scientific works on political trust generally focus on people's trust in government and stress its centrality during the crisis. Public opinion surveys, conducted during the initial stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, reported fluctuating levels of people's trust in national governments. However, it is as important to ask how government constructs trust, including in its own people. In the article, we aim to focus on the latter aspect of political trust in order to highlight the role of trust in such crises as pandemic, and draw evaluative implications for democratic arrangements. Using discourse analysis, we look at how the Prime Ministers (PMs) of three European countries (Hungary, Lithuania, and the Netherlands) articulated (dis)trust as well as constructed images of ""Us"" in their public speeches informing respective societies about the COVID-19 situation. In PMs' speeches (dis)trust is articulated along a ""trustcontrol"" continuum, and we identified distinctive patterns of the ""Us"" vs. ""Them"" construction.","Snieckute, M.; Gaizauskaite, I.",Partecipazione E Conflitto,127,24

To investigate patterns, as well as drivers, related to changes in mobility across the tri-county region, a random forest regression model was built using sociodemographic, travel, and built environment factors, as well as COVID-19 positive case data. Mobility patterns declined in each county when new COVID-19 infections began to rise, beginning in mid-June 2020. While the mean number of bar and restaurant visits was lower overall due to closures, analysis showed that these visits remained a top factor that impacted mobility for all three counties, even with a rise in cases. Our modeling results suggest that there were mobility pattern differences between counties with respect to factors relating, for example, to race and ethnicity (different population groups factored differently in each county), as well as social distancing or travel-related factors (e.g., staying at home behaviors) over the two time periods prior to and after the spike of COVID-19 cases.","Zhu, Guimin Stewart Kathleen Niemeier Deb Fan Junchuan",ISPRS International Journal of Geo-Information,127,1

The present study objective is to evaluate the prevalence of COVID-19 in GCC countries. Methods: Six countries are Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Kuwait, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), and Oman included in the study. Six parameters of COVID-19 data were collected from various dashboards. Data analyses of all parameters were expressed in frequencies and percentages. Results: The highest number of cases was reported in Saudi Arabia (347,282) and least in Bahrain (81,466). The cases in Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Bahrain have been reported a decrease, while the UAE and Oman reported an increase in the month of October. The recovery rates in Qatar (97.76%) and the UAE (97.19%) showed highest. Saudi Arabia and Oman showed the highest death rate (1.56% and 1.06%), while Qatar lowest death rate (0.18%). Critical cases are more in Saudi Arabia (0.22%). Oman showed the highest number of active cases (8.88%). The highest percentage of COVID-19 infection rates are in Bahrain (4.75%) and Qatar (4.72%). The UAE (132.77%) and Bahrain (101.24%) reported the highest COVID-19-tested percentage, while Oman (7.32%) had the least in their given population. Conclusions: The status of COVID-19 in the UAE and Oman showed a slight increase in the cases. The overall outcomes represent the status of COVID-19 in GCC countries reliably under control.

Studies investigating VNS as an acute treatment method for treatment resistent depression have shown very limited results, however there are data suggesting that VNS might have a beneficial effect on a longer term. There are also studies that suggest that a history of response to ECT might indicate a higher response rate to VNS. VNS was suggested as treatment for a patient who received maintenance ECT for treatment resistant unipolar depression during 9 years. 3 months after VNS was implanted, ECT was stopped due to the Covid-19 pandemic. In this case study we will review the patient’s response to treatment with VNS and the sudden stop of long-term ECT treatment.ObjectivesTo review the response to acute and maintenance ECT and VNS in this patient diagnosed with treatment resistant unipolar depression, and to compare this to the data suggesting VNS as an alternative treatment method for maintenance ECT in patients with treatment resistant depression.MethodsUsing the extensive data collected during the patient’s treatment, we will review the clinical response and side-effect burden of this patient to acute and maintenance ECT and to VNS.ResultsThe patient showed a vast improvement in depressive symptoms a few months after start of VNS treatment, while long-term maintenance ECT was stopped.ConclusionsThis patient’s response to VNS supports the data suggesting VNS as an alternative treatment method for maintenance ECT in patients with treatment resistant depression.Conflict of interestThis patient received VNS treatment as part of a study conducted in our centre (UPC KULeuven) with support of Livanova.

These social capacities are subject to dramatic change in disease and injury; yet their supporting neural substrates remain poorly understood. Hyperscanning employs functional neuroimaging to simultaneously assess brain activity in two individuals and offers the best means to understand the neural basis of social interaction. However, present technologies are limited, either by poor performance (low spatial/temporal precision) or unnatural scanning environment (claustrophobic scanners, with interactions via video). Here, we solve this problem by developing a new form of hyperscanning using wearable magnetoencephalography (MEG). This approach exploits quantum sensors for MEG signal detection, in combination with high-fidelity magnetic field control – afforded by a novel “matrix coil” system – to enable simultaneous scanning of two freely moving participants. We demonstrate our approach in a somatosensory task and an interactive ball game. Despite large and unpredictable subject motion, sensorimotor brain activity was delineated clearly in space and time, and correlation of the envelope of neuronal oscillations between people was demonstrated. In sum, unlike existing modalities, wearable-MEG combines high fidelity data acquisition and a naturalistic setting, which will facilitate a new generation of hyperscanning.","Holmes, Niall; Rea, Molly; Hill, Ryan M.; Boto, Elena; Stuart, Andrew; Leggett, James; Edwards, Lucy J.; Rhodes, Natalie; Shah, Vishal; Osborne, James; Fromhold, T.

While recognising the interest and necessity of reflecting on human health and the health of the planet, this article aims to show, however, that the Planetary Health paradigm is problematic and aporetic for two reasons. First, because it is based on a scientistic and depoliticised conception of the Anthropocene, which obscures capitalism's responsibility for the contemporary global and, especially, ecological crisis. Second, because this conception leads to a promotion of solutions that are essentially based on the financialization and technoscientific management of the living world - precisely the underlying cause of the degradation of ecosystems and living conditions that created the Anthropocene in the first place.

This study aims to analyze and compare the effects of COVID-19 quarantining on body mass between combat and aesthetic sports athletes. Material and methods 150 male athletes, in the age group of 20-23 years old, participated in this study. They were grouped into two. The first consisted of 100 combat sports athletes, including boxing (n=25), Judo (n=20), Karate (n=20), Taekwondo (n=20), and Pencak Silat (n=15). The second group was comprised of 50 aesthetic sports athletes, including aerobic (n=20), artistic gymnastics (n=15), and diving (n=15). This study focused on two parts: body mass measurement before the large-scale social restrictions in DKI Jakarta was implemented (Pre-LSCR) and body mass measurement during the large-scale social restrictions in DKI Jakarta (During-LSCR). A Life Satisfaction (LS) questionnaire was administered to all participants During-LSCR. Results The LS questionnaire showed a higher level of the “very satisfying” response in aesthetic sports athletes regarding doing sports During-LSCR (90%), compared to that in combat sports athletes (16%). On the other hand, there were significant differences in body mass (p = 0.001) and body fat percentage (p = 0.001) between combat sports and aesthetic sports athletes.

Here we present the protocol for the implementation science (IS) theme within ASSET that aims to (1) understand what HSS interventions work, for whom and how; and (2) how implementation science methodologies can be adapted to improve the design and evaluation of HSS interventions within resource-poor contexts. Methods Pre-implementation phase: The IS theme, jointly with ASSET work-packages, applies IS determinant frameworks to identify factors that influence the effectiveness of delivering evidence-informed care. Determinants are used to select a set of HSS interventions for further evaluation, where work packages also theorise selective mechanisms to achieve the expected outcomes. Piloting phase and rolling implementation phase: Work-packages pilot the HSS interventions. An iterative process then begins involving evaluation, refection and adaptation. Throughout this phase, IS determinant frameworks are applied to monitor and identify barriers and enablers to implementation in a series of workshops, surveys and interviews. Selective mechanisms of action are also investigated. In a final workshop, ASSET teams come together, to reflect and explore the utility of the selected IS methods and provide suggestions for future use. Structured templates are used to organise and analyse common and heterogeneous patterns across work-packages. Qualitative data are analysed using thematic analysis and quantitative data is analysed using means and proportions. Conclusions We use a novel combination of implementation science methods at a programmatic level to facilitate comparisons of determinants and mechanisms that influence the effectiveness of HSS interventions in achieving implementation outcomes across different contexts. The study will also contribute conceptual development and clarification at the underdeveloped interface of implementation science, HSS and global health.","Seward, N.; Murdoch, J.; Hanlon, C.; Araya, R.; Gao, W.; Harding, R.; Lund, C.; Hinrichs-Krapels, S.; Mayston, R.; Radhakrishnan, M.; Prince, M.

This paper aims to study how rural tourism practitioners can get out of the mire of the pandemic. By analyzing the behaviors of various stakeholders and the logic of the impact of the pandemic, the behaviors of participants and future development were sorted out. The key elements that promote the recovery of rural tourism were discovered. Design/methodology/approach Based on the framework of institute analysis and development (IAD), this research selected six rural tourist communities in China as subjects for the studies. Based on the seven basic principles of hermeneutics and the inductive research method, following the analysis method of ""first-order coding, second-order coding, aggregated dimensions,"" the texts obtained through in-depth interview and work reports were analyzed and concepts were extracted. Findings The paper extracted 44 first-order concepts and 14 second-order concepts, and obtained 7 aggregation dimensions, including policy formulation and implementation, improvement of integrated marketing capabilities, improvement of tourism product quality, restrictions on rural tourism development, protection and optimization of environmental resources, industrial integration strategies and improvement of managerial and coordinating capabilities. During the pandemic, the government, enterprises and associations, as the service providers of rural tourism, can optimize the environmental resources and industrial resources of rural tourism by formulating policies, refining products and strengthening marketing in the action arena, to promote the industrial integration of rural tourism and provide better products and services for tourists. Originality/value This paper uses the IAD framework to study how rural tourism communities can successfully recover from the impact of the pandemic. It is found that the rapid recovery of rural tourism is the result of collective action. The core of establishing the collective action mechanism of rural tourism is consensus mechanism, co-construction mechanism and sharing mechanism. By studying the path and possibility of collective action of rural tourism communities, this paper explores the approach of multi-center governance of rural tourism communities to promote the imminent recovery of rural tourism.","Pan, H.

We carried out a randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled trial in which 24 chronic stroke survivors with mild to moderate upper limb impairment experienced three training days of either Real (n=12) or Sham (n=12) neurofeedback. Stroke survivors were able to use Real neurofeedback to increase laterality of motor cortex activity within, but not across, training days. Improvement in gross hand motor performance assessed by the Jebsen Taylor Test (JTT) was observed in the Real neurofeedback group compared to Sham. However, there were no improvements on the Action Research Arm Test (ARAT) or the Upper Extremity Fugl-Meyer (UE-FM) score. Additionally, decreased white-matter asymmetry of the corticospinal tracts was detected 1-week after neurofeedback training, indicating that the tracts become more similar with Real neurofeedback. Changes in the affected corticospinal tract was positively correlated with neurofeedback performance. Therefore, here we demonstrate that chronic stroke survivors are able to use fMRI neurofeedback to self-modulate motor cortex activity, and that training is associated with improvements in hand motor performance and with white matter structural changes.","Sanders, Z.-B.; Fleming, M.

Objective signs include cough, fever, and sneezing. Subjective symptoms include nasal congestion, feverishness, headache, and sore throat. School-aged children may provide a more accurate picture of the symptom profile during colds because they can self-report. METHODS Using preprinted diary sheets listing common signs and symptoms, diaries were kept for school-aged children for 10 days after onset of a cold. Nasopharyngeal aspirates were analyzed for respiratory viruses and potential bacterial pathogens. RESULTS Out of 81 colds studied, the most common signs were cough and sneezing, although the most common symptoms were nasal congestion and runny nose. Other symptoms, including feverishness and headache, were each reported in 15% of children at onset. The majority of children (73%) continued to be symptomatic 10 days after onset. Rhinovirus was detected in 46% and 1 or more potential bacterial pathogens (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis) in 29% of episodes.

Despite the observed efficacy of surgical debridement, many patients with VLUs refuse the procedure due to the associated pain. Autolytic debridement induces no pain, but is slow or disrupted in chronic VLUs. Elucidation of the wound dressing functions that are sufficient to support autolytic debridement is needed. MATERIALS AND METHODS The authors report 2 challenging cases with large, nonresponsive VLUs. A 52-year-old female patient, Case 1, presented with a VLU of 91.4 cm(2) (10.5 cm x 8.7 cm); and a 58-year-old female patient, Case 2, presented with bilateral VLUs, the larger of which was 50 cm(2) (10 cm x 5 cm). Both VLU cases were covered with yellow slough, and case 1 had a small area of black necrotic tissue. The patients had received standard care for more than 16 months, but their VLUs were worsening. A self-adaptive wound dressing (SAWD) with a compression wrap was applied 2 to 3 times a week. RESULTS Within 21 days, the VLUs of both cases had shed the yellow slough, and healthy granulation tissue was visible. CONCLUSION In summary, the SAWD removed excess exudate with liquefied components of slough and nonvital tissue; provided sufficient moisture for preventing wound desiccation; sequestered microorganisms, thereby blocking their multiplication; and supported efficient autolytic debridement, clearing most of the slough and all crusted necrotic tissue within 3 weeks. The effect of SAWD on autolytic debridement is a promising mechanism for promoting healing of VLUs and warrants further study.","Reyzelman, Alexander M; Vartivarian, Mher",Wounds : a compendium of clinical research and practice,127,28

BACKGROUND The current COVID-19 pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is spreading around the globe and interferes with the provision of dental care for many individuals from different communities and backgrounds. A search for the literature on PubMed, ISI Web of Science, Scopus, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library from March 1, 2020 to December 30, 2020 was conducted. Also, the bibliographies included in the indicated articles were used to identify further literature. Recommendations by health authorities in different countries were also consulted. RESULTS COVID-19 is causing many fatalities and is disrupting people's daily life and the economy in many countries around the world. Due to the potential of cross-infection through dental treatments, especially dental aerosol generation procedures, the dental profession has been disrupted during this pandemic. Dental care provision has been ceased completely or partially (limited to emergency or urgent treatment) in most countries around the world. Until this pandemic is controlled by new suitable treatments and/or vaccination, there is an urgent need to adopt immediate guidelines and standards for the safe provision of dental care to meet patients' demands, especially for the dental aerosols. CONCLUSION Guidelines and standards for dental treatment amidst the COVID-19 pandemic are required. This manuscript provides an overview of the COVID-19 pandemic from dental perspectives and presents standards and guidelines of dental care provision based on available research in this field as well as clinical experience and practice. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE This manuscript provides guidelines and standards for dental treatment and clinical management within dental settings amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, and resembles part of the quest to set the golden standards for dental care during the current circumstances.

METHODS Adults (N = 39; body mass index: 39.5 ± 2.8 kg m-2; age: 39.9 ± 11.5 years) participated in a 6-month program with randomization to one of three intervention groups: standard behavioral weight loss, a technology-based system combined with a monthly intervention telephone call (TECH) or an enhanced technology-based system combined with a monthly intervention telephone call (EN-TECH). All groups were prescribed an energy-restricted diet and physical activity. Assessments occurred at 0, 3 and 6 months. Separate mixed-effects models using unstructured dependence structure were fit to the outcomes. RESULTS Weight loss (least square means ± standard error) at 6 months was -6.57 ± 1.65 kg in standard behavioral weight loss, -5.18 ± 1.72 kg in TECH and -6.25 ± 1.95 kg in EN-TECH (p-value for time effect ≤ 0.0001). A similar pattern was observed for change in body mass index, waist circumference and percent body fat. There was a decrease in total energy intake (p = 0.0005) and percent dietary fat intake (p = 0.0172), and physical activity increased (p = 0.0003).

Lack of effective treatment, coupled with etiology of COVID-19, has resulted in more than 500,000 confirmed deaths at the time of writing, and the global economy is at an unseen unprecedented low level with unknown near- and long-term consequences. Ingavirin has been considered a non-toxic broad-spectrum antiviral with a complex mechanism of action. The molecule was originally designed for the prophylaxis and treatment of flu caused by both Influenza A and B viruses and for the treatment of viral causes of acute respiratory illness. The article hypothesized that the efficiency of given 1H-imidazol-4-yl heterocyclic scaffold-containing compound against SARS-CoV-2 might be connected with its ability to interfere with specific heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (A1, for example). These specific cellular RNA-binding proteins showed affinity to Severe Acute Respiratory Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) nucleocapsid (N) protein, which shared high homology with the N protein of SARS-CoV-2 and the fact was expressed by a sequence identity of 90.52%. Impairing of the interactions between nuclear ribonucleoproteins and nucleocapsid (N) protein of SARS-CoV-2 might result in the inhibition of a viral replication cycle. Additional immunomodulating properties of ingavirin could be favorable for induction of adaptive immunity of host cells.","Malík, Ivan; Kovac, Gustav; Padrtova, Tereza; Hudecova, Lucia",Ceska a Slovenska farmacie : casopis Ceske farmaceuticke spolecnosti a Slovenske farmaceuticke spolecnosti,127,1

Moreover, a meta-analysis of these randomized clinical studies concluded that the mean weighted relative risk of development of T2DM was reduced by 25% in those patients treated with angiotensin II receptor blockers or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. In spite of these firm clinical data, the mechanistic pathways mediating the protective activity of RAS blockade have yet to be resolved. Of particular interest is the recently identified local pancreatic RAS and, perhaps more importantly, the finding that it is up-regulated in animal models of T2DM. This putative local RAS may regulate pancreatic islet blood flow, oxygen tension, and islet (pro)insulin biosynthesis. It might also mediate the generation of reactive oxygen species, thereby causing oxidative stress-induced pancreatic beta-cell apoptosis and fibrosis. Moreover, findings that RAS blockade improved beta-cell secretory function and cell mass in experimental animal models of Type 2 diabetes indicate that inhibition of RAS activation may play a pivotal role in protecting islet cell function, and furthermore may prevent the development of overt T2DM. Such data supporting the involvement of the local pancreatic RAS in islet function, as well as a causal relationship between RAS activation and T2DM, and RAS induced beta-cell dysfunction, mandate further investigation into the role of RAS in the pathogenesis of the progressive islet impairment observed in patients with T2DM.","Leung, P S",Diabetic medicine : a journal of the British Diabetic Association,127,1

This lack of priority results in inadequate and unbalanced food intake in patients and huge amounts of wasted food. OBJECTIVES We evaluate the main factors that are associated with reduced meal intake in hospitalized patients and the differences between geographical regions. DESIGN We conducted a descriptive analysis of data from 9 consecutive, annual, and cross-sectional nutritionDay samples (2006-2014) in a total of 91,245 adult patients in 6668 wards in 2584 hospitals in 56 countries. A general estimation equation methodology was used to develop a model for meal intake, and P-value thresholding was used for model selection. RESULTS The proportion of patients who ate a full meal varied widely (24.7-61.5%) across world regions. The factors that were most strongly associated with reduced food intake on nutritionDay were reduced intake during the previous week (OR: 0.20; 95% CI: 0.17, 0.22), confinement to bed (OR: 0.49; 95% CI: 0.44, 0.55), female sex (OR: 0.53; 95% CI: 0.5, 0.56), younger age (OR: 0.74; 95% CI: 0.64, 0.85) and older age (OR: 0.80; 95% CI: 0.74; 0.88), and low body mass index (OR: 0.84; 95% CI: 0.79, 0.90). The pattern of associated factors was homogenous across world regions. CONCLUSIONS A set of factors that are associated with full meal intake was identified and is applicable to patients hospitalized in any region of the world. Thus, the likelihood for reduced food intake is easily estimated through access to patient characteristics, independent of world regions, and enables the easy personalization of food provision.

Analysis of two different regions of the viral genome revealed that recombination was not restricted to particular sequences. Alignment of the genomic sequences undergoing recombination and examination of the predicted secondary structures of the participating RNAs revealed that the dissociation of partial, newly synthesized negative strand RNAs from the positive strand template occurred at many different sites on the molecule. Similarly, it appeared that the reassociation of the RNA polymerase complex with a second positive strand template was frequently influenced by short regions of homology between the nascent RNA strand and open secondary structures in the template molecule.","Desport, M; Collins, M E; Brownlie, J",Virology,127,28

Yet the relative weighting of insights vs. methodologies in our current research ecosystem tends to skew the computational community away from algorithm evaluation and operationalization, resulting in a well-reported trend towards the proliferation of scientific outcomes of unknown reliability. Algorithm selection and use is hindered by several problems that persist across our field. One is the impact of the self-assessment bias, which can lead to mis-representations in the accuracy of research results. A second challenge is the impact of data context on algorithm performance. Biology and medicine are dynamic and heterogeneous. Data is collected under varying conditions. For algorithms, this means that performance is not universal - and need to be evaluated across a range of contexts. These issues are increasingly difficult as algorithms are trained and used on data collected in the real-world, outside of the traditional clinical research lab. In these cases, data collection is neither supervised nor well controlled and data access may be limited by privacy or proprietary reasons. Therefore, there is a risk that algorithms will be applied to data that are outside of the scope of the intent of the original training data provided. This workshop will focus on approaches that are emerging across the researcher community to quantify the accuracy of algorithms and the reliability of their outputs.","Mangravite, Lara; Mooney, Sean D; Friedberg, Iddo; Guinney, Justin",Pacific Symposium on Biocomputing.

METHODOLOGY Over a 16-month period between 2002 and 2004, 141 eligible patients were prospectively recruited from an urban-based teaching hospital in Malaysia. RESULTS Of the 141 patients, 63 (44.7%) patients (age (standard deviation (SD)) 56 (20.0) years; 50.8% male) received a macrolide-containing antibiotic regimen, while 78 (55.3%; age (SD) 57 (20.2) years; 52.6% male) were on a single broad-spectrum antibiotic only. In total, 39 (27.7%) and 102 (72.3%) patients had severe and 'non-severe' pneumonia, respectively. Irrespective of whether they had severe or non-severe pneumonia, there were no significant differences in mortality (non-severe pneumonia, 6.5% vs. 5.4%, P = 0.804; severe pneumonia, 17.6% vs. 18.2%, P = 0.966), need of ventilation (non-severe pneumonia, 8.7% vs. 3.6%, P = 0.274; severe pneumonia, 23.5% vs. 13.6%, P = 0.425) or median length of hospital stay (non-severe pneumonia, 5.5 vs. 5 days, P = 0.954; severe pneumonia, 7 vs. 6 days, P = 0.401) between the two treatment regimens.

SARS-CoV, a newly-identified single-strand RNA virus, has been identified with common variable property of RNA viruses. In this study, genetic variation of SARS-CoV is analyzed based on available documented data and our study. It suggests that SARS-CoV is of similar mutation frequency and dynamic mutant distributions like other RNA viruses, though relatively less identified variation number than those causing chronic infections. In contrast, the viral spike (S) gene exhibits high variation, while nucleocapsid (N) gene shows relative sequence conservation. No obvious correlation is observed between viral variation and clinical disease manifestation from present analyzed data.","Xu, Dong-Ping; Wang, Fu-Sheng; Zhang, Ling-Xia",Yi chuan xue bao = Acta genetica Sinica,127,24

METHODS: We prospectively assessed the medical records, laboratory results, chest CT images and use of medication in a cohort of patients presenting to two designated covid-19 treatment centres in Sichuan, China. Outcomes of interest included death, admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), need for mechanical ventilation, treatment with vasoactive agents and classification of disease severity. Acute myocardial injury was defined by a value of high-sensitivity troponin T (hs-TnT) greater than the normal upper limit. RESULTS: A total of 101 cases were enrolled from January to 10 March 2020 (average age 49 years, IQR 34-62 years). Acute myocardial injury was present in 15.8% of patients, nearly half of whom had a hs-TnT value fivefold greater than the normal upper limit. Patients with acute myocardial injury were older, with a higher prevalence of pre-existing cardiovascular disease and more likely to require ICU admission (62.5% vs 24.7%, p=0.003), mechanical ventilation (43.5% vs 4.7%, p<0.001) and treatment with vasoactive agents (31.2% vs 0%, p<0.001). Log hs-TnT was associated with disease severity (OR 6.63, 95% CI 2.24 to 19.65), and all of the three deaths occurred in patients with acute myocardial injury. CONCLUSION: Acute myocardial injury is common in patients with COVID-19 and is associated with adverse prognosis.","Wei, Jia-Fu; Huang, Fang-Yang; Xiong, Tian-Yuan; Liu, Qi; Chen, Hong; Wang, Hui; Huang, He; Luo, Yi-Chun; Zhou, Xuan; Liu, Zhi-Yue; Peng, Yong; Xu, Yuan-Ning; Wang, Bo; Yang, Ying-Ying; Liang, Zong-An; Lei, Xue-Zhong; Ge, Yang; Yang, Ming; Zhang, Ling; Zeng, Ming-Quan; Yu, He; Liu, Kai; Jia, Yu-Heng; Prendergast, Bernard D; Li, Wei-Min; Chen, Mao",Heart,127,1

Focusing on the experience of frontline officers, this paper explores how the Chinese prison system contained the spread of COVID-19 inside its walls by demanding officers work on 'lockdown shifts', and what we can learn about its governing logic. Multi-sourced data is utilized, including government-issued policies and reports, media reports, blog posts written by prison officers and participant observation as well as semi-structured interviews with frontline prison officers. This study offers a diachronic analysis of pandemic control within the prison system, focusing on key turning points. By examining frontline prison officers' accounts through first- and second-hand data, the study explores the execution of control policies and how they affect individual lives. The study found that prison officers were ordered to fight at the forefront of pandemic control in prisons by working on shifts inside for an extended and indefinite period of time, which proved effective in terminating the spread of the virus, but placed a heavy burden on the personal lives of the officers. The findings also reveal new facets in the mobility and experience of frontline officers.

While didactic courses moved online, laboratory courses were not amenable to this shift. In particular, assessment of clinical skills courses through common methods including objective structured clinical examinations (OSCEs) became inadvisable. This article describes decisions made for first-, second-, and third-year veterinary students (n = 368) with respect to clinical skills at one US college. This includes the remote completion of a surgical skills curriculum using instructional videos and models and the delaying of laboratory sessions deemed impossible to deliver remotely. First- and third-year students were subsequently assessed using modified remote OSCEs. Second-year students were assessed using the standard surgical skills examination, video-recorded. All first- and third-year students successfully passed their OSCE upon either first attempt or remediation. Two second-year students failed their remediation examination and were offered additional faculty tutoring and another remediation attempt at the start of the fall semester. The remediation rate on the surgical skills examination was not different from that of previous years. One incident of suspected academic dishonesty occurred in the first-year OSCE. Students learned surgical skills successfully at home by practicing on models and receiving feedback of their skills on video recordings. While disappointing, one case of academic dishonesty among the 368 total students tested was not surprising. Remote assessment using modified OSCEs and surgical skills exams appears feasible and fair when in-person testing is not possible.","Hunt, Julie A; Anderson, Stacy L",J Vet Med Educ,127,22

The underlying mechanisms of PEDV infection and the reasons why newborn piglets are more susceptible than older pigs remain incompletely understood. Iron deficiency is common in newborn piglets. Here we found that high levels of transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1) distributed in the apical tissue of the intestinal villi of newborns, and intracellular iron levels influence the susceptibility of newborn piglets to PEDV. We show that iron deficiency induced by deferoxamine (DFO, an iron chelating agent) promotes PEDV infection while iron accumulation induced by ferric ammonium citrate (FAC, an iron supplement) impairs PEDV infection in vitro and in vivo. Besides, PEDV infection was inhibited by occluding TfR1 with antibodies or decreasing TfR1 expression. Additionally, PEDV infection was increased in PEDV-resistant Caco-2 and HEK 293T cells over-expressed porcine TfR1. Mechanistically, the PEDV S1 protein interacts with the extracellular region of TfR1 during PEDV entry, promotes TfR1 re-localization and clustering, then activates TfR1 tyrosine phosphorylation mediated by Src kinase, and heightens the internalization of TfR1, thereby promoting PEDV entry. Taken together, these data suggest that the higher expression of TfR1 in the apical tissue of the intestinal villi caused by iron deficiency, accounts for newborn piglets being acutely susceptible to PEDV.","Zhang, Shuai; Cao, Yanan; Yang, Qian",PLoS Pathog,127,16

The membrane bound angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) serves as the entry point of COVID-19 2. Conversely, it supports an anti-inflammatory pathway. This led to the controversy of the impact of medications, which influence its expression. ACE2 is part of the wider renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and is upregulated via compounds, which inhibits the classical ACE, thereby plasma aldosterone and aldosterone receptor (MR) activation. MR activation may therefore protect organs from binding the COVID-19 by reducing ACE2 expression. Glycyrrhizin (GL) is a frequent component in traditional Chinese medicines, which have been used to control COVID-19 infections. Its systemically active metabolite glycyrrhetinic acid (GA) inhibits 11beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase(11betaHSD2) and activates MR in organs, which express this enzyme, including the lungs. Does this affect the protective effect of ACE2? Importantly, GL has anti-inflammatory properties by itself via toll like receptor 4 (TLR4) antagonism and therefore compensates for the reduced protection of the downregulated ACE2. Finally, a direct effect of GL or GA to reduce virus transmission exists, which may involve reduced expression of type 2 transmembrane serine protease (TMPRSS2), which is required for virus uptake. Glycyrrhizin may reduce the severity of an infection with COVID-19 at the two stages of the COVID-19 induced disease process, 1. To block the number of entry points and 2. provide an ACE2 independent anti-inflammatory mechanism.","Murck, Harald",Front Immunol,127,32

The sharp increase in the number of patients has led to great psychological pressure on health care workers. The purpose of this study was to understand their mental health status and needs, so as to provide a scientific basis for alleviating the psychological pressure of health care workers. METHODS: Using a cross-sectional study design, 540 health care workers were randomly selected from two designated tuberculosis medical institutions in Anhui Province. The basic situation, perceived social support, depression level, loneliness and COVID-19 related knowledge were collected and analyzed by questionnaire. RESULTS: A total of 511 valid questionnaires were finally retrieved. There were 139 people in epidemic prevention and control positions (27.20%). Depression level: People in isolation ward, fever clinic and pre-check triage were at the level of mild to moderate depression. Female was higher than male; nurse was higher than doctor; middle and junior job titles were higher than senior titles; junior college degree or below were higher than bachelor's degree, master's degree and above; isolation ward, fever clinic and pre-check triage were significantly higher than those of non-prevention and control positions (p < 0.05). Loneliness scores: Doctors were higher than that of medical technicians, and isolation ward, fever clinic and pre-check triage were higher than those of other medical departments (p < 0.05). Social support: Doctors were lower than that of medical technicians, and isolation ward, fever clinic and pre-check triage were significantly lower than those of other departments (p < 0.05). The score of social support was negatively correlated with depression and loneliness (p < 0.001), while depression was positively correlated with loneliness (p < 0.001). Health care workers most want to receive one-to-one psychological counseling (29.75%), and provide crisis management (24.07%). The awareness rate of health care workers on COVID-19's knowledge was relatively high. CONCLUSIONS: The psychological problems of health care workers, especially women, nurses with low educational background, low professional title, and staff in the epidemic prevention and control positions are relatively serious.","Fang, Xue-Hui; Wu, Li; Lu, Lun-Shan; Kan, Xiao-Hong; Wang, Hua; Xiong, Yan-Jun; Ma, Dong-Chun; Wu, Guo-Cui",BMC Psychiatry,127,1

People were admitted to hospitals complaining of fever, fatigue, cough, and difficulty breathing. Consequently, the strategy being adopted to limit the spread of COVID-19 is to encourage people in society to follow preventive measures. We aimed to estimate how the knowledge of and compliance with safe distancing measures affected the progression of the COVID-19 pandemic in Saudi Arabia during Holy Ramadan. A cross-sectional survey was implemented in the central regions of Saudi Arabia from 24th of April to 22nd May to coincide with Ramadan. The study was conducted using a Google forum distributed through social media. Participants were recruited through convenience sampling of the Saudi population. In total, 1515 participants completed the survey. A significant difference between males and females was observed in answering questions about committing to: not attending gatherings, keeping a safe distance, not making physical contact, and staying at home during partial lockdown. In general, participants in our study demonstrated excellent adherence to all social distance measures, considered essential for limiting the spread and progression of COVID-19. However, attitudes regarding reduced physical contact was poor in the Makkah region, which necessitates greater efforts to educate and inform people about the associated risks.","Nouf, Alotaibi Sattam Almutairi Moawad Alotaibi Alotaibi M.

Vaccination against SARS-COV-2 holds promise for reduction in COVID-19. This operational analysis describes the proportion of SARS-COV-2 positive tests before, during, and after vaccination. DESIGN: Retrospective longitudinal cohort analysis from October 1, 2020 until February 14, 2021. SETTING: A total of 130 Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Community Living Centers (CLC), analogous to nursing homes. INTERVENTION: Vaccination for SARS-CoV-2. MEASUREMENTS: The primary measure is the proportion of SARS-CoV-2 positive tests among CLC residents. In a pooled analysis of weekly testing and vaccine data, the proportion of positive tests was compared for the unvaccinated, first dose, and second dose. For each CLC, we identified the week in which 50% of CLC residents were vaccinated (index week). The analysis aligned the index week for CLCs and examined the proportion of SARS-CoV-2 positive tests at the CLC level before and after. As a reference, we plotted the proportion of positive tests in nursing homes in the same county as the CLC using publicly reported data. RESULTS: Within the pooled VA CLCs, the first SARS-CoV-2 vaccine dose was delivered to 50% of CLC residents within 1 week of availability and second dose within 5 weeks. Relative to the index week, the risk ratio of SARS-CoV-2 positive tests in the vaccinated relative to unvaccinated was significantly lower in Week 4 (relative risk 0.37, 95% confidence interval 0.20-0.68). Throughout the study period, the proportion of SARS-CoV-2 positive tests in community nursing homes was higher compared to VA CLC and also declined after vaccine availability. CONCLUSION: The proportion of SARS-CoV-2 positive tests significantly declined in VA CLCs 4 weeks after vaccine delivery and continued to decline in vaccinated and unvaccinated residents. The results describe the importance of SARS-CoV-2 surveillance and vaccination in VA nursing home residents.","Rudolph, James L; Hartronft, Scotte; McConeghy, Kevin; Kennedy, Michael; Intrator, Orna; Minor, Lisa; Hubert, Terrence L; Goldstein, Mary K",J. am. geriatr. soc,127,32

Moreover, we study the Spanish legal framework on public health, including the General Sanitary Law, the General Public Health Law, with a special attention to the art. 3 of Organic Law 3/1986, 14 April, on special measures in the field of public health, which attributes to the health authorities a huge competence to be able to adopt, in a situation of sanitary crisis such as the current one, decisions that, with the necessary guarantees, suppose a restriction or limitation of rights, including fundamental ones as in the case of confinement. These limitations on fundamental rights require a judicial authorization or ratification.

Results of a large-scale study of 502 participants show that students suffered from stress and two types of COVID-19-related anxiety: disease and consequences. Students preference for organization was the only factor that significantly promoted their perceived control over time, which contributes to reducing stress, hence, anxiety. However, female students reported higher stress and anxiety levels than male students. Graduate students reported higher anxiety levels related to the consequences of the pandemic compared to undergrads. To promote students preference for organization, we map the three categories of organization to corresponding persuasive strategies which could be used in the design of persuasive interventions.

We aim to evaluate the effects of HCQ on cardiac conduction, thus contributing to the global understanding of implications of HCQ use. Methods: We reviewed 717 cases of nonmalaria patients treated with HCQ (302) or without HCQ (415) in our hospital from 2008 to 2019, analyzed the cardiac conduction recorded by electrocardiogram (122 vs. 180) including heart rate (HR), PR, and corrected-QT (QTc) intervals, and explored the relationship of cardiac conduction with age, HCQ dosage, HCQ duration, sex, and primary diseases in HCQ users. Results: The all-cause mortality is similar between HCQ and non-HCQ groups (4.0 vs. 4.3%, p = 0.85). Patients aged 45 years or older, not younger ones, have lower HR (80.1 ± 1.7 vs. 85.7 ± 1.8 bpm, p = 0.03) but longer PR (163 ± 3.4 vs. 146.6 ± 4.2 ms, p = 0.003) and QTc (417.8 ± 3.8 vs. 407.7 ± 2.7 ms, p = 0.03) in HCQ than those in non-HCQ. The age in the HCQ group is positively correlated with PR (R = 0.31, p &lt; 0.01) and QTc (R = 0.34, p &lt; 0.01) but not HR. HR, PR, and QTc are not related to HCQ dosage (0.1-0.6 g/day), HCQ duration (0.2-126 months), sex, primary diseases, and repeated exams. Conclusion: Age is the most important risk factor of HCQ on cardiac conduction in nonmalaria patients.

Extensive media coverage has focused on South Korea’s testing capacity as the primary reason, but there has been little discussion of the vital role of the smart city. In this paper, we describe how smart city technologies form a crucial part of disease control in South Korea, explain the social conditions for the extensive use of smart city technology, and offer critical insights into contemporary discussions on the issue of smart cities and surveillance.","Won Sonn, Jung; Lee, Jae Kwang",Eurasian Geogr.

The city has approximately 2 million residents living in 763 favelas. There is no strategic planning on the part of the government with coordinated actions related to the specificities of these territories-producing an escalation of demands due to the living and health conditions of the residents. It is in this multifaceted reality, with urgencies and emergencies, that we highlight the role of community by strengthening the local support networks that are built like webs inside the favela and beyond. Our statement is based on a qualitative study involving 111 such women, distributed across 105 favelas. Correlating their practices, 97% say they support health promotion through the strengthening of popular participation towards community development and defense of rights, and mobilization of health services to meet these populations' needs, among other actions. With the presence of public agents in these places restricted in times of pandemic, these women often take up the duties of the local authorities to ensure food security, good communication among local residents on health standards, hygiene measures, assistance to the most vulnerable, etc. Perceived by community members as replacing the role of government agencies, they develop a particular way of doing politics. Calling upon resistance and solidarity, they transform this micro-power into effective changes to cope with the inequities and in benefit of citizenship and the other residents of the favelas where they live.","Nunes, Nilza Rogeria De Andrade",Glob Health Promot,127,32

Since then the virus has infected over 9.1 million individuals and resulted in over 470,000 deaths worldwide (as of June 24, 2020). Here, we discuss the spatial correlation between county population health rankings and the incidence of COVID-19 cases and COVID-19 related deaths in the United States. We analyzed the spread of the disease based on multiple variables at the county level, using publicly available data on the numbers of confirmed cases and deaths, intensive care unit beds and socio-demographic, and healthcare resources in the U.S. Our results indicate substantial geographical variations in the distribution of COVID-19 cases and deaths across the US counties. There was significant positive global spatial correlation between the percentage of Black Americans and cases of COVID-19 (Moran I = 0.174 and 0.264, p < 0.0001). A similar result was found for the global spatial correlation between the percentage of Black American and deaths due to COVID-19 at the county level in the U.S. (Moran I = 0.264, p < 0.0001). There was no significant spatial correlation between the Hispanic population and COVID-19 cases and deaths; however, a higher percentage of non-Hispanic white was significantly negatively spatially correlated with cases (Moran I = -0.203, p < 0.0001) and deaths (Moran I = -0.137, p < 0.0001) from the disease. This study showed significant but weak spatial autocorrelation between the number of intensive care unit beds and COVID-19 cases (Moran I = 0.08, p < 0.0001) and deaths (Moran I = 0.15, p < 0.0001), respectively. These findings provide more detail into the interplay between the infectious disease and healthcare-related characteristics of the population.

The scientific community and the political authorities fear an epidemic of suicide secondary to this crisis. The aim of this review is to analyze the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the dimensions of the suicidal process and its interaction with the various risk factors. We also propose innovative strategies to manage suicidal behavior in the context of pandemic. METHODS: We carried out a narrative review of international publications dealing with major pandemics (COVID-19, SARS) and their influence on suicidal vulnerability. RESULTS: Many factors are likely to increase the emergence of suicidal ideation and suicide attempts during this crisis. Social distancing and quarantine could increase the feeling of disconnection and the perception of social pain in vulnerable individuals. Some populations at high suicidal risk could be further impacted by the current pandemic: the elderly, medical staff and individuals exposed to economic insecurity. Several innovative tools adapted to the constraints of social distancing and quarantine may prevent suicide risk: e-health, VigilanS, buddhist-derived practices and art engagement. CONCLUSIONS: This unprecedented crisis may interact with certain dimensions of the suicidal process. However, it is time to innovate. Several suicide prevention tools all have their place in new modes of care and should be tested on a large scale.","Conejero, I; Berrouiguet, S; Ducasse, D; Leboyer, M; Jardon, V; Olié, E; Courtet, P",Encephale,127,1

The results of this study have implications for the effect of COVID-19 anxiety on those who are most vulnerable in the current pandemic, particularly with regards to isolation and social connection; those who are most anxious about the pandemic might spend less time trying to connect with their older friends and relatives, and likewise for the people in their lives who might have a disability.","Arcieri, Amanda A",Psychol Rep,127,1

However, there is more, as the SARS-CoV-2 dysregulates not only innate immune mechanisms but also T and B cell repertoires. Most genetic, hematological and immunological studies in COVID-19 are at present phenomenological. However, these and antecedent studies contain the seed grains to resolve many unanswered questions and a whole range of testable hypotheses. What are the links, if existing, between genetics and the occurrence of interferon-neutralizing antibodies? Are NAGGED (neutralizing and generated by gene defect) antibodies involved or not? Is the autoimmune process cause or consequence of virus infection? What are the roles played by cytokine posttranslational modifications, such as proteolysis, glycosylation, citrullination and others? How is systemic autoimmunity linked with type 1 interferons? These questions place cytokines and growth factors at pole positions as keys to unlock basic mechanisms of infection and (auto)immunity. Related to cytokine research, (1) COVID-19 patients develop neutralizing autoantibodies, mainly against alpha interferons and it is not yet established whether this is the consequence or cause of virus replication. (2) The glycosylation of recombinant interferon-beta protects against breaking tolerance and the development of neutralizing antibodies. (3) SARS-CoV-2 induces severe inflammation and release of extracellular proteases leading to remnant epitopes, e.g. of cytokines. (4) In the rare event of homozygous cytokine gene segment deletions, observed neutralizing antibodies may be named NAGGED antibodies. (5) Severe cytolysis releases intracellular content into the extracellular milieu and leads to regulated degradation of intracellular proteins and selection of antibody repertoires, similar to those observed in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. (6) Systematic studies of novel autoimmune diseases on single cytokines will complement the present picture about interferons. (7) Interferon neutralization in COVID-19 constitutes a preamble of more studies about cytokine-regulated proteolysis in the control of autoimmunity. Here we reformulate these seven conjectures into testable questions for future research.","Opdenakker, Ghislain; Van Damme, Jo",Cytokine Growth Factor Rev,127,16

Besides the diagnosis of infection and detection of bacteria, fungi and virus in solution or powder samples have been achieved by ATP-derived self-luminescence as the light source. In this inspirational note, we provide an overview on latest progress in the PDT and microbial detection by self-luminescent systems with an emphasis on the bioluminescence and ECL.","Zhang, Endong; Huang, Yiming; Wang, Shu",Drug deliv. transl. res.

Because fibrosis with persistent physiological deficit is a previously described feature of patients recovering from similar coronaviruses, treatment represents an early opportunity to modify the disease course, potentially preventing irreversible impairment.Objectives: Determine the incidence of and describe the progression of persistent inflammatory interstitial lung disease (ILD) following SARS-CoV-2 when treated with prednisolone.Methods: A structured assessment protocol screened for sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonitis. Eight hundred thirty-seven patients were assessed by telephone 4 weeks after discharge. Those with ongoing symptoms had outpatient assessment at 6 weeks. Thirty patients diagnosed with persistent interstitial lung changes at a multidisciplinary team meeting were reviewed in the interstitial lung disease service and offered treatment. These patients had persistent, nonimproving symptoms.Results: At 4 weeks after discharge, 39% of patients reported ongoing symptoms (325/837) and were assessed. Interstitial lung disease, predominantly organizing pneumonia, with significant functional deficit was observed in 35/837 survivors (4.8%). Thirty of these patients received steroid treatment, resulting in a mean relative increase in transfer factor following treatment of 31.6% (standard deviation [SD] ± 27.6, P < 0.001), and forced vital capacity of 9.6% (SD ± 13.0, P = 0.014), with significant symptomatic and radiological improvement.Conclusions: Following SARS-CoV-2 pneumonitis, a cohort of patients are left with both radiological inflammatory lung disease and persistent physiological and functional deficit. Early treatment with corticosteroids was well tolerated and associated with rapid and significant improvement. These preliminary data should inform further study into the natural history and potential treatment for patients with persistent inflammatory ILD following SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Myall, Katherine Jane; Mukherjee, Bhashkar; Castanheira, Ana Margarida; Lam, Jodie L; Benedetti, Giulia; Mak, Sze Mun; Preston, Rebecca; Thillai, Muhunthan; Dewar, Amy; Molyneaux, Philip L; West, Alex G",Ann Am Thorac Soc,127,32

Whether adults with obesity can achieve weight loss with once-weekly semaglutide at a dose of 2.4 mg as an adjunct to lifestyle intervention has not been confirmed. METHODS: In this double-blind trial, we enrolled 1961 adults with a body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) of 30 or greater (&#8805;27 in persons with &#8805;1 weight-related coexisting condition), who did not have diabetes, and randomly assigned them, in a 2:1 ratio, to 68 weeks of treatment with once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide (at a dose of 2.4 mg) or placebo, plus lifestyle intervention. The coprimary end points were the percentage change in body weight and weight reduction of at least 5%. The primary estimand (a precise description of the treatment effect reflecting the objective of the clinical trial) assessed effects regardless of treatment discontinuation or rescue interventions. RESULTS: The mean change in body weight from baseline to week 68 was -14.9% in the semaglutide group as compared with -2.4% with placebo, for an estimated treatment difference of -12.4 percentage points (95% confidence interval [CI], -13.4 to -11.5; P<0.001). More participants in the semaglutide group than in the placebo group achieved weight reductions of 5% or more (1047 participants [86.4%] vs. 182 [31.5%]), 10% or more (838 [69.1%] vs. 69 [12.0%]), and 15% or more (612 [50.5%] vs. 28 [4.9%]) at week 68 (P<0.001 for all three comparisons of odds). The change in body weight from baseline to week 68 was -15.3 kg in the semaglutide group as compared with -2.6 kg in the placebo group (estimated treatment difference, -12.7 kg; 95% CI, -13.7 to -11.7). Participants who received semaglutide had a greater improvement with respect to cardiometabolic risk factors and a greater increase in participant-reported physical functioning from baseline than those who received placebo. Nausea and diarrhea were the most common adverse events with semaglutide; they were typically transient and mild-to-moderate in severity and subsided with time. More participants in the semaglutide group than in the placebo group discontinued treatment owing to gastrointestinal events (59 [4.5%] vs. 5 [0.8%]). CONCLUSIONS: In participants with overweight or obesity, 2.4 mg of semaglutide once weekly plus lifestyle intervention was associated with sustained, clinically relevant reduction in body weight.

These measures tend to have been derived from communally orientated East Asian cultures. The way that culturally relevant concepts of rights and freedoms underpin COVID restrictions in democratic and individually orientated countries remains unknown. This data memo addresses this issue through analysis of pro- and anti-restriction discourse on social media in the US. It finds that anti-social and economic restriction discourse more frequently articulates rights and freedoms, based on ideas of inviolable rights to freedom of movement or freedom of economic activity or a cost-benefit analysis that places economic activity over public health. Pro-social and economic restriction discourse less frequently mentions rights and freedoms, instead supporting restrictions as following state and medical advice and out of deference and respect to medical professionals. Discourse is highly polarised and divisive and articulated largely through established political identity positions. It is suggested that more attention is paid to discussions of balancing rights and freedoms in COVID control restrictions. To convince opposers of restrictions, supporters of restrictions should base arguments around communal rights and positive freedoms. It is also important to critically evaluate whether and how these perspectives need to be adapted to be appropriate and resonant in democratic and individualistic countries.","Bolsover, Gillian",,127,20

This carries cost and capacity implications for hospitals with additional strain on endoscopy units during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. The Kangaroo Feeding Tube with IRIS Technology (IRIS) uses optical visualization to guide bedside placement, obviating the need for endoscopy. We describe a case series of bedside postpyloric enteral feeding tube placement using the IRIS tube. METHODS: This was a prospective, single-center case series over 12 mo. Conscious and sedated adult participants were included. Exclusion criteria were altered anatomy and need for endoscopy for other indications. IRIS placement was confirmed by contrast radiograph. RESULTS: Twenty attempts were made in 19 participants (13 women). The primary indication was intolerance of gastric feeding. The overall success rate was 75%. In sedated participants, 5 (83%) of 6 tubes were successful in 5 participants. In conscious participants, 10 (71%) of 14 tubes were successful in 14 participants. Placement failure in conscious participants was due to intolerance of the camera tip during nasal passage. The median procedure time was 13.5 min. In all cases, correct position as deemed by the operator was confirmed with contrast radiograph. No complications were observed. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the largest single series of bedside postpyloric enteral feeding tube placement using the IRIS tube to date. The success rate and safety profile reported here, together with the potential benefits (reduced feeding delays, costs, and need for endoscopy) suggest that further, large-scale studies are warranted.","Cardona, Eva; Mehta, Shameer",Nutrition,127,1

This paper aims to analyse the impact on surgical block utilisation and efficiency in an orthopaedics reference centre in Northern Italy. METHODS: The timeframe chosen for the current analysis was April 2020, to be compared with the corresponding period in 2019. Number and type of procedures, first case delay, occupancy rate, and turnover time were used as indicators to benchmark the activities. RESULTS: The overall number of surgical procedures decreased by 57%, from 537 in 2019 to 230 in the same timeframe in 2020. Orthopaedic procedures predominated in 2019, with 434 cases (80.8%), while in 2020, trauma was the leading activity, with 200 cases (86.9%). Orthopaedic surgery had a relative decrement of 93% while trauma has relatively increased by 94%. Mean first case delay in orthopaedic room (OR) was two hours and 36 minutes (SD 01:40:21) in 2020 compared with only 19 minutes (SD 00:02:15) in 2019. OR occupancy rate was 59% in 2020 compared with 89% in 2019. Turnover time raised from 21 minutes in 2019 to 53 min in 2020. CONCLUSIONS: These data clearly show the deep impact of COVID-19 pandemic on OR facilities. Efficiency indicators fell dramatically in April 2020 compared with the corresponding period in 2019. This scenario will deeply affect both the waiting lists and the economic burden of the hospital. Regaining efficiency and maintaining the quality and safety of the process while restoring elective orthopaedic surgery are among the main challenges that surgeons will face in the next time.","Andreata, Mauro; Faraldi, Martina; Bucci, Eugenia; Lombardi, Giovanni; Zagra, Luigi",Int Orthop,127,1

Also, a correlation with the predicted fatality rate of hospitalized patients in 28 states of Mexico was done. Here, we describe a set of 10 highly immunogenic epitopes, together with different HLA alleles that can efficiently present these epitopes to T cells. Most of these epitopes are located within the S1 subunit of the spike protein, suggesting that this area is highly immunogenic.

A concurrent mixed-methods design examined counselors' experiences with telephone counseling during the COVID-19 pandemic. N = 42 counselors who provided OUD counseling services completed a close-ended, quantitative survey examining their experiences in addressing clients' anxiety, depression, anger, substance use, therapeutic relationship, and substance use recovery using telephone counseling. The survey also assessed comfort, convenience, and satisfaction with telephone counseling. Counselors also completed open-ended responses examining satisfaction, convenience, relationship with patients, substance use, and general feedback with telephone counseling. The synthesis of quantitative and qualitative evidence indicated that a majority of counselors had positive experiences with using telephone counseling to provide services to clients undergoing OUD treatment. Convenience, greater access to clients, and flexibility were among the reasons cited for their positive experience. However, counselors also expressed that the telephone counseling was impersonal, and that some clients may have difficulties accessing appropriate technology for telehealth adoption. Findings suggest that further research with counselors is needed to identify the key elements of an effective integration of telephone counseling with traditional in-person treatment approaches in the post-pandemic era.","Martin, Rosemarie; Kang, Augustine W; DeBritz, Audrey A; Walton, Mary R; Hoadley, Ariel; DelaCuesta, Courtney; Hurley, Linda",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),127,24

After a first section in which we deal with a framework of very slow test capacity, we turn to the model recently introduced/implemented by Liu, Magal, Seydi and Webb. First, we prove some basic structural results for the corresponding ODE, as for instance the convergence of S(t) to a positive limit. These are similar to those of the classical SIR model, although the maxima of the corresponding curves are not necessarily unique. Finally, we implement the model -- but with a variable transmission rate -- in the Chilean context. A key parameter adjustment (namely, the fraction of unreported cases) is done via an argument using mortality rates. We conclude with several conclusions and lines of future research.","Navas, Andr'es; Vergara-Hermosilla, Gast'on",,127,1

Effective contact tracing of potentially exposed health care workers is crucial for the prevention and control of infectious disease outbreaks in the health care setting. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the comparative effectiveness of contact tracing during the COVID-19 pandemic through the real-time locating system (RTLS) and review of the electronic medical record (EMR) at the designated hospital for COVID-19 response in Singapore. METHODS: Over a 2-day study period, all admitted patients with COVID-19, their ward locations, and the health care workers rostered to each ward were identified to determine the total number of potential contacts between patients with COVID-19 and health care workers. The numbers of staff-patient contacts determined by EMR reviews, RTLS-based contact tracing, and a combination of both methods were evaluated. The use of EMR-based and RTLS-based contact tracing methods was further validated by comparing their sensitivity and specificity against self-reported staff-patient contacts by health care workers. RESULTS: Of 796 potential staff-patient contacts (between 17 patients and 162 staff members), 104 (13.1%) were identified by both the RTLS and EMR, 54 (6.8%) by the RTLS alone, and 99 (12.4%) by the EMR alone; 539 (67.7%) were not identified through either method. Compared to self-reported contacts, EMR reviews had a sensitivity of 47.2% and a specificity of 77.9%, while the RTLS had a sensitivity of 72.2% and a specificity of 87.7%. The highest sensitivity was obtained by including all contacts identified by either the RTLS or the EMR (sensitivity 77.8%, specificity 73.4%). CONCLUSIONS: RTLS-based contact tracing showed higher sensitivity and specificity than EMR review. Integration of both methods provided the best performance for rapid contact tracing, although technical adjustments to the RTLS and increasing user compliance with wearing of RTLS tags remain necessary.","Ho, Hanley J; Zhang, Zoe Xiaozhu; Huang, Zhilian; Aung, Aung Hein; Lim, Wei-Yen; Chow, Angela",J Med Internet Res,127,16

The objective of this study was to measure the performance of the Amazon Comprehend Medical ICD-10-CM Ontology Linking API (ACM-ICD10) for detecting the presence of COVID-19-related concepts in a clinical document sample obtained from COVID-19 positive patients. Methods: We obtained all clinical notes of patients who had tested positive for COVID-19 at a large medical institution in the OMNY Health System Database during one month in late 2020. Patients were excluded if the U07.1 ICD-10-CM code was not present in their structured diagnosis data. We processed the notes using ACM-ICD10 and obtained the ICD-10 concept mappings for each note. Results: After exclusions, 63 patients remained for analysis. These 63 patients had 791 diagnoses in their structured diagnosis data. Processing the 1,488 notes of the 63 patients through ACM-ICD10 yielded 81,599 ICD-10 concept mappings, none of which contained the U07.1 code. However, mappings were observed that related to symptoms and alternative diagnoses of COVID-19 including “dyspnea, unspecified” (R06.00;518 times;0.6%), “shortness of breath” (R06.02;505 times;0.6%), “unspecified infectious disease” (B99.9;466 times;0.6%), and “viral infection, unspecified” (B34.9;292 times;0.4%). Specifically, text containing the “covid” substring was mapped to ICD-10 concepts 75 times, most commonly to “viral infection, unspecified” (B34.9;5 times) and “encephalitis and encephalomyelitis, unspecified” (G04.90;5 times). Conclusions: While ACM-ICD10 was not effective at mapping COVID-19-related text to its standard code (U07.1) as recommended by the CDC, it often mapped such text to symptoms and signs of COVID-19 infection. These results suggest that commercial NER tools may need to be recalibrated periodically to account for new and emerging illnesses.","Kumar, V.; Rasouliyan, L.; Long, S.; Rao, M.

Moreover, epidemics caused by viruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the newly emerging SARS-CoV-2 occur during the winter months. The mechanisms underlying the seasonal nature of respiratory viral infections have been examined and debated for many years. The two major contributing factors are the changes in environmental parameters and human behavior. Studies have revealed the effect of temperature and humidity on respiratory virus stability and transmission rates. More recent research highlights the importance of the environmental factors, especially temperature and humidity, in modulating host intrinsic, innate, and adaptive immune responses to viral infections in the respiratory tract. Here we review evidence of how outdoor and indoor climates are linked to the seasonality of viral respiratory infections.

Many of the new modalities are necessary for IHE business. In August 2019, we began collecting and analyzing data from the campus WIFI network. A goal of the research was to answer question like what passive sensing of the IHE WIFI might tell us about the dynamics of the WIFI weather in the IHE ecosystem and what does anonymized data tell us about the IHE ecosystem. The analogy with weather prediction seemed appropriate and a viable approach. Starting Fall 2019, data were collected in the observational phase. In the analysis phase, we applied Singular Spectrum Analysis decomposition, to deconstruct WIFI data from dorms, the central campus dining cafeteria, the recreation center, and other buildings on campus. That analysis led to the identification of clusters of buildings that behaved similarly. Just as in the case of models of the weather, a final component of this research was forecasting. We found that weekly forecast of WIFI behavior in the Fall 2019, were straight forward using SSA and seemed to present behavior of a low dimensional dynamical system. However, in Spring 2020, and the COVID perturbation, the campus ecosystem received a shock and data show that the campus changed very quickly. We found that as the campus moved to conduct remote learning, teaching, the closure of research labs, and the edict to work remotely, SSA forecasting techniques not trained on the Spring 2020, data after the shock, performed poorly. While SSA forecasting trained on a portion of the data did better.","Mcgrath, Jake; Davis, Armen; Curry, James; Gartner, Orrie; Rodrigues, Glenn; Spielman, Seth; Massey, Daniel",,127,20

METHODS: Eighty individuals recovering from COVID-19 (group 1) and 72 healthy controls (group 2) were included in this prospective study. After examining visual acuity, refractive defect detection, anterior and posterior segment examinations, and specular microscopy measurements were calculated from images with at least 100 cells. The mean cell density (CD), mean coefficient of variation (CV), mean hexagonal cell percentage, mean cell area (AVG), and central corneal thickness (CCT) were evaluated. RESULTS: The mean time from diagnosis of the disease in group 1 was 54.25 ± 6.36 days. The mean time elapsed since the PCR test became negative was 38.45 ± 6.87 days. Only four were treated in the hospital. Specular microscopy data showed that the CD was 2713.56 ± 246.25 and 2845.80 ± 299.27 in groups 1 and 2, respectively (p = 0.003). The CV values were 42.92 ± 6.79 and 40.16 ± 5.97, respectively (p = 0.009). The hexagonality were 46.51 ± 7.35 and 49.12 ± 6.87, respectively (p = 0.024).

In the (current) absence of an authoritative national steer in England, professional bodies and local organisations have been developing and disseminating their own ethical guidance. Questions inevitably arise, some of which are particularly pressing during the pandemic, as events are unfolding quickly and the field is becoming crowded. My central question here is: which professional ethical guidance should the professional follow? MAIN BODY: Adopting a working definition of ""professional ethical guidance"", I offer three domains for a healthcare professional to consider, and some associated questions to ask, when determining whether - in relation to any guidance document - they should ""bin it or pin it"". First, the professional should consider the source of the guidance: is the issuing body authoritative or, if not, at least sufficiently influential that its guidance should be followed? Second, the professional should consider the applicability of the guidance, ascertaining whether the guidance is available and, if so, whether it is pertinent. Pertinence has various dimensions, including whether the guidance applies to this professional, this patient and/or this setting, whether it is up-to-date, and whether the guidance addresses the situation the professional is facing. Third, the professional should consider the methodology and methods by which the guidance was produced. Although the substantive quality of the guidance is important, so too are the methods by which it was produced. Here, the professional should ask whether the guidance is sufficiently inclusive - in terms of who has prepared it and who contributed to its development - and whether it was rigorously developed, and thus utilised appropriate processes, principles and evidence. CONCLUSION: Asking and answering such questions may be challenging, particularly during a pandemic. Furthermore, guidance will not do all the work: professionals will still need to exercise their judgment in deciding what is best in the individual case, whether or not this concerns COVID-19. But such judgments can and should be informed (and constrained) by guidance, and hopefully these preliminary observations will provide some useful pointers for time-pressed professionals.","Huxtable, Richard",BMC Med Ethics,127,16

The Arab world has diverse cultural, economic, and social structures, so public choices and decisions also vary. To investigate the changes in behavior related to food shopping and handling, precautions measures, and hygiene practices of the public during the pandemic, a web-based survey tool was developed and conducted on 1074 subjects in three Arab countries, Lebanon, Jordan, and Tunisia, using a snowball sampling technique. The results showed a significant reduction in RTE consumption during the pandemic, as shown in the 19.2% and 12.2% rise in the proportion of respondents not ordering hot and cold RTE food delivery, respectively. Compared to pre-COVID-19 times, a substantial increase in behaviors related to hygiene and disinfection practices (22.0% - 32.2%) was observed with a lesser increase (11.2%) in handwashing practices before food preparation. Moreover, public concerns about contracting COVID-19 from food led to almost doubling the number of Tunisians using cleaning agents for washing fresh fruits and vegetables (e.g., soaps, non-food grade chlorine bleach) besides a 16 % and 26.1% increase in use among the Jordanian and Lebanese, respectively. However, a third of the respondents did not follow instructions on labels for the use of chemical products. In conclusion, this study identified culture-specific shortfalls in handwashing and unsafe food handling practices during COVID-19 in the Arab countries and sheds light on the paramount role of coordinated efforts between the local health authorities and the food safety and public health stakeholders in risk communication. To reduce health risks, there need to be rigorous educational campaigns and targeted messages that reach out to the general audience on hand hygiene, the health effects of haphazard use of unsafe chemical compounds on food, and recommendations on following label instructions.","Faour-Klingbeil, Dima; Osaili, Tareq M; Al-Nabulsi, Anas A; Jemni, Monia; Todd, Ewen C D",Food Control,127,30

Activated monocytes secrete high levels of cytokines. Human monocytes are divided into three major populations: conventional (CD14posCD16neg), non-classical (CD14dimCD16pos), and intermediate (CD14posCD16pos) monocytes. The aim of this study was to analyze whether the distribution of conventional (CD16neg) and CD16pos monocytes is different in patients with COVID-19 and whether the variations could be predictive of the outcome of the disease. METHODS: We performed a prospective study on 390 consecutive patients referred to the Emergency Unit, with a proven diagnosis of SARS-CoV 2 infection by RT-PCR. Using the CytoDiff&#8482; reagent, an automated routine leukocyte differential, we quantified CD16neg and CD16pos monocytes. RESULTS: In the entire population, median CD16neg and CD16pos monocyte levels (0.398 and 0.054×109/L, respectively) were in the normal range [(0.3-0.7×109/L) and (0.015-0.065×109/L), respectively], but the 35 patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) had a significantly (p<0.001) lower CD16pos monocyte count (0.018 × 109/L) in comparison to the 70 patients who were discharged (0.064 × 109/L) or were hospitalized in conventional units (0.058 × 109/L). By ROC curve analysis, the ratio [absolute neutrophil count/CD16pos monocyte count] was highly discriminant to identify patients requiring ICU hospitalization: with a cut-off 193.1, the sensitivity and the specificity were 74.3 and 81.8%, respectively (area under the curve=0.817). CONCLUSIONS: Quantification of CD16pos monocytes and the ratio [absolute neutrophil count/CD16pos monocyte count] could constitute a marker of the severity of disease in COVID-19 patients.","Vasse, Marc; Zuber, Benjamin; Goubeau, Laurie; Ballester, Marie-Christine; Roumier, Mathilde; Delcominette, Frédérique; Habarou, Florence; Jolly, Emilie; Ackermann, Felix; Cerf, Charles; Farfour, Eric; Pascreau, Tiffany",Clin Chem Lab Med,127,21

Aim of this study is to give an overview and to compare COVID-19 childcare and school containment policies in 19 European countries. Methods: We collected data on containment measures among delegates of the European Academy of Pediatrics (EAP), through an online, closed questionnaire in the second half of October 2020. Results: Most policy has been formulated for secondary education. In all three settings policy was most often formulated for individual hygiene, cleaning of surfaces, exclusion of sick children, ventilation, distance between children and between children and teachers. In secondary schools, policy is formulated on face masks in and outside the class. School closure, cancellation of physical education and class size reduction are measures for which the fewest countries have formulated national policies. Conclusion: We recommend to accompany the opening of children's facilities and schools by surveillance studies that further clarify questions about control measures implemented to halt COVID-19 pandemic.","Jansen, Demc Vervoort J.

Accordingly, three typical desulfurization share setups of 80%, 85%, and 90% were compared under various operational conditions by varying the fuel-sulfur content, liquid/gas ratio, and seawater alkalinity. In complying with the desulfurization requirements of emission control areas, 85% was obtained as the optimal desulfurization share among the three setups. Again, under the selected 85% setup, the cascade-scrubbing desulfurization was numerically compared with the conventional once-through open-loop solution, so as to confirm the seawater-saving advantage of the cascade-scrubbing desulfurization technology used for the exhaust gas of large-scale marine diesels. At relatively higher sulfur content above 3.5%, the open-loop solution solely achieved the desulfurization requirements of non-emission control areas by using higher liquid/gas ratio levels of 6.5-8.0 L/Nm3, while fully failed to meet the much stricter requirements of emission control areas except the lowest 1.5% fuel-sulfur conditions. On the contrary, the cascade-scrubbing solution could meet the requirements of emission control areas under various fuel-sulfur content conditions and reduced the liquid/gas ratio by about 45%, in comparison to the open-loop solution.","Wu, Sili; Kuang, Min; Zhao, Minsen; Yang, Guohua; Geng, Xuewen; Hu, Xuehui; Huang, Jun",,127,20

METHODS: In a cross-sectional survey, data were collected by sending a questionnaire to 2000 patients with a demyelinating disease through an online portal system. Collected data included the current MS DMT and patient-reported disability level, history of recent sick contact, recent fever, respiratory symptoms, diagnosis with COVID-19, and the disposition after the diagnosis. We defined a COVID-19-suspect group as patients having fever and cough or fever and shortness of breath, or a presumptive diagnosis based on suggestive chest computed tomography. We calculated the proportion of COVID-19-suspect patients and compared their demographics, clinical characteristics, and DMT categories with the rest of survey-responders, using univariable and multivariable models. RESULTS: Out of 712 patients, 34 (4.8%) fulfilled our criteria for being in the COVID-19-suspect group. Only two patients required hospitalization. No patient required intensive care. In a multivariable model, disease duration (p-value=0.017), DMT category (p-value=0.030), and history of sick contact (p-values<0.001) were associated with the risk of being in the COVID-19-suspect group. Being on B-cell depleting antibodies (as compared to non-cell depleting, non-cell trafficking inhibitor DMTs) was associated with a 2.6-fold increase in the risk of being in the COVID-19-suspect group. (RR: 3.55, 95%CI: 1.45, 8.68, p-value=0.005). CONCLUSIONS: The course of infection in patients with MS suspected of having COVID-19 was mild to moderate, and all patients had a full recovery.

Participants were recruited from 16 general hospitals in Anhui province from February 2020 to March 2020. The general sociodemographic questionnaire, Nurse Job Stressors Scale, Simplified Coping Style Questionnaire, NEO Five-Factor Inventory, Perceived Social Support Scale, and Kessler Psychological Distress Scale were used in this study. Based on 723 valid questionnaires retrieved (100%), the total mean scores of work stressors and mental health of frontline nurses were (94.38±23.42) and (22.81±7.16), respectively. The results of the structural equation model showed that work stressors had an indirect positive effect (ß=0.484, P<0.01), social support had a direct negative effect (ß=-0.934, P<0.01), personality traits had a direct positive effect (ß=0.209, P<0.01), and positive coping style had both direct positive (ß=0.246, P<0.01) and indirect negative effects (ß=-0.873, P<0.01) on frontline nurses' mental health. In conclusion, nursing staff can reinforce positive influences by accepting social support, adopting positive coping methods, and weakening negative influences factors to reduce or buffer their negative mental states and further reduce work stress.","Shaohua, Hu; Dai, Qing; Wang, Ting; Zhang, Qianqian; Li, Chaoqun; He, Hongye",Ann. med.-psychol,127,13

This has led to shortage of donor corneas worldwide. Glycerol preservation of tissue remains a viable option in this scenario. The objective is to compare fresh corneal tissue (FCT) with glycerol-preserved cornea (GPC) in emergency corneal transplantation. Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study conducted in a tertiary care centre of Uttarakhand. Medical records of the patients who underwent therapeutic penetrating keratoplasty (TPK) were reviewed. FCT group included patients who underwent TPK with fresh corneal tissue and GPC group included patients who underwent TPK with glycerol preserved cornea. The indications and outcomes of TPK in the terms of therapeutic success were analysed and compared between both the groups. Results: A total of 94 eyes of 91 patients underwent TPK from October 2011 to August 2017. FCT group included 60 eyes of 57 patients and GPC group included 34 eyes of 34 patients. The primary indication of TPK was infectious keratitis in both the groups (FCT-81.6%; GPC - 91.2%) There was no significant difference in the therapeutic success in both the groups (P = 0.741, Odds ratio- 1.59 with 95% CI- 0.39-6.44). Complications included glaucoma (FCT-21.7%; GPC- 35.2%) graft infection (FCT- 18.33% GPC- 2.9%); graft rejection (FCT-11.66%, GPC- 0%); and graft failure (FCT-88.33%, GPC-100%). Conclusion: The GPC is comparable to FCTs in therapeutic transplant and can be a useful interim procedure in saving the eyes in cases of infective keratitis in the time of crisis.","Gupta, Neeti; Dhasmana, Renu; Maitreya, Amit; Badahur, Harsh",Indian J Ophthalmol,127,23

Its use can be difficult, posing a high risk of contamination, mainly during doffing, then with the risk of becoming infected. METHODS: We conducted a prospective before-and-after design that used clinical simulation as a research methodology in a clinical simulation center of Colombia. A simulation-based educational intervention with two cases related to COVID-19 was proposed in the emergency room and the intensive care unit. We conducted A workshop for donning and doffing of personal protective equipment (PPE) and a debriefing after the first case. RESULTS: In the pre-test, 100% of participants failed donning and doffing PPE, 98.4% were contaminated, only one-person did not contaminate out of. The mean cognitive load was high (7.43±0.9 points). In the post-test, 100% were successful in donning the PPE and 94.8% in doffing; only 9.8% were contaminated. The mean of the cognitive load was low (4.1±1.4 points), and the performance was high (7.9±1.1). Of the total, 73.8% of participants reported overload in the doffing. The most difficulties were in gown/overall, and N95 mask removal. DISCUSSION: The PPE donning and doffing is critical and may be changed significantly by active training. In responding to the current COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, activities of training in donning and doffing PPE would provide a means of training personnel, reducing the cognitive load and maybe the risk of contamination and infection of health care workers.","Díaz-Guio, Diego Andrés; Ricardo-Zapata, Alejandra; Ospina-Velez, Jeniffer; Gómez-Candamil, Gabriel; Mora-Martinez, Santiago; Rodriguez-Morales, Alfonso J",Infez Med,127,1

Six days earlier, the Japan Surgical Society had recommended postponing elective surgical procedures. Along with the growing public fear of COVID-19, hospital visits in Japan decreased. METHODS: Using claims data from the Quality Indicator/Improvement Project (QIP) database, this study aimed to clarify the impact of the first wave of the pandemic, considered to be from March to May 2020, on case volume and claimed hospital charges in acute care hospitals during this period. To make year-over-year comparisons, we considered cases from July 2018 to June 2020. RESULTS: A total of 2,739,878 inpatient and 53,479,658 outpatient cases from 195 hospitals were included. In the year-over-year comparisons, total claimed hospital charges decreased in April, May, June 2020 by 7%, 14%, and 5%, respectively, compared to the same months in 2019. Our results also showed that per-case hospital charges increased during this period, possibly to compensate for the reduced case volumes. Regression results indicated that the hospital charges in April and May 2020 decreased by 6.3% for hospitals without COVID-19 patients. For hospitals with COVID-19 patients, there was an additional decrease in proportion with the length of hospital stay of COVID-19 patients including suspected cases. The mean additional decrease per COVID-19 patient was estimated to 5.5 million JPY. CONCLUSION: It is suggested that the hospitals treating COVID-19 patients were negatively incentivized.","Shin, Jung-Ho; Takada, Daisuke; Morishita, Tetsuji; Lin, Hueiru; Bun, Seiko; Teraoka, Emi; Okuno, Takuya; Itoshima, Hisashi; Nagano, Hiroyuki; Kishimoto, Kenji; Segawa, Hiromi; Asami, Yuka; Higuchi, Takuya; Minato, Kenta; Kunisawa, Susumu; Imanaka, Yuichi",PLoS One,127,16

State-guaranteed COVID-19 loans are widely used by Swiss firms, with 20% of all firms participating, resulting in a sizeable programme of 2.4% of GDP. We use a comprehensive dataset to study the determinants of firm participation. Our results can be summarised as follows. First, participation was largely driven by the exposure of a firm to lockdown restrictions and to the intensity of the virus in the specific region. Second, we show that firms associated with lower liquidity ratios had a significantly higher probability of participating in the programme. Third, we find no clear evidence that firm indebtedness affected participation in the programme and no evidence that pre-existing potential “zombie firms” participated more strongly in the loan programme. Fourth, we show that the programme reached younger and smaller firms, which could be financially more vulnerable as they are less likely to obtain outside finance during a crisis. Overall, we conclude that given its objective, the programme appears to be successful.","Fuhrer, Lucas Marc Marc-Antoine Ramelet Tenhofen Jörn",Swiss Journal of Economics and Statistics,127,16

Tobacco smoking was associated with an increased COVID-19 disease severity (odds ratio range of active vs. never smokers 1.55-2.19 and former vs. never smokers 1.20-2.48) and an increased COVID-19 in-hospital mortality (odds ratio range of active vs. never smokers 1.35-1.51 and former vs. never smokers 1.26-2.58). Beside immediate pulmonary toxic effects through active smoking, the cumulative livelong tobacco exposition and subsequent tobacco-associated diseases seem to predominantly predict adverse outcomes in patients with COVID-19. Data regarding an increased risk of infection among smokers is conflicting. However, a large observational study from England with 2.4 million persons reported an association between tobacco smoking and typical symptoms of COVID-19. For e-cigarettes and vaping less data exist, but experimental and first clinical investigations also suggest an increased risk for adverse outcomes for their use and SARS-CoV-2 infections. Especially during the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic with limited therapeutic options it is particularly important to advise smokers of their increased risks for unfavourable COVID-19 outcomes. Evidence based support for smoking cessation should be offered. In Germany, the existing and well-established methods to support tobacco cessation need to be reimbursed by statutory health insurances.","Raspe, Matthias; Bals, Robert; Hering, Thomas; Pankow, Wulf; Rupp, Alexander; Rustler, Christa; Urlbauer, Matthias; Andreas, Stefan",Pneumologie (Stuttg.),127,1

Using data from Italy and other countries we evaluated the role of different determinants of this phenomenon. We found that the Italian testing strategy could explain an important part of the observed difference in CFR. In particular, the majority of patients that are currently tested in Italy have severe clinical symptoms that usually require hospitalization and this translates to a large CFR. We are confident that, once modifications in the testing strategy leading to higher population coverage are consistently adopted in Italy, CFR will realign with the values reported worldwide.","Barone-Adesi, Francesco; Ragazzoni, Luca; Schmid, Maurizio",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,127,16

METHODS: Description of the first consecutive 100 patients with microbiologically-proven COVID-19 in a large hospital in Madrid, Spain including a minimum of two-month follow up. RESULTS: The median age of the patients (52% males) was 61.5 years (IQR=39.5-82.0) and the median BMI was 28.8 kg/m2 (IQR=24.7-33.7). Overall 72% of the patients had one or more co-morbid conditions with a median age-adjusted Charlson index of 2 (IQR=0-5.7). Five patients (5%) were immunosuppressed. The most common symptoms at the time of diagnosis were fever (80.0%), cough (53.0%) and dyspnea (23.0%). The median O2 saturation at the time of first examination was 94% (IQR=90-97). Chest X-ray on admission was compatible with pneumonia in 63% of the cases (bilateral in 42% and unilateral in 21%). Overall, 30% were managed at home and 70% were admitted to the hospital. Thirteen patients were admitted to the ICU with a median of 11 days of stay in the Unit (IQR=6.0-28.0). CALL score of our population ranged from 4 to 13. Overall, 60.0% of patients received antibiotic treatment and 66.0%, empirical antiviral treatment, mainly with lopinavir/ritonavir (65%) or hydroxychloroquine (42%). Mortality, with a minimum of 60 days of follow up, was 23%. The median age of the deceased patients was 85 years (IQR=79-93). CONCLUSIONS: We found a high mortality in the first 100 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 at our institution, associated with advanced age and the presence of serious underlying diseases.","Muñoz, P; Galar, A; Catalán, P; Valerio, M; Aldamiz-Echevarría, T; Cólliga, C; Bouza, E",Rev Esp Quimioter,127,1

However, the number of confirmed cases depends on the testing policy, and it is important to understand how the number of positive cases obtained using different testing policies reveals the unknown ground truth. We develop an agent-based simulation framework in Python that can simulate various testing policies as well as interventions such as lockdown based on them. The interaction between the agents can take into account various communities and mobility patterns. A distinguishing feature of our framework is the presence of another `flu'-like illness with symptoms similar to COVID-19, that allows us to model the noise in selecting the pool of patients to be tested. We instantiate our model for the city of Bengaluru in India, using census data to distribute agents geographically, and traffic flow mobility data to model long-distance interactions and mixing. We use the simulation framework to compare the performance of three testing policies: Random Symptomatic Testing (RST), Contact Tracing (CT), and a new Location Based Testing policy (LBT). We observe that if a sufficient fraction of symptomatic patients come out for testing, then RST can capture the ground truth quite closely even with very few daily tests. However, CT consistently captures more positive cases. Interestingly, our new LBT, which is operationally less intensive than CT, gives performance that is comparable with CT. In another direction, we compare the efficacy of these three testing policies in enabling lockdown, and observe that CT flattens the ground truth curve maximally, followed closely by LBT, and significantly better than RST.","Gopalan, Aditya; Tyagi, Himanshu",,127,32

Structural regression analysis was used to investigate whether: 1) conspiracy beliefs, a distrust in information sources, and endorsement of CAM predict people's response to the non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) implemented by the government during the COVID-19 pandemic, and 2) conspiracy beliefs, a distrust in information sources, and endorsement of CAM are related to people's willingness to take a COVID-19 vaccine. RESULTS: Individuals with more conspiracy beliefs and a lower trust in information sources were less likely to have a positive response to the NPIs. Individuals with less trust in information sources and more endorsement of CAM were more unwilling to take a COVID-19 vaccine. Distrust in information sources was the strongest and most consistent predictor in all models. Our analyses also revealed that some of the people who respond negatively to the NPIs also have a lower likelihood to take the vaccine. This association was partly related to a lower trust in information sources. CONCLUSIONS: Distrusting the establishment to provide accurate information, believing in conspiracy theories, and endorsing treatments and substances that are not part of conventional medicine, are all associated with a more negative response to the official guidelines during COVID-19. How people respond to the guidelines, however, is more strongly and consistently related to the degree of trust they feel in the information sources, than to their tendency to hold conspiracy beliefs or endorse CAM. These findings highlight the need for governments and health authorities to create communication strategies that build public trust.","Soveri, Anna; Karlsson, Linda C; Antfolk, Jan; Lindfelt, Mikael; Lewandowsky, Stephan",BMC Public Health,127,16

Millets considered as super foods is a major alternative in recent days for traditional diet being rich in proteins and fibre along with trace minerals and vitamins. In this connection, proteins from Buckwheat and Quinoa were digested by in vitro simulation digestion for the generation of peptides, analyzed by nLC-MS/MS and the functional annotations of the identified proteins/peptides were carried out. The study led to the identification of 34 small peptides and their parent proteins clustered into 4 gene functional groups and their localization prediction indicated their involvement in energy metabolism, transport and storage. Interestingly, the identified peptides maximally displayed DPP-IV and ACE inhibitions. The present study was extended to unravel ACE-2 inhibition targeting COVID-19 by selecting ACE-2-Spike binding domain for molecular docking studies. The NWRTVKYG interacted with the ACE-2-Spike interface displaying the feasible binding energy (- 213.63) and docking score (- 12.43) and the MD simulation revealed the ability of the peptide in stabilizing the protein-peptide composite.

We aimed to explore the seroprevalence of hospital staff in the area with zero confirmed COVID-19 case to shed light on the situation of COVID-19 infection in zero or low infection rate countries where mass screening was not readily available. METHODS: A locally developed rapid immunoglobulin M (IgM)/immunoglobulin G (IgG) test kit was used for hospital staff screening of Ranong hospital which is located in a province with zero COVID-19 prevalence in Thailand from 17th April to 17th May 2020. All staff was tested, 100 of which were randomly invited to have a repeating antibody test in one month. (Thai Clinical Trials Registry: TCTR20200426002). RESULTS: Of 844 hospital staff, 82 were tested twice one month apart (response rate for repeating antibody test 82%). Overall, 0.8% of the participants (7 of 844) had positive IgM, none had positive IgG. Female staff had 1.0% positive IgM (95% CI: 0.5-2.1%) while male had 0.5% positive IgM (95% CI: 0.1-2.6%). No participants with a history of travel to the high-risk area or close contact with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 case developed SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Among 844 staff, 811 had no symptoms and six of them developed IgM seropositive (0.7%) while 33 had minor symptoms and only one of them developed IgM seropositive (3.0%). No association between SARS-CoV-2 IgM status and gender, history of travel to a high-risk area, close contact with PCR-confirmed or suspected COVID-19 case, presence of symptoms within 14 days, or previous PCR status was found. None of the hospital staff developed SARS-CoV-2 IgG. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 antibody test could detect a considerable number of hospital staff who could be potential silent spreaders in a province with zero COVID-19 cases. Accurate antibody testing is a valuable screening tool, particularly in asymptomatic healthcare workers.

We assessed COVID-19-related stress, self-isolation stressors, and coping in those with a primary anxiety-related disorder diagnosis, a primary mood disorder diagnosis, and no mental health disorder. METHODS: Adults from a population-representative sample from the United States and Canada who reported current (past year) anxiety-related (n = 700) or mood (n = 368) disorders were compared to a random sample of respondents who did not report a current mental health diagnosis (n = 500) on COVID-19-related stress, self-isolation stress, and coping. RESULTS: The anxiety-related disorders group exhibited higher COVID Stress Scales total scores and higher scores on its fears about danger and contamination, socioeconomic consequences, xenophobia, and traumatic stress symptoms scales than the other groups. The mood disorders group had higher scores on the traumatic stress symptoms and socioeconomic consequences scales than those with no current mental disorder. Those with current anxiety-related or mood disorders were more likely to voluntarily self-isolate and were more likely to report greater self-isolation stressors and distress than those without a mental health disorder. Yet, there were no major differences in perceived effectiveness of coping strategies across groups. CONCLUSION: People with anxiety-related or mood disorders were more negatively affected by COVID-19 compared to those with no mental health disorder; however, adding to psychological burden, those with anxiety-related disorders reported greater fears about danger and contamination, socioeconomic consequences, xenophobia, and traumatic stress symptoms than the other groups. These findings suggest the need for tailoring COVID-19-related mental health interventions to meet the specific needs of people with pre-existing mental health conditions.","Asmundson, Gordon J G; Paluszek, Michelle M; Landry, Caeleigh A; Rachor, Geoffrey S; McKay, Dean; Taylor, Steven",J Anxiety Disord,127,24

The effects of different extract concentrations on the film properties were determined by measuring physicochemical, mechanical and antioxidant properties of the films. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra indicated that strong interactions between the polyphenols present in the MBE and sepiolite were involved in the films. The results suggested that incorporation of Sep-MBE hybrids into the films improved elongation at break, tensile strength, water vapor and UV barrier properties compared to the control film. The antioxidant activity of the films was significantly improved and raised with increasing content of MBE. The release kinetics results of MBE polyphenols from the active films into alcoholic food simulant indicated that the addition of Sep-MBE hybrids to alginate film is able to slow the release of MBE polyphenols.

We show that a quadruped robot can acquire both of these skills by means of hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL). By virtue of their hierarchical structure, our policies learn to implicitly break down this joint problem by concurrently learning High Level (HL) and Low Level (LL) neural network policies. These two levels are connected by a low dimensional hidden layer, which we call latent command. HL receives a first-person camera view, whereas LL receives the latent command from HL and the robot's on-board sensors to control its actuators. We train policies to walk in two different environments: a curved cliff and a maze. We show that hierarchical policies can concurrently learn to locomote and navigate in these environments, and show they are more efficient than non-hierarchical neural network policies. This architecture also allows for knowledge reuse across tasks. LL networks trained on one task can be transferred to a new task in a new environment. Finally HL, which processes camera images, can be evaluated at much lower and varying frequencies compared to LL, thus reducing computation times and bandwidth requirements.","Jain, Deepali; Iscen, Atil; Caluwaerts, Ken",,127,16

Health care needs in the months after COVID-19 diagnosis among nonhospitalized adults have not been well studied. To better understand longer-term health care utilization and clinical characteristics of nonhospitalized adults after COVID-19 diagnosis, CDC and Kaiser Permanente Georgia (KPGA) analyzed electronic health record (EHR) data from health care visits in the 28-180 days after a diagnosis of COVID-19 at an integrated health care system. Among 3,171 nonhospitalized adults who had COVID-19, 69% had one or more outpatient visits during the follow-up period of 28-180-days. Compared with patients without an outpatient visit, a higher percentage of those who did have an outpatient visit were aged &#8805;50 years, were women, were non-Hispanic Black, and had underlying health conditions. Among adults with outpatient visits, 68% had a visit for a new primary diagnosis, and 38% had a new specialist visit. Active COVID-19 diagnoses* (10%) and symptoms potentially related to COVID-19 (3%-7%) were among the top 20 new visit diagnoses; rates of visits for these diagnoses declined from 2-24 visits per 10,000 person-days 28-59 days after COVID-19 diagnosis to 1-4 visits per 10,000 person-days 120-180 days after diagnosis. The presence of diagnoses of COVID-19 and related symptoms in the 28-180 days following acute illness suggests that some nonhospitalized adults, including those with asymptomatic or mild acute illness, likely have continued health care needs months after diagnosis.

Unless belonging to a family, pedestrians in shared spaces are asked to observe a minimal (country-dependent) pairwise distance. Coherently, managers of public spaces may be tasked with the enforcement or monitoring of this constraint. As privacy-respectful real-time tracking of pedestrian dynamics in public spaces is a growing reality, it is natural to leverage on these tools to analyze the adherence to physical distancing and compare the effectiveness of crowd management measurements. Typical questions are:""in which conditions non-family members infringed social distancing?"",""Are there repeated offenders?"", and""How are new crowd management measures performing?"". Notably, dealing with large crowds, e.g. in train stations, gets rapidly computationally challenging. In this work we have a two-fold aim: first, we propose an efficient and scalable analysis framework to process, offline or in real-time, pedestrian tracking data via a sparse graph. The framework tackles efficiently all the questions mentioned above, representing pedestrian-pedestrian interactions via vector-weighted graph connections. On this basis, we can disentangle distance offenders and family members in a privacy-compliant way. Second, we present a thorough analysis of mutual distances and exposure-times in a Dutch train platform, comparing pre-Covid and current data via physics observables as Radial Distribution Functions. The versatility and simplicity of this approach, developed to analyze crowd management measures in public transport facilities, enable to tackle issues beyond physical distancing, for instance the privacy-respectful detection of groups and the analysis of their motion patterns.","Pouw, Caspar A.

Viral infections including SARS-CoV are associated with increased levels of reactive oxygen species, disturbances of Ca++ caused by unfolded protein response (UPR) mediated by endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and is due to the exploitation of virus's own protein i.e., viroporins into the host cells. Several clinical trials are on-going including testing Remdesivir (anti-viral), Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine derivatives (anti-malarial drugs) etc. Unfortunately, each drug has specific limitations. Herein, we review the viral protein involvement to activate ER stress transducers (IRE-1, PERK, ATF-6) and their downstream signals; and evaluate combination therapies for COVID-19 mediated ER stress alterations. Melatonin is an immunoregulator, anti-pyretic, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and ER stress modulator during viral infections. It enhances protective mechanisms for respiratory tract disorders. Andrographolide, isolated from Andrographis paniculata, has versatile biological activities including immunomodulation and determining SARS-CoV-2 binding site. Considering the properties of both compounds in terms of anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anti-pyrogenic, anti-viral and ER stress modulation and computational approaches revealing andrographolide docks with the SARS-CoV2 binding site, we predict that this combination therapy may have potential utility against COVID-19.","Banerjee, Aditi; Czinn, Steven J; Reiter, Russel J; Blanchard, Thomas G",Life Sci,127,1

Persistent systemic inflammation may be provoking vascular dysfunction, an early indication of cardiovascular disease risk. METHODS: In order to establish the potential effects of SARS-CoV-2 on the systemic vasculature in the arms and legs, we performed a cross-sectional analysis of young healthy adults (Control: 5M/15F, 23.0±1.3y, 167±9cm, 63.0±7.4kg) and young adults who, 3-4 weeks prior to testing, had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2: 4M/7F, 20.2±1.1y, 172±12cm, 69.5±12.4kg) (mean±SD). Using Doppler ultrasound, brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (FMD) in the arm and single passive limb movement (sPLM) in the leg were assessed as markers of vascular function. Pulse wave velocity (PWVcf) was assessed as a marker of arterial stiffness. RESULTS: FMD was lower in the SARS-CoV-2 group (2.71±1.21%) compared to the Control group (8.81±2.96%) (P<0.01) and when made relative to the shear stimulus (SARS-CoV-2: 0.04±0.02AU, Control: 0.13±0.06AU, P<0.01). The femoral artery blood flow response, as evidenced by the area under the curve, from the sPLM was lower in the SARS-CoV-2 group (-3±91ml) compared with the Control group (118±114ml) (P<0.01). PWVcf was higher in the SARS-CoV-2 group (5.83±0.62m/s) compared with the Control group (5.17±0.66m/s) (P<0.01).

Based on the example of breast, colorectal and cervical cancer in Poland",12.397845,9.504485,2021,"BACKGROUND: The evolution of bacteria is shaped by different mechanisms such as mutation, gene deletion, duplication, or insertion of foreign DNA among others. These genetic changes can accumulate in the descendants as a result of natural selection. Using phylogeny and genome comparisons, evolutionary paths can be somehow retraced, with recent events being much easier to detect than older ones. For this reason, multiple tools are available to study the evolutionary events within genomes of single species, such as gene composition alterations, or subtler mutations such as SNPs. However, these tools are generally designed to compare similar genomes and require advanced skills in bioinformatics. We present CAPRIB, a unique tool developed in Java that allows to determine the amino acid changes, at the genus level, that correlate with phenotypic differences between two groups of organisms. RESULTS: CAPRIB has a user-friendly graphical interface and uses databases in SQL, making it easy to compare several genomes without the need for programming or thorough knowledge in bioinformatics. This intuitive software narrows down a list of amino acid changes that are concomitant with a given phenotypic divergence at the genus scale. Each permutation found by our software is associated with two already described statistical values that indicate its potential impact on the protein's function, helping the user decide which promising candidates to further investigate. We show that CAPRIB is able to detect already known mutations and uncovers many more, and that this tool can be used to question molecular phylogeny. Finally, we exemplify the utility of CAPRIB by pinpointing amino acid changes that coincided with the emergence of slow-growing mycobacteria from their fast-growing counterparts. The software is freely available at https://github.com/BactSymEvol/Caprib . CONCLUSIONS: CAPRIB is a new bioinformatics software aiming to make genus-scale comparisons accessible to all. With its intuitive graphical interface, this tool identifies key amino acid changes concomitant with a phenotypic divergence. By comparing fast and slow-growing mycobacteria, we shed light on evolutionary hotspots, such as the cytokinin pathway, that are interesting candidates for further experimentations.","Guerra Maldonado, Juan F; Vincent, Antony T; Chenal, Martin; Veyrier, Frederic J",BMC Genomics,127,24

Smartphone technologies and applications have provided the opportunity to capture digital images and easily share them. The smartphone otoscope device was developed as a simple system that can convert a smartphone into a digital otoscope. This device has the prospective ability to improve physician-patient communication and assist with the diagnosis and management of ear disease. Our objective was to evaluate the feasibility and physician/parental satisfaction using the Cellscope® smartphone attachment for at home tympanostomy tube monitoring. METHODS: Children between 6 months and 15 years of age at an urban tertiary children's hospital that were scheduled for bilateral tympanostomy tube insertion or underwent bilateral tympanostomy tube surgery were prospectively enrolled in the study. Comparisons were made between parental home-recorded videos and findings during in-office otoscopy. Two independent otolaryngologists reviewed the videos and concordance between inter-rater agreements was calculated. Acceptability and use questionnaires were administered to physicians and parents. RESULTS: There was good intra-rater agreement between traditional otoscopy and video-otoscopy for tube extruding, tube blocked and tube extruded with at least 80% agreement (P < .05) and excellent inter-rater agreement between physicians for nearly all tube variables (P < .0001) There was a high degree of satisfaction with this mode of surveillance. Parents and physicians agreed that the CellScope® smartphone was easy to use, helpful with the occurrence of acute events, and appeared to improve quality of care. CONCLUSIONS: The CellScope® smartphone is feasible for use in tympanostomy tube surveillance. Use of the device may allow otolaryngologists to easily follow a child's tympanostomy tube remotely over time and offer greater parental satisfaction.","Don, Debra M; Koempel, Jeffrey A; Fisher, Laurel M; Wee, Choo Phei; Osterbauer, Beth",Ann Otol Rhinol Laryngol,127,3

This group, along with those with pre-existing heart and lung disease and diabetes, have accounted for 80% of hospitalizations and an even higher percentage of COVID-19 related deaths in the USA. West Virginia, the only state in the USA located completely within Appalachia, has a higher percentage of elderly than all but two states in the nation. Rural seniors are hesitant to use hospital emergency departments and attend routine care visits for fear of exposure to the virus. Restricted cell phone and internet service may limit effective technological outreach to more isolated rural older adults. More information is needed to develop effective, safe, and acceptable approaches to care for rural, isolated older adults. METHODS: Telephone interviews were conducted with 124 community-dwelling residents in four counties in rural Appalachia between 1 and 22 April 2020. Participants were aged 75 years or older. Descriptive statistics were calculated and Fisher's Exact Test was used to examine for associations among variables. RESULTS: Participants consisted of 86 (69.4%) women and 38 (30.6%) men with an average age of 82.5 years. Telephone contact was the preferred method of contact among all but four participants (96.8%). Seventeen calls (13.7%) resulted in some form of intervention, including arranging for emergent home repairs, treatment of severe hypertension, scheduling urgent laboratory testing, arranging for terminal care, treating acute conditions, and providing durable medical equipment. The 17 participants requiring intervention were significantly more likely to be aged 85 years or older (p=0.004), and report two or more chronic conditions (p<0.001). Those describing themselves as 'lonely' were significantly more likely to live alone (p=0.009) and describe themselves as 'anxious' or 'depressed' (p<0.001). CONCLUSION: A telephone call appears to be the most effective means of communication with patients in these rural Appalachian counties. Patients aged 85 years or older and those living alone should be given highest priority for regular outreach by healthcare providers. In this population, systematically calling rural elderly patients during the COVID-19 epidemic and its aftermath represents an effective strategy for providers who care for elderly rural patients.","Walker, Robert B; Grome, Michael; Rollyson, William; Baus, Adam D",Rural Remote Health,127,1

(this issue), and Willoughby (this issue) on Burns et al. (this issue) provide useful context for comparing three latent variable modeling approaches to understanding psychopathology-the correlated first-order syndrome-specific factors model, the bifactor S - 1 model, and the symmetrical bifactor model. The correlated first-order syndrome-specific factors model has proven useful in constructing explanatory models of psychopathology. The bifactor S - 1 model is also useful for examining the latent structure of psychopathology, especially in contexts with clear theoretical predictions. Joint use of correlated first-order syndrome-specific model and bifactor S - 1 model provides leverage for explaining psychopathology, and both models can also guide individual clinical assessment. In this reply, we further clarify reasons why the symmetrical bifactor model should not be used to study the latent structure of psychopathology and also discuss a restricted bifactor S - 1 model that is equivalent to the first-order syndrome-specific factors model.","Burns, G Leonard; Geiser, Christian; Servera, Mateu; Becker, Stephen P; Beauchaine, Theodore P",J. abnorm. child psychol,127,20

However, the results remain inconclusive. This meta-analysis aimed to provide insights into the association between APOC3 polymorphisms and NAFLD risk. Methods: Studies with terms ""NALFD"" and ""APOC3"" were retrieved from PubMed, Web of Science, CNKI and Wanfang databases up to August 1, 2019. Pooled odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) for the association of APOC3 polymorphisms and NAFLD risk were calculated using fixed and random-effects models. Results: A total of twelve studies from eleven articles were included. Of them, eight studies (1750 cases and 2181 controls) reported the strong association of variant rs2854116 with NAFLD and six studies (1523 cases and 1568 controls) found the association of rs2854117 polymorphism with NAFLD. Overall, a statistically significant association between rs2854116 polymorphism of APOC3 gene and NAFLD risk was found only under dominant model. However, association of rs2854117 polymorphism with NAFLD risk was not detected under all four genetic models. In sub-group analysis of NAFLD subjects based on country, no association among them in China was detected. Besides, four studies analyze the association between the two polymorphisms and clinical characteristics in all subjects or NAFLD patients, and we also failed detect any association between the wild carriers and variant carriers. Conclusion: The meta-analyses suggests that the rs2854116 polymorphism but not rs2854117 polymorphism in APOC3 gene might be a risk factor for NAFLD among Asians. That is, individuals with CT+CC genotype have higher risk of developing NAFLD. However, studies with sufficient sample size are needed for the further validation.","Wang, Jun; Ye, Chuncui; Fei, Sujuan",Afr Health Sci,127,22

We reported 211 COVID-19 patients and 115 influenza patients as two separate cohorts at different locations. Demographic data, medical history, laboratory findings, and radiological characters were summarized and compared between two cohorts, as well as between patients at the intensive care unit (ICU) andnon-ICU within the COVID-19 cohort. For all 326 patients, the median age was 57.0 (interquartile range: 45.0-69.0) and 48.2% was male, while 43.9% had comorbidities that included hypertension, diabetes, bronchitis, and heart diseases. Patients had cough (75.5%), fever (69.3%), expectoration (41.1%), dyspnea (19.3%), chest pain (18.7%), and fatigue (16.0%), etc. Both viral infections caused substantial blood abnormality, whereas the COVID-19 cohort showed a lower frequency of leukocytosis, neutrophilia, or lymphocytopenia, but a higher chance of creatine kinase elevation. A total of 7.7% of all patients possessed no abnormal sign in chest computed tomography (CT) scans. For both infections, pulmonary lesions in radiological findings did not show any difference in their location or distribution. Nevertheless, compared to the influenza cohort, the COVID-19 cohort presented more diversity in CT features, where certain specific CT patterns showed significantly more frequency, including consolidation, crazy paving pattern, rounded opacities, air bronchogram, tree-in-bud sign, interlobular septal thickening, and bronchiolar wall thickening. Differentiable clinical manifestations and CT patterns may help diagnose COVID-19 from influenza and gain a better understanding of both contagious respiratory illnesses.","Zhang, Jianguo; Ding, Daoyin; Huang, Xing; Zhang, Jinhui; Chen, Deyu; Fu, Peiwen; Shi, Yinghong; Xu, Wenrong; Tao, Zhimin",J Med Virol,127,6

While factors affecting the use of online learning are diverse and have been studied by models of use and acceptance of technology, this cross-sectional study explores the factors unique to the current emergency situation that influence students' use and acceptance of emergency online learning. Moreover, it proposes a model to predict a student's cognitive engagement in Mexico, Peru, Turkey, and the USA. This is a quantitative study with an exploratory and descriptive scope and cross-sectional design. Data was collected from 1009 students from the four countries, who completed surveys anonymously. The factors analyzed were attitude, affect, and motivation, perceived behavioral control (ease of use, self-efficacy, and accessibility), and cognitive engagement. The data was analyzed using descriptive, correlation, and regression analysis. The predictive model shows that students' attitude toward online learning impacts their cognitive engagement in Mexico, Peru, and the USA. Furthermore, self-efficacy is a significant moderator for cognitive engagement in all four countries. The model also shows that each country has different determinants for cognitive engagement. Understanding the factors that affect the use of emergency online learning is essential for the success and/or achievement of its maximum benefits in situations like a global pandemic. Limitations of this study have been identified as use of convenience sampling, and an inability to explore factors related to instruction and system attributes. Professors who did not teach online learning lacked knowledge about online educational strategies and used the technological resources that were immediately available to them. Therefore, research that explores the use of instructional strategies and the use of technological systems during emergency online learning is necessary. This study includes suggestions to incorporate open educational resources that use microlearning and emphasizes the importance of student self-efficacy; because it was predictor of cognitive engagement in all four countries. Faculty and higher education institutions can and should develop strategies to increase students' sense of self-efficacy.","Aguilera-Hermida, A Patricia; Quiroga-Garza, Angélica; Gómez-Mendoza, Sanjuana; Del Río Villanueva, Carmen Amalia; Avolio Alecchi, Beatrice; Avci, Dilek",Educ Inf Technol (Dordr),127,20

The paper aims to bridge a research gap in previous studies on pluralistic values and the impact of cultural heritage on sustainability. The comparative case study conducted in Krakow aims to evaluate the functioning and potential of the space towards achieving the following five goals: Accessibility, conservation, mix of functions, aesthetics, comfort and sociability. The perception of these buildings and the public space around them by the city residents, as well as their operation during unexpected circumstances, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, were also evaluated. The author combined an on-site analysis, behavioural mapping and a survey. The results correlate the liveability and aesthetics of public spaces along with the amount and quality of greenery found there with the comfort of users and the popularity of particular places. This paper highlights how important it is to create cultural spaces in a historic city to develop a range of their activities linked to the surrounding public spaces and green areas.

This is a term popularized during the COVID-19 pandemic, as it is one of the most important measures to prevent the spread of this virus. However, the term 'social distancing' can be misleading, as it may imply that individuals should stop socializing. However, socializing in a safe context (i.e. over the phone, video-chat, etc.) is especially important during this time of crisis. Therefore, in this narrative review, we suggest the term 'distant socializing' as more apt expression, to promote physical distancing measures while also highlighting the importance of maintaining social bonds. Further, articles discussing the practice, implementation, measurement, and mental health effects of physical distancing are reviewed. Physical distancing is associated with psychiatric symptoms (such as anxiety and depression), suicidal ideation, and domestic violence. Further, unemployment and job insecurity have significantly increased during COVID-19, which may exacerbate these negative mental health effects. Governments, medical institutions, and public health bodies should therefore consider increasing mental health resources both during and after the pandemic, with a specific focus on frontline workers, COVID-19 survivors, and marginalized communities.","Pandi-Perumal, Seithikurippu R; Vaccarino, Sophie R; Chattu, Vijay Kumar; Zaki, Nevin F W; BaHammam, Ahmed S; Manzar, Dilshad; Maestroni, G J M; Suchecki, Deborah; Moscovitch, Adam; Zizi, Ferdinand; Jean-Louis, Girardin; Narasimhan, Meera; Ramasubramanian, Chellamuthu; Trakht, Ilya; Seeman, Mary V; Shneerson, John M; Maes, Michael; Reiter, Russel J; Kennedy, Sidney H",Pathog Glob Health,127,21

The primary focus is on the regions of recirculating flow that can harbor infectious aerosol for much longer than the well-ventilated parts of the room. Computational fluid dynamics is used to obtain the steady state air flow field, and Lagrangian tracking of particles give the spatial and temporal distribution of infectious aerosol in the domain. It is found that the washbasin located next to the door is in a prominent recirculation zone, and particles injected in this region take much longer to be evacuated. The ventilation rate is found to be governed by the air residence time in the recirculation zone, and it is much higher than the time scale based on fully-mixed reactor model of the room. Increasing the fan flow rate can reduce the ventilation time, but cannot eliminate the recirculation zones in the washroom.","Sinha, Krishnendu; Verma, Utkarsh; Murallidharan, Janani Srree; Kumar, Vivek",,127,1

This disease has alternatively been called Kawasaki-like disease, pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection (PIMS-TS), and multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). These alerts provide a clear starting point from which to study the early response of the medical and scientific community to a new disease in terms of scientific publications, and to compare the timeline of this response with levels of general public interest. To this aim, we conducted a bibliometric analysis of articles on this disease published between 1 April and 5 July 2020. METHOD: A literature search was performed using PubMed and in three preprint repositories. For each article, the name used for the disease in the title, the number of authors, the number of patients, the citations according to Google Scholar, the journal impact factor, and the Altmetric score were retrieved. Google search trends for the terms ""Kawasaki"" and ""COVID,"" ""COVID-19,"" and ""coronavirus"" were also retrieved, as was the number of Reuters news articles published on the topic. These data were compared longitudinally on a weekly basis. The quality of the reporting of the study was evaluated using the STROBE guidelines for observational studies with more than three patients and using the CARE guidelines for case reports of three or fewer patients. RESULTS: Eighty-six articles were included, among which ten were preprints (three of which were subsequently published) and 49 were clinical articles (57%). A total of 857 patients were described. The median number of authors per article was five (range, 1-45), the median number of patients was four (1-186), the median number of citations was one (0-170), the median Altmetric score was 12 (0-7242), and the median journal impact factor was 3.7 (1-74.7). For the clinical articles, the median percentage of STROBE or CARE checklist items satisfied was 70% (IQR, 56.75-79.25; range, 40-90). Guideline adherence was significantly higher for observational studies than for case reports (median percentage of checklist items satisfied, 78.5% vs 61.5%; P<0.001); however, guideline adherence did not differ significantly between peer-reviewed and preprint articles (median percentage of checklist items satisfied, 57% vs 72%; P=0.205). The only statistically significant difference between clinical articles and other types of articles was the number of authors (median, 7 vs 2; P=2.53E-9). Fifty-seven of the 86 articles were authored by researchers from just three countries (the USA, 31; France, 14; and the UK, 12). The names most frequently used in the title were Kawasaki-like disease (n=37), followed by MIS-C (n=27), PIM-TS (n=14), and other names involving the term ""inflammatory"" (n=12). Google searches for related terms peaked between weeks 18 and 21, following the initial alerts and decreased rapidly thereafter. The number of Reuters articles on the subject was correlated with Google search trends (&#961;: 0.86, 95% CI [0.59; 0.96]; P=0.00016), but the number of medical articles published was not (&#961;: -0.54, 95% CI [-0.87; 0.14]; P=0.11). The first small case series was published less than 2 weeks after the initial alert; however, if all articles had been deposited as preprints when they were submitted to journals, the cumulative number of reported cases would have been 300% higher in week 18 (3 vs 1), 400% higher in week 19 (44 vs 11), 70% higher in week 20 (124 vs 73), and 54% higher in week 21 (129 vs 84). CONCLUSION: In a period of 9 weeks after the initial alerts from European pediatric societies, 85 medical articles were published, involving 856 patients (one case report was published before the alerts), allowing rapid dissemination of research information. However, general public interest followed the news cycle rather than scientific releases. The quality of the reporting, as assessed by adherence to STROBE or CARE guidelines, was adequate with more than two-thirds of checklist items satisfied. Learned societies play an important role in the early dissemination of up-to-date peer-reviewed information. Preprint deposition should be encouraged to accelerate the dissemination of research information.","Morand, A; Urbina, D; Giovannini-Chami, L; Fabre, A",Arch. pediatr,127,16

Most patients experience relief from GERD symptoms following initial repair; however, those suffering from recurrence can have symptoms severe enough to warrant another operation. Although the standard of care is to revise the fundoplication or convert to magnetic sphincter augmentation (MSA) in addition to redo cruroplasty, it stands to reason that with an intact fundoplication, a repeat cruroplasty is all that is necessary to alleviate the patients' symptoms. In other words, only fix that which is broken. METHODS: A retrospective review of patients with symptomatic hiatal hernia recurrence who underwent reoperation between January 2011 and September 2018 was conducted. Patients who received revisional cruroplasty alone were compared with cruroplasty plus some other revision (fundoplication revision, or takedown and MSA placement). Demographics, operative details, and postoperative outcomes were collected. RESULTS: There were 73 patients identified. Median time to recurrence after the first procedure was 3.7 (1.9-8.2) years. Thirty-two percent of the patients had GERD symptoms for more than 10 years. Twenty-six patients underwent cruroplasty only. Forty-seven patients underwent cruroplasty plus fundoplication revision. There were no significant differences in operative times (2.4 h cruroplasty alone, 2.8 h full revision, p = 0.75) or postoperative complications between the two groups. Patients had a mean follow-up time of 1.64 years. Of the 73 patients, 8 had subsequent hiatal hernia recurrence. The recurrence rate for patients with cruroplasty alone was 11%, and the recurrence rate for the full revision group was 12% (p = 1.00). CONCLUSION: Leaving an intact fundoplication alone at the time of revisional surgery did not adversely affect surgical outcomes. This data suggests a role for hernia-only repair for recurrent hiatal hernias.","Nguyen, Robert; Dunn, Colin P; Putnam, Luke; Won, Paul; Patel, Tanu; Brito, Stephanie; Bildzukewicz, Nikolai A; Lipham, John C",Surg. endosc,127,1

A key question is whether the landscape of clinical research has also changed. METHODS: In a retrospective cohort study, we examined the association of the COVID-19 outbreak with new clinical trial activations. Trial data for all interventional and observational oncology, cardiovascular, and mental health studies from January 2015 through September 2020 were obtained from ClinicalTrials.gov . An interrupted time-series analysis with Poisson regression was used. RESULTS: We examined 62,252 trial activations. During the initial COVID-19 outbreak (February 2020 through May 2020), model-estimated monthly trial activations for US-based studies were only 57% of the expected estimate had the pandemic not occurred (relative risk = 0.57, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.61, p < .001). For non-US-based studies, the impact of the pandemic was less dramatic (relative risk = 0.77, 95% CI 0.73 to 0.82, p < .001), resulting in an overall 27% reduction in the relative risk of new trial activations for US-based trials compared to non-US-based trials (relative risk ratio = 0.73, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.81, p < .001). Although a rebound occurred in the initial reopening phase (June 2020 through September 2020), the rebound was weaker for US-based studies compared to non-US-based studies (relative risk ratio = 0.87, 95% CI 0.80 to 0.95, p < .001). CONCLUSIONS: These findings are consistent with the disproportionate burden of COVID-19 diagnoses and deaths during the initial phase of the pandemic in the USA. Reduced activation of cancer clinical trials will likely slow the pace of clinical research and new drug discovery, with long-term negative consequences for cancer patients. An important question is whether the renewed outbreak period of winter 2020/2021 will have a similarly negative impact on the initiation of new clinical research studies for non-COVID-19 diseases.","Unger, Joseph M; Xiao, Hong",Trials,127,1

OBJECTIVES: Evaluate the diagnostic value of cutaneous manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection and investigate their duration and timing in relation to other COVID-19 symptoms METHODS: We used data from 336,847 UK users of the COVID Symptom Study app to assess the diagnostic value of body rash or an acral rash in SARS-CoV-2 infection, and data from an independent online survey of 11,546 respondents to investigate skin-specific symptoms and collect their photographs. RESULTS: Using data from the app, we show significant association between skin rashes and a positive swab test result (OR:1.67, 95% confidence interval:1.41-1.96). Strikingly, among the respondents of the independent online survey, we found that 17% of SARS-CoV-2-positive cases reported skin rashes as the first presentation, and 21% as the only COVID-19 clinical sign. Together with the British Association of Dermatologists, we have compiled a catalogue of images of the most common skin manifestations of COVID-19 from 400 individuals (https://covidskinsigns.com), which we make publicly available to assist clinicians in recognition of this early COVID-19 clinical feature. CONCLUSIONS: Skin rashes cluster with other COVID-19 symptoms, are predictive of a positive swab test, and occur in a significant number of cases, either alone or before other classical symptoms. Recognising rashes is important in identifying new and earlier COVID-19 cases.","Visconti, A; Bataille, V; Rossi, N; Kluk, J; Murphy, R; Puig, S; Nambi, R; Bowyer, R C E; Murray, B; Bournot, A; Wolf, J; Ourselin, S; Steves, C J; Spector, T D; Falchi, M",Br. j. dermatol,127,16

The battle to overcome COVID-19 is not yet over; thus, it is essential that the public practices preventive measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of reading and obtaining information via emergency alert SMS text messages and their effects on the individual's practice of preventive behaviors during the early stages of the COVID-19 outbreak in South Korea. METHODS: A cross-sectional web-based survey comprising 990 participants was conducted over 3 days (March 25-27, 2020). A multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed the sociodemographic factors that might influence the behavior of reading emergency alert text messages. A hierarchical linear regression model estimated the associations between reading emergency alert text messages for each precautionary behavior practiced against COVID-19. Additionally, the indirect effects of reading the text messages on each precautionary behavior via psychological factors (ie, perceived risk and response efficacy) were calculated. All data were weighted according to the 2019 Korea census data. RESULTS: Overall, 49.2% (487/990) of the participants reported that they always read emergency alert text messages and visited the linked website to obtain more information. Factors such as female sex (odds ratio [OR] 1.68, 95% CI 1.28-2.21) and older age (30-39 years: OR 2.02, 95% CI 1.25-3.28; 40-49 years: OR 2.84, 95% CI 1.80-4.47; 50-59 years: OR 3.19, 95% CI 2.01-5.06; 60 years and above: OR 3.12, 95% CI 2.00-4.86 versus 18-29 years) were identified to be associated with a higher frequency of reading the text messages. Participants who always read the text messages practiced wearing facial masks (ß=.074, P=.01) more frequently than those who did not. In terms of social distancing, participants who reported they always read the text messages avoided crowded places (ß=.078, P=.01) and canceled or postponed social gatherings (ß=.103, P<.001) more frequently than those who did not read the text messages. Furthermore, reading text messages directly and indirectly affected practicing precautionary behaviors, as the mediation effect of response efficacy between reading text messages and practicing preventive behaviors was significant. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that emergency alert text messages sent to individuals' mobile phones are timely and effective strategies for encouraging preventive behavior in public. Sending emergency alert text messages to provide the public with accurate and reliable information could be positively considered by the health authorities, which might reduce the negative impact of infodemics.","Lee, Minjung; You, Myoungsoon",J Med Internet Res,127,25

In addition to its anti-viral activity, the anti-inflammatory activity of chloroquine may also contribute to its efficacy. Based on our data obtained from an animal infection model of melioidosis (a disease caused by the bacteria Burkholderia pseudomallei), treatment with chloroquine can result in the phosphorylation and consequent inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase-3ß (GSK3ß). This serine/threonine protein kinase is now recognised as a point of convergence for host inflammatory response. In view of this, it is plausible that the mechanism for the anti-inflammatory effect of chloroquine against COVID-19 involves inhibition of host GSK3ß.","Embi, Mohammed Noor; Ganesan, Nagesswary; Sidek, Hasidah Mohd",Drug Discov Ther,127,16

The current article draws from pertinent literature across topic areas of acute crises and long-term, cumulative risk to illustrate the multitude of ways in which the well-being of children and families may be at risk during COVID-19. The presented conceptual framework is based on systemic models of human development and family functioning and links social disruption due to COVID-19 to child adjustment through a cascading process involving caregiver well-being and family processes (i.e., organization, communication, and beliefs). An illustration of the centrality of family processes in buffering against risk in the context of COVID-19, as well as promoting resilience through shared family beliefs and close relationships, is provided.

OBJECTIVE: To assess whether patients undergoing pharmacological treatment for IMID present higher risk of worse outcomes when diagnosed with COVID-19. DESIGN AND SETTING: Rapid systematic review conducted in the medical school of the Federal University of São Paulo (SP), Brazil. METHODS: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, SCOPUS, Web of Science, L·OVE, ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO-ICTRP for studies evaluating patients diagnosed with COVID-19 who were undergoing pharmacological treatment for IMID. Two authors selected studies, extracted data and assessed risk of bias and certainty of evidence, following the Cochrane recommendations. RESULTS: We identified 1,498 references, from which one cohort study was included. This compared patients with and without rheumatic diseases (RD) who all had been diagnosed with COVID-19. Those with RD seemed to have higher chances of hospitalization and mortality, but no statistical difference was detected between the groups: hospitalization: odds ratio (OR) 1.17; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.6 to 2.29; mortality rate: OR 1.53; 95% CI 0.33 to 7.11 (very low certainty of evidence). Patients with RD were three times more likely to require admission to intensive care units (ICUs), with invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), than those without RD: OR 3.72; 95% CI 1.35 to 10.26 (for both outcomes; very low certainty of evidence). CONCLUSION: Patients undergoing pharmacological treatment for IMID seem to present higher chances of requiring admission to ICUs, with IMV. Additional high-quality studies are needed to analyze the effects of different treatments for IMID.","Rocha, Aline Pereira da; Atallah, Álvaro Nagib; Pinto, Ana Carolina Pereira Nunes; Rocha-Filho, César Ramos; Milby, Keilla Martins; Civile, Vinicius Tassoni; Carvas Junior, Nelson; Reis, Felipe Sebastião de Assis; Ferla, Laura Jantsch; Ramalho, Gabriel Sodré; Trevisani, Giulia Fernandes Moça; Puga, Maria Eduarda dos Santos; Trevisani, Virgínia Fernandes Moça",Säo Paulo med. j,127,24

Our new criterion for""loss aversion-sensitive dominance""defines a weak partial ordering of the distributions of policy-induced gains and losses. It applies to the class of welfare functions which model individual preferences with non-decreasing and loss-averse attitudes towards changes in outcomes. We also develop new statistical methods to test loss aversion-sensitive dominance in practice, using nonparametric plug-in estimates; these allow inference to be conducted through a special resampling procedure. Since point-identification of the distribution of policy-induced gains and losses may require strong assumptions, we extend our comparison criteria, test statistics, and resampling procedures to the partially-identified case.

Since then, it has progressed rapidly and the number of cases grow exponentially each day. In this article, we utilize SEIR modelling to forecast COVID-19 outbreak in Algeria under two scenarios by using the real-time data from March 01 to April 10, 2020. In the first scenario: no control measures are put into place, we estimate that the basic reproduction number for the epidemic in Algeria is 2.1, the number of new cases in Algeria will peak from around late May to early June and up to 82% of the Algerian population will likely contract the coronavirus. In the second scenario, at a certain date T, drastic control measures are taken, people are being advised to self-isolate or to quarantine and will be able to leave their homes only if necessary. We use SEIR model with fast change between fully protected and risky states. We prove that the final size of the epidemic depends strongly on the cumulative number of cases at the date when we implement intervention and on the fraction of the population in confinement.

Damage to healthy tissue in the radiation field can cause undesirable toxic effects leading to gastrointestinal complications called pelvic radiation disease. A change in the composition and/or function of the microbiota could contribute to radiation-induced gastrointestinal toxicity. In this study, we tested the prophylactic effect of a new generation of probiotic like Faecalibacterium prausnitzii (F. prausnitzii) on acute radiation-induced colonic lesions. Experiments were carried out in a preclinical model of pelvic radiation disease. Rats were locally irradiated at 29 Gray in the colon resulting in colonic epithelial barrier rupture. Three days before the irradiation and up to 3 d after the irradiation, the F. prausnitzii A2-165 strain was administered daily (intragastrically) to test its putative protective effects. Results showed that prophylactic F. prausnitzii treatment limits radiation-induced para-cellular hyperpermeability, as well as the infiltration of neutrophils (MPO+ cells) in the colonic mucosa. Moreover, F. prausnitzii treatment reduced the severity of the morphological change of crypts, but also preserved the pool of Sox-9+ stem/progenitor cells, the proliferating epithelial PCNA+ crypt cells and the Dclk1+/IL-25+ differentiated epithelial tuft cells. The benefit of F. prausnitzii was associated with increased production of IL-18 by colonic crypt epithelial cells. Thus, F. prausnitzii treatment protected the epithelial colonic barrier from colorectal irradiation. New-generation probiotics may be promising prophylactic treatments to reduce acute side effects in patients treated with radiation therapy and may improve their quality of life.","Lapiere, Alexia; Geiger, Mallia; Robert, Véronique; Demarquay, Christelle; Auger, Sandrine; Chadi, Sead; Benadjaoud, Mohamedamine; Fernandes, Gabriel; Milliat, Fabien; Langella, Philippe; Benderitter, Marc; Chatel, Jean-Marc; Sémont, Alexandra",Gut Microbes,127,16

We analyzed public data from the first 50 days of the epidemic in Italy (from February 24 to April 13, 2020) to evaluate whether evolving testing strategies and capacity could account for trends in the CFR. The CFR increased during the study period, and a significant positive correlation was found between the CFR and the percentage of positive tests among performed real-time PCR tests (positive tests % [POS%]) until March 25, suggesting the surveillance system did not detect a growing number of cases in the initial phase of the epidemic. To avoid distortion due to the delay between the identification of cases and deaths, the expected CFR (expCFR) was calculated, which represents the ratio between the predicted number of cases and deaths at the end of the epidemic based on the best fitting logistic curves of the cumulative numbers of cases and deaths. The expCFR began a downward trend from the 40th day. In the final phase, a decrease in both expCFR and POS% was identified, suggesting an improvement in surveillance. The results of this study suggest data from the first 50 days of the COVID-19 epidemic in Italy were severely affected by ascertainment bias.

The purpose of this article is to provide an evidence-based overview of the adverse mental health impacts on healthcare workers during times of crisis and other challenging working conditions and to highlight the importance of prioritizing and protecting the mental health and well-being of the healthcare workforce, particularly in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. First, we provide a broad overview of the elevated risk of stress, burnout, moral injury, depression, trauma, and other mental health challenges among healthcare workers. Second, we consider how public health emergencies exacerbate these concerns, as reflected in emerging research on the negative mental health impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on healthcare workers. Further, we consider potential approaches for overcoming these threats to mental health by exploring the value of practicing self-care strategies, and implementing evidence based interventions and organizational measures to help protect and support the mental health and well-being of the healthcare workforce. Lastly, we highlight systemic changes to empower healthcare workers and protect their mental health and well-being in the long run, and propose policy recommendations to guide healthcare leaders and health systems in this endeavor.

However, there are a few material science studies that characterize the charge distribution and physical changes accompanying disinfection treatments, particularly heating. Here, we report the filtration efficiency, dipole charge density, and fiber integrity of N95 and KN95 respirators before and after various decontamination methods. We found that the filter layers in N95 and KN95 respirators maintained their fiber integrity without any deformations during disinfection. The filter layers of N95 respirators were 8-fold thicker and had 2-fold higher dipole charge density than that of KN95 respirators. Emergency Use Authorization (EUA)-approved KN95 respirators showed filtration efficiencies as high as N95 respirators. Interestingly, although there was a significant drop in the dipole charge in both respirators during decontamination, there was no remarkable decrease in the filtration efficiencies due to mechanical filtration. Cotton and polyester face masks had a lower filtration efficiency and lower dipole charge. In conclusion, a loss of electrostatic charge does not directly correlate to the decreased performance of either respirator.","Yim, Wonjun; Cheng, Diyi; Patel, Shiv H; Kou, Rui; Meng, Ying Shirley; Jokerst, Jesse V",ACS Appl Mater Interfaces,127,22

The inquiries concern what this tells us about education as framed and constrained as a part of society. Our observations are based on statements presented by the government and public agencies, mass media and websites. We identified an assemblage of interwoven agents such as institutions, laws, regulations and recommendations, pandemic manuals, statistics and media. All these were brought together by actions and ideas to handle a pandemic when there were no preventive vaccines. The overarching principle was to educate the population to competent actions in dealing with the pandemic. To keep schools open was part of that principle combined with caretaking ambitions. This assemblage looked like a centralistic machine but it was not; risks were pushed back to local authorities and schools.

STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Charts of consecutive patients suspected of having COVID-19 at five EDs in New York City between March 19, 2020, and April 23, 2020, were reviewed. Patients were categorized based on absence of findings on initial CXR. The primary outcomes were hospital admission, mechanical ventilation, ARDS, and mortality. RESULTS: Three thousand two hundred forty-five adult patients, 474 (14.6%) with negative initial CXR results, were reviewed. Among all patients, negative initial CXR results were associated with a low probability of future adverse clinical outcomes, with negative likelihood ratios of 0.27 (95% CI, 0.23-0.31) for hospital admission, 0.24 (95% CI, 0.16-0.37) for mechanical ventilation, 0.19 (95% CI, 0.09-0.40) for ARDS, and 0.38 (95% CI, 0.29-0.51) for mortality. Among the subset of 955 patients younger than 65 years and with a duration of symptoms of at least 5 days, no patients with negative CXR results died, and the negative likelihood ratios were 0.17 (95% CI, 0.12-0.25) for hospital admission, 0.09 (95% CI, 0.02-0.36) for mechanical ventilation, and 0.09 (95% CI, 0.01-0.64) for ARDS. INTERPRETATION: Initial CXR in adult patients suspected of having COVID-19 is a strong exclusionary test for hospital admission, mechanical ventilation, ARDS, and mortality. The value of CXR as an exclusionary test for adverse clinical outcomes is highest among young adults, patients with few comorbidities, and those with a prolonged duration of symptoms.","Pagano, Andrew; Finkelstein, Mark; Overbey, Jessica; Steinberger, Sharon; Ellison, Trevor; Manna, Sayan; Toussie, Danielle; Cedillo, Mario A; Jacobi, Adam; Gupta, Yogesh S; Bernheim, Adam; Chung, Michael; Eber, Corey; Fayad, Zahi A; Concepcion, Jose",Chest,127,20

As of 13 January 2021, the numbers of deaths and cases caused by COVID-19 in LAC reported are 552,000 and 17'485,000 respectively. LAC concentrates the largest percentage of indigenous populations throughout the world. In this region, poverty is persistent and particularly rural indigenous peoples hold the steepest barriers to health services and experience profound discrimination based on ethnicity, poverty, and language, compared to their non-indigenous counterparts. The information regarding the health of indigenous populations, in general, is scarce, and this problem is aggravated in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, the main objective of this work is to address the overall scenario of indigenous peoples in the Latin American and Caribbean region from March 2020 to January 2021, in this manner gathering information regarding health problems, economic, social, cultural and environmental factors that make indigenous populations in LAC particularly vulnerable to serious health effects from the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as compiling the mitigation strategies implemented in indigenous communities.","Flores-Ramírez, Rogelio; Berumen-Rodríguez, Alejandra Abigail; Martínez-Castillo, Marco Antonio; Alcántara-Quintana, Luz Eugenia; Díaz-Barriga, Fernando; Díaz de León-Martínez, Lorena",Glob Public Health,127,17

Assisted living (AL) is a type of long-term care setting for older adults who need supportive care but not ongoing nursing care and emphasizes a social model of care provision. Because AL is a type of long-term care, it has at times been referenced along with nursing homes in discussions related to COVID-19 but not recognized for its different care practices that pose unique challenges related to COVID-19; in that manner, it has largely been left out of the COVID-19 discourse, although ~812,000 older adults live in AL. To identify COVID-19 issues specific to AL, stakeholders with expertise in AL operations, policy, practice, and research (n = 42) were recruited to participate in remote interviews between July and September 2020. Using a thematic analysis, we derived the following overarching themes: (1) Policymakers are disconnected from and lack an understanding of the AL context; (2) AL administrators were left to coordinate, communicate, and implement constantly changing guidelines with little support; (3) AL organizations faced limited knowledge of and disparate access to funding and resources; (4) state-level regulatory requirements conflicted with COVID-19 guidelines resulting in uncertainty about which rules to follow; and (5) AL operators struggled to balance public health priorities with promoting their residents' quality of life and well-being. To develop evidence-informed policy and avoid unintended consequences, AL operators, direct care workers, residents, and clinicians practicing in these settings should have opportunities to provide feedback throughout the policy development process, both state and national.","Dys, Sarah; Winfree, Jaclyn; Carder, Paula; Zimmerman, Sheryl; Thomas, Kali S",Front Public Health,127,16

Prone positioning improves mortality in moderate-to-severe ARDS. Strategies to increase prone positioning under crisis conditions are needed. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We describe the development of a mobile prone team during the height of the crisis in New York City and describe characteristics and outcomes of mechanically ventilated patients who received prone positioning between April 2, 2020 and April 30, 2020. RESULTS: Ninety patients underwent prone positioning for moderate-to-severe ARDS. Sixty-six patients (73.3%) were men, with a median age of 64 years (IQR 53-71), and the median PaO2:FiO2 ratio was 107 (IQR 85-140) prior to prone positioning. Patients required an average of 3 ± 2.2 prone sessions and the median time of each prone session was 19 h (IQR 17.5-20.75). By the end of the study period, proning was discontinued in sixty-seven (65.1%) cases due to clinical improvement, twenty (19.4%) cases due to lack of clinical improvement, six (5.8%) cases for clinical worsening, and ten (9.7%) cases due to a contraindication. CONCLUSION: The rapid development of a mobile prone team safely provided prone positioning to a large number of COVID-19 patients with moderate-to-severe ARDS.","Short, Briana; Parekh, Madhavi; Ryan, Patrick; Chiu, Maggie; Fine, Cynthia; Scala, Peter; Moses, Shirah; Jackson, Emily; Brodie, Daniel; Yip, Natalie H",J Crit Care,127,32

Conversely, vitamin D supplementation protects against an initial alveolar diffuse damage of COVID-19 becoming progressively worse. The mechanisms by which vitamin D deficiency exacerbates COVID-19 pneumonia remain poorly understood. In this review we describe the rationale of the putative role of endothelial dysfunction in this event. Herein, we will briefly review (1) anti-inflammatory and anti-thrombotic effects of vitamin D, (2) vitamin D receptor and vitamin D receptor ligand, (3) protective role of vitamin D against endothelial dysfunction, (4) risk of vitamin D deficiency, (5) vitamin D deficiency in association with endothelial dysfunction, (6) the characteristics of vitamin D relevant to COVID-19, (7) the role of vitamin D on innate and adaptive response, (8) biomarkers of endothelial cell activation contributing to cytokine storm, and (9) the bidirectional relationship between inflammation and homeostasis. Finally, we hypothesize that endothelial dysfunction relevant to vitamin D deficiency results from decreased binding of the vitamin D receptor with its ligand on the vascular endothelium and that it may be immune-mediated via increased interferon 1 &#945;. A possible sequence of events may be described as (1) angiotensin II converting enzyme-related initial endothelial injury followed by vitamin D receptor-related endothelial dysfunction, (2) endothelial lesions deteriorating to endothelialitis, coagulopathy and thrombosis, and (3) vascular damage exacerbating pulmonary pathology and making patients with vitamin D deficiency vulnerable to death.","Zhang, Jun; McCullough, Peter A; Tecson, Kristen M",Rev Cardiovasc Med,127,21

It was first detected in the Wuhan city of China and has spread globally resulting in a substantial health and economic crisis in many countries. Observational studies have partially identified different aspects of this disease. There have been no published systematic reviews that combine clinical, laboratory, epidemiologic, and mortality findings. Also, the effect of gender on the outcomes of COVID-19 has not been well-defined. Methods: We reviewed the scientific literature published from January 1, 2019 to May 29, 2020. Statistical analyses were performed with STATA (version 14, IC; Stata Corporation, College Station, TX, USA). The pooled frequency with 95% confidence intervals (CI) was assessed using random effect model. P &lt; 0.05 was considered a statistically significant publication bias. Results: Out of 1,223 studies, 34 satisfied the inclusion criteria. A total of 5,057 patients with a mean age of 49 years were evaluated. Fever (83.0%, CI 77.5–87.6) and cough (65.2%, CI 58.6–71.2) were the most common symptoms. The most prevalent comorbidities were hypertension (18.5%, CI 12.7–24.4) and Cardiovascular disease (14.9%, CI 6.0–23.8). Among the laboratory abnormalities, elevated C-Reactive Protein (CRP) (72.0%, CI 54.3–84.6) and lymphopenia (50.1%, CI 38.0–62.4) were the most common. Bilateral ground-glass opacities (66.0%, CI 51.1–78.0) was the most common CT scan presentation. The pooled mortality rate was 6.6%, with males having significantly higher mortality compared to females (OR 3.4; 95% CI 1.2–9.1, P = 0.01). Conclusion: COVID-19 has caused a significant number of hospitalization and mortality worldwide. Mortality associated with COVID-19 was higher in our study compared to the previous reports from China. The mortality was significantly higher among the hospitalized male group. Further studies are required to evaluate the effect of different variables resulting in sex disparity in COVID-19 mortality.","Nasiri, Mohammad Javad; Haddadi, Sara; Tahvildari, Azin; Farsi, Yeganeh; Arbabi, Mahta; Hasanzadeh, Saba; Jamshidi, Parnian; Murthi, Mukunthan; Mirsaeidi, Mehdi",Front.

Methods: Fifteen fresh goat heads (weighing 2.5-3.0 kg) were purchased from the market. They were all ordinary goats (9-12 months old, body weighing 18-21 kg) regardless of gender. Bilateral articular discs (a total of 30) were dissected within 30 minutes after execution. According to the national standard for mechanical testing of viscoelastic materials, fresh TMJ disc specimens of goat were prepared and tests were carried out in physiological conditions. The universal mechanical testing machine was utilized to test biomechanical properties of TMJ discs. Results: The compressive modulus of TMJ discs was (8.41±2.12) MPa and the tensile modulus was (9.54±3.26) MPa. The mechanical characteristics would be irreversibly altered once the load exceeded the physiological range. In addition, it underwent apparent creep relaxation under continuous strain (0.5 MPa or 3.0 MPa) and the surface friction coefficient of the TMJ discs (0.015+0.011) was much lower than that of general viscoelastic materials. Conclusions: The TMJ disc was a bio-viscoelastic structure with excellent tensile and compressive properties and its surface was extremely smooth in wet conditions.","Jiang, N; Yang, Y T; Bi, R Y; Cao, P Y; Hou, Y; Zhu, S S",Zhonghua Kou Qiang Yi Xue Za Zhi,127,16

We assessed mental health in response to the lockdown in Germany between 1 April 2020 and 15 April 2020 using a cross-sectional online survey (n = 3545) with a mixed-methods approach. We found increased levels of psychosocial distress (Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) stress module), anxiety, depressive symptoms (PHQ-4), irritability, and a decrease in overall well-being (WHO-Five Well-Being Index (WHO-5)), sense of coherence (Short Form of the Sense of Coherence Scale (SOC-L9)), sexual contentment, and sleep quality.

Participants reported finding comfort in family, friends, conversation, exercise, and activity. Findings are also in line with research showing that women seem to have more trouble coping with the pandemic and lockdown measures. Our observations demonstrate that the COVID-19 pandemic and related measures lead to a mental health burden even in a highly developed Western country and should, therefore, be taken seriously.

We measured Bragg reflections from the chiral SmC* phase of the antiferroelectric liquid crystal (AFLC), AS612, and explored how applied electric fields and polymer networks modify these reflections. From the critical field that unwinds the helix and destroys Bragg reflections, the twist elastic constant of the SmC* phase is determined. We estimate from this result, the elastic constant of polymer network, which when introduced into the liquid crystal matrix, fixes the helical pitch (and hence, Bragg peaks). These parameters are crucial for designing both FLC and AFLC displays since networks enhance the mechanical properties of the liquid crystal host while not affecting their optical properties.","Singh, Upindranath",Eur Phys J E Soft Matter,127,16

Federated $f$-differential privacy operates on record level: it provides the privacy guarantee on each individual record of one client's data against adversaries. We then propose a generic private federated learning framework {PriFedSync} that accommodates a large family of state-of-the-art FL algorithms, which provably achieves federated $f$-differential privacy.

There is lack of definitive evidence confirming or declining mother to child COVID 19 transmission. This article is an update on this challenging issue. Evidence Acquisition: This article is a comprehensive search in scientific major database from 1 January 2020 up to 25 April 2020 with the key words of “COVID 19” and “vertical transmission” or “neonatal”. Two researchers reviewed all selected articles to extract data about neonatal COVID 19 and vertical transmission. Those reports that provided the results of PCR on fetus or neonate blood, amniotic fluid or pharyngeal secretion samples or elevated COVID 19 specific IgM were included. Those reports based on clinical COVID 19 characteristics or radiological findings were not included in data extraction. Thirty six articles have been reviewed and evidence supporting or against COVID 19 Vertical transmission have been extracted and discussed. Results: Most previous studies on vertical COVID 19 transmission have been tested placenta, amniotic fluid, cord blood and newborn blood or pharyngeal swab sample using quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) that may show false negative results due to suboptimal sampling or inefficient viral load. Increased COVID 19 specific IgG/IgM antibodies have been reported in newborns from COVID 19 mothers; however, data is limited and longitudinal follow up is needed. Evidence supporting COVID 19 vertical transmission: Recent reports indicated that pharyngeal PCR test turned positive in first few hours of life in several neonates. Also increased level of COVID 19 specific IgM and IgG antibodies in newborns to COVID 19 positive mothers were observed. Rate of perinatal complications were higher among newborns of COVID 19 mothers. Evidence against COVID 19 vertical transmis-sion: All tissue or blood specimens and pharyngeal swab qRT-PCR tests among neonates born from COVID 19 mothers were negative. Rate of cross reactivity and false positive results are high in serologic studies.

Patients with cardiovascular risk factors or established cardiovascular disease are more likely to experience severe or critical COVID-19 illness and myocardial injury is a key extra-pulmonary manifestation. These patients frequently present with ST-elevation on an electrocardiogram (ECG) due to multiple etiologies including obstructive, non-obstructive, and/or angiographically normal coronary arteries. The incidence of ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) mimics in COVID-19-positive hospitalized patients, and the association with morbidity and mortality is unknown. Understanding the natural history and appropriate management of COVID-19 patients presenting with ST elevation is essential to inform patient management decisions and protect healthcare workers. Methods: The Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions (SCAI) and The Canadian Association of Interventional Cardiology (CAIC) in conjunction with the American College of Cardiology Interventional Council have collaborated to create a multi-center observational registry, NACMI. This registry will enroll confirmed COVID-19 patients and persons under investigation (PUI) with new ST-segment elevation or new onset left bundle branch block (LBBB) on the ECG with clinical suspicion of myocardial ischemia. We will compare demographics, clinical findings, outcomes and management of these patients with a historical control group of over 15,000 consecutive STEMI activation patients from the Midwest STEMI Consortium using propensity matching. The primary clinical outcome will be in- hospital major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) defined as composite of all-cause mortality, stroke, recurrent MI, and repeat unplanned revascularization in COVID-19 confirmed or PUI. Secondary outcomes will include the following: reporting of etiologies of ST Elevation; cardiovascular mortality due to myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest and /or shock; individual components of the primary outcome; composite primary outcome at 1 year; as well as ECG and angiographic characteristics. Conclusion: The multicenter NACMI registry will collect data regarding ST elevation on ECG in COVID-19 patients to determine the etiology and associated clinical outcomes.

A set of online questionnaires was employed to measure mental health and responses. 1,397 participants from Wuhan (age: 36.4 ± 10.7; male: 36.1%) and 2,794 age- and sex-matched participants from other areas of China (age: 35.9 ± 9.9; male: 39.0%) were recruited. RESULTS: Compared with their counterparts, participants from Wuhan had significantly higher prevalence of any mental health problems (46.6% vs. 32.2%; adjusted OR=1.89, 95%CI=1.65-2.17), anxiety (15.2% vs. 6.2%; adjusted OR=2.65, 95%CI=2.14-3.29), depression (18.3% vs. 9.7%; adjusted OR = 2.11, 95%CI=1.74-2.54), suicidal ideation (10.5% vs. 7.1%; adjusted OR=1.60, 95%CI=1.28-2.02), and insomnia (38.6% vs. 27.6%; adjusted OR=1.70, 95%CI=1.48-1.96). Participants from Wuhan had a slightly higher rate of help-seeking behavior (7.1% vs. 4.2%, adjusted OR=1.76, 95% CI=1.12-2.77) but similar rate of treatment (3.5% vs. 2.7%, adjusted OR = 1.23, 95% CI=0.68-2.24) for mental problems than their counterparts. In addition, compared with their counterparts, participants from Wuhan gave higher proportions of responses regarding ""fearful"" (52% vs. 36%, P < .001), ""discrimination against COVID-19 cases"" (64% vs. 58%, P = .006), ""strictly comply with preventive behaviors"" (98.7% vs. 96%, P =.003), and ""fewer living and medical supplies"" (<2 weeks: 62% vs. 57%, P = .015).

Our study investigated the characteristics of ingestion and inhalation allergy among children from Sichuan province in Southwest China, so as to get public awareness of these disorders.A total of 1722 children between 0 and 14 years' old were enrolled in this study. They were outpatients in the West China Second University Hospital during June 2019 to September 2019. Serum specific IgE specific to 10 types of food allergen and 10 types of aeroallergen were estimated. Nutrition indicators were tested by electrochemical luminescence.59.70% children were allergic to at least 1 allergen, comprising 24.90% to aeroallergen and 38.81% to food allergen, respectively, whereas 36.28% children were allergic to both aeroallergen and food allergen. Milk was the most common food allergen, and egg came in second place. With regard to aeroallergen, house dust mite held the maximum proportion (65.02%), whereas dust mite followed behind. Inhalation allergy was more commonly seen in boys than girls. Bronchitis was the most common symptom of both allergies. In addition, the highest incidence age for children to be sensitive to food allergen and aeroallergen were 0â¼2 years' old and 3â¼5 years' old, respectively. It is worth mentioning that there was no significant difference in nutritional status between children with or without allergic diseases.Our findings reveal that milk, egg, house dust mite, and dust mite are the most common allergens among children in Sichuan province. Boys are more susceptible to aeroallergen than girls. Furthermore, the prevalence of ingestion and inhalation allergy varies from different age groups, and has no correlation with nutritional status.

The prevalence of diabetes mellitus, which is a great public health issue leading to immunity inhibition and anincreased incidenceofinfections, has been increasing over the past ten years. The aim of this research was to systematically assess the prevalence of diabetes mellitus among 2019-nCoV. METHODS: We searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science and Medline for observational studies up to February 25, 2020. A random effects model or fixed-effects model was applied to evaluate the pooled prevalence of diabetes mellitus and odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). FINDINGS: In total, nine papers met the eligibility criteria. The pooled prevalence of DM was 9% (95% CI 6%-12%). There was obvious heterogeneity (I2 65%, p = 0.004) in the prevalence of DM in these studies. The prevalence of DM in moderate patients with 2019-nCoV was 7% (95% CI 4%-10%). The prevalence of DM in severe patients with 2019-nCoV was 17% (95% CI 13%-21%). The prevalence of DM in severe patients with 2019-nCoV was significantly higher than that in moderate patients with 2019-nCoV (OR 2.49, 95% CI 1.70 to 3.64). INTERPRETATION: To our knowledge, this work is the first report showing the prevalence of diabetes mellitus in patients with 2019-nCoV, which is beneficial to prevent the spread of 2019-nCoV in the future.","Wang, Xiang; Wang, Shoujun; Sun, Liangge; Qin, Guijun",Diabetes Res Clin Pract,127,6

The songs were played in chronological (Experiments 1 and 2a) or in random order (Experiment 2b). Participants' task was to type the target sentence they had heard. In all experiments, speech intelligibility was better in nonlyrical (karaoke) than lyrical music (English and Simlish). In addition, listeners performed better in lyrics without semantic meaning (Simlish) than with semantic meaning (English). Finally, speech intelligibility was better when the song in the background was played in chronological rather than in random order. These findings aid in understanding the mechanisms involved during speech-in-music intelligibility.

Recently, a practice-based instrument addressing biopsychosocial aspects of functioning, the Social Medical Work Capacity instrument (SMWC), was developed. Our aim was to examine the content validity of the SMWC using ICF core sets. METHODS: First, we conducted a systematic search to identify relevant ICF core sets for the working age population. Second the content of these core sets were mapped to assess the relevance and comprehensiveness of the SMWC. Next, we compared the content of the SMWC with the ICF-core sets. RESULTS: Two work-related core sets and 31 disease-specific core sets were identified. The SMWC and the two work-related core sets overlap on 47 categories. Compared to the work-related core sets, the Body Functions and Activities and Participation are well represented in the new instrument, while the component Environmental factors is under-represented. Compared to the disease-specific core sets, items related to the social and domestic environmental factors are under-represented, while the SMWC included work-related factors complementary to the ICF. CONCLUSION: The SMWC content seems relevant, but could be more comprehensive for the purpose of individual work capacity assessments. To improve assessing relevant biopsychosocial aspects, it is recommended to extend the instrument by adding personal and environmental (work- and social-related) factors as well as a more tailored use of the SMWC for assessing work capacity of persons with specific diseases or underlying illness.","Sengers, Johan H; Abma, Femke I; Wilming, Loes; Roelofs, Pepijn D D M; Heerkens, Yvonne F; Brouwer, Sandra",J. occup. rehabil,127,32

In the host cell, the virus largely depends on the main protease (Mpro ) to regulate infection hence it is one of the most attractive targets for inhibitor design. However, >19,000 mutations in the Mpro have already been reported. The mutations encompassing 282 amino acid positions and these ""hotspots"" might change the Mpro structure, activity and potentially delay therapeutic strategies targeting Mpro . Thus, here we identified 24 mutational ""coldspots"" where mutations have not been observed. We compared the structure-function relationship of these coldspots with several SARS-CoV2 Mpro X-ray crystal structures. We found that three coldspot residues (Leu141, Phe185, and Gln192) help to form the active site, while seven (Gly2, Arg4, Tyr126, Lys137, Leu141, Leu286, and Leu287) contribute to dimer formation that is required for Mpro activity. The surface of the dimer interface is more resistant to mutations compared to the active site. Interestingly, most of the coldspots are found in three clusters and forms conserved patterns when compared with other coronaviruses. Importantly, several conserved coldspots are available on the surface of the active site and at the dimer interface for targeting. The identification and short list of these coldspots offers a new perspective to target the SARS-CoV2 Mpro while avoiding mutation-based drug resistance.","Krishnamoorthy, Navaneethakrishnan; Fakhro, Khalid",IUBMB Life,127,24

Ophthalmologists are at high risk of acquiring and transmitting the virus. Telemedicine platforms have evolved and may play an important role in attenuating this risk. For patients, these platforms provide the possibility of clinic consultation without the concerns of a clinic visit. We aimed to assess the utilization of telemedicine by oculoplastics specialists worldwide during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A 13-item survey was distributed internationally to practicing oculoplastic surgeons. Collected data included demographics, clinical practice variables and perceptions regarding telemedicine. Significance of associations and single survey items was evaluated by Chi-squared and z-score of proportions tests, respectively. RESULTS: The questionnaire was completed by 70 oculoplastic surgeons (54.3% male, mean age 47.3 years, median experience 10 years) from eight countries, practicing in various clinical settings (50.0% hospitals, 45.7% private clinics, 4.3% community clinics). Most respondents reported telemedicine to be an effective tool for oculoplastic consultations (67.1%, p = 0.004), while only 12.8% (p < 0.00001) had incorporated this modality into clinical practice prior to the pandemic. Even though a vast majority (98.6%) of participants had limited outpatient activity, most (55.7%) felt unprotected from the virus. Telemedicine had been incorporated by 70.5% (p = 0.001) of respondents during the COVID-19 pandemic, whereas most (57.1%) predicted continued use of the modality. CONCLUSION: Telemedicine can be effectively and rapidly incorporated into the clinical practice of oculoplastic surgeons during the COVID-19 pandemic. Further research into the most effective utilization of these platforms appears warranted.","Assayag, Elishai; Tsessler, Maria; Wasser, Lauren M; Drabkin, Elena; Reich, Ehud; Weill, Yishay; Zadok, David; Nair, Akshay Gopinathan; Andron, Aleza",Eur J Ophthalmol,127,20

We explored whether extracellular nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (eNAMPT), a ligand for Toll-like receptor 4 and a master regulator of innate immunity and inflammation, is a potential ARDS therapeutic target. METHODS: Wild type C57BL/6J or endothelial cell (EC)-cNAMPT -/- knockout mice (targeted EC NAMPT deletion) were exposed to either a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced (""one-hit"") or a combined LPS/ventilator (""two-hit"")-induced acute inflammatory lung injury model. A NAMPT-specific mAb imaging probe (99mTc-ProNamptorTM) was used to detect NAMPT expression in lung tissues. Either an eNAMPT-neutralising goat polyclonal antibody (pAb) or a humanised monoclonal antibody (ALT-100â mAb) were utilised in vitro and in vivo. RESULTS: Immunohistochemical, biochemical, and imaging studies validated time-dependent increases in NAMPT lung tissue expression in both preclinical ARDS models. Intravenous delivery of either eNAMPT-neutralising pAb/mAb significantly attenuated inflammatory lung injury (H & E staining, BAL protein, BAL PMNs, plasma IL-6) in both preclinical models. In vitro human lung EC studies demonstrated eNAMPT-neutralising antibodies (pAb, mAb) to strongly abrogate eNAMPT-induced TLR4 pathway activation and EC barrier disruption. In vivo studies in wild type and EC-cNAMPT -/- mice confirmed a highly significant contribution of EC-derived NAMPT to the severity of inflammatory lung injury in both preclinical ARDS models. CONCLUSIONS: These findings highlight both the role of EC-derived eNAMPT and the potential for biologic targeting of the eNAMPT/TLR4 inflammatory pathway. In combination with predictive eNAMPT biomarker and NAMPT genotyping assays, this offers the opportunity to identify high-risk ARDS subjects for delivery of personalised medicine.","Quijada, Hector; Bermudez, Tadeo; Kempf, Carrie L; Valera, Daniel G; Garcia, Alexander N; Camp, Sara M; Song, Jin H; Franco, Evelyn; Burt, Jessica K; Sun, Belinda; Mascarenhas, Joseph B; Burns, Kimberlie; Gaber, Amir; Oita, Radu C; Reyes Hernon, Vivian; Barber, Christy; Moreno-Vinasco, Liliana; Sun, Xiaoguang; Cress, Anne E; Martin, Diego; Liu, Zhonglin; Desai, Ankit A; Natarajan, Viswanathan; Jacobson, Jeffrey R; Dudek, Steven M; Bime, Christian; Sammani, Saad; Garcia, Joe G N",Eur. respir. j,127,24

METHODS: Here, we assessed the association between white blood cell profile (lymphocytes, basophils, eosinophils, neutrophils, monocytes and total white blood cells) as markers of chronic inflammation, habitual diet and gut microbiome composition (determined by sequencing of the 16S RNA) in 986 healthy individuals from the PREDICT-1 nutritional intervention study. We then investigated whether the gut microbiome mediates part of the benefits of vegetable intake on lymphocyte counts. RESULTS: Higher levels of white blood cells, lymphocytes and basophils were all significantly correlated with lower habitual intake of vegetables, with vegetable intake explaining between 3.59 and 6.58% of variation in white blood cells after adjusting for covariates and multiple testing using false discovery rate (q < 0.1). No such association was seen with fruit intake. A mediation analysis found that 20.00% of the effect of vegetable intake on lymphocyte counts was mediated by one bacterial genus, Collinsella, known to increase with the intake of processed foods and previously associated with fatty liver disease. We further correlated white blood cells to other inflammatory markers including IL6 and GlycA, fasting and post-prandial glucose levels and found a significant relationship between inflammation and diet. CONCLUSION: A habitual diet high in vegetables, but not fruits, is linked to a lower inflammatory profile for white blood cells, and a fifth of the effect is mediated by the genus Collinsella.

The connectivity context was emphasized that possibly had inflicted the outbreak. Using the modes of transmission data for the available cases, the diffusion of this disease was explained. Metropolitans contributed three-fourths of total cases from the beginning. The transport networks attributed significantly in transmitting the virus from the urban containment zones. Later, there was a gradual shift of infections from urban to rural areas; however, the numbers kept increasing in the former. The massive reverse migration after lockdown spiked the infected cases further. Districts with airports reported more with influx of international passengers. A profound east-west division in April with higher infections in the southern and western districts existed. By mid-May eastern India saw a steep rise in active cases. Moran's I analysis showed a low autocorrelation initially which increased over time. Hotspot clustering was observed in western Maharashtra, eastern Tamil Nadu, Gujarat and around Kolkata by the second week of August. The diffusion was due to travel, exposure to infected individuals and among the frontline workers. Spatial regression models confirmed that urbanization was positively correlated with higher incidences of infections. Transit mediums, especially rail and aviation were positively associated.

We investigated the immunogenicity of Ad26.COV2.S and mRNA vaccines in 33 subjects vaccinated with either vaccine class five months earlier on average. After controlling for time since vaccination, Spike-binding antibody and neutralizing antibody levels were higher in the mRNA-vaccinated subjects, while no significant differences in antigen-specific B cell and T cell responses were observed between the two groups. Thus, a dichotomy exists between humoral and cellular responses elicited by the two vaccine classes. Our results have implications for the need of booster doses in vaccinated subjects and might explain the dichotomy reported between the waning protection from symptomatic infection by SARS-CoV-2 vaccination and its persisting efficacy in preventing hospitalization and death.","Ukey, Rahul; Bruiners, Natalie; Mishra, Hridesh; Mishra, Pankaj K; McCluskey, Deborah; Onyuka, Alberta; Chen, Fei; Pinter, Abraham; Weiskopf, Daniela; Sette, Alessandro; Roy, Jason; Gaur, Sunanda; Gennaro, Maria Laura",,127,24

Thus, this study has been designed to evaluate the efficacy of an organosulfur-derived capsule in the management of COVID-19 patients. Material and Methods: 756 patients with COVID-19 infection were enrolled for this randomized case-control study in a hospital in northern Iran, which were randomly divided into placebo and organosulfur group. From 22 September 2020 to 19 March 2021, the organosulfur group was given an organosulfur-derived capsule (90 mg/kg) three times a day (every eight hours) for 14 days. Placebo capsules were given to the placebo group on the same regiment. 720 patients completed the treatment (n=360 in each group). Clinical symptoms, vital signs, and laboratory tests were evaluated both before and after the treatment. Result: A significant difference was found in the prevalence of cough (p-value=0.015), dyspnoea (p-value=0.014), and myalgia (p-value=0.001) along with O2-saturation (p-value=0.023), platelet (pvalue=0.023) and CRP (p-value&lt;0.001) levels between placebo and organosulfur groups. Other symptoms haven't shown a statistically significant difference. Conclusion: The present study showed that supplementary treatment of COVID-19 patients with organosulfur compounds can remarkably improve the clinical symptoms and O2-saturation along with platelet and CRP levels.","Niktale, H.; Shokri, S.; Nosrati, A.; Ghasemi, M.; Houshmand, M.; Mansori, I.; Niktale, R.",Medical Science,127,15

To guide training and exercises, we performed a training needs assessment on infectious disease management among professionals at European POE. METHODS: We disseminated a digital questionnaire to representatives of designated airports, ports, and ground-crossings in Europe. Topics were derived from the IHR core capacities for POEs. Based on the importance (4-point Likert scale) and training needs (4-point Likert scale), we identified the topics with the highest priority for training. These results were put in further perspective using prior experience (training < 3 year, exercise < 5 years, events < 5 years). Also, preferences for training methodologies were assessed. RESULTS: Fifty questionnaires were included in the analyses, representing 50 POEs from 19 European countries. Importance is high for 26/30 topics, although scores widely vary among respondents. Topics with a high training need (16/30) are amongst others the handling of ill travelers; using and composing the public health emergency contingency plan, and public health measures. Respondents from ports and airports attribute equal importance to most topics, but respondents from ports showed higher training needs on 75% of the topics. POEs are unevenly and generally little experienced. The most preferred training methods were presentations. Simulation is the preferred methodology for training the handling of ill or exposed travelers. CONCLUSIONS: The European workforce at designated ports, airports and ground-crossings has a different level of experience and perceives varying importance of the topics assessed in our study. We identified the topics on which training is required. We call for European collaboration between POEs to agree upon the importance of infectious disease management, and to jointly build a trained and prepared workforce that is ready to face the next crisis.","de Rooij, Doret; Belfroid, Evelien; Hadjichristodoulou, Christos; Mouchtouri, Varvara A; Raab, Jörg; Timen, Aura",BMC Public Health,127,32

Patients with cardiovascular comorbidities seem to be more prone to develop higher acuity of the infection, and myocardial injury has been reported amongst them in up to 15% of those hospitalized and up to 30% of ICU-admitted ones. The symptoms of over ischemia/heart failure may be challenging to distinguish as dyspnoea and chest discomfort overlap with those due to COVID-19. Therefore, beside close monitoring with ECG, biomarkes and, in case of demonstrated cardiac involvement, echocardiography, strategies to improve myocardial oxygen delivery should be promptly applied. The cytokine release with complement and iNO dysregulation are established mechanisms potentially leading to sepsis-related cardiomyopathy, making sepsis per se one of the potential mechanism leading to acute cardiac injury in COVID-19 patients. Moreover, the hyper-inflammation with endothelial dysfunction is likely be responsible of both pulmonary in-situ platelet aggregation and deep thrombosis potentially leading to severe pulmonary embolism and right ventricular failure. Besides the customary antithrombotic prophylaxis for critical patients, D-dimer levels and tighter coagulation monitoring are recommended and should guide the choice for anticoagulation treatment. We summarize the current knowledge regarding cardiovascular involvement in patient with COVID-19.","Tavazzi, Guido; Corradi, Francesco; Mojoli, Francesco; Forfori, Francesco; Via, Gabriele",Minerva anestesiol,127,16

Merkel’s televised communications deserve special attention for at least two reasons;first, Merkel was hailed as one of the few national leaders who successfully led through the first wave of the pandemic. Secondly, her communications were praised as examples of successful persuasive efforts. Using a corpus-assisted approach, this study identifies the frequent lexico-grammatical devices that she employed to do her ‘convincing’ work. The study then compares the identified features against her communicative style in speeches delivered in pre-pandemic times. The comparative insights show that in the limited mediatised time, Merkel chose a specific set of lexico-grammatical devices including certain pronouns, modal verbs, time deictics and logical connectors that highlighted the interpersonal dimension of her communications, urgency of the situation and logical cause-effect argumentation. While these devices were not entirely new in Merkel’s public statements, they were used with much higher frequency in her Covid-19 speeches signalling a discursive change in her communicative style during the evolving health crisis. The study provides support for the notion of (effective) leadership as a discursive and situated activity;an effective leader will select certain language devices from the available pool of resources that are appropriate to the context of the situation (here the Covid-19 pandemic) and its aims (persuading citizens to adhere to preventative measures). The paper finishes with an assessment of Merkel’s mediatised discourse during the first two months of the pandemic against her overall communicative style. It argues that the successfulness of her Covid-19 televised performances depended not just on the use of specific discursive devices but also on the contrast that they created with her usual impersonal approach.","Jaworska, Sylvia","Discourse, Context &amp; Media",127,1

Couples, families, and communities and individual persons in those relationships have struggled to cope with emerging depression, anxiety, and trauma, and the rise of relational conflict. In this article, we suggest that the existential nature of the pandemic's challenges require more than just the usual psychosocial interventions. We propose a taxonomy of responses to foster coping and resilience - ""Reaching Up, Down, In, and Around"". ""Reaching Up"" includes accessing spiritual, religious, and ethical values. ""Reaching Down"" includes ideas and practices that foster a revised relationship with the Earth and its resources, and that engage families to participate in activities that aid the Earth's recovery from decades of human-caused damage. ""Reaching In"" represents a turn towards experiences available in the mind and in shared minds in relationships that provide pleasure, excitement, joy, and peace, given that external sources of these emotions are of limited availability due to quarantine. ""Reaching Around"" involves reframing the mandate for ""social distancing"" as fostering social connection and support while maintaining physical distancing. The challenges for family therapists, whose practices are confined largely to online therapy, and who are struggling with the same fears and constraints as those persons they are attempting to help, are also discussed.","Fraenkel, Peter; Cho, Wonyoung L",Fam. process,127,1

Two predominant subclades within the B.1.526 lineage have been identified, one containing the E484K mutation in the receptor-binding domain (1,2), which attenuates in vitro neutralization by multiple SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and is present in variants of concern (VOCs) first identified in South Africa (B.1.351) (4) and Brazil (P.1).* The NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) analyzed laboratory and epidemiologic data to characterize cases of B.1.526 infection, including illness severity, transmission to close contacts, rates of possible reinfection, and laboratory-diagnosed breakthrough infections among vaccinated persons. Preliminary data suggest that the B.1.526 variant does not lead to more severe disease and is not associated with increased risk for infection after vaccination (breakthrough infection) or reinfection. Because relatively few specimens were sequenced over the study period, the statistical power might have been insufficient to detect modest differences in rates of uncommon outcomes such as breakthrough infection or reinfection. Collection of timely viral genomic data for a larger proportion of citywide cases and rapid integration with population-based surveillance data would enable improved understanding of the impact of emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants and specific mutations to help guide public health intervention efforts.","Thompson, Corinne N; Hughes, Scott; Ngai, Stephanie; Baumgartner, Jennifer; Wang, Jade C; McGibbon, Emily; Devinney, Katelynn; Luoma, Elizabeth; Bertolino, Daniel; Hwang, Christina; Kepler, Kelsey; Del Castillo, Cybill; Hopkins, Melissa; Lee, Henry; DeVito, Andrea K; Rakeman, Jennifer L; Fine, Anne D",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,127,16

We reported the case of a 6-year-old child presented with acute abdomen and then diagnosed with MIS-C. In addition, to better portray this new entity, we performed a systematic review of MIS-C gastrointestinal features and particularly on those mimicking surgical emergencies. Methods: We described the clinical presentation, the diagnostic approach and the therapeutic outcomes of our MIS-C patient. Parallel to this, we conducted a systematic literature search using Google Scholar, PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, focusing on gastrointestinal MIS-C. Results: Our patient was initially assessed by the surgical team due to his query acute abdomen. Following the diagnosis of MIS-C with myocarditis, intravenous methylprednisolone (2 mg/Kg/day) and intravenous immunoglobulins (2 gr/Kg single infusion) were promptly started, leading to clinical improvement. According to our literature search, patients with MIS-C have a high rate of severe abdominal symptoms resembling surgical emergencies (appendicitis, obstruction, etc.) and a not negligible number of those patients have been surgically explored with variable findings. Conclusions: We encourage pediatric surgeons in the upcoming months of COVID-19 pandemic to evaluate myocardial function prior to surgical abdominal exploration. In children with query acute abdomen, MIS-C should be promptly ruled out in order to avoid unnecessary surgeries that could worsen the already frail outcome of this new syndrome. Nevertheless, it should be considered that MIS-C might well encompass complications (e.g. appendicitis, segmental intestinal ischemia) which need swift surgical treatment.","Valitutti, Francesco; Verde, Alessandra; Pepe, Angela; Sorrentino, Eduardo; Veneruso, Deborah; Ranucci, Giusy; Orlando, Francesca; Mastrominico, Augusto; Grella, Mia Giovanna; Mandato, Claudia",J Pediatr Surg Case Rep,127,16

However, because SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR may remain positive for months after infection, positive results may represent active or past infection. We determined the prevalence and infectiousness of patients who were admitted for reasons unrelated to COVID-19 but tested positive on admission screening. METHODS: We conducted an observational study at the University of Iowa Hospitals & Clinics from July 7 to October 25, 2020. All patients admitted without suspicion of COVID-19 infection were included and medical records of those with a positive admission screening test were reviewed. Infectiousness was determined using patient history, PCR cycle threshold (Ct) value, and serology. RESULTS: A total of 5,913 patients were screened and admitted for reasons unrelated to COVID-19. Of these, 101 had positive admission RT-PCR results. Thirty-six patient were excluded because they had respiratory signs/symptoms on admission on chart review. Sixty-five patients (1.1%) did not have respiratory symptoms. A total of 55 patients had Ct values available and were included in this analysis. The median age was 56 years, and (51%) were male. Our assessment revealed that 23 patients (42%) were likely infectious. The median duration of in-hospital isolation was five days for those likely infectious and two days for those deemed non-infectious. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 infection was infrequent among patients admitted for reasons unrelated to COVID-19.

Vaccines are ideal solutions to prevent infection, but treatments are also needed for those who have contracted the virus to limit negative outcomes, when vaccines are not applicable. Viruses must cross host cell membranes during their lifecycle, creating a dependency on processes involving membrane dynamics. Thus, in this study we examined whether the synthetic machinery for glycosphingolipids, biologically active components of cell membranes, can serve as a therapeutic target to combat SARS-CoV-2. We examined the antiviral effect of two specific inhibitors of glucosylceramide synthase (GCS); (i) Genz-123346, an analogue of the FDA-approved drug Cerdelga®, and (ii) GENZ-667161, an analogue of venglustat which is currently under phase III clinical trials. We found that both GCS inhibitors inhibit replication of SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, these inhibitors also disrupt replication of influenza virus A/PR/8/34 (H1N1).

In this work, we propose the first MPC based protocol for private feature selection based on the filter method, which is independent of model training, and can be used in combination with any MPC protocol to rank features. We propose an efficient feature scoring protocol based on Gini impurity to this end. To demonstrate the feasibility of our approach for practical data science, we perform experiments with the proposed MPC protocols for feature selection in a commonly used machine-learning-as-a-service configuration where computations are outsourced to multiple servers, with semi-honest and with malicious adversaries. Regarding effectiveness, we show that secure feature selection with the proposed protocols improves the accuracy of classifiers on a variety of real-world data sets, without leaking information about the feature values or even which features were selected. Regarding efficiency, we document runtimes ranging from several seconds to an hour for our protocols to finish, depending on the size of the data set and the security settings.","Li, Xiling; Dowsley, Rafael; Cock, Martine De",,127,17

METHODS: Diagnostic accuracy of (1) TRUPCR SARS-CoV-2 Kit (Black Bio, India) (2) TaqPath RT-PCR COVID-19 Kit (Thermo Fisher, USA) (3) Allplex 2019-nCOV Assay (See gene, Korea), (4) Patho detect COVID-19 PCR kit (My Lab, India) (5) LabGun COVID-19 RT-PCR Kit (Lab Genomics, Korea) (6) Fosun COVID-19 RT-PCR detection kit (Fosun Ltd, China) (7) Real time Fluorescent RT PCR kit for SARS CoV - 2 (BGI, china) was evaluated on pre characterised 40 positive and 10 negative COVID-19 sample pools. RESULTS: All seven kits detected all sample pool with low Ct value (<30). While testing weak positive pooled samples with high Ct value (>30); TRUPCR Kit, TaqPath Kit, Allplex Assay and BGI RT PCR kit showed 100% sensitivity, specificity and accuracy. However; Fosun kit, LabGun Kit and Patho detect kit could detect only 90%, 85% and 75% of weak positive samples respectively. CONCLUSION: We conclude that all seven commercially available RT-PCR kits included in this study can be used for routine molecular diagnosis of COVID-19. While performing pooled sample testing it might be advisable to use those kits that performed best regarding the positive identification in samples pool i.e. TRUPCR SARS-CoV-2 Kit, TaqPath RT-PCR COVID-19 Kit, Allplex 2019-nCOV Assay and BGI Real time RT PCR kit for detecting SARS CoV - 2.

This virus has changed our coexistence rules and, in consequence, has reshaped the daily activities in modern societies. Thus, there are many efforts to understand the virus behaviour in order to reduce its negative impact, and these efforts produce an incredible amount of information and data sources every week. Data scientists, which use techniques such as Machine learning, are focusing their abilities to develop mathematical models for analysing this critical situation. This paper uses Machine Learning techniques as tools to help understand some specific new patterns in Covid patients that arise from unknown complex interactions in the transmission-dynamic models of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, and their relation with the corresponding social contact patterns which are often known or can be inferred from populations variables. One of the main motivations of this research is to find the diseases that cause an increase in the risk of death in infected people with the Covid-19 virus. Mexico is the case of study in this research. The general conditions of health that cause death are well known generally in the world. However, these conditions in each country can differ depending on different factors such as the general health status of people. The results show that the principal causes of death in Mexico are related to age, bad eating habits, chronic diseases, and contact with infected people having not proper care. Results from the analysis show a remarkable accuracy of 87%, which is considered satisfactory.","Guzmán-Torres, José A.; Alonso-Guzmán, Elia M.; Domínguez-Mota, Francisco J.; Tinoco-Guerrero, Gerardo",Results in Physics,127,24

It enters by binding with ACE2 receptor present on the outer surface of a cell by cleaving S1/S2 with proteolytic protein Furin. Further viral replication or transcription then takes place with the help of main protease 3CLpro and polymerase RdRp. This in silco study was carried out to block ACE2, Furin, 3CLpro and RdRP with various phytochemicals to prevent SARS- CoV-2 entry and replication or transcription. Twenty different phytochemicals were screened to understand the drug-likeliness obeying Lipinski's rule 5 and further, molecular docking was performed using these phytochemicals to block their respective target proteins. All the phytochemicals follow Lipinski's rule of five and molecular docking result shows best binding affinity of Podofilox - 7.54 kcal/mol with ACE2, Psoralidin - 8.04 kcal/mol with Furin, Ursolic acid - 8.88 kcal/mol with 3CLpro and Epiafzelechin - 8.26 kcal/mol with RdRp. Thus, blocking two human receptors ACE2 and Furin with Podofilox and Psoralidin respectively may prevent the viral entry into the cells. Also blocking viral proteins 3CLpro and RdRp with Ursolic acid and Epiafzelechin may prevent viral replication or transcription. Using this combination therapy of blocking the receptors responsible for viral entry and viral proteins responsible for replication or transcription may prevent SARS- CoV-2 infection.","Dey, Dipjyoti; Dey, Nirban; Ghosh, Shalini; Chandrasekaran, Natrajan; Mukherjee, Amitava; Thomas, John",Virusdisease,127,26

METHODS: A search was conducted in PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases up to April 2020. The present study compared internal fixation and hemiarthroplasty in the treatment of unstable intertrochanteric fractures in the elderly. RevMan5.3 software provided by the International Cochrane Group was used for the meta-analysis. To compare the differences in the operation time, intraoperative bleeding, length of hospital stay, superficial infection, Harris hip score, mortality within 1 year, mortality within 2 years, reoperation, incidence of deep venous thrombosis (DVT), partial weight-bearing time, non-union, and implant-related complications between an internal fixation group and an hemiarthroplasty group. RESULTS: A total of 1300 patients were included in nine studies. The results showed that the operation time (MD = -18.09, 95% CI: -27.85--8.34, P = 0.0003), intraoperative bleeding (MD = -195.31, 95% CI: -244.8--147.74, P < 0.0001), implant-related complications (MD = 3.83, 95% CI: 1.74-8.45, P = 0.0008), and partial weight-bearing time (MD = 17.21, 95% CI: 1.63-32.79, P = 0.03) have statistical significance. However, there is not statistical significance for the Harris hip joint function scale (HHS) (MD = 5.60, 95% CI: -1.13-12.33, P = 0.10), DVT (MD = 1.02, 95% CI: 0.45-2.27, P = 0.97), length of hospital stay (MD = -1.08, 95% CI: -2.82-0.66, P = 0.22), superficial Infection (OR = 0.92, 95% CI: 0.43-1.98, P = 0.89), mortality within 1 year (OR = 0.95, 95% CI: 0.61-1.48, P = 0.81), mortality within 2 years (OR = 0.93, 95% CI: 0.61-1.43, P = 0.75), reoperation (MD = 1.80, 95% CI: 0.64-5.04, P = 0.26), and non-union (OR = 1.20, 95% CI: 0.48-3.03, P = 0.70). The result of the subgroup analysis showed no significant differences between the less than 2 years follow-up and the 2 years or more follow-up group. The only difference was for the Harris hip score: the internal fixation group was superior to the hemiarthroplasty group in the less than 2 years subgroup analysis, while there was no difference between the internal fixation group hemiarthroplasty group in the 2 years or more subgroup analysis. CONCLUSION: Compared with the internal fixation group, those in the hemiarthroplasty group could carry out weight-bearing training early and implant-related complications were reduced, but it requires longer operation time and there is greater intraoperative blood loss. There is no difference in mortality, the incidence of DVT, non-union, HHS, reoperation, length of hospital stay, and superficial infection. Hemiarthroplasty may be a better choice for unstable intertrochanteric fractures in the elderly.","Tu, Dong-Peng; Liu, Zheng; Yu, Yi-Kang; Xu, Chao; Shi, Xiao-Lin",Orthopaedic surgery (Online),127,1

Early modelling studies highlighted the potential of digital contact tracing to break transmission chains, and Google and Apple subsequently developed the Exposure Notification (EN) framework, making it available to the vast majority of smartphones. A growing number of governments have launched or announced EN-based contact tracing apps, but their effectiveness remains unknown. Here, we report early findings of the digital contact tracing app deployment in Switzerland. We demonstrate proof-of-principle that digital contact tracing reaches exposed contacts, who then test positive for SARS-CoV-2. This indicates that digital contact tracing is an effective complementary tool for controlling the spread of SARS-CoV-2.

While the relation between public emergencies and psychological distress is well known, research on therelationship between psychological resilience and mental health is very limited during the outbreak of public health emergencies. OBJECTIVE: This research investigated the relationship between psychological resilience and mental health (depression, anxiety, somatization symptoms) among the general population in China. METHOD: Psychological resilience, depression, anxiety, and somatization symptoms of 1770 Chinese citizens were investigated during the epidemic peak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) (23rd February 2020 to 2nd March 2020). The analyses were done through the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC), the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) scale, and the Patient Health Questionnaire-15 (PHQ-15) scale. RESULTS: The prevalence of depression, anxiety, somatization symptoms was found to be 47.1%, 31.9%, 45.9%, respectively, among all participants. From them, 18.2% showed moderate to severe symptoms of depression, 8.8% showed moderate to severe symptoms of anxiety, and 16.6% showed moderate to severe symptoms of somatization. Psychological resilience was negatively correlated with depression (standardized ß = -0.490, P < 0.001), anxiety (standardized ß = -0.443, P < 0.001), and somatization symptom scores (standardized ß = -0.358, P < 0.001), while controlling for confounding factors. Analysis of the three-factor resilience structure showed that strength and tenacity were correlated with depression (standardized ß = -0.256, P < 0.001; standardized ß = -0.217, P < 0.001), anxiety (standardized ß = -0.268, P < 0.001; standardized ß = -0.147, P < 0.001), and somatization symptoms (standardized ß = -0.236, P < 0.001; standardized ß = -0.126, P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that there is a high prevalence of psychological distresses among the general population at the peak of the COVID-19 epidemic in China, which is negatively correlated with resilience. Psychological resilience represents an essential target for psychological intervention in a public health emergency.","Ran, Liuyi; Wang, Wo; Ai, Ming; Kong, Yiting; Chen, Jianmei; Kuang, Li",Soc Sci Med,127,4

This study describes the impact of socioeconomic deprivation on 30-day survival following critical care admission for COVID-19, and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on critical care capacity in Scotland. Methods: This cohort study used linked national hospital records including ICU, virology testing and national death records to identify and describe patients with COVID-19 admitted to critical care units in Scotland. Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess the impact of deprivation on 30-day mortality. Critical care capacity was described by reporting the percentage of baseline ICU bed utilisation required. Findings: There were 735 patients with COVID-19 admitted to critical care units across Scotland from 1/3/2020 to 20/6/2020. There was a higher proportion of patients from more deprived areas, with 183 admissions (24.9%) from the most deprived quintile and 100 (13.6%) from the least deprived quintile. Overall, 30-day mortality was 34.8%. After adjusting for age, sex and ethnicity, mortality was significantly higher in patients from the most deprived quintile (OR 1.97, 95%CI 1.13, 3.41, p=0.016). ICUs serving populations with higher levels of deprivation spent a greater amount of time over their baseline ICU bed capacity. Interpretation: Patients with COVID-19 living in areas with greatest socioeconomic deprivation had a higher frequency of critical care admission and a higher adjusted 30-day mortality. ICUs in health boards with higher levels of socioeconomic deprivation had both higher peak occupancy and longer duration of occupancy over normal maximum capacity. Funding: None.","Lone, Nazir I; McPeake, Joanne; Stewart, Neil I; Blayney, Michael C; Seem, Robert Chan; Donaldson, Lorraine; Glass, Elaine; Haddow, Catriona; Hall, Ros; Martin, Caroline; Paton, Martin; Smith-Palmer, Alison; Kaye, Callum T; Puxty, Kathryn",Lancet Reg Health Eur,127,20

METHODS: All psychiatric admissions aged 65 or older in the 3 months before and after COVID-19 (from November 2019 to April 2020), in the previous 2 years (from November 2017 to April 2018 and from November 2018 to April 2019), and in the year of SARS (from November 2002 to April 2003) in a major gazette inpatient psychiatric unit in Hong Kong, which serves a catchment population of 1.4 million, were anonymously reviewed. The number of psychogeriatric admissions between different timeframes was compared, and factors that might explain the increase in admissions following COVID-19 were examined. RESULTS: Psychogeriatric admissions increased by 21.4% following the COVID-19 outbreak. This increase was not explained by seasonal variation and was greater and lasted longer than that in SARS. A rising trend in admissions for older adults living in residential care homes was observed. The increase in admissions was associated with fewer outpatient attendance, fewer home visits by nurses, and more older adults with dementia requiring inpatient care. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight the impact of COVID-19 on older adults' mental health, greater demand for inpatient psychogeriatric services in COVID-19 than in SARS, and the importance of maintaining support for community-living older adults, in particular those with dementia, and their caregivers in reducing the needs for inpatient psychiatric treatment during the pandemic.

On top of traditional VTE risk factors encountered during COVID-19 such as prolonged bed rest, hypoxemia and intravascular material, main features of patients with severe forms (old age, obesity) explain in part the VTE frequency. In addition, COVID-19 causes an endothelial disease following endotheliitis after the direct invasion of endothelial cells and a prothrombotic state secondary to the strong inflammatory response to infection. Altogether, these mechanisms lead to an extensive immunothrombosis within the pulmonary vasculature. VTE risk stratification to prescribe adequate anticoagulation is an imperious requirement in the COVID-19 treatment. So far, guidelines are mainly based on observational data.

Patients with pulmonary diseases in the COVID-19 pandemic period were analyzed. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Non-COVID-19 cases who were hospitalized in the pulmonology clinic, outpatients, and patients who applied to the non-COVID-19 emergency service and requested a pulmonology consultation in the period from March 16, 2020 to May 15, 2020 and in the same period of the previous year (i.e., from March 16, 2019 to May 15, 2019) were included in this study. RESULTS: In the pandemic period, it was found that there was an 84% decrease in outpatient admissions, a 43% decrease in inpatients, and a 75% decrease in emergency services. During the pandemic period, in outpatient setting, male and younger case admissions increased, admissions with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and interstitial lung diseases decreased, whereas the frequency of admission to asthma, pneumonia, and pulmonary thromboembolism increased. In the period of the pandemic, patients with asthma, COPD, and lung cancer were less hospitalized, whereas patients with pulmonary thromboembolism, pneumonia, and pleural effusion were hospitalized more. In non-COVID-19 patient treatments during the pandemic period, usage of a metered dose inhaler increased.

However, the rising global trends of the so-called incurable diseases continue to put pressure on Pharma industries and other drug discovery platforms. In the past, drugs with more than one target were deemed as undesirable options with interest being on the one-drug-single target. Despite the successes of the single-target drugs, it is currently beyond doubt that these drugs have limited efficacy against complex diseases in which the pathogenesis is dependent on a set of biochemical events and several bioreceptors operating concomitantly. Different approaches have thus been proposed to come up with effective drugs to combat even the complex diseases. In the past, the focus was on producing drugs from screening plant compounds; today, we talk about combination therapy and multi-targeting drugs. The multi-target drugs have recently attracted much attention as promising tools to fight against most challenging diseases, and thus a new research focus area. This review will discuss the potential impact of multi-target drug approach on various complex diseases with focus on malaria, tuberculosis (TB), diabetes and neurodegenerative diseases as the main representatives of multifactorial diseases. We will also discuss alternative ideas to solve the current problems bearing in mind the fourth industrial revolution on drug discovery.","Makhoba, Xolani H; Viegas, Claudio; Mosa, Rebamang A; Viegas, Flávia P D; Pooe, Ofentse J",Drug Des Devel Ther,127,6

The co-operation and compliance of people entering quarantine are critical to its success. However, owing to the isolating and social distancing nature of quarantine, it often leads to extreme economic hardship and shortages in basic needs such as food, medicine, water and communication - and to the curtailment of certain universal social norms such as attending a parent's funeral. To escape these hardships, people often refuse to enter voluntary quarantine, or breach quarantine rules. In these circumstances, health authorities are obliged to act in the best interests of the public and obtain court orders to force some people into quarantine. In further extreme circumstances, when a national lockdown is ordered, non-compliance with quarantine measures may result in arrests and penalties. The scope of this article is limited to the period prior to and following such a lockdown, during which quarantine may still be vital for the containment of COVID-19. Because a quarantine order will deprive an individual of his or her freedom, this must be carefully balanced with the public interest.

Cyberchondria can be a vulnerability factor for developing anxiety in a pandemic situation, particularly when the Internet is flooded with (mis)information. The aim of our study was to examine how cyberchondria is related to changes in levels of COVID-19 concern and safety behaviours among persons living in Croatia during the period in which the first COVID-19 case was identified and when the country recorded its first fatality. Repeated cross-sectional data collection was conducted during two waves over a period of three weeks (N1 = 888; N2 = 966). The first began on the day of the first confirmed case of COVID-19 in Croatia (February 24th, 2020) and the second wave began three weeks later, on the day the first COVID-19 fatality was recorded in Croatia (March 19th, 2020). Participants completed an online questionnaire regarding various COVID-19 concerns and safety behaviours aimed at disease prevention (information seeking, avoidance and hygiene) and a measure of cyberchondria (Short Cyberchondria Scale, SCS). We analysed whether changes to the epidemiological situation during the period between the two waves of data collection led to an increase in COVID-19 related behaviour directly and indirectly via an increase in COVID-19 concerns. The results indicated that, between the two waves of research, there was a pronounced increase in concerns regarding COVID-19 (b = 1.11, p < .001) as well as significant behavioural changes (b = 1.18-2.34, p < .001). Also, results demonstrated that cyberchondria plays a moderating role in these changes. In the first wave, persons with severe cyberchondria were already intensely concerned with safety behaviours. High cyberchondria and high levels of concern about the COVID-19 are associated with intense avoidance behaviours, R2 = .63, p < .001. A moderated partial mediation model was confirmed, in which the effect of the epidemiological situation was weaker for those with higher results on the SCS (as indicated by index of moderated mediation between -.10 and -.15, p < .05). As such, cyberchondria is a contributing factor to long-term anxiety and its impact during pandemic on the general mental health burden should therefore be further investigated.","Jokic-Begic, Natasa; Lauri Korajlija, Anita; Mikac, Una",PLoS One,127,24

However, multiple clinics and hospitals have experienced a decrease in rates of acute myocardial infarction and corresponding cardiac catheterization lab activations, raising the question: Has the risk of myocardial infarction decreased during COVID? Sleep deprivation is known to be an independent risk factor for myocardial infarction, and sleep has been importantly impacted during the pandemic, possibly due to the changes in work-home life leading to a lack of structure. We conducted a social media-based survey to assess potential mechanisms underlying the observed improvement in risk of myocardial infarction. We used validated questionnaires to assess sleep patterns, tobacco consumption and other important health outcomes to test the hypothesis that increases in sleep duration may be occurring which have a beneficial impact on health. We found that the COVID-19 pandemic led to shifts in day/night rhythm, with subjects waking up 105 minutes later during the pandemic (p <0.0001). Subjects also reported going to sleep 41 minutes later during the pandemic (p <0.0001). These shifts led to longer duration of sleep during the COVID-19 pandemic. Before the pandemic, subjects reported sleeping 6.8 hours per night, which rose to 7.5 hours during the pandemic, a 44 minute or 11% increase (p <0.0001). We acknowledge the major negative health impact of the global pandemic but would advocate for using this crisis to improve the work and sleep habits of the general population, which may lead to overall health benefits for our society.","Advani, Ira; Gunge, Deepti; Banks, Sarah; Mehta, Sagar; Park, Kenneth; Patel, Mitul; Malhotra, Atul; Crotty Alexander, Laura E",Am J Cardiol,127,15

In addition to basic clinical parameters, we periodically evaluated D-Dimer, IL-6, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), the neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), the lymphocyte to CRP ratio (LCR) and the leukocyte-CRP ratio (LeCR). ResultsThe duration of hospital stay for all three groups was nearly equivalent. There was no mortality of the subjects in any of the groups. Intermittent oxygen was administered from day of admission for up to four to five days with mask (two to four Lpm) to two subjects in Gr. 2 and one subject in Gr. 3. None of the subjects required ventilation. The D-Dimer values in Gr. 1, which was on average 751 ng/ml at baseline, decreased to 143.89 ng/ml on day 15, but increased to 202.5 ng/ml on day 30, which in groups 2 and 3 decreased on day 15 and continued to remain at normal levels until day 30. IL-6 levels decreased on day 15 from an average of 7.395 pg/ml to 3.16 pg/ml in the control, 26.18 pg/ml to 6.94 pg/ml in Gr. 2 and 6.25 pg/ml to 5.22 pg/ml in Gr. 3. However, when measured on day 30, in Gr. 1, the IL-6 increased to 55.37 pg/ml while there was only slight marginal increase in Gr. 2 but within normal range, and the levels further decreased to less than 0.5 pg/ml in Gr. 3. The same trend was observed with ESR. LCR and LeCR increased significantly in Gr. 3. NLR decreased significantly in groups 2 and 3. There was no difference in CRP within the groups. ConclusionIn this exploratory study, consumption of Aureobasidium pullulans produced beta glucans for thirty days, results in a significant control of IL6, D-Dimer and NLR, a significant increase in LCR, LeCR and marginal control of ESR in COVID-19 patients. As these beta glucans are well known food supplements with decades of a track record for safety, based on these results, we recommend larger multi-centric clinical studies to validate their use as an adjunct in the management of COVID-19 and the ensuing long COVID-19 syndrome.","Raghavan, Kadalraja; Dedeepiya, Vidyasagar Devaprasad; Suryaprakash, Vaddi; Rao, Kosagi-Sharaf; Ikewaki, Nobunao; Sonoda, Tohru; Levy, Gary A.; Iwasaki, Masaru; Senthilkumar, Rajappa; Preethy, Senthilkumar; Abraham, Samuel JK",,127,24

It considers: detected and undetected infected populations, social sequestration, release from sequestration, plus reinfection. This model, consisting of seven coupled equations, has eight coefficients which are evaluated by fitting data for eight US states that make up 43% of the US population. The evolution of Covid-19 is fairly similar among the states: variations in contact and undetected recovery rates remain below 5%; however, variations are larger in recovery rate, death rate, reinfection rate, sequestration adherence and release rate from sequestration. Projections based on the current situation indicate that Covid-19 will become endemic. If lockdowns had been kept in place, the number of deaths would most likely have been significantly lower in states that opened up. Additionally, we predict that decreasing contact rate by 10%, or increasing testing by approximately 15%, or doubling lockdown compliance (from the current ~15% to ~30%) will eradicate infections in Texas within a year. Extending our fits for all of the US states, we predict about 11 million total infections (including undetected), and 8 million cumulative confirmed cases by 1 November 2020.","Khan, Z S; Van Bussel, F; Hussain, F",Epidemiol Infect,127,24

We apply this model to the spread of the first wave of the disease in Spain, obtaining numerical results. After that, we introduce a heuristic approach in order to minimize the COVID-19 spreading by planning effective test distributions among the populations of a region over a period of time.

METHODS: We compared 2020 ED visits before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, relative to 2019 visits in 108 EDs in 18 states in 115,716 adult ED visits with diagnoses for five serious cardiovascular conditions: ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), ischemic stroke (IS), hemorrhagic stroke (HS), and heart failure (HF). We calculated weekly ratios of ED visits in 2020 to visits in 2019 in the pre-pandemic (Jan 1-March 10), early-pandemic (March 11-April 21), and later-pandemic (April 22-October 31) periods. RESULTS: ED visit ratios show that NSTEMI, IS, and HF visits dropped to lows of 56%, 64%, and 61% of 2019 levels, respectively, in the early-pandemic and gradually returned to 2019 levels over the next several months. HS visits also dropped early pandemic period to 60% of 2019 levels, but quickly rebounded. We find mixed evidence on whether STEMI visits fell, relative to pre-pandemic rates. Total adult ED visits nadired at 57% of 2019 volume during the early-pandemic period and have only party recovered since, to approximately 84% of 2019 by the end of October 2020. CONCLUSION: We confirm prior studies that ED visits for serious cardiovascular conditions declined early in the COVID-19 pandemic for NSTEMI, IS, HS, and HF, but not for STEMI. Delays or non-receipt in ED care may have led to worse outcomes.","Pines, Jesse M; Zocchi, Mark S; Black, Bernard S; Celedon, Pablo; Carlson, Jestin N; Moghtaderi, Ali; Venkat, Arvind",Am J Emerg Med,127,20

However, the relationship between LUS and CXR is not clearly defined. The aim of our study was to describe the comparison between LUS interpretation and CXR readings in the first approach to patients suspected of COVID-19. METHODS: In the time of the first COVID-19 pandemic surge, we prospectively evaluated adult patients presenting to an emergency department complaining of symptoms raising suspicion of COVID-19. Patients were studied by LUS and only those performing also CXR were analyzed. All the patients performed viral reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). LUS studies were classified in 4 categories of probabilities, based on the presence of typical or alternative signs of COVID-19-associated interstitial pneumonia. Accordingly, the CXR readings were retrospectively adapted by 2 experts in 4 categories following the standard language that describes the computed tomography (CT) findings. Patients were divided in two groups, based on the agreement of the LUS and CXR categories. Results were also compared to RT-PCR and, when available, to CT studies. RESULTS: We analyzed 139 cases (55 women, mean age 59.1 ± 15.5 years old). The LUS vs CXR results disagreed in 60 (43.2%) cases. RT-PCR was positive in 88 (63.3%) cases. In 45 cases, a CT scan was also performed and only 4 disagreed with LUS interpretation versus 24 in the comparison between CT and CXR. In 18 cases, LUS detected signs of COVID-19 pneumonia (high and intermediate probabilities) while CXR reading was negative; in 14 of these cases, a CT scan or a RT-PCR-positive result confirmed the LUS interpretation. In 6 cases, LUS detected signs of alternative diagnoses to COVID-19 pneumonia while CXR was negative; in 4 of these cases, CT scan confirmed atypical findings. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated a strong disagreement between LUS interpretation and CXR reading in the early approach to patients suspected of COVID-19. Comparison with CT studies and RT-PCR results seems to confirm the superiority of LUS over a second retrospective reading of CXR.","Volpicelli, Giovanni; Cardinale, Luciano; Fraccalini, Thomas; Calandri, Marco; Piatti, Clara; Geninatti, Carlotta; Stranieri, Giuseppe",Ultrasound J,127,1

For example, the proportions of Blacks and Hispanics in a ZCTA were positively associated with COVID-19 case rate. Contrary to the conventional hypothesis, neighborhoods with low-density housing experienced higher COVID-19 case rates. In addition, demographic changes (e.g. out-migration) during the pandemic may bias the estimates of COVID-19 rates. Future research should further investigate these neighborhood-level factors and their interactions over time to better understand the mechanisms by which they affect COVID-19.","Kim, Byoungjun; Rundle, Andrew G; Goodwin, Alicia T Singham; Morrison, Christopher N; Branas, Charles C; El-Sadr, Wafaa; Duncan, Dustin T",Health Place,127,1

Some leaders are over relying on masculine traits and dismissing feminine traits. An alternative – androgynous leadership – supports leaders in drawing from the full portfolio of behaviors.Design/methodology/approachThis paper has a theoretical approach using an extensive review of the literature.FindingsLeaders can take a number of actions to fully embrace androgynous leadership. These actions include building a diverse “tempered” team, communicating with respect, recognizing the impact of framing and moving from autopilot to realizing their best androgynous self.Research limitations/implicationsResearch limitations include a critique of Bem’s framework as outdated and dichotomous;a categorization of feminine, masculine and neutral behaviors that is determined by the authors;and a focus on leadership style that does not take other dimensions, such as health-care systems, into account.Practical implicationsThe authors propose that an “androgynous” leadership style has been used effectively by some political leaders around the globe in the COVID-19 crisis. The COVID-19 context has provided a laboratory for developing and building competence as androgynous leaders.Social implicationsThe mental capacity to look at a situation, pause and explicitly select effective behavior is necessary, but oftentimes, it is not put into practice. By not drawing from a larger portfolio of androgynous behaviors, the opportunity for leaders to their best work is missed.Originality/valueThere is an acknowledgement of the benefits of the combination of masculine and feminine leadership traits.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, HHAs may face additional challenges caring for these vulnerable patients. Our objective was to explore COVID-19 preparedness of US HHAs and compare results by urban/rural location. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Using a stratified random sample of 978 HHAs, we conducted a 22-item online survey from April 10 to 17, 2020. METHODS: Summary statistics were computed; open-ended narrative responses were synthesized using qualitative methods. RESULTS: Similar to national data, most responding HHAs (n = 121, 12% response rate) were for-profit and located in the South. Most HHAs had infectious disease outbreaks included in their emergency preparedness plan (76%), a staff member in charge of outbreak/disaster preparedness (84%), and had provided their staff with COVID-19 education and training (97%). More urban HHAs had cared for confirmed and recovered COVID-19 patients than rural HHAs, but urban HHAs had less capacity to test for COVID-19 than rural HHAs (9% vs 21%). Most (69%) experienced patient census declines and had a current and/or anticipated supply shortage. Rural agencies were affected less than urban agencies. HHAs have already rationed (69%) or implemented extended use (55%) or limited reuse (61%) of personal protective equipment (PPE). Many HHAs reported accessing supplemental PPE from state/local resources, donations, and do-it-yourself efforts; more rural HHAs had accessed these additional resources compared with urban HHAs. CONCLUSIONS/IMPLICATIONS: This survey reveals challenges that HHAs are having in responding to the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly among urban agencies. Of greatest concern are the declines in patient census, which drastically affect agency revenue, and the shortages of PPE and disinfectants. Without proper protection, HHA clinicians are at risk of self-exposure and viral transmission to patients and vulnerable family members.","Shang, Jingjing; Chastain, Ashley M; Perera, Uduwanage Gayani E; Quigley, Denise D; Fu, Caroline J; Dick, Andrew W; Pogorzelska-Maziarz, Monika; Stone, Patricia W",J Am Med Dir Assoc,127,15

Considering that traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) played an important role during outbreak of SARS and H1N1, finding potential alternative approaches for COVID-19 treatment is necessary before vaccines are developed. According to previous studies, Maxing Shigan decoction (MXSGD) present a prominent antivirus effect and is often used to treat pulmonary diseases. Furthermore, we collected 115 open prescriptions for COVID-19 therapy from the National Health Commission, State Administration of TCM and other organizations, MXSGD was identified as the key formula. However, the underlying molecular mechanism of MXSGD against COVID-19 is still unknown. AIM OF THE STUDY: The present study aimed to evaluate the therapeutic mechanism of MXSGD against COVID-19 by network pharmacology and in vitro experiment verification, and screen the potential components which could bind to key targets of COVID-19 via molecular docking method. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Multiple open-source databases related to TCM or compounds were employed to screen active ingredients and potential targets of MXSGD. Network pharmacology analysis methods were used to initially predict the antivirus and anti-inflammatory effects of MXSGD against COVID-19. IL-6 induced rat lung epithelial type â ¡ cells (RLE-6TN) damage was established to explore the anti-inflammatory damage activity of MXSGD. After MXSGD intervention, the expression level of related proteins and their phosphorylation in the IL-6 mediated JAK-STAT signaling pathway were detected by Western blot. Molecular docking technique was used to further identify the potential substances which could bind to three key targets (ACE2, Mpro and RdRp) of COVID-19. RESULTS: In this study, 105 active ingredients and 1025 candidate targets were selected for MXSGD, 83 overlapping targets related to MXSGD and COVID-19 were identified, and the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of MXSGD against COVID-19 was constructed. According to the results of biological enrichment analysis, 63 significant KEGG pathways were enriched, and most of them were related to signal transduction, immune system and virus infection. Furthermore, according the relationship between signal pathways, we confirmed MXSGD could effectively inhibit IL-6 mediated JAK-STAT signal pathway related protein expression level, decreased the protein expression levels of p-JAK2, p-STAT3, Bax and Caspase 3, and increased the protein expression level of Bcl-2, thereby inhibiting RLE-6TN cells damage. In addition, according to the LibDock scores screening results, the components with strong potential affinity (Top 10) with ACE2, Mpro and RdRp are mainly from glycyrrhiza uralensis (Chinese name: Gancao) and semen armeniacae amarum (Chinese name: Kuxingren). Among them, amygdalin was selected as the optimal candidate component bind to all three key targets, and euchrenone, glycyrrhizin, and glycyrol also exhibited superior affinity interactions with ACE2, Mpro and RdRp, respectively. CONCLUSION: This work explained the positive characteristics of multi-component, multi-target, and multi-approach intervention with MXSGD in combating COVID-19, and preliminary revealed the antiviral and anti-inflammatory pharmacodynamic substances and mechanism of MXSGD, which might provide insights into the vital role of TCM in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19.","Li, Yuan; Chu, Fuhao; Li, Ping; Johnson, Nadia; Li, Tao; Wang, Yan; An, Rongxian; Wu, Dantong; Chen, Jiena; Su, Zeqi; Gu, Xiaohong; Ding, Xia",J Ethnopharmacol,127,8

Leukoencephalopathy with microbleeds is increasingly seen in patients with COVID-19. New information is needed to delineate better the clinical implications of this infectious disease. CASE REPORT: A 46-year-old man with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with severe COVID-19. After transfer to the general wards, the patient was noted drowsy, disorientated, with slow thinking and speech. A brain MRI showed bilateral symmetrical hyperintense lesions in the deep and subcortical whiter matter, involving the splenium of the corpus callosum, as well as multiple microhemorrhages implicating the splenium and subcortical white matter. No contrast-enhanced lesions were observed in brain CT or MRI. CSF analysis showed no abnormalities, including a negative rtRT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2. An outpatient follow-up visit showed near-complete clinical recovery and resolution of the hyperintense lesions on MRI, without microbleeds change. CONCLUSION: We present the case of a survivor of severe COVID-19 who presented diffuse posthypoxic leukoencephalopathy, and microbleeds masquerading as acute necrotizing encephalopathy. We postulate that this kind of cerebral vasogenic edema with microbleeds could be the consequence of hypoxia, inflammation, the prothrombotic state and medical interventions such as mechanical ventilation and anticoagulation.","Tristán-Samaniego, Dioselina Panamá; Chiquete, Erwin; Treviño-Frenk, Irene; Rubalcava-Ortega, Johnatan; Higuera-Calleja, Jesús Antonio; Romero-Sánchez, Griselda; Espinoza-Alvarado, Lissett; Barrera-Vargas, Ana; Flores-Silva, Fernando; González-Duarte, Alejandra; Vega-Boada, Felipe; Cantú-Brito, Carlos",Int J Neurosci,127,1

The two cytokines interleukin (IL)-4 and interferon (IFN)-Î³ play key roles in the generation and regulation of cytokine storms. However, it is still unclear whether the cytokine with the largest induction amplitude is the same under different virus infections. It is unknown which is the most critical and whether there are any mathematical formulas that can fit the changing rules of cytokines. Three coronaviruses (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2), three influenza viruses (2009H1N1, H5N1 and H7N9), Ebola virus, human immunodeficiency virus, dengue virus, Zika virus, West Nile virus, hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, and enterovirus 71 were included in this analysis. We retrieved the cytokine fold change (FC), viral load, and clearance rate data from these highly pathogenic virus infections in humans and analyzed the correlations among them. Our analysis showed that interferon-inducible protein (IP)-10, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-17 are the most common cytokines with the largest induction amplitudes. Equations were obtained: the maximum induced cytokine (max) FC = IFN-Î³ FC × (IFN-Î³ FC/IL-4 FC) (if IFN-Î³ FC/IL-4 FC > 1); max FC = IL-4 FC (if IFN-Î³ FC/IL-4 FC < 1). For IFN-Î³-inducible infections, 1.30 × log2 (IFN-Î³ FC) = log10 (viral load) - 2.48 - 2.83 × (clearance rate). The clinical relevance of cytokines and their antagonists is also discussed.","Yuan, Shu; Jiang, Si-Cong; Zhang, Zhong-Wei; Fu, Yu-Fan; Hu, Jing; Li, Zi-Lin",Front Immunol,127,21

This allows to take into account differences in the response of patients to the disease according to their age. This model also allows for a heterogeneous response of the population to the social distancing measures taken by the local government.

METHOD: Pregnant women living in Quebec province (N = 1014) have been recruited in April 2020 through social media, while a state of health emergency was declared. Participants were divided in 4 groups, according to self-reported frequency of news media consulting (little or none; one time a day; several times a day; constant). They filled measures of depressive symptoms, negative affects, post-traumatic stress symptoms and anxiety specific to COVID-19. Instrument scores were grouped under a unique factor of psychological distress. RESULTS: An ANCOVA controlling for age, gestational age, education level, household annual revenue and a diagnosed mental disorder present at the time of participation in study shows that news media exposure frequency is significantly associated with psychological distress severity in pregnant women, during COVID-19 pandemic, F(3,998) = 27.02, p < 0.001, Î·2 partial = 0.08. Given the mean comparisons a posteriori, higher psychological distress rates are found as soon as news media exposure exceeds once a day (effect sizes between 0.38 and 0.81). CONCLUSIONS: The more pregnant women report consulting the news media during the COVID-19 pandemic, the more likely they are to exhibit psychological distress. Results provide one of the first empirical supports to recommendations of World Health Organization, Canada government and psychiatric associations that encourage population to limit their news media consulting during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Lemieux, Roxanne; Garon-Bissonnette, Julia; Loiselle, Mathilde; Martel, Élodie; Drouin-Maziade, Christine; Berthelot, Nicolas",Can J Psychiatry,127,33

Lockdown with effective closure of all services including routine health care services has tested the nerves of health care providers for finding novel ways of providing services without getting into the risk of exposure. Telemedicine had been an ideal option for such situations allowing all channels of communication that leverage Information Technology platforms, including voice, audio, text and digital data exchange as a help to diagnosis, prescription and follow up evaluation. Unfortunately this versatility of Telemedicine as a patient -physician interface could not be harnessed well for its technical complexities and unpreparedness of institutions and individuals. Smartphone based video calling using whatsapp messenger has been proposed as a feasible Telemedicine application to provide outpatient services in this scenario. A pilot run of outpatient services during lockdown period through whatsapp facilitated video calling at Ayurveda Gathiya Clinic, State Ayurvedic College and Hospital, Lucknow has shown a way forward of running such services with a mass appeal, ease of operation and high interface gratification among users and service providers.

The objective of this study is to compare LUS and chest computed tomography (CT) results in COVID-19 survivors with the intent of defining the utility of LUS for long-term follow-up of COVID-19 respiratory disease. METHODS: Prospective observational study that enrolled consecutive survivors of COVID-19 with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure (HARF) admitted to the Respiratory Intensive Care Unit. Three months following hospital discharge, patients underwent LUS, chest CT, body plethysmography and laboratory testing, the comparison of which forms the basis of this report. RESULTS: 38 patients were enrolled, with a total of 190 lobes analysed: men 27/38 (71.1%), mean age 60.6 y (SD 10.4). LUS findings and pulmonary function tests outcomes were compared between patients with and without ILD, showing a statistically significant difference in terms of LUS score (p: 0.0002), FEV1 (p: 0.0039) and FVC (p: 0.012). ROC curve both in lobe by lobe and in patient's overall analysis revealed an outstanding ILD discrimination ability of LUS (AUC: 0.94 and 0.95 respectively) with a substantial Cohen's coefficient (K: 0.74 and 0.69). CONCLUSIONS: LUS has an outstanding discrimination ability compared to CT in identifying an ILD of at least mild grade in the post COVID-19 follow-up.

The following two groups of pregnant women were studied: index group of 66 patients with COVID-19, and comparison group of 40 women with no symptoms of viral infection. Macroscopic and microscopic examination, and the IHC analysis of placental samples were carried out. Clinical and anamnestic characteristics of patients with COVID-19 were analyzed taking into account disease severity, delivery route and perinatal outcome.

Most striking is the huge difference in risk to dialysis patients and staff across the world. Per-population cases and deaths among dialysis patients vary over 100-fold across participating countries, mirroring burden in the general population. International data indicate case fatality ratio remains at 10-30% among dialysis patients, confirming the gravity of infection, and that cases are much more common among in-center than home dialysis patients. This latter finding merits urgent study because in-center patients often have greater community exposure, and in-center transmission may be uncommon under optimal protocols. Greater telemedicine use is a welcome change here to stay, and our community needs to improve emergency planning and protect dialysis staff from the next pandemic.

MZ B cells have been shown to be important in mediating immunity to various bacteria including Streptococcus pneuomniae and are also implicated in inflammatory syndromes including lupus erythematosus. The intestinal microbiota is responsible for producing short chain fatty acids (SCFA), which can regulate immune cell function by several mechanisms including ligation of the G-protein coupled receptor, GPR43. Herein, we show that MZ B cells express Gpr43 mRNA and that the absence of this receptor impacts on MZ B cell surface marker expression and antibody production. In T cell-independent responses to the hapten 4-Hydroxy-3-nitrophenylacetic acid (NP), mice deficient in GPR43 displayed higher serum titres of NP-specific antibodies. Moreover, in response to a pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine, GPR43-deficient mice developed robust serum antibody responses and had markedly increased numbers of splenic antibody-secreting cells, compared with control mice. Finally, serum IgM autoantibodies to double stranded DNA and phosphatidylcholine were increased in resting 10-15 week-old mice lacking GPR43. Taken together, mice lacking GPR43 have heightened antibody responses to T cell-independent antigens, which may be due to impaired regulation of MZ B cells.","Rohrbeck, Leona; Adori, Monika; Wang, Shan; He, Chenfei; Tibbitt, Christopher A; Chernyshev, Mark; Sirel, Madle; Ribacke, Ulf; Murrell, Ben; Bohlooly-Y, Mohammad; Karlsson, Mikael Ci; Karlsson Hedestam, Gunilla B; Coquet, Jonathan M",Immunol. cell biol,127,25

Furthermore, the lethality rate of COVID-19 in Brazil is greater than in many other Latin American countries (Chile, Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay). However, the number of new confirmed cases in Brazil has little statistical relevance because only a small part of the population has been tested. In relation to Brazilian municipalities, we highlight the 10 states with the highest lethality rates, ranked from highest to lowest. Also, predictions about the increaseor decrease innew cases and deaths for states and capital cities are presented.

However, lacking is a temperance in enthusiasm for their possible use as well as sufficient perspective on their effects and side-effects. CQ and HCQ have well-known properties of being diprotic weak bases that preferentially accumulate in acidic organelles (endolysosomes and Golgi apparatus) and neutralize luminal pH of acidic organelles. These primary actions of CQ and HCQ are responsible for their anti-malarial effects; malaria parasites rely on acidic digestive vacuoles for survival. Similarly, de-acidification of endolysosomes and Golgi by CQ and HCQ may block severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) integration into host cells because SARS-CoV-2 may require an acidic environment for its entry and for its ability to bud and infect bystander cells. Further, de-acidification of endolysosomes and Golgi may underly the immunosuppressive effects of these two drugs. However, modern cell biology studies have shown clearly that de-acidification results in profound changes in the structure, function and cellular positioning of endolysosomes and Golgi, in signaling between these organelles and other subcellular organelles, and in fundamental cellular functions. Thus, studying the possible therapeutic effects of CQ and HCQ against COVID-19 must occur concurrent with studies of the extent to which these drugs affect organellar and cell biology. When comprehensively examined, a better understanding of the Janus sword actions of these and other drugs might yield better decisions and better outcomes.","Chen, Xuesong; Geiger, Jonathan D",Cell Signal,127,20

Its consequences on the well-being of individuals needs to be better understood. The objective of this work was to evaluate the impact of lockdown on the well-being of a general population and the factors associated with this potential impairment of well-being in a population that has been only lightly affected by COVID-19 such as in Reunion island, an overseas French department. METHODS: An online survey was proposed to the population of Reunion Island between the 35th and 54th days of lockdown relative to pre- and per-lockdown periods. Well-being was measured by the 5-item World Health Organization Well-Being Index, with some questions about sleep habits (Pittsburgh questionnaire), weekly physical activity (IPAQ), health, and lifestyle. RESULTS: Four hundred volunteers answered the survey. They reported a 15.7% decrease in well-being (p < 0.001), accompanied by increased anxiety (p < 0.001), decreased weekly physical activity (p < 0.001), delayed and poorer quality sleep (p < 0.001). Multivariate logistical analysis showed that impairment in well-being during lockdown was independently associated with an increase in anxiety (odds ratio (OR): 4.77 (3.26-6.98), p < 0.001), decrease in weekly physical activity (OR: 0.58 (0.43-0.79), p < 0.001), and poor-quality sleep (OR: 0.29 (0.19-0.43), p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: This study suggested an impairment in well-being during lockdown, associated with anxiety, lack of physical activity and sleep disruptions. Public policies must consider these factors as levers for improving the well-being of the population in order to effectively combat the spread of COVID-19.","Chouchou, Florian; Augustini, Muriel; Caderby, Teddy; Caron, Nathan; Turpin, Nicolas A; Dalleau, Georges",Sleep medicine,127,26

Accordingly, the current study examined how vaccine hesitancy contributes to clinical levels of depression, anxiety, and peritraumatic stress among individuals who had received COVID-19 vaccinations. METHODS: We analyzed data obtained from 254 vaccinated individuals, and assessed vaccine hesitancy, depression, anxiety, and peritraumatic distress, as well as several demographic, health, and COVID-19-related factors. RESULTS: Logistic regressions demonstrated that above and beyond socio-demographic, health, and COVID-19-related factors, COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy was the most prominent risk factor for anxiety, depression, and peritraumatic distress. Higher levels of vaccine hesitancy were found to double the risk for depression and peritraumatic stress (ORs > 2), and to triple the risk for anxiety (OR > 3). LIMITATIONS: A cross-sectional design; a preliminary study requiring further investigation CONCLUSIONS: This study points to the importance of vaccine hesitancy among vaccinated populations and provides knowledge regarding its associations with negative psychiatric outcomes. These findings may offer important information for healthcare practitioners and policy makers in their attempt to encourage individuals to receive COVID-19 vaccinations and emphasize the need to further understand the underlying mechanisms of psychiatric morbidity among vaccinated individuals.","Palgi, Yuval; Bergman, Yoav S; Ben-David, Boaz; Bodner, Ehud",J Affect Disord,127,3

This creates a necessity to validate unverified collection devices from manufacturers that may not be a registered supplier for medical devices. As clinical laboratories do not routinely perform quality control of established collection devices, there is a need to have a systematic, robust approach towards the assessment of substitute unregistered collection swabs and viral transport media (VTM). A discussion of the aspects requiring consideration when determining the suitability and implementation of new collection devices is presented. These specific assessment criteria include an inspection of device integrity, determination of swab and VTM sterility and in vitro performance, VTM stability and examination of clinical performance of the device. This method was used in a front-line medical microbiology laboratory on swabs and VTM from an unregistered manufacturer, with suboptimal results which precluded implementation.

The sampling designs used are often biased in that they do not reflect the true underlying populations. For instance, individuals with strong symptoms are more likely to be tested than those with no symptoms. This results in biased estimates of prevalence (too high) and over-estimation of fatality rates. Typical post-sampling corrections are not always possible. Here we present a simple bias correction methodology derived and adapted from a correction for publication bias in meta analysis studies. The methodology is general enough to allow a wide variety of customization making it more useful in practice. Implementation is easily done using already collected information.

Moreover, these CD14dimCD16 monocytes showed decreased expression of established markers of adhesion, migration, and T-cell activation (CD54, CD62L, CX3CR1, CD80, and HLA-DR). Decreased numbers of CD14dimCD16+ monocytes were associated with the occurrence of EP. Kaplan-Meier curves illustrate that CAD + SARS-CoV-2 patients with numbers below the median of CD14dimCD16+ monocytes (median 1443 cells/mL) reached EP significantly more often compared to patients with numbers above the median (log-rank 5.03, P = 0.025). CONCLUSION : Decreased numbers of CD14dimCD16+ monocytes are associated with rapidly progressive respiratory failure in CAD + SARS-CoV-2 patients. Intensified risk assessments comprising monocyte sub- and phenotypes may help to identify patients at risk for respiratory failure.","Mueller, Karin Anne Lydia; Langnau, Carolin; Günter, Manina; Pöschel, Simone; Gekeler, Sarah; Petersen-Uribe, Álvaro; Kreisselmeier, Klaus-Peter; Klingel, Karin; Bösmüller, Hans; Li, Bo; Jaeger, Philippa; Castor, Tatsiana; Rath, Dominik; Gawaz, Meinrad Paul; Autenrieth, Stella E",Cardiovasc Res,127,1

On August 17, 2017, the two Advanced LIGO and the Advanced Virgo interferometers detected a GW produced by two merging neutron stars. The subsequent localization of the source in the sky, thanks to the presence of a third detector, led to the detection of the electromagnetic counterpart and follow-up of the event by roughly 70 electromagnetic and neutrino telescopes. After the first two data taking runs (O1 and O2), the LIGO-Virgo network detected 11 GWs from 10 binary black holes and one binary neutron star. On April 1, 2019, Advanced Virgo and Advanced LIGO started their third observing period (O3).

One drug that has shown promising results in vitro is nitazoxanide. Unlike other postulated drugs, nitazoxanide shows a high ratio of maximum plasma concentration (Cmax), after 1 day of 500 mg twice daily (BD), to the concentration required to inhibit 50% replication (EC50) of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (Cmax: E C50 roughly equal to 14:1). As such, it is important to investigate the safety of nitazoxanide for further trials. Furthermore, treatments for COVI D-19 should be cheap to promote global access, but prices of many drugs are far higher than the costs of production. We aimed to conduct a review of the safety of nitazoxanide for any prior indication and calculate its minimum costs of production. Methods: A review of nitazoxanide clinical research was conducted using EMBASE and MEDLINE databases, supplemented by ClinicalTrials.gov. We searched for phase 2 or 3 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing nitazoxanide with placebo or active control for 5-14 days in participants experiencing acute infections of any kind. Data extracted were grade 1-4 and serious adverse events (AEs). Data were also extracted on gastrointestinal (GI) AEs, as well as hepatorenal and cardiovascular effects. Active pharmaceutical ingredient cost data from 2016 to 2019 were extracted from the Panjiva database and adjusted for 5% loss during production, costs of excipients, formulation, a 10% profit margin and tax. Two dosages, at 500 mg BD and a higher dose of 1100 mg three times daily (TDS), were considered. Our estimated costs were compared with publicly available list prices from a selection of countries. Results: Nine RCTs of nitazoxanide were identified for inclusion. These RCTs accounted for 1514 participants and an estimated 95.3 person-years-of-follow-up. No significant differences were found in any of the AE endpoints assessed, across all trials or on subgroup analyses of active- or placebo-controlled trials. Mild GI AEs increased with dose. No hepatorenal or cardiovascular concerns were raised, but few appropriate metrics were reported. There were no teratogenic concerns, but the evidence base was very limited. Based on a weighted-mean cost of US $61/kg, a 14-day course of treatment with nitazoxanide 500 mg BD would cost $1.41. The daily cost would therefore be $0.10. The same 14-day course could cost $3944 in US commercial pharmacies, and $3 per course in Pakistan, India and Bangladesh. At a higher dose of 1100 mg TDS, our estimated cost was $4.08 per 14-day course, equivalent to $0.29 per day. Conclusion: Nitazoxanide demonstrates a good safety profile at approved doses. However, further evidence is required regarding hepatorenal and cardiovascular effects, as well as teratogenicity. We estimate that it would be possible to manufacture nitazoxanide as generic for $1.41 for a 14-day treatment course at 500 mg BD, up to $4.08 at 1100 mg TDS. Further trials in COVI D-19 patients should be initiated. If efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 is demonstrated in clinical studies, nitazoxanide may represent a safe and affordable treatment in the ongoing pandemic.","Pepperrell, Toby; Pilkington, Victoria; Owen, Andrew; Wang, Junzheng; Hill, Andrew M.",J.

Pre-mRNA splicing, furthermore, relies on the spatial proximity of the splice junctions that can be separated by very long introns. Similar effects appear in the processing of RNA virus genomes. Albeit a crude measure, the distribution of spatial distances in thermodynamic equilibrium therefore provides useful information on the overall shape of the molecule can provide insights into the interplay of its functional domains. Spatial distance can be approximated by the graph-distance in RNA secondary structure. We show here that the equilibrium distribution of graph-distances between arbitrary nucleotides can be computed in polynomial time by means of dynamic programming. A naive implementation would yield recursions with a very high time complexity of O(n^11). Although we were able to reduce this to O(n^6) for many practical applications a further reduction seems difficult. We conclude, therefore, that sampling approaches, which are much easier to implement, are also theoretically favorable for most real-life applications, in particular since these primarily concern long-range interactions in very large RNA molecules.","Backofen, Rolf; Fricke, Markus; Marz, Manja; Qin, Jing; Stadler, Peter F.",,127,23

Due to the lack of drugs against COVID-19, the disease spreads rapidly and the mortality rate is relatively high. Therefore, specific drugs against 2019-nCoV need to be quickly screened. The antimalarial drug chloroquine phosphate which has already been approved is confirmed to have an anti-2019-nCoV effect and has been included in diagnostic and therapeutic guidelines. However, awareness of the risk of chloroquine phosphate causing acute poisoning or even death should be strengthened. The current dosage recommended in clinical treatment is larger than that in previous treatment of malaria and the period of treatment is longer.

In children, the clinical symptoms of human metapneumovirus are similar to those produced by respiratory syncytial virus, ranging from mild to severe diseases such as bronchiolitis and pneumonia. The aim of the present study was to describe the prevalence of human metapneumovirus and other common respiratory viruses among admitted to hospital infants. From January 2006 to June 2006, 99 nasopharyngeal aspirates were collected from hospitalized children younger than 12 months in order to study respiratory viruses. Human metapneumovirus detection was performed by cell culture and two RT‐PCR targeting on polymerase and fusion genes. The latter gene was used for phylogenetic analysis. In 67/99 children (67%) at least one viral pathogen was identified, the viruses detected most frequently were respiratory syncytial virus (35%), human metapneumovirus (25%) and rhinovirus (19%). The results obtained in this study, show that: (1) human metapneumovirus is one of the most important viruses among children less than 12 months; (2) children infected with human metapneumovirus were significantly older than those infected by respiratory syncytial virus; (3) human metapneumovirus was associated more frequently with pneumonia whereas respiratory syncytial virus was only detected in patients with bronchiolitis; (4) there was a clear epidemiological succession pattern with only a small overlap among the viruses detected most frequently; (5) all human metapneumovirus samples were clustered within sublineage A2.

The AgNP-Serum-18 when prepared from silver nitrate, using dextrose as reducing and group-matched homologous serum as a stabilizing agent, selective endocytosis, and oxidative stress-dependent bio-functional damages to the host are mostly eliminated. For their bio-mimicking outer coat, there is the least possibility of internalization into host cells or liberation of excess oxidants in circulation following interaction with erythrocytes or vascular endothelial cells. The presence of infection-specific antibodies in the serum can make such nano-conjugates more selective. A potent antimicrobial action and a wide margin of safety for mammalian cells in comparison with very similar PVA-capped silver nanoparticles have been demonstrated by the in-vitro challenge of such nanoparticles on different microbes, human liver cell-line, and in-vivo study on mice model.

A computational approach was adopted to identify multiepitope vaccine candidates against SARS-CoV-2 based on S, N and M proteins being able to elicit both humoral and cellular immune responses. In this study, the sequence of the virus was obtained from NCBI database and analyzed with in silico tools such as NetMHCpan, IEDB, BepiPred, NetCTL, Tap transport/proteasomal cleavage, Pa(3)P, GalexyPepDock, I-TASSER, Ellipro and ClusPro. To identify the most immunodominant regions, after analysis of population coverage and epitope conservancy, we proposed three different constructs based on linear B-cell, CTL and HTL epitopes. The 3D structure of constructs was assessed to find discontinuous B-cell epitopes. Among CTL predicted epitopes, S(257-265), S(603-611) and S(360-368), and among HTL predicted epitopes, N(167-181), S(313-330) and S(1110-1126) had better MHC binding rank. We found one putative CTL epitope, S(360-368) related to receptor-binding domain (RBD) region for S protein. The predicted epitopes were non-allergen and showed a high quality of proteasomal cleavage and Tap transport efficiency and 100% conservancy within four different clades of SARS-CoV-2. For CTL and HTL epitopes, the highest population coverage of the world’s population was calculated for S(27-37) with 86.27% and for S(196-231), S(303-323), S(313-330), S(1009-1030) and N(328-349) with 90.33%, respectively. We identified overall 10 discontinuous B-cell epitopes for three multiepitope constructs. All three constructs showed strong interactions with TLRs 2, 3 and 4 supporting the hypothesis of SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility to TLRs 2, 3 and 4 like other Coronaviridae families. These data demonstrated that the novel designed multiepitope constructs can contribute to develop SARS-CoV-2 peptide vaccine candidates. The in vivo studies are underway using several vaccination strategies.","Khairkhah, Niloofar; Aghasadeghi, Mohammad Reza; Namvar, Ali; Bolhassani, Azam",PLoS One,127,10

METHODS: During October 26, 2009, and January 23, 2010, adult patients with pneumonia with laboratory-confirmed or clinically suspected A(H1N1) infections were observed for clinical characteristics, high-resolution chest CT scan, and lung function test changes during acute and 3-month convalescent phases. RESULTS: Of the 65 case subjects, the median age was 41 (interquartile range [IQR], 28-57) years, 60.0% were men, and 55.4% had at least one underlying medical condition. Sixty-two patients started oseltamivir therapy within a median of 5 (IQR, 4-6) days from the onset of illness, and 31 received IV corticosteroids. ARDS developed in 33 patients, and 24 were treated initially with noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV). In this group, NPPV was successful in 13 patients (54.2%). Nine patients died at a median of 16 (IQR, 10-24) days after onset of illness. Multivariate Cox regression identified two independent risk factors for death: progressive dyspnea after resolution of fever (relative risk, 5.852; 95% CI, 1.395-24.541; P = .016) and a higher APACHE (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation) II score on presentation (relative risk for each point, 1.312; 95% CI, 1.140-1.511; P < .001). At 3-month follow-up of survivors with A(H1N1), ground-glass opacities were still present, although diminished, in 85.7%, and diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide was mildly reduced in 61.5%.

Urine samples were collected in November 1992 (S1) and 4 months later in February 1993 (S4). A total of 246 children aged 6–12 months attending 29 day-care centers from 1 November to 28 February were screened for the excretion of CMV in urine. The diagnosis of viral acute respiratory infection was performed in the case of outbreaks only. Forty-eight (19.5%) children were both S1 and S4 positive for CMV, 30 (12.4%) became CMV positive (S1–/S4+), 4 (1.6%) became negative (S1+/S4–) and 164 (66.7%) remained negative. The percentage of children becoming CMV positive was significantly (P<0.001) higher in day-care centers where more than 40 children were enrolled. Nine outbreaks due to respiratory syncytial virus, rhinovirus and enterovirus were recorded in 8 of 29 (27.6%) day-care centers. Viral acute respiratory infections were significantly (P<0.05) more frequently recorded in day-care centers in which CMV and respiratory viruses cocirculated and were significantly (P<0.001) more frequently reported in CMV-infected children. These findings suggest that viral acute respiratory infections are significantly more likely to occur in CMV-infected children.","Chomel, J.-J.; Allard, J.-P.; Floret, D.; Honegger, D.; David, L.; Lina, B.; Aymard, M.",Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis,127,1

COVID-19 research and media reports have revealed a rise in fears related to contracting the virus. Though fear is a common psychological outcome during pandemics, the COVID-19 pandemic is a continuously evolving disease outbreak and has unique risk factors. Therefore, fear related to COVID-19 might manifest in not only fear and anxiety related to disease contraction and dying but also associated socio-occupational stress. We attempt to understand the psychosocial process of the development of coronaphobia and postulate what constitutes coronaphobia, a new emerging phobia specific to COVID-19. We present a conceptual model delineating the risk factors causing coronaphobia and the underlying mechanisms, for a better understanding of its developmental process. From review of relevant research, the factors identified are, an unforeseen reality, unending uncertainties, need of acquiring new practices and avoidance behavior, loss of faith in health infrastructure, contraction of COVID-19 by head of states, cautionary statements from international bodies, and infodemia. These factors are assumed to cause interference with routine life, catastrophizing interpretation of benign symptoms, and social amplification of risk which lead to coronaphobia. The conceptualization of coronaphobia and the model will aid future research in developing psychometric measure of coronaphobia for use in clinical and research settings and design of policies and interventions for mitigating risk factors.","Arora, Alisha; Jha, Amrit Kumar; Alat, Priya; Das, Sitanshu Sekhar",Asian J Psychiatr,127,1

A. albopictus might continue migrating north with continuing climate change and CHIKV would then no longer be confined to the developing nations. No treatment or licensed CHIKV vaccine exists. A CHIKV neutralization assay in a 384-well format by using CHIKV-pseudotyped lentiviral vectors was established. This assay system can be used for entry inhibitor screening under a reduced safety level (S2). Production of CHIKV-pseudotyped lentiviral vectors and the reaction volume are optimized. A dose dependent, specific neutralization of CHIKV-pseudotyped vectors with sera of CHIKV-infected individuals could be measured in a 384-well format.

To estimate the impact of the declaration on regional cities with low numbers of COVID-19 cases, large-scale surveillance to capture the current epidemiological situation of COVID-19 was urgently conducted in this study. DESIGN: Cohort study. SETTING: Social networking service (SNS)-based online survey conducted in five prefectures of Japan: Tottori, Kagawa, Shimane, Tokushima and Okayama. PARTICIPANTS: 127 121 participants from the five prefectures surveyed between 24 March and 5 May 2020. INTERVENTIONS: An SNS-based healthcare system named COOPERA (COvid-19: Operation for Personalized Empowerment to Render smart prevention And care seeking) was launched. It asks questions regarding postcode, personal information, preventive actions, and current and past symptoms related to COVID-19. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Empirical Bayes estimates of age-sex-standardised incidence rate (EBSIR) of symptoms and the spatial correlation between the number of those who reported having symptoms and the number of COVID-19 cases were examined to identify the geographical distribution of symptoms in the five prefectures. RESULTS: 97.8% of participants had no subjective symptoms. We identified several geographical clusters of fever with significant spatial correlation (r=0.67) with the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases, especially in the urban centres of prefectural capital cities. CONCLUSIONS: Given that there are still several high-risk areas measured by EBSIR, careful discussion on which areas should be reopened at the end of the state of emergency is urgently required using real-time SNS system to monitor the nationwide epidemic.","Yoneoka, Daisuke; Shi, Shoi; Nomura, Shuhei; Tanoue, Yuta; Kawashima, Takayuki; Eguchi, Akifumi; Matsuura, Kentaro; Makiyama, Koji; Uryu, Shinya; Ejima, Keisuke; Sakamoto, Haruka; Taniguchi, Toshibumi; Kunishima, Hiroyuki; Gilmour, Stuart; Nishiura, Hiroshi; Miyata, Hiroaki",BMJ Open,127,28

Moreover, it was checked whether the stress response to the epidemic in the T1DM group differed from that in the control group. This is the first study to address these questions in the type 1 diabetes population in Poland. METHODS: An e-mail was sent to all T1DM patients under the care of a diabetes clinic with information about the possibility of online consultation with a psychologist / psychiatrist, with a set of psychological tests attached. The study included 49 patients with T1DM who responded within the first month and agreed to participate in the study. 38 people from the control group were randomly recruited. Each person completed a set of psychological tools. RESULTS: In both groups, the level of stress was higher than typical for the general population in the situation without stressor. T1DM patients who have been ill for over 10 years more often cope with stress through a task-oriented approach. Patients who have been ill for less than 10 years use avoidance strategies. In the first phase of the epidemic,women with T1DM used avoidance strategies. Patients with diabetes and mental disorders react more anxiously and thus require special care in coping with diabetes. CONCLUSIONS: In a situation of stress such as a epidemic, patients suffering from T1DM require optimization of treatment and cooperation of specialists in the field of diabetes and psychology / psychiatry.","Cyranka, Katarzyna; Matejko, Bartlomiej; Klupa, Tomasz; Malecki, Maciej; Cyganek, Katarzyna; Kiec-Wilk, Beata; Dudek, Dominika",Psychiatr Pol,127,27

In this study, we develop a method for detecting bone marrow edema by magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of the sacroiliac joints and a deep-learning network. A total of 815 MR images of the sacroiliac joints were obtained from 60 patients diagnosed with axSpA and 19 healthy subjects. Gadolinium-enhanced fat-suppressed T1-weighted oblique coronal images were used for deep learning. Active sacroiliitis was defined as bone marrow edema, and the following processes were performed: setting the region of interest (ROI) and normalizing it to a size suitable for input to a deep-learning network, determining bone marrow edema using a convolutional-neural-network-based deep-learning network for individual MR images, and determining sacroiliac arthritis in subject examinations based on the classification results of individual MR images. About 70% of the patients and normal subjects were randomly selected for the training dataset, and the remaining 30% formed the test dataset. This process was repeated five times to calculate the average classification rate of the five-fold sets. The gradient-weighted class activation mapping method was used to validate the classification results. In the performance analysis of the ResNet18-based classification network for individual MR images, use of the ROI showed excellent detection performance of bone marrow edema with 93.55 ± 2.19% accuracy, 92.87 ± 1.27% recall, and 94.69 ± 3.03% precision. The overall performance was additionally improved using a median filter to reflect the context information. Finally, active sacroiliitis was diagnosed in individual subjects with 96.06 ± 2.83% accuracy, 100% recall, and 94.84 ± 3.73% precision. This is a pilot study to diagnose bone marrow edema by deep learning based on MR images, and the results suggest that MR analysis using deep learning can be a useful complementary means for clinicians to diagnose bone marrow edema.","Lee, Kang Hee; Choi, Sang Tae; Lee, Guen Young; Ha, You Jung; Choi, Sang-Il",Diagnostics (Basel),127,16

METHODS: We conducted a randomized controlled trial at a university outpatient clinic of obstetric and gynecology patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. Women were randomly assigned to the intervention group, who was prescribed a mobile meditation app for 30 days, or the control group, which received standard care. The primary outcome was self-reported perceived stress. Secondary outcomes included self-reported depression, anxiety, sleep disturbance, and satisfaction with the meditation app. A sample size of 80 participants (40 per group) was calculated to achieve 84% power to detect a 3-point difference in the primary outcome. RESULTS: From April to May 2020, 101 women were randomized in the study—50 in the meditation app group and 51 in the control group. Analysis was by intention-to-treat. Most characteristics were similar between groups. Perceived stress was significantly less in the intervention group at days 14 and 30 (mean difference 4.27, 95% CI 1.30–7.24, P=.005, d=0.69 and mean difference 4.28, 95% CI 1.68–6.88, P=.002, d=0.69, respectively).

The recent COVID‐19 pandemic highlighted the need for practical guidelines to facilitate building a SoC in online medical preclerkship education in the Netherlands. Therefore, this qualitative study aims to (a) examine perceptions of SoC from both students’ and teachers’ perspectives in an online elective course during the COVID‐19 pandemic in order to (b) provide a conceptual framework with practical guidelines to medical educators on how to build SoC in online education. METHODS: The study had an exploratory qualitative design. Semi‐structured focus groups with student (n = 15) and teacher (n = 5) volunteers were conducted. Participants discussed their experienced SoC using the storyline method. In addition, course developers (n = 2) were interviewed and lecturers (n = 5) wrote an experience story. Audio‐ and video‐recordings were transcribed verbatim and both the ensuing transcripts and experience stories were analysed using an inductive thematic analysis. RESULTS: All students experienced an increase of SoC during the eight‐week course. Five themes were identified: ‘social contacts made possible by a physical campus’, ‘group dynamics’, ‘teacher influence’, ‘education format’ and ‘teachers’ Sense of Community’. The authors formulated challenges and practical guidelines on how to build SoC based on these themes. CONCLUSIONS: This exploratory qualitative study provides a conceptual framework with practical guidelines for medical educators on how to build SoC in online medical preclerkship education. These guidelines provide a valuable starting point to build SoC in online education for medical educators and students alike.","van der Meer, Gerben H.; Milota, Megan; de Jonge, Rosalein R.; Jansen, Renée S.",Med Educ,127,20

DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: The Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam. PARTICIPANTS: Community‐dwelling older adults aged 65 and older (n = 1,427). MEASUREMENTS: Frailty was measured with the frailty phenotype (Fried criteria). Loneliness was assessed with the De Jong Gierveld Loneliness Scale. Social isolation was operationalized using information on partner status, social support, and network size. Two categorical variables were created, for each possible combination regarding frailty and loneliness (FL) and frailty and social isolation (FS), respectively. Mortality was monitored over a period of 22 years (1995–2017). Survival curves and Cox proportional hazard models were used to study the effects of the FL and FS combinations on mortality. Analyses were adjusted for sociodemographic factors, depression, chronic diseases, and smoking. RESULTS: Frailty prevalence was 13%, and 5.9% of the sample were frail and lonely, and 6.2% frail and socially isolated. In fully adjusted models, older adults who were only frail had a higher risk of mortality compared with people without any of the conditions (hazard ratio [HR] range = 1.40–1.48; P < .01). However, the highest risk of mortality was observed in people with a combined presence of frailty and loneliness or social isolation (HR(FL) = 1.83; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.42–2.37; HR(FS) = 1.77; 95% CI = 1.36–2.30). Sensitivity analyses using a frailty index based on the deficit accumulation approach instead of the frailty phenotype showed similar results, confirming the robustness of our findings. CONCLUSION: Frail older adults are at increased risk of mortality, but this risk is even higher for those who are also lonely or socially isolated. To optimize well‐being and health outcomes in physically frail older adults, targeted interventions focusing on both subjective and objective social vulnerability are needed.","Hoogendijk, Emiel O.; Smit, Annelot P.; van Dam, Carmen; Schuster, Noah A.; de Breij, Sascha; Holwerda, Tjalling J.; Huisman, Martijn; Dent, Elsa; Andrew, Melissa K.",J Am Geriatr Soc,127,1

METHODS: Kidney recipients with biopsy-proven cABMR were treated with allogeneic third-party BM-MSCs in this open-label, single-arm, single-center, two-dosing-regimen phase I/II clinical trial. In Regimen 1 (n=8), BM-MSCs were administered intravenously at a dose of 1.0×10(6) cells/kg monthly for four consecutive months, while in Regimen 2 (n=15), the BM-MSCs dose was 1.0×10(6) cells/kg weekly during four consecutive weeks. The primary endpoints were the absolute change of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) from baseline (delta eGFR) and the incidence of adverse events associated with BM-MSCs administration 24 months after the treatment. Contemporaneous cABMR patients who did not receive BM-MSCs were retrospectively analyzed as the control group (n =30). RESULTS: Twenty-three recipients with cABMR received BM-MSCs. The median delta eGFR of the total BM-MSCs treated patients was -4.3 ml/min per 1.73m(2) (interquartile range, IQR -11.2 to 1.2) 2 years after BM-MSCs treatment (P=0.0233). The median delta maximum donor-specific antibody (maxDSA) was -4310 (IQR -9187 to 1129) at 2 years (P=0.0040). The median delta eGFR of the control group was -12.7 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) (IQR -22.2 to -3.5) 2 years after the diagnosis, which was greater than that of the BM-MSCs treated group (P=0.0342). The incidence of hepatic enzyme elevation, BK polyomaviruses (BKV) infection, cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection was 17.4%, 17.4%, 8.7%, respectively. There was no fever, anaphylaxis, phlebitis or venous thrombosis, cardiovascular complications, or malignancy after BM-MSCs administration. Flow cytometry analysis showed a significant decreasing trend of CD27(-)IgD(-) double negative B cells subsets and trend towards the increase of CD3(+)CD4(+)PD-1(+)/lymphocyte population after MSCs therapy. Multiplex analysis found TNF-α, CXCL10, CCL4, CCL11 and RANTES decreased after MSCs treatment. CONCLUSION: Kidney allograft recipients with cABMR are tolerable to BM-MSCs. Immunosuppressive drugs combined with intravenous BM-MSCs can delay the deterioration of allograft function, probably by decreasing DSA level and reducing DSA-induced injury. The underlying mechanism may involve immunomodulatory effect of MSCs on peripheral B and T cells subsets.","Wei, Yongcheng; Chen, Xiaoyong; Zhang, Huanxi; Su, Qun; Peng, Yanwen; Fu, Qian; Li, Jun; Gao, Yifang; Li, Xirui; Yang, Shicong; Ye, Qianyu; Huang, Huiting; Deng, Ronghai; Li, Gang; Xu, Bowen; Wu, Chenglin; Wang, Jiali; Zhang, Xiaoran; Su, Xiaojun; Liu, Longshan; Xiang, Andy Peng; Wang, Changxi",Front Immunol,127,12

This study investigates the frequency of viral persistence after acute asthma, assesses viral infectivity and determines the host inflammatory responses to viral persistence. Methods: Adults and children presenting to hospital with acute asthma and a confirmed respiratory virus infection were studied acutely and at recovery 4–6 weeks later by clinical evaluation and induced sputum for viral and inflammatory mediator detection. Results: Viral RNA was detected during both acute asthma and recovery visits in 17 subjects (viral persistence), whereas in 22 subjects viral RNA had cleared by recovery (viral clearance). The following viruses were detected at recovery: human rhinovirus: 16; respiratory syncytial virus: 2; influenza: 2. In subjects with viral persistence, eight isolates were different to the virus detected at Visit 1. Forty‐four per cent of the human rhinovirus isolates were infective at recovery. Asthma and infection severity were similar in the viral clearance and viral persistence groups. Viral persistence was associated with elevated IL‐10 mRNA and inducible protein‐10 gene expression. Conclusions: Respiratory viral detection after acute asthma is common, and most often persistence is with non‐infective human rhinovirus.

A key problem for implementing quarantine measure is to determine the duration of the quarantine. Different from the existing methods that determine a constant quarantine duration for everyone, we develop an individualized quarantine rule that suggests different quarantine durations for individuals with different characteristics. The proposed quarantine rule is optimal in the sense that it minimizes the average quarantine duration of uninfected people with the constraint that the probability of symptom presentation for infected people attains the given value closing to 1. The optimal solution for the quarantine duration is obtained and estimated by some statistical methods with application to analyzing COVID‐19 data.","Wang, Ruoyu; Wang, Qihua",Biometrics,127,1

In order to develop safe and effective vaccines, suitable animal models must be established. Here we report the rapid adaption of SARS-CoV-2 in BALB/c mice, based on which a convenient, economical and effective animal model was developed. Specifically, we found that mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 at passage 6 (MACSp6) efficiently infected both aged and young wild-type BALB/c mice, resulting in moderate pneumonia as well as inflammatory responses. The elevated infectivity of MACSp6 in mice could be attributed to the substitution of a key residue (N501Y) in the receptorbinding domain (RBD). Using this novel animal model, we further evaluated the in vivo protective efficacy of an RBD-based SARS-CoV-2 subunit vaccine, which elicited highly potent neutralizing antibodies and conferred full protection against SARS-CoV-2 MACSp6 challenge. This novel mouse model is convenient and effective in evaluating the in vivo protective efficacy of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine.

Failure to consider an eating disorder diagnosis in youth who present with extreme weight loss may have serious immediate and long term implications. However, failure to consider other non-organic causes of weight loss may be equally detrimental to the child’s health. CASE PRESENTATION: This case reports on the acute presentation of a 12-year old boy, who presented to hospital in a severely malnourished state eight weeks into lockdown. To compensate for Covid-19 induced restrictions on sporting activity, this boy had followed a self-imposed daily schedule of arduous exercise, without increasing his nutritional intake. This report examines the clinical features suggestive of AN and other differential diagnosis. A discussion on the specific diagnostic differential of exercise addiction and challenges faced by youth during Covid-19 restrictions are presented. CONCLUSION: Accepting that AN may present atypically in pre-pubertal youth, it is important that clinicians maintain an open mind in youth presenting without goal directed weight loss. Although weight loss was significant in this case, it was due to an excessive exercise regime. This may have commenced as a coping strategy in response to Covid-19 restrictions but subsequently became excessive and impairing in nature. The collateral damage of Covid-19 mandated restrictions, aimed at containing the spread of the virus, are evident in this case. Clinicians need to be alert to potentially maladaptive coping strategies and unusual or altered pathways of presentation, especially in younger children during these challenging times.","McNicholas, F.",J Eat Disord,127,1

That action should be at the educational, ethical, economic and political level. An important first step would be to increase public awareness and willingness to take the necessary measures to curb resistance. Hence, studies are needed that would provide solid, quantitative data on the societal impact of antibiotic resistance.

The LIGRADIS trial aims to provide evidence either to support or refute the systematic use of LS in euthyroid patients undergoing thyroidectomy for GD. METHODS: A multicenter randomized controlled trial will be performed. Patients ≥18 years of age, diagnosed with GD, treated with antithyroid drugs, euthyroid and proposed for total thyroidectomy will be eligible for inclusion. Exclusion criteria will be prior thyroid or parathyroid surgery, hyperparathyroidism that requires associated parathyroidectomy, thyroid cancer that requires adding a lymph node dissection, iodine allergy, consumption of lithium or amiodarone, medically unfit patients (ASA-IV), breastfeeding women, preoperative vocal cord palsy and planned endoscopic, video-assisted or remote access surgery. Between January 2020 and January 2022, 270 patients will be randomized for either receiving or not preoperative preparation with LS. Researchers will be blinded to treatment assignment. The primary outcome will be the rate of postoperative complications: hypoparathyroidism, recurrent laryngeal nerve injury, hematoma, surgical site infection or death. Secondary outcomes will be intraoperative events (Thyroidectomy Difficulty Scale score, blood loss, recurrent laryngeal nerve neuromonitoring signal loss), operative time, postoperative length of stay, hospital readmissions, permanent complications and adverse events associated to LS. CONCLUSIONS: There is no conclusive evidence supporting the benefits of preoperative treatment with LS in this setting. This trial aims to provide new insights into future Clinical Practice Guidelines recommendations.

The current systematic review aimed to explore the research question: what are the characteristics of effective digital teaching resources when the aim of the resource is to build student connectedness? This systematic literature review was conducted in line with published guidance for undertaking reviews (Centre for Reviews and Dissemination, 2009). Successively, 17 papers met the inclusion criteria and were analysed using a thematic synthesis approach. Results identified five key themes that are important when designing digital resources to build connectedness: usability; teacher interaction; immediacy; synchronicity; and community.

Although increasing evidence points to T cell immunity playing a critical role in vaccination against viral diseases, vaccine efficacy is mostly associated with the induction of antibody responses. Here we analyze the immunological mechanism(s) of rapidly protective vaccinia virus immunization using mousepox as surrogate model for human smallpox. We found that fast protection against lethal systemic poxvirus disease solely depended on CD4 and CD8 T cell responses induced by vaccination with highly attenuated modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) or conventional vaccinia virus. Of note, CD4 T cells were critically required to allow for MVA induced CD8 T cell expansion and perforin-mediated cytotoxicity was a key mechanism of MVA induced protection. In contrast, selected components of the innate immune system and B cell-mediated responses were fully dispensable for prevention of fatal disease by immunization given two days before challenge. In conclusion, our data clearly demonstrate that perforin-dependent CD8 T cell immunity plays a key role in MVA conferred short term protection against lethal mousepox. Rapid induction of T cell immunity might serve as a new paradigm for treatments that need to fit into a scenario of protective emergency vaccination.","Kremer, Melanie; Suezer, Yasemin; Volz, Asisa; Frenz, Theresa; Majzoub, Monir; Hanschmann, Kay-Martin; Lehmann, Michael H.; Kalinke, Ulrich; Sutter, Gerd",PLoS Pathog,127,1

But Martin Peterson (JME 33: 5–10, 2007; The ethics of technology: A geometric analysis of five moral principles, Oxford University Press, Oxford, 2017) has argued that the principle is better understood as an epistemic rule, guiding decision-makers in forming beliefs rather than choosing among possible acts. On the epistemic view, he claims there is a principle concerning expert disagreement underlying precautionary-based reasoning called the ecumenical principle: all expert views should be considered in a precautionary appraisal, not just those that are the most prominent or influential. In articulating the doxastic commitments of decision-makers under this constraint, Peterson precludes any probabilistic rule that might result in combining expert opinions. For combined or consensus probabilities are likely to provide decision-makers with information that is more precise than warranted. Contra Peterson, I argue that upon adopting a broader conception of probability, there is a probabilistic rule, under which expert opinions are combined, that is immune to his criticism and better represents the ecumenical principle.","Elkin, Lee",Erkenntnis,127,16

Closely related to Anchomanes, Pseudohydrosme is distinct from Anchomanes because of its 2-3-locular ovary (vs. unilocular), peduncle concealed by cataphylls at anthesis and far shorter than the spathe (vs. exposed, far exceeding the spathe), stipitate fruits and viviparous (asexually reproductive) roots (vs. sessile, roots non-viviparous), lack of laticifers (vs. laticifers present) and differences in spadix: spathe proportions and presentation. However, it is possible that a well sampled molecular phylogenetic analysis might show that one of these genera is nested inside the other. In this case the synonymisation of Pseudohydrosme will be required. Three species, one new to science, are recognised, in two sections. Although doubt has previously been cast on the value of recognising Pseudohydrosme buettneri, of Gabon, it is here accepted and maintained as a distinct species in the monotypic section, Zyganthera. However, it is considered to be probably globally extinct. Pseudohydrosme gabunensis, type species of the genus, also Gabonese but probably extending to Congo, is maintained in Sect.

The discovery of Pseudohydrosme ebo resulted from a series of surveys for conservation management in Cameroon, and triggered this article. All three species are morphologically characterised, their habitat and biogeography discussed, and their extinction risks are respectively assessed as Critically Endangered (Possibly Extinct), Endangered and Critically Endangered using the IUCN standard. Clearance of forest habitat for logging, followed by agriculture or urbanisation are major threats.

AIMS: This study aimed to investigate the impact of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic on the utilization of health and rehabilitation services and the general health and physical status of children with CP. In addition, the second aim of the study was to examine the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on caregivers’ quality of life (QOL) and their fear of COVID-19. METHODS: The utilization of children health and rehabilitation services during the pandemic, the general health and physical status of the children during the pandemic, and the children and caregivers’ history of COVID-19 infections were questioned. Furthermore, the caregivers’ level of fear of COVID-19 and their QOL were examined. RESULTS: One hundred twenty caregivers were contacted by phone, and 94 (78.33%) caregivers agreed to participate in the study. Sixty-three of 94 children (67.1%) did not attend their routine control check-up during the pandemic. Twelve children (12.8%) discontinued their physical therapy sessions during the pandemic. Caregivers physical and mental QOL significantly decreased during the pandemic (p < 0.05). The median of caregivers’ Fear of COVID-19 scale (FCV-19S) was 17.5 (7–35).

The mechanisms behind this association remain elusive. Methods: We evaluated the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 viremia, disease outcome, inflammatory and proteomic profiles in a cohort of COVID-19 emergency department participants. SARS-CoV-2 viral load was measured using qRT-PCR based platform. Proteomic data were generated with Proximity Extension Assay (PEA) using the Olink platform. Results: Three hundred participants with nucleic acid test-confirmed COVID-19 were included in this study. Levels of plasma SARS-CoV-2 viremia at the time of presentation predicted adverse disease outcomes, with an adjusted odds ratio (aOR) of 10.6 (95% confidence interval [CI] 4.4, 25.5, P<0.001) for severe disease (mechanical ventilation and/or 28-day mortality) and aOR of 3.9 (95%CI 1.5, 10.1, P=0.006) for 28-day mortality. Proteomic analyses revealed prominent proteomic pathways associated with SARS-CoV-2 viremia, including upregulation of SARS-CoV-2 entry factors (ACE2, CTSL, FURIN), heightened markers of tissue damage to the lungs, gastrointestinal tract, endothelium/vasculature and alterations in coagulation pathways. Conclusions: These results highlight the cascade of vascular and tissue damage associated with SARS-CoV-2 plasma viremia that underlies its ability to predict COVID-19 disease outcomes.","Li, Y.; Schneider, A.

Only a minority of dermatology practices has integrated teledermatology into their practice prior to COVID-19. A thorough understanding of the barriers and facilitators may promote teledermatology adoption. Implementation science frameworks offer theoretically driven ways to assess factors affecting teledermatology implementation. This review uses a comprehensive implementation science framework to summarize barriers and facilitators of teledermatology implementation and appraises the quality of existing research. RECENT FINDINGS: Technological characteristics of teledermatology (e.g., user-friendliness) and factors within the outer setting (e.g., reimbursement and legal considerations) were the most commonly reported barriers. No existing studies use a comprehensive implementation framework to identify factors influencing teledermatology implementation. Many included studies have a risk of bias in at least two of the five study quality indices evaluated. SUMMARY: This systematic review is the first study to summarize the existing teledermatology implementation literature into well-defined constructs from a comprehensive implementation science framework.

In this context, it was necessary to understand the psychological reactions of patients with chronic diseases. We evaluated the psychological effects on patients with chronic respiratory conditions and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) through the analysis of their spontaneous contacts with their referral centres. METHODS: Cross‐sectional study was conducted from February 23 to April 27, 2020 in patients, or their parents, who contacted their multidisciplinary teams (MDT). E‐mails and phone calls directed to the MDT of the centre for cystic fibrosis (CF) in Milano and for paediatric IBD in Bergamo, were categorised according to their contents as information on routine disease management, updates on the patient's health status, COVID‐19 news monitoring, empathy towards health professionals, positive feedback and concern of contagion during the emergency. RESULTS: One thousand eight hundred and sixteen contacts were collected during the study period. In Milano, where the majority of patients were affected by CF, 88.7% contacted health professionals by e‐mail, with paediatricians receiving the largest volume of emails and phone calls compared with other professionals (P< .001). Compared with Milano, the centre for IBD in Bergamo recorded more expression of empathy towards health professionals and thanks for their activity in the COVID‐19 emergency (52.4% vs 12.7%, P< .001), as well as positive feedback (64.3% vs 2.7%, P = .003). CONCLUSION: One of the most important lessons we can learn from COVID‐19 is that it is not the trauma itself that can cause psychological consequences but rather the level of balance, or imbalance, between fragility and resources. To feel safe, people need to be able to count on the help of those who represent a bulwark against the threat. This is the role played, even remotely, by health professionals.","Nobili, Rita Maria; Gambazza, Simone; Spada, Maria Simonetta; Tutino, Anna Luisa; Bulfamante, Anna Marta; Mariani, Alessandra; Brivio, Anna; Moioli, Loredana; Rizzato, Erika; Sansotta, Naire; Claut, Laura; Faelli, Nadia; Norsa, Lorenzo; Colombo, Carla",Int J Clin Pract,127,27

The B.1.1.28 lineage has been evolving in Brazil since February 2020 and originated the P.1 variant of concern (VOC), recently named as the Gamma variant by the newly WHO nomenclature proposal, and P.2 as a variant of interest (VOI). Here we describe an early case of P.1 primary infection in Southern Brazil in late November 2020, soon after the emergence of the variant in Manaus, Northern Brazil. The same male patient was reinfected by another B.1.1.28 variant, namely P.2, in March, 2021. The genomic analysis confirmed genetically significant differences between the two viruses recovered in both infections, the P.1 lineage in the first episode and P.2 in the reinfection. Due the very early detection of P.1, we have also investigated the circulation of P.1 in the same region by differential RT-qPCR, showing that this was an isolated case of P.1 at the time of detection, and this variant has disseminated and became prominent from late January to the end of March, 2021.

In newborn calves flavonoids may improve health status, but little is known about the systemically availability of flavonoids in calves to exert biological effects. The aim of this study was to investigate the oral bioavailability of the flavonol quercetin, applied either as quercetin aglycone (QA) or as its glucorhamnoside rutin (RU), in newborn dairy calves. Twenty-one male newborn German Holstein calves were fed equal amounts of colostrum and milk replacer according to body weight. On d 2 and 29 of life, 9 mg of quercetin equivalents/kg of body weight, either fed as QA or as RU, or no quercetin (control group) were fed together with the morning meal. Blood samples were taken before and 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 5, 6, 12, 24, and 48 h after feed intake. Quercetin and quercetin metabolites with an intact flavonol structure (isorhamnetin, tamarixetin, and kaempferol) were analyzed in blood plasma after treatment with glucuronidase or sulfatase by HPLC with fluorescence detection. Maximum individual plasma concentration was depicted from the concentration-time-curve on d 2 and 29, respectively. Additional blood samples were taken to measure basal plasma concentrations of total protein, albumin, urea, and lactate as well as pre- and postprandial plasma concentrations of glucose, nonesterified fatty acids, insulin, and cortisol. Plasma concentrations of quercetin and its metabolites were significantly higher on d 2 than on d 29 of life, and administration of QA resulted in higher plasma concentrations of quercetin and its metabolites than RU. The relative bioavailability of total flavonols (sum of quercetin and its metabolites isorhamnetin, tamarixetin, and kaempferol) from RU was 72.5% on d 2 and 49.6% on d 29 when compared with QA (100%). Calves fed QA reached maximum plasma concentrations of total flavonols much earlier than did RU-fed calves. Plasma metabolites and hormones were barely affected by QA and RU feeding in this experiment. Taken together, orally administrated QA resulted in a greater bioavailability of quercetin than RU on d 2 and 29, respectively, and quercetin bioavailability of quercetin and its metabolites differed markedly between calves aged 2 and 29 d.","Maciej, J.; Schäff, C.T.; Kanitz, E.; Tuchscherer, A.; Bruckmaier, R.M.; Wolffram, S.; Hammon, H.M.",J Dairy Sci,127,1

The use of allosteric modulators in therapy offers several advantages with respect to orthosteric ones, as they can fine-tune the tissue responses to the endogenous agonist. Since the discovery of the first A(1) adenosine receptor (AR) allosteric modulator in 1990, several efforts have been made to develop more potent molecules as well as allosteric modulators for all adenosine receptor subtypes. There are four subtypes of AR: A(1), A(2A), A(2B), and A(3). Positive allosteric modulators of the A(1) AR have been proposed for the cure of pain. A(3) positive allosteric modulators are thought to be beneficial during inflammatory processes. More recently, A(2A) and A(2B) AR allosteric modulators have also been disclosed. The A(2B) AR displays the lowest affinity for its endogenous ligand adenosine and is mainly activated as a consequence of tissue damage. The A(2B) AR activation has been found to play a crucial role in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, in the protection of the heart from ischemic injury, and in the process of bone formation. In this context, allosteric modulators of the A(2B) AR may represent pharmacological tools useful to develop new therapeutic agents. Herein, we provide an up-to-date highlight of the recent findings and future perspectives in the field of orthosteric and allosteric A(2B) AR ligands. Furthermore, we compare the use of orthosteric ligands with positive and negative allosteric modulators for the management of different pathological conditions.","Barresi, Elisabetta; Martini, Claudia; Da Settimo, Federico; Greco, Giovanni; Taliani, Sabrina; Giacomelli, Chiara; Trincavelli, Maria Letizia",Front Pharmacol,127,0

While recent reports showed increased distress and depressive/anxiety state related to COVID-19 crisis, we investigated how home quarantine affected sleep parameters in healthy individuals. Methods 160 healthy individuals who were in home quarantine in April 2020 for at least one month participated in this study. Participants rated and compared their quantitative sleep parameters (time to go to bed, sleep duration, getting-up time) and sleep quality factors, pre-and during home quarantine due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, participants chronotype was determined to see if sleep parameters are differentially affected in different chronotypes. Results The time to fall asleep and get-up in the morning were significantly delayed in all participants, indicating a significant circadian misalignment. Sleep quality was reported to be significantly poorer in all participants and chronotypes, and included more daily disturbances (more sleep disturbances, higher daily dysfunctions due to low quality of sleep) and less perceived sleep quality (lower subjective sleep quality, longer time taken to fall asleep at night, more use of sleep medication for improving sleep quality) during home quarantine. Conclusions Home quarantine due to COVID-19 pandemic has a detrimental impact on sleep quality.

DESIGN: Cross-sectional study based on registry data from Brazil’s influenza surveillance system. SETTING: Public and private hospitals across Brazil. PARTICIPANTS: Eligible population included 21 942 inpatients aged ≥20 years with positive reverse transcription-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 until 9 June 2020. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Severe COVID-19 outcomes were non-invasive and invasive mechanical ventilation use, intensive care unit (ICU) admission and death. Multivariate analyses were conducted separately for adults (20–59 years) and elders (≥60 years) to test the combined association of obesity (without and with DM and/or CVD) and degrees of obesity with each outcome. RESULTS: A sample of 8848 adults and 12 925 elders were included. Among adults, obesity with DM and/or CVD showed higher prevalence of invasive (prevalence ratio 3.76, 95% CI 2.82 to 5.01) and non-invasive mechanical ventilation use (2.06, 1.58 to 2.69), ICU admission (1.60, 1.40 to 1.83) and death (1.79, 1.45 to 2.21) compared with the group without obesity, DM and CVD. In elders, obesity alone (without DM and CVD) had the highest prevalence of ICU admission (1.40, 1.07 to 1.82) and death (1.67, 1.00 to 2.80). In both age groups, obesity alone and combined with DM and/or CVD showed higher prevalence in all outcomes than DM and/or CVD. A dose–response association was observed between obesity and death in adults: class I 1.32 (1.05 to 1.66), class II 1.41 (1.06 to 1.87) and class III 1.77 (1.35 to 2.33). CONCLUSIONS: The combined association of obesity, diabetes and/or CVD with severe COVID-19 outcomes may be stronger in adults than in elders. Obesity alone and combined with DM and/or CVD had more impact on the risk of COVID-19 severity than DM and/or CVD in both age groups. The study also supports an independent relationship of obesity with severe outcomes, including a dose–response association between degrees of obesity and death in adults.","Silva, Natanael de Jesus; Ribeiro-Silva, Rita de Cássia; Ferreira, Andrêa Jacqueline Fortes; Teixeira, Camila Silveira Silva; Rocha, Aline Santos; Alves, Flávia Jôse Oliveira; Falcão, Ila Rocha; Pinto, Elizabete de Jesus; Santos, Carlos Antônio de Souza Teles; Fiaccone, Rosemeire Leovigildo; Ichihara, Maria Yury Travassos; Paixão, Enny S; Barreto, Mauricio L",BMJ Open,127,1

However, non-degradability and mismanagement of SFMs have raised serious environmental concerns. Moreover, both melt-blown and nanofiber-based mask filters inevitably suffer from poor filtration performance, like a continuous decrease in the removal efficiency for particulate matter (PM) and weak breathability. Herein, we report a new method to create biodegradable and reusable fibrous mask filters. The filter consists of a true nanoscale bio-based poly(lactic acid) (PLA) fiber (an average size of 37 ± 4 nm) that is fabricated via electrospinning of an extremely dilute solution. Furthermore, we designed a multiscale structure with integrated features, such as low basis weight (0.91 g m-2), small pore size (0.73 μm), and high porosity (91.72%), formed by electrospinning deposition of true nanoscale fibers on large pore of 3D scaffold nanofiber membranes. The resultant mask filter exhibited a high filtration efficiency (PM0.3-99.996%) and low pressure drop (104 Pa) superior to the commercial N95 filter. Importantly, this filter has a durable filtering efficiency for PM and natural biodegradability based on PLA. Therefore, this study offers an innovative strategy for the preparation of PLA nanofibers and provides a new design for high-performance nanofiber filters.","Wang, Ling; Gao, Yanfei; Xiong, Junpeng; Shao, Weili; Cui, Chen; Sun, Ning; Zhang, Yuting; Chang, Shuzhen; Han, Pengju; Liu, Fan; He, Jianxin",Journal of colloid and interface science,127,1

Ignored by most governments, excluded from social and economic measures put in place to protect other workers, sex workers were left to fend for themselves. The article, an abridged version of a previous report by the ICRSE, illustrates the impact of COVID-19 on sex workers by focusing on how the pandemic affected the socio-economic, health and safety conditions of sex worker communities and how they pro-actively responded to the first waves of the crisis in 2020. Based on data gathered through community research, the authors outline the specific ways in which sex workers living under different sex work legal regimes were hit by the crisis. Crucially, in countries such as France, Sweden and Ireland, where an 'End Demand' legislation is in place to supposedly 'rescue sex workers', these did not benefit from any state support. The article suggests that sex worker community organisations helped limit the spread of the virus through peer support and peer education, protecting not only sex workers' health, but society at large and showing similarities to the role of chaperones of public health sex workers had during the AIDS crisis.","Fedorkó, Boglárka; Stevenson, Luca; Macioti, P G",Glob Public Health,127,4

To decipher any correlation between SARS-CoV-2 evolution and its epidemiology in India, we studied the mutational diversity of spike glycoprotein, the key player for the attachment, fusion and entry of virus to the host cell. For this, we analyzed the sequences of 630 Indian isolates as available in GISAID database till June 07, 2020, and detected the spike protein variants to emerge from two major ancestors – Wuhan-Hu-1/2019 and its D614G variant. Average stability of the docked spike protein – host receptor (S-R) complexes for these variants correlated strongly (R2=0.96) with the fatality rates across Indian states. However, while more than half of the variants were found unique to India, 67% of all variants showed lower stability of S-R complex than the respective ancestral variants, indicating a possible fitness loss in recently emerged variants, despite a continuous increase in mutation rate. These results conform to the sharply declining fatality rate countrywide (>7-fold during April 11 – June 28, 2020). Altogether, while we propose the potential of S-R complex stability to track disease severity, we urge an immediate need to explore if SARS-CoV-2 is approaching mutational meltdown in India. Author summary Epidemiological features are intricately linked to evolutionary diversity of rapidly evolving pathogens, and SARS-CoV-2 is no exception. Our work suggests the potential of average stability of complexes formed by the circulating spike mutational variants and the human host receptor to track the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a given region. In India, the stability of these complexes for recent variants tend to decrease relative to their ancestral ones, following countrywide declining fatality rate, in contrast to an increasing mutation rate. We hypothesize such a scenario as nascent footprints of Muller’s ratchet, proposing large-scale population genomics study for its validation, since this understanding could lead to therapeutic approaches for facilitating mutational meltdown of SARS-CoV-2, as experienced earlier for influenza A virus.","Banerjee, Rachana; Basak, Kausik; Ghosh, Anamika; Rajachandran, Vyshakh; Sureka, Kamakshi; Ganguly, Debabani; Chattopadhyay, Sujay",bioRxiv,127,16

The aim of these 2 studies was to investigate the safety and efficacy of PrEP-001 prophylaxis against rhinovirus (HRV-A16) and influenza-A (H3N2-IAV). METHODS: Healthy subjects randomly received 2 doses of PrEP-001 or placebo, 48 and 24 h pre-challenge with 10 TCID(50) of HRV-A16 (Study 1) or H3N2-IAV (Study 2). RESULTS: In Study 1, PrEP-001 reduced median total symptom score from 38.5 to 4.5 (p = 0.004), median symptom duration from 6.0 to 1.7 days and median mucus production from 15 g to 3 g.

Current devices are typically reusable and require daily, or often more frequent, cleaning to prevent risk of infection by acting as reservoirs of potentially pathogenic organisms. In response, a daily disposable OPEP device, the UL-OPEP, was developed to mitigate the risk of contamination and eliminate the burdensome need for cleaning devices. METHODS: A convenience sample of 36 participants, all current OPEP device users, was recruited from a paediatric CF service. For one month, participants replaced their current OPEP device with a novel daily disposable device. Assessment included pre- and post-intervention lung function by spirometry, as well as Lung Clearance Index.

Lung function (mean difference ± SD, %FEV1 = 1.69 ± 11.93; %FVC = 0.58 ± 10.04; FEV1: FVC = 0.01 ± 0.09), LCI (mean difference ± SD, 0.08 ± 1.13), six-minute walk test, and CFQ-R were unchanged post-intervention. Participant-reported experiences of the device were predominantly positive. CONCLUSIONS: The disposable OPEP device maintained patients’ lung function during short term use (≤ 1 month), and was the subject of positive feedback regarding functionality while reducing the risk of airway contamination associated with ineffective cleaning.

While knowledge regarding epidemiologic features and diagnostic tools of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is rapidly evolving, uncertainties surrounding various aspects of its optimal management strategies persist. A subset of these patients develop a more severe form of the disease characterized by expanding pulmonary lesions, sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and respiratory failure. Due to lack of data on treatment strategies specific to this subset of patients, currently available evidence on management of the critically ill needs to be extrapolated and customized to their clinical needs. The article calls attention to fluid stewardship in the critically ill with COVID-19 by judiciously applying the evidence-based resuscitation principles to their specific clinical features such as high rates of cardiac injury. As we await more data from treating these patients, this strategy is likely to help reduce potential complications.","Kazory, Amir; Ronco, Claudio; McCullough, Peter A.",Proc (Bayl Univ Med Cent),127,1

Due to a lack of antiviral drugs, vaccines against the virus are urgently required. METHODS: In this study, validated computational approaches were used to identify peptide-based epitopes from six structural proteins having antigenic properties. The Net-CTL 1.2 tool was used for the prediction of CD8(+) T-cell epitopes, while the robust tools Bepi-Pred 2 and LBtope was employed for the identification of linear B-cell epitopes. Docking studies of the identified epitopes were performed using HADDOCK 2.4 and the structures were visualized by Discovery Studio and LigPlot(+). Antigenicity, immunogenicity, conservancy, population coverage and allergenicity of the predicted epitopes were determined by the bioinformatics tools like VaxiJen v2.0 server, the Immune Epitope Database tools and AllerTOP v.2.0, AllergenFP 1.0 and ElliPro. RESULTS: The predicted T cell and linear B-cell epitopes were considered as prime vaccine targets in case they passed the requisite parameters like antigenicity, immunogenicity, conservancy, non-allergenicity and broad range of population coverage. Among the predicted CD8+ T cell epitopes, potential vaccine targets from surface glycoprotein were; YQPYRVVVL, PYRVVVLSF, GVYFASTEK, QLTPTWRVY, and those from ORF3a protein were LKKRWQLAL, HVTFFIYNK. Similarly, RFLYIIKLI, LTWICLLQF from membrane protein and three epitopes viz; SPRWYFYYL, TWLTYTGAI, KTFPPTEPK from nucleocapsid phosphoprotein were the superior vaccine targets observed in our study. The negative values of HADDOCK and Z scores obtained for the best cluster indicated the potential of the epitopes as suitable vaccine candidates. Analysis of the 3D and 2D interaction diagrams of best cluster produced by HADDOCK 2.4 displayed the binding interaction of leading T cell epitopes within the MHC-1 peptide binding clefts. On the other hand, among linear B cell epitopes the majority of potential vaccine targets were from nucleocapsid protein, viz; (59−)HGKEDLKFPRGQGVPINTNSSPDDQIGYYRRATRRIRGGDGKMKDLS(−105), (227−)LNQLE SKMSGKGQQQQGQTVTKKSAAEASKKPRQKRTATK(−266), (3−)DNGPQNQRNAPRITFGGP(−20), (29−)GERSGARSKQRRPQGL(−45). Two other prime vaccine targets, (370−)NSASFSTFKCYGVSPTKLNDLCFTNV(−395) and (260−)AGAAAYYVGYLQPRT(−274) were identified in the spike protein. The potential B-cell conformational epitopes were predicted on the basis of a higher protrusion index indicating greater solvent accessibility. These conformational epitopes were of various lengths and belonged to spike, ORF3a, membrane and nucleocapsid proteins. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, eleven T cell epitopes, seven B cell linear epitopes and ten B cell conformational epitopes were identified from five structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2 using advanced computational tools. These potential vaccine candidates may provide important timely directives for an effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2.","Anand, Rajesh; Biswal, Subham; Bhatt, Renu; Tiwary, Bhupendra N.",PeerJ,127,33

Intravenous (IV) vitamin C administration may reduce the need for vasopressor support and the duration of mechanical ventilations in critically ill patients in hospital. COVID-19 has similar signs and symptoms of ARI. Further studies involving patients with COVID-19, either through administration of oral vitamin C in mild cases or IV vitamin C in critical cases, would be advantageous to examine if it is safe and efficacious. Verdict Oral vitamin C may assist with the symptoms of acute respiratory viral infections (ARI) and common cold-induced asthma but no studies have been identified justifying oral vitamin C for the prevention or treatment of coronavirus infections including COVID-19. When taken at onset of ARI, oral vitamin C may reduce the duration of symptoms including fever, chest pain, chills and bodily aches and pains. It may also reduce the incidence of hospital admission and duration of hospital stays. For individuals admitted to hospital with community-acquired pneumonia, vitamin C may improve respiratory function in more severe cases. No major adverse events nor interactions were reported by either method of administration. However, there is an absence of high quality, contemporary clinical research examining this topic. Current evidence suggests further studies are needed to better understand the value of both oral and IV vitamin C for ARI, including COVID-19.","Schloss, Janet; Lauche, Romy; Harnett, Joanne; Hannan, Nicole; Brown, Danielle; Greenfield, Tom; Steel, Amie",Adv Integr Med,127,30

The detection of SARS-CoV-2 is critical for preventing new outbreaks, curbing disease spread, and managing patients. Currently, a reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay is used to detect the virus in clinical laboratories. However, although this assay is considered to have high specificity, its sensitivity is reportedly as low as 60–70%. Improved sensitivity is, therefore, urgently required. METHODS: We used the primers and single-quencher probes recommended by the CDC (N1, N2 and N3) in the USA and the NIID (N1 and N2) in Japan. In addition, we designed double-quencher probes according to the virus sequence provided by the NIID to develop a further assay (termed the YCH assay [N1 and N2]). Using these assays, we conducted RT-PCR with serially diluted DNA positive controls to assess and compare the detection sensitivity of the three assays. Furthermore, 66 nasopharyngeal swabs were tested to determine the diagnostic performances. RESULTS: The threshold cycle (Ct) value of the RT-PCR was relatively low for the CDC and YCH assays compared with the NIID assay. Serial dilution assays showed that both the CDC and YCH assays could detect low copy numbers of the DNA positive control. The background fluorescence signal at the baseline was lower for the YCH assay compared with the NIID assay. We assessed the diagnostic performance between single- (NIID) and double-quencher (YCH) probes using 66 nasopharyngeal swabs. When the results of YCH-N2 assay were used as a reference, each assay detected SARS-CoV-2 with positive percent agreements of 56% for NIID-N1, 61% for YCH-N1, and 94% for NIID-N2, and 100% negative percent agreements for NIID-N1, YCH-N1 and NIID-N2. CONCLUSION: Double-quencher probes decreased the background fluorescence and improved the detection sensitivity of RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2.","Hirotsu, Yosuke; Mochizuki, Hitoshi; Omata, Masao",J Virol Methods,127,1

The French Society of Rheumatology (SFR) selected the most critical ones to the daily practice of a rheumatologist and a group of 10 experts from SFR and Club Rheumatism and Inflammation (CRI) boards proposed responses based on the current knowledge of May 2020. Basic procedure: Following the availability of the first 18 questions and statements, 1400 individuals consulted the frequently asked questions between the March 31, 2020 and April 12, 2020. As a result, 16 additional questions were forwarded to the SFR, and answered by the board. An additional round of review by email and video conference was organized, which included updates of the previous statements. The scientific relevance of 5 of the questions led to their inclusion in this document. Each response received a final assessment on a scale of 0–10 with 0 meaning no agreement whatsoever and 10 being in complete agreement. The mean values of these votes for each question are presented as the levels of agreement (LoA) at the end of each response. This document was last updated on April 17, 2020. Main findings: Based on current scientific literature already published, in most circumstances, there is no contraindication to the initiation or continuation of anti-inflammatory drugs as well as DMARDs. If signs suggestive of infection (coronavirus or other) occurs, treatments should be discontinued and resumed, if necessary, after 2 weeks without any symptoms. Only, some signals suggest that people taking an immunosuppressive dose of corticosteroid therapy are at greater risk of developing severe COVID-19. Intra-articular injections of glucocorticoids are allowed when there is no reasonable therapeutic alternative, and providing that precautions to protect the patient and the practitioner from viral contamination are adopted, included appropriate information to the patient. Principal conclusions: Currently available data on managing patients with rheumatic diseases during the COVID-19 pandemic are reassuring and support continuing or initiating symptomatic as well as specific treatments of these diseases, the main target of their management remaining their appropriate control, even during this pandemic.","Richez, Christophe; Flipo, René-Marc; Berenbaum, Francis; Cantagrel, Alain; Claudepierre, Pascal; Debiais, Françoise; Dieudé, Philippe; Goupille, Philippe; Roux, Christian; Schaeverbeke, Thierry; Wendling, Daniel; Pham, Thao; Thomas, Thierry",Joint Bone Spine,127,24

Social and systemic factors determine mental health as much as individual factors. To determine how best to address multi-level risk factors, we must first understand the distribution of risk. Previously, we have used psychometric methods applied to two epidemiologically-principled samples of people aged 14–24 to establish a robust, latent common mental distress (CMD) factor of depression and anxiety normally distributed across the population. This was linearly associated with suicidal thoughts and non-suicidal self-harm such that effective interventions to reduce CMD across the whole population could have a greater total benefit than those that focus on the minority with the most severe scores. In a randomised trial of mindfulness interventions in university students (the Mindful Student Study), we demonstrated a population-shift effect whereby the intervention group appeared resilient to a universal stressor. Given these findings, and in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, we argue that population-based interventions to reduce CMD are urgently required. To target all types of mental health determinants, these interventions must be multi-level. Careful design and evaluation, interdisciplinary work, and extensive local stakeholder involvement are crucial for these interventions to be effective.","Lo Moro, Giuseppina; Soneson, Emma; Jones, Peter B.; Galante, Julieta",Int J Environ Res Public Health,127,16

At the center of these challenges are nurses, the backbone of the healthcare system, and the first point of call for most patients in the country. This research investigated post-traumatic stress and coping strategies of nurses during the second wave of COVID-19 in the country. A structured self-administered questionnaire captured the biographic characteristics, perceived risk factors for COVID-19, and views on infection control of 286 nurses Data were subjected to descriptive and binomial logistic regression analyses. More than four in every 10 nurses screened positive for higher levels of post-traumatic disorder (PTSD). Self-reported risk for contracting COVID-19 mainly centered on being a health worker and patients’ non-adherence to infection prevention guidelines. Unpreparedness to manage COVID-19 patients, poorer health, and avoidant coping were associated with PTSD. Nurses voiced a need for emotional support and empathy from managers.

Redeployment of personnel and cessation of elective services are commonplace. However, there is a continued need for both emergency and oncological surgery. A national review of practice was conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic, to assess impact on services, staffing and training. METHODS: Key aspects of current plastic surgery practice in the United Kingdom were examined in this cross-sectional study; operating capacity, location of theatre lists (national health service or outsourced private institutions), differences across sub-specialties, change in anaesthesia practices, staffing, redeployment, on-call provision and impact on training. RESULTS: Three-hundred and forty-four plastic surgeons in the United Kingdom provided practice data across 51 units. Theatre capacity and outpatient services were markedly reduced. Outsourcing of operating lists to private institutions was widely utilised. Increased use of local anaesthetic hand procedures, the prioritisation of shorter operations with reduced microsurgery in both head and neck/lower limb and almost complete cessation of breast reconstruction was noted, together with marked regional variations. Re-deployment occurred at all staffing levels, whilst telemedicine played a critical role in both patient management and training. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 has enforced unprecedented changes to surgical care delivery and training, as identified by examination of plastic surgery nationally in the United Kingdom. Novel means to support continued elective and emergency services including oncology have been identified.

H7N9 originated with multiple reassortment events between avian viruses and carries genetic markers of human adaptation. Determining whether H7N9 induces a host response closer to that with human or avian IAV is important in order to better characterize this emerging virus. Here we compared the human lung epithelial cell response to infection with A/Anhui/01/13 (H7N9) or highly pathogenic avian-origin H5N1, H7N7, or human seasonal H3N2 IAV. The transcriptomic response to H7N9 was highly specific to this strain but was more similar to the response to human H3N2 than to that to other avian IAVs. H7N9 and H3N2 both elicited responses related to eicosanoid signaling and chromatin modification, whereas H7N9 specifically induced genes regulating the cell cycle and transcription. Among avian IAVs, the response to H7N9 was closest to that elicited by H5N1 virus. Host responses common to H7N9 and the other avian viruses included the lack of induction of the antigen presentation pathway and reduced proinflammatory cytokine induction compared to that with H3N2. Repression of these responses could have an important impact on the immunogenicity and virulence of H7N9 in humans. Finally, using a genome-based drug repurposing approach, we identified several drugs predicted to regulate the host response to H7N9 that may act as potential antivirals, including several kinase inhibitors, as well as FDA-approved drugs, such as troglitazone and minocycline. Importantly, we validated that minocycline inhibited H7N9 replication in vitro, suggesting that our computational approach holds promise for identifying novel antivirals.","Josset, Laurence; Zeng, Hui; Kelly, Sara M.; Tumpey, Terrence M.; Katze, Michael G.",mBio,127,5

METHODS: Death certificates of all deaths in Munich in the death period from 1 March–31 December 2020 were analyzed. The predefined inclusion criteria were the indication of “Corona, COVID-19, SARS-CoV‑2, Influenza (A/B)” on the death certificates. Standardized data entry was performed. The collected data were analyzed descriptively in aggregated form. RESULTS: A total of 12,441 persons died during the study period, 1029 (8.3%) from confirmed COVID-19 and 22 (0.1%) from influenza. The two collectives matched well in the parameters studied. The mean age at death was approximately 80 years and the most common site of death was in hospital. Infectious disease was the cause of death in more than 90% of cases. The most common causes of death were acute respiratory distress syndrome/respiratory failure and multiorgan failure. An average of two previous illnesses were reported, most commonly diseases of the circulatory system and nervous system. There was no influenza death in the second pandemic wave. DISCUSSION: In this study, COVID-19- and influenza-associated deaths were compared for the first time. The deaths of both collectives matched well in the parameters studied, but still require verification in a larger study given the small numbers of influenza cases.

This adherent cell culture platform requires the use of surfaces to support cell growth, typically roller bottles, or microcarriers. We have recently compared the production of rVSV‐ZEBOV on Vero cells between microcarrier and fixed‐bed bioreactors. However, suspension cultures are considered superior with regard to process scalability. Therefore, we further explore the Vero suspension system for recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV)‐vectored vaccine production. Previously, this suspension cell line was only able to be cultivated in a proprietary medium. Here, we expand the adaptation and bioreactor cultivation to a serum‐free commercial medium. Following small‐scale optimization and screening studies, we demonstrate bioreactor productions of highly relevant vaccines and vaccine candidates against Ebola virus disease, HIV, and coronavirus disease 2019 in the Vero suspension system. rVSV‐ZEBOV, rVSV‐HIV, and rVSV(Ind)‐msp‐S(F)‐Gtc can replicate to high titers in the bioreactor, reaching 3.87 × 10(7) TCID(50)/ml, 2.12 × 10(7) TCID(50)/ml, and 3.59 × 10(9) TCID(50)/ml, respectively.

We used the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C) Data Enclave, a harmonized electronic health record (EHR) dataset of 5.9 million nationally-representative, diverse, and gender-balanced patients, to describe outcomes in patients with CLD and cirrhosis with SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: We identified all chronic liver diseases patients with and without cirrhosis who had SARS-CoV-2 testing documented in the N3C Data Enclave as of data release date 5/15/2021. The primary outcome was 30-day all-cause mortality. Survival analysis methods were used to estimate cumulative incidences of death, hospitalization, and mechanical ventilation, and to calculate the associations of SARS-CoV-2 infection, presence of cirrhosis, and demographic and clinical factors to 30-day mortality. RESULTS: We isolated 217,143 patients with CLD: 129,097 (59%) without cirrhosis and SARS-CoV-2 negative, 25,844 (12%) without cirrhosis and SARS-CoV-2 positive, 54,065 (25%) with cirrhosis and SARS-CoV-2 negative, and 8,137 (4%) with cirrhosis and SARS-CoV-2 positive. Among CLD patients without cirrhosis, 30-day all-cause mortality rates were 0.4% in SARS-CoV-2 negative patients and 1.8% in positive patients. Among CLD patients with cirrhosis, 30-day all-cause mortality rates were 4.0% in SARS-CoV-2 negative patients and 9.7% in positive patients. Compared to those who tested SARS-CoV-2 negative, SARS-CoV-2 positivity was associated with more than two-fold (aHR 2.43, 95% CI 2.23–2.64) hazard of death at 30 days among patients with cirrhosis. Compared to patients without cirrhosis, the presence of cirrhosis was associated with a three-fold (aHR 3.39, 95% CI 2.96–3.89) hazard of death at 30 days among patients who tested SARS-CoV-2 positive. Age (aHR 1.03 per year, 95% CI 1.03–1.04) was associated with death at 30 days among patients with cirrhosis who were SARS-CoV-2 positive. CONCLUSIONS: In this study of nearly 220,000 CLD patients, we found SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with cirrhosis was associated with 2.43-times mortality hazard, and the presence of cirrhosis among CLD patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 were associated with 3.39-times mortality hazard. Compared to previous studies, our use of a nationally-representative, diverse, and gender-balanced dataset enables wide generalizability of these findings.","Ge, Jin; Pletcher, Mark J.; Lai, Jennifer C.",medRxiv,127,1

Through existing relationships established by an academic hospital, we established weekly community conference calls to disseminate such critical information on the pandemic and allow community leaders to discuss struggles and successes. From these calls, we were able to collaborate in a more intimate manner with faith-based organizations, whereby we emphasized and planned the role they could undertake during the pandemic. Such emphasis was made between our medical institution and various faith-based organizations through meetings titled “Congregational COVID-19 Conversations.” Over the past 12-months, we held virtual meetings with 38 faith-based organizations: 15 Christian congregations, 21 Jewish synagogues, and 2 Islamic masjids. We describe in detail in this report a narrative summary of the meetings. From these meetings, we discussed several COVID-19-related themes that included how to have their place of worship disseminate public health messaging, aid in preparing buildings for public worship, and insight into preparing their regions for aid in both COVID-19 testing and for potential SARS-CoV-2 vaccine sites. This medical-religious partnership has proven feasible and valuable during the pandemic and warrants emphasis in that it has the potential to serve a vital role in mitigating COVID-19-related disparities in certain communities, as well as potentially ending the COVID-19 pandemic completely.","Monson, Kimberly; Oluyinka, MopeninuJesu; Negro, DanaRose; Hughes, Natasha; Maydan, Daniella; Iqbal, Sahir; Golden, Sherita H.; Teague, Paula; Hale, W.

The data is limited in patients with lymphoid and hematological malignancies. METHODS: The lymphoma database was used to identify patients seen in our institution from 1998 to 2019 with nodular lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin lymphoma (NLPHL). We studied FHM by collecting detailed history of any malignancy in the family (FM). RESULTS: Two hundred NLPHL patients were identified. Contacting was not possible in 30 patients due to no response to the phone calls (22) and death [1]. 170/200 patients were interviewed; represented 167 families (3 patients with a family member with NLPHL). These 170 patients provided information about 8225 family members. These 167 families had a total of 329 family members with 334 malignancies (including 167 NLPHL patients and 5 members with 2 malignancies each). Of these 167 patients, 77 (46.1%) had no FM while 90 (53.9%) patients had a positive FM; 162 family members with 167 malignancies. Among these 167 families, 31 families (18.6%) had members with FHM +/− solid cancers. These 31 families had 35 family members (25 males:10 females) with 16 lymphomas: diffuse large B cell lymphoma [2], follicular center cell lymphoma [3], chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma [3], non-Hodgkin lymphoma [2], classical HL [2], and NLPHL [4]. Total of 8 leukemia: acute lymphoblastic leukemia [4], acute myeloid leukemia [3], and leukemia - no subtyping [5]. These 35 FHM members are 1st [6], 2nd (16), and 3rd [7] degree relatives of 31 NLPHL patients. There are 4 families with NLPHL in family members; all these 8 NLPHL patients are male and are alive. The median total number of 1st + 2nd +3rd degree members are 81. The decrease in the age of diagnosis from 1st generation to the 2nd generation (anticipation) was noted in 13/17 patients; 2nd generation median age at diagnosis was 29.7 years vs 1st generation age 53 years (developed malignancy 23.3 years earlier). CONCLUSION: FHM is frequent in NLPHL. This study provided us many important insights for planning future studies in terms of interviewing technique, time, and resource allocation and genetic testing.

However, it is unclear whether this hepatoprotective effect is also achieved by regulating liver drug metabolism enzyme pathways. Herein, we examined the regulatory effect of HRP on cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A) in rats with immune liver injury, and explored the molecular mechanism of its hepatoprotective effect. Rat models of immunological liver injury were induced by intravenous injections of Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG; 125 mg kg(-1); 2 wks). Specific protein levels were detected by ELISA or western blot, and CYP3A mRNA expression was detected by RT-PCR. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) detected relative changes in CYP3A metabolic activity based on the rates of 1-hydroxylation of the probe drug midazolam (MDZ). BCG pretreatment (125 mg kg-1) significantly down-regulated liver CYP3A protein expression compared with the control, metabolic activity, and transcription levels while up-regulating liver NF-κB, IL-1β, TNF-α and iNOS. HRP intervention (ED(50): 78 mg kg(-1)) moderately reversed NF-κB, inflammatory cytokines, and iNOS activation in a dose-dependent manner (P < 0.05), and suppressed CYP3A down-regulation (P < 0.05); thereby partially alleviating liver injury. During immune liver injury, HRP may reverse CYP3A down-regulation by inhibiting NF-κB signal transduction, and protect liver function, which involves regulation of enzymes transcriptionally, translationally and post-translationally. The discovery that NF-κB is a molecular target of HRP may initiate the development and optimization of a clinical therapeutic approach to mitigate hepatitis B and other immunity-related liver diseases.","Liu, Fengting; Wang, Tao; Li, Xiaoxia; Jia, Jinxue; Lin, Qin; Xue, Yongzhi",PLoS One,127,29

METHODS: This cross-sectional study analyzed the official data of COVID-19 patients in Mexico through May 18, 2020 (released by the Secretaría de Salud de México). Adjusted logistic regression models were applied to assess the associations of comorbidities with pneumonia and death. The marginal effects were estimated, and the probability of pneumonia or death according to the number of comorbidities was graphed for each year of age. RESULTS: Of the 51 053 COVID-19 patients enrolled in the final analysis, 27 667 (54.2%) had no chronic conditions, while 13 652 (26.7%), 6518 (12.8%) and 3216 (6.3%) were reported to have 1, 2, and 3 or more simultaneous conditions, respectively. Overall, a significant incremental gradient was observed for the association between multimorbidity and pneumonia (p<0.001); for 2 chronic conditions, the adjusted odds ratio (aOR) was 2.07 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.95 to 2.20), and for ≥3 conditions, the aOR was 2.40 (95% CI, 2.22 to 2.60). A significant incremental gradient was also found for the relationship between multimorbidity and death (p<0.001); an aOR of 2.51 (95% CI, 2.30 to 2.73) was found for 2 chronic conditions and an aOR of 3.49 (95% CI, 3.15 to 3.86) for ≥3 conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Underlying chronic conditions and multimorbidity are associated with pneumonia and death in Mexican COVID-19 patients. Future investigation is necessary to clarify the pathophysiological processes behind this association, given the high burden of chronic diseases in various countries, including Mexico.","Hernández-Vásquez, Akram; Azañedo, Diego; Vargas-Fernández, Rodrigo; Bendezu-Quispe, Guido",J Prev Med Public Health,127,32

EBOV VP35 is an essential component of the viral RNA polymerase, it is a key participant of the nucleocapsid assembly and it inhibits the innate immune response by antagonizing RIG-I like receptors through its dsRNA binding function and, hence, by suppressing the host type I interferon (IFN) production. Insights into the VP35 dsRNA recognition have been recently revealed by structural and functional analysis performed on its C-terminus protein. We report the biochemical characterization of the Zaire ebolavirus (ZEBOV) full-length recombinant VP35 (rVP35)–dsRNA binding function. We established a novel in vitro magnetic dsRNA binding pull down assay, determined the rVP35 optimal dsRNA binding parameters, measured the rVP35 equilibrium dissociation constant for heterologous in vitro transcribed dsRNA of different length and short synthetic dsRNA of 8 bp, and validated the assay for compound screening by assessing the inhibitory ability of auryntricarboxylic acid (IC(50) value of 50 μg/mL). Furthermore, we compared the dsRNA binding properties of full length wt rVP35 with those of R305A, K309A and R312A rVP35 mutants, which were previously reported to be defective in dsRNA binding-mediated IFN inhibition, showing that the latter have measurably increased K(d) values for dsRNA binding and modified migration patterns in mobility shift assays with respect to wt rVP35. Overall, these results provide the first characterization of the full-length wt and mutants VP35–dsRNA binding functions.","Zinzula, Luca; Esposito, Francesca; Pala, Daniela; Tramontano, Enzo",Antiviral Res,127,1

Here, by ligating head-to-tail viral RNAs from bovine coronavirus-infected cells and sequencing across the ligated junctions, it was learned that at the time of peak viral RNA synthesis [6 hours postinfection (hpi)] the 3’ poly(A) tail on genomic and sgmRNAs is ~65 nucleotides (nt) in length. Surprisingly, this length was found to vary throughout infection from ~45 nt immediately after virus entry (at 0 to 4 hpi) to ~65 nt later on (at 6 h to 9 hpi) and from ~65 nt (at 6 h to 9 hpi) to ~30 nt (at 120-144 hpi). With the same method, poly(U) sequences of the same lengths were simultaneously found on the ligated viral negative-strand RNAs. Functional analyses of poly(A) tail length on specific viral RNA species, furthermore, revealed that translation, in vivo, of RNAs with the longer poly(A) tail was enhanced over those with the shorter poly(A). Although the mechanisms by which the tail lengths vary is unknown, experimental results together suggest that the length of the poly(A) and poly(U) tails is regulated. One potential function of regulated poly(A) tail length might be that for the coronavirus genome a longer poly(A) favors translation. The regulation of coronavirus translation by poly(A) tail length resembles that during embryonal development suggesting there may be mechanistic parallels.","Wu, Hung-Yi; Ke, Ting-Yung; Liao, Wei-Yu; Chang, Nai-Yun",PLoS One,127,0

The crocodile poxvirus F16 protein ortholog has highly significant similarity to prokaryotic serine recombinases and contains all amino acids that comprise the catalytic site. In contrast, F16 orthologs encoded by other poxviruses show only marginally significant similarity to serine recombinases, lack essential amino acids of the active site and are most likely inactive derivatives of serine recombinases. Nevertheless, the conservation of F16L in non-avian poxviruses suggested an important function. However, a VACV mutant with the F16L gene knocked out replicated normally in dividing and quiescent cells. The F16 protein was synthesized early after infection and detected in virus cores. When expressed in infected or uninfected cells, F16 accumulated in nucleoli depending on the level of expression and confluency of cells. Evidence was obtained that F16 forms multimers, which might regulate concentration-dependent intracellular localization.","Senkevich, Tatiana G.; Koonin, Eugene V.; Moss, Bernard",Virology,127,1

It is highly variable in its expression and severity. It is believed to be autoimmune in nature. The cause is unknown; both genetic and environmental factors have been implicated in the pathogenesis. MS generally presents with the acute or subacute onset of neurologic abnormalities that may wax and wane over many years. Diagnosis is generally made by means of observation of the clinical course in conjunction with a neurologic examination and laboratory tests. These tests may include magnetic resonance imaging of the head and spine, lumbar puncture, and evoked potentials. Treatment is based on general supportive care, the use of corticosteroids for relapses, and symptomatic management of ongoing problems. The frequency of relapses can be reduced with interferon-β (Betaseron). Copolymer 1 and interferon-β la are being evaluated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for approval for use for reduction in the frequency of relapses in relapsing-remitting MS.

Some individuals may want to use common fabric materials for respiratory protection because of shortage or affordability reasons. To address the filtration performance of common fabric materials against nano-size particles including viruses, five major categories of fabric materials including sweatshirts, T-shirts, towels, scarves, and cloth masks were tested for polydisperse and monodisperse aerosols (20–1000 nm) at two different face velocities (5.5 and 16.5 cm s(−1)) and compared with the penetration levels for N95 respirator filter media. The results showed that cloth masks and other fabric materials tested in the study had 40–90% instantaneous penetration levels against polydisperse NaCl aerosols employed in the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health particulate respirator test protocol at 5.5 cm s(−1). Similarly, varying levels of penetrations (9–98%) were obtained for different size monodisperse NaCl aerosol particles in the 20–1000 nm range. The penetration levels of these fabric materials against both polydisperse and monodisperse aerosols were much higher than the penetrations for the control N95 respirator filter media. At 16.5 cm s(−1) face velocity, monodisperse aerosol penetrations slightly increased, while polydisperse aerosol penetrations showed no significant effect except one fabric mask with an increase. Results obtained in the study show that common fabric materials may provide marginal protection against nanoparticles including those in the size ranges of virus-containing particles in exhaled breath.","Rengasamy, Samy; Eimer, Benjamin; Shaffer, Ronald E.",Ann Occup Hyg,127,3

TMZ may protect elderly patients with ischaemic heart disease (IHD) undergoing non-cardiac surgery. METHODS: This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (registration #ChiCTR1900025018) of patients with IHD scheduled to undergo non-cardiac surgery at Shenzhen People’s Hospital (Shenzhen, Guangdong Province, China) between June 2014 and September 2015, randomized to 60 mg TMZ or placebo 12 h before surgery. The primary endpoint was the occurrence of in-hospital cardiovascular events. The secondary endpoints were myocardial ischaemia on five-lead electrocardiogram (cECG), cardiac troponin I (cTnI) elevation, cardiac death, acute coronary events, heart failure, and arrhythmia requiring treatments. RESULTS: Compared with the placebo group, the TMZ group showed a lower occurrence of in-hospital cardiovascular events (primary endpoint, 20.0% vs. 37.5%, P = 0.02), myocardial ischaemia (15.0% vs. 32.5%, P < 0.01), cTnI elevation (2.5% vs. 10%, P < 0.01), acute coronary events (10.0% vs. 20.0%, P < 0.05), heart failure (0% vs. 2.5%, P < 0.05), and arrhythmia requiring treatment (17.5% vs. 35.0%, P < 0.05).

WhatsApp is being used as an important source of COVID-19–related information during the current pandemic. Unlike Facebook and Twitter, limited studies have investigated the role of WhatsApp as a source of communication, information, or misinformation during crisis situations. OBJECTIVE: Our study aimed to evaluate the vulnerability of demographic cohorts in a developing country toward COVID-19–related misinformation shared via WhatsApp. We also aimed to identify characteristics of WhatsApp messages associated with increased credibility of misinformation. METHODS: We conducted a web-based questionnaire survey and designed a scoring system based on theories supported by the existing literature. Vulnerability (K) was measured as a ratio of the respondent’s score to the maximum score. Respondents were stratified according to age and occupation, and K(mean) was calculated and compared among each subgroup using single-factor analysis of variance and Hochberg GT2 tests. The questionnaire evaluated the respondents’ opinion of the veracity of coronavirus-related WhatsApp messages. The responses to the false-proven messages were compared using z test between the 2 groups: coronavirus-related WhatsApp messages with an attached link and/or source and those without. RESULTS: We analyzed 1137 responses from WhatsApp users in India. Users aged over 65 years had the highest vulnerability (K(mean)=0.38, 95% CI 0.341-0.419) to misinformation. Respondents in the age group 19-25 years had significantly lower vulnerability (K(mean)=0.31, 95% CI 0.301-0.319) than those aged over 25 years (P<.05). The vulnerability of users employed in elementary occupations was the highest (K(mean)=0.38, 95% CI 0.356-0.404), and it was significantly higher than that of professionals and students (P<.05). Interestingly, the vulnerability of healthcare workers was not significantly different from that of other occupation groups (P>.05). We found that false CRWMs with an attached link and/or source were marked true 6 times more often than false CRWMs without an attached link or source (P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that in a developing country, WhatsApp users aged over 65 years and those involved in elementary occupations were found to be the most vulnerable to false information disseminated via WhatsApp. Health care workers, who are otherwise considered as experts with regard to this global health care crisis, also shared this vulnerability to misinformation with other occupation groups. Our findings also indicated that the presence of an attached link and/or source falsely validating an incorrect message adds significant false credibility, making it appear true. These results indicate an emergent need to address and rectify the current usage patterns of WhatsApp users. This study also provides metrics that can be used by health care organizations and government authorities of developing countries to formulate guidelines to contain the spread of WhatsApp-related misinformation.","Bapaye, Jay Amol; Bapaye, Harsh Amol",JMIR Public Health Surveill,127,29

NETosis is driven by protein-arginine deiminase type 4, with the release of intracellular granule components that function by capturing and destroying microbes, including viral, fungal, bacterial, and protozoal pathogens. The positive effects of pathogen control are countered by pro-inflammatory effects as demonstrated in a variety of diseases. Components of NETS are non-specific, and other than controlling microbes, they cause injury to surrounding tissue by themselves or by increasing the pro-inflammatory response. NETs can play a role in enhancement of the inflammation seen in autoimmune diseases including psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, and systemic lupus erythematosis. In addition, autoinflammatory diseases such as gout have been associated with NETosis. Inhibition of NETs may decrease the severity of many diseases improving survival. Herein, we describe NETosis in different diseases focusing on the detrimental effect of NETs and outline possible therapeutics that can be used to mitigate netosis. There is a need for more studies and clinical trials on these and other compounds that could prevent or destroy NETs, thereby decreasing damage to patients.","Mutua, Victoria; Gershwin, Laurel J.",Clin Rev Allergy Immunol,127,33

In this work, composite membranes of polylactic acid and ZnO NPs containing 5–40 wt.% of the latter NPs were produced by means of electrospinning. For the first time, polymer material loaded with up to 40 wt.% of ZnO NPs (produced via laser ablation in air and having non-modified surface) was used to prepare fiber-based composite membranes. The morphology, phase composition, mechanical, spectral and antibacterial properties of the membranes were tested by a set of analytical techniques including SEM, XRD, FTIR, UV-vis, and photoluminescence spectroscopy. Antibacterial activity of the materials was evaluated following standard procedures (ISO 20743:2013) and using S. aureus and E. coli bacteria. It is shown that incorporation of 5–10 wt.% of NPs led to improved mechanical properties of the composite membranes, while further increase of ZnO content up to 20 wt.% and above resulted in their noticeable deterioration. At the same time, the antibacterial properties of ZnO-rich membranes were more pronounced, which is explained by a larger number of surface-exposed ZnO NPs, in addition to those embedded into the bulk of fiber material.","Goncharova, Daria A.; Bolbasov, Evgeny N.; Nemoykina, Anna L.; Aljulaih, Ali A.; Tverdokhlebova, Tamara S.; Kulinich, Sergei A.; Svetlichnyi, Valery A.",Materials (Basel),127,16

Strategies to rapidly assess T‐cell responses are therefore likely to be important for assessing immunity in the global population. METHODS: Here, we have developed a rapid immune‐monitoring strategy to assess virus‐specific memory T‐cell responses in the peripheral blood of COVID‐19 convalescent individuals. We validated SARS‐CoV‐2‐specific memory T‐cell responses detected in whole blood using in vitro expansion with SARS‐CoV‐2 proteins. RESULTS: T‐cell immunity characterised by the production of IFN‐γ and IL‐2 could be consistently detected in the whole blood of recovered participants. T cells predominantly recognised structural SARS‐CoV‐2 proteins. In vitro expansion demonstrated that while CD8(+) T cells recognised nucleocapsid protein, spike protein and ORF3a, CD4(+) T cells more broadly targeted multiple SARS‐CoV‐2 proteins.

It has been speculated that use of pioglitazone might increase such risk. The aim of our brief commentary is to review the safety of pioglitazone in people with T2DM and mild/moderate COVID-19. METHODS: We searched PubMed database using specific keywords related to our aims till May 15, 2020. Full text of relevant articles published in English language were retrieved and reviewed. RESULTS: Medications, including pioglitazone, that upregulate tissue expression of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), might have a dual role in COVID-19; on the one hand they might increase risk of infection as SARS-CoV2 uses ACE2 as a coreceptor to enter alveolar cells, but on the other hand, by reducing angiotensin II levels, they can protect against acute lung injury. There is no evidence to date that pioglitazone upregulates ACE2 in the alveolar cells; rather, there is evidence from animal studies of upregulation of ACE2 in insulin sensitive tissues, which might have a protective effect on lung injury. Moreover by moderating the exaggerated host proinflammatory response, pioglitazone can potentially reduce SARS-CoV-2 driven hyperinflammation. CONCLUSIONS: Pioglitazone has more potential for benefit than harm, and can be continued in people with T2DM and mild/moderate COVID-19, unless there are specific contraindications for its use. There is an urgent need to assess clinically relevant outcomes in people with diabetes and COVID-19 based upon baseline antidiabetes therapy, in particular pioglitazone.","Jagat J, Mukherjee; Kalyan K, Gangopadhyay; Subir, Ray",Diabetes Metab Syndr,127,1

METHODS: Two reviewers comprehensively searched PubMed database for literature regarding pathophysiology and efficacy of prone position in ARDS patients as well as specific data regarding this approach in COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSION: Prone positioning is well-documented to improve oxygenation and cardiac function in ARDS patients and might confer increased survival, with benefits that outweigh risks such as facial edema, endotracheal tube displacement, and intraabdominal organ dysfunction in obese patients. Severe COVID-19 pneumonia, while meeting ARDS criteria, differs from typical ARDS in several ways. Data would suggest that advantages of prone position would become limited after significant disease progression and fibrosis. The use of this technique in COVID-19 requires prolonged sessions that are unprecedented in the treatment of ARDS patients. New data regarding COVID-19 pathophysiology and patients continues to evolve daily. More frequently, patients are proned while maintaining spontaneous breathing—the results of this intervention are an area for future studies. There is more to learn about the appropriate use of prone position in COVID-19 patients. The multisystem risks and benefits require clinicians to adopt a patient centered decision-making algorithm when employing this technique in COVID-19 patients.

Healthcare workers are at the forefront of such pressures resulting from a persistent threat to their safety and well being. It is therefore important to study such mechanisms that can influence and predict the psychological distress of nurses OBJECTIVES: While there is an increasing number of studies on positive outcomes of leadership styles, their influence on curbing unwanted adverse outcomes is scarce. This study aims to observe the influence of an inclusive leadership style on psychological distress while assessing the mediating role of psychological safety. It uses the theoretical lens of job demands-resources theory and the theory of shattered assumptions to develop and test hypotheses. DESIGN: Cross-Sectional Study with Temporal Separation SETTINGS AND PARTICIPANTS: The researchers recruited 451 on-duty registered nurses from 5 hospitals providing patient care during the highly infectious phase of COVID-19 in January 2020 in Wuhan city, the epicentre of the outbreak in China METHODS: After obtaining permission from hospital administration, data were collected through an online questionnaire survey in three stages with temporal separation to avoid common method bias. Partial least square structural equation modelling was used to analyze data. The study controlled for effects of age, gender, experience, working hours and education. RESULTS: Hypothesized relationships proved significant. Inclusive leadership has an inverse relationship with psychological distress with a strong path-coefficient. Psychological safety mediates the relationship between inclusive leadership and psychological distress while explaining 28.6% variance. Multi-group analysis results indicate no significant differences between respondents based on these control variables CONCLUSIONS: Recurring or prolonged experiences of stress and anxiety at the workplace, without a mechanism to counter such effects, can culminate into psychological distress. Inclusive leadership style can serve as such a mechanism to curb psychological distress for healthcare workers by creating a psychologically safe environment.","Zhao, Fuqiang; Ahmed, Fawad; Faraz, Naveed Ahmad",Int J Nurs Stud,127,5

During the early stage of the pandemic, preprints represented nearly 40% of all English-language COVID-19 scientific corpus (6, 000+ preprints | 16, 000+ articles). As of mid-August 2020, that proportion dropped to around 28% (13, 000+ preprints | 49, 000+ articles). Nevertheless, preprint servers remain a key engine in the efficient dissemination of scientific work on this infectious disease. But, giving the uncertified nature of the scientific manuscripts curated on preprint repositories, their integration to the global ecosystem of scientific communication is not without creating serious tensions. This is especially the case for biomedical knowledge since the dissemination of bad science can have widespread societal consequences. Scope: In this paper, I propose a robust method that will allow the repeated monitoring and measuring of COVID-19 preprint's publication rate. I also introduce a new API called Upload-or-Perish. It is a micro-API service that enables a client to query a specific preprint manuscript's publication status and associated meta-data using a unique ID. This tool is in active development. Data: I use Covid-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19) to calculate COVID-19 preprint corpus' conversion rate to peer-reviewed articles. CORD-19 dataset includes preprints from arXiv, bioRxiv, and medRxiv. Methods: I utilize conditional fuzzy logic on article titles to determine if a preprint has a published counterpart version in the database. My approach is an important departure from previous studies that rely exclusively on bioRxiv API to ascertain preprints' publication status. This is problematic since the level of false positives in bioRxiv metadata could be as high as 37%. Findings: My analysis reveals that around 15% of COVID-19 preprint manuscripts in CORD-19 dataset that were uploaded on from arXiv, bioRxiv, and medRxiv between January and early August 2020 were published in a peer-reviewed venue. When compared to the most recent measure available, this represents a two-fold increase in a period of two months.

However, the molecular regulators that establish and maintain the features of GM-CSF-positive CD4 T cells are unknown. In order to identify these regulators, we isolated human GM-CSF-producing CD4 T cells from human peripheral blood by using a cytokine capture assay. We compared these cells to the corresponding GM-CSF-negative fraction, and furthermore, we studied naïve CD4 T cells, memory CD4 T cells, and bulk CD4 T cells from the same individuals as additional control cell populations. As a result, we provide a rich resource of integrated chromatin accessibility (ATAC-seq) and transcriptome (RNA-seq) data from these primary human CD4 T cell subsets and we show that the identified signatures are associated with human autoimmune diseases, especially multiple sclerosis. By combining information about mRNA expression, DNA accessibility, and predicted transcription factor binding, we reconstructed directed gene regulatory networks connecting transcription factors to their targets, which comprise putative key regulators of human GM-CSF-positive CD4 T cells as well as memory CD4 T cells. Our results suggest potential therapeutic targets to be investigated in the future in human autoimmune disease.","Éliás, Szabolcs; Schmidt, Angelika; Gomez-Cabrero, David; Tegnér, Jesper",J Immunol Res,127,16

In Mexico, from 3 January 2020 to 9 January 2021, there have been 1439, 569 confirmed cases of COVID-19 with 131,031 deaths. The World Health Organization reported that Mexico was ranked twelfth, in terms of confirmed cases of COVID-19 by country. Aim: the objective of this study was to determine what modifications dentists from the Mexican Republic have made to their dental practice during theCOVID-19 pandemic. Methods: the study was conducted based on a questionnaire to evaluate the dentists’ response and knowledge on the modifications in their dental practice to combat the new coronavirus’s cross-transmission. The questionnaire was piloted before it was distributed. The questionnaire was disseminated through the social network Facebook. The questionnaire was distributed to groups of dentists on Facebook, in each of the Mexican Republic states. The survey was carried out during June 2020. Results and Conclusions: from the 32 states of the Mexican Republic, 29 participated with at least one respondent. The results of the applied survey suggest that dentists, at least the population of surveyed ones, have proper knowledge of detection methods of patients suspected of COVID-19, preventive measures that must be applied in the dental office to decrease the risk of infection, and the appropriate procedures and solutions for dental office disinfection.","Casillas Santana, Miguel Ángel; Martínez Zumarán, Alan; Patiño Marín, Nuria; Castillo Silva, Brenda Eréndida; Sámano Valencia, Carolina; Salas Orozco, Marco Felipe",Int J Environ Res Public Health,127,16

It first reviews the field of health services research and the approaches that dominate it. It then considers the healthcare research approaches whose principles and methodologies are more aligned with “slow science” before presenting a description of a “slow science” project in which the authors are currently engaged.FindingsCurrent approaches to health service research struggle to offer adequate resources for resolving frontline complexity, principally because they set more store by knowledge generalisation, disciplinary continuity and integrity and the consolidation of expertise, than by engaging with frontline complexity on its terms, negotiating issues with frontline staff and patients on their terms and framing findings and solutions in ways that key in to the in situ dynamics and complexities that define health service delivery.Originality/valueThere is a need to engage in a paradigm shift that engages health services as co-researchers, prioritising practical change and local involvement over knowledge production. Economics is a research field where the products are of natural appeal to powerful health service managers. A “slow science” approach adopted by the embedded Economist Program with its emphasis on pre-implementation, knowledge mobilisation and parallel site capacity development sets out how research can be flexibly produced to improve health services.","Jorm, Christine Iedema Rick Piper Donella Goodwin Nicholas Searles Andrew",Journal of Health Organization and Management,127,29

Lectins are categorized into many families based on their different cellular locations as well as their specificities for a variety of carbohydrate structures due to the features of their carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) modules. Many studies have indicated that the direct recognition of particular oligosaccharides on viral components by lectins is important for interactions between hosts and viruses. Herein, we aim to globally review the roles of this recognition by animal lectins in antiviral immune responses and viral pathogenesis. The different classes of mammalian lectins can either recognize carbohydrates to activate host immunity for viral elimination or can exploit those carbohydrates as susceptibility factors to facilitate viral entry, replication or assembly. Additionally, some arthropod C-type lectins were recently identified as key susceptibility factors that directly interact with multiple viruses and then facilitate infection. Summarization of the pleiotropic roles of direct viral recognition by animal lectins will benefit our understanding of host-virus interactions and could provide insight into the role of lectins in antiviral drug and vaccine development.","Liu, Yang; Liu, Jianying; Pang, Xiaojing; Liu, Tao; Ning, Zhijie; Cheng, Gong",Molecules,127,22

The evolution of such antibodies during convalescence from COVID-19 is largely unknown. We develop assays to measure Fc-dependent antibody functions against SARS-CoV-2 spike (S)-expressing cells in serial samples from subjects primarily with mild-moderate COVID-19, up to 149 days post-infection. We find that S-specific antibodies capable of engaging Fcγ receptors decay over time, with S-specific antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and antibody-dependent phagocytosis (ADP) activity within plasma declining accordingly. Although there is significant decay in ADCC and ADP activity, they remain readily detectable in almost all subjects at the last timepoint studied (94%) in contrast with neutralisation activity (70%). While it remains unclear the degree to which Fc effector functions contribute to protection against SARS-CoV-2 re-infection, our results indicate that antibodies with Fc effector functions persist longer than neutralising antibodies.","Lee, Wen Shi; Selva, Kevin John; Davis, Samantha K.; Wines, Bruce D.; Reynaldi, Arnold; Esterbauer, Robyn; Kelly, Hannah G.; Haycroft, Ebene R.; Tan, Hyon-Xhi; Juno, Jennifer A.; Wheatley, Adam K.; Hogarth, P.

The available data provide evidence for a variety of RNA recombination mechanisms. Non-homologous recombination seems to be the most common for RNA. Recent experiments in both the in vitro and the in vivo systems indicate that this type of recombination may result from various transesterification reactions which are either performed by RNA molecules themselves or are promoted by some proteins. The high frequency of homologous recombination manifested by some RNA viruses can be easier explained by a replicative template switch.","Chetverin, Alexander B",FEBS Letters,127,20

This affects their emotions and motivates them to buy or sell shares. Financial sentiment analysis allows us to understand the effect of social media reactions and emotions on the stock market and vice versa. In this research, we analyse Twitter data and important worldwide financial indices to answer the following question: How does the polarity generated by Twitter posts influence the behaviour of financial indices during pandemics? This study is based on the financial sentiment analysis of influential Twitter accounts and its relationship with the behaviour of important financial indices. To carry out this analysis, we used fundamental and technical financial analysis combined with a lexicon-based approach on financial Twitter accounts. We calculated the correlations between the polarities of financial market indicators and posts on Twitter by applying a date shift on tweets. In addition, correlations were identified days before and after the existing posts on financial Twitter accounts. Our findings show that the markets reacted 0 to 10 days after the information was shared and disseminated on Twitter during the COVID-19 pandemic and 0 to 15 days after the information was shared and disseminated on Twitter during the H1N1 pandemic. We identified an inverse relationship: Twitter accounts presented reactions to financial market behaviour within a period of 0 to 11 days during the H1N1 pandemic and 0 to 6 days during the COVID-19 pandemic. We also found that our method is better at detecting highly shifted correlations by using SenticNet compared with other lexicons. With SenticNet, it is possible to detect correlations even on the same day as the Twitter posts. The most influential Twitter accounts during the period of the pandemic were The New York Times, Bloomberg, CNN News and Investing.com, presenting a very high correlation between sentiments on Twitter and stock market behaviour. The combination of a lexicon-based approach is enhanced by a shifted correlation analysis, as latent or hidden correlations can be found in data.","Valle-Cruz, David; Fernandez-Cortez, Vanessa; López-Chau, Asdrúbal; Sandoval-Almazán, Rodrigo",Cognit Comput,127,16

METHODS: Descriptive serial cross-sectional study based on secondary data on COVID-19 hospitalizations from SIVEP-Gripe, a public and open-access database of Severe Acute Respiratory Illness records collected by the Brazilian Ministry of Health, and COVID-19 case notification data from Brasil.io, a repository of public data. Fifty-six epidemiological weeks were split into four periods. The following variables were considered for each Brazilian Health Region, per period: number of hospitalizations, hospitalizations per 100,000 inhabitants, hospitalizations per 100 new cases notified in the Health Region, percentage of hospitalizations with ICU use, percentages of hospitalizations with invasive and non-invasive ventilatory support, percentage of hospitalizations resulting in death and percentage of hospitalizations with ICU use resulting in death. Descriptive statistics of the variables were obtained across all 450 Health Regions in Brazil over the four defined pandemic periods. Maps were generated to capture the spatiotemporal variation and trends during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil. RESULTS: There was great variation in how COVID-19 hospitalizations grew and spread among Health Regions, with higher numbers between June and August 2020, and, especially, from mid-December 2020 to March 2021. The variation pattern in the proportion of ICU use in the hospitalizations across the Health Regions was broad, with no intensive care provision in large areas in the North, Northeast, and Midwest. The proportions of hospitalizations and hospitalizations with ICU use resulting in deaths were remarkably high, reaching medians of 34.0% and 62.0% across Health Regions, respectively. CONCLUSION: The Heath Regions in Brazil are highly diverse, showing broad disparities in the capacity to respond to the demands imposed by COVID-19, services provided, use and outcomes.","Pereira, Claudia Cristina de Aguiar; Martins, Mônica; Lima, Sheyla Maria Lemos; de Andrade, Carla Lourenço Tavares; Soares, Fernando Ramalho Gameleira; Portela, Margareth Crisóstomo",PLoS One,127,22

Disease control measures introduced during the COVID-19 pandemic mean that people spend much more time in their immediate households, due to lockdowns, the need to self-isolate, and school and workplace closures. This has elevated the importance of certain household–level characteristics for individuals’ current and future wellbeing. The multi-dimensional poverty and health inequalities literature suggests that poor health and socio-economic conditions cluster in the general population, which may exacerbate societal inequalities over time. This study investigates how COVID-19-related health- and socio-economic vulnerabilities occur at the household level, and how they are distributed across household types and geographical areas in the United Kingdom. Using a nationally representative cross-sectional study of UK households and applying principal components analysis, we derived summary measures representing different dimensions of household vulnerabilities critical during the COVID-19 epidemic: health, employment, housing, financial and digital. Our analysis highlights four key findings. First, although COVID-19-related health risks are concentrated in retirement-age households, a substantial proportion of working age households also face these risks. Second, different types of households exhibit different vulnerabilities, with working-age households more likely to face financial and housing precarities, and retirement-age households health and digital vulnerabilities. Third, there are area-level differences in the distribution of household-level -vulnerabilities across England and the constituent countries of the United Kingdom. Fourth, in many households, different dimensions of vulnerabilities intersect; this is especially prevalent among working-age households. The findings imply that the short- and long-term consequences of the COVID-19 crisis are likely to significantly vary by household type. Policy measures that aim to mitigate the health and socio-economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic should consider how vulnerabilities cluster and interact with one another across different household types, and how these may exacerbate already existing inequalities.","Mikolai, Júlia; Keenan, Katherine; Kulu, Hill",SSM Popul Health,127,17

The COVID‐19 virus has changed the way that staff help people with an intellectual disability. We wanted to know about those changes and whether learning about positive behavioural support (PBS) helped staff to cope with them. The main changes were that people with an intellectual disability could not go out or see family and friends as often. Staff came up with new things to do for the people they supported, and PBS learning seemed to help staff to cope. ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: It has been suggested that COVID‐19 and the associated restrictions are likely to have a negative impact on the provision of positive behavioural support (PBS) to people with an intellectual disability. METHODS: Fifty‐eight staff, who had recently completed an accredited positive behavioural support (PBS) programme, responded to an online questionnaire, which asked them to rate the impact of COVID‐19 on factors related to PBS. RESULTS: Participants reported a neutral or somewhat positive impact on all the areas measured, with the exception of the activities and quality of life of those they supported, which were somewhat negatively affected. The participants rated the learning from their PBS programme as helping them cope with COVID‐19 to some extent. Examples of positive and negative effects and ways in which PBS helped staff to cope are presented. CONCLUSIONS: Many staff developed creative solutions that allowed them to provide PBS despite the COVID‐19 restrictions. PBS learning appeared to help staff cope with the negative impact of the restrictions.","Murray, George C.; McKenzie, Karen; Martin, Rachel; Murray, Aja",Br J Learn Disabil,127,16

This opens the question of what factors can explain the initial faster spread in some countries compared to others. Many such factors are overshadowed by the effect of the countermeasures, so we studied the early phases of the infection when countermeasures had not yet taken place. We collected the most diverse dataset of potentially relevant factors and infection metrics to date for this task. Using it, we show the importance of different factors and factor categories as determined by both statistical methods and machine learning (ML) feature selection (FS) approaches. Factors related to culture (e.g., individualism, openness), development, and travel proved the most important. A more thorough factor analysis was then made using a novel rule discovery algorithm. We also show how interconnected these factors are and caution against relying on ML analysis in isolation. Importantly, we explore potential pitfalls found in the methodology of similar work and demonstrate their impact on COVID-19 data analysis. Our best models using the decision tree classifier can predict the infection class with roughly 80% accuracy.","Janko, Vito; Slapničar, Gašper; Dovgan, Erik; Reščič, Nina; Kolenik, Tine; Gjoreski, Martin; Smerkol, Maj; Gams, Matjaž; Luštrek, Mitja",Int J Environ Res Public Health,127,21

We aimed to establish optimal practices in inter-system data sharing and LOS modeling to support patient care and regional hospital operations. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We completed a retrospective observational study of patients admitted with COVID-19 followed by 12-week prospective validation, involving 36 hospitals covering the upper Midwest. We developed a method for sharing de-identified patient data across systems for analysis. From this, we compared 3 approaches, generalized linear model (GLM) and random forest (RF), and aggregated system level averages to identify features associated with LOS. We compared model performance by area under the ROC curve (AUROC). RESULTS: A total of 2068 patients were included and used for model derivation and 597 patients for validation. LOS overall had a median of 5.0 days and mean of 8.2 days. Consistent predictors of LOS included age, critical illness, oxygen requirement, weight loss, and nursing home admission. In the validation cohort, the RF model (AUROC 0.890) and GLM model (AUROC 0.864) achieved good to excellent prediction of LOS, but only marginally better than system averages in practice. CONCLUSION: Regional sharing of patient data allowed for effective prediction of LOS across systems; however, this only provided marginal improvement over hospital averages at the aggregate level. A federated approach of sharing aggregated system capacity and average LOS will likely allow for effective capacity management at the regional level.","Usher, Michael G; Tourani, Roshan; Simon, Gyorgy; Tignanelli, Christopher; Jarabek, Bryan; Strauss, Craig E; Waring, Stephen C; Klyn, Niall A M; Kealey, Burke T; Tambyraja, Rabindra; Pandita, Deepti; Baum, Karyn D",JAMIA Open,127,24

Using single-cell technologies in models of respiratory viral infection, we found that lung cDC2s acquired expression of the Fc receptor CD64 shared with MCs and of IRF8 shared with cDC1s. These inflammatory cDC2s (inf-cDC2s) were superior in inducing CD4(+) T helper (Th) cell polarization while simultaneously presenting antigen to CD8(+) T cells. When carefully separated from inf-cDC2s, MCs lacked APC function. Inf-cDC2s matured in response to cell-intrinsic Toll-like receptor and type 1 interferon receptor signaling, upregulated an IRF8-dependent maturation module, and acquired antigens via convalescent serum and Fc receptors.

Although people at the extremes of age have a greater risk of complications, influenza has been more frequently investigated in the elderly than in children, and inpatients than outpatients. Yearly vaccination with trivalent or quadrivalent vaccines is the main strategy to control influenza. OBJECTIVES: Determine the clinical and molecular characteristics of influenza A and B infections in children and adolescents with influenza-like illness (ILI). METHODS: A cohort of outpatient children and adolescents with ILI was followed for 20 months. Influenza was diagnosed with commercial multiplex PCR platforms. RESULTS: 179 patients had 277 episodes of ILI, being 79 episodes of influenza A and 20 episodes of influenza B. Influenza A and B cases were mild and had similar presentation. Phylogenetic tree of influenza B viruses showed that 91.6% belonged to the B/Yamagata lineage, which is not included in trivalent vaccines. CONCLUSIONS: Influenza A and B are often detected in children and adolescents with ILI episodes, with similar and mild presentation in outpatients. The mismatch between the circulating influenza viruses and the trivalent vaccine offered in Brazil may have contributed to the high frequency of influenza A and B in this population.","Machado, Clarisse M.; de Souza, Ana Carolina Mamana Fernandes; Romano, Camila Malta; dos Santos Freire, Wilton; Costa, Ângela Aparecida; Figueiredo, Walter Manso; Pannuti, Cláudio S.; Luna, Expedito J.A.",Braz J Infect Dis,127,29

Overall use, but especially non-indicated use, and misuse of antibiotics are drivers of antibiotic resistance (ABR). High non-indicated use of antibiotics for uncomplicated vaginal deliveries is widespread in many parts of the world. Similarly, irrational use of antibiotics is reported for children. There is scarcity of evidence regarding antibiotic use and ABR in Lao PDR (Laos). The overarching aim of this project is to fill those knowledge gaps and to evaluate a quality improvement intervention. The primary objective is to estimate the proportion of uncomplicated vaginal deliveries where antibiotics are used and to compare its trend before and after the intervention. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This 3-year, prospective, quasiexperimental study without comparison group includes a formative and interventional phase. Data on antibiotic use during delivery will be collected from medical records. Knowledge, attitudes and reported practices on antibiotic use in pregnancy, during delivery and for children, will be collected from women through questionnaires. Healthcare providers’ knowledge, attitudes and practices of antibiotics administration for pregnant women, during delivery and for children, will be collected via adapted questionnaires. Perceptions regarding antibiotics will be explored through focus group discussions with women and individual interviews with key stakeholders. Faecal samples for culturing of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella spp. and antibiotic susceptibility testing will be taken before, during and 6 months after delivery to determine colonisation of resistant strains. The planned intervention will comprise training workshops, educational materials and social media campaign and will be evaluated using interrupted time series analysis.

We focus on applying CATCH to capture viral genomes in complex metagenomic samples. We design, synthesize, and validate multiple probe sets, including one that targets whole genomes of the 356 viral species known to infect humans. Capture with these probe sets enriches unique viral content on average 18-fold, allowing us to assemble genomes that could not be recovered without enrichment, and accurately preserves within-sample diversity. We also use these probe sets to recover genomes from the 2018 Lassa fever outbreak in Nigeria and to improve detection of uncharacterized viral infections in human and mosquito samples.

T-B cooperation requires co-processing of B and T cell epitopes by the same B cell and is subject to MHC-II restriction. We evaluated MHC-II constraints relevant to the neutralizing antibody response to a mutationally-constrained B cell epitope in the receptor binding motif (RBM) of the spike protein. Examining common MHC-II alleles, we found that peptides surrounding this key B cell epitope are predicted to bind poorly, suggesting a lack MHC-II support in T-B cooperation, impacting generation of high-potency neutralizing antibodies in the general population. Additionally, we found that multiple microbial peptides had potential for RBM cross-reactivity, supporting previous exposures as a possible source of T cell memory.","Castro, Andrea; Ozturk, Kivilcim; Zanetti, Maurizio; Carter, Hannah",bioRxiv,127,9

An analysis of general and patient- (user-) focused quality, readability, and content of websites and videos was performed. It revealed a generally medium to low quality of internet resources. Therefore, understandability, informative value, and support in a decision-making process can be attributed to single websites/videos only. Our study clearly highlights the risk of misinformation by insufficient, incorrect, misleading, and out-of-date information. Knowing what content is assessable to patients online may help clinicians to educate their patients and actively address misinformation. ABSTRACT: Background: Online information gathering can increase patients’ engagement in decision-making. The quality of online resources available for monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) was evaluated. Methods: 900 websites from Google, Bing, Yahoo, and 150 YouTube videos were assessed. Results: The websites did not differ regarding their search rank or between the search engines. The median time since last update was 24 months. The 86 unique websites showed a medium to poor general quality (JAMA score 3/4, only 8.1% websites with a valid HON certificate). The patient- (user-) focused quality was poor (sum DISCERN score 27/80 points). The reading level was difficult (11th US school grade). The content level was very low (13/50 points). 12.8% of websites contained misleading/wrong facts. Websites provided by scientific/governmental organizations had a higher content level. For the 61 unique videos, the median time since upload was 34 months. The videos showed a medium general quality (HON Foundation score). The patient- (user-) focused quality was poor (sum DISCERN score 24 points). The content level was very low (6 points). Conclusion: MGUS-relevant online sources showed a low quality that was provided on a high reading level.

This study measured symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in ED HCW in Brooklyn, New York, experienced during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: An email-distributed survey of ED HCW at Maimonides Medical Center was conducted September 8–December 31, 2020, with reference period March–May 2020. Posttraumatic stress symptoms were measured by the PTSD checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5). A PCL-5 score >32 was deemed clinically relevant. Our main predictor was HCW status, which was dichotomized as clinical (MD/DO, nurses, ED technicians) vs non-clinical. Covariates included sex, age, race, SARS-CoV-2 testing status (not tested vs +test vs -test), social support (range: 0- >4 people to talk to), number of COVID-related home problems (range: 0-9), mental health care disruption during COVID-19 (yes/no), 3-item Loneliness Brief Survey (LBF) score (range: 3-9), and survey date. General linear regression and logistic regression analyses were used to predict PCL-5 score (β-coefficient, p-value) and clinically relevant posttraumatic stress symptoms (odds ratio (OR), 95% confidence interval (95% CI)), respectively. A p-value<0.05 was considered significant. Results: Among 247 HCW respondents, 67.1% were between 25-44 years old, 56.8% were White, 51.4% were male, 79.7% were clinical HCW (30.5% MD/DO, 22.7% nurses, 25.2% ED technicians), and 63.2% had been tested for SARS-CoV-2. The median PCL-5 score was 10. A higher mean PCL-5 score was observed for clinical vs non-clinical HCW (p<0.0001). Lower PCL-5 scores were observed for males (β=-4.31, p=0.05), while higher scores were observed in association with an increased number of COVID-19-related home problems (β=2.13, p=0.04), LBF score (β= 4.09, p<0.0001) and higher number of people to talk to (β=6.97, p=0.04). A clinically relevant PTSD symptom burden was reported by 16.6% of HCW - 18.3% of clinical HCW vs 3.6% of non-clinical HCW (p=0.0048). Higher odds of clinically relevant PTSD symptoms were observed for ED technicians compared to non-clinical HCW (OR 16.16, 95% CI 1.53-170.46). A clinically relevant PTSD symptom burden was also observed among those reporting increasing COVID-19-related home problems (OR 1.69, 95% CI 1.01-2.83) and LBF score (OR 1.83, 95% CI 1.38-2.44). Conclusions: Almost one in five clinical HCW experienced a clinically relevant PTSD symptom burden during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic. To deepen our understanding of mental health outcomes, create effective interventions, and promote mental health-related policy changes, such as expanding insurance coverage for mental health care and developing more effective wellness programs for HCW, temporal associations between mental health outcomes and associated factors must continue to be investigated.","Apple, S.

This virus accounts for the ongoing outbreak and forces an urgent need to improve antiviral therapeutics and targeted diagnosing tools. Researchers have been working to find a new drug to combat the virus since the outbreak started in late 2019, but there are currently no successful drugs to control the SARS-CoV-2, which makes the situation riskier. Very recently, new variant of SARS-CoV-2 is identified in many countries which make the situation very critical. No successful treatment has yet been shown although enormous international commitment to combat this pandemic and the start of different clinical trials. Nanomedicine has outstanding potential to solve several specific health issues, like viruses, which are regarded a significant medical issue. In this review, we presented an up-to-date drug design strategy against SARS-CoV-2, including the development of novel drugs and repurposed product potentials were useful, and successful drugs discovery is a constant requirement. The use of nanomaterials in treatment against SARS-CoV-2 and their use as carriers for the transport of the most frequently used antiviral therapeutics are discussed systematically here.

After identification of the first confirmed case of COVID‐19 in Pudong on January 21, 2020, the local Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) launched a case investigation involving isolation, close‐contact (CC) tracing and quarantine of persons with a potential exposure risk to prevent and control transmission. Epidemiological features of cases detected by three different strategies were compared to assess the impact of these active surveillance measures. As of February 16, 2020, a total of 108 confirmed COVID‐19 cases had been identified in Pudong, Shanghai. Forty‐five (41.67%) cases were identified through active surveillance measures, with 22 (20.37%) identified by CC tracing and 23 (21.30%) by quarantine of potential exposure populations (PEPs). The average interval from illness onset to the first medical visit was 1 day. Cases identified by CC tracing and PEPs were quarantined for 0.5 and 1 day before illness onset, respectively. The time intervals from illness onset to the first medical visit and isolation among actively screened cases were 2 days (p = .02) and 3 days (p = .00) shorter, respectively, than those among self‐admission cases. Our study highlights the importance of active surveillance for potential COVID‐19 cases, as demonstrated by shortened time intervals from illness onset to both the first medical visit and isolation.

Infection in humans results in a variety of outcomes ranging from asymptomatic cases to the disease COVID-19, which can have significant morbidity and mortality, with over two million confirmed deaths worldwide as of January 2021. Over a year into the pandemic, sequencing analysis has shown that variants of SARS-CoV-2 are being selected as the virus continues to circulate widely within the human population. The predominant drivers of genetic variation within SARS-CoV-2 are single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) caused by polymerase error, potential host factor driven RNA modification, and insertion/deletions (indels) resulting from the discontinuous nature of viral RNA synthesis. While many mutations represent neutral ‘genetic drift’ or have quickly died out, a subset may be affecting viral traits such as transmissibility, pathogenicity, host range, and antigenicity of the virus. In this review, we summarise the current extent of genetic change in SARS-CoV-2, particularly recently emerging variants of concern, and consider the phenotypic consequences of this viral evolution that may impact the future trajectory of the pandemic.","Peacock, Thomas P.; Penrice-Randal, Rebekah; Hiscox, Julian A.; Barclay, Wendy S.",J Gen Virol,127,33

The primary cause of death due to COVID-19 is Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). According to the World Health Organization (WHO), people who are at least 60 years old or have comorbidities that have primarily been targeted are at the highest risk from SARS-CoV-2. Medical imaging provides a non-invasive, touch-free, and relatively safer alternative tool for diagnosis during the current ongoing pandemic. Artificial intelligence (AI) scientists are developing several intelligent computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) tools in multiple imaging modalities, i.e., lung computed tomography (CT), chest X-rays, and lung ultrasounds. These AI tools assist the pulmonary and critical care clinicians through (a) faster detection of the presence of a virus, (b) classifying pneumonia types, and (c) measuring the severity of viral damage in COVID-19-infected patients. Thus, it is of the utmost importance to fully understand the requirements of for a fast and successful, and timely lung scans analysis. This narrative review first presents the pathological layout of the lungs in the COVID-19 scenario, followed by understanding and then explains the comorbid statistical distributions in the ARDS framework. The novelty of this review is the approach to classifying the AI models as per the by school of thought (SoTs), exhibiting based on segregation of techniques and their characteristics. The study also discusses the identification of AI models and its extension from non-ARDS lungs (pre-COVID-19) to ARDS lungs (post-COVID-19). Furthermore, it also presents AI workflow considerations of for medical imaging modalities in the COVID-19 framework. Finally, clinical AI design considerations will be discussed. We conclude that the design of the current existing AI models can be improved by considering comorbidity as an independent factor. Furthermore, ARDS post-processing clinical systems must involve include (i) the clinical validation and verification of AI-models, (ii) reliability and stability criteria, and (iii) easily adaptable, and (iv) generalization assessments of AI systems for their use in pulmonary, critical care, and radiological settings.","Suri, Jasjit S.; Agarwal, Sushant; Gupta, Suneet K.; Puvvula, Anudeep; Biswas, Mainak; Saba, Luca; Bit, Arindam; Tandel, Gopal S.; Agarwal, Mohit; Patrick, Anubhav; Faa, Gavino; Singh, Inder M.; Oberleitner, Ronald; Turk, Monika; Chadha, Paramjit S.; Johri, Amer M.; Sanches, J Miguel; Khanna, Narendra N.; Viskovic, Klaudija; Mavrogeni, Sophie; Laird, John R.; Pareek, Gyan; Miner, Martin; Sobel, David W.; Balestrieri, Antonella; Sfikakis, Petros P.; Tsoulfas, George; Protogerou, Athanasios; Misra, Durga Prasanna; Agarwal, Vikas; Kitas, George D.; Ahluwalia, Puneet; Teji, Jagjit; Al-Maini, Mustafa; Dhanjil, Surinder K.; Sockalingam, Meyypan; Saxena, Ajit; Nicolaides, Andrew; Sharma, Aditya; Rathore, Vijay; Ajuluchukwu, Janet N.A.; Fatemi, Mostafa; Alizad, Azra; Viswanathan, Vijay; Krishnan, P.K.; Naidu, Subbaram",Comput Biol Med,127,19

Treatment of COVID-19 patients with convalescent plasma containing neutralising antibody to SARS-CoV-2 is under investigation as a means of reducing viral loads, ameliorating disease outcomes, and reducing mortality. However, its efficacy might be reduced in those infected with the emerging B.1.1.7 SARS-CoV-2 variant. Here, we report the diverse virological characteristics of UK patients enrolled in the Immunoglobulin Domain of the REMAP-CAP randomised controlled trial. Methods. SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA was detected and quantified by real-time PCR in nasopharyngeal swabs obtained from study subjects within 48 hours of admission to intensive care unit. Antibody status was determined by spike-protein ELISA. B.1.1.7 strain was differentiated from other SARS-CoV-2 strains by two novel typing methods detecting the B.1.1.7-associated D1118H mutation with allele-specific probes and by restriction site polymorphism (SfcI). Findings. Of 1260 subjects, 90% were PCR-positive with viral loads in nasopharyngeal swabs ranging from 72 international units [IUs]/ml to 1.7x10^11 IU/ml. Median viral loads were 45-fold higher in those who were seronegative for IgG antibodies (n=314; 28%) compared to seropositives (n=804; 72%), reflecting in part the latter group's possible later disease stage on enrolment. Frequencies of B.1.1.7 infection increased from early November (<1%) to December 2020 (>60%). Anti-SARS-CoV-2 seronegative individuals infected with wild-type SARS-CoV-2 had significantly higher viral loads than seropositives (medians of 1.2x10^6 and 3.4 x10^4 IU/ml respectively; p=2x10^-9). However, viral load distributions were elevated in both seropositive and seronegative subjects infected with B.1.1.7 (13.4x10^6 and 7.6x10^6 IU/ml; p=0.18). Interpretation. High viral loads in seropositive B.1.1.7-infected subjects are consistent with increased replication capacity and/or less effective clearance by innate or adaptive immune response of B.1.1.7 strain than wild-type. As viral genotype was associated with diverse virological and immunological phenotypes, metrics of viral load, antibody status and infecting strain should be used to define subgroups for analysis of treatment efficacy.","Ratcliff, J.; Nguyen, D.; Fish, M.; Rhynne, J.; Jennings, A.; Williams, S.; Al-Beidh, F.; Bonsall, D.; Ciccone, N.; Evans, A.; Golubchik, T.; Gordon, A.

This study aimed to evaluate the association between metformin use and clinical outcomes in DM patients with COVID-19. Methods This retrospective study was based on claims data. All diseases, including COVID-19, were defined using International Classification of Diseases 10th Revision (ICD-10) codes. Patients were divided into three groups depending on metformin use: CON (those not taking DM medication); N-MFOM (those taking DM medications other than metformin); and MFOM (those taking metformin for DM). Ultimately, 1865 patients were included; CON, N-MFOM and MFOM groups comprised 1301, 95 and 469 patients, respectively. Results Kaplan–Meier analyses showed that MFOM patients had poorer survival rates than those in the CON group, but there were no significant differences in survival rates between MFOM and N-MFOM groups. Multivariate Cox regression analyses revealed more favourable survival in CON than in N-MFOM patients, but there was no statistically significant difference in MFOM vs the other groups. Also, there were no significant differences in rates of use of inotropes, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, conventional oxygen therapy, high-flow nasal cannulas or mechanical ventilators, nor in the rates of acute kidney injury or cardiac events across all study groups. Conclusion No definite association could be found between metformin use and clinical outcomes, including survival. However, given the disproportionate participant numbers in our groups and small number of events, further studies are needed to determine whether the use of metformin has favourable or unfavourable effects in DM patients with COVID-19.","Do, Jun Young; Kim, Sang Won; Park, Jong Won; Cho, Kyu Hyang; Kang, Seok Hui",Diabetes Metab,127,1

This study examined SGM young adult disparities in health-related behaviors to cope with isolation during the pandemic. METHODS: Respondents from a prospective cohort of Southern California young adults (N = 2,298) reported whether they engaged in various strategies (e.g., substance use, diet, exercise, relaxation) to cope with isolation during the pandemic (each: yes/no). Differences in coping were assessed across five SGM subgroups: heterosexual men and women, lesbian, gay, bisexual, pansexual, queer (LGBQ) men and women, transgender/nonbinary (TNB) respondents. Negative binomial regressions estimated sexual/gender identity differences in the number of positive or negative behaviors endorsed, adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics and prepandemic health behaviors. Differences were also tested across individual coping behaviors. RESULTS: Heterosexual women (IRR = 1.11 [1.01–1.21]), LGBQ men (IRR = 1.31 [1.12–1.54]), LGBQ women (IRR = 1.33 [1.19–1.49]), and TNB respondents (IRR = 1.29 [1.03–1.61]) engaged in more negative coping behaviors than heterosexual men. LGBQ men (IRR = 1.19 [1.02–1.39]) and LGBQ women (IRR = 1.20 [1.08–1.34]) also reported more negative coping behaviors versus heterosexual women. Generally, LGBQ men reported the highest prevalence of substance use, while LGBQ women and TNB reported the highest prevalence of adverse eating behaviors and self-harm. CONCLUSIONS: SGM young adults may be disproportionately, adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Long-living individuals (LLIs) are less susceptible to inflammation and develop more resiliency to COVID-19. As demonstrated, LLIs are characterized by high circulating levels of BPIFB4, a protein involved in homeostatic response to inflammatory stimuli. Also, LLIs show enrichment of homozygous genotype for the minor alleles of a 4 missense single-nucleotide polymorphism haplotype (longevity-associated variant [LAV]) in BPIFB4, able to counteract progression of diseases in animal models. Thus, the present study was designed to assess the presence and significance of BPIFB4 level in COVID-19 patients and the potential therapeutic use of LAV-BPIFB4 in fighting COVID-19. BPIFB4 plasma concentration was found significantly higher in LLIs compared to old healthy controls while it significantly decreased in 64 COVID-19 patients. Further, the drop in BPIFB4 values correlated with disease severity. Accordingly to the LAV-BPIFB4 immunomodulatory role, while lysates of SARS-CoV-2-infected cells induced an inflammatory response in healthy peripheral blood mononuclear cells in vitro, the co-treatment with recombinant protein (rh) LAV-BPIFB4 resulted in a protective and self-limiting reaction, culminating in the downregulation of CD69 activating-marker for T cells (both TCD4+ and TCD8+) and in MCP-1 reduction. On the contrary, rhLAV-BPIFB4 induced a rapid increase in IL-18 and IL-1b levels, shown largely protective during the early stages of the virus infection. This evidence, along with the ability of rhLAV-BPIFB4 to counteract the cytotoxicity induced by SARS-CoV-2 lysate in selected target cell lines, corroborates BPIFB4 prognostic value and open new therapeutic possibilities in more vulnerable people.","Ciaglia, Elena; Lopardo, Valentina; Montella, Francesco; Sellitto, Carmine; Manzo, Valentina; De Bellis, Emanuela; Iannaccone, Teresa; Franci, Gianluigi; Zannella, Carla; Pagliano, Pasquale; Di Pietro, Paola; Carrizzo, Albino; Vecchione, Carmine; Conti, Valeria; Filippelli, Amelia; Puca, Annibale Alessandro",J Gerontol A Biol Sci Med Sci,127,21

We performed a retrospective cardiopathological analysis of the heart and vasculature from 23 autopsies of COVID‐19 patients, comparing the findings with control tissue. Myocardium from autopsies of COVID‐19 patients was categorised into severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) positive (n = 14) or negative (n = 9) based on the presence of viral RNA as determined by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT‐PCR). Control tissue was selected from autopsies without COVID‐19 (n = 10) with similar clinical sequelae. Histological characteristics were scored by ordinal and/or categorical grading. Five RT‐PCR‐positive cases underwent in situ hybridisation (ISH) for SARS‐CoV‐2. Patients with lethal COVID‐19 infection were mostly male (78%) and had a high incidence of hypertension (91%), coronary artery disease (61%), and diabetes mellitus (48%). Patients with positive myocardial RT‐PCR died earlier after hospital admission (5 versus 12 days, p < 0.001) than patients with negative RT‐PCR. An increased severity of fibrin deposition, capillary dilatation, and microhaemorrhage was observed in RT‐PCR‐positive myocardium than in negatives and controls, with a positive correlation amongst these factors All cases with increased cardioinflammatory infiltrate, without myocyte necrosis (n = 4) or with myocarditis (n = 1), were RT‐PCR negative. ISH revealed positivity of viral RNA in interstitial cells. Myocardial capillary dilatation, fibrin deposition, and microhaemorrhage may be the histomorphological correlate of COVID‐19‐associated coagulopathy. Increased cardioinflammation including one case of myocarditis was only detected in RT‐PCR‐negative hearts with significantly longer hospitalisation time.

Here we present CO(2) concentration and carbon isotopic (δ(13)C) measurements to assess the impact of COVID-19 control measures on atmospheric CO(2) in Xi’an, China. We find that CO(2) concentrations during the lockdown period were 7.5% lower than during the normal period (prior to the Spring Festival, 25 Jan to 4 Feb 2020). The observed CO(2)(excess) (total CO(2) minus background CO(2)) during the lockdown period was 52.3% lower than that during the normal period, and 35.7% lower than the estimated CO(2)(excess) with the effect of weather removed. A Keeling plot shows that in contrast CO(2) concentrations and δ(13)C were weakly correlated (R(2)=0.18) during the lockdown period, reflecting a change in CO(2) sources imposed by the curtailment of traffic and industrial emissions. Our study also show that the sharp reduction in atmospheric CO(2) during lockdown were short-lived, and returned to normal levels within months after lockdown measures were lifted.","Wu, Shugang; Zhou, Weijian; Xiong, Xiaohu; Burr, G.S.; Cheng, Peng; Wang, Peng; Niu, Zhenchuan; Hou, Yaoyao",Environ Res,127,20

For Europe and Middle East regions, we predict the cumulative number of cases, and for Mainland China we predict daily new cases and the cumulative number of deaths. We predict the next 10 days based on the previously reported actual time series data of Covid-19. For worldwide forecasts, we use the data provided by Worldometers. For Europe and Middle East forecasts, we use the data provided by World Health Organization, and for China Mainland forecasts, the data is obtained from Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention. This is the first time that a deep learning model has been employed for Covid-19 spread prediction, solely based on the known reported cases of Covid-19. The proposed deep learning architecture consists of Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) layer, dropout layer, and fully connected layers to predict regional and worldwide forecasts. We evaluate our approach with Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) metric. For forecasting, we use the network models that give the minimum RMSE on the last 3 days of actual data. Networks, which achieves the minimum RMSE on the last 3 days, are used to predict the next 10 days. Every day, the spread and situations are changing. Our approach can take into account these real-time changes; the deep learning model can be re-trained with new daily data and perform real-time forecasting. Results show that the proposed deep learning model is promising, it can predict possible scenarios regionally and globally for the spread of Covid-19.","Direkoglu, C.; Sah, M.",,127,1

In response to this ongoing shortage, we began production of VTM in-house in support of diagnostic testing in our hospital network. As our diagnostic laboratory was not equipped for reagent production, we took advantage of space and personnel that became available due to closure of the research division of our medical center. We utilized a formulation of VTM described by the CDC that was simple to produce, did not require filtration for sterilization, and used reagents that were available from commercial suppliers. Performance of VTM was evaluated by several quality assurance measures. Based on Ct values of spiking experiments, we found that our VTM supported highly consistent amplification of the SARS-CoV-2 target (coefficient of variation = 2.95%) using the Abbott RealTime SARS-CoV-2 EUA assay on the Abbott m2000 platform. VTM was also found to be compatible with multiple swab types and, based on accelerated stability studies, able to maintain functionality for at least four months at room temperature. We further discuss how we met logistical challenges associated with large-scale VTM production in a crisis setting including use of staged, assembly line for VTM transport tube production.","Smith, Kenneth P.; Cheng, Annie; Chopelas, Amber; DuBois-Coyne, Sarah; Mezghani, Ikram; Rodriguez, Shade; Talay, Mustafa; Kirby, James E.",medRxiv,127,24

RAS dysregulation is one of the major characteristics of several cardiovascular diseases, thus adjustment of this system is the main therapeutic target. RAS inhibitors – particularly angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers (ARBs) – are commonly used for treatment of hypertension and cardiovascular disease. Patients with cardiovascular diseases are the group most commonly seen amongst those with COVID-19 comorbidity. At the beginning of this pandemic, a dilemma occurred regarding the use of ACEIs and ARBs potentially aggravating cardiovascular and pulmonary dysfunction in COVID-19 patients. Urgent clinical trials from different countries and hospitals reported that there is no association between RAS inhibitor treatment and COVID-19 infection or comorbidity complication. Nevertheless, the disturbance of the RAS system that is associated with COVID-19 infection and the potential treatment targeting this area has yet to be resolved. In this review, the link between the dysregulation of classical RAS and counter-regulatory RAS activities in COVID-19 patients with cardiovascular metabolic diseases is investigated. In addition, the latest findings based on ACEIs and ARBs administration and ACE-2 availability in relation to COVID-19 which may provide a better understanding of RAS contribution to COVID-19 pathology is discussed as it is of the utmost importance amid the current pandemic.","Almutlaq, Moudhi; Alamro, Abir Abdullah; Alroqi, Fayhan; Barhoumi, Tlili",CJC Open,127,16

Using an online survey with 1669 respondents, we sought to understand why and how by querying about perceived barriers and motivators to physical activity that changed because of the pandemic, and how those changes impacted mental health. Consistent with prior reports, our respondents were less physically active (aerobic activity, −11%, p <0.05; strength-based activity, −30%, p<0.01) and more sedentary (+11%, p<0.01) during the pandemic as compared to 6-months before. The pandemic also increased psychological stress (+22%, p <0.01) and brought on moderate symptoms of anxiety and depression. Respondents’ whose mental health deteriorated the most were also the ones who were least active (depression r = −.21, p<0.01; anxiety r = −.12, p<0.01). The majority of respondents were unmotivated to exercise because they were too anxious (+8%, p <0.01), lacked social support (+6%, p =<0.01), or had limited access to equipment (+23%, p <0.01) or space (+41%, p <0.01). The respondents who were able to stay active reported feeling less motivated by physical health outcomes such as weight loss (−7%, p<0.01) or strength (−14%, p<0.01) and instead more motivated by mental health outcomes such as anxiety relief (+14%, p <0.01). Coupled with previous work demonstrating a direct relationship between mental health and physical activity, these results highlight the potential protective effect of physical activity on mental health and point to the need for psychological support to overcome perceived barriers so that people can continue to be physically active during stressful times like the pandemic.","Marashi, Maryam; Nicholson, Emma; Ogrodnik, Michelle; Fenesi, Barbara; Heisz, Jennifer",bioRxiv,127,14

To investigate whether leukocytes could participate in respiratory pathologies and serve as vector for viral spread towards other tissues, the susceptibility of human leukocytic cell lines and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) to HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 infection was investigated. Human primary monocytes/macrophages were susceptible to HCoV-229E infection, but strongly restricted HCoV-OC43 replication. Moreover, productive HCoV-229E infection of primary monocytes and of the THP-1 monocytic cell line led to their activation, as indicated by the production of pro-inflammatory mediators, including TNF-α, CCL5, CXCL10 and CXCL11 and MMP-9. Moreover, an in vitro chemotaxis assay showed that motility towards chemokines of THP-1 cells and primary monocytes was increased following an acute or persistent HCoV-229E infection. Taken together, these results suggest that infected monocytes could serve as a reservoir for HCoV-229E, become activated, participate in the exacerbation of pulmonary pathologies, as well as serve as potential vectors for viral dissemination to host tissues, where it could be associated with other pathologies.","Desforges, Marc; Miletti, Tina C.; Gagnon, Mylène; Talbot, Pierre J.",Virus Res,127,5

We sought to apply open-source product development to PAPRs to enable alternative sources of supply and further innovation. We describe the design, prototyping, validation, and user testing of locally manufactured, modular, PAPR components, including filter cartridges and blower units, developed by the Greater Boston Pandemic Fabrication Team (PanFab). Two designs, one with a fully custom-made filter and blower unit housing, and the other with commercially available variants (the “Custom” and “Commercial” designs respectively) were developed. Engineering performance of the prototypes was measured and safety validated using NIOSH-equivalent tests on apparatus available under pandemic conditions, at university laboratories. Feedback on designs was obtained from four individuals, including two clinicians working in an ambulatory clinical setting and two research technical staff for whom PAPR use is a standard part of occupational PPE. Respondents rated the PanFab Custom PAPR a 4 to 5 on a 5 Likert-scale 1) as compared to current PPE options, 2) for the sense of security with use in a clinical setting, and 3) for comfort. The three other versions of the designs (with a commercial blower unit, filter, or both) performed favorably, with survey responses consisting of scores ranging from 3–5.

There is currently no vaccine to prevent COVID-19 or therapeutic agent to treat COVID-19. This clinical trial is designed to evaluate chloroquine as a potential therapeutic for the treatment of hospitalised people with COVID-19. We hypothesise that chloroquine slows viral replication in patients with COVID-19, attenuating the infection, and resulting in more rapid decline of viral load in throat/nose swabs. This viral attenuation should be associated with improved patient outcomes. Method: The study will start with a 10-patient prospective observational pilot study following the same entry and exclusion criteria as for the randomized trial and undergoing the same procedures. The main study is an open label, randomised, controlled trial with two parallel arms of standard of care (control arm) versus standard of care with 10 days of chloroquine (intervention arm) with a loading dose over the first 24 hours, followed by 300mg base orally once daily for nine days. The study will recruit patients in three sites in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam: the Hospital for Tropical Diseases, the Cu Chi Field Hospital, and the Can Gio COVID hospital. The primary endpoint is the time to viral clearance from throat/nose swab, defined as the time following randomization until the midpoint between the last positive and the first of the negative throat/nose swabs. Viral presence will be determined using RT-PCR to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Discussion: The results of the study will add to the evidence-based guidelines for management of COVID-19. Given the enormous experience of its use in malaria chemoprophylaxis, excellent safety and tolerability profile, and its very low cost, if proved effective then chloroquine would be a readily deployable and affordable treatment for patients with COVID-19.

This paper evaluates the impacts of COVID-19 related policies, including the lockdown and the first lockdown ease on the usage of public bicycle share in London using interrupted time series approach. Our results indicate that the UK’s lockdown led to an immediate decrease in the London Cycle Hire (LCH) usage, while the first lockdown ease had no statistically significant immediate impacts. Moreover, during the lockdown period, the LCH usage showed an increasing trend and the first lockdown ease led to a much larger increase rate. Such impacts vary by the trip characteristics (i.e., occurring period and trip duration). The morning peak trips and short duration trips maintained a lower usage level during the lockdown and the lockdown ease period. On the contrary, the number of other LCH trips were much larger than that in normal days. Furthermore, the impacts on the LCH stations near the rail stations, hospitals, and parks also varied differently. The LCH trips near the rail stations reduced more after the imposition of the lockdown policy while those near the hospitals reduced less. The LCH stations near the parks had a much higher increase rate during the lockdown and the lockdown ease period than the general level.

METHODS: A cross-sectional study of adults (18+ years old) was conducted using an online, multi-language, international survey between March 31 and May 15, 2020. Simple and moderated mediation analyses were performed using the PROCESS macro for SPSS, with perceived social isolation as an independent variable, change in perceived sleep quality (during vs. before the COVID-19 pandemic) as a dependent variable, depressed and anxious mood (Patient Health Questionnaire-4, PHQ-4) as a mediator, and resilience (Brief Resilience Scale, BRS) as a moderator. RESULTS: A convenience sample of 3816 participants (2692 = female) from 94 countries (47.4% USA) met criteria for inclusion in the analyses. Results showed that depressed and anxious mood mediated the relationship between perceived social isolation and change in perceived sleep quality. This mediation was moderated by resilience; the indirect effect of perceived social isolation on change in perceived sleep quality through depressed and anxious mood decreased as the level of resilience increased (index of moderated mediation = 0.008, SE = 0.003, 95%CI [0.001; 0.014]).

CoVs encode several innate immune antagonists that interact with the host innate immune response to facilitate efficient viral replication. CoV non-structural protein 14 (nsp14) encodes 3'-to-5' exoribonuclease activity (ExoN), which performs a proofreading function and is required for high-fidelity replication. Outside of the order Nidovirales, arenaviruses are the only RNA viruses that encode an ExoN, which functions to degrade dsRNA replication intermediates. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that CoV ExoN may also function to antagonize the innate immune response. We demonstrate that viruses lacking ExoN activity [ExoN(-)] are sensitive to cellular pretreatment with interferon beta (IFN-β) in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, ExoN(-) virus replication was attenuated in wild-type bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs) and partially restored in interferon alpha/beta receptor deficient (IFNAR-/-) BMMs. ExoN(-) virus replication did not result in IFN-β gene expression, and in the presence of an IFN-β-mediated antiviral state, ExoN(-) viral RNA levels were not substantially reduced relative to untreated. However, ExoN(-) virus generated from IFN-β pretreated cells had reduced specific infectivity and decreased relative fitness, suggesting that ExoN(-) virus generated during an antiviral state is less viable to establish a subsequent infection. Overall, our data suggest MHV ExoN activity is required for resistance to the innate immune response and antiviral mechanisms affecting the viral RNA sequence and/or an RNA modification act on viruses lacking ExoN activity.","Case, James Brett; Li, Yize; Elliott, Ruth; Lu, Xiaotao; Graepel, Kevin W.; Sexton, Nicole R.; Smith, Everett Clinton; Weiss, Susan R.; Denison, Mark R.",bioRxiv,127,16

Our mixed-methods study draws on 4,026 online survey responses collected between April – September 2020 across five states (Louisiana, Montana, North Carolina, Oregon and West Virginia). Logistic regression models were run for two outcome variables (physical activity and mental health status (measured using the Kessler Psychological Distress scale)). Researchers controlled for race/ethnicity, household income/size, gender, urbanicity, education, employment, use of government assistance and presence of chronic health conditions. Qualitative analysis was applied to open-ended survey responses to contextualize quantitative findings. Household income was significant in predicting difficulty maintaining pre-pandemic physical activity levels; pre-pandemic physical activity levels were associated with increased psychological distress levels during COVID-19; and race/ethnicity, income status and urbanicity were significantly associated with deteriorating mental health status and physical activity levels during COVID-19. Data suggests that a bi-directional, cyclical relationship between physical activity and mental health exists. Policy implications should include physical activity promotion as a protective factor against declining mental health.","Grocke-Dewey, Michelle; Hardison-Moody, Annie; Haynes-Maslow, Lindsey; Maras, Shelly; Webber, Eliza; Andress, Lauri; Houghtaling, Bailey; Patton-Lopez, Megan; Shanks, Justin; Byker-Shanks, Carmen",Prev Med Rep,127,6

NAVs result from different etiologies which include collagenopathies, immunological, hematological, and infection mechanisms, and other rarer unidentifiable or idiopathic causes. NAV etiologies account for about 10–15% and 20–25% of adult and pediatric stroke cases, respectively, and therefore, diagnosing the underlying cause of NAV becomes clinically very important. Clinical diagnosis of NAV is challenging because the clinical presentation is very non-specific and overlapping with various other central nervous system disorders. Before the advent of non-invasive techniques, making a diagnosis of non-atherosclerotic vasculopathy as a cause of the stroke was very challenging. Today with newer techniques such as high-resolution magnetic resonance (MR), MR and computed tomography perfusion, and angiogram, there are number of pointers which can give us a lead about the non-atherosclerotic causes. Imaging may provide the first lead to the clinician regarding the diagnosis or possible differential diagnosis so that the targeted and focused biomarkers (blood, cerebrospinal fluid, or/and in some cases biopsies) may be obtained to clinch the diagnoses. The purpose of the article is to enumerate the causes, clinical features, and illustrate the imaging findings of the various non-atherosclerotic vasculopathic disorders and discuss “pearls” to their diagnosis. In this article, we have also discussed the latest advances in vascular imaging and elaborated on few uncommon non-atherosclerotic vasculopathies.

OBJECTIVES: The objectives of the study were to evaluate pharmacological treatment patterns by COVID-19 severity and identify the determinants of prescribing for COVID-19. METHODS: Using electronic health record data from a large Massachusetts-based healthcare system, we identified all patients aged ≥ 18 years hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from 1 March to 24 May, 2020. We defined five levels of COVID-19 severity at hospital admission: (1) hospitalized but not requiring supplemental oxygen; (2–4) hospitalized and requiring oxygen ≤ 2, 3–4, and ≥ 5 L per minute, respectively; and (5) intubated or admitted to an intensive care unit. We assessed the medications used to treat COVID-19 or as supportive care during hospitalization. RESULTS: Among 2821 patients hospitalized for COVID-19, we found inpatient mortality increased by severity from 5% for level 1 to 23% for level 5. As compared to patients with severity level 1, those with severity level 5 were 3.53 times (95% confidence interval 2.73–4.57) more likely to receive a medication used to treat COVID-19. Other predictors of treatment were fever, low oxygen saturation, presence of co-morbidities, and elevated inflammatory biomarkers. The use of most COVID-19 relevant medications has dropped substantially while the use of remdesivir and therapeutic anticoagulants has increased over the study period.

The primary objective of the study was to evaluate attitudes and behaviors of licensed physicians in the region to telemedicine. Methodology: A cross-sectional design using an electronic survey as the primary tool was done. The questionnaire had a demographic component of the respondent (first part), covering age, specialty, and experience with telemedicine during the COVID pandemic, and a second part, which was in the form of a Likert scale, covering perceptions related to telemedicine. The Likert scale itself had two main areas: (1) attitudes toward telemedicine and (2) perceived barriers. Results: There were 392 valid responses of which 228 (58.1%) had used some form of telemedicine (other than standard phone calls) during the COVID-19 pandemic. The most common platforms used for telemedicine include WhatsApp(®) (211, 53.8%), Zoom(®) (131, 33.4%), Microsoft Teams(®) (27, 6.2%), Sehha App (65, 16.5%), Email (84, 21.4%). There was a strong agreement on the following statements: “Telemedicine can reduce unnecessary outpatient visits” (87.5%), “Effectiveness of telemedicine depends on the specialty” (89.5%), and “Telemedicine can be used to monitor chronic patients from home” (88.3%). Concerning the barriers to telemedicine, the ones having the most concordance were technological limitations (66.6%) and concerns of diagnostic reliability (66.1%). Conclusions: The responses from our study seem to suggest that while the attitudes toward telemedicine are positive, practicing physicians are concerned about a perceived lack of clarity regarding related legal frameworks and barriers such as technological issues, cultural factors, and diagnostic concordance.","Kaliyadan, Feroze; A.

In the product development setting, successful data sharing is defined as data sharing that is actionable and facilitates decision making during the development and review of medical products. This often occurs through the creation of new product development tools or methodologies, such as novel clinical trial design and enrichment strategies, predictive pre-clinical and clinical models, clinical trial simulation tools, biomarkers, and clinical outcomes assessments, and more. METHODS: To be successful, extensive partnerships must be established between all relevant stakeholders, including industry, academia, research institutes and societies, patient-advocacy groups, and governmental agencies, and a neutral third-party convening organization that can provide a pre-competitive space for data sharing to occur. CONCLUSIONS: Data sharing focused on identified regulatory deliverables that improve the medical product development process encounters significant challenges that are not seen with data sharing aimed at advancing clinical decision making and requires the commitment of all stakeholders. Regulatory data sharing challenges and solutions, as well as multiple examples of previous successful data sharing initiatives are presented and discussed in the context of medical product development.","Karpen, Stephen R.; White, J.

Machine learning methods can play a vital role in the diagnosis of COVID-19 by processing chest x-ray images. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to summarize information on the use of intelligent models for the diagnosis and prognosis of COVID-19 to help with early and timely diagnosis, minimize prolonged diagnosis, and improve overall health care. METHODS: A systematic search of databases, including PubMed, Web of Science, IEEE, ProQuest, Scopus, bioRxiv, and medRxiv, was performed for COVID-19–related studies published up to May 24, 2020. This study was performed in accordance with the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses) guidelines. All original research articles describing the application of image processing for the prediction and diagnosis of COVID-19 were considered in the analysis. Two reviewers independently assessed the published papers to determine eligibility for inclusion in the analysis. Risk of bias was evaluated using the Prediction Model Risk of Bias Assessment Tool. RESULTS: Of the 629 articles retrieved, 44 articles were included. We identified 4 prognosis models for calculating prediction of disease severity and estimation of confinement time for individual patients, and 40 diagnostic models for detecting COVID-19 from normal or other pneumonias. Most included studies used deep learning methods based on convolutional neural networks, which have been widely used as a classification algorithm. The most frequently reported predictors of prognosis in patients with COVID-19 included age, computed tomography data, gender, comorbidities, symptoms, and laboratory findings. Deep convolutional neural networks obtained better results compared with non–neural network–based methods. Moreover, all of the models were found to be at high risk of bias due to the lack of information about the study population, intended groups, and inappropriate reporting. CONCLUSIONS: Machine learning models used for the diagnosis and prognosis of COVID-19 showed excellent discriminative performance. However, these models were at high risk of bias, because of various reasons such as inadequate information about study participants, randomization process, and the lack of external validation, which may have resulted in the optimistic reporting of these models. Hence, our findings do not recommend any of the current models to be used in practice for the diagnosis and prognosis of COVID-19.","Montazeri, Mahdieh; ZahediNasab, Roxana; Farahani, Ali; Mohseni, Hadis; Ghasemian, Fahimeh",JMIR Med Inform,127,3

An extremely high potential for dissemination resulted in the global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in 2020. Despite the worsening trends of COVID-19, no drugs are validated to have significant efficacy in clinical treatment of COVID-19 patients in large-scale studies. Remdesivir is considered the most promising antiviral agent; it works by inhibiting the activity of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). A large-scale study investigating the clinical efficacy of remdesivir (200 mg on day 1, followed by 100 mg once daily) is on-going. The other excellent anti-influenza RdRp inhibitor favipiravir is also being clinically evaluated for its efficacy in COVID-19 patients. The protease inhibitor lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/RTV) alone is not shown to provide better antiviral efficacy than standard care. However, the regimen of LPV/RTV plus ribavirin was shown to be effective against SARS-CoV in vitro. Another promising alternative is hydroxychloroquine (200 mg thrice daily) plus azithromycin (500 mg on day 1, followed by 250 mg once daily on day 2–5), which showed excellent clinical efficacy on Chinese COVID-19 patients and anti-SARS-CoV-2 potency in vitro. The roles of teicoplanin (which inhibits the viral genome exposure in cytoplasm) and monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 are under investigation.

We used logistic regression to evaluate the association between PM(2.5) exposure and hospitalizations for COVID-19, adjusting for socioeconomic characteristics and comorbidities. RESULTS: Among the 1,128 patients included in our study, the mean (standard deviation) PM(2.5) was 11.34 (0.70) μg/m(3) for the 10-year average exposure and 13.83 (1.03) μg/m(3) for the 10-year maximal exposures. The association between long-term PM(2.5) exposure and hospitalization for COVID-19 was contingent upon having pre-existing asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary (COPD) (P(interaction)=0.030 for average PM(2.5) and P(interaction)=0.001 for maximal PM(2.5)).

A retrospective study of placentas from COVID positive women received in the Department of Pathology, Monmouth Medical Center affiliate of Robert Wood Johnson Barnabas Health were examined and compared to control cohort of placentas from COVID negative women. The mothers were tested for coronavirus through nasopharyngeal swab upon admission to labor and delivery. The placentas from mothers who tested negative for the virus were sent to Pathology for examination based on the obstetrician’s clinical judgment. Results Fifty surgical specimens (49 placentas and one product of conception) from patients positive for COVID-19 were examined and compared with fifty placentas from women with negative COVID-19 test results, who delivered during the same period. Most of the neonates had Appearance, Pulse, Grimace, Activity and Respiration (APGAR) scores of 9 and 9 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively. Increased incidence of the COVID-19 positivity was noted in individuals with Rh-positive blood group A and Jewish heritage. Compared to the control group, the COVID-19 positive placentas showed increased features of malperfusion (microcalcifications, fibrin thrombi, syncytial knotting, and villous agglutination). However, there was no significant dysregulation in other variables, such as inflammation or coagulation. There was no case of maternal or fetal death (greater than eight weeks) or evidence of worse fetal outcomes noted due to a mother's positive COVID-19 status. Conclusions The COVID-19 positive placentas showed an increased prevalence of microcalcifications and fibrin thrombi, which may reflect an underlying hypercoagulable state induced by COVID-19 infection or could be due to excessive syncytiotrophoblast injury.","Singh, Natasha; Buckley, Tinera; Shertz, Wendy",Cureus,127,6

Therefore, regulation of cellular levels of 2-5A is a key point of control in antiviral innate immunity. Cellular 2-5A levels are determined by IFN-inducible 2’,5’-oligoadenylate synthetases (OASs) and by enzymes that degrade 2-5A. Importantly, many coronaviruses and rotaviruses encode 2-5A degrading enzymes thereby antagonizing RNase L and its antiviral effects. A-kinase anchoring protein 7 (AKAP7), a mammalian counterpart, could possibly limit tissue damage from excessive or prolonged RNase L activation during viral infections or from self double-stranded-RNAs that activate OAS. We show these enzymes, members of the two-histidine-phosphoesterase (2H-PE) superfamily, constitute a sub-family referred here as 2’,5’-PEs. 2’,5’-PEs from mouse coronavirus (CoV) MHV (NS2), MERS-CoV (NS4b), group A rotavirus (VP3), and mouse (AKAP7) were investigated for their evolutionary relationships and activities. While there was no activity against 3’,5’-oligoribonucleotides, all cleaved 2’,5’-oligoadenylates efficiently, but with variable activity against other 2’,5’-oligonucleotides. The 2’,5’-PEs are shown to be metal ion-independent enzymes that cleave trimer 2-5A (2’,5’-p3A3) producing mono- or di- adenylates with 2’,3’-cyclic phosphate termini. Our results suggest that elimination of 2-5A might be the sole function of viral 2’,5’-PEs, thereby promoting viral escape from innate immunity by preventing or limiting the activation of RNase L. IMPORTANCE Viruses often encode accessory proteins that antagonize the host antiviral immune response. Here we probed the evolutionary relationships and biochemical activities of two-histidine-phosphoesterases (2H-PEs) that allow some coronaviruses and rotaviruses to counteract antiviral innate immunity. In addition, we investigated the mammalian enzyme, AKAP7, which has homology and shared activities with the viral enzymes and might reduce self-injury. These viral and host enzymes, that we refer to as 2’,5’-PEs, specifically degrade 2’,5’-oligoadenylate activators of the antiviral enzyme RNase L. We show that the host and viral enzymes are metal ion independent and exclusively cleave 2’,5’- and not 3’,5’-phosphodiester bonds, producing cleavage products with cyclic 2’,3’-phosphate termini. Our study defines 2’,5’-PEs as enzymes that share characteristic conserved features with the 2H-PE superfamily but which have specific and distinct biochemical cleavage activities. These findings may eventually lead to pharmacologic strategies for developing antiviral drugs against coronaviruses, rotaviruses, and other viruses.","Asthana, Abhishek; Gaughan, Christina; Weiss, Susan R.; Silverman, Robert H.",bioRxiv,127,20

Main outcome measures: OSA diagnosis, information concerning COVID-19 infection such as hospitalization, were derived from Finnish National Hospital Discharge Registry, Causes of Death Registry and the National Infectious Diseases Registry. Results: We show that OSA is a risk factor for COVID-19 hospitalization independent from age, sex, body mass index (BMI), hypertension, diabetes, coronary heart disease (CHD), asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), (p-unadjusted=1.04x10^-4, OR-adjusted=5.24 [95%CI 1.33 to 23.43], p-adjusted=0.022). OSA was not associated with the risk of contracting COVID-19 (p=0.49). Conclusion: While an OSA patients risk of contracting COVID-19 is the same as non-OSA individuals, the OSA patients have a five-fold risk to be hospitalized when affected by COVID-19 than non-OSA individuals. Our findings suggest that, in assessment of patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection, OSA needs to be recognized as one of the comorbidity risk factors for developing a severe form of the disease.","Strausz, S.; Kiiskinen, T.; Broberg, M.; Ruotsalainen, S.; Koskela, J.; Bachour, A.; Palotie, A.; Palotie, T.; Ripatti, S.; Ollila, H.

In the past decade, network medicine had developed a framework consisting of a series of quantitative approaches and predictive tools to study host-pathogen interactions, unveil the molecular mechanisms of the infection, identify comorbidities as well as rapidly detect drug repurpusing candidates. Here, we adapt the network-based toolset to COVID-19, recovering the primary pulmonary manifestations of the virus in the lung as well as observed comorbidities associated with cardiovascular diseases. We predict that the virus can manifest itself in other tissues, such as the reproductive system, and brain regions, moreover we predict neurological comorbidities. We build on these findings to deploy three network-based drug repurposing strategies, relying on network proximity, diffusion, and AI-based metrics, allowing to rank all approved drugs based on their likely efficacy for COVID-19 patients, aggregate all predictions, and, thereby to arrive at 81 promising repurposing candidates. We validate the accuracy of our predictions using drugs currently in clinical trials, and an expression-based validation of selected candidates suggests that these drugs, with known toxicities and side effects, could be moved to clinical trials rapidly.","Gysi, Deisy Morselli; Do Valle, Ítalo; Zitnik, Marinka; Ameli, Asher; Gan, Xiao; Varol, Onur; Sanchez, Helia; Baron, Rebecca Marlene; Ghiassian, Dina; Loscalzo, Joseph; Barabási, Albert-László",ArXiv,127,20

The assay’s specificity utilised unique single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) identified among Orthopoxvirus (OPV) orthologs of the vaccinia virus Copenhagen strain A13L and A36R genes. When a variola virus specific primer was used with a consensus primer in an ARMS assay with different Orthopoxvirus genomes, a PCR product was only amplified from variola virus DNA. Incorporating a second consensus primer into the assay produced a multiplex PCR that provided Orthopoxvirus generic and variola-specific products with variola virus DNA. We tested two single nucleotide polymorphisms with a panel of 43 variola virus strains, collected over 40 years from countries across the world, and have shown that they provide reliable markers for variola virus identification. The variola virus specific primers did not produce amplicons with either assay format when tested with 50 other Orthopoxvirus DNA samples. Our analysis shows that these two polymorphisms were conserved in variola virus genomes and provide a reliable signature of Orthopoxvirus species identification.","Pulford, David; Meyer, Hermann; Brightwell, Gale; Damon, Inger; Kline, Richard; Ulaeto, David",J Virol Methods,127,16

Mutations in the virus genome can complicate attempts at accurate testing or developing a working treatment for the disease. Furthermore, because the virus uses its own proteins to replicate its genome, rather than host proteins, mutations in the replication proteins can have cascading effects on the mutation load of the virus genome. Due to the global, rapidly developing nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, local demographics of the virus can be difficult to accurately analyze and track, disproportionate to the importance of such information. Here, we analyzed available, high-quality genome data of SARS-CoV-2 isolates from Turkey and identified their mutations, in comparison to the reference genome, to understand how the local mutatome compares to the global genomes. Our results indicate that viral genomes in Turkey has one of the highest mutation loads and certain mutations are remarkably frequent compared to global genomes. We also made the data on Turkey isolates available on an online database to facilitate further research on SARS-CoV-2 mutations in Turkey.","ESKİER, Doğa; AKALP, Evren; DALAN, Özlem; KARAKÜLAH, Gökhan; OKTAY, Yavuz",Turk J Biol,127,26

RESULTS: Overall, almost three quarters (71%) of the participants chose the 80-year-old patient with a diagnosis of AD to be the last to be provided with a ventilator. The preferences of the remaining quarter were divided between the 80-year-old person who was cognitively intact and the 55-year-old person with AD.

This study investigated how these restrictive measures have impacted sleep quality, timing, and psychological difficulties in school-age children and their mothers during the lockdown. METHODS: In an online survey, 299 mothers reported their sleep habits, experience of time, and psychological difficulties as well as those of their children (6–10 years old) during and, retrospectively, before the lockdown. RESULTS: During the lockdown, children showed a marked delay in sleep timing—that is, later bedtime and rise time—and a mild worsening in sleep quality. They were less prone to respect daily routines or to keep track of the passage of time. They showed increased emotional, conduct, and hyperactive symptoms, and the increase in these psychological difficulties was predicted by the change in sleep quality, boredom, and mothers’ psychological difficulties. In addition, mothers showed a delayed sleep timing and worsening of sleep quality during the lockdown, in varying degrees depending on their working conditions. Mothers who kept working regularly outside their homes during lockdown reported more regular sleep patterns, whereas mothers who stopped working showed more emotional symptoms and relevant changes in their perception of time. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, given the evidence of the adverse behavioral and psychological impact of home confinement and social restrictions, effective measures needed to be in place to mitigate long-term effects on children and their mothers, especially those who have had to stop working during lockdown.","Cellini, Nicola; Di Giorgio, Elisa; Mioni, Giovanna; Di Riso, Daniela",J Pediatr Psychol,127,22

Viral RNA-containing double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) are a striking feature of +RNA viral replication and are abundant in SARS-CoV-2–infected cells. Their generation involves rewiring of host lipid metabolism, including lipid biosynthetic pathways. Viruses can also redirect lipids from host cell organelles; lipid exchange at membrane contact sites, where the membranes of adjacent organelles are in close apposition, has been implicated in the replication of several +RNA viruses. Here we review current understanding of DMV biogenesis. With a focus on the exploitation of contact site machinery by +RNA viruses to generate replication organelles, we discuss evidence that similar mechanisms support SARS-CoV-2 replication, protecting its RNA from the host cell immune response.","Wong, Louise H.; Edgar, James R.; Martello, Andrea; Ferguson, Brian J.; Eden, Emily R.",Front Cell Dev Biol,127,28

This is sometimes due to organisational and bureaucratic barriers, but also because they often feel stigmatised and treated badly when they do seek health care. The COVID-19 pandemic and the required social distancing measures have caused unprecedented disruption and change for the organisation of primary care, particularly for people experiencing homelessness. Against this backdrop there are many questions to address regarding whether the recent changes required to deliver services to people experiencing homelessness in the context of COVID-19 will help to address or compound problems in accessing care and inequalities in health outcomes. METHODS: An action led and participatory research methodology will be employed to address the study objectives. Interviews with people experiencing homelessness were will be conducted by a researcher with lived experience of homelessness. Researchers with lived experience are able to engage with vulnerable communities in an empathetic, non-judgemental way as their shared experience promotes a sense of trust and integrity, which in turn encourages participation in research and may help people speak more openly about their experience. The experiences of health professionals and stakeholders delivering and facilitating care for people experiencing homelessness during the pandemic will also be explored. DISCUSSION: It is important to explore whether recent changes to the delivery of primary care in response to the COVID-19 pandemic compromise the safety of people experiencing homelessness and exacerbate health inequalities. This could have implications for how primary healthcare is delivered to those experiencing homelessness not only for the duration of the pandemic but in the future.","Howells, Kelly; Burrows, Martin; Amp, Mat; Brennan, Rachel; Yeung, Wan-Ley; Jackson, Shaun; Dickinson, Joanne; Draper, Julie; Campbell, Stephen; Ashcroft, Darren; Blakeman, Tom; Sanders, Caroline",Int J Equity Health,127,1

We present mathematical models describing two types of hot zones. First, we consider a metapopulation model of infection spread where transmission hot zones are explicitly described by independent demes in which the same people repeatedly interact (referred to as ""static"" hot zones, e.g. nursing homes, food processing plants, prisons, etc.). These are assumed to exists in addition to a ""community at large"" compartment in which virus transmission is less effective. This model yields a number of predictions that are relevant to interpreting epidemiological patterns in COVID19 data. Even if the rate of community virus spread is assumed to be relatively slow, outbreaks in hot zones can temporarily accelerate initial community virus growth, which can lead to an overestimation of the viral reproduction number in the general population. Further, the model suggests that hot zones are a reservoir enabling the prolonged persistence of the virus at ""infection plateaus"" following implementation of non-pharmaceutical interventions, which has been frequently observed in data. The second model considers ""dynamic"" hot zones, which can repeatedly form by drawing random individuals from the community, and subsequently dissolve (e.g. restaurants, bars, movie theaters). While dynamic hot zones can accelerate the average rate of community virus spread and can provide opportunities for targeted interventions, they do not predict the occurrence of infection plateaus or other atypical epidemiological dynamics. The models therefore identify two types of transmission hot zones with very different effects on the infection dynamics, which warrants further epidemiological investigations.","Wodarz, D.; Komarova, N.

However, to what extent PGG or other polyphenolic compounds can perturb the magnitude and/or gating of different types of plasmalemmal ionic currents remains largely uncertain. In pituitary tumor (GH(3)) cells, we found out that PGG was effective at suppressing the density of delayed-rectifier K(+) current (I(K(DR))) concentration-dependently. The addition of PGG could suppress the density of proton-activated Cl(−) current (I(PAC)) observed in GH(3) cells. The IC(50) value required for the inhibitory action of PGG on I(K(DR)) or I(PAC) observed in GH(3) cells was estimated to be 3.6 or 12.2 μM, respectively, while PGG (10 μM) mildly inhibited the density of the erg-mediated K(+) current or voltage-gated Na(+) current. The presence of neither chlorotoxin, hesperetin, kaempferol, morin nor iberiotoxin had any effects on I(PAC) density, whereas hydroxychloroquine or 4-[(2-butyl-6,7-dichloro-2-cyclopentyl-2,3-dihydro-1-oxo-1H-inden-5yl)oxy] butanoic acid suppressed current density effectively. The application of PGG also led to a decrease in the area of voltage-dependent hysteresis of I(PAC) elicited by long-lasting isosceles-triangular ramp voltage command, suggesting that hysteretic strength was lessened in its presence. In human cardiac myocytes, the exposure to PGG also resulted in a reduction of ramp-induced I(K(DR)) density. Taken literally, PGG-perturbed adjustment of ionic currents could be direct and appears to be independent of its anti-oxidative property.","Chang, Wei-Ting; Liu, Ping-Yen; Wu, Sheng-Nan",Int J Mol Sci,127,16

Many economies/territories were compelled to consider digital learning modalities. In particular, increased digital learning engagement with digital devices and mounting psychosocial stress due to social isolation are likely to pose adverse risks for youth visual health globally. This study examines the association between increased digital device use, psychosocial stress, and myopia symptoms among Chinese youth during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This is a retrospective observational population study consisting of 3918 participants enrolled in primary, secondary, and university in China. Participants are recruited through an online survey, which included self-reported information on daily digital device use, psychosocial stress level, condition of visual acuity, and demographic information. We utilize statistical tools including χ(2) test, paired sample t test, and multiple multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS: Each hour increase in digital device use is associated with 1.25 odds ratio OR (95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.21-1.30; P < 0.001) increased risk of developing myopic symptoms, each additional hour of digital device use weighted by near-view and blue-light exposure is associated with OR = 1.04 OR (95% CI = 1.03-1.05; P < 0.001) and OR = 2.25 (95% CI = 1.94-2.60; P < 0.001) increased risk respectively. Subjects reporting under stressful conditions are between OR = 1.98 (95% CI = 1.67-2.36; P < 0.001) and OR = 2.03 (95% CI = 1.71-2.42; P < 0.001) more likely to develop myopic symptoms, relative to those citing less stress. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic led to favorable conditions for myopigenic behavioral changes characterized by extended sedentary engagement with digital devices, which are significantly associated with higher risks of myopia incidence. Relatedly, psychosocial stress accompanying prolonged social isolation during the pandemic is a less noticeable, albeit significant risk factor for myopia development.","Liu, Ji; Chen, Qiaoyi; Dang, Jingxia",J Glob Health,127,1

METHODS: A stable animal model was established via an intratracheal injection of 5 mg bleomycin (BLM). One single transplantation of 2.5× 10(7) HUMSCs or initiation of daily oral nintedanib/pirfenidone administration was performed on day 21 following BLM damage. RESULTS: Pulmonary function examination revealed that BLM rats exhibited a significant decrease in blood oxygen saturation and an increase in respiratory rates. While no significant improvements were found in BLM rats receiving nintedanib or pirfenidone, those who transplanted with HUMSCs showed a statistical amelioration in blood oxygen saturation and significant alleviation in respiratory rates. Quantification results revealed that a significant reduction in alveolar space and marked increases in substantial cell infiltration and collagen deposition in the left lungs of BLM rats. No significant alteration was observed in BLM rats administered nintedanib or pirfenidone. However, BLM rats transplanted with HUMSCs had a significant recovery in alveolar space and noticeable decreases in cell infiltration and collagen deposition. The inflammatory cell numbers in the bronchoalveolar lavage was increased in the BLM group. While the rats treated with nintedanib or pirfenidone had a lower cell number than the BLM group, a higher cell number was found as compared with the Normal group. In rats transplanted with HUMSCs, the cell number did not differ from the Normal group. CONCLUSIONS: Transplantation of HUMSCs could effectively treat PF as opposed to the administration of anti-fibrotic drugs with nintedanib or pirfenidone with a significant better result in lung volume, pathological changes, lung function, and blood oxygen saturation.","Chu, Kuo-An; Yeh, Chang-Ching; Kuo, Fu-Hsien; Lin, Wen-Ren; Hsu, Chien-Wei; Chen, Tien-Hua; Fu, Yu-Show",Stem Cell Res Ther,127,16
