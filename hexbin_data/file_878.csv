69260,Interaction between RAS gene and lipid metabolism in cancer.,2021-02-25,"We have quantum chemically analyzed the structure and stability of archetypal chalcogen-bonded model complexes D2 Ch⋅⋅⋅A- (Ch = O, S, Se, Te; D, A = F, Cl, Br) using relativistic density functional theory at ZORA-M06/QZ4P. Our purpose is twofold: (i) to compute accurate trends in chalcogen-bond strength based on a set of consistent data; and (ii) to rationalize these trends in terms of detailed analyses of the bonding mechanism based on quantitative Kohn-Sham molecular orbital (KS-MO) theory in combination with a canonical energy decomposition analysis (EDA). At odds with the commonly accepted view of chalcogen bonding as a predominantly electrostatic phenomenon, we find that chalcogen bonds, just as hydrogen and halogen bonds, have a significant covalent character stemming from strong HOMO-LUMO interactions. Besides providing significantly to the bond strength, these orbital interactions are also manifested by the structural distortions they induce as well as the associated charge transfer from A- to D2 Ch.","de Azevedo Santos, Lucas; van der Lubbe, Stephanie C C; Hamlin, Trevor A; Ramalho, Teodorico C; Matthias Bickelhaupt, F",ChemistryOpen,https://doi.org/10.1002/open.202000323; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33594829/,878

Metaphors in particular, as conventions that guide and reproduce analogical reasoning, merit attention that they largely do not receive. My research addresses this deficit by examining how metaphors for handling microbes shape possibilities for working with yeast and bacteria in synthetic biology, microbiome research, and other fields that reconfigure what microbes can be. Though poised to reexamine assumptions, these fields routinely rest on metaphors and other language tools that quietly embed ways of thinking that may work against wider aims-for example, imagining bacteria as imperfect machines that should therefore be rendered increasingly passive and controllable. Researchers, therefore, need to examine how language tools structure their observations and expectations so that the tools they choose are appropriate for the work they want to do.","Szymanski, Erika",mSystems,https://doi.org/10.1128/msystems.00769-21; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34463574/,878
72459,[Perioperative infection prevention strategies for double-lung transplantation in elderly patients with COVID-19].,2020-10-25,"BACKGROUND Low adherence has contributed to disappointing results for trials testing vaginal microbicides for HIV prevention. This study engaged former gel trial participants to understand the reasons behind low adherence and seek suggestions on how to improve products and adherence to microbicides. This analysis examines the impact of participant perceptions of male partners on participant adherence and suggestions on how to address those issues. METHODS Eight focus group discussion workshops were conducted with 46 former microbicide trial participants in South Africa and Tanzania. Participants provided feedback on why women join trials, barriers to using gels and reporting adherence accurately, and how adherence and adherence reporting can be improved. RESULTS Participants reported that male partners can affect women's ability to use gels. For some, the lubricating effects caused relationship conflicts due to suspicion of male partners about infidelity. Needing to provide sex to partners on demand was a barrier to gel use. Participants suggested a gel formulation which was thicker and less noticeable, and explicit male partner engagement to enhance understanding of the purpose of the gels. CONCLUSION The imbalance of power in intimate relationships affects the ability of women to use microbicides as directed. To improve adherence to HIV prevention methods within trials and for successful rollout of proven HIV prevention methods in populations, it is important that the complicated dynamics of sex and relationships be taken into greater consideration and that women receive targeted support to navigate product use and communication within the context of these gender dynamics.","Miller, Lori; Morar, Neetha; Kapiga, Saidi; Ramjee, Gita; Hayes, Richard",Journal of acquired immune deficiency syndromes,https://doi.org/10.1097/qai.0000000000002463; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32740368/,878
74480,[Impact of cardiovascular metabolic diseases on COVID-19: review of recent progress].,2021-04-20,"Tributyltin (TBT), a widely and persistently distributed organontin, has been well documented to disrupt reproduction and behaviors in animals due to its anti-aromatase activity. TBT has been also reported to enhance anxiety in several fish species, whereas the mechanism underlying remains largely unknown. To investigate the disruption of TBT on fish anxiety and the mechanisms possibly involved, adult male zebrafish (Danio rerio) were treated with TBT (100 and 500 ng/L) for 28 days and anxiety behavior was further investigated using a novel tank dive test. Result showed that TBT treatment significantly enhanced the total time of the fish spent in the lower half, delayed the onset time to the higher half of the tank and increased the total duration of freezing of the fish, indicating an enhanced anxiety in TBT-treated fish. Accordingly, TBT sharply elevated the cortisol levels in plasma in a concentration-dependent manner, suggesting that the elevated cortisol level might be involved in the enhanced anxiety. Although the expression of crha was significantly increased and crhbp was significantly decreased in the brain of TBT-treated fish which is consistent to the elevated cortisol level, the expressions of actha and acthb were sharply down-regulated. In contrast, the expressions of genes responsible for the synthesis and action of serotonin (5-HT) (pet1, thp2 and htr1aa), dopamine (DA) (th1, slc6a3, drd2a and drd2b) and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) (gad2 and gabrg2) were all significantly inhibited. The down-regulation of these pivotal genes acting in 5-HT, DA and GABA neurotransmitter systems in response to TBT corresponded well with the TBT-enhanced anxiety in fish. It was thus strongly suggested that these neurotransmitters might be also involved in TBT-enhanced anxiety in adult male zebrafish. The present study extended our understanding of the neurotoxicity of TBT on the anxiety control and behavioral modulation in fish.","Tu, Xin; Li, Ying-Wen; Chen, Qi-Liang; Shen, Yan-Jun; Liu, Zhi-Hao",Ecotoxicology and environmental safety,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoenv.2020.111014; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32888589/,878
74863,[Early differential diagnosis between COVID-19 and mycoplasma pneumonia with chest CT scan].,2020-08-25,"BACKGROUND Systematic reviews are important for decision-makers. They offer many potential benefits but are often written in technical language, are too long, and do not contain contextual details which makes them hard to use for decision-making. There are many organizations that develop and disseminate derivative products, such as evidence summaries, from systematic reviews for different populations or subsets of decision-makers. This systematic review will assess the effectiveness of systematic review summaries on increasing policymakers' use of systematic review evidence and to identify the components or features of these summaries that are most effective. METHODS/DESIGN We will include studies of policy-makers at all levels as well as health-system managers. We will include studies examining any type of ""evidence summary,"" ""policy brief,"" or other products derived from systematic reviews that present evidence in a summarized form. The primary outcomes are the following: (1) use of systematic review summaries decision-making (e.g., self-reported use of the evidence in policy-making, decision-making) and (2) policy-maker understanding, knowledge, and/or beliefs (e.g., changes in knowledge scores about the topic included in the summary). We will conduct a systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs), non-randomized controlled trials (NRCTs), controlled before-after studies (CBA), and interrupted time series (ITS) studies. DISCUSSION The results of this review will inform the development of future systematic review summaries to ensure that systematic review evidence is accessible to and used by policy-makers making health-related decisions.","Petkovic, Jennifer; Welch, Vivian; Tugwell, Peter",Systematic reviews,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13643-015-0116-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26411423/,878

More recently, the use of PET techniques such as Ga-DOTATATE has been advocated.

These advantages are especially true for pancreatic and lymph node lesions. Overall, SPECT/CT can result in a change in clinical management in 25% of patients.

79707,[An increased neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio is an early warning signal of severe COVID-19].,2020-03-30,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Placement of a stent within a flow diverter has been described previously but its consequences have not been analyzed. We evaluated the clinical and angiographic results of stent placement within a flow diverter during the same treatment session. MATERIALS AND METHODS All patients treated with a Surpass flow diverter were retrospectively evaluated. Patients with previously deployed stents and procedures in which scaffolding stents, a second flow diverter, or intrasaccular devices were used were excluded. Patient and aneurysm characteristics and clinical and imaging follow-up results were compared between stented and nonstented Surpass flow-diverter groups and stent assisted coiling. RESULTS Thirty-five patients (41 aneurysms) were treated with a Surpass flow diverter only (monotherapy group), and in 33 patients (35 aneurysms), a stent was placed within the Surpass flow diverter (stented group). Stents were placed inside the Surpass flow diverter for a variety of reasons at the operator's discretion. No statistical difference was noted between the 2 groups in age, body weight, sex, history of thromboembolic events, smoking, platelet inhibition levels, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, malignancy, and aneurysm location. Aneurysms in the stented group were larger than those in the monotherapy group (14.8 versus 9.1 mm, P < .001). The rate of clinically significant adverse events and complete aneurysm occlusion rates at 0-3 and 3-6 months (73.3% versus 61.3%, P = .31, and 84.8% versus 70.2%, P = .14) were similar. At 9-12 months, a significantly higher proportion of aneurysms in the stented group achieved complete occlusion (93.9% versus 73.2%, P = .019). There was a trend toward a higher obliteration rate on final follow-up in the stented group (93.9% versus 82.9%, P = .14). CONCLUSIONS Placement of a stent within a flow diverter increases the rate of aneurysm occlusion. We propose that these results are from improved flow-diverter apposition due to the higher radial force of intracranial stents.","Ocal, O; Peker, A; Balci, S; Arat, A",AJNR.

82732,Clinical and CT imaging features between the first nucleic acid-negative and first nucleic acid-positive COVID-19 patients.,2020-03-28,"BACKGROUND Physician burnout, widespread across medicine, is linked to poorer physician quality of life and reduced quality of care. Data on prevalence of and risk factors for burnout among anesthesiologists are limited. The objective of the current study was to improve understanding of burnout in anesthesiologists, identify workplace and personal factors associated with burnout among anesthesiologists, and quantify their strength of association. METHODS During March 2020, the authors surveyed member anesthesiologists of the American Society of Anesthesiologists. Burnout was assessed using the Maslach Burnout Inventory Human Services Survey. Additional survey questions queried workplace and personal factors. The primary research question was to assess rates of high risk for burnout (scores of at least 27 on the emotional exhaustion subscale and/or at least 10 on the depersonalization subscale of the Maslach Burnout Inventory Human Services Survey) and burnout syndrome (demonstrating all three burnout dimensions, consistent with the World Health Organization definition). The secondary research question was to identify associated risk factors. RESULTS Of 28,677 anesthesiologists contacted, 13.6% (3,898) completed the survey; 59.2% (2,307 of 3,898) were at high risk of burnout, and 13.8% (539 of 3,898) met criteria for burnout syndrome. On multivariable analysis, perceived lack of support at work (odds ratio, 6.7; 95% CI, 5.3 to 8.5); working greater than or equal to 40 h/week (odds ratio, 2.22; 95% CI, 1.80 to 2.75); lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender/transsexual, queer/questioning, intersex, and asexual status (odds ratio, 2.21; 95% CI, 1.35 to 3.63); and perceived staffing shortages (odds ratio, 2.06; 95% CI, 1.76 to 2.42) were independently associated with high risk for burnout. Perceived lack of support at work (odds ratio, 10.0; 95% CI, 5.4 to 18.3) and home (odds ratio, 2.13; 95% CI, 1.69 to 2.69) were most strongly associated with burnout syndrome. CONCLUSIONS The prevalence of burnout among anesthesiologists is high, with workplace factors weighing heavily. The authors identified risk factors for burnout, especially perceived support in the workplace, where focused interventions may be effective in reducing burnout.

We are interested to understand how Singapore's cancer-SSAs utilized the social media platform Facebook to overcome the restrictions which were introduced due to COVID-19. Facebook posts from two prominent cancer-SSAs 365 Cancer Prevention Society (365CPS) and Singapore Cancer Society (SCS) between comparable periods in 2019 and 2020 were extracted. These posts were categorized using a classification scheme which was specifically developed by two coders with adequate intercoder reliability. Statistical analyses were performed to determine if there was a significant difference in the frequency of posts between 2019 and 2020, and across three specific periods in 2020. Results indicate that 365CPS appears to have adapted to the pandemic by increasing their posting frequency on Facebook in 2020, but the same was not evident for SCS. However, both SSAs tweaked their social media outreach strategy in line with social distancing measures, publishing posts detailing activities that beneficiaries can participate from home such as healthy recipes and virtual events. SSAs can scale up their efforts to achieve a higher level of health promotion and support for their beneficiaries. Further qualitative studies are required to ascertain the impact of COVID-19 from the perspective of beneficiaries and validate the classification scheme which was developed in this study. The classification scheme could be used in ascertaining the quality of social media communication between public/private support groups and patients.","Ethan Tan, Kieran; Sesagiri Raamkumar, Aravind; Lin Wee, Hwee",Journal of biomedical informatics,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbi.2021.103798; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33965641/,878

DATA SOURCES We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis using electronic database search (PubMed, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, EMBASE, Google scholar, and Web of Science), Cochrane, and trial registries including ClinicalTrials.gov. METHODS OF STUDY SELECTION We conducted an electronic search of research articles from 1966 to January 2017 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs), prospective cohort, and retrospective cohort studies of negative pressure wound therapy compared with standard dressing after cesarean delivery among obese women. Our primary outcome was defined as a composite of wound complication, including wound or surgical site infection, cellulitis, seroma, hematoma, wound disruption, or dehiscence. For cohort studies and RCTs, we performed a descriptive systematic review. For available RCTs, we performed a meta-analysis and pooled risk ratios using a random-effects model. We assessed for heterogeneity using χ test for heterogeneity and I test. We assessed for publication bias using a funnel plot. TABULATION, INTEGRATION, AND RESULTS Of 10 studies meeting eligibility criteria, five were RCTs and five were cohort studies. Results of cohort studies were varied; however, all had a high potential for selection bias. In the meta-analysis, there was no difference in primary composite outcome among those women with negative pressure wound therapy (16.8%) compared with those who had standard dressing (17.8%) (risk ratio 0.97, 95% CI 0.63-1.49). There was no statistically significant heterogeneity (χ test 4.80, P=.31, I=17%).

Here, we demonstrate that this mechanism is specific for the Env conformation and affects the efficiency of antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). Using flow cytometry and confocal microscopy, we show that broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) targeting the ""closed"" conformation of Env induce its internalization from the surface. In contrast, non-neutralizing antibodies (nNAbs) are displayed on the cell surface for prolonged period of times. The bNAb-induced Env internalization can be decreased by blocking dynamin function, which translates into higher susceptibilities of infected cells to ADCC.

95045,[Conducting clinical studies during the epidemics of communicable diseases: perspectives of methodology and health economics].,2020-03-30,"OBJECTIVES Despite substantial investment by governments, the prevalence of mental health disorders in developed countries remains unchanged over the past 20 years. As 50% of mental health conditions present before 14 years of age, access to high-quality mental health care for children is crucial. Barriers to access identified by parents include high costs and long wait times, difficulty navigating the health system, and a lack of recognition of the existence and/or severity of the child's mental health disorder. Often neglected, but equally important, are clinician views about the barriers to and enablers of access to high-quality mental health care. We aimed to determine perspectives of Australian clinicians including child and adolescent psychiatrists, paediatricians, psychologists and general practitioners, on barriers and enablers within the current system and components of an optimal system. METHODS A total of 143 clinicians (approximately 35 each of child and adolescent psychiatrists, paediatricians, child psychologists and general practitioners) from Victoria and South Australia participated in semi-structured phone interviews between March 2018 and February 2019. Inductive content analysis was applied to address the broad study aims. FINDINGS Clinician-identified barriers included multi-dimensional family factors, service fragmentation, long wait times and inadequate training for paediatricians and general practitioners. Rural and regional locations provided additional challenges but a greater sense of collaboration resulting from the proximity of clinicians in rural areas, creating an opportunity to develop support networks. Suggestions for an optimal system included novel ways to improve access to child psychiatry expertise, training for paediatricians and general practitioners, and co-located multidisciplinary services. CONCLUSION Within the current mental health system for children, structural, training and workforce barriers prevent optimal access to care.

We evaluated trends in ID hospitalizations at our Department for Infectious Diseases in the last two decades to aid decision-makers in defining appropriate healthcare strategies. METHODS The discharge diagnoses of all patients admitted to the ID Department of L Sacco University Hospital between 1995 and 2011 were classified by the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9) grouped in Major Diagnostic Categories (MDC). Linear regression was used to determine the trends in hospitalizations for each MDC. Estimates of the average annual change were based on the slope of the regression line. RESULTS A sharp decline in HIV/AIDS cases (-22.5 +/-6.0 cases per calendar year), and an increase in admissions for respiratory, cardiovascular, renal and musculoskeletal infections were recorded. The mean age of the patients increased by 1.2 years (+/-0.049) for each calendar year of observation (linear trend, p < 0.0001), increasing from 37.02 +/-11.91 years in 1995 to 56.02 +/-19.62 years in 2011 (p < 0.0001). The mean number of comorbidities per patient increased significantly over time (Mann-Whitney U test, p = 0.0153). From 1998/1999 to 2010/2011 the hospital length of stay (LOS) increased for cardiovascular, digestive system, musculoskeletal, and skin/subcutaneous infections, and infectious and parasitic diseases (p < 0.01). The rate of hospital stay over threshold (HSOT) increased in the last 5 years by 1.12% for every 10-year age group. CONCLUSIONS Older age, a higher number of comorbidities, a longer hospital LOS for certain conditions, and a higher rate of HSOT characterize the patients admitted to this ID department in recent years. Despite progress in treatment and management, infectious diseases continue to be a major threat to human health. The current challenge for ID departments is the treatment of complex cases, often associated with chronic diseases in elderly patients. Continuous monitoring at a local and national level will allow early identification of changes in the epidemiological patterns of IDs and provide information for healthcare system planning.","Orlando, Giovanna; Gubertini, Guido; Negri, Cristina; Coen, Massimo; Ricci, Elena; Galli, Massimo; Rizzardini, Giuliano",BMC public health,https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2458-14-980; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25239403/,878

OBJECTIVE The purpose of the study was to determine factors influencing job satisfaction among dentists during the new normal of COVID-19 pandemic in Indonesia by utilizing the Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) approach. METHODS A total of 310 Indonesian dentists voluntary completed an online questionnaire, which contained 58 questions. Several latent variables such as perceived severity of COVID-19, staff cooperation and management commitment, personal protective equipment, job stress, working hours, income, and overall job satisfaction were analyzed simultaneously. RESULTS SEM revealed perceived severity of COVID-19 had significant effects on job stress (β:0.394, p = 0.025) and the utilization of personal protective equipment (β:0.757, p = 0.001). Subsequently, job stress (β:-0.286, p = 0.001), working hours (β:0.278, p = 0.018), income (β:0.273, p = 0.003), personal protective equipment (β:0.145, p = 0.038), and staff cooperation & management commitment (β:0.091, p = 0.002) were found to have significant effects on overall job satisfaction. In addition, management & staff cooperation was found to have a significant association with job stress reduction (β:-0.319, p = 0.003) which subsequently led to higher satisfaction. CONCLUSIONS The current study is one of the first that analyzed job satisfaction among dentists in Indonesia during the global COVID-19 pandemic. The integrated latent variables can be applied and extended to evaluate job satisfaction among dentists during the COVID-19 pandemic in other countries. Finally, this study contributed as a theoretical foundation for policymakers to enhance the job satisfaction of dentists during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Prasetyo, Yogi Tri; Maulanti, Titis; Persada, Satria Fadil; Perwira Redi, Anak Agung Ngurah; Young, Michael Nayat; Diaz, John Francis T",Work,https://doi.org/10.3233/wor-210479; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34633339/,878

It is known that university studies can influence the mental health of students, and especially those studying health sciences. In this study, we therefore sought to analyse whether the current pandemic has affected the mental well-being of final-year nursing students. This was a multi-centre study, with a descriptive, longitudinal, and prospective design. Mental well-being was evaluated using the General Health Questionnaire. A total of 305 participants were included in the study, of whom 52.1% had experienced the COVID-19 pandemic. Statistically significant differences were found between the two groups analysed in terms of age, access to university, average marks, mental well-being self-esteem, emotional exhaustion, and sense of coherence. In the case of mental well-being, a direct association was found with both the pandemic situation (OR = 2.32, P = 0.010) and emotional exhaustion scores (OR = 1.20, P < 0.001), while an inverse association was found with sense of coherence scores (OR = 0.45, P < 0.001). This study shows that the mental health of students is a significant factor and one that must be taken into consideration when training nursing staff at university. There is a need to promote healthy habits and provide appropriate coping strategies. It is also important to train and prepare students for pandemic situations as these can have an important impact on the mental health of both the members of the public who will be treated by these future nursing professionals and the students themselves.","Reverté-Villarroya, Sílvia; Ortega, Laura; Lavedán, Ana; Masot, Olga; Burjalés-Martí, Maria Dolors; Ballester-Ferrando, David; Fuentes-Pumarola, Concepció; Botigué, Teresa",International journal of mental health nursing,https://doi.org/10.1111/inm.12827; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33393201/,878

The secondary aim was to identify factors that were associated with developing COVID-19 during the postoperative period. METHODS A multicentre retrospective study was conducted of all patients presenting to nine centres over a 50-day period during the COVID-19 pandemic (1 March 2020 to 19 April 2020) with a minimum of 50 days follow-up. Patient demographics, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) grade, priority (urgent or elective), procedure type, COVID-19 status, and postoperative mortality were recorded. RESULTS During the study period, 1,659 procedures were performed in 1,569 patients. There were 68 (4.3%) patients who were diagnosed with COVID-19. There were 85 (5.4%) deaths postoperatively. Patients who had COVID-19 had a significantly lower survival rate when compared with those without a proven SARS-CoV-2 infection (67.6% vs 95.8%, p < 0.001). When adjusting for confounding variables (older age (p < 0.001), female sex (p = 0.004), hip fracture (p = 0.003), and increasing ASA grade (p < 0.001)) a diagnosis of COVID-19 was associated with an increased mortality risk (hazard ratio 1.89, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.14 to 3.12; p = 0.014). A total of 62 patients developed COVID-19 postoperatively, of which two were in the elective and 60 were in the urgent group. Patients aged > 77 years (odds ratio (OR) 3.16; p = 0.001), with increasing ASA grade (OR 2.74; p < 0.001), sustaining a hip (OR 4.56; p = 0.008) or periprosthetic fracture (OR 14.70; p < 0.001) were more likely to develop COVID-19 postoperatively. CONCLUSION Perioperative COVID-19 nearly doubled the background postoperative mortality risk following surgery. Patients at risk of developing COVID-19 postoperatively (patients > 77 years, increasing morbidity, sustaining a hip or periprosthetic fracture) may benefit from perioperative shielding.

Eye-care professionals should educate patients about limiting screen time and managing digital eye strain symptoms. Background: This study aimed to evaluate the COVID-19 isolation's impact on digital device use by comparing hours spent on digital devices before and during the 24-hour curfew in Saudi Arabia, while assessing the symptoms associated with digital eye strain. Methods: A self-reported questionnaire was used to compare the total hours per day, either continuous or intermittent, spent on digital devices during and before curfew, and the association of these durations with digital eye strain. Results: A total of 1,939 participants, (mean ± SD: 33 ± 12.2 years and 72% women) were recruited. Results showed a significant difference between usage duration before and during curfew. Digital eye strain incidence was 78% during the curfew. Chi-squared analysis indicated most symptoms are associated with usage duration and employment status. Multivariate analysis revealed significant associations between digital eye strain and the following factors: using more than one device (odds ratio 1.208, 95% confidence interval: 1.068-1.3661), age, optical correction, employment status, gender, using rewetting drops, and usage duration. Conclusions: In this population, prolonged use of digital devices significantly increased during home-isolation. Digital eye strain incidence increased during curfew. Regular eye exams should be encouraged to ensure the use of optimum prescription use and meet the specific visual demands required for the use of digital devices. Eye-health strategies and awareness campaigns should be employed on the importance of regular eye exams, decreasing screen time, practising the 20-20-20 rule, and the use of rewetting drops to help reduce the symptoms of digital eye strain during this period.","Alabdulkader, Balsam",Clinical & experimental optometry,https://doi.org/10.1080/08164622.2021.1878843; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33689614/,878

The aim of this study was thus to compare infiltration rates of PD-1 and PD-L1 expressing tumor infiltrating leucocytes (TILs) in primary ovarian tumor tissue and metastatic intraperitoneal implants and to investigate its impact on overall survival (OS). Tumor specimens (ovarian tumor tissues and intraperitoneal metastases) of 111 patients were used to investigate the PD-1, PD-L1 and CD8 expression rates on TILs and PD-L1 expression rate of tumor cells. The percentages of CD8, PD-1, and PD-L1 expressing subpopulations of TILs differ in primary ovarian tumor tissues and metastatic intraperitoneal implants. High PD-1 among TILs in peritoneal metastases were associated with favorable OS. High PD-L1 expression in TILs was associated with poor OS. Combining both factors in peritoneal metastases revealed an unfavorable prognosis. Primary ovarian tumor tissue and intraperitoneal metastatic tissues in EOC might have different strategies to evade immune control.

However, migrant groups are under-represented in health decision-making processes. Our aim was to explore migrants' involvement in health policy, service development and research in the WHO European Region to identify levers for inclusive and meaningful practice. METHODS We conducted a narrative review of grey literature and peer-reviewed research on migrants' involvement in health decision-making across the 53 countries in WHO Europe. We searched for articles published in English between 2010 and the present in two electronic databases (PubMed, Scopus), IOM MIPEX Health Strand country reports, the EU SOPHIE project and using a Google advanced search. Findings were analysed descriptively and using Normalisation Process Theory to investigate levers and barriers to implementation of policy into practice. RESULTS Of 1,444 articles retrieved, 79 met the inclusion criteria. We identified 20 policies promoting migrants' involvement, but national-level policies were present in only two countries. We identified 59 examples of migrants' involvement in practice from half of the WHO Europe countries (n=27). Our Normalisation Process Theory (NPT) analysis of 14 peer-reviewed empirical papers found that participatory research approaches are a lever to putting policy into practice in a meaningful way. CONCLUSIONS Migrants' involvement in health decision-making requires explicit national policies that are implemented evenly across policy making, service provider and research activities in all countries in the WHO European Region. Participatory approaches to involvement activities are encouraged because they are a lever to perceived barriers to migrants' involvement.","MacFarlane, Anne; Ogoro, Mamobo; de Freitas, Claudia; Niranjan, Vikram; Severoni, Santino; Waagensen, Elisabeth",Tropical medicine & international health : TM & IH,https://doi.org/10.1111/tmi.13643; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34169612/,878

To assess the reliability of simulations for treatment planning, we compared simulation results with empiric outcomes of renal IRE using computed tomography (CT) and histology in an animal model. METHODS The ablation size and shape for six different IRE parameter sets (70-90 pulses, 2,000-2,700 V, 70-100 µs) for monopolar and bipolar electrodes was simulated using a numerical model. Employing these treatment parameters, 35 CT-guided IRE ablations were created in both kidneys of six pigs and followed up with CT immediately and after 24 h. Histopathology was analyzed from postablation day 1. RESULTS Ablation zones on CT measured 81 ± 18 % (day 0, p ≤ 0.05) and 115 ± 18 % (day 1, p ≤ 0.09) of the simulated size for monopolar electrodes, and 190 ± 33 % (day 0, p ≤ 0.001) and 234 ± 12 % (day 1, p ≤ 0.0001) for bipolar electrodes. Histopathology indicated smaller ablation zones than simulated (71 ± 41 %, p ≤ 0.047) and measured on CT (47 ± 16 %, p ≤ 0.005) with complete ablation of kidney parenchyma within the central zone and incomplete ablation in the periphery. CONCLUSION Both numerical simulations for planning renal IRE and CT measurements may overestimate the size of ablation compared to histology, and ablation effects may be incomplete in the periphery.","Wimmer, Thomas; Srimathveeravalli, Govindarajan; Gutta, Narendra; Ezell, Paula C; Monette, Sebastien; Maybody, Majid; Erinjery, Joseph P; Durack, Jeremy C; Coleman, Jonathan A; Solomon, Stephen B",Cardiovascular and interventional radiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00270-014-0905-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24831827/,878

Therefore, the aim of this study was to estimate the proportion of individuals with T2DM undergoing changes in glucose-lowering therapy in 2019 and 2020. METHOD Individuals with T2DM with at least one consultation in one of 940 general (including diabetologist) practices in Germany between January and July 2019 (N = 79 268) and between January and July 2020 (N = 85 046) were included. Therapy changes corresponded to the prescription of new glucose-lowering drugs with or without the discontinuation of previous treatments (switch and add-on therapy, respectively). The number of T2DM patients with at least one medication regimen change was calculated for the period between January 1 and March 14 and the period between March 15 and July 31 in 2019 and 2020. March 2020 corresponded to the beginning of the lockdown in Germany. RESULTS Overall, there was a decrease in the number of persons with ≥1 medication regimen change in March 15/July 312 019 compared with March 15/July 312 020 (dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors [DPP-4i]: -15%; sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors [SGLT2i]: -3%; glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists [GLP-1 RA]: 0%; other oral glucose-lowering drugs: -6%; and insulin: -21%).

Single-nucleotide polymorphism rs2572886 in the LY6 family protein locus has been shown to associate with accelerated progression to AIDS. In this study, we show that LY6E promotes HIV, type 1 (HIV-1) infection by enhancing viral entry and gene expression. Knockdown of LY6E in human peripheral blood mononuclear, SupT1, and THP-1 cells diminishes HIV-1 replication. Virion-cell and cell-cell fusion experiments revealed that LY6E promotes membrane fusion of the viral entry step. Interestingly, we find that LTR-driven HIV-1 gene expression is also enhanced by LY6E, suggesting additional roles of LY6E in HIV-1 replication. HIV-1 infection induces LY6E expression in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, concomitant with increased production of type I IFN and some classical IFN-stimulated genes.

Donkeys have a different metabolism than horses, leading to differences in the pharmacokinetics of drugs compared to horses. This study aimed to describe the population pharmacokinetics of DXC in donkeys. Five doses of DXC hyclate (10 mg/kg) were administered via a nasogastric tube, q12 h, to eight non-fasted, healthy, adult jennies. Serum, urine, synovial fluid and endometrium were collected for 72 h following the first administration. Doxycycline concentration was measured by competitive enzyme immunoassay. Serum concentrations versus time data were fitted simultaneously using the stochastic approximation expectation-maximization algorithm for nonlinear mixed effects. A one-compartment model with linear elimination and first-order absorption after intragastric administration, best described the available pharmacokinetic data. Final parameter estimates indicate that DXC has a high volume of distribution (108 L/kg) as well as high absorption (10.3 h-1) in donkeys. However, results suggest that oral DXC at 10 mg/kg q12 h in donkeys would not result in a therapeutic concentration in serum, urine, synovial fluid or endometrium by comparison to the minimum inhibitory concentration of common equine pathogens. Further studies are recommended to identify appropriate dosage and dosing intervals of oral DXC in donkeys.","Chapuis, Ronan J J; Smith, Joe S; French, Hilari M; Toka, Felix Ngosa; Peterson, Erik W; Little, Erika L",Animals : an open access journal from MDPI,https://doi.org/10.3390/ani11072047; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34359175/,878

This study aimed to determine if a higher dose of RT was associated with improved symptoms response rates. METHODS We searched PubMed, Central and Embase for eligible studies published from 1990 to 2019. The primary outcomes were symptoms response rates for hematuria, dysuria and frequency. Secondary outcomes included treatment-related adverse events and quality of life. RESULTS We found one randomized, four prospective and eight retrospective non-comparative observational studies including 1320 patients who received palliative bladder radiotherapy for symptom relief. The dose fractionation schedules varied across studies ranging from 8 Gy single fraction to 60 Gy in 2 to 8 Gy per fraction. The pooled response rates for hematuria, dyuria and frequency symptoms were 74%, 58% and 71% respectively. A higher dose of RT was not associated with improved response rates of hematuria and frequency. However, a higher dose of RT was associated with a longer duration of hematuria response and reduced response of dysuria. Grade 3 gastrointestinal and genitourinary toxicity occurred in up to 26% of patients. Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) outcomes were reported in one study. CONCLUSION This systematic review demonstrates that a higher dose of bladder RT was not associated with improved response rates of hematuria and frequency symptoms but was associated with reduced response of dysuria. Higher doses of bladder RT was associated with more durable hematuria response. Prospective studies to determine the effects of palliative bladder radiotherapy on HRQOL outcomes are warranted.","Tey, Jeremy; Ho, Francis; Koh, Wee Yao; Chia, David; Ooi, Kiat Huat; Tuan, Jeffrey K L; Vellayappan, Balamurugan; Soon, Yu Yang",Acta oncologica,https://doi.org/10.1080/0284186x.2021.1880025; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33591843/,878

We found four independently evolved radiations in the evolutionary hexaploid (2n = 150) Labeobarbus lineage based on matrilineal relationships of >800 individuals. Each radiation displayed similar patterns of mouth phenotype diversification, and included ecomorphs/species of the generalized, lipped, scraping (one or two), and large-mouthed (one to three) types. All radiations were detected in geographically isolated rivers, and originated from different ancestral populations. This is the first documented case in which numerous parallel radiations of fishes occurred-via different ways-in a riverine environment. Some radiations are very recent and monophyletic, while others are older and include ecomorphs that originated in separate mini flocks and later combined into one. The diversification bursts among Ethiopian Labeobarbus were detected in the mid-upper reaches of rivers (1050-1550 m above sea level), which likely offer ecological opportunities that include diverse habitats yet poor fauna (i.e. lower competition and relaxed selection). This promising example of parallel evolution of adaptive radiation warrants further investigation.","Levin, Boris A; Simonov, Evgeniy; Dgebuadze, Yury Y; Levina, Marina; Golubtsov, Alexander S",Scientific reports,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-64350-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32346059/,878

This study is aimed to introduce and review a series of LOAGB cases that had to be reversed to normal anatomy due to severe hypoalbuminemia and its related symptoms after a few months. METHODS Patients who had LOAGB from 2014 to 2018 and then reversed after some months were included in this study. Their first and second surgical data were collected and reviewed for important and relevant information. RESULTS From 846 cases of LOAGB, 12 patients reversed after a mean of 12.1 months. All of them were women with mean age of 46 years. All of the gastrojejunostomy anastomosis had been made 200 cm after the Treitz ligament, and all of the patients had at least 250 cm common channel. The mean excess body mass index loss before the reversal surgery was 107.7%. None patients lost or died during the study. CONCLUSION Regarding anastomosis, 200 cm from Treitz ligament is not suitable for all of the patients and common channel more than 250 cm cannot prevent hypoalbuminemia. The surgeon should decide as quickly as possible whether his/her patients need reversal surgery or not. Appropriate patients should be selected for LOAGB.","Keleidari, Behrouz; Mahmoudieh, Mohsen; Shahabi, Shahab; Sheikhbahaei, Erfan; Rezaei, Mohammadtaghi; Sayadi, Masoud; Melali, Hamid",World journal of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00268-019-05290-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31873804/,878

It is essential to analyze the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 in different parts of our country. This study highlights clinical experience in managing patients with COVID-19 at a tertiary care centre in northern India. Methods Clinical characteristics and outcomes of consecutive adults patients admitted to a tertiary care hospital at Chandigarh, India, from April 1 to May 25, 2020 were studied. The diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on throat and/or nasopharyngeal swabs. All patients were managed according to the institute's consensus protocol and in accordance with Indian Council of Medical Research guidelines. Results During the study period, 114 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection were admitted. The history of contact with COVID-19-affected individuals was available in 75 (65.8%) patients. The median age of the patients was 33.5 yr (13-79 yr), and there were 66 (58%) males. Of the total enrolled patients, 48 (42%) were symptomatic. The common presenting complaints were fever (37, 77%), cough (26, 54%) and shortness of breath (10, 20.8%). Nineteen (17%) patients had hypoxia (SpO2<94%) at presentation and 36 (31%) had tachypnoea (RR >24). Thirty four (29.8%) patients had an accompanying comorbid illness. Age more than 60 yr and presence of diabetes and hypertension were significantly associated with severe COVID-19 disease. Admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) was needed in 18 patients (52%), with three (2.6%) patients requiring assisted ventilation. Mortality of 2.6 per cent (3 patients) was observed. Interpretation & conclusions Majority of the patients with COVID-19 infection presenting to our hospital were young and asymptomatic. Fever was noted only in three-fourth of the patients and respiratory symptoms in half of them. Patients with comorbidities were more vulnerable to complications.

The socioeconomic impact of recurrent PSP on the healthcare system is insufficiently reported. METHODS Ninety-six patients treated for PSP between 01/2010 and 01/2020 were included. Forty-eight patients underwent primary VATS, while the second group received chest tube (CT) treatment only. Length of hospital stay (LOS), duration of chest tube, prolonged air leak, postoperative complications, recurrences and treatment costs were analyzed. RESULTS Prolonged air leaks were evident in 12.5% and 22.9% patients of the VATS and CT group, respectively. Ten (20.8%) patients in the CT group underwent VATS for persistent air leakage. During follow-up, the VATS group recurred at 8.3% compared to 52.1% in the CT group. The total cost of treatment per patient, including treatment cost due to recurrence, was EUR 1.501 in the VATS group and EUR 2.233 in the CT group. CONCLUSIONS Primary treatment of PSP by CT is associated with an increased socioeconomic burden for patients and the healthcare system due to high recurrence rates. This burden may be reduced if VATS is considered at the first episode of PSP.","Fung, Stephen; Alexander, Andrea; Ashmawy, Hany; Dizdar, Levent; Safi, Sami; Rehders, Alexander; Fluegen, Georg; Knoefel, Wolfram Trudo",Healthcare,https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare9091236; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34575010/,878

152962,Effect of glutamine metabolism on chemoresistance and its mechanism in tumors.,2021-02-25,"Patients receiving left-sided mechanical circulatory support (MCS) require systemic anticoagulation with unfractionated heparin (UFH) to prevent clotting of the circuit and reduce the risk of arterial thrombosis. With MCS, there is a very high frequency of bleeding and ischaemic complications, including stroke and systemic embolism. Monitoring of UFH can be very challenging. Whilst most centres routinely monitor the activated clotting time, prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and fibrinogen to assess haemostasis, there is no clear guidance available regarding the optimal test. Additional tests, including antithrombin level, anti-factor Xa assay and thromboelastography can be used for risk stratification of patients to try and predict the risks of thrombosis and bleeding. Each has their specific role, strengths and limitations. Measurement of anti-Xa level best correlates with heparin dose, and appears predictive of circuit thrombosis, although aPTT is a better predictor of bleeding. Increased thrombin generation may have a role in predicting thrombosis. Acquired von Willebrand syndrome is frequent with MCS, contributing to bleeding risk and can be detected by assessing the von Willebrand factor activity to antigen ratio, whilst the Platelet Function Analyzer can be used in urgent situations with high negative predictive value. Tests of platelet aggregation can aid the prediction bleeding. A selection of complementary tests to collectively assess heparin-effect, coagulation, platelet function and platelet aggregation is recommended to personalise management and thereby optimise outcomes in patients receiving MCS.","Kanji, Rahim; Vandenbriele, Christophe; Arachchillage, Deepa; Price, Susanna; Gorog, Diana Adrienne",Thrombosis and haemostasis,https://doi.org/10.1055/a-1508-8230; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33984868/,878

Concerns about lesser pain and better cosmesis led to the evolution of uniportal access. This study prospectively compared the results of the uniportal, two-port, and three-port thoracoscopic surgery. MATERIAL AND METHODS One hundred and thirty-five patients were randomized into three groups according to the port numbers. The groups were compared regarding the operation time, hospital stay, amount of drainage, area of pleurectomy, complications, recurrences, and pain scores. RESULTS Except for the amount of drainage (p = 0.03), no factors were found to be statistically significant. The overall recurrence rate was 5%. Although the first and second week pain scores were not statistically significant, the single-incision group patients had significantly less pain at 4, 24, and 72 hours (p < 0.05).

Here, we tested the capability to rapidly, precisely, and simultaneously estimate the number of pulse-amplitude-modulation ChlF parameters commonly calculated from both dark- and light-adapted leaves (an operation which usually takes tens of minutes) from the reflectance of hyperspectral data collected on light-adapted leaves of date palm seedlings chronically exposed in a FACE facility to three ozone (O3) concentrations (ambient air, AA; target 1.5 × AA O3, named as moderate O3, MO; target 2 × AA O3, named as elevated O3, EO) for 75 consecutive days. Leaf spectral measurements were paired with reference measurements of ChlF, and predictive spectral models were constructed using partial least squares regression. Most of the ChlF parameters were well predicted by spectroscopic models (average model goodness-of-fit for validation, R2: 0.53-0.82). Furthermore, comparing the full-range spectral profiles (i.e., 400-2400 nm), it was possible to distinguish with high accuracy (81% of success) plants exposed to the different O3 concentrations, especially those exposed to EO from those exposed to MO and AA. This was possible even in the absence of visible foliar injury and using a moderately O3-susceptible species like the date palm. The latter view is confirmed by the few variations of the ChlF parameters, that occurred only under EO. The results of the current study could be applied in several scientific fields, such as precision agriculture and plant phenotyping.","Cotrozzi, Lorenzo; Lorenzini, Giacomo; Nali, Cristina; Pellegrini, Elisa; Saponaro, Vincenzo; Hoshika, Yasutomo; Arab, Leila; Rennenberg, Heinz; Paoletti, Elena",International journal of molecular sciences,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms21176441; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32899403/,878

Driving this transformation are advances in developmental sciences as they inform a deeper understanding of how early life experiences, both nurturing and adverse, are biologically embedded and influence outcomes in health, education, and economic stability across the life span. This revised policy statement on childhood toxic stress acknowledges a spectrum of potential adversities and reaffirms the benefits of an ecobiodevelopmental model for understanding the childhood origins of adult-manifested disease and wellness. It also endorses a paradigm shift toward relational health because SSNRs not only buffer childhood adversity when it occurs but also promote the capacities needed to be resilient in the future. To translate this relational health framework into clinical practice, generative research, and public policy, the entire pediatric community needs to adopt a public health approach that builds relational health by partnering with families and communities. This public health approach to relational health needs to be integrated both vertically (by including primary, secondary, and tertiary preventions) and horizontally (by including public service sectors beyond health care). The American Academy of Pediatrics asserts that SSNRs are biological necessities for all children because they mitigate childhood toxic stress responses and proactively build resilience by fostering the adaptive skills needed to cope with future adversity in a healthy manner.","Garner, Andrew; Yogman, Michael",Pediatrics,https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2021-052582; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34312296/,878

This study investigates the impact of the lockdown restrictions in India on atmospheric composition, using Sentinel-5Ps retrievals of tropospheric NO2 concentration and ground-station measurements of NO2 and PM2.5 between March-May in 2019 and 2020. Detailed analysis of the changes to atmospheric composition are carried out over six major urban areas (i.e. Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Bangalore, and Hyderabad) by comparing Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) and land surface temperature (LST) measurements in the lockdown year 2020 and pre-lockdown (2015-2019). Satellite-based data showed that NO2 concentration reduced by 18% (Kolkata), 29% (Hyderabad), 32-34% (Chennai, Mumbai, and Bangalore), and 43% (Delhi). Surface-based concentrations of NO2, PM2.5, and AOD also substantially dropped by 32-74%, 10-42%, and 8-34%, respectively over these major cities during the lockdown period and co-located with the intensity of anthropogenic activity. Only a smaller fraction of the reduction of pollutants was associated with meteorological variability. A substantial negative anomaly was found for LST both in the day (-0.16 °C to -1 °C) and night (-0.63 °C to -2.1 °C) across select all cities, which was also consistent with air temperature measurements. The decreases in LST could be associated with a reduction in pollutants, greenhouse gases and water vapor content. Improvement in air quality with lower urban temperatures due to lockdown may be a temporary effect, but it provides a crucial connection among human activities, air pollution, aerosols, radiative flux, and temperature. The lockdown for a shorter-period showed a significant improvement in environmental quality and provides a strong evidence base for larger scale policy implementation to improve air quality.","Parida, Bikash Ranjan; Bar, Somnath; Roberts, Gareth; Mandal, Shyama Prasad; Chandra Pandey, Arvind; Kumar, Manoj; Dash, Jadunandan",Environmental research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2021.111280; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34029544/,878

PATIENTS AND METHODS We utilized this technique in a short series of three cases who were admitted in our department for mild symptoms such as intermittent headache and dissociated sensory loss in the upper limbs, caused by a Chiari Malformation Type I. The patients were placed in the sitting position. We performed a reduced median suboccipital craniectomy and resection of the posterior arch of C1 adapted to the level of tonsil descent, from a limited superior half to a complete resection. Afterwards, we incised the outer dural layer, while sparing the inner one. Using a fine dissector, we then split apart the outer and inner layers to the margin of the craniectomy. Through the transparency of the inner layer and the arachnoid, the cerebellum and the medulla were visible and pulsating. An autologous fascia duraplasty was then performed. RESULTS The postoperative course was favorable in all cases, the patients being discharged without any deficits and with complete symptom resolution. Follow-up at 3, 6 and 12 months after surgery revealed a significant reduction in brainstem compression and syringomyelia. CONCLUSIONS Interlayer dural split technique can be used effectively in treating symptomatic cases of type I Chiari malformation in adults, with mild-to-moderate syringomyelia. It is less invasive than opening the dura and possibly more effective than decompressive craniectomy and C1 laminectomy alone. This technique must be validated in a larger case-control series.","Florian, Ioan Alexandru; Pop, Mihaela Maria; Timiș, Teodora Larisa; Florian, Ioan Stefan",International journal of clinical practice,https://doi.org/10.1111/ijcp.14148; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33709500/,878

Quality assurance (QA) teams of large and medium sized pharmaceutical companies generally conduct annual risk assessments of the PV system, based on retrospective review of data and pre-defined impact factors to plan for PV audits which require a high volume of manual work and resources. In addition, for companies of this size, auditing the entire ""universe"" of individual entities on an annual basis is generally prohibitive due to sheer volume. A risk assessment approach that enables efficient, temporal, and targeted PV audits is not currently available. METHODS In this project, we developed a statistical model to enable holistic and efficient risk assessment of certain aspects of the PV system. We used findings from a curated data set from Roche operational and quality assurance PV data, covering a span of over 8 years (2011-2019) and we modeled the risk with a logistic regression on quality PV risk indicators defined as data stream statistics over sliding windows. RESULTS We produced a model for each PV impact factor (e.g. 'Compliance to Individual Case Safety Report') for which we had enough features. For PV impact factors where modeling was not feasible, we used descriptive statistics. All the outputs were consolidated and displayed in a QA dashboard built on Spotfire®. CONCLUSION The model has been deployed as a quality decisioning tool available to Roche Quality professionals. It is used, for example, to inform the decision on which affiliates (i.e. pharmaceutical company commercial entities) undergo audit for PV activities. The model will be continuously monitored and fine-tuned to ensure its reliability.","Zou, Min; Barmaz, Yves; Preovolos, Melissa; Popko, Leszek; Ménard, Timothé",Therapeutic innovation & regulatory science,https://doi.org/10.1007/s43441-020-00205-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32804381/,878

These viruses contact the BC, C'C"", and FG loops on the upper tip of their receptor's most membrane-distal domain. This location corresponds to the newly defined canonical adhesive interface of nectins, but how viruses utilize this interface has remained unclear. Here we show that the same key residues in the BC and FG loops of nectin-4 govern binding to the MeV attachment protein hemagglutinin (H) and cell entry, nectin-4 homodimerization, and heterodimerization with nectin-1. On the other hand, residues in the C'C"" loop necessary for homo- and heterotypic interactions are dispensable for MeV-induced fusion and cell entry. Remarkably, the C'C"" loop governs dissociation of the nectin-4 and H ectodomains. We provide formal proof that H can interfere with the formation of stable nectin-1/nectin-4 heterodimers. Finally, while developing an alternative model to study MeV spread, we observed that polarized primary pig airway epithelial sheets cannot be infected. We show that a single amino acid variant in the BC loop of pig nectin-4 fully accounts for restricted MeV entry. Thus, the three loops forming the adhesive interface of nectin-4 have different roles in supporting MeV H association and dissociation and MeV-induced fusion. IMPORTANCE Different viruses utilize nectins as receptors. Nectins are immunoglobulin superfamily glycoproteins that mediate cell-cell adhesion in vertebrate tissues. They interact through an adhesive interface located at the top of their membrane-distal domain. How viruses utilize the three loops forming this interface has remained unclear. We demonstrate that while nectin-nectin interactions require residues in all three loops, the association of nectin-4 with the measles virus hemagglutinin requires only the BC and FG loops. However, we discovered that residues in the C'C"" loop modulate the dissociation of nectin-4 from the viral hemagglutinin. Analogous mechanisms may support cell entry of other viruses that utilize nectins or other cell adhesion molecules of the immunoglobulin superfamily as receptors.","Mateo, Mathieu; Navaratnarajah, Chanakha K; Willenbring, Robin C; Maroun, Justin W; Iankov, Ianko; Lopez, Marc; Sinn, Patrick L; Cattaneo, Roberto",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.02379-14; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25275122/,878

The concepts of incompleteness of reforms and forward momentum, which are at the core of this framework, have been adapted to reflect the realities of this policy. In this area, the decentralisation of responsibilities to the national level does de facto correspond to a forward momentum towards a more effective competition policy enforcement. The globalisation and the digitalisation of the economy, and more recently the COVID-19 pandemic, pose new challenges. However, as it can count on strong supranational institutions and on its indispensability for the preservation of the single market, EU competition policy should be able to adapt to the changing environment, without risk of disintegration.

Spike protein mutations increase transmission and potentially evade antibodies raised against the original sequence used in current vaccines. Our evaluation of serum neutralizing activity in both persons soon after SARS-CoV-2 infection (in April 2020 or earlier) or vaccination without prior infection confirmed that common spike mutations can reduce antibody antiviral activity. However, when the persons with prior infection were subsequently vaccinated, their antibodies attained an apparent biologic ceiling of neutralizing potency against all tested variants, equivalent to the original spike sequence. These findings indicate that additional antigenic exposure further improves antibody efficacy against variants.","Ibarrondo, F. J.; Hofmann, C.; Ali, A.; Ayoub, P.; Kohn, D. B.; Yang, O.

The credibility of a news report should not be considered in isolation. Rather, previously published news articles on the similar event could be used to assess the credibility of a news report. Inspired by this, we propose a BERT-based multimodal unreliable news detection framework, which captures both textual and visual information from unreliable articles utilising the contrastive learning strategy. The contrastive learner interacts with the unreliable news classifier to push similar credible news (or similar unreliable news) closer while moving news articles with similar content but opposite credibility labels away from each other in the multimodal embedding space. Experimental results on a COVID-19 related dataset, ReCOVery, show that our model outperforms a number of competitive baseline in unreliable news detection.","Zhang, Wenjia; Gui, Lin; He, Yulan",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.01850v2.pdf,878

Due to a lack of confidence in vaccination as a result of safety concerns, HCWs increasingly do not take the influenza vaccine. Consequently, there is a rising influenza burden which results in increasing mortality of vulnerable patients and absenteeism in hospitals. This policy brief aims to increase the awareness of HCWs regarding the importance of influenza vaccination uptake, which may result in improved patient and workplace safety. Policy Options: To increase vaccination coverage and reduce vaccine hesitancy among HCWs, a change in attitude towards and knowledge about the influenza vaccine is needed. Two potential approaches are presented in this paper. Firstly, a mandatory vaccination policy is discussed. Practical and ethical challenges of implementing a mandatory vaccination policy are considered. Secondly, information campaigns are described, consisting of three pillars: safety, information, and knowledge. Recommendations: It is recommended to initiate information campaigns focussing on patient safety. Furthermore, a structural approach to increase access to vaccination at the workplace must be taken. Higher vaccination rates of HCWs lead to an improved workplace safety. The recommended information campaign can also be used for other vaccine preventable diseases or in other situations, such as HCWs vaccine hesitancy regarding COVID-19 vaccines. Lessons from the COVID-19 pandemic regarding acceptance of vaccines should be considered for the improvement of future influenza vaccine uptake. © 2021 De Bruin et al.;.","de Bruin, J.; Machado, M.; Marie, N.; Saccà, R.; Verhoeven, J.; Clemens, T.",South Eastern European Journal of Public Health,https://doi.org/10.11576/seejph-4683,878

Methods: This systematic literature review assessed studies published between December 2019 and April 1, 2021 in Medline and Embase, which included studies that assessed educational settings from approximately January 2020 to January 2021. The inclusion criteria were based on the PCC framework (P-Population, C-Concept, C-Context). The study Population was restricted to people 1-17 years old (excluding neonatal transmission), the Concept was to assess child-to-child and child-to-adult transmission, while the Context was to assess specifically educational setting transmission clusters. Results: Fifteen studies met inclusion criteria, ranging from daycare centers to high schools and summer camps, while eight studies assessed the re-opening of schools in the 2020-2021 school year. In principle although there is sufficient evidence that children can both be infected by and transmit SARS-CoV-2 in school settings, the SAR remain relatively low -when NPI measures are implemented in parallel. Moreover, although the evidence was limited there was an indication that younger children may have a lower SAR than adolescents. Conclusions: Transmission in educational settings in 2020 was minimal -when NPI measures were implemented in parallel. However, with an upsurge of cases related to variants of concern, continuous surveillance and assessment of the evidence is warranted to ensure the maximum protection of the health of students and the educational workforce, while also minimising the numerous negative impacts that school closures may have on children.","Vardavas, C.; Nikitara, K.; Mathioudakis, A.; Hilton-Boon, M.; Phalkey, R.; Leonardi-Bee, J.; Pharris, A.; Deogan, C.; Suk, J.

Despite many excellent studies, the accurate measurement of the total CD8 T-cell response directed against a particular infection has been hampered by an incomplete knowledge of all CD8 T-cell epitopes and also by potential contributions of bystander expansion among CD8 T cells of irrelevant specificities. Here, we use several techniques to provide a more complete accounting of the CD8 T-cell response generated upon infection of C57BL/6 mice with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV). Eight days following infection, we found that 85 to 95% of CD8 T cells exhibit an effector phenotype as indicated by granzyme B, 1B11, CD62L, CD11a, and CD127 expression. We demonstrate that CD8 T-cell expansion is due to cells that divide >7 times, whereas heterologous viral infections only elicited <3 divisions among bystander memory CD8 T cells. Furthermore, we found that approximately 80% of CD8 T cells in spleen were specific for ten different LCMV-derived epitopes at the peak of primary infection. These data suggest that following a single LCMV infection, effector CD8 T cells divide > or =15 times and account for at least 80%, and possibly as much as 95%, of the CD8 T-cell pool. Moreover, the response targeted a very broad array of peptide major histocompatibility complexes (MHCs), even though we examined epitopes derived from only two of the four proteins encoded by the LCMV genome and C57BL/6 mice only have two MHC class I alleles. These data illustrate the potential enormity, specificity, and breadth of CD8 T-cell responses to viral infection and demonstrate that bystander activation does not contribute to CD8 T-cell expansion.","Masopust, David; Murali-Krishna, Kaja; Ahmed, Rafi",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17151096/,878

The complete N and E gene sequences of HCoV-NL63 were amplified from clinical sample by RT-PCR, then were cloned into the pCF-T and pUCm-T vectors respectively and sequenced. The complete sequences of N and E genes were submitted to GenBank by Sequin and compared with N and E genes of prototype HCoV-NL63 and the other coronaviruses published in GenBank. The secondary structure and the characteristics of sample BJ8081 N and E proteins were predicted by bioinformatics. It was indicated that the N and E genes amplified from sample BJ8081 were 1134 bp and 234 bp in length and the predicted proteins including 377 amino acids and 77 amino acids, respectively. The data suggested that the region of amino acids 78-85 within N protein probably was the conserved region for all coronaviruses identified so far including HCoV-NL63.

Selective internal radiation therapy (SIRT) performed via the TRA can enhance patient comfort, compared with the traditional transfemoral approach (TFA), by allowing immediate ambulation and precluding potential complications associated with the TFA, such as closure device injury or retroperitoneal hematoma. We report our initial experience with and technique for using the TRA for SIRT. MATERIALS AND METHODS Between May 1, 2012, and April 30, 2015, a total of 574 procedures, including planning angiograms (n = 329) and infusions of 90Y (n = 245), were performed for 318 patients (mean age, 64.5 years). Of the 245 patients who received 90Y infusions, 52 had SIRT performed with the use of a permanent single-use implant of 90Y resin microspheres and 193 had SIRT performed with the use of millions of small glass microspheres containing radioactive 90Y. Procedural details, technical success, the radial artery (RA) occlusion rate noted at 30 days (as assessed via pulse examination), and the major and minor adverse events noted at 30 days were evaluated. RESULTS Technical success was achieved in 561 of 574 cases (97.7%). The reasons for crossover to use of the TFA included an RA loop (n = 2), RA occlusion (n = 9), and type D response as determined by use of a Barbeau test (n = 2). Patients had undergone between zero and six previous TRA procedures. The mortality rate at 30 days was 0%. Superficial bruising occurred in 13 of 574 cases (2.3%). A grade 2 hematoma that required a second nonocclusive hemostasis cuff occurred in one case. Transient forearm numbness or pain occurred in two of 574 cases. One patient had a transient convulsive event occur after receiving intraarterial infusion of verapamil. RA occlusion occurred in nine of 574 cases (1.6%). CONCLUSION Use of the TRA for SIRT is safe, feasible, and well tolerated and is associated with high rates of technical success and rare complications.","Bishay, Vivian L; Biederman, Derek M; Ward, Thomas J; van der Bom, Imramsjah Martijn J; Patel, Rahul S; Kim, Edward; Nowakowski, Francis S; Lookstein, Robert A; Fischman, Aaron M",AJR.

Forty (80%) of the 50 samples showed concordant results between S-RV and VC-IF; 24 of these showed the same positive and 16 showed the same negative results. Among the 10 discrepant samples, 9 were S-RV-positive and VC-IF-negative. Six were obtained in patients with lower respiratory tract infection. Only 1 sample was VC-IF-positive and S-RV-negative. This patient had pneumonia. In 3 cases, more than 1 virus was identified by S-RV. The total running time of S-RV was 6 hr, which shortens the detection time for the viral presence by 2 workdays compared to VC-IF. In conclusion, S-RV is reliable, rapid, relatively easy to perform, and able to detect more than 1 virus simultaneously.

Association of this stable signal peptide (SSP) has been shown to be essential for intracellular trafficking and proteolytic maturation of the GP-C complex. We identify here a specific and previously unrecognized role of SSP in pH-dependent membrane fusion. Amino acid substitutions that alter the positive charge at lysine K33 in SSP affect the ability of GP-C to mediate cell-cell fusion and the threshold pH at which membrane fusion is triggered. Based on the presumed location of K33 at or near the luminal domain of SSP, we postulate that SSP interacts with the membrane-proximal or transmembrane regions of the G2 fusion protein.

In the community, the use of face masks is increasing world-wide, but documentation for the efficacy of this remedy is lacking. This trial investigates whether the use of face masks in the community will reduce wearers' risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS This study will be a two-arm, unblinded, randomised controlled trial. We will include adults (>18 years of age) without prior confirmed COVID-19 or symptoms suggestive of COVID-19, who spend more than three hours per day outside the home with exposure to other people. A total of 6,000 participants are randomly assigned 1:1 to use face masks or not for a 30-day period during the pandemic. Participants will perform self-testing; quick test for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (immunoglobulin M (IgM) and immunoglobulin G (IgG)) (the Livzon lateral flow test) and oropharyngeal/nasal swabs for viral detection using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The primary endpoint following the 30-day study period is the difference in the number of SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals between the two study groups as assessed by a positive nasopharyngeal swap, a positive antibody test or a hospital-based diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. CONCLUSIONS We will study whether a face mask protects the wearer of the mask against SARS-CoV-2 infection.

192462,[Dose of glucocorticosteroids in the treatment of severe acute respiratory syndrome].,2009,"BACKGROUND These last years adolescents in transition to young adulthood (ATYA) have become a new matter of research. This population encounter specific issues and challenges regarding their mental health particularly when they have attained age boundaries and deal with the issue of transition from child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS) to adult mental health services (AMHS). Many key questions regarding how to sustain continuity of mental health care for ATYA during transition remain. The aim of this paper is to review recent literature in the domain to identify dimensions that should be considered to improve ATYA transition from CAMHS to AMHS. SUBJECTS AND METHODS A qualitative literature review was performed in Scopus-Elsevier database using the PRISMA method as reporting guidelines. Only papers discussing dimensions involved in the transition process from CAMHS to AMHS were considered. We restricted the review to researches published between 2010 and 2020. RESULTS We identified 85 potential researches, after filtering; only 10 articles were finally included in the qualitative synthesis of the literature. Five main dimensions were identified: patient, professional, organization, policy, and ethic related. Those dimensions should be considered in order to improve ATYA transition process out of CAMHS to AMHS. CONCLUSION This work contributes to identify principal dimensions that should be considered by mental health professionals and organizations in order to improve ATYA transition from CAMHS to AMHS.","Lepiece, Brice; Patigny, Pierre; Dubois, Thomas; Jacques, Denis; Zdanowicz, Nicolas",Psychiatria Danubina,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32890381/,878

Thirty-nine medical students who had used the Macintosh blade to intubate a manikin fewer than 3 times were recruited. The participants performed sequential intubations on the manikin in two simulated settings that included a normal airway and a difficult airway (tongue edema). The intubation time, success rate of intubation, Cormack-Lehane grade at laryngoscopy, and difficulty using the device were recorded. Each participant was asked to identify the device that was most useful. The intubation time decreased significantly and by a similar amount to the McGRATH MAC and C-MAC compared to the Macintosh blade (P < 0.001 and P = 0.017, resp.). In the difficult airway, the intubation times were similar among the three devices. The McGRATH MAC and C-MAC significantly increased the success rate of intubation, improved the Cormack-Lehane grade, and decreased the difficulty score compared to the Macintosh blade in both airway settings. The majority of participants selected the McGRATH MAC as the most useful device.

In this study, we ask what type and quantity of data are needed for useful estimation of the initial reproduction number (R). It is possible to estimate R from case incidence data alone when the growing incidence of cases displays a wave pattern, because the pattern provides information about the serial interval (the time elapsed between the onset of symptoms of a case and symptom onset in individuals infected by that case). When the mode of the serial interval distribution is small, 1.5 days or less, there is generally no informative wave pattern in the observed series of daily incidences. The precision of the estimate of R is then improved substantially by having some observations on the serial interval. For an infectious disease with characteristics such as those of influenza, an estimate of R able to inform plans to mitigate transmission is obtained when the cumulative incidence of cases reaches about 300 and about 10 observations on the serial interval are available.","Becker, N G; Wang, D; Clements, M",Euro surveillance : bulletin Europeen sur les maladies transmissibles = European communicable disease bulletin,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20619130/,878
196729,[Immunoinformatic analysis for the epitopes on SARS virus surface protein].,2003,"Animal diseases due to enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) typically appear as severe watery diarrhoea during the first few days of life (also a few days after weaning in pigs). ETEC adhere to the small intestinal microvilli without inducing morphological lesions and produce enterotoxins acting locally on enterocytes. This action results in the hypersecretion (of water and electrolytes) and reduced absorption. Adhesins and toxins are the two prominent virulence attributes of ETEC and the level of knowledge of these factors determines the chances for successful prevention and therapy of the disease. For animal ETEC the most common adhesins are the fimbriae (pili) on the surface: F4(K88), F5(K99), F6(987P), F41, F42, F165, F17 and F18. Enterotoxins (extracellular proteins or peptides) of animal ETEC are classified as heat-labile (LT) and heat-stable (ST) enterotoxins with further subdivisions (LTh-I, LTp-I, LTIIa, LTIIb, STaH, STaP, STb) according to antigenic and biological differences. Fimbriae and LT enterotoxins are made up of large molecular weight proteins which facilitate their utilisation in vaccines and their detection using immunodiagnostic systems. The adhesive fimbriae and enterotoxins of animal ETEC are plasmid determined (except F41 and F17). Virulence gene probes (DNA hybridisation, PCR) are specific and sensitive diagnostic and epidemiologic tools for the detection of ETEC. Based on genetic typing, the ETEC, in spite of limited serogroups, seem to represent a population of E. coli with a diverse genetic background.","Nagy, B; Fekete, P Z",Veterinary research,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10367358/,878

OBJECTIVES To assess South Africans' understanding of and response to COVID-19 during the first week of the country's lockdown period. METHODS An online survey was conducted in SA from 27 March to 2 April 2020. The survey was distributed widely among several websites and social media networks, including on a data-free platform. Descriptive statistics of knowledge, risk perception, access to and trust in information sources, and public and media opinions were calculated. Estimates were benchmarked to the 2019 national adult population estimates. RESULTS Of the 55 823 participants, the majority (83.4%) correctly identified the main symptoms of COVID-19. Over 90% had correct knowledge of the incubation period, with lower rates for 18 - 29-year-olds. Knowledge of symptoms and the incubation period varied significantly by population group (p<0.001), dwelling type (p<0.001) and sex (p<0.001). A quarter (24.9%) perceived themselves as at high risk of contracting COVID-19. Risk perception varied by age, population group, employment status and dwelling type (p<0.001). The most prevalent COVID-19 information sources were government sources (72.9%), news websites/apps (56.3%), satellite television (51.6%) and local television (51.4%).

SARS-CoV from human has shown some variations but its origin is still unknown. The genotyping and phylogeny of SARS-CoV were analyzed and reported in this paper. METHODS Full or partial genomes of 44 SARS-CoV strains were collected from GenBank. The genotype, single nucleotide polymorphism and phylogeny of these SARS-CoV strains were analyzed by molecular biological, bioinformatic and epidemiological methods. RESULTS There were 188 point mutations in the 33 virus full genomes with the counts of mutation mounting to 297. Further analysis was carried out among 36 of 188 loci with more than two times of mutation. All the 36 mutation loci occurred in coding sequences and 22 loci were non-synonymous. The gene mutation rates of replicase 1AB, S2 domain of spike glycoprotein and nucleocapsid protein were lower (0.079% - 0.103%). There were 4 mutation loci in S1 domain of spike glycoprotein. The gene mutation rate of ORF10 was the highest (3.333%) with 4 mutation loci in this small domain (120 bp) and 3 of 4 loci related to deletion mutation. By bioinformatics processing and analysis, the nucleotides at 7 loci of genome (T:T:A:G:T:C:T/C:G:G:A:C:T:C) can classify SARS-CoV into two types. Therefore a novel definition is put forward that according to these 7 loci of mutation, 40 strains of SARS-CoV in GenBank can be grouped into two genotypes, T:T:A:G:T:C:T and C:G:G:A:C:T:C, and named as SARS-CoV Yexin genotype and Xiaohong genotype. The two genotypes can be further divided into some sub-genotypes. These genotypes can also be approved by phylogenetic tree of three levels of 44 loci of mutation, spike glycoprotein gene and complete genome sequence. Compared to various strains among SARS-CoV Yexin genotype and Xiaohong genotype, GD01 strain of Yexin genotype is more closely related to SARS-CoV like-virus from animals. CONCLUSION The results mentioned above suggest that SARS-CoV is responding to host immunological pressures and experiencing variation which provide clues, information and evidence of molecular biology for the clinical pathology, vaccine developing and epidemic investigation.","Wang, Zhi-gang; Li, Lan-juan; Luo, Yun; Zhang, Jun-yan; Wang, Min-ya; Cheng, Su-yun; Zhang, Yan-jun; Wang, Xiao-meng; Lu, Yi-yu; Wu, Nan-ping; Mei, Ling-ling; Wang, Zan-xin",Chinese medical journal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14733771/,878

HiSPECT uses multipinhole collimators adapted to a clinical SPECT scanner, together with a dedicated iterative reconstruction program. This technique provides both high spatial resolution and an improvement in sensitivity. Six male Balb/c mice received 9.8 +/- 4.0 MBq of the In 111-labeled liposomes. The measurements started directly after the injection and tomographic data were acquired in steps of 5 minutes. The regional evaluation displayed a high initial uptake of liposomes in the lungs (45.4%), which decreased to 25.1% after 30 minutes and to below 2% after 48 hours. In contrast, liver uptake increased in the first 30 minutes from 13.1 to 21.2% and remained relatively stable at 24.4% (24 hours) and 18.8% (48 hours). The data are interpreted as a slow shift of liposomes from the lungs into the liver and later to other organs such as the spleen and bladder. This study shows that the HiSPECT technique is capable of dynamically visualizing the uptake behavior of radioactively labeled liposomes in vivo with high temporal and spatial resolution.","Wirrwar, Andreas; Buchholz, Doris; Gottschalk, Oliver; Viehöver, Sandra; Schramm, Nils Uwe; Müller, Hans-Wilhelm",Molecular imaging,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19123993/,878

222815,[Dynamic inflammatory response in a critically ill COVID-19 patient treated with corticosteroids],2020,"The coordinated generation of mechanical forces by cardiac myocytes is required for proper heart function. Myofibrils are the functional contractile units of force production within individual cardiac myocytes. At the molecular level, myosin motors form cross-bridges with actin filaments and use ATP to convert chemical energy into mechanical forces. The energetic efficiency of the cross-bridge cycle is influenced by the viscous damping of myofibril contraction. The viscoelastic response of myofibrils is an emergent property of their individual mechanical components. Previous studies have implicated titin-actin interactions, cell-ECM adhesion, and microtubules as regulators of the viscoelastic response of myofibrils. Here we probed the viscoelastic response of myofibrils using laser-assisted dissection. As a proof-of-concept, we found actomyosin contractility was required to endow myofibrils with their viscoelastic response, with blebbistatin treatment resulting in decreased myofibril tension and viscous damping. Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is a key regulator of cell-ECM adhesion, microtubule stability, and myofibril assembly. We found inhibition of FAK signaling altered the viscoelastic properties of myofibrils. Specifically, inhibition of FAK resulted in increased viscous damping of myofibril retraction following laser ablation. This damping was not associated with acute changes in the electrophysiological properties of cardiac myocytes. These results implicate FAK as a regulator of mechanical properties of myofibrils.","Taneja, Nilay; Bersi, Matthew R; Rasmussen, Megan L; Gama, Vivian; Merryman, W David; Burnette, Dylan T",Cytoskeleton (Hoboken.

238735,[Pregnant women complicated with COVID-19: a clinical analysis of 3 cases],2020,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To examine the evidence that the dietary quality of children changed between the period preceding the COVID-19 pandemic and the first year during the pandemic. RECENT FINDINGS: A systematic review of the evidence for dietary changes occurring as a result of the pandemic-related restrictions, in Part I of this article, yielded 38 original research articles. These articles had conflicting results, some describing improvements in overall quality and some describing deteriorations. As a whole the studies were characterized by a low study quality, and children were poorly represented. Taken together, these studies do not provide enough evidence to draw conclusions about whether dietary habits changed or not as a result of the pandemic. However, in a wider, narrative review of the psychosocial changes occurring as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the known associations of these factors with a dietary intake in Part II, we conclude that there is a reason to expect that the dietary quality of children might have been adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. One the one hand, the literature fails to provide conclusive evidence on changes in the dietary quality of children resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. On the other hand, the broader literature supports the hypothesis that children's dietary quality will have declined during the pandemic. Taken together, we urgently need more high-quality research on children's changes in dietary intake occurring over the pandemic. This will provide important information on whether any potential long-term consequences of such changes, if they exist, need to be examined and ameliorated.","Campbell, Heather; Wood, Alexis C",Curr. nutr. rep,,878

The results of structural equation modeling (SEM) show that COVID-19 risk perception and trust in science both independently predict compliance with COVID-19 prevention guidelines, while the remaining variables in the model (political conservatism, religious orthodoxy, conspiracy ideation and intellectual curiosity) do so via the mediating role of trust in science.

All these variables were recorded for the same time interval of 2019 as well. The weekly change of the workload of urology during pandemic period was evaluated, also the workload of urology and the distributions of certain urological surgeries were compared between the pandemic period and the same time interval of the year 2019. RESULTS: A total of 51 centres participated in the study. The number of outpatients, inpatients, urological surgeries and daily interventions were found to be dramatically decreased by the 3rd week of pandemics in state hospitals and tertiary referral centres; however, the daily urological practice were similar in private practice hospitals throughout the pandemic period. When the workload of urology in pandemic period and the same time interval of the year 2019 were compared, a huge decrease was observed in all variables during pandemic period.

CONCLUSIONS: Covid-19 pandemic significantly affected the routine daily urological practice likewise other subspecialties and priority was given to emergent and non-deferrable surgeries by urologists in concordance with published clinical guidelines.","Bozkurt, Ozan; Sen, Volkan; Irer, Bora; Sagnak, Levent; Onal, Bulent; Tanidir, Yiloren; Karabay, Emre; Kaya, Coskun; Ceyhan, Erman; Baser, Aykut; Duran, Mesut Berkan; Suer, Evren; Celen, Ilker; Selvi, Ismail; Ucer, Oktay; Karakoc, Sedat; Sarikaya, Ege; Ozden, Ender; Deger, Dogan; Egriboyun, Sedat; Ongun, Sakir; Gurboga, Ozgur; Asutay, Mehmet Kazim; Kazaz, Ilke Onur; Yilmaz, Ismail Onder; Kisa, Erdem; Demirkiran, Engin Denizhan; Horsanali, Ozan; Akarken, Ilker; Kizer, Onur; Eren, Huseyin; Ucar, Murat; Cebeci, Oguz Ozden; Kizilay, Fuat; Comez, Kaan; Mercimek, Mehmet Necmettin; Ozkent, Mehmet Serkan; Izol, Volkan; Gudeloglu, Ahmet; Ozturk, Bilgin; Akbaba, Kaan Turker; Polat, Salih; Gucuk, Adnan; Ziyan, Avni; Selcuk, Berin; Akdeniz, Firat; Turgut, Hasan; Sabuncu, Kubilay; Kaygisiz, Onur; Ersahin, Veli",Int J Clin Pract,,878
244988,[Roles of multidisciplinary team in diagnosis and treatment of suspected cases of COVID-19],2020,"This study aimed to characterize risk groups for COVID-19 in Brazil and to estimate the number of individuals living in the same household with persons in the risk group. Data were used from the Brazilian National Health Survey (PNS) of 2013. To characterize the risk groups, a binary multiple logistic regression model was adjusted in which the response variable was the presence or absence of at least one condition associated with COVID-19 and the explanatory variables were age, sex, major geographic region, color or race, schooling, and workforce status of the residents interviewed by the study. The results show that age is the principal risk factor for comorbidities associated with COVID-19, but the risk is also greater for persons in more vulnerable categories, such as those with less schooling and blacks and browns. An estimated 68.7% of Brazilians were living with at least one person in the risk group: 30.3% lived with at least one elderly individual and another 38.4% had no elderly individuals in their households, but there was at least one adult resident with preexisting medical conditions. The proportion of persons living in households with at least one resident in the risk group was 50% or greater for all ages and increased from 35 years of age, but there were also high numbers of persons 10 to 25 years of age living with persons in the risk group. The results suggest that due to the difficulties in avoiding close household contact, the exclusive isolation of specific population groups is not a feasible strategy in the Brazilian context, but should be combined with social distancing of the population as a whole.","Borges, Gabriel Mendes; Crespo, Claudio Dutra",Cad Saude Publica,,878
249755,[Impact of cardiovascular metabolic diseases on COVID-19: review of recent progress],2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant negative influence on energy consumption in 2020. On April 7, 2020, in response to the rapid spread of the infection, the Japanese government imposed a state of emergency. This action impacted energy consumption, energy production, and electricity prices. This study compares the impact of a reduction in load demand on renewable energy in the Japan public power grid under a state of emergency declaration (April to May 2020). Using publicly available data, comparisons are made for Kyushu, Tokyo, Kansai, and Hokkaido and assessed in relation to epidemic severity and geographical distribution. The results can be summarized as follows. (1) The consumption profiles and amounts of power consumption reduction are different in different areas. Tokyo shows the largest share of reduced load, followed by Kansai, Kyushu, and Hokkaido. The load reduction was mainly seen during the day, which reflects the differences in people's activities relative to the same period in 2019. (2) Different means of power dispatch, including power generators, energy storage systems, and transmission lines are used and compared in terms of responses to the changes in electricity consumption profile. (3) The overall fall in total load demand and the change in load sequence affected the integration and curtailment of photovoltaic power generation and consequentially caused the electricity price to drop. This paper clarifies the effects of COVID-19 on the public power grids of Japan. Further, it establishes the impact on policymakers in relation to the development of renewable energy. © 2021 Author(s).","Tingting Xu, A.; Weijun Gao, B.; Yanxue Li, C.; Fanyue Qian, D.",Journal of Renewable and Sustainable Energy,,878

258534,Exploring early prevention and control of COVID-19 outbreak based on system dynamics model analysis,2021,"Myocarditis following mRNA COVID-19 vaccination has recently been reported to health authorities in the United States and other countries. Cases predominately occur in young adult males within four days following the second dose of either the Moderna (mRNA-1273) or Pfizer-BioNTech (BNT162b2) vaccines. Although the number of cases reported have been small in comparison with the large number of people vaccinated, myocarditis may be a rare adverse reaction to the COVID-19 vaccination that is now only becoming apparent due to the widespread use of the vaccine. In this article, we present a case of a 20-year-old male with no prior medical history who presented to the emergency department (ED) with chest pain. He had received the BNT162b2 vaccine two days prior to his presentation to the ED. The patient had an elevated troponin at 89 ng/L which increased on repeat examination. His electrocardiogram showed diffuse concave ST segment elevations and a later MRI confirmed the diagnosis of myocarditis. Based on these findings, the patient was diagnosed with myocarditis. The patient had a previous infection with SARS-CoV-2 approximately two months prior to the onset of his symptoms, but since he had fully recovered before the time of his presentation to the ED, it is unlikely that the infection caused the myocarditis. To our knowledge, this is the first published case of myocarditis following BNT162b3 vaccination.","Watkins, Kevin; Griffin, Gregory; Septaric, Kristen; Simon, Erin L",Am. j. emerg. med,,878

DESIGN: An online survey consisting of closed-set and open-ended questions distributed within the UK to gain insights into experiences of interactions involving face coverings, and of the impact of face coverings on communication. SAMPLE: Four hundred and sixty members of the general public were recruited via snowball sampling. People with hearing loss were intentionally oversampled to more thoroughly assess the effect of face coverings in this group. RESULTS: With few exceptions, participants reported that face coverings negatively impacted hearing, understanding, engagement, and feelings of connection with the speaker. Impacts were greatest when communicating in medical situations. People with hearing loss were significantly more impacted than those without hearing loss. Face coverings impacted communication content, interpersonal connectedness, and willingness to engage in conversation; they increased anxiety and stress, and made communication fatiguing, frustrating and embarrassing - both as a speaker wearing a face covering, and when listening to someone else who is wearing one. CONCLUSIONS: Face coverings have far-reaching impacts on communication for everyone, but especially for people with hearing loss. These findings illustrate the need for communication-friendly face-coverings, and emphasise the need to be communication-aware when wearing a face covering.","Saunders, Gabrielle H; Jackson, Iain R; Visram, Anisa S",Int J Audiol,,878

267480,[An increased neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio is an early warning signal of severe COVID-19],2020,"A series of vaccine incidents have stimulated vaccine hesitance in China over the last decade. Many scholars have studied the institutional management of these incidents, but a qualitative study of stakeholders' perspectives on vaccine hesitancy in China is missing. To address this lacuna, we conducted in-depth interviews and collected online data to explore diverse stakeholders' narratives on vaccine hesitance. Our analysis shows the different perspectives of medical experts, journalists, parents, and self-defined vaccination victims on vaccination and vaccination hesitance. Medical experts generally consider vaccines, despite some flaws, as safe, and they consider most vaccine safety incidents to be related to coupling symptoms, not to vaccinations. Some parents agree with medical experts, but most do not trust vaccine safety and do not want to put their children at risk. Media professionals, online medical experts, and doctors who do not need to align with the political goal of maintaining a high vaccination rate are less positive about vaccination and consider vaccine hesitance a failure of expert-lay communication in China. Our analysis exhibits the tensions of medical expert and lay perspectives on vaccine hesitance, and suggests that vaccination experts 'see like a state', which is a finding consistent with other studies that have identified the over-politicization of expert-lay communication in Chinese public discourse. Chinese parents need space to express their concerns so that vaccination programs can attune to them.","Yang, Ronghui; Penders, Bart; Horstman, Klasien",,,878

There is a robust evidence base demonstrating its cost effectiveness in comparison with conventional class-based teaching; however, the transition to this new paradigm of learning for nursing and midwifery courses has been difficult in low-income countries. While there are notable efforts to increase internet and education access to health care professionals, not much is known about ODL for nurses and midwives in East African countries. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this scoping review is to understand whether ODL programs for nursing and midwifery education exist, the drivers of their adoption, their implementation, the topics/courses covered, their acceptability, and their impacts in East African countries. METHODS: The scoping review methodology employs the framework developed by Arksey and O'Malley. Using an exploratory approach, a two-stage screening process consisting of a title and abstract scan and a full-text review will be used to determine the eligibility of articles. To be included, articles must report on an existing ODL initiative for nurses and midwives in Uganda, Tanzania, and Kenya. All articles will be independently assessed for eligibility by pairs of reviewers, and all eligible articles will be abstracted and charted in duplicate using a standardized form. RESULTS: Details of ODL for nursing and midwifery education initiatives and study outcomes will be summarized in a table. The extracted data will undergo exploratory descriptive analysis, and the results will be classified into learner and clinical outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence on ODL for nursing and midwifery education will inform the ongoing development and restructuring of health care professional education in East Africa amidst the COVID-19 pandemic.

However, models trained/tested on the same in-distribution data may rely on the inherent data biases for successful prediction, failing to generalize on out-of-distribution samples or CT with different scanning protocols. Early attempts have partly addressed bias-mitigation and generalization through augmentation or re-sampling, but are still limited by collection costs and the difficulty of quantifying bias in medical images. In this work, we propose Mixing-AdaSIN; a bias mitigation method that uses a generative model to generate de-biased images by mixing texture information between different labeled CT scans with semantically similar features. Here, we use Adaptive Structural Instance Normalization (AdaSIN) to enhance de-biasing generation quality and guarantee structural consistency. Following, a classifier trained with the generated images learns to correctly predict the label without bias and generalizes better. To demonstrate the efficacy of our method, we construct a biased COVID-19 vs. bacterial pneumonia dataset based on CT protocols and compare with existing state-of-the-art de-biasing methods. Our experiments show that classifiers trained with de-biased generated images report improved in-distribution performance and generalization on an external COVID-19 dataset.","Kang, Myeongkyun; Chikontwe, Philip; Luna, Miguel; Hong, Kyung Soo; Ahn, June Hong; Park, Sang Hyun",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.14255v2.pdf,878

The present study's objective was to know the variables associated with the risk of major depression during confinement due to SAR-CoV-2 in patients with AS and COPD in the Colombian Caribbean. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: An online cross-sectional observational study was done with the participation of patients diagnosed with AS or COPD. AS and COPD patients completed the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) to identify a major depressive disorder risk. RESULTS: Two hundred seventy-seven patients diagnosed with AS or COPD aged 18 to 69 (M=60.4, SD=17.6) participated. The risk of major depression was assessed using the PHQ-9 sent online after telephone contact with the participants. 30.7% of the patients during the last month reported a risk of major depression, and it was associated with a history of major depressive disorder (OR=4.39, 95% CI 1.53-12.67) and medical comorbidity (OR=1.69, 95% CI 1.00-2.86). CONCLUSIONS: The depression risk is associated with a history of depressive disorder and medical comorbidity in patients with AS and COPD. Medical history is the leading risk factor for depression during confinement.

OBJECTIVE: To describe patterns of viral polymerase chain reaction (PCR) positivity and evaluate their correlations with seroconversion and disease severity. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: 3 designated specialty care centers for COVID-19 in Wuhan, China. PARTICIPANTS: 3192 adult patients with COVID-19. MEASUREMENTS: Demographic, clinical, and laboratory data. RESULTS: Among 12 780 reverse transcriptase PCR tests for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 that were done, 24.0% had positive results. In 2142 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, the viral positivity rate peaked within the first 3 days. The median duration of viral positivity was 24.0 days (95% CI, 18.9 to 29.1 days) in critically ill patients and 18.0 days (CI, 16.8 to 19.1 days) in noncritically ill patients. Being critically ill was an independent risk factor for longer viral positivity (hazard ratio, 0.700 [CI, 0.595 to 0.824]; P < 0.001). In patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, the IgM-positive rate was 19.3% in the first week, peaked in the fifth week (81.5%), and then decreased steadily to around 55% within 9 to 10 weeks. The IgG-positive rate was 44.6% in the first week, reached 93.3% in the fourth week, and then remained high. Similar antibody responses were seen in clinically diagnosed cases. Serum inflammatory markers remained higher in critically ill patients. Among noncritically ill patients, a higher proportion of those with persistent viral positivity had low IgM titers (<100 AU/mL) during the entire course compared with those with short viral positivity. LIMITATION: Retrospective study and irregular viral and serology testing. CONCLUSION: The rate of viral PCR positivity peaked within the initial few days. Seroconversion rates peaked within 4 to 5 weeks. Dynamic laboratory index changes corresponded well to clinical signs, the recovery process, and disease severity. Low IgM titers (<100 AU/mL) are an independent risk factor for persistent viral positivity.

This study describes the experiences after repurposing a PICU and its staff for adult critical care within a state mandated COVID-19 hospital and compares the outcomes to adult patients admitted to the institution's MICU during the same period. Design: A retrospective chart review was performed to analyze outcomes for the adults admitted to the PICU and MICU during the 27-day period the PICU was incorporated into the institution's adult critical care surge plan. Setting: Tertiary care state University hospital. Patients: Critically ill adult patients with proven or suspected COVID-19. Interventions: To select the most ideal adult patients for PICU admission a tiered approach that incorporated older patients with more comorbidities at each stage was implemented. Measurements and Main Results: There were 140 patients admitted to the MICU and 9 patients admitted to the PICU during this period. The mean age of the adult patients admitted to the PICU was lower (49.1 vs. 63.2 p = 0.017). There was no statistically significant difference in the number of comorbidities, intubation rates, days of ventilation, dialysis or LOS. Patients selected for PICU care did not have coronary artery disease, CHF, cerebrovascular disease or COPD. Mean admission Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score was lower in patients admitted to the PICU (4 vs. 6.4, p = 0.017) with similar rates of survival to discharge (66.7 vs. 44.4%, p = 0.64). Conclusion: Outcomes for the adult patients who received care in the PICU did not appear to be worse than those who were admitted to the MICU during this time. While limited by a small sample size, this single center cohort study revealed that careful assessment of critical illness considering age and type of co-morbidities may be a safe and effective approach in determining which critically ill adult patients with known or suspected COVID-19 are the most appropriate for PICU admission in general hospitals with primary management by its physicians and nurses.","Gist, R.

The aim of this study was to develop, validate and perform the reliability of the questionnaire ""Physical exercise (PE) level before and during social isolation (PEF-COVID19)"" to evaluate the level of PE during the social distancing due to the COVID-19 pandemic and to try to identify changes in the daily life of the individuals. METHODS: This transversal study was developed to measure psychometric properties of the questionnaire PEF-COVID19. The survey was divided into 4 sections including subjects' characterization, social isolation update and physical exercise performed, pain, anxiety and stress before and during COVID-19 pandemic. After the survey construction in Portuguese language (Brazil), the survey was transferred to an online digital platform (Google® forms). The Construct, Clarity and Relevance Validation strategy was judged by a panel of experts and the validity index (VI) were calculated. The reliability was evaluated through the test-retest interrater reliability and measured through the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and Kappa coefficient (KC). RESULTS: Twenty-five experts participated of the survey validity and 34 respondents from the target population participated of the test-retest reliability. The general average measures for VI were all above 0.84 and test-retest ICC and KC were 0.89 and 0.88, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This survey was considered valid and reliable to be applied to the general population over 18 years-old to investigate the PE practice and psychological aspects during the social distancing due to the COVID-19 pandemic, a public health problem.","Da Cunha de Sá-Caputo, Danúbia; Sonza, Anelise; Bachur, José Alexandre; Bernardo-Filho, Mario",Acta Biomed,,878

METHODS: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the published literature in PubMed, Embase and Cochrane databases through April 9, 2020 for studies evaluating D-dimer levels in SARS-COV-2 infected patients with and without a composite clinical endpoint, defined as the presence of all-cause of mortality, Intensive care unit (ICU) admission or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). A total of six studies were included in the meta-analysis. RESULTS: D-dimers were significantly increased in patients with the composite clinical end point than in those without (SMD, 1.67 ug/ml (95% CI, 0.72-2.62 ug/ml). The SMD of the studies (Tang et al, Zhou et al, Chen et al), which used only mortality as an outcome measure was 2.5 ug/mL (95% CI, 0.62-4.41 ug/ml). CONCLUSION: We conclude that SARS-CoV-2 infected patients with elevated D-dimers have worse clinical outcomes (all-cause mortality, ICU admission or ARDS) and thus measurement of D-dimers can guide in clinical decision making.","Bansal, Agam; Singh, Achintya D; Jain, Vardhmaan; Aggarwal, Manik; Gupta, Samiksha; Padappayil, Rana Prathap; Nadeem, Mahum; Joshi, Sonya; Mian, Agrima; Greathouse, Tyler; Wells, David; Gupta, Mohak; Khan, Muhammad Zarrar",Heart lung,,878

We attempt at developing a conceptual tool to support making rational decisions relevant to the optimisation of the allocation of patients into accessible medical facilities. The strategy is based on a version of the Abelian Sandpile model for the Self-Organised Criticality, with the idea of testing the paradigm for the management of patients among the COVID-19 hospitals in Italian regions.

In response, they ‘set forth a series of concrete ethical proposals with which to face the successive waves of COVID-19 infection, as well as other future pandemics’: these include the duty of health authorities ‘to plan for foreseeable ethical challenges during a health emergency’, and the duty of ‘public organisms at the national level, such as national committees on ethics…to prepare the protocols for care and treatment that would help physicians and healthcare workers to manage the predictable uncertainty and distress in healthcare emergencies’. Turning to a currently pressing international aspect of resource allocation, Jecker and colleagues, in ‘Vaccine ethics: an ethical framework for global distribution of COVID-19 vaccines’4 marshal an impressive amount of empirical research and ethical theory to argue that ‘in order to accelerate development and fair, efficient vaccine allocation…vaccines should be distributed globally, with priority to frontline and essential workers worldwide’: ‘ethical values to guide vaccine distribution’, they conclude, should ‘highlight values of helping the neediest, reducing health disparities, saving lives and keeping society functioning’.

The objective of the study is to evaluate the performance of a protocol for ambulatory management of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia regarding readmissions, admission into the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and deaths. Also, to identify unfavorable prognostic factors that increase the risk of readmission. This is a prospective cohort study of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia discharged from the emergency ward of Infanta Cristina Hospital (Madrid, Spain) that met the criteria of the hospital protocol for outpatient management. We describe outcomes of those patients and compare those who needed readmission versus those who did not. We use logistic regression to explore factors associated with readmissions. A total of 314 patients were included, of which 20 (6.4%) needed readmission, and none needed ICU admission nor died. At least one comorbidity was present in 29.9% of patients. Hypertension, leukopenia, lymphocytopenia, increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and increased aminotransferases were all associated with a higher risk of readmission. A clinical course of 10 days or longer, and an absolute eosinophil count over 200/µL were associated with a lower risk. After the multivariate analysis, only hypertension (OR 4.99, CI 1.54-16.02), temperature over 38 °C in the emergency ward (OR 9.03, CI 1.89-45.77), leukopenia (OR 4.92, CI 1.42-17.11) and increased LDH (OR 6.62, CI 2.82-19.26) remained significantly associated with readmission. Outpatient management of patients with low-risk COVID-19 pneumonia is safe, if adequately selected.

However, a deficient comprehensive study of factors able to affect managerial communication limit further progress in the improvement of such business interactions. The research fills in the knowledge gap about the comparative influence of various factors on managerial communication and particularly the impact of individual and organizational characteristics of managers on communication. The paper aims to determine the significance of the relationships between managerial communication and age, genders, managerial levels, and industries in private companies from the energy, education, trade, service, extraction, construction, and production sectors. Within the organizational study, 224 subordinates from Kazakhstan firms reflected on their supervisors’ communications through a multivariate closed questionnaire. The obtained data was further processed and examined through correlation coefficients and dispersion analysis. The research results identified the considerable relationship between communication practices and managers’ age (R2=0.9637), managerial level (R2=0.9640), and industry (R2=0.9653). The study reveals the weak relationship between manager’s gender and communication practices (R2=0.1535): women insignificantly outperform men in this linking process. The research postulates that effectiveness of managerial communication considerably varies by managers’ age, managerial level, and industry, and insignificantly by gender.

There is no antiviral for many viruses including Dengue, Chikungunya and Japanese encephalitis. Many of these neglected viruses are increasingly becoming global pathogens. Lack of broad spectrum of action and the rapid rise of resistance and cross-resistance to existing antiviral have further increased the challenge of antiviral development. Sulfonamide, as a privileged scaffold, has been capitalized to develop several bioactive compounds and drugs. Accordingly, several reviews have been published in recent times on bioactive sulfonamides. However, there are not enough review reports of antiviral sulfonamides in the last five years. Sul fonamides scaffolds have received sufficient attention for the development of non-nucleoside antivirals following the emergence of cross-resistance to nucleoside inhibitors. Hybridization of bioactive pharmacophores with sulfonamides has been used as a strategy to develop sulfonamide antivirals. This review is an effort to analyze these attempts and evaluate their translational potential. Parameters including potency (IC 50), toxicity (CC 50) and selectivity (CC 50/IC 50) have been used in this report to suggest the potential of sulfonamide derivatives to progress further as antiviral.

We conducted a single-center observational study with the aim of analyzing the coagulation patterns of intensive care unit (ICU) COVID-19 patients with both standard laboratory and viscoelastic tests. The presence of coagulopathy at the onset of the infection and after seven days of systemic anticoagulant therapy was investigated. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty consecutive SARS-CoV-2 patients, admitted to the ICU of a University hospital in Italy between 29th February and 30th March 2020 were enrolled in the study, providing they fulfilled the acute respiratory distress syndrome criteria. They received full-dose anticoagulation, including Enoxaparin 0.5 mg·kg-1 subcutaneously twice a day, unfractionated Heparin 7500 units subcutaneously three times daily, or low-intensity Heparin infusion. Thromboelastographic (TEG) and laboratory parameters were measured at admission and after seven days. RESULTS: At baseline, patients showed elevated fibrinogen activity [rTEG-Ang 80.5° (78.7 to 81.5); TEG-ACT 78.5 sec (69.2 to 87.9)] and an increase in the maximum amplitude of clot strength [FF-MA 42.2 mm (30.9 to 49.2)]. No alterations in time of the enzymatic phase of coagulation [CKH-K and CKH-R, 1.1 min (0.85 to 1.3) and 6.6 min (5.2 to 7.5), respectively] were observed. Absent lysis of the clot at 30 minutes (LY30) was observed in all the studied population. Standard coagulation parameters were within the physiological range: [INR 1.09 (1.01 to 1.20), aPTT 34.5 sec (29.7 to 42.2), antithrombin 97.5% (89.5 to 115)]. However, plasma fibrinogen [512.5 mg·dl-1 (303.5 to 605)], and D-dimer levels [1752.5 ng·ml-1 (698.5 to 4434.5)], were persistently increased above the reference range. After seven days of full-dose anticoagulation, average TEG parameters were not different from baseline (rTEG-Ang p = 0.13, TEG-ACT p = 0.58, FF-MA p = 0.24, CK-R p = 0.19, CKH-R p = 0.35), and a persistent increase in white blood cell count, platelet count and D-dimer was observed (white blood cell count p < 0.01, neutrophil count p = 0.02, lymphocyte count p < 0.01, platelet count p = 0.13 < 0.01, D-dimer levels p= 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome show elevated fibrinogen activity, high D-dimer levels and maximum amplitude of clot strength. Platelet count, fibrinogen, and standard coagulation tests do not indicate a disseminated intravascular coagulation. At seven days, thromboelastographic abnormalities persist despite full-dose anticoagulation.","Bocci, M G; Maviglia, R; Consalvo, L M; Grieco, D L; Montini, L; Mercurio, G; Nardi, G; Pisapia, L; Cutuli, S L; Biasucci, D G; Gori, C; Rosenkranz, R; De Candia, E; Carelli, S; Natalini, D; Antonelli, M; Franceschi, F",Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,,878

Individualized blood glucose target goals and treatment strategies should be made according to specific circumstances of COVID-19 inpatients with diabetes. For mild patients, a strict glycemic control target (fasting plasma glucose (FPG) 4.4-6.1 mmol/L, 2-hour postprandial plasma glucose (2 h PG) 6.1-7.8 mmol/L) are recommended; a target for the glycemic control of common type patients (FPG 6.1-7.8 mmol/L, 2 h PG 7.8-10.0 mmol/L) and subcutaneous insulin deliver therapy are recommended; a target nonfasting blood glucose range of 10.0 mmol or less per liter for severe-type COVID-19 patients, a relatively Less stringent blood glucose control target (FPG 7.8-10.0 mmol/L, 2 h PG 7.8-13.9 mmol/L) for critically ill patients and intravenous insulin infusion therapy are recommended. Due to the rapid changes in the condition of some patients, the risk of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) or hyperglycemic hyperosmolar status (HHS) maybe occur during the treatment. Blood glucose monitoring, dynamic evaluation and timely adjustment of strategies should be strengthened to ensure patient safety and promote early recovery of patients.","Ma, Wan-Xia; Ran, Xing-Wu",Sichuan Da Xue Xue Bao Yi Xue Ban,,878

384339,[Application of laboratory diagnostic technologies for SARS-CoV-2: current progress and prospect],2020,"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak is evolving rapidly worldwide. However, little is known about the association between pregnant women with COVID-19 and the risk of adverse birth outcomes. METHOD: We conducted a retrospective cohort study based on the Maternal and Child Health Information System (MCHIMS) of Wuhan, China. All pregnant women with singleton live birth recorded by the system between January 13 and March 18, 2020, were included. The adverse birth outcomes were preterm birth, low birth weight, neonatal asphyxia, premature rupture of membrane (PROM), and cesarean section delivery. Multivariate logistic regression was used to evaluate the associations between maternal COVID-19 diagnosis and adverse birth outcomes. RESULTS: Out of 11,078 pregnant women, 65 were confirmed with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). No deaths occurred from these confirmed cases or their newborns. Compared to pregnant women without COVID-19, pregnant women with a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis had an increased risk of preterm birth (OR 3.34, 95% CI 1.60-7.00) and cesarean section (OR 3.63, 95% CI 1.95-6.76). There was no statistical difference in low birth weight, neonatal asphyxia, and PROM between the mothers with and without COVID-19. Among these newborns that were born to mothers with confirmed COVID-19, none was tested severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) positive or had abnormal CT results. Only one had diarrhea and three had a fever. CONCLUSIONS: This population-based cohort study suggests that COVID-19 during the later pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of adverse birth outcomes, including iatrogenic preterm birth and cesarean section delivery. Our data provide little evidence for maternal-fetal vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2. It is important to monitor the long-term health effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on pregnant women and their children.","Yang, Rong; Mei, Hui; Zheng, Tongzhang; Fu, Qiang; Zhang, Yiming; Buka, Stephen; Yao, Xinan; Tang, Zezhong; Zhang, Xichi; Qiu, Lin; Zhang, Yaqi; Zhou, Jieqiong; Cao, Jiangxia; Wang, Youjie; Zhou, Aifen",BMC Med,,878

So, far, millions of people are infected with the virus across the length and breadth of the world with thousand losing their lives each passing day. The WHO in February 2020 classified the virus as a coronavirus and the name Coronavirus-19 (CoV-19) was offered to the virus. The disease caused by the virus was termed coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19). The pathogenesis of COVID-19 is associated with elevation of several immune plays as well as inflammatory factors which contributes to cytokine storms. Currently, the detection of CoV-19 RNA is through reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are capable of suppressing several kinds of cytokines via the paracrine secretion system. Therefore, MSCs therapy could be game charges in the treatment of the current COVID-19 pandemic. Also, intravenous IG may be capable of suppressing the high expression of IL-6 by the CoV-19 resulting in lessen disease burden. Anti-inflammatory medications like, corticosteroids, tocilizumab, glycyrrhetinic acid, as well as etoposide may be very advantageous in decreasing the COVID-19 burden because, their mode of action targets the cytokine storms initiated by the CoV-19. It is important to indicate that, these medication does not target the virus itself. Therefore, potent CoV-19 anti-viral medications are needed to completely cure patients with COVID-19. Also, a vaccine is urgently needed to stop the spread of the virus. This review therefore elucidates the immune players in the management of COVID-19; focusing principally on MSCs and inflammatory mediators.","Richard, Seidu A; Kampo, Sylvanus; Sackey, Marian; Hechavarria, Maite Esquijarosa; Buunaaim, Alexis D B; Kuugbee, Eugene Dogkotenge; Anabah, Thomas Winsum",Curr Stem Cell Res Ther,,878

Methods: PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, ClinicalTrials.gov, and medRxiv databases were searched using a search strategy tailored to each database. The Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) and Strengthening the reporting of observational studies in epidemiology (STROBE) checklists were used for the studies' qualitative assessment. The outcomes studied were mortality, all adverse events, serious adverse events, and clinical improvement. The quantitative synthesis was conducted using fixed and random effects models in the CMA 2.2. Heterogeneity was tested using the I-squared (I-2) measure. Results: In general, six studies, including five randomized controlled trials and one cohort study were found eligible. Comparison of the findings related to both groups receiving remdesivir (10-day remdesivir group) and placebo/control group showed that remdesivir treatment had no significant effect on mortality at day 14 of the treatment (RR=0.769;95% CI: 0.563-1.050;p=0.098), and all adverse events (RR= 1.078;95% CI: 0.908-1.279;p= 0.392). However, remdesivir had a significant effect on clinical improvement at day 14 compared to placebo/control (OR= 1.447;95% CI: 1.005-2.085;p= 0.047) and reduced serious adverse events (RR= 0.736;95% CI: 0.611-0.887;p= 0.001). Conclusion: Remdesivir has positive effects on clinical improvement, and reduction of the risk of serious adverse events.

Subjects and Methods: Data on confirmed cases and number of deaths due to coronavirus infection were retrieved from the WHO as on 30 March 2020, and examined for the various income level countries, per the World Bank criteria. The CFR was calculated country-wise and estimated for the various groups such as low, lower-middle, upper-middle, and high-income, and the data was analyzed. Results: The overall CFR for the high income countries was 5.0%, compared with a CFR of 2.8% for low-income countries. The upper-middle-income countries showed a CFR of 4.3%, while the lower-middle-income countries stood at 3.7%. The results from our study predict that the maximum CFR in high-income countries will be contained at approximately 5% (95% CI). The CFR for the low, lower-middle, and upper-middle-income countries will range between 2.8 and 4.3% (95% CI). Conclusion: COVID-19, irrespective of its transmissibility, produces a lower CFR compared with that of SARS-Cov and MERS-Cov, although COVID-19 has infected eight times more countries than MERS-Cov and SARS-Cov, and caused a higher number of deaths.

This research determined the psychometric properties of the ""Strategies for Parental Involvement during Emergency Remote Teaching - Scale (SPIERT-S). The tool assesses the strategies used by teachers to facilitate parental involvement during ERT. Through a thorough literature review, 22 items about home and school collaboration and ERT were initially developed. Evidence related to content validity was established through two-round expert consultation, while data related to construct validity were gathered through factor analyses. The content validity analysis resulted in the deletion of four (4) items;hence, 18 items were retained. A three-factor structure was yielded from Exploratory Factor Analysis (parents as facilitators of learning, parents as sources of information, and parents as collaborators), and a total of 15 items were retained. The confirmatory factor analysis indicated an acceptable level of the goodness-of-fit indices measured. The internal consistency of the factors and the whole scale showed excellent reliability. The results suggest that the SPIERT-S has good, valid, and reliable psychometric qualities and can be used to examine the strategies for parental involvement that teachers utilize during emergency remote teaching.

This short communication demonstrates how the mutation frequency patterns are evolving in 2457 SAR-CoV-2 strains isolated from COVID-19 patients across diverse Indian states. We have identified 19 such variants showing contrasting mutational probabilities in the span of 7 months. Out of these, 14 variants are showing increasing mutational probabilities suggesting their propagation with time due to their unexplored evolutionary advantages. However, the mutational probabilities of five variants have significantly decreased in June onward as compared to March/April, suggesting their termination with time.

Women with normal body mass index (N = 11,797) and with obesity (N = 2991) were compared. The contribution of each Robson group to the overall caesarean rate were compared. RESULTS: The overall cesarean rate was higher for women with (28.1%) than without (14.2%, p < 0.001) obesity. This result came mainly from Robson group 5a (history of one cesarean). After adjustment for medical factors within this group, the association between maternal obesity and cesarean during labor was significant. CONCLUSIONS: The higher cesarean rate in women with obesity is explained by Robson group 5a in which obesity is an independent risk factor of in labor cesarean delivery.","Crequit, Simon; Korb, Diane; Morin, Cécile; Schmitz, Thomas; Sibony, Olivier",BMC Pregnancy Childbirth,,878

This suggests that the shunt associated to the gasless lung parenchyma is not sufficient to explain CARDS hypoxemia. We designed an algorithm (VentriQlar), based on the same conceptual grounds described by J.B West in 1969. We set 499 ventilation-perfusion (VA/Q) compartments and, after calculating their blood composition (PO2, PCO2 and pH), we randomly chose 106 combinations of five parameters controlling a bimodal distribution of blood flow. The solutions were accepted if the predicted PaO2 and PaCO2 were within 10% of the patient's values. We assumed that shunt fraction equaled the fraction of non-aerated lung tissue at the CT quantitative analysis. Five critically-ill patients later deceased were studied. The PaO2/FiO2 was 91.1±18.6 mmHg and PaCO2 69.0±16.1 mmHg. Cardiac output was 9.58±0.99 l/min. The fraction of non-aerated tissue was 0.33±0.06. The model showed that a large fraction of the blood flow was likely distributed in regions with very low VA/Q (Qmean=0.06±0.02) and a smaller fraction in regions with moderately high VA/Q. Overall LogSD, Q was 1.66 ± 0.14, suggestive of high VA/Q inequality. Data suggest that shunt alone cannot completely account for the observed hypoxemia and a significant VA/Q inequality must be present in COVID-19. The high cardiac output and the extensive microthrombosis later found in the autopsy further support the hypothesis of a pathological perfusion of non/poorly ventilated lung tissue.","Busana, Mattia; Giosa, Lorenzo; Cressoni, Massimo; Gasperetti, Alessio; Di Girolamo, Luca; Martinelli, Alessandra; Sonzogni, Aurelio; Lorini, Luca; Palumbo, Maria Michela; Romitti, Federica; Gattarello, Simone; Steinberg, Irene; Herrmann, Peter; Meissner, Konrad; Quintel, Michael; Gattinoni, Luciano",,,878

443672,[Diagnosis and treatment recommendation for pediatric coronavirus disease-19],2020,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Severe acute COVID-19 has taken on pandemic proportions with growing interest in identification of prognostic factors for mortality. Standardized bioelectrical impedance (BI) phase angle (SPhA), which is PhA adjusted by age and sex, has been related to mortality in patients with several diseases but never investigated in COVID-19. Inflammation, a consequence of COVID-19 infection, affects fluid status (hydration) and can be identified with PhA. The aim of this study was to determine the predictive role of PhA on 90 days survival of adults with COVID-19. METHODS: We studied 127 consecutive patients diagnosed with COVID-19. BI measurements determined with a 50 kHz phase-sensitive BI device, body composition parameters and laboratory markers were evaluated as predictors of mortality. RESULTS: Non-surviving COVID-19 patients had significantly lower PhA and SPhA values (p < 0.001) and increased hydration (p < 0.001) compared to surviving patients. Patients in the lowest SPhA quartile had increased (p < 0.001) mortality and hospital stay, hyperhydration (p < 0.001), increased inflammation biomarkers [CRP (p < 0.001)], decreased nutritional parameters: body mass cell index [BCMI (p < 0.001) albumin (p < 0.001)], and reduced other biomarkers [D-dimer (p = 0.002)]. Multivariate analysis (Cox regression) revealed that PhA and hydration status, adjusted for age, sex, BMI, diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidaemia or heart disease, were associated (p < 0.001) with increased mortality. The hazard ratio was 2.48 (95% CI, 1.60-3.84, p < 0.001) for PhA and 1.12 (95% CI, 1.04-1.20, p = 0.003) for hydration percentage. PhA <3.95° was the cut-off for predicting mortality in acute COVID-19 with 93.8% sensitivity and 66.7% specificity. PhA offers greater sensitivity as a predictive prognostic test at admission, compared to the established analytical parameters of poor prognosis (CRP, lymphocytes, prealbumin). CONCLUSIONS: Low PhA (<3.95°), independent of age, sex, BMI, and comorbidities, is a significant predictor of mortality risk in COVID-19. These findings suggest that the evaluation of body composition with single-frequency phase-sensitive BI measurements should be included in the routine clinical assessment of COVID-19 patients at hospital admission to identify patients at increased mortality risk.","Cornejo-Pareja, Isabel; Vegas-Aguilar, Isabel M; García-Almeida, Jose Manuel; Bellido-Guerrero, Diego; Talluri, Antonio; Lukaski, Henry; Tinahones, Francisco J",Clin. nutr.

448193,[Dandelion clock-like sign on CT for diagnose of COVID-19],2020,"COVID-19 is associated with a high incidence of thrombotic complications, which can be explained by the complex and unique interplay between coronaviruses and endothelial cells, the local and systemic inflammatory response, and the coagulation system. Empirically, an intensified dose of thrombosis prophylaxis is being used in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19 and several guidelines on this topic have been published, although the insufficiency of high quality and direct evidence has led to weak recommendations. In this Viewpoint we summarise the pathophysiology of COVID-19 coagulopathy in the context of patients who are ambulant, admitted to hospital, and critically ill or non-critically ill, and those post-discharge from hospital. We also review data from randomised controlled trials in the past year of antithrombotic therapy in patients who are critically ill. These data provide the first high-quality evidence on optimal use of antithrombotic therapy in patients with COVID-19. Pharmacological thromboprophylaxis is not routinely recommended for patients who are ambulant and post-discharge. A first ever trial in non-critically ill patients who were admitted to hospital has shown that a therapeutic dose of low-molecular-weight heparin might improve clinical outcomes in this population. In critically ill patients, this same treatment does not improve outcomes and prophylactic dose anticoagulant thromboprophylaxis is recommended. In the upcoming months we expect numerous data from the ongoing antithrombotic COVID-19 studies to guide clinicians at different stages of the disease.","Leentjens, Jenneke; van Haaps, Thijs F; Wessels, Pieter F; Schutgens, Roger E G; Middeldorp, Saskia",Lancet Haematol,,878

469655,[Study on the epidemic development of COVID-19 in Hubei province by a modified SEIR model],2020,"La-related proteins (LARPs) share a La motif (LaM) followed by an RNA recognition motif (RRM). Together these are termed the La-module that, in the prototypical nuclear La protein and LARP7, mediates binding to the UUU-3'OH termination motif of nascent RNA polymerase III transcripts. We briefly review La and LARP7 activities for RNA 3' end binding and protection from exonucleases before moving to the more recently uncovered poly(A)-related activities of LARP1 and LARP4. Two features shared by LARP1 and LARP4 are direct binding to poly(A) and to the cytoplasmic poly(A)-binding protein (PABP, also known as PABPC1). LARP1, LARP4 and other proteins involved in mRNA translation, deadenylation, and decay, contain PAM2 motifs with variable affinities for the MLLE domain of PABP. We discuss a model in which these PABP-interacting activities contribute to poly(A) pruning of active mRNPs. Evidence that the SARS-CoV-2 RNA virus targets PABP, LARP1, LARP 4 and LARP 4B to control mRNP activity is also briefly reviewed. Recent data suggests that LARP4 opposes deadenylation by stabilizing PABP on mRNA poly(A) tails. Other data suggest that LARP1 can protect mRNA from deadenylation. This is dependent on a PAM2 motif with unique characteristics present in its La-module. Thus, while nuclear La and LARP7 stabilize small RNAs with 3' oligo(U) from decay, LARP1 and LARP4 bind and protect mRNA 3' poly(A) tails from deadenylases through close contact with PABP.Abbreviations: 5'TOP: 5' terminal oligopyrimidine, LaM: La motif, LARP: La-related protein, LARP1: La-related protein 1, MLLE: mademoiselle, NTR: N-terminal region, PABP: cytoplasmic poly(A)-binding protein (PABPC1), Pol III: RNA polymerase III, PAM2: PABP-interacting motif 2, PB: processing body, RRM: RNA recognition motif, SG: stress granule.","Mattijssen, Sandy; Kozlov, Guennadi; Fonseca, Bruno D; Gehring, Kalle; Maraia, Richard J",RNA Biol,,878
472264,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection in renal transplant recipients: A case report,2020,"Given the scarcity of safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines, a chief policy question is how to allocate them among different sociodemographic groups. This paper evaluates COVID-19 vaccine prioritization strategies proposed to date, focusing on their stated goals; the mechanisms through which the selected allocations affect the course and burden of the pandemic; and the main epidemiological, economic, logistical, and political issues that arise when setting the prioritization strategy. The paper uses a simple, age-stratified susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered model to quantitatively assess the performance of alternative prioritization strategies with respect to avoided deaths, avoided infections, and life-years gained. We demonstrate that prioritizing essential workers is a viable strategy for reducing the number of cases and years of life lost, while the largest reduction in deaths is achieved by prioritizing older adults in most scenarios, even if the vaccine is effective at blocking viral transmission. Uncertainty regarding this property and potential delays in dose delivery reinforce the call for prioritizing older adults. Additionally, we investigate the strength of the equity motive that would support an allocation strategy attaching absolute priority to essential workers for a vaccine that reduces infection-fatality risk.","Ferranna, Maddalena; Cadarette, Daniel; Bloom, David E",,,878

Methods: 81 patients with COVID-19 were prospectively enrolled and followed until discharge. CT scores were quantified on a basis of a CT scoring system where each lung was divided into 3 zones: upper (above the carina), middle, and lower (below the inferior pulmonary vein) zones; each zone was evaluated for percentage of lung involvement on a scale of 0-4 (0, 0%; 1, 0-24%; 2, 25% - 49%; 3, 50% -74%; 4, >74%).Temporal trends of CT scores and the laboratory parameters characteristic of COVID-19 were analyzed. Correlations between the two were determined at three milestones (initial presentation, worst CT manifestation, and recovery finding before discharge). Their correlations with duration to worst CT manifestation and discharge from symptom onset were evaluated. Results: CT scores peaked during illness days 6-11 (median: 5), and stayed steady. C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase increased, peaked on illness days 6-8 and 8-11 (mean: 23.5 mg/L, 259.9 U/L), and gradually declined. Continual decrease and increase were observed in hemoglobin and lymphocyte count, respectively. Albumin reduced and remained at low levels with a nadir on illness days 12-15 (36.6 g/L). Both initial (r = 0.58, 0.64, p < 0.05) and worst CT scores (r = 0.47, 0.65, p < 0.05) were correlated with C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase; and CT scores before discharge, only with albumin (r = -0.41, p < 0.05). Duration to worst CT manifestation was associated with initial and worst CT scores (r = 0.33, 0.29, p < 0.05). No parameters were related to timespan to discharge. Conclusion: Our results illustrated the temporal changes of characteristic clinical measures and extent of CT lung abnormalities in COVID-19. CT scores correlated with some important laboratory parameters, and might serve as prognostic factors.","Zhou, Min; Dong, Chengjun; Li, Chungao; Wang, Yuhui; Liao, Huijun; Shi, Heshui; Lin, Alexander Peter; Wang, Jing; Hu, Yue; Zheng, Chuansheng",Int J Med Sci,,878

507136,[Management of a colon cancer patient complicated with COVID-19],2020,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) elicits an interferon (IFN) deficiency state, which aggravates the type I interferon deficiency and slow IFN responses, which associate with e.g. aging and obesity. Additionally, SARS-CoV-2 may also elicit a cytokine storm, which accounts for disease progression and ultimately the urgent need of ventilator support. Based upon several reports, it has been argued that early treatment with IFN-alpha2 or IFN-beta, preferentially in the early disease stage, may prohibit disease progression. Similarly, preliminary studies have shown that JAK1/2 inhibitor treatment with ruxolitinib or baricitinib may decrease mortality by dampening the deadly cytokine storm, which - in addition to the virus itself - also contributes to multi-organ thrombosis and multi-organ failure. Herein, we describe the rationale for treatment with IFNs (alpha2 or beta) and ruxolitinib emphasizing the urgent need to explore these agents in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 - both as monotherapies and in combination. In this context, we take advantage of several safety and efficacy studies in patients with the chronic myeloproliferative blood cancers (essential thrombocythemia, polycythemia vera and myelofibrosis) (MPNs), in whom IFN-alpha2 and ruxolitinib have been used successfully for the last 10 (ruxolitinib) to 30 years (IFN) as monotherapies and most recently in combination as well. In the context of these agents being highly immunomodulating (IFN boosting immune cells and JAK1/2 inhibitors being highly immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory), we also discuss if statins and hydroxyurea, both agents possessing anti-inflammatory, antithrombotic and anviral potentials, might be inexpensive agents to be repurposed in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2.","Hasselbalch, H C; Skov, V; Kjær, L; Ellervik, C; Poulsen, A; Poulsen, T D; Nielsen, C H",Cytokine Growth Factor Rev,,878

AIM: To analyse the outcome of mask fit-testing across National Health Service (NHS) hospitals in the UK during the first wave of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. METHODS: Using the Freedom of Information Act, 137 NHS hospitals were approached on May 26th, 2020 by an independent researcher to provide data on the outcome of fit-testing at each site. FINDINGS: Ninety-six hospitals responded to the request between May 26th, 2020 to October 29th, 2020. There was a total of 86 mask types used across 56 hospitals, 13 of which were used in at least 10% of these hospitals; the most frequently used was the FFP3M1863, used by 92.86% of hospitals. Overall fit-testing pass rates were provided by 32 hospitals with mean pass rate of 80.74%.

Two weeks before, he noticed odynophagia and fever of 39ºC without cough. He associated significant asthenia with headache, myalgia, nausea, and vomiting and he was treated with levofloxacin 500mg qd for 7 days. One week after, during an initial improvement of the respiratory symptoms, he presented acute right facial weakness. He was diagnosed with right peripheral facial palsy and was treated with prednisone 60 mg/24h with a tapering schedule.","Cabrera Muras, Antonio; Carmona-Abellán, María Del Mar; Collía Fernández, Alejandra; Uterga Valiente, Juan María; Antón Méndez, Lander; García-Moncó, Juan Carlos",Eur. j. neurol,,878
516137,Effect of glutamine metabolism on chemoresistance and its mechanism in tumors,2021,"CONTEXT.­: We previously examined pituitary adenomas with immunohistochemical (IHC) stains for steroidogenic factor 1, Pit-1, anterior pituitary hormones, cytokeratin CAM 5.2, and the &#945;-subunit of human chorionic gonadotropin and found that a screening panel comprising stains for steroidogenic factor 1, Pit-1, and adrenocorticotropic hormone successfully classified most cases and reduced the overall number of stains required. OBJECTIVES.­: To examine the potential role of IHC stain for T-box transcription factor (Tpit) in the classification of our series of pituitary adenomas and to update our screening panel as necessary. DESIGN.­: We collected 157 pituitary adenomas from 2 institutions and included these in tissue microarrays. Immunostains for Tpit were scored in a blinded fashion using the Allred system. Adenomas were assigned to a gold standard class based on IHC pattern followed by application of available clinical and serologic information. Test characteristics were calculated. Correlation analyses, cluster analyses, and classification tree analyses were used to see whether IHC staining patterns reliably reflected adenoma class. RESULTS.­: Of the cases collected, 147 (93.6%) had sufficient material for Tpit analysis. IHC stain for Tpit identified 8 null cell adenomas (all nonfunctioning clinically) as silent corticotrophs; Tpit stains showed better sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value than IHC for adrenocorticotropic hormone and cytokeratin CAM 5.2. Correlation analyses continued to show the expected relationships among IHC stains. Cluster analyses showed grouping of adenomas into clinically consistent groups. Classification tree analysis underscored the central role of transcription factor IHC stains, including Tpit, in adenoma classification. CONCLUSIONS.­: Substitution of Tpit stain for the adrenocorticotropic hormone stain improves our prior algorithm by reducing the number of false-negatives and false-positives. As a result, fewer adenomas are classified as null cell adenoma, and more adenomas are classified as silent corticotroph adenoma.","McDonald, William C; McDonald, Kelsey N; Helmer, Jordan A; Ho, Bridget; Wang, Amber; Banerji, Nilanjana",Arch. pathol. lab. med.

671587,Dog Walking before and during the COVID-19 Pandemic Lockdown: Experiences of UK Dog Owners,2021-06-10,"Global programs targeting 5 preventive chemotherapy neglected tropical diseases (PC-NTDs) have scaled up rapidly in recent decades due, in large part, to the generous drug donations from 6 pharmaceutical companies—Eisai; Johnson & Johnson (J&J); GlaxoSmithKline (GSK); Merck & Co., Inc., Kenilworth, New Jersey, United States of America (MSD); Merck KgaA; and Pfizer. Today, the scale of the PC-NTD drug donation programs is staggering. Nearly 15 billion tablets have been manufactured, packaged, shipped, and distributed in order to reach the people in need. The supply chains established to support such massive operations are enormously complex. Here, we describe a unique public–private partnership that was formed to bring together supply chain expertise to overcome the critical challenges associated with such large-scale production and delivery of donated pharmaceutical products.","Souza, Ashley A.; Holloway, Cassandra; Williams, Tijana",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0008818; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33152744/,878
