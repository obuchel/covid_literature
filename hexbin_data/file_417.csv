3269,3269,3269,Accuracy of MRI diagnosis of early osteonecrosis of the femoral head: a meta-analysis and systematic review,17.685833,9.105186,2018-07-04,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the overall diagnostic value related to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in patients with early osteonecrosis of the femoral head. METHODS: By searching multiple databases and sources, including PubMed, Cochrane, and Embase database, by the index words updated in December 2017, qualified studies were identified and relevant literature sources were also searched. The qualified studies included prospective cohort studies and cross-sectional studies. Heterogeneity of the included studies were reviewed to select proper effect model for pooled weighted sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic odds ratio (DOR). Summary receiver operating characteristic (SROC) analyses were performed for meniscal tears. RESULTS: Forty-three studies related to diagnostic accuracy of MRI to detect early osteonecrosis of the femoral head were involved in the meta-analysis. The global sensitivity and specificity of MRI in early osteonecrosis of the femoral head were 93.0% (95% CI 92.0–94.0%) and 91.0% (95% CI 89.0%–93.0%), respectively. The global positive likelihood ratio and global negative likelihood ratio of MRI in early osteonecrosis of the femoral head were 2.74 (95% CI 1.98–3.79) and 0.18 (95% CI 0.14–0.23), respectively. The global DOR was 27.27 (95% CI 17.02–43.67), and the area under the SROC was 93.38% (95% CI 90.87%–95.89%). CONCLUSIONS: This review provides a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of MRI in early osteonecrosis of the femoral head. Moderate to strong evidence indicated that MRI appears to be significantly associated with higher diagnostic accuracy for early osteonecrosis of the femoral head.","Zhang, Ya-Zhou; Cao, Xu-Yang; Li, Xi-Cheng; Chen, Jia; Zhao, Yue-Yuan; Tian, Zhi; Zheng, Wang",J Orthop Surg Res,417,27

We collected and analyzed 35,151 death records from Arizona for 1915–1921 and 21,334 birth records from Maricopa county for 1915–1925. We estimated the number of excess deaths and births before, during, and after the pandemic period, and we found a significant decline in the number of births occurring 9–11 months after peak pandemic mortality. Moreover, excess mortality rates were highest in northern Arizona counties, where Native Americans were historically concentrated, suggesting a link between ethnic and/or sociodemographic factors and risk of pandemic-related death. The relationship between birth patterns and pandemic mortality risk should be further studied at different spatial scales and in different ethnic groups.","Dahal, Sushma; Mizumoto, Kenji; Bolin, Bob; Viboud, Cécile; Chowell, Gerardo",Am J Epidemiol,417,22

The low yields of cell-based manufacturing systems using egg-derived CVVs remain an unsolved issue. This study aimed to develop high-growth cell-derived CVVs for MDCK cell-based vaccine manufacturing platforms. METHODS: Four H7N9 CVVs were generated in characterized Vero and adherent MDCK (aMDCK) cells. Furthermore, reassortant viruses were amplified in adherent MDCK (aMDCK) cells with certification, and their growth characteristics were detected in aMDCK cells and new suspension MDCK (sMDCK) cells. Finally, the plaque-forming ability, biosafety, and immunogenicity of H7N9 reassortant viruses were evaluated. RESULTS: The HA titers of these CVVs produced in proprietary suspension MDCK (sMDCK) cells and chicken embryos were 2- to 8-fold higher than those in aMDCK cells. All H7N9 CVVs showed attenuated characteristics by trypsin-dependent plaque assay and chicken embryo lethality test. The alum-adjuvanted NHRI-RG5 (derived from the fifth wave H7N9 virus A/Guangdong/SP440/2017) vaccine had the highest immunogenicity and cross-reactivity among the four H7N9 CVVs. Finally, we found that AddaVax adjuvant improved the cross-reactivity of low pathogenic H7N9 virus against highly pathogenic H7N9 viruses. CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicates that cell-derived H7N9 CVVs possessed high growth rate in new sMDCK cells and low pathogenicity in chicken embryo, and that CVVs generated by this platform are also suitable for both cell- and egg-based prepandemic vaccine production.","Tzeng, Tsai-Teng; Chen, Po-Ling; Weng, Tsai-Chuan; Tsai, Shin-Yi; Lai, Chia-Chun; Chou, Hsin-I; Chen, Pin-Wen; Lu, Chia-Chun; Liu, Ming-Tsan; Sung, Wang-Chou; Lee, Min-Shi; Hu, Alan Yung-Chih",J Biomed Sci,417,1

But the rapid biodegradation of the materials may interrupt neural tissue reconstruction in vivo. To improve the stability of the materials, the materials produced by NECM and chitosan hydrogels were crosslinked by genipine, glutaraldehyde or ultraviolet ray. Physicochemical property, degradation and biocompatibility of materials crosslinked by genipin, glutaraldehyde or ultraviolet ray were evaluated. The scaffold crosslinked by genipin possessed a porous structure, and the porosity ratio was 89.07 + 4.90%, the average diameter of pore was 85.32 + 5.34 μm. The crosslinked degree of the scaffold crosslinked by genipin and glutaraldehyde was 75.13 ± 4.87%, 71.25 ± 5.06% respectively; Uncrosslinked scaffold disintegrated when immerged in distilled water while the scaffold crosslinked by genipin and glutaraldehyde group retained their integrity. The scaffold crosslinked by genipin has better water absorption, water retention and anti-enzymatic hydrolysis ability than the other three groups. Cell cytotoxicity showed that the cytotoxicity of scaffold crosslinked by genipin was lower than that crosslinked by glutaraldehyde. The histocompatibility of scaffold crosslinked by genipin was also better than glutaraldehyde group. More cells grew well in the scaffold crosslinked by genipin when co-cultured with L929 cells. The decellularized nerve extracellular matrix/chitosan scaffold crosslinked by the genipin has good mechanical properties, micro structure and biocompatibility, which is an ideal scaffold for the spinal cord tissue engineering.","Zhang, Fangsong; Zhang, Naili; Xu, Qing; Zhang, Luping; Zhang, Chunlei; Liu, Hongfu; Yu, Zhenhai; Zhou, Shuai; Feng, Guoying; Huang, Fei",Cell Tissue Bank,417,1

Multiple treatment modalities are needed not only for a prevention of cardiac arrest and quick hemostasis against multiple injuries, but also for recovery of oxygenation to save the patient’s life. CASE PRESENTATION: A 48-year-old Japanese woman fell down stairs that had a height of approximately 4 m. An X-ray showed pneumothorax, pulmonary contusion in her right lung, and an unstable pelvic fracture. A chest drain was inserted and preperitoneal pelvic packing was performed to control bleeding, performing resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta. A computed tomography scan revealed massive lung contusion in the lower lobe of her right lung, pelvic fractures, and multiple fractures and hematoma in other areas. An emergency thoracotomy was performed, and then we performed wide wedge resection of the injured lung, clamping proximal to suture lines with two Satinsky blood vessel clamps. The vessel clamps were left in the right thoracic cavity. The other hemorrhagic areas were embolized by transcatheter arterial embolization. However, since her respiratory functions deteriorated in the intensive care unit, veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was used for lung assist. Planned reoperation under veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was performed on day 2. Since her respiratory condition improved gradually, the veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation circuit was withdrawn on day 7. She was transferred to the psychiatric ward of our hospital on day 75. CONCLUSION: Utilizing multiple treatment modalities such as resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta, damage control surgery, transcatheter arterial embolization, and veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation with appropriate timing saves a patient with severe polytrauma with massive pulmonary contusion including intrapulmonary hemorrhage.","Nagashima, Futoshi; Inoue, Satoshi; Ohta, Miho",J Med Case Rep,417,24

The activity and effectiveness of these DAAs are affected by the presence of resistance associated substitutions (RASs). This study aimed to characterize HCV genotypes circulating among Egyptian HCV patients, to dissect the full sequences of HCV NS3-4A and NS5B regions, and to characterize RASs associated with NS3-4A and NS5B inhibitors in HCV treatment-naïve patients. Genotyping of 80 HCV samples from treatment-naïve patients was done using restriction fragment length polymorphism and phylogenetic analysis based on some full NS5B sequences. Results showed the prevalence of HCV subtype 4a. Twenty four new full sequences of NS3-4A and NS5B regions of subtype 4a were deposited in the GenBank database. In general, the substitutions associated with NS3-4A-targeting drugs were absent predicting possible responsiveness of Egyptian HCV patients to these drugs. In addition, the absence of amino acid substitutions associated with resistance to Sofosbuvir may predict good response to treatment with Sofosbuvir. Some amino acid substitutions associated with resistance to different classes of non-nucleoside inhibitors were detected. Further investigations on treated Egyptian HCV patients may evaluate the effectiveness of the massively used drugs. Many predicted T-cell-binding epitopes in NS3-4A and NS5B regions were found to be highly conserved in the currently studied isolates; a finding that might be important for HCV vaccine development. We demonstrated potential NS3 epitopes that could be used in engineering T cells against HCV epitopes.

Remarkable interest has been given to ECG signals analysis for AF detection in an early stage. In this context, we propose an artificial neural network ANN application to classify ECG signals into three classes, the first presents Normal Sinus Rhythm NSR, the second depicts abnormal signal with Atrial Fibrillation (AF) and the third shows noisy ECG signals. Accordingly, we achieve 93.1% accuracy classification results, 95.1% of sensitivity, 90.5% of specificity and 98%. Furthermore, we yield a value of zero error and a low value of cross entropy, which prove the robustness of the proposed ANN model architecture. Thus, we outperform the state of the art by achieving high accuracy classification without pre-processing step and without high level of feature extraction, and then we enable clinicians to determine automatically the class of each patient ECG signal.","Khriji, Lazhar; Fradi, Marwa; Machhout, Mohsen; Hossen, Abdulnasir",The Impact of Digital Technologies on Public Health in Developed and Developing Countries,417,24

This study was conducted to compare the efficacy of manual hyperinflation in supine versus lateral decubitus position on arterial blood gases (ABG) in patients with VAP. Forty-two patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia with age range from 40 to 60 years were selected. They were randomly divided into two equal groups: group A who received manual hyperinflation from supine position and group B who received manual hyperinflation from lateral decubitus position (upper most affected). Both groups received respiratory physiotherapy. The patients received 2 sessions per day for 6 days. Outcome measures were arterial blood gases (PaO(2), PaCO(2), PaO(2)/FiO(2), and SaO(2)). They were assessed before the 1st morning session (pre), at day 3 (post 1), and at day 6 (post 2). RESULTS: After sessions, significant changes of measured variables (PaO(2), PaCO(2), PaO(2)/FiO(2), and SaO(2)) were obtained in both groups (P < 0.05, in all variables) and by comparison between groups post-intervention; a significant difference was observed between both groups in measures of oxygenation in favor of group B (P < 0.05), whereas there was a non-significant difference in the PaC02 between both groups (post 1 P = 0.52 and post 2 P = 0.33). CONCLUSION: It was concluded that effect of the bag squeezing on arterial blood gases in patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia from lateral decubitus position was more effective than from supine position.

In addition, it maintains the ploidy level consistency in eukaryotic cells, hence, mutations or alteration of this protein could result in the disintegration of the fine-tuned molecular machinery that can lead to uncontrolled cell proliferation. Moreover, MCM2 has been found to be an important marker for progression and prognosis in different cancers. Therefore, we aimed to analyze the MCM2 expression and the associated outcome in breast cancer (BC) patients based on the publicly available online databases. In this study, server-based gene expression analyses indicate the upregulation of MCM2 (p < 10(−6); fold change>2.0) in various BC subtypes as compared to the respective normal tissues. Besides, the evaluation of histological sections from healthy and cancer tissues showed strong staining signals indicating higher expression of MCM2 protein. The overexpression of MCM2 was significantly correlated to promoter methylation and was related to patients' clinical features. Further, mutation analysis suggested missense as the predominant type of mutation (71.4%) with 18 copy-number alterations and 0.2% mutation frequency in the MCM2 gene. This study revealed a significant correlation (Cox p ≤ 0.05) between the higher MCM2 expression and lower patient survival. Finally, we identified the co-expressed genes with gene ontological features and signaling pathways associated in BC development. We believe that this study will provide a basis for MCM2 to be a significant biomarker for human BC prognosis.","Samad, Abdus; Haque, Farhana; Nain, Zulkar; Alam, Rahat; Al Noman, Md Abdullah; Rahman Molla, Mohammad Habibur; Hossen, Md Saddam; Islam, Md Raquibul; Khan, Md Iqbal; Ahammad, Foysal",Heliyon,417,4

We aimed to examine the incidence of limb amputation among sepsis survivors, and to investigate factors independently associated with limb amputation. METHODS: In this population-based cohort study, data obtained from the South Korean national health insurance service database between 2015 and 2016 were analyzed. A sepsis survivor was defined as someone having survived > 90 days after initiation of treatment for sepsis. RESULTS: Of 19,906 sepsis survivors, 163 (0.8%) had undergone surgical limb amputation. In a multivariable model, male sex (odds ratio [OR] 1.74, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.26–2.40; P = 0.001), dopamine infusion (OR 1.78, 95% CI 1.22–2.60; P = 0.003), epinephrine infusion (OR 2.04, 95% CI 1.30–3.20; P = 0.002), continuous renal replacement therapy (OR 3.34, 95% CI 2.01–3.20; P < 0.001), diabetes mellitus (DM) without chronic complication (OR 1.73, 95% CI 1.19–2.51; P = 0.004), DM with chronic complication (OR 3.49, 95% CI 2.32–5.26; P < 0.001), and peripheral arterial disease (OR 6.79, 95% CO 3.70–12.46; P < 0.001) were associated with a higher incidence of limb amputation among sepsis survivors. CONCLUSIONS: In South Korea, 0.8% of sepsis survivors underwent limb amputation for the treatment of PG.

The synthesis of PSPB-AM-AGE and its grafting on the cotton fabrics were confirmed by FTIR, XPS and SEM. The PSPB-AM-AGE treated cotton fabrics exhibited a high level of antibacterial rate against both Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), which are 95.18% and 98.74%, separately, as well as a good laundry durability. The mechanical tests showed that the essential cotton properties can be largely preserved in the treatment process. Moreover, the hydrophilicity, air and water permeability of the cotton were improved after treated with PSPB-AM-AGE, indicating a better wearing comfort performance. The whiteness of the cotton fabrics did not decrease significantly. The safety evaluation demonstrated that PSPB-AM-AGE had no cytotoxicity.

These logics build on so-called separation algebras, which allow expressing properties of heap regions such that modifications to a region do not invalidate properties stated about the remainder of the heap. This concept is key to enabling modular reasoning and also extends to concurrency. While heaps are naturally related to mathematical graphs, many ubiquitous graph properties are non-local in character, such as reachability between nodes, path lengths, acyclicity and other structural invariants, as well as data invariants which combine with these notions. Reasoning modularly about such graph properties remains notoriously difficult, since a local modification can have side-effects on a global property that cannot be easily confined to a small region. In this paper, we address the question: What separation algebra can be used to avoid proof arguments reverting back to tedious global reasoning in such cases? To this end, we consider a general class of global graph properties expressed as fixpoints of algebraic equations over graphs. We present mathematical foundations for reasoning about this class of properties, imposing minimal requirements on the underlying theory that allow us to define a suitable separation algebra. Building on this theory, we develop a general proof technique for modular reasoning about global graph properties expressed over program heaps, in a way which can be directly integrated with existing separation logics. To demonstrate our approach, we present local proofs for two challenging examples: a priority inheritance protocol and the non-blocking concurrent Harris list.","Krishna, Siddharth; Summers, Alexander J.; Wies, Thomas",Programming Languages and Systems,417,3

HBPC psychologists may work with caregivers to address caregiver stress. Some veterans enrolled in HBPC attend Adult Day Care (ADC) programs, allowing respite for caregivers. At the onset of COVID19 pandemic, ADC centers closed to minimize spread of the virus. The authors identified these caregivers to be at high risk for burnout and sought to develop a protocol to assist these caregivers via telephone and evaluate outcomes. PreCOVID-19 caregiver stress was known via a 4-item Zarit Caregiver Burden annual screening (Bédard et al., 2001). Following ADC closures, caregivers of veterans enrolled in ADC programs were contacted and re-administered the Zarit to determine impact of COVID-19 on caregiver stress. Caregivers of veterans not attending ADC were also contacted for comparison. Contacted caregivers were provided a brief CBT-based intervention via telephone, and post-intervention Zarit screening was administered after two weeks. Ultimately, 4 ADC caregivers and 4 non-ADC caregivers were contacted and provided with services before ADC centers reopened. Statistical analysis via mixed model ANOVA did not yield significant results, likely due to small sample size, although there was a large effect size (η_p^2 =.566). ADC caregivers generally reported increased stress from baseline following ADC closure and reduced stress following provision of intervention. The authors will present caregiver feedback about aspects of telephone intervention that were helpful, and not helpful, as well as authors impression.","Stevens-Carr, Mary; Sethi, Kevin; Cochran, Channing; Bencomo-Rivera, Margaret; Marceaux, Janice",Innov Aging,417,1

Additional to accounting a flow field, sound levels for different located receivers due to backward-facing step flow are determined using Acoustic Analogy (AA) which is firstly proposed by Lighthill. Unsteady flow field variables obtained from computational fluid dynamics commercial code is used as input in Ffowcs Williams-Hawkings (FW-H) Equation, which is an extended version of Lighthill equation. Additionally, some active flow control methodologies are carried out to a flow field to understand better relations between flow controls and acoustic results. These flow control techniques are the suction and blowing with different magnitudes at the bottom of backward-facing step. The controlled cases are also compared with experimental flow field results and validated. Acoustic results are plotted in frequency and time domain.

No strategy exists, however, to orchestrate the execution of transformations if the network has an arbitrary topology. In this paper, we analyse how often and in which order transformations need to be executed. We argue why linear execution bounds are too restrictive to be useful in practice and prove that there is no upper bound for the number of necessary executions. To avoid non-termination, we propose a conservative strategy that makes execution failures easier to understand. These insights help developers and users of transformation networks to understand under which circumstances their networks can terminate.

Observing them at work in Paris is thus a fruitful ‘laboratory experience’ to identify the major features of the prefectoral culture—quite distinct from the classic bureaucratic culture. Our interviewees make three main self-legitimizing claims: (1) ‘We are officials with a ground-level experience’, as opposed to the ‘bureaucrats’ of the central services. (2) ‘We are representatives of the whole State and the General Interest’, meaning that they refuse to be assimilated to public servants among others, confined to the specific ministry where they temporarily work. (3) They reverse to their advantage the criticism against their politicization by claiming to be ‘the only civil servants who understand the logic of politics’. These identity assertions, which are attempts by the prefectoral corps to heighten its own stature with respect to rival groups and ministries, reveal its ambition to co-govern the State along with the political masters.","Eymeri-Douzans, Jean-Michel","Prefects, Governors and Commissioners",417,1

In general, this type of application collects data from the environment using edge devices and sends them to a remote cloud to be processed. In this setting, the governance of the application and its data is, usually, unilaterally defined by the cloud-based application provider. We propose an architectural model which allows this kind of application to be governed solely by the community of users, instead. We consider members of a community who have some common problem to solve, and eliminate the dependence on an external cloud-based application provider by leveraging the capabilities of the devices sitting on the edge of the network. We combine the concepts of Participatory Sensing, Mobile Social Networks and Edge Computing, which allows data processing to be done closer to data sources. We define our model and then present a case study that aims to evaluate the feasibility of our proposal, and how its performance compares to that of other existing solutions (e.g. cloud-based architecture). The case study uses simulation experiments fed with real data from the public transport system of Curitiba city, in Brazil. The results show that the proposed approach is feasible, and can aggregate as much data as current approaches that use remote dedicated servers. Differently from the all-or-nothing sharing policy of current approaches, the approach proposed allows users to autonomously configure the trade-off between the sharing of private data, and the performance that the application can achieve.","Mafra, João; Brasileiro, Francisco; Lopes, Raquel",Cloud Computing and Services Science,417,10

We evaluated the timing of NBS for babies enrolled prenatally (n = 932) and postnatally (n = 11,133) and reasons for delays in screening and reporting. Although prenatal enrollment led to faster return of results (median = 13 days after birth), results for babies enrolled postnatally were still available within a timeframe (median = 21 days after birth) that allowed the opportunity to receive essential treatment early in life.

The 2020 conflict was not merely rooted in the economic disaster following the COVID-19 pandemic, but in fact stretches back to the 2009 postal financial crisis. I argue that these crises are an unintended consequence of the compromise formation of the USPS as a hybrid government agency/business. Debates over whether public or private postal service too often leave out conflict over the rights of postal labor. The origins of that debate lie in the former USPOD’s management of labor using “business methods” that included authoritarian discipline, contingent workers to cut costs, and creating racial divisions among employees.","Rubio, Philip F.",Employ Respons Rights J,417,16

The increasing uncertainty of the COVID‐19 outbreak has made stock markets in China more turbulent and less predictable. Under the current exceptional circumstances, the hospitality industry suffered the most due to the travel restrictions. This research thus assesses the dynamic relationship among the COVID‐19 outbreak, macroeconomic fluctuations and hospitality stock returns based on a structural VAR framework from 13 January to 11 May 2020, in China. Evidence reveals that macroeconomic fluctuations and hospitality stock returns are significantly affected by shocks from the COVID‐19 outbreak. An unanticipated positive change of the COVID‐19 explosion triggers an addition in exchange rates and causes a reduction in the stock market and hospitality industry returns. For the impacts of the exchange rate, findings reveal that a surprise increase in exchange rates (currency depreciation) exerts a significant negative influence on stock market returns. Additionally, a positive change of stock market returns is linked to a decline in exchange rates and a rise in hospitality industry returns. Therefore, knowledge of these relationships can enable policymakers to evaluate and implement effective policies to stabilize the stock markets and help investors to make appropriate investment strategies.","Lee, Chi‐Chuan; Lee, Chien‐Chiang; Wu, Yizhong",,417,16

Proposing useful methods to screen and diagnose the patient’s situation for the purpose of specifying the adequate clinical management represents a significant challenge in diminishing the rates of mortality. Inspired from this current global health situation, we introduce a new autonomous process of decision-making that consists of two modules. The first module is the data analysis based on Bayesian network that is employed to indicate the coronavirus symptoms severity and then classify COVID-19 cases as severe, moderate or mild. The second module represents the decision-making based on association rules method that generates autonomously the adequate decision. To construct the model of Bayesian network, we used an effective method-oriented data for the sake of learning its structure. As a result, the algorithm accuracy in making the correct decision is 30% and in making the adequate decision is 70%.

METHODS: The systematic literature search gathered 48 meta-analyses and systematic reviews from 53 research reports, contributing 56 independent effect sizes for analysis. These effect sizes were statistically integrated, and five moderators of theoretical and methodological importance were tested using meta-regression. RESULTS: On average, intervention programs are associated with a significant reduction in recidivism (r(Φ) = −0.09, p < 0.001) for juvenile offenders who participate in a program compared to those who do not. However, reductions in recidivism significantly vary between the levels of criminal justice system, characteristics of juvenile offenders, types of program modalities, and methodological quality. CONCLUSIONS: Results indicate that intervention programs can be an effective approach to reducing recidivism for juvenile offenders, especially when combined with a rehabilitative program modality.

In this investigation, we propose that the degree to which negative emotions mediate the link between system justification and collective action may depend upon whether individuals tend to suppress the expression of their negative emotions. We tested this hypothesis in the diverse socio-political contexts of Turkey, Israel, and the U.S. In one correlational study (Study 1) and three experimental studies (Studies 2–4), we observed that the link between system justification and willingness to participate in collective action through anger (Studies 1–2 and 4) and guilt (Study 3) was moderated by expressive suppression. We found that negative emotions mediated the association between system justification and collective action among those who suppress the expression of their emotions less frequently, but not those who use expressive suppression more frequently. These findings suggest that emotion regulation may undermine, rather than facilitate, efforts to engage in collective action even among people who are low in system justification.

Patients with aHUS are currently treated with eculizumab while there is no specific treatment for other complement-mediated renal diseases. In this study the phenotype of three FB missense variants, detected in patients with aHUS (D371G and E601K) and MPGN (I242L), was investigated. Patient sera with the D371G and I242L mutations induced hemolysis of sheep erythrocytes. Mutagenesis was performed to study the effect of factor D (FD) inhibition on C3 convertase-induced FB cleavage, complement-mediated hemolysis, and the release of soluble C5b-9 from glomerular endothelial cells. The FD inhibitor danicopan abrogated C3 convertase-associated FB cleavage to the Bb fragment in patient serum, and of the FB constructs, D371G, E601K, I242L, the gain-of-function mutation D279G, and the wild-type construct, in FB-depleted serum. Furthermore, the FD-inhibitor blocked hemolysis induced by the D371G and D279G gain-of-function mutants.

These results suggest that FD inhibition can effectively block complement overactivation induced by FB gain-of-function mutations.","Aradottir, Sigridur Sunna; Kristoffersson, Ann-Charlotte; Roumenina, Lubka T.; Bjerre, Anna; Kashioulis, Pavlos; Palsson, Runolfur; Karpman, Diana",Front Immunol,417,16
55206,55206,55206,The subnational supply chain and the COVID‐19 pandemic: Short‐term impacts on the Brazilian regional economy,17.433443,3.2414389,2021-06-22,"INTRODUCTION: Although COVID‐19 related teaching restrictions have impacted all aspects of medical curricula, gross anatomy has been disproportionately affected. To decrease in‐person contact many medical schools have adapted their curricula by reducing or eliminating gross dissection. The Indiana University School of Medicine (IUSM), believing gross dissection to be a critical foundational curricular component, retained cadaveric dissection in 2020 but in a reduced capacity (i.e., fewer labs and fewer student per lab). In an effort to address this shortfall in dissection experience and to increase student preparedness, 24 pre‐lab demonstration videos covering 26 individual dissections were prepared for the 2020 cohort. RESEARCH AIM: To determine if individual student performance is correlated with viewing pre‐lab videos. METHODS: Pre‐lab videos were available to all first‐year students at IUSM (n=378 students across 9 campuses). Viewership data (total views, total duration) were aggregated from the Kaltura online video platform. Student exam performance data (practical and written exams) were compared to viewership data using the Pearson correlation test. RESULTS: 91.5% of student course evaluation respondents (n=329) report that they viewed pre‐lab videos. Pearson's correlation tests revealed a positive correlation between viewership activity and overall performance on all exams. The strongest correlation (0.182) was between total views and overall practical exam performance. Correlation coefficients for individual block exams vary and range between 0.13 (back, upper limb and thorax) and 0.253 (Head and Neck). Likewise, correlation coefficients varied across campuses with several campuses exceeding the statewide values. CONCLUSION: Pre‐lab videos are an effective tool for exporting traditional lab‐based learning from the lab environment when access and dissection time are limited. Their most immediate and significant impact is on practical exam performance although positive correlations between viewership data and performance on written exams with NBME‐style questions suggests pre‐lab videos effectively reinforce foundational anatomical relationships and concepts. While not directly addressing questions of overall cohort performance, particularly when dissection access is not limited, future directions for this research will include direct comparisons of overall class performance in multiple cohorts with and without full dissection schedule and with or without the aid of pre‐lab videos. Likewise, student evaluation comments suggest that pre‐lab videos were used in a variety of contexts (i.e., lab prep, peer‐teaching, general study). An online survey exploring how students use the pre‐lab videos was sent to the 2020 cohort at course end to better understand how students are using them. IMPLICATIONS: Medical educators are increasingly asked to teach more with fewer contact hours. COVID‐19 has exacerbated this situation. This study provides new data suggesting that pre‐lab videos are an effective tool for exporting traditional lab‐based learning when lab contact time is decreased.","Deane, Andrew; Wisner, Rebecca; Byram, Jessica",FASEB J,417,16

For the remainder of the academic year, all students were required to adopt to a new learning environment where all aspects of the M.D. program were delivered in an online platform. An ongoing study was taking place to evaluate how voluntary attendance at non‐mandatory sessions affected performance and wellness. The students in this study who had been attending non mandatory in‐person sessions were now only given the option of watching pre‐recorded sessions online. The study investigators hypothesized that this change would affect the wellness of the students who were attenders prior to the pandemic more so than then non‐attenders. This was an observational cohort study in which prospectively collected attendance at non‐mandatory sessions during the first year of the MD program was correlated with responses to a wellness survey deployed pre‐ and post‐ the onset of the pandemic. The 69‐item survey was adapted from published and validated instruments: Graduate Stress Inventory – Revised (GSI‐R), Modified School Burnout Inventory, “Healthy Days Measure” (CDC HRQOL‐4), Pearlin Mastery Scale (Mastery), Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS), De Jong Gierveld 6‐Item Loneliness Scale and Lubben Social Network Scale – 6 item (LSNS‐6). Multiple regression and Poisson regression analysis was performed as appropriate to predict participants wellness based upon attendance while controlling for collected demographics. Eighty‐two students participated in the larger study and of those, 44 responded to the pre‐pandemic survey. Attendance was associated with lower stress overall as measured by the GSI (β= ‐0.331, p= 0.048, R(2)= 0.217) including lower scores in the Family Stress subscale (B= ‐0.01, p= <0.001). Loneliness also decreased with increasing attendance (B= ‐0.015, p= 0.008). Increase in attendance was associated with fewer days unable to do normal activities due to poor physical or mental health, as measured by the CDC HRQOL‐4 (β= ‐0.339, p= 0.043, R(2)= 0.216). Thirty‐nine students participated in the post‐pandemic survey, where again attendance was associated with lower stress according to the GSI (β= ‐0.482, p= 0.029, R(2)= 0.203). Thirty‐one students completed both surveys for paired analysis. Increase in attendance before COVID‐19 was associated with a decrease in poor mental health afterwards as measured by the CDC HRQOL‐4 (B= ‐0.007, p= 0.004). The rest of the regressions did not demonstrate an association between attendance and other aspects of wellness pre‐ or post‐ the pandemic. Attending non‐mandatory sessions was associated with a decrease in graduate stress both pre and post COVID‐19 lockdown. Most other results were not statistically significant, elucidating that there may be no major differences between attender's and non‐attender's experience of burnout or social isolation.","Salzman, Joshua; Williamson, Macy; Epsina‐Rey, Andrea; Kibble, Jonathan; Kauffman, Christine",FASEB J,417,1

To date, however, little research has been conducted on the influence of these mental states on trust in the government – the uncontested key player in times of crises. Drawing on the appraisal and affective intelligence theories of emotions, we argue that fear and anger as the two crucial negative emotions in times of crises have divergent effects on trust in the government: Whereas fear leads to a rally‐‘round‐the‐flag effect increasing trust in the government, anger attributes blame for the adverse circumstances to the government. We present empirical evidence for our arguments with an original three‐wave online panel survey of 1’600 Swiss residents during the unprecedented times of the coronavirus pandemic. Our analysis provides empirical support for our arguments and further shows that the relationship is strongest for right‐wing respondents.","Erhardt, Julian; Freitag, Markus; Filsinger, Maximilian; Wamsler, Steffen",,417,1

However, the relevance of LDHA in colon adenocarcinoma (COAD) remains unclear. In this study, we analyzed the correlation between the expression of LDHA and clinicopathological characteristics in COAD using immunohistochemistry analysis, and then used integrative bioinformatics analyses to further study the function and role of LDHA in COAD. We found that LDHA was highly expressed in COAD tissues compared with adjacent normal tissues, and that COAD patients with high LDHA expression levels showed poor survival. In addition, LDHA expression was closely associated with the immune infiltrating levels of CD8+ T cells, neutrophils, and dendritic cells. Our findings highlight the potential role of LDHA in the tumorigenesis and prognosis of COAD. Furthermore, our results indicate that COAD is a novel immune checkpoint in the diagnosis and treatment of COAD.","Wang, Yutong; Nie, Hui; Liao, Zhiming; He, Xiaoyun; Xu, Zhijie; Zhou, Jianhua; Ou, Chunlin",Front Oncol,417,1

The need for these opportunities increased substantially for families throughout 2020, as food insecurity quadrupled in the UK during the Covid-19 pandemic. In this qualitative study, holiday club staff from England and Wales reflected on the adaptations they implemented in order to maintain food supplies and food-related enrichment activities for families during the first UK national Covid-19 lockdown and subsequently throughout the summer of 2020. Staff also reflected on the opportunities and challenges related to implementing these adaptations during this period. Twenty-five holiday club staff engaged in video-based interviews during August and September 2020. The findings revealed a range of innovative changes to holiday club food provision, and the challenges and opportunities faced varied across holiday clubs. Challenges during the pandemic in some clubs included staff shortages (typically due to furloughing and/or increased working demands) and difficulties sourcing adequate funding. However, staff identified that the opportunities for holiday clubs included enhanced partnership working during the pandemic, increased engagement with digital technology to communicate with families and deliver their online cooking sessions, and their ability to continue providing food and much needed creative opportunities for children unable to attend school and/or the holiday club. The ability of clubs to adapt their models of working when faced with adversity was essential in protecting their organisational resilience and delivering their vital services. The findings emphasise the important role that holiday clubs play in their communities and highlight their willingness to adapt and expand their role in response to the pandemic to continue to tackle food insecurity and provide vital food and food-related enrichment opportunities to families. The findings also identify lessons that can be applied to practise in the future.","Bayes, Natasha; Holley, Clare E.; Haycraft, Emma; Mason, Carolynne",Front Public Health,417,7

METHODS Five hundred patients with myocardial infarction and 500 healthy controls were randomly selected. Fluorescent PCR and Sanger sequencing were used to detect the CYP2C19 and CYP3A5 gene polymorphisms. Logistic regression was used to analyze the correlation between the polymorphisms and myocardial infarction. Quanto software was used to evaluate the statistical power. RESULTS The two groups had significant difference in the frequency of AG, GG genotypes and A allele of the CYP2C19 gene rs4986893 locus and the AA, AG, GG genotypes and G allele of the CYP3A5 gene rs776746 locus ( P<0.05), but not in the frequency of genotypes and alleles of CYP2C19 gene rs4244285 and rs12248560 loci, and the AA genotype of the rs4986893 locus. After correction for age, gender, and body mass index, Logistic regression indicated that the AG genotype and A allele of the CYP2C19 gene rs4986893 locus, and the GG genotype and G allele of CYP3A5 gene rs776746 locus are associated with susceptibility of myocardial infarction, while rs4986893 GG genotype and AA and AG genotypes of rs776746 may confer a protective effect. Based on the sample size and allele frequency, analysis with Quanto software suggested that the result of this study has a statistical power of 99%.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and feasibility of this procedure. METHODS Between July 2009 and April 2010, SILC was performed for 35 patients presenting with pathology of the colon. Surgical procedures included right hemicolectomy, sigmoid resection, and total colectomy. Demographic data, intraoperative parameters, and short-term postoperative outcomes were assessed. RESULTS Thirty two of the 35 patients (91.4%) underwent successful completion of SILC while 3 patients required laparoscopic modifications. The mean incision length was 3.4 cm with a range of 2-6 cm. The mean total operative time (OT) for right, left, and total colectomies was 158.8 ± 31.8 min, 127.0 ± 37.1 min, and 216.3 ± 72.6 min, respectively. Overall, the OT was not significantly different between patients with a body mass index (BMI) ≥ 25 kg/m(2) (147.9 ± 47.9 min) compared to those with a BMI <25 kg/m(2) (123.1 ± 40.9 min).

It is characterised by the development of endometrial tissue outside the uterine cavity. It is the most common cause of pelvic pain in women. This endometrial tissue development is dependent on oestrogen produced primarily by the ovaries and, therefore, traditional management has focused on suppression of ovarian function. Mounting evidence shows that altered immune function plays a crucial role in the genesis and development of endometriosis. In this review we considered modulation of the inflammation as an alternative approach. OBJECTIVES To determine the effectiveness and safety of anti-tumour necrosis factor-α (anti-TNF-α) treatment in the management of endometriosis in premenopausal women. SEARCH METHODS For the first publication of this review, we searched for trials in the following databases (from their inception to August 2009): Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Specialised Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and PsycINFO. In addition, we searched all reference lists of included trials and contacted experts in the field in an attempt to locate trials. We reran this search to 3 September 2012 for this update. SELECTION CRITERIA Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing anti-TNF-α drugs with placebo, no treatment, medical treatment, or surgery for pelvic pain associated with endometriosis were included. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, assessed trial quality, and extracted data using data extraction forms. The domains assessed for risk of bias were sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, incomplete outcome data, and selective outcome reporting. We used risk ratios (RR) for reporting dichotomous data with 95% confidence intervals (CI), whilst we expressed continuous data as mean differences (MD). We assessed statistical heterogeneity using the I(2) statistic. MAIN RESULTS Only one trial involving 21 participants was included. The results showed no evidence of an effect of infliximab, one of the known anti-TNF-α drugs, on pelvic pain reduction using the Biberoglu-Behrman (BB) score (0 to 3 scale) for participants (MD -0.14, 95% CI -0.43 to 0.15), the BB score for clinicians (MD -0.14, 95% CI -0.39 to 0.11), or a visual analogue pain score (VAS, 100 mm scale) (MD -5.60, 95% CI -16.10 to 4.90), or on the use of pain killers (ibuprofen, g/day) (MD -0.10, 95% CI -0.30 to 0.10). There was no evidence of an increase in adverse events in the infliximab group compared with placebo (RR 3.73, 95% CI 0.22 to 63.66). We found no evidence of clinical benefits of infliximab for endometriotic lesions, dysmenorrhoea, dyspareunia, or pelvic tenderness. To date, there is no trial that has reported a cost-effectiveness analysis of anti-TNF-α drugs, or the odds of recurrence. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS This review was updated in 2012. The results of the original review published in 2010 remain unchanged. There is still not enough evidence to support the use of anti-TNF-α drugs in the management of women with endometriosis for the relief of pelvic pain.","Lu, Donghao; Song, Huan; Shi, Gang",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,417,0

Many of these workers experience higher job pressure and increased risk of infection due to their work. It is crucial to investigate which factors that can contribute to insomnia in these important sectors. METHODS Data was collected using an online survey administered in June 2020. The questionnaire measured demographic variables, sleep, stress, psychosocial factors and health concerns (i.e worrying about health consequences related to the pandemic). The sample in the present study consisted of 1327 (76% females) employees in organizations with societal critical functions. RESULTS The employees reported higher levels of insomnia symptoms compared to normative data collected before the pandemic. Health concerns specifically related to COVID-19 had the strongest association to insomnia, followed by work stress. Job demands (i.e workload, time pressure and overtime) had merely a weak association to insomnia. CONCLUSION Worrying about consequences the pandemic can have on your own health and the health of your family or colleagues have a stronger negative impact on sleep than work pressure during the COVID-19 pandemic. Impaired sleep can have detrimental effects on performance and health, and a stronger focus on preventing insomnia as a mean of sustaining critical societal functions both during and after the pandemic is warranted. Organizations should consider interventions aimed at reducing health concerns among their employees during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Sørengaard, Torhild Anita; Saksvik-Lehouillier, Ingvild",Sleep medicine,417,1

This work evaluated two specific angiographic signs for infarct prediction in the basal ganglia immediately after successful mechanical intra-arterial thrombectomy. METHODS In this retrospective study, 57 consecutive patients (mean ± SD age 67 ± 15 years) with acute occlusion of the proximal anterior circulation who underwent mechanical thrombectomy of the M1 segment of the middle cerebral artery were included. Two separate angiographic signs, early venous drainage and capillary blush, were identified and analysed regarding their statistical significance for infarct prediction within the basal ganglia. RESULTS Four patients were excluded due to parenchymal haemorrhage. Forty-four of 53 patients developed infarction of the basal ganglia. Sensitivity/specificity were 93%/27%, respectively, for the capillary blush sign and 88%/63%, respectively, for the early venous drainage sign. Combining both signs increased the sensitivity and specificity to 88% and 81%, respectively, and increased the positive predictive value to 95%. CONCLUSIONS Both angiographic signs seem to predict the irreversible damage of tissue in the basal ganglia reliably despite successful recanalization of the middle cerebral artery in patients with ischaemic stroke. KEY POINTS • Evaluation of success in neurointerventional procedures is mainly based on recanalization rates. • Two separate angiographic signs can predict infarction immediately after proximal MCA recanalization. • Combining both signs increases their specificity.","Fritzsch, D; Reiss-Zimmermann, M; Lobsien, D; Quäschling, U; Hoffmann, K T",European radiology,417,27

In total, 30 rice grains were sampled around Agbaou and Bonikro gold mines. Arsenic and cadmium concentrations were determined using an inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES), while atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS) was used for mercury. Results showed that As and Hg average concentrations in rice were above the permissible limits, while Cd average concentrations were below the permissible limit established by FAO/WHO in both sites. Except for Hg at Agbaou, no significant (p < 0.05) difference was found between trace metal concentrations in the two sites. The average daily intake (ADI) of As via rice consumption exceeded the USEPA reference dose (RfD) of 0.0003 μg g-1 day-1, indicating that rice ingestion is a pathway of As exposure for adults and children in the area. The average values of non-carcinogen (HQ) for As and carcinogen (CR) for As and Cd risks index suggest that potential health risks exist for both adults and children due to rice consumption at Agbaou and Bonikro. The maximum safe weekly consumption (MSWC) of rice relative to As, Cd, and Hg was estimated for the study area. Overall, this study provides strong evidence that As could threaten local population health in Côte d'Ivoire regions where gold mine extraction is occurring through rice ingestion.","Kinimo, Kakou Charles; Yao, Koffi Marcellin; Marcotte, Stéphane; Kouassi, N'Guessan Louis Berenger; Trokourey, Albert",Environmental science and pollution research international,417,27

In the present study, a specific sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for detection of RHDV2 antigens in rabbit liver homogenates, based on the use of an RHDV2-specific monoclonal antibody (Mab) 2D9 for antigen capture and an anti-RHDV2 goat polyclonal antibody (Pab), was developed. This ELISA was able to successfully detect RHDV2 and RHDV2 recombinant virions with high sensitivity (100%) and specificity (97.22%). No cross-reactions were detected with RHDV G1 viruses while low cross-reactivity was detected with one of the RHDVa samples analyzed. The ELISA afforded good repeatability and had high analytical sensitivity as it was able to detect a dilution 1:163,640 (6.10ng/mL) of purified RHDV-N11 VLPs, which contained approximately 3.4×108molecules/mL particles. The reliable discrimination between closely related viruses is crucial to understand the epidemiology and the interaction of co-existing pathogens.

Family physicians (FPs) have played a critical role in the coordination of care. MATERIALS AND METHODS In April 2020, we performed an online prospective survey to assess the impact of the pandemic on FPs' practices. RESULTS Three hundred FPs were included. Mean age was 53.6 ± 13.5 years. Before the pandemic, 60.2% reported >75 outpatient visits/week, which reduced down to an average of <20/week for 79.8% of FPs; 24.2% of FPs discontinued home visits, while for 94.7% of FPs there was a >50% increase in the number of telephone consultations. Concern related to the risk of contagion was elevated (≥3/5 in 74.6%) and even higher to the risk of infecting relatives and patients (≥3/5 in 93.3%). The majority of FPs (87%) supported the role of telemedicine in the near future. Satisfaction regarding the network with hospitals/COVID-19-dedicated wards received a score ≤2/5 in 46.9% of cases.

While rapid identification of viruses has been shown to reduce antibiotic use, the impact of detecting specific viruses on antibiotic utilization has not been ascertained. This study compared antibiotic utilization among hospitalized children who tested positive for different respiratory viruses at admission. METHODS A single-center study of hospitalized children under 21 years of age who tested positive at admission for at least 1 respiratory virus by multiplex polymerase chain reaction from October 1, 2012 to October 1, 2015 was performed. Multivariable logistic regression was used to determine the association of testing positive for specific viruses with the use of antibiotics for ≥ 2 days, adjusted for demographic and clinical characteristics. RESULTS The study included 1416 patients with a median age of 2.1 years (interquartile range: 0.6-6.2 years). Patients positive for influenza (odds ratio: 2.0, 95% confidence interval: 1.1-3.4) and human metapneumovirus (odds ratio: 2.0, 95% confidence interval: 1.1-3.7) were more likely to receive ≥ 2 days of treatment compared with patients positive for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Other variables affecting prolonged use of antibiotics included respiratory support, primary nonrespiratory diagnosis, complex comorbid conditions and admission to the intensive care unit. CONCLUSIONS Providers are more likely to use antibiotics in non-RSV-infected patients compared with RSV. These trends likely represent concern about bacterial superinfection and may reflect lack of familiarity with these pathogens.","Goriacko, Pavel; Saiman, Lisa; Zachariah, Philip",The Pediatric infectious disease journal,417,0

METHODS Fifty-three patients (13 girls; mean age 7.2 years, 20% younger than 10 years of age) who underwent bone scintigraphy for suspected OO between 2005 and 2010 were included in the study, of whom 46 underwent a radiography at diagnosis. Computed tomography-guided biopsy was performed in all patients after bone scintigraphy, and radiofrequency ablation was performed following biopsy in patients with OO; ablation efficacy was confirmed by MRI at 1, 3, 12 and 18 months. RESULTS The radiographic results were negative in 27/46 patients and was unclear in 19. Bone scintigraphy showed lesions in 53/53 patients, of whom 51 patients had a typical pattern of osteoma and nine patients required an additional scan with a pinhole collimator. Histological examination showed OO in 51/53 patients (3/51 intramedullary), Ewing's sarcoma in 1/53 patients, and chronic osteomyelitis in 1/53 patients. CONCLUSION Any child with recurrent nocturnal pain and/or limb swelling should undergo radiography of the involved skeletal segment, which is the first-choice diagnostic method in the clinical suspicion of OO. In the event of ambiguous or negative radiographic results, bone scintigraphy is needed to exclude other pathologic conditions and to confirm the diagnosis. In children with recurrent but not well-localized bone pain in which OO is strongly suspected for signs and symptoms, a bone scan can help detect the lesion. The diagnostic accuracy of the bone scan, particularly for the appendicular skeleton, can be improved by pinhole collimator acquisition.","Villani, Maria F; Falappa, Piergiorgio; Pizzoferro, Milena; Toniolo, Renato M; Lembo, Antonio; Chiapparelli, Stefano; Garganese, Maria C",Nuclear medicine communications,417,1

We have identified the experimental data on the inhibitory activity of compounds tested against the closely related (96 % sequence identity, 100 % active site conservation) Mpro of SARS-CoV. We developed QSAR models of these inhibitors and employed these models for virtual screening of all drugs in the DrugBank database. Similarity searching and molecular docking were explored in parallel, but docking failed to correctly discriminate between experimentally active and inactive compounds, so it was not relied upon for prospective virtual screening.

Herein, we characterize a variant virus from B6-GKO mice persistently infected with JHMV. Viruses were isolated from ascites at 25 d post-infection and cloned by limiting dilution on DBT cells; one variant was named 25V16G. To compare pathogenicity in vivo, we inoculated 25V16G and JHMV intraperitoneally into 8- to 12-week-old B6-GKO mice. Whereas nearly all of the B6-GKO mice infected with JHMV survived over 14 d, all of those infected with 25V16G died by 9 d post-infection. Histopathological examination revealed that 25V16G induced acute fulminant hepatitis in B6-GKO mice, whereas JHMV caused severe but focal hepatitis. The virus titer of 25V16G in the liver was 50- and 250-fold higher than that of JHMV at 5 and 7 d post-infection, respectively. However, there was no significant difference in viral growth between 25V16G and JHMV in cell lines cultured in vitro. Nucleotide sequencing of the S gene of 25V16G and JHMV revealed a deletion of 29 amino acids encompassing S(511-539), which covers a major cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) epitope in C57BL/6 mice, and two point mutations resulting in amino acid changes in the S protein of 25V16G. One explanation for the greater pathogenicity of 25V16G is that 25V16G escapes CTL-mediated protection in B6-GKO mice. This experimental model may be used to assess the role of IFN-gamma in viral persistence in vivo.","Kyuwa, Shigeru; Takagaki, Satoshi; Matsuyama, Shutoku; Taguchi, Fumihiro; Saegusa, Junzo; Iwakura, Yoichiroh; Tagawa, Yoh-Ichi; Yoshikawa, Yasuhiro",Viral immunology,417,1

We hypothesized that rapid ascent to high altitude alters neuro-axonal integrity that can be detected by increased concentration of serum neurofilament light (sNfL) in the blood and may be even exaggerated in subjects with AMS. METHODS sNfL was measured by a single molecule array (Simoa) assay in 47 healthy subjects at low altitude (423m) and 44h after rapid and active ascent to high altitude (4559m). Peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2 ) and partial pressures of oxygen (pO2 ) were obtained at low and high altitude. The Acute Mountain Sickness-Cerebral (AMS-C) scoring system was used to assess AMS-incidence and -severity. RESULTS sNfL increased from baseline to high altitude (6.34±1.96 vs 7.19±3.14 pg/mL; p=0.014) but sNfL did not correlate with SpO2 (r=-0.19; p=0.066) or pO2 (r=-0.19; p=0.068). The incidence of AMS at high altitude was 62%. Neither at low altitude (p=0.706) nor at high altitude (p=0.985) there was a difference in sNfL between subjects with and without AMS as measured three days following rapid ascent and 44h of high-altitude exposure. Altitude sNfL did not correlate with AMS-C overall- and single item-scores such as headache severity. CONCLUSIONS Rapid ascent of healthy subjects to high altitude provokes an increase in sNfL 44h after arrival at 4559m, which is not related to the magnitude of hypoxaemia or AMS incidence and severity, suggesting that neuro-axonal injury does not directly contribute to AMS.","Sareban, Mahdi; Berger, Marc Moritz; Pinter, Daniela; Buchmann, Arabella; Macholz, Franziska; Schmidt, Peter; Schiefer, Lisa; Schimke, Magdalena; Niebauer, Josef; Steinacker, Jürgen Michael; Treff, Gunnar; Khalil, Michael",European journal of neurology,417,25

This study assesses POCUS investigator and journal editor attitudes towards barriers to adhering to the Standards for Reporting of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (STARD) 2015 guidelines. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS Two separate surveys using a 5-point Likert scale were sent to POCUS study investigators and journal editors to assess for knowledge, attitude and behavioural barriers to the complete reporting of POCUS research. Respondents were identified based on a previous study assessing STARD 2015 adherence for POCUS studies published in emergency medicine, anaesthesia and critical care journals. Responses were anonymously linked to STARD 2015 adherence data from the previous study. Written responses were thematically grouped into the following categories: knowledge, attitude and behavioural barriers to quality reporting, or other. Likert response items are reported as median with IQRs. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The primary outcome was the median Likert score for the investigator and editor surveys assessing knowledge, attitude and behavioural beliefs about barriers to adhering to the STARD 2015 guidelines. RESULTS The investigator survey response rate was 18/69 (26%) and the editor response rate was 5/21 (24%). Most investigator respondents were emergency medicine practitioners (13/21, 62%). Two-thirds of investigators were aware of the STARD 2015 guidelines (12/18, 67%) and overall agreed that incomplete reporting limits generalisability and the ability to detect risk of bias (median 4 (4, 5)). Investigators felt that the STARD 2015 guidelines were useful, easy to find and easy to use (median 4 (4, 4.25); median 4 (4, 4.25) and median 4 (3, 4), respectively). There was a shared opinion held by investigators and editors that the peer review process be primarily responsible for ensuring complete research reporting (median 4 (3, 4) and median 4 (3.75, 4), respectively). Three of 18 authors (17%) felt that the English publication language of STARD 2015 was a barrier to adherence. CONCLUSIONS Although investigators and editors recognise the importance of completely reported research, reporting quality is still a core issue for POCUS research. The shared opinion held by investigators and editors that the peer review process be primarily responsible for reporting quality is potentially problematic; we view completely reported research as an integral part of the research process that investigators are responsible for, with the peer review process serving as another additional layer of quality control. Endorsement of reporting guidelines by journals, auditing reporting guideline adherence during the peer review process and translation of STARD 2015 guidelines into additional languages may improve reporting completeness for the acute POCUS literature.

We describe the long-term patterns of paediatric disease associated with three of these viruses, HCoV-NL63, OC43 and 229E, in coastal Kenya. Methods: Continuous surveillance of pneumonia admissions was conducted at the Kilifi county hospital (KCH) located in the northern coastal region of Kenya. Children aged <5 years admitted to KCH with clinically defined syndromic severe or very severe pneumonia were recruited. Respiratory samples were taken and tested for 15 virus targets, using real-time polymerase chain reaction. Unadjusted odds ratios were used to estimate the association between demographic and clinical characteristics and HCoV positivity. Results: From 2007 to 2019, we observed 11,445 pneumonia admissions, of which 314 (3.9%) tested positive for at least one of the HCoV types surveyed in the study. There were 129 (41.1%) OC43, 99 (31.5%) 229E, 74 (23.6%) NL63 positive cases and 12 (3.8%) cases of HCoV to HCoV coinfection. Among HCoV positive cases, 47% (n=147) were coinfected with other respiratory virus pathogens. The majority of HCoV cases were among children aged <1 year (66%, n=208), though there was was no change in the proportion infected by age. HCoV-OC43 was predominant of the three HCoV types throughout the surveillance period. Evidence for seasonality was not identified. Conclusions: Overall, 4% of paediatric pneumonia admissions were associated with three endemic HCoVs, with a high proportion of cases co-occurring with another respiratory virus, no clear seasonal pattern, and with the age-distribution of cases following that of pneumonia admissions (i.e. highest in infants). These observations suggest, at most, a small severe disease contribution of endemic HCoVs in this tropical setting and offer insight into their potential future burden and epidemiological characteristics.","Otieno, Grieven P; Murunga, Nickson; Agoti, Charles N; Gallagher, Katherine E; Awori, Juliet O; Nokes, D James",Wellcome open research,417,20

Various factors like leaf extract, silver nitrate concentrations, and duration of autoclaving were standardized during synthesis. Nanoparticles were analyzed with UV-visible absorption spectroscopy (UV-vis), dynamic light scattering, zeta potential, X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy techniques. The synthesis was noted at 0.4% extract, 0.6 mM silver nitrate, 30 min of autoclaving and NP formation was confirmed from 424 nm peak in UV-vis. NP showed zeta potential of - 27 mV, face-centered cubic (fcc) crystal nature and sized around 16.5 ± 5.9 nm. Biogenic NP synthesized from susceptible rice variety were used as an antibacterial agent against phytopathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo), the causative agent of bacterial leaf blight (BLB) disease in rice. Antibacterial effect of Ag NP was evaluated using in vitro assays and in vivo efficacy under greenhouse conditions. Results confirmed effective inhibition of Xoo growth and colony formation by Ag NP and found to be the more powerful antibacterial agent. Besides, Ag NP treatment (10 µg/mL) caused an enhancement in seedling vigor index. Pots treated with Ag NP (15 μg/mL) in vivo in greenhouse showed disease severity of 26.6% and disease decrease over control of 49.2%, at a much lower NP concentration than earlier reported studies. Thus, the current report implies using the leaf extract synthesized Ag NP to control and BLB disease management in field conditions.","Namburi, Karunakar Reddy; Kora, Aruna Jyothi; Chetukuri, Anuradha; Kota, Vijaya Sree Meena Kumari",Bioprocess and biosystems engineering,417,1

The traditional theoretical explanation for imperfect synchronous courtship is that it arises as a by-product of the competition between males to broadcast leading signals to attract female attention. This competition is considered an evolutionary stable strategy maintained through sexual selection. However, previous studies have revealed that leading signals are not honest indicators of male quality. We studied imperfect courtship synchrony in fiddler crabs to mainly test whether (i) signal leadership and rate are defined by male quality and (ii) signal leadership generates synchrony. Fiddler crab males wave their enlarged claws during courtship, and females prefer leading males-displaying ahead of their neighbour(s). We filmed groups of waving males in the field to detect how often individuals were leaders and if they engaged in synchrony. Overall, we found that courtship effort is not directly related to male size, a general proxy for quality. Contrary to the long-standing assumption, we also revealed that leadership is not directly related to group synchrony, but faster wave rate correlates with both leadership and synchrony.

We thus sought to identify non-antibiotic substances with broad-spectrum activity able to destroy the EPS matrix and enhance the effect of antibiotics on embedded biofilm bacteria. Among eight substances tested, subtilisin A (0.01 U/mL) and calcium gluconate (CaG, Ca2+ 1.25 mmol/L) significantly reduced the biomass of biofilms formed by at least 21/24 S. aureus isolates. Confocal laser scanning microscopy confirmed that they both eliminated nearly all the proteins and PNAG from the matrix. By contrast, antibiotics alone had nearly no effect on biofilm biomass and the selected one (oxytetracycline-OTC) could only slightly reduce biofilm bacteria. The combination of OTC with CaG or subtilisin A led to an additive reduction (average of 2 log10 CFU/mL) of embedded biofilm bacteria on the isolates susceptible to OTC (MBC < 10 μg/mL, 11/24). Moreover, these two combinations led to a reduction of the embedded biofilm bacteria higher than 3 log10 CFU/mL for 20-25% of the isolates. Further studies are now required to better understand the factors that cause the biofilm produced by specific isolates (20-25%) to be susceptible to the combinations.","Liu, JingJing; Madec, Jean-Yves; Bousquet-Mélou, Alain; Haenni, Marisa; Ferran, Aude A",Scientific reports,417,31

We performed this retrospective study to evaluate the outcome of dMCA in patients. METHODS During a period of 10 years, we were able to identify seven patients with a total of eight dMCA aneurysms that were treated endovascularly. They were five men and two women, with a mean age of 36.1 years. All of the aneurysms, including five infectious and three dissecting ones, were treated for the aneurysm and its parent artery's occlusion, using coils and/or glue. RESULTS The clinical follow-up (9-96 m, mean 36.8 m) showed that they all improved over baseline; except for one patient in whom a mild right hemiparesis remained, after the hematoma evacuation. Angiographic follow-up (7-24 m; mean: 14.6 m) showed that all of them were stable and without the need for recanalization. CONCLUSIONS Our data indicated that endovascular treatment is a safe and effective alternative for the treatment of dMCA aneurysms, and should be considered when treating these aneurysms.","Lv, Nan; Zhou, Yu; Yang, Pengfei; Li, Qiang; Zhao, Rui; Fang, Yibin; Xu, Yi; Hong, Bo; Zhao, Wenyuan; Liu, Jianmin; Huang, Qinghai","Interventional neuroradiology : journal of peritherapeutic neuroradiology, surgical procedures and related neurosciences",417,29

METHODS In the last 10 years, 63 patients underwent MATHE at our department. We examined the clinical data of these patients and assessed the indications, postoperative outcomes, and prognostic factors of MATHE. RESULTS The 5-year overall survival (OS) rate was 53.4 %, and disease-free survival (DFS) rate was 66.0 %. Postoperative complications were observed in 22 cases (34.9 %), and recurrent disease occurred in 17 cases (27.0 %). On univariate analyses of OS, location of the tumor, tumor depth, lymph node metastasis, clinical stage, simultaneous resection of other organs, postoperative pneumonia, and blood loss were significant prognostic factors. On multivariate analyses, location of the tumor and lymph node metastasis were independent prognostic factors of OS. On univariate analyses, location of the tumor, tumor depth, lymph node metastasis, clinical stage, and blood loss were significant prognostic factors of DFS, while on multivariate analyses of DFS, lymph node metastasis and blood loss were independent prognostic factors. CONCLUSION MATHE is a useful procedure for the middle to lower thoracic esophageal cancer patients without clinical lymph node metastasis with serious complications who were unable to undergo thoracotomy.","Okumura, Hiroshi; Uchikado, Yasuto; Matsumoto, Masataka; Omoto, Itaru; Sasaki, Ken; Kita, Yoshiaki; Arigami, Takaaki; Uenosono, Yoshikazu; Nakajo, Akihiro; Owaki, Tetsuhiro; Mori, Shinichiro; Ishigami, Sumiya; Natsugoe, Shoji",Langenbeck's archives of surgery,417,24

The purpose of the study was to determine whether the introduction of a suspension stitch would improve early urinary continence rates in patients undergoing robotic prostatectomy for localized prostate cancer at our department. We retrospectively reviewed patients undergoing robotic prostatectomy with either suspension (n = 119) or figure-of-eight (n = 48) stitching of the dorsal venous complex. The patients submitted EPIC-26 questionnaires before surgery and after 3 and 18 months, respectively. Logistic regression analysis was run to determine the effect of the suspension stitch, nerve-sparing, posterior reconstruction, prostate volume, age and body mass index on early continence rate. The odds ratio of experiencing urinary leaks was 2.1 times higher (95% CI 1.0-4.3) in the figure-of-eight stitch group compared to the suspension stitch group 3 months after surgery (p < 0.05). The early urinary continence rate was 61.3% in the suspension stitch group compared to 35.4% in the figure-of-eight stitch group (p < 0.005). There were no differences between the groups 18 months post-prostatectomy (90.7% in the suspension stitch group versus 81.4% in the non-suspension stitch group, p = 0.1). Ordinal regression analysis identified the suspension stitch, bilateral nerve-sparing and body mass index as independent predictors of urinary continence at 3 months. The association between urinary continence and either unilateral nerve-sparing, posterior reconstruction, prostate volume or age did not reach statistical significance. Our results suggest that the suspension stitch improved early urinary continence following robotic prostatectomy.","Aarsæther, Erling; Roaldsen, Marius; Knutsen, Tore; Patel, Hiten R; Soltun, Bård",Journal of robotic surgery,417,16

Four databases (PubMed, MEDLINE, Web of Science and Scopus) were searched. From the 8052 records retrieved, 275 records were considered eligible for full-text screening. Nineteen studies met the inclusion criteria. Data extraction and quality assessment was performed by two independent reviewers. Six of the nineteen included studies were judged to have low risk of bias, and the rest had medium risk of bias. Compounds and particles such as zinc, tin, Selenium, chitosan, chlorhexidine, fluoride and methyl methacrylate were found to be effective in reducing the colony-forming unit counts, producing inhibition zones, reducing the optical density, reducing the metabolic activities, reducing the lactic acid and polysaccharide production and neutralizing the pH when they are added to the resin-based dental sealants. In addition, some studies showed that the antibacterial effect was not significantly different after 2 weeks, 2 months and 6 months aging in distilled water or phosphate-buffered saline. In conclusion, studies have confirmed the effectiveness of adding antibacterial agents/compounds to dental sealants.

However, very few enzymes are light-dependent, whereas macromolecules requiring ligand diffusion into an active site are ubiquitous. In this work we present a drop-on-drop sample delivery system that enables the study of enzyme-catalyzed reactions in microcrystal slurries. The system delivers ligand solutions in bursts of multiple picoliter-sized drops on top of a larger crystal-containing drop inducing turbulent mixing and transports the mixture to the X-ray interaction region with temporal resolution. We demonstrate mixing using fluorescent dyes, numerical simulations and time-resolved serial femtosecond crystallography, which show rapid ligand diffusion through microdroplets. The drop-on-drop method has the potential to be widely applicable to serial crystallography studies, particularly of enzyme reactions with small molecule substrates.","Butryn, Agata; Simon, Philipp S; Aller, Pierre; Hinchliffe, Philip; Massad, Ramzi N; Leen, Gabriel; Tooke, Catherine L; Bogacz, Isabel; Kim, In-Sik; Bhowmick, Asmit; Brewster, Aaron S; Devenish, Nicholas E; Brem, Jürgen; Kamps, Jos J A G; Lang, Pauline A; Rabe, Patrick; Axford, Danny; Beale, John H; Davy, Bradley; Ebrahim, Ali; Orlans, Julien; Storm, Selina L S; Zhou, Tiankun; Owada, Shigeki; Tanaka, Rie; Tono, Kensuke; Evans, Gwyndaf; Owen, Robin L; Houle, Frances A; Sauter, Nicholas K; Schofield, Christopher J; Spencer, James; Yachandra, Vittal K; Yano, Junko; Kern, Jan F; Orville, Allen M",Nature communications,417,28

METHODS We enrolled 1195 patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest of presumed cardiac cause from the Japan-Prediction of Neurological Outcomes in Patients Post-cardiac Arrest Registry. The primary endpoint was a good neurologic outcome (cerebral performance categories 1 or 2 [CPC1/2]) 90 days post-event. RESULTS A total of 68 patients (6%) had good neurologic outcomes. We found a mean rSO2 of 21%±13%. A receiver operating characteristic curve analysis indicated an optimal rSO2 cut-off of ≥40% for good neurologic outcomes (area under the curve 0.92, sensitivity 0.81, specificity 0.96). Good neurologic outcomes were observed in 53% (55/103) and 1% (13/1092) of patients with high (≥40%) and low (<40%) rSO2, respectively. Even without return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) upon arrival at the hospital, 30% (9/30) of patients with high rSO2 had good neurologic outcomes. Furthermore, 16 patients demonstrating ROSC upon arrival at the hospital and low rSO2 had poor neurologic outcomes. Multivariate analyses indicated that high rSO2 was independently associated with good neurologic outcomes (odds ratio=14.07, P<0.001). Patients with high rSO2 showed favourable neurologic prognoses if they had undergone therapeutic hypothermia or coronary angiography (CPC1/2, 69% [54/78]). However, 24% (25/103) of those with high rSO2 did not undergo these procedures and exhibited unfavourable neurologic prognoses (CPC1/2, 4% [1/25]).

After tumor exposure, the surgeon introduced a laparoscopic MTC instrument through a 5-mm port and the tumor margin was coagulated circumferentially. After coagulation, the tumor was resected without renal pedicle clamping. RESULTS These procedures were successfully performed without any conversions to standard laparoscopy or need for placement of additional trocars. The operative times were 183 and 160 minutes, respectively. The estimated blood loss was <150 mL in both cases. The final length of the LESS wound was 3 cm. Using the transumbilical approach, the operative scar receded into the umbilicus and was hardly visible.

METHODS We used California (CA) surveillance data to describe trends in case reporting for gonorrhea (GC), chlamydia (CT), and syphilis of any stage in the pre- versus post- COVID-19 eras (January-June 2019 and January-June 2020). We also analyzed data from an electronic survey administered by the CA STD Control Branch to local health jurisdictions (LHJs) in April, June, and September of 2020 assessing the impact of COVID-19 on STD programs. RESULTS There were sharp declines in cases of all reportable bacterial STDs occurring in conjunction with the March 19, 2020 CA stay-at-home order, most of which did not return to baseline by July. Comparing January-June 2020 to January-June of 2019, there were decreases in reported cases of CT (31%), late latent syphilis (19%), primary/secondary syphilis (15%), early non-primary non-secondary syphilis (14%), and GC (13%). The largest percentage declines in STD case reporting were among Hispanic, Asian/Pacific Islander, and Black persons. Seventy-eight percent of LHJ respondents indicated that half or more of their workforce had been redeployed to COVID-19 by September 2020. CONCLUSIONS During the COVID-19 era, STD case reporting and programmatic functions have diminished throughout CA.

Included are strategies used to address the challenges created by the pandemic, special considerations based on level-of-care capacity, the effect that the hold on elective surgeries had on staffing assignments, the reactivation process when elective surgery resumed, and the importance of keeping the perioperative team members informed and safe. It also illustrates how facing the challenges caused by the pandemic helped to solidify the merger of the two health care organizations.","Larkin, Brenda G; Mahal-van-Brenk, Cindy",AORN journal,417,12

Using computer-animated stimuli similar to the ""live"" stimuli used by Baillargeon and her colleagues (Baillargeon, 1987; Baillargeon et al., 1985), 48 8-month-old infants were habituated to 1 of 4 computer-animated events and then tested on all 4 events. The events involved a screen that rotated in either a 180° or 120° arc*** and a block that either was sitting in the path of the rotating screen or absent from the event. The results provided no evidence that infants responded on the basis of the possibility or impossibility of the events as claimed by Baillargeon and her colleagues, but instead indicated that the infants responded on the basis of perceptual novelty. These results are consistent with the findings of Schilling (this issue) and Bogartz, Shinskey, and Schilling (this issue). Taken together, along with the findings of Rivera, Wakeley, and Langer (1999), these more recent findings suggest that Baillargeon's (1987; Baillargeon et al., 1985) results should not be interpreted as definitive evidence of object permanence in very young infants.","Cashon, Cara H; Cohen, Leslie B",Infancy : the official journal of the International Society on Infant Studies,417,5

Minimally invasive tumor resection and anastomosis formation with an OrVil catheter is a novel approach to treating this disease. In this article, we present a new technique for duodenojejunal anastomosis. This technique was applied in 4 patients with benign distal duodenal tumors who were treated with minimally invasive surgery with robotic assistance. METHODS In 4 patients, after the removal of distal duodenal masses with a robotic technique, an orifice in the duodenum was opened to allow for the passage of a guidewire. The guidewire was removed from the orifice by holding it with forceps during an upper endoscopy. An OrVil catheter was sutured to the guidewire outside to allow 2 catheters to proceed consecutively. After the removal of the anvil, an end-lateral duodenojejunostomy was performed with a circular stapler. RESULTS The patients included 3 men and 1 woman (average age, 56). The durations of the operations were 215, 175, 180, and 185 minutes. No complications were observed in any of the patients during the postoperative period. The patients began oral intake on the fifth day of the postoperative period, and they were discharged on the sixth postoperative day. Histopathologic analyses indicated that the removed tumors were adenomas in 2 patients and gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) in 2 patients. Clear surgical margins were observed in all of the patients. CONCLUSION The placement of an OrVil catheter for anastomosis in benign neoplasms with distal duodenum localization and the subsequent achievement of duodenojejunal anastomosis with a circular stapler constitute a novel treatment approach.","Bedirli, Abdulkadir; Salman, Bulent; Nasirov, Mahir; Dogan, Ibrahim",JSLS : Journal of the Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons,417,25

Even in countries with weakened civil societies, the social capital of local organizations can be a fundamental communication resource. The experience of three programmes in the Mekong Region that used BCC to prevent and control outbreaks of avian influenza bore out this finding. These programmes worked with the Vietnam Women's Union to mobilize local women as conduits for education; worked with the Centre d'Etude et de Developpement Agricole Cambodgien (CEDAC), in Cambodia, to educate and train village health promoters and model farmers; and worked with the Lao Journalists Association to educate and build skills among print and broadcast journalists to enhance avian influenza coverage. Collaborating with civil society organizations can enhance communication reach, trust, and local ownership, but poses many challenges, particularly institutional capacity. Our experience, nevertheless, holds promise for a measured approach that views social capital as a set of communication resources at the community level that can be mobilized to promote complex behaviours, particularly in a rapidly changing outbreak situation.","Waisbord, S R; Michaelides, T; Rasmuson, M",Global public health,417,1

Although body image is important, the definition of this concept is inconsistent across the disciplines of nursing, medicine, and psychology. Use of a consistent definition in clinical practice and research could lead to a more comprehensive understanding of disturbances in body image, thereby advancing research-based knowledge and clinical practice. The purpose of this concept development was to advance the concept of body image as it relates to sexual health among women of reproductive age from the perspectives of 3 disciplines with a strong focus on body image: nursing, medicine, and psychology. METHODS Strategies for concept development as described by Rodgers provided the basis for this work. The process includes a search, review, and synthesis of the literature surrounding the concept of interest. RESULTS Seventy-one articles, mostly qualitative and quantitative descriptive, were included and used to develop the concept. Body image related to sexual health in women of reproductive age is a multifaceted concept that is composed of an emotional and behavioral response to one's perceived appearance, sexuality, and degree of femininity. An individual's body image is influenced by sociocultural identities, race, ethnicity, and health status. It has both physical and psychological impact on health outcomes. DISCUSSION This interprofessional and comprehensive definition of body image should enhance understanding, assessment, and management of body image disturbances, thus bridging disciplines and enhancing interprofessional research and practice.","Wilson, Christina M; McGuire, Deborah B; Rodgers, Beth L",Journal of midwifery & women's health,417,16

This study aims to investigate the clinical characteristics and outcomes of COVID-19 patients admitted at different time periods. PATIENTS AND METHODS A total of 132 discharged cases and 10 deaths of laboratory or clinically confirmed cases were retrospectively collected from The First People's Hospital of Jingzhou, Hubei. All cases were divided into two groups according to different admission times (group 1 from 2020-1-23 to 2020-2-3 and group 2 from 2020-2-4 to 2020-2-15). Individual data, clinical data, laboratory indices and prognosis were collected for the two groups, and statistical analysis was performed using the t-test or chi-square test to assess differences between the groups. RESULTS Among the 142 cases, there were 67 in the first group and 75 in the second group. According to the individual data and clinical manifestations of the two groups, the hospital stay in the first group was significantly longer than that of the second group (26 [9-39] compared with 20 [6-30], p=0.000). There were more clinical symptoms upon admission in group 1 than in group 2; although 66.2% of all patients had fever, the proportion of patients with fever on admission in the first group was significantly higher than that in the second group (79.1% compared with 54.7%, p=0.002). The proportion of patients with chills in the first group was higher than that in the second group (16.4% compared with 5.3%, p=0.032), and the proportion of patients with dyspnea was also higher than that in the second group (17.9% compared with 4%, p=0.007). Four of the 67 patients in the first group had symptoms of ocular discomfort, but none in the second group had this symptom (6.0% compared with 0, p=0.032). Based on laboratory examination, the inflammatory index of patients in the first group was higher than that in the second group, and the proportion of patients with a C-reactive protein (CRP) increase was also significantly higher (60% compared with 38.7%, p=0.020). The main difference in routine blood tests involved white blood cell and lymphocyte counts and the lymphocyte percentage. The proportion of patients with reduced white blood cell counts in the first group was higher than that in the second group (23.9% compared with 10.7% p=0.036). Moreover, more patients in the first group had a reduced lymphocyte count and percentage (71.6% compared with 30.7% p=0.000; 49.3% compared with 29.7% p=0.015, respectively), and the former was significantly lower than that in the second group (0.94 [0.24-2.42] compared with 1.365 [0.22-3.62], p=0.000). Regarding prognosis, the proportion of severe cases and mortality in the first group were slightly higher than in the second group (p>0.05). CONCLUSIONS The clinical manifestations, blood changes and outcomes differed in patients admitted at different time periods. In the second group of patients, clinical symptoms were less common than in the first group, routine blood changes and inflammatory indices were milder, and the clinical prognosis was better.","Liu, W-R; Zuo, G-J; Qin, Y",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,417,31

Resistance to different antimalarial medications continues to develop and spread, threatening effective prophylaxis and treatment. Surveillance of resistance is required to inform health policy and preserve effective antimalarial drugs; molecular methods can be used to surveil likely parasite resistances. However, there is no consensus on the most accurate molecular methods, and large variation exists in practice. The objective of this update to this systematic review is to improve and update identification of the sensitivity and specificity of each molecular method for detecting selected antimalarial drug resistance markers. METHODS We will include diagnostic accuracy studies that compare at least two of any molecular methods to examine blood samples from patients diagnosed with, or suspected of having malaria, to detect at least one selected marker of antimalarial drug resistance. We will search PubMed, EMBASE, BIOSIS, and Web of Science from 2000 to present. Two reviewers will independently screen all results, extract data, consider applicability, and evaluate the methodological quality of included studies using QUADAS-2. We will carry out a meta-analysis and use statistical methods to compare results from homogenous studies. We will use narrative to synthesise and compare results of heterogeneous studies. DISCUSSION This review will help to identify sub-optimal molecular methods for antimalarial marker detection which may be discontinued and identify more sensitive and specific methods which may be adopted. More sensitive and specific detection of drug resistance can be used to improve the breadth and accuracy of surveillance. This would enable the identification of previously undiscovered areas of antimalarial resistances and susceptibilities, improve the precision of estimates of the prevalence of resistances, and improve our ability to detect smaller changes in these patterns. Higher-quality evidence generated by more accurate and detailed surveillance can be used to inform guidelines on the use of antimalarial drugs, leading to better outcomes for more patients.

The major molecular underpinnings of the Th1/Th2 effector fate choice had been initially characterized using excellent reductionist in vitro culture systems, through which the transcription factors T-bet and GATA3 were identified as the master regulators for the differentiation of Th1 and Th2 cells, respectively. However, Th1/Th2 cell differentiation and their cellular heterogeneity are usually determined by a combinatorial expression of multiple transcription factors, particularly in vivo, where dendritic cell (DC) and innate lymphoid cell (ILC) subsets can also influence T helper lineage choices. In addition, inflammatory cytokines that are capable of inducing Th17 cell differentiation are also found to be induced during typical Th1- or Th2-related immune responses, resulting in an alternative differentiation pathway, transiting from a Th17 cell phenotype towards Th1 or Th2 cells. In this review, we will discuss the recent advances in the field, focusing on some new players in the transcriptional network, contributions of DCs and ILCs, and alternative differentiation pathways towards understanding the Th1/Th2 effector choice in vivo.","Butcher, Matthew J; Zhu, Jinfang",Faculty reviews,417,1

METHODS AND RESULTS Twenty-five patients were subjected to SPECT/MPI and CTCA within a period of 1 month without any medical treatment modification. A fusion software package was used for cardiac SPECT-CTCA image fusion. Semiquantitative analysis was performed for cardiac SPECT, CTCA and SPECT/MPI-CTCA fusion images. Patients were classified in 2 groups according to the clinical decision for further investigation (group A), or not (group B). Statistically significant differences were observed when SPECT/MPI-CTCA fusion images were used instead of cardiac SPECT alone (p<0.05). No statistically significant differences were observed comparing CTCA alone to SPECT/MPI-CTCA fusion images (p=0.25). A mid-term follow-up (mean 3.58 ± 0.24 years) showed that all patients classified in group A based on the interpretation of SPECT MPI-CTCA fused images underwent conventional coronary angiography with further necessity for PTCA or CABG whereas absence of major or minor cardiac events was revealed for all patients of group B.

This study aims to evaluate the quality of prone elAPER surgery with Permacol™ repair of the perineum. The primary end point studied was the rate of primary perineal wound healing. METHODS Data were prospectively collected for consecutive patients having prone elAPER at a single institution to assess surgical morbidity together with pathological and cancer-specific outcomes. RESULTS Between 2006 and 2012, 48 patients had prone elAPER with median age of 63 (40-86). Thirty-four patients (72.3%) received neoadjuvant treatment. Median length of stay was 9 days (6-66). With a prone approach, three patients had specimen perforation (6.4%) and seven patients had circumferential margin involvement (14.9%). Complete perineal wound healing was achieved in 34 patients (73.9%) at 4 weeks. Four patients (8.3%) were unhealed at 6 months; one patient required a perineal sinus to be laid open, and another patient required plastic surgical reconstruction.

These 2-cell-like (2C-like) cells spontaneously transit back into the pluripotent state. We previously dissected the transcriptional dynamics of the transition from pluripotency to the totipotent 2C-like state and identified factors that modulate the process. However, how 2C-like cells transit back into the pluripotent state remains largely unknown. In this study, we analyzed the transcriptional dynamics from the 2C-like state to pluripotent ESCs and identified an intermediate state. The intermediate state characterized by two-wave step up-regulation of pluripotent genes is different from the one observed during the 2C-like entry transition. Nonsense-mediated Dux mRNA decay plays an important role in the 2C-like state exit. Thus, our study not only provides a transcriptional roadmap for 2C-like-to-pluripotent state transition but also reveals a key molecular event driving the transition.","Fu, Xudong; Djekidel, Mohamed Nadhir; Zhang, Yi",Science advances,417,24

Postoperative sore throat (POST) is a frequent complication following LMA use and can be very distressing to patients. The use of an LMA cuff pressure of between 30 and 32cm of H2O in alleviating post-operative sore throat has not been investigated. Objective To compare the occurrence of POST between the intervention group in which LMA cuff pressures were adjusted to 30-32cm of H2O and the control group in which only monitoring of LMA cuff pressures was done, to compare the severity of POST between the two study groups and to compare the LMA cuff pressures between the two study groups. Methods Eighty consenting adult patients scheduled to receive general anaesthesia with use of an LMA were randomized into two groups of 40 patients each. Intervention group: LMA airway cuff pressures were adjusted to 30 to 32cm of H2O. Control group: Only had LMA cuff pressures monitored throughout the surgery. All patients were interviewed postoperatively at two, six and twelve hours. Data of their baseline characteristics, occurrence and severity of POST was collected. If POST was present; a Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) was used to assess the severity. Cuff pressures between the two study groups were also determined. Results The baseline demographic characteristics of the participants were similar. The use of manometry to limit LMA AMBU® AuraOnce™ intracuff pressure to 30-32cm H2O reduced POST in surgical patient's by 62% at 2 hours and 6 hours (Risk Ratio 0.38 95%CI 0.21-0.69)in the intervention group. The median POST pain score in the intervention group was significantly lower than the control group with scores of 0 at 2, 6 and 12 hours post operatively. Routine practice of LMA cuff inflation by anesthesiologists is variable, and the intracuff pressures in the control group were higher than in the intervention group. (P<0.001). Conclusion Among this population, reduction of LMA AMBU® AuraOnce™ intracuff pressure to 30-32cm H2O reduces the occurrence and severity of POST. The LMA cuff pressures should be measured routinely using manometry and reducing the intracuff pressures to 30-32 cm of H2O recommended as best practice.","Waruingi, David; Mung'ayi, Vitalis; Gisore, Ednah; Wanyonyi, Sikolia",African health sciences,417,30

In Italy, substantial cuts in funding have drastically reduced the resources of the National Health Service (NHS) and contributed to the expansion of the private health sector which, unlike the public health system, does not have the capacity to deal with a health emergency such as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The purpose of this article is to show how the privatization of the NHS contributed to making Italy more vulnerable and unprepared to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic. The available capacity and resources in the public and private emergency services systems in Italy are compared, including a focus on the numbers of hospital staff, hospitals, and hospital beds. The reduced funding and subsequent shortfalls in services in the NHS are reasons why extreme measures were needed to increase these resources during the COVID-19 pandemic. A public NHS in Italy would be better prepared for future health emergencies. The lessons learned from the COVID-19 pandemic can help to inform future health systems strategies, to halt the current financial decline and performance loss of national health systems, and to enable better preparation for future health emergencies.","Buzelli, Maria Luisa; Boyce, Tammy","International journal of health services : planning, administration, evaluation",417,1

Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted amongst women living in Dodoma Municipality. Data were collected using adapted questionnaires and analysed using SPPS version 23. A multivariable logistic regression model was used to assess the independent predictors of home delivery. Results A total of 425 women of childbearing age were enrolled in this study. The mean (± SD) age of the participants was 28.7 (±7.1) years. The prevalence of home delivery was 35.5% (n=150, 95% CI 30.9 - 40.2). Women with secondary school and above had 93% less odds of home delivery than women who had no education (AOR=0.0795% CI: 0.03-0.18). Women who lived in rural areas (AOR=3.49, 95% CI: 2.12-5.75), and women living more than 5km from health facilities (AOR=2.67, 95% CI: 1.65-4.37) had higher odds of home delivery. The main reasons for home delivery were transportation cost, and long distance to the nearest health facilities. Conclusion In this population, the prevalence of home delivery remained to be high. To address this more collaborative multisectoral effort like strengthening health education and strengthening maternity waiting homes are needed.","Muhunzi, Situ; Ngocho, James Samwel; Mwanamsangu, Amasha; Sanga, Leah; Hiza, Hellen; Msuya, Sia E; Mahande, Michael J",African health sciences,417,23

However, there is no report on the changes occurring when suspensions of these two drugs are combined, including the effects or potential decrease in dose following tube administration. Thus, the purpose of our study was to investigate the (i) changes caused by mixing clopidogrel bisulfate (ion form) and MgO tablets and (ii) effects on the administered clopidogrel dose after passing through a feeding tube. METHODS The molecular structure of clopidogrel generated in a mixture of clopidogrel bisulfate and a basic compound, such as sodium bicarbonate or MgO tablet, was determined by 1H-NMR after extraction and purification. The suspension of clopidogrel bisulfate tablet alone and the mixed suspension of clopidogrel bisulfate tablet and MgO tablet were passed through a feeding tube. We compared the yield of the molecular form of clopidogrel from each passed fraction. RESULTS The substance obtained from the mixture of clopidogrel bisulfate tablet and sodium bicarbonate or MgO tablet was identified as the molecular form of clopidogrel, and chemical degradation did not occur under these conditions. In the tube passage test, the yield of clopidogrel (molecular form) from the mixture of clopidogrel bisulfate and MgO tablets was lower than that from the suspension of clopidogrel bisulfate tablet alone. CONCLUSIONS The mixture of clopidogrel bisulfate and MgO tablets caused a considerable reduction in the administered dose passed through the feeding tube. Therefore, it is recommended to administer the suspensions of clopidogrel bisulfate and MgO tablets separately for safe and effective pharmacotherapy.","Aoki, Manahito; Naya, Midori; Arima, Shiho; Shinohara, Kaori; Kato, Masahiro; Shibuya, Kiyoshi; Ohtawa, Masaki; Nagamitsu, Tohru; Otori, Katsuya",Journal of pharmaceutical health care and sciences,417,30

This novel virus was discovered in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019. As of September 6, 2020, confirmed cases have risen to more than 27,000,000 worldwide and more than 885,000 people have died. Currently, no cure or standard treatment for COVID-19 exists. We conducted a prospective single-arm open-label phase II clinical trial assessing the safety and efficacy of convalescent plasma in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. METHODS Convalescent plasma with sufficient total anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG titer (1:320) obtained from recovered donors was administered to adult patients with either severe or critical COVID-19 illness. Primary outcomes were adverse events in association with plasma administration, and hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes included disease progression, recovery, length of stay, and hospital discharge. RESULTS Of the 38 patients included in the analysis, 24 (63%) recovered and were discharged, and 14 (37%) died. Patients who received convalescent plasma early in the disease course (severe illness group) as compared to the patients that received convalescent plasma later in the disease progression (critical illness group) had significantly lower hospital mortality 13% vs 55% (p < 0.02) and shorter mean hospital length of stay 15.4 vs 33 days (p < 0.01). One patient experienced a transient transfusion reaction. No other adverse effects of convalescent plasma infusion were observed. CONCLUSIONS Our results suggest that convalescent plasma with adequate anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody titer is safe and has the potential for positive impact on clinical outcomes including recovery and survival if given to patients early in the course of COVID-19 disease.

METHODS In-person surveys were conducted in waiting areas of clinics and emergency departments at a large urban safety net hospital within 1 week of the event. RESULTS Of 533 respondents, 97% were aware of the order; 34% of those who lived in affected cities or towns were potentially exposed to contaminated water. Among those who were aware, 98% took action. Respondents first received the message through word of mouth (33%), television (25%), cellular telephone calls (20%), landline calls (10%), and other modes of communication (12%). In multivariate analyses, foreign-born respondents and those who lived outside the city of Boston had a higher risk of exposure to contaminated water. New modes (eg, cellular telephones) were used more commonly by females and younger individuals (ages 18 to 34). Individuals who did not speak English at home were more likely to receive the message through their personal networks. CONCLUSIONS Given the increasing prevalence of cellular telephone use, public officials should encourage residents to register landline and cellular telephone for emergency alerts and must develop creative ways to reach immigrants and non-English-speaking groups quickly via personal networks.","Wang, C Jason; Little, Alison A; Holliman, Jaime Bruce; Ng, Chun Y; Barrero-Castillero, Alejandra; Fu, Chong Min; Zuckerman, Barry; Bauchner, Howard",Disaster medicine and public health preparedness,417,5

Existing biomarkers and clinical prediction models underestimate the risk for developing AKI. We recently reported data from two trials of 728 and 408 critically ill adult patients in whom urinary TIMP2•IGFBP7 (NephroCheck, Astute Medical) was used to identify patients at risk of developing AKI. Here we report a preplanned analysis of surgical patients from both trials to assess whether urinary tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 2 (TIMP-2) and insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 7 (IGFBP7) accurately identify surgical patients at risk of developing AKI. STUDY DESIGN We enrolled adult surgical patients at risk for AKI who were admitted to one of 39 intensive care units across Europe and North America. The primary end point was moderate-severe AKI (equivalent to KDIGO [Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes] stages 2-3) within 12 hours of enrollment. Biomarker performance was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, integrated discrimination improvement, and category-free net reclassification improvement. RESULTS A total of 375 patients were included in the final analysis of whom 35 (9%) developed moderate-severe AKI within 12 hours. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for [TIMP-2]•[IGFBP7] alone was 0.84 (95% confidence interval, 0.76-0.90; p < 0.0001). Biomarker performance was robust in sensitivity analysis across predefined subgroups (urgency and type of surgery). CONCLUSION For postoperative surgical intensive care unit patients, a single urinary TIMP2•IGFBP7 test accurately identified patients at risk for developing AKI within the ensuing 12 hours and its inclusion in clinical risk prediction models significantly enhances their performance.

Cyclic nucleotides and steroid hormones may contribute to the process of carcinogenesis or provide protection via apoptotic mechanisms. Although several pharmacologic classes of compounds influence cyclic nucleotide levels markedly, less is known about the class effects of promoters and blockers of tumourigenesis and apoptosis. This molecular modeling study uses cyclic nucleotide templates to investigate relative molecular similarity within compounds modulating tumourigenesis and apoptosis. Findings, in respect of superimposition and molecular fit of the investigated compounds, are related to their individual effects on cyclic nucleotide pharmacology. Modulators of tumourigenesis and estrogen receptor sub-type ligands relate to cyclic nucleotide structure. Estradiol and GPER ligands provide a similar pattern of fit to adenine nucleotide. Chemically diverse modulators of apoptosis, including K+ channel ligands, fit to different components of cyclic nucleotide structure. Compounds modulating Ca2+ entry and IP3 receptors relate structurally to the nucleotide dioxaphosphinin moiety. Relative molecular similarity within the structures of apoptosis and tumourigenesis modulators identifies a unifying property within chemically disparate compounds.

It is unclear if the risk of stillbirth is increased also. OBJECTIVE This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to estimate the risk of stillbirth in singleton gestations following in vitro methods of conception compared to non-in vitro conceptions. SEARCH STRATEGY A comprehensive search in PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, and Cochrane Library was undertaken from database inception to February 2021, with backward citation tracking. SELECTION CRITERIA Eligible studies included randomized controlled trials, cohort studies, or case-control studies that assessed stillbirth following in vitro fertilisation and/or intracytoplasmic sperm injection in comparison to non-in vitro methods of conception, including spontaneous conceptions, intrauterine insemination, and ovarian stimulation. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was used to assess risk of bias. A summary odds ratio (OR) for stillbirth following in vitro methods of conception compared to non-in vitro methods was calculated using a random effects model for meta-analysis. MAIN RESULTS Thirty-three cohort studies met inclusion criteria. There was an increased risk of stillbirth with in vitro methods: OR 1.41 (95% CI 1.20-1.65); however, the crude baseline risk of stillbirth was low (4.44/1000 total births). Subgroup analysis did not demonstrate an increased risk when in vitro methods were compared to conception without in vitro methods in the context of subfertility. CONCLUSIONS Compared to non-in vitro conceptions, in vitro conceptions have an increased risk of stillbirth. However, there is insufficient evidence to demonstrate whether this risk is associated with in vitro techniques or underlying subfertility.","Wong, Karen T; Carson, Kaitlyn R; Crane, Joan M G",BJOG : an international journal of obstetrics and gynaecology,417,24

Due to the non-sequential ray propagation nature of these flat combiners and the ray construction nature of a lightfield display engine, however, adapting these two technologies to each other confronts several significant challenges. In this paper, we explore the feasibility of combining an integral-imaging-based lightfield display engine with a geometrical lightguide based on microstructure mirror arrays. The image artifacts and the key challenges in a lightguide-based LF-HMD system are systematically analyzed and are further quantified via a non-sequential ray tracing simulation. We further propose to utilize polymer-dispersed liquid-crystal (PDLC) films to address the inherent problems associated with a lightguide combiner such as increasing the viewing density and improving the image coupling uniformity. We finally demonstrate, to our best knowledge, the first lightguide-based LF-HMD system that takes the advantages of both the compact form factor of a lightguide combiner and the true 3D virtual image rendering capability of a lightfield display.","Xu, Miaomiao; Hua, Hong",Optics express,417,5

While the importance of attending to PSP mental health has been established, the implementation of workplace mental health interventions is not as well understood. This scoping review describes workplace mental health interventions and their implementation in public safety organizations. METHODS English published primary studies with any publication date up to July 3, 2020 were considered. JBI methodology and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews was followed. RESULTS 89 citations met inclusion criteria out of the 62,299 found. Articles and reports found were largely published within the last decade, most frequently from Western nations, and most often applied to police, followed by firefighters. The focus of interventions was commonly stress management and resilience, and a frequent implementation strategy was multi-session group training. Comprehensive quality improvement initiatives, a focus on supervisors and managers, and interventions across primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention, were infrequent. CONCLUSION Public safety organizations are frequently reporting on stress management and resilience interventions for police and firefighters, implemented through multi-session group training. A focus across a range of PSP, including paramedics, corrections officers, and emergency dispatchers, using implementation strategies beyond group training, is suggested. This area of research is currently expanding, with many studies published within the past decade; ongoing evaluation of the quality of interventions and implementation strategies is recommended.","Edgelow, Megan; Scholefield, Emma; McPherson, Matthew; Mehta, Sonam; Ortlieb, Aquila",International archives of occupational and environmental health,417,9

Similar service-learning programmes have shown significant benefit for student participants, including: improving communication skills, developing an understanding of the social determinants of health, and increased empathy. In partnership with a local primary school, the programme involved a group of medical students designing, developing and delivering a teaching session to primary school children. METHODS Medical students completed written reflections on the programme and semi-structured interviews were conducted with teachers who had participated in the programme. These were then thematically analysed. RESULTS Themes from student reflections included: improvement in teaching and communication skills; and an increased awareness of social accountability. Themes from teacher interviews included: benefits of an aspirational figure in the school; engagement of the children; and the ongoing inspirational benefit for the pupils. DISCUSSION Our analysis suggested students and the school community benefitted. Students reported the experience was an effective way to learn teaching skills and to improve their communication with children. The programme delivered skills transferrable to other clinical contexts including leadership and behavioural management, adaptability and creative thinking. Teacher interviews suggested the programme was mutually beneficial. The framing of medical students as role models raised the possibility that such programmes may help tackle the challenge of widening participation in medicine. We would recommend medical educators to consider developing other mutually beneficial service-learning programmes.","Pilling, Rachel; Mollaney, Jenna; Chandauka, Rumbidzai; Barai, Ishani; Parekh, Ravi",The clinical teacher,417,1

The co-operation and compliance of people entering quarantine are critical to its success. However, owing to the isolating and social distancing nature of quarantine, it often leads to extreme economic hardship and shortages in basic needs such as food, medicine, water and communication - and to the curtailment of certain universal social norms such as attending a parent's funeral. To escape these hardships, people often refuse to enter voluntary quarantine, or breach quarantine rules. In these circumstances, health authorities are obliged to act in the best interests of the public and obtain court orders to force some people into quarantine. In further extreme circumstances, when a national lockdown is ordered, non-compliance with quarantine measures may result in arrests and penalties. The scope of this article is limited to the period prior to and following such a lockdown, during which quarantine may still be vital for the containment of COVID-19. Because a quarantine order will deprive an individual of his or her freedom, this must be carefully balanced with the public interest.

PARTICIPANTS Paediatric (age ≤18 years) ED visits in the 2017 NHAMCS data set. DATA ANALYSIS Each visit was coded as pain-related or non-pain-related using the 'reason for visit' variable. Weighted proportions were calculated with 95% CIs. Logistic regression was used to compare odds of pain-related visits. OUTCOME MEASURES Prevalence of pain-related visits among paediatric ED visits. RESULTS There were an estimated 35 million paediatric ED visits in the USA in 2017, 55.6% (CI 53.3% to 57.8%) were pain related, which equates to 19.7 million annual visits. The prevalence of pain-related visits reached more than 50% of visits at age 6-7 and plateaued at relatively high proportions. Children of races other than white or black had lower odds of having a pain-related visit (OR 0.48, CI 0.29 to 0.81) than white children, as did children who were black, though the difference was not statistically significant (OR 0.88, CI 0.73 to 1.06). Relative to children covered by private insurance, children with Medicaid or CHIP (Children's Health Insurance Program) coverage had lower odds of a pain-related visit (OR 0.75, CI 0.60 to 0.93). Injuries represented 46.5% (CI 42.0% to 51.0%) of pain-related visits. Pain scores were reported in less than 50% of pain-related visits. CONCLUSION Pain is the reason for visit in 55.6% of paediatric ED visits across the USA. The prevalence of pain-related visits peak before adolescence and it continues relatively high until the age 18. Injury, racial disparities in pain and poor pain score reporting should remain major topics of study in the paediatric population.","Anderson, Jana L; Oliveira J E Silva, Lucas; Funni, Shealeigh A; Bellolio, Fernanda; Jeffery, Molly Moore",BMJ open,417,32

Many nanoparticle (NP) therapies have been approved for clinical use, including as imaging agents or as platforms for drug delivery and gene therapy. However, there are remaining challenges that hinder translation, such as non-scalable production methods and the inefficiency of current NP formulations in delivering their cargo to their target. To address challenges with existing formulation methods that have batch-to-batch variability and produce particles with high dispersity, microfluidics-devices that manipulate fluids on a micrometer scale-have demonstrated enormous potential to generate reproducible NP formulations for therapeutic, diagnostic, and preventative applications. Microfluidic-generated NP formulations have been shown to have enhanced properties for biomedical applications by formulating NPs with more controlled physical properties than is possible with bulk techniques-such as size, size distribution, and loading efficiency. In this review, we highlight advances in microfluidic technologies for the formulation of NPs, with an emphasis on lipid-based NPs, polymeric NPs, and inorganic NPs. We provide a summary of microfluidic devices used for NP formulation with their advantages and respective challenges. Additionally, we provide our analysis for future outlooks in the field of NP formulation and microfluidics, with emerging topics of production scale-independent formulations through device parallelization and multi-step reactions within droplets.","Shepherd, Sarah J; Issadore, David; Mitchell, Michael J",Biomaterials,417,16

Across the tree of life, there is extensive variation in age-specific performance and changes to key life-history traits. These changes occur on a spectrum from classic senescence, where performance declines with age, to juvenescence, where performance improves with age. Reproduction, mortality, and immune function are also important factors influencing the spread of infectious disease, yet there exists no comprehensive investigation into how the aging spectrum of these traits impacts epidemics. We used a model laboratory infection system to compile an aging profile of a single organism, including traits directly linked to pathogen susceptibility and those that should indirectly alter pathogen transmission by influencing demography. We then developed generalizable epidemiological models demonstrating that different patterns of aging produce dramatically different transmission landscapes: in many cases, aging can reduce the probability of epidemics, but it can also promote severity. This work provides context and tools for use across taxa by empiricists, demographers, and epidemiologists, advancing our ability to accurately predict factors contributing to epidemics or the potential repercussions of senescence manipulation.","Clark, Jessica; McNally, Luke; Little, Tom J",The American naturalist,417,1

Here, we describe the design of a microfluidic chip and bioreactor, to enable in situ tracking and imaging of brain organoids on-chip. The low-cost 3D printed microfluidic bioreactor supports organoid growth and provides an optimal imaging chamber for live-organoid imaging, with drug delivery support. This fully isolated design of a live-cell imaging and culturing platform enables long-term live-imaging of the intact live brain organoids as it grows.

The aim of the study was to present outcomes of three of those methods: removal of the clips, clipping of T6-9, and regional abdomino-lumbar iontophoresis (RALI). METHODS Out of the group of 229 patients treated with ETS, there were 9 that requested removal of the clips, 3 were treated with T6-9 video thoracoscopic block, and 5 were treated with RALI. The intensity of the side effect has been evaluated subjectively (with overall and localized perception of intensity of sweating) and objectively (with gravimetry). RESULTS The removal of the clips resulted in slow (about 12 months) diminishing of the intensity of sweating of the trunk; but the symptom did not disappear to the degree satisfactory for the patients. The T6-9 block resulted in partial and transient diminishing of the symptom. The iontophoresis resulted in very promising short-term results. CONCLUSION Removal of the clips from the sympathetic trunk does not provide resolution of compensatory sweating in 1 year of observation. T6-9 block does not provide remedy for compensatory hyperhidrosis. Regional abdomino-lumbar iontophoresis seems to be very promising, but further research and followup are mandatory.","Stefaniak, Tomasz; Cwigon, Marta; Łaski, Dariusz",TheScientificWorldJournal,417,26

METHODS This study was exempted from review by institutional review board waiver. A flexible fiberoptic endoscopy was placed through stellate openings in the standard face shield and the enhanced face shield. A series of simulated coughs were created with bursts of fluorescein dye through an atomizer tip placed within the test participant's mouth. Ultraviolet lighting illuminated the test area, and areas of dye splatter were noted. RESULTS Fluorescein dye is easily aerosolized along the lateral inferior aspect of a standard shield with significant contamination of the surrounds. The enhanced face shield maintained a barrier to the aerosolized dye. DISCUSSION Face shields, rather than face masks, should be considered a preferred alternative for the public and for health care professionals alike, as they address many of the personal protective equipment concerns especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. Otolaryngologists are at high risk from aerosol-generating procedures, such as flexible fiberoptic endoscopy, even when wearing personal protective equipment. Here we describe a uniquely designed face shield to be worn by the patient as another layer of protection for the environment and for medical personnel. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE During the course of a flexible fiberoptic endoscopy, medical personnel are safely isolated from potential infectious particles with a newly designed face shield.","Anon, Jack B; Denne, Carter; Rees, Darcy",Otolaryngology--head and neck surgery : official journal of American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery,417,33

No association between brachial BP variables and mortality was shown for the total sample in quartiles analysis; however, MAP in the highest quartile, compared with the second, was associated with mortality (hazard ratio, 1.85; 95% confidence intervals, 1.09-3.12) among cognitively impaired individuals. The fractional-polynomials approach for BP confirmed this finding and further showed, solely in the MMSE <24 subcohort, U-shaped trends of MAP and systolic BP, with increased mortality risk in extremely low or high values; no such pattern was evident for patients with MMSE ≥24.

However, the quality of available evidence is generally low, and regulatory frameworks have focused on apps with medical purposes only, overlooking apps with significant interactions with patients that may require stronger oversight.Areas covered: To support this expanded evidence generation process, we identified the reasons that distinguish mHealth apps compared to medical devices at large and that should differentially feature their assessment. mHealth apps are characterized by the iterative nature of the corresponding interventions, frequent user interactions with a non-linear relationship between technology usage, engagement and outcomes, significant organizational implications, as well as challenges associated with genericization, their broad diagnostic potential, and price setting.Expert Opinion: The renewed reliance experienced during the pandemic and the unprecedented injection of resources through recovery instruments can further boost the development of apps. Only robust evidence of the benefits of mHealth apps will persuade health-care professionals and beneficiaries to systematically deploy them. Regulatory bodies will need to question their current approaches by adopting comprehensive evaluation processes that adequately consider the specific features of mHealth apps.","Tarricone, Rosanna; Petracca, Francesco; Ciani, Oriana; Cucciniello, Maria",Expert review of pharmacoeconomics & outcomes research,417,14

The impact of hypoxia on NVC remains poorly characterized. NVC is partially modulated by nitric oxide (NO), which may initially decrease in hypoxia. This study investigated the effect of acute NO-donor (nitrate) supplementation on NVC and cognitive function in hypoxia. Twenty healthy men participated in this randomized, double-blind, crossover design study. Following normoxic cognitive/NVC testing, participants consumed either nitrate (NIT) or a NIT-depleted placebo (PLA). Participants then underwent 120 min of hypoxia (11.6% ± 0.1% O2) and all cognitive/NVC testing was repeated. NVC was assessed as change in middle cerebral artery (MCA) blood flow during a cognitive task (incongruent Stroop) using transcranial Doppler. Additional computerized cognitive testing was conducted separately to assess memory, executive function, attention, sensorimotor, and social cognition domains. Salivary nitrite significantly increased following supplementation in hypoxia for NIT (+2.6 ± 1.0 arbitrary units (AU)) compared with PLA (+0.2 ± 0.3 AU; p < 0.05). Memory performance (-6 ± 13 correct) significantly decreased (p < 0.05) in hypoxia while all other cognitive domains were unchanged in hypoxia for both PLA and NIT conditions (p > 0.05). MCA flow increased during Stroop similarly in normoxia (PLA +5 ± 6 cm·s(-1), NIT +7 ± 7 cm·s(-1)) and hypoxia (PLA +5 ± 9 cm·s(-1), NIT +6 ± 7 cm·s(-1)) (p < 0.05) and this increase was not altered by PLA or NIT (p > 0.05). In conclusion, acute hypoxia resulted in significant reductions in memory concomitant with preservation of executive function, attention, and sensorimotor function. Hypoxia had no effect on NVC. Acute NIT supplementation had no effect on NVC or cognitive performance in hypoxia.","Lefferts, Wesley K; Hughes, William E; White, Corey N; Brutsaert, Tom D; Heffernan, Kevin S","Applied physiology, nutrition, and metabolism = Physiologie appliquee, nutrition et metabolisme",417,19

METHODS We examined 1151 infants with a gestational age of 36 weeks or greater. We assessed for the presence of ventricular enlargement when apparent space was observed in the frontal horn or body of lateral ventricle by a transfontanel ultrasound scan. RESULTS Two hundred and forty-eight infants had ventricular enlargement. The atrial widths in most infants were less than 10 mm. Ventricular enlargement correlated with Cesarean delivery, gestational age, birth weight, respiratory disturbance at delivery and respiratory inhibition after crying (RIAC). Ventricular enlargement could be divided into three types by ultrasound findings. Forty-five infants showed only enlargement of the anterior horn (Type A), 97 infants showed enlargement from the body to the posterior horn (Type B), and 108 infants showed whole enlargement from the anterior to the posterior horn (Type C). The infants with Type A correlated with intrauterine growth restriction, placenta previa, male gender and birth weight. The infants with Type B correlated with cesarean delivery. The infants with Type C correlated with diabetes mellitus, respiratory disturbance at delivery, RIAC and feeding hypoxemia.

This genus includes emerging and economically significant viruses such as those associated with Tomato Yellow Leaf Curl Disease, for which diagnostic tools are needed to prevent dispersion and new introductions. Five real-time PCRs with an internal tomato reporter gene were developed for accurate detection and quantification of monopartite begomoviruses, including two strains of the Tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV; Mld and IL strains), the Tomato leaf curl Comoros virus-like viruses (ToLCKMV-like viruses) and the two molecules of the bipartite Potato yellow mosaic virus. These diagnostic tools have a unique standard quantification, comprising the targeted viral and internal report amplicons. These duplex real-time PCRs were applied to artificially inoculated plants to monitor and compare their viral development. RESULTS Real-time PCRs were optimized for accurate detection and quantification over a range of 2 × 10(9) to 2 × 10(3) copies of genomic viral DNA/μL for TYLCV-Mld, TYLCV-IL and PYMV-B and 2 × 10(8) to 2 × 10(3) copies of genomic viral DNA/μL for PYMV-A and ToLCKMV-like viruses. These real-time PCRs were applied to artificially inoculated plants and viral loads were compared at 10, 20 and 30 days post-inoculation. Different patterns of viral accumulation were observed between the bipartite and the monopartite begomoviruses. Interestingly, PYMV accumulated more viral DNA at each date for both genomic components compared to all the monopartite viruses. Also, PYMV reached its highest viral load at 10 dpi contrary to the other viruses (20 dpi). The accumulation kinetics of the two strains of emergent TYLCV differed from the ToLCKMV-like viruses in the higher quantities of viral DNA produced in the early phase of the infection and in the shorter time to reach this peak viral load. CONCLUSIONS To detect and quantify a wide range of begomoviruses, five duplex real-time PCRs were developed in association with a novel strategy for the quantification standard. These assays should be of a great interest for breeding programs and epidemiological surveys to monitor viral populations.","Péréfarres, Frédéric; Hoareau, Murielle; Chiroleu, Frédéric; Reynaud, Bernard; Dintinger, Jacques; Lett, Jean-Michel",Virology journal,417,1

Standardized variables were prospectively collected, and standardized care were provided to all patients. RESULTS 186 patients were included (mean 85.3±5.78 y). The all cause 30-day mortality was 30% (56/186). At admission, dead patients were more dyspneic (57% vs 38%, p=0.014), had more often an oxygen saturation <94% (70% vs 47%, p<0.01) and had more often a heart rate faster than 90/min (70% vs 42%, p<0.001). Mortality increased in parallel with CFS score (p=0.051) (20 deaths (36%) in 7-9 category). In multivariate analysis, CFS score (OR= 1.49 CI (95%), 1.01-2.19, p=0.046), age (OR=1.15 CI 95% 1.01-1.31 p=0.034), and dyspnea (OR=5.37 CI 95% 1.33-21.68, p=0.018) were associated with all-cause 30-day mortality.

Operational data regarding clinic volume, referral patterns, and scheduling efficiency were assessed over a 9-month period in 2018 prior to implementation of electronic consultation. The same data were collected for the 9-month period immediately following implementation of electronic consultation in 2019. RESULTS During the pre-implementation (pre-EC) period, 3,243 otolaryngology referrals were made as compared to 4,249 post-implementation (post-EC). 86% of referrals were scheduled for a clinic appointment pre-EC, compared to 61% post-EC (P < .00001) 24.5% of patients were evaluated within 30 days pre-EC compared to 53.6% post-EC (P < .00001). The average time to be seen by an otolaryngology provider declined from 60.8 days pre-EC to 42.8 days post-EC (P = .0029). There was a 50% decline in the percentage of appointments canceled by patients in the post-EC period as compared to pre-EC. CONCLUSIONS In our experience, implementation of electronic consultation significantly reduced both wait times for a clinic appointment and the percentage of no-show or canceled appointments. Electronic consultation may be a valuable tool in improving the efficiency and yield of the modern otolaryngology clinic.

METHODS We performed a retrospective analysis of hospitalised patients that had a positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test for SARS-CoV-2 and received hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin (HCQ/Az) or no targeted therapy. The primary end point was clinical improvement on day 7 defined as either hospital discharge or an improvement of two points on a six-category ordinal scale. Secondary outcomes included mortality at day 28, intensive care (ICU) admission, requirement for mechanical ventilation and incidence of adverse events (AEs). RESULTS Data from a total of 134 patients was evaluated, 82 patients received HCQ/Az and 52 patients received no targeted therapy. Clinical improvement was seen in 26.8% of patients who received HCQ/Az but this was not significant. The rates of ICU transfer and mechanical ventilation were higher in the treatment group, these differences were not significant. Mortality at day 28 was significantly higher in the treatment group (p 0.03). Hypoglycaemia elevated liver function tests (LFTs) and QT prolongation were monitored in both groups. The risk of QT prolongation was significantly higher in the treatment group. Treatment was stopped early in 6 (7.3%) patients due AEs. CONCLUSION Although patients who received HCQ/Az were more severely ill the administration of these repurposed drugs did not result in clinical improvement, and was associated with a significant increase in toxicity. This descriptive study highlights the importance of monitoring all repurposed agents for adverse events.","Kelly, Mary; O'Connor, Ròisìn; Townsend, Liam; Coghlan, Miriam; Relihan, Eileen; Moriarty, Miriam; Carr, Bernard; Melanophy, Gail; Doyle, Caitriona; Bannan, Ciaran; O'Riordan, Ruth; Merry, Concepta; Clarke, Susie; Bergin, Colm",British journal of clinical pharmacology,417,1

The developed detection–identification theory generalizes the changepoint detection theory developed by Tartakovsky (2019) to the case of multiple composite post-change hypotheses when one has not only to detect a change as quickly as possible but also to identify (or isolate) the true post-change distribution. We propose a multi-hypothesis change detection–identification rule and show that it is nearly optimal, minimizing moments of the delay to detection as the probability of a false alarm and the probabilities of misidentification go to zero.

Design/methodology/approach This study combined constructs drawn from the E-S-QUAL and BSQ models to measure the impact of digital banking services on subscribers of digital banking services in Ghana. The study utilized structural equation modeling with partial least squares (PLS-SEM) to analyze 395 responses. Findings Results revealed a significant direct effect between digital banking services satisfaction and customer retention decision. The results also revealed that digital banking services quality dimensions such as ease of use, efficiency, privacy/security and reliability impact customers' satisfaction and retention intentions. Research limitations/implications Digital banking service portfolios and their quality dimensions vary among banks. This offers an opportunity for banking institutions and other non-bank financial service providers to be wary of the impact of quality service delivery on customers' decisions. This paper makes significant theoretical contributions and practical implications on the relevance of quality digital banking services in customers' retention strategies for competitive advantage. Originality/value This study has underlined the significance of quality digital banking services in developing countries.

Building on insights from distinct theoretical traditions, in this introductory contribution to the special issue in Feminist Global Political Economies of Work we propose social reproduction as a prism to examine labour and work in the Global South from a feminist standpoint. We develop a social reproduction-centred methodology to the study of labour processes and relations, based on combined insights from Feminist IPE (FIPE), Feminist Economics (FE), and Feminist Political Economy of Development (FPED). Insights from these three disciplinary frontiers of feminist work are well-equipped to analyse the complexities of labouring in the Global South and how reproductive dynamics co-constitute the 'everyday' in the global economy in manifold ways. These include relations with the state and ('crisis' of) care provisions;the blending of productive and reproductive temporalities of work across labour processes;the continuum of paid/unpaid work within and beyond the household;and novel global processes of commodification of life and the everyday. In setting the contours of this ambitious agenda, we reflects on the complexity of feminist research methods;on positionality and ethics.","Mezzadri, A.; Newman, S.; Stevano, S.",Review of International Political Economy,417,20

Characterizing the frequency and drivers of vaccine breakthrough is necessary to inform COVID-19 control efforts. Methods We performed a retrospective cohort study of vaccine breakthrough infections in fully vaccinated persons in Veterans Health Administration. We applied Cox proportional hazard models to estimate cumulative incidence, assess differences in outcomes by vaccine, and identify associations with individual characteristics as well as time-dependent geographic variation in COVID-19 incidence, proportion of delta variant, and vaccine coverage. Results Among 3,032,561 fully vaccinated persons, documented SARS-CoV-2 infection occurred in 11,197 (0.37%) and COVID-19 hospitalization occurred in 2,080 (0.07%). Compared to Ad26.COV2.S, BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 had lower occurrence of documented SARS-CoV-2 infection (aHR 0.54, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.51-0.58; aHR 0.36; 95% CI 0.33-0.38; respectively ) and COVID-19 hospitalization (aHR 0.56, 95% CI 0.47-0.66; aHR 0.30; 0.25-0.35; respectively). Documented SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 hospitalization were associated with younger age, Hispanic or Latino ethnicity, number of comorbidities, and previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. Regional proportion of delta variant and county-level COVID-19 incidence were predictors of vaccine breakthrough events; county-level vaccine coverage was inversely associated. Conclusions Vaccine breakthrough was rare among fully vaccinated persons. mRNA-1273 and BNT162b2 were more protective against documented SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 hospitalization compared to Ad26.COV2.S. Efforts to limit COVID-19 transmission and bolster vaccine coverage would also curtail vaccine breakthrough.","Sharma, A.; Oda, G.; Holodniy, M.",,417,1

We conducted a meta-knowledge analysis of articles published between 2001 to 2020 in this growing field of academic scholarship. We found a total of 830 articles authored by 3025 authors, mostly from high-income countries. Publications on syndemics are gradually increasing since 2003, with rapid development in 2013. Each article was cited more than 15 times on average, whereas most (n = 604) articles were original studies. Syndemics research focused on several areas, including HIV/AIDS, substance abuse, mental health, gender minority stressors, racism, violence, chronic physical and mental disorders, food insecurity, social determinants of health, and COVID-19. Moreover, biopsychosocial interactions between multiple health problems were studied across medical, anthropological, public health, and other disciplines of science. The limited yet rapidly evolving literature on syndemics informs transdisciplinary interests to understand complex coexisting health challenges in the context of systematic exclusion and structural violence in vulnerable populations. The findings also suggest applications of syndemic theory to evaluate clinical and public health problems, examine the socioecological dynamics of factors influencing health and wellbeing, and use the insights to alleviate health inequities in the intersections of synergistic epidemics and persistent contextual challenges for population health.","Hossain, M.

They may optimise resources and increase accessibility, facilitating larger-scale training with a similar educational benefit. We aim to evaluate the efficacy of virtual BSS classroom training compared to both non-interactive video and face-to-face teaching Method: 72 medical students will be randomly assigned to three equal intervention groups based on surgical skills experience and confidence Interventions will be implemented following an instructional video Group A will practice independently, Group B will receive face-to-face training, and Group C will attend a virtual classroom. Participants will be recorded placing three interrupted sutures with hand tied knots preand post-intervention. Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skills (OSATS) will be blind marked by two experts Result: Change in confidence, time to completion and a novel granular performance score will also be measured. Each intervention's feasibility and accessibility will be assessed.

One of the major usages of such data is travel time prediction, a typical service provided by GPS navigation devices and apps. Meanwhile, the constant collection and analysis of the individual location data also pose unprecedented privacy threats. We leverage the notion of geo-indistinguishability, an extension of differential privacy to the location privacy setting, and propose a procedure for privacy-preserving travel time prediction without collecting actual individual GPS trace data. We propose new concepts to examine the impact of geo-indistinguishability-based sanitization on the usefulness of GPS traces and provide analytical and experimental utility analysis for privacy-preserving travel time prediction. We also propose new metrics to measure the adversary error in learning individual GPS traces from the collected sanitized data.

The virtual environment imposes a limited field of view, creating a natural trade-off between allocating visual attention towards individual search or to look towards peers for social imitation. By analyzing foraging patterns, social interactions (visual and spatial), and social influence, we shine new light on how groups collectively adapt to the fluctuating demands of the environment through specialization and selective imitation, rather than homogeneity and indiscriminate copying of others.","Wu, Charley M.; Ho, Mark K.; Kahl, Benjamin; Leuker, Christina; Meder, Björn; Kurvers, Ralf H.J.M.",bioRxiv,417,16

However, inhaled aerosol delivery of Ad-vectored vaccines has remained poorly characterized and its ability to induce respiratory mucosal immunity in humans is still unknown. The goal of our study was to evaluate and compare the safety and immunogenicity of a human serotype 5 Ad-based tuberculosis (TB) vaccine (AdHu5Ag85A) delivered to healthy humans via inhaled aerosol or intramuscular injection. Methods: In this open-labeled phase 1b trial, 31 healthy adults between 18 and 55 years of age with a history of BCG vaccination were enrolled at McMaster University Medical Centre, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. AdHu5Ag85A was administered by a single-dose aerosol using the Aeroneb Solo Vibrating Mesh Nebulizer or by intramuscular (IM) injection; 11 in the low dose (LD, 1x10e6 PFU) aerosol group, 11 in the high dose (HD, 2x10e6 PFU) aerosol group and 9 in the IM (1x10e8 PFU) group. The primary outcome was safety of a single administration of vaccine delivered to the respiratory tract by aerosol or by IM injection. The vaccine-related local and systemic adverse events were collected from participants from a self-completed diary for 14 days after vaccination and at scheduled follow-up visits. Routine laboratory biochemical and haematological tests were measured at 2, 4 and 12 weeks after vaccination and lung function was measured at 2, 4, 8 and 12 weeks after vaccination. The secondary outcome was comparison of immunogenicity among the different routes and aerosol dose groups. Immunogenicity to aerosol or IM vaccination was measured both in the peripheral blood and bronchoalveolar lavage samples by Luminex, and cell surface and intracellular cytokine immunostaining. Anti-AdHu5 antibodies and neutralization titers were determined before and after vaccination using ELISA and bioassay, respectively. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrial.gov, NCT02337270. Results: The aerosol droplets generated by Aeroneb Solo Nebulizer were mostly <5.39 micrometer in size, suitable for efficient Ad-vectored vaccine deposition to major human airways. Both LD and HD of AdHu5Ag85A administered by aerosol inhalation and the intramuscular injection were safe and well-tolerated. Respiratory adverse events were infrequent, mild, transient and similar among groups. IM injection was associated with a mild local injection site reaction in two participants. Systemic adverse events were also infrequent, mild, transient and similar among all groups. There were no grade 3 or 4 adverse events reported nor any serious adverse events. Both aerosol doses, particularly LD, but not IM, vaccination markedly induced Ag85A-specific airway tissue-resident memory CD4 and CD8 T cells of polyfunctionality. While as expected, IM vaccination induced Ag85A-specific T cell responses in the blood, the LD aerosol vaccination also elicited such T cells in the blood. Furthermore, the LD aerosol vaccination induced persisting transcriptional changes in alveolar macrophages indicative of trained innate immunity. Interpretation: Inhaled aerosol delivery of Ad-vectored vaccine is a safe, economical and superior way to elicit respiratory mucosal immunity. The results of this study encourage further development of aerosol vaccine strategies against not only TB but also other respiratory pathogens including COVID-19.","Jeyanathan, M.; Fritz, D.

For these reasons it represents the prime target for Covid-19 vaccines. In recent months, variants of this protein have started to emerge. Their ability to reduce or evade recognition by S-targeting antibodies poses a threat to immunological treatments and raises concerns for their consequences on vaccine efficacy. To develop a model able to predict the potential impact of S-protein mutations on antibody binding sites, we performed unbiased multi-microsecond molecular dynamics of several glycosylated S-protein variants and applied a straightforward structure-dynamics-energy based strategy to predict potential changes in immunogenic regions on each variant. We recover known epitopes on the reference D614G sequence. By comparing our results, obtained on isolated S-proteins in solution, to recently published data on antibody binding and reactivity in new S variants, we directly show that modifications in the S-protein consistently translate into the loss of potentially immunoreactive regions. Our findings can thus be qualitatively reconnected to the experimentally characterized decreased ability of some of the Abs elicited against the dominant S-sequence to recognize variants. While based on the study of SARS-CoV-2 Spike variants, our computational epitope-prediction strategy is portable and could be applied to study immunoreactivity in mutants of proteins of interest whose structures have been characterized, helping the development/selection of vaccines and antibodies able to control emerging variants.","Triveri, Alice; Serapian, Stefano A.; Marchetti, Filippo; Doria, Filippo; Pavoni, Silvia; Cinquini, Fabrizio; Moroni, Elisabetta; Rasola, Andrea; Frigerio, Francesco; Colombo, Giorgio",bioRxiv,417,11

Due to their underlying disease as well as therapeutic immunosuppression these patients may be at higher risk of being more severely affected by SARS-CoV2. Furthermore, SARS-CoV2 infection might trigger a flare of the underlying disease. Objectives: To evaluate clinical characteristics and disease course of COVID-19 in children and adolescents with RMD and to analyze possible effects of SARSCoV2 infection on the underlying disease under different therapeutic regimens. Methods: Data from juvenile patients with RMD recorded via the SARS-CoV2 questionnaire within the National Pediatric Rheumatology Database and the registry for hospitalized children and adolescents with COVID-19 of the German Society for Pediatric Infectious Diseases were analyzed. In addition to age, sex and diagnosis, information was collected about the date and method of a positive SARS-CoV2 testing, reason for testing, on clinical manifestations, disease course, treatment and outcome of COVID-19, on drug therapy at the time of virus detection, on disease activity (NRS 0 -10, 0 = best) of the underlying disease at the last visit before and after the SARS-CoV2 infection. Results: From April 17th 2020 until January 25th 2021, data of 67 patients with RMD and confirmed SARS-CoV2 infection were collected. Mean age was 13.5 ± 3.9 years with equal sex distribution. The majority of patients were diagnosed with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA, 64%), 12 (18%) patients had an autoinflammatory disease (FMF, CAPS, PFAPA, TRAPS) and 5 (7%) a connective tissue disease. Fifty-two patients (78%) were treated with a disease modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD), 39% with a biological DMARD and 9% systemic glucocorticoids at the time of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Nineteen patients (28%) were tested for SARS-CoV-2 because of typical symptoms, the majority (67%) because of contact to an infected person. PCR was used most often (in 60 %). 52 patients (78%) developed symptoms of COVID-19, 15 patients remained asymptomatic. The most common symptom of COVID-19 was rhinitis (42%) and fever (38%), followed by fatigue (34%), taste/smell disorder (33%), sore throat (27%) and cough (23%). Disease severity was graded as mild in 44 of 52 (85%) symptomatic patients, only two patients were hospitalized, one of whom required intensive care and died of cardiorespiratory failure 3 days after symptom onset. In 22 of 26 (85%) SARS-CoV2-positive patients, no relevant increase in disease activity (difference in NRS ≤ 1 before/after infection) of the underlying disease was observed 31 days after symptom onset (median, IQR 17-52 days). One patient, who had paused tocilizumab for 2 doses, experienced a flare of his seronegative polyarthritis 2 months after asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection. Conclusion: In our cohort, the clinical picture of COVID-19 in children and adolescents with RMD was similar to that of healthy peers. The majority of patients showed mild disease course with good outcome under various medications, however, one patient with a severe course of COVID-19 died. In addition, SARSCoV2 infection does not appear to have a relevant impact on the underlying disease activity, whereas discontinuation of therapy might pose a risk of flare.","Sengler, C.; Eulert, S.; Niewerth, M.; Kallinich, T.; Wittkowski, H.; Girschick, H.; Haas, J.

We show that metallicity gradients depend on four ratios that collectively describe the metal equilibration timescale, production, transport, consumption, and loss. Our model finds that most galaxy metallicity gradients are in equilibrium at all redshifts. When normalized by metal diffusion, metallicity gradients are governed by the competition between radial advection, metal production, and accretion of metal-poor gas from the cosmic web. The model naturally explains the varying gradients measured in local spirals, local dwarfs, and high-redshift star-forming galaxies. We use the model to study the cosmic evolution of gradients across redshift, showing that the gradient in Milky Way-like galaxies has steepened over time, in good agreement with both observations and simulations. We also predict the evolution of metallicity gradients with redshift in galaxy samples constructed using both matched stellar masses and matched abundances. Our model shows that massive galaxies transition from the advection-dominated to the accretion-dominated regime from high to low redshifts, which mirrors the transition from gravity-driven to star formation feedback-driven turbulence. Lastly, we show that gradients in local ultraluminous infrared galaxies (major mergers) and inverted gradients seen both in the local and high-redshift galaxies may not be in equilibrium. In subsequent papers in this series, we show that the model also explains the observed relationship between galaxy mass and metallicity gradients, and between metallicity gradients and galaxy kinematics.","Sharda, Piyush; Krumholz, Mark R.; Wisnioski, Emily; Forbes, John C.; Federrath, Christoph; Acharyya, Ayan",,417,26

Materials and Methods: Retrospective observational multi-centered cohort study. Results: In total, 151 patients (mean age 61±17 years, 66% male) with COVID-19 pneumonia were included: 68 patients received combination therapy, i.e., Lpv/r in addition to HQ, and 83 patients received only HQ. The patients in both groups were similar regarding the majority of baseline variables except for white blood cell count, procalcitonin, lactate dehydrogenase levels, intensive care unit (ICU) admission rates, which were significantly higher, and decreased oxygen saturation in the combination group. The mean duration of symptoms and hospital stay were 5.6±2.3 days and 12.7±9.4 days, respectively. Nearly 43% (n=65) of patients were admitted to the ICU. Patients in the HQ monotherapy group had a shorter stay in hospital than those in the combination group (10 vs. 16 days, p<0.005). The primary end points were 14- and 28-day mortality.

For the first time, Higher Education went completely online. The authors of this research conducted an online voluntary survey where Greek students could answer questions about the distance education, they had experienced during the Covid-19 lockdown, particularly of the synchronous type. The purpose of this research was to investigate the major issues that created impediments to the students, both the technical barriers that made it difficult to communicate, and the teaching/learning challenges raised because of emerging trends. Recognizing the main problems that arose in the educational process during the lockdown period leads to a better communication in the future in the field of distance education. The students were informed about the research by the Student Counseling Center of their universities but also via posts on well-known student content websites. The research results have shown that most students attended synchronous communication online classes (the theoretical and the practical ones) in replacement of their face-to-face lessons. The students pointed out some negative aspects of online education concerning synchronous communication educational practices, but also how their classes were organized and presented. They referred to the main technical difficulties that occurred-on the part of the teacher-preventing a satisfactory communication, as to the practices that stressed them or to the lack of communication between students and teachers they experienced during the lockdown. Nevertheless, despite these problems, most students are interested in continuing online learning in combination with traditional courses in a classroom. Overall, this study provided important, additional information in respect of the students’ perceptions towards online education during the first quarantine. © ACPIL.","Giannoulas, A.; Stampoltzis, A.; Kounenou, K.; Kalamatianos, A.",Electronic Journal of e-Learning,417,1

However, a growing body of evidence suggests leakage may not always be fraudulent or corrupt, with researchers suggesting medical practitioners may sometimes struggle to understand increasingly complex legal requirements around health financing and billing transactions, which may be improved through education. To explore this phenomenon further, we undertook a systematic review of the literature to identify the medical billing education needs of medical practitioners and whether those needs are being met. Methods: Eligible records included English language materials published between 1 January 2000 and 4 May 2020, including empirical research, commentary, opinions and grey literature. Results: We identified 74 records as directly relevant to the search criteria. Despite a comprehensive international search, studies were limited to three countries (Australia, Canada, U.S), indicating a need for further work internationally. The literature suggests the education needs of medical practitioners in relation to medical billing compliance are not being met and medical practitioners desire more education on this topic. Evidence suggests education may be effective in improving medical billing compliance and reducing waste in health systems and there is broad agreement amongst medical education stakeholders in multiple jurisdictions that medical billing should be viewed as a core competency of medical education, though there is an apparent inertia to act. Penalties for non-compliant medical billing are serious and medical practitioners are at risk of random audits and investigations for breaches of sometimes incomprehensible, and highly interpretive regulations they may never have been taught. Conclusion: Despite acknowledged significance of leakage in health systems due to poor practitioner knowledge of billing practices, there has been very little research to date on education interventions to improve health system efficiency at a practitioner level.","Faux, M.; Adams, J.; Wardle, J.",,417,1

Water utilities need to understand these demand shifts to respond to potential operational and water-quality issues. Aided by a fixed-effects model of citywide water demand in Austin, Texas, we explore the impacts of various SDPs (e.g., time after the stay home-work safe order, reopening phases) using daily demand data gathered between 2013 and 2020. Our approach uses socio-technical determinants (e.g., climate, water conservation policy) with SDPs to model water demand, while accounting for spatial and temporal effects (e.g., geographic variations, weekday patterns). Results indicate shifts in behavior of residential and nonresidential demands that offset the change at the system scale, demonstrating a spatial redistribution of water demand after the stay home-work safe order. Our results show that some phases of Texas's reopening phases had statistically significant relationships to water demand. While this yielded only marginal net effects on overall demand, it underscores behavioral changes in demand at sub-system spatial scales. Our discussions shed light on SDPs' impacts on water demand. Equipped with our empirical findings, utilities can respond to potential vulnerabilities in their systems, such as water-quality problems that may be related to changes in water pressure in response to demand variations.","Bakchan, Amal; Roy, Arkajyoti; Faust, Kasey M.",,417,1

Transmission of the virus is difficult to control in these settings because of a combination of factors including environmental conditions and the specific nature of the work. This paper describes a retrospective outbreak investigation in a meat processing plant, a description of the measures taken to prevent or contain further outbreaks, and insights on how those with specific knowledge of the working environment of these plants can collaborate with public health authorities to ensure optimal outbreak control. The plant experienced 111 confirmed positive asymptomatic cases in total with an estimated attack rate of 38% during a five-week period. Four weeks after the first case, mass screening of all workers was conducted by the public health authorities. Thirty-two workers tested positive, of which 16 (50%) worked in one particular area of the plant, the boning hall (n=60). The research team prepared and carried out semi-structured interviews with the plant personnel who were charged with COVID control within the plant. They carried out assessments of operational risk factors and also undertook air quality monitoring in the boning hall and abattoir. The air quality measurements in the boning hall showed a gradual build-up of carbon dioxide and aerosol particles over the course of a work shift, confirming that this poorly ventilated area of the plant had an environment that was highly favourable for aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Assessment of operational conditions incorporated visual surveys of the plant during the working day. Prior to and during the first two weeks of the outbreak, multiple measures were introduced into the plant by management, including physical distancing, provision of educational material to workers, visitor restrictions, and environmental monitoring. After the implementation of these measures and their progressive refinement by plant management, the factory has not had any further linked cases (clusters) or outbreaks to date. The tailored approach to risk mitigation adopted in this meat processing plant shows that generic risk mitigation measures, as recommended by public health authorities, can be successfully adapted and optimized by designated plant emergency response teams.","Walshe, N.; Fennelly, M.; Hellebust, S.; Wenger, J.; Sodeau, J.; Prentice, M.; Grice, C.; Jordan, V.; Comerford, J.; Downey, V.; Perrotta, C.; Mulcahy, G.; Sammin, D.",,417,25

Various finite element analysis (FEA) software packages are used to perform structural analyses such as predicting the flow of strain or strain fields in a microstructure. Engineers frequently operate these software packages to evaluate mechanical behavior and predict failure. Even though these FEA software packages provide highly accurate analyses, they are computationally intensive, taking a significant amount of time to produce a solution. The time required by the FEA software packages to achieve accurate results largely depends on microstructure details and mesh resolution, thus providing a trade-off between fidelity and computation time. This research proposes the use of Deep Learning algorithms to achieve a significant reduction in the time required to predict high-accuracy strain fields in a two-dimensional microstructure with defects. This work presents a foundation for developing deep neural networks to conduct structural analyses, thus reducing the exclusive use of computationally demanding FEA software and augmenting the analytical capabilities of scientists and engineers.","Khanolkar, Pranav Milind; Abraham, Aaron; McComb, Christopher; Basu, Saurabh",Procedia Manufacturing,417,1

Polarization was confirmed by surface marker expression using flow cytometry. As a comparison, monocytes were also isolated from septic patients (n=3) and analyzed for polarization markers. The effect of AA on monocyte polarization was evaluated. As a functional assay, AA-treated monocytes were analyzed for cytokine production of TNF and IL-8 by intracellular staining and flow cytometry following activation with LPS or LTA. Measurements and Main Results Both LPS and LTA induced polarization in healthy monocytes in vitro, with increased expression of both pro- (CD40 and PDL1, p<0.05) and anti-inflammatory (CD16 and CD163, p<0.05) polarization markers, with non-significant effects on CD86 and CD206. This pattern resembled, at least partly, that of monocytes from septic patients. Treatment with AA significantly inhibited the upregulation of surface expression of CD16 and CD163 (p<0.05) in a dose dependent manner, but not CD40 or PDL-1. Finally, AA attenuated LPS or LTA-induced cytokine production of IL-8 and TNF in a dose-dependent manner (both p<0.05). Conclusions AA inhibits upregulation of anti-, but not pro-inflammatory related markers in LPS or LTA polarized monocytes. Additionally, AA attenuates cytokine production from in vitro polarized monocytes, displaying functional involvement.

The abrupt shift to the emergency delivery of online courses during COVID-19 has accelerated big tech's coup d'état of higher education, perhaps irrevocably. Yet, commercial technologies are not necessarily aligned with dialogic conceptions of learning while a technological transmission model negates learners' input and interactions. Mikhail Bakhtin viewed words as the multivocal bridge to social thought. His theory of the polysemy of language, that has subsequently been termed dialogism, has strong correlations with the semiotic philosophy of American pragmatist Charles Sanders Peirce. Peirce's semiotic philosophy of signs extends far beyond words, speech acts, linguistics, literary genres, and/or indeed human activity. This study traces links between Bakhtin's dialogism with Peirce's semiotics. Conceptual synthesis develops the semiotic-dialogic framework. Taking augmented reality as a theoretical case, inquiry illustrates that while technologies are subsuming traditional pedagogies, teachers and learners, this does not necessarily open dialogic learning. This is because technologies are never dialogic, in and of themselves, although semiotic learning always involves social actors' interpretations of signs. Crucially, semiotic-dialogism generates theorising of the visual literacies required by learners to optimise technologies for dialogic learning. © 2021 University Library System, University of Pittsburgh.

In a densely populated country like India which has currently the second highest number of infections and limited medical support, it is a need for the authorities to know the statistics beforehand to address these issues more effectively. In this article, a data driven transfer learning based model is proposed that takes into account the conditions of different countries which have witnessed the COVID-19 infection. We have taken four countries to be the source domain for transfer learning scenario namely, the United States of America, Spain, Brazil and Bangladesh. We have pre-trained four different LSTM-RNN models with each of the country's data and have re-trained (fine tuned) each of the models using only a very small portion of Indian data on COVID-19. Predictions of these four models are averaged to get the actual prediction. It is seen that such an ensemble model outperforms all the compared models and accurately predicts even the daily cases. This may be due to the fact that the four LSTM-RNNs used here could successfully take into account the diversities of conditions.

Analisi dell’impatto e delle risposte del sistema sanitario pugliese,17.300795,3.54764,2021,"Two Gram-positive, anaerobic bacteria, designated 27733 and 27737, were isolated from a soft tissue infection from a human patient. They were preliminarily identified as Clostridium perfringens through a series of phenotypic tests, including Gram-staining, determination of lipase and hemolytic activities, MALDI-ToF profiling, and a commercial biochemical identification system. In line with these results, genomes obtained for both isolates were ~3.56 Mbp in size, showed a DNA G+C content of ~28.4%, and contained C. perfringens ribosomal markers (i.e. 16S rRNA gene identity >99.0% to C. perfringens ATCC13124T). A closer examination of these sequences; however, revealed low average Nucleotide Identity (~87%) and digital DNA-DNA Hybridization (~35%) values between isolates 27733/27737 and C. perfringens ATCC13124T, as well as substantial differences in gene content to multiple C. perfringens strains, indicating that they represent a novel species within the genus Clostridium. Congruently, Bayesian dating analyses placed the divergence of this new species and C. perfringens from its common ancestor hundreds of thousands of years ago. Isolates 27733/27737 are not genomically identical (34-197 SNPs apart) and carry genes for C. perfringens-like toxins (<94% nucleotide sequence identity), including plc (alpha toxin), pfoA (perfringolysin O, theta-toxin), nagHIJKL (hyalorudinase, mu-toxin), nanHIJ (exo-alpha sialidase), and cloSI (alpha-clostripain). They do not have known antibiotic resistance genes but were catalogued as resistant to clindamycin through phenotypic tests. On the basis of the presented evidence, and due to its resemblance and potential confusion with C. perfringens, we herein propose the species C. perfringenosum sp. nov. and strain 27733 as its type strain.","Rodríguez, César; Kiu, Raymond; Quesada-Gómez, Carlos; Sandí, Cindy; Hall, Lindsay J",bioRxiv,417,24

However, there are growing laboratory reports that the newer variants of concerns (VOCs e.g. Alpha, Beta, Delta etc) may evade vaccine induced defense. In addition to that, there are few ground reports on health workers having breakthrough infections. In order to understand VOC driven breakthrough infection we investigated 14 individuals who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 after being administered a single or double dose of Covishield (ChAdOx1, Serum Institute of India) from the city of Varanasi, which is located in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh. Genomic analysis revealed that 78.6% (11/14) of the patients were infected with the B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant. Notably, the frequency (37%) of this variant in the region was significantly lower (p<0.01), suggesting that the vaccinated people were asymmetrically infected with the Delta variant. Most of the patients tested displayed mild symptoms, indicating that even a single dose of the vaccine can help in reducing the severity of the disease. However, more comprehensive epidemiological studies are required to understand the effectiveness of vaccines against the newer VOCs.","Zaveri, L.; Singh, R.; Basu, P.; Banu, S.; Mukherjee, P.; Vishwakarma, S.; Sahni, C.; Kaur, M.; Singh, N.

Moreover, the fact that the consumption of functional foods could boost the immune system and resistance of the human body against viruses, has been a priority for consumers through the last decades. This trend has been magnified during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and is expected to remain high also within the post-lockdown and post-pandemic era. Scope and approach: Pomegranate is one of the healthiest fruits worldwide with a significant amount of various phenolic compounds. The processing of pomegranate into juice generates huge amounts of by-products, such as peels and seeds, leading to disposal issues and environmental pollution. Pomegranate peels contain higher amounts of bioactive compounds, mainly phenolic acids, flavonoids and tannins, than the edible fleshy parts. These compounds possess antioxidant and antimicrobial properties that inhibit the process of lipid peroxidation in fatty foods and scavenging free radicals and prevent the growth of microorganisms, respectively. In this perspective, the present review analyzes and critically discusses the state of the art about the current and potential uses of pomegranate peel extract (PPE) as a natural food additive. The enriched food systems (e.g. meat, poultry and fish products, dairies, edible oils and fats), the form of added extract (crude or encapsulated), the method of extraction employed, the extract concentration and the main outcomes of each study are reviewed and discussed. Key finding and conclusions: Crude or encapsulated pomegranate peel extracts increase food stability upon processing, storage or gastrointestinal digestion conditions by inhibiting oxidation as well as the growth of pathogenic microorganisms. In most of the studies, the addition of PPE was not found to negatively affect the sensorial properties of the final products up to a specific addition level. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Kaderides, K.; Kyriakoudi, A.; Mourtzinos, I.; Goula, A.

Preclinical and clinical studies suggested a coordination of engagement of innate and adaptive immunity with the combination of an anti-HER2 antibody and an immune checkpoint blockade. KN026 is a novel bispecific antibody that simultaneously binds to two distinct HER2 epitopes. KN046 is a novel bispecific antibody that blocks both PD-L1 interaction with PD-1 and CTLA-4 interaction with CD80/CD86. Here we reported the interim results from an ongoing phase Ib dose escalation and expansion study assessing the safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy for KN026 in combination with KN046.MethodsThis study enrolled pts with solid tumors who failed available standard of care, HER2 aberration status confirmed locally (HER2 mutation, HER2 amplification and/or HER2 overexpression). Eligible pts received combination of KN026 and KN046 at two dose levels until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or withdrawal of informed consent (DL1: KN026 20 mg/kg Q2W + KN046 3 mg/kg Q2W;DL2: KN026 20 mg/kg Q2W with loading on Days 1, 8 of Cycle 1 + KN046 5 mg/kg Q3W). Tumor response was evaluated Q8W per RECIST 1.1. Primary endpoint was DLT and key secondary endpoints were efficacy parameters (ORR, DOR, PFS).ResultsAs of the Jul. 13, 2020, 21 pts were enrolled into DL1 (n = 18, 3 for dose escalation) and DL2 (n = 3) (mGC/GEJ 12 pts;mCRC 7 pts;other solid tumors 2 pts). 11 pts remained on the study treatment and 10 pts discontinued treatment due to disease progression (n=5), death (n=2) and other reasons (n=3). 15 pts had HER2-positive status (11 of 15 failed previous trastuzumab therapy), 1 pts had HER2 mutation and 5 pts had HER2 low expression (without FISH amplification). No DLTs were observed. No pts experienced LVEF decreased or other clinically meaningful cardiac AEs. Treatment-related TEAEs occurred in 13 pts, of which 1 pts experienced grade 3 or above treatment-related TEAEs. 7 pts experienced irAEs, all of which were grade 1 or 2. The most common (≥ 10%) KN026 or KN046 related TEAEs were anaemia (n=5, 23.8%), AST increased (n=4, 19.0%), rash (n=4, 19.0%), diarrhea (n=4, 19.0%), blood bilirubin increased (n=3, 14.3%) and infusion related reaction (n=3, 14.3%). The objective response rate in pts with HER2-positive tumors (n = 7 efficacy evaluable pts) was 4/7 (57.1%, 95% CI 18.4~90.1%) and disease control rate 6/7 (85.7%, 95% CI 42.1~99.6%). 3 pts with HER2 mutation or low expression achieved SD including one patient with SD for more than 24 weeks. 2 death cases only received one cycle of KN026 plus KN046 due to COVID-19 restriction before died from clinical deterioration from underlying tumors.ConclusionsKN026 combined with KN046 is well tolerated and has demonstrated profound anti-tumor activity in HER2-positive solid tumors.Trial RegistrationNCT04040699Ethics ApprovalThe study was approved by Beijing Cancer Hospital Institution’s Ethics Board, approval number 2019YJZ37.ConsentWritten informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this abstract and any accompanying images.

The strategy relies on several vaccination activities, including preventive mass vaccination campaigns (PMVCs). However, by how much PMVCs decrease the risk of outbreak to occur has not yet been quantified. Methods: We used the self-controlled case series (SCCS) method to assess the association between the occurrence of yellow fever outbreaks and the implementation of PMVCs at the province level in the African endemic region. As all time-invariant confounders are implicitly controlled for, the SCCS method is an alternative to classical cohort or case-control study designs when the risk of residual confounding is high. The location and dates of outbreaks were identified from international epidemiological records, and information on PMVCs was provided by coordinators of vaccination activities and international funders. The study sample consisted of provinces that were both affected by an outbreak and targeted for a PMVC between 2005 and 2018. We compared the relative incidence of outbreaks before and after the implementation of a PMVC. The sensitivity of our estimates to a range of assumptions was explored, and the results of the SCCS method were compared to those obtained through a retrospective cohort study design. We further derived the number of yellow fever outbreaks that have been prevented by PMVCs. Results: The study sample consisted of 33 African provinces. Among these, outbreaks occurred during the pre-PMVC period in 26 (78.8%) provinces versus 7 (21.2%) occurring in the post-PMVC period. This corresponded to a significantly reduced incidence rate ratio of 0.14 (95% Confidence interval 0.06 to 0.34) for the post-PMVC versus pre-PMVC period. This estimate was robust across a range of sensitivity analyses, while the results of the cohort-style analyses were highly sensitive to the choice of covariates included in the model. Based on the SCCS results, we estimated that PMVCs have reduced the number of outbreaks by 34% (22% to 45%) in Africa over the study period. Conclusion: Our estimates provide new empirical evidence of the high preventive impact of PMVCs on yellow fever outbreaks. This study illustrates that the SCCS method can be advantageously applied at the population level in order to evaluate a public health intervention.","Jean, K.; Raad, H.; Gaythorpe, K. A.

Although this claim is supported by several keystone studies, no thorough assessment on the frequency of introgression in nature has been performed to date. In this manuscript, we aim to address this knowledge gap by providing a meta-analysis of the most comprehensive survey of introgression studies in Eukaryotes to date (724 papers with claims of introgression). We first examined the evidence given to support introgression, and if/how the lines of evidence have changed across time. We then collated a single statistic, Patterson’s D, that quantifies the strength of introgression across 123 studies to further assess how taxonomic group, divergence time, and aspects of life history influence introgression. We find three main results. Studies on introgression are much more frequent in plants and mammals than any other taxonomic group. The study of introgression has shifted from a largely qualitative assessment of whether introgression happens, to a focus on when and how much introgression has occurred across taxa. The most often used introgression statistic, Patterson’s D, shows several intriguing patterns suggesting introgression reports may be biased by both differences in reporting criteria and sequencing technology, but may also differ across taxonomic systems and throughout the process of speciation. Together, these results suggest the need for a unified approach to quantifying introgression in natural communities, and highlight important areas of future research that can be better assessed once this unified approach is met.","Dagilis, Andrius J.; Peede, David; Coughlan, Jenn M.; Jofre, Gaston I.; D’Agostino, Emmanuel R.

Under lockdown measures, meeting students’ needs and encouraging their engagement in academic work have never been more urgent and challenging. In this study, we investigated the relationship between students’ satisfaction with institutional strategies, students’ optimism and pessimism, satisfaction with basic psychological needs, engagement in academic work, intention to drop out from studies, depression, and well-being. We conducted an online self-report study on N = 477 German college and university students (77.25% females, mean age = 23.96 years, SD = 4.78). The results of structural equation models showed that students’ satisfaction with institutional strategies was positively related to their basic psychological need satisfaction and engagement. Students’ optimism was positively associated with need satisfaction and engagement, whereas pessimism was negatively associated with them. Furthermore, students’ academic engagement was negatively linked to dropout intentions, whereas psychological need satisfaction was linked to depression and well-being. The findings of this study suggest that acknowledging students timely about the institutional strategies of examinations and courses and supporting students to engage academic activities are important institutional tasks during crisis. © Copyright © 2021 Teuber, Jia and Niewöhner.","Teuber, Z.; Jia, H.; Niewöhner, T.",Frontiers in Education,417,17

Therefore, there is a pressing need for the development and clinical testing of predictive models for ARDS events, which might improve the clinical diagnosis or the management of ARDS. In this paper, we focus on two distinct objectives;namely a) to design a scalable data science platform, built on open source technologies able to streamline the development of such models, and b) to exploit the platform using publicly available big datasets to develop such models. To this direction, we employ random forests and logistic regression algorithmic models for the early prediction and diagnosis of ARDS.

To overcome this major public health crisis, an understanding of the transmission of the virus underlying this disease is of paramount importance. Evidence suggests that the most common route of transmission for the SARS-CoV-2 virus is likely via direct contact in person-to-person encounter with aerosol droplets. However, the possibility of transmission via contact with fomites from surfaces is a possible route of infection as well. Environmental contamination in rooms with COVID-19 patient has been widely observed due to viral shedding from both asymptomatic and symptomatic patients. Also, in hospitals, SARS-CoV-2 is known to survive on various surfaces for extended periods of time. Because repetitive contact cycles can spread the virus from one surface to the other in healthcare settings, here we evaluated contamination on different types of surfaces commonly found in healthcare settings. Also, based on various datasets, we analyzed the importance of various surfaces in transmission modalities. Based on the findings of this study, decontamination of surfaces that frequently are in touch contact throughout all segments of the healthcare system should constitute an important part of the infection control and prevention of COVID-19.

Remote teaching is to some extent often viewed as an ineffective means of instructional delivery. It lacks the kind of interactions between teachers and students that are primarily found in traditional classrooms. In addition to ubiquitous technical hindrances, many educators find students' learning progress hard to monitor in remote teaching. The obstacles in remote teaching have prompted the government and educators to explore the possibilities of holding face-to-face meetings in a blended learning format amid the pandemic. This paper is aimed to present a sketch of students' perceptions of the possibilities of combining face-to-face classes with online learning during a pandemic. Using online surveys for data gathering and descriptive statistics for data analysis, this study found that students‟ perception of current emergencies influences their preferred mode of instructional delivery. The students appear to be much more tolerant of numerous hindrances in remote teaching than the potential risks of COVID-19 transmission. Most students in this study preferred fully online learning to blended learning. For them, health is the top priority. © 2021 Sciedu Press.

This has been very much the case during the COVID-19 pandemic, with healthcare professionals at the frontline facing physical exhaustion, mental health challenges associated with stigma, limited family time, and the passing of those seeking healthcare. In addition to some of the psychosocial factors impacting on healthcare professionals, the surge in the available evidence during the COVID-19 pandemic made clinical decision making cumbersome, as evidence-based medicine attempted to address clinical decision-making through the best available evidence together with clinical expertise and patient values. Researchers and academics rapidly responded to this public health emergency through the generation of knowledge that aimed to be both relevant and timeous to address the needs of the pandemic and halt the number of infections for those at great risk. The rapid response meant that while researchers aimed to inform the public and the scientific community about advances in science, methodological and ethical dilemmas emerged as part of evidence based decision-making. Cutting corners and producing evidence rapidly often meant that researchers and academics needed thoughtful reflection about whether they are guilty of exploiting the COVID-19 pandemic for academic progression while losing methodological and ethical integrity. In April 2020, the WHO database reported 5,362 COVID-19-related studies and numerous online COVID-19 collections (such as the Living Overview of Evidence platform and the Living Systematic Map of Evidence, to name but two). Would the adaptations to evidence-based medicine that the pandemic brought about change how evidence generation and synthesis is conducted in the future? Simultaneously, it could also suggest that this is the shift from traditional research methods and approaches to ones that are changing with the times in light of the fourth industrial revolution and the current pandemic. Some reflections that researchers and academics might need to consider to avoid jeopardising the methodological and ethical integrity of scientific contributions are set out in. All attempts at global public health research and evidence-based medicine should take place while the researcher reflects on how she/ he can ensure that the knowledge generated and shared can be relevant to help clinicians and the general public, locally. The language that is used in the dissemination and knowledge translation of evidence that emerges from research during the COVID-19 pandemic should also consider the availability of evidence in languages other than English, both languages widely spoken internationally and locally.","Davids, E.

We characterized the vertical structures of transport fluxes in central Luoyang, Fen-Wei Plain, China, in winter based on observations of vertical air pollutant and wind profiles using multi-axis differential optical absorption spectroscopy (MAX-DOAS) and Doppler wind lidar, respectively. The northwest and the northeast are the two privileged wind directions. The wind direction and total transport scenarios were dominantly the northwest during clear days, turning to the northeast during the polluted days. Increased transport flux intensities of aerosol were found at altitudes below 400 m on heavily polluted days from the northeast to the southwest over the city. Considering pollution dependence on wind directions and speeds, surface-dominated northeast transport may contribute to local haze events. Northwest winds transporting clean air masses were dominant during clean periods and flux profiles characterized by high altitudes between 200 and 600 m in Luoyang. During the COVID-19 lockdown period in late January and February, clear reductions in transport flux were found for NO2 from the northeast and for HCHO from the northwest, while the corresponding main transport altitude remained unchanged.

Adaptive immune receptor repertoire sequencing (AIRR-seq) is a common approach to study immune system dynamics. Understanding the genetic factors influencing the composition and dynamics of these repertoires is of major scientific and clinical importance. The chromosomal loci encoding for the variable regions of T and B cell receptors (TCRs and BCRs, respectively) are challenging to decipher due to repetitive elements and undocumented structural variants. To confront this challenge, AIRR-seq-based methods have been developed recently for B cells, enabling genotype and haplotype inference and discovery of undocumented alleles. Applying these methods to AIRR-seq data reveals a plethora of undocumented genomic variations. However, this approach relies on complete coverage of the receptors’ variable regions, and most T cell studies sequence only a small fraction of the variable region. Here, we adapted BCR inference methods to full and partial TCR sequences, and identified 38 undocumented polymorphisms in TRBV, 15 of them were also observed in genomic data assemblies. Further, we identified 31 undocumented 5’ UTR sequences. A subset of these inferences was also observed using independent genomic approaches. We found the two documented TRBD2 alleles to be equally abundant in the population, and show that the single nucleotide that differentiates them is strongly associated with dramatic changes in the expressed repertoire. Our findings expand the knowledge of genomic variation in the TRB (T Cell Receptor Beta) locus and provide a basis for annotation of TCR repertoires for future basic and clinical studies.","Omer, Aviv; Peres, Ayelet; Rodriguez, Oscar L; Watson, Corey T; Lees, William; Polak, Pazit; Collins, Andrew M; Yaari, Gur",bioRxiv,417,1

The Polish government declared a state of emergency on March 14, 2020, which was connected with the adoption of a number of measures aimed to prevent the spread of the virus. These restrictive measures have led to improvements in air quality throughout the country. Therefore, evaluation of the reduction in anthropogenic emissions due to COVID-19 and related government measures to constrain its spread is crucial to define its impact on air pollution. During this study, aerosol optical depth (AOD) observations from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) were used along with tropospheric NO2 and SO2 vertical column densities from TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI). The data on ground-based concentrations of pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, NO2 and SO2) obtained from air quality monitoring stations were also considered to assess changes in aerosols and air pollutants connected with the cessation of various kinds of anthropogenic and industrial activities due to preventive measures for COVID-19. In large cities of the country, the concentrations of PM2.5, PM10 and NO2 were reduced in the range from -5.1% to -35.5%, from -8.3% to -33.1% and from -0.4% to -18.8%. In addition, satellite data for NO2 and SO2 also indicate a decrease in concentration across the country by -10.8% and -25.6% during the COVID-19 restrictions period. The lockdown events may play a vital role as a potential solution to reduce air pollution in future as it may not be uncommon for governments to introduce deliberately selective hotspot lockdowns to control pollution levels.","Filonchyk, M.; Hurynovich, V.; Yan, H.

This system will work in post lockdown conditions, when the only mode of travel, is by road. It defines impact measures, that state the severity of potential disease spread, in a specific area. These impact measures are calculated based on existing hotspots, and are clustered into regions of varying danger-levels, using a graph clustering algorithm. Using this method, it can be predicted where more lenient measures may be taken, and which areas are less prone to the virus spread. There exist other methodologies to model the spread of viruses, but most overlook the spatial nature of viruses. The proposed system focuses on this limitation. Specifically, it focuses on preventing the virus spread, from a geographical point of view. Since the virus spread depends entirely on contact, regions near existing hotspots may potentially become new hotspots. The entire country is first visualized as a weighted graph of regions, at an appropriate administrative level, such as districts. The weights of the nodes are the number of active cases, and the weights of the edges are the geographical distances between those nodes. This graph is connected based on a distance threshold. The impact measure tells the impact of a region, on nearby regions, and the danger value tells the transmission possibility, between separate regions. Using this data, potential hotspots are easily identified. This data will help administrative bodies, to make more fine-tuned lockdown restrictions, based on the impact measures. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Behera, V.

Close physical interactions involved by certain daily activities help transmit the virus. Travel required by the spatial distribution of activities contributes to the propagation of the virus. In order to control and limit this propagation, it is critical to understand the contribution of daily activities to the dynamics of COVID-19. This paper investigates the connection between daily activities, their distribution in space and time, the characteristics of the individuals performing them, and the transmission of the virus. A business-as-usual agent-based simulation scenario of Montreal, Canada is used. To address this research question, we use two agent-based models: MATSIM and EPISIM. MATSIM simulates daily activities and mobility dynamics of the population. EPISIM simulates the spread of the virus in the population using contact networks computed by MATSIM. A synthetic population of Montreal is defined to replicate the main observed sociodemographic characteristics of Montrealers as well as their activity and mobility patterns. The definition of the synthetic population relies on various data sources: household travel survey, census, real estate, car ownership, and housing data. In the business-as-usual scenario, findings underline the significant role of home, work, and school activities in community transmission of COVID-19. Secondary activities, including leisure and shopping, also help spread the virus, but to a lesser degree in comparison with primary activities. The risk of infection in the workplace depends on the economic sector. Healthcare workers are, by far, the most exposed workers to the virus. Workplace infections mirror the gender-biased job market of Montreal. Most infections in the healthcare and educational services are among women. Most infections in the manufacturing, construction, transportation, and warehousing industries are among men. In the business-as-usual scenario where community transmission is high, primary and secondary school-aged children are found to be a major transmission vector of the virus. Finally, simulation results suggest that the risk of infection in the public transportation system is low. © Copyright © 2021 Manout and Ciari.","Manout, O.; Ciari, F.",Frontiers in Built Environment,417,16

Results were analyzed in a multivariable model accounting for age, sex and time since the administration of the second dose of the vaccine. Findings: Sex and time since the second dose had little association with the antibody titres. Age, however, was highly relevant: measurable antibody levels were present in about 90% of individuals below the age of 50, but antibody production after BBIBP-CorV vaccination was strongly reduced with increasing age. A large number of elderly subjects, reaching 25% at 60 years, and up to 50% at ages over 80, were found not to produce any protective antibody.

The bike-sharing system (BSS) and yellow taxi system (YTS) in Manhattan were substantially affected. This sudden drop in demand can impact not only short and long-term mobility but also the sustainability of transport network. Given that few empirical studies are focusing on the impacts of the “stay-at-home” policy on the BSS and YTS, this further substantiates the importance of analyzing how the policy affects the overall transportation system in New York City (NYC). This paper aims to fill this gap by quantifying the impacts of the “stay-at-home” policy on the two aforementioned transportation systems. Specifically, the following three research gaps are summarized in this study: I) The hidden biases in current “stay-at-home” policy estimation methods were not properly addressed;II) The policy impacts on BSS and YTS during different periods of the effective day were unclear;III) The sensitivity of uncontrolled confounders in long-term policy impact estimations was poorly discussed. We addressed these important research gaps by introducing robust statistical approaches like regression discontinuity design (RDD) and propensity score matching (PSM) methods, which can overcome methodological challenges such as counterfactual restoration, spatiotemporal heterogeneities, and unmeasured confounders. The BSS and YTS were studied at the aggregated neighborhood levels. Results demonstrate that the impacts to BSS have higher variations than YTS usage. The monthly average treatment effects on the treated (ATT) for BSS ranged from -72% to -28% respectively in March and June, while YTS ranged from -96% to -94%. Evidence suggests that demand for BSS surged on weekends in May and June.

With the COVID-19 pandemic continuing to attack the health of workforce, managing the balance between energy efficiency and Occupation Health and Safety (OHS) in the workplace becomes another great challenge for the RIP. Maintaining this balance is difficult mainly because a full awareness of the OHS will generally consume more energy while reducing the energy cost may lead to a less effective OHS, and the existing literature has not seen a system that is designed for the RIPs to conserve energy usage and improve workforce OHS simultaneously. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we propose an AI Empowered Cyber Physical Ecosystem (AECPE) solution for the RIPs, which integrates Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), artificial intelligence, and mobile networks. The preliminary results of lab experiments and field tests proved that the AECPE was able to help industries reduce the corporate annual energy cost that is worth millions of dollars, optimise the environmental conditions, and improve OHS for all workers and stakeholders. The implementation of the AECPE can result in efficient energy usage, reduced wastage and emissions, environment-friendly operations, and improved social reputation of the industries.","Koutroumpinas, Petros Zhang Yu Wallis Steve Chang Elizabeth",Energies,417,1

This study investigates the mechanism of COVID-19 transmission in different periods within and between cities in China to better understand the nature of the outbreak. We use Moran’s I, a measure of spatial autocorrelation, to examine the spatial dependency of COVID-19 and a dynamic spatial autoregressive model to explore the transmission mechanism. We find that the spatial dependency of COVID-19 decreased over time and that the transmission of the disease could be divided into three distinct stages: an eruption stage, a stabilization stage, and a declination stage. The infection rate between cities was close to one-third of the infection rate within cities at the eruption stage, while it reduced to zero at the declination stage. We also find that the infection rates within cities at the eruption stage and declination stage were similar. China’s policies for controlling the spread of the epidemic, specifically with respect to limiting inter-city mobility and implementing intra-city travel restrictions (social isolation), were most effective in reducing the viral transmission of COVID-19. The findings from this study indicate that the elimination of inter-city mobility had the largest impact on controlling disease transmission.","Yu, Hanchen Li Jingwei Bardin Sarah Gu Hengyu Fan Chenjing",ISPRS International Journal of Geo-Information,417,24

This chapter begins with a brief overview of the core concept of IoT followed by various IoT based smart-environment, applications, and services areas of IoT in the smart environment. Despite the countless possibilities that IoT along with other emerging technologies has to offer, various hindrances will be encountered with such large number of devices connected to each other transmitting sensitive data. Several such challenges faced in the adoption of IoT in areas such as smart city development, smart education, healthcare and medicine sector, manufacturing, smart grid, agronomy and telecommunication are investigated next in this chapter. Blockchain technology is gaining popularity for its decentralization abilities and absence of intermediaries and hence can prove to be a panacea for the concerns related to the adaption of IoT. This chapter introduces the use of blockchain to address these challenges arising due to the centralized structure of IoT and the benefits of integrating blockchain with IoT environment. Keeping in mind the recent developments related to Covid-19 and the vulnerabilities caused henceforth, in the last segment of this chapter, we have briefly reviewed various domains where use of IoT can prove beneficial. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Neha, Gupta P.; Alam, M.

This requires capturing the detail of clinical workflows to inform the design of new interactions including those with touchless technologies that decipher human-speech, gesture and motion and allow for interactions that are free of contact. Many environments in hospitals are sub-optimally designed, with a poor layout of work surfaces, cumbersome equipment that requires space and effort to manoeuvre, designs that require healthcare staff to reach awkwardly and medical devices that require extensive touch. This suggests there is a need to better understand how they can be designed. Here, we employ a new approach by installing a single 360 degree camera into a clinical environment to analyse touch patterns and human-environment interactions across a clinical team to recommend design considerations for new technologies with potential to reduce avoidable touch.","Visram, S.; Potts, L.; Sebire, N.

By analyzing daily COVID-19 case data in the United States, Mexico and Canada, we found four continental-scale epidemic wave patterns, including travelling waves, that spanned multiple state and even international boundaries. These major epidemic patterns co-varied strongly with continental-scale seasonal temperature change patterns. Geo-contiguous states shared similar timing and amplitude of epidemic wave patterns irrespective of similarities or differences in state government political party affiliations. These analyses provide evidence that seasonal factors, probably weather changes, have exerted major effects on local COVID-19 incidence rates.

Epithelial cells are central to the pathogenesis of multiple lung diseases. In chronic diseases, increasing age is a principle risk factor. In acute diseases, such as COVID-19, children suffer less severe symptoms than adults and have a lower rate of mortality. Few studies have explored differences between airway epithelial cells in children and adults to explain this age dependent variation in diseases. Here, we perform bulk RNA sequencing studies in laser-capture microdissected whole epithelium, FACS-sorted basal cells and cultured basal cells, as well as in vitro cell proliferation experiments, to address the intrinsic molecular differences between paediatric and adult airway basal cells. We find that, while the cellular composition of the paediatric and adult tracheobronchial epithelium is broadly similar, in cell culture, paediatric airway epithelial cells displayed higher colony forming ability, better in vitro growth and outcompeted adult cells in competitive proliferation assays. In RNA sequencing experiments, we observed potentially important differences in airway epithelial gene expression between samples from children and adults. However, genes known to be associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection were not differentially expressed between children and adults.

The age of storing sensitive information on paper is on the brink of extinction. Almost every organization in the world is shifting towards an efficient cloud storage system. With the global impact of Covid-19 and the norm of ""work from home"", the importance of proper data extraction from digital documents has increased manifold. So, in this paper, we proposed a method to extract data from scanned document images by identifying handwritten texts and respective label fields. While scanning images various issues can appear such as - background noises, blurred images due to camera motion, out of focus images, watermarks, stains, or anything that can cause hindrance to readability of users. So, for our method to work better our first approach was to filer the scanned images by removing noises. We trained our dataset on Cycle Generative Adversarial Networks (Cycle-GAN) to generate clean scanned images from noisy images. Later on, for detecting labels and text fields we trained Mask R-CNN on our cleaned dataset. Finally, we extract the information using Tesseract from the detected fields and assign the labels filed with corresponding information on a text file.","Hoque, O. B.; Rashid, M. B.; Jawad, K. M.

The outputs from each session build towards the next one, following a structured process that goes from gap identification to joint planning of corrective measures. The NBW process allows human and animal health sector representatives to jointly identify actions that support collaboration while advancing evaluation goals identified through the IHR-MEF and the OIE PVS Pathway. By integrating sector-specific and collaborative goals, the NBWs help countries in creating a realistic, concrete and practical joint road map for enhanced compliance to international standards as well as strengthened preparedness and response for health security at the human-animal interface.","Belot, Guillaume; Caya, François; Errecaborde, Kaylee Myhre; Traore, Tieble; Lafia, Brice; Skrypnyk, Artem; Montabord, Djhane; Carron, Maud; Corning, Susan; Sreedharan, Rajesh; Isla, Nicolas; Schmidt, Tanja; Gongal, Gyanendra; Samhouri, Dalia; Perez-Gutierrez, Enrique; Riviere-Cinnamond, Ana; Xing, Jun; Chungong, Stella; de la Rocque, Stephane",bioRxiv,417,28

BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 outbreak is a serious health problem to human beings. The evidence suggests that inflammatory markers related to liver damage increase in severe forms of COVID-19 compared to mild cases. METHODS: The electronic databases ISI Web of Science, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library were comprehensively searched for articles published up to May, 2020. Data from each identified study was combined using the random effects model to estimate standardized mean difference (SMD) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). Sensitivity and publication bias were also calculated. RESULTS: Totally, 23 studies were included in this meta-analysis comprising 4313 patients with COVID-19. The random effects results demonstrated that patients with severe COVID-19 had significantly higher levels of CRP [SMD = 3.26 mg/L; (95% CI 2.5, 3.9); p<0.05; I2 = 98.02%; PHeterogeneity = 0.00], TNFα [SMD = 1.78 ng/mL; (95% CI 0.39, 3.1); p=0.012; I2 = 98.2%; PHeterogeneity = 0.00], and IL-6 [ SMD = 3.67 ng/mL; (95% CI 2.4, 4.8); p<0.05; I2 = 97.8%; PHeterogeneity = 0.00] compared with those with the mild form of the disease. Significant heterogeneity was present. No significant publication bias was observed in the meta-analysis. Sensitivity analyses showed a similar effect size while reducing the heterogeneity. CONCLUSION: The data suggests that enhanced inflammation may be associated with COVID-19-related liver damage, possibly involving inflammatory marker-related mechanisms.","Amiri-Dashatan, Nasrin; Koushki, Mehdi; Ghorbani, Fatemeh; Naderi, Nosratollah",Gastroenterol Hepatol Bed Bench,417,16

Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) has a high prevalence and is related to high consumption of health resources. For this reason, we performed a revision of the management of LUTS and HBP during and after COVID-19 pandemic. MATERIAL AND METHODS A group of experts in benign prostatic hyperplasia from different regions of Spain were selected to design a strategy to reorganize the management of benign prostatic hyperplasia and lower urinary tract symptoms during the pandemic. A comprehensive review of the literature was undertaken and a set of recommendations are generated. RESULTS Recommendations for the management of LUTS-BPH during and after the SARS/CoV2 coronavirus pandemic outbreak consist of promoting telemedicine and developing joint protocols with Primary Care Attention .Clear diagnostic and treatment criteria and referral criteria must be established. Referral of patients for risk complications such as kidney failure, recurrent hematuria and obstructive uropathy are a priority. Surgeries due to BPH are generally potentially delayed until phases I and II of the pandemic, in which the percentage of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 does not exceed 25%, and it is necessary to determine COVID19 negativity. The surgical technique that associates the least complications and the shortest stay should be selected. CONCLUSIONS The diagnosis and prescription of treatment for BPH during the COVID-19 pandemic should be based on telemedicine and joint protocols for primary care attention and urology. Elective surgical treatment can be delayed until we are in phases I or II, individualizing the surgical and anaesthetic technique of choice to minimize risks.","Medina-Polo, José; Téigell Tobar, Julio; Romero-Otero, Javier; Carballido-Rodríguez, Joaquín; Domínguez-Esteban, Mario; Martínez-Berganza, María Lourdes; Miñana-López, Bernardino; Unda Urzaiz, Jesús Miguel; Rodríguez-Antolín, Alfredo",Archivos espanoles de urologia,417,1

The objective of this study is to document incidence and etiology of ARI in infants, their seasonal variability and association of clinical profile with etiology. METHODS A birth cohort was followed for the first year of life; for each episode of ARI, nasopharyngeal aspirates were collected to identify the causative respiratory virus(es) using multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction assay. For lower respiratory tract infections blood culture, serum procalcitonin, serum antibodies to Mycoplasma and Chlamydia and urinary Streptococcus pneumoniae antigen were also assayed. RESULTS A total of 503 ARI episodes were documented in 310 infants for an incidence rate of 1.8 episodes per infant per year. Of these, samples were processed in 395 episodes (upper respiratory tract infection: 377; lower respiratory tract infection: 18). One or more viruses were detected in 250 (63.3%) episodes and viral coinfections in 72 (18.2%) episodes. Rhinovirus was the most common virus [105 (42%)] followed by respiratory syncytial virus [50 (20%)], parainfluenza virus [42 (16.8%)] and coronavirus [44 (17.6%)]. In lower respiratory tract infections, viral infections were detected in 12 (66.7%) episodes, bacterial infections in 17 (94.4%) episodes and mixed bacterial-viral infections in 8 (44.4%) episodes. Peak incidence of viruses was observed during February-March and September-November. There was no significant difference in symptom duration with virus types. CONCLUSION In this cohort of infants, ARI incidence was 1.8 episodes per year per infant; 95% were upper respiratory tract infections.

In this study, a database containing structural information of more than 8,000 existing drugs was virtually screened by a docking approach to identify potential binding molecules of SARS-CoV 3CLpro. As a target for screening, both a homology model and the crystallographic structure of the binding pocket of the enzyme were used. Cinanserin (SQ 10,643), a well-characterized serotonin antagonist that has undergone preliminary clinical testing in humans in the 1960s, showed a high score in the screening and was chosen for further experimental evaluation. Binding of both cinanserin and its hydrochloride to bacterially expressed 3CLpro of SARS-CoV and the related human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) was demonstrated by surface plasmon resonance technology. The catalytic activity of both enzymes was inhibited with 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) values of 5 microM, as tested with a fluorogenic substrate. The antiviral activity of cinanserin was further evaluated in tissue culture assays, namely, a replicon system based on HCoV-229E and quantitative test assays with infectious SARS-CoV and HCoV-229E. All assays revealed a strong inhibition of coronavirus replication at nontoxic drug concentrations. The level of virus RNA and infectious particles was reduced by up to 4 log units, with IC50 values ranging from 19 to 34 microM.

METHODS The authors conducted a cross-sectional study utilizing an online survey to assess the attitudes of pharmacists and other health care providers toward their role as immunization providers and perceived barriers to providing immunizations. The survey was distributed between November 2018 and February 2019. RESULTS Two hundred thirty-six pharmacists and 51 other health care providers completed the survey. Of the pharmacists who responded, 203 (86%) provided immunizations. Most respondents (97.9% of pharmacists and 90.2% of other health care providers) see vaccinations as a shared professional responsibility. Both pharmacists (82.6%) and other health care providers (79.6%) believe pharmacists have adequate training to administer vaccines to patients. Immunizing pharmacists identified 2 primary barriers to providing immunizations: patients refusing vaccines for financial reasons (55%) and patients not having insurance coverage for vaccines received in a pharmacy (55%). In contrast, the primary barrier identified by non-immunizing pharmacists is other responsibilities taking precedence over vaccinating (75%). Other health care providers identified determining whether their patients' insurance will reimburse for a vaccine (52%) as their primary barrier toward providing immunizations. CONCLUSION These surveys provide a baseline measure of the attitudes of Wisconsin pharmacists and other health care providers toward immunization provision and offer opportunities for comparison. Our findings highlight barriers, such as insurance coverage for immunizations, that may prevent pharmacists from increasing vaccination rates in Wisconsin.","MacKinnon, George E; Pabian, Inez; MacKinnon, Karen J; Sorum, Sarah E; Martin, Erica; Bernstein, Rebecca S; Rein, Lisa E; Schellhase, Kenneth",WMJ : official publication of the State Medical Society of Wisconsin,417,16

In contrast, several amino acid exchanges in human ACE2 which diminish SARS-S-driven entry do not interfere with NL63-S-mediated infection, suggesting that SARS-S and NL63-S might engage human ACE2 differentially. Moreover, we observed that NL63-S-driven entry was less dependent on a low-pH environment and activity of endosomal proteases compared to infection mediated by SARS-S, further suggesting differences in hCoV-NL63 and SARS-CoV cellular entry. NL63-S does not exhibit significant homology to SARS-S but is highly related to the S-protein of hCoV-229E, which enters target cells by engaging CD13. Employing mutagenic analyses, we found that the N-terminal unique domain in NL63-S, which is absent in 229E-S, does not confer binding to ACE2. In contrast, the highly homologous C-terminal parts of the NL63-S1 and 229E-S1 subunits in conjunction with distinct amino acids in the central regions of these proteins confer recognition of ACE2 and CD13, respectively. Therefore, despite the high homology of these sequences, they likely form sufficiently distinct surfaces, thus determining receptor specificity.","Hofmann, Heike; Simmons, Graham; Rennekamp, Andrew J; Chaipan, Chawaree; Gramberg, Thomas; Heck, Elke; Geier, Martina; Wegele, Anja; Marzi, Andrea; Bates, Paul; Pöhlmann, Stefan",Journal of virology,417,24

Even with the advancement of diagnostic tools, the causative agent of 20 to 30% of upper respiratory tract infections go undiagnosed. Recently, a newly identified human respiratory virus, human metapneumovirus (hMPV), was discovered in young children in The Netherlands. To study the prevalence of hMPV infections in Israeli children, respiratory specimens from 388 hospitalized children less than 5 years of age were evaluated for the presence of hMPV RNA, which was present in 42 (10.8%) of these samples. All hMPV-positive samples were negative for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza viruses (Flu) A and B, adenovirus, and parainfluenza viruses 1, 2, and 3. Conversely, hMPV RNA was not detected in 76 RSV-positive and 38 Flu A- or B-positive samples. Most hMPV activity was between the months February and April. Sequence analysis of 20 positive samples revealed that both of the hMPV genotypes (groups 1 and 2) have circulated in central Israel during the study period. Moreover, three of the four known hMPV subgroups (1A, 1B, and 2B) were detected among the tested samples. Seroprevalence of hMPV in 204 patients from the central part of Israel revealed that 100% of the children are hMPV seropositive by the age of 5 years old. We conclude that hMPV is a common respiratory pathogen in Israel, while mixed infections of hMPV with RSV or Flu in hospitalized children are apparently rare.","Regev, Liora; Hindiyeh, Musa; Shulman, Lester M; Barak, Asher; Levy, Virginia; Azar, Roberto; Shalev, Yael; Grossman, Zehava; Mendelson, Ella",Journal of clinical microbiology,417,1

Intracerebral (IC) infection of mice with mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) results in an acute encephalitis followed by a chronic demyelinating disease similar in pathology to the disease multiple sclerosis (MS). No increase in mortality was observed during the acute phase of disease following MHV infection of mice lacking CCR1 (CCR1-/-) as compared to wild-type (CCR1+/+) mice. However, by 21 d post-infection, 74% of CCR1-/- mice had succumbed to death compared to only 32% mortality of CCR1+/+ mice, indicating that chemokine signaling through CCR1 significantly (p <or= 0.04) enhanced survival following IC infection with MHV. Increased mortality in CCR1-/- mice was not associated with increased viral recovery from the CNS, although CCR1 deficiency correlated with reduced T-cell accumulation within the CNS during acute, but not chronic, disease. Despite the reduction in T-cell trafficking into the CNS of CCR1-/- mice during acute disease, components of host defense remained unaltered; T-cell effector functions including cytolytic activity and proliferation and the expression of IFN-gamma within the CNS were not significantly different between CCR1+/+ and CCR1-/- infected mice. In addition, macrophage infiltration into the CNS was unaffected in MHV-infected CCR1-/- mice when compared to CCR1+/+ mice. Furthermore, assessment of neuropathology revealed no difference in the severity of demyelination between CCR1-deficient and wild-type mice. Together, these findings reveal that T-cell and macrophage trafficking are not dependent on CCR1 and highlight an important role for CCR1 signaling in promoting survival during chronic MHV infection.","Hickey, Michelle J; Held, Katherine S; Baum, Elizabeth; Gao, Ji-Liang; Murphy, Philip M; Lane, Thomas E",Viral immunology,417,21

Neurogenic inflammation was produced in the tracheas of 2 groups of Long-Evans rats by electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve (5 V, 1 ms, 20 Hz for 5 min) or by an injection of capsaicin (15 to 200 micrograms/kg i.v.) or substance P (0.05 to 5.0 micrograms/kg i.v.). Rats of one group were pathogen-free; the others had serologic evidence of naturally occurring airway infections caused by Sendai virus, coronavirus, and Mycoplasma pulmonis. The stimuli produced neurogenic inflammation in both groups of rats, but the magnitude of this inflammation was much greater in the infected rats. The susceptibility of the infected rats to neurogenic inflammation was manifested by a 2.0 to 3.1 times larger increase in vascular permeability to Monastral blue, 5 times larger increase in number of neutrophils adhering to the endothelium of venules, and conspicuous morphologic changes in the tracheal epithelium. When pathogen-free rats acquired respiratory tract infections, they too became susceptible to neurogenic inflammation. Other experiments showed that infection by Sendai virus was essential for the change, although infection by M. pulmonis or coronavirus may also be necessary. The susceptibility to neurogenic inflammation outlasted the transient pathologic changes caused in the airway mucosa by the viral infections and may have been permanent.","McDonald, D M",The American review of respiratory disease,417,20

This automated system could be beneficial in detecting a bioterrorist threat as well as in detecting and monitoring disease outbreaks such as influenza, Norwalk, West Nile virus, Escherichia coli 0157 or severe acute respiratory syndrome. METHOD The Medline PubMed database was searched for articles relating to bioterrorism and syndromic surveillance from 1997 onwards. The websites of the Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care, Ontario Ministry of Public Safety and Security, Centers for Disease Control and Canadian Population and Public Health Branch of Health Canada were searched for articles relating to bioterrorism and syndromic surveillance. Interviews were conducted with key informants from Telehealth staff, the public health services of Ontario and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA. RESULTS Real-time syndrome surveillance is a new means of detecting disease outbreaks or possibly acts of bioterrorism at the first contact with the healthcare system. It has been used successfully to detect influenza outbreaks at an early stage. The system that is proposed would be a province-wide integrated early warning system for both bioterrorist events and emerging infections. It would use clusters of symptoms tied to temporal, demographic and spatial data to increase sensitivity and specificity. CONCLUSION Real-time syndrome surveillance is an evolving science. Emergency departments and Telehealth in Ontario lend themselves as first contacts to the healthcare system as excellent opportunities to perform syndrome surveillance. They offer the opportunity properly to identify at-risk patients for emerging infections by including contact and travel data into the symptom complex. This could identify at-risk patients early and lead to appropriate public health measures. The benefit of using Telehealth in Ontario is the provincial accessibility of Telehealth and the extensive data collected on one computerized system. Emergency departments should also have a uniform computerized triage data collection system to facilitate surveillance.","Moore, Kieran",European journal of emergency medicine : official journal of the European Society for Emergency Medicine,417,16

Since multiple infectious agents can be involved in calf diarrhea, and the detection of each of the causative agents by traditional methods is laborious and expensive, a panel of 2 multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays was developed for rapid and simultaneous detection of the 5 major bovine enteric pathogens (i.e., Bovine coronavirus [BCoV; formally known as Betacoronavirus 1], group A Bovine rotavirus [BRV], Salmonella spp., Escherichia coli K99(+), and Cryptosporidium parvum). The estimated detection limit (i.e., analytic sensitivity) of the panel was 0.1 TCID(50) (50% tissue culture infective dose) for BCoV and group A BRV; 5 and 0.5 colony-forming units for E. coli K99(+) and Salmonella, respectively; and 50 oocysts for Cryptosporidium per reaction. In testing 243 fecal samples obtained from submissions to the Iowa State University Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory or from experimental animals with known infection status, the newly developed multiplex real-time PCR panel simultaneously detected all 5 pathogens directly from fecal samples and was more rapid and sensitive than the traditional diagnostic tests. The PCR panel showed 89%-97% agreement with those conventional diagnostic tests, demonstrating diagnostic sensitivity equal to or better than that of the conventional tests. In conclusion, the multiplex real-time PCR panel can be a tool for a timely and accurate diagnosis of calf diarrhea associated with BCoV, group A BRV, E. coli K99(+), Salmonella, and/or Cryptosporidium.","Cho, Yong-Il; Kim, Won-Il; Liu, Siyuan; Kinyon, Joann M; Yoon, Kyoungjin J","Journal of veterinary diagnostic investigation : official publication of the American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians, Inc",417,24

The authors have investigated a photon-counting spectral imaging system with two energy bins for contrast-enhanced mammography. System optimization and the potential benefit compared to conventional non-energy-resolved absorption imaging was studied. METHODS A framework for system characterization was set up that included quantum and anatomical noise and a theoretical model of the system was benchmarked to phantom measurements. RESULTS Optimal combination of the energy-resolved images corresponded approximately to minimization of the anatomical noise, which is commonly referred to as energy subtraction. In that case, an ideal-observer detectability index could be improved close to 50% compared to absorption imaging in the phantom study. Optimization with respect to the signal-to-quantum-noise ratio, commonly referred to as energy weighting, yielded only a minute improvement. In a simulation of a clinically more realistic case, spectral imaging was predicted to perform approximately 30% better than absorption imaging for an average glandularity breast with an average level of anatomical noise. For dense breast tissue and a high level of anatomical noise, however, a rise in detectability by a factor of 6 was predicted. Another approximately 70%-90% improvement was found to be within reach for an optimized system. CONCLUSIONS Contrast-enhanced spectral mammography is feasible and beneficial with the current system, and there is room for additional improvements. Inclusion of anatomical noise is essential for optimizing spectral imaging systems.","Fredenberg, Erik; Hemmendorff, Magnus; Cederström, Björn; Aslund, Magnus; Danielsson, Mats",Medical physics,417,14

Immunoelectron microscopy using these MAbs demonstrated that in a significant proportion of the M protein molecules, the carboxy terminus is exposed on the external surface both in purified viruses and in nascent TGEV virions that recently exited infected swine testis cells. The same MAbs specifically neutralized the infectivity of the PUR46-MAD strain, indicating that the C-terminal domain of M protein is exposed on infectious viruses. This topology of TGEV M protein probably coexists with the structure currently described for the M protein of coronaviruses, which consists of an exposed amino terminus and an intravirion carboxy-terminal domain. The presence of a detectable number of M protein molecules with their carboxy termini exposed on the surface of the virion has relevance for viral function, since it has been shown that the carboxy terminus of M protein is immunodominant and that antibodies specific for this domain both neutralize TGEV and mediate the complement-dependent lysis of TGEV-infected cells.","Risco, C; Antón, I M; Suñé, C; Pedregosa, A M; Martín-Alonso, J M; Parra, F; Carrascosa, J L; Enjuanes, L",Journal of virology,417,24

A total of 18, 4-week-old pigs seronegative for PRRSV were allocated to 1 of 3 groups (groups A, B, and C). At 5 weeks of age, pigs of groups A (n=6 pigs) and B (n=6 pigs) were vaccinated intramuscularly and intradermally, respectively, with Porcilis PRRS. The more conventional intramuscular route of vaccination was included for comparative purposes with the intradermal route of vaccination (performed with the I.D.A.L. vaccinator). Pigs of group C (n=6 pigs) were kept as nonvaccinated controls. At post-vaccination (PV) days 7, 14, 21, 28, and 35, blood samples were collected for detection of vaccine virus (PCR) and antibodies (ELISA), and for changes in PBMC (flow cytometry). At PV day 35, pigs of all groups were each exposed (challenged) intranasally to a heterologous field strain (78% ORF5 sequence homology between vaccine and field virus) belonging to the Italian cluster of the European genotype of PRRSV. At post-challenge (PC) days 0, 3, 7, 10, 13, and 17, blood samples were collected for detection and quantitation of virus and antibodies, and for changes in PBMC as described above for blood samples collected PV. Throughout the experiment all pigs were observed daily for clinical signs. At PC days 7 and 17, two pigs and four pigs, respectively, of each group were euthanized and examined for macroscopic lesions. Following vaccination some pigs of groups A and B had a detectable viremia that in two pigs (one pig of group A and one pig of group B) lasted until PV day 28. However, all pigs (groups A, B, and C) remained clinically normal. All vaccinated pigs developed a serological response (ELISA) to PRRSV. Presumptive evidence for vaccine-induced protective immunity against the heterologous challenge strain was provided by finding that viremia following challenge was generally less (incidence) and significantly less (titers) in vaccinated pigs than in nonvaccinated pigs. No differences were apparent between pigs vaccinated intramuscularly and those vaccinated intradermally. The absence of virulent-virus-induced clinical signs and macroscopic lesions in nonvaccinated as well as in vaccinated pigs precluded a more definitive evaluation of the magnitude of protective immunity provided by vaccination or by the route of vaccination. Some likely treatment-associated changes in lymphocyte subpopulations were observed among the three treatment groups. These changes and their potential relationship to protective immunity are discussed.","Martelli, Paolo; Cordioli, Paolo; Alborali, Loris Giovanni; Gozio, Stefano; De Angelis, Elena; Ferrari, Luca; Lombardi, Guerino; Borghetti, Paolo",Vaccine,417,24

METHODS Deterministic susceptible-infected and susceptible-infected-removed models were used for both epidemic waves, using official published information. NLREG 6.2 was used for estimating deterministic parameters and analytical solutions were obtained with Maple 9 software. Dynamical indicators were obtained for the epidemic. RESULTS Suitable adjustment of the data was observed with both models, but smaller adjustment was observed during the second wave with the non- removed model. The highest rate of infectiousness was shown (35 new cases per 10 000 susceptible people) during the second wave (with R0 near to one), in spite of presenting greater incidence (8.8 cases per day), compensated for by a high rate of removal (11,5 cases per day) which lasted less than the epidemic (11,1 days), and a lower rate of attack (1 case per each 100 susceptible people).

The virus is spreading rapidly in China and around the globe, affecting thousands of people leading to a pandemic. To control the mortality rate associated with the 2019-nCoV, prompt steps are needed. Until now there is no effective treatment or drug present to control its life-threatening effects in the humans. The scientist is struggling to find new inhibitors of this deadly virus. In this study, to identify the effective inhibitor candidates against the main protease (Mpro) of 2019-nCoV, computational approaches were adopted. Phytochemicals having immense medicinal properties as ligands were docked against the Mpro of 2019-nCoV to study their binding properties. ADMET and DFT analyses were also further carried out to analyze the potential of these phytochemicals as an effective inhibitor against Mpro of 2019-nCoV.","Rasool, Nouman; Akhtar, Ammara; Hussain, Waqar",Struct Chem,417,16

While several countries have chosen the almost complete lock-down for slowing down SARS-CoV-2 spread, the scientific community is called to respond to the devastating outbreak by identifying new tools for diagnosis and treatment of the dangerous COVID-19. With this aim, we performed an in silico comparative modeling analysis, which allows gaining new insights into the main conformational changes occurring in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, at the level of the receptor-binding domain (RBD), along interactions with human cells angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, that favor human cell invasion. Furthermore, our analysis provides (1) an ideal pipeline to identify already characterized antibodies that might target SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD, aiming to prevent interactions with the human ACE2, and (2) instructions for building new possible neutralizing antibodies, according to chemical/physical space restraints and complementary determining regions (CDR) mutagenesis of the identified existing antibodies. The proposed antibodies show in silico high affinity for SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD and can be used as reference antibodies also for building new high-affinity antibodies against present and future coronaviruses able to invade human cells through interactions of their spike proteins with the human ACE2. More in general, our analysis provides indications for the set-up of the right biological molecular context for investigating spike RBD-ACE2 interactions for the development of new vaccines, diagnostic kits, and other treatments based on the targeting of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.","Mercurio, Ivan; Tragni, Vincenzo; Busto, Francesco; De Grassi, Anna; Pierri, Ciro Leonardo",Cell. mol. life sci,417,1

While novel methods for virtual resident training have been described, many of these demonstrate a substantial change from previous instructional methods and their efficacy cannot be directly compared to in-person teaching. We sought to determine if the conversion of our intern ""summer school"" from an in-person to online format (a) impacted the knowledge acquisition of interns, and (b) their preferences for senior resident-led didactics. DESIGN: A senior-resident led intern summer curriculum was started in an in-person format with the 2019-2020 academic year. Interns underwent assessments of their knowledge and surveys of changes in subject confidence. After the COVID-19 pandemic, the curriculum was shifted to an online format for the academic year 2020-2021. SETTING: Washington University in St. Louis, an academic medical center located in St. Louis, Missouri PARTICIPANTS: PGY1 general surgery residents during academic year 2019-2020 (nâ¯=â¯13) and 2020-2021 (nâ¯=â¯14). RESULTS: In both years, interns demonstrated significant increases in confidence pre- and post-summer school in all domains (p <0.01). This was no different between the in-person and the virtual administration of the bootcamp (p 0.76). In both virtual and in-person curricula, interns demonstrated increased knowledge as measured by multiple choice, boards-style question quizzes. There were no significant differences between virtual and in-person formats. In both formats, interns reported a preference for senior residents as teachers (81% v. 77%) and increased comfort in asking questions in senior resident-led vs. attending-led didactics (91% v 100%). CONCLUSION: Virtual senior-resident led intern educational sessions are equally as effective as in-person sessions for knowledge acquisition and improving confidence in intern-specific domains. In both virtual and in-person settings, interns prefer senior resident teachers to attendings. Virtual senior resident-led education is an effective and simple method for intern instruction, regardless of the format/approach.","Caldwell, Katharine E; Hess, Annie; Wise, Paul E; Awad, Michael M",J. surg. educ,417,26

METHODS: This retrospective study included 255 patients with COVID-19. Of these, 214 were admitted to isolation wards and 41were admitted to intensive care units (ICUs). Demographic, clinical, treatment, and laboratory data were collected and compared between ICU and non-ICU patients. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to explore the risk factors associated with poor clinical outcomes (ICU admission or death). RESULTS: There were significant changes in several clinical parameters in ICU patients (leukopenia, lymphopenia, elevated D-dimer, as well as higher levels of FPG, cardiac troponin, serum ferritin, IL-6, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein)compared with non-ICU patients. The prevalence of known diabetes was substantially higher in ICU than non-ICU patients (31.7% vs. 17.8%, P = 0.0408). Multivariable regression analysis showed that a history of diabetes [odds ratio (OR), 0.099; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.016-0.627; P = 0.014], high FPG at admission (OR, 1.587; 95% CI, 1.299-1.939, P < 0.001), high IL-6 (OR, 1.01; 95% CI, 1.002-1.018, P = 0.013), and D-dimer higher than 1 mg/L at admission (OR, 4.341; 95% CI, 1.139-16.547, P = 0.032) were independent predictors of poor outcomes. Cox proportional hazards analysis showed that compared with FPG < 7 mmol/L, FPG levels of 7.0-11.1 mmol/L and &#8805; 11.1 mmol/L were associated with an increased hazard ratio (HR) for poor outcome (HR, 5.538 [95% CI, 2.269-13.51] and HR, 11.55 [95% CI, 4.45-29.99], respectively).

OBJECTIVE: In this study, we aimed to identify factors that predict the overall survival rate for COVID-19 cases and develop a COVID-19 prognosis score (COPS) system based on these factors. In addition, disease severity and the length of hospital stay for patients with COVID-19 were analyzed. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed a nationwide cohort of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases between January and April 2020 in Korea. The cohort was split randomly into a development cohort and a validation cohort with a 2:1 ratio. In the development cohort (n=3729), we tried to identify factors associated with overall survival and develop a scoring system to predict the overall survival rate by using parameters identified by the Cox proportional hazard regression model with bootstrapping methods. In the validation cohort (n=1865), we evaluated the prediction accuracy using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. The score of each variable in the COPS system was rounded off following the log-scaled conversion of the adjusted hazard ratio. RESULTS: Among the 5594 patients included in this analysis, 234 (4.2%) died after receiving a COVID-19 diagnosis. In the development cohort, six parameters were significantly related to poor overall survival: older age, dementia, chronic renal failure, dyspnea, mental disturbance, and absolute lymphocyte count <1000/mm3. The following risk groups were formed: low-risk (score 0-2), intermediate-risk (score 3), high-risk (score 4), and very high-risk (score 5-7) groups. The COPS system yielded an area under the curve value of 0.918 for predicting the 14-day survival rate and 0.896 for predicting the 28-day survival rate in the validation cohort. Using the COPS system, 28-day survival rates were discriminatively estimated at 99.8%, 95.4%, 82.3%, and 55.1% in the low-risk, intermediate-risk, high-risk, and very high-risk groups, respectively, of the total cohort (P<.001). The length of hospital stay and disease severity were directly associated with overall survival (P<.001), and the hospital stay duration was significantly longer among survivors (mean 26.1, SD 10.7 days) than among nonsurvivors (mean 15.6, SD 13.3 days). CONCLUSIONS: The newly developed predictive COPS system may assist in making risk-adapted decisions for the allocation of medical resources, including intensive care, during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Cho, Sung-Yeon; Park, Sung-Soo; Song, Min-Kyu; Bae, Young Yi; Lee, Dong-Gun; Kim, Dong-Wook",J Med Internet Res,417,2

METHODS: Online surveys with ICT users aged 60 years and above were conducted in 2016 (N = 537) and during the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020 (N = 407), examining technostress level, internet use patterns and sociodemographic background. The 2020 survey also assessed a COVID-19-related Hostile World Scenario (HWS). RESULTS: The two samples had very similar background characteristics, but participants in 2020 were more experienced and their internet use was significantly more diverse and intense than that of their predecessors. The factors predicting technostress in both samples were poorer health, fewer years of use, fewer hours of use per typical week and smaller use repertoire. The technostress level in 2020 was significantly higher than that of 2016-a finding explained by the COVID-19-related HWS. CONCLUSIONS: Individual antecedents hardly vary in the presence of significant contextual antecedents, but HWS may leave users with fewer resources to cope with the negative effects of technology use.

Single variable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to identify mortality-related factors. We combined multiple factors to predict mortality, which was validated by receiver operating characteristic curves. As a result, in a total of 336 patients, 34 (10.1%) patients died during hospitalisation. Through multivariable logistic regression, we found that decreased lymphocyte ratio (Lymr, %) (odds ratio, OR 0.574, P < 0.001), elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) (OR 1.513, P = 0.009), and raised D-dimer (DD) (OR 1.334, P = 0.002) at admission were closely related to death. The combined prediction model was developed by these factors with a sensitivity of 100.0% and specificity of 97.2%. In conclusion, decreased Lymr, elevated BUN, and raised DD were found to be in association with death outcomes in critically ill patients with COVID-19. A scoring system was developed to predict the clinical outcome of these patients.","Liu, Q; Song, N C; Zheng, Z K; Li, J S; Li, S K",Epidemiol Infect,417,24

Mitigating the enormous risk of COVID-19 to nursing home residents requires adequate data. The widely used Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) COVID-19 Nursing Home Dataset contains 2 derived statistics: Total Resident Confirmed COVID-19 Cases per 1000 Residents and Total Resident COVID-19 Deaths per 1000 Residents. These metrics provide a misleading picture, as facilities report cumulative counts of cases and deaths over different time periods but use a point-in-time measure as proxy for number of residents (number of occupied beds in a week), resulting in inflated statistics. We propose an alternative statistic to better illustrate the burden of COVID-19 cases and deaths across nursing facilities. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Using the CMS Nursing Home Compare and COVID-19 Nursing Home Datasets, we examined facilities with star ratings and COVID-19 data passing quality assurance checks for each reporting period from May 31 to August 16, 2020 (n = 11,115). METHODS: We derived an alternative measure of the number of COVID-19 cases per 1000 residents using the net change in weekly census. For each measure, we compared predicted number of cases/deaths by overall star rating using negative binomial regression with constant dispersion, controlling for county-level cases per capita and nursing home characteristics. RESULTS: The average number of cases per 1000 estimated residents using our method is lower compared with the metric using occupied beds as proxy for number of residents (44.8 compared with 66.6). We find similar results when examining number of COVID-19 deaths per 1000 residents. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Future research should estimate the number of residents served in nursing facilities when comparing COVID-19 cases/deaths in nursing facilities. Identifying appropriate metrics for facility-level comparisons is critical to protecting nursing home residents as the pandemic continues.","Miller, Katherine E M; Gorges, Rebecca J; Konetzka, R Tamara; Van Houtven, Courtney H",J Am Med Dir Assoc,417,20

Methods: The basic characteristics, time and area distributions, clinical manifestations, epidemiological history and transmission mode of the COVID-19 cases associated with the department store exposure were analyzed. Results: A total of 40 COVID-19 cases were associated with the department store exposure, accounting for 75.47% of the total confirmed cases (53 cases) reported in Baodi district. The cases were mainly at the age of 60 years or older (35.00%) and farmers (40.00%). The main clinical manifestations included fever (95.00%), cough (35.00%), and diarrhea (15.00%). The proportion of confirmed severe cases was 32.50%. The incidence curve showed that the incidence peak occurred on 31 January, 2020. Among the 40 cases, 6(15.00%) were department store employees, 19 (47.50%) were customers and 15 (37.50%) were close contacts (secondary cases). The first case occurred on 21 January, 2020, this case was a department store employee who had a purchasing history at whole sale markets in other provinces and cities before the onset, and 3 employees were still on duty after symptom onsets. The median of the incubation period of customer cases was 6 days, and the median of the interval between onset and medical treatment of customer cases was 7 days.

Ongoing high-quality assessment of this literature is therefore needed to enable clinical practice to be evidence-based. This review builds on a previous scoping review and aimed to identify associations between disease severity and various clinical, laboratory and radiological characteristics. We searched MEDLINE, CENTRAL, EMBASE, Scopus and LILACS for studies published between January 1, 2019 and March 22, 2020. Clinical studies including &#8805;10 patients with confirmed COVID-19 of any study design were eligible. Two investigators independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. A quality effects model was used for the meta-analyses. Subgroup analysis and meta-regression identified sources of heterogeneity. For hospitalized patients, studies were ordered by overall disease severity of each population and this order was used as the modifier variable in meta-regression. Overall, 86 studies (n = 91,621) contributed data to the meta-analyses. Severe disease was strongly associated with fever, cough, dyspnea, pneumonia, any computed tomography findings, any ground glass opacity, lymphocytopenia, elevated C-reactive protein, elevated alanine aminotransferase, elevated aspartate aminotransferase, older age and male sex. These variables typically increased in prevalence by 30-73% from mild/early disease through to moderate/severe disease. Among hospitalized patients, 30-78% of heterogeneity was explained by severity of disease. Elevated white blood cell count was strongly associated with more severe disease among moderate/severe hospitalized patients. Elevated lymphocytes, low platelets, interleukin-6, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and D-dimers showed potential associations, while fatigue, gastrointestinal symptoms, consolidation and septal thickening showed non-linear association patterns. Headache and sore throat were associated with the presence of disease, but not with more severe disease. In COVID-19, more severe disease is strongly associated with several clinical, laboratory and radiological characteristics. Symptoms and other variables in early/mild disease appear non-specific and highly heterogeneous.

Evidence from the COVID-19 Pandemic (preprint),17.705357,3.1638706,2021,"In the recent COVID-19 pandemic, a wide range of epidemiological modelling approaches have been used to predict the effective reproduction number, R(t), and other COVID-19 related measures such as the daily rate of exponential growth, r(t). These candidate models use different modelling approaches or differing assumptions about spatial or age mixing, and some capture genuine uncertainty in scientific understanding of disease dynamics. Combining estimates using appropriate statistical methodology from multiple candidate models is important to better understand the variation of these outcome measures to help inform decision making. In this paper, we combine these estimates for specific UK nations and regions using random effects meta analyses techniques, utilising the restricted maximum likelihood (REML) method to estimate the heterogeneity variance parameter, and two approaches to calculate the confidence interval for the combined estimate: the standard Wald-type intervals; and the Knapp and Hartung (KNHA) method. As estimates in this setting are derived using model predictions, each with varying degrees of uncertainty, equal weighting is favoured over the more standard inverse-variance weighting in order avoid potential up-weighting of models providing estimates with lower levels of uncertainty that are not fully accounting for inherent uncertainties. Utilising these meta-analysis techniques has allowed for statistically robust combined estimates to be calculated for key COVID-19 outcome measures. This in turn allows timely and informed decision making based on all of the available information.","Maishman, T.; Schaap, S.; Silk, D. S.; Nevitt, S. J.; Woods, D. C.; Bowman, V. E.",,417,29

DesignQualitative cross-sectional survey. SettingNew Zealand community cohort. Participants1040 respondents entered the study (18-90 years, M = 48.18.11, SD = 15.52, 76% women). 966 completed the questions relevant to this article. Participants were recruited via online advertisement campaigns designed to maximise variation in the sample as far as practicably possible. Main outcome measuresThematic analysis of participants narratives. ResultsA majority of participants reported that the elimination of SARS-CoV-2 had allowed their life to go back to being more or less the same as before the pandemic. A small number indicated the pandemic had inspired them to become more social following elimination. Nevertheless, a sizeable minority of respondents reported being less social, even many months after SARS-CoV-2 had been eliminated. This was often because of fears that the virus might be circulating undetected, or because the March-May 2020 lockdown had led to changes in relationships and personal habits that were not easily reversed. Becoming less social was associated with having an underlying health condition that heightened ones vulnerability to COVID-19 (p = 0.00005) and older age (p = 0.007). ConclusionsElimination strategies can successfully allow the public to return to a pre-pandemic normal - or reinvent and improve their social lives should they wish. However, such outcomes are not inevitable. Re-establishing social connections after elimination can sometimes be a challenging process, with which people may need support. Plans for providing such support should be an integral part of elimination strategies.","Long, Nicholas J; Appleton, Nayantara Sheoran; Davies, Sharyn Graham; Deckert, Antje; Fehoko, Edmond; Holroyd, Eleanor; Martin-Anatias, Nelly; Sterling, Rogena; Trnka, Susanna; Tunufa'i, Laumua",,417,21

So it becomes obligatory to assess the costs and benefits of a new technology, before defining its clinical value. We assessed the cost-effectiveness of intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) as compared to 2-dimensional radiotherapy (2-DRT) and 3-dimensional radiotherapy (3D-CRT) for treating head and neck cancers (HNC) in India. The cost-effectiveness of 3-DCRT as compared to 2-DRT was also estimated. METHODS: A probabilistic Markov model was designed. Using a disaggregated societal perspective, lifetime study horizon and 3 percent discount rate, future costs and health outcomes were compared for a cohort of 1000 patients treated with any of the three radiation techniques. Data on health system cost, out of pocket expenditure, and quality of life was assessed through primary data collected from a large tertiary care public sector hospital in India. Data on xerostomia rates following each of the radiation techniques was extracted from the existing randomized controlled trials. RESULTS: IMRT incurs an incremental cost of $7,072 (2,932-13,258) and $5,164 (463-10,954) per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained compared to 2-DRT and 3D-CRT, respectively. Further, 3D-CRT as compared to 2-DRT requires an incremental cost of $8,946 (1,996-19,313) per QALY gained. CONCLUSION: Both IMRT and 3D-CRT are not cost-effective at 1 times GDP per capita for treating HNC in India. The costs and benefits of using IMRT for other potential indications (e.g. prostate, lung) require to be assessed before considering its introduction in India.","Chauhan, Akashdeep Singh; Prinja, Shankar; Ghoshal, Sushmita; Verma, Roshan",Int J Technol Assess Health Care,417,22

Methods: Cross-sectional retrospective study conducted between March and May 2020, with a sample of 500 adult patients. The inclusion criterion was the manifestation of respiratory symptoms, regardless of type. Results: The mean age of patients was 34.7±10.5 years, and 59% were women. Most patients (62.6%) perceived their own health status as malaise and some (41.4%) self-diagnosed COVID-19. Cough (74.4%), rhinorrhea (65.6%), sore throat (38.6%) and sneezing (20.6%) were the most common infection-related symptoms.

This study investigates electrical impedance tomography (EIT) monitoring of a therapeutic bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) in a patient with COVID-19. APPROACH: A patient with COVID-19 developed acute respiratory distress syndrome requiring mechanical ventilation. He received regional BAL to remove mucus in the small airways (20 ml × 5). Regional ventilation changes before BAL, 30 min after and in the following days, were monitored with EIT. MAIN RESULTS: Regional ventilation worsened shortly after BAL and improved in the following days. The improvement of the oxygenation did not exactly match the ventilation improvement, which indicated a possible ventilation/perfusion mismatch. SIGNIFICANCE: Therapeutic BAL might improve regional ventilation for COVID-19 and EIT could be a useful tool at the bedside to monitor the ventilation treatment of COVID-19.","Fu, Yingyun; Zou, Rongrong; Wang, Shouhong; Wen, Junmin; Rong, Lei; Tang, Ming; Yu, Baojun; Cen, Fulan; Zhao, Zhanqi; Frerichs, Inéz; Adler, Andy; Liu, Yingxia; Liu, Lei",Physiol Meas,417,24

From the viewpoint of urban social-ecological system resilience in public health emergencies, this study comprehensively applies the spatial econometrics, geodetector model, and other methods to investigate the urban resilience level, spatial differentiation, and dominant elements in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River under the impact of the pandemic. This study would aid in providing a scientific basis for sustainable spatial planning and governance. The results demonstrated that the urban resilience in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River had notable spatial agglomeration features, eight elements including tertiary industry proportion possessed a robust explanatory power to the spatial differentiation of urban resilience, and the explanatory power was markedly enhanced after the interaction between influential elements of economic and ecological subsystems. Thus, to upgrade the system cycle mechanism and augment the endogenous power for urban development, we need to focus more on the flow of innovative elements in central cities, the optimization of ecological and safe spatial patterns in Hunan and Hubei Provinces, and the innovation of sustainable supply chain in the entire region.

Such information is unreliable and has very little value in assessing programmatic quality and impact. Regular monitoring of key process and outcome indicators based on data collected through a robust information system is essential to ensure quality of a screening programme. Fragmented health systems, limited resources and absence of a culture of systematic evaluation are the major hindrances for most of the LMICs to build electronic information systems to manage screening. The COVID-19 pandemic has created an impetus for the countries to customize the freely available District Health Information Software (DHIS2) to collect electronic data to track the outbreaks and manage containment measures. In the present article we present Bangladesh as an exemplar LMIC that has a (DHIS2) based integrated health information system gradually upgraded to collect individual data of the participants to the national cervical cancer screening program. Such efforts paid rich dividends as the screening program was switched from opportunistic to a population-based one. Moreover, the electronic system could report impact of the pandemic on cancer screening on a monthly basis. The aggregate number of women screened in the year 2020 was 14.1% less compared to 2019. The monthly rate of screening during peak of the outbreak was only 5.1% of the previous year. The rate rapidly recovered as the program intensified screening in the hard-to-reach regions less affected by the pandemic and expanded the outreach services. Other LMICs may emulate Bangladesh example. Customizing the information system developed for pandemic surveillance to collect cancer screening data will help them build back the screening programs better.","Basu, Partha; Lucas, Eric; Zhang, Li; Muwonge, Richard; Murillo, Raul; Nessa, Ashrafun",Prev Med,417,24

Why have some states have declared SOEs when others have not? Our legal analysis suggests that although international law provides states with the option of declaring an SOE and derogating from human rights obligations to ensure the life of the nation, other ways to handle the pandemic without declaring an SOE do exist. Our theoretical analysis leads to three main propositions centred on the impact of regional diffusion, democratic institutions, and pandemic preparedness. Our empirical analysis combines a range of quantitative data sources to analyse the SOE decisions of 180 states during the first half of 2020. The results suggest that states’ declarations of SOEs are driven by both external and internal factors. A permissive regional environment, characterised by many simultaneously declared SOEs, may reduce the reputational and political costs of emergency powers, making their employment more palatable. At the same time, internal characteristics, specifically democratic institutions and pandemic preparedness, have shaped governments’ decisions. Weak democracies with poor preparedness have been considerably more likely to opt for an SOE than dictatorships and robust democracies with higher preparedness. © 2021 The Author(s).

Texas ranks second in the count of confirmed US cases. This study examined the relationship between county-level racial/ethnic composition and COVID-19 testing/cases in Texas, adjusting for population-level demographic characteristics, health factors, and health care access measures. County-level testing and case data, obtained from the Texas Department of State Health Services, were combined with the 2020 Robert Wood Johnson Foundation County Health Rankings data. Outcome variables were tests per 100,000 population and cases per 100,000 population. The independent variable of interest was percent of racial and ethnic composition. Multivariable linear regression analyses were used. There was a statistically significant increase in COVID-19 testing/100,000 population with every 1% increase in the proportion of African Americans/Blacks (ß = 2065.4; P = 0.009), Asians (ß = 2056.2; P = 0.015), and Hispanics (ß = 1641.1; P = 764.7). After controlling for county characteristics and cases/100,000 population, these relationships were no longer significant.

Infiltration and spread of SARS-CoV-2 are based on the interaction between the virus' structural protein S and the cell's receptor-angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), with the simultaneous involvement of human trans-membrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2). Many scientific reports stress the importance of elevated recruitment and activity of neutrophils, which can form extracellular neutrophil traps (NETs) playing a significant role in the mechanism of combating pathogens, in the pathogenesis of COVID-19. Excessive generation of NETs during prolonged periods of inflammation predisposes for the occurrence of undesirable reactions including thromboembolic complications and damage to surrounding tissues and organs. Within the present manuscript, we draw attention to the impact of NET generation on the severe course of COVID-19 in patients with concurrent cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. Additionally, we indicate the necessity to explore not only the cellular but also the molecular bases of COVID-19 pathogenesis, which may aid the development of dedicated therapies meant to improve chances for the successful treatment of patients. We also present new directions of research into medications that display NETs formation regulatory properties as potential significant therapeutic strategies in the progress of COVID-19.","Janiuk, Karolina; Jablonska, Ewa; Garley, Marzena",,417,1

METHODS: Ultraviolet B (144 mJ/cm2) was used to irradiate rat corneal epithelial cells for 2 h. Cell morphology was observed on differential interference contrast microscopy, and the numbers of the different kinds of apoptotic cells were counted using the ImageJ software. Cell viability was measured with the 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5- diphenyl-2-H-tetrazolium bromide method. Cell apoptotic rate and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential were detected using flow cytometric analyses. The expression levels of 3 apoptotic genes were measured with real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction at different time points within 0-24 h after irradiation. RESULTS: After 144-mJ/cm2 ultraviolet B irradiation for 2 h, the expression levels of caspase-8 and Bax were highest at 0 h; furthermore, the mitochondrial membrane potential decreased at 0 h and remained constant for 6 h in a subsequent culture. At 6 h, caspase-3 was activated. The decrease in cell viability and increase in apoptotic rate peaked at 6 h. The caspase-3 expression level decreased within 12-24 h, which led to a decline in apoptotic rate and change in apoptotic stage. CONCLUSIONS: The corneal epithelial cells exhibited rapid apoptosis after ultraviolet B irradiation, which was associated with both extrinsic and intrinsic pathways.","Du, Shaobo; Li, Jiande; Chen, Linchi; Niu, Zhanyu; Gao, Lan",Arq. bras. oftalmol,417,24

Past coronavirus epidemics namely Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome have also been severe on older people. These epidemics lasted for only a limited period, however, and have proven short lived in the memories of both the public and public health systems. No lessons were learnt to mitigate the impact of future epidemics of such nature, on older people. This complacency we feel has claimed the lives of many older people during the current COVID-19 global epidemic. The nature of risks associated with acquiring infections and associated mortality among older people in respiratory epidemic situations are varied and of serious concern. Our commentary identifies demographic, biological, behavioural, social and healthcare-related determinants, which increase the vulnerability of older people to respiratory epidemics. We acknowledge that these determinants will likely vary between older people in high- and low-middle income countries. Notwithstanding these variations, we call for urgent action to mitigate the impact of epidemics on older people and preserve their health and dignity. Intersectoral programmes that recognise the special needs of older people and in unique contexts such as care homes must be developed and implemented, with the full participation and agreement of older people. COVID-19 has created upheaval, challenging humanity and threatening the lives, rights, and well-being of older people.

The effects of combination treatment with baricitinib, a Janus kinase inhibitor, plus remdesivir are not known. METHODS: We conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial evaluating baricitinib plus remdesivir in hospitalized adults with Covid-19. All the patients received remdesivir (&#8804;10 days) and either baricitinib (&#8804;14 days) or placebo (control). The primary outcome was the time to recovery. The key secondary outcome was clinical status at day 15. RESULTS: A total of 1033 patients underwent randomization (with 515 assigned to combination treatment and 518 to control). Patients receiving baricitinib had a median time to recovery of 7 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 6 to 8), as compared with 8 days (95% CI, 7 to 9) with control (rate ratio for recovery, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.01 to 1.32; P = 0.03), and a 30% higher odds of improvement in clinical status at day 15 (odds ratio, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.0 to 1.6). Patients receiving high-flow oxygen or noninvasive ventilation at enrollment had a time to recovery of 10 days with combination treatment and 18 days with control (rate ratio for recovery, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.10 to 2.08). The 28-day mortality was 5.1% in the combination group and 7.8% in the control group (hazard ratio for death, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.39 to 1.09). Serious adverse events were less frequent in the combination group than in the control group (16.0% vs. 21.0%; difference, -5.0 percentage points; 95% CI, -9.8 to -0.3; P = 0.03), as were new infections (5.9% vs. 11.2%; difference, -5.3 percentage points; 95% CI, -8.7 to -1.9; P = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS: Baricitinib plus remdesivir was superior to remdesivir alone in reducing recovery time and accelerating improvement in clinical status among patients with Covid-19, notably among those receiving high-flow oxygen or noninvasive ventilation. The combination was associated with fewer serious adverse events.

METHODS: Clinical and electrophysiological findings of 24 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection and AIDP (S-AIDP) and of 48 control AIDP (C-AIDP) without SARS-CoV-2 infection were compared. RESULTS: S-AIDP patients more frequently developed respiratory failure (83.3% vs. 25%, P=0.000) and required intensive care unit (ICU) hospitalization (58.3% vs. 31.3%, P=0.000). In C-AIDP, distal motor latencies (DMLs) were more frequently prolonged (70.9% vs. 26.2%, P=0.000) whereas in S-AIDP distal compound muscle action potential (dCMAP) durations were more frequently increased (49.5% vs. 32.4%, P=0.002) and F waves were more often absent (45.6% vs. 31.8%, P=0.011). Presence of nerves with increased dCMAP duration and normal or slightly prolonged DML was elevenfold higher in S-AIDP (31.1% vs. 2.8%, P=0.000);11 S-AIDP patients showed this pattern in 2 nerves. CONCLUSION: Increased dCMAP duration, thought to be a marker of acquired demyelination, can also be oserved in critical illness myopathy. In S-AIDP patients, an increased dCMAP duration dissociated from prolonged DML, suggests additional muscle fiber conduction slowing, possibly due to a COVID-19-related hyperinflammatory state. Absent F waves, at least in some S-AIDP patients, may reflect &#945;-motor neuron hypoexcitability because of immobilization during the ICU stay. These features should be considered in the electrodiagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 patients with weakness, to avoid misdiagnosis.","Uncini, Antonino; Foresti, Camillo; Frigeni, Barbara; Storti, Benedetta; Servalli, Maria Cristina; Gazzina, Stefano; Cosentino, Giuseppe; Bianchi, Francesca; Del Carro, Ubaldo; Alfonsi, Enrico; Piccinelli, Stefano Cotti; De Maria, Giovanni; Padovani, Alessandro; Filosto, Massimiliano; Ippoliti, Luigi",Neurophysiol Clin,417,5

We also investigated the associations between socio-demographic characteristics and support for using telemedicine in this context and explored factors that influenced respondents' attitudes on the topic. STUDY DESIGN: In a nationally representative, web-based survey of US adults (n = 711), we asked open- and closed-ended questions about using telemedicine to prescribe medication abortion during COVID-19. We used multinomial logistic regression to assess the relationship between socio-demographic characteristics, endorsement of abortion labels, and political affiliation and support for telemedicine in this circumstance. Then, we conducted content and thematic analyses with the open-ended data to explore what influenced respondents' opinions. RESULTS: Overall, 332 (44%) of respondents supported using telemedicine for medication abortion during the pandemic; 237 (35%) opposed and 138 (21%) were unsure. Respondents who identified as prochoice were more likely to support using telemedicine for abortion during the pandemic than those who identified as prolife were to oppose it in this context (RRR 2.95; 95% CI 1.31-6.64). Via our content and thematic analysis, we identified that concerns about safety, the legitimacy of telemedicine, and the belief that abortion should occur as early in the pregnancy as possible influenced respondents' beliefs about using telemedicine for medication abortion. CONCLUSIONS: More respondents supported using telemedicine for medication abortion during COVID-19 than opposed it. Among respondents who expressed support, most thought that medication abortion was safe and that telemedicine was equivalent to the in-person provision of care. IMPLICATIONS: There appears to be support among US adults for the provision of medication abortion via telemedicine during COVID-19. Policymakers may consider public sentiment as well as clinical evidence when considering legislation about abortion.","LaRoche, Kathryn J; Jozkowski, Kristen N; Crawford, Brandon L; Haus, Katherine R",Contraception,417,13

The mean (confidence interval [CI]) of age and gestational age of admission (GA) in pregnant women was 33 (28-37) years old and 36 (34-37) weeks, respectively. Pregnant women show the same manifestations of COVID-19 as non-pregnant adult patients. Fever (pregnant: 75.5%; non-pregnant: 74%) and cough (pregnant: 48.5%; non-pregnant: 53.5%) are the most common symptoms in both groups followed by myalgia (26.5%) and chill (25%) in pregnant and dysgeusia (27%) and fatigue (26.5%) in non-pregnant patients. Pregnant women are less probable to show cough (odds ratio [OR] 0.7; 95% CI 0.67-0.75), fatigue (OR: 0.58; CI: 0.54-0.61), sore throat (OR: 0.66; CI: 0.61-0.7), headache (OR: 0.55; CI: 0.55-0.58) and diarrhea (OR: 0.46; CI: 0.4-0.51) than non-pregnant adult patients. The most common imaging found in pregnant women is ground-glass opacity (57%) and in non-pregnant patients is consolidation (76%). Pregnant women have higher proportion of leukocytosis (27% vs. 14%), thrombocytopenia (18% vs. 12.5%) and have lower proportion of raised C-reactive protein (52% vs. 81%) compared with non-pregnant patients. Leucopenia and lymphopenia are almost the same in both groups. The most common comorbidity in pregnant patients is diabetes (18%) and in non-pregnant patients is hypertension (21%). Case fatality rate (CFR) of non-pregnant hospitalized patients is 6.4% (4.4-8.5), and mortality due to all-cause for pregnant patients is 11.3% (9.6-13.3). Regarding the complications of pregnancy, postpartum hemorrhage (54.5% [7-94]), caesarean delivery (48% [42-54]), preterm labor (25% [4-74]) and preterm birth (21% [12-34]) are in turn the most prevalent complications. Comparing the pregnancy outcomes show that caesarean delivery (OR: 3; CI: 2-5), low birth weight (LBW) (OR: 9; CI: 2.4-30) and preterm birth (OR: 2.5; CI: 1.5-3.5) are more probable in pregnant woman with COVID-19 than pregnant women without COVID-19. The most prevalent neonatal complications are neonatal intensive care unit admission (43% [2-96]), fetal distress (30% [12-58]) and LBW (25% [16-37]). The rate of vertical transmission is 5.3% (1.3-16), and the rate of positive SARS-CoV-2 test for neonates born to mothers with COVID-19 is 8% (4-16). Overall, pregnant patients present with the similar clinical characteristics of COVID-19 when compared with the general population, but they may be more asymptomatic. Higher odds of caesarean delivery, LBW and preterm birth among pregnant patients with COVID-19 suggest a possible association between COVID-19 infection and pregnancy complications. Low risk of vertical transmission is present, and SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in all conception products, particularly placenta and breast milk. Interpretations of these results should be done cautiously due to the heterogeneity between studies; however, we believe our findings can guide the prenatal and postnatal considerations for COVID-19 pregnant patients.","Jafari, Maryamsadat; Pormohammad, Ali; Sheikh Neshin, Saeideh Aghayari; Ghorbani, Saied; Bose, Deepanwita; Alimohammadi, Shohreh; Basirjafari, Sedigheh; Mohammadi, Mehdi; Rasmussen-Ivey, Cody; Razizadeh, Mohammad Hossein; Nouri-Vaskeh, Masoud; Zarei, Mohammad",Rev Med Virol,417,1

It can be induced by bacteria, fungi or viruses. We hypothesized that the assessment of MR-proADM, with or without other inflammatory cytokines, as part of a clinical assessment of COVID-19 patients at hospital admission, may assist in identifying those likely to develop severe disease. A pragmatic retrospective analysis was performed on a complete data set from 111 patients admitted to Udine University Hospital, in northern Italy, from 25th March to 15th May 2020, affected by SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. Clinical scoring systems (SOFA score, WHO disease severity class, SIMEU clinical phenotype), cytokines (IL-6, IL-1b, IL-8, TNF-&#945;), and MR-proADM were measured. Demographic, clinical and outcome data were collected for analysis. At multivariate analysis, high MR-proADM levels were significantly associated with negative outcome (death or orotracheal intubation, IOT), with an odds ratio of 4.284 [1.893-11.413], together with increased neutrophil count (OR = 1.029 [1.011-1.049]) and WHO disease severity class (OR = 7.632 [5.871-19.496]). AUROC analysis showed a good discriminative performance of MR-proADM (AUROC: 0.849 [95% Cl 0.771-0.730]; p < 0.0001). The optimal value of MR-proADM to discriminate combined event of death or IOT is 0.895 nmol/l, with a sensitivity of 0.857 [95% Cl 0.728-0.987] and a specificity of 0.687 [95% Cl 0.587-0.787]. This study shows an association between MR-proADM levels and the severity of COVID-19. The assessment of MR-proADM combined with clinical scoring systems could be of great value in triaging, evaluating possible escalation of therapies, and admission avoidance or inclusion into trials. Larger prospective and controlled studies are needed to confirm these findings.","Sozio, Emanuela; Tascini, Carlo; Fabris, Martina; D039,; Aurizio, Federica; De Carlo, Chiara; Graziano, Elena; Bassi, Flavio; Sbrana, Francesco; Ripoli, Andrea; Pagotto, Alberto; Giacinta, Alessandro; Gerussi, Valentina; Visentini, Daniela; De Stefanis, Paola; Merelli, Maria; Saeed, Kordo; Curcio, Francesco",Sci Rep,417,1

We analyzed Facebook comments related to the five events of the introduction of COVID-19 vaccines—announcements of the efficacy of the Pfizer-BioNTech (09.11.2020), Moderna (16.11.2020), and AstraZeneca (23.11.2020) vaccines, registration of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine by the European Medicines Agency (21.12.2020), and the first vaccination in Poland (27.12.2020). We collected the comments from fanpages of the biggest Polish media and then established their main anti-vaccine themes. We found that the negative arguments about COVID-19 vaccines can be divided into 12 categories. Seven of them are universal and also apply to other vaccines but five are new and COVID-19’ specific. The frequency of arguments from a given category varied over time. We also noticed that, while the comments were mostly negative, the reactions were positive. Created codebook of anti-vaccine COVID-19 arguments can be used to monitor the attitude of society towards COVID-19 vaccines. Real-time monitoring of social media is important because the popularity of certain arguments on Facebook changes rapidly over time.","Wawrzuta, Dominik Jaworski Mariusz Gotlib Joanna Panczyk Mariusz",Vaccines,417,24

The population is divided in 3 compartments regarding their alcohol consumption, namely Susceptible individuals S (nonconsumers), Moderated drinkers M and Risk drinkers R. The transitions among those states are rules by probabilities. Despite the simplicity of the model, we observed the occurrence of two distinct nonequilibrium phase transitions to absorbing states. One of these states is composed only by Susceptible individuals S, with no drinkers ($M=R=0$). On the other hand, the other absorbing state is composed only by Risk drinkers R ($S=M=0$). Between these two steady states, we have the coexistence of the three subpopulations S, M and R.

Data for this cross-sectional study come from a community-based online survey of COVID-19 isolated people (N = 328), who are not infected with the 2019-nCoV virus. We applied correlation and moderating effect for data analysis and found that cognitive reappraisal negatively moderated the relationship between perceived stress and anxiety symptoms. These results give us a new perspective on understanding the relationship between anxiety symptoms and perceived stress by clarifying the protective function of cognitive reappraisal. It buffers the induced negative emotion when COVID-19 isolated people perceive overpressure, and thus instigates future research into targeted clinical interventions, which aim to cultivate cognitive reappraisal skills for those isolated people in the face of stressful events or crisis events.","Xu, Chen; Xu, Yanjun; Xu, Song; Zhang, Qianhui; Liu, Xiaotong; Shao, Yifan; Xu, Xiaoxiao; Peng, Li; Li, Min",Front.

Cardiac dysfunction is commonly seen in these patients, often presenting as clinical heart failure. Accordingly, we aim to provide a comprehensive review on COVID-19 myocarditis and its long-term heart failure sequelae. RECENT FINDINGS: Several suspected cases of COVID-19 myocarditis have been reported. It is often not clear if the acute myocardial dysfunction is caused by myocarditis or secondary to generalized inflammatory state of cytokine release or microvascular thrombotic angiopathy. Ischemia may also need to be ruled out. Regardless, myocardial dysfunction in these patients is associated with poor overall prognosis. Laboratory testing, echocardiography, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, and even endomyocardial biopsy may be needed for timely diagnosis. Several treatment strategies have been described, including both supportive and targeted therapies. SUMMARY: COVID-19 can cause a spectrum of ventricular dysfunction ranging from mild disease to fulminant myocarditis with hemodynamic instability. Future research is needed to understand the true prevalence of COVID-19 myocarditis, as well as to better define various diagnostic protocols and treatment strategies.","Liu, Jing; Deswal, Anita; Khalid, Umair",Curr Opin Cardiol,417,24

SARS-CoV-2 enters the cardiovascular system by binding to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. The pathogenic cardiovascular mechanism of the virus involves systemic inflammation via a cytokine storm and direct myocardial injury. The most frequently reported cardiovascular complications of COVID-19 include acute myocardial injury, myocarditis, myocardial infarction, heart failure, cardiomyopathy, arrhythmias, and venous thromboembolic events. Also, pre-existing cardiovascular disease in COVID-19 patients is a prime marker for attaining severe disease and is associated with high mortality rates. Lastly, the medications under investigation for COVID-19 may have their individual cardiovascular adverse effects. We hereby present a concise literature review that summarizes recent peer-reviewed and pre-print articles published on the cardiovascular implications of COVID-19.

This prompted investigation of whether or not asymptomatic disease results in measurable immune activation post-infection. Immune activation following asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection was characterized through a comparative investigation of the immune cell transcriptomes from 43 asymptomatic seropositive and 52 highly exposed seronegative individuals from the same community 4-6 weeks following a superspreading event. Few of the 95 individuals had underlying health issues. One seropositive individual reported Cystic Fibrosis and one individual reported Incontinentia pigmenti. No evidence of immune activation was found in asymptomatic seropositive individuals with the exception of the Cystic Fibrosis patient. There were no statistically significant differences in immune transcriptomes between asymptomatic seropositive and highly exposed seronegative individuals. Four positive controls, mildly symptomatic seropositive individuals whose blood was examined 3 weeks following infection, showed immune activation. Negative controls were four seronegative individuals from neighboring communities without COVID-19. All individuals remained in their usual state of health through a five-month follow-up after sample collection. In summary, whole blood transcriptomes identified individual immune profiles within a community population and showed that asymptomatic infection within a super-spreading event was not associated with enduring immunological activation.","Lee, Hye Kyung; Knabl, Ludwig; Pipperger, Lisa; Volland, Andre; Furth, Priscilla A; Kang, Keunsoo; Smith, Harold E; Bellmann, Romuald; Bernhard, Christina; Kaiser, Norbert; Gänzer, Hannes; Ströhle, Mathias; Walser, Andreas; von Laer, Dorothee; Hennighausen, Lothar",Sci Rep,417,32

Mouthwash fluid has been reported as an alternative to nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs. We compared mouthwash fluid with a combined oro-nasopharyngeal swab regarding test performance. METHODS: In a large refugee facility, we retested individuals with a previous positive test for SARS-CoV-2 and their quarantined close contacts. All individuals were asymptomatic at the time of testing. First, a mouthwash (gargling for at least 5 s) with sterile water was performed. Then, with a single flocked swab the back of the throat and subsequently the nasopharynx were sampled. Samples were inactivated and analysed on a Roche cobas 6800® system with the Roche SARS-CoV-2 test. RESULTS: Of 76 individuals, 39 (51%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by oro-nasopharyngeal swab. Mouthwash detected 13 of 76 (17%) infections, but did not detect any additional infection. Samples that were positive in both tests, had lower cycle threshold (Ct)-values for oro-nasopharyngeal samples, indicating a higher virus concentration, compared to samples only positive in oro-nasopharyngeal swabs. CONCLUSION: Mouthwash is not as sensitive as combined oro-nasopharyngeal swab in detecting upper respiratory tract infection.","Michel, Wiebke; Färber, Jacqueline; Dilas, Milica; Heuft, Hans-Gert; Tammer, Ina; Baar, Jannik; Kaasch, Achim J",Infection,417,11

This need is aggravated during the current pandemic crisis, which pushes policymakers and private citizens to seek social-distancing compliant urban mobility services, such as electric bikes and scooter sharing offerings. However, predicting the number of incoming and outgoing vehicles for different city areas is challenging due to the nonlinear spatial and temporal dependencies typical of urban mobility patterns. In this work, we propose STREED-Net, a novel deep learning network with a multi-attention (spatial and temporal) mechanism that effectively captures and exploits complex spatial and temporal patterns in mobility data.

We assessed changes in hospital resource utilization and estimated the future backlog of cases in the colorectal surgery division of a large safety-net hospital. METHODS: Patients undergoing colorectal procedures from 3/16/20 to 4/23/20 (COVID) were compared with those from January through June 2018 (historical). Resource utilization rates were calculated by weekly case volumes and hospital stay in each group. A future catch up timeframe and new wait times from scheduling to surgery dates were calculated. RESULTS: The COVID and historical groups included 13 and 239 patients, respectively. The COVID group showed a 74% relative decrease in weekly surgical case rates (9.2 to 2.4 patients per week). Both groups had similar lengths of stay. The COVID group had a longer average ICU stay (1.4 ± 2.5 days vs. 0.4 ± 1.2 days, P = 0.016) and a 132% increase in ICU resource utilization. Overall, the COVID group had a 48% relative decrease in hospital resource utilization, owing to reduced volume but higher acuity. If the surgery numbers returns to pre-COVID volumes, the calculated ""catch up"" times range from 4.6 weeks to 9.2 weeks. Wait times for new cases may increase by 70% compared with pre-COVID levels. CONCLUSION: Cancelling elective colorectal surgeries results in a decrease in overall but increase in ICU-specific resource utilization. Though necessary, cancellations result in an increasing backlog of cases that poses significant future logistical and clinical challenges in an already overburdened safety-net hospital. Effective triage systems will be critical to prioritize this backlog.","Yoon, Dong Hum; Koller, Sarah; Duldulao, Philip Marjun N; Ault, Glenn T; Lee, Sang W; Cologne, Kyle G",J. gastrointest. surg,417,1

To address this issue, a new COVID-19 machine-readable dataset known as the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19) has been released. Based on this, our objective was to build a computable co-occurrence network embeddings to assist association detection among COVID-19-related biomedical entities. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Leveraging a Linked Data version of CORD-19 (ie, CORD-19-on-FHIR), we first utilized SPARQL to extract co-occurrences among chemicals, diseases, genes, and mutations and build a co-occurrence network. We then trained the representation of the derived co-occurrence network using node2vec with 4 edge embeddings operations (L1, L2, Average, and Hadamard). Six algorithms (decision tree, logistic regression, support vector machine, random forest, naïve Bayes, and multilayer perceptron) were applied to evaluate performance on link prediction. An unsupervised learning strategy was also developed incorporating the t-SNE (t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding) and DBSCAN (density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise) algorithms for case studies. RESULTS: The random forest classifier showed the best performance on link prediction across different network embeddings. For edge embeddings generated using the Average operation, random forest achieved the optimal average precision of 0.97 along with a F1 score of 0.90. For unsupervised learning, 63 clusters were formed with silhouette score of 0.128. Significant associations were detected for 5 coronavirus infectious diseases in their corresponding subgroups. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we constructed COVID-19-centered co-occurrence network embeddings. Results indicated that the generated embeddings were able to extract significant associations for COVID-19 and coronavirus infectious diseases.","Oniani, David; Jiang, Guoqian; Liu, Hongfang; Shen, Feichen",J Am Med Inform Assoc,417,1

Although many studies focus primarily on loneliness, patterns of social isolation-particularly physical and digital isolation-are understudied. We examined changes in social isolation, physical isolation, digital isolation, and loneliness in US adults over 50 before and during the lockdown. METHODS: Two waves of the Health and Retirement Study, a national panel sample of US adults over 50 years old, were used. Fixed-effects regression models were fitted to identify within-person change from 2016 to 2020 to examine the impact of social distancing policies during the pandemic. RESULTS: There was an increase in physical isolation and social isolation among respondents during the COVID-19 social distancing policies. However, respondents experienced no change in digital isolation or loneliness. The increase in physical isolation was only present for people with high COVID-19 concern whereas people with low concern experienced no change in physical isolation. DISCUSSION: Despite an increase in physical isolation due to the social distancing policies, US adults aged over 50 stayed connected through digital contact and were resilient in protecting themselves from loneliness.","Peng, Siyun; Roth, Adam R",,417,16

DESIGN: Systematic review with meta-analysis. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PEDro and The Cochrane (CENTRAL) databases from inception to 22 October 2018. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: RCTs evaluating any intervention aiming to prevent future impact of LBP, reporting an outcome measure of LBP intensity and/or disability measured at least 3 months post-randomisation, and the intervention group must be compared with a group that received no intervention/placebo or minimal intervention. Trials restricting recruitment to participants with current LBP were excluded. RESULTS: 27 published reports of 25 different trials including a total of 8341 participants fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The pooled results, from three RCTs (612 participants), found moderate-quality evidence that an exercise programme can prevent future LBP intensity (mean difference (MD) -4.50; 95% CI -7.26 to -1.74), and from 4 RCTs (471 participants) that an exercise and education programme can prevent future disability due to LBP (MD -6.28; 95% CI -9.51 to -3.06). It is uncertain whether prevention programmes improve future quality of life (QoL) and workability due to the overall low-quality and very low-quality available evidence. CONCLUSIONS: This review provides moderate-quality evidence that an exercise programme, and a programme combining exercise and education, are effective to reduce future LBP intensity and associated disability. It is uncertain whether prevention programmes can improve future QoL and workability. Further high-quality RCTs evaluating prevention programmes aiming to reduce future impact of LBP are needed.","de Campos, Tarcisio F; Maher, Chris G; Fuller, Joel T; Steffens, Daniel; Attwell, Stephanie; Hancock, Mark J",Br. j. sports med,417,16

Objective: This study was undertaken to investigate the impact of lockdown on the disease activity, caregiver perceptions and the quality of life of patients with PD. Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted from June till September 2020. Sixty-four patients with PD and caregivers were interviewed telephonically after obtaining consent. The responses were recorded by means of a structured questionnaire. Non-motor symptoms scale (NMSS) and the Parkinson Disease Questinnaire-8 (PDQ-8) were applied. PDQ-8 severity index (PDQ-8 SI) scores were expressed as percentage of the raw PDQ-8 score of the total score. Data were analsyed by using SPSS version 20.0. Results: Of 64 patients, 39 (60.9%) were men and 25 (39.1%) were women. The overall median age of the patients was 65 (55.25-69.75) years. The median duration was 48 (30-84) months. Twenty-six (40.6%) patients reported symptomatic worsening during the lockdown period. Slowness in activities of daily living and walking worsened in 15 (57.7%) and 14 (53.8%) patients, respectively, while tremors increased in 12 (46.2%) patients. Mood and sleep disturbances were the most common non-motor symptoms to worsen. Increase in non-motor symptoms and the NMSS total score were independent predictors of PDQ-8 scores. Increase in non-motor symptoms during the lockdown was an independent predictor of the highest quartile of PDQ-8 SI scores. Conclusions: Motor and non-motor symptoms have worsened in patients with PD during the lockdown. The increase in non-motor symptoms was independently associated with poorer quality of life among patients with PD during the lockdown.","Saluja, A.; Parihar, J.; Garg, D.; Dhamija, R.

The angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a functional receptor for SARS-CoV-2, but mice are resistant to the infection because their ACE2 is incompatible with the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein . METHODS: SARS-CoV-2 was passaged in BALB/c mice to obtain mouse-adapted virus strain. Complete genome deep sequencing of different generations of viruses was performed to characterize the dynamics of the adaptive mutations in SARS-CoV-2. Indirect immunofluorescence analysis and Biolayer interferometry experiments determined the binding affinity of mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 WBP-1 RBD to mouse ACE2 and human ACE2. Finally, we tested whether TLR7/8 agonist Resiquimod (R848) could also inhibit the replication of WBP-1 in the mouse model. FINDINGS: The mouse-adapted strain WBP-1 showed increased infectivity in BALB/c mice and led to severe interstitial pneumonia. We characterized the dynamics of the adaptive mutations in SARS-CoV-2 and demonstrated that Q493K and Q498H in RBD significantly increased its binding affinity towards mouse ACE2. Additionally, the study tentatively found that the TLR7/8 agonist Resiquimod was able to protect mice against WBP-1 challenge. Therefore, this mouse-adapted strain is a useful tool to investigate COVID-19 and develop new therapies. INTERPRETATION: We found for the first time that the Q493K and Q498H mutations in the RBD of WBP-1 enhanced its interactive affinities with mACE2. The mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 provides a valuable tool for the evaluation of novel antiviral and vaccine strategies. This study also tentatively verified the antiviral activity of TLR7/8 agonist Resiquimod against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and in vivo.

Removed population is split into recovered and death populations allowing a better comprehension of real situations. Besides, the total population is reduced based on the number of deaths. Hospital infrastructure is also included into the mathematical description allowing the consideration of collapse scenarios. Initially, a model verification is carried out calibrating system parameters with data from China outbreak that is considered a benchmark due the availability of data for the entire cycle. Afterward, Brazil outbreak is of concern, calibrating the model and developing numerical simulations. Results show several scenarios highlighting the importance of social isolation and hospital infrastructure. System dynamics has a strong sensitivity to transmission rate showing the importance of numerical simulations to guide public health decision strategies. Results also show that complex dynamical responses can emerge due to the oscillations of the transmission rate, being associated with distinct infection subsequent waves.","Pacheco, Pedro M C L; Savi, Marcelo A; Savi, Pedro V",Nonlinear Dyn,417,20

To better understand this pathology, we prospectively analyzed of a cohort of cancer patients with neurologic manifestations of COVID-19, including a targeted proteomics analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid. We find that cancer patients with neurologic sequelae of COVID-19 harbor leptomeningeal inflammatory cytokines in the absence of viral neuroinvasion. The majority of these inflammatory mediators are driven by type II interferon and are known to induce neuronal injury in other disease states. In these patients, levels of matrix metalloproteinase-10 within the spinal fluid correlate with the degree of neurologic dysfunction. Furthermore, this neuroinflammatory process persists weeks after convalescence from acute respiratory infection. These prolonged neurologic sequelae following systemic cytokine release syndrome lead to long-term neurocognitive dysfunction.

We focused primarily on four areas of vulnerabilities in Bangladesh: The garment industry, urban slums, social exclusion, and pre-existing health conditions. The result implicated that the country would take time to recover its economy due to the vulnerabilities mentioned above, and many people in Bangladesh would not be able to tolerate the current situation because they do not have enough reserves to do so. We concluded that if at least some Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) had been at least partly attained, the situation would not be as dire as it is now.

Millions have died from and tens of millions more have been infected globally by the COVID-19 pandemic. This has led to an urgent search for COVID-19 vaccines and treatments by the scientific and political communities and civil society. Through elements of events study and document and critical discourse analysis, this paper investigates the COVID-19 vaccines' regulatory emergency use authorisation and/or conditional marketing authorisation (regulatory authorisation) regimes and the contestations thereof. The key finding is that there was a regulatory authorisation rush, with at least 62, mostly high-income countries, doing so in 40 days from 2 December 2020-10 January 2021. This has led to one senior USA official describing the United Kingdom pioneer regulatory authorisation of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine as 'too quick'. Regulatory authorisation regimes took place amid severe civil society contestations and appropriate political pressure. The paper recommends that as the COVID-19 vaccines' regulatory authorisation continue in 2021, national vaccines and treatments regulatory bodies must be informed by science, with governments, civil society, politicians and other key stakeholders taking responsibility to educate the masses and continue taking the necessary precautions.","Nhamo, Godwell; Sibanda, Mncengeli",Glob Public Health,417,6

At baseline, immediately after treatment and at 7 and 14 days of twice-daily brushing of the test or control toothpaste the sensitivity of 2 test teeth was measured following iced-water (Schiff and VAS) and tactile (Yeaple probe) stimuli, and a whole mouth plaque score was obtained. Participants also completed a whole-mouth VAS and DHEQ15 quality of life questionnaire at baseline, 7 and 14 days.ResultsBoth toothpastes reduced DH in test teeth, but pain reduction in the test group was significantly better at all timepoints and by all measures (p = 0.005, tooth-level VAS immediately after brushing;p &lt; 0.001 all other comparisons). There was a relative risk reduction of Schiff sensitivity of 55 % immediately after brushing which rose to 81 % after 7 and 88.6 % after 14 days (all p &lt; 0.001). There were no differences in plaque, whole mouth VAS or DHEQ15 scores at any time point.ConclusionThis study demonstrated the efficacy of an aluminium lactate/potassium nitrate/hydroxylapatite toothpaste compared to a potassium nitrate control toothpaste for the prevention of dentine hypersensitivity both immediately and over a 2 week period. This agent appears to have potential for pain alleviation from the common oral pain condition of DH and further research is warranted.Clinical significanceDH pain, whilst transient in nature, is arresting in magnitude, affecting quality of life. Daily application of efficacious toothpastes can relieve DH pain however, as yet, there is no gold standard treatment. The results of this study support further investigation of an aluminium lactate/potassium nitrate/hydroxylapatite toothpaste for DH management.","Seong, Joon Newcombe Robert G.; Foskett, Helen L.; Davies, Maria West Nicola X.",Journal of Dentistry,417,24

It enters the cell by binding its protein S with angiotensin-converted enzyme receptors. It is transmitted through direct contact and respiratory drops. The most affected population so far are older adults and people with chronic conditions. The objective of this research is to analyze the possible association between the structure of the population pyramid, the Gross Domestic Product, the type of isolation and screening used to detect Covid-19 in the countries with the highest and lowest mortality from this disease. Design and Methods: Some variables take part in the Covid- 19 mortality worldwide, such as the population structure, expressed in the population pyramid by country, the type of isolation adopted in each nation, the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) as well as the type of screening that is implemented in the different countries analyzed. Results: After analyzing the mean difference in the countries with a regressive and progressive population pyramid, an association was identified between the regressive population pyramid structure and the higher mortality rate (p<0.001). Conclusions: The countries with a progressive population pyramid are the most benefited by making their population more screened since the mortality rate decreases significantly compared to the countries with less attribution (p<0.036).","Madrazo Cabo, José Manuel; Monter Valera, Nuvia Adriana; Hernández Sánchez, Edith Jocelyn; Ruiz Sánchez, Mariola; Sánchez Machorro, Gabriela; Kurezyn Díaz, Crishelen",J Public Health Res,417,10

METHODS: The evaluations were carried out by means of an online survey, with a sample of 3480 persons in the first data collection and 1041 and 569 persons in the successive evaluation periods. The presence of depressive symptoms, anxiety and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) was evaluated by means of screening tests. Sociodemographic data, Covid-19 variables, loneliness, psychological well-being, social support, discrimination and a sense of belonging, were collected. RESULTS: Depressive symptoms increased significantly throughout the confinement, decreasing at the last assessment but not dropping to previous levels. In anxiety, there are no significant changes between the three evaluations, but a downward trend can be seen over time. Regarding the symptomatology of PTSD, a downward trend is observed throughout the three evaluations, with significantly lower scores between the first and third assessments. The different regression models developed reveal the importance of perceived loneliness and spiritual well-being as the main predictors of mental health, as well as the importance of the lower age for depression and the female gender for anxiety and PSTD. CONCLUSIONS: This research shows that the pandemic has had a negative impact on our mental health, which still does not seem to be at pre-crisis levels, although it has improved as the emergency situation subsides. These results underline the importance of paying greater attention to mental health, and reveal key variables such as spiritual well-being and perceived loneliness in which to intervene from different care services, as well as younger people and women as vulnerable groups on which to focus more attention.","González-Sanguino, C; Ausín, B; Castellanos, M A; Saiz, J; Muñoz, M",Prog Neuropsychopharmacol Biol Psychiatry,417,20

In this introductory article, we provide a broad sociology of Covid-19, paying attention to the production of pandemics and the creation of vulnerabilities. We acknowledge the dystopian elements of the pandemic: it will provide opportunities for ‘disaster capitalists’ to profit, it will enhance certain forms of surveillance, and it will impact some constituencies far more negatively than others (here we pay particular attention to the pandemic’s gendered consequences). Yet there are also resources for hope. We are witnessing altruistic acts the world over, as mutual aid groups form to render assistance where needed. Notions of welfare reform, progressive taxation, nationalisation and universal basic income now seem more politically palatable. Some even predict the imminent demise of neoliberalism.

At New York Presbyterian Brooklyn Methodist Hospital, we needed to develop an innovative system of how to safely discharge the massive influx of patients. Inundation of patient care with limited manpower and resources forced us to align with a third-party vendor, around-the-clock alert, to make remote patient monitoring (RPM) possible. Each patient was prescribed a pulse oximeter and nurses were assigned to monitor vital signs, speak to patients, and escalate to physicians if required. Results: We enrolled 50 patients, of whom 13 were escalated resulting in 3 emergency room visits and 1 readmission. We had a high compliance rate with high patient satisfaction in postsurveys. Discussion: Our program was unique in that it utilized telemedicine for regular patient follow-up, along with RPM through a third-party vendor. Patients were able to be safely discharged home with close follow-up through regularly obtained vitals with access to a 24/7 hotline for any emergencies, possibly preventing readmissions. Limitations include a small sample size population. Conclusions: Our experience shows that in a short period despite lack of resources, telehealth and RPM's concurrent use with a third-party vendor could be successfully utilized for safe discharges with high patient satisfaction.","Kodama, Rich; Arora, Sunny; Anand, Swati; Choudhary, Abu; Weingarten, Jeremy; Francesco, Notar; Chiricolo, Gerardo; Silber, Steven; Mehta, Parag H",Telemed. j. e. health,417,16

Visualization literacy skills are vital in understanding the world around us and constructing meaningful visualizations, yet, how to better develop these skills at an early age remains largely overlooked and understudied. Only recently has the visualization community started to fill this gap, resulting in preliminary studies and development of educational tools for use in early education. We add to these efforts through the exploration of gamification to support learning, and identify an opportunity to apply role-playing game-based designs by leveraging the presence of narratives in data-related problems involving visualizations. We study the effects of including narrative elements on learning through a technology probe, grounded in a set of design considerations stemming from visualization, game design, and education science. We create two versions of a game -- one with narrative elements and one without -- and evaluate our instances on 33 child participants between 11- to 13-years old using a between-subjects study design. Despite participants requiring double the amount of time to complete their game due to additional elements, the inclusion of such elements were found to improve engagement without sacrificing learning; our results indicate no significant differences in development of graph-reading skills, but significant differences in engagement and overall enjoyment of the game. We report observations and qualitative feedback collected, and note areas for improvement and room for future wook.","Huynh, Elaine; Nyhout, Angela; Ganea, Patricia; Chevalier, Fanny",,417,9

This disease occurs when high blood glucose levels cause damage to blood vessels in the retina. Computer-aided DR diagnosis is a promising tool for early detection of DR and severity grading, due to the great success of deep learning. However, most current DR diagnosis systems do not achieve satisfactory performance or interpretability for ophthalmologists, due to the lack of training data with consistent and fine-grained annotations. To address this problem, we construct a large fine-grained annotated DR dataset containing 2,842 images (FGADR). This dataset has 1,842 images with pixel-level DR-related lesion annotations, and 1,000 images with image-level labels graded by six board-certified ophthalmologists with intra-rater consistency. The proposed dataset will enable extensive studies on DR diagnosis. We set up three benchmark tasks for evaluation: 1. DR lesion segmentation; 2.

Networks with the new structure help us improve the understanding of the economic demand change, especially when the macroeconomic is dramatically influenced by exogenous shocks like the outbreak of COVID-19. At the beginning of the outbreak of COVID-19, in China's stock market, spillover effects from industry indices of sectors meeting the investment demand to those meeting the consumption demands rose significantly.

This study aims at comparing the ILI incidence of 2019-2020 influenza season with the incidence of COVID-19 cases in order to better understand the current epidemic and to evaluate whether the implementation of ILI surveillance system could succeed in early detection and monitoring of COVID-19 diffusion. METHODS: The distribution of ILI cases in the seasons 2017-2018, 2018-2019 and 2019-2020 was taken in consideration and the curve trends were compared and analyzed according to geographical areas, age groups and time differences. RESULTS: The curve trends presented a similar pattern up to the 9th week; in fact, a reduction in the ILI incidence rate was observed in the 2017-2018 and 2018-2019 season but in the 2019-2020 an increase in the reported ILI emerged. The relation between the numbers reported by 2019-2020 ILI surveillance and those reported for COVID-19 is supported by the curve trends, the correspondence between age groups, the correspondence by geographical location, and also by the results of the nasopharyngeal swab tests performed. DISCUSSION: The influenza surveillance system is an effective tool for early detection of COVID-19.

We discuss the ethical and practical considerations that clinicians employed in past infectious disease outbreaks, as well as general safety measures routinely practiced in the conduct of exposure therapy. During this time, concerns regarding the feasibility of ERP have emerged, especially with strict guidelines on social distancing and on following other preventative behaviors. While ERP may have to be modified to follow public health guidelines, this review outlines a) how ERP has been adapted in the context of other infectious triggers; b) the potential impacts on OCD patients of attenuated ERP, and c) minimizing concerns related to litigation. A case report is provided detailing ERP personalized given COVID-19 related considerations. In all, we advise against modifying therapies in ways that may jeopardize the efficacy of patient care or progress.","Sheu, Jessica C; McKay, Dean; Storch, Eric A",J Anxiety Disord,417,26

However, 38.4% and 27.8% exhibited minimal and severe depression respectively. The results of factor analysis with the varimax rotation method revealed three factors predicting 55.56% of the total variance of BDI-II, while two factors predicting 60.97% of the total variance of PSS-10. Cronbach's alpha values for BDI and PSS-10 were a = 0.93 and a = 0.58 respectively. In conclusion, the BDI-II is a reliable and valid assessment for measuring symptoms of depression in the general Moroccan population and also very important to pay more attention to the side effects of mandatory quarantine.","Maliki, I.; Elmsellem, H.; Hafez, B.; El-Moussaoui, A.; Kachmar, M.

C-C chemokine receptor type 2 (CCR2)-dependent monocyte trafficking plays an essential role in the establishment of CD8 TRMs in lungs of IAV-infected mice. Here, we used a combination adjuvant-based subunit vaccine strategy that evokes multifaceted (TC1/TC17/TH1/TH17) IAV nucleoprotein-specific lung TRMs to determine whether CCR2 and monocyte infiltration are essential for vaccine-induced TRM development and protective immunity to IAV in lungs. Following intranasal vaccination, neutrophils, monocytes, conventional dendritic cells (DCs), and monocyte-derived dendritic cells internalized and processed vaccine antigen in lungs. We found that basic leucine zipper ATF-like transcription factor 3 (BATF3)-dependent DCs were essential for eliciting T cell responses, but CCR2 deficiency enhanced the differentiation of CD127hi, KLRG-1lo, OX40+ve CD62L+ve, and mucosally imprinted CD69+ve CD103+ve effector and memory CD8 T cells in lungs and airways of vaccinated mice. Mechanistically, increased development of lung TRMs induced by CCR2 deficiency was linked to dampened expression of T-bet but not altered TCF-1 levels or T cell receptor signaling in CD8 T cells. T1/T17 functional programming, parenchymal localization of CD8/CD4 effector and memory T cells, recall T cell responses, and protective immunity to a lethal IAV infection were unaffected in CCR2-deficient mice. Taken together, we identified a negative regulatory role for CCR2 and monocyte trafficking in mucosal imprinting and differentiation of vaccine-induced TRMs. Mechanistic insights from this study may aid the development of T-cell-based vaccines against respiratory viral pathogens, including IAV and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). IMPORTANCE While antibody-based immunity to influenza A virus (IAV) is type and subtype specific, lung- and airway-resident memory T cells that recognize conserved epitopes in the internal viral proteins are known to provide heterosubtypic immunity. Hence, broadly protective IAV vaccines need to elicit robust T cell memory in the respiratory tract. We have developed a combination adjuvant-based IAV nucleoprotein vaccine that elicits strong CD4 and CD8 T cell memory in lungs and protects against H1N1 and H5N1 strains of IAV. In this study, we examined the mechanisms that control vaccine-induced protective memory T cells in the respiratory tract. We found that trafficking of monocytes into lungs might limit the development of antiviral lung-resident memory T cells following intranasal vaccination. These findings suggest that strategies that limit monocyte infiltration can potentiate vaccine-induced frontline T-cell immunity to respiratory viruses, such as IAV and SARS-CoV-2.","Lee, Woojong; Kingstad-Bakke, Brock; Kedl, Ross M; Kawaoka, Yoshihiro; Suresh, M",J Virol,417,1

We aim to evaluate the value of B cell-activating factor (BAFF) in paediatric IBD as a potential biomarker for follow-up. METHOD: We determined BAFF in serum and faeces and faecal calprotectin (CP) in 32 IBD children-16 Crohn's disease (CD) and 16 ulcerative colitis (UC). Twenty-six healthy children and 10 children with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) were included as controls. RESULTS: No differences were found in serum BAFF between IBD, IBS, and healthy group: 1037.35, 990.9 and 979.8 pg/ml, respectively, all p > 0.05, but faecal BAFF was higher in the IBD group: 15.1, 8.5 and 8.2 pg/ml, respectively, p < 0.05, and higher in the UC group (55.975 pg/ml) compared to the CD group (10.95 pg/ml), p = 0.015. Splitting the IBD group in relation to the CP level, the serum BAFF had no significantly different values between the subgroups, but the faecal BAFF was significantly higher in the >250 µg/g subgroup. Cut-off values of BAFF were calculated. CONCLUSION: Faecal BAFF is a promising marker for monitoring the children with IBD, higher levels of BAFF being correlated with high CP. IMPACT: Faecal BAFF is a promising marker in monitoring the children with IBD, higher levels of BAFF being correlated with high faecal calprotectin.To our knowledge, this is the first paediatric study concerning BAFF evaluation in IBD.Faecal BAFF levels could be considered a potential non-invasive marker in monitoring IBD activity in paediatric population with clinically mild or inactive disease.Fig. 1Box plots of faecal BAFF concentration in the whole group with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and distinctly on Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) groups compared with the control group.Fig. 2Box plots of serum BAFF concentration in the whole group with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and distinctly on Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) groups compared with the control group.Fig. 3Correlation between faecal calprotectin and faecal BAFF in relation to the whole group of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) (a), Crohn's disease (CD) (b) and ulcerative colitis (UC) (c).","Fodor, Ioana; Serban, Oana; Serban, Daniela E; Farcau, Dorin; Man, Sorin Claudiu; Dumitrascu, Dan Lucian",Pediatr. res,417,24

In such a context, the study of performances of available tests is urgently needed, as their use has just been initiated for seroprevalence assessment. The aim of this study was to compare four chemiluminescence immunoassays and one immunochromatography test for SARS-Cov-2 antibodies for the evaluation of the degree of diffusion of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Salerno Province (Campania Region, Italy). A total of 3,185 specimens from citizens were tested for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies as part of a screening program. Four automated immunoassays (Abbott and Liaison SARS-CoV-2 CLIA IgG and Roche and Siemens SARS-CoV-2 CLIA IgM/IgG/IgA assays) and one lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA Technogenetics IgG-IgM COVID-19) were used. Seroprevalence in the entire cohort was 2.41, 2.10, 1.82, and 1.85% according to the Liaison IgG, Abbott IgG, Siemens, and Roche total Ig tests, respectively. When we explored the agreement among the rapid tests and the serologic assays, we reported good agreement for Abbott, Siemens, and Roche (Cohen's Kappa coefficient 0.69, 0.67, and 0.67, respectively), whereas we found moderate agreement for Liaison (Cohen's kappa coefficient 0.58). Our study showed that Abbott and Liaison SARS-CoV-2 CLIA IgG, Roche and Siemens SARS-CoV-2 CLIA IgM/IgG/IgA assays, and LFIA Technogenetics IgG-IgM COVID-19 have good agreement in seroprevalence assessment.

During the outbreak, the urgency for developing candidate vaccines has brought distinct challenges to clinical development. An efficacy trial, which measures whether the vaccine reduces the incidence of disease, is ordinarily required to fully evaluate vaccine efficacy. However, emergency use may be possible if promising immunogenicity results are observed. A ring vaccination trial, which recruits subjects connected to a known case either socially or geographically, is a solution to evaluate vaccine efficacy and control the spread of the disease simultaneously although its conduct is challenging. Nevertheless, when COVID-19 becomes a recurrent epidemic, an 'individual-level' efficacy trial is preferred. Innovative statistical designs, including seamless design, platform trial, master protocol design, are helpful to accelerate clinical development. A seamless Phase I/II design has been applied in multiple COVID-19 vaccine studies to date. However, Phase II/III design should be done very carefully. The control of type I error, maintaining trial blinding and statistical methods leading to unbiased estimates should be pre-specified in the clinical protocol.

Although often subtle, lamina propria between and around the neoplastic glands (identified by plasma cells, scattered eosinophils, etc.) is frequent in cases with classic morphology, arguing (at least in such cases) in favor of adenoma extending into lymphoglandular complexes rather than true invasive carcinoma. Some have postulated that the tumor arises from M-cells, specialized epithelial cells overlying GALT, and others have suggested it represents a unique pathway to carcinoma, specific to the environmental conditions of epithelium overlying lymphoid tissue. Although both hypotheses are intriguing, definitive phenotypic and genetic support is currently lacking. To address these possibilities, we undertook whole exome sequencing and immunohistochemical characterization of a GALT neoplasm recently identified on our clinical service. We discovered well-known mutations in both APC and KRAS, as well as mutations in several Wnt pathway components (MED12, BCL9L, RFX4, DACT3). No immunohistochemical expression of GP2, a marker of M-cell differentiation, was identified. Expression of CDX2, SATB2, and the DNA mismatch repair proteins was observed, while expression of both CK7 and CK20 was absent. No PD-L1 expression was present on tumor cells, but PD-L1 expression was noted in a subset of tumor-adjacent mononuclear cells. Overall, the findings suggest that GALT neoplasms, although morphologically distinct, may be a precursor or early form of typical sporadic colon carcinoma.","Yaseen, Alae; Ladenheim, Alexander; Olson, Kristin A; Libertini, Stephen J; McPherson, John D; Matsukuma, Karen",Pathol Res Pract,417,1

SARS-CoV-2 shares many similarities with SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV). A viral replication complex containing non-structural proteins (nsps) is the toolbox for RNA replication and transcription of both coronaviruses. In both cases, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) domain of the coronaviral replication complex dictates the primary polymerase activity by cooperating with cofactors. The higher transmissibility and mortality due to SARS-CoV-2 are related to its higher RNA replication activity compared to SARS-CoV. The discrepancy between the RNA replication efficiency of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 can be understood by exploring interactions within their viral replication complexes. Our modeling of molecular interactions within the viral replication complexes of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 using molecular dynamics simulations suggests that in contrast to SARS-CoVnsp12, SARS-CoV2nsp12 prefers helices as the dominant interacting secondary motifs. The relative differences in nonbonded interactions between nsps could suggest viral RNA replication ability in coronaviruses.

Many studies have described how coronaviruses enter cells, but information on PEDV invasion strategies remains insufficient. Given that the differences in gene sequences and pathogenicity between classical and mutant strains of PEDV may lead to diverse invasion mechanisms, this study focused on the cellular entry pathways and cellular transport of the PEDV GI and GII subtype strains in Vero cells and IPEC-J2 cells. We first characterized the kinetics of PEDV entry into cells and found that the highest invasion rate of PEDV was approximately 33% in the IPEC-J2 cells and approximately 100% in the Vero cells. To clarify the specific endocytic pathways, systematic research methods were used and showed that PEDV enters cells via the clathrin- and caveolae-mediated endocytosis pathways, in which dynamin II, clathrin heavy chain, Eps15, cholesterol, and caveolin-1 were indispensably involved. In addition, lipid raft extraction assay showed that PEDV can also enter cells through lipid raft-mediated endocytosis. To investigate the trafficking of internalized PEDV, we found that PEDV entry into cells relied on low pH and internalized virions reached lysosomes through the early endosome-late endosome-lysosome pathway. The results concretely revealed the entry mechanisms of PEDV and provided an insightful theoretical basis for the further understanding of PEDV pathogenesis and guidance for new targets of antiviral drugs.","Wei, Xiaona; She, Gaoli; Wu, Tingting; Xue, Chunyi; Cao, Yongchang",Vet Res,417,22

The largest expenditure of ATP results from ion transport, particularly from removal of Na+ entering outer segment light-dependent channels and inner segment hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated channels, and from ATP-dependent pumping of Ca2+ entering voltage-gated channels at the synaptic terminal. Single cones expend nearly twice as much energy as single rods in darkness, largely because they make more synapses with second-order retinal cells and thus must extrude more Ca2+ In daylight, cone ATP utilization per cell remains high because cones never remain saturated and must continue to export Na+ and synaptic Ca2+ even in bright illumination. In mouse and human retina, rods greatly outnumber cones and consume more energy overall even in background light. In primates, however, the high density of cones in the fovea produces a pronounced peak of ATP utilization, which becomes particularly prominent in daylight and may make this part of the retina especially sensitive to changes in energy availability.","Ingram, Norianne T; Fain, Gordon L; Sampath, Alapakkam P",Proc.

DESIGN: Pre-post observational study. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: 623 nursing homes in Ontario, Canada, between March 2020 and June 2020. METHODS: We used GPS location data from mobile devices to approximate connectivity between all 623 nursing homes in Ontario during the 7 weeks before (March 1-April 21) and after (April 22-June 13) the policy restricting staff movement was implemented. We constructed a network diagram visualizing connectivity between nursing homes in Ontario and calculated the number of homes that had a connection with another nursing home and the average number of connections per home in each period. We calculated the relative difference in these mobility metrics between the 2 time periods and compared within-home changes using McNemar test and the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. RESULTS: In the period preceding restrictions, 266 (42.7%) nursing homes had a connection with at least 1 other home, compared with 79 (12.7%) homes during the period after restrictions, a drop of 70.3% (P < .001). Including all homes, the average number of connections in the before period was 3.90 compared to 0.77 in the after period, a drop of 80.3% (P < .001). In both periods, mobility between nursing homes was higher in homes located in larger communities, those with higher bed counts, and those part of a large chain. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Mobility between nursing homes in Ontario fell sharply after an emergency order by the Ontario government limiting long-term care staff to a single home, though some mobility persisted. Reducing this residual mobility should be a focus of efforts to reduce risk within the long-term care sector during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Jones, Aaron; Watts, Alexander G; Khan, Salah Uddin; Forsyth, Jack; Brown, Kevin A; Costa, Andrew P; Bogoch, Isaac I; Stall, Nathan M",J Am Med Dir Assoc,417,16

Thus, it is important to assess FMS so that children needing additional support can be identified in a timely fashion. There is great potential for universal screening of FMS in schools, but research has established that current assessment tools are not fit for purpose. OBJECTIVE: To develop and validate the psychometric properties of a FMS assessment tool designed specifically to meet the demands of universal screening in schools. METHODS: A working group consisting of academics from developmental psychology, public health and behavioural epidemiology developed an assessment tool (FUNMOVES) based on theory and prior evidence. Over three studies, 814 children aged 4 to 11 years were assessed in school using FUNMOVES. Rasch analysis was used to evaluate structural validity and modifications were then made to FUNMOVES activities after each study based on Rasch results and implementation fidelity. RESULTS: The initial Rasch analysis found numerous psychometric problems including multidimensionality, disordered thresholds, local dependency, and misfitting items. Study 2 showed a unidimensional measure, with acceptable internal consistency and no local dependency, but that did not fit the Rasch model. Performance on a jumping task was misfitting, and there were issues with disordered thresholds (for jumping, hopping and balance tasks). Study 3 revealed a unidimensional assessment tool with good fit to the Rasch model, and no further issues, once jumping and hopping scoring were modified. IMPLICATIONS: The finalised version of FUNMOVES (after three iterations) meets standards for accurate measurement, is free and able to assess a whole class in under an hour using resources available in schools. Thus FUNMOVES has the potential to allow schools to efficiently screen FMS to ensure that targeted support can be provided and disability barriers removed.","Eddy, Lucy H; Preston, Nick; Mon-Williams, Mark; Bingham, Daniel D; Atkinson, Jo M C; Ellingham-Khan, Marsha; Otteslev, Ava; Hill, Liam J B",PLoS One,417,3

The purpose of the article was to document the adopted corporate protocol and describe the management of the traumatized patient in a Hub center. Methods: Our hospital has been identified as one of the three regional Hubs for polytrauma and major traumas, requiring suitable pathways to receive confirmed or suspected COVID-19-positive patients, from the emergency room entrance to the operating room, and finally to the inpatient ward or ICU. From February 23th to April 30th 2020 we analyzed the total number of trauma patients hospitalized and the number of femoral neck fractures surgically treated within 48 h; the data were then compared with the corresponding period of the previous year. Results: There has been a reduction in the overall number of traumas as a result of government restraint measures. Total occupancy time in the operating theater has increased, but not drastically considering dressing procedures and anesthesia (carried out inside the operating room). The number of patients with femoral neck fractures surgically treated within 48 h (none of the COVID-19-positive patients) decreased from 83.33 to 58.70%, but only slightly lower than the Italian pre-COVID average of 64.70%.

For this purpose, the perceptions of engineering students towards five specific course units forming part of engineering degree courses at the University of Burgos, Spain, were evaluated to assess the quality of the online teaching they received. Comparisons were also drawn with their perceptions of the F2F teaching of the course units prior to the outbreak of the pandemic. According to the students' perceptions, the teachers possessed the technical knowledge, the social skills, and the personal capabilities (empathy and understanding of the at times troubled situation of each student) for a very abrupt adaptation of their courses to an online methodology. The shortcomings of the online teaching were related to its particularities and each teacher's personality traits.

METHODS: An online questionnaire designed for this survey was distributed via the researchers' networks and was available for completion by any teacher, except those who were not working at the time. There were 1,253 teachers from all over Brazil, of both sexes, covering a wide age range, working at different levels of education, and most with more than ten years of experience. Descriptive and inferential analyses of the data were performed. RESULTS: On comparing the prepandemic period with the current one, participants indicated voice improvements. In contrast, they presented symptoms such as dry throat, effort in addressing remote classes, hoarseness after classes, and difficulties with the use of headphones, among others. They further indicated stress, general fatigue, impact of the pandemic on mental health, and the overlapping of many home tasks with professional tasks. Some smoked, and others hydrated insufficiently. CONCLUSION: Although teachers generally noticed voice improvements during the pandemic, a proportion of them perceived worsening of voices. Many indicated several factors in which speech-language pathologists could guide them with the aim of improving performance and comfort during remote and hybrid classes, an initiative that will positively impact not only their voice and communication but also their quality of life.","Nemr, Katia; Simões-Zenari, Marcia; Almeida, Vanessa Cássia de; Martins, Glauciene Amaral; Saito, Isabele Tiemi",Clinics,417,24

It is therefore necessary to collect fundamental information about the disease, its epidemiology and treatment, as well as about the virus itself. While the virus has been identified rapidly, detailed ultrastructural analysis of virus cell biology and architecture is still in its infancy. We therefore studied the virus morphology and morphometry of SARS-CoV-2 in comparison to SARS-CoV as it appears in Vero cell cultures by using conventional thin section electron microscopy and electron tomography. Both virus isolates, SARS-CoV Frankfurt 1 and SARS-CoV-2 Italy-INMI1, were virtually identical at the ultrastructural level and revealed a very similar particle size distribution with a median of about 100 nm without spikes. Maximal spike length of both viruses was 23 nm. The number of spikes per virus particle was about 30% higher in the SARS-CoV than in the SARS-CoV-2 isolate. This result complements a previous qualitative finding, which was related to a lower productivity of SARS-CoV-2 in cell culture in comparison to SARS-CoV.","Laue, Michael; Kauter, Anne; Hoffmann, Tobias; Möller, Lars; Michel, Janine; Nitsche, Andreas",Sci Rep,417,25

However, access to these programs is limited, particularly for populations experiencing health disparities. Primary care settings have become recognized as a potential delivery system in which these programs may be implemented at scale. The purpose of this trial is to test the effectiveness of the Family Check-Up 4 Health (FCU4Health) program, an adaptation of the FCU for primary care, and assess program implementation in an integrated primary care setting. METHODS: We will conduct a hybrid type 2 effectiveness-implementation trial in partnership with a primary care clinic in a low-income, majority Latino community. Families with 2- to 5-year-old children will be eligible to participate. Families will be randomized to receive the intervention (n = 130) or services as usual (n = 70) and will be assessed annually over three years. Outcomes are informed by the RE-AIM framework (i.e., reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, and maintenance). Effectiveness outcomes include child health behaviors (e.g., Dietary Screener Questionnaire), behavioral health (e.g., Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire), and parenting (e.g., Proactive Parenting). Early stage implementation outcomes are also included (e.g., cost, acceptability, appropriateness, and feasibility). Effectiveness outcomes will be assessed via intent-to-treat (ITT) analyses. Implementation outcomes will be primarily descriptive with comparisons to prior trials of FCU4Health and the original FCU. PROJECTED OUTCOMES: This trial will provide evidence related to the potential of integrated primary care settings to deliver evidence-based preventive interventions with a dual focus on behavioral and physical health.","Berkel, Cady; Smith, Justin D; Bruening, Meg M; Jordan, Neil; Fu, Emily; Mauricio, Anne M; Grimm, Kevin J; Winslow, Emily; Ray, Kristen; Bourne, Annette; Dishion, Thomas J",Contemp Clin Trials,417,16

Within few weeks, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced a novel coronavirus designated as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In late January 2020, WHO declared the outbreak of a ""public-health emergency of international concern"" due to the rapid and increasing spread of the disease worldwide. Currently, there is no vaccine or approved treatment for this emerging infection; thus, the objective of this study is to design a multiepitope peptide vaccine against COVID-19 using an immunoinformatics approach. Method: Several techniques facilitating the combination of the immunoinformatics approach and comparative genomic approach were used in order to determine the potential peptides for designing the T-cell epitope-based peptide vaccine using the envelope protein of 2019-nCoV as a target. Results: Extensive mutations, insertion, and deletion were discovered with comparative sequencing in the COVID-19 strain. Additionally, ten peptides binding to MHC class I and MHC class II were found to be promising candidates for vaccine design with adequate world population coverage of 88.5% and 99.99%, respectively. Conclusion: The T-cell epitope-based peptide vaccine was designed for COVID-19 using the envelope protein as an immunogenic target. Nevertheless, the proposed vaccine rapidly needs to be validated clinically in order to ensure its safety and immunogenic profile to help stop this epidemic before it leads to devastating global outbreaks.","Abdelmageed, Miyssa I; Abdelmoneim, Abdelrahman H; Mustafa, Mujahed I; Elfadol, Nafisa M; Murshed, Naseem S; Shantier, Shaza W; Makhawi, Abdelrafie M",Biomed Res Int,417,10

Job seekers increasingly rely upon automated platforms to find and apply for jobs, and their fate in these selection processes are often automated. Drawing on data from the German LEO study and ethnographic interviews with job seekers in community-based digital literacy classes in Canada, this article explores how adult job seekers experience e-recruitment platforms, examining promises of efficiency, convenience and fairness in light of embedded inequalities within algorithmic agencies.

We report AD-like pathology in cerebral organoids grown in vitro from non-invasively sampled strands of hair from 71% of DS donors. The pathology consisted of extracellular diffuse and fibrillar Aß deposits, hyperphosphorylated/pathologically conformed Tau, and premature neuronal loss. Presence/absence of AD-like pathology was donor-specific (reproducible between individual organoids/iPSC lines/experiments). Pathology could be triggered in pathology-negative T21 organoids by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated elimination of the third copy of chromosome 21 gene BACE2, but prevented by combined chemical ß and Î³-secretase inhibition. We found that T21 organoids secrete increased proportions of Aß-preventing (Aß1-19) and Aß-degradation products (Aß1-20 and Aß1-34). We show these profiles mirror in cerebrospinal fluid of people with DS. We demonstrate that this protective mechanism is mediated by BACE2-trisomy and cross-inhibited by clinically trialled BACE1 inhibitors. Combined, our data prove the physiological role of BACE2 as a dose-sensitive AD-suppressor gene, potentially explaining the dementia delay in ~30% of people with DS. We also show that DS cerebral organoids could be explored as pre-morbid AD-risk population detector and a system for hypothesis-free drug screens as well as identification of natural suppressor genes for neurodegenerative diseases.","Alic, Ivan; Goh, Pollyanna A; Murray, Aoife; Portelius, Erik; Gkanatsiou, Eleni; Gough, Gillian; Mok, Kin Y; Koschut, David; Brunmeir, Reinhard; Yeap, Yee Jie; O039,; Brien, Niamh L; Groet, Jürgen; Shao, Xiaowei; Havlicek, Steven; Dunn, N Ray; Kvartsberg, Hlin; Brinkmalm, Gunnar; Hithersay, Rosalyn; Startin, Carla; Hamburg, Sarah; Phillips, Margaret; Pervushin, Konstantin; Turmaine, Mark; Wallon, David; Rovelet-Lecrux, Anne; Soininen, Hilkka; Volpi, Emanuela; Martin, Joanne E; Foo, Jia Nee; Becker, David L; Rostagno, Agueda; Ghiso, Jorge; Krsnik, Zeljka; Simic, Goran; Kostovic, Ivica; Mitrecic, Dinko; Francis, Paul T; Blennow, Kaj; Strydom, Andre; Hardy, John; Zetterberg, Henrik; Nizetic, Dean",Mol. psychiatry,417,33

These data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 inhibition in these cell culture models is likely to be a result of the impact of brilacidin on viral entry and its disruption of viral integrity. Brilacidin demonstrated synergistic antiviral activity when combined with remdesivir.

Validation was performed on nasopharyngeal and sputum specimens (n=174) using newly designed dual-target rRT-PCR (altona RealStar SARS-CoV-2 Reagent) for detecting SARS-CoV-2 in upper respiratory (URT) and lower respiratory tract (LRT) specimens. Accuracy testing demonstrated excellent assay agreement between expected and observed values and comparable diagnostic performance to reference tests. The limit of detection (LOD) was 2.7 and 23.0 gene copies/reaction for nasopharyngeal and sputum specimens, respectively. Retrospective analysis of 1,694 URT specimens from 1,571 patients revealed increased positivity in older patients and males compared to females, and an increasing positivity rate from approximately 20% at the start of testing to 50% at the end of testing three weeks later.

In the absence of a proven vaccine or cure, non-pharmaceutical interventions including social distancing, testing and contact tracing, isolation, and wearing of masks are essential in the fight against the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic. We use data envelopment analysis and data compiled from Worldometers and The World Bank to analyze how efficient the use of resources were to stabilize the rate of infections and minimize death rates in the top 36 countries that represented 90% of global infections and deaths out of 220 countries as of November 11, 2020. This is the first paper to model the technical efficiency of countries in managing the COVID-19 pandemic by modeling death rates and infection rates as undesirable outputs using the approach developed by You and Yan. We find that the average efficiency of global healthcare systems in managing the pandemic is very low, with only six efficient systems out of a total of 36 under the variable returns to scale assumption. This finding suggests that, holding constant the size of their healthcare systems (because countries cannot alter the size of a healthcare system in the short run), most of the sample countries showed low levels of efficiency during this time of managing the pandemic; instead it is suspected that most countries literally ""threw"" resources at fighting the pandemic, thereby probably raising inefficiency through wasted resource use.","Breitenbach, Marthinus C; Ngobeni, Victor; Aye, Goodness C",Front Public Health,417,16

We compared the proportions of AAI pattern, OP pattern, or resolving pattern with time progression and analyzed the association between the patterns and disease severity using Pearson chi-square and Fisher's exact test. Results Predominant CT patterns were AAI pattern (87%) in the early hospital period group (0-10 days, after the onset of symptoms), OP pattern (45.7%) in the later hospital period group (after 10 days), and resolving pattern in discharge and follow-up group (47.2% and 84.8%, respectively).

259568,259568,259568,Reflections on the extinction of the National Council for Food and Nutrition Security and the confrontation of Covid-19 in Brazil,17.286556,3.1115263,2020,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a fatal infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). The virus infection is initiated upon recognition and binding of the spike (S) protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) to the host cell surface receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Blocking the interaction between S protein and ACE2 receptor is a novel approach to prevent the viral entry into the host cell. The present study is aimed at the identification of small molecules which can disrupt the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 S protein and human ACE2 receptor by binding to the interface region. A chemical library consisting of 1,36,191 molecules were screened for drug-like compounds based on Lipinski's rule of five, Verber's rule and in silico toxicity parameters. The filtered drug-like molecules were next subjected to molecular docking in the interface region of RBD. The best three hits viz; ZINC64023823, ZINC33039472 and ZINC00991597 were further taken for molecular dynamics (MD) simulation studies and binding free energy evaluations using Molecular mechanics-Poisson-Boltzmann surface area (MM-PBSA) and Molecular mechanics-Generalized Born surface area (MM-GBSA). The protein-ligand complexes showed stable trajectories throughout the simulation time. ZINC33039472 exhibited binding free energy value lower as compared to the control (emodin) with a higher contribution by gas-phase energy and van der Waals energy to the total binding free energy. Thus, ZINC33039472 is identified to be a promising interfacial binding molecule which can inhibit the interaction between the viral S protein and human ACE2 receptor which would consequently help in the management of the disease.","Gurung, Arun Bahadur; Ali, Mohammad Ajmal; Lee, Joongku; Farah, Mohammad Abul; Al-Anazi, Khalid Mashay",J Infect Public Health,417,26

From the perspective of psychological distance (PD), this study used descriptive, differential, and spatial autocorrelation analysis methods to explore the cognitive distance, emotional distance, expected distance and behavioral distance of the Chinese public in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic. An analysis of 4042 valid sample data found that: (1) The event emotional distance and subject emotional distance were both furthest from the event and subject psychological distance dimensions, and anger about the event was the strongest. (2) The government was the most appealing subject in the process of pandemic prevention and control, but at the same time, the public's sense of closeness to the government was also lower than that of the other three subjects, e.g., medical institutions. (3) Different pandemic regions showed significant differences in PD. Mean scores of PD in each risk region were as follows: High-risk regions > medium-risk regions > low-risk regions. (4) From a global perspective, no spatial autocorrelation was found in PD. However, from a local perspective, high-value regions (provinces with distant PD) are mainly concentrated in the southern regions (Guizhou, Guangxi, Hainan, Jiangxi), and low-value regions (provinces with close PD) are mainly concentrated in North China (Shanxi, Hebei, Beijing). Combined with the relevant conclusions, this paper put forward policy recommendations.","Wu, Meifen; Long, Ruyin; Chen, Hong",Curr Psychol,417,16

However, data on outcomes and mortality rates are inconsistent between studies. METHODS: A literature search and meta-analysis were performed on studies reporting the mortality of patients with STEMI admitted before and during the COVID-19 pandemic using PubMed, Embase and Web of Science. Additionally, prehospital and intrahospital delay times were evaluated. RESULTS: Outcomes of a total of 50 123 patients from 10 studies were assessed. Our study revealed that, despite a significant reduction in overall admission rates of patients with STEMI during the COVID-19 pandemic (incidence rate ratio=0.789, 95% CI 0.730 to 0.852, I2=77%, p<0.01), there was no significant difference in hospital mortality (OR=1.178, 95% CI 0.926 to 1.498, I2=57%, p=0.01) compared with patients with STEMI admitted before the outbreak. Time from the onset of symptoms to first medical contact was similar (mean difference (MD)=33.4 min, 95% CI -10.2 to 77.1, I2=88%, p<0.01) while door-to-balloon time was significantly prolonged in those presenting during the pandemic (MD=7.3 min, 95% CI 3.0 to 11.7, I2=95%, p<0.01). CONCLUSION: The significant reduction in admission of patients with STEMI was not associated with a significant increase of hospital mortality rates. The causes for reduced incidence rates remain speculative. However, the analysed data indicate that acute and timely medical care of these patients has been maintained during the pandemic in most countries. Long-term data on mortality have yet to be determined.","Rattka, Manuel; Dreyhaupt, Jens; Winsauer, Claudia; Stuhler, Lina; Baumhardt, Michael; Thiessen, Kevin; Rottbauer, Wolfgang; Imhof, Armin",Heart,417,20

METHODS: Teaching and Learning (T&L) activities were conducted virtually on e-learning platforms. The students' experience and feedback were evaluated after 15 weeks. RESULTS: We found that while students preferred face-to-face, physical teaching, they were able to adapt to the new norm of e-learning. More than 60% of the students agreed that pre-recorded lectures and viewing videos of practical sessions, plus answering short questions, were beneficial. Certain aspects, such as hands-on practical and clinical experience, could never be replaced. The e-learning and study-from-home environment accorded a lot of flexibility. However, students also found it challenging to focus because of distractions, lack of engagement and mental stress. Technical problems, such as poor Internet connectivity and limited data plans, also compounded the problem. CONCLUSION: We expect e-learning to prevail in future. Hybrid learning strategies, which includes face-to-face classes and e-learning, will become common, at least in the medical physics programme of the University of Malaya even after the pandemic.","Azlan, Che Ahmad; Wong, Jeannie Hsiu Ding; Tan, Li Kuo; A D Huri, Muhammad Shahrun Nizam; Ung, Ngie Min; Pallath, Vinod; Tan, Christina Phoay Lay; Yeong, Chai Hong; Ng, Kwan Hoong",Phys Med,417,16

It is based on the development of a harmonised survey with 50 questions (106 different items) on sleep habits and sleep symptoms that permit comparability of information. The harmonised questionnaire may be used in anonymous cross-sectional surveys, and the instruments within the questionnaire may also be used in prospective studies and clinical studies. The aim was to develop a questionnaire to sample a variety of sleep-wake disorders and other symptoms likely to be caused by prolonged social confinement or by having had COVID-19. The questionnaire was designed to be: (a) simple and, (b) free to use, for research purposes, (c) multilingual, and (d) comprehensive. It can be completed in <30 min. By the end of June 2020, the survey questionnaire had been administered in Austria, Canada, China, Finland, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Italy, Japan, Norway, Poland, Sweden, UK and USA.

Digital technologies provide the opportunity to deliver tailored and progressive programs at home. However, it is unknown if they are effective in older people, especially in those with cognitive impairment. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine the efficacy of a novel tablet-delivered cognitive-motor program on mobility in older people with cognitive impairment. METHODS: This was a 6-month single-blind randomised controlled trial of older people living in the community with subjective and/or objective cognitive impairment. Participants randomised to the intervention were asked to follow a 120 min per week balance, strength and cognitive training program delivered via an app on an iPad. Both the intervention and control group received monthly phone calls and health fact sheets. The primary outcome measure was gait speed. Secondary measures included dual-task gait speed, balance (step test, FISCIT-4), 5 sit to stand test, cognition (executive function, memory, attention), mood and balance confidence. Adherence, safety, usability and feedback were also measured. RESULTS: The planned sample size of 110 was not reached due to COVID-19 restrictions. A total of 93 (mean age 72.8 SD 7.0 years) participants were randomised to the two groups. Of these 77 participants returned to the follow-up clinic. In intention-to-treat analysis for gait speed, there was a non-significant improvement favouring the intervention group (ß 0.04 m/s 95% CI -0.01, 0.08). There were no significant findings for secondary outcomes. Adherence was excellent (84.5%), usability of the app high (76.7% SD 15.3) and no serious adverse events were reported. Feedback on the app was positive and included suggestions for future updates. CONCLUSION: Due to COVID-19 the trial was under powered to detect significant results. Despite this, there was a trend towards improvement in the primary outcome measure. The excellent adherence and positive feedback about the app suggest a fully powered trial is warranted.","Callisaya, Michele L; Jayakody, Oshadi; Vaidya, Anagha; Srikanth, Velandai; Farrow, Maree; Delbaere, Kim",Exp Gerontol,417,16

METHODS: From January 30, 2020 to March 23, 2020, we conducted a non-randomised controlled trial, in which all adult patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were assigned to three groups non-randomly and given supportive treatments: Group A, Lopinavir-Ritonavir; Group B, Huashi Baidu Formula (a Chinese medicineformula made by the China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences to treat COVID-19, which is now in the clinical trial period) and Lopinavir-Ritonavir; and Group C, Huashi Baidu Formula. The use of antibiotics, antiviruses, and corticosteroids was permitted in Group A and B. Traditional Chinese medicine injections were permitted in Group C. The primary outcomes were clinical remission time (interval from admission to the first time the patient tested negatively for novel coronavirus or an obvious improvement was observed from chest CT) and clinical remission rate (number of patients whose clinical time was within 16 days/total number of patients). RESULTS: A total of 60 adult patients with COVID-19 were enrolled at sites in Wuhan, China, and the sample size of each group was 20. In Groups A, B and C, the clinical remission rates were 95.0%%(19/20), 100.0%%(20/20) and 100.0%%(20/20), respectively. Compared with Groups A and B, the clinical remission time of Group C was significantly shorter (5.9 days vs. 10.8 days, p < 0.05; 5.9 days vs. 9.7 days, p < 0.05). There was no significant difference among Groups A, B, and C in terms of the time taken to be released from quarantine. The clinical biochemical indicators and safety indexes showed no significant differences among the three groups. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that Lopinavir-Ritonavir has some efficacy in the treatment of COVID-19, and the Huashi Baidu Formula might enhance this effect to an extent. In addition, superiority was displayed in the treatment of COVID-19 through a combination of the Huashi Baidu Formula and traditional Chinese medicine injection.

By investigating population characteristics and prescribing profiles, it is possible to generate hypotheses about the associations between specific drug-utilisation profiles and susceptibility to COVID-19 infection. A retrospective drug-utilisation study was carried out using routinely collected information from a healthcare database in Campania (Southern Italy). We aimed to discover the prevalence of drug utilisation (monotherapy and polytherapy) in COVID-19 versus non-COVID-19 patients in Campania (~ 6 million inhabitants). The study cohort comprised 1532 individuals who tested positive for COVID-19. Drugs were grouped according to the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification system. We noted higher prevalence rates of the use of drugs in the ATC categories C01, B01 and M04, which was probably linked to related comorbidities (i.e., cardiovascular and metabolic). Nevertheless, the prevalence of the use of drugs acting on the renin-angiotensin system, such as antihypertensive drugs, was not higher in COVID-19 patients than in non-COVID-19 patients after adjustments for age and sex.

We evaluated the performance of two commercially-available lateral flow immunochromatographic assays (LFIC) (Wondfo SARS-CoV-2 Antibody test and the INNOVITA 2019-nCoV Ab test) in comparison with a SARS-CoV-2 neutralization pseudotyped assay for COVID-19 diagnosis in hospitalized patients, and investigate whether the intensity of the test band in LFIC associates with neutralizing antibody (NtAb) titers. Ninety sera were included from 51 patients with moderate to severe COVID-19. A green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter-based pseudotyped neutralization assay (vesicular stomatitis virus coated with SARS-CoV-2 spike protein) was used. Test line intensity was scored using a 4-level scale (0 to 3+). Overall sensitivity of LFIC assays was 91.1% for the Wondfo SARS-CoV-2 Antibody test, 72.2% for the INNOVITA 2019-nCoV IgG, 85.6% for the INNOVITA 2019-nCoV IgM and 92.2% for the NtAb assay.

The paper discusses the group’s perceptions of the essential components of effective online group work education. It begins with a review of the history of online social work education. It then outlines the key components instrumental in the planning and developing of engaged online group work classes. Topics include pre-course preparation, norm setting, and building community in the online classroom. Considerations related to the video conferencing platforms, course formats, activities, managing online fatigue, screen sharing, handling chat features, cameras, and break out rooms are interspersed throughout. The paper concludes with a discussion of the use of mutual aid groups as online teaching tools and highlights the online group work teaching experiences of two members in New Zealand and Nambia.

A retrospective study of all infants undergoing cardiac surgery from 2015 through 2016 at a large tertiary institution who were readmitted within 1 year of discharge from cardiac surgical hospitalization was performed. Data specific to patient characteristics, surgical hospitalization, and readmission hospitalization are described. Unplanned readmissions within 1 year of hospital discharge were analyzed with Cox proportional hazard regression to identify factors associated with increased hazard for earlier unplanned readmission. Comparable to previous reports, 12% (78/658) of all surgical hospitalizations were associated with unplanned readmission within 30 days. Infectious etiology, followed by cardiac and gastrointestinal problems, was the most common reasons for unplanned 30-day readmission. Unplanned readmissions within 2 weeks of discharge were multifactorial and less commonly related to cardiac or surgical care. Primary nasogastric tube feeding at the time of discharge was the only significant risk factor for earlier unplanned readmission (p = 0.032) on multivariable analysis. Increased care coordination with particular attention to feeding and comorbidity management may be future targets to effectively mitigate readmissions and improve quality of care in this population.","Berry, Anna E; Ghanayem, Nancy S; Guffey, Danielle; Anderson, Meghan; Heinle, Jeffrey S; Mery, Carlos M; Watrin, Carmen H; Elhoff, Justin J",Pediatr. cardiol,417,26

However, it is too simple to be able to model those mechanisms (including the three main type of control measures: social distancing, contact tracing and health system measures) to fit real data and to simulate possible future scenarios. A question, then, arises: how much and how do we need to complexify a SIR model? We develop a Î¸ -SEIHQRD model, which may be the simplest one satisfying the mentioned requirements for arbitrary territories and can be simplified in particular cases.

However, this scenario is more complex than initially thought due to the heterogeneity of hyperinflammation. Some patients with coronavirus 2019 disease (COVID-19) develop a fully blown secondary haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (sHLH), whereas others, despite a consistent release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, do not fulfil sHLH criteria but still show some features resembling the phenotype of the hyperferritinemic syndrome. Despite the final event (the cytokine storm) is shared by various conditions leading to sHLH, the aetiology, either infectious, autoimmune or neoplastic, accounts for the differences in the various phases of this process. Moreover, the evidence of a hyperinflammatory microenvironment provided the rationale to employ immunomodulating agents for therapeutic purposes in severe COVID-19. This viewpoint aims at discussing the pitfalls and issues to be considered with regard to the use of immunomodulating agents in COVID-19, such as timing of treatment based on the viral load and the extent of cytokine/ferritin overexpression. Furthermore, it encompasses recent findings in the paediatric field about a novel multisystem inflammatory disease resembling toxic shock syndrome and atypical Kawasaki disease observed in children with proven SARS-CoV2 infection. Finally, it includes arguments in favour of adding COVID-19 to the spectrum of the recently defined 'hyperferritinemic syndrome', which already includes adult-onset Still's disease, macrophage activation syndrome, septic shock and catastrophic anti-phospholipid syndrome.","Alunno, Alessia; Carubbi, Francesco; Rodríguez-Carrio, Javier",,417,33

Such information is essential to correctly identifying delirium and dementia, as well as making an accurate diagnosis and planning appropriate treatment. It is the standard of care recommended by the EuGMS. METHODS: We reviewed medical notes and administered a short questionnaire to nursing staff of a convenience sample of 100 patients aged &#8805; 75 years admitted to medical wards in a tertiary teaching hospital. RESULTS: There were 100 patients with a mean age of 82.3 years, 49% of whom were female. Of 43 patients with cognitive impairment, 19 (44%) had a collateral history. Half of the patients described as having dementia did not have any further detail on the severity of dementia documented. Among those for whom a collateral history was obtained, the level of detail regarding pre-morbid cognition, function, mobility, and continence was sparse. Of the total sample, 13% had formal cognitive testing. CONCLUSION: Acute illness characteristically causes significant impairments in cognition and function in frail older patients. Identifying and reversing these impairments is impossible without a comprehensive collateral history. It is alarming that such an essential component of clinical assessment is so often disregarded and highlights the lack of awareness from clinicians of the importance of collateral history in the management of patients with dementia and delirium. This must be emphasised in both undergraduate and postgraduate teaching.","Fitzpatrick, Donal; Doyle, Kate; Finn, Ger; Gallagher, Paul",,417,24

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Retrospective cohort study of patients with COVID-19 admitted from 26th February, who had been discharged or died, up to 29th April, 2020. A descriptive study and an analysis of factors associated with intrahospital mortality were performed. RESULTS: Out of the 101 patients, 96 were analysed. Of these, 79 (82%) recovered and were discharged, and 17 (18%) died in the hospital. Diagnosis of COVID-19 was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction to SARS-CoV-2 in 92 (92.5%). The mean age was 63 years, and 66% were male. The most frequent comorbidities were hypertension (40%), diabetes mellitus (16%) and cardiopathy (14%). Patients who died were older (mean 77 vs 60 years), had higher prevalence of hypertension (71% vs 33%), and cardiopathy (47% vs 6%), and higher levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and reactive C protein (mean 662 vs 335UI/L, and 193 vs 121mg/L respectively) on admission. In a multivariant analysis the variables significantly associated to mortality were the presence of cardiopathy (CI 95% OR 2,58-67,07), levels of LDH&#8805;345IU/L (CI 95% OR 1,52-46,00), and age&#8805;65 years (CI 95% OR 1,23-44,62). CONCLUSIONS: The presence of cardiopathy, levels of LDH&#8805;345IU/L and age &#8805;65 years are associated with a higher risk of death during hospital stay for COVID-19.

We found that the mutations K417N, E484K, and N501Y within the receptor-binding domains (RBDs) of the virus could confer ~2-fold higher binding affinity to the human receptor, angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), compared to the wildtype RBD. The mutated version of RBD also completely abolishes the binding of bamlanivimab, a therapeutic antibody, in vitro. Detailed analysis shows that the ~10-fold gain of binding affinity between ACE2 and Y501-RBD, which also exits in the high contagious variant B.1.1.7/501Y.V1 from the United Kingdom, is compromised by additional introduction of the K417/N/T mutation.

Background Midwives are a vital workforce at risk of burnout, attrition, and trauma. Emotional consequences of the pandemic for midwives remain largely unknown. Aim To understand the lived experiences of midwives providing care in the north west suburbs of Melbourne, Victoria during the pandemic. Methods Purposive and snowball sampling facilitated the recruitment of eight midwives in the north west suburbs of Melbourne, Victoria. Semi-structured interviews were audio recorded and transcribed, occurring via telephone or video between September and October 2020. Interpretive phenomenology was the methodology used, informed by the writings of Heidegger and Gadamer. Findings Insights gleaned from the data embody a range of understandings. The unknown cost of change and adaptation;waves of the virus;balancing risk;telehealth;personal protective equipment;stripping away support;the privilege of abiding by the restrictions;separation, distress, uncertainty;and, professional strength. Discussion Experiences of midwives during the pandemic are characterised by sensations of voicelessness and professional invisibility. Distinctive differences in personal wellbeing and professional satisfaction exist between midwives working with and without continuity of care. Conclusion This paper voices the lived experiences of Victorian midwives, in the midst of an extended lockdown, during the COVID-19 pandemic. Knowledge obtained from this research provides important understandings for leaders, policymakers, and healthcare systems, in planning a long-term response to the pandemic that supports the wellbeing and longevity of a vital workforce.","Hearn, Fran Biggs Laura Wallace Heather Riggs Elisha",Women and birth : journal of the Australian College of Midwives,417,3

Neurological manifestations of coronavirus infectious disease of 2019 (COVID-19) have been ever evolving and the spectrum of neuraxial involvement is broadening. Albeit it may affect any area of the neural axis, the involvement of the spinal cord is rare compared to that of the brain and of the peripheral nervous system.

AQP-4-antibody-seropositive NMOSD following SARS-CoV-2 infection had not yet been reported. We herein report a novel case of a previously healthy man who presented with a clinical picture of bouts of vomiting and hiccoughs (area postrema syndrome), which rapidly evolved to acute LETM, all following SARS-CoV-2 infection. He was finally diagnosed to be a case of seropositive NMOSD which presented as area postrema syndrome.

The data collection of very basic and health-related data of individuals in today's highly mobile society does help to plan, protect, and identify next steps health authorities and governments can, shall, or need to plan for or even implement. Thus, every individual, every human, and every inhabitant of the world is the key player -- very different to many past crises'. And since the individual is involved -- all individuals -- his/her (a) health and (b) privacy shall be considered in a very carefully crafted balance, not overruling one aspect with another one or even prioritizing certain aspects. Privacy remains the key. Thus, the solution of the current pandemic's data collection can be based on a fully privacy-preserving application, which can be used by individuals on their mobile devices, such as smartphones, while maintaining at the same time their privacy. Additionally, respective data collected in such a fully distributed setting does help to confine the pandemic and can be achieved in a democratic and very open, but still and especially privacy-protecting world. Therefore, the WeTrace approach and application as described in this paper utilizes the Bluetooth Low Energy (BTE) communication channel, many modern mobile devices offer, where asymmetric cryptography is being applied to allows for the decyphering of a message for that destination it had been intended for.

In this concise review we queried on the effects of corticosteroids in pregnancies complicated by SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: We performed a literature search on PubMed, regarding the use of corticosteroids in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, in pregnancies complicated by SARS-CoV-2, as well as their impact on glycemia in pregnant women with or without diabetes. Furthermore, we searched for effects of SARS-CoV-2 and of other coronaviridae on insulin secretion and glycemia. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 infection appears to be a risk factor for complications in pregnancy. Corticosteroids may not be recommended for treating SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia but they may be needed for at-risk pregnancies. Corticosteroids in pregnancy have a diabetogenic potential. SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviridae may have effects on glycemia. CONCLUSIONS: Caution should be exercised while using corticosteroids in pregnant women with COVID-19 requiring preterm delivery.","Kakoulidis, Ioannis; Ilias, Ioannis; Koukkou, Eftychia",Diabetes Metab Syndr,417,16

Therefore, this study aimed to assess the levels of anxiety, depression and stress during the period of social distancing due to COVID-19 in students from a campus of the Federal Institute in the metropolitan area of Porto Alegre/RS. A correlational and exploratory study was performed. The sample of the present research was composed by 208 students, who responded to a self-administered online questionnaire with sociodemographic variables and the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale Short Form - DASS-21. The detected prevalence of symptoms classified as moderate-severe was 49% for stress, 39% for depression and 33% for anxiety. An association was found between higher levels of anxiety symptoms (OR = 5.652; 95% CI = 2.872-11.123; p < 0.001), depression (OR = 3.289; 95% CI = 1.810-5.978; p < 0.001) and stress (OR = 5.684; 95% CI = 3.120-10.355; p < 0.001) with occurrence of sleep problems during the period of social distancing. There was a protective factor provided by regular physical exercise in relation to depressive symptoms (OR = 0.490; 95% CI = 0.250-0.960; p =0.033).

In this article we analyse the factors that drove high levels of concern among parents, teachers and the public and led to both demands for school closures in late March 2020, and to many parents' reluctance to return their children to school in May 2020. We discuss how the use of well-established principles of risk communication might have reduced much of this community concern. Then we set out a range of practical suggestions for communication practices that build trust and hence diminish concerns in relation to managing schools over the long term of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Leask, Julie; Hooker, Claire",Public Health Res.

Despite its primary effect on the respiratory system, the virus does not solely impact those with underlying lung conditions as initially predicted. Indeed, prognosis is worsened (often fatal) in patients with pre-existing hyperinflammatory responses (e.g., hypertension, obesity and diabetes), yet the mechanisms by which this occurs are unknown. A number of psychological conditions are associated with inflammation, suggesting that these may also be significant risk factors for negative outcomes of COVID-19. In this review, we evaluate preclinical and clinical literature suggesting that chronic stress-induced hyperinflammation interacts synergistically with COVID-19-related inflammation, contributing to a potentially fatal cytokine storm syndrome. In particular, we hypothesize that both chronic stress and COVID-19-related hyperinflammation are a product of glucocorticoid insufficiency. We discuss the devastating effects of SARS-CoV-2 on structural and functional aspects of the biological stress response and how these induce exaggerated inflammatory responses, particularly interleukin (IL)-6 hypersecretion. We postulate that chronic stress should be considered a significant risk factor for adverse COVID-19-related health outcomes, given overlapping peripheral and central immune dysregulation in both conditions. We conclude by discussing how people with a history of chronic stress could mitigate their risk for COVID-19 complications, identifying specific strategies that can be implemented during self-isolation.","Lamontagne, Steven J; Pizzagalli, Diego A; Olmstead, Mary C",Stress health (Online),417,26

METHODS: This was a cross-sectional online survey of all FPMRS program directors in the United States conducted from April 29, 2020, to May 30, 2020. At the time of this study, there were 73 program directors and 69 obstetrics and gynecology and urology-accredited FPMRS programs nationwide. The primary outcome was to subjectively assess the effectiveness of virtual interviews as compared with in-person interviews for evaluating applicants. RESULTS: Fifty seven (82.6%) of the program directors completed the survey. A total of 80.7% (46/57) of the respondents had participated in interviews for the active match cycle. Of the programs that participated in the interview process, almost all conducted interviews using virtual platforms (97.8%, 45/46). Program directors who conducted interviews virtually found them effective in evaluating applicants (88.9%, 40/45) and were satisfied with the virtual interview process (86.7%, 39/45). A total of 31.1% of respondents (14/45) preferred a virtual platform to an in-person setting for future interviews, and 60% (27/45) reported that they will likely perform future interviews virtually. CONCLUSIONS: Although the pandemic resulted in a sudden reformatting of FPMRS fellowship interviews, most program directors nationally were satisfied with the process and found virtual interviews effective for assessing applicants. More than 50% of FPMRS program directors are likely to consider the virtual format for future interviews.","Menhaji, Kimia; Gaigbe-Togbe, Bertille Ha; Hardart, Anne; Bui, Anthony H; Andiman, Sarah E; Ascher-Walsh, Charles J; Dabney, Lisa; Do Tran, Ann",Female pelvic med. reconstr. surg.

Previous studies have shown Peer Support Programs (PSPs) promote workforce wellness by supporting clinicians during times of heightened stress and vulnerability. Although these programs have been implemented in large institutions, they have not been used in military hospitals, which have high staff turnover and added stressors of deployments. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In December 2018, 50 physicians received 5 hours of PSP training at a military hospital from a nationally recognized PSP expert, following the programmatic structure described by Shapiro and Galowitz (2016). Utilization of the program was tracked from December 2018 to December 2019, recording only classification of provider type, triggering event, and provider specialty to maintain confidentiality. Qualitative comments from recipients and supporters were saved anonymously for quality improvement purposes. RESULTS: In the first year of our PSP, 254 clinicians (102 [40.2%] residents/fellows, 91 [35.8%] staff physicians, 4 [1.6%] medical students, 35 [13.8%] nurses, 22 [8.7%] allied health) received 1:1 peer support. Primary specialties utilizing peer support included 135 (52.9%) medical, 59 (23.2%) surgical, 43 (16.9%) obstetric, and 18 (7.1%) pediatric. Patient death (25%), risk management notification (22%), medical error/complication (15%), and poor patient outcome (13%) were the most common events triggering peer support. Peer support was provided at 8 locations across the continental United States with universally positive comments from recipients. CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of a PSP at our institution led to rapid utilization across multiple hospitals in the military health system, a model that could easily expand to deployed settings and remote locations. Access to peer support across the military health system could both mitigate the increased risks of military clinician burnout, and improve patient safety, healthcare worker resilience, and service member readiness.","Keyser, Erin A; Weir, Larissa F; Valdez, Michelle M; Aden, James K; Matos, Renée I",Mil. med,417,24

Frontline healthcare workers with increased exposure to COVID diagnosis, treatment and care were especially likely to report psychological burden, fear, anxiety and depression. AIM: To elicit how working as a health professional during the pandemic is impacting on the psychological wellbeing of frontline staff. METHOD: United Kingdom population of healthcare workers were approached by advertising the survey via social media, NHS trusts and other organisations. Open-ended survey answers were qualitatively explored using content analysis. RESULTS: Survey collected data from 395 NHS staff was developed into three themes; (1) Despair and uncertainty: feeling overwhelmed trying to protect everyone, (2) Behavioural and psychological impact: affecting wellbeing and functioning and (3) Coping and employer support: getting the right help. CONCLUSION: NHS staff felt enormous burden to adequately complete their professional, personal and civil responsibility to keep everyone safe leading to negative psychological and behavioural consequences and desire for NHS employers to offer better support. As the pandemic progresses, the results of this study may inform NHS employers on how optimum support can be offered to help them cope with negative psychological consequences of the pandemic.","Newman, Kristina L; Jeve, Yadava; Majumder, Pallab",Int J Soc Psychiatry,417,26

After infection, large amounts of inflammatory cytokines are secreted, known as the cytokine storm. These cytokines can cause pulmonary damage induced by inflammation resulting in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and even death. One of the therapeutic approaches for treatment of ARDS is a mesenchymal stem cell (MSC). MSCs suppress inflammation and reduce lung injury through their immunomodulatory properties. MSCs also have the potential to prevent apoptosis of the lung cells and regenerate them. But our suggestion is using MSCs-derived exosomes. Because these exosomes apply the same immunomodulatory and tissue repair effects of MSCs and they don't have problems associated to cell maintenance and injections. For investigation the hypothesis, MSCs should be isolated from tissues and characterized. Then, the exosomes should be isolated from the supernatants and characterized. These exosomes should be injected into a transgenic animal for COVID-19. In the final section, lung function assessment, histological examination, micro-CT, differential leukocyte, viral load analysis, cytokine assay, and CRP level analysis can be investigated. COVID-19 treatment is currently focused on supportive therapies and no vaccine has been developed for it. So, numerous researches are needed to find potential therapies. Since the pathogenesis of this disease was identified in previous studies and can cause lung injury with ARDS, investigation of the therapeutic approaches that can suppress inflammation, cytokine storm and ARDS can be helpful in finding a novel therapeutic approach for this disease.","Taghavi-Farahabadi, Mahsa; Mahmoudi, Mohammad; Soudi, Sara; Hashemi, Seyed Mahmoud",Med Hypotheses,417,16

Conservation analysis was carried out for these epitopes with HCoVs, OC43, HKU1, and NL63. 12/18 the candidate CD8+ T cell epitopes (binding score of &#8805;0.90), which had a high degree of homology (>75%) with the other three HCoVs were within the NSP12 and NSP13 proteins.

Methods: The ultra-fast liquid chromatography coupled with triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry (UFLC-MS/MS), a quick and efficient method was established and applied to quantify the major constituents of Fukeqianjin formula in rat plasma, and its pharmacokinetics of oral absorption was studied. Nineteen components in Fukeqianjin formula were detected and identified as the major compounds absorbed into the blood according to their chromatographic behavior, molecular weight, ion fragments and other information of these compounds. Furthermore, the plasma drug concentration-time curves were established and the related kinetic parameters were analyzed. Results: The results showed that all the 19 compounds could be rapidly absorbed by the gastrointestinal tract, the plasma drug concentration of most compounds could reach a peak at around 1-2 h, and the double-peaks on behalf of the enterohepatic circulation were found in most drug concentration-time curves. The method used in this experiment was validated comprehensively including specificity, linearity, precision, accuracy, stability, matrix effect, and recovery.

DESIGN: Retrospective observational study. SETTING: The emergency expansion of an ICU from eight general beds to 30 coronavirus disease 2019 beds. PARTICIPANTS: Patients with coronavirus disease 2019 admitted to the ICU of Luigi Sacco Hospital (Milan, Italy) for greater than or equal to 48 hours between February 21, 2020, and April 30, 2020. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The frequency of bloodstream infections per 1,000 days of ICU stay was calculated in 89 coronavirus disease 2019 patients, and the cumulative probability of bloodstream infection was estimated using death and ICU discharge as competing events. Sixty patients (67.4%) experienced at least one of the 93 recorded episodes of bloodstream infection, a frequency of 87 per 1,000 days of ICU stay (95% CI, 67-112).The patients who experienced a bloodstream infection had a higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score upon ICU admission (9.5; interquartile range, 8-12 vs 8, interquartile range, 5-10; p = 0.042), a longer median ICU stay (15 d; interquartile range, 11-23 vs 8, interquartile range, 5-12; p < 0.001), and more frequently required invasive mechanical ventilation (98.3% vs 82.8%; p = 0.013) than those who did not. The median time from ICU admission to the first bloodstream infection episode was 10 days. Gram-positive bacteria accounted for 74 episodes (79.6%), with Enterococcus species being the most prevalent (53 episodes, 55.8%). Thirty-two isolates (27.3%) showed multidrug resistance. CONCLUSIONS: Coronavirus disease 2019 seemed to increase the frequency of bloodstream infections (particularly Enterococcus-related bloodstream infection) after ICU admission.

If infection provides substantial long-lasting immunity, it may be appropriate to reconsider vaccination distribution plans. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study of one multi-hospital health system included 150,325 patients tested for COVID-19 infection via PCR from March 12, 2020 to August 30, 2020. Testing performed up to February 24, 2021 in these patients was included for analysis. The main outcome was reinfection, defined as infection &#8805; 90 days after initial testing. Secondary outcomes were symptomatic infection and protection of prior infection against reinfection. RESULTS: Of 150,325 patients, 8,845 (5.9%) tested positive and 141,480 (94.1%) tested negative prior to August 30. 1,278 (14.4%) of the positive patients were retested after 90 days, and 62 had possible reinfection. Of those, 31 (50%) were symptomatic. Of those with initial negative testing, 5,449 (3.9%) were subsequently positive and 3,191 of those (58.5%) were symptomatic. Protection offered from prior infection was 81.8% (95% confidence interval 76.6 to 85.8), and against symptomatic infection was 84.5% (95% confidence interval 77.9 to 89.1). This protection increased over time. CONCLUSIONS: Prior infection in patients with COVID-19 was highly protective against reinfection and symptomatic disease. This protection increased over time, suggesting that viral shedding or ongoing immune response may persist beyond 90 days and may not represent true reinfection. As vaccine supply is limited, patients with known history of COVID-19 could delay early vaccination to allow for the most vulnerable to access the vaccine and slow transmission.","Sheehan, Megan M; Reddy, Anita J; Rothberg, Michael B",Clin. infect. dis,417,16

Materials and methods: An AI system was fine-tuned to discriminate confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia, from other viral and bacterial pneumonia and non-pneumonia patients and used to review 302 CXR images from adult patients retrospectively sourced from nine different databases. Fifty-four physicians blind to diagnosis, were invited to interpret images under identical conditions in a test set, and randomly assigned either to receive or not receive support from the AI system. Comparisons were then made between diagnostic performance of physicians working with and without AI support. AI system performance was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC), and sensitivity and specificity of physician performance compared to that of the AI system. Results: Discrimination by the AI system of COVID-19 pneumonia showed an AUROC curve of 0.96 in the validation and 0.83 in the external test set, respectively. The AI system outperformed physicians in the AUROC overall (70% increase in sensitivity and 1% increase in specificity, pâ¯<â¯0.0001). When working with AI support, physicians increased their diagnostic sensitivity from 47% to 61% (pâ¯<â¯0.001), although specificity decreased from 79% to 75% (pâ¯=â¯0.007). Conclusions: Our results suggest interpreting chest radiographs (CXR) supported by AI, increases physician diagnostic sensitivity for COVID-19 detection. This approach involving a human-machine partnership may help expedite triaging efforts and improve resource allocation in the current crisis.","Dorr, Francisco; Chaves, Hernán; Serra, María Mercedes; Ramirez, Andrés; Costa, Martín Elías; Seia, Joaquín; Cejas, Claudia; Castro, Marcelo; Eyheremendy, Eduardo; Fernández Slezak, Diego; Farez, Mauricio F",Intell Based Med,417,26

We aimed to investigate the adverse events following immunization (AEFIs) for COVID-19 among healthcare workers (HCWs). METHODS: This was a retrospective study of the AEFIs associated with the first dose of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine at the Kosin University Gospel Hospital from March 3 to March 22, 2021. We investigated the systemic and local adverse events during the 7 days following the vaccination using the Mobile Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (MVAERS) developed by our hospital. RESULTS: A total of 1,503 HCWs were vaccinated, and the data of 994 HCWs were reported in the MVAERS. The most commonly reported AEFIs were tenderness at the injection site (94.5%), fatigue (92.9%), pain at the injection site (88.0%), and malaise (83.8%). The severity of most AEFIs was mild-to-moderate, and the severity and number of AEFIs were less in the older age group. There were no serious events requiring hospitalization, and most AEFIs improved within a few days. CONCLUSION: The AEFIs associated with the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine were tolerable, and the use of the MVAERS was helpful in monitoring the AEFIs. The use of MVAERS will help in sharing accurate and ample information about vaccination against COVID-19.","Jeon, Minji; Kim, Jehun; Oh, Chi Eun; Lee, Jin Young",J Korean Med Sci,417,16

This paper examines the development of measures applied by the Czech national government for compensating families with children during the COVID-19 crisis. It summarizes the aims of the measures as announced by the government or its ministries. This is supplemented by a summary of the available opinions of experts and other policy stakeholders. Based on this, the paper discusses the adequacy of the adopted measures and points out lessons for the future policymaking in the given area. A relatively high number of measures were identified. This suggests that the government strived for proactive policy to address families as a vulnerable social group. However, a rapid and sometimes unrestrained legislative process seems to have come at the expense of a proper public debate on the need for and impact of the new measures. Given the uncertain time horizon of the epidemic, the apparent lack of consideration regarding the budgetary implications of the measures seems worrying. © The Author(s) 2021.","Jahoda, R.; Malý, I.; Špaček, D.","Scientific Papers of the University of Pardubice, Series D: Faculty of Economics and Administration",417,24

For those with tinnitus, such changes can be factors in exacerbating tinnitus. The purpose of this study was to determine tinnitus help-seeking behavior, which resources individuals utilized to cope during the pandemic, and what additional support is desired. Method An exploratory cross-sectional study design including 1,522 adults with tinnitus living in North America (Canada and the United States) was used. Data were collected through an online survey distributed by the American Tinnitus Association via e-mail. Free text from open-ended questions was analyzed using the automated content analysis. The responses to the structured questionnaire were analyzed using descriptive and nonparametric statistics. Results Significantly less tinnitus support was sought during the pandemic, and very few respondents utilized tinnitus support networks during the pandemic at the time the survey was conducted. Nonetheless, seeking support during the pandemic was significantly associated with significantly less tinnitus distress. The most frequently utilized resources for coping during the pandemic were contacting family and friends, spending time outdoors or in nature, relaxation, and exercise. Such tools for coping were associated with significantly less tinnitus distress. The support requested and advice provided by participants to health care services had overlap. The main support needs related to managing tinnitus included addressing hearing loss, providing peer support, finding cures, and accessing trained and understanding health care providers to help. The advice for professionals related to tinnitus management included the need for cures, personalized support, addressing hearing loss, targeting the tinnitus percept, and providing more information about the condition. Conclusions These findings provide suggestions on how to better support those with tinnitus at a time when health care is undergoing rapid changes. Findings can be used by stakeholders, clinical practitioners, and tinnitus support services to devise ways to work more effectively together to improve access to patient-driven, suitable, accessible, and evidence-based support.

STUDY DESIGN: Observational study. PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY: Departments of Infection Disease, Internal Medicine and Radiology, Sakarya Training and Research Hospital, Sakarya, Turkey, between March and May 2020. METHODOLOGY: This study was consisted of 100 adult patients having rRT-PCR positive COVID-19 pneumonia diagnossed by thorax CT. The clinical features, thorax USG and CT findings of these patients were recorded and expressed. USG and thorax CT findings were scored using a method described before. Continuous variables were expressed as mean (±SD) values. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used for the normal distribution test, and continuous variables were compared using the Mann-Whitney U test. USG and CT performed at time of admission to the hospital. Descriptive statistics were conducted based on the structures of variable. RESULTS: A total of 100 patients (54 men and 46 women; mean age, 59.88±13.03 years; range, 28-91years) with COVID-19 pneumonia were evaluated. Involvement areas on the lower posterior of the right side were detected as 70% by ultrasound and 74% by CT. Positively correlation was detected in lung scans assessed by USG and CT (p<0.001, r=0.705). CONCLUSION: Ultrasound has several advantages including no ionizing radiation exposure for health care workers, being a safe, fast and non-invasive diagnostic technique with bedside usage. Hence, ultrasound is an efficient alternative to diagnosis and monitor of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.

PARTICIPANTS: The original SAABC comprised 449 women pregnant with an Aboriginal child recruited February 2011 to May 2012. At child age 2 years, 324 (74%) participants were retained, at age 3 years, 324 (74%) participants were retained and at age 5 years, 299 (69%) participants were retained. Fieldwork for follow-up at age 7 years is underway, with funding available for follow-up at age 9 years. FINDINGS TO DATE: At baseline, 53% of mothers were aged 14-24 years and 72% had high school or less educational attainment. At age 3 years, dental disease experience was higher among children exposed to the intervention later rather than earlier in infancy. The effect was sustained at age 5 years, but rates were still higher than general child population estimates. Experiences of racism were high among mothers, with impacts on both tooth brushing and toothache. Compared with population estimates, levels of self-efficacy and self-rated oral health of mothers at baseline were low. FUTURE PLANS: Our data have contributed to a better understanding of the environmental, behavioural, dietary, biological and psychosocial factors contributing to Aboriginal child oral and general health, and social and emotional well-being. This is beneficial in charting the trajectory of cohort participants' health and well-being overtime, particularly in identifying antecedents of chronic diseases which are highly prevalent among Aboriginal Australians. Funding for continued follow-up of the cohort will be sought.

The inability to control the virus' impact is caused by many factors, but the lack of a technology infrastructure to detect and impede the virus at an early stage are principal shortcomings. Using phage display mutagenesis, we have generated a cohort of high performance antibody fragments (Fabs) that can be used in a sensitive point of care (POC) assay and are potent inhibitors (IC50-0.5 nM) to viral entry into cells. The POC assay is based on a split-enzyme (ß-lactamase) complementation strategy that detects virus particles at low nM levels. We have shown that this assay is equally effective for detecting other viruses like Ebola and Zika.

Herein, sol-gel-based materials are applied to screen-selective aptamers for small molecules, such as pesticides. To enhance the efficiency of aptamer screening using a sol-gel, it is necessary to increase the binding surface. In this study, we applied the sol-gel to an anodized aluminum oxide (AAO) membrane, and the morphological features were observed via electron microscopy after spin coating. The binding and elution processes were conducted and confirmed by fluorescence microscopy and polymerase chain reaction. The sol-gel coating on the AAO membrane formed a hollow nanocolumn structure. A diazinon-binding aptamer was bound to the diazinon-containing sol-gel-coated AAO membrane, and the bound aptamer was effectively retrieved from the sol-gel matrix by thermal elution. As a proof of concept, a sol-gel-coated AAO disc was mounted on the edge of a pipette tip, and the feasibility of the prepared platform for the systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) of the aptamer binding was also confirmed.

Accordingly, it has been hypothesized to have a protective effect against COVID-19. Recent research found that countries with universal BCG childhood vaccination policies tend to be less affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. However, such ecological studies are biased by numerous confounders. Instead, this paper takes advantage of a rare nationwide natural experiment that took place in Sweden in 1975, where discontinuation of newborns BCG vaccination led to a dramatic fall of the BCG coverage rate, thus allowing us to estimate the BCG's effect without the biases associated with cross-country comparisons. METHODS: Numbers of COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations were recorded for birth cohorts born just before and just after 1975, representing 1,026,304 and 1,018,544 individuals, respectively. We used regression discontinuity to assess the effect of BCG vaccination on Covid-19 related outcomes. This method used on such a large population allows for a high precision that would be hard to achieve using a randomized controlled trial. RESULTS: The odds ratio for Covid-19 cases and Covid-19 related hospitalizations were 1·0005 (CI95: [0·8130-1·1881]) and 1·2046 (CI95: [0·7532-1·6560]), allowing us to reject fairly modest effects of universal BCG vaccination. We can reject with 95% confidence that universal BCG vaccination reduces the number of cases by 19% and the number of hospitalizations by 25%. CONCLUSIONS: While the effect of a recent vaccination must be evaluated, we provide strong evidence that receiving the BCG vaccine at birth does not have a protective effect against COVID-19 among middle-aged individuals.","de Chaisemartin, Clément; de Chaisemartin, Luc",Clin. infect. dis,417,5

With rising cases in many countries, and likely further peaks in the coming colder seasons, ventilator triage guidance remains a central part of the COVID-19 policy response. The dominant model in ventilator triage guidelines prioritises the ethical principles of saving the most lives and saving the most life-years. We sought to ascertain to what extent this focus aligns, or conflicts, with the preferences of disadvantaged minority populations. We conducted a bibliographical search of PubMed and Google Scholar and reviewed all ventilator rationing guidelines included in major recent systematic reviews, yielding 589 studies before screening. Post screening, we found six studies comprising a total of 10 591 participants, with 1247 from disadvantaged populations. Three studies reported findings stratified by race and age, two of which stratified by income. Studies included two to seven principles; all included 'save the most lives'. Involvement of disadvantaged minority populations in eliciting preferences is very limited; few studies capture race and income. This is concerning, as despite relatively small numbers and framing effects there is an observable and plausible trend suggesting that disadvantaged groups worry that dominant principles reduce their chances of receiving a ventilator. To avoid compounding prior historical and structural disadvantage, policy makers need to engage more fully with these populations in designing and justifying ventilator rationing guidance and review their adequacy. Likewise, clinicians need to be aware that their implementation of dominant triage guidelines is viewed with higher levels of concern by minority populations.","Kerr, Whitney; Schmidt, Harald",J. med. ethics,417,24

This paper aimed to investigate the effect of nutrients on the immune system and their possible roles in the prevention, treatment, and management of COVID-19 in adults. METHODS: This Systematic review was designed based on the guideline of the Preferred Reporting for Systematic Reviews (PRISMA). The articles that focussed on nutrition, immune system, viral infection, and coronaviruses were collected by searching databases for both published papers and accepted manuscripts from 1990 to 2020. Irrelevant papers and articles without English abstract were excluded from the review process. RESULTS: Some nutrients are actively involved in the proper functioning and strengthening of the human immune system against viral infections including dietary protein, omega-3 fatty acids, vitamin A, vitamin D, vitamin E, vitamin B1, vitamin B6, vitamin B12, vitamin C, iron, zinc, and selenium. Few studies were done on the effect of dietary components on prevention of COVID-19, but supplementation with these nutrients may be effective in improving the health status of patients with viral infections. CONCLUSION: Following a balanced diet and supplementation with proper nutrients may play a vital role in prevention, treatment, and management of COVID-19.

We, therefore, compared SARS-CoV-2 with such known viruses that were prepared in the laboratory and other relevant natural strains to estimate their genetic relatedness. MATERIALS AND METHODS: BLAST and clustalW were used to identify and align viral sequences of SARS-CoV-2 to other animal coronaviruses (human, bat, mouse, pangolin) and related artificial constructs. Phylogenetics trees were then prepared using iTOL. RESULTS: Our study supports the notion that known artificial coronaviruses, including the chimeric SL-SHC014-MA15 synthesized in 2015, differ too much from SARS-CoV-2 to hypothesize an artificial origin of the latter. On the contrary, our data support the natural origin of the COVID-19 virus, likely derived from bats, possibly transferred to pangolins, before spreading to man. CONCLUSIONS: Speculations about the artificial origin of SARS-CoV-2 are most likely unfounded. On the contrary, when carefully handled, engineered organisms provide a unique opportunity to study biological systems in a controlled fashion. Biotechnology is a powerful tool to advance medical research and should not be abandoned because of irrational fears.","Dallavilla, T; Bertelli, M; Morresi, A; Bushati, V; Stuppia, L; Beccari, T; Chiurazzi, P; Marceddu, G",Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,417,1

This study aims to compare the epidemiology and the clinical characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 infection in asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals. METHODS: A total of 511 confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection cases, including 100 asymptomatic (by the time of the pathogenic tests) and 411 symptomatic individuals were consecutively enrolled from January 25 to February 20, 2020 from hospitals in 21 cities and 47 counties or districts in Sichuan Province. Epidemiological and clinical characteristics were compared. RESULTS: Compared to the symptomatic patients, the asymptomatic cases were younger (P < 0.001), had similar co-morbidity percentages (P = 0.609), and came from higher altitude areas with lower population mobility (P < 0.001) with better defined epidemiological history (P < 0.001). 27.4% of well-documented asymptomatic cases developed delayed symptoms after the pathogenic diagnosis. 60% of asymptomatic cases demonstrated findings of pneumonia on the initial chest CT, including well-recognized features of coronavirus disease-19. None of the asymptomatic individuals died. Two elderly individuals with initially asymptomatic infection developed severe symptoms during hospitalization. One case of possible virus transmission by a patient during the incubation period was highly suspected. CONCLUSIONS: The epidemiological and clinical findings highlight the significance of asymptomatic infection with SARS-CoV-2. Inspecting the epidemiological history would facilitate the identification of asymptomatic cases. Evidence supports the chest CT scans for confirmed asymptomatic cases to evaluate the extent of lung involvement.","Kong, Weifang; Wang, Yuting; Hu, Jinliang; Chughtai, Aamer; Pu, Hong",Travel Med Infect Dis,417,2

Logistic regression analysis was used to explore the relationships among prognosis, clinical characteristics and laboratory indexes. The predictive value of this model was assessed with receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, calibration and internal validation. The viral shedding duration was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and the prognostic factors were analysed by univariate log-rank analysis and the Cox proportional hazards model. A retrospective study was carried out with patients with COVID-19 in Tianjin, China. A total of 185 patients were included, 27 (14.59%) of whom were severely ill at the time of discharge and three (1.6%) of whom died. Our findings demonstrate that patients with an advanced age, diabetes, a low PaO2/FiO2 value and delayed treatment should be carefully monitored for disease progression to reduce the incidence of severe disease. Hypoproteinaemia and the fever duration warrant special attention. Timely interventions in symptomatic patients and a time from symptom onset to treatment <4 days can shorten the duration of viral shedding.","Han, Jing; Shi, Li-Xia; Xie, Yi; Zhang, Yong-Jin; Huang, Shu-Ping; Li, Jian-Guo; Wang, He-Rong; Shao, Shi-Feng",Epidemiol Infect,417,15

We provide a broad review of the clinical evolution of COVID-19, emphasizing its impact and implications on the cardiovascular system. The pathophysiology of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is characterized by overproduction of inflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and TNF-&#945;) leading to systemic inflammation and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, acutely affecting the cardiovascular system. Hypertension (56.6%) and diabetes (33.8%) are the most prevalent comorbidities among individuals with COVID-19, who require hospitalization. Furthermore, cardiac injury, defined as elevated us-troponin I, significantly relates to inflammation biomarkers (IL-6 and C-reactive protein (CRP), hyperferritinemia, and leukocytosis), portraying an important correlation between myocardial injury and inflammatory hyperactivity triggered by viral infection. Increased risk for myocardial infarction, fulminant myocarditis rapidly evolving with depressed systolic left ventricle function, arrhythmias, venous thromboembolism, and cardiomyopathies mimicking STEMI presentations are the most prevalent cardiovascular complications described in patients with COVID-19. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 tropism and interaction with the RAAS system, through ACE2 receptor, possibly enhances inflammation response and cardiac aggression, leading to imperative concerns about the use of ACEi and ARBs in infected patients. Cardiovascular implications result in a worse prognosis in patients with COVID-19, emphasizing the importance of precocious detection and implementation of optimal therapeutic strategies.","Azevedo, Rafael Bellotti; Botelho, Bruna Gopp; Hollanda, João Victor Gonçalves de; Ferreira, Leonardo Villa Leão; Junqueira de Andrade, Letícia Zarur; Oei, Stephanie Si Min Lilienwald; Mello, Tomás de Souza; Muxfeldt, Elizabeth Silaid",J. hum. hypertens,417,6

Design/methodology/approach: This study used an online survey for data collection by distributing online questionnaires to students at a private university in Indonesia. Convenience sampling was applied as the sample method. A total of 253 valid questionnaires were acquired, and all items were recorded on the seven-point comparative scale. Exploratory factor analysis was adopted to identify the dimensions of perceived quality. Then, multiple regression analysis was used to examine the impacts of these dimensions on student satisfaction. Findings: Four dimensions of perceived quality differences were identified, namely, the perceived quality of the campus facilities, learning process, teaching staff and administrative staff. Regression analysis results proved that the perceived differences in the quality dimensions between the traditional classroom and online distance learning had positive and significant effects on student satisfaction. Research limitations/implications: As a result of using a convenient sample, this study exhibited a limited sample and context. Therefore, the generalizability of these findings is limited. Future research can use a stratified sample with more diverse categories of respondents. Practical implications: The findings of this study will help universities that plan to change the mode of learning from traditional classroom to online distance learning. Higher education institutions can gain a deep understanding of these perceived quality attributes that have significant impacts on student satisfaction.

impact on public health and socio-economic matters The magnitude of COVID-19 has undoubtedly affected every aspect of daily life and highlighted the need for increased preparedness, coordination, and monitoring Amongst all social groups, the elderly is by far the most affected age group in morbidity and mortality [1] Approximately 1 3 million individuals live in 15,600 nursing home facilities in the United States [2] In fact, the beginning of COVID-19 may be marked by the 25 deaths in a single King County facility in Washington state Nursing homes have faced the rapid spread of COVID-19 among residents and staff and have been at the center of the public health emergency during the pandemic Factors that contribute to this rapid spread include crowding, sharing of bathroom facilities, and gathering in common areas that are not set up for infection control Nursing homes, in particular, provide ideal environments for devastating infections to spread Nursing homes, in particular, have essentially been in complete lockdown, not unlike inmates, who both deeply lack social interaction and are currently unable to exist outside the walls of their respective institutions Those who do not have close family or friends, and rely on the support of voluntary services or social workers, could be at additional risk [6] To lessen the chance of infection among older people in nursing homes, more local authorities are banning visitors to nursing homes and long-term care facilities Furthermore, restrictions on group activities such as playing board games, watching TV in a common space, and engaging in art therapy, may harm residents’ mental and physical well-being [8] Nursing home residents are already susceptible to loneliness, and the lack of social interaction due to decreased visitation from family and friends further compounds the traumatization of COVID-19 on daily living Methods METHODS: This is a descriptive study over a period of 1 month conducted among nursing home staff in Lubbock, TX during the COVID-19 pandemic Agreeable nursing home staff will have access to a survey (Qualtrics) accessing various aspects relating to the consequences of COVID-19 The survey will be open for a period of 1 month until which the participants will have the opportunity to complete the survey Data from the surveys will then be collected and analyzed The survey consists of a self-developed questionnaire along with the validated Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) The scale which was originally developed in 1983 by author Sheldon Cohen is one of the most widely used tools to measure the perception of stress It has been used in studies assessing the stressfulness of situations and is widely available in the public domain [12] Type of study: Descriptive mixed method triangulation design study Subjects: Healthcare staff with direct patient care Inclusion criteria: 1 Geriatric Nursing home staff in Lubbock, TX 2 Staff agreeable to participate in survey regardless of color, creed, age or sex 3 Staff in direct contact with patients (Nursing and Physicians) Exclusion criteria: 1 Ancillary staff not involved in direct patient care 2 Staff who refuse to give voluntary consent to participate in survey Design: This will be a descriptive, mixed method triangulation design studyutilizing an online, self-administered survey tool created using Qualtrics platform An information sheet explaining the research project will be given to the nursing home staff It will include: participation is completely voluntary, that participation will not affect their employment in anyway, and their employer will not have access to the results It will also explain that by submitting an anonymous survey they are agreeing to take part in the research study The survey questions will gauge mental health impact on staff and their perspectives on the impact on patients and their own mental health The survey will contain a mix of 10 close- and open-ended questions Results Outcomes: To determine the impact of COVID-19 on nursing home staff mental health and gather information that may be utilized to create measures to better deliver care in nursing homes Survey will be sent to 40 members with an expected response rate of about 20 percent and possibly higher Results will be available by March 2020 for further analysis and distribution Conclusions Ultimately, COVID-19 has taught painful lessons in the difficulties of isolating the elderly The need for controlling infection may come at a high cost to the mental health and well-being of patients and staff, which is a critical public health issue We hope that the results of this study will help us better understand the challenges geriatric nursing facilities have faced during the COVID-19 pandemic and

The National Institutes of Health called on digital health leaders to contribute to a high-quality data repository that will support researchers to make discoveries that are otherwise not possible with small, limited data sets. OBJECTIVE: To this end, we seek to develop a COVID-19 digital biomarker for early detection of physiological exacerbation or decompensation. We propose the development and validation of a COVID-19 decompensation Index (CDI) in a 2-phase study that builds on existing wearable biosensor-derived analytics generated by physIQ's end-to-end cloud platform for continuous physiological monitoring with wearable biosensors. This effort serves to achieve two primary objectives: (1) to collect adequate data to help develop the CDI and (2) to collect rich deidentified clinical data correlating with outcomes and symptoms related to COVID-19 progression. Our secondary objectives include evaluation of the feasibility and usability of pinpointIQ, a digital platform through which data are gathered, analyzed, and displayed. METHODS: This is a prospective, nonrandomized, open-label, 2-phase study. Phase I will involve data collection for the digital data hub of the National Institutes of Health as well as data to support the preliminary development of the CDI. Phase II will involve data collection for the hub and contribute to continued refinement and validation of the CDI. While this study will focus on the development of a CDI, the digital platform will also be evaluated for feasibility and usability while clinicians deliver care to continuously monitored patients enrolled in the study. RESULTS: Our target CDI will be a binary classifier trained to distinguish participants with and those without decompensation. The primary performance metric for CDI will be the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve with a minimum performance criterion of &#8805;0.75 (&#945;=.05; power [1-ß]=0.80). Furthermore, we will determine the sex or gender and race or ethnicity of the participants, which would account for differences in the CDI performance, as well as the lead time-time to predict decompensation-and its relationship with the ultimate disease severity based on the World Health Organization COVID-19 ordinal scale. CONCLUSIONS: Using machine learning techniques on a large data set of patients with COVID-19 could provide valuable insights into the pathophysiology of COVID-19 and a digital biomarker for COVID-19 decompensation. Through this study, we intend to develop a tool that can uniquely reflect physiological data of a diverse population and contribute to high-quality data that will help researchers better understand COVID-19.

This project is aimed at using pulverized low-density polyethylene (LDPE) waste as a source to reinforce and improve compressive strength, and to reduce the water absorption of geopolymer ceramics (GC). Clay:LDPE composition consisting of 5%, 10%, and 15% LDPE was geopolymerized with an NaOH/Na2SiO3 solution and cured at 30 °C and 50 °C. Characterization of the geopolymer samples was carried out using XRF and XRD. The microstructure was analyzed by SEM and chemical bonding by FTIR. The SEM micrographs showed LDPE particle pull-out on the geopolymer ceramics’ fracture surface. The result showed that the compressive strength increases with the addition of pulverized polymer waste compared to the controlled without LDPE addition. Water absorption decreased with an increase in LDPE addition in the geopolymer ceramics composite.","Numfor, Linda Bih Assia Aboubakar Mahamat Hounkpè Jechonias Bidossèssi Peter Azikiwe Onwualu Boakye Emmanuel E.",Applied Sciences,417,31

While video visits have certain advantages, such as the ability to see the children in their home, they also have potential drawbacks, as some exam maneuvers and objective measurement tools cannot be performed virtually. The increased utilization of telemedicine also raises questions about access to care. Video visits can remove the transportation and time barriers that some families face. However, they raise new barriers, such as a requirement for home internet access and insurance coverage, that may negatively impact access to care for certain patients. Moving forward, a combination of clinic and video visits in pediatric rehabilitation may be the best way to harness the advantages of both modalities while minimizing their disadvantages.

This study aimed to determine the usefulness of anakinra as a rescue treatment for patients with tocilizumab-refractory COVID-19 disease. METHODS: A prospective cohort of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia who received anakinra as salvage therapy after failure of tocilizumab were compared (1:1) with selected controls in a historical cohort of patients treated with tocilizumab. Cases and controls were matched by age, comorbidities, pulse oximetry oxygen saturation to fraction of inspired oxygen (SpO2/FiO2) ratio at baseline, and time elapsed since the initiation of treatment with tocilizumab. The primary outcome was the improvement in clinical status measured by a 6-point ordinal scale, from baseline to day 21. RESULTS: The study included 20 cases and 20 controls (mean age 65.3 ± 12.8 years, 65% males). No differences were found in the clinical improvement rates at 7, 14 and 21 days of follow-up. The in-hospital mortality rate for patients receiving anakinra was 55% vs. 45% in the control group (P = 0.527).

A randomised control trial (RCT) for a novel smartphone app-based model of care, named TeleClinical Care - Cardiac (TCC-Cardiac), commenced in February 2019, targeted at patients being discharged after care for an acute coronary syndrome or episode of decompensated heart failure. The app was paired to a digital sphygmomanometer, weighing scale and a wearable fitness band, all loaned to the patient, and allowed clinicians to respond to abnormal readings. The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic necessitated several modifications to the trial in order to protect participants from potential exposure to infection. The use of TCC-Cardiac during the pandemic inspired the development of a similar model of care (TCC-COVID), targeted at patients being managed at home with a diagnosis of COVID-19. METHODS: Recruitment for the TCC-Cardiac trial was terminated shortly after the World Health Organization announced COVID-19 as a global pandemic. Telephone follow-up was commenced, in order to protect patients from unnecessary exposure to hospital staff and patients. Equipment was returned or collected by a 'no-contact' method. The TCC-COVID app and model of care had similar functionality to the original TCC-Cardiac app. Participants were enrolled exclusively by remote methods. Oxygen saturation and pulse rate were measured by a pulse oximeter, and symptomatology measured by questionnaire. Measurement results were manually entered into the app and transmitted to an online server for medical staff to review. RESULTS: A total of 164 patients were involved in the TCC-Cardiac trial, with 102 patients involved after the onset of the pandemic. There were no hospitalisations due to COVID-19 in this cohort. The study was successfully completed, with only three participants lost to follow-up. During the pandemic, 5 of 49 (10%) of patients in the intervention arm were readmitted compared to 12 of 53 (23%) in the control arm. Also, in this period, 28 of 29 (97%) of all clinically significant alerts received by the monitoring team were managed successfully in the outpatient setting, avoiding hospitalisation. Patients found the user experience largely positive, with the average rating for the app being 4.56 out of 5. 26 patients have currently been enrolled for TCC-COVID. Recruitment is ongoing. All patients have been safely and effectively monitored, with no major adverse clinical events or technical malfunctions. Patient satisfaction has been high. CONCLUSION: The TCC-Cardiac RCT was successfully completed despite the challenges posed by COVID-19. Use of the app had an added benefit during the pandemic as participants could be monitored safely from home. The model of care inspired the development of an app with similar functionality designed for use with patients diagnosed with COVID-19.","Indraratna, Praveen; Biswas, Uzzal; Yu, Jennifer; Schreier, Guenter; Ooi, Sze-Yuan; Lovell, Nigel H; Redmond, Stephen J",Yearb. med. inform.

advice guide was developed in accordance with the WHO handbook for guideline development, supported by a core group, a WHO steering group, a guideline development group and an external review group of international experts Scoping thematic discussions determined the focus areas and the key questions to be addressed The relevant evidence was systematically reviewed, and the quality of the evidence for key outcomes was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach Evidence-to-decision tables were used to interpret health and contextual evidence relating to each of the key questions A set of online technical consultations of the guideline development group took place between 30 April and 8 May 2020 Prior to the technical consultation, all contributors declared any potential conflicts of interest, and their declared interest forms were reviewed and managed in accordance with the relevant WHO procedures The guideline development group and external reviewers reviewed the draft rapid advice guide prior to executive clearance of the final version and publication This guide provides recommendations for six different clinical scenarios Due to the limited available evidence the guideline development group made conditional recommendations, which implies that the balance between benefits and harms of chest imaging may vary in different situations Therefore, remarks are included to describe the circumstances under which each recommendation would benefit patients In addition, the document provides considerations about implementation of the recommendations and suggestions for monitoring and evaluation (i e some outcome and performance measures were identified for assessing the impact of the adoption of the recommendations) The guideline development group and the external review group identified knowledge gaps meriting further research, which are included in this guide as well Desde sua identificação na China em dezembro de 2019, o novo coronavírus responsável pela COVID-19 evoluiu rapidamente para uma pandemia A COVID-19 se manifesta com sintomas respiratórios inespecíficos de gravidade variável e pode exigir suporte respiratório avançado Atualmente, o diagnóstico de COVID-19 é confirmado por testes laboratoriais através da identificação de RNA viral na reação em cadeia da polimerase com transcriptase reversa (RT-PCR) Os exames de imagem de tórax foram considerados como parte da investigação diagnóstica de pacientes com suspeita ou probabilidade de COVID-19, nos lugares em que a RT-PCR não está disponível ou em que os resultados demoram ou são inicialmente negativos na presença de sintomas sugestivos de COVID-19 Os exames de imagem também foram considerados na complementação da avaliação clínica e dos parâmetros laboratoriais no tratamento de pacientes já diagnosticados com COVID-19 Antes de iniciar o desenvolvimento deste guia, vários estados-membros solicitaram um parecer da OMS sobre o papel dos exames de imagem do tórax em pacientes com suspeita ou confirmação de COVID-19 Uma revisão das práticas de exames de imagem em pacientes com suspeita ou confirmação de COVID-19 em todo o mundo encontrou grandes variações Isso motivou o desenvolvimento de diretrizes globais sobre o uso de exames de imagem de tórax para apoiar os estados membros na resposta à pandemia da COVID-19 Este guia de aconselhamento rápido examina as evidências e faz recomendações para o uso de exames de imagem do tórax em pacientes agudos com suspeita, probabilidade ou confirmação de COVID-19, incluindo radiografia de tórax, tomografia computadorizada (TC) e ultrassonografia pulmonar Destina-se a ser um guia prático para os profissionais de saúde envolvidos na evolução da atenção à COVID-19, desde o momento de chegada a um estabelecimento de saúde até a alta hospitalar A orientação é relevante para pacientes com diferentes níveis de gravidade da doença, desde indivíduos assintomáticos a pacientes críticos Este guia de aconselhamento rápido foi desenvolvido de acordo com o manual da OMS para o desenvolvimento de diretrizes, apoiado por um grupo principal, um grupo diretor da OMS, um grupo de desenvolvimento de diretrizes e um grupo de revisão externa de especialistas internacionais As discussões temáticas sobre o escopo determinaram as áreas de enfoque e as perguntas-chave a serem abordadas As evidências relevantes foram sistematicamente analisadas e a qualidade da evidência para os desfechos principais foi avaliada usando a abordagem Classificação de Recomendações, Avaliação, Desenvolvimento e Análises (GRADE) Foram usadas tabelas de evidências para tomada de decisão para interpretar as evidências de saúde e contextuais relacionadas a cada uma das perguntas-chave Uma série de consultas técnicas on-line do grupo de desenvolvimento de diretrizes ocorreu entre 30 de abril e 8 de maio de 2020 Antes da consulta técnica, todos os colaboradores declararam possíveis conflitos de interesse e seus formulários de interesse declarados foram analisados e gerenciados de acordo com os procedimentos relevantes da OMS O grupo de desenvolvimento de diretrizes e os revisores externos analisaram o rascunho do guia de aconselhamento rápido antes da liberação executiva da versão final e publicação Este guia fornece recomendações para seis contextos clínicos diferentes Devido à limitada evidência disponível, o grupo de desenvolvimento de diretrizes fez recomendações condicionais, o que implica que o equilíbrio entre benefícios e danos dos exames de imagem do tórax pode variar em diferentes situações Portanto, são incluídas observações para descrever as circunstâncias em que cada recomendação beneficiaria os pacientes Além disso, o documento fornece considerações sobre a implementação das recomendações e sugestões para monitoramento e avaliação (ou seja, algumas medidas de desfechos e desempenho foram identificadas para avaliar o impacto da adoção das recomendações) O grupo de desenvolvimento de diretrizes e o grupo de revisão externa identificaram lacunas de conhecimento que mereciam mais pesquisas, que também estão incluídas neste guia A partir de que el SARS-CoV-2 se detectó en China en diciembre de 2019, la COVID-19 se ha convertido rápidamente en una pandemia Los pacientes con COVID-19 presentan síntomas respiratorios inespecíficos de intensidad variable y en ocasiones se les debe prestar ventilación asistida avanzada Actualmente, el diagnóstico de COVID-19 se confirma mediante la realización de pruebas analíticas, a saber, la determinación de ARN vírico a través de la reacción en cadena de la polimerasa con retrotranscriptasa (RT PCR) Se ha determinado que los estudios radiológicos de tórax son parte de la evaluación diagnóstica de los casos presuntos o probables de COVID-19 cuando no se dispone de RT PCR, en caso de que los resultados de los análisis se retrasen o si la primera prueba aplicada a un paciente que presenta síntomas indicativos de COVID-19 da negativo Además, se ha determinado que las técnicas de imagen son un complemento del reconocimiento médico y de las pruebas analíticas que se efectúan como parte de la atención a los pacientes con diagnóstico de COVID-19 Antes de que se comenzara a redactar el presente manual, varios Estados Miembros solicitaron orientación a la OMS sobre la función de los estudios radiológicos de tórax en la evaluación de los pacientes con diagnóstico presunto o confirmado de COVID-19 En un análisis que se efectuó sobre las prácticas relativas a las técnicas de imagen en pacientes con diagnóstico presunto o confirmado de COVID-19 en todo el mundo se determinó que existían amplias diferencias Esa fue la razón de que se elaborara un manual general relativo a la utilización de estudios radiológicos de tórax destinado a asistir a los Estados Miembros en las actividades de respuesta a la pandemia de COVID-19 En el presente manualde orientación rápida se analizan datos científicos y se formulan recomendaciones relativas a la utilización de técnicas de imagen de tórax en la atención de urgencias y de medicina crítica que se presta a pacientes adultos con diagnóstico presunto, probable o confirmado de COVID-19, a saber, la radiografía de tórax, la tomografía axial computadorizada (TAC) y la ecografía pulmonar El manual tiene por objeto servir como orientación práctica para los profesionales de la salud que participan en el protocolo asistencial de la COVID-19, desde el momento en el que los pacientes solicitan atención en un establecimiento sanitario hasta que reciben el alta médica Las orientaciones son pertinentes para pacientes que cursan con COVID-19 de distinta gravedad, desde los enfermos asintomáticos hasta los que se encuentran en estado crítico El presente manual de orientación rápida se redactó de conformidad con el Manual de la OMS para la elaboración de directrices, con la colaboración de un grupo principal, un grupo de orientación de la OMS, un grupo de elaboración de directrices y un grupo externo de examen conformado por expertos internacionales La celebración de debates temáticos relativos al alcance, permitieron definir las áreas de enfoque y las preguntas clave que se abordan en el manual Los datos científicos pertinentes fueron objeto de una revisión sistemática, y la calidad de los datos que respaldan las principales conclusiones se evaluó por medio del enfoque de Clasificación de la evaluación, desarrollo y valoración de las recomendaciones (GRADE) Se utilizaron tablas de transición desde los datos científicos hasta las recomendaciones a fin de interpretar los datos probatorios de salud y de contexto relacionados con cada una de las preguntas clave Entre el 30 de abril y el 8 de mayo de 2020 el grupo de elaboración de directrices celebró una serie de consultas técnicas por vía telemática Antes de que se celebraran las consultas técnicas, todos los colaboradores presentaron una declaración de posibles conflictos de intereses, y los formularios en los que declararon sus intereses fueron objeto de examen y se gestionaron de conformidad con los procedimientos pertinentes de la OMS El grupo de e aboración de directrices y los examinadores externos analizaron la versión preliminar del manual de orientación rápida;posteriormente, la versión final recibió la aprobación de la dirección y se publicó En el presente manual se proporcionan recomendaciones para abordar seis situaciones clínicas distintas Debido a los escasos datos científicos disponibles, el grupo de elaboración de directrices formuló recomendaciones condicionales, lo que supone que es posible que del análisis de los beneficios y los perjuicios de los estudios radiológicos de tórax se extraigan distintas conclusiones en diversas circunstancias Por consiguiente, en el manual se incluyen observaciones que detallan las circunstancias en las que cada recomendación podría ser de utilidad para los pacientes Además, en el documento se proporcionan observaciones relativas a la puesta en práctica de las recomendaciones y sugerencias relacionadas con la supervisión y la evaluación (es decir, se determinaron algunos criterios de valoración e indicadores de desempeño a fin de evaluar la repercusión de la adopción de las recomendaciones) El grupo de elaboración de directrices y el grupo externo de examen definieron las lagunas de conocimiento que ameritan realizar más investigación y que también figuran en el presente manual Depuis son identification en Chine en décembre 2019, le nouveau coronavirus responsable de la COVID­19 s&#039;est rapidement propagé pour causer une pandémie Cette maladie se manifeste par des symptômes respiratoires non spécifiques de gravité variable et peut nécessiter une assistance respiratoire importante Son diagnostic est actuellement confirmé grâce l&#039;identification de l&#039;ARN du virus grâce à un test de laboratoire utilisant la technique de la transcription inverse-amplification génique (en anglais, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, soit RT-PCR) Le recours à l&#039;imagerie thoracique dans le cadre du bilan diagnostique est envisagé chez les patients présentant une COVID­19 présumée ou probable lorsque le test RT-PCR n&#039;est pas disponible, ou que les résultats tardent à être disponibles ou sont initialement négatifs en présence de symptômes suggérant une COVID­19 Il est également envisagé pour compléter l&#039;évaluation clinique et les paramètres biologiques lors de la prise en charge des patients chez qui un diagnostic de COVID­19 a été posé Avant que l&#039;élaboration de ce guide n&#039;ait commencé, plusieurs États Membres ont demandé l&#039;avis de l&#039;OMS sur le rôle de l&#039;imagerie thoracique dans le cadre du bilan diagnostique des patients présentant une COVID­19 présumée ou confirmée Un examen au niveau mondial des pratiques d&#039;imagerie chez les patients présentant une COVID­19 présumée ou confirmée a révélé d&#039;importantes variations Ceci a motivé l&#039;élaboration d&#039;un guide mondial sur l&#039;utilisation de l&#039;imagerie thoracique pour aider les États Membres dans leur riposte à la pandémie de COVID­19 Ce guide examine les données probantes disponibles et fournit des recommandations sur l&#039;utilisation de l&#039;imagerie thoracique, y compris de la radiographie thoracique, de la tomodensitométrie et de l&#039;échographie pulmonaire, lors de la prise en charge aiguë des patients adultes atteints de COVID­19 Il est conçu comme un guide pratique à l&#039;intention des agents de santé impliqués dans le parcours de soins de patients présentant une COVID­19 présumée, probable ou confirmée, depuis leur présentation dans un établissement de santé jusqu&#039;à leur sortie pour un retour à domicile Ces orientations concernent les patients présentant différents niveaux de gravité de la maladie, depuis les personnes asymptomatiques jusqu&#039;à celles présentant une forme grave L&#039;élaboration de ce guide de recommandations rapides a suivi le processus décrit dans le manuel de l&#039;OMS WHO handbook for guideline development et a reçu l&#039;appui d&#039;un groupe central, d&#039;un groupe d&#039;orientation de l&#039;OMS, d&#039;un groupe d&#039;élaboration des lignes directrices et d&#039;un groupe chargé de l&#039;examen externe Tous ces groupes étaient composés d&#039;experts internationaux Des discussions thématiques destinées à définir le champ d&#039;application de ce guide ont permis de déterminer les domaines d&#039;intervention et les questions clés à aborder Un examen systématique des données pertinentes a été réalisé et la qualité des données pour les principaux résultats a été évaluée en utilisant l&#039;approche « grade donné aux recommandations, examen, élaboration et évaluation ¼ (en anglais, Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation, soit GRADE) Des tableaux des données probantes à l&#039;appui des décisions ont été utilisés pour interpréter les données probantes concernant la santé et le contexte relatives à chacune des questions clés Le groupe d&#039;élaboration des lignes directrices s&#039;est réuni au cours d&#039;une série de consultations techniques qui se sont tenues en ligne entre le 30 avril et le 8 mai 2020 Avant cette consultation technique, chaque contributeur a déclaré tout conflit d&#039;intérêts potentiel, et les formulaires de déclaration d&#039;ntérêts ont été examinés et gérés conformément aux procédures de l&#039;OMS en la matière Une version préliminaire de ce guide a été examinée par le groupe d&#039;élaboration des lignes directrices ainsi que par des évaluateurs externes avant que la version finale ne soit approuvée et publiée Ce guide fournit des recommandations pour six scénarios cliniques différents Du fait de la quantité limitée de données probantes disponibles, les recommandations formulées par le groupe d&#039;élaboration des lignes directrices sont soumises à conditions, ce qui implique que l&#039;équilibre entre les avantages et les inconvénients de l&#039;imagerie thoracique peut varier selon les situations Des remarques ont donc été incluses afin de décrire les circonstances dans lesquelles chaque recommandation pourrait être bénéfique pour les patients En outre, le document fournit des éléments à prendre en considération pour la mise en Åuvre de ces recommandations ainsi que des suggestions pour le suivi et l&#039;évaluation (c&#039;est-à-dire que des mesures des résultats et des performances obtenus ont été identifiées pour évaluer l&#039;impact de l&#039;adoption de ces recommandations) Le groupe d&#039;élaboration des lignes directrices et le groupe chargé de l&#039;examen externe ont identifié des lacunes dans les connaissances qui méritent d&#039;être comblées par des travaux de recherche plus approfondis ;ces lacunes ont également été incluses dans

The sheer number of pathogens that have appeared, along with their abundance in the environment, demand our attention. For the most part, our innate and adaptive immune systems have successfully protected us from infection; however, in the past 5 decades, through pathogen mutation and ecosystem disruption, a dozen viruses emerged to cause significant neurologic disease. Most of these pathogens have come from sylvatic reservoirs having made the energetically difficult, and fortuitously rare, jump into humans. But the human microbiome is also replete with agents already adapted to the host that need only minor mutations to create neurotropic/toxic agents. While each host/virus symbiosis is unique, this review examines virologic and immunologic principles that govern the pathogenesis of different viral CNS infections that were described in the past 50 years (Influenza, West Nile Virus, Zika, Rift Valley Fever Virus, Hendra/Nipah, Enterovirus-A71/-D68, Human parechovirus, HIV, and SARS-CoV). Knowledge of these pathogens provides us the opportunity to respond and mitigate infection while at the same time prepare for inevitable arrival of unknown agents.","Wiley, Clayton A",J Neuropathol Exp Neurol,417,24

These measures comprised, among others, social distancing, the temporary closure of shops and schools, and a ban of large public gatherings and meetings with people not living in the same household. OBJECTIVE: It is fair to assume that the issued NPIs have heavily affected social life and psychological functioning. We therefore aimed to examine possible effects of this lockdown in conjunction with daily new infections and the state of the national economy on people's interests, motives, and other psychological states. METHODS: We derived 249 keywords from the Google Trends database, tapping into 27 empirically and rationally selected psychological domains. To overcome issues with reliability and specificity of individual indicator variables, broad factors were derived by means of time series factor analysis. All domains were subjected to a change point analysis and time series regression analysis with infection rates, NPIs, and the state of the economy as predictors. All keywords and analyses were preregistered prior to analysis. RESULTS: With the pandemic arriving in Germany, significant increases in people's search interests were observed in virtually all domains. Although most of the changes were short-lasting, each had a distinguishable onset during the lockdown period. Regression analysis of the Google Trends data confirmed pronounced autoregressive effects for the investigated variables, while forecasting by means of the tested predictors (ie, daily new infections, NPIs, and the state of economy) was moderate at best. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that people's interests, motives, and psychological states are heavily affected in times of crisis and lockdown. Specifically, disease- and virus-related domains (eg, pandemic disease, symptoms) peaked early, whereas personal health strategies (eg, masks, homeschooling) peaked later during the lockdown. Domains addressing social life and psychosocial functioning showed long-term increases in public interest. Renovation was the only domain to show a decrease in search interest with the onset of the lockdown. As changes in search behavior are consistent over multiple domains, a Google Trends analysis may provide information for policy makers on how to adapt and develop intervention, information, and prevention strategies, especially when NPIs are in effect.","Rotter, Dominik; Doebler, Philipp; Schmitz, Florian",J Med Internet Res,417,24

Within this context, the present study aimed to explore undergraduate medical students' perceptions regarding the effectiveness of synchronized online learning at Unaizah College of Medicine and Medical Sciences, Qassim University, Saudi Arabia. METHODS: A qualitative study was conducted using virtual focus group discussions synchronously with the help of a discussion guide consisting of seven open-ended questions. Overall, 60 medical students were recruited using a maximum variation sampling technique; these students then participated in eight focus group discussions. All interviews were recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed for thematic contents using the standard (Mayring, Kiger. M. E. and Braun.V) content analysis framework. RESULTS: A thematic content analysis yielded four core themes: (1) educational impact, (2) time management, (3) challenges encountered, and (4) preferences for the future. The online modality was well-received, and all participants agreed that online sessions were time saving and that their performance was improved due to enhanced utility of time; however, they indicated that they encountered some challenges, including methodological, content perception, technical, and behavioral challenges during sessions and online exams. Most of the preclinical students preferred online learning for the upcoming academic years. CONCLUSION: Synchronized online classes were well-accepted by the medical students. This represents significant and promising potential for the future of medical education. The principles of the online learning model and learning outcomes should be rigorously and regularly evaluated to monitor its effectiveness.","Khalil, Rehana; Mansour, Ali E; Fadda, Walaa A; Almisnid, Khaled; Aldamegh, Mohammed; Al-Nafeesah, Abdullah; Alkhalifah, Azzam; Al-Wutayd, Osama",BMC Med Educ,417,20

Due to social distancing measures introduced during the pandemic, face-to-face contact between staff and patients had to be minimised. This led to an increase in remote prescribing, including from home. Feedback from team doctors was that the process of following the Remote Prescribing Protocol (RPP) was taking up a significant portion of their day, preventing them from doing other clinical work.Our aim was to reduce the time taken to complete a remote prescription to pre-pandemic levels (under 15 minutes).MethodWe used PDSA methodology in this QI project: 1) Plan: Survey sent out to team duty doctors to identify the most time-consuming steps in RPP which could be safely delegated to administrative staff2) Do: Email sent requesting administrative staff clarify several details with patients/families when they request a prescription. This included the names and doses of medication, how many days they had left, where they wanted the prescription sent to (home/pharmacy) and the relevant address. If the patient usually received their repeat prescription from their GP, they were re-directed to their GP3) Study: Following the intervention above, team doctors recorded how long it took to complete a remote prescriptionResultThe average time taken to complete a prescription fell from 31 minutes (pre-intervention) to 22 minutes (post-intervention). The range of time taken also dropped from 10-241 minutes (pre-intervention) to 0-46 minutes (post-intervention). The medications taking above the average time to complete were more likely to be non-controlled drugs rather than controlled drugs (which one may typically think would be more time-consuming to write out).ConclusionWhilst we have successfully reduced the time for remote prescribing, we have not reached the target of reducing it down to less than 15 minutes (pre-pandemic timings). As part of the next PDSA cycle, we have carried out a survey to ask what barriers remain. Checking patient's notes and recent prescriptions can still be inefficient. We propose introducing an intervention whereby this can also be safety delegated to administrative staff e.g. including a copy of the most recent prescription in the request.In the future, we will continue to improve the RPP with further PDSA cycles and carry out an audit on the system on a regular basis to ensure standards are met.","Tai, Sarah Hannah Chu-Han Huang Batham Oliver Anandakumar Brindha Abbott Christopher",BJPsych Open,417,20

New, chronic stressors likely to destabilise the functioning of an individual occur. Chronic stress has been shown to play an important role in the pathogenesis of depression. Furthermore, it may destabilise the immune system, causing symptoms typical of inflammation – similar symptoms are observed in depressive patients. The COVID-19 pandemic is a powerful psychosocial stressor, and the restrictions imposed by governments of many countries further increase the level of social stress. It seems that the main pandemic-related stressors include fear of contracting the virus (including the family and friends) as well as anxiety about destabilised financial situation and socioeconomic uncertainty. Mood disorders, anxiety and sleeping problems, which are common symptoms of chronic stress, may not only be part of adaptive disorders, but also an inherent component of depressive or anxiety disorders. A number of studies confirming that stress during the epidemic significantly affects the functioning of many individuals, with sleeping disorders, generalised anxiety disorders and depression being the most common epidemic-related disorders, have emerged. It is therefore extremely important to identify individuals who belong to the group at highest risk of pathological symptoms induced by stress. The care for one’s own mental health, i.e. proper sleep hygiene, physical activity, diet and rest may play an important positive role in minimising the effects of stress on mental and somatic health of an individual.","Wierzbiński, Piotr",Psychiatr.

Due to the limited performance and context-dependence of riboswitches, only a few of them (such as theophylline, tetracycline and ciprofloxacin riboswitches) have been utilized as regulatory tools in biotechnology. In the present study, we demonstrated that a ribosome-dependent ribo-regulator, LRR, discovered in our previous work, exhibits an attractive regulatory performance. Specifically, it offers a 60-fold change in expression in the presence of retapamulin and a low level of leaky expression of about 1-2% without antibiotics. Moreover, LRR can be combined with different promoters and performs well in Bacillus thuringiensis, B. cereus, B. amyloliquefaciens, and B. subtilis. Additionally, LRR also functions in the Gram-negative bacterium Escherichia coli. Furthermore, we demonstrate its ability to control melanin metabolism in B. thuringiensis BMB171.

METHODS: This cross-sectional study included all urban and rural counties in the United States. County-level HL data were estimated using 2010 US Census and 2011 American Community Surveys data; EOL expenditures in 2010 were derived from the Dartmouth Atlas of Health Care database. Hierarchical generalized linear regressions were used to assess associations between HL and EOL care, controlling for county-level characteristics and focusing on rurality (with areas classified as urban, rural micropolitan, or rural noncore). FINDINGS: Of 3,137 US counties, 100 (3.2%) counties where 7.6 million Americans live had low HL (LHL). Counties with LHL had significantly higher average expenditures in the last 6 months of life and during terminal hospitalization than counties with high HL (HHL) (both P < .001). There was a statistically significant interaction between HL and rurality (P < .001). EOL expenditures were significantly higher in LHL counties than HHL counties in urban areas, while no such relationship appeared in rural areas. Average estimated EOL expenditures among LHL counties decreased by rurality ($16,953, $14,939, and $12,671 for urban, rural micropolitan, and rural noncore areas, respectively), while average estimated expenditures in HHL counties were around $14,000 in each of these areas. CONCLUSIONS: HL and EOL expenditures were inversely associated with urban America but unrelated to rural areas. Counties with HHL had constant expenditures regardless of rurality. Interventions targeting HL may help reduce EOL expenditures and rural-urban disparities in EOL care.","Shi, Kewei; Hung, Peiyin; Wang, Shi-Yi",J. rural health,417,24

METHODS: All patients with stage 4 pelvic organ prolapse were treated with vaginal hysterectomy, native tissue cystocele and rectocele repair and bilateral sacrospinous vaginal fixation. Anatomical and functional outcomes according to the POPq classification system and the German version of the Australian pelvic floor questionnaire were assessed. Changes between baseline, first follow-up and second follow-up were assessed by the paired Wilcoxon rank test using R, version 3.5.1. RESULTS: 20 patients were included in the study. Scores in all four domains of the pelvic floor symptom questionnaire (bladder, bowel, prolapse, sexual function) were significantly improved at 6 and 12-months follow-up. One patient presented with a symptomatic stage 3 cystocele that needed a second surgical intervention and two patients needed surgery due to a de novo stress urinary incontinence. There were no perioperative adverse events and all patients reported full satisfaction after surgery. CONCLUSIONS: The vaginal approach with hysterectomy, native tissue repair and bilateral sacrospinous vaginal fixation seems to be a safe and effective method for the treatment of advanced stage POP, offering excellent relief in all pelvic floor symptoms.

We aimed to assess the differences in inflammatory cytokines in COVID-19 patients compared to contemporaneously hospitalized controls and then analyze the relationship between these cytokines and the development of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) and mortality. In this cohort study of hospitalized patients, done between March third, 2020 and April first, 2020 at a quaternary referral center in New York City we included adult hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and negative controls. Serum specimens were obtained on the first, second, and third hospital day and cytokines were measured by Luminex. Autopsies of nine cohort patients were examined. We identified 90 COVID-19 patients and 51 controls. Analysis of 48 inflammatory cytokines revealed upregulation of macrophage induced chemokines, T-cell related interleukines and stromal cell producing cytokines in COVID-19 patients compared to the controls. Moreover, distinctive cytokine signatures predicted the development of ARDS, AKI and mortality in COVID-19 patients. Specifically, macrophage-associated cytokines predicted ARDS, T cell immunity related cytokines predicted AKI and mortality was associated with cytokines of activated immune pathways, of which IL-13 was universally correlated with ARDS, AKI and mortality. Histopathological examination of the autopsies showed diffuse alveolar damage with significant mononuclear inflammatory cell infiltration. Additionally, the kidneys demonstrated glomerular sclerosis, tubulointerstitial lymphocyte infiltration and cortical and medullary atrophy. These patterns of cytokine expression offer insight into the pathogenesis of COVID-19 disease, its severity, and subsequent lung and kidney injury suggesting more targeted treatment strategies.","Gómez-Escobar, Luis G; Hoffman, Katherine L; Choi, Justin J; Borczuk, Alain; Salvatore, Steven; Alvarez-Mulett, Sergio L; Galvan, Manuel D; Zhao, Zhen; Racine-Brzostek, Sabrina E; Yang, He S; Stout-Delgado, Heather W; Choi, Mary E; Choi, Augustine M K; Cho, Soo Jung; Schenck, Edward J",Sci Rep,417,20

For providers of aesthetic surgery procedures or minimal invasive cosmetic treatments, this led to a huge socio-economic impact worldwide. In order to evaluate valid clinical management strategies for future pandemic events and to overcome the challenges imposed by the current pandemic, it is paramount to analyse the socio-economic effects caused by the COVID-19 crisis. METHODS: An online survey comprising 18 questions was sent out five times by e-mail to all members of the International Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (ISAPS) between June and August 2020. The data set was statistically analyzed and grouped into an overall group and into subgroups of countries with high (n = 251) vs. low (n = 440) gross domestic product per capita (GDP p.c.) and five defined world regions (Europe (n = 214); North America (NA; n = 97); South America (SA; n = 206); Asia and Oceania (Asia + OC; n = 99); Africa and Middle East (Africa + ME; n = 75)). RESULTS: A total of 691 recipients completed the survey. The majority of the participants experienced severe operating restrictions resulting in a major drop of income from surgical patients. Low GDP p.c. countries experienced a bigger negative economic impact with less aesthetic (non-) surgical procedures, whereas the high GDP p.c. subgroup was less affected by the COVID-19 crisis. Most of the survey participants had already adopted the ISAPS guidelines for patient (pre-) appointment screening and clinical/patient-flow management. For surgical and non-surgical aesthetic procedures, in the high GDP p.c. subgroup more basic-level PPE (surgical mask) was used, whereas the low GDP p.c. subgroup relied more on advanced-level PPE (N-95 respirator mask or higher). Comparing the different world regions, Europe and Africa used more basic-level PPE. CONCLUSIONS: Measurable differences in the socio-economic impact and in the adaptation of safety protocols between high and low GDP p.c. subgroups and between different world regions were present. Since the COVID-19 pandemic is an international crisis, aligned, expedient and universal actions should be taken.

The pandemic has also impacted the ability of PBRNs to deploy traditional research methods such as face-to-face patient and provider interactions, practice facilitation, and stakeholder engagement. Providers need more relevant, patient-centered evidence and the skills to effect change. These skills will become more important than ever as primary care practices evolve in response to the current COVID-19 pandemic and the disparities in health outcomes highlighted by COVID-19 and the global Black Lives Matter social movement for justice.

One of these concerns revolves around the pressing question: should providers continue to work in the absence of adequate PPE? Although the first peak of the COVID-19 crisis seems to have subsided and supply of PPE has increased, concerns about insufficient PPE availability remain. Inconsistent supply, limited efficacy, and continued high demand for PPE, combined with the continued threat of a second COVID-19 wave, mean that the issues surrounding PPE availability remain unresolved, including a duty to work. This paper offers an ethical investigation of whether neurosurgeons should perform their professional responsibilities with limited availability of PPE.

The city and county of Suceava, Romania, faced an unprecedented crisis in March and April 2020, triggered not only by the highest number of infections nationwide but also by the highest number of infected health professionals (47.1% of the infected medical staff nationwide, in April 2020). Why did Suceava reach the peak number of COVID-19 cases in Romania? What were the vulnerability factors that led to the outbreak, the closure of the city of Suceava and neighboring localities, and the impossibility of managing the crisis with local resources? What is the relationship between the population's lack of confidence in the authorities' ability to solve the crisis, and their attitude towards the imposed measures? The present article aims to provide answers to the above questions by examining the attitudes of the public towards the causes that have led to the outbreak of an epidemiological crisis, systemic health problems, and the capacity of decision makers to intervene both at local and national level. The research is based on an online survey, conducted between April and May 2020, resulting in a sample of 1231 people from Suceava County. The results highlight that the development of the largest COVID-19 outbreak in Romania is, without a doubt, the result of a combination of factors, related to the medical field, decision makers, and the particularities of the population's behavior.","LucheÈ, Daniel; Saghin, Despina; Lupchian, Maria-Magdalena",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),417,16

We sought to characterize patients with deep venous thrombosis (DVT) identified after admission for COVID-19. METHODS: All adult patients admitted to Montefiore Medical Center from March 1, 2020, to April 10, 2020, and undergoing lower extremity venous duplex for DVT evaluation were included. Patients admitted with suspicion of COVID-19 were divided into severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) positive and SARS-CoV-2 negative groups based on in-hospital test results. Patients without clinical suspicion for COVID-19 were not tested. A retrospective case-control study design was used to identify potential risk factors for DVT in patients with COVID-19. Demographic, radiographic, and laboratory values were abstracted and analyzed. RESULTS: During the study period, 3404 patients with confirmed COVID-19 were admitted to the hospital. Of the 135 SARS-CoV-2 patients who underwent duplex scanning, there were 18 (13.3%) noted to have DVT compared with 72 of the 711 patients (10.1%) who were either SARS-CoV-2 negative or untested. The odds ratio for DVT in COVID-19 was 1.35 (95% confidence interval, 0.78-2.34; P = .289). Baseline characteristics for COVID-19 patients with and without DVT were overall similar. COVID-19 patients with DVT had an elevated median first d-dimer (18.88 µg/mL [interquartile range (IQR), 7.79-20.00] vs 2.55 µg/mL [IQR, 1.45-6.28]; P = .002; reference value, <0.5 µg/mL), average in-hospital d-dimer (median, 11.93 µg/mL [IQR, 8.25-16.97] vs 3.54 µg/mL [IQR, 2.05-8.53]; P < .001) and median fibrinogen level (501.0 [IQR, 440.0-629.0] vs 654.5 [IQR, 535.8-780.0]; P = .002; reference range, 187-502 mg/dL). There was a trend to significance for COVID-19 patients with DVT compared with without DVT in median d-dimer levels at the time of the duplex (13.61 µg/mL [IQR, 4.04-19.97] vs 3.58 µg/mL [IQR, 2.51-9.62]; P = .055) and median ferritin levels (1679.0 ng/mL [IQR, 1168.0-2577.0] vs 1103.0 ng/mL [IQR, 703.5-2076.5]; P = .055; reference range, 25-270 ng/mL). Twelve of the 18 patients with COVID who developed DVT did so despite chemical thromboprophylaxis, and 2 developed DVT despite therapeutic anticoagulation CONCLUSIONS: We found only a modestly increased risk of DVT in patients with COVID-19, likely underestimated owing to limitations in duplex testing early in the epidemic. Elevated d-dimer and a less elevated fibrinogen are associated with DVT in patients with COVID-19 who seem to form thrombus despite conventional chemical thromboprophylaxis. Additionally, an increasing d-dimer over time may be a reflection of the development of DVT in patients with COVID-19.","Koleilat, Issam; Galen, Benjamin; Choinski, Krystina; Hatch, Ayesha Nzeribe; Jones, Davis Brent; Billett, Henny; Indes, Jeff; Lipsitz, Evan",J.

However, which specific aspects of quality of life are most affected by VHR have not been formally investigated. METHODS: Through retrospective analysis of the Abdominal Core Health Quality Collaborative national database, we measured the change in each individual component of the HerQLes questionnaire from a pre-operative baseline assessment to one-year postoperatively in VHR patients. RESULTS: In total, 1,875 VHR patients had completed both pre- and post-operative questionnaires from 2014-2018. They were predominately Caucasian (92.3%), 57.9 ± 12.4 Y old, and evenly gender split (50.5% male, 49.5% female, P = 0.31). Most operations were performed open (80.5%) with fewer laparoscopic (7.5%) or robotic cases (12.1%). For each of the 12 individual categories, improvement in QOL from baseline to 1-Y was found to be statistically significant (P < 0.0001). This held true with subgroup analysis of small (<2 cm), medium (2-6 cm), and large (>6 cm) hernias (P < 0.0001), though a larger improvement was seen in 8 of 12 components in hernias >6 cm (P < 0.001). Operative approach did not carry a significant effect except in medium hernias (2-6 cm), where an open approach saw a greater improvement in the ""accomplish less at work"" item (P = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: VHR is associated with improvement in each of the 12 components of QOL measured in the HerQLes questionnaire, regardless of the size of their hernia. The amount of improvement, however, may be dependent on hernia size and approach.","Haisley, Kelly R; Vadlamudi, Chaitanya; Gupta, Anand; Collins, Courtney E; Renshaw, Savanah M; Poulose, Benjamin K",J Surg Res,417,16

We herein describe a 35-year-old Asian man with pulmonary tuberculosis and perforated duodenal ulcer who presented with hyponatremia with hourly fluctuating urine osmolality ranging from 100 to 600 mosmol/kg, which resembled urine osmolality observed in typical polydipsia and SIADH simultaneously. Further review revealed correlation of body temperature and urine osmolality. Since fever is a known non-osmotic stimulus of ADH secretion, we theorized that hyponatremia in this patient was due to transient ADH secretion due to fever. In our case, empiric exogenous glucocorticoid suppressed transient non-osmotic ADH secretion and urine osmolality showed highly variable concentrations. Transient ADH secretion-related hyponatremia may be underrecognized due to occasional empiric glucocorticoid administration in patients with critical illnesses. Repeatedly monitoring of urine chemistries and interpretation of urine chemistries with careful review of non-osmotic stimuli of ADH including fever is crucial in recognition of this etiology. Learning points: Hourly fluctuations in urine osmolality can be observed in patients with fever, which is a non-osmotic stimulant of ADH secretion. Repeated monitoring of urine chemistries aids in the diagnosis of the etiology underlying hyponatremia, including fever, in patients with transient ADH secretion. Glucocorticoid administration suppresses ADH secretion and improves hyponatremia even in the absence of adrenal insufficiency; the etiology of hyponatremia should be determined carefully in these patients.","Son, Raku; Nagahama, Masahiko; Tanemoto, Fumiaki; Ito, Yugo; Taki, Fumika; Tsugitomi, Ryosuke; Nakayama, Masaaki",,417,16

METHODS: This cross-sectional study was a survey-based e-learning research among dental students in the clinical study phase of a department of prosthetic dentistry at a German university hospital. A total of 44 questions were answered in four main sections: 1. general technical components; 2. acceptance; 3. evaluation and functionality; and 4. overall evaluation and grades of the various digital concepts. The use of Zoom conference, livestream, and prerecorded PowerPoint was compared to the conventional lecture setup (control group/CG). Data were analyzed using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, followed by an exploratory data analysis and Cronbach's alpha test (&#945; = 0.05). RESULTS: Students were very satisfied with the provision, quality, and benefit of the digital concepts. The asynchronous concept was significantly more satisfying than the synchronous concepts in many aspects but was less successful in interactions. In the overall evaluation and grading, the asynchronous concept was rated significantly better than the other synchronous concepts (p &#8804; 0.007), followed by Zoom conference, conventional lecture (CG), and livestream, while Zoom conference and the conventional lecture showed no significant difference (p = 0.784). CONCLUSIONS: Students significantly preferred the asynchronous concept to the synchronous concepts. The results suggested that asynchronous concepts are an effective and functional form of distance education during a pandemic. In general, digital teaching concepts are currently widely accepted for maintaining university education.","Goob, Janosch; Erdelt, Kurt; Güth, Jan-Frederik; Liebermann, Anja",J. dent. educ,417,16

METHODS: This was a prospective study carried out during the first pandemic wave in the intensive care units (ICUs) of two referral University Hospitals in Lombardy, Italy. Two hundred twenty-two consecutive mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients were evaluated during the ICU stay. In addition to major demographic and clinical data, we recorded information on the route and amount of nutritional support provided on a daily basis. RESULTS: Among patients still in the ICUs and alive on day 4 (N = 198), 129 (65.2%) and 72 (36.4%) reached a satisfactory caloric and protein intake, respectively, mainly by enteral route. In multivariable analysis, a satisfactory caloric intake on day 4 was associated with lower mortality (HR = 0.46 [95%CI, 0.42-0.50], P < 0.001). Mild obesity (body mass index [BMI] &#8805;30 and < 35 kg/m2) was associated with higher mortality (HR = 1.99 [95%CI, 1.07-3.68], P = 0.029), while patients with moderate-severe obesity (BMI&#8805;35 kg/m2) were less likely to be weaned from invasive mechanical ventilation (HR = 0.71 [95%CI, 0.62-0.82], P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: This study confirmed the negative prognostic and clinical role of obesity in mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients and suggested that early caloric deficit may independently contribute to worsen survival in this patients' population. Therefore, any effort should be made to implement an adequate timely nutritional support in all COVID-19 patients during the ICU stay.","Cereda, Emanuele; Guzzardella, Amedeo; Klersy, Catherine; Belliato, Mirko; Pellegrini, Andrea; Sciutti, Fabio; Mongodi, Silvia; Masi, Sara; Crotti, Silvia; Savioli, Monica; Zanella, Alberto; Mojoli, Francesco; Grasselli, Giacomo; Caccialanza, Riccardo",Clin. nutr.

METHODS: Children under 2 years admitted with fever and/or respiratory symptoms were enrolled from 2010 to 2013 in Amman, Jordan. Nasal/throat swabs were collected and stored for testing. Demographic and clinical characteristics were collected through parent/guardian interviews and medical chart abstractions. Prior stored specimens were tested for HCoVs (HKU1, OC43, 229E and NL63) by qRT-PCR. RESULTS: Of the 3168 children enrolled, 6.7% were HCoVs-positive. Among HCoV-positive children, the median age was 3.8 (1.9-8.4) months, 59% were male, 14% were premature, 11% had underlying medical conditions and 76% had viral-codetection. The most common presenting symptoms were cough, fever, wheezing and shortness of breath. HCoVs were detected year-round, peaking in winter-spring months. Overall, 56%, 22%, 13% and 6% were OC43, NL63, HKU1 and 229E, respectively. There was no difference in disease severity between the species, except higher intensive care unit admission frequency in NL63-positive subjects.

METHOD: One hundred twenty-two participants were included in Group 1 and 250 in Group 2. The families' sociodemographic characteristics (education levels and occupations of mothers and fathers, parental shift-working status, monthly family income, number of children in the family, and place of residence), general information for the children taking part (diagnosis of COVID-19 or COVID-19 related isolation, distance education, participation in sporting activities, time spent watching TV, time devoted to reading, time spent on telephones/tablets/computers, and time spent on indoor activities), and the responses given to the Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaire (CSQH)-abbreviated form were all examined.

The UK lockdown was maintained for 7 weeks, but the effectiveness of the control measures in suppressing disease transmission remains incompletely understood. METHODS: A Bayesian SEIR (susceptible-exposed-infected-removed) epidemiological model was used to rebuild the local transmission dynamics of the spread of COVID-19 in nine regions of England. RESULTS: The basic reproduction number (R0) in England was found to be relatively high compared with China. The estimate of the temporally varying effective reproduction number (Rt) suggests that the control measures, especially the forced lockdown, were effective to reduce transmissibility and curb the COVID-19 epidemic. Although the overall incidence rate in the UK has declined, forecasting highlights the possibility of a second epidemic wave in several regions.

In order to assist difficult triage decisions, clinicians require clear guidelines on how to prioritise patients. Existing guidelines show significant variability in their development, interpretation, implementation and an urgent need for a robust synthesis of published guidance. To understand how to manage which patients are admitted to ICU, and receive mechanical ventilatory support, during periods of high demand during the COVID-19 pandemic, a systematic review was performed. Databases of indexed literature (Medline, Embase, Web of Science, and Global Health) and grey literature (Google.com and MedRxiv), published from 1 January until 2 April 2020, were searched. Search terms included synonyms of COVID-19, ICU, ventilation, and triage. Only formal written guidelines were included. There were no exclusion criteria based on geographical location or publication language. Quality appraisal of the guidelines was performed using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation Instrument II (AGREE II) and the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation Instrument Recommendation EXcellence (AGREE REX) appraisal tools, and key themes related to triage were extracted using narrative synthesis. Of 1902 unique records identified, nine relevant guidelines were included. Six guidelines were national or transnational level guidance (UK, Switzerland, Belgium, Australia and New Zealand, Italy, and Sri Lanka), with one state level (Kansas, USA), one international (Extracorporeal Life Support Organization) and one specific to military hospitals (Department of Defense, USA). The guidelines covered several broad themes: use of ethical frameworks, criteria for ICU admission and discharge, adaptation of criteria as demand changes, equality across health conditions and healthcare systems, decision-making processes, communication of decisions, and guideline development processes. We have synthesised the current guidelines and identified the different approaches taken globally to manage the triage of intensive care resources during the COVID-19 pandemic. There is limited consensus on how to allocate the finite resource of ICU beds and ventilators, and a lack of high-quality evidence and guidelines on resource allocation during the pandemic.

Health care authorities have already initiated awareness and preparedness activities worldwide. A poor understanding of the disease among health care workers (HCWs) may result in delayed treatment and result in the rapid spread of the infection. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the knowledge and perceptions of HCWs about COVID-19. METHODS: A cross-sectional, web-based study was conducted among HCWs about COVID-19 during the first week of March 2020. A 23-item survey instrument was developed and distributed randomly to HCWs using social media; it required 5 minutes to complete. A chi-square test was used to investigate the level of association among variables, with significance set to P<.05. RESULTS: Of 529 participants, a total of 453 HCWs completed the survey (response rate: 85.6%); 51.6% (n=234) were male, 32.1% (n=147) were aged 25-34 years, and most were doctors (n=137, 30.2%) and medical students (n=134, 29.6%). Most participants (n=276, 61.0%) used social media to obtain information on COVID-19. A significant proportion of HCWs had poor knowledge of its transmission (n=276, 61.0%) and symptom onset (n=288, 63.6%) and showed positive perceptions of COVID-19. Factors such as age and profession were associated with inadequate knowledge and a poor perception of COVID-19.

Internalising and externalising behaviour problems are viewed as expressions of avoidance behaviour. Furthermore, we discuss important implications for treatment.<br/> CONCLUSION: Applying an aetiological model for therapy refractory internalising behaviour may help to increase efficacy of treatment. Thus, transdiagnostic treatment can be offered, being less dependent on specific dsm-classifications. Focus of treatment is on restoration of basic trust between the youngster and his parents, and on ending avoidance behaviour that is based on social anxiety.","Herpers, P C M; Neumann, J E C; Staal, W G",Tijdschr Psychiatr,417,1

To investigate the potential intermediate host of the SARS-CoV-2, we analyzed spike glycoprotein sequences from different animals, with particular emphasis on bats. We performed phylogenetic analysis and structural reconstruction of the spike glycoproteins with subsequent alignment and comparison. Our phylogenetic results revealed that SARS-CoV-2 was more similar to the bats' betacoronavirus isolates: HKU5-related from Pipistrellus abramus and HKU4-related from Tylonycteris pachypus. We also identified a yak betacoronavirus strain, YAK/HY24/CH/2017, as the closest match in the comparison of the structural models of spike glycoproteins. Interestingly, a set of unique features has been described for this particular strain of the yak betacoronavirus. Therefore, our results suggest that the human SARS-CoV-2, responsible for the current outbreak of COVID-19, could also come from yak as an intermediate host.","Dabravolski, Siarhei Alexander; Kavalionak, Yury Kazimirovich",J. med. virol,417,20

The economic importance of beach tourism for many destinations has led many governments to reopen tourist beaches, as soon as the number of infection cases decreased. The objective of this paper is to provide a scientific basis for understanding the key issues for beach tourism management in these circumstances. These issues include risk perception, environmental considerations directly related to beaches and COVID-19, and management strategies designed to limit the risk of contagion on the beach. The contribution of this paper lies in its interdisciplinary approach to delivering the findings from the latest studies, highly relevant for beach tourism, in psychology, health science, and environmental science (often in preprint and in press format). Particular attention was given to identifying the knowledge gaps evident in the areas of COVID-19 risk perception, with the drivers explaining the risk-taking behavior and the protective strategies employed by beachgoers. Gaps were also found in areas such as the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in bathing waters and the sand, the potential of contaminated sand being a viable route of transmission, and the impact of the use of chemical disinfectants on the marine environment and on bathers. The paper identifies research prospects in these areas, additionally pointing out other questions such as new carrying capacity methods, the opportunity given by COVID-19 in estimation of the impacts of visitation and beach-litter.","Zielinski, Seweryn; Botero, Camilo M",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),417,16

Twenty-four male Wistar rats (250 g) were kept in identical housing units on a 12-hour light/12 hour dark cycle. The LED 10 group was exposed to LED at 638 nm (10 J/cm² for 3 minutes). Seventy percent partial hepatectomy was performed in the LED 10 and HPC (Partial Hepatectomy-Control). A sham-operated group (C) was used for control. Twenty four hours after the procedure, LED 10, HPC and control animals were sacrificed. Samples of liver tissue were used for the mitochondrial respiration assay. Statistical comparisons of the groups were performed by analysis of variance (ANOVA), followed by the Bonferroni post-test. Probability values less than 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant. the phosphorylation index (FI) for the LED 10 group was higher than that for the HPC group and for the sham group (p 005).

This sudden halt in human outdoor activities brought positive and negative impacts on forests and wildlife. We undertook a study to learn the impact of the COVID‐19 lockdown on wildlife and forests in the protected areas (PAs) of Nepal. Between July and September 2020, data on illegal activities recorded by the staff of PAs and also those reported by media were collected and analyzed. Key informant interviews (KII) were done with the park officers and security personnel by virtual communication (telephone, messenger app, and video call) to collect detailed information and for corroboration. The collected data were categorized into four groups: (a) wildlife killed, (b) wildlife injured, (c) arrest incidents related to forest crime, and (d) arrest incidents related to wildlife crime. Data from the fiscal year 2019–2020 were analyzed, comparing before lockdown and after. Among 20 PAs investigated during the lockdown, the study found substantial increases in wildlife death in two PAs, Banke National Park, and Bardia National Park. Similarly, Chitwan National Park (CNP) and Shivapuri Nagarjun National Park (SNNP) witnessed a rise in wildlife poaching. CNP and SNNP are located close to densely populated cities and also have human settlements in their peripheries. Wildlife was sighted freely roaming inside PAs during the lockdown, presumably because the absence of visitors and human activities during the lockdown decreased disturbance. Thus, the wildlife was enjoying the freedom of movement on the one hand, and on the other hand was threatened by poachers, many of whom were laid off from other activities and were taking advantage of the lapse in security.

This is the first report of Italian Society for Cardiac Surgery (SICCH) on preliminary experience with COVID-19 patients receiving ECMO support. Data from 12 Italian hospitals participating in SICCH were retrospectively analyzed. Between March 1st and September 15th, 2020, a veno-venous (VV) ECMO system was installed in 67 patients (94%) and a veno-arterio-venous (VAV) ECMO in four (6%). Five patients required VA ECMO after initial weaning from VV ECMO. Thirty (42.2%) patients were weaned from ECMO, while 39 (54.9%) died on ECMO, and six (8.5%) died after ECMO removal. Overall hospital survival was 36.6% (n=26). Main causes of death were multiple organ failure (n=14, 31.1%) and sepsis (n=11, 24.4%). On multivariable analysis, predictors of death while on ECMO support were older age (p=0.048), elevated pre-ECMO C-reactive protein level (p=0.048), higher positive end-expiratory pressure on ventilator (p=0.036) and lower lung compliance (p=0.032). If the conservative treatment is not effective, ECMO support might be considered as life-saving rescue therapy for COVID-19 refractory respiratory failure. However warm caution and thoughtful approaches for timely detection and treatment should be taken for such a delicate patients population.","Loforte, Antonio; Di Mauro, Michele; Pellegrini, Carlo; Monterosso, Christian; Pelenghi, Stefano; Degani, Antonella; Rinaldi, Mauro; Cura Stura, Erik; Sales, Gabriele; Montrucchio, Giorgia; Mangino, Domenico; Terrini, Alberto; Pacini, Davide; Affronti, Alessandro; Tarzia, Vincenzo; Bottio, Tomaso; Pantaleo, Antonio; Donatelli, Francesco; Miceli, Antonio; Santini, Francesco; Salsano, Antonio; Colli, Andrea; Ravenni, Giacomo; Montalto, Andrea; Musumeci, Francesco; Salvador, Loris; Gerosa, Gino; Parolari, Alessandro; Picichè, Marco",ASAIO. j,417,20

However, heterogeneity in SARS-CoV-2 testing may introduce biased estimates depending on analytic design. We aimed to explore the potential for collider bias in a large study of disease determinants, and evaluate individual, environmental and social determinants associated with SARS-CoV-2 testing and diagnosis among residents of Ontario, Canada. METHODS: We explored the potential for collider bias and characterized individual, environmental and social determinants of being tested and testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection using cross-sectional analyses among 14.7 million community-dwelling people in Ontario, Canada. Among those with a diagnosis, we used separate analytic designs to compare predictors of people testing positive versus negative; symptomatic people testing positive versus testing negative; and people testing positive versus people not testing positive (i.e., testing negative or not being tested). Our analyses included tests conducted between Mar. 1 and June 20, 2020. RESULTS: Of 14 695 579 people, we found that 758 691 were tested for SARS-CoV-2, of whom 25 030 (3.3%) had a positive test result. The further the odds of testing from the null, the more variability we generally observed in the odds of diagnosis across analytic design, particularly among individual factors. We found that there was less variability in testing by social determinants across analytic designs. Residing in areas with the highest household density (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1.86, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.75-1.98), highest proportion of essential workers (adjusted OR 1.58, 95% CI 1.48-1.69), lowest educational attainment (adjusted OR 1.33, 95% CI 1.26-1.41) and highest proportion of recent immigrants (adjusted OR 1.10, 95% CI 1.05-1.15) were consistently related to increased odds of SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis regardless of analytic design. INTERPRETATION: Where testing is limited, our results suggest that risk factors may be better estimated using population comparators rather than test-negative comparators. Optimizing COVID-19 responses necessitates investment in and sufficient coverage of structural interventions tailored to heterogeneity in social determinants of risk, including household crowding, occupation and structural racism.","Sundaram, Maria E; Calzavara, Andrew; Mishra, Sharmistha; Kustra, Rafal; Chan, Adrienne K; Hamilton, Mackenzie A; Djebli, Mohamed; Rosella, Laura C; Watson, Tristan; Chen, Hong; Chen, Branson; Baral, Stefan D; Kwong, Jeffrey C",CMAJ,417,15

There were 528 patients admitted with non-COVID illness in 2020, versus 924 in 2017 (a reduction of 43%). Deaths from non-COVID causes increased by 10.9% compared with 2017, over half this rise being from neurological causes including stroke and dementia. While far fewer patients required hospitalisation as medical emergencies, rises in local non-COVID deaths proved small. Wales-wide non-COVID deaths rose by just 1% compared with 2019.

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Patients diagnosed with muscle-invasive bladder cancer (cT2-4a,N0/X,M0/X) without nodal or distant metastases between 2008 and 2016 were identified through the Netherlands Cancer Registry. Multilevel logistic regression analysis was used to investigate the hospital specific probability of undergoing a cystectomy. Cox proportional hazard regression analysis was used to assess the case-mix adjusted effect of hospital-specific probabilities on survival. RESULTS: Of the 9,215 included patients, 4,513 (49%) underwent a RC. The percentage of RCs varied between 7% and 83% by hospital of diagnosis before the introduction of the first volume criteria (i.e., 2008-2009; minimum of 10 RCs). This variation decreased slightly to 17%-77% after establishment of the second volume criteria (i.e., 2015-2016; minimum of 20 RCs). Age, cT-stage and comorbidity were inversely and socioeconomic status was positively associated with RC. Both being diagnosed in a community hospital and/or being diagnosed in a hospital fulfilling the RC volume criteria were associated with increased use of RC compared to academic hospitals and hospitals not fulfilling the volume criteria. For each 10% increase in the percentage of RC in the hospital of diagnosis, 2-year case-mix adjusted survival increased 4% (hazard ratio 0.96, 95% confidence interval 0.94-0.98). CONCLUSION: Probability of RC varied between hospitals of diagnosis and affected 2-year overall survival. Undergoing a RC was associated with age, cT-stage, socioeconomic status, type of hospital, and whether the hospital of diagnosis fulfilled the RC volume criteria. Future research is needed to identify patient, tumor, and hospital characteristics affecting utilization of curative treatment as this may benefit overall survival.","Ripping, Theodora M; Witjes, J Alfred; Meijer, Richard P; van Rhijn, Bas W G; Oddens, Jorg R; Goossens-Laan, Catharina A; Mulder, Sasja F; van Moorselaar, Reindert J A; Kiemeney, Lambertus A; Aben, Katja K H",Urol. oncol,417,16

Analyses controlled for age, sex, race, marital status, education level, working status, household income, and COVID-19 exposure. Results were consistent with prediction. First, higher ASI-3 Total scores were associated with above average COVID-19 fear (ß = 0.19). Second, the ASI-3 physical concerns subscale was the strongest predictor of COVID-19 fear; one SD increase on the ASI-3 physical concerns subscale was associated with almost a twofold risk of reaching above average levels of COVID-19 (OR = 1.93). Third, higher ASI-3 Total scores were associated with higher anxiety (ß = 0.22) and depression (ß = 0.20). Finally, COVID-19 fear mediated the relationship between ASI-3 Total scores and anxiety (17% of effect mediated) as well as ASI-3 Total scores and depression (16% of effect mediated).

Unless urgent measures are taken, there is a risk that dengue and COVID-19 could overwhelm healthcare systems across multiple countries.","Ridwan, Raiiq",Trop Doct,417,5

However, relatively little is known about the characteristics of oral cavity involvement. This is surprising, considering that oral mucosal and salivary gland cells are known targets for the direct replication of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and that the presence of the virus in saliva is a source of transmission of the infection. The aim of our study was to investigate the presence and prevalence of oral manifestations in COVID-19 survivors. We profiled the oral involvement in 122 COVID-19 survivors that were hospitalized and followed up at a single-referral university hospital in Milan, Italy, between July 23, 2020 and September 7, 2020, after a median (interquartile range) time from hospital discharge of 104 (95 to 132) d. We found that oral manifestations, specifically salivary gland ectasia, were unexpectedly common, with oral manifestations being detected in 83.9% while salivary gland ectasia in 43% of COVID-19 survivors. Salivary gland ectasia reflected the hyperinflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2, as demonstrated by the significant relationship with C-reactive protein (CRP) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels at hospital admission, and with the use of antibiotics during acute disease. Both LDH levels and antibiotic administration survived as independent predictors of salivary gland ectasia at multivariable analysis. Temporomandibular joint abnormalities, facial pain, and masticatory muscle weakness were also common. Overall, this retrospective and prospective cohort study of COVID-19 survivors revealed that residual damage of the oral cavity persists in the vast majority of patients far beyond clinical recovery, and suggests that the oral cavity represents a preferential target for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Further studies are needed to clarify the connection between SARS-CoV-2 infection and oral disorders.","Gherlone, E F; Polizzi, E; Tetè, G; De Lorenzo, R; Magnaghi, C; Rovere Querini, P; Ciceri, F",J Dent Res,417,26

In this review, we discuss the role of host factors in SARS-CoV-2 infection and describe variations in host factor expression as mechanisms underlying the symptoms and severity of COVID-19. We focus on two host factors, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2), implicated in SARS-CoV-2 infection. We also discuss genetic variants associated with COVID-19 severity revealed in selected patients and based on genome-wide association studies (GWASs). Furthermore, we highlight important advances in cell and chromatin biology, such as single-cell RNA and chromatin sequencing and chromosomal conformation assays, as methods that may aid in the discovery of viral-host interactions in COVID-19.

RESULTS: Of the 332 COVID-19 patients, 306 and 26 were included in the non-critical and critical groups, respectively. The median time from onset to admission was 4.0 (2.0-8.0) days. Of the 332 COVID-19 patients, 98 (29.5%) were admitted with liver injury. The rates of aspartate transaminase, Î³-glutamyl transpeptidase, and total bilirubin abnormalities were higher in the critical group than in the non-critical group. The patient's sex, COVID-19 severity, and a low liver CT density strongly correlated with liver injury (ORs: 2.936, 6.543, and 3.387, respectively). Statistical analysis on drug administration after admission showed that the usage rates of lopinavir/ritonavir, glucocorticoids, and thymopeptides were significantly higher in the abnormal group than the normal groups (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Though not severe, the liver injury among COVID-19 patients was pervasive. Being male, COVID-19 severity, low CT density, and medications may be risk factors for liver damage. Following recovery, liver function gradually returns to normal. METHODS: This retrospective study screened 332 confirmed COVID-19 patients from January 20 to March 13, 2020. Liver indicators were evaluated on admission. The risk factors, medications, and the dynamic change of liver functions were analyzed.","Guo, Hongying; Zhang, Zhengguo; Zhang, Yuyi; Liu, Yu; Wang, Jiefei; Qian, Zhiping; Zou, Ying; Lu, Hongzhou",Aging (Albany NY),417,2

Furthermore, criteria for the selection of patients that benefit most from this highly invasive and resource-demanding therapy are yet to be defined. In this study, we assess survival in an international multicenter cohort of COVID-19 patients treated with V-V ECMO and evaluate the performance of several clinical scores to predict 30-day survival. METHODS: This is an investigator-initiated retrospective non-interventional international multicenter registry study (NCT04405973, first registered 28 May 2020). In 127 patients treated with V-V ECMO at 15 centers in Germany, Switzerland, Italy, Belgium, and the United States, we calculated the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) Score, Simplified Acute Physiology Score II (SAPS II), Acute Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) Score, Respiratory Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation Survival Prediction (RESP) Score, Predicting Death for Severe ARDS on V­V ECMO (PRESERVE) Score, and 30-day survival. RESULTS: In our study cohort which enrolled 127 patients, overall 30-day survival was 54%. Median SOFA, SAPS II, APACHE II, RESP, and PRESERVE were 9, 36, 17, 1, and 4, respectively. The prognostic accuracy for all these scores (area under the receiver operating characteristic-AUROC) ranged between 0.548 and 0.605. CONCLUSIONS: The use of scores for the prediction of mortality cannot be recommended for treatment decisions in severe COVID-19 ARDS undergoing V-V ECMO; nevertheless, scoring results below or above a specific cut-off value may be considered as an additional tool in the evaluation of prognosis.

Accordingly, universal testing has been suggested as a potential strategy for reducing transmission in the obstetrical setting. We describe the clinical characteristics of patients who tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) during pregnancy at a designated COVID-19 hospitalization centre in Montréal, Québec. METHODS: A single-centre retrospective cohort was constructed to include all pregnant patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 between March 22 and July 31, 2020, and received care at the Jewish General Hospital. Initially, testing was restricted to at-risk patients, identified through the use of a screening questionnaire. Beginning on May 15, 2020, universal testing was implemented, and all pregnant patients admitted to the hospital were tested. Data were collected through chart review. RESULTS: Of 803 patients tested for SARS-CoV-2 during the study period, 41 (5%) tested positive. Among those patients who were symptomatic, the most commonly reported symptoms were cough (53%), fever (37%), dyspnea (30%), and anosmia and/or ageusia (20%). Before the implementation of universal testing, 13% (three of 24) of patients with SARS-CoV-2 were asymptomatic. After implementation of universal testing, 80% (eight of 10) of patients with SARS-CoV-2 were asymptomatic. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that most pregnant patients with SARS-CoV-2 are asymptomatic or have mild symptoms of COVID-19. Particularly in endemic areas, universal testing of pregnant patients presenting to the hospital should be strongly considered as an important measure to prevent in-hospital and community transmission of COVID-19.","Trahan, Marie-Julie; Mitric, Cristina; Malhamé, Isabelle; Abenhaim, Haim A",J. obstet. gynaecol.

All companions are required to register their real personal data with 14 days of travel history, occupation, contact history, and cluster history. We would like to evaluate the impact of the new regulations to the accompanying and visiting culture in Taiwan, via analyzing the appearance and characteristics of inpatient companions in this period. METHODS: Using intelligent technology, we designed a novel system in managing the inpatient companions (InPatients Companions Management System [IPCMS]), and the IPCMS was used to collect data about characteristics of inpatients and companions between April 27 and May 3, 2020. The database is built using MySQL software. Microsoft Excel 2016 and SPSS version 20.0 statistical software were used for data analysis, including the basic data of the companions, differential analysis of companions' gender, person-days and cumulative time, differential analysis of accompaniment-patient relationship, and frequency of accompaniment and cumulative hours. RESULTS: During study period, daily inpatient admissions ranged from 2242 to 2514, the number of companions per day ranged from 2048 to 2293, and the number of companions for one inpatient is 1 to 9 per day, with an average of 1.20 to 1.26. The companions were mostly family members, and most of them were the inpatients' children (32.9%), and spouse (26.13%). More females than males were noted in all categories of companionship with statistical significance. CONCLUSION: The data obtained in this study could be an important basis for the transformation and reform of the companions culture in Taiwan's hospitals and will also provide a glimpse into the attitudes and culture of companions who have long been ignorant and neglected.

However, the conditions faced by specific populations vary according to social, structural and environmental factors, including stigma and discrimination, criminalization, social and economic safety nets and the local epidemiology of HIV and COVID-19, which determine risk of exposure and vulnerability to adverse health outcomes, as well as the ability to comply with measures such as physical distancing. This commentary identifies common vulnerabilities and cross-cutting themes in terms of the impacts of COVID-19 on key populations before addressing issues and concerns specific to particular populations. DISCUSSION: Cross-cutting themes include direct impacts such as disrupted access to essential medicines, commodities and services such as anti-retroviral treatment, HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis, opioid agonist treatment, viral load monitoring, HIV and sexually transmitted infections testing, condoms and syringes. Indirect impacts include significant collateral damage arising from prevention measures which restrict human rights, increase or impose criminal penalties, and expand police powers to target vulnerable and criminalized populations. Significant heterogeneity in the COVID-19 pandemic, the underlying HIV epidemic and the ability of key populations to protect themselves means that people who inject drugs and sex workers face particular challenges, including indirect impacts as a result of police targeting, loss of income and sometimes both. Geographical variations mean that transgender people and men who have sex with men in regions like Africa and the middle east remain criminalized, as well as stigmatized and discriminated against, increasing their vulnerability to adverse outcomes in relation to COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Disruptions to both licit and illicit supply chains, loss of income and livelihoods and changes in behaviour as a result of lockdowns and physical distancing have the potential to exacerbate the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on key populations. While these impacts will vary significantly, human-rights approaches to COVID-19 emergency laws and public health prevention measures that are population-specific and sensitive, will be key to reducing adverse health outcomes and ensuring that no one is left behind.","Iversen, Jenny; Sabin, Keith; Chang, Judy; Morgan Thomas, Ruth; Prestage, Garrett; Strathdee, Steffanie A; Maher, Lisa",J Int AIDS Soc,417,16

This is human nature. This is true also for chemists in the synthesis of organic molecules. All chemists would like to make their target molecules as soon as possible, particularly when their interest is in the physical or biological properties of those molecules.As demonstrated by today's COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, rapid synthesis is also crucial to enable chemists to deliver effective therapeutic agents to the community. Several concepts are currently well-accepted as important for achieving this: atom economy, step economy, and redox economy. Considering the importance of synthesizing organic molecules rapidly, I recently proposed adding the concept of time economy.In a multisep synthesis, each step has to be completed within a short period of time to make the desired molecule rapidly. The development of rapid reactions is important but also insufficient. After each step, frequent and repetitive workup operations such as quenching the reaction, extraction, separation of water and organic phases, drying the organic phase, filtration, evaporation, and purification may be required, and the time necessary for these processing operations must be taken into account. Indeed, some of the most time-consuming operations in most syntheses are the purification stages.On the other hand, one-pot reactions are processes in which several sequential reactions are conducted in a single reaction vessel, which avoids the need to purify intermediates. One-pot reactions are a useful way to shorten the total synthesis time, and the approach generally leads to an increase in the yield and a reduction in the amount of chemical waste formed. Thus, I also propose the importance of pot economy.On the basis of these concepts of time and pot economy, we have accomplished efficient syntheses of several natural products and medicines. The key to the success of these syntheses is the use of diphenylprolinol silyl ether as an effective catalyst in a one-pot reaction, in which it does not disturb the subsequent reactions. Our strategy is (1) to construct the chiral key skeletons and/or key components of natural products and medicines directly using organocatalyst-mediated one-pot reactions and (2) to conduct the subsequent transformations to the final molecules in a small number of pots utilizing the internal quench method. By means of this strategy, PGE1 methyl ester, estradiol methyl ether, and clinprost were synthesized in three, five, and seven pots, respectively. Furthermore, (-)-oseltamivir, ABT-341, baclofen, and Corey lactone were synthesized in a single reaction vessel. Further optimization of the reactions in terms of time economy allowed (-)-oseltamivir and Corey lactone to be synthesized within 60 and 152 min, respectively. These syntheses will be highlighted as case studies. Although the organocatalyst is a key compound in this Account, pot- and time-economical syntheses can be expanded to organometallic chemistry and, indeed, to organic chemistry in general.","Hayashi, Yujiro",Acc Chem Res,417,16

Similar to the previously deposited structures of SARS-CoV-1 nsp7 at acidic and basic conditions, SARS-CoV-2 nsp7 has a helical bundle folding at neutral pH. Remarkably, the 4 helix shows gradual dislocation from the core 2-3 structure as pH increases from 6.5 to 7.5.

Our aim was to investigate the yield of neuroimaging in patients with COVID-19 undergoing CT or MR imaging of the brain and to describe associated imaging findings. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study involving 2054 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 presenting to 2 hospitals in New York City between March 4 and May 9, 2020, of whom 278 (14%) underwent either CT or MR imaging of the brain. All images initially received a formal interpretation from a neuroradiologist within the institution and were subsequently reviewed by 2 neuroradiologists in consensus, with disputes resolved by a third neuroradiologist. RESULTS: The median age of these patients was 64 years (interquartile range, 50-75 years), and 43% were women. Among imaged patients, 58 (21%) demonstrated acute or subacute neuroimaging findings, the most common including cerebral infarctions (11%), parenchymal hematomas (3.6%), and posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (1.1%). Among the 51 patients with MR imaging examinations, 26 (51%) demonstrated acute or subacute findings; notable findings included 6 cases of cranial nerve abnormalities (including 4 patients with olfactory bulb abnormalities) and 3 patients with a microhemorrhage pattern compatible with critical illness-associated microbleeds. CONCLUSIONS: Our experience confirms the wide range of neurologic imaging findings in patients with COVID-19 and suggests the need for further studies to optimize management for these patients.","Lin, E; Lantos, J E; Strauss, S B; Phillips, C D; Campion, T R; Navi, B B; Parikh, N S; Merkler, A E; Mir, S; Zhang, C; Kamel, H; Cusick, M; Goyal, P; Gupta, A",AJNR Am J Neuroradiol,417,14

The objective of this study is to analyze whether the use of tocilizumab is associated with respiratory improvement and a shorter time to discharge in patients with COVID-19 and lung involvement. Methods: Observational study on a cohort of 418 patients, admitted to three county hospitals in Catalonia (Spain). Patients admitted consecutively were included and followed until discharge or up to 30â¯days of admission. A sub-cohort of patients treated with tocilizumab and a sub-cohort of control patients were identified, matched by a large number of risk factors and clinical variables. Sub-cohorts were also matched by the number of other treatments for COVID-19 that patients received. Increment in SAFI (inspired oxygen fraction / saturation) 48â¯h after the start of treatment, and time to discharge, were the primary outcomes. Mortality, which was a secondary outcome, was analyzed in the total cohort, by using logistic regression models, adjusted by confounders. Results: There were 96 patients treated with tocilizumab. Of them, 22 patients could be matched with an equivalent number of control patients. The increment in SAFI from baseline to 48â¯h of treatment, was not significantly different between groups (tocilizumab: -0.04; control: 0.09; pâ¯=â¯0.636). Also, no difference in time to discharge was found between the two sub-cohorts (logrank test: pâ¯=â¯0.472). The logistic regression models, did not show an effect of tocilizumab on mortality (OR 0.99; pâ¯=â¯0.990). Conclusions: We did not find a clinical benefit associated with the use tocilizumab, in terms of respiratory function at 48â¯h of treatment, or time to discharge.","Rodríguez-Molinero, Alejandro; Pérez-López, Carlos; Gálvez-Barrón, César; Miñarro, Antonio; Macho, Oscar; López, Gabriela F; Robles, Maria Teresa; Dapena, Maria Dolores; Martínez, Sergi; Gullello, Ezequiel Rodríguez; Pérez, Isabel Collado",One Health,417,1

MethodsThis study is a retrospective case-series of patients presenting to a single ED with acute symptomatic COVID-19 from March 7-August 9, 2020. Symptomatic patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were eligible for this study. Patients who tested positive for COVID-19 due to screening tests but had no reasonably associated symptoms were excluded. Participants were analyzed by three categories representative of clinical severity: intensive care unit (ICU) care/death, general ward admission, and ED discharge/convalescence at home. Outcomes were ascertained 30 days after initial presentation to account for escalation in severity after the ED visit. We conducted univariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses to report odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) between hospital or ICU care/death versus convalescence at home and between ICU care/death versus general ward admission. ResultsIn total, 994 patients were included in the study, of which, 551 (55.4%) patients convalesced at home, 314 (31.6%) patients required general ward admission, and 129 (13.0%) required ICU care or died. In the multivariable models, ED patients requiring hospital admission were more likely to be aged [≥] 65 years (adjusted OR [aOR] 7.4, 95% CI: 5.0, 10.8), Black/African American (aOR 3.0, 95% CI: 1.6, 5.8) or Asian/American Indian/Alaska Native/Other (aOR 2.2, 95% CI: 1.1, 4.3), and experience dyspnea (aOR 2.7, 95% CI: 2.0, 3.7) or diarrhea (aOR 1.6, 95% CI: 1.1, 2.2). However, they were less likely to experience sore throat (aOR 0.4, 95% CI: 0.2, 0.6), myalgia (aOR 0.5, 95% CI: 0.4, 0.7), headache (aOR 0.5, 95% CI: 0.4, 0.8), or olfactory/taste disturbance (aOR 0.5, 95% CI: 0.3, 0.8).

Methods: Women undergoing mastectomy only and mastectomy with immediate breast reconstruction (IBR) with tissue expander or permanent implant from the 2007-2013 ACS-NSQIP datasets were included. Multivariate analysis of independent variables was used to form propensity-matched cohorts. Incidence of 30-day major postoperative bleeding and hospital length of stay were compared. Results: In total, 13,580 mastectomy only patients and 11,636 IBR patients were identified. Factors that were found to be associated with IBR included age (P = 0.022), BMI (P &lt; 0.001), race (P = 0.010), diabetes (P = 0.007), chronic steroid use (P = 0.003), pulmonary disease (P = 0.004), cardiovascular disease (P &lt; 0.001), disseminated cancer (P = 0.001), chemotherapy before surgery (P = 0.016), low hematocrit (P &lt; 0.001), and total operative time (P &lt; 0.001). After propensity matching, immediate device reconstruction following mastectomy was not found to be associated with greater risk of postoperative bleeding (1.4% versus 1.0%, P = 0.334) or increased length of stay (1.5 +/- 2.9 versus 1.5 +/- 3.5 days, P = 0.576). Conclusions: Immediate device reconstruction does not elevate morbidity in terms of postoperative bleeding or does not increase the length of hospital exposure. Tissue expander or implant reconstruction can be safely performed immediately following mastectomy during the COVID-19 pandemic. Further, our institutional experience during the pandemic indicates that select patients can continue to safely undergo ambulatory mastectomy with device placement.","Huang, H.; Fu, R.

Ontological insecurity and the long-term impact of COVID-19 in the academy,17.465359,3.305301,2020,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 presented great challenges for not only those in the field of health care but also those undergoing medical training. The burden on health care services worldwide has limited the educational opportunities available for medical students due to social distancing requirements. OBJECTIVE: In this paper, we describe a strategy that combines telehealth and medical training to mitigate the adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A toll-free telescreening service, Telecoronavirus, began operations in March 2020. This service was operated remotely by supervised medical students and was offered across all 417 municipalities (14.8 million inhabitants) in the Brazilian state of Bahia. Students recorded clinical and sociodemographic data by using a web-based application that was simultaneously accessed by medical volunteers for supervision purposes, as well as by state health authorities who conducted epidemiological surveillance and health management efforts. In parallel, students received up-to-date scientific information about COVID-19 via short educational videos prepared by professors. A continuously updated triage algorithm was conceived to provide consistent service. RESULTS: The program operated for approximately 4 months, engaging 1396 medical students and 133 physicians. In total, 111,965 individuals residing in 343 municipalities used this service. Almost 70,000 individuals were advised to stay at home, and they received guidance to avoid disease transmission, potentially contributing to localized reductions in the spread of COVID-19. Additionally, the program promoted citizenship education for medical students, who were engaged in a real-life opportunity to fight the pandemic within their own communities. The objectives of the education, organization, and assistance domains of the Telecoronavirus program were successfully achieved according to the results of a web-based post-project survey that assessed physicians' and students' perceptions. CONCLUSIONS: In a prolonged pandemic scenario, a combination of remote tools and medical supervision via telehealth services may constitute a useful strategy for maintaining social distancing measures while preserving some practical aspects of medical education. A low-cost tool such as the Telecoronavirus program could be especially valuable in resource-limited health care scenarios, in addition to offering support for epidemiological surveillance actions.","Cerqueira-Silva, Thiago; Carreiro, Roberto; Nunes, Victor; Passos, Louran; Canedo, Bernardo F; Andrade, Sofia; Ramos, Pablo Ivan P; Khouri, Ricardo; Santos, Carolina Barbosa Souza; Nascimento, Jedson Dos Santos; Paste, Aurea Angélica; Paiva Filho, Ivan De Mattos; Santini-Oliveira, Marília; Cruz, Álvaro; Barral-Netto, Manoel; Boaventura, Viviane",JMIR Public Health Surveill,417,24

In this study, we provide a cross-sectional analysis of the dynamics of B cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. We observe changes in B cell subsets consistent with a robust humoral immune response, including significant expansion of plasmablasts and activated receptor-binding domain (RBD)-specific memory B cell populations. We observe elevated titers of Abs to SARS-CoV-2 RBD, full-length Spike, and nucleoprotein over the course of infection, with higher levels of RBD-specific IgG correlating with increased serum neutralization. Depletion of RBD-specific Abs from serum removed a major portion of neutralizing activity in most individuals. Some donors did retain significant residual neutralization activity, suggesting a potential Ab subset targeting non-RBD epitopes.

CDC and other health care organizations recommend routine blood lead level (BLL) testing among children as part of well-child examinations to facilitate prompt identification of elevated BLL, eliminate source exposure, and provide medical and other services (1). To describe BLL testing trends among young children during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, CDC analyzed data reported from 34 state and local health departments about BLL testing among children aged <6 years conducted during January-May 2019 and January-May 2020. Compared with testing in 2019, testing during January-May 2020 decreased by 34%, with 480,172 fewer children tested. An estimated 9,603 children with elevated BLL were missed because of decreased BLL testing. Despite geographic variability, all health departments reported fewer children tested for BLL after the national COVID-19 emergency declaration (March-May 2020). In addition, health departments reported difficulty conducting medical follow-up and environmental investigations for children with elevated BLLs because of staffing shortages and constraints on home visits associated with the pandemic. Providers and public health agencies need to take action to ensure that children who missed their scheduled blood lead screening test, or who required follow-up on an earlier high BLL, be tested as soon as possible and receive appropriate care.","Courtney, Joseph G; Chuke, Stella O; Dyke, Kelly; Credle, Kimball; Lecours, Carolina; Egan, Kathryn B; Leonard, Monica",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,417,20

The impact of COVID-19 on the thyroid gland has been described but several aspects have to be clarified. The systematic review was conceived to achieve more solid information about: 1) which thyroid disease or dysfunction should be expected in COVID-19 patients; 2) whether thyroid patients have a higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection; 3) whether the management has to be adapted in thyroid patient when infected. The literature was searched by two authors independently. A 5-step search strategy was a priori adopted. Only reviews focused on the relationship between thyroid and COVID-19 were included. The last search was performed on February 21st 2021. Two-hundred-forty-seven records was initially found and nine reviews were finally included. The reviews identified several potential thyroid consequences in COVID-19 patients, such as thyrotoxicosis, low-T3 syndrome and subacute thyroiditis, while no relevant data were found regarding the potential impact of COVID-19 on the management of patients on thyroid treatment. The present systematic review of reviews found that: 1) patients diagnosed with COVID-19 can develop thyroid dysfunction, frequently non-thyroidal illness syndrome when hospitalized in intensive care unit, 2) having a thyroid disease does not increase the risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection, 3) thyroid patients do not need a COVID-19-adapted follow-up. Anyway, several factors, such as critical illness and medications, could affect thyroid laboratory tests.","Trimboli, Pierpaolo; Camponovo, Chiara; Scappaticcio, Lorenzo; Bellastella, Giuseppe; Piccardo, Arnoldo; Rotondi, Mario",Rev Endocr Metab Disord,417,16

In this study, we identified temporal trends in public interest in cancer-related health information using the nowcasting tool Google Trends. METHODS: We used Google Trends to query search terms related to cancer types for short-term (September 2019-September 2020) and long-term (September 2016-September 2020) trends in the US. We compared average relative search volumes (RSV) for specified time ranges to detect recent and seasonal variation. RESULTS: General search interest declined for all cancer types beginning in March 2020, with changes in search interest for ""Breast cancer,"" ""Colorectal cancer,"" and ""Melanoma"" of - 30.6%, - 28.2%, and - 26.7%, respectively, and compared with the mean RSV of the two previous months. In the same time range, search interest for ""Telemedicine"" has increased by + 907.1% and has reached a 4-year peak with a sustained increased level of search interest. Absolute cancer mortality has declined and is presently at a 4-year low; however, search interest in cancer has been recuperating since July 2020. CONCLUSION: We observed a marked decline in searches for cancer-related health information that mirrors the reduction in new cancer diagnoses and cancer mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic. Health professions need to be prepared for the coming demand for cancer-related healthcare, foreshadowed by recovering interest in cancer-related information on Google Trends.","Adelhoefer, Siegfried; Berning, Philipp; Solomon, Stephen B; Maybody, Majid; Whelton, Seamus P; Blaha, Michael J; Dzaye, Omar",Cancer Causes Control,417,1

METHODS: We identified patients (&#8805;18 years) who completed a clinically indicated exercise stress test between January 1, 2016, and February 29, 2020, and had a test for SARS-CoV-2 (ie, real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction test) between February 29, 2020, and May 30, 2020. Maximal exercise capacity was quantified in metabolic equivalents of task (METs). Logistic regression was used to evaluate the likelihood that hospitalization secondary to COVID-19 is related to peak METs, with adjustment for 13 covariates previously identified as associated with higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19. RESULTS: We identified 246 patients (age, 59±12 years; 42% male; 75% black race) who had an exercise test and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Among these, 89 (36%) were hospitalized. Peak METs were significantly lower (P<.001) among patients who were hospitalized (6.7±2.8) compared with those not hospitalized (8.0±2.4). Peak METs were inversely associated with the likelihood of hospitalization in unadjusted (odds ratio, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.74-0.92) and adjusted models (odds ratio, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.76-0.99). CONCLUSION: Maximal exercise capacity is independently and inversely associated with the likelihood of hospitalization due to COVID-19. These data further support the important relationship between cardiorespiratory fitness and health outcomes. Future studies are needed to determine whether improving maximal exercise capacity is associated with lower risk of complications due to viral infections, such as COVID-19.","Brawner, Clinton A; Ehrman, Jonathan K; Bole, Shane; Kerrigan, Dennis J; Parikh, Sachin S; Lewis, Barry K; Gindi, Ryan M; Keteyian, Courtland; Abdul-Nour, Khaled; Keteyian, Steven J",Mayo Clin Proc,417,26

It is important to understand the nature of this health disparity and the socioeconomic or behavioral factors that are placing Hispanic communities and other minority populations at higher risk for morbidity and mortality. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this project is to assess current COVID-19-related knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) among a predominantly Hispanic population from Orange County, California, and identify risk factors that may contribute to increased susceptibility and vulnerability to contracting SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: Our Orange County-wide community survey consists of quantitative survey questions in four domains: demographic information, COVID-19 knowledge questions, COVID-19 attitude questions, and COVID-19 practices questions. The survey questions are adapted from recent global KAP studies. Participants are being recruited from Amistad Medical Clinic, a private primary health clinic group in Orange County that treats a predominantly Hispanic population. Patients recruited during telehealth visits are surveyed remotely by telephone, and those recruited during in-person clinic visits are surveyed in person. Surveys are conducted by trained members of the study team who are native to the community setting. RESULTS: As of October 12, 2020, we had recruited and enrolled 327 participants. Data collection occurred June 26th to October 30th. Data analysis is ongoing. CONCLUSIONS: Very few current COVID-19 studies focus on the perspective and experience of minority populations. Because Hispanic communities are disproportionately affected by COVID-19, it is important to understand the factors the contribute to this disparity and the next steps that should be taken to reduce the COVID-19 burden in this population. We believe that our study model of partnering with a local clinic system that serves our study population can be expanded to other settings to compare COVID-19 KAP and associated factors within different minority communities.

We aim to explore the impact of COVID-19 on the smoking behavior of individuals trying to quit tobacco. (2) Methods: This study presents a qualitative analysis of individual interviews focused on perceived impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on tobacco use among 39 participants in the Helping HAND 4 (HH4) post-hospitalization smoking cessation trial (NCT03603496). (3) Results: Emergent impacts of COVID-19 included change in routine, isolation, employment changes, and financial challenges; these in turn were associated with boredom, altered cravings and triggers, and increased stress. The availability of effective coping mechanisms instead of smoking to deal with stress heavily influenced subsequent smoking behavior. These results were triangulated with the Transactional Model of Stress, providing a framework to elucidate connections between factors such as perceived control, self-efficacy, and dispositional coping style, and highlighting potential areas for intervention. (4) Conclusions: Results suggest that stress during the COVID-19 pandemic may undermine effective coping skills among individuals enrolled in a post-hospitalization smoking cessation trial. Strengthening effective coping skills (e.g., minimizing the use of tobacco as a default stress response) and increasing perceived control and self-efficacy are promising intervention targets.","Schnitzer, Kristina; Jones, Sarah; Kelley, Jennifer H K; Tindle, Hilary A; Rigotti, Nancy A; Kruse, Gina R",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),417,24

MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred twenty-seven adult COVID-19 patients underwent chest CT scans on a CT scanner using the same scan protocol except with the manual positioning (MP group) for the initial scan and an AI-based automatic positioning method (AP group) for the follow-up scan. Radiation dose, patient positioning time, and off-center distance of the two groups were recorded and compared. Image noise and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) were assessed by three experienced radiologists and were compared between the two groups. RESULTS: The AP operation was successful for all patients in the AP group and reduced the total positioning time by 28% compared with the MP group. Compared with the MP group, the AP group had significantly less patient off-center distance (AP 1.56 cm ± 0.83 vs. MP 4.05 cm ± 2.40, p < 0.001) and higher proportion of positioning accuracy (AP 99% vs. MP 92%), resulting in 16% radiation dose reduction (AP 6.1 mSv ± 1.3 vs. MP 7.3 mSv ± 1.2, p < 0.001) and 9% image noise reduction in erector spinae and lower noise and higher SNR for lesions in the pulmonary peripheral areas. CONCLUSION: The AI-based automatic positioning and centering in CT imaging is a promising new technique for reducing radiation dose and optimizing imaging workflow and image quality in imaging the chest. KEY POINTS: â¢ The AI-based automatic positioning (AP) operation was successful for all patients in our study. â¢ AP method reduced the total positioning time by 28% compared with the manual positioning (MP). â¢ AP method had less patient off-center distance and higher proportion of positioning accuracy than MP method, resulting in 16% radiation dose reduction and 9% image noise reduction in erector spinae.","Gang, Yadong; Chen, Xiongfeng; Li, Huan; Wang, Hanlun; Li, Jianying; Guo, Ying; Zeng, Junjie; Hu, Qiang; Hu, Jinxiang; Xu, Haibo",Eur. radiol,417,1

This study investigated depression, anxiety and stress in New Zealand (NZ) during the first 10 weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic, and associated psychological and behavioural factors. It also compares the results with a similar cross-sectional study in the UK. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: NZ community cohort. PARTICIPANTS: N=681 adults (&#8805;18 years) in NZ. The cohort was predominantly female (89%) with a mean age of 42 years (range 18-87). Most (74%) identified as NZ European and almost half (46%) were keyworkers. Most were non-smokers (95%) and 20% identified themselves as having clinical risk factors which would put them at increased or greatest risk of COVID-19. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Depression, anxiety, stress, positive mood and engagement in health behaviours (smoking, exercise, alcohol consumption). RESULTS: Depression and anxiety significantly exceeded population norms (p<0.0001). Being younger (p<0.0001) and most at risk of COVID-19 (p<0.05) were associated with greater depression, anxiety and stress. Greater positive mood, lower loneliness and greater exercise were protective factors for all outcomes (p<0.0001). Smoking (p=0.037) and alcohol consumption (p<0.05) were associated with increased anxiety. Pet ownership was associated with lower depression (p=0.006) and anxiety (p=0.008). When adjusting for age and gender differences, anxiety (p=0.002) and stress (p=0.007) were significantly lower in NZ than in the UK. The NZ sample reported lower perceived risk (p<0.0001) and worry about COVID-19 (p<0.0001) than the UK sample. CONCLUSIONS: The NZ population had higher depression and anxiety compared with population norms. Younger people and those most at risk of COVID-19 reported poorer mental health. Interventions should promote frequent exercise, and reduce loneliness and unhealthy behaviours.","Gasteiger, Norina; Vedhara, Kavita; Massey, Adam; Jia, Ru; Ayling, Kieran; Chalder, Trudie; Coupland, Carol; Broadbent, Elizabeth",BMJ Open,417,28

This research investigated the influence of individuals' belief in fate control on ingroup bias in helping with COVID-19, and the mediating role of risk perception of COVID-19. To test our hypothesis, we analyzed the data from a community sample (nâ¯=â¯318) collected at the initial stage of the COVID-19 outbreak in China. We found that fate control was positively associated with ingroup bias in donation to the patients with COVID-19 and the frontline healthcare professionals. Moreover, the mediating role of risk perception of COVID-19 was significant. A higher level of fate control was associated with higher risk perception of COVID-19, which was, in turn, related to stronger ingroup bias in donation across individuals. These findings highlight the substantial role of general worldview in shaping individuals' responses to pandemics.","Li, Wen-Qiao; Li, Liman Man Wai; Jiang, Da; Liu, Shuang",Pers Individ Dif,417,16

OBJECTIVE: We examined whether mentally associating specific diseases with COVID-19 was related to self-reported protective behaviors early in the pandemic. METHODS: In March 2020, a national sample of 6534 U.S. adults listed diseases that came to mind when thinking of COVID-19. They self-reported protective behaviors, demographics, and COVID-19 risk perceptions. RESULTS: Participants associated COVID-19 with common infectious diseases like seasonal influenza (59%), common cold (11%), and pneumonia (10%), or emergent infectious diseases like pandemic influenza (28%), SARS/MERS (27%), and Ebola (14%). Seasonal influenza was most commonly mentioned, in all demographic groups. Participants mentioning seasonal influenza or common cold reported fewer protective behaviors. Those mentioning pneumonia or emergent infectious diseases reported more protective behaviors. Mentioning pneumonia, SARS/MERS, and Ebola was associated with the most protective behaviors, after accounting for other generated diseases, demographics, and risk perceptions (e.g., for avoiding crowds, OR = 1.52, 95% CI = 1.26, 1.83; OR = 1.28, 95% CI = 1.13, 1.46; OR = 1.30, 95% CI = 1.11, 1.52, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Early in the pandemic, most participants mentally associated COVID-19 with seasonal flu, which may have undermined willingness to protect themselves. To motivate behavior change, COVID-19 risk communications may need to mention diseases that resonate with people while retaining accuracy.","Bruine de Bruin, Wändi; Carman, Katherine G; Parker, Andrew M",Soc Sci Med,417,22

Its impact on the central nervous system is still poorly understood. The objective of this work is to assess the involvement of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the aggravation of seizures in children known to have epilepsy and in the epileptogenesis of children hitherto seizure-free. Prior to conducting this work, we had obtained informed consent from patients and parents. We report the cases of three (3) patients, one known epileptic and the other two apparently healthy, who presented a febrile seizure in a context of COVID-19 infection. The aggravation of the epileptic seizure was indicative of a SARS-CoV-2 infection in the first patient, while the seizure occurred after induction of chloroquine sulfate treatment in the 2 other patients. Although our current concern is to limit the spread of the disease to COVID-19, it is crucial to address its possible complications. Notably, the worsening of seizures in children with epilepsy and the occurrence of first seizures in children without epilepsy following drug treatment. Equipping our COVID-19 patient management facilities with electroencephalogram (EEG) equipment could facilitate continuous electroencephalographic monitoring of children for proper management.","Atakla, Hugues Ghislain; Noudohounsi, Aïtchéou Cadnel Wilfried Houedenou; Barry, Lounceny Fatoumata; Noudohounsi, Mahugnon Maurel Ulrich Dénis; Legba, Lauréano Déo-Gratias; Souare, Ibrahima Sory; Kaba, Fatoumata; Houinato, Dismand Stephan",Pan Afr Med J,417,1

As more individuals are vaccinated, the clinical performance and utility of SARS-CoV-2 serology platforms needs to be evaluated. METHODS: The ability of four commercial SARS-CoV-2 serology platforms to detect previous infection or vaccination were evaluated using a cohort of 53 SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive patients, 89 SARS-CoV-2-vaccinated healthcare workers (Pfizer or Moderna), and 127 SARS-CoV-2 negative patients. Serology results were compared to a cell based SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus (PSV) neutralizing antibodies assay. RESULTS: The Roche S-(spike) antibody and Diazyme neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) assays detected adaptive immune response in 100.0% and 90.1% of vaccinated individuals who received two-doses of vaccine (initial and booster), respectively. The Roche N-(nucleocapsid) antibody assay and Diazyme IgG assay did not detect adaptive immune response in vaccinated individuals. The Diazyme Nabs assay correlated with the PSV SARS-CoV-2 ID50 neutralization titers (R2= 0.70), while correlation of the Roche S-antibody assay was weaker (R2= 0.39). Median PSV SARS-CoV-2 ID50 titers more than doubled in vaccinated individuals who received two-doses of the Moderna vaccine (ID50: 597) compared to individuals that received a single dose (ID50: 284). CONCLUSIONS: The Roche S-antibody and Diazyme NAbs assays robustly detected adaptive immune responses in SARS-CoV-2 vaccinated individuals and SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals. The Diazyme NAbs assay strongly correlates with the PSV SARS-CoV-2 NAbs in vaccinated individuals. Understanding the reactivity of commercially available serology platforms is important when distinguishing vaccination response versus natural infection.","Suhandynata, Raymond T; Bevins, Nicholas J; Tran, Jenny T; Huang, Deli; Hoffman, Melissa A; Lund, Kyle; Kelner, Michael J; McLawhon, Ronald W; Gonias, Steven L; Nemazee, David; Fitzgerald, Robert L",,417,25

Lately, the role played by the neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) in the development of HCC has attracted attention. However, the exact relationship is not fully understood.A total of 538 participants diagnosed with HCC were recruited between 2010 and 2018. Their relevant routine blood parameters were measured, including NLR. Pearson Chi-Squared test, Spearman Rho test, and logistic regression analysis were performed to explore any correlations between NLR and HCC. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed to determine the usefulness of NLR for predicting HCC. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis for relevant routine blood parameters and any relationships with overall survival (OS) were performed. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to explore any further relationships with OS.NLR was significantly correlated with HCC tumor size by Pearson Chi-Squared test (P = .008). Furthermore, Spearman correlation coefficient showed that HCC tumor size was significantly correlated with NLR (Pâ=â.115, Pâ=â.008). NLR could sensitively and specifically predict HCC tumor size (area under the curve [AUC], 0.605; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.429-0.743; Pâ=â.000). Higher NLR in patients with HCC was correlated with better OS (hazard ratio [HR]â=â0.584; Pâ=â.000).A close correlation existed between increased NLR and HCC; NLR could sensitively and specifically predict HCC.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Consecutive patients (n=172) who underwent additional whole-chest CT via a COVID-19 acute abdominal pain CT imaging pathway between 27 March and 3 May 2020 were evaluated in this retrospective single-centre study. Chest CT examinations were graded as non-COVID-19, indeterminate for, or classic/probable for COVID-19. CT examinations in the latter two categories were further divided into one of three anatomical distributions (lung base, limited chest [below carina], whole chest [above carina]) based on location of findings. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) results and clinical features of COVID-19 were assessed to determine if COVID-19 was clinically suspected at the time of CT referral. RESULTS: Twenty-seven of the 172 (15.7%) patients had CT features potentially indicative of COVID-19 pneumonia, 6/27 (3.5%) demonstrating a classic/probable pattern and 21/27 (12.2%) demonstrating an indeterminate pattern. After correlation with clinical features and RT-PCR 8/172 (4.7%) were defined as COVID-19 positive, of which only 1/172 (0.6%) was clinically unsuspected of COVID-19 at the time of CT referral. All COVID-19 positive cases could be identified on review of the lung base alone. CONCLUSION: Whole-chest CT as part of an acute abdominal pain CT imaging pathway has a very low diagnostic yield for our cohort of patients. All COVID-19-positive patients in our cohort were identified on review of the lung bases on the abdominal CT and this offers an alternative imaging approach in this patient group.","Hamilton, N E; Adam, G H; Ifan, D L; Lam, S S; Johnson, K; Vedwan, K A G; Shambrook, J S; Peebles, C R; Harden, S P; Abbas, A",Clin Radiol,417,24

Midgut symbiotic bacteria can be genetically exploited to express molecules within the vectors, altering vector competency and potential for disease transmission. Therefore, identification of mosquito gut inhabiting microbiota is of ample importance before developing novel vector control strategies that involve modification of vectors. Method: Adult mosquitoes of Culex tritaeniorhynchus, Culex gelidus, and Mansonia annulifera were collected from selected Medical Officer of Health (MOH) areas in the Gampaha district of Sri Lanka. Midgut lysates of the field-caught non-blood-fed female mosquitoes were cultured in Plate Count Agar medium, and Prokaryotic 16S ribosomal RNA partial genes of the isolated bacteria colonies were amplified followed by DNA sequencing. Diversity indices were used to assess the diversity and richness of the bacterial isolates in three mosquito species. The distribution pattern of bacterial isolates between different mosquito species was assessed by Distance-Based Redundancy Analysis (dbRDA). Results: A total of 20 bacterial species (Staphylococcus pasteuri, Bacillus megaterium, Staphylococcus cohnii, Pantoea dispersa, Staphylococcus chromogenes, Bacillus aquimaris, Staphylococcus arlettae, Staphylococcus sciuri, Staphylococcus warneri, Moraxella osloensis, Enterobacter sp., Klebsiella michiganensis, Staphylococcus hominis, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Streptomyces sp., Bacillus niacin, Cedecea neteri, Micrococcus luteus, Lysinibacillus sphaericus, and Bacillus licheniformis) were identified. All of these species belonged to three phyla, Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Actinobacteria, out of which phylum Firmicutes (71.1%) was the most prominent. The least number of species was recorded from Actinobacteria. The relative distribution of midgut microbes in different mosquito species differed significantly among mosquito species (Chi-square, &#967; 2 = 486.091; df = 36; P &#8804; 0.001). Midgut microbiota of Cx. tritaeniorhynchus and Cx. gelidus indicated a similarity of 21.51%, while Ma. annulifera shared a similarity of 6.92% with the cluster of above two species. The gut microbiota of Cx. tritaeniorhynchus was also significantly more diverse and more evenly distributed compared to Ma. annulifera. Simpson's diversity, Margalef's diversity, and Menhinick's diversity indices were higher in Cx. gelidus. Of the recorded species, P. dispersa and strains of nonpathogenic species in Bacillaceae family (B. megaterium, B. niacini, B. licheniformis, and L. sphaericus) can be recommended as potential candidates for paratransgenesis. Conclusion: The relative distribution of midgut microbes in different mosquito species differed significantly among the three studied adult mosquito species. The present data strongly encourage further investigations to explore the potential usage of these microbes through paratransgenic approach for novel eco-friendly vector control strategies.","Gunathilaka, Nayana; Ranasinghe, Koshila; Amarasinghe, Deepika; Rodrigo, Wasana; Mallawarachchi, Harendra; Chandrasena, Nilmini",Biomed Res Int,417,16

Here we characterised the aerosol microbial abundance, diversity and composition in the Athens underground railway system. PM10 filter samples were collected from the naturally ventilated Athens Metro Line 3 station ""Nomismatokopio"". Quantitative PCR of the 16S rRNA gene and high throughput amplicon sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region was performed on DNA extracted from PM10 samples. Results showed that, despite the bacterial abundance (mean = 2.82 × 105 16S rRNA genes/m3 of air) being, on average, higher during day-time and weekdays, compared to night-time and weekends, respectively, the differences were not statistically significant. The average PM10 mass concentration on the platform was 107 µg/m3. However, there was no significant correlation between 16S rRNA gene abundance and overall PM10 levels. The Athens Metro air microbiome was mostly dominated by bacterial and fungal taxa of environmental origin (e.g. Paracoccus, Sphingomonas, Cladosporium, Mycosphaerella, Antrodia) with a lower contribution of human commensal bacteria (e.g. Corynebacterium, Staphylococcus). This study highlights the importance of both outdoor air and commuters as sources in shaping aerosol microbial communities. To our knowledge, this is the first study to characterise the mycobiome diversity in the air of a Metro environment based on amplicon sequencing of the ITS region. In conclusion, this study presents the first microbial characterisation of PM10 in the Athens Metro, contributing to the growing body of microbiome exploration within urban transit networks.

Diabetic retinopathy is a primary vision complication of diabetes and a leading cause of blindness among adults, with 26% prevalence among women. Tele-retina is a branch of telemedicine that delivers eye care remotely. Screening for diabetic retinopathy has great potential to reduce the incidence of blindness, yet there is an adverse association among screening, income, and gender. OBJECTIVE: We aim to explore gender disparity in the provision of tele-retina program services for diabetic retinopathy screening in a cohort of women of low socioeconomic status (SES) receiving services in South Riverdale Community Health Centre (SRCHC) between 2014 and 2019. METHODS: Using a convergent mixed methods design, we want to understand patients', providers', administrators', and decision makers' perceptions of the facilitators and barriers associated with the implementation and adoption of tele-retina. Multivariate logistic regression will be utilized to assess the association among client characteristics, referral source, and diabetic retinopathy screening. Guided by a grounded theory approach, systematic coding of data and thematic analysis will be utilized to identify key facilitators and barriers to the implementation and adoption of tele-retina. RESULTS: For the quantitative component, we anticipate a cohort of 2500 patients, and we expect to collect data on the overall patterns of tele-retina program use, including descriptions of program utilization rates (such as data on received and completed diabetic retinopathy screening referrals) along the landscape of patient populations receiving these services. For the qualitative component, we plan to interview up to 21 patients and 14 providers, administrators, and decision makers, and to conduct up to 14 hours of observations alongside review of relevant documents. The interview guide is being developed in collaboration with our patient partners. Through the use of mixed methods research, the inquiry will be approached from different perspectives. Mixed methods will guide us in combining the rich subjective insights on complex realities from qualitative inquiry with the standard generalizable data that will be generated through quantitative research. The study is under review by the University Health Network Research Ethics Board (19-5628). We expect to begin recruitment in winter 2021. CONCLUSIONS: In Ontario, the screening rate for diabetic retinopathy among low income groups remains below 65%. Understanding the facilitators and barriers to diabetic retinopathy screening may be a prerequisite in the development of a successful screening program. This study is the first Ontario study to focus on diabetic retinopathy screening practices in women of low SES, with the aim to improve their health outcomes and revolutionize access to quality care.

Though these maps serve as an effective political and social tool in communicating disease impact, most visualizations largely over-emphasize their usefulness for tracking disease progression and appropriate responses. Messy and inconsistent health data are a big part of this problem, as is a paucity of high-resolution spatial data to monitor health outcomes. Another issue is that the ease of producing out-of-the box products largely out paces the response to the core challenges inherent in the poor quality of most geo-referenced data.

(2) Methods: We used information available in the nationwide Spanish SEMI-COVID-19 Registry, which retrospectively compiles data from the first admission of adult patients with COVID-19. We selected all patients with ADs included in the registry and compared them to the remaining patients. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality during admission, readmission, and subsequent admissions, and secondary outcomes were a composite outcome including the need for intensive care unit (ICU) admission, invasive and non-invasive mechanical ventilation (MV), or death, as well as in-hospital complications. (3) Results: A total of 13,940 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were included, of which 362 (2.6%) had an AD. Patients with ADs were older, more likely to be female, and had greater comorbidity. On the multivariate logistic regression analysis, which involved the inverse propensity score weighting method, AD as a whole was not associated with an increased risk of any of the outcome variables. Habitual treatment with corticosteroids (CSs), age, Barthel Index score, and comorbidity were associated with poor outcomes. Biological disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) were associated with a decrease in mortality in patients with AD. (4) Conclusions: The analysis of the SEMI-COVID-19 Registry shows that ADs do not lead to a different prognosis, measured by mortality, complications, or the composite outcome. Considered individually, it seems that some diseases entail a different prognosis than that of the general population.

At the time of writing this paper, the world suffers from an outbreak of the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. A promising way to stop the virus replication is via protease inhibition. We propose an evolutionary multi-objective algorithm (EMOA) to design potential protease inhibitors for SARS-CoV-2's main protease. Based on the SELFIES representation the EMOA maximizes the binding of candidate ligands to the protein using the docking tool QuickVina 2, while at the same time taking into account further objectives like drug-likeliness or the fulfillment of filter constraints. The experimental part analyzes the evolutionary process and discusses the inhibitor candidates.","Cofala, Tim; Elend, Lars; Mirbach, Philip; Prellberg, Jonas; Teusch, Thomas; Kramer, Oliver",,417,2

At this point in time, there is no proven effective therapy. The interactions with concomitant disease are largely unknown, and that may be particularly pertinent to inherited arrhythmia syndrome. An arrhythmogenic effect of COVID-19 can be expected, potentially contributing to disease outcome. This may be of importance for patients with an increased risk of cardiac arrhythmias, either secondary to acquired conditions or comorbidities or consequent to inherited syndromes. Management of patients with inherited arrhythmia syndromes such as long QT syndrome, Brugada syndrome, short QT syndrome, and catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia in the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic may prove particularly challenging. Depending on the inherited defect involved, these patients may be susceptible to proarrhythmic effects of COVID-19-related issues such as fever, stress, electrolyte disturbances, and use of antiviral drugs. Here, we describe the potential COVID-19-associated risks and therapeutic considerations for patients with distinct inherited arrhythmia syndromes and provide recommendations, pending local possibilities, for their monitoring and management during this pandemic.","Wu, Cheng-I; Postema, Pieter G; Arbelo, Elena; Behr, Elijah R; Bezzina, Connie R; Napolitano, Carlo; Robyns, Tomas; Probst, Vincent; Schulze-Bahr, Eric; Remme, Carol Ann; Wilde, Arthur A M",Heart rhythm,417,14

The primary objective of the present study is to examine the role of doctor-patient communication and vaccination. We test the impact of doctor-patient communication on trust in doctors' vaccine recommendations as a mediator, to understand the mechanisms leading to positive vaccination attitudes, and ultimately leading to actual H1N1 vaccination behavior. We use data from a nationally representative U.S. sample from one of the Multimedia Audience Research Systems (MARS) data sets collected by Kantar Media. Our results demonstrate the crucial role of doctor-patient communication in building patients' trust in doctors, which in turn positively impact vaccination attitudes and H1N1 vaccination behavior. Unlike other preventive health measures, getting vaccines after a pandemic is a critical decision because these vaccines are previously unknown. Our finding implies that verified communication from the physician's office may be one of the effective strategies during or after a pandemic. Our findings have implications for public health organizations to incorporate effective vaccination communication and could have critical implications for the COVID-19 vaccination.","Borah, Porismita; Hwang, Juwon",Health Commun,417,15

Directly preventing this interaction presents an attractive possibility for suppressing SARS-CoV-2 replication. Here, we report the isolation and characterization of an alpaca-derived single domain antibody fragment, Ty1, that specifically targets the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike, directly preventing ACE2 engagement. Ty1 binds the RBD with high affinity, occluding ACE2. A cryo-electron microscopy structure of the bound complex at 2.9 Å resolution reveals that Ty1 binds to an epitope on the RBD accessible in both the 'up' and 'down' conformations, sterically hindering RBD-ACE2 binding. While fusion to an Fc domain renders Ty1 extremely potent, Ty1 neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudovirus as a 12.8 kDa nanobody, which can be expressed in high quantities in bacteria, presenting opportunities for manufacturing at scale. Ty1 is therefore an excellent candidate as an intervention against COVID-19.","Hanke, Leo; Vidakovics Perez, Laura; Sheward, Daniel J; Das, Hrishikesh; Schulte, Tim; Moliner-Morro, Ainhoa; Corcoran, Martin; Achour, Adnane; Karlsson Hedestam, Gunilla B; Hällberg, B Martin; Murrell, Ben; McInerney, Gerald M",Nat Commun,417,16

APPROACH AND RESULTS: We identified 88,747 patients tested for SARS-CoV-2 between 3/1/20-5/14/20 in the Veterans Affairs (VA) national healthcare system, including 75,315 with no cirrhosis-SARS-CoV-2 negative (C0-S0), 9826 with no cirrhosis-SARS-CoV-2 positive (C0-S1); 3301 with cirrhosis-SARS-CoV-2 negative (C1-S0); and 305 with cirrhosis-SARS-CoV-2 positive (C1-S1). Patients were followed through 6/22/20. Hospitalization, mechanical ventilation and death were modeled in time-to-event analyses using Cox proportional hazards regression. Patients with cirrhosis were less likely to test positive than patients without cirrhosis (8.5% vs. 11.5%, adjusted odds ratio 0.83, 95% CI 0.69-0.99). Thirty-day mortality and ventilation rates increased progressively from C0-S0 (2.3% and 1.6%), to C1-S0 (5.2% and 3.6%), to C0-S1 (10.6% and 6.5%), to C1-S1(17.1% and 13.0%). Among patients with cirrhosis, those who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 were 4.1 times more likely to undergo mechanical ventilation (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 4.12, 95% CI 2.79-6.10) and 3.5 times more likely to die (aHR 3.54, 95% CI 2.55-4.90) than those who tested negative. Among patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, those with cirrhosis were more likely to be hospitalized (aHR 1.37, 95% CI 1.12-1.66), undergo ventilation (aHR 1.61, 95% CI 1.05-2.46) or die (aHR 1.65, 95% CI 1.18-2.30) than patients without cirrhosis. Among patients with cirrhosis and SARS-CoV-2 infection, the most important predictors of mortality were advanced age, cirrhosis decompensation and high MELD score. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with a 3.5-fold increase in mortality in patients with cirrhosis. Cirrhosis was associated with a 1.7-fold increase in mortality in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Ioannou, George N; Liang, Peter S; Locke, Emily; Green, Pamela; Berry, Kristin; O039,; Hare, Ann M; Shah, Javeed A; Crothers, Kristina; Eastment, McKenna C; Fan, Vincent S; Dominitz, Jason A",Hepatology (Baltim.),417,16

Urban parks encourage physical and social activity, recreation and relaxation, and thus eventually promote people's well-being. The aim of the current study is to examine which urban park attributes influence the preferences of park users, in order to offer recommendations regarding how urban parks of quality can be designed. To elicit the preferences of park visitors we designed an online stated-choice experiment. Seven park attributes, in particular the number and composition of trees and the presence of benches, side paths, a playground, litter, and flowers, were manipulated in a virtual park. In an online stated-choice task, videos of these park alternatives were presented and the preferences of 697 participants were measured. It is found that especially the number of trees and the presence of flowerbeds, particularly with a diversity of flowers, influenced participants' preferences. The presence of many benches and a playground were valued as well, but to a lesser extent. The presence of litter was found to be less troublesome than expected. Alternatives with all trees placed in one cluster were disliked. Moreover, significant standard deviations were found for the presence of side paths, a playground, and the absence of litter, which indicates that preference heterogeneity for these attributes exist. In a latent class analysis, two groups were identified, namely a Nature-loving group, who mainly valued the trees and the flowers, and an Amenity-appreciating group, who valued almost all attributes. It can be concluded that natural elements and a variety of flower species are important in an urban park, while facilities are evaluated differently by different groups of people. These findings may support park designers and policymakers in decision-making. Moreover, it illustrates the usefulness of creating a virtual park in environmental preference research.","van Vliet, Esther; Dane, Gamze; Weijs-Perrée, Minou; van Leeuwen, Eveline; van Dinter, Mayke; van den Berg, Pauline; Borgers, Aloys; Chamilothori, Kynthia",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),417,24

During the Covid-19 crisis, even less time is spent at the bedside, and physical examinations seem markedly truncated or non-existent. It is possible that cost of health care, doctor-patient relationships, and the clinical reasoning skills could be seriously impacted by ongoing decrease in bedside skills and the teaching of these skills. Careful history taking and hypothesis-driven physical examination still form the backbone of clinical reasoning and lead to parsimonious investigations. Overreliance on investigations could drive up costs of healthcare if every diagnosis depends on a head to toe scan. In this paper, we describe strategies for bedside teaching that are relevant and applicable even during the pandemic and an era of physical distancing. These strategies are categorised as: before, during and after patient interactions at the bedside. These strategies can be adapted to normal clinical teaching situations as well as challenging situations such as the current pandemic when physical distancing is mandated.","Dam, Marjel van; Ramani, Subha; Ten Cate, Olle",Med Teach,417,1

The aim of this investigation was to compare the hematologic parameters of domestic pigeons (Columba livia var. domestica) naturally infected with M avium subsp. avium (MAA) with clinically healthy pigeons. Blood samples were collected from 12 pigeons with suspected mycobacteriosis and 12 clinically healthy pigeons. All the birds with suspect infections were necropsied, and affected organs were cultured and examined on histopathology for mycobacteriosis. Total leukocyte and erythrocyte counts were performed on each blood sample with the Natt and Herrick method using a Neubauer hemocytometer. White blood cell (WBC) differential counts were performed on Giemsa-stained blood smears. Packed cell volumes (PCVs) were measured using the microhematocrit technique. Hemoglobin concentrations were measured with a spectrophotometer using the cyanomethemoglubin method. Mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentrations (MCHCs), and mean cell volumes (MCVs) were calculated manually. All of the infected birds had typical histopathologic findings of avian mycobacteriosis, which were confirmed using microbiologic and molecular methods to detect MAA. The hematologic data from the two groups were compared. The total WBC, heterophil, lymphocyte, and monocyte counts were significantly higher, and the PCV, HGB, MCH, and MCHC values were significantly lower in the infected birds compared with the clinically healthy pigeons.","Parvandar Asadollahi, Kaveh; Mayahi, Mansour; Rocky, Alireza; Khajeh, Gholam Hossein; Mosavari, Nader",Vet. clin. pathol,417,14

Children infected with SARS-CoV-2 may have a few or many non-specific symptoms or may be asymptomatic. The aim of this study was to analyze clinical features and exposure to SARS-CoV-2 characteristics of children screened for COVID-19 at the pediatric emergency department in Vilnius during the first 3 months (March-May) of the COVID-19 pandemic in Lithuania. SARS-CoV-2 PCR was positive for 0.6% (8/1348) of all screened children and for 0.9% (7/811) of symptomatic patients, more among children with fever and cough (2.6%, 4/154). There were also COVID-19 cases among children without cough but with other respiratory symptoms (0.5%, 2/409) or gastrointestinal symptoms (1.2%, 3/257). Only one child with positive SARS-CoV-2 did not meet COVID-19 clinical criteria-he presented with vomiting and dehydration only. All COVID-19 cases (n = 8) had a contact with a confirmed COVID-19 family member. There were no COVID-19 cases among children without known exposure to SARS-CoV-2 or among asymptomatic children.Conclusion: Screening for COVID-19 in children is exceptionally challenging due to the diverse and non-specific symptoms of infection they present. Testing strategies should not only focus on the typical COVID-19 symptoms of fever or cough, but also include other symptoms, especially gastrointestinal symptoms, which are also important. The greatest attention should be paid to known exposure to SARS-CoV-2, especially in family clusters. Screening of asymptomatic children with no known exposure should be weighed for medical necessity and cost-effectiveness. What is Known: â¢ Diagnosis of COVID-19 in children is challenging because the disease does not always manifest with typical symptoms. What is New: â¢ Children in our study who did not have symptoms of acute infection and contact with another person infected with COVID-19 were not diagnosed with COVID-19, so the benefit of PCR testing is questionable. Such testing may only be useful for infection control purposes, and to limit intra-hospital transmission.","Staceviciene, Indre; Burokiene, Sigita; Steponaviciene, Ausra; Vaiciuniene, Daiva; Jankauskiene, Augustina",Eur. j. pediatr,417,21

The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted problems in evaluating the epidemiological scope of the disease using classical surveillance approaches, due to a lack of diagnostic capacity, and their application to only a small proportion of the population. As in previous pandemics, statistics, particularly the proportion of the population infected, are believed to be widely underestimated. Furthermore, analysis of only clinical samples cannot predict outbreaks in a timely manner or easily capture asymptomatic carriers.

RESULTS: No correlation between PHEpc and MR-COVID-19 (r: 0.3; p = .14) was found among European countries or Spain's Autonomous Communities (r: 0.03; p=0.91). No significant differences were found when comparing MR-COVID-19 among PHEpc groups. CONCLUSIONS: The available evidence does not support association between ""low"" public healthcare expenditure and the poor outcomes observed in Spain during the COVID-19 pandemic.

There is, however, no consensus on the origin of this pattern, which may originate from human behaviour rather than from the virus diffusion itself. Time-honoured models of the SIR type or others based on complex networks describe well the exponential spread of the disease, but cannot naturally accommodate the wave pattern. Nevertheless, understanding this time-structure is of paramount importance in designing effective prevention measures. Here we propose a consistent picture of the wave pattern based on the epidemic Renormalisation Group (eRG) framework, which is guided by the global symmetries of the system under time rescaling. We show that the rate of spreading of the disease can be interpreted as a time-dilation symmetry, while the final stage of an epidemic episode corresponds to reaching a time scale-invariant state. We find that the endemic period between two waves is a sign of instability in the system, associated to near-breaking of the time scale-invariance. This phenomenon can be described in terms of an eRG model featuring complex fixed points. Our results demonstrate that the key to control the arrival of the next wave of a pandemic is in the strolling period in between waves, i.e. when the number of infections grow linearly. Thus, limiting the virus diffusion in this period is the most effective way to prevent or delay the arrival of the next wave. In this work we establish a new guiding principle for the formulation of mid-term governmental strategies to curb pandemics and avoid recurrent waves of infections, deleterious in terms of human life loss and economic damage.","Cacciapaglia, Giacomo; Cot, Corentin; Sannino, Francesco",,417,27

However, since it is not always based in the most qualified evidence, it is frequently questioned. The emergence of a highly contagious disease, with increased levels of morbimortality, an acute respiratory syndrome, the so called Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), led health professionals to look for the best alternatives to save lives. In this sense, the precautionary principle was evocated. The aim of this paper is to make a reflection about the precautionary principle, the dental profession and COVID-19. It is important to have in mind that in such a disease, guidelines, protocols and approaches can change very fast, since a continuous evaluation of all policies is mandatory. During the pandemic, elective procedures may be restricted, but international organizations removed the recommendation to postpone elective procedures. Clinicians are advised to be updated about their local current policies. On the other hand, there are cases in which in-office dental care is unavoidable, such as individuals with pain, spontaneous bleeding and dental trauma. Biosafety is upmost importance when seeking patients during pandemic. In this sense, it was concluded that precautionary principle should be, therefore, used. However, caution needs to be taken and continuous surveillance necessary.","Rösing, Cassiano Kuchenbecker; Cavagni, Juliano; Langa, Gerson Pedro José; Mazzetti, Thais; Muniz, Francisco Wilker Mustafa Gomes",Pesqui.

However, little is known about the impact of coinfection with tuberculosis. We aimed to compare the risk of death and recovery, as well as time-to-death and time-to-recovery, in COVID-19 patients with and without tuberculosis. METHODS: We created a 4:1 propensity score matched sample of COVID-19 patients without and with tuberculosis, using COVID-19 surveillance data in the Philippines. We conducted a longitudinal cohort analysis of matched COVID-19 patients as of May 17, 2020, following them until June 15, 2020. The primary analysis estimated the risk ratios of death and recovery in patients with and without tuberculosis. Kaplan-Meier curves described time-to-death and time-to-recovery stratified by tuberculosis status, and differences in survival were assessed using the Wilcoxon test. RESULTS: The risk of death in COVID-19 patients with tuberculosis was 2.17 times higher than in those without (95% CI: 1.40-3.37). The risk of recovery in COVID-19 patients with tuberculosis was 25% lower than in those without (RR = 0.75,05% CI 0.63-0.91). Similarly, time-to-death was significantly shorter (p = .0031) and time-to-recovery significantly longer in patients with tuberculosis (p = .0046). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show that coinfection with tuberculosis increased morbidity and mortality in COVID-19 patients. Our findings highlight the need to prioritize routine and testing services for tuberculosis, although health systems are disrupted by the heavy burden of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.","Sy, Karla Therese L; Haw, Nel Jason L; Uy, Jhanna",Infect Dis (Lond),417,29

We developed a mathematical model for investigating and predicting the effects of lockdown on future COVID-19 cases with a specific focus on India. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this work was to develop and validate a mathematical model and to assess the impact of various lockdown scenarios on COVID-19 transmission in India. METHODS: A model consisting of a framework of ordinary differential equations was developed by incorporating the actual reported cases in 14 countries. After validation, the model was applied to predict COVID-19 transmission in India for different intervention scenarios in terms of lockdown for 4, 14, 21, 42, and 60 days. We also assessed the situations of enhanced exposure due to aggregation of individuals in transit stations and shopping malls before the lockdown. RESULTS: The developed model is efficient in predicting the number of COVID-19 cases compared to the actual reported cases in 14 countries. For India, the model predicted marked reductions in cases for the intervention periods of 14 and 21 days of lockdown and significant reduction for 42 days of lockdown. Such intervention exceeding 42 days does not result in measurable improvement. Finally, for the scenario of ""panic shopping"" or situations where there is a sudden increase in the factors leading to higher exposure to infection, the model predicted an exponential transmission, resulting in failure of the considered intervention strategy. CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of a strict lockdown for a period of at least 21 days is expected to reduce the transmission of COVID-19. However, a further extension of up to 42 days is required to significantly reduce the transmission of COVID-19 in India.

During an outbreak of SARS-COV-2 with community transmission, our institution used an integrated strategy for early detection and containment of COVID-19 cases among healthcare workers (HCWs). METHODS: Our strategy comprised 3 key components: (1) enforcing reporting of HCWs with acute respiratory illness (ARI) to our institution's staff clinic for monitoring; (2) conducting ongoing syndromic surveillance to obtain early warning of potential clusters of COVID-19; and (3) outbreak investigation and management. RESULTS: Over a 16-week surveillance period, we detected 14 cases of COVID-19 among HCWs with ARI symptoms. Two of the cases were linked epidemiologically and thus constituted a COVID-19 cluster with intrahospital HCW-HCW transmission; we also detected 1 family cluster and 2 clusters among HCWs who shared accommodation. No transmission to HCWs or patients was detected after containment measures were instituted. Early detection minimized the number of HCWs requiring quarantine, hence preserving continuity of service during an ongoing pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: An integrated surveillance strategy, outbreak management, and encouraging individual responsibility were successful in early detection of clusters of COVID-19 among HCWs. With ongoing local transmission, vigilance must be maintained for intrahospital spread in nonclinical areas where social mingling of HCWs occurs. Because most individuals with COVID-19 have mild symptoms, addressing presenteeism is crucial to minimize potential staff and patient exposure.","Wee, Liang En; Sim, Xiang Ying Jean; Conceicao, Edwin Philip; Aung, May Kyawt; Goh, Jia Qing; Yeo, Dennis Wu Ting; Gan, Wee Hoe; Chua, Ying Ying; Wijaya, Limin; Tan, Thuan Tong; Tan, Ban Hock; Ling, Moi Lin; Venkatachalam, Indumathi",Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol,417,1

Characterizing SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis in primary human target cells and tissues is crucial for developing vaccines and therapeutics. However, given the limited access to clinical samples from COVID-19 patients, there is a pressing need for in vitro/in vivo models to investigate authentic SARS-CoV-2 infection in primary human lung cells or tissues with mature structures. The present study was designed to evaluate a humanized mouse model carrying human lung xenografts for SARS-CoV-2 infection in vivo. Methods: Human fetal lung tissue surgically grafted under the dorsal skin of SCID mice were assessed for growth and development after 8 weeks. Following SARS-CoV-2 inoculation into the differentiated lung xenografts, viral replication, cell-type tropism and histopathology of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and local cytokine/chemokine expression were determined over a 6-day period. The effect of IFN-&#945; treatment against SARS-CoV-2 infection was tested in the lung xenografts. Results: Human lung xenografts expanded and developed mature structures closely resembling normal human lung. SARS-CoV-2 replicated and spread efficiently in the lung xenografts with the epithelial cells as the main target, caused severe lung damage, and induced a robust pro-inflammatory response. IFN-&#945; treatment effectively inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication in the lung xenografts. Conclusions: These data support the human lung xenograft mouse model as a useful and biological relevant tool that should facilitate studies on the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 lung infection and the evaluation of potential antiviral therapies.","Fu, Wenkun; Wang, Wei; Yuan, Lunzhi; Lin, Yanzhen; Huang, Xiumin; Chen, Rirong; Cai, Minping; Liu, Che; Chen, Liqiang; Zhou, Ming; Wu, Kun; Zhao, Huan; Pan, Dequan; Ma, Jian; Hong, Junping; Zhai, Bingke; Zhang, Yali; Kong, Zhibo; Wang, Yingbin; Chen, Yixin; Yuan, Quan; Zhu, Huachen; Cheng, Tong; Guan, Yi; Xia, Ningshao",Theranostics,417,16

Enforced social distancing and school closures made technology-enhanced education a reality on an unprecedented scale for the first time in history. Various information and communication technologies provide a solution to the global education crisis. The author revisits the landmark 1972 Faure report to remind us that recognizing fast technological development was the background of the learning society proposal. Technology always brings about a profound challenge in education. The concept of a learning society has paved the unavoidable direction of educational change from universal schooling to lifelong learning. While there are different understandings of lifelong learning and learning society, the author points out that we are indeed in the middle of the second educational revolution heading toward the lifelong learning era. The author argues that we need to take advantage of the COVID-19 pandemic to make creative and imaginative policy proposals, which can accelerate the realization of the learning society. © The Author(s) 2021.","Kang, D.

Following FDA emergency use approval, widespread distribution of vaccines has resulted in rapid reduction in COVID-19 cases in vulnerable, older populations. Yet, vaccination coverage remains incomplete amongst residents and healthcare workers. As such, mitigation and prevention strategies are needed to reduce the ongoing risk of transmission and mortality amongst vulnerable, nursing home populations. One such strategy is that of shield immunity, in which recovered individuals increase their contact rates and therefore shield individuals who remain susceptible to infection. Here, we adapt recent population-scale shield immunity models to a network context. To do so, we evaluate network-based shield immunity by evaluating how restructured interactions in a bipartite network (e.g., between healthcare workers and long-term care residents) affects SARS-CoV-2 epidemic dynamics. First, we identify a series of rewiring principles that leverage viral testing, antibody testing, and vaccination information to reassign immunized healthcare workers to care for infected residents while retaining workload balance amidst an outbreak. We find a significant reduction in outbreak size when using infection and immune-based cohorting as a weekly intervention. Second, we also identify a preventative strategy using shield-immunity rewiring principles, by assigning susceptible healthcare workers to care for cohorts of immunized residents; this strategy reduces the risk that an inadvertent introduction of SARS-CoV-2 into the facility via a healthcare worker spreads to susceptible residents. Network-based epidemic modeling reveals that preventative rewiring can control the size of outbreaks at levels similar to that of isolation of infectious healthcare workers. Overall, this assessment of shield immunity provides further support for leveraging infection and immune status in network-based interventions to control and prevent the spread of COVID-19.","Lucia-Sanz, Adriana; Magalie, Andreea; Rodriguez-Gonzalez, Rogelio; Leung, Chung-Yin; Weitz, Joshua S",,417,0

The clinical best care practices (CBPs) of hand hygiene, hygiene and sanitation, screening, and basic and additional precautions aim to reduce this burden. The COVID-19 pandemic has confirmed these four CBPs are critically important prevention practices that limit the spread of HCAIs. This paper conducted a systematic review of economic evaluations related to these four CBPs using a discounting approach. We searched for articles published between 2000 and 2019. We included economic evaluations of infection prevention and control of Clostridioides difficile-associated diarrhoea, meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, and carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacilli. Results were analysed with cost-minimization, cost-effectiveness, cost-utility, cost-benefit and cost-consequence analyses. Articles were assessed for quality. A total of 11,898 articles were screened and seven were included. Most studies (4/7) were of overall moderate quality. All studies demonstrated cost effectiveness of CBPs. The average yearly net cost savings from the CBPs ranged from $252,847 (2019 Canadian dollars) to $1,691,823, depending on the rate of discount (3% and 8%). The average incremental benefit cost ratio of CBPs varied from 2.48 to 7.66.

In response, telerehabilitation (TR) has emerged as alternative care model. Aims were: (1) to describe baseline patient characteristics and available unadjusted outcomes for episodes of care administered during COVID-19 using TR versus traditional in-person care, and (2) to describe TR frequency levels by condition and telecommunication modes. METHODS: A descriptive retrospective observational design was used to report patient variables and outcomes including physical function, number of visits, and patient satisfaction, by TR frequency (few, most, or all visits) and telecommunication modes. Standardized differences were used to compare baseline characteristics between episodes with and without TR. RESULTS: Sample consisted of 222,680 patients (59% female; mean [SD] age = 55 [18] years). Overall TR rate was 6% decreasing from 10% to 5% between second and third quarters of 2020. Outcome measures were available for 90% to 100% of episodes. Thirty-seven percent of clinicians administered care via TR. Patients treated using TR compared with in-person care were more likely to be younger and live in large metropolitan areas. From those with TR, 55%, 20%, and 25% had TR during few, most, or all visits, respectively. TR care was administered equally across orthopedic body parts, with lower use for nonorthopedic conditions such as stroke, edema, and vestibular dysfunction. TR was primarily administered using synchronous (video or audio) modes. The rate of patients reported being very satisfied with their treatment results was 3% higher for no TR compared with TR. CONCLUSIONS: These results provide new knowledge about to whom and how TR is being administered during the pandemic in outpatient rehabilitation practices throughout the United States. The database assessed was found to be suitable for conducting studies on associations between TR and diverse outcome measures, controlling for a comprehensive set of patient characteristics, to advance best TR care models, and promote high-quality care. IMPACT: This study provided detailed and robust descriptive information using an existing national patient database containing patient health and demographic characteristics, outcome measures, and telerehabilitation (TR) administration data. Findings support the feasibility to conduct future studies on associations between TR care and patient outcomes, adjusting for a wide range of patient characteristics and clinical setting factors that may be associated with the probability of receiving TR. The finding of limited and decreasing use of TR over the study period calls for studies aimed to better understand facilitators and inhibitors of TR use by rehabilitation therapists during everyday practice to promote its use when clinically appropriate.","Werneke, Mark W; Deutscher, Daniel; Grigsby, David; Tucker, Carole A; Mioduski, Jerome E; Hayes, Deanna",Phys. ther,417,22

Clinical characteristics of delta (B.1.617.2) VOC are not well reported. To compare demographic, clinical and laboratory features and outcomes in the second Covid-19 wave in India (delta VOC) with the previous wave we performed a registry-based study. MethodsSuccessive SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) confirmed Covid-19 patients presenting to our Advanced Covid Care hospital were prospectively recruited. In the first phase (wave) from March-December 2020, 1395 of 7476 (18.7%) suspected patients tested positive and 863 (61.89%) hospitalized, while in second wave from January-July 2021 out of 1641 confirmed cases out of 8680 (19.4%) suspected 388 (23.6%) were hospitalized. Details of clinical and laboratory features at admission to hospital, management and outcomes in the two waves have been compared. ResultsIn both cohorts, majority were men and 20% less than 40 years. Prevalence of hypertension, diabetes and cardiovascular diseases was more than 20%. Second wave patients had similar pre-hospitalization symptom duration but had significantly greater cough, fever and shortness of breath and lower SpO2 at presentation with greater lymphopenia, C-reactive proteins, interleukin-6, ferritin, lactic dehydrogenase and transaminases. In the second vs first wave patients, requirement of supplementary oxygen (47.9% vs 34.3%), prone positioning (89.2 vs 38.6%), high flow nasal oxygen(15.7 vs 9.1%), non-invasive ventilation (14.4 vs 9.5%), invasive ventilation (16.2 vs 9.5%), steroids (94.1 vs 85.9%), remdesivir (91.2 vs 76.0%) and anticoagulants (94.3 vs 76.0%) was greater (p<0.001). Median (IQR) length of stay [8 (6-10) vs 7 (5-10) days] as well as ICU stay [9 (5-13) vs 6 (2-10) days] was more in second wave (p<0.001). In-hospital deaths occurred in 173 patients (13.9%) and were significantly more in the second wave, 75 (19.3%), compared to the first, 98 (11.5%); unadjusted odds ratio (95% CI) 1.84 (1.32-2.55) which did not change significantly with adjustment for age and sex (2.03, 1.44-2.86), and age, sex and comorbidities (2.09, 1.47-2.95). Greater disease severity at presentation was associated with mortality in both the waves. ConclusionsCovid-19 patients hospitalized during the second wave of the epidemic (delta variant) had more severe disease with greater dyspnea, hypoxia, hematological and biochemical abnormalities compared to first wave patients. They had greater length of stay in intensive care unit, oxygen requirement, non-invasive and invasive ventilatory support.

Univariable and multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression analyses were performed for the association between 25(OH)D and COVID-19 death, and Poisson regression analyses for the association between 25(OH)D and severe COVID-19 infection. RESULTS: Complete data were available for 341,484 UK Biobank participants, of which 656 had inpatient confirmed COVID-19 infection and 203 died of COVID-19 infection. 25(OH)D concentration was associated with severe COVID-19 infection and mortality univariably (mortality per 10 nmol/L 25(OH)D HR 0.92; 95% CI 0.86-0.98; p = 0.016), but not after adjustment for confounders (mortality per 10 nmol/L 25(OH)D HR 0.98; 95% CI = 0.91-1.06; p = 0.696). Vitamin D insufficiency or deficiency was also not independently associated with either COVID-19 infection or linked mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings do not support a potential link between 25(OH)D concentrations and risk of severe COVID-19 infection and mortality. Randomised trials are needed to prove a beneficial role for vitamin D in the prevention of severe COVID-19 reactions or death.","Hastie, Claire E; Pell, Jill P; Sattar, Naveed",Eur. j. nutr,417,16

The Chest Computed Tomography (CT) scans are the most valuable materials to diagnose the COVID-19 symptoms. However, most schemes for COVID-19 classification of Chest CT scan is based on a single-slice level, implying that the most critical CT slice should be selected from the original CT scan volume manually. We simultaneously propose 2-D and 3-D models to predict the COVID-19 of CT scan to tickle this issue. In our 2-D model, we introduce the Deep Wilcoxon signed-rank test (DWCC) to determine the importance of each slice of a CT scan to overcome the issue mentioned previously. Furthermore, a Convolutional CT scan-Aware Transformer (CCAT) is proposed to discover the context of the slices fully. The frame-level feature is extracted from each CT slice based on any backbone network and followed by feeding the features to our within-slice-Transformer (WST) to discover the context information in the pixel dimension. The proposed Between-Slice-Transformer (BST) is used to aggregate the extracted spatial-context features of every CT slice. A simple classifier is then used to judge whether the Spatio-temporal features are COVID-19 or non-COVID-19. The extensive experiments demonstrated that the proposed CCAT and DWCC significantly outperform the state-of-the-art methods.","Hsu, Chih-Chung; Chen, Guan-Lin; Wu, Mei-Hsuan",,417,16

Resolving conflicts with conspecifics over valuable resources is an essential task for animals, and this takes an unusual form in mantis shrimp due to their powerful raptorial appendages. Decades of field and laboratory research have provided key insights into the natural agonistic interactions of diverse mantis shrimp species, including how they use their raptorial weapons against one another in telson sparring matches over cavities. These insights provided the foundation for functional morphologists, biomechanists, and engineers to work through different levels of organization: from the kinematics of how the appendages move, to the elastic mechanisms that power the strike, and down to the structure, composition, and material properties that transmit and protect against high-impact forces. Completing this narrative are studies on the defensive telson and how this structure is biomechanically matched to the weapon and the role it plays in ritualized fighting. The biomechanical understanding of the weapon and defense in mantis shrimp has, in turn, enabled a better understanding of whether mantis shrimp assess one another during contests and encouraged questions of evolutionary drivers on both the arsenal and behavior. Altogether, the body of research focused on mantis shrimp has presented perhaps the most comprehensive understanding of fighting, weapons, and defenses among crustaceans, from morphology and biomechanics to behavior and evolution. While this multi-level analysis of ritualized fighting in mantis shrimp is comprehensive, we implore the need to include additional levels of analysis to obtain a truly holistic understanding of this and other crustacean agonistic interactions. Specifically, both molting and environmental conditions are often missing from the narrative, yet they greatly affect crustacean weapons, defenses, and behavior. Applying this approach more broadly would generate a similarly profound understanding of how crustaceans carry out a variety of important tasks in diverse habitats.","deVries, Maya S; Lowder, Kaitlyn B; Taylor, Jennifer R A",Integr. comp. biol,417,22

Data regarding stress levels, sleep time, exercise, and total diet, snack, and prepared food intake were obtained from the questionnaires. The changes in the body weight or HbA1c levels were determined by comparing the values at the time the questionnaire was administered to those noted 3 months ago. Increased levels of stress and decreased exercise levels were reported in approximately 40% and >50%. During the COVID-19 pandemic. There was a negative correlation between stress and exercise (r = -0.285, p < 0.001) and a positive correlation between stress and prepared food intake (r = 0.193, p = 0.009). Decreased exercise levels (r = -0.33, p < 0.001) and increased snack consumption (r = 0.24, p = 0.002) were associated with increased body weight. Furthermore, increased total diet intake (r = 0.16, p = 0.031) was associated with increased HbA1c levels.

The coronavirus spike (S) protein, which facilitates viral attachment, entry and membrane fusion is heavily glycosylated and plays a critical role in the elicitation of the host immune response. The spike protein is comprised of two protein subunits (S1 and S2), which together possess 22 potential N-glycosylation sites. Herein, we report the glycosylation mapping on spike protein subunits S1 and S2 expressed on human cells through high-resolution mass spectrometry. We have characterized the quantitative N-glycosylation profile on spike protein and interestingly, observed unexpected O-glycosylation modifications on the receptor-binding domain of spike protein subunit S1. Even though O-glycosylation has been predicted on the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, this is the first report of experimental data for both the site of O-glycosylation and identity of the O-glycans attached on the subunit S1. Our data on the N- and O-glycosylation are strengthened by extensive manual interpretation of each glycopeptide spectra in addition to using bioinformatics tools to confirm the complexity of glycosylation in the spike protein. The elucidation of the glycan repertoire on the spike protein provides insights into the viral binding studies and more importantly, propels research toward the development of a suitable vaccine candidate.","Shajahan, Asif; Supekar, Nitin T; Gleinich, Anne S; Azadi, Parastoo",Glycobiology,417,26

Our laboratory demonstrated the presence of circulating exosomes with lung self-antigens (Collagen-V and K-α Tubulin) and donor HLA in lung transplant recipients (LTxRs) undergoing rejection. Since respiratory viral infections (RVI) is a risk factor for development of chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD) post lung transplant, we postulated that RVI can lead to induction of exosomes with self-antigens containing viral DNA/RNA capable of activating innate immune signaling via cGAS/STING and RIG1 pathways, a mechanism leading to immune activation resulting in CLAD. Methods: Exosomes were isolated using ultracentrifugation. Size (50-200nm) was determined using nanosight. DNA and RNA were isolated using kits and quantified on the Nanodrop. Libraries were generated using Kapa Biosystem's library kit. The raw Illumina 2x150bp pair-end reads were checked on FastQC and were aligned to the human and viral genome build from CHIPseeker Database. Validation was done using antibodies and primers for respiratory syncytial virus, coronavirus, and rhinovirus. To determine the role of exosomes to induce cell signaling and endoplasmic stress (ER), airway epithelial cells (KCC266), and Hep2 cells were incubated with exosomes from LTxRs with RVI or stable. Results: Viral nucleic acid sequences were noted in higher levels in exosomes from LTxRs with RVI in comparison to stable. Comparison with human genome identified the presence of DNA sequences specific to defensins, GTPase, apoptotic cleavage, and NMDA receptor in RVI LTxRs. Further, we identified upregulation of proteins associated with cGAS/STING and RIG1 (MAVS, MDA5, IFNβ) and ER stress (PERK, ATF4 and BiP) in KCC266 and Hep2 cells incubated with exosomes from LTxRs with RVI, but not stable. In contrast, exosomes from stable LTxRs had 91 sequences for MAP kinase and cell death signaling pathways. Conclusion: We conclude that LTxRs diagnosed with RVI leads to induction of circulating exosomes having unique viral nucleic acid sequences capable of inducing signaling and ER stress. This can lead to activate innate immune signaling via cGAS/STING and RIG1 pathways resulting in immune responses to viral and donor antigens resulting in CLAD.","Bansal, S.; Limaye, A.; Bharat, A.; Bremner, R.; Smith, M.; Omar, A.; Mohanakumar, T.",J.

Previously, researchers had developed a pseudotyped virus system for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, based on HIV-1 core, bearing virus spike protein. During the development of a pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 system, a eukaryotic expression plasmid expressing SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein was constructed and then co-transfected with HIV-1 based plasmid which containing the firefly luciferase reporter gene, into HEK293T cells to prepare the pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 virus (ppSARS-2). We have successfully established the pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 system for neutralization and entry inhibition assays. Huh7.5 cell line was found to be the most susceptible to our pseudotyped virus model. Different levels of neutralizing antibodies were detected in convalescent serum samples of COVID-19 patients using ppSARS-2. The recombinant, soluble, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 protein was found to inhibit the entry of ppSARS-2 in Huh7.5 cells effectively. Furthermore, the neutralization results for ppSARS-2 were consistent with those of live SARS-CoV-2 and determined using the serum samples from convalescent patients. In conclusion, we have developed an easily accessible and reliable tool for studying the neutralizing efficiency of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and the entry process of the virus in a BSL-2 laboratory.","Yang, Ren; Huang, Baoying; Ruhan, A; Li, Wenhui; Wang, Wenling; Deng, Yao; Tan, Wenjie",,417,25

But in the intervening century, public health at all levels has remained, as Marc Lalonde put it in 1988, the ""poor cousin"" in the health care system (Lalonde 1988, p. 77). Punctuated by sporadic investment during infectious disease crises, such as polio in the early 1950s, public health is less of a priority as the cost of tertiary health interventions rises. While public health potentially involves a broad range of interventions, this paper focuses on the history of public health interventions around infectious disease. COVID-19 has forced us to relearn the importance of maintaining basic infectious/communicable disease control capacity and revealed the cost of our failure to do so. It has also drawn our attention to the intersection between social inequality, racism, and colonialism and vulnerability to disease. In addition to investing in our capacity to contain disease outbreaks as they occur, we must plan now for how to achieve greater health equity in the future by addressing underlying economic and social conditions and providing meaningful access to preventive care for all. This is how we build a truly resilient society. Governments at all levels have recognized the importance of social factors in shaping health and illness for decades. But greater health equity will result only from genuine action on this knowledge. Action will arise from public advocacy in support of prevention, and a new level of engagement and collaboration between affected individuals and communities, public health experts, and governments.","Jones, E.; MacDougall, H.; Monnais, L.; Hanley, J.; Carstairs, C.",Facets,417,10

To increase accessibility to online content, subtitles are sometimes added to videos, but this may come at a cost. Not only is the addition of subtitles an extra source of information to be processed, the type of subtitle may differ (automatic or standardised) and subtitles are in competition with other sources of information that also need to be processed. This can result in subtitles becoming redundant, failing to contribute to accessibility at all. This study was conducted to determine how the processing of subtitles was influenced by redundant information (graphs, tables, etc.) on the screen, using eye-tracking data. Two different types of subtitles, automatic and standardised, were also used. Findings indicated that the standardised subtitles were 45% more likely to be processed than the automatic subtitles and that both types of subtitles were 24% less likely to be processed with redundant information.

Setting & Participants: 22 COVID-19 infections were diagnosed in our cohort of 1,200 kidney transplant recipients. Results: Most common initial symptoms included fever, cough, or dyspnea. 18 (82%) patients required hospitalization. Of those patients, 3 had everolimus-based immunosuppression. Computed tomography of the chest at admission (performed in 15 patients) showed mild (n = 3), moderate (n = 8), extensive (n = 1), severe (n = 2), and critical (n = 1) involvement. Immunosuppression reduction was initiated in all patients. Hydroxychloroquine was administered to 15 patients. 11 patients required supplemental oxygen; 2 of them were admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) with mechanical ventilation. After a median of 10 days, 13 kidney transplant recipients were discharged, 2 were hospitalized in non-ICU units, 1 was in the ICU, and 2 patients had died. Limitations: Small sample size and short follow-up. Conclusions: The clinical presentation of COVID-19 infection was similar to that reported in the general population. A standard strategy of immunosuppression minimization and treatment was applied, with 11% mortality among kidney transplant recipients hospitalized with COVID-19 infection.","Devresse, Arnaud; Belkhir, Leila; Vo, Bernard; Ghaye, Benoit; Scohy, Anaïs; Kabamba, Benoit; Goffin, Eric; De Greef, Julien; Mourad, Michel; De Meyer, Martine; Yombi, Jean-Cyr; Kanaan, Nada",Kidney Med.,417,23

Laparoscopic surgery generates end products that can have potentially harmful effects for the surgical team from short- or long-time exposure. In view of the current SARS-CoV-2 circumstances, controversy has risen concerning the safety of surgical smoke (SS) and aerosols and the perception of an increased risk of exposure during laparoscopic surgery. Methods. The present qualitative systematic review was conducted according to Meta-Analyses and Systematic Reviews of Observational Studies (MOOSE). A literature search was performed from March 2020 up to May 10, 2020, using the PubMed database, Cochrane, and Google Scholar to assess the risk of airborne transmission of viruses and the potential health risk of surgical smoke- and aerosol-generating procedures produced during laparoscopic surgery. The keywords were introduced in combination to obtain better search results. Application of the inclusion and exclusion criteria identified 44 relevant articles. Results. Genetic material from certain viruses, or the virus itself, has been detected in SS and aerosols. However, in the current SARS-CoV-2, as in other coronavirus situations, studies analyzing the presence of airborne transmission of viruses in surgical smoke are lacking. Conclusion. Despite the lack of clear evidence regarding the risk of diseases as the result of smoke- and aerosol-generating procedures during laparoscopic surgery, further investigation is needed. Meanwhile, all available precautions must be taken.","Pasquier, Jorge; Villalta, Oscar; Sarria Lamorú, Sunaymy; Balagué, Carmen; Vilallonga, Ramon; Targarona, Eduardo M",Surg Innov,417,9

Here, we measured FL-Gal9, FL-OPN, Tr-Gal9, and Ud-OPN in 94 plasma samples obtained from 23 COVID-19-infected patients with mild clinical symptoms (CV), 25 COVID-19 patients associated with pneumonia (CP), and 14 patients with bacterial infection (ID). The four proteins were significantly elevated in the CP group when compared with healthy individuals. ROC analysis between the CV and CP groups showed that C-reactive protein had the highest ability to differentiate, followed by Tr-Gal9 and ferritin. Spearman's correlation analysis showed that Tr-Gal9 and Ud-OPN but not FL-Gal9 and FL-OPN, had a significant association with laboratory markers for lung function, inflammation, coagulopathy, and kidney function in CP patients. CP patients treated with tocilizumab had reduced levels of FL-Gal9, Tr-Gal9, and Ud-OPN. It was suggested that OPN is cleaved by interleukin-6-dependent proteases. These findings suggest that the cleaved forms of OPN and galectin-9 can be used to monitor the severity of pathological inflammation and the therapeutic effects of tocilizumab in CP patients.","Bai, Gaowa; Furushima, Daisuke; Niki, Toshiro; Matsuba, Takashi; Maeda, Yosuke; Takahashi, Atsushi; Hattori, Toshio; Ashino, Yugo",Int. j. mol. sci.

However, the pathophysiology of severe COVID-19 infection is poorly understood. Previous studies established clinical and biological phenotypes among classical ARDS cohorts, with important therapeutic implications. The phenotypic profile of COVID-19 associated ARDS remains unknown. Methods: We used latent class modeling via a multivariate mixture model to identify phenotypes from clinical and biochemical data collected from 263 patients admitted to Massachusetts General Hospital intensive care unit with COVID-19-associated ARDS between March 13 and August 2, 2020. Findings: We identified two distinct phenotypes of COVID-19-associated ARDS, with substantial differences in biochemical profiles despite minimal differences in respiratory dynamics. The minority phenotype (class 2, n = 70, 26·6%) demonstrated increased markers of coagulopathy, with mild relative hyper-inflammation and dramatically increased markers of end-organ dysfunction (e.g., creatinine, troponin). The odds of 28-day mortality among the class 2 phenotype was more than double that of the class 1 phenotype (40·0% vs.· 23·3%, OR = 2·2, 95% CI [1·2, 3·9]). Interpretation: We identified distinct phenotypic profiles in COVID-19 associated ARDS, with little variation according to respiratory physiology but with important variation according to systemic and extra-pulmonary markers. Phenotypic identity was highly associated with short-term mortality. The class 2 phenotype exhibited prominent signatures of coagulopathy, suggesting that vascular dysfunction may play an important role in the clinical progression of severe COVID-19-related disease.","Ranjeva, Sylvia; Pinciroli, Riccardo; Hodell, Evan; Mueller, Ariel; Hardin, C Corey; Thompson, B Taylor; Berra, Lorenzo",EClinicalMedicine,417,16

However, the use of carbon-based materials like carbon dots and other forms of carbon has not only helped in increasing the protection levels in human life but also provided greater security and freedom for people to carry out day-to-day activities without any fear of being infected by the virus. The application of graphene-based materials for making unique face masks and germ trap technologies is presented. Nano-compounds blended with hand sanitizers have played an active role in the control of coronavirus along with soap-based liquids that are used for handwashing. Some of the Nano-materials like gold nanoparticles are extensively used in the making of detection devices like RT-PCR, etc. The use of Nano-polymer coatings has created a safe environment for users by preventing the spread of coronavirus through surfaces.

Containing the virus has proven difficult, in large part due to its high transmissibility during the pre-symptomatic incubation. The study's aim was to determine if changes in respiratory rate could serve as a leading indicator of SARS-CoV-2 infections. A total of 271 individuals (age = 37.3 ± 9.5, 190 male, 81 female) who experienced symptoms consistent with COVID-19 were included- 81 tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and 190 tested negative; these 271 individuals collectively contributed 2672 samples (days) of data (1856 healthy days, 231 while infected with COVID-19 and 585 while negative for COVID-19 but experiencing symptoms). To train a novel algorithm, individuals were segmented as follows; (1) a training dataset of individuals who tested positive for COVID-19 (n = 57 people, 537 samples); (2) a validation dataset of individuals who tested positive for COVID-19 (n = 24 people, 320 samples); (3) a validation dataset of individuals who tested negative for COVID-19 (n = 190 people, 1815 samples). All data was extracted from the WHOOP system, which uses data from a wrist-worn strap to produce validated estimates of respiratory rate and other physiological measures. Using the training dataset, a model was developed to estimate the probability of SARS-CoV-2 infection based on changes in respiratory rate during night-time sleep. The model's ability to identify COVID-positive individuals not used in training and robustness against COVID-negative individuals with similar symptoms were examined for a critical six-day period spanning the onset of symptoms. The model identified 20% of COVID-19 positive individuals in the validation dataset in the two days prior to symptom onset, and 80% of COVID-19 positive cases by the third day of symptoms.","Miller, Dean J; Capodilupo, John V; Lastella, Michele; Sargent, Charli; Roach, Gregory D; Lee, Victoria H; Capodilupo, Emily R",PLoS One,417,30

DESIGN: Open label, parallel arm, phase II, multicentre, randomised controlled trial. SETTING: 39 public and private hospitals across India. PARTICIPANTS: 464 adults (&#8805;18 years) admitted to hospital (screened 22 April to 14 July 2020) with confirmed moderate covid-19 (partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood/fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2) ratio between 200 mm Hg and 300 mm Hg or a respiratory rate of more than 24/min with oxygen saturation 93% or less on room air): 235 were assigned to convalescent plasma with best standard of care (intervention arm) and 229 to best standard of care only (control arm). INTERVENTIONS: Participants in the intervention arm received two doses of 200 mL convalescent plasma, transfused 24 hours apart. The presence and levels of neutralising antibodies were not measured a priori; stored samples were assayed at the end of the study. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Composite of progression to severe disease (PaO2/FiO2 <100 mm Hg) or all cause mortality at 28 days post-enrolment. RESULTS: Progression to severe disease or all cause mortality at 28 days after enrolment occurred in 44 (19%) participants in the intervention arm and 41 (18%) in the control arm (risk difference 0.008 (95% confidence interval -0.062 to 0.078); risk ratio 1.04, 95% confidence interval 0.71 to 1.54). CONCLUSION: Convalescent plasma was not associated with a reduction in progression to severe covid-19 or all cause mortality.

However, the impact of unprecedented situation of COVID-19 outbreak on healthcare of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients in real-world setting has seldom been investigated. METHODS: We performed an observational study in a tertiary referral IBD center in China. The mode of healthcare and medication use was compared before and after COVID-19 outbreak. Electronic questionnaire surveys were performed amongst gastroenterologists and IBD patients to investigate impact of COVID-19 outbreak on their attitudes towards telemedicine. RESULTS: COVID-19 outbreak resulted in substantial decrease of patients participating in standard face-to-face visit during one month post-outbreak (n=51) than pre-outbreak (n=249), whereas the participation in telemedicine was significantly higher than comparable period in 2019 (414 vs 93).

Methods: All patients who underwent telemedicine visits at one urban academic medical center between March 2020 and June 2020 were included. All departments were included including surgical and nonsurgical. Demographic data, primary language, and visit type were collected. Primary zip code was used as surrogate for socioeconomic status through use of the zip code median household income. The demographics of the New York metropolitan area were obtained through the U.S. Census Bureau and used as a control cohort. Results: A total of 362,413 telemedicine visits met inclusion criteria with the majority of visits performed in April and May; 127,851 (35.3%) and 110,166 (30.4%), respectively. The highest performing department was Internal Medicine, which performed 72,796 visits or 20% of the total cohort. In our cohort of telemedicine patients, 59.6% identified as White, 11.4% as Black, and 5.7% as Asian. This is less diverse than the overall population of the metropolitan area, which is 17.5% Black and 11.5% Asian.

In a multiple linear regression adjusted for individual characteristics, comorbidities, previous COVID-19 infection and duration since second vaccine dose, diabetics had 13.86 BAU/ml (95%CI: -27.08 to -0.64BAU/ml, p=0.041) less IgG antibodies and 4.42% (95%CI: -8.53 to -0.32%, p=0.036) less neutralizing antibodies than non-diabetics. Hypertension and obesity did not show significant changes in antibody titers. Taken together, both type-2 diabetic and non-diabetic individuals elicited strong immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine; nonetheless, lower levels were seen in people with diabetes. Continuous monitoring of the antibody levels might be a good indicator to guide personalized needs for further booster shots to maintain adaptive immunity.","Ali, Hamad; Al-Terki, Abdulmohsen; Sindhu, Sardar; Alahmad, Barrak; Hammad, Maha; Al-Sabah, Salman; Alghounaim, Mohammad; Jamal, Mohammad H.; Aldei, Ali; Mairza, Mohammad J.; Husain, Maitham; Devarajan, Sriraman; Ahmad, Rasheed; Cherian, Preethi; Alkhairi, Irina; Alkandari, Abdullah; Abubaker, Jehad; Abu-farha, Mohamed; Al-Mulla, Fahd",,417,16

Impact of on-campus activities suspension on pharmacy education during COVID-19 lockdown – A students’ perspective,17.2125,3.2552333,2020,"BackgroundThe second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic hit India from early April 2021 to June 2021 and more than 400,000 cases per day were reported in the country. We describe the clinical features, demography, treatment trends, baseline laboratory parameters of a cohort of patients admitted at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi with SARS-CoV-2 infection and their association with the outcome. MethodsThis was a retrospective cohort study describing the clinical, laboratory and treatment patterns of consecutive patients admitted with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Multivariate logistic regression models were fitted to identify the clinical and biochemical predictors of developing hypoxia, deterioration during the hospital stay and death. FindingsA total of 2080 patients were included in the study. The case fatality rate was 19.5%. Amongst the survivors, the median duration of hospital stay was 8 (5-11) days. Out of 853 (42.3%%) of patients who had COVID-19 Acute respiratory distress syndrome at presentation, 340 (39.9%) died. Patients aged 45-60 years [OR (95% CI): 1.8 (1.2-2.6)p =0.003] and those aged >60 years [OR (95%CI): 3.4 (2.3-5.2), p<0.001] had a higher odds of death as compared to the 18-44 age group. Vaccination reduced the odds of death by 30% [OR (95% CI): 0.7 (0.5-0.9), p=0.036]. Patients with hyper inflammation at baseline as suggested by leucocytosis [OR (95% CI): 2.1 (1.4-3.10), p <0.001], raised d-dimer >500 mg/dL [OR (95% CI): 3.2 (2.2-4.6), p <0.001] and raised C-reactive peptide >0.5 mg/L [OR (95% CI): 3.8 (1.1-13), p=0.037] had higher odds of death. Patients who were admitted in the second week had lower odds of death and those admitted in the third week had higher odds of death. InterpretationThis is the largest cohort of patients admitted with COVID-19 from India reported to date and has shown that vaccination status and early admission during the inflammatory phase can change the course of illness of these patients. Strategies should be made to improve vaccination rates and early admission of patients with moderate and severe COVID-19 to improve outcomes. Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSThe COVID-19 pandemic has been ravaging the world since December 2019 and the cases in various regions are being reported in waves. We found that the case fatality rates ranging from 1.4% to 28.3% have been reported in the first wave in India. Older age and the presence of comorbidities are known predictors of mortality. There are no reports regarding the effectiveness of vaccination, correlation of mortality with the timing of admission to the health care facility and inflammatory markers in the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in India. Added-value of this studyThis study reports the real-world situation where patients get admitted at varying time points of their illness due to the mismatch between the availability of hospital beds and the rising number of COVID-19 patients during the pandemic. It reports the odds of developing severe hypoxia necessitating oxygen therapy and death thus helping identify priority groups for admission. Implications of all the available evidenceThis study found increased odds of requiring oxygen support or death in patients older than 45 years of age, with comorbidities, and those who had hyper-inflammation with raised C-reactive peptide, d-dimer or leukocytosis. Patients who were admitted in the second week of illness had lower odds of death as compared to those admitted in the third week implying that treatment with corticosteroids in the second week of the illness during the inflammatory phase could lead to reduced mortality. These findings would help triage patients and provide guidance for developing admission policy during times where hospital beds are scarce. Vaccination was found to reduce the odds of deterioration or death and should be fast-tracked to prevent further waves of the pandemic.","Elavarasi, Arunmozhimaran; Sagiraju, Hari Krishna Raju; Garg, Rohit Kumar; Paul, Saurav Sekhar; Ratre, Brajesh; Sirohiya, Prashant; Gupta, Nishkarsh; Garg, Rakesh; Pandit, Anuja; Vig, Saurabh; Singh, Ram; Kumar, Balbir; Meena, Ved Prakash; Wig, Naveet; Mittal, Saurabh; Pahuja, Sourabh; Madan, Karan; Dwivedi, Tanima; Das, Nupur; Gupta, Ritu; Vidyarthi, Ashima Jain; Das, Arghya; Chaudhry, Rama; Wundavalli, Laxmitej; Singh, Angel Rajan; Singh, Sheetal; Pandey, Manisha; Mishra, Abhinav; Matharoo, Karanvir Singh; Kumar, Sunil; Mohan, Anant; Guleria, Randeep; Bhatnagar, Sushma",,417,16

Recent initiatives have demonstrated that segmentation models trained with FL can achieve performance similar to locally trained models. However, FL is not a fully privacy-preserving technique and privacy-centred attacks can disclose confidential patient data. Thus, supplementing FL with privacy-enhancing technologies (PTs) such as differential privacy (DP) is a requirement for clinical applications in a multi-institutional setting. The application of PTs to FL in medical imaging and the trade-offs between privacy guarantees and model utility, the ramifications on training performance and the susceptibility of the final models to attacks have not yet been conclusively investigated. Here we demonstrate the first application of differentially private gradient descent-based FL on the task of semantic segmentation in computed tomography. We find that high segmentation performance is possible under strong privacy guarantees with an acceptable training time penalty. We furthermore demonstrate the first successful gradient-based model inversion attack on a semantic segmentation model and show that the application of DP prevents it from divulging sensitive image features.","Ziller, Alexander; Usynin, Dmitrii; Remerscheid, Nicolas; Knolle, Moritz; Makowski, Marcus; Braren, Rickmer; Rueckert, Daniel; Kaissis, Georgios",,417,1

METHOD: a scoping review was undertaken by searching seven databases and hand-searching grey literature to maximise coverage of potential studies. RESULTS: Twenty-three studies met the inclusion criteria. Three PFA training models were commonly used in research studies. A broad selection of PFA training outcomes were observed including learning, behavior, satisfaction and practice in crisis mental and behavior health preparedness. CONCLUSIONS: Research evidence of reasonable quality demonstrates that PFA training significantly improves knowledge of appropriate psychosocial response and PFA skills in supporting people in acute distress, thereby enhancing self-efficacy and promoting resilience. However, this review highlights inadequate guidance on how PFA training should be applied and adapted, significant shortcomings of reporting PFA training delivery, limited training evaluation and unclear training outcomes. Whilst behavioral, knowledge and system impact of the PFA training are promising, methodologically stronger evaluations which include systematic training adaptation and selection of sensitive outcome measures is needed to strengthen future implementation of PFA training and thereby enhance population preparedness for future emergencies.","Wang, Ling; Norman, Ian; Xiao, Tao; Li, Yamin; Leamy, Mary",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),417,0

So, far, millions of people are infected with the virus across the length and breadth of the world with thousand losing their lives each passing day. The WHO in February 2020 classified the virus as a coronavirus and the name Coronavirus-19 (CoV-19) was offered to the virus. The disease caused by the virus was termed coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19). The pathogenesis of COVID-19 is associated with elevation of several immune plays as well as inflammatory factors which contributes to cytokine storms. Currently, the detection of CoV-19 RNA is through reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are capable of suppressing several kinds of cytokines via the paracrine secretion system. Therefore, MSCs therapy could be game charges in the treatment of the current COVID-19 pandemic. Also, intravenous IG may be capable of suppressing the high expression of IL-6 by the CoV-19 resulting in lessen disease burden. Anti-inflammatory medications like, corticosteroids, tocilizumab, glycyrrhetinic acid, as well as etoposide may be very advantageous in decreasing the COVID-19 burden because, their mode of action targets the cytokine storms initiated by the CoV-19. It is important to indicate that, these medication does not target the virus itself. Therefore, potent CoV-19 anti-viral medications are needed to completely cure patients with COVID-19. Also, a vaccine is urgently needed to stop the spread of the virus. This review therefore elucidates the immune players in the management of COVID-19; focusing principally on MSCs and inflammatory mediators.","Richard, Seidu A; Kampo, Sylvanus; Sackey, Marian; Hechavarria, Maite Esquijarosa; Buunaaim, Alexis D B; Kuugbee, Eugene Dogkotenge; Anabah, Thomas Winsum",Current stem cell research &amp; therapy (Online),417,26

The most severely affected patients are older men, individuals of black and Asian minority ethnicity and those with comorbidities. COVID-19 is also associated with an increased risk of hypercoagulability and venous thromboembolism. The overwhelming majority of patients admitted to hospital have respiratory failure and while most are managed on general wards, a sizeable proportion require intensive care support. The long-term complications of COVID-19 pneumonia are starting to emerge but data from previous coronavirus outbreaks such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) suggest that some patients will experience long-term respiratory complications of the infection. With the pattern of thoracic imaging abnormalities and growing clinical experience, it is envisaged that interstitial lung disease and pulmonary vascular disease are likely to be the most important respiratory complications. There is a need for a unified pathway for the respiratory follow-up of patients with COVID-19 balancing the delivery of high-quality clinical care with stretched National Health Service (NHS) resources. In this guidance document, we provide a suggested structure for the respiratory follow-up of patients with clinicoradiological confirmation of COVID-19 pneumonia. We define two separate algorithms integrating disease severity, likelihood of long-term respiratory complications and functional capacity on discharge. To mitigate NHS pressures, virtual solutions have been embedded within the pathway as has safety netting of patients whose clinical trajectory deviates from the pathway. For all patients, we suggest a holistic package of care to address breathlessness, anxiety, oxygen requirement, palliative care and rehabilitation.","George, Peter M; Barratt, Shaney L; Condliffe, Robin; Desai, Sujal R; Devaraj, Anand; Forrest, Ian; Gibbons, Michael A; Hart, Nicholas; Jenkins, R Gisli; McAuley, Danny F; Patel, Brijesh V; Thwaite, Erica; Spencer, Lisa G",Thorax,417,16

Here, we evaluated whether serum neurofilament light chain (NFL), a neuroaxonal injury marker, could predict the extent of neuronal damage in a cohort of 142 hospitalized patients with COVID-19. NFL was elevated in the serum of patients with COVID-19 compared to healthy controls, including those without overt neurological manifestations. Higher NFL serum concentrations were associated with worse clinical outcomes. In 100 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 treated with remdesivir, a trend toward lower NFL serum concentrations was observed. These data suggest that patients with COVID-19 may experience neuroaxonal injury and may be at risk for long-term neurological sequelae.

This article analyzes peer-reviewed research on the epidemiology and outcomes of COVID-19 in those with IMID. RECENT FINDINGS: Published literature on approximately 1400 patients was included from rheumatology, gastroenterology, and dermatology. Data suggest that those who are older and have comorbidities have poorer outcomes. This is consistent with the reports from the general population of patients with COVID-19. Adjusted analyses from the largest published studies demonstrate independent effects of systemic glucocorticoids, as well as age and comorbidities with poorer COVID-19 outcomes (SECURE-IBD registry, nâ=â525; COVID-19 Global Rheumatology Alliance registry, nâ=â600); biologic or targeted synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drug therapy has not been associated with more severe outcomes. These early results will require validation in population-based studies as more data becomes available. SUMMARY: Current data suggest that similar to the general population, age, and comorbidities are risk factors for poorer COVID-19 outcomes in patients with IMID. Additional research is needed to quantify outcomes and risk across rheumatic disease types, comorbidities, and immunosuppressive drugs.","Gianfrancesco, Milena; Yazdany, Jinoos; Robinson, Philip C",Curr Opin Rheumatol,417,22

This cluster was found to be originated from an asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 carrier, which resulted in 13 secondary cases getting infected. All the secondary patients presented with non-typical symptoms of COVID-19, such as fever, dry cough, and myalgia, one of which died of respiratory failure at the end. From this cluster, we learn that people with older ages, low immunity, multiple underlying diseases, especially pulmonary diseases, can contribute to a poor prognosis.

Therefore, this study aimed to describe the COVID-19 vaccine acceptance and hesitancy situation in Japan and assess the factors associated with such issues. This was a cross-sectional study based on an internet survey completed by 2956 people. Participants were asked to indicate how likely they were to get vaccinated for COVID-19. In addition, the participants responded to questions regarding sociodemographic factors, attitudes, and beliefs regarding COVID-19 infection and vaccination. The proportion of participants with a high likelihood of getting a COVID-19 vaccine was 62.1%. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that vaccine acceptance was lower among several sociodemographic groups, such as women, adults aged 20-49 years, and those with a low-income level. Several psychological factors, especially the perceived effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccine, and willingness to protect others by getting oneself vaccinated, were associated with vaccine acceptance.

Puumala hantavirus (PUUV) infection represents a unique RNA virus-induced renal disease with significant proteinuria. The underlying pathomechanism is unclear. We hypothesized that PUUV infection results in podocyte injury, similar to findings in INS. We therefore analyzed standard markers of glomerular proteinuria (e.g. immunoglobulin G [IgG]), urinary nephrin excretion (podocyte injury) and serum levels of the soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR), a proposed pathomechanically involved molecule in INS, in PUUV-infected patients. Hantavirus patients showed significantly increased urinary nephrin, IgG and serum suPAR concentrations compared to healthy controls. Nephrin and IgG levels were significantly higher in patients with severe proteinuria than with mild proteinuria, and nephrin correlated strongly with biomarkers of glomerular proteinuria over time. Congruently, electron microcopy analyses showed a focal podocyte foot process effacement. suPAR correlated significantly with urinary nephrin, IgG and albumin levels, suggesting suPAR as a pathophysiological mediator in podocyte dysfunction. In contrast to INS, proteinuria recovered autonomously in hantavirus patients. This study reveals podocyte injury as main cause of proteinuria in hantavirus patients.

The application of these approaches is usually feasible and effective when performed by healthcare professionals with specific expertise and skills and when data and resources are easily accessible. Contrariwise, in the field situation where healthcare workers or first responders from heterogeneous competences can be asked to investigate an outbreak of unknown origin, a simple and suitable tool for rapid agent identification and appropriate outbreak management is highly needed. Most especially when time is limited, available data are incomplete, and accessible infrastructure and resources are inadequate. The use of a prompt, user-friendly, and accessible tool able to rapidly recognize an infectious disease outbreak and with high sensitivity and precision may be a game-changer to support emergency response and public health investigations. METHODS: This paper presents the work performed to implement and test an innovative tool for prompt identification of infectious diseases during outbreaks, called Infectious Diseases Seeker (IDS). IDS is a standalone software that runs on the most common operative systems. It has been built by integrating a database containing an interim set of 60 different disease causative agents and COVID-19 data and is able to work in an off-line mode without requiring a network connection. RESULTS: IDS has been applied in a real and complex scenario in terms of concomitant infectious diseases (yellow fever, COVID-19, and Lassa fever), as can be in the second part of 2020 in Nigeria. The outcomes have allowed inferring that yellow fever (YF), and not Lassa fever, was affecting the area under investigation. CONCLUSIONS: Our result suggests that a tool like IDS could be valuable for the quick and easy identification and discrimination of infectious disease outbreaks even when concurrent outbreaks occur, like for the case study of YF and COVID-19 pandemic in Nigeria.","Baldassi, Federico; Carestia, Mariachiara; Moramarco, Stefania; Malizia, Andrea; Gaudio, Pasquale",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),417,6

The continued spread of the coronavirus suggests that this situation may be here to stay for a while. Contact tracing is a time-consuming and resource-intensive process, which taps on the already lean healthcare resource in certain countries. Furthermore, the massive infodemic on COVID-19 on the Internet has also resulted in widespread circulation of misinformation online. This outbreak has evoked irrational fear and anxiety from the public, which has resulted in destabilizing of societal norms, such as panic buying and hoarding of daily necessities, and can potentially pose serious health risks to the public. The aim of this paper is to present a COVID-19 Symptom Monitoring and Contact Tracking Record (CoV-SCR) web-app as a bottom-up, proactive approach to supplement the current management strategies for COVID-19. MAIN TEXT: The CoV-SCR web-app ( http://bit.ly/covscrapp ) enables individuals to keep a personal record of their close contacts and monitor their symptoms on a daily basis, so that they can provide relevant and accurate details when they see the doctor and during the contact tracing process. Individuals can record their temperature and rate their symptoms on a 5-point severity scale, as well as record details of their travel and contact history for the last 14 days. The recorded information will be sent to their e-mail address for potential symptom monitoring and contact tracing purposes. In addition, this web-app consolidates evidence-based information on the coronavirus from credible sources, such as the World Health Organization, countries' health authorities, and PubMed literature. CONCLUSIONS: A COVID-19 Symptom Monitoring and Contact Tracking web-app has been developed to facilitate contact tracing efforts through public engagement. This app serves an additional purpose of providing information about COVID-19 from reliable resources.","Yap, Kevin Yi-Lwern; Xie, Qihuang",Infect Dis Poverty,417,16

It is vital to know the characteristics of its users in order to be able to meet their needs and understand the coverage of this service in a context where there is reduced accessibility to the health system. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to analyze the profile of the citizens who use the eConsulta tool and the reasons for their use, as well as to gain an understanding of the elements that characterize their decision to use it while distinguishing between those who used it before and those who have used it since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A descriptive, observational study based on administrative data was performed. This study differentiates between the COVID-19 pandemic era and the period preceding it, considering the day the state of emergency was declared in Spain (ie, March 12, 2020) as the cut-off point. It also differentiates between eConsulta users who send messages and those who only receive them. RESULTS: During the pandemic, the number of unique users of this teleconsultation service had almost tripled, with up to 33.10 visits per 1000 inhabitants per month reported in the first three months. For the two user profiles analyzed, most users since the start of the COVID-19 outbreak were predominantly female, systematically younger, more actively employed, and with less complex pathologies. Furthermore, eConsulta users received more messages proactively from the health professionals. There was also a relative decrease in the number of conversations initiated by higher-income urban users and an increase in conversations initiated by users in rural areas. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has helped to generalize the use of telemedicine as a tool to compensate, to some extent, for the decline in face-to-face visits, especially among younger citizens in Catalonia. Telemedicine has made it possible to maintain contact between citizens and the health care system in the context of maximum complexity.","Solans, Oscar; Vidal-Alaball, Josep; Roig Cabo, Pasqual; Mora, Núria; Coma, Ermengol; Bonet Simó, Josep Maria; Hermosilla Pérez, Eduardo; Saigí-Rubió, Francesc; Olmos Domínguez, Carmen; Piera-Jiménez, Jordi; Abizanda González, Mercè; López Seguí, Francesc",J Med Internet Res,417,24

This study focuses on the emission of pollutants from 7 DPF brands that were submerged in water to simulate environmental conditions if these DPFs were littered. The DPF leachates were filtered by inorganic membranes, and both particle-deposited organic membranes and the filtrates were characterized using techniques such as FTIR, SEM-EDX, Light Microscopy, ICP-MS and LC-MS. Micro and nano scale polymeric fibres, particles, siliceous fragments and leachable inorganic and organic chemicals were observed from all of the tested DPFs. Traces of concerning heavy metals (i.e. lead up to 6.79 µg/L) were detected in association with silicon containing fragments.

The role of endovascular surgery in traumatic iliac lesions is unclear. The aim of this study is to compare outcomes for open versus endovascular management of traumatic iliac injuries. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The National Trauma Data Bank was searched for patients from 2002to 2016 with iliac arterial injury. Patients were sorted by treatment modality (open versus endo) and mechanism (blunt versus penetrating) and matched using mangled extremity score variables. The proportion of patients undergoing amputation were compared using the chi-square test. RESULTS: In the blunt group, 1550 (82%) had endovascular and 342 (18%) had open repair. Endovascular repair was associated with a significantly lower amputation rate than open repair (0.6% versus 3.6%, P = 0.015) despite higher incidence of concomitant injuries. Venous injury was more frequent in the open group (13.7% versus 1.8%, P < 0.001). Within the penetrating group, 209 (22%) had endovascular and 755 (78%) had open repair. Again endovascular repair was associated with a lower amputation rate (0% versus 5.1%, P = 0.004). Patients undergoing endovascular repair had more severe extremity/orthopedic injury, with venous injury again associated with open repair (48.5% versus 37.4%, P = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Endovascular repair of iliac injuries was associated with a significantly lower rate of amputation than open surgery. Endovascular repair was associated with a higher incidence of several injuries, although open repair was associated with concomitant venous injury.

SETTING: Veteran's Health Administration in Northern California Participants Community-dwelling older Veterans receiving care at VA Palo Alto Geriatrics clinic. Veterans had a mean age of 85.7 (SD = 6.8) and 72.1% had cognitive impairment. INTERVENTION: Veterans with face-to-face appointments were converted to video or telephone visits to mitigate exposure to community spread of COVID-19. MEASUREMENTS: Thirty-two patient evaluations and 80 clinician feedback evaluations were completed. This provided information on satisfaction, care access during pandemic, and travel and time savings. RESULTS: Of the 62 scheduled appointments, 43 virtual visits (69.4%) were conducted. Twenty-six (60.5%) visits were conducted via video, 17 (39.5%) by telephone. Virtual visits saved patients an average of 118.6 minutes each. Patients and providers had similar, positive perceptions about telehealth to in-person visit comparison, limiting exposure, and visit satisfaction. After the telehealth appointment, patients indicated greater comfort with using virtual visits in the future. Thirty-one evaluations included comments for qualitative analysis. We identified 3 main themes of technology set-up and usability, satisfaction with visit, and clinical assessment and communication. CONCLUSION: During a pandemic that has limited the ability to safely conduct inperson services, virtual formats offer a feasible and acceptable alternative for clinically-complex older patients. Despite potential barriers and additional effort required for telehealth visits, patients expressed willingness to utilize this format. Patients and providers reported high satisfaction, particularly with the ability to access care similar to in-person while staying safe. Investing in telehealth services during a pandemic ensures that vulnerable older patients can access care while maintaining social distancing, an important safety measure.","Iyer, Sowmya; Mehta, Priyanka; Weith, Joanne; Hoang-Gia, Dat; Moore, Janet; Carlson, Chalise; Choe, Philip; Sakai, Erin; Gould, Christine",J Prim Care Community Health,417,21

The authors propose a model for early coronavirus detection based on image filtering strategies and a hybrid feature selection model in this analysis. Traditional statistical and machine learning methods are used to derive these attributes from CT images. The Confusion Matrix for infected COVID-19 patients and regular patients was obtained using Support Vector Machine and K-Nearest Neighbor to classify the features chosen. The output of the two approaches can be compared. The various techniques’ performance shows that the Support Vector Machine achieves the highest precision of 97% compared to the K-Nearest Neighbor with a precision of 86%.,"Samsir, Samsir Jimmi Hendrik P.

For instance, fear, anxiety, and social divergence due to the disease's rapid spread and the absence of efficacious treatment. In addition to closures and quarantine. This study aims at identifying the psychological, social, and economic effects on Saudi society. We used the analytic approach. More specifically, the snowball sampling method was conducted with (1624 participants) aged between (18 -+60) during the COVID-19 pandemic from Riyadh and Najran cities. Accordingly, an online survey was conducted during the outbreak's peak phase, using the researchers' questionnaire. The results indicated that the psychological impact level was 42.25%, social (64.4%), and economic (51%) on Saudi society during the COVID-19 outbreak. In particular, psychosocial influence levels are exceptionally high for unmarried women, patients, and over 60 years. In contrast, the economic impact is high for married couples, private sector employees, and those living in rural areas with less than SAR 5,000. As a result, the study recommended that the Saudi government pay more attention to individuals' social, psychological, and economic aspects by developing medium and long-term political strategies, such as mapping the rates of psychological, social, and economic health problems to allocate adequate support and creating innovative ways online to increase the people well-being. © 2021 Alkhamshi et al..

The aims of this study were to identify the ongoing clinical activities at the height of pandemic, the guidance issued to staff regarding the use of personal protective equipment and the changes to maxillofacial practice. A prospective analysis was commenced within six Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery units in the East Midlands, UK with data being collected by means of a 10-item questionnaire relating to changes in patient care during this time. The responses were analysed to identify compliance with the national guidance produced by the British Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons. An 87% response rate was obtained (26 respondents from 30 invitations). 73.1% of participants confirmed all surgical members of staff were offered fit tests for FFP3 masks. All units reported a continuation of Head and Neck cancer and emergency operations with a complete reduction in TMJ and orthognathic surgery. FFP3 masks were the most popular masks used for theatre activity whilst FFP2 and surgical masks were more widely used for examining patients and performing procedures in the emergency department. Changes in maxillofacial practice included the use of local flaps compared to free flaps, use of intermaxillary fixation (IMF) where appropriate for craniofacial trauma and routine COVID-19 testing for all inpatients.","Ahmed, Asad; Evans, Kate; Rajapakse, Sujeev",Surg.

STUDY DESIGN: This short communication takes a descriptive analytical approach. METHODS: We synthesize conceptual insights drawn from (1) a recent international workshop that brought together researchers at the intersection of public health and political science and (2) the emerging literature on 'public health political science.' RESULTS: Although public health and political science would appear to be natural partners, work typically occurs in parallel rather than in partnership, resulting in missed opportunities for productive collaboration. We identify three key challenges to an effective partnership between political science and public health. These include the need for a common language and shared understanding of key concepts; mutual recognition of the complexity and diversity within each field; and a deeper engagement with their conceptual and methodological complementarities and differences. We also identify the area of evidence-informed policymaking as particularly ripe for productive collaboration between public health and political science. CONCLUSIONS: As the roles of politics and scientific evidence in public health policy grow ever more contentious, public health and political science need to move beyond their disciplinary comfort zones and engage productively with the different perspectives and contributions that each field has to offer.","Fafard, P; Cassola, A",Public Health,417,26

These efforts typically rely on a variant of the SIR process and have illustrated that building effective forecasts for an epidemic in its early stages is challenging. This is perhaps surprising since these models rely on a small number of parameters and typically provide an excellent retrospective fit to the evolution of a disease. So motivated, we provide an analysis of the limits to estimating an SIR process. We show that no unbiased estimator can hope to learn this process until observing enough of the epidemic so that one is approximately two-thirds of the way to reaching the peak for new infections. Our analysis provides insight into a regularization strategy that permits effective learning across simultaneously and asynchronously evolving epidemics. This strategy has been used to produce accurate, granular predictions for the COVID-19 epidemic that has found large-scale practical application in a large US state.","Baek, Jackie; Farias, Vivek F.; Georgescu, Andreea; Levi, Retsef; Peng, Tianyi; Sinha, Deeksha; Wilde, Joshua; Zheng, Andrew",,417,6

The adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) activity of KaiC is the source of the 24-h period and temperature compensation. Although numerous circadian mutants of KaiC have been identified, the tuning mechanism of the 24-h period remains unclear. Here, we show that the circadian period of in vitro phosphorylation rhythm of mutants at position 402 of KaiC changed dramatically, from 15 h (0.6 d) to 158 h (6.6 d). The ATPase activities of mutants at position 402 of KaiC, without KaiA and KaiB, correlated with the frequencies (1/period), indicating that KaiC structure was the source of extra period change. Despite the wide-range tunability, temperature compensation of both the circadian period and the KaiC ATPase activity of mutants at position 402 of KaiC were nearly intact. We also found that in vivo and in vitro circadian periods and the KaiC ATPase activity of mutants at position 402 of KaiC showed a correlation with the side-chain volume of the amino acid at position 402 of KaiC. Our results indicate that residue 402 is a key position of determining the circadian period of cyanobacteria, and it is possible to dramatically alter the period of KaiC while maintaining temperature compensation.","Ito-Miwa, Kumiko; Furuike, Yoshihiko; Akiyama, Shuji; Kondo, Takao",Proc.

Mathematical modeling is one of the most important tools that can speed up finding a drug or vaccine for COVID-19. COVID-19 can lead to death especially for patients having chronic diseases such as cancer, AIDS, etc. We construct a new within-host SARS-CoV-2/cancer model. The model describes the interactions between six compartments: nutrient, healthy epithelial cells, cancer cells, SARS-CoV-2 virus particles, cancer-specific CTLs, and SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies. We verify the nonnegativity and boundedness of its solutions. We outline all possible equilibrium points of the proposed model. We prove the global stability of equilibria by constructing proper Lyapunov functions. We do some numerical simulations to visualize the obtained results. According to our model, lymphopenia in COVID-19 cancer patients may worsen the outcomes of the infection and lead to death.

We leverage longitudinal data from 56 conspiracy communities on Reddit to compare individual and social factors determining which users join the communities. Using a quasi-experimental approach, we first identify 30K future conspiracists-(FC) and 30K matched non-conspiracists-(NC). We then provide empirical evidence of importance of social factors across six dimensions relative to the individual factors by analyzing 6 million Reddit comments and posts. Specifically in social factors, we find that dyadic interactions with members of the conspiracy communities and marginalization outside of the conspiracy communities, are the most important social precursors to conspiracy joining-even outperforming individual factor baselines.

This article presents ""spheres of influence"" as a concept that can help physicians think strategically about how to build upon their clinical work and expertise to promote equity in medicine. The physician's primary sphere of influence is in direct patient care. However, physicians today often have many other roles, especially within larger health care institutions in which physicians often occupy positions of authority. Physicians are therefore well-positioned to act within these spheres in ways that draw upon the ethical principles that guide patient care and contribute materially to the cause of equity for colleagues and patients alike. By making changes to the ways they already work within their clinical spaces, institutional leadership roles, and wider communities, physicians can counteract the structural problems that undermine the health of the patients they serve.","Karches, Kyle; DeCamp, Matthew; George, Maura; Prochaska, Micah; Saunders, Milda; Thorsteinsdottir, Bjorg; Dzeng, Elizabeth",J. gen. intern. med,417,7

However, the global epidemic of COVID-19 is worsening. We established a method to estimate the instant case fatality rate (CFR) and cure rate of COVID-19 in China. METHODS: A total of 82 735 confirmed cases released officially by the Chinese authorities from December 8, 2019 to April 18, 2020 were collected. The estimated diagnosis dates of deaths and cured cases were calculated based on the median cure time or median death time of individual cases. Following this, the instant CFR was calculated according to the number of deaths and cured cases on the same estimated diagnosis date. RESULTS: In China, the instant CFR of COVID-19 was 3.8-14.6% from January 1 to January 17; it then declined gradually and stabilized at 5.7% in April. The average CFR in China was 6.1±2.9%, while the CFR was 1.0±0.4% in China except Hubei Province. The cure rate of COVID-19 was 93.9±2.9% in China, and stabilized at 94.3%, while it was 99.0±0.4% in China except Hubei Province. CONCLUSIONS: The instant CFR of COVID-19 in China overall was much higher than that in China except Hubei Province. The CFR of COVID-19 in China was underestimated.","Mi, Yan-Ni; Huang, Ting-Ting; Zhang, Jun-Xia; Qin, Qi; Gong, Ya-Xin; Liu, Si-Yu; Xue, Hui-Min; Ning, Chang-Hua; Cao, Lei; Cao, Yong-Xiao",Int J Infect Dis,417,20

The aim of this study is to describe the change of the activity of a Paediatric Emergency Service (PES) of a tertiary hospital during the pandemic. A retrospective cohort study with analysis of visits to the PES from March 30 to June 30, 2020, and comparison with homologous periods in the previous 3 years (2017-2019).A total of 53,883 episodes were analysed, with a median age of 5.8 years, and 53% were boys. In 2020, there was a 60% reduction in the number of admissions (p < 0.001). There was a significant increase in referral by the public medical advice phone line of the National Health Service (NHS) (18.5% vs 5.4%) and Emergency Medical Services (EMS) (5.1% vs 4.2%). Urgent patients decreased (31.2% vs 38.3%), and non-urgent patients increased (7.5% vs 1.7%). There was a significant reduction in school (0.4% vs 7.1%) and sports accidents (0.1% vs 1.2%) and an increase in other accidents (falls, wounds, burns, and dog bites) (12.2% vs 6.3%). Hospitalisation rate was higher (5.7% vs 3.1%, p < 0.001). The infection rate for SARS-CoV-2 was 1.1%, all with mild illness or asymptomatic.Conclusion: The pandemic brought a marked reduction in emergency admissions and a decrease in urgent situations but an increase in accidents, such as falls, wounds, burns, and dog bites. Despite the low infection rate for SARS-CoV-2, there were increased referrals by the phone line of NHS and EMS and a higher admission in the ward. What is Known: â¢ The number of admissions to emergency services significantly decreased during the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly in the paediatric population, whom has a milder disease than adults. â¢ Diseases that justify urgent/emergent hospital admission continue to exist and the eventual delay in seeking health care might lead to a worse prognosis. What is New: â¢ Despite the low rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children, there was an increase in referrals by the phone line of the National Health Service and Emergency Medical Services. â¢ The global admission rate to the ward increased but there were no admissions to intensive care or deaths.","Paiva, Rafaela; Martins, Cátia; Rodrigues, Fernanda; Domingues, Mariana",Eur. j. pediatr,417,26

However, frequently the models used by experts [from whom decision-makers get their main advice] focus on a single perspective [for example, the epidemiological one] and do not consider many of the multiple forces that affect the COVID-19 outbreak patterns. The epidemiological, socioeconomic, and human mobility context of COVID-19 can be considered as a complex adaptive system. So, these interventions (for example, lock-downs) could have many and/or unexpected ramifications. This situation makes it difficult to understand the overall effect produced by any public policy measure and, therefore, to assess its real effectiveness and convenience. By using mobile phone data, socioeconomic data, and COVID-19 cases data recorded throughout the pandemic development, we aim to understand and explain [make sense of] the observed heterogeneous regional patterns of contagion across time and space. We will also consider the causal effects produced by confinement policies by developing data-based models to explore, simulate, and estimate these policies' effectiveness. We intend to develop a methodology to assess and improve public policies' effectiveness associated with the fight against the pandemic, emphasizing its convenience, the precise time of its application, and extension.

We aim to present the results of the screening program implied after outbreak of COVID-19 in a referral hemodialysis ward. METHODS: We started clinical screening and obligatory mask wearing for dialysis patients and personnel on 20-Feb-2020. However 11 symptomatic COVID-19 patients emerged till day +36. On days +39 and +40 a screening program was implied including measurement of SARS-COV-2 PCR and immunoglobulin G and M (IgG/IgM) and chest computerized tomography (CCT) scan. The results of CCT scan, classified according to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) Reporting and Data System (CO-RADS) classification; as with very low (grade 1-normal), low, indeterminate, high, and very high likelihood of COVID-19 (grades 2, 3, 4, and 5; respectively), were used for compartmentalization of patients. RESULTS: Among 178 patients (68.2% male, mean age = 58.7 ± 16.6 years), 11 got COVID-19 before screening, two of whom died. CCT scans were normal in 71.3% and grade 2, 3, 4, and 5 in 7.9%, 4.5%, 5.6%, and 10.7%; respectively. PCR and IgG and/or IgM were positive in 27 and 32 patients. Eighty-three patients had evidence of COVID-19 infection, who were significantly older (62.2 ± 16.6 vs. 56.1 ± 16.02, P < .05). There was no difference in the rate of infection considering gender, diabetes mellitus, hypertension and different blood groups. CONCLUSION: Asymptomatic SARS- COV 2 infection may affect a large number of dialysis patients. We highly recommend a screening strategy whenever the number of patients is increasing.","Ossareh, Shahrzad; Bagheri, Morteza; Abbasi, Mohsen; Abolfathi, Sara; Bohlooli, Azam",Iran J Kidney Dis,417,16

A series of chemical reactions was performed to immobilize both a monoclonal antibody and a polyclonal antibody onto the Au-plated electrode used as the sensing surface. An important step in the biofunctionalization, namely, the formation of Au-plated clusters on the sensor strips, was verified by scanning electron microscopy, as well as electrical measurements, to confirm successful binding of thiol groups on this Au surface. The functionalized sensor was externally connected to the gate electrode of the MOSFET, and synchronous pulses were applied to both the sensing strip and the drain contact of the MOSFET. The resulting changes in the dynamics of drain waveforms were converted into analog voltages and digital readouts, which correlate with the concentration of proteins and virus present in the tested solution. A broad range of protein concentrations from 1 fg/ml to 10 μg/ml and virus concentrations from 100 to 2500 PFU/ml were detectable for the sensor functionalized with both antibodies. The results show the potential of this approach for the development of a portable, low-cost, and disposable cartridge sensor system for point-of-care detection of viral diseases.","Xian, M.; Luo, H.; Xia, X.; Fares, C.; Carey, P.

There is an urgent need to identify safe and effective drugs for treatment. Chloroquine (CQ) exhibits a promising inhibitory effect. However, the clinical use of CQ can cause severe side effects. We propose that hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), which exhibits an antiviral effect highly similar to that of CQ, could serve as a better therapeutic approach. HCQ is likely to attenuate the severe progression of COVID-19, inhibiting the cytokine storm by suppressing T cell activation. It has a safer clinical profile and is suitable for those who are pregnant. It is cheaper and more readily available in China.

High recoveries (up to 65%) are described with electronegative filtration when using surrogate viruses, but few literature reports recovery efficiencies using accurate quantification of enveloped viruses. Considering that every single virus will have a different behaviour during viral concentration, it is recommended to use an enveloped virus, and if possible, a betacoronaviruses as murine hepatitis virus (MHV), as a surrogate. In this review we show new data from a new available technology that provides a quick ultrafiltration protocol for SARS-CoV-2. Wastewater surveillance is an efficient system for the evaluation of the relative prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infections in a community, and there is the need of using reliable concentration methods for an accurate and sensitive quantification of the virus in water.","Rusiñol, Marta; Martínez-Puchol, Sandra; Forés, Eva; Itarte, Marta; Girones, Rosina; Bofill-Mas, Sílvia",,417,27

Before the COVID-19 pandemic, adoption of telehealth modalities was increasing slowly but steadily. During the public health emergency, rapid widespread telehealth implementation has been encouraged to promote patient and provider safety and preserve access to health care. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: Evidence was acquired from English language Internet searches of the medical and business literature and following breaking news on the COVID-19 pandemic and responses from health care stakeholders, including policymakers, payers, physicians, health care organizations, and patients. We also had extensive discussions with colleagues who are developing telehealth techniques relevant to neuro-ophthalmology. RESULTS: Regulatory, legal, reimbursement, and cultural barriers impeded the widespread adoption of telehealth before the COVID-19 pandemic. With the increased use of telehealth in response to the public health emergency, we are rapidly accumulating experience and an evidence base identifying opportunities and challenges related to the widespread adoption of tele-neuro-ophthalmology. One of the major challenges is the current inability to adequately perform funduscopy remotely. CONCLUSIONS: Telehealth is an increasingly recognized means of health care delivery. Tele-Neuro-Ophthalmology adoption is necessary for the sake of our patients, the survival of our subspecialty, and the education of our trainees and students. Telehealth does not supplant but supplements and complements in-person neuro-ophthalmologic care. Innovations in digital optical fundus photography, mobile vision testing applications, artificial intelligence, and principles of channel management will facilitate further adoption of tele-neuro-ophthalmology and bring the specialty to the leading edge of health care delivery.","Ko, Melissa W; Busis, Neil A",J Neuroophthalmol,417,26

Our goal was to understand the knowledge, beliefs, and experiences of US youth at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We posed 2 open-ended surveys to the national MyVoice text message cohort of youth, aged 14-24 years. On March 6, 2020, 4 questions were asked regarding knowledge and experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic with 3 questions repeated on March 20, 2020. Qualitative responses were coded using thematic analysis and summarized with descriptive statistics. RESULTS: Of 1,174 youth, 1,087 responded to at least 1 question (response rate of 88%). The average age of respondents was 19 (SD 2.8) years with 52% female and 56% non-Hispanic White respondents. On March 6, 2020, most (70%) respondents reported knowing about COVID-19 and primarily cited the news (46%) as their source of information. Nearly all (95%) respondents reported impact by March 20, 2020, and respondents expressing worry increased from 25% to 51%. In both surveys, worried youth primarily cited concern for others (26% and 34%). Regarding preparation, respondents primarily reported doing nothing (36%) on March 6, 2020, and practicing social distancing (50%) on March 20, 2020. CONCLUSIONS: Many youths in our sample are engaged with the COVID-19 pandemic and most are feeling knowledgeable, are concerned about its impacts on others, and are practicing social distancing.

Our results indicate that risk-taking attitudes are a critical factor in predicting reductions in human mobility and social confinement around the globe. We find that the sharp decline in mobility after the WHO (World Health Organization) declared COVID-19 to be a pandemic can be attributed to risk attitudes. Our results suggest that regions with risk-averse attitudes are more likely to adjust their behavioural activity in response to the declaration of a pandemic even before official government lockdowns.

Each organ brings new challenges from the perspective of a pathogen to establish a suitable niche for survival while subverting the protective mechanisms of the host. Lungs, the organ for oxygen exchange, have been an easy target for pathogens due to its accessibility. The organ has evolved diverse capabilities to provide the flexibility required for an organism's health and at the same time maintain protective functionality to prevent and resolve assault by pathogens. The pathogenic invasions are strongly challenged by healthy lung architecture which includes the presence and activity of the epithelium, mucous, antimicrobial proteins, surfactants, and immune cells. Competitively, the pathogens in the form of viruses, bacteria, and fungi have evolved an arsenal of strategies that can over-ride the host's protective mechanisms. While bacteria such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis) can survive in dormant form for years before getting active in humans, novel pathogens can wreak havoc as they pose a high risk of morbidity and mortality in a very short duration of time. Recently, a coronavirus strain SARS-CoV-2 has caused a pandemic which provides us an opportunity to look at the host manipulative strategies used by respiratory pathogens. Their ability to hide, modify, evade, and exploit cell's processes are key to their survival. While pathogens like M. tuberculosis have been infecting humans for thousands of years, SARS-CoV-2 has been the cause of the recent pandemic. Molecular understanding of the strategies used by these pathogens could greatly serve in design of predictive, preventive, personalized medicine (PPPM). In this article, we have emphasized on the clinically relevant evasive strategies of the pathogens in the lungs with emphasis on M. tuberculosis and SARS-CoV-2. The molecular basis of these evasive strategies illuminated through advances in genomics, cell, and structural biology can assist in the mapping of vulnerable molecular networks which can be exploited translationally. These evolutionary approaches can further assist in generating screening and therapeutic options for susceptible populations and could be a promising approach for the prediction, prevention of disease, and the development of personalized medicines. Further, tailoring the clinical data of COVID-19 patients with their physiological responses in light of known host-respiratory pathogen interactions can provide opportunities to improve patient profiling and stratification according to identified therapeutic targets.","Ahluwalia, Pankaj; Ahluwalia, Meenakshi; Vaibhav, Kumar; Mondal, Ashis; Sahajpal, Nikhil; Islam, Shaheen; Fulzele, Sadanand; Kota, Vamsi; Dhandapani, Krishnan; Baban, Babak; Rojiani, Amyn M; Kolhe, Ravindra",EPMA J,417,24

With advances in treatment options, the identification of patients with obstructive ETD is becoming increasingly important. The objective of this study was to validate a Danish translation of the 7-item Eustachian Tube Dysfunction Questionnaire (ETDQ-7). METHODS: All participants underwent tympanometry, otomicroscopy and completed the ETDQ-7. We included 34 ears from patients with obstructive ETD who had abnormal tympanometry curves but no history of cholesteatoma or adhesive otitis. As a control group, 48 otherwise healthy ears with a normal tympanometry curve were included from patients with known sensorineural hearing loss or normal hearing. RESULTS: A Cronbach's alpha of 0.77 indicated a good internal consistency reliability of the questionnaire. The mean ETDQ-7 score in the obstructive ETD group was 31 versus 13.5 in the control group (p = 0.00). A receiver operating characteristics analysis produced an area under the curve of 94%, showing excellent discriminatory abilities between the groups. CONCLUSIONS: The ETDQ-7 has previously been validated in English, German, Dutch and Portuguese, demonstrating good clinical relevance. The Danish translation of the ETDQ-7 has produced similar results and may be valuable in diagnosing obstructive ETD and in monitoring the effect of balloon dilation of the Eustachian tube.

Urgent endoscopies are, however, intended to proceed as normal with additional personal protective procedures. A perceived reduction in hospital attendances may suggest a number of urgently indicated endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatographies (ERCPs) are being missed. Objectives and Methods: A review of all ERCPs carried out in a large tertiary referral endoscopy unit under healthcare restrictions was compared to the same time period in previous years. The intention was to determine if ERCPs are proceeding as normal or if there is a difference in referral characteristics. RESULTS: Under service restrictions (13 March to the end of April 2020), 55 ERCPs were performed compared with 87 ERCPs in 2019. Similar numbers to 2019 were also recorded in the preceding years. One case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was reported in a patient in the days following ERCP, with no cases notified among staff related to endoscopy. CONCLUSIONS: A reduction in ERCP referrals raises concern that a cohort of patients with significant biliary disease remain undetected. Whether this results in later, and more severe, presentation remains to be seen but a potential surge in such cases could significantly burden all future endoscopy planning services.","O039,; Grady, John; Leyden, Jan; MacMathuna, Padraic; Stewart, Stephen; Kelleher, T Barry",Scand J Gastroenterol,417,22

Radical changes occurred in the Italian NHS and thus in GI departments, as only urgent endoscopies were guaranteed. The study aimed to report how the demand for urgent endoscopy changed during the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy and to evaluate the appropriateness of urgent referrals in the Endoscopy Unit.Material and methods: Nation-wide, cross-sectional survey study in 54 Italian GI Units. Data were collected regarding urgent endoscopies (EGD, CS, ERCP) in two different time periods: March 2019 and March 2020.Results: Thirty-five (64.8%) GI endoscopy Units responded to the survey. The entity of reduction of overall urgent EGDs and CSs performed in March 2020 versus March 2019 was statistically significant: 541 versus 974 (-80%), p < .001 for EGD and 171 versus 265 (-55%), p < .008, for CS, respectively. No statistically significant reduction of urgent ERCP performed in March 2020 versus March 2019 was found. The increase in overall diagnostic yield for urgent EGD in March 2020 versus March 2019 was 7.3% (CI [0.028-0.117], p = .001).

Mortality attributable to COVID-19 in Denmark increased steeply, and peaked in 2020-W14. As preventive measures and national lockdown were implemented from 2020-W12, the attributable mortality started declining within a few weeks. Mortality attributable to COVID-19 from 2020-W09 to 2020-W20 was estimated to 16.2 (95% confidence interval (CI): 12.0 to 20.4) per 100,000 person-years. The 2019/20 influenza season was mild with few deaths attributable to influenza, 3.2 (95% CI: 1.1 to 5.4) per 100,000 person-years.ConclusionAttMOMO estimates mortality attributable to several pathogens simultaneously, providing a fuller picture of mortality by COVID-19 during the pandemic in the context of other seasonal diseases and mortality patterns. Using Danish data, we show that the model accurately estimates mortality attributable to COVID-19 and influenza, respectively. We propose using standardised indicators for pathogen circulation in the population, to make estimates comparable between countries and applicable for timely monitoring.","Nielsen, Jens; Rod, Naja Hulvej; Vestergaard, Lasse S; Lange, Theis",Euro surveill,417,16

Examining baseline SARS-CoV-2 cross-reactive immunological responses, induced by circulating human coronaviruses (hCoVs), is needed to understand such divergent clinical outcomes. Here we show analysis of coronavirus antibody responses of pre-pandemic healthy children (n = 89), adults (n = 98), elderly (n = 57), and COVID-19 patients (n = 50) by systems serology. Moderate levels of cross-reactive, but non-neutralizing, SARS-CoV-2 antibodies are detected in pre-pandemic healthy individuals. SARS-CoV-2 antigen-specific FcÎ³ receptor binding accurately distinguishes COVID-19 patients from healthy individuals, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 infection induces qualitative changes to antibody Fc, enhancing FcÎ³ receptor engagement. Higher cross-reactive SARS-CoV-2 IgA and IgG are observed in healthy elderly, while healthy children display elevated SARS-CoV-2 IgM, suggesting that children have fewer hCoV exposures, resulting in less-experienced but more polyreactive humoral immunity. Age-dependent analysis of COVID-19 patients, confirms elevated class-switched antibodies in elderly, while children have stronger Fc responses which we demonstrate are functionally different.

Repurposing it against coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) is a relatively newer concept and has been sparsely tested in vivo. The most common route of entry of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV-2) is the nasopharynx. Averting colonization of the virus could be one of the best options to reduce the incidence of infection. PVP-I gargle and mouthwash were found to be effective in vitro rapid inactivation against SARS-CoV-2 on a smaller scale (Hassandarvish et al. in BDJ 1-4, 2020, Pelletier et al. in ENTJ 1-5, 2020). However, efficacy in humans is lacking. To assess the virucidal effect of PVP-I against SARS-CoV-2 located in the nasopharynx was the objective of this parallel armed randomized clinical trial. We screened all RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 cases aged 18 years and above with symptoms. Written informed consent was obtained before randomization. Nasopharyngeal clearance of SARS-CoV-2 was tested after single time application of PVP-I nasal irrigation (NI) at diluted concentrations of .4%, .5% and .6% and PVP-I nasal spray (NS) at diluted concentrations of .5% and .6%. All groups were compared to the corresponding controls (distilled water). The primary outcome was viral clearance in a repeat RT-PCR (qualitative), and the secondary outcome was the number of adverse events. Final data analysis was performed using the statistical software SPSS (Version 20). A total of 189 confirmed COVID-19 cases were randomized into seven groups: 27 patients in each group. Of all, 159 (84.1%) were male, and 30 (15.9%) were female. We observed a statistically significant proportion of nasopharyngeal clearance with all strengths of PVP-I NI and PVP-I NS compared to the corresponding controls. Additionally, 0.5% NI was significantly better than 0.5% NS for viral clearance (p = 0.018) and had the highest nasopharyngeal clearance among all strengths (n = 25, 92.6%). 0.6% NS is better than CNS and 0.5%NS in viral clearance. The only adverse event was nasal irritation recorded in two patients each in the 0.4% and 0.6% PVP-I NI groups (Tables 1 and 2). PVP-I NI and NS are proved as effective virucidal agent against SARS-CoV-2 in human body. Our recommendation is to use PVP-I in naopharynx (as well as oropharynx) to prevent COVID-19.","Arefin, Mostafa Kamal; Rumi, S K Nurul Fattah; Uddin, A K M Nasir; Banu, Sultana Sahana; Khan, Mala; Kaiser, Ahsanul; Chowdhury, Joybaer Anam; Khan, Md Abdullah Saeed; Hasan, Mohammad Jahid",Indian J Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,417,2

Vaccine trials excluded nursing home (NH) residents, limiting adverse event data that directly apply to this population. METHODS: To prospectively monitor for potential adverse events associated with vaccination, we used Electronic Health Record (EHR) data from Genesis HealthCare, the largest NH provider in the United States. EHR data on vaccinations and pre-specified adverse events were updated daily and monitored for signal detection among residents of 147 facilities who received the first dose of vaccine between December 18, 2020 and January 3, 2021. For comparison, unvaccinated residents during the same time period were included from 137 facilities that started vaccinating at least 15 days after the vaccinating-facilities. RESULTS: As of January 3, 2021, 8553 NH residents had received one dose of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine and by February 20, 2021, 8371 residents had received their second dose of vaccine; 11,072 were included in the unvaccinated comparator group. No significant associations were noted for neurologic outcomes, anaphylaxis, or cardiac events.

To fill this gap, we estimate the adjustments required to extrapolate estimates of the IFR from high-income to lower-income regions. Accounting for differences in the distribution of age, sex and relevant comorbidities yields substantial differences in the predicted IFR across 21 world regions, ranging from 0.11% in Western Sub-Saharan Africa to 1.07% for high-income Asia Pacific. However, these predictions must be treated as lower bounds in low- and middle-income countries as they are grounded in fatality rates from countries with advanced health systems. To adjust for health system capacity, we incorporate regional differences in the relative odds of infection fatality from childhood respiratory syncytial virus. This adjustment greatly diminishes but does not entirely erase the demography-based advantage predicted in the lowest income settings, with regional estimates of the predicted COVID-19 IFR ranging from 0.37% in Western Sub-Saharan Africa to 1.45% for Eastern Europe.","Ghisolfi, Selene; Almås, Ingvild; Sandefur, Justin C; von Carnap, Tillman; Heitner, Jesse; Bold, Tessa",,417,16

These children could benefit from more efficient intervention responses, providing a better understanding of their cognitive weaknesses/deficits. Our aim was to explore the cognitive heterogeneity of a population of poor readers identified from a large sample of 948 sixth-grade children. We first assessed the contribution of phoneme awareness (PA), rapid automatized naming (RAN), and visual attention span (VAS) to reading performance in a subset of 281 children including poor and average readers/spellers. We show that all three skills are unique and significant predictors of reading fluency. We then restricted the analysis to participants with normal Raven's score (IQ) and oral language skills to focus on 110 children with more specific reading difficulties. A unique VAS deficit was found in 18% of these poor readers while 20% and 15.5% showed a unique PA or RAN deficit. Children with multiple or no deficit were further identified. The overall findings provide evidence for a variety of cognitive profiles in poor readers. They suggest that, in addition to PA interventions, training programs targeting VAS might be useful for the nontrivial share of poor readers who exhibit a VAS deficit.","Valdois, Sylviane; Reilhac, Caroline; Ginestet, Emilie; Line Bosse, Marie",J Learn Disabil,417,24

Due to the high demand for SARS-CoV-2 testing there is a worldwide shortage of RNA extraction reagents. Therefore, extraction-free RT-qPCR protocols are urgently needed. OBJECTIVES: To establish a rapid RT-qPCR protocol for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 without the need of RNA extraction suitable for all respiratory materials. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Different SARS-CoV-2 positive respiratory materials from our routine laboratory were used as crude material after heat inactivation in direct RT-qPCR with the PrimeDirect&#8482; Probe RT-qPCR Mix (TaKaRa). SARS-CoV-2 was detected using novel primers targeted to the E-gene. RESULTS: The protocol for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in crude material used a prepared frozen-PCR mix with optimized primers and 5 µl of fresh, undiluted and pre-analytically heat inactivated respiratory material. For validation, 91 respiratory samples were analyzed in direct comparison to classical RNA-based RT-qPCR. Overall 81.3 % of the samples were detected in both assays with a strong correlation between both Ct values (r = 0.8492, p < 0.0001). The SARS-CoV-2 detection rate by direct RT-qPCR was 95.8 % for Ct values <35. All negative samples were characterized by low viral loads (Ct >35) and/or long storage times before sample processing. CONCLUSION: Direct RT-qPCR is a suitable alternative to classical RNA RT-qPCR, provided that only fresh samples (storage <1 week) are used. RNA extraction should be considered if samples have longer storage times or if PCR inhibition is observed. In summary, this protocol is fast, inexpensive and suitable for all respiratory materials.","Lübke, Nadine; Senff, Tina; Scherger, Sara; Hauka, Sandra; Andrée, Marcel; Adams, Ortwin; Timm, Jörg; Walker, Andreas",J Clin Virol,417,3

To answer the question, we propose concepts of individual utility and societal utility and build a simple model. By applying the model, we predict that countries with an individualist culture would adopt more passive strategies while countries with a collectivist culture would adopt more active strategies. The comparison between strategies adopted in China and in the United Kingdom supports the prediction. Furthermore, as the spread of COVID-19 virus continues, governments’ response may change and individualist countries may switch to more active strategies. So we extend our model to incorporate the dynamics of strategy selection, and explain the switch between passive and active strategies. We then predict in particular that facing the unexpected infections and deaths, the countries with an individualist culture would temporally adopt a relatively more active strategy responding to COVID-19. The evidence from Spain shows the dynamic feature of strategy selection as predicted by our model.","Li, Wilson X. B.; He, Tina T.",Econ. Polit. Studies,417,16

Due to rapid increase in number of cases and limited supply of testing kits, availability of alternative diagnostic method is necessary for containing the spread of COVID-19 cases at an early stage and reducing the death count. For making available an alternative diagnostic method, we proposed a deep neural network based diagnostic method which can be easily integrated with mobile devices for detection of COVID-19 and viral pneumonia using Chest X-rays (CXR) images. Methods:In this study, we have proposed a method named COVIDLite, which is a combination of white balance followed by Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) and depth-wise separable convolutional neural network (DSCNN). In this method, white balance followed by CLAHE is used as an image preprocessing step for enhancing the visibility of CXR images and DSCNN trained using sparse cross entropy is used for image classification with lesser parameters and significantly lighter in size, i.e., 8.4 MB without quantization. Results:The proposed COVIDLite method resulted in improved performance in comparison to vanilla DSCNN with no pre-processing. The proposed method achieved higher accuracy of 99.58% for binary classification, whereas 96.43% for multiclass classification and out-performed various state-of-the-art methods. Conclusion:Our proposed method, COVIDLite achieved exceptional results on various performance metrics. With detailed model interpretations, COVIDLite can assist radiologists in detecting COVID-19 patients from CXR images and can reduce the diagnosis time significantly.","Siddhartha, Manu; Santra, Avik",,417,16

A human-to-human transmission was assumed and a previously unrecognized entity, termed coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) due to a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was described. The infection has rapidly spread out all over the world and Italy has been the first European country experiencing the endemic wave with unexpected clinical severity in comparison with Asian countries. It has been shown that SARS-CoV-2 utilizes angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as host receptor and host proteases for cell surface binding and internalization. Thus, a predisposing genetic background can give reason for interindividual disease susceptibility and/or severity. Taking advantage of the Network of Italian Genomes (NIG), here we mined whole-exome sequencing data of 6930 Italian control individuals from five different centers looking for ACE2 variants. A number of variants with a potential impact on protein stability were identified. Among these, three more common missense changes, p.(Asn720Asp), p.(Lys26Arg), and p.(Gly211Arg) were predicted to interfere with protein structure and stabilization. Rare variants likely interfering with the internalization process, namely p.(Leu351Val) and p.(Pro389His), predicted to interfere with SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binding, were also observed. Comparison of ACE2 WES data between a cohort of 131 patients and 258 controls allowed identifying a statistically significant (P value < 0.029) higher allelic variability in controls compared with patients. These findings suggest that a predisposing genetic background may contribute to the observed interindividual clinical variability associated with COVID-19, allowing an evidence-based risk assessment leading to personalized preventive measures and therapeutic options.","Benetti, Elisa; Tita, Rossella; Spiga, Ottavia; Ciolfi, Andrea; Birolo, Giovanni; Bruselles, Alessandro; Doddato, Gabriella; Giliberti, Annarita; Marconi, Caterina; Musacchia, Francesco; Pippucci, Tommaso; Torella, Annalaura; Trezza, Alfonso; Valentino, Floriana; Baldassarri, Margherita; Brusco, Alfredo; Asselta, Rosanna; Bruttini, Mirella; Furini, Simone; Seri, Marco; Nigro, Vincenzo; Matullo, Giuseppe; Tartaglia, Marco; Mari, Francesca; Renieri, Alessandra; Pinto, Anna Maria",Eur J Hum Genet,417,16

The difference of clinical characteristics and prognosis of the two groups were compared. There were more patients with fever in I group than in L group(P = 0.003), and counts of all the total lymphocytes, total T lymphocytes, CD4 + and CD8 + T lymphocytes were significantly different between the two groups(all P < 0.01). Besides, patients in L group had more GGOs in CT scan than I group and there were more patients in I group receiving antibiotic treatment than in L group(P < 0.001). For disease aggravation, the median CT scores were comparable between the two groups, but individually, there were more patients with increased CT score during hospitalization in I group than in L group. The aggravation incidence of CT presentation was 21.1% in I group, significantly higher than L group(8.0%, P = 0.042). Multivariable COX models suggested that IP was the only independent factors for CT aggravation.

Race 2F is the predominant physiological race of the pathogen Podosphaera xanthii in many regions. We used accessions PMR 6 (P1; resistant to PM) and M1-7 (P2; susceptible to PM) to analyze the inheritance of resistance to PM (race 2F). The ratio between resistant and susceptible individuals fits a Mendelian segregation ratio of 13:3 in a total of 256 F2 individuals and 1:1 in BC1P2. The resistance to PM in PMR 6 was governed by two genes: a dominant (AA) gene with an epistatic effect and a recessive gene (bb). Only individuals with aaBB or aaBb genotypes were susceptible to PM. Two powdery mildew-resistance loci, Pm2.1 and pm12.1, were mapped on chromosomes 2 and 12 by bulked segregant analysis and secondary mapping by QTL analysis with 18 markers. A new marker-assisted selection system to identify melon genotypes resistant or susceptible to PM was developed and tested in 93 melon accessions. Nucleotide diversity (&#960;) and fixation index (Fst) for the two powdery mildew-resistance loci were estimated using resequencing data of 336 melons from three groups: Cucumis melo subsp. agrestis, Cucumis melo subsp. melo and the intermediate type. The lowest &#960; was observed in C. melo ssp. agrestis, and the highest Fst value was between C. melo ssp. agrestis and C. melo ssp. melo. The findings provide a promising tool that can be used to accelerate breeding for durable resistance to PM.","Cui, Haonan; Ding, Zhuo; Fan, Chao; Zhu, Zicheng; Zhang, Hao; Gao, Peng; Luan, Feishi",Phytopathology,417,16

Recently, individual differences in behavior, such as exploration, were shown to be linked to how prone an individual may be to contrafreeload. In this work, our main objective was to test whether and how individual differences in range use of free-range broiler chickens (Gallus gallus domesticus) were related to the individual motivation to contrafreeload. We also verified whether other behavioral variations could relate to range use. To that aim, over three different periods (before range access, first weeks of range access, and last weeks of range access), chickens with different ranging levels (low and high rangers) were submitted to a contrafreeloading test and had different behaviors recorded (such as foraging, resting, locomotion) in their home environment. During the contrafreeloading test, chickens were conditioned to one chamber presenting a foraging substrate and mealworms, while in the other chamber, mealworms were freely available on the floor. During testing trials, chickens had access to both empty chambers, and the time spent in each chamber was quantified. On average, low rangers preferred the chamber where mealworms were easily accessible (without the foraging substrate), while high rangers preferred the chamber where mealworms were accessible with difficulty, showing greater contrafreeloading. Out of ten behaviors recorded in chickens' home environment, foraging was the only one that differed significantly between our two ranging groups, with low rangers foraging, on average, significantly less than high rangers. These results corroborate previous experiences suggesting that range use is probably linked to chickens' exploratory trait and suggest that individual differences in free-range broiler chickens are present even before range access. Increasing our knowledge of individual particularities is a necessary step to improve free-range chicken welfare on the farm.","Ferreira, Vitor Hugo Bessa; Simoni, Arthur; Germain, Karine; Leterrier, Christine; Lansade, Léa; Collin, Anne; Mignon-Grasteau, Sandrine; Le Bihan-Duval, Elisabeth; Guettier, Elodie; Leruste, Hélène; Calandreau, Ludovic; Guesdon, Vanessa",Sci Rep,417,20

In pathological conditions, HSP60 can be translocated from the mitochondria and excreted from the cell. In turn, the extracellular HSP60 has a strong ability to trigger and enhance inflammatory response with marked pro-inflammatory cytokine induction, which is mainly mediated by toll-like receptors binding. Previous studies have found increased circulating levels of HSP60 in hypertensive patients, as well as enhanced HSP60 expression and membrane translocation in the hypertrophic myocardium. These observations are of particular interest as they could provide a possible pathophysiological explanation of the severe course and worse outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection in hypertensive patients, repeatedly reported during recent COVID-19 pandemic, and related to hyperinflammatory response and cytokine storm development during the third phase of the disease. In this regard, pharmacological inhibition of HSP60 could attract attention to potentially ameliorate inappropriate inflammatory reaction in severe COVID-19 patients. Among HSP60 antagonizing drugs, mizoribine is the most intriguing, since it is clinically approved and exerts antiviral activity.

The economic impact of such disruptions in vascular surgery services on vascular surgeons in India is unclear. This study aims to understand the economic impact of COVID-19 pandemic on vascular surgeons practicing in India. Materials and Methods: A questionnaire consisting of 15 questions was created using Google Forms and circulated through E-mail and WhatsApp groups dedicated to vascular surgeons in practice and/or training in India and was available for 2 weeks. Only vascular surgeons who are currently practicing in India were eligible to participate in the study. Results: One hundred and eighty-four out of 400 (46%) members that are thought to be currently practicing or in training in India participated in the study. 98.91% completed all the questions. 90.2% (n = 166) of the respondents were aged below the retirement age of 60. Thirty-four worked in government job, 89 in private sector on salary basis, and 58 in private sector as fee for service. Seventy-one percent of the respondents (including trainees) reported a negative impact on their monthly income due to COVID-19 pandemic ranging from 10% to 90%. Seventy-six percent of the respondents believed that there will be a further negative impact in the coming few months. Sixty-nine percent claimed that they did not have alternative sources of income. 82.6% were not aware of measures to overcome such adverse economic impact and have not taken any preventive steps or measures. Conclusion: The results of the study show that COVID-19 pandemic had a significant negative economic impact on majority of the vascular surgeons practicing in India resulting in a 50% or more reduction in their income. Skills and knowledge about financial resources, financial resilience, and risk management are needed to prevent or overcome future crisis.","Gupta, P.

Spatial hodographs, showing the distribution of the field magnitude and orientation, allow the adjustment of interactions and can be an extremely potent tool for prospective experiments, but remain unstudied systematically. Here, we calculate the tunable interactions between spherical particles in rhodonea, conical, cylindrical, and ellipsoidal field hodographs, as the most experimentally important cases. We discovered that spatial hodographs are reduced to each other, providing a plethora of interactions, e.g., repulsive, attractive, barrier-like, and double-scale repulsive ones. Complementing the ""magic"" conical angle, the ""magic"" compression and ellipticity of cylindrical and ellipsoidal hodographs are introduced. In the ""magic"" hodographs, the interactions become spatially isotropic and attain dispersion-force-like asymptotic (the same for pairwise and many-body energies), being attractive or repulsive, if the particle permittivity is larger or smaller than that of the solvent.

Here, we aimed to explore the functional role of circRNA itchy E3 ubiquitin protein ligase (circITCH) in the development and doxorubicin (DXR) resistance of OS and the possible mechanistic pathway. METHODS: Quantitative real-time PCR or western blot assays were exploited to analyze the expression of circITCH, miR-524 and Ras association domain family member 6 (RASSF6). Cell viability and half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) value of DXR were monitored by Cell Counting Kit-8 assay. Cell migration, invasion and apoptosis were determined via transwell assay and flow cytometry. The target interaction among circITCH, miR-524 and RASSF6 was validated by dual-luciferase reporter assay and RNA immunoprecipitation assay. A xenograft model of MG-63/DXR cells stably expressing circITCH in nude mice was established for assessing the role of circITCH in vivo. RESULTS: Downregulation of circITCH and RASSF6, as well as the upregulation of miR-524 were revealed in OS by study of 40 paired OS tissue and normal tissue samples. Overexpression of circITCH lowered the cell viability, IC50 value of DXR, migration and invasion, while facilitated apoptosis of OS cells. CircITCH sponged miR-524 to upregulate RASSF6, causing OS progression inhibition and DXR resistance reduction. Additionally, circITCH upregulation reduced tumor growth in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: Transduction with circITCH represses OS progression and promotes DXR sensitivity by the miR-524/RASSF6 axis, providing a new perspective for therapeutic intervention.","Zhou, Wei; Liu, Yuan; Wu, Xuejian",J Gene Med,417,13

Till date, no pharmaceutical agent is known to manage in terms of prevention and treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the disease caused by a novel virus. AIMS: The aim of the present work was to understand the underlying disease profile and dynamics that could provide relevant inputs and insight into pathophysiology and prevent further spread and evolve management strategies of COVID-19 patients from data-driven techniques. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: A retrospective observational descriptive study was conducted on 29 COVID-19 patients admitted at a premier medical institution of North India in the months of February and March 2020. METHODS: The patients were diagnosed with reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction test. Demographic, clinical, and laboratory data were collected. RESULTS: The mean age of population was 38.8 years with male preponderance, of which two patients were residents of Italy, and others hailed from semi-arid and Western sandy arid regions of Rajasthan (urban population). The major presenting symptom complex of said COVID-19 sample population included fever (48%), cough (31%), and shortness of breath (17%). Most of the patients (83%) had no comorbidity. No clinical correlation (r) could be appreciated between the duration of test positivity and age of afflicted COVID-19 patients (r = -0.0976).

There has been little investigation into its influence on the multifaceted aspects of postgraduate medical training, which feeds into how trainees consider themselves professionally and the concept of professional identity or 'being a doctor'. A review of the medical, socio-political and educational literature reveals that the impact on the professional identity development of trainees is influenced by several perspectives from the trainee, trainer and the public. Gross reduction in working hours has no doubt decreased the raw volume of clinical experiences. However, to counteract this, smarter learning processes have evolved, including narrative reflection, supervised learning events, and a greater awareness of coaching and training among trainers.","Mukherjee, Soumya; Meacock, James; Kissane, Eleanor; Pal, Debasish",Br J Hosp Med (Lond),417,26

IPV screening and intervention are an integral part of the care provided to women veterans in the Veteran's Health Administration (VHA). Current changes in healthcare delivery during COVID-19 may present challenges to the VHA's standard methods of initiating IPV screening and intervention with women veterans. We discuss the potential challenges VHA healthcare providers may be encountering when conducting routine IPV screening during the COVID-19 pandemic and when providing resources and support to women veterans experiencing IPV. We describe solutions to these challenges, including existing efforts led by the VHA IPV Assistance Program (IPVAP) as well as additional potential solutions. New ideas and partnerships will be critical for helping the VHA continue to assist women veterans experiencing IPV as the COVID-19 pandemic evolves.

Given the person-to-person spread of COVID-19 through respiratory droplets, law enforcement officers are also at a heightened risk of exposure due to their close contact with members of the public. To protect officers, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and other agencies have made numerous recommendations for law enforcement agencies to protect officers and the public. Departments around the country have responded to the pandemic in various ways, such as reassigning personnel to high-traffic areas, suspending training, roll calls, and community outreach initiatives, only issuing citations for low-level crimes, implementing safety precautions for officers, and limiting access to department facilities. The COVID-19 pandemic also has exposed some key obstacles for law enforcement, related to communication, resource management, the enforcement of public health restrictions, and changes to crime and service patterns. Based on these early/initial responses and obstacles during the COVID-19 outbreak, the current paper highlights directions for future responses to pandemics to ensure the safety and security of police officers and the communities they serve.","Jennings, Wesley G; Perez, Nicholas M",Am J Crim Justice,417,20

METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study conducted from March 9 to June 9, 2020 in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso which involved 456 patients with COVID-19. RESULTS: Nearly a quarter of the patients (23.2%) had presented with acute respiratory distress and 44.3% of them died. Being over 65 years old (HR: 2.7; 95% CI: 1.5-5.1) and having hypertension (HR: 1.9; 95% CI: 1-3.5) were independently associated with the risk of mortality. However, after adjustment, only age over 65 years (HR: 2.3; 95% CI: 1.2-4.3) was a risk factor for death. The survival rate for patients over 65 was 38.5% at 7 days and 30.3% at 15 days.

Methods: In this case series, we review patients diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 undergoing lumbar puncture (LP) admitted to Columbia University Irving Medical Center (New York, NY, USA) from March 1 to May 26, 2020. In a subset of patients, CSF SARS-CoV-2 quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) testing is performed. Results: The average age of 27 patients who underwent LP with definitive SARS-CoV-2 (SD) was 37.5 (28.7) years. CSF profiles showed elevated white blood cell counts and protein in 44% and 52% of patients, respectively. LP results impacted treatment decisions in 10 (37%) patients, either by change of antibiotics, influence in disposition decision, or by providing an alternative diagnosis. CSF SARS-CoV-2 qRT-PCR was performed on 8 (30%) patients, with negative results in all samples. Conclusions: Among patients diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2, CSF results changed treatment decisions or disposition in over one-third of our patient cohort. CSF was frequently abnormal, though CSF SARS-CoV-2 qRT-PCR was negative in all samples. Further studies are required to define whether CSF SARS-CoV-2 testing is warranted in certain clinical contexts.","Miller, Emily Happy; Namale, Vivian S; Kim, Carla; Dugue, Rachelle; Waldrop, Greer; Ciryam, Prajwal; Chong, Alexander M; Zucker, Jason; Miller, Eliza C; Bain, Jennifer M; Willey, Joshua Z; Doyle, Kevin; Boehme, Amelia; Claassen, Jan; Uhlemann, Anne-Catrin; Thakur, Kiran T",Open Forum Infect Dis,417,3

Most current advanced face recognition approaches are designed based on deep learning, which depend on a large number of face samples. However, at present, there are no publicly available masked face recognition datasets. Compared to other datasets, Real-world Masked Face Recognition Dataset (RMFRD) is currently the world's largest real-world masked face dataset.

Interventions to alleviate the psychological impact of the pandemic are urgently needed. Whether mindfulness practice may protect against the harmful emotional effects of a pandemic crisis remains hitherto unknown. We investigated the influence of mindfulness training on mental health during the COVID-19 outbreak in China. We hypothesized that mindfulness practitioners might manifest less pandemic-related distress, depression, anxiety, and stress than non-practitioners and that more frequent practice would be associated with an improvement in mental health during the pandemic. Therefore, we assessed pandemic-related distress and symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress, as well as the frequency of meditation practice at the peak of new infections (Feb 4-5; N = 673) and three weeks later (Feb 29-30; N = 521) in mindfulness practitioners via online questionnaires. Self-reported symptoms were also collected from non-practitioners at peak time only (N = 1550). We found lower scores of pandemic-related distress in mindfulness practitioners compared to non-practitioners. In general, older participants showed fewer symptoms of depression and anxiety. In younger practitioners, pandemic-related distress decreased from peak to follow-up. Importantly, increased mindfulness training during the preceding two weeks was associated with lower scores of depression and anxiety at both assessments. Likewise, practice frequency predicted individual improvement in scores of depression, anxiety, and stress at follow-up. Our results indicate that mindfulness meditation might be a viable low-cost intervention to mitigate the psychological impact of the COVID-19 crisis and future pandemics.","Zhu, Julie Lei; Schülke, Rasmus; Vatansever, Deniz; Xi, Dayou; Yan, Junjie; Zhao, Hanqing; Xie, Xiaohua; Feng, Jianfeng; Chen, Mark Yuting; Sahakian, Barbara Jacquelyn; Wang, Shouyan",Transl Psychiatry,417,16

It has been suggested that menopause, and the change in hormones during menopausal transition, influences the development of these disorders. During menopausal transition, not only the hormone levels change, but also metabolism and inflammatory responses. Investigating the influence of menopausal changes, including protein change, on the development of degenerative disorders is difficult, because these changes occur slowly. However, identifying these changes is crucial to develop novel female-specific prevention strategies and therapies for these disorders. Therefore, we propose the use of an unique and novel human model to investigate the influence of menopause on the development of degenerative disorders by modelling a “sudden menopause”, in which we expect that menopausal-related changes will occur faster: the Females discontinuing Oral Contraceptives Use at Menopausal age (FOCUM) model. This model does not have the limitations in generalizability of animal models. Nor does it have the limitations of subsequent hormonal support, malignancy and its associated treatments that are pertinent to human models with a sudden menopause caused by ovariectomy.The aim of our study is to develop the FOCUM model as a disease model for the development of OA. We want to identify when changes, especially in proteins, occur after a “sudden menopause” and which of these changes are associated with the development of OA after two years. Furthermore, we want to explore if the model can also be used to learn more about the development of cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, osteoporosis and tendinopathies. In this abstract we will report on the feasibility of our inclusion. Our aim is to include 50 female participants from the general population in and nearby Rotterdam within one year. Methods: Our study design is a pilot observational prospective cohort study with two years of follow-up. Our main questions for this pilot study are: will the inclusion of participants be feasible and what are the important time points to find changes in proteins? Females between 50 and 60 years of age, who are currently using a combined oral contraceptive and started oral contraceptive use before the age of 45, are recruited from pharmacies and (if necessary) general practices. In general, females are advised to stop oral contraceptive use at the age of 52. Females who are willing to stop oral contraceptive use at short term are invited to participate. Different measurements are performed before (T0 = 0 to 30 days) and after (T1 = 6 weeks;T2 = 6 months;T3 = 1 year;T4 = 2 years) stopping oral contraceptive use. At every time point of measurements a questionnaire is filled in, a normal photograph of both hands is taken and a sample of blood is drawn to measure hormones, proteins, glucose, cholesterol, DNA-methylation and immunological aspects of cells. At the first and final time point of measurements, also a physical examination, an radiograph of both hands, an MRI scan of one knee, a DXA-scan, and an ultrasound tissue characterization of one Achilles tendon are performed. To establish which time points of measurements are most relevant to find changes in proteins after hormone change, we will examine changes in serum levels of approximately 150 different inflammation and cardiometabolic related proteins by using the Olink-technology at different time points of measurements. At the first stage of this study, we will use the Principal Component Analysis on the change in protein levels over time. Thereafter, we will test for the association between principal components and hormone change. At the second stage of this study, we will relate these principal components to various OA outcomes. Results: In January 2020, we sent invitations to 108 local pharmacies to participate in this study. At that time, a total of 55 pharmacies were willing to participate. The participating pharmacies were asked to search in their own information system to identify all possible eligible subjects, based on age and oral contraceptive use, and to send an invitation letter in their name to these subjects. Unfortunately, due to COVID restrictions we started sending these invitation letters by the end of June 2020, four months later than planned. Until now, we have sent 534 invitations from 26 pharmacies to possible eligible subjects. A total of 107 females replied positively and gave permission to provide them more information about the study. After giving information and screening for in- and exclusion criteria, we now have 25 eligible participants who gave informed consent. Of them, 16 participants have had their first (baseline) measurements of 2,5 hours at the Erasmus MC. With the 29 participating pharmacies left, we expect to reach the targeted number of 50 inclusions by February 2021 and to report about the first stage of this study. Conclusions: At this time, we have included half of our study population. So the inclusion of 50 female participants for this study within one year seems to be feasible. By performing different measurements before and after stopping oral contraceptive use, we will be able to investigate when and which menopausal changes occur and which of these changes can be related to OA. With this model we hope to learn more about the influence of menopause on the development of OA, but also of cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, osteoporosis and tendinopathies, in order to develop new prevention strategies and therapies for these diseases.","Molendijk, E.; Schiphof, D.; Oei, E.; Waarsing, E.; de Vos, R.

To address this shortage, many have looked to the agility and accessibility of additive manufacturing (AM) systems to provide a democratized, decentralized solution to producing respirators with equivalent protection for last-resort measures. However, there are concerns about the viability and safety in deploying this localized download, print, and wear strategy due to a lack of commensurate quality assurance processes. Many open-source respirator designs for AM indicate that they do not provide N95-equivalent protection (filtering 95% of SARS-CoV-2 particles) because they have either not passed aerosol generation tests or not been tested. Few studies have quantified particle transmission through respirator designs outside of the filter medium. This is concerning because several polymer-based AM processes produce porous parts, and inherent process variation between printers and materials also threaten the integrity of tolerances and seals within the printed respirator assembly. No study has isolated these failure mechanisms specifically for respirators. The goal of this paper is to measure particle transmission through printed respirators of different designs, materials, and AM processes. The authors compare the performance of printed respirators to N95 respirators and cloth masks. Respirators in this study printed using desktop- and industrial-scale fused filament fabrication processes and industrial-scale powder bed fusion processes were not sufficiently reliable for widespread distribution and local production of N95-type respiratory protection. Even while assuming a perfect seal between the respirator and the user's face, although a few respirators provided >90% efficiency at the 100-300 nm particle range, almost all printed respirators provided <60% filtration efficiency. Post-processing procedures including cleaning, sealing surfaces, and reinforcing the filter cap seal generally improved performance, but the printed respirators showed similar performance to various cloth masks. The authors further explore the process-driven aspects leading to low filtration efficiency. Although the design/printer/material combination dictates the AM respirator performance, the identified failure modes originate from system-level constraints and are therefore generalizable across multiple AM processes. Quantifying the limitations of AM in producing N95-type respiratory protective masks advances understanding of AM systems toward the development of better part and machine designs to meet the needs of reliable, functional, end-use parts.","Bezek, Lindsey B; Pan, Jin; Harb, Charbel; Zawaski, Callie E; Molla, Bemnet; Kubalak, Joseph R; Marr, Linsey C; Williams, Christopher B",,417,16

Our team treated hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, where the outbreak first began, and we suspected that SARS-CoV-2 may cause testicular infection in male patients. We conducted this study to explore that observation. METHODS: We enrolled male patients with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 and performed a bedside ultrasound (US) examination of the scrotum, focused on findings of acute inflammation such as tunica albuginea thickening, enlargement and heterogeneous echogenicity of the testis, epididymis, or both, an abscess, scrotal wall edema, and hydrocele. Then we compared the proportions of observed epididymo-orchitis in patients from different age groups and COVID-19 severity groups. RESULTS: A total of 142 patients with COVID-19 were enrolled in our study, and 32 (22.5%) patients had acute orchitis, epididymitis, or epididymo-orchitis on scrotal US imaging, according to the diagnosis criteria. The observed risk of acute scrotal infection increased with age, with the incidence reaching 53.3% in men older than 80 years. We also observed that men with severe COVID-19 had a significantly higher possibility of epididymo-orchitis compared to the nonsevere COVID-19 group (P = .037).

The mt-sDNA test outperformed FOBT in detecting CRC with a sensitivity of 90.0% (45/50) vs. 42.0% (21/50), advanced adenoma with a sensitivity of 70.6% (36/51) vs. 19.6% (10/51), stage I-III CRC with a sensitivity of 91.9% (34/37) vs. 29.7% (11/37), and stage IV CRC with a sensitivity of 84.6% (11/13) vs. 76.9% (10/13). In addition, the mt-sDNA test exhibited a specificity of 94.0% (47/50) in detecting CRC, which was superior to FOBT with a specificity of 90.0% (45/50). Therefore, the mt-sDNA test may have higher sensitivity and specificity compared with FOBT in diagnosing both CRC and advanced adenoma.","Yang, Cuiping; Wu, Wei; Yang, Yanping; Yang, Xiaojin; Sun, Jing; Zhang, Weiyu; Liu, Kun; Ying, Haifeng; Jiang, Songyao; Yu, Xiaojun; Shi, Yiqing; Zhou, Yufen; Zhu, Shiyan; Xu, Ying; Ding, Yanfei; Xie, Ling; Cai, Boer; Xin, Xiaorong; Chen, Ping; Zhao, Ren; Wu, Yunlin",Oncol Lett,417,16

METHODS: This institutional review board-approved, retrospective study assessed all patients with diagnostic radiology examinations performed at an academic medical center with eight affiliated outpatient facilities before (January 1, 2020, to March 8, 2020) and after (June 7, 2020, to July 15, 2020) the COVID-19 shutdown. Examinations during the shut down (March 9, 2020, to June 6, 2020) were excluded. Patient-specific factors (eg, race, ethnicity), imaging modalities, and care settings were extracted from the Research Data Warehouse. Primary outcome was the number of diagnostic radiology examinations per day compared pre- and post-COVID-19 shutdown. Univariate analysis and multivariable logistic regression determined features associated with completing an examination. RESULTS: Despite resumption of nonurgent services, marked decrease in radiology examination utilization persisted in all care settings post-COVID-19 shutdown (869 examinations per day preshutdown [59,080 examinations in 68 days] versus 502 examinations per day postshutdown [19,594 examinations in 39 days]), with more significantly decreased odds ratios for having examinations in inpatient and outpatient settings versus in the emergency department. Inequities worsened, with patients from communities with high rates of poverty, unemployment, and chronic disease having significantly lower odds of undergoing radiology examinations post-COVID-19 shutdown. Patients of Asian race and Hispanic ethnicity had significantly lower odds ratios for having examinations post-COVID-19 shutdown compared with White and non-Hispanic patients, respectively. DISCUSSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated known pre-existing inequities in diagnostic radiology utilization. Resources should be allocated to address subgroups of patients who may be less likely to receive necessary diagnostic radiology examinations, potentially leading to compromised patient safety and quality of care.","Lacson, Ronilda; Shi, Junzi; Kapoor, Neena; Eappen, Sunil; Boland, Giles W; Khorasani, Ramin",J.

This almost instantaneous mass shift to teaching online has made transparent great disparities in how digital competences -- particularly those of teachers -- were conceptualized, taught and assessed within various educational programs. We present a comparative analysis of the approaches to teachers' learning and professional development that state and non-state actors in four Central and East European countries have articulated in the first months of COVID-19 related lockdown. We take a Critical Frame Analysis approach to exploring the roles played by state and non-state actors in the four countries in conceptually framing the relationship between the digital competences required in emergency remote teaching and teachers' learning and professional development at the beginning of the COVID-19 crisis. It is suggested that the educational policy debate at the beginning of the crisis rendered visible: (a) that this massive sudden shift required understanding digitalization as a complex multifaceted process requiring levels of digital and pedagogical competence teachers were unlikely to have previously developed;(b) that addressing these issues through short-term interventions would only exacerbate the risk of ignoring arising equity issues;(c) that situating emergency measures in the context of potential medium and long-term developments could open opportunities to explore mainstreaming the digitalization of education and promoting blended learning, as well as offer a better perspective on issues of digital poverty and the inequitable impact of not addressing it adequately will have in the future.","Mitescu-Manea, Mihaela Safta-Zecheria Leyla Neumann Eszter Bodrug-Lungu Valentina Milenkova Valentina Lendzhova Vladislava",Journal of Educational Sciences,417,23

COVID-19 has caused more than 1 million deaths worldwide and about 50 million infected. COVID-19 not only causes lung injury, but there may also be an involvement of other organs, including the cardiovascular system. SARS-CoV-2 penetrates host cells through the angiotensin 2 conversion enzyme (ACE-2). ACE-2 is expressed in the lungs, heart, testicles, liver, gastrointestinal tract, etc. Several studies have found that a sizeable percentage of patients with severe COVID-19 also have cardiac lesions, including myocardial fibrosis, edema, and pericarditis. Pathological remodeling of the extracellular matrix caused by SARS-CoV-2 leads to fibrotic lesions of myocardial tissue. These fibrotic lesions can cause cardiac dysfunction, reducing the ejection fraction caused by the presence of stiffened myocardial matrix and leading to heart failure, or cause an alteration in electrical conductance by creating cardiac arrhythmias. These cardiac dysfunctions can be fatal if left untreated and managed. It is therefore essential to identify cardiac involvement early in order to act with appropriate treatments to preserve the integrity of the heart. In this review, we describe what is known about cardiac damage from COVID-19, including the scientific rationale for effective therapeutic solutions to combat cardiac injury, and reduce or avoid cardiac damage from COVID-19.","Ferrara, Francesco; Vitiello, Antonio",Discov Med,417,1

Concerns include potential side effects caused by the antigen itself and safety of viral DNA and RNA delivery vectors. The large SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein is the main target of current COVID-19 vaccine candidates but can induce non-neutralizing antibodies, which might cause vaccination-induced complications or enhancement of COVID-19 disease. Besides, encoding of a functional S in replication-competent virus vector vaccines may result in the emergence of viruses with altered or expanded tropism. Here, we have developed a safe single round rhabdovirus replicon vaccine platform for enhanced presentation of the S receptor-binding domain (RBD). Structure-guided design was employed to build a chimeric minispike comprising the globular RBD linked to a transmembrane stem-anchor sequence derived from rabies virus (RABV) glycoprotein (G). Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and RABV replicons encoding the minispike not only allowed expression of the antigen at the cell surface but also incorporation into the envelope of secreted non-infectious particles, thus combining classic vector-driven antigen expression and particulate virus-like particle (VLP) presentation. A single dose of a prototype replicon vaccine complemented with VSV G, VSV&#916;G-minispike-eGFP (G), stimulated high titers of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies in mice, equivalent to those found in COVID-19 patients, and protected transgenic K18-hACE2 mice from COVID-19-like disease. Homologous boost immunization further enhanced virus neutralizing activity. The results demonstrate that non-spreading rhabdovirus RNA replicons expressing minispike proteins represent effective and safe alternatives to vaccination approaches using replication-competent viruses and/or the entire S antigen.","Hennrich, Alexandru A; Sawatsky, Bevan; Santos-Mandujano, Rosalía; Banda, Dominic H; Oberhuber, Martina; Schopf, Anika; Pfaffinger, Verena; Wittwer, Kevin; Riedel, Christiane; Pfaller, Christian K; Conzelmann, Karl-Klaus",PLoS Pathog,417,16

Inflammasomes, once activated, promote caspase-1-mediated maturation and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, interleukin (IL)-1ß and IL-18, leading to pyroptosis. Current advances in inflammasome research support their involvement in the development of chronic inflammatory disorders in contrast to their role in regulating innate immunity. Cannabis (marijuana) is a natural product obtained from the Cannabis sativa plant, and pharmacologically active ingredients of the plant are referred to as cannabinoids. Cannabinoids and cannabis extracts have recently emerged as promising novel drugs for chronic medical conditions. Growing evidence indicates the potent anti-inflammatory potential of cannabinoids, especially &#916;9-tetrahydrocannabinol (&#916;9-THC), cannabidiol (CBD), and synthetic cannabinoids; however, the mechanisms remain unclear. Several attempts have been made to decipher the role of cannabinoids in modulating inflammasome signaling in the etiology of chronic inflammatory diseases.

No approved/proper therapeutics is currently available which can effectively combat this outbreak. Several attempts have been undertaken in the search of effective drugs to control the spread of SARS CoV-2 infection. The main protease (Mpro), key component for the cleavage of the viral polyprotein, is considered to be one of the important drug targets for treating COVID-19. Various phytochemicals, including polyphenols and alkaloids, have been proposed as potent inhibitors of Mpro. The alkaloids from leaf extracts of Justicia adhatoda have also been reported to possess anti-viral activity. But whether these alkaloids exhibit any inhibitory effect on SARS CoV-2 Mpro is far from clear. To explore this in detail, we have adopted computational approaches. Justicia adhatoda alkaloids possessing proper drug-likeness properties and two anti-HIV drugs (lopinavir and darunavir; having binding affinity -7.3 to -7.4 kcal/mol) were docked against SARS CoV-2 Mpro to study their binding properties. Only one alkaloid (anisotine) had interaction with both the catalytic residues (His41 and Cys145) of Mpro and exhibited good binding affinity (-7.9 kcal/mol). Molecular dynamic simulations (100 ns) revealed that Mpro-anisotine complex is more stable, conformationally less fluctuated; slightly less compact and marginally expanded than Mpro-darunavir/lopinavir complex. Even the number of intermolecular H-bonds and MM-GBSA analysis suggested that anisotine is a more potent Mpro inhibitor than the two previously recommended antiviral drugs (lopinavir and darunavir) and may evolve as a promising anti-COVID-19 drug if proven in animal experiments and on patients.","Ghosh, Rajesh; Chakraborty, Ayon; Biswas, Ashis; Chowdhuri, Snehasis",J Mol Struct,417,10

Here we deploy a new measurement framework to investigate the scientific response to the COVID-19 pandemic and the adaptability of science as a whole. We find that science rapidly shifted to engage COVID-19 following the advent of the virus, with scientists across all fields making large jumps from their prior research streams. However, this adaptive response reveals a pervasive""pivot penalty"", where the impact of the new research steeply declines the further the scientists move from their prior work. The pivot penalty is severe amidst COVID-19 research, but it is not unique to COVID-19. Rather it applies nearly universally across the sciences, and has been growing in magnitude over the past five decades. While further features condition pivoting, including a scientist's career stage, prior expertise and impact, collaborative scale, the use of new coauthors, and funding, we find that the pivot penalty persists and remains substantial regardless of these features, suggesting the pivot penalty acts as a fundamental friction that governs science's ability to adapt. The pivot penalty not only holds key implications for the design of the scientific system and human capacity to confront emergent challenges through scientific advance, but may also be relevant to other social and economic systems, where shifting to meet new demands is central to survival and success.","Hill, Ryan; Yin, Yian; Stein, Carolyn; Wang, Dashun; Jones, Benjamin F.",,417,20

Kerala reported the maximum number of infections during PLD whereas Maharashtra had the highest numbers during all LD and UL phases. Eighty percent of the cases in India were concentrated mainly in highly populous districts. CONCLUSION: The top 25 districts accounted for 70.99%, 69.38%, 54.87%, 44.23%, 40.48%, and 38.96% of the infections from the start of UL1.0 until the end of UL phases, respectively, and the top 26-50 districts accounted for 6.38%, 6.76%, 11.23%, 12.98%, 13.40%, and 13.61% of cases in these phase, thereby indicating that COVID-19 cases spread during the UL period. By October 31, 2020, Delhi had the highest number of infections, followed by Bengaluru Urban, Pune, Mumbai, Thane, and Chennai. No decline in the infection rate occurred, even in UL5.0, thereby indicating a highly alarming situation in India.","Gangwar, Hari Shankar; Ray, P K Champati",Int J Infect Dis,417,29

Herein the non-clinical toxicity, in in vivo and in vitro tests, of dichloromethane crude extract of Pterodon pubescens fruits (PPE) and vouacapan diterpene furan isomer´s mixture (1:1) 6&#945;-hydroxy-7ß-acetoxy-vouacapan-17ß-oate methyl ester and 6&#945;-acetoxy-7ß-hydroxy-vouacapan-17ß-oate methyl ester isomers (VDFI mixture) is reported. Toxicological evaluation of 110-day repeated dose oral toxicity study, as hematological, biochemical, and histopathological parameters demonstrated that animals (male and female Wistar rats) treated with PPE presented no signs of toxicity, nevertheless daily high dose administration (500 mg/Kg) altered the metabolic homeostasis of animals that manifested microgoticular hepatic steatosis. Biochemical and histopathological results of animals (female Swiss mice) treated daily with VDFI mixture, at the highest dose (300 mg/Kg), indicated liver toxicity in one animal causing acute hepatotoxicity. Alkaline Comet assay demonstrated that PPE and VDFI mixture increased the percentage of DNA fragmentation without interfering with the tail moment parameter, but only VDFI mixture (30 µg/mL) presented statistical difference. In the micronucleus induction test, PPE and VDFI mixture did not demonstrate mutagenic potential. Our data provide evidence for the safety use of PPE and VDFI mixture in lower doses enabling further clinical studies and the development of herbal medicine.","Souza, Vanessa Helena da Silva; Basting, Rosanna Tarkany; Sousa, Ilza Maria de Oliveira; Queiroz, Núbia de Cássia Almeida; Carvalho, João Ernesto de; Foglio, Mary Ann",Drug Chem Toxicol,417,30

This study presents a peri-urban requalification experience, conducted in Milan, Italy, where, within the European funded project OpenAgri, eight agri-food start-ups began their activities in a peri-urban area at the southern gates of the city. The study aims to assess and evaluate these start-ups’ sustainability using the Sustainability Assessment of Food and Agriculture systems (SAFA), which considers four sustainability pillars: Good governance, economic resilience, environmental integrity and social well-being. The application of SAFA indicators to the eight start-ups revealed their positive aspects and some limitations, typical of some not structured enterprises. The research describes a scalable and replicable example of peri-urban agriculture’s potentiality in solving environmental, social and economic issues and tests FAO’s SAFA framework, which is still unexplored in this sustainability assessment context.","Vaglia, Valentina Spigarolo Roberto Bocchi Stefano",Land,417,16

After the start of the severe acute respiratory syndrome, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) developed guidelines to prevent the spread of infection. This study evaluated the impact of COVID-19 and the KCDC guideline on the conduct of clinical research in Korea. The purpose was to develop recommendations on how to minimize the risk of infection while enabling subjects to take part in the trials if no better alternative treatment options were available. METHODS: The impact on subject's scheduled visits and major milestones of clinical trials in Korea were measured by conducting a survey among clinical project manager (CPMs) working at global clinical research organization. The policy on monitor's access to hospital and site initiation meetings was investigated through correspondence with clinical trial center of 39 hospitals. The Top 25 pharmaceutical companies' official press and public clinical trial registry database were used to analyze companies' trial strategy during the pandemic and COVID-19 clinical research status, respectively. RESULTS: Of 85 CPMs, 12% reported that trial subjects' scheduled visits had been affected in their project. Monitors' access to hospital for source data verification was restricted at all sites in February 2020. Accordingly, 43% of 105 CPMs reported that the COVID-19 epidemic had an effect on study major milestones and data cleaning and database lock accounted for > 60% of milestones affected. In addition, 87% sites advised not to have site initiation meetings and 52% pharmaceutical companies suspended recruitment or new study start-up due to the pandemic. On the other hands, the number of COVID-19 related clinical trials increased rapidly in Korea and worldwide, with investigator-initiated trials accounting for 47% and 63% of all trials locally and globally, respectively. Most trials were phase 2 and were in the recruitment stage. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 and the KCDC guideline influenced all parties involved in clinical trials in Korea. In order to ensure the safety and well-being of trial subjects during the pandemic, new approaches are required for clinical trials to respond to the impact actively. Method of non-contact is developed to replace and supplement the face-to-face contact and alternatives to reduce the travel is introduced to decrease the risk of infection for all trial participants in whole trial process. The relevant regulations should be developed and the guidelines for foreign countries need to be adopted in accordance with the situation in Korea. COVID-19 trial is rapidly increasing worldwide and continuous support of health authorities, regulation, and facilities is required for developing the treatments with protecting all trial participants.","Jeon, JuYeun; Kim, Hyeikyoung; Yu, Kyung Sang",J Korean Med Sci,417,23

Purpose: To understand the psychological health status of healthcare workers during the COVID-19 outbreak and decline, and to provide a theoretical reference for the future establishment of a psychological crisis intervention system. Methods: Healthcare workers were recruited using convenience sampling and snowball sampling methods, and the electronic version of the SCL-90 scale and a sociodemographic questionnaire were administered. In the pretest, a total of 5018 responses were collected; after six weeks, random sampling was performed. The SCL-90 and measures of other epidemic-related problems were administered, with 1570 responses received; then, the final data analysis was performed. Results: After six weeks, the post-test GSI score; SCL-90 total score; and PST, PSDI, O-C, I-S, DEP, ANX, PHOB, PAR, PSY, and HOS scores were significantly lower than the corresponding pretest scores (p < 0.05). The results by occupational category showed that the scores of nursing staff decreased significantly for 12 indexes and that the scores of the doctors and other hospital staff also significantly decreased. There was a significant difference between the pretest (50.78 ± 28.18) and post-test (45.00 ± 28.49) scores for the degree of worry about the epidemic. Healthcare workers believed that the top three aspects of life affected by the epidemic were economic problems (816 people), interpersonal communication problems (731 people), and mental health (728 people). Conclusion: Over the course of the epidemic, the item scores generally declined significantly.

RESULTS: In 2117 participants (mean age 62.3 years, 58.2% females), rates of CMDs and depressive disorders did not significantly change over time, oscillating from 23.5% to 21.1%, and 3.3% to 2.8%, respectively; whereas rate of anxiety disorders significantly decreased (2008-2010: 13.8%; 2016-2018: 9.8%; 2020: 8%). There was a decrease along three wave-COVID assessments for depression [ß = -0.37, 99.5% confidence interval (CI) -0.50 to -0.23], anxiety (ß = -0.37, 99.5% CI -0.48 to -0.26), and stress (ß = -0.48, 99.5% CI -0.64 to -0.33) symptoms (all ps < 0.001). Younger age, female sex, lower educational level, non-white ethnicity, and previous psychiatric disorders were associated with increased odds for psychiatric disorders, whereas self-evaluated good health and good quality of relationships with decreased risk. CONCLUSION: No consistent evidence of pandemic-related worsening psychopathology in our cohort was found. Indeed, psychiatric symptoms slightly decreased along 2020. Risk factors representing socioeconomic disadvantages were associated with increased odds of psychiatric disorders.","Brunoni, André Russowsky; Suen, Paulo Jeng Chian; Bacchi, Pedro Starzynski; Razza, Lais Boralli; Klein, Izio; Dos Santos, Leonardo Afonso; de Souza Santos, Itamar; da Costa Lane Valiengo, Leandro; Gallucci-Neto, José; Moreno, Marina Lopes; Pinto, Bianca Silva; de Cássia Silva Félix, Larissa; de Sousa, Juliana Pereira; Viana, Maria Carmen; Forte, Pamela Marques; de Altisent Oliveira Cardoso, Marcia Cristina; Bittencourt, Marcio Sommer; Pelosof, Rebeca; de Siqueira, Luciana Lima; Fatori, Daniel; Bellini, Helena; Bueno, Priscila Vilela Silveira; Passos, Ives Cavalcante; Nunes, Maria Angelica; Salum, Giovanni Abrahão; Bauermeister, Sarah; Smoller, Jordan W; Lotufo, Paulo Andrade; Benseñor, Isabela Martins",Psychol Med,417,16

Recently, more than 50 cases have been reported presenting a combination of thrombosis, thrombocytopenia, and remarkably high levels of anti-platelet factor 4 (PF4)/polyanion antibodies post-AZD1222 vaccination. Now linked to the vaccine, the condition is referred to as vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia. The European Medicines Agency still recommends vaccination with AZD1222, but several European countries have temporally paused and/or restricted its use because of the perceived risk of this severe side effect. Because there is no description of PF4/polyanion antibody testing in the clinical trials, knowledge about the prevalence of such antibodies in a vaccinated cohort is needed. OBJECTIVES: To investigate prevalence of thrombocytopenia and anti-PF4/polyanion antibodies in a population recently vaccinated with AZD1222. PATIENTS/METHODS: Four hundred and ninety-two health care workers recently vaccinated with the first dose of AZD1222 were recruited from two hospitals in Norway. Study individuals were screened for thrombocytopenia and the presence of anti-PF4/polyanion antibodies with a PF4/PVS immunoassay. Side effects after vaccination were registered. RESULTS: The majority of study participants had normal platelet counts and negative immunoassay. Anti-PF4/polyanion antibodies without platelet activating properties were only detected in six individuals (optical density &#8805;0.4, range 0.58-1.16), all with normal platelet counts. No subjects had severe thrombocytopenia. CONCLUSIONS: We found low prevalence of both thrombocytopenia and antibodies to PF4/polyanion-complexes among Norwegian health care workers after vaccination with AZD1222.","Sørvoll, Ingvild Hausberg; Horvei, Kjersti Daae; Ernstsen, Siw Leiknes; Laegreid, Ingvild Jenssen; Lund, Svetlana; Grønli, Renathe Henriksen; Olsen, Magnus Kringstad; Jacobsen, Hege Karine; Eriksson, Anna; Halstensen, Anne Marie; Tjønnfjord, Eirik; Ghanima, Waleed; Ahlen, Maria Therese",J. thromb. haemost,417,29

To maximize efficacy, checkpoint inhibitors are often combined with cytotoxic agents. While this approach often leads to increased tumor regression, higher off target toxicity often results in certain patients. This report describes a novel formulation comprising a unique amphiphilic molecule, 8-((2-hydroxybenzoyl)amino)octanoate (SHAO), that non-covalently interacts with payloads to increase drug dispersion and diffusion when dosed intratumorally (IT) into solid tumors. SHAO is co-formulated with cisplatin and vinblastine (referred to as INT230-6). IT dosing of the novel formulation achieved greater tumor growth inhibition and improved survival in in vivo tumor models compared to the same drugs without enhancer given intravenously or IT. INT230-6 treatment increased immune infiltrating cells in injected tumors with 10% to 20% of the animals having complete responses and developing systemic immunity to the cancer. INT230-6 was also shown to be synergistic with programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) antibodies at improving survival and increasing complete responses. INT230-6 induced significant tumor necrosis potentially releasing antigens to induce the systemic immune-based anti-cancer attack. This research demonstrates a novel, local treatment approach for cancer that minimizes systemic toxicity while stimulating adaptive immunity.","Bender, Lewis H; Abbate, Franco; Walters, Ian B",,417,14

In this study, we performed single-cell transcriptomic sequencing of peripheral blood samples collected from six healthy controls and 14 COVID-19 samples including severe, moderate, and convalescent samples from three severely/critically ill and four moderately ill patients. We found that the monocytes were strongly remodeled in the severely/critically ill patients with COVID-19, with an increased proportion of monocytes and seriously reduced diversity. In addition, we discovered two novel severe-disease-specific monocyte subsets: Mono 0 and Mono 5. These subsets expressed amphiregulin (AREG), epiregulin (EREG), and cytokine interleukin-18 (IL-18) gene, exhibited an enriched erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog (ErbB) signaling pathway, and appeared to exhibit pro-fibrogenic and pro-inflammation characteristics. We also found metabolic changes in Mono 0 and Mono 5, including increased glycolysis/gluconeogenesis and an increased hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) signaling pathway. Notably, one pre-severe sample displayed a monocyte atlas similar to that of the severe/critical samples. In conclusion, our study discovered two novel severe-disease-specific monocyte subsets as potential predictors and therapeutic targets for severe COVID-19. Overall, this study provides potential predictors for severe disease and therapeutic targets for COVID-19 and thus provides a resource for further studies on COVID-19.","Zhang, Yan; Wang, Shuting; Xia, He; Guo, Jing; He, Kangxin; Huang, Chenjie; Luo, Rui; Chen, Yanfei; Xu, Kaijin; Gao, Hainv; Sheng, Jifang; Li, Lanjuan",,417,16

Some very low death rate settings such as Eastern Asia, Central Europe, the Balkans and Africa have a common feature of eating large quantities of fermented foods whose intake is associated with the activation of the Nrf2 (Nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2) anti-oxidant transcription factor. There are many Nrf2-interacting nutrients (berberine, curcumin, epigallocatechin gallate, genistein, quercetin, resveratrol, sulforaphane) that all act similarly to reduce insulin resistance, endothelial damage, lung injury and cytokine storm. They also act on the same mechanisms (mTOR: Mammalian target of rapamycin, PPARÎ³:Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor, NF&#954;B: Nuclear factor kappa B, ERK: Extracellular signal-regulated kinases and eIF2&#945;:Elongation initiation factor 2&#945;). They may as a result be important in mitigating the severity of COVID-19, acting through the endoplasmic reticulum stress or ACE-Angiotensin-II-AT1R axis (AT1R) pathway. Many Nrf2-interacting nutrients are also interacting with TRPA1 and/or TRPV1. Interestingly, geographical areas with very low COVID-19 mortality are those with the lowest prevalence of obesity (Sub-Saharan Africa and Asia). It is tempting to propose that Nrf2-interacting foods and nutrients can re-balance insulin resistance and have a significant effect on COVID-19 severity. It is therefore possible that the intake of these foods may restore an optimal natural balance for the Nrf2 pathway and may be of interest in the mitigation of COVID-19 severity.","Bousquet, Jean; Cristol, Jean-Paul; Czarlewski, Wienczyslawa; Anto, Josep M; Martineau, Adrian; Haahtela, Tari; Fonseca, Susana C; Iaccarino, Guido; Blain, Hubert; Fiocchi, Alessandro; Canonica, G Walter; Fonseca, Joao A; Vidal, Alain; Choi, Hak-Jong; Kim, Hyun Ju; Le Moing, Vincent; Reynes, Jacques; Sheikh, Aziz; Akdis, Cezmi A; Zuberbier, Torsten",Clin Transl Allergy,417,16

Dietary habits changed rapidly in the last decades and few data are available on recent dietary changes in children and adolescents with T1D. OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that diet composition changed in a 10-year period in children and adolescents with T1D. METHODS: 229 T1D subjects (M/F:121/108) aged 6-16 years were recruited: 114 (group A) enrolled in 2009, not using CGM and/or CSII, and 115 (group B) enrolled in 2019. Anthropometric, biochemical (HbA1c, lipid profile), diet and insulin therapy parameters were compared between the two groups. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed with HbA1c as dependent variable (HbA1c > 58 mmol/mol = 1) and nutritional variables and technology use as independent ones. RESULTS: Energy intake of group A was not statistically different from that of group B. Group B had a significantly (p < 0.001) higher protein and lipids intake and lower total carbohydrate and fiber intake than group A. HbA1c was significantly (p < 0.01) lower in group B than in group A. Logistic regression analysis showed that MUFA (OR 0.83,95%CI:0.693-0.998), fiber intake (OR 0.82,95%CI:0.699-0.0969), and technology use (OR 0.15,95%CI:0.031-0.685), adjusted for age, gender, BMI, energy intake and diabetes duration, were were associated with a HbA1c higher than 58 mmol/mol) (R2 = 0.27, p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In a 10-year period, diet composition of children and adolescents with T1D changed and glucometabolic control improved. Fiber and MUFA intake showed a positive effect on HbA1c, independent from technology use, supporting the importance of educating children with T1D and families to maintain healthy eating habits.

Due to the way SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted, endoscopy rooms and endoscopic procedures are an easy source of dissemination, as they fulfill the different characteristics of a contaminated environment for patients and healthcare personnel involved in endoscopic procedures. It is of great importance to establish measures within endoscopy units to prevent and reduce the risk of spreading this infection, creating a safe environment that protects patients and health personnel. A Pubmed search was performed with the following terms: (“COVID-19” OR “coronavirus” OR “SARS-Cov-2”) and (“gastrointestinal” OR “transmission” OR “intestinal” OR “digestive” OR “endoscopy “OR” esophagogastroduodenoscopy “OR” colonoscopy “).

PURPOSE: to provide an updated view regarding the early experience obtained from the management of KTRs with COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A narrative review was conducted using PubMed database to identify relevant articles written in English/Spanish, and published through May 15, 2020. Search terms included: ""coronavirus"", ""severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2"", ""SARS-CoV-2"", ""COVID-19"", ""COVID"", ""renal transplantation"", and ""kidney transplantation"". Case series were considered eligible, and case reports excluded. Thirty-four articles were included in the review. RESULTS: KTRs should be considered immunocompromised hosts: potential risk for infection, non-negligible comorbidity, and exposure to long-term immunosuppression. Only single center small retrospective experiences are still available regarding KTRs with COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 symptoms in KTRs are similar to that observed for the general population, being fever and cough the most frequently observed. Mild-to-moderate symptomatic KTRs can be managed in an outpatient setting, while patients exhibiting severe symptoms must be addmited to hospital. More rapid clinical progression, and higher complication and death rates have been observed for hospitalized KTRs, requiring hemodyalisis or ventilatory support. Lymphopenia, elevated serum markers (C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, IL-6, D-dimer), and chest-X-ray findings consistent with pneumonia are linked to worse prognosis. A number of antiviral therapies have been used. However, it is difficult to draw meaningful conclusions regarding their efficacy at this point. Baseline immunosupression regimen should be adjusted in a case-by-case manner. However, it poses a significant challenge.","González, Javier; Ciancio, Gaetano",Int Braz J Urol,417,16

So far, four cataract-causing mutants G18V, D26G, S39C and V42 M have been identified for human Î³S-crystallin. Mysteriously, lens maintains ATP concentrations of 3-7 mM despite being a metabolically-quiescent organ. Here by DSF and NMR, we characterized the binding of ATP to three cataract-causing mutants of human Î³S-crystallin as well as its effect on the solution conformations and thermal stability. The results together decode several novel findings: 1) ATP shows no detectable binding to WT and mutants, as well as no significant alternation of their conformations even at molar ratio of 1:200.2) Cataract-causing mutants show distinctive patterns of the crowding-induced destabilization. 3) ATP differentially antagonizes their crowding-induced destabilization. Our studies suggest that the crowding-induced destabilization of human Î³S-crystallin is also critically dependent of the hydration shell which could be differentially altered by four mutations. Most unexpectedly, ATP acts as an effective mediator for the protein hydration shell to antagonize the crowding-induced destabilization.","He, Yuan; Kang, Jian; Song, Jianxing",Biochem. biophys. res. commun,417,20

Compared with the results of the classical time series model, the uncertain time series model could better describe the COVID-19 epidemic by using an uncertain hypothesis test to filter out outliers. This improvement is reflected in the two observations. One is that the estimated variance of the disturbance term in the uncertain time series model is more appropriate and acceptable than that in the classical time series model, and the other is that the disturbance term of the classical time series model cannot be regarded as a random variable but as an uncertain variable.","Ye, Tingqing; Yang, Xiangfeng",Fuzzy Optim.

Objective: To estimate the association between administration of corticosteroids compared with usual care or placebo and 28-day all-cause mortality. Design, Setting, and Participants: Prospective meta-analysis that pooled data from 7 randomized clinical trials that evaluated the efficacy of corticosteroids in 1703 critically ill patients with COVID-19. The trials were conducted in 12 countries from February 26, 2020, to June 9, 2020, and the date of final follow-up was July 6, 2020. Pooled data were aggregated from the individual trials, overall, and in predefined subgroups. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Assessment Tool. Inconsistency among trial results was assessed using the I2 statistic. The primary analysis was an inverse variance-weighted fixed-effect meta-analysis of overall mortality, with the association between the intervention and mortality quantified using odds ratios (ORs). Random-effects meta-analyses also were conducted (with the Paule-Mandel estimate of heterogeneity and the Hartung-Knapp adjustment) and an inverse variance-weighted fixed-effect analysis using risk ratios. Exposures: Patients had been randomized to receive systemic dexamethasone, hydrocortisone, or methylprednisolone (678 patients) or to receive usual care or placebo (1025 patients). Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome measure was all-cause mortality at 28 days after randomization. A secondary outcome was investigator-defined serious adverse events. Results: A total of 1703 patients (median age, 60 years [interquartile range, 52-68 years]; 488 [29%] women) were included in the analysis. Risk of bias was assessed as ""low"" for 6 of the 7 mortality results and as ""some concerns"" in 1 trial because of the randomization method. Five trials reported mortality at 28 days, 1 trial at 21 days, and 1 trial at 30 days. There were 222 deaths among the 678 patients randomized to corticosteroids and 425 deaths among the 1025 patients randomized to usual care or placebo (summary OR, 0.66 [95% CI, 0.53-0.82]; P < .001 based on a fixed-effect meta-analysis). There was little inconsistency between the trial results (I2 = 15.6%; P = .31 for heterogeneity) and the summary OR was 0.70 (95% CI, 0.48-1.01; P = .053) based on the random-effects meta-analysis. The fixed-effect summary OR for the association with mortality was 0.64 (95% CI, 0.50-0.82; P < .001) for dexamethasone compared with usual care or placebo (3 trials, 1282 patients, and 527 deaths), the OR was 0.69 (95% CI, 0.43-1.12; P = .13) for hydrocortisone (3 trials, 374 patients, and 94 deaths), and the OR was 0.91 (95% CI, 0.29-2.87; P = .87) for methylprednisolone (1 trial, 47 patients, and 26 deaths). Among the 6 trials that reported serious adverse events, 64 events occurred among 354 patients randomized to corticosteroids and 80 events occurred among 342 patients randomized to usual care or placebo. Conclusions and Relevance: In this prospective meta-analysis of clinical trials of critically ill patients with COVID-19, administration of systemic corticosteroids, compared with usual care or placebo, was associated with lower 28-day all-cause mortality.","Sterne, Jonathan A C; Murthy, Srinivas; Diaz, Janet V; Slutsky, Arthur S; Villar, Jesús; Angus, Derek C; Annane, Djillali; Azevedo, Luciano Cesar Pontes; Berwanger, Otavio; Cavalcanti, Alexandre B; Dequin, Pierre-Francois; Du, Bin; Emberson, Jonathan; Fisher, David; Giraudeau, Bruno; Gordon, Anthony C; Granholm, Anders; Green, Cameron; Haynes, Richard; Heming, Nicholas; Higgins, Julian P T; Horby, Peter; Jüni, Peter; Landray, Martin J; Le Gouge, Amelie; Leclerc, Marie; Lim, Wei Shen; Machado, Flávia R; McArthur, Colin; Meziani, Ferhat; Møller, Morten Hylander; Perner, Anders; Petersen, Marie Warrer; Savovic, Jelena; Tomazini, Bruno; Veiga, Viviane C; Webb, Steve; Marshall, John C",JAMA,417,5

Given the nation-wide spread of the coronavirus in major Japanese cities and the rapid increase in the number of cases with untraceable infection routes, large-scale monitoring for capturing the current epidemiological situation of COVID-19 in Japan is urgently required. Methods: A chatbot-based healthcare system named COOPERA (COvid-19: Operation for Personalized Empowerment to Render smart prevention And AN care seeking) was developed to surveil the Japanese epidemiological situation in real-time. COOPERA asked questions regarding personal information, location, preventive actions, COVID-19 related symptoms and their residence. Empirical Bayes estimates of the age-sex-standardized incidence rate and disease mapping approach using scan statistics were utilized to identify the geographical distribution of the symptoms in Tokyo and their spatial correlation r with the identified COVID-19 cases. Findings: We analyzed 353,010 participants from Tokyo recruited from 27th March to 6th April 2020. The mean (SD) age of participants was 42.7 (12.3), and 63.4%, 36.4% or 0.2% were female, male, or others, respectively. 95.6% of participants had no subjective symptoms. We identified several geographical clusters with high spatial correlation (r = 0.9), especially in downtown areas in central Tokyo such as Shibuya and Shinjuku. Interpretation: With the global spread of COVID-19, medical resources are being depleted. A new system to monitor the epidemiological situation, COOPERA, can provide insights to assist political decision to tackle the epidemic. In addition, given that Japan has not had a strong lockdown policy to weaken the spread of the infection, our result would be useful for preparing for the second wave in other countries during the next flu season without a strong lockdown.

AKI was diagnosed using the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcome (KDIGO) classification based on serum creatinine (SCr) criteria. Persistent and Transient AKI were defined according to the Acute Disease Quality Initiative (ADQI) workgroup definitions. RESULTS: In this cohort of COVID-19 patients, 55.2% developed AKI (n=106). The majority of AKI patients had persistent AKI (n=64, 60.4%). Overall, in-hospital mortality was 18.2% (n=35) and was higher in AKI patients (28.3% vs 5.9%, p<0.001, unadjusted OR 6.03 (2.22-16.37), p<0.001). In this multivariate analysis, older age (adjusted OR 1.07 (95% CI 1.02-1.11), p=0.004), lower Hb level (adjusted OR 0.78 (95% CI 0.60-0.98), p=0.035), duration of AKI (adjusted OR 7.34 for persistent AKI (95% CI 2.37-22.72), p=0.001) and severity of AKI (adjusted OR 2.65 per increase in KDIGO stage (95% CI 1.32-5.33), p=0.006) were independent predictors of mortality. CONCLUSION: AKI was frequent in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Persistent AKI and higher severity of AKI were independent predictors of in-hospital mortality.","Gameiro, Joana; Agapito Fonseca, José; Oliveira, João; Marques, Filipe; Bernardo, João; Costa, Claudia; Carreiro, Carolina; Braz, Sandra; António Lopes, José",,417,16

They caused a large number of casualties and a wider psychological crisis, which might cause severe consequences such as post-traumatic stress disorder and suicide. AIMS: To reveal the law of formation of public psychological crisis in public health emergencies, and draw lessons from it. To provide ideas for effectively deal with these psychological crisis problems and fundamentally curbing the occurrence of public health emergencies. METHOD: Through the method of literature research, 'public health incidents', 'psychological crisis', 'mental health', 'psychological intervention', 'SARS', 'H1N1', 'MERS', 'EVD', and 'COVID-19' were used to search literatures in the databases such as PubMed, Springer, and Sciencedirect, and the literatures were summarized, sorted, and studied. RESULTS: (1) The public health emergencies caused a universal psychological crisis. The main manifestations were depression, compulsion, despair, etc. The people involved mainly include patients, suspected isolated patients, medical staff, and the general public in the epidemic situation. (2) People's psychological state often experienced stress stage, shock stage, acceptance, and reorganization. Only some susceptible individuals couldn't complete effective psychological reconstruction, resulting in serious psychological disorders. Individual susceptibility is related to genetic factors, adversity, and traumatic stimuli experienced in early life. CONCLUSION: To reduce these psychological crisis problems, we should establish and improve the psychological crisis intervention or rescue system of public health emergencies, it was still necessary to live in harmony with nature, get rid of the inappropriate habit of preying on wild animals, in order to prevent the cross-species transmission of the virus between wild animals and humans, and to fundamentally avoid the occurrence of major infectious diseases.","Wang, Zhifeng; Wang, Dongmei",Int J Soc Psychiatry,417,22

The aim of this study was to investigate whether hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) blocks autophagy and promotes apoptosis of the prostate after castration. METHODS: Thirty-six male SD rats were randomly divided into 3 groups (n = 12): control group (sham operation), castration group, and HCQ group (castrated and treated with HCQ). On day 7, all mice were executed and prostates were isolated. The morphological changes of prostates were observed by light microscope, and the ultrastructure changes were observed under scanning electron microscope (SEM). The protein expression of Beclin-l, P62, caspase-3, Bcl-2, and Bax was assessed by immunohistochemical analyses. The mRNA expression of microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3) and autophagy-related gene 5 (Atg5) was detected by RT-PCR. RESULTS: Prostates of castration group shrank remarkably and prostates of HCQ group shrank more remarkably than castration group. Cytolysosomes were visible in the prostates of the castration group under SEM. Immunohistochemistry showed that the protein of Beclin-1 increased in the castration group compared to the control group, while decreased in the HCQ group compared to the castration group. While P62 protein moderately dyed in the control group and weakly dyed in the castration group, it strongly dyed in the HCQ group. Caspase-3 and Bax protein were weakly dyed in the control group but moderately dyed in the castration group and strongly dyed in the HCQ group. The expressions of apoptosis suppressor Bcl-2 were reduced in the castration group and further reduced in the HCQ group compared to the castration group. RT-PCR revealed that the mRNA of LC3 and Atg5 in the castration group increased compared to the control group, while decreased after treated with HCQ. CONCLUSION: Autophagy increased after castrated in prostates, while decreased after treated with HCQ; all these indicated that HCQ blocked autophagy and then promoted prostate apoptosis of castrated mice.","Ling, Sheng-Tao; Deng, Chun-Lei; Huang, Li; Yao, Qi-Sheng; Liu, Cui; Sun, Chuan-Tao; Wang, Li; Yang, Yong; Gong, Xiao-Xin; Chen, Cong-Bo",Urol Int,417,18

'Dead-on-farm'(DOF) broilers from 145 commercial flocks were investigated at two different time points (TP1:7-14 and TP2:28-35 days of age); per sampling, 6-10 DOF broilers were selected for post-mortem investigation and gross pathomorphological changes were assessed, in total from 2,717 birds. Post-mortem findings were substantiated by bacteriological, virological and parasitological investigations. Furthermore, production data of all flocks were collected and used to perform comprehensive statistical analysis. Overall, colibacillosis was found most important with a significant negative impact on flock health, productivity and profitability through all ages of broiler production. At TP1, primary reasons for mortality comprised yolk sac infections, generally found together with fibrinous polyserositis due to E. coli. Furthermore, femoral lesions, which correlated with increased flock mortality, were associated with detection of E. coli. At TP2, ascites was detected frequently in DOF broilers, correlating with increased production losses in the 4th and 5th week of life. No etiological link between the presence of ascites and the detection of the investigated pathogens was observed.A positive correlation was noticed between the prevalence of ascites within flocks and the sea level of the farm, and with the sex of the birds. These disease conditions could not be linked with the housing system. Presence of Infectious Bronchitis virus, avian reovirus and fowl adenovirus did not correlate with macroscopic lesions or a specific disease. Research Highlights ï· In young broilers lesions of visceral organs due to bacterial infections dominated. ï· Colibacillosis impacts broiler health, productivity and profitability independent of the age of birds. ï· Disorders of the locomotor system were frequently observed throughout production. ï· Older broilers frequently showed pathologic changes due to metabolic disorders. ï· Overall, a shift from infectious towards metabolic disease conditions was noticed.","Grafl, Beatrice; Gaußmann, Barbara; Sulejmanovic, Tarik; Hess, Claudia; Hess, Michael",Avian Pathol,417,1

Understanding the level of public attention-a prerequisite for effective communication-implicates expensive and time-consuming surveys. We hypothesise that the relative search volume from Google Trends could be used as an indicator of public attention of a disease and its prevention measures. The search terms 'RKI' (Robert Koch Institute, national public health authority in Germany), 'corona' and 'protective mask' in German language were shortlisted. Cross-correlations between these terms and the reported cases from 15 February to 27 April were conducted for each German federal state. The findings were contrasted against a timeline of official communications concerning COVID-19. The highest correlations of the term 'RKI' with reported COVID-19 cases were found between lags of - 2 and - 12 days, meaning web searches were already performed from 2 to 12 days before case numbers increased. A similar pattern was seen for the term 'corona'. Cross-correlations indicated that most searches on 'protective mask' were performed from 6 to 12 days after the peak of cases. The results for the term 'protective mask' indicate a degree of confusion in the population. This is supported by conflicting recommendations to wear face masks during the first wave. The relative search volumes could be a useful tool to provide timely and location-specific information on public attention for risk communication.","Kristensen, Kaja; Lorenz, Eva; May, Jürgen; Strauss, Ricardo",Sci Rep,417,2

Lymphoma patients may be especially vulnerable, due to the immunodeficiency and immune dysregulation caused by the lymphoma itself and the antitumor treatments. This study describes the characteristics and outcomes of lymphoma patients after developing COVID-19. Methods: This is a retrospective multicentre study carried out in the hospitals of the GELTAMO group, which included patients with a histological diagnosis of lymphoma and confirmed SARS-COV-2 infection before June 30th, 2020. The primary outcome was overall survival (OS) 60 days after a COVID-19 diagnosis. Results: A total of 218 patients (median sage 69.5 [21-94] years, 54% male) were included;100 patients had an indolent B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), 67 aggressive B-cell NHL, 19 mantlecell lymphoma, 15 peripheral T-cell lymphoma, and 17 Hodgkin's lymphoma. Patients had received a median of 1 line (0-7) of therapy, and 44.9% were on active treatment at the time of COVID-19 diagnosis. Only 6.4%, 1.8% and 0.9% of patients had received previously autologous stem-cell transplantation, allogeneic SCT and CAR-T cell therapy, respectively. 89% of patients were hospitalized, 71% required oxygen, and 15% mechanical ventilation. With a median follow-up of 91.5 days (13-203), 65 patients have died (60 from COVID-19, 4 from lymphoma, 1 due to other causes), with an estimated 60-day OS of 68.6% (95% CI 62.1-75.1) (figure 1A). In univariate analysis, baseline characteristics associated with decreased OS were age ≥70 years, hypertension, diabetes, other cancer, active disease and hypogammaglobulinemia, but only age ≥70 years maintained independent influence in the multivariate analysis (HR 3.29, 95% CI 1.86-5.83, p &lt; 0.001). Active treatment did not significantly impact OS (figure 1B). Univariate analysis revealed different prognostic factors, apart from age, for patients with DLBCL (N = 60) and FL (N = 69). While the presence of active disease had a prognostic impact on DLBCL (60-day OS 56% vs 79%, p = 0.038) but not on FL (60-day OS 65% vs 78%, p = 0.181) patients, the opposite occurred in the case of active treatment, which seemed to have a negative influence only in patients with FL, as shown in figures 1C and 1D. Conclusions: Our results confirm a high mortality in patients with lymphoma and COVID-19, especially in those ≥70 years old. In patients with DLBCL, disease control seems essential to reduce the risk of mortality in the event of contracting the infection. By contrast, in patients with FL, delaying the start of treatment until it is not strictly necessary should be considered, and these patients should be prioritized to be vaccinated before starting antitumor treatment. This study provides initial data to develop recommendations for the management of lymphoma patients during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Martín García-Sancho, A.; Izuzquiza, M.; Bastos-Oreiro, M.; Baile, M.; Nistal, S.; Cortés, M.; Jiménez-Ubieto, A.; Rey Búa, B.; Guillén-García, H.; Cannata-Ortiz, J.; Novelli, S.; Gómez-Roncero, M.

This article focuses on the recent emergence of the 'Planetary Health' paradigm. Launched by the Rockefeller Foundation and the medical journal The Lancet, Planetary Health is one of the most ambitious attempts in recent years to systematize global health in the Anthropocene. While recognising the interest and necessity of reflecting on human health and the health of the planet, this article aims to show, however, that the Planetary Health paradigm is problematic and aporetic for two reasons. First, because it is based on a scientistic and depoliticised conception of the Anthropocene, which obscures capitalism's responsibility for the contemporary global and, especially, ecological crisis. Second, because this conception leads to a promotion of solutions that are essentially based on the financialization and technoscientific management of the living world - precisely the underlying cause of the degradation of ecosystems and living conditions that created the Anthropocene in the first place.

So far the researchers worldwide have not been able to discover a breakthrough in the form of a potent drug or an effective vaccine. Therefore, it is imperative to discover drugs to curb the ongoing menace. In silico approaches using FDA approved drugs can expedite the drug discovery process by providing leads that can be pursued. In this report, two drug targets, namely the spike protein and main protease, belonging to structural and non-structural class of proteins respectively, were utilized to carry out drug repurposing based screening. The exposed nature of the spike protein on the viral surface along with its instrumental role in host infection and the involvement of main protease in processing of polyproteins along with no human homologue make these proteins attractive drug targets. Interestingly, the screening identified a common high efficiency binding molecule named rutin. Further, molecular dynamics simulations in explicit solvent affirmed the stable and sturdy binding of rutin with these proteins. The decreased Rg value (4 nm for spike-rutin and 2.23 nm for main protease-rutin) and stagnant SASA analysis (485 nm/S2/N in spike-rutin and 152 nm/S2/N in main protease-rutin) for protein surface and its orientation in the exposed and buried regions suggests a strong binding interaction of the drug. Further, cluster analysis and secondary structure analysis of complex trajectories validated the conformational changes due to binding of rutin.","Kumari, Anchala; Rajput, Vikrant Singh; Nagpal, Priya; Kukrety, Himanshi; Grover, Sonam; Grover, Abhinav",J Biomol Struct Dyn,417,1

However, the mechanisms of phosphorylation-based signaling networks during mild early-life stress remain elusive. Herein, we systematically analyzed the phosphoproteomes of Caenorhabditis elegans, which were treated with three mild temperatures (15 °C, 20 °C, and 25 °C) in two different short-term groups (10 min and 60 min). By utilizing an iTRAQ-based quantitative phosphoproteomic approach, 18,187 phosphosites from 3330 phosphoproteins were detected in this study. Volcano plots illustrated that the phosphorylation abundance of 374 proteins and 347 proteins, were significantly changed at 15 °C and 25 °C, respectively. Gene ontology, KEGG pathway and protein-protein interaction network analyses revealed that these phosphoproteins were primarily associated with metabolism, translation, development, and lifespan determination. A motif analysis of kinase substrates suggested that MAPK, CK, and CAMK were most likely involved in the adaption processes. Moreover, 16 and 14 aging-regulated proteins were found to undergo phosphorylation modifications under the mild stresses of 15 °C and 25 °C, respectively, indicating that these proteins might be important for maintaining long-term health. Further lifespan experiments confirmed that the candidate phosphoproteins, e.g., EGL-27 and XNP-1 modulated longevity at 15 °C, 20 °C, and 25 °C, and they showed increased tolerance to thermal and oxidative stresses. In conclusion, our findings offered data that supports understanding of the phosphorylation mechanisms involved in mild early-life stresses in C. elegans.

We aimed to describe the clinical presentation of COVID-19 among frail and nonfrail older hospitalised patients and to evaluate the potential association between frailty and clinical course, decision of treatment level with outcomes change in functional capacity and survival. METHODS: We performed a multi-center, retrospective cross-sectional cohort study examining data on clinical presentation and frailty-related domains for hospitalised people aged 75 + years with a positive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) test. Frailty was assessed at admission using record-based MPI (rMPI) and Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS). Decision on treatment level about invasive ventilation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), change in CFS-score from admission to discharge, changed need of home care, and in-hospital, 30-day and 90-day mortality were registered. RESULTS: 100 patients (median age 82 years (IQR 78-86), 56% female) with COVID-19 were included. 54 patients were assessed moderately or severely frail (rMPI-score = 2 or 3) and compared to non-frail (rMPI-score = 1). At admission, frail patients presented more frequently with confusion. At discharge, functional decline measured by change in CFS and increased home care was more prevalent among frail than the non-frail. Decisions about no invasive ventilation or CPR were more prevalent among frail older patients with COVID-19 than non-frail. Ninety-day mortality was 70% among frail patients versus 15% in non-frail. CONCLUSION: Frailty seems to be associated with confusion, more frequent decisions about treatment level, larger functional decline at discharge and a higher mortality rate among older patients with COVID-19.","Verholt, Ane Borgbjerg; Gregersen, Merete; Gonzalez-Bofill, Nuria; Hansen, Troels K; Ebdrup, Lotte; Foss, Catherine H; Lietzen, Lone Winther",,417,3

Urban Diabetes has arisen as a novel nosological entity in Medicine. Urbanization leads to the accrual of a number of factors increasing the vulnerability to diabetes mellitus and related diseases. Herein we report clinical-epidemiological data of the Milano Metropolitan Area in the contest of the Cities Changing Diabetes Program. Since the epidemiological picture was taken in January 2020, on the edge of COVID-19 outbreak in the Milano Metropolitan Area, a perspective addressing potential interactions between diabetes and obesity prevalence and COVID-19 outbreak, morbidity and mortality will be presented. To counteract lock-down isolation and, in general, social distancing a pilot study was conducted to assess the feasibility and efficacy of tele-monitoring via Flash Glucose control in a cohort of diabetic patients in ASST North Milano. METHODS: Data presented derive from 1. ISTAT (National Institute of Statistics of Italy), 2. Milano ATS web site (Health Agency of Metropolitan Milano Area), which entails five ASST (Health Agencies in the Territories). A pilot study was conducted in 65 screened diabetic patients (only 40 were enrolled in the study of those 36 were affected by type 2 diabetes and 4 were affected by type 1 diabetes) of ASST North Milano utilizing Flash Glucose Monitoring for 3 months (mean age 65 years, HbA1c 7,9%. Patients were subdivided in 3 groups using glycemic Variability Coefficient (VC): a. High risk, VC > 36, n. 8 patients; Intermediate risk 20 < VC < 36, n. 26 patients; Low risk VC < 20, n. 4 patients. The control group was constituted by 26 diabetic patients non utilizing Flash Glucose monitoring. RESULTS: In a total population of 3.227.264 (23% is over 65 y) there is an overall prevalence of 5.65% with a significant difference between Downtown ASST (5.31%) and peripheral ASST (ASST North Milano, 6.8%). Obesity and overweight account for a prevalence of 7.8% and 27.7%, respectively, in Milano Metropolitan Area. We found a linear relationship (R = 0.36) between prevalence of diabetes and aging index. Similarly, correlations between diabetes prevalence and both older people depending index and structural dependence index (R = 0.75 and R = 0.93, respectively), were found. A positive correlation (R = 0.46) with percent of unoccupied people and diabetes prevalence was also found. A reverse relationship between diabetes prevalence and University level instruction rate was finally identified (R = - 0.82). Our preliminary study demonstrated a reduction of Glycated Hemoglobin (p = 0.047) at 3 months follow-up during the lock-down period, indicating Flash Glucose Monitoring and remote control as a potential methodology for diabetes management during COVID-19 lock-down. HYPOTHESIS AND DISCUSSION: The increase in diabetes and obesity prevalence in Milano Metropolitan Area, which took place over 30 years, is related to several environmental factors. We hypothesize that some of those factors may have also determined the high incidence and virulence of COVID-19 in the Milano area. Health Agencies of Milano Metropolitan Area are presently taking care of diabetic patients facing the new challenge of maintaining sustainable diabetes care costs in light of an increase in urban population and of the new life-style. The COVID-19 pandemic will modify the management of diabetic and obese patients permanently, via the implementation of approaches that entail telemedicine technology. The pilot study conducted during the lock-down period indicates an improvement of glucose control utilizing a remote glucose control system in the Milano Metropolitan Area, suggesting a wider utilization of similar methodologies during the present ""second wave"" lock-down.","Luzi, Livio; Carruba, Michele; Crialesi, Roberta; Da Empoli, Stefano; Dagani, Regina; Lovati, Elisabetta; Nicolucci, Antonio; Berra, Cesare C; Cipponeri, Elisa; Vaccaro, Ketty; Lenzi, Andrea",Acta diabetol,417,1

However, the clinical effects of IFN hyperactivity in DS remain undefined. Here, we report that a commonly used mouse model of DS overexpresses IFNR genes and shows hypersensitivity to IFN ligands in diverse immune cell types. When treated repeatedly with a TLR3 agonist to induce chronic inflammation, these animals overexpress key IFN-stimulated genes, induce cytokine production, exhibit liver pathology, and undergo rapid weight loss. Importantly, the lethal immune hypersensitivity and cytokine production and the ensuing pathology are ameliorated by JAK1 inhibition. These results indicate that individuals with DS may experience harmful hyperinflammation upon IFN-inducing immune stimuli, as observed during severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, pointing to JAK1 inhibition as a strategy to restore immune homeostasis in DS.","Tuttle, Kathryn D; Waugh, Katherine A; Araya, Paula; Minter, Ross; Orlicky, David J; Ludwig, Michael; Andrysik, Zdenek; Burchill, Matthew A; Tamburini, Beth A J; Sempeck, Colin; Smith, Keith; Granrath, Ross; Tracy, Dayna; Baxter, Jessica; Espinosa, Joaquin M; Sullivan, Kelly D",Cell Rep,417,20

Findings The accounting tools of governmentality are always incomplete. Sometimes unique situations and crises help us to revise and improve the tools we have. Other times, they demand entirely new tools. Research limitations/implications Accounting needs both things to count and a context to count them. In the case of food assistance, what is counted is people. In Turin's case, many people had never been counted - either because there was no need or because they were unaccounted for by choice. Now, the government was accountable for the welfare of both. Thus, new classification systems emerged, as did organisational and accounting solutions.

METHODS: We conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis using a Markov model from a United Kingdom NHS perspective, informed by published analyses of patient-level data. We assessed the cost-effectiveness of THA and TKA in adults with hip or knee osteoarthritis compared with having no arthroplasty surgery during the ten-year time horizon. RESULTS: THA and TKA cost < £7,000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained at all preoperative scores below the absolute referral thresholds calculated previously (40 for OHS and 41 for OKS). Furthermore, THA cost < £20,000/QALY for patients with OHS of &#8804; 45, while TKA was cost-effective for patients with OKS of &#8804; 43, since the small improvements in quality of life outweighed the cost of surgery and any subsequent revisions. Probabilistic and one-way sensitivity analyses demonstrated that there is little uncertainty around the conclusions. CONCLUSION: If society is willing to pay £20,000 per QALY gained, THA and TKA are cost-effective for nearly all patients who currently undergo surgery, including all patients at and above our calculated absolute referral thresholds.

Design/methodology/approach: Initially, a bibliographic research study was carried out to establish a theoretical background and contextualization. After analysing different kinds of documents, the authors of this viewpoint discussed potential COVID-19 impacts on the transition to Industry 4.0 in the Brazilian manufacturing sector. A multidisciplinary discursive approach was used in the debates. Findings: The COVID-19 pandemic will negatively influence the transition of Brazilian manufacturing sector to Industry 4.0. Despite the fact that some “World Class Companies” based in Brazil still continue the transition process towards the “Digital Revolution”, most of Brazilian manufacturing companies are postponing important initiatives related to Industry 4.0 due to uncertainties. In addition, policies promoting innovation are increasingly necessary. Practical implications: This viewpoint presents interesting implications for researchers and society. Researchers can use these reflections to structure surveys or case studies to better understand the aforementioned impacts on companies due to the pandemic.

While we must be vigilant about preventing unnecessary deaths caused by coronavirus outbreaks in nursing homes, some deaths of our elders are inevitable. Thus, it is essential that advanced care planning occurs in a way that upholds the familial and relational aspects of elders' lives that often matter to them the most. We invoke concepts from feminist ethicists like Hilde Lindemann and Eva Kittay and introduce Avery Weisman and Thomas Hackett's concept of ""appropriate death"" to suggest better ways of planning for those deaths of our elderly that cannot be avoided.

In this observational population-based study, we examined how psychological distress changed following the emergence of the COVID-19 crisis in the United States and tested whether certain population subgroups were vulnerable to persistent distress during the crisis. We analyzed longitudinal nationally representative data from eight waves of the Understanding America Study (UAS) collected between March 10th and July 20th, 2020 (N = 7319 Observations = 46,145). Differences in distress trends were examined by age, sex, race/ethnicity, and household income and by the presence of a pre-existing mental health diagnosis. Psychological distress was assessed using the standardized total score on the Patient Health Questionnaire-4 (PHQ-4). On average psychological distress increased significantly by 0.27 standard deviations (95% CI [0.23,0.31], p < .001) from March 10-18 to April 1-14, 2020 as the COVID-19 crisis emerged and lockdown restrictions began in the US. Distress levels subsequently declined to mid-March levels by June 2020 (d = -0.31, 95% CI [-0.34, -0.27], p < .001). Across the sociodemographic groups examined and those with pre-existing mental health conditions we observed a sharp rise in distress followed by a recovery to baseline distress levels. This study identified substantial increases in distress in the US during the emergence of the COVID-19 crisis that largely diminished in the weeks that followed and suggests that population level resilience in mental health may be occurring in response to the pandemic.","Daly, Michael; Robinson, Eric",J. psychiatr. res,417,16

STUDY DESIGN: Longitudinal descriptive study, comprised of three online surveys conducted between April to December, 2020. We recruited sites from email lists of national abortion and family planning organizations. RESULTS: Seventy-four sites opted to participate. We analyzed 55/74 sites (74%) that provided medication abortion and completed all three surveys. The total number of abortion encounters reported by the sites remained consistent throughout the study period, though medication abortion encounters increased while first-trimester aspiration abortion encounters decreased. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, sites reduced the number of in-person visits associated with medication abortion and confirmation of successful termination. In February 2020, considered prepandemic, 39/55 sites (71%) required 2 or more patient visits for a medication abortion. By April 2020, 19/55 sites (35%) reported reducing the total number of in-person visits associated with a medication abortion. As of October 2020, 37 sites indicated newly adopting a practice of offering medication abortion follow-up with no in-person visits. CONCLUSIONS: Sites quickly adopted protocols incorporating practices that are well-supported in the literature, including forgoing Rh-testing and pre-abortion ultrasound in some circumstances and relying on patient report of symptoms or home pregnancy tests to confirm successful completion of medication abortion. Importantly, these practices reduce face-to-face interactions and the opportunity for virus transmission. Sustaining these changes even after the public health crisis is over may increase patient access to abortion, and these impacts should be evaluated in future research. IMPLICATIONS STATEMENT: Medication abortion serves a critical function in maintaining access to abortion when there are limitations to in-person clinic visits. Sites throughout the country successfully and quickly adopted protocols that reduced visits associated with the abortion, reducing in-person screenings, relying on telehealth, and implementing remote follow-up.","Tschann, Mary; Ly, Elizabeth S; Hilliard, Sara; Lange, Hannah L H",Contraception,417,6

Patients on dialysis tend to have a reduced immune response to infection or vaccination. We aimed to assess, for the first time to the best of our knowledge, the humoral response following vaccination with the BNT162b2 vaccine in patients on maintenance hemodialysis and the factors associated with it. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: The study included 56 patients on maintenance hemodialysis (dialysis group) and a control group composed of 95 health care workers. All participants had received two doses of the BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) vaccine. The serology testing was done using Quant II IgG anti-Spike severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) assay by Abbott a median of 30 days after receipt of the second dose of the vaccine. RESULTS: All subjects in the control group developed an antibody response compared with 96% (54 of 56) positive responders in the dialysis group. The IgG levels in the dialysis group (median, 2900; interquartile range, 1128-5651) were significantly lower than in the control group (median, 7401; interquartile range, 3687-15,471). A Mann-Whitney U test indicated that this difference was statistically significant (U=1238; P<0.001). There was a significant inverse correlation of age and IgG levels in both groups. The odds of being in the lower quartile were significantly higher for older individuals (odds ratio, 1.11 per year of age; 95% confidence interval, 1.08 to 1.20; P=0.004) and for the dialysis group compared with the control group (odds ratio, 2.7; 95% confidence interval, 1.13 to 7.51; P=0.05). Within the dialysis group, older age and lower lymphocyte count were associated with antibody response in the lower quartile (odds ratio, 1.22 per 1-year older; 95% confidence interval, 1.13 to 1.68; P=0.03 and odds ratio, 0.83 per 10-e3/µl-higher lymphocyte count; 95% confidence interval, 0.58 to 0.97; P=0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Although most patients on maintenance hemodialysis developed a substantial humoral response following the BNT162b2 vaccine, it was significantly lower than controls. Age was an important factor in the humoral response, regardless of chronic medical conditions.","Grupper, Ayelet; Sharon, Nechama; Finn, Talya; Cohen, Regev; Israel, Meital; Agbaria, Amir; Rechavi, Yoav; Schwartz, Idit F; Schwartz, Doron; Lellouch, Yonatan; Shashar, Moshe",Clin. j. am. soc. nephrol,417,16

We conducted a survey to evaluate willingness-to-participate in COVID-19 vaccine trials in a population of HCWs at three hospitals in Uganda. METHODS: The survey was conducted between September and November 2020. Using a standardised questionnaire, data were collected on socio-demographics, previous participation in health research, COVID-19 information sources, underlying health conditions, and willingness-to-participate in COVID-19 vaccine trials. Data were analysed descriptively and a binomial generalised linear model with a log link function used to investigate factors associated with unwillingness to participate. RESULTS: 657 HCWs (female, 63%) were enrolled with a mean age of 33 years (Standard Deviation, 10). Overall willingness-to-participate was 70.2%. Key motivating factors for participation were: hope of being protected against COVID-19 (81.1%), altruism (73.3%), and the opportunity to get health care (26.0%). Selected hypothetical trial attributes reduced willingness-to-participate as follows: weekly-quarterly study visits over a 12-month period (70.2%-63.2%, P = 0.026); provision of approximately 50ml of blood at each study visit (70.2%-63.2%, P = 0.026); risk of mild-moderate local adverse reactions (70.2%-60.3%, P<0.001); chance of receiving candidate vaccine or placebo (70.2%-56.9%, P<0.001); and delay of pregnancy [Overall, 70.2%-57.1% P<0.001); Female, 62.8%-48.4% (P = 0.002); Male, 82.5%-71.5% (P = 0.003)]. Collectively, these attributes reduced willingness-to-participate from [70.2%-42.2% (P<0.001) overall; 82.5%-58.1% (P<0.001) in men; 62.8%-32.6% (P<0.001) in women]. Among individuals that were unwilling to participate, the commonest barriers were concerns over vaccine safety (54.6%) and fear of catching SARS-CoV-2 (31.6%). Unwillingness to participate was associated with being female (aRR 1.97, CI 1.46-2.67, P<0.001) and having university or other higher-level education (aRR 1.52, CI 1.05-2.2, P = 0.026). CONCLUSIONS: Willingness-to-participate in COVID-19 vaccine trials among HCWs in Uganda is high but may be affected by vaccine trial requirements and concerns about the safety of candidate vaccines.","Kitonsa, Jonathan; Kamacooko, Onesmus; Bahemuka, Ubaldo Mushabe; Kibengo, Freddie; Kakande, Ayoub; Wajja, Anne; Basajja, Vincent; Lumala, Alfred; Ssemwanga, Edward; Asaba, Robert; Mugisha, Joseph; Pierce, Benjamin F; Shattock, Robin; Kaleebu, Pontiano; Ruzagira, Eugene",PLoS One,417,19

Twenty percent of respondents considered stopping MAiD work. The CD Resilience Scale-2 mean score was 6.90. Highly scored protective factors included compassionate care, relief of suffering, patient autonomy, patient gratitude, feelings of honor, privilege, and professionally satisfying work. Discussion: The identified stressors and reasons for considering stopping MAiD work indicate needs for policy, education, and supports to be optimized or developed. Respondents showed high resilience and highly scored protective factors, which should be optimized. This survey should be repeated in countries where MAiD is legal to determine stressors and protective factors in MAiD practice, stressors addressed, and protective factors enhanced where feasible in the local context for optimal care.","Stewart, Donna E; Viens, Pierre; Muralidharan, Oviya; Kastanias, Patti; Dembo, Justine; Riazantseva, Ekaterina",J. palliat. med,417,26

This led to a reorganisation of oncology care in order to reduce the risk of spreading infection between patients and healthcare staff. Here we analysed measures taken in major oncological units in Europe and the USA. METHODS: A 46-item survey was sent by email to representatives of 30 oncological centres in 12 of the most affected countries. The survey inquired about preventive measures established to reduce virus spread, patient education and processes employed for risk reduction in each oncological unit. RESULTS: Investigators from 21 centres in 10 countries answered the survey between 10 April and 6 May 2020. A triage for patients with cancer before hospital or clinic visits was conducted by 90.5% of centres before consultations, 95.2% before day care admissions and in 100% of the cases before overnight hospitalisation by means of phone calls, interactive online platforms, swab test and/or chest CT scan. Permission for caregivers to attend clinic visits was limited in many centres, with some exceptions (ie, for non-autonomous patients, in the case of a new diagnosis, when bad news was expected and for terminally ill patients). With a variable delay period, the use of personal protective equipment was unanimously mandatory, and in many centres, only targeted clinical and instrumental examinations were performed. Telemedicine was implemented in 76.2% of the centres. Separated pathways for COVID-19-positive and COVID-19-negative patients were organised, with separate inpatient units and day care areas. Self-isolation was required for COVID-19-positive or symptomatic staff, while return to work policies required a negative swab test in 76.2% of the centres. CONCLUSION: Many pragmatic measures have been quickly implemented to deal with the health emergency linked to COVID-19, although the relative efficacy of each intervention should be further analysed in large observational studies.","Onesti, Concetta Elisa; Rugo, Hope S; Generali, Daniele; Peeters, Marc; Zaman, Khalil; Wildiers, Hans; Harbeck, Nadia; Martin, Miguel; Cristofanilli, Massimo; Cortes, Javier; Tjan-Heijnen, Vivianne; Hurvitz, Sara A; Berchem, Guy; Tagliamento, Marco; Campone, Mario; Bartsch, Rupert; De Placido, Sabino; Puglisi, Fabio; Rottey, Sylvie; Müller, Volkmar; Ruhstaller, Thomas; Machiels, Jean-Pascal; Conte, PierFranco; Awada, Ahmad; Jerusalem, Guy",,417,16

OBJECTIVES: We aimed to determine diffusion­weighted imaging (DWI) value to predict active CD and compare apparent diffusion coefficients (ADCs) with endoscopic and conventional indices of magnetic resonance imaging of CD activity. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Overall, 229 patients with suspected and diagnosed CD prospectively underwent magnetic resonance enterocolonography (MR­EC) with DWI sequence and ileocolonoscopy. The magnetic resonance activity index (MaRIA), Clermont index, and CD endoscopic index of severity (CDEIS) were calculated. RESULTS: The clinical diagnosis of CD was confirmed in 100 out of 229 patients. A DWI score of 2 or higher had 96.9% sensitivity and 82.3% specificity for diagnosing CD. A threshold ADC value of 1.3 × 10-3 mm2/s could distinguish between normal and inflamed bowel segments with a sensitivity of 73.8% and a specificity of 98%. For the MaRIA, a threshold ADC value of 1.32 × 10-3 mm2/s with a sensitivity of 97.9% and a specificity of 97.8% was established. There were significant differences in the DWI scores and ADC values comparing patients with inactive, mild, and moderate-to-severe disease (P <0.01). ADCs inversely correlated with the MaRIAglobal (r = -0.69; P = 0.001), Clermontglobal (r = -0.722; P = 0.001), and CDEIS (r = -0.69; P = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: DWI is a valuable tool that is capable of identifying inflamed bowel segments as accurately as the conventional MaRIA score and of discriminating between mild and moderate-to-severe CD.","Straksyte, Vestina; Kiudelis, Gediminas; Gineikiene, Irina; Basevicius, Algidas; Lukosevicius, Saulius; Kupcinskas, Limas",Pol Arch Intern Med,417,24

I begin with a critique of the lockdown policy of the right-wing Hindu nationalist government of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Prime Minister Narendra Modi, which served as a political spectacle rather than a public health intervention. I then proceed to detail how India as a lockdown nation witnessed forms of social suffering and political repression that can only be truly understood in light of how the trajectory and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic was shaped by two preexisting crises in India’s economy and polity. In conclusion, I reflect on the likely political outcomes of the pandemic, considering both the impact of its second wave, and the emergence of oppositional sociopolitical forces in the country.

Long non-protein-coding RNAs may possess significant cellular functions. Plasmacytoma variant translocation 1 (PVT1), a long non-coding RNA encoded by the human PVT1 gene, is an oncogene, which can regulate several tumor-related genes. In PCa, the function and mechanism of PVT1 are unclear. NOP2 is being pursued as a prognostic marker for cancer aggressiveness, which promotes mouse fibroblast growth and tumor formation. Essentially, nothing is known about the specific interactions between the PVT1 and NOP2. Methods: 190 pairs of PCa tissues and adjacent normal tissues were collected and RNA sequencing was used to identify the differential lncRNAs. Real-time quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) confirmed these results and gene regulatory relationship. Lentiviral vectors were used to alter PVT1 and genes to analyze their effects on PCa progression. Transwell migration and invasion assays were performed to test the metastasis ability. Biofunction of PVT1 and NOP2 were confirmed in vitro and in vivo. Results: In this study, we reported that the long noncoding RNA-PVT1 was upregulated in PCa metastasis tissues and promoted migration of PCa cells in vitro and their metastasis in vivo. High levels of PVT1 significantly downregulated tumor suppressor microRNAs (miRNAs), such as miR-15b-5p, miR-27a-3p, miR-143-3p, and miR-627-5p, whose levels in metastasis tissues were low compared to those in non-metastasis tissues. In vitro and in vivo, PVT1 promotes PCa metastasis via targeting miRNAs. Furthermore, the expression level of PVT1 was positively associated with the expression of NOP2, a cancer metastasis-related protein. We demonstrated that NOP2 promoted invasion and migration of PCa. For specific mechanism, correlation analysis showed that PVT1 promoted metastasis by up-regulating NOP2. Conclusion: Taken together, our results show that PVT1 acts as an inducer of PCa metastasis via targeting miRNAs, thereby promoting NOP2. This axis may have diagnostic and therapeutic potential for advanced PCa.","Sun, Feng; Wu, Ke; Yao, Zhixian; Mu, Xingyu; Zheng, Zhong; Sun, Menghao; Wang, Yong; Liu, Zhihong; Zhu, Yiyong",Onco Targets Ther,417,1

The purpose of this study was to examine survival characteristics in patients suffering torso trauma with no recorded vital signs (VS) in the emergency department (ED). METHODS: The National Trauma Data Bank was analyzed from 2007 to 2015. Inclusion criteria were patients with blunt and penetrating torso trauma without VS in the ED. Patients with head injuries, transfers from other hospitals, or those with missing values were excluded. The characteristics of survivors were evaluated, and statistical analyses performed. RESULTS: A total of 24,191 torso trauma patients without VS were evaluated in the ED and 96.6% were declared dead upon arrival. There were 246 survivors (1%), and 73 (0.3%) were eventually discharged home. Of patients who responded to resuscitation (812), the survival rate was 30.3%. Injury severity score (ISS), penetrating mechanism (odds ratio [OR] 1.99), definitive chest (OR 1.59) and abdominal surgery (OR 1.49) were associated with improved survival. Discharge to home (or police custody) was associated with lower ISS (OR 0.975) and shorter ED time (OR 0.99). CONCLUSION: Over a recent nine-year period in the United States, nearly 25,000 trauma patients were treated at trauma centers despite lack of VS. Of these patients, only 73 were discharged home. A trauma center would have to attempt over one hundred resuscitations of traumatic arrests to save one patient, confirming previous reports that highlight a grave prognosis. This creates a dilemma in treatment for front line workers and physicians with resource utilization and consideration of safety of exposure, particularly in the face of COVID-19.","Khalifa, Andrew; Avraham, Jacob B; Kramer, Kristina Z; Bajani, Francesco; Fu, Chih Yuan; Pires-Menard, Alexandra; Kaminsky, Matthew; Bokhari, Faran",Am J Emerg Med,417,30

We aimed to analyze the effect of vitamin D sufficiency on the clinical outcomes of patients infected with COVID-19. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study we analyzed the vitamin D levels of COVID-19 patients who were admitted to Razi Hospital (an infectious disease referral center in Mazandaran province in northern Iran) from February to March 2020. Overall, a cutoff point of 30 ng/mL was used for the definition of vitamin D sufficiency. RESULTS: One hundred fifty-three patients were analyzed in this study who had laboratory documentation of a 25(OH) D level at the time of hospitalization. The vitamin D levels of the patients were 27.19 ± 20.17 ng/mL. In total, 62.7% (n = 96) of the patients had a 25(OH) D level of less than 30 ng/mL and 37.25% (n = 57) had a 25(OH) D level of more than 30 ng/mL. In total, 49% (n = 75) of the patients suffered from at least one underlying disease. The univariate and multivariable regression showed that vitamin D sufficiency was not associated with a statistically significant lower risk of adverse clinical outcomes of COVID-19 such as duration of hospitalization and severity of infection (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Sufficient vitamin D levels were not found to be protective against adverse clinical outcomes in patients infected with COVID-19. Chronic disorders in COVID-19 patients were found to have greater relevance than vitamin D levels in determining the adverse outcomes of the infection. Further studies are needed to determine the role of vitamin D level in predicting the outcomes of COVID-19 infection.","Davoudi, Alireza; Najafi, Narges; Aarabi, Mohsen; Tayebi, Atefeh; Nikaeen, Roja; Izadyar, Hamideh; Salar, Zahra; Delavarian, Leila; Vaseghi, Narges; Daftarian, Zahra; Ahangarkani, Fatemeh",BMC Infect Dis,417,16

Objectives: The objective of the present work is to present the epidemiological variations in the production of fractures in the period of mandatory confinement in our reference population. Methods: Analytical retrospective comparative study of two groups of patients: Group A: patients admitted before the state of alarm that forced confinement in the period from January 13 to March 13 compared to Group B: patients admitted in the two months of confinement, until the de-escalation period began, March 13-May 13. Epidemiological variables including age, personal history, type of fracture, mechanism of injury, outpatient rate, and hospital stay were recorded. Results: A total of 190 patients were included. 112 in the pre-confinement period and 78 in the confinement (30% decrease). The mean age (p = 0.007) and falls at home (p < 0.001) were higher in the confinement group. The postoperative (p = 0.006) and overall (p < 0.001) hospital stay were significantly less in the confinement group.

OBJECTIVES: This study investigated reported mental health and changes in lifestyle practices among Jordanian mothers during COVID-19 quarantine. The specific objectives included studying the level of depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms and their potential statistical associations with demographic and lifestyle variables. Furthermore, the study aimed to investigate differences in mental health between different demographic and socio-economic groups and to examine the major lifestyle changes that occurred on mothers during the quarantine. METHODS: An online survey was developed and administered to 2103 mothers. Participants were asked to complete a sociodemographic data form, Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21), and a lifestyle section comparing the life of mothers before and during the quarantine. Reported scores of depression, anxiety, and stress were calculated and compared across different levels of demographics including income, education level, employment status, and city of residence. RESULTS: This study found that mothers with lower income, lower education, not employed, or living in cities outside the capital of Jordan reported having more depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms (p < .005). Changes in their lifestyle practices included weight gain, increased time allocated for teaching children at home, increased familial violence at home, and increased time allocated for caring for their family members (average increase of 5 hours daily).

It has raised questions about recognising and differentiating COVID-19 from COPD given the similarity of the symptoms. It is unclear whether COPD patients are at increased risk of becoming infected with SARS-CoV-2. During periods of high prevalence of COVID-19, spirometry should be used when essential for COPD diagnosis and/or to assess lung function status for interventional procedures or surgery. COPD patients should follow basic infection control measures including social distancing, hand washing and wearing a mask or face covering. Although data are limited, inhaled corticosteroids, long-acting bronchodilators, roflumilast, or chronic macrolides should continue to be used as indicated for stable COPD management. Systemic steroids and antibiotics should be used in COPD exacerbations according to the usual indications. Differentiating symptoms of COVID-19 infection from chronic underlying symptoms or those of an COPD exacerbation may be challenging. If there is suspicion for COVID-19, testing for SARS-CoV-2 should be considered. Patients who developed moderate to severe COVID-19, including hospitalization and pneumonia, should be treated with evolving pharmacotherapeutic approaches, as appropriate, including remdesivir, dexamethasone, and anticoagulation. Managing acute respiratory failure should include appropriate oxygen supplementation, prone positioning, noninvasive ventilation, and protective lung ventilation in patients with ARDS. Patients who develop mild COVID-19 should be followed as normal. Patients who developed moderate or worse COVID-19 should be monitored more frequently than normally with particular attention to the need for oxygen therapy.

METHODS: A retrospective observational study. Records of 142 patients and 11 staff members from a single retina clinic that were exposed to a COVID-19+ ophthalmologist were reviewed. All 153 individuals were placed in quarantine for 14 days. They were contacted after the quarantine period to inquire about symptoms consistent with COVID-19, and the results of diagnostic test for SARS-CoV-2 when performed. RESULTS: All patients (n = 142) were contacted successfully. The mean age was 72.8 ± 13.6 years; 54.2% (n = 77) were females. Twenty-three patients (16.2%) were exposed during an ophthalmic exam, 111 (78.2%) during intraocular injection, 4 (2.8%) underwent exam and injection, 3 (2.1%) underwent surgery, and one patient (0.7%) had laser photocoagulation. Half of the patients (50%; n = 71) were in contact with the COVID-19+ physician while he was symptomatic. Forty-four patients (31%) wore a mask on the day of their visit. 11.3% (n = 16) of the patients, and all involved staff had been tested for the virus and all were negative. One patient (0.7%) reported transient cough and sore throat, and the remaining 141 (99.3%) patients and 11 (100%) staff did not develop symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Low risk for SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the ophthalmic setting was observed when universal safety measures such as social distancing, meticulous hand hygiene, enlarged breath shields, and mask wear during procedures were taken.","Saban, Ori; Levy, Jaime; Chowers, Itay",Graefes Arch Clin Exp Ophthalmol,417,21

To embrace this opportunity requires the interpretation of our current situation as a real state of exception in which the neoliberal order and its utopian-learning culture can be suspended. In a state of suspension, one can begin thinking afresh about the Covid-19 pandemic and what reactions to and conversations about the event reveal about (more desirable) ways of learning and living together in schools and society.","Phelan, Anne M; Hansen, Dion Rüsselbæk",Prospects (Paris),417,10

CPS is considered one of the few systems of Parliament in application compared to other parliamentary systems and was often used by countries in times of crises experienced by them in an attempt to overcome those crises, given that this system limits the power of actual decision-making to the legislative authority. CPS can be distinguished from other parliamentary political systems both presidential and parliamentary through several things, the most prominent of which is based on the idea of the relationship between its powers being included in favor of the legislative authority, and not on the basis of cooperation as is the case in the parliamentary system, or on the basis of complete separation as it is the situation in the presidential system. The results indicated that the success of the implementation of the council system depends on the nature of the ruling system that will be adopted and the philosophy that is based on it, in addition to the necessity of a high degree of political awareness. Through these results, we recommend the application of the CPS in light of the outbreak of the COVID-19 and the subsequent political and societal changes.","Al-Dabbagh, Zeyad S.",J.

We found that A-to-I editing was dynamically regulated, and on average, approximately 91 editing events were deposited at viral dsRNA intermediates per sample. Moreover, editing hotspots were observed, including recoding sites in the spike gene that affect viral infectivity and antigenicity. Finally, we provided evidence that RNA editing accelerated SARS-CoV-2 evolution in humans.

The current COVID-19 pandemic provides an opportunity for greater use of TeleNP and understanding of neuropsychologists' experience with this unique assessment medium.Methods: During the course of a no-cost global webinar related to practical/ethical considerations of TeleNP practice, attendees were invited to engage in a 26-question survey about their TeleNP use and related COVID-19 concerns. TeleNP practices before the COVID-19 pandemic and early on during the global outbreak were queried among survey participants, along with examination of TeleNP intentions following COVID-19.Results: Multiple countries were represented across five continents, with two-thirds of respondents being from the United States. Approximately one-fourth of respondents reported using TeleNP for clinical interview, feedback, and intervention prior to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, and approximately one-tenth of individuals used TeleNP for testadministration. Increased use of TeleNP for clinical interview, feedback, and intervention was reported within the first few weeks of the global COVID-19 outbreak, though the use of TeleNP for testing remained relatively unchanged. Most respondents indicated an intention for future use of TeleNP.Conclusions: Our findings suggest the use of TeleNP is increasing, although use of remote TeleNP testing is still developing. Findings also illustrate increasing use of TeleNP in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic and encourage follow-up investigation in future studies to understand the changing practices and rates of TeleNP provision over time.","Hammers, Dustin B; Stolwyk, Renerus; Harder, Lana; Cullum, C Munro",Clin Neuropsychol,417,1

Using both the disk diffusion test and checkerboard assay, we initially examined the effects of combinations of retapamulin with MLS antibiotics against standard strains of these species. Combinations of retapamulin with erythromycin, quinupristin/dalfopristin and quinupristin showed synergistic activity against E. faecalis only. Synergy of retapamulin with clindamycin and dalfopristin was not observed. Then, a checkerboard assay was performed to evaluate the effects of the combinations against 15 clinical strains of E. faecalis. Retapamulin and quinupristin, the most synergistic combination, showed activity against all erythromycin-susceptible, -intermediate, and -resistant strains tested. Among the eight strains with high-level erythromycin resistance, five strains were synergistically inhibited in the presence of only 1 µg of retapamulin per ml. Time-kill assay revealed that combinations of retapamulin with erythromycin and quinupristin were bacteriostatic. These results suggest that combinations of retapamulin with erythromycin and quinupristin have in vitro synergistic activity against E. faecalis, including strains with high-level erythromycin resistance.","Park, Byoungduck; Min, Yu-Hong",J. antibiot,417,1

This has led to an increase in the demand for palliative care beyond what can be provided by most existing programs. We developed a scalable model to enable continued provision of high-quality palliative care during a pandemic for hospitals without a palliative care unit or existing dedicated palliative care beds. METHODS: A COVID-19 consultation service working group (CWG) was convened with stakeholders from palliative care, emergency medicine, critical care, and general internal medicine. The CWG connected with local palliative care teams to ensure a coordinated response, and developed a model to ensure high-quality palliative care provision. RESULTS: Our 3-step scalable model included: (1) consultant model enhanced by virtual care; (2) embedded model; and (3) cohorted end-of-life unit for COVID-19 positive patients. This approach was enabled through tools and resources to ensure specialist palliative care capacity and rapid upskilling of all clinicians to deliver basic palliative care. Enabling tools and resources included a triage tool for in-person versus virtual care, new medication order sets and guidelines to facilitate prescribing for common symptoms, and lead advance care planning and goals of care discussions. A redeployment plan of generalist physicians and psychiatrists was created to ensure seamless provision of serious illness care. CONCLUSION: This 3-step, scalable approach enables rapid upscaling of palliative care in collaboration with generalist physicians, and may be adapted for future pandemics or natural disasters.","Kaya, Ebru; Lewin, Warren; Frost, David; Hannon, Breffni; Zimmermann, Camilla",Am J Hosp Palliat Care,417,16

As a possible cause, our aim was to investigate which parameters increase the sensitivity or protection against COVID-19 between RT-PCR positive and RT-PCR negative cases in patients admitted to the emergency department. METHODS: In the pandemic process, patients admitted to the hospital with suspicion of COVID-19 were evaluated retrospectively. RT-PCR test was divided into + (for Group 1) and - (Group 2). The gender, age, clinical information, application symptoms, and comorbidity data of the patients were evaluated. RESULTS: One hundred and sixty-seven cases were evaluated in the study. Group 1: 88 cases, M/F ratio: 46/42 and average age 48 ± 17.3 years, Group 2: 79 cases, M/F ratio was approximately 3/2, and the average age was 48.3 ± 19.4 years. When the groups were compared in terms of symptoms, fever, cough, weakness, and headache were prominent in Group 1, whereas the contact was significantly higher in Group 2 (p < 0.05). Among the comorbid diseases, only COPD showed a significant difference between the groups, and it was found significantly higher in Group 2 (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Cough, headache, and fever were found valuable in the detection of cases. Attention should be paid to contact isolation to circumvent the pandemic process with less damage. Having chronic diseases, especially COPD, increases the risk of infection with SARS-CoV-2. Close monitoring and control of chronic diseases can positively change the course of COVID-19.","Akpinar, Guleser; Demir, Mehmet C; Sultanoglu, Hasan; Sonmez, Feruza T; Karaman, Kivanc; Keskin, Banu H; Ince, Nevin; Guclu, Derya",Clin. lab,417,24

METHODS: Thirty-three patients indicated for RTSA were monitored preoperatively, three, and 12 months postoperatively. Inertial measurement units were placed on the sternum and upper arm of the operative limb, recording humeral motion relative to the torso for the duration of a waking day. Elevation events (EE)/hour, EE/hour greater than 90°, time spent above 90°, and activity intensity were calculated and compared between time points. Patient-reported outcome measures were also collected at all time points. RESULTS: At three (P=0.040) and 12 (P=0.010) months after RTSA, patients demonstrated a significantly greater number of EE/hour greater than 90° compared to preoperatively. There were no significant differences (P&#8805;0.242) in the amount of time spent at different elevation angles at any time point, or in arm activity intensity. Overall, 95% of the day was spent at elevation angles less than 60° and 90% of the day in a low or moderate intensity state. Pearson correlations demonstrated relationships between forward elevation and the number of EE/hour (r=0.395, P=0.001) and the number of EE/hour greater than 90° (r=0.493, P<0.001). CONCLUSION: After RTSA, patients significantly increase the frequency of arm elevation to higher angles. However, no differences were found in the amount of time spent at different elevation angles.

The agents that were investigated can be divided into ""symptomatic"" (alleviating the features of the condition) and ""disease modifying"" (attempting to address the underlying biology of PD) treatments, ST and DMT respectively, with further categorisation possible based on mechanism of action and class of therapy. OBJECTIVE: Our goal in this report was to provide an overview of the pharmacological therapies -both ST and DMT - in clinical trials for PD during 2020-2021, with the aim of creating greater awareness and involvement in the clinical trial process. We also hope to stimulate collaboration amongst commercial and academic researchers as well as between the research and patient communities. METHODS: We conducted a review of clinical trials of drug therapies for PD using trial data obtained from the ClinicalTrials.gov and World Health Organisation (WHO) registries, and performed a breakdown analysis of studies that were active as of February 18th 2021. We also assessed active drug development projects that had completed one clinical phase but were yet to start the next. RESULTS: We identified 142 trials on ClinicalTrials.gov and 14 studies on the WHO registries that met our analysis criteria. Of these 156 trials, 91 were ST and 65 were DMT, Of the 145 trials registered on ClinicalTrials.gov in our 2020 analysis, 45 fell off the list and 42 were added. Despite this change, the balance of ST to DMT; the distribution across phases; the profile of therapeutic categories; and the proportion of repurposed therapies (33.5%); all remained very similar. There are only two DMTs in phase 3, and we identified 33 in-between-phase projects. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the effects of the coronavirus pandemic, investment and effort in clinical trials for PD appears to remain strong. There has been little change in the profile of the clinical trial landscape even though, over the past year, there has been considerable change to the content of the list.","McFarthing, Kevin; Rafaloff, Gary; Baptista, Marco; Wyse, Richard K; Stott, Simon R W",Journal of Parkinson&#039;s disease (Online),417,1

Aerosol generating procedures such as laparoscopic surgery are known to be associated with increased risks of viral transmission to the healthcare workers. The safety of laparoscopy during the pandemic was then debated. We aimed to systematically review the literature regarding the safe use of laparoscopy during COVID-19. METHODS: We performed a systematic search using PubMed and ScienceDirect databases from inception to 1st May, 2020. The following search terms were used: ''laparoscopic surgery and COVID-19''; ''minimally invasive surgery and COVID-19''. Search items were considered from the nature of the articles, date of publication, aims and findings in relation to use of laparoscopic surgery during COVID-19. The study protocol was registered with PROSPERO register for systematic reviews (CRD42020183432). RESULTS: Altogether, 174 relevant citations were identified and reviewed for this study, of which 22 articles were included. The analysis of the findings in relation to laparoscopic surgery during the pandemic were presented in tabular form. We completed the common recommendations for performing laparoscopy during the COVID-19 pandemic in forms of pre-, intra- and postoperative phases. CONCLUSION: There is no scientific evidence to date for the transmission of COVID-19 by laparoscopic surgery. Laparoscopy can be used with precautions because of its benefits compared to open surgery. If safe, conservative management is the primary alternative during the pandemic. We concluded that recommended precautions should be respected while performing laparoscopy during the pandemic.","El Boghdady, Michael; Ewalds-Kvist, Beatrice Marianne",Surg. (Edinb.),417,21

Three commercial varieties of chili pepper (Capsicum frutescens Linn.) at three ripening stages were selected. Physiochemical quality (color, texture, and vitamin C) and flavor properties [capsaicinoids, free amino acid (FAA), and aroma] were determined and compared by multivariate data analysis.

A total of 315 undergraduate students (M = 21.65±3.68 years and 67% females) participated in this study. The results demonstrated that college belongingness partially mediated the association between coronavirus anxiety and psychological adjustment. The mediating part from coronavirus anxiety to college belongingness was moderated by social media addiction. In comparison with the high level of social media addiction, coronavirus anxiety had a stronger predictive effect on college belongingness under the low and moderate levels of social media addiction condition. Our findings highlight that college belongingness is a potential mechanism explaining how coronavirus anxiety is related to psychological adjustment and that this relation may depend on the levels of social media addiction.","Arslan, Gökmen; Yildirim, Murat; Zangeneh, Masood",Int J Ment Health Addict,417,16

DM is one of the most serious diseases that affect human health, with high morbidity and rates of complications. Medical scientists worldwide have been working to control blood sugar levels and the complications associated with sugar level alterations, with an aim to reduce the adverse consequences of acute and chronic complications caused by DM. Patients with DM face great challenges during the pandemic owing to not only changes in the allocation of medical resources but also their abnormal autoimmune status, which reduces their resistance to infections. This increases the difficulty in treatment and the risk of mortality. This review presents, from an epidemiological viewpoint, information on the susceptibility of patients with DM to COVID-19 and the related treatment plans and strategies used in this population.","Lou, Xiao-Qian; Wang, Da-Wei; Wang, Jun-Feng; Du, Bing",World J Diabetes,417,24

Digital CBT may provide a scalable means of delivering CBT at a population level. We investigated the efficacy of a novel digital CBT program in those with GAD for outcomes of anxiety, worry, depressive symptoms, sleep difficulty, wellbeing, and participant-specific quality of life. METHODS: This online, two-arm parallel-group superiority randomized controlled trial compared digital CBT with waitlist control in 256 participants with moderate-to-severe symptoms of GAD. Digital CBT (Daylight), was delivered using participants' own smartphones. Online assessments took place at baseline (Week 0; immediately preceding randomization), mid-intervention (Week 3; from randomization), post-intervention (Week 6; primary endpoint), and follow-up (Week 10). RESULTS: Overall, 256 participants were randomized and intention-to-treat analysis found Daylight reduced symptoms of anxiety compared with waitlist control at post-intervention, reflecting a large effect size (adjusted difference [95% CI]: 3.22 [2.14, 4.31], d = 1.08). Significant improvements were found for measures of worry; depressive symptoms, sleep difficulty, wellbeing, and participant-specific quality of life.

The evidence of Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) application on the previous epidemic encourage researchers by giving a new angle to fight against the novel Coronavirus outbreak. This paper aims to comprehensively review the role of AI and ML as one significant method in the arena of screening, predicting, forecasting, contact tracing, and drug development for SARS-CoV-2 and its related epidemic. Method: A selective assessment of information on the research article was executed on the databases related to the application of ML and AI technology on Covid-19. Rapid and critical analysis of the three crucial parameters, i.e., abstract, methodology, and the conclusion was done to relate to the model's possibilities for tackling the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic. Result: This paper addresses on recent studies that apply ML and AI technology towards augmenting the researchers on multiple angles. It also addresses a few errors and challenges while using such algorithms in real-world problems. The paper also discusses suggestions conveying researchers on model design, medical experts, and policymakers in the current situation while tackling the Covid-19 pandemic and ahead. Conclusion: The ongoing development in AI and ML has significantly improved treatment, medication, screening, prediction, forecasting, contact tracing, and drug/vaccine development process for the Covid-19 pandemic and reduce the human intervention in medical practice. However, most of the models are not deployed enough to show their real-world operation, but they are still up to the mark to tackle the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic.","Lalmuanawma, Samuel; Hussain, Jamal; Chhakchhuak, Lalrinfela",Chaos Solitons Fractals,417,1

Workforce returning to work was invited to complete an online questionnaire regarding their attitude toward the COVID-19 epidemic and return-to-work along with psychological parameters including the Impact of Event Scale-Revised, Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scale- 21 (DASS-21) and Insomnia Severity Index (ISI). Psychoneuroimmunity prevention measures include precautions at personal and organization levels. From 673 valid questionnaires, we found that 10.8% of respondents met the diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) after returning to work. The respondents reported a low prevalence of anxiety (3.8%), depression (3.7%), stress (1.5%) and insomnia (2.3%). There were no significant differences in the severity of psychiatric symptoms between workers/technicians and executives/managers. >95% reported psychoneuroimmunity prevention measures including good ventilation in the workplace and wore a face mask as protective. Factors that were associated with the severity of psychiatric symptoms in the workforce were marital status, presence of physical symptom, poor physical health and viewing return to work as a health hazard (p < 0.05). In contrast, personal psychoneuroimmunity prevention measures including hand hygiene and wearing face masks as well as organizational measures including significant improvement of workplace hygiene and concerns from the company were associated with less severe psychiatric symptoms (p < 0.05). Contrary to expectations, returning to work had not caused a high level of psychiatric symptoms in the workforce. The low prevalence of psychiatric symptoms could be due to confidence instilled by psychoneuroimmunity prevention measures before the resumption of work.

We aimed to describe the typical presentation and outcomes of children diagnosed with this hyperinflammatory condition. Methods: We conducted a systematic review to communicate the clinical signs and symptoms, laboratory findings, imaging results, and outcomes of individuals with MIS-C. We searched four medical databases to encompass studies characterizing MIS-C from January 1st, 2020 to July 25th, 2020. Two independent authors screened articles, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. This review was registered with PROSPERO CRD42020191515. Findings: Our search yielded 39 observational studies (n = 662 patients). While 71·0% of children (n = 470) were admitted to the intensive care unit, only 11 deaths (1·7%) were reported. Average length of hospital stay was 7·9 ± 0·6 days. Fever (100%, n = 662), abdominal pain or diarrhea (73·7%, n = 488), and vomiting (68·3%, n = 452) were the most common clinical presentation. Serum inflammatory, coagulative, and cardiac markers were considerably abnormal. Mechanical ventilation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation were necessary in 22·2% (n = 147) and 4·4% (n = 29) of patients, respectively. An abnormal echocardiograph was observed in 314 of 581 individuals (54·0%) with depressed ejection fraction (45·1%, n = 262 of 581) comprising the most common aberrancy. Interpretation: Multisystem inflammatory syndrome is a new pediatric disease associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that is dangerous and potentially lethal. With prompt recognition and medical attention, most children will survive but the long-term outcomes from this condition are presently unknown. Funding: Parker B.

Though the COVID-19 virus outbreak has changed the daily lives of children and youth, it is unknown to what extent related restrictions may compromise the ability to play and meet movement behaviour recommendations. This secondary data analysis examined the immediate impacts of COVID-19 restrictions on movement and play behaviours in children and youth. METHODS: A national sample of Canadian parents (n = 1472) of children (5-11 years) or youth (12-17 years) (54% girls) completed an online survey that assessed immediate changes in child movement and play behaviours during the COVID-19 outbreak. Behaviours included PA and play, SB, and sleep. Family demographics and parental factors that may influence movement behaviours were assessed. Correlations between behaviours and demographic and parental factors were determined. For open-ended questions, word frequency distributions were reported. RESULTS: Only 4.8% (2.8% girls, 6.5% boys) of children and 0.6% (0.8% girls, 0.5% boys) of youth were meeting combined movement behaviour guidelines during COVID-19 restrictions. Children and youth had lower PA levels, less outside time, higher SB (including leisure screen time), and more sleep during the outbreak. Parental encouragement and support, parental engagement in PA, and family dog ownership were positively associated with healthy movement behaviours. Although families spent less time in PA and more time in SB, several parents reported adopting new hobbies or accessing new resources. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence of immediate collateral consequences of the COVID-19 outbreak, demonstrating an adverse impact on the movement and play behaviours of Canadian children and youth. These findings can guide efforts to preserve and promote child health during the COVID-19 outbreak and crisis recovery period, and to inform strategies to mitigate potential harm during future pandemics.","Moore, Sarah A; Faulkner, Guy; Rhodes, Ryan E; Brussoni, Mariana; Chulak-Bozzer, Tala; Ferguson, Leah J; Mitra, Raktim; O039,; Reilly, Norm; Spence, John C; Vanderloo, Leigh M; Tremblay, Mark S",Int J Behav Nutr Phys Act,417,24

Although many people tend to react resiliently to stress, others appear to display emotional anxiety and depression-related symptoms. In this study, we carried out a survey (N = 10,053) during the first week of the general lockdown (quarantine) in Argentina to measure early affective reactions in Argentine adults. Respondents showed substantial anxious and depressive symptoms, with 33% and 23% of participants reporting possible depressive and anxious syndromes, respectively, with the youngest group (18 to 25 y.o.) showing the highest prevalence of symptoms. Even if prior mental health problems predisposed or aggravated the reaction, participants without prior complaints showed signs of psychological impact. Using linear regression, the most important independent variables related to depressive symptoms were the feeling of loneliness followed by daily stress. In the case of anxious states, the strongest variables were negative repetitive thinking and feeling of loneliness. Other psychological, economic, and social factors are discussed. This study is in line with previous literature that highlight the importance of the psychological impact of pandemics, but additionally demonstrates that these reactions are present at a large scale immediately after the start of quarantine with very low infectious rates as an early anticipatory adaptive reaction leading to potential negative outcomes from adjustment disorders to major disorders. In addition, the present results provide potentially relevant information about sudden environmental impacts on affective states and specific pathways for anxiety and depression to be expressed.

Airborne precaution personal protective equipment and preventative measures are universally mandated for medical procedures deemed to be aerosol generating. The implementation of these measures is having a huge impact on healthcare provision. There is currently a lack of quantitative evidence on the number and size of airborne particles produced during aerosol-generating procedures to inform risk assessments. To address this evidence gap, we conducted real-time, high-resolution environmental monitoring in ultraclean ventilation operating theatres during tracheal intubation and extubation sequences. Continuous sampling with an optical particle sizer allowed characterisation of aerosol generation within the zone between the patient and anaesthetist. Aerosol monitoring showed a very low background particle count (0.4 particles.l-1 ) allowing resolution of transient increases in airborne particles associated with airway management. As a positive reference control, we quantitated the aerosol produced in the same setting by a volitional cough (average concentration, 732 (418) particles.l-1 , n = 38). Tracheal intubation including facemask ventilation produced very low quantities of aerosolised particles (average concentration, 1.4 (1.4) particles.l-1 , n = 14, p < 0.0001 vs. cough). Tracheal extubation, particularly when the patient coughed, produced a detectable aerosol (21 (18) l-1 , n = 10) which was 15-fold greater than intubation (p = 0.0004) but 35-fold less than a volitional cough (p < 0.0001). The study does not support the designation of elective tracheal intubation as an aerosol-generating procedure. Extubation generates more detectable aerosol than intubation but falls below the current criterion for designation as a high-risk aerosol-generating procedure. These novel findings from real-time aerosol detection in a routine healthcare setting provide a quantitative methodology for risk assessment that can be extended to other airway management techniques and clinical settings. They also indicate the need for reappraisal of what constitutes an aerosol-generating procedure and the associated precautions for routine anaesthetic airway management.","Brown, J; Gregson, F K A; Shrimpton, A; Cook, T M; Bzdek, B R; Reid, J P; Pickering, A E",Anaesthesia (Lond.),417,1

METHODS: Five patients underwent tracheostomy between April 1, 2020 and April 17, 2020. A clear and sterile plastic drape was used as an additional physical barrier against droplets and aerosols. Operative diagnosis; droplet count and distribution on plastic sheet and face shields were documented. RESULTS: Tracheostomy was performed for patients with carcinoma of tonsil (n = 2) and nasopharynx (n = 1), and aspiration pneumonia (n = 2). Droplet contamination was noted on all plastic sheets (n = 5). Droplet contamination was most severe over the central surface at 91.5% (86.7%-100.0%) followed by the left and right lateral surfaces at 5.2% (6.7%-10.0%) and 3.3% (6.7%-10.0%), respectively. No droplet contamination was noted on all face shields. CONCLUSION: Plastic drapes can help reduce viral transmission to health care providers during tracheostomy.

We surveyed and interviewed precarious workers in France during the COVID-19 crisis, in March and April 2020. We oversampled gig economy workers, in particular in driving and food delivery occupations (hereafter drivers and bikers), residing in metropolitan areas. These workers cannot rely on stable incomes and are excluded from the labor protections offered to employees, features which have been exacerbated by the crisis. We analyzed outcomes for precarious workers during the mandatory lockdown in France as an extreme case to better understand how financial precarity relates to health risks and mental well-being. Our analysis revealed that 3 weeks into the lockdown, 56% of our overall sample had stopped working and respondents had experienced a 28% income drop on average. Gig economy drivers reported a significant 20 percentage point larger income decrease than other workers in our sample. Bikers were significantly more likely to have continued working outside the home during the lockdown. Yet our quantitative analysis also revealed that stress and anxiety levels were not higher for these groups and that bikers in fact reported significantly lower stress levels during the lockdown. While this positive association between being a biker and mental health may be interpreted in different ways, our qualitative data led to a nuanced understanding of the effect of gig work on mental well-being in this population group.","Apouey, Bénédicte; Roulet, Alexandra; Solal, Isabelle; Stabile, Mark",J. urban health,417,1

A centre-based format is a known barrier, suggesting that home-based programmes might improve accessibility. The aim of SCOT: Rehabilitation EnAblement in CHronic Heart Failure (REACH-HF) is to assess the implementation of the REACH-HF home-based CR intervention in the context of the National Health Service (NHS) in Scotland.This paper presents the design and protocol for this observational implementation study. Specific objectives of SCOT:REACH-HF are to: (1) assess service-level facilitators and barriers to the implementation of REACH-HF; (2) compare real-world patient and caregiver outcomes to those seen in a prior clinical trial; and (3) estimate the economic (health and social) impact of implementing REACH-HF in Scotland. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The REACH-HF intervention will be delivered in partnership with four 'Beacon sites' across six NHS Scotland Health Boards, covering rural and urban areas. Health professionals from each site will be trained to facilitate delivery of the 12-week programme to 140 people with heart failure and their caregivers. Patient and caregiver outcomes will be assessed at baseline and 4-month follow-up. Assessments include the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire (MLHFQ), five-dimension EuroQol 5L, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and the Caregiver Burden Questionnaire. Qualitative interviews will be conducted with up to 20 health professionals involved in programme delivery (eg, cardiac nurses, physiotherapists). 65 facilitator-patient consultations will be audio recorded and assessed for fidelity. Integrative analysis will address key research questions on fidelity, context and CR participant-related outcomes. The SCOT:REACH-HF findings will inform the future potential roll-out of REACH-HF in Scotland. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study has been given ethical approval by the West of Scotland Research Ethics Service (reference 20/WS/0038, approved 25 March 2020). Written informed consent will be obtained from all participants. The study is listed on the ISRCTN registry with study ID ISRCTN53784122. The research team will ensure that the study is conducted in accordance with both General Data Protection Regulations and the University of Glasgow's Research Governance Framework. Findings will be reported to the funder and shared with Beacon Sites, to facilitate service evaluation, planning and good practice. To broaden interest in, and understanding of REACH-HF, we will seek to publish in peer-reviewed scientific journals and present at stakeholder events, national and international conferences.","Purcell, Carrie; Daw, Paulina; Kerr, Claire; Cleland, J; Cowie, Aynsley; Dalal, Hasnain M; Ibbotson, Tracy; Murphy, Clare; Taylor, Rod",BMJ Open,417,16

Comprehensive, high-resolution estimates are important to inform progress towards achieving this goal. We aimed to produce high-resolution geospatial estimates of access to drinking water and sanitation facilities. METHODS: We used a Bayesian geostatistical model and data from 600 sources across more than 88 low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) to estimate access to drinking water and sanitation facilities on continuous continent-wide surfaces from 2000 to 2017, and aggregated results to policy-relevant administrative units. We estimated mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive subcategories of facilities for drinking water (piped water on or off premises, other improved facilities, unimproved, and surface water) and sanitation facilities (septic or sewer sanitation, other improved, unimproved, and open defecation) with use of ordinal regression. We also estimated the number of diarrhoeal deaths in children younger than 5 years attributed to unsafe facilities and estimated deaths that were averted by increased access to safe facilities in 2017, and analysed geographical inequality in access within LMICs. FINDINGS: Across LMICs, access to both piped water and improved water overall increased between 2000 and 2017, with progress varying spatially. For piped water, the safest water facility type, access increased from 40·0% (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 39·4-40·7) to 50·3% (50·0-50·5), but was lowest in sub-Saharan Africa, where access to piped water was mostly concentrated in urban centres. Access to both sewer or septic sanitation and improved sanitation overall also increased across all LMICs during the study period. For sewer or septic sanitation, access was 46·3% (95% UI 46·1-46·5) in 2017, compared with 28·7% (28·5-29·0) in 2000. Although some units improved access to the safest drinking water or sanitation facilities since 2000, a large absolute number of people continued to not have access in several units with high access to such facilities (>80%) in 2017. More than 253â000 people did not have access to sewer or septic sanitation facilities in the city of Harare, Zimbabwe, despite 88·6% (95% UI 87·2-89·7) access overall. Many units were able to transition from the least safe facilities in 2000 to safe facilities by 2017; for units in which populations primarily practised open defecation in 2000, 686 (95% UI 664-711) of the 1830 (1797-1863) units transitioned to the use of improved sanitation. Geographical disparities in access to improved water across units decreased in 76·1% (95% UI 71·6-80·7) of countries from 2000 to 2017, and in 53·9% (50·6-59·6) of countries for access to improved sanitation, but remained evident subnationally in most countries in 2017. INTERPRETATION: Our estimates, combined with geospatial trends in diarrhoeal burden, identify where efforts to increase access to safe drinking water and sanitation facilities are most needed. By highlighting areas with successful approaches or in need of targeted interventions, our estimates can enable precision public health to effectively progress towards universal access to safe water and sanitation.

COVID-19 has affected every country in different magnitudes. The absence of vaccine and changed lifestyle suddenly imposed upon masses affected their functioning as well. Those victimized by the virus have their own problems while others also have had their own sufferings. OBJECTIVES: Amidst all trials and tests for cure, this paper is an attempt to understand the psychological, spiritual and emotional response to COVID-19 and Government Interventions in India. It also tries to assess the differences in experiences across age, gender and educational qualifications. DESIGN: The study adopts a mixed approach and is an exploratory cross-sectional study. For the purpose of the study, a shortened version of Czech SWSB, RYFF's Psychological Wellbeing 18 point scale and STAI scale were customized for pandemic times, administered towards the end of Lockdown 1.0 in India. After reliability and validity tests, established scales are used to study the variable in the research. For the analysis of data Smart PLS SEM 3.3.2 is used. SETTING: General masses of India were a part of the study. A cohort of 100 respondents willing to participate in the survey during the initial 21 days lockdown in India was studied which was selected using snowball sampling. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The study measures the association of psychological, spiritual and emotional response to covid-19 pandemic experiences and also the response to interventions made. FINDINGS: The results show that there is trivial relation of age, education and gender to the experiences of COVID-19. It was also found that Psychological Wellbeing and Spiritual Wellbeing were significantly related to the experiences of COVID-19.

METHODS: A questionnaire survey was conducted among 108 participants with mild COVID-19 who have isolated at home under the guidance of doctors. The results of the questionnaire and outpatient data were integrated to evaluate participants' compliance with various epidemic prevention measures. RESULTS: During isolation, most participants were able to follow epidemic prevention measures under the guidance of doctors. After 14 d from the start of isolation, 45.37% of the participants recovered. Approximately half of the participants were relieved of symptoms, and most of them were transferred to mobile cabin hospitals to continue isolation. Three participants with worsening symptoms were transferred to the designated hospitals. There were no deaths of the participants, but there were 7 family members that were infected. CONCLUSIONS: During a period of home isolation under the guidance of a doctor, individuals can comply with epidemic prevention measures and symptoms can be improved. Scientific home isolation may be an effective way to relieve the strain of medical and social resources during the epidemic of COVID-19.","Li, Hang; Peng, Yuan-Yuan; Lu, Jin-Ping",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,417,24

We identify four key themes developing over time. In relation to evolving COVID-19 prevention policies, (a) the lockdown interrupted life and experiences of temporality. (b) Following the lockdown, risk management changed from fear to insecurities and (c) simultaneously, emotion management transitioned from solidarity to fragmentation. (d) Increasingly, pragmatic considerations allowed parents to tackle uncertainties and created room to normalize everyday life. We studied ""change"" by using a novel conceptual model for temporality and found distinct temporalities in parents' accounts.

Nucleic acid testing is the standard method for the diagnosis of viral infections. However, this method reportedly has a low positivity rate. To increase the sensitivity of COVID-19 diagnoses, we developed an IgM-IgG combined assay and tested it in patients with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection. In total, 56 patients were enrolled in this study and SARS-CoV-2 was detected by using both IgM-IgG antibody and nucleic acid tests. Clinical and laboratory data were collected and analyzed. Our findings suggest that patients who develop severe illness might experience longer virus exposure times and develop a more severe inflammatory response. The IgM-IgG test is an accurate and sensitive diagnostic method. A combination of nucleic acid and IgM-IgG testing is a more sensitive and accurate approach for diagnosis and early treatment of COVID-19.","Xie, Jiajia; Ding, Chengchao; Li, Jing; Wang, Yulan; Guo, Hui; Lu, Zhaohui; Wang, Jinquan; Zheng, Changcheng; Jin, Tengchuan; Gao, Yong; He, Hongliang",J. med. virol,417,1

This report assesses risk factors associated with mortality in patients presenting with Covid-19 infection and healthcare disparities. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of consecutive patients presenting to emergency departments within an integrated health system who tested positive for COVID-19 between March 7 and April 30, 2020 in Metropolitan Detroit. The primary outcomes were hospitalization and 30-day mortality. RESULTS: A total of 3,633 patients with mean age of 58 years were included. The majority were female and black non-Hispanic. Sixty-four percent required hospitalization, 56% of whom were black. Hospitalized patients were older, more likely to reside in a low-income area, and had a higher burden of comorbidities. By 30-days, 433 (18.7%) hospitalized patients died. In adjusted analyses, the presence of comorbidities, age >60 years and more severe physiological disturbance were associated with 30-day mortality. Residence in low income areas (odds ratio, 1.02; 95% confidence interval 0.76 - 1.36), and public insurance (odds ratio, 1.24; 95% confidence interval 0.76 - 2.01) were not independently associated with higher risk of mortality. Black female patients had a lower adjusted risk of mortality (odds ratio, 0.46; 95% confidence interval, 0.27 to 0.78). CONCLUSIONS: In this large cohort of COVID-19 patients, those with comorbidities, advanced age, and physiological abnormalities on presentation had higher odds of death. Disparities in income or source of health insurance were not associated with outcomes. Black women had a lower risk of dying.","Miller, Joseph; Fadel, Raef A; Tang, Amy; Perrotta, Giuseppe; Herc, Erica; Soman, Sandeep; Nair, Sashi; Hanna, Zachary; Zervos, Marcus J; Alangaden, George; Brar, Indira; Suleyman, Geehan",Clin. infect. dis,417,26

A central mechanism for COVID-19 pathophysiology has been proposed: imbalance of angiotensin converting enzymes (ACE)1 and ACE2 (ACE2 being the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2] virus ""receptor"") that results in tissue injury from angiotensin II (Ang II)-mediated signaling. This mechanism provides a rationale for multiple therapeutic approaches. In parallel, clinical data from retrospective analysis of COVID-19 cohorts has revealed that ACE inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) may be beneficial in COVID-19. These findings have led to the initiation of clinical trials using approved drugs that target the generation (ACEIs) and actions (ARBs) of Ang II. However, treatment of COVID-19 with ACEIs/ARBs poses several challenges. These include choosing appropriate inclusion and exclusion criteria, dose optimization, risk of adverse effects and drug interactions, and verification of target engagement. Other approaches related to the RAS pathway might be considered, for example, inhalational administration of ACEIs/ARBs (to deliver drugs directly to the lungs) and use of compounds with other actions (e.g., activation of ACE2, agonism of MAS1 receptors, ß-arrestin-based Angiotensin receptor agonists, and administration of soluble ACE2 or ACE2 peptides). Studies with animal models could test such approaches and assess therapeutic benefit. This Perspective highlights questions whose answers could advance RAS-targeting agents as mechanism-driven ways to blunt tissue injury, morbidity, and mortality of COVID-19.","Sriram, Krishna; Loomba, Rohit; Insel, Paul A",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,417,20

Public information created awareness as well as concern in the general population. There has been a reported decrease in the number of patients attending emergency departments (ED) during the pandemic. This is the first study to determine differences in the types of presenting illnesses, severity, and rate of resultant surgical intervention during the pandemic. METHODS AND MATERIALS: We carried out a retrospective, observational cohort study comparing two groups of patients attending the ED at our tertiary-care academic hospital. A historical comparison cohort was obtained by reviewing the number of patients referred by the ED for abdominal CT between March 15 and April 15, 2020, compared with March 15 and April 15, 2019. CT reports were reviewed; primary pathologies, complications, and subsequent surgical intervention were documented and compared between the two groups. RESULTS: In all, 733 patients were included in the 2019 cohort, and 422 patients were included in the 2020 cohort. In 2019, 32.7% had positive CT findings, increasing to 50.5% in 2020. The number of complications increased from 7.9% to 19.7%. The rate requiring surgical intervention increased from 26.3% to 47.6% in 2020. CONCLUSION: To date, there is little published data regarding the presentation and severity of illnesses during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. This information has important public health implications, highlighting the need to educate patients to continue to present to hospital services during such crises, including if a purported second wave of COVID-19 arises.","O039,; Brien, Ciara M; Jung, Katherine; Dang, Wilfred; Jang, Hyun-Jung; Kielar, Ania Z",J Am Coll Radiol,417,14

Many warned that this risked damaging public confidence during a critical period of pandemic response. This study investigated whether the pause in the use of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine had an impact on subsequent vaccine uptake in European countries. MethodsWe used a difference-in-differences approach capitalizing on the fact that some countries halted their rollouts whilst others did not. A longitudinal panel was constructed for European Economic Area countries spanning 15 weeks in early 2021. Media reports were used to identify countries that paused the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine and the timing of this. Data on vaccine uptake were available through the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention COVID-19 Vaccine Tracker. Difference-in-differences linear regression models controlled for key confounders that could influence vaccine uptake, and country and week fixed effects. Further models and robustness checks were performed. ResultsThe panel included 28 countries, with 19 in the intervention group and 9 in the control group. Pausing the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine was associated with a 0.52% decrease in uptake for the first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine and a 1.49% decrease in the uptake for both doses, comparing countries that paused to those that did not. These estimates are not statistically significant (p=0.86 and 0.39 respectively). For the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine only, the pause was associated with a 0.56% increase in uptake for the first dose and a 0.07% decrease in uptake for both doses. These estimates are also not statistically significant (p= 0.56 and 0.51 respectively). All our findings are robust to sensitivity analyses. ConclusionAs new COVID-19 vaccines emerge, regulators should be cautious to deviate from usual protocols if further investigation on clinical or epidemiological grounds is warranted.","Jain, Vageesh; Lorgelly, Paula",,417,16

The association of respiratory diseases and smoking, both highly prevalent globally, with COVID-19 severity has not been elucidated. Given the gap in the evidence and the growing prevalence of COVID-19, the objective of this study was to explore the association of underlying respiratory diseases and smoking with severe outcomes in patients with COVID-19 infection. METHODS: A systematic search was performed to identify studies reporting prevalence of respiratory diseases and/or smoking in relation with disease severity in patients with confirm COVID-19, published between January 1 to April 15, 2020 in English language. Pooled odds-ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated. FINDINGS: Twenty two studies met the inclusion criteria. All the studies presented data of 13,184 COVID-19 patients (55% males). Patients with severe outcomes were older and a larger percentage were males compared with the non-severe. Pooled analysis showed that prevalence of respiratory diseases (OR 4.21; 95% CI, 2.9-6.0) and smoking (current smoking OR 1.98; 95% CI, 1.16-3.39 and former smoking OR 3.46; 95% CI, 2.46-4.85) were significantly associated with severe COVID-19 outcomes. INTERPRETATION: Results suggested that underlying respiratory diseases, specifically COPD, and smoking were associated with severe COVID-19 outcomes. These findings may support the planning of preventive interventions and could contribute to improvements in the assessment and management of patient risk factors in clinical practice, leading to the mitigation of severe outcomes in patients with COVID-19 infection.","Sanchez-Ramirez, Diana C; Mackey, Denise",Respir Med,417,8

The development of coronavirus-evoked pneumonia is associated with excessive inflammatory responses in the lung, known as “cytokine storms,” which results in pulmonary edema, atelectasis, and acute lung injury (ALI) or fatal acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). No drugs are available to suppress overly immune response-mediated lung injury effectively. In light of the low toxicity and its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antiviral activity, it is plausible to speculate that curcumin could be used as a therapeutic drug for viral pneumonia and ALI/ARDS. Therefore, in this review, we summarize the mounting evidence obtained from preclinical studies using animal models of lethal pneumonia where curcumin exerts protective effects by regulating the expression of both pro- and anti-inflammatory factors such as IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and COX-2, promoting the apoptosis of PMN cells, and scavenging the reactive oxygen species (ROS), which exacerbates the inflammatory response. These studies provide a rationale that curcumin can be used as a therapeutic agent against pneumonia and ALI/ARDS in humans resulting from coronaviral infection.","Liu, Ziteng; Ying, Ying",Front Cell Dev Biol,417,26

The respiratory sequelae of COVID-19 in children remain poorly characterized. In this study we describe health data and respiratory findings in pediatric patients presenting with persistent respiratory symptoms following COVID-19. METHODS This study included patients referred to Pulmonary Clinic at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia between December 2020 and April 2021 (n = 29). Inclusion criteria included a history of SARS-CoV-2 RNA positivity or confirmed close household contact and suggestive symptoms. A retrospective chart review was performed and demographic, clinical, imaging, and functional test data were collected. RESULTS The mean age at presentation to clinic was 13.1 years (range: 4-19 years). Patients had persistent respiratory symptoms ranging from 1.3 to 6.7 months postacute infection. Persistent dyspnea and/or exertional dyspnea were present in nearly all (96.6%) patients at the time of clinic presentation. Other reported chronic symptoms included cough (51.7%) and exercise intolerance (48.3%). Fatigue was reported in 13.8% of subjects. Many subjects were overweight or obese (62.1%) and 11 subjects (37.9%) had a prior history of asthma. Spirometry and plethysmography were normal in most patients. The six-minute walk test (6MWT) revealed exercise intolerance and significant tachycardia in two-thirds of the nine children tested. CONCLUSION Exertional dyspnea, cough and exercise intolerance were the most common respiratory symptoms in children with postacute COVID-19 respiratory symptoms seen in an outpatient pulmonary clinic. Spirometry (and plethysmography when available), however, was mostly normal, and exertional intolerance was frequently demonstrated using the 6MWT.","Leftin Dobkin, Shoshana C; Collaco, Joseph M; McGrath-Morrow, Sharon A",Pediatric pulmonology,417,20

High NAb titers, for example, are the most important criterion regarding the effectiveness of convalescent plasma therapy. However, common cell culture-based NAb assays are time-consuming and feasible only in special laboratories. Our data reveal the suitability of a novel ELISA-based surrogate virus neutralization test (sVNT) to easily measure the inhibition-capability of NAbs in the plasma of COVID-19 convalescents. We propose a combined strategy to detect plasma samples with high NAb titers ([≥] 1:160) reliably and to, simultaneously, reduce the risk of erroneously identifying low-titer specimens. For this approach, results of the sVNT assay are compared to and combined with those acquired from the Euroimmun anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay.

The possible role that children attending primary school may play in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 remains poorly understood. Objective: To gain a better understanding of the possible role of children in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Design, Setting, and Participants: This prospective cohort study was conducted from September 21 to December 31, 2020, in a primary school in Liege, Belgium, among a volunteer sample of 181 children, parents, and school employees. Exposures: Participants were tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection once a week for 15 weeks through throat washing, performed with 5 mL of saline and collected in a sterile tube after approximately 30 seconds of gargling. Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction was performed to detect SARS-CoV-2 infection. Main Outcomes and Measures: In case of test positivity, participants were asked to complete a questionnaire aimed at determining the timing of symptom onset and symptom duration. SARS-CoV-2 genetic sequencing was also performed. Confirmed cases were linked based on available information on known contacts and viral sequences. Results: A total of 181 individuals participated in this study, including 63 children (34 girls [54.0%];mean [SD] age, 8.6 [1.9] years [range, 5-13 years]) and 118 adults (75 women [63.6%];mean [SD] age, 42.5 [5.7] years [range, 30-59 years]). Forty-five individuals (24.9%) tested positive: 13 children (20.6%;95% CI, 10.6%-30.6%) and 32 adults (27.1%;95% CI, 19.1%-35.7%) (P = .34). Children were more often asymptomatic compared with adults (6 [46.2%;95% CI, 19.1%-73.3%] vs 4 of 31 [12.9%;95% CI, 1.3%-24.5%];P = .04). The median duration of symptoms was shorter in children than in adults (0.00 days [IQR, 0.00-1.00 days] vs 15.00 days [IQR, 7.00-22.00 days]). A reconstruction of the outbreak revealed that most transmission events occurred between teachers and between children within the school. Of the observed household transmission events, most seemed to have originated from a child or teacher who acquired the infection at school. Conclusions and Relevance: Despite the implementation of several mitigation measures, the incidence of COVID-19 among children attending primary school in this study was comparable to that observed among teachers and parents. Transmission tree reconstruction suggests that most transmission events originated from within the school. Additional measures should be considered to reduce the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 at school, including intensified testing.","Meuris, C.; Kremer, C.; Geerinck, A.; Locquet, M.; Bruyere, O.; Defeche, J.; Meex, C.; Hayette, M.

The synthesis, pharmacological properties, and docking studies of the compounds are reported in this study. The structure of the new macrocycles was confirmed by NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. Compounds 13, 14, and 15a-c were evaluated for their anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity on SARS-COV-2 (NRC-03-nhCoV) virus in Vero-E6 cells. Isopropyl triester 13 and triacid 14 demonstrated superior inhibitory activities against SARS-CoV-2 compared to carboxamides 15a-c. MTT cytotoxicity assays showed that the CC(50) (50% cytotoxicity concentration) of 13, 14, and 15a-c ranged from 159.1 to 741.8 μM and their safety indices ranged from 2.50 to 39.1. Study of the viral inhibition via different mechanisms of action (viral adsorption, replication, or virucidal property) showed that 14 had mild virucidal (60%) and inhibitory effects on virus adsorption (66%) at 20 μM concentrations. Compound 13 displayed several inhibitory effects at three levels, but the potency of its action is primarily virucidal. The inhibitory activity of compounds 13, 14, and 15a-c against the enzyme SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) was evaluated. Isopropyl triester 13 had a significant inhibition activity against SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) with an IC(50) of 2.58 µM. Large substituents on the macrocyclic template significantly reduced the inhibitory effects of the compounds. Study of the docking of the compounds in the SARS CoV-2-M(pro) active site showed that the most potent macrocycles 13 and 14 exhibited the best fit and highest affinity for the active site binding pocket. Taken together, the present study shows that the new macrocyclic compounds constitute a new family of SARS CoV-2-M(pro) inhibitors that are worth being further optimized and developed.","Al-Wahaibi, Lamya H.; Mostafa, Ahmed; Mostafa, Yaser A.; Abou-Ghadir, Ola F.; Abdelazeem, Ahmed H.; Gouda, Ahmed M.; Kutkat, Omnia; Abo Shama, Noura M.; Shehata, Mahmoud; Gomaa, Hesham A.M.; Abdelrahman, Mostafa H.; Mohamed, Fatma A.M.; Gu, Xuyuan; Ali, Mohamed A.; Trembleau, Laurent; Youssif, Bahaa G.M.",Bioorg Chem,417,16

While these technologies are improving the diagnosis and treatment of mental and neurological diseases, they can also alter individual agency and estrange those using neurotechnologies from their sense of self, challenging basic notions of what it means to be human. As an international coalition of interdisciplinary scholars and practitioners, we examine these challenges and make recommendations to mitigate negative consequences that could arise from the unregulated development or application of novel neurotechnologies. We explore potential ethical challenges in four key areas: identity and agency, privacy, bias, and enhancement. To address them, we propose (1) democratic and inclusive summits to establish globally-coordinated ethical and societal guidelines for neurotechnology development and application, (2) new measures, including “Neurorights,” for data privacy, security, and consent to empower neurotechnology users’ control over their data, (3) new methods of identifying and preventing bias, and (4) the adoption of public guidelines for safe and equitable distribution of neurotechnological devices.","Goering, Sara; Klein, Eran; Specker Sullivan, Laura; Wexler, Anna; Agüera y Arcas, Blaise; Bi, Guoqiang; Carmena, Jose M.; Fins, Joseph J.; Friesen, Phoebe; Gallant, Jack; Huggins, Jane E.; Kellmeyer, Philipp; Marblestone, Adam; Mitchell, Christine; Parens, Erik; Pham, Michelle; Rubel, Alan; Sadato, Norihiro; Teicher, Mina; Wasserman, David; Whittaker, Meredith; Wolpaw, Jonathan; Yuste, Rafael",Neuroethics,417,3

However, currently, there is a lack of systematic study and quantitative information of the aerosol generation during these instruments, which is crucial for offering risk assessment and the corresponding mitigation strategies for the reopening of these activities. Collaborating with 15 musicians from the Minnesota Orchestra, we conduct a systematic study of the aerosol generation from a large variety of wind instruments under different music dynamic levels and articulation patterns. We find that the aerosol concentration from different brass and woodwinds exhibits two orders of magnitude variation. Accordingly, we categorize the instruments into low (tuba), intermediate (piccolo, flute, bass clarinet, French horn, and clarinet) and high risk (trumpet, bass trombone, and oboe) levels based on a comparison of their aerosol generation with those from normal breathing and speaking. In addition, we observe that the aerosol generation can be affected by the changing dynamic level, articulation pattern, the normal respiratory behaviors of individuals, and even the usage of some special techniques during the instrument play. However, such effects vary substantially for different types of instrument, depending on specific breathing techniques as well as the tube structure and inlet design of the instrument. Overall, our findings can bring insights into the risk assessment of airborne decrease transmission and the corresponding mitigation strategies for various musical activities involving wind instrument plays, including orchestras, community and worship bands, music classes, etc.","He, R.; Gao, L.; Trifonov, M.; Hong, J.",,417,10

The generation and evaluation of the peptides in terms of HLA I and HLA II binding, immune response, toxicity and allergenicity were performed by using computer-aided tools, such as NetMHCpan 4.1, NetMHCIIpan 4.0, VaxiJem, ToxinPred and AllerTop. Furthermore, the interaction between the predicted epitopes with HLA I and HLA II proteins frequently found in the Colombian population was studied through molecular docking simulations in AutoDock Vina and interaction analysis in LigPlot+. One of the promising peptides proposed in this study is the HLA I epitope YQPYRVVVL, which displayed an estimated coverage of over 82% and 96% for the Colombian and worldwide population, respectively.

Two SARS-CoV-2 variants, N501Y.V1 (also known as B.1.1.7 lineage or VOC-202012/01) and N501Y.V2 (B.1.351 lineage), reported from the United Kingdom and South Africa, contain several mutations in the receptor binding domain of Spike and are of particular concern. To address the infectivity and neutralization escape phenotypes potentially caused by these mutations, we used SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus system to compare the viral infectivity, as well as the neutralization activities of convalescent sera and monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against SARS-CoV-2 variants. Our results showed that N501Y Variant 1 and Variant 2 increase viral infectivity compared to the reference strain (wild-type, WT) in vitro. At 8 months after symptom onset, 17 serum samples of 20 participants (85%) retaining titers of ID50 >40 against WT pseudovirus, whereas the NAb titers of 8 samples (40%) and 18 samples (90%) decreased below the threshold against N501Y.V1 and N501Y.V2, respectively. In addition, both N501Y Variant 1 and Variant 2 reduced neutralization sensitivity to most (6/8) mAbs tested, while N501Y.V2 even abrogated neutralizing activity of two mAbs.

The virus can cause substantial economic losses throughout the poultry industry worldwide. It can affect the upper respiratory tract and the reproductive tract, and some strains can cause nephritis. The causative agent IBV is an RNA virus with great ability for mutation and recombination, thus capable of generating new virus strains that are difficult to control. There are many IBV strains found worldwide, including the Massachusetts, 4/91, D274, and QX-like strains that can be grouped under the classic or variant serotypes. In addition, new types of the virus continue to arise due to mutations and recombination events in the viral genome and even more factors, making this virus difficult to identify and extremely difficult to control. Surveillance and identification of IBV types are extremely important for control of the disease and the advancement of molecular methods has aided in this pursuit. Genetic typing of IBV, which involves reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction amplification and sequence analysis of the S1 glycoprotein gene, has revolutionized diagnosis and identification of this virus by making it possible to type and compare the relatedness of a large number of virus isolates in a short period of time. Several conventional and molecular diagnostic methods have been described for the diagnosis of IB in chickens. “All-in/all-out” operations of rearing along with good biosafety measures form the basis of prevention, whereas vaccination forms the backbone of IB control program. Both live and inactivated (oil emulsified) conventional vaccines are available. The new generation vaccines (recombinant and vector-based) developed against locally prevailing IBV strains may be more helpful and avoid the reversion of virulence in live vaccine viruses.","Ennaji, Youssef; Khataby, Khadija; Ennaji, Moulay Mustapha",Emerging and Reemerging Viral Pathogens,417,26

In this study, we investigated the effects of the siRNA targeting HCV‐RNA in vivo. Methods: We constructed recombinant retrovirus and adenovirus expressing short hairpin RNA (shRNA), and transfected into replicon‐expressing cells in vitro and transgenic mice in vivo. Results: Retroviral transduction of Huh7 cells to express shRNA and subsequent transfection of an HCV replicon into the cells showed that the cells had acquired resistance to HCV replication. Infection of cells expressing the HCV replicon with an adenovirus expressing shRNA resulted in efficient vector delivery and expression of shRNA, leading to suppression of the replicon in the cells by ∼10(−3). Intravenous delivery of the adenovirus expressing shRNA into transgenic mice that can be induced to express HCV structural proteins by the Cre/loxP switching system resulted in specific suppression of virus protein synthesis in the liver.

It was believed until recently that the only possible mechanism of RNA recombination is replicative template switching, with synthesis of a complementary strand starting on one viral RNA molecule and being completed on another. The newly synthesized RNA is a primary recombinant molecule in this case. Recent studies have revealed other mechanisms of replicative RNA recombination. In addition, recombination between the genomes of RNA viruses can be nonreplicative, resulting from a joining of preexisting parental molecules. Recombination is a potent tool providing for both the variation and conservation of the genome in RNA viruses. Replicative and nonreplicative mechanisms may contribute differently to each of these evolutionary processes. In the form of trans splicing, nonreplicative recombination of cell RNAs plays an important role in at least some organisms. It is conceivable that RNA recombination continues to contribute to the evolution of DNA genomes.","Gmyl, A. P.; Agol, V. I.",Mol Biol,417,17

A growing body of genetic and biochemical evidence and data from clinical trials confirms that cyclophilins are essential cofactors that contribute to establishing a permissive environment within the host cell that supports the replication of HIV-1 and HCV. Cyclophilin A regulates HIV-1 replication kinetics and infectivity, modulates sensitivity to host restriction factors, and cooperates in the transit of the pre-integration complex into the nucleus of infected cells. Cyclophilin A is an essential cofactor whose expression supports HCV-specific RNA replication in human hepatocytes. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: Peptidyl-prolyl isomerase inhibitors have been used in clinical trials to validate cyclophilins as antiviral targets for the treatment of HIV-1 and Chronic Hepatitis C virus infection and as molecular probes to identify the roles played by immunophilins in supporting the replication cycles of human viruses. SCOPE OF REVIEW: This review summarizes emerging research that defines the functions of immunophilins in supporting the replication cycles of HIV-1, HCV, HBV, coronaviruses, and other viral pathogens and describes new information that suggests a role for immunophilins in regulating innate immune responses against chronic viral infection. MAJOR CONCLUSIONS: The dependence on cyclophilins by evolutionarily distinct viruses for accomplishing various steps in replication such as viral entry, initiation of genomic nucleic acid replication, viral genome uncoating, nuclear import and nuclear entry, emphasizes the potential of cyclophilin inhibitors as therapeutic agents.","Hopkins, Sam; Gallay, Philippe A.",Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA) - General Subjects,417,20

This study analyzes the use and perception of telemedicine applications among physicians and patients in the field of sports medicine in Germany. Methods: This prospective cross-sectional study was based on a survey of sports medicine physicians and patients in Germany during the COVID-19 pandemic. Descriptive statistics were calculated. Results: We analyzed the responses of 729 patients and 702 sports medicine physicians. Most believed that telemedicine is useful. Both physicians and patients rated their knowledge of telemedicine as unsatisfactory. The majority of respondents said they do not currently use telemedicine but would like to do so. Patients and physicians reported that their attitude had changed positively towards telemedicine and that their usage had increased due to COVID-19. The majority in both groups agreed on implementing virtual visits in stable disease conditions. Telemedicine was considered helpful for follow-up monitoring and prevention by both groups. Conclusion: Telemedicine in sports medicine has seen limited use but is highly accepted among physicians and patients alike. The absence of a structured framework is an obstacle to effective implementation. Training courses should be introduced to improve the limited knowledge regarding the use of telemedicine.

In total, 2039 randomly selected students participated; the survey included ten questions specifically on the access to and use of digital technology. Half of the respondents had access to desktop/laptops, and one-third used mobile internet daily; about two-thirds had an experience of social media. Explanatory variables included educational institution, parental education, economic situation, and gender. Furthermore, students’ experience of social media was significantly linked to bullying, anxiety, depression, smoking and alcohol consumption. Many adolescents in Bissau have no experience of using digital technology, including for schoolwork. Access improvements are necessary so that young Bissau-Guineans are not to be left behind in developing their capabilities and can benefit from proficiency in the use of digital technologies. At the same time, potential harmful usage of the media requires the implementation of preventive measures.","Gunnlaugsson, Geir; Whitehead, Thomas Andrew; Baboudóttir, Fatou N’dure; Baldé, Aladje; Jandi, Zeca; Boiro, Hamadou; Einarsdóttir, Jónína",Int J Environ Res Public Health,417,24

Reduced A-to-I editing of endogenous double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs), as a result of inactivating mutations in ADAR, produces one form of Aicardi-Goutières Syndrome, with an immune response similar to an anti-viral response. By analyzing whole genome RNA sequencing data, we find reduced levels of A-to-I editing of endogenous Alu RNAs in normal human lung cells after infection by SARS-CoV-2 as well as in lung biopsies from patients with SARS-CoV-2 infections. Unedited Alu RNAs, as seen after infection, induce IRF and NF-kB transcriptional responses and downstream target genes, while edited Alu RNAs as seen in the absence of infection, fail to activate these transcriptional responses. Thus, decreased A-to-I editing may represent an important host response to SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Crooke, Philip S.; Tossberg, John T.; Porter, Krislyn P.; Aune, Thomas M.",Curr Res Immunol,417,18

To obtain comprehensive information about early immune responses such as innate cytokine production and associated immune regulation during IBV infection, we infected primary chicken embryonic kidney cells and performed transcriptome analysis. We observed that the functional pathways of innate immunity are regulated and confirmed expression of genes that coordinate early immune responses.

In the United States, Latinx, African American, and Indigenous populations across the country have been disproportionately affected by COVID-19 cases and death rates. An examination of the perceptions and beliefs about the spread of the virus, COVID-19 testing, and vaccination amongst racial/ethnic minority groups is needed in order to alleviate the widespread disparity in new cases and deaths. METHODS: From November to December 2020 the research team conducted focus groups with members of Latinx farm-working communities in the Eastern Coachella Valley, located in the inland southern California desert region. A total of seven focus groups, six in Spanish and one in Purepecha, with a total of 55 participants were conducted. Topics covered include knowledge of the coronavirus, COVID-19 testing and vaccination. RESULTS: Using theme identification techniques, the findings identify structural factors that underly perceptions held by immigrant, migrant, and indigenous Latinx community members about COVID-19, which, in turn, shape attitudes and behaviors related to COVID-19 testing and vaccination. Common themes that emerged across focus groups include misinformation, lack of trust in institutions, and insecurity around employment and residency. CONCLUSIONS: This racial/ethnic minority population is structurally vulnerable to historical and present-day inequalities that put them at increased risk of COVID-19 exposure, morbidity, and mortality. Findings from the focus groups indicate a significant need for interventions that decrease structural vulnerabilities by addressing issues of (dis)trust in government and public health among this population.","Gehlbach, Daniel; Vázquez, Evelyn; Ortiz, Gabriela; Li, Erica; Sánchez, Cintya Beltrán; Rodríguez, Sonia; Pozar, María; Cheney, Ann Marie",Res Sq,417,1

While our current understanding of COVID-19 pathogenesis is limited, a better understanding will help us develop efficacious treatment and prevention strategies for COVID-19. One potential therapeutic target is angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). ACE2 primarily catalyzes the conversion of angiotensin I (Ang I) to a nonapeptide angiotensin or the conversion of angiotensin II (Ang II) to angiotensin 1-7 (Ang 1-7) and has direct effects on cardiac function and multiple organs via counter-regulation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). Significant to COVID-19, ACE2 is postulated to serve as a major entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2 in human cells, as it does for SARS-CoV. Many infected individuals develop COVID-19 with fever, cough, and shortness of breath that can progress to pneumonia. Disease progression promotes the activation of immune cells, platelets, and coagulation pathways that can lead to multiple organ failure and death. ACE2 is expressed by epithelial cells of the lungs at high level, a major target of the disease, as seen in post-mortem lung tissue of patients who died with COVID-19, which reveals diffuse alveolar damage with cellular fibromyxoid exudates bilaterally. Comparatively, ACE2 is expressed at low level by vascular endothelial cells of the heart and kidney but may also be targeted by the virus in severe COVID-19 cases. Interestingly, SARS-CoV-2 infection downregulates ACE2 expression, which may also play a critical pathogenic role in COVID-19. Importantly, targeting ACE2/Ang 1-7 axis and blocking ACE2 interaction with the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 to curtail SARS-CoV-2 infection are becoming very attractive therapeutics potential for treatment and prevention of COVID-19. Here, we will discuss the following subtopics: 1) ACE2 as a receptor of SARS-CoV-2; 2) clinical and pathological features of COVID-19; 3) role of ACE2 in the infection and pathogenesis of SARS; 4) potential pathogenic role of ACE2 in COVID-19; 5) animal models for pathological studies and therapeutics; and 6) therapeutics development for COVID-19.","Datta, Prasun K.; Liu, Fengming; Fischer, Tracy; Rappaport, Jay; Qin, Xuebin",Theranostics,417,26

This assumption has guided behavioral and neural science research for decades, and tremendous empirical and theoretical advances have been made identifying the mechanisms of cue competition. However, when learning conditions are not optimal (e.g., when training is massed), cue competition is attenuated. This failure of the learning system exposes the individual’s vulnerability to form spurious associations in the real world. Here, we uncover that cue competition in rats can be rescued when conditions are suboptimal provided that the individual has agency over the learning experience. Our findings reveal a new effect of agency over learning on credit assignment among predictive cues, and open new avenues of investigation into the underlying mechanisms.","Kang, Mihwa; Reverte, Ingrid; Volz, Stephen; Kaufman, Keith; Fevola, Salvatore; Matarazzo, Anna; Alhazmi, Fahd H.; Marquez, Inmaculada; Iordanova, Mihaela D.; Esber, Guillem R.",Sci Rep,417,18

We used the Korean version of the expanded clinical dementia rating scale to evaluate participants’ cognitive impairments, and the University of Pennsylvania’s smell identification test to assess their olfactory function. Our results indicate a significant negative correlation between olfactory function and all domains of cognitive impairment (memory, orientation, judgement and problem-solving, community affairs, home and hobbies, and personal care).

This report describes the design and validation of a patient-administered preanaesthesia health assessment digital application for gathering medical history relevant to preanaesthesia assessment. Effective preoperative evaluation allows for timely optimization of medical conditions and reduces case cancellations on day of surgery. METHODS: Using an iterative mixed-methods approach of literature review, surveys and panel consensus, the study sought to develop and validate a digitized preanaesthesia health assessment questionnaire in terms of face and criterion validity. A total of 228 patients were enrolled at the preoperative evaluation clinic of a tertiary women’s hospital. Inclusion criteria include: age ≥ 21 years, scheduled for same-day-admission surgery, literacy in English and willingness to use a digital device. Patient perception of the digitized application was also evaluated using the QQ10 questionnaire. Reliability of health assessment questionnaire was evaluated by comparing the percentage agreement of patient responses with nurse assessment. RESULTS: Moderate to good criterion validity was obtained in 81.1 and 83.8% of questions for the paper and digital questionnaires respectively. Of total 3626 response-pairs obtained, there were 3405 (93.4%) concordant and 221 (6.1%) discrepant response-pairs for the digital questionnaire. Discrepant response-pairs, such as ““no/yes” and “unsure/yes”, constitute only 3.7% of total response-pairs. Patient acceptability of the digitized assessment was high, with QQ10 value and burden scores of 76 and 30%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Self-administration of digitized preanaesthesia health assessment is acceptable to patients and reliable in eliciting medical history. Further iteration should focus on improving reliability of the digital tool, adapting it for use in other languages and incorporating clinical decision tools.

SHIP has previously been shown to play a pivotal role in limiting the number of immunoregulatory cells and their function. AIM: To determine whether SHIP plays a pivotal role in control of immune tolerance in the gut mucosa. METHODS: Gastrointestinal pathology was assessed in three separate strains of SHIP-deficient mice and their respective wild-type (WT) littermates. Gastrointestinal pathology was analysed in SHIP-deficient hosts reconstituted with WT haematopoietic cell grafts, and WT hosts reconstituted with SHIP-deficient haematopoietic cell grafts including whole splenocytes, purified T cells or natural killer (NK) cells. Major immune cell populations were also analysed in the small intestine of SHIP-deficient mice and WT controls. RESULTS: SHIP-deficient mice developed segmental, transmural pyo-granulomatous ilietis that recapitulated classical features of Crohn's disease enteric pathology. Analysis of haematopoietic chimeras showed that WT bone marrow reconstitution of SHIP(−/−) hosts corrects ileitis. Reconstitution with SHIP(−/−) splenocytes transferred ileitis to WT hosts. Adoptive transfer of purified SHIP(−/−) T cells or NK cells to WT hosts did not transfer ileitis. There was a paucity of both CD4 and CD8 T cells in the small intestines of SHIP-deficient mice; however, neutrophil numbers were significantly increased. CONCLUSIONS: SHIP plays a pivotal role in immune function in the intestine; further scrutiny of this pathway in IBD patients is warranted. It is proposed that SHIP-deficient ileitis results from a local deficit in mucosal T cell immunity that promotes a damaging granulocyte–monocyte inflammation of the distal ileum.","Kerr, William G; Park, Mi-Young; Maubert, Monique; Engelman, Robert W",Gut,417,22

We assessed the influence of LDT events on the invasive spread of raccoon rabies through Connecticut. We identified several putative LDT events, and developed a network-model to evaluate whether they became new foci for epidemic spread. LDT was fairly common, but many of the LDTs were isolated events that did not spread. Two putative LDT events did appear to become nascent foci that affected the epidemic in surrounding townships. In evaluating the role of LDT, we simultaneously revisited the problem of spatial heterogeneity. The spread of raccoon rabies is associated with forest cover—rabies moves up to three-times slower through the most heavily forested townships compared with those with less forestation. Forestation also modified the effect of rivers. In the best overall model, rabies did not cross the river separating townships that were heavily forested, and the spread slowed substantially between townships that were lightly forested. Our results suggest that spatial heterogeneity can be used to enhance the effects of rabies control by focusing vaccine bait distribution along rivers in lightly forested areas. LDT events are a concern, but this analysis suggests that at a local scale they can be isolated and managed.","Smith, D.L.; Waller, L.A.; Russell, C.A.; Childs, J.E.; Real, L.A.",Prev Vet Med,417,16

We applied air–liquid interface (ALI) cultures of well-differentiated porcine airway cells to mimic the respiratory tract epithelium in vitro and use it for analyzing the infection by PRCoV. As reported for most coronaviruses, virus entry and virus release occurred mainly via the apical membrane domain. A novel finding was that PRCoV preferentially targets non-ciliated and among them the non-mucus-producing cells. Aminopeptidase N (APN), the cellular receptor for PRCoV was also more abundantly expressed on this type of cell suggesting that APN is a determinant of the cell tropism. Interestingly, differentiation-dependent differences were found both in the expression of pAPN and the susceptibility to PRCoV infection. Cells in an early differentiation stage express higher levels of pAPN and are more susceptible to infection by PRCoV than are well-differentiated cells. A difference in the susceptibility to infection was also detected when tracheal and bronchial cells were compared. The increased susceptibility to infection of bronchial epithelial cells was, however, not due to an increased abundance of APN on the cell surface.

Similar and different characteristics between KD and MIS-C have been reported in a variety of literature. We aimed to focus on reviewing clinical presentations, diagnosis, and treatment of KD and MIS-C. METHODS: We searched articles in the electronic databases, including the Cochrane Library database, EMBASE, and MEDLINE with the keywords “multiple inflammatory syndrome” and/or “COVID-19” and/or “Kawasaki disease” and “children”. RESULTS: Main presentations of MIS-C and KD include fever, rashes, mucous membrane involvement, conjunctivitis, hands and feet erythema/edema, and cervical lymphadenopathy. However, compared with the highest incidence of KD among some Asian countries, MIS-C is common among Black and Hispanic children. MIS-C is common in older children and teenagers, whereas classic KD is common in children under five years of age. Gastrointestinal symptoms, shock, and coagulopathy are common in MIS-C patients but are not common in classic KD. Cardiac manifestations are more common than KD, including myocarditis with cardiac dysfunction and coronary artery dilation or aneurysms. Severe cases in MIS-C present with vasodilated or cardiogenic shock that requires fluid resuscitation, muscular support, and even mechanical ventilation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), whereas KD rarely presents with these manifestations and requires these treatments. Increased serum ferritin, leukopenia, lymphopenia and thrombocytopenia are common in MIS-C. However, thrombocytosis is a characteristic feature of KD. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and moderate-high dose aspirin are still a standard recommended treatment for KD. In addition to the above-mentioned medications, steroids and biological drugs are frequently used in patients with MIS-C. Most of the children with KD have a good prognosis; however, the long-term clinical outcomes of MIS-C are not clear. CONCLUSIONS: The overall presentation and treatment of MIS-C appear to overlap with KD. However, there are still great differences between the syndromes, and it is controversial to say whether MIS-C is a new entity or is a “severe type” of KD.","Zhang, Qing-You; Xu, Bo-Wen; Du, Jun-Bao",World J Pediatr,417,10

Recently, it was suggested that a dysregulated bradykinin signaling can trigger the cytokine storm observed in patients with severe Covid-19. In the scope of a drug repurposing campaign undertaken to identify bradykinin antagonists, raloxifene was identified as prospective compound in a virtual screening process. The pharmacodynamics profile of raloxifene towards bradykinin receptors is reported in the present work, showing a weak selective partial agonist profile at the B2 receptor. In view of this new profile, its possible use as a therapeutical agent for the treatment of severe Covid-19 is discussed.","Gomez-Gutierrez, Patricia; Perez, Juan J.",Int J Mol Sci,417,20

If the government decides to impose a lockdown, it has to determine its intensity, timing and duration. We find that there are two competing effects that push the decision in opposite directions. An early lockdown is beneficial not only to slow down the spread of the disease, but creates beneficial habit formation (such as social distancing, developing hygienic habits) that persists even after the lockdown is lifted. Against this benefit of an early lockdown, there is a cost from loss of information about the virulence and spread of the disease in the population in addition to a direct cost to the economy. Based on the prior probability of the disease being virulent, we characterize the timing, intensity and duration of a lockdown with the above mentioned tradeoffs. Specifically, we show that as the precision of learning goes up, a government tends to delay the imposition of lockdown. Conversely, if the habit formation parameter is very strong, a government is likely to impose an early lockdown.","Bandyopadhyay, Siddhartha; Chatterjee, Kalyan; Das, Kaustav; Roy, Jaideep",J Math Econ,417,33

OBJECTIVE To determine whether the ongoing pandemic has changed people's habits related to skincare products and cosmetic procedures. METHODS We conducted a multicenter survey study covering both private and public hospitals. Sociodemographic characteristics and clinical diagnoses of the patients were noted by dermatologists. A survey was used to determine the type and application areas of skincare products and cosmetic procedures before and during the pandemic, whether the patients were concerned about being infected, and any change in the make-up habits of female patients. RESULTS Of the 1437 patients, 86.7% presented to the hospital due to dermatological complaints and 13.3% for cosmetic procedures. The rate of those that did not use skincare products was 0.05% before and 0.06% during the pandemic. Of the participants, 43.2% had undergone cosmetic procedures before and 38.1% during the pandemic. For both periods, the most frequent cosmetic procedure applied was laser epilation, followed by skincare treatment and chemical peeling. While undergoing these procedures, 34.9% of the patients were concerned about contracting coronavirus. CONCLUSION There was no significant difference in the use of skincare products and cosmetic procedures before and during the pandemic. The majority of the patients continued to undergo these procedures despite their fear of being infected. This shows that during the pandemic period, patients are concerned with their appearance and continue to undergo cosmetic procedures and pay attention to their skincare.","Aslan Kayıran, Melek; Kara Polat, Asude; Alyamaç, Gökçen; Demirseren, Düriye Deniz; Taş, Betül; Kalkan, Göknur; Özkök Akbulut, Tuğba; Kaya Özden, Hatice; Koska, Mahmut Can; Emre, Selma; Kaya Erdoğan, Hilal; Tükenmez Demirci, Gülşen; Güngör, Şule; Özcan Arslan, Nimet; Ağaoğlu, Esra; Kurmuş, Gökçe Işıl; Aksoy, Hasan; Tatlıparmak, Aslı; Süslü, Hülya; Oğuz Topal, İlteriş; Topaloğlu Demir, Filiz; Acer, Ersoy; Duman, Hatice; Gürel, Mehmet Salih; Karadağ, Ayşe Serap",Journal of cosmetic dermatology,417,2

Based on the survey results, limited monitoring and maintenance of instrumentation and sensors are among the critical factors during the pandemic which resulted in poor data quality in several WRRFs. Due to lockdown of cities and countries, most of the facilities observed interruptions of chemical supply frequency which impacted the treatment process involving chemical additions. Some plants observed influent flow reduction and illicit discharges from industrial wastewater which eventually affected the biological treatment processes. Delays in equipment maintenance also increased the operational and maintenance cost. Most of the plants reported that new set of personnel management rules during pandemic created difficulties in scheduling operator's shifts which directly hampered the plant operations. All the plant operators mentioned that automation, instrumentation, and sensor applications could help plant operations more efficiently while working remotely during pandemic.

Methods: We retrospectively analysed the epidemiological information, discharge summaries, and laboratory results of 324 patients. Results: In all, 15 (8.62%) patients experienced chest distress/breath shortness, where 8 of the 15 were severely ill. This means severely ill patients need an extended amount of time to recover after discharge; next, 20 (11.49%) patients experienced anxiety and 21 (12.07%) had headache/insomnia and a small fraction of them complained of anosmia/ageusia, indicating that these patients need treatment for mental and psychological health issues. Regarding the re-positive patients, their CT and laboratory test results showed no obvious evidence of illness progress or infectivity but a high anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody expression.

DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: India, multiple regions representing combined population >150 million. PARTICIPANTS: Aggregate infection counts were drawn from four large population-representative prevalence/seroprevalence surveys. Data on corresponding number of deaths were drawn from official government reports of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 deaths. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was age-specific and sex-specific infection fatality rate (IFR), estimated as the number of confirmed deaths per infection. The secondary outcome was the slope of the IFR-by-age function, representing increased risk associated with age. RESULTS: Among males aged 50–89, measured IFR was 0.12% in Karnataka (95% CI 0.09% to 0.15%), 0.42% in Tamil Nadu (95% CI 0.39% to 0.45%), 0.53% in Mumbai (95% CI 0.52% to 0.54%) and an imprecise 5.64% (95% CI 0% to 11.16%) among migrants returning to Bihar. Estimated IFR was approximately twice as high for males as for females, heterogeneous across contexts and rose less dramatically at older ages compared with similar studies in high-income countries. CONCLUSIONS: Estimated age-specific IFRs during the first wave varied substantially across India. While estimated IFRs in Mumbai, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu were considerably lower than comparable estimates from high-income countries, adjustment for under-reporting based on crude estimates of excess mortality puts them almost exactly equal with higher-income country benchmarks. In a marginalised migrant population, estimated IFRs were much higher than in other contexts around the world. Estimated IFRs suggest that the elderly in India are at an advantage relative to peers in high-income countries. Our findings suggest that the standard estimation approach may substantially underestimate IFR in low-income settings due to under-reporting of COVID-19 deaths, and that COVID-19 IFRs may be similar in low-income and high-income settings.","Cai, Rebecca; Novosad, Paul; Tandel, Vaidehi; Asher, Sam; Malani, Anup",BMJ Open,417,16

Furthermore, the exuberant immune response is considered an important driver of pulmonary and extrapulmonary manifestations of COVID-19. The optimal management strategy to prevent thrombosis in critically-ill patients with COVID-19 remains unknown. METHODS: The Intermediate versus Standard-dose Prophylactic anticoagulation In cRitically-ill pATIents with COVID-19: An opeN label randomized controlled trial (INSPIRATION) and INSPIRATION-statin (INSPIRATION-S) studies test two independent hypotheses within a randomized control trial with 2 × 2 factorial design. Hospitalized critically-ill patients with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction confirmed COVID-19 will be randomized to intermediate-dose versus standard dose prophylactic anticoagulation. The 600 patients undergoing this randomization will be screened and if meeting the eligibility criteria, will undergo an additional double-blind stratified randomization to atorvastatin 20 mg daily versus matching placebo. The primary endpoint, for both hypotheses will be tested for superiority and includes a composite of adjudicated acute arterial thrombosis, venous thromboembolism (VTE), use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, or all-cause death within 30 days from enrollment. Key secondary endpoints include all-cause mortality, adjudicated VTE, and ventilator-free days. Key safety endpoints include major bleeding according to the Bleeding Academic Research Consortium definition and severe thrombocytopenia (platelet count <20,000/fL) for the anticoagulation hypothesis. In a prespecified secondary analysis for non-inferiority, the study will test for the non-inferiority of intermediate intensity versus standard dose anticoagulation for major bleeding, considering a non-inferiority margin of 1.8 based on odds ratio. Key safety endpoints for the statin hypothesis include rise in liver enzymes >3 times upper normal limit and clinically-diagnosed myopathy. The primary analyses will be performed in the modified intention-to-treat population. Results will be tested in exploratory analyses across key subgroups and in the intention-to-treat and per-protocol cohorts.

Critical to the acquisition of reliable results is the preparation of the RNA. In the field of virology, when analyzing the host cell's reaction to infection, the often high representation of viral RNA (vRNA) within total RNA preparations from infected cells is likely to interfere with microarray analysis. Yet, this effect has not been investigated despite the many reports that describe gene expression profiling of virus-infected cells using microarrays. RESULTS: In this study we used coronaviruses as a model to show that vRNA indeed interferes with microarray analysis, decreasing both sensitivity and accuracy. We also demonstrate that the removal of vRNA from total RNA samples, by means of virus-specific oligonucleotide capturing, significantly reduced the number of false-positive hits and increased the sensitivity of the method as tested on different array platforms. CONCLUSION: We therefore recommend the specific removal of vRNA, or of any other abundant 'contaminating' RNAs, from total RNA samples to improve the quality and reliability of microarray analyses.","Raaben, Matthijs; Whitley, Penn; Bouwmeester, Diane; Setterquist, Robert A; Rottier, Peter JM; de Haan, Cornelis AM",BMC Genomics,417,17

METHODS: We conducted an observational cohort study of intubated patients admitted to our academic medical centre intensive care unit with COVID-19 between March 18-31 2020. Exclusion criteria were pregnancy, reintubation and previous prone positioning at a referring hospital. Patients that were placed in the prone position were followed up until hospital discharge. The primary outcome was oxygenation assessed by arterial oxygen tension/fraction of inspired oxygen ratio (PaO(2)/F(I)O(2)). Secondary outcomes included PaO(2)/F(I)O(2) ratio improvement ≥20%. Treatment failure of prone positioning was defined as death or requirement for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). RESULTS: Forty-two subjects (29 males; mean age:58.5 [12.7] years) were eligible for analysis. Nine subjects were placed in the prone position only once, with 25 requiring prone positioning on ≥3 occasions. 31/42 (74%) subjects survived to discharge, with 5 requiring ECMO; 11/42 (26.2%) subjects died. Following the first prone positioning session, mean (SD) PaO(2)/F(I)O(2) ratio increased from 17.9kPa (7.2) to 28.2kPa (12.2) (p<0.01). With repeated prone positioning sessions, 31/42 (73.8%) subjects who were discharged from hospital had PaO(2)/F(I)O(2) ratio improvement of ≥20%, compared to 11/42 subjects who either died or required ECMO (odds ratio:XX (95% confidence intervals:xx-xx)).

Telemedicine is a good option to help reduce in-person visits during the pandemic. Saudi Arabia has prepared for this pandemic by implementing applications, such as Tetamman and Seha. In this study, we aimed to determine the readiness of the Saudi population to use telemedicine for musculoskeletal care during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted from July 2020 to October 2020. The study used a predesigned, self-administered questionnaire with acceptable internal consistency (Cronbach’s α=0.79). A questionnaire with 30 questions was distributed electronically and randomly to the Saudi population. The included participants were Arabic speakers, Saudis, and men or women age 18 years or older. Results: A total of 635 respondents, of which 250 were men (39.4%) and 385 were women (60.6%), completed the questionnaire. The most common region of residence was the Central region (41.6%), followed by the Eastern region (28%). The proportions of patients who had knowledge about virtual clinics and who used a virtual clinic during the COVID-19 pandemic were 47.6% and 30.4%, respectively. The mean overall attitude score was 24.4 (standard deviation, 9.9) of 35 points; negative, neutral, and positive attitudes were reported among 9.9%, 54.3%, and 35.7% of respondents, respectively. Compared with the older population, younger-aged participants (≤25 years) had significantly more positive attitudes about virtual clinics (χ(2)=6.068; p=0.048). Those respondents who had never been married showed significantly more positive attitudes about virtual clinics compared with those who had been married (χ(2)=6.695; p=0.035). Conclusions: The studied Saudi population shows a moderate level of acceptance of the concept of using telemedicine in musculoskeletal conditions, but some issues about patient access and understanding of the technology remain unaddressed.","Alhamam, Naif M; Buhalim, Rayan A; Almakhayitah, Ibrahim H; AlBahr, Abdulelah W; AlYaeesh, Ibrahim A",Cureus,417,16

Specific populations including refugees, asylum seekers, and prisoners, are vulnerable groups with multiple complex health needs and worse health outcomes with respect to the general population worldwide and at high risk of death from the “Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-related Coronavirus type 2” (SARS-CoV-2). Governments around the world have been implementing preventive healthcare policies, including physical and social distancing, isolation, and confinement, to mitigate against the burden imposed by the COVID-19 outbreak. This pandemic period is characterized by reduced or lack of movement. During this period of lockdown, PA can represent an immunotherapy and a preventative approach to avoid the harmful effects of inactivity due to the pandemic. Moreover, PA could be prescribed to improve the immune system of specific populations (refugees, asylum seekers, and prisoners), which particularly experience the condition of being confined.

Contact patterns in populations, and in particular intergenerational contacts, have been argued to be responsible for the most vulnerable, the elderly, getting infected more often and thus driving up mortality in some context, like in the southern European one. This paper asks a simple question: is it between whom contacts occur that matters or is it simply how many contacts people have? Due to the high number of confounding factors, it is extremely difficult to empirically assess the impact of single network features separately. This is why we rely on a simulation exercise in which we counterfactually manipulate single aspects of countries’ age distribution and network structures. We disentangle the contributions of the kind and of the number of contacts while holding constant the age structure. More precisely, we isolate the respective effects of inter-age contact patterns, degree distribution and clustering on the virus propagation across age groups. We use survey data on face-to-face contacts for Great Britain, Italy, and Germany, to reconstruct networks that mirror empirical contact patterns in these three countries. It turns out that the number of social contacts (degree distribution) largely accounts for the higher infection rates of the elderly in the Italian context, while differences in inter-age contacts patterns are only responsible for minor differences. This suggests that policies specifically targeting inter-age contacts would be little effective.","Sage, Lucas; Albertini, Marco; Scherer, Stefani",PLoS One,417,16

METHODS: A web-based cross-sectional survey was conducted from June to mid-August 2020. RESULTS: In total, 394 teachers completed the questionnaire, and from those, 320 also completed an optional open-ended question included in the survey. More than half of the participants reported taking care of children under 11 years and/or adults over 65 years. At the time of the study, most of the participants were teaching in higher education settings. Age was significantly correlated with all the psychological variables, females presented higher levels of perceived stress, and teachers with home care responsibilities presented higher psychological distress as well as perceived stress. Teachers who had previous training and experience with online teaching presented lower levels of distress, perceived stress as well as higher levels of life satisfaction. The most used coping strategies included seeking social support, exercising, and engaging in leisure activities.

CASE SUMMARY: A 45-year-old Caucasian male with no past medical history was admitted with chest pain. The electrocardiogram demonstrated diffuse ST-segment elevation, the troponin T rose, and he was diagnosed with myopericarditis. He was noted to have markedly deranged thyroid function tests and a diagnosis of hyperthyroidism secondary to Graves’ disease was made. He was treated with Bisoprolol, Carbimazole, Prednisolone, Ibuprofen, and Colchicine, his symptoms resolved rapidly and he was discharged. Five weeks later he re-presented with similar symptoms and recurrent pericarditis was diagnosed. His symptoms settled with a repeat course of steroids. DISCUSSION: We hypothesize that there may be an underappreciated link between hyperthyroidism and myopericarditis. Potential pathophysiological mechanisms include viral infection, autoimmunity, or changes in myocardial fat metabolism. Suggested management consists of a combination of current guidelines for the treatment of hyperthyroidism and pericardial disease, with attention to certain disease–drug interactions. Further research is required to evaluate the true incidence of hyperthyroidism-associated myopericarditis, elucidate its pathophysiology and instruct management.","Thomson, Ross J; Rossberg, Nora; Davar, Joseph; Whelan, Carol",Eur Heart J Case Rep,417,8

METHODS: We examined 112 neonates. Inclusion criteria were: Saturations greater than 88%, and heart rates between 100–205 beats per minute. MEASUREMENTS: We assessed several neurodevelopmental factors as part of the Brazelton Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale (NBAS), 4th edition, such as asymmetric tonic neck reflex (ATNR), motor maturity, response to sensory stimuli, habituation, and state regulation. Initial assessment parameters such as APGAR score and umbilical cord arterial pH were used to assess neonates. RESULTS: We found a strong correlation between the presence of the sucking reflex and umbilical cord arterial pH (r = 0.32; p = 0.018981). Umbilical cord arterial pH was also correlated with the presence of asymmetric tonic neck reflex (r = 0.27; p = 0.047124), cost of attention (r = 0.31; p = 0.025381) and general motor maturity (r = 0.34; p = 0.011741). CONCLUSIONS: We found that the sucking reflex may be affected in infants with low umbilical cord arterial pH values. Practitioners and parents can use the NBAS to help determine neurodevelopmental factors and outcomes in preterm infants, possibly leading to safer and more effective feeding practices and interventions.","Malak, Roksana; Sikorska, Dorota; Rosołek, Marta; Baum, Ewa; Mojs, Ewa; Daroszewski, Przemysław; Matecka, Monika; Fechner, Brittany; Samborski, Włodzimierz",PeerJ,417,26

Being a novel disease, current research is focused on a clearer understanding of the mechanisms involved in its pathogenesis and viable therapeutic strategies. Oxidative stress and inflammation are intertwined processes that play roles in disease progression and response to therapy via interference with multiple signaling pathways. The redox status of a host cell is an important factor in viral entry due to the unique conditions required for the conformational changes that ensure the binding and entry of a virus into the host cell. Upon entry into the airways, viral replication occurs and the innate immune system responds by activating macrophage and dendritic cells which contribute to inflammation. This review examines available literature and proposes mechanisms by which oxidative stress and inflammation could contribute to COVID-19 pathogenesis. Further, certain antioxidants currently undergoing some form of trial in COVID-19 patients and the corresponding required research gaps are highlighted to show how targeting oxidative stress and inflammation could ameliorate COVID-19 severity.","Forcados, Gilead Ebiegberi; Muhammad, Aliyu; Oladipo, Olusola Olalekan; Makama, Sunday; Meseko, Clement Adebajo",Front Cell Infect Microbiol,417,20

Overall, vaccine was well tolerated, with mild non-hematologic vaccine-reported adverse events in minority of the patients. 12% (after first dose) and 10% (after second dose) of the patients developed cytopenia and there were 3 cases GVHD exacerbation after each dose. A single case of impending graft rejection was summarized as possibly related. Evaluation of immunogenicity showed that 57% of patients after CART infusion and 75% patients after allogeneic HCT had evidence of humoral and/or cellular response to the vaccine. On cox regression model, longer time from infusion of cells, female sex, and higher CD19(+) cells were associated with a positive humoral response, whereas higher CD4(+)/CD8(+) ratiowas correlated with a positive cellular response, confirmed by ELISpot test. We conclude that BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine has impressive immunogenicity in patients after allogeneic HCT or CART.

The most affected European countries are, so far, Italy and Spain. In both countries (and others), the authorities decreed a lockdown, with local specificities. The objective of this work is to evaluate the impact of the measures undertaken in Spain to deal with the pandemic. Method: We estimated the number of cases and the impact of lockdown on the reproducibility number based on the hospitalization reports up to April 15th 2020. Results: The estimated number of cases shows a sharp increase until the lockdown, followed by a slowing down and then a decrease after full quarantine was implemented. Differences in the basic reproduction ratio are also significant, dropping from de 5.89 (95% confidence interval [95%CI]: 5.46-7.09) before the lockdown to 0.48 (95%CI: 0.15-1.17) afterwards. Conclusions: Handling a pandemic like COVID-19 is complex and requires quick decision making. The large differences found in the speed of propagation of the disease show us that being able to implement interventions at the earliest stage is crucial to minimise the impact of a potential infectious threat. Our work also stresses the importance of reliable up to date epidemiological data in order to accurately assess the impact of Public Health policies on viral outbreak. RESUMEN Objetivo: El brote de COVID-19 a finales de 2019 ha puesto los sistemas de salud de muchos países al límite de su capacidad. Los países europeos más afectados son, hasta ahora, Italia y España. En ambos (y en otros países), las autoridades decretaron un confinamiento, con especificidades locales. El objetivo de este trabajo es evaluar el impacto de las medidas adoptadas en España para hacer frente a la pandemia. Método: Estimamos el número de casos y el impacto del confinamiento en el número básico de reproducción según los informes de hospitalización hasta el 15 de abril de 2020. Resultados: El número estimado de casos muestra un fuerte aumento hasta el bloqueo, seguido de una desaceleración y luego una disminución tras la implementación del confinamiento total. Las diferencias en el número básico de reproducción también son muy significativas, cayendo de 5,89 (intervalo de confianza del 95% [IC95%]: 5,46-7,09) antes del bloqueo a 0,48 (IC95%: 0,15-1,17) después. Conclusiones: Gestionar una pandemia como la de COVID-19 es muy complejo y requiere una rápida toma de decisiones. Las grandes diferencias encontradas en la velocidad de propagación de la enfermedad muestran que poder implementar intervenciones en la etapa más temprana es crucial para minimizar el impacto de una potencial amenaza.

This quantity represented Gilead’s then full production capacity for July and 90% of its capacity for August and September. Similar deals are evident around access to proposed vaccines for COVID-19, and such deals are only likely to increase. These attempts to secure preferential access to medicines and vaccines, so-called vaccine/treatment nationalism, jeopardise supplies of life-saving treatments and vaccines available elsewhere, and jeopardise global equitable distribution of such vaccines/treatments more generally. Much of the focus to date has been on States’ role in negotiating such deals. However, such developments also demonstrate the power patent holders have in controlling access to life-saving healthcare, determining who obtains access first and at what price. This article argues that the extent of control currently given to patent holders for COVID-19 must be questioned. This article demonstrates that patents have significant implications for healthcare acting as private governance tools over patented inventions. It is only by greater probing of patent holders’ role in delivering access to medicines, diagnostics and vaccines for COVID-19 that equitable global equitable access can be achieved.","McMahon, Aisling",J Med Ethics,417,10

Due to social distancing measures, contact restrictions and fears of infection, social life has changed significantly. These measures along with the stressors associated with the current worldwide situation, will inevitably have an effect on people's interpersonal and personal behaviors. AIM: This study evaluates the effect the COVID-19 pandemic and nationwide German lockdown had on the sexual behavior of cis men. METHODS: An anonymous nationwide web-based questionnaire was conducted among cis men in Germany during the first COVID-19 home isolation (April 20, 2020–July 20, 2020). The questionnaire was distributed via e-mail, online chats and social-media platforms. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Data was collected on general characteristics including demographics and socio-economic backgrounds. To evaluate sexual health, questions from the Sexual Behavior Questionnaire were included. RESULTS: 523 cis male participated. 414 met the inclusion criteria. Most were heterosexual (n = 248, 59.9%; vs homosexual n = 97, 23.4%; vs bisexual n = 69, 16.7%). 243 (59%) were employed, 153 (37.1%) were students and 16 (3.9%) were unemployed. Most of the participants reported an annual income lower than 75.000€. During the lockdown, average weekly frequency of sexual intercourse and masturbation was increased in all groups. Consistently, a significant rise of higher satisfaction with the frequency of sexual contacts during the quarantine was observed (P < .05). Furthermore, the level of sexual arousal increased significantly in all groups (P < .0005). Capability to enjoy sexual intercourse or masturbation increased significantly in heterosexual (P < .0005) and homosexual men (P < .005). Bisexual participants showed a significant increase in general satisfaction with sexual life (P < .05) and a significant decrease in satisfaction in relationship or single life (P < .05). Positive confounders in the changing of sexual behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic were: Being in a relationship or being single, parenthood and being employed. CONCLUSION: Our study firstly describes how COVID-19 pandemic related restrictions and social distancing measurements altered sexual behavior amongst cis male in Germany. Further studies, including sexual minorities specifically, are needed to clarify if the behavior in the first German nationwide quarantine has persisted or transformed as the pandemic proceeded.

Therapeutic strategies targeting latent cells are required to achieve a functional cure, however the study of latently infected cells from HIV infected persons is extremely challenging due to the lack of biomarkers that uniquely characterize them. In this study, the dual reporter virus HIV(GKO) was used to investigate latency establishment and maintenance in lymphoid-derived CD4(+) T cells. Single cell technologies to evaluate protein expression, host gene expression, and HIV transcript expression were integrated to identify and analyze latently infected cells. FDA-approved, JAK1/2 inhibitors were tested in this system as a potential therapeutic strategy to target the latent reservoir. Latent and productively infected tonsillar CD4(+) T cells displayed similar activation profiles as measured by expression of CD69, CD25, and HLADR, however latent cells showed higher CXCR5 expression 3 days post-infection. Single cell analysis revealed a small set of genes, including HIST1-related genes and the inflammatory cytokine, IL32, that were upregulated in latent compared to uninfected and productively infected cells suggesting a role for these molecular pathways in persistent HIV infection. In vitro treatment of HIV-infected CD4(+) T cells with physiological concentrations of JAK1/2 inhibitors, ruxolitinib and baricitinib, used in clinical settings to target inflammation, reduced latent and productive infection events when added 24 hr after infection and blocked HIV reactivation from latent cells. Our methods using an established model of HIV latency and lymphoid-derived cells shed light on the biology of latency in a crucial anatomical site for HIV persistence and provides key insights about repurposing baricitinib or ruxolitinib to target the HIV reservoir.","de Armas, Lesley R.; Gavegnano, Christina; Pallikkuth, Suresh; Rinaldi, Stefano; Pan, Li; Battivelli, Emilie; Verdin, Eric; Younis, Ramzi T.; Pahwa, Rajendra; Williams, Siôn L.; Schinazi, Raymond F.; Pahwa, Savita",Front Immunol,417,16

Here, we analyze the use of emergency provisions during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic and find that it can be largely explained by drawing on political economy. It does, hence, not constitute an exception. We show that many governments have (mis-)used the pandemic as a pretext to curtail media freedom.

They are the largest group of viruses causing respiratory and gastrointestinal infections. Morphologically, CoVs are enveloped viruses containing a non-segmented positive-sense, single-stranded ribonucleic acid (RNA) viruses. CoVs are categorized into four important genera that include Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Gammacoronavirus, and Deltacoronavirus. A novel member of human CoV that has recently emerged in Wuhan, China, is now formally named as SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2). This is a unique strain of RNA viruses that have not been previously observed in humans. The virus has wide host adaptability and is capable of causing severe diseases in humans, masked palm civets, mice, dogs, cats, camels, pigs, chickens, and bats. The SARS-CoV-2 typically causes respiratory and gastrointestinal sickness in both humans and animals. It can be transmitted through aerosols and direct/indirect contact, as well as during medical cases and laboratory sample handling. Specific structural proteins, which might be found on the surface of the virus, play an important role in the pathogenesis and development of the complications. The disease is characterized by distinct medical signs and symptoms that include high fever, chills, cough, and shortness of breath or difficulty in breathing. The infected people may also present with other symptoms such as diarrhea, myalgia, fatigue, expectoration, and hemoptysis. It is important from the public health and economic point of view as it affects the growth of the country, which is majorly attributed to the restriction in the movement of the people and the cost associated with the control and prevention of the disease. Since there is no specific therapeutic intervention nor a vaccine available against the virus, supportive management and treatment with non-specific therapeutic agents (repurposed drugs) may provide relief to the patients. Some preventive strategies of the disease include blocking the routes of transmission of the infections, disinfection of instruments used during medical case handling, using personal protective equipment, proper and early diagnosis of the disease, avoiding contact with the sick patients, and quarantine of the infected/exposed people.","Pal, Mahendra; Berhanu, Gemechu; Desalegn, Chaltu; Kandi, Venkataramana",Cureus,417,10

IL-10-deficiency also enhances liver injury without improving viral clearance from this site. Collectively, the results indicate that IL-10-producing cells in the liver provide protection from collateral injury by modulating the inflammatory response associated with MCMV infection.","Gaddi, Pamela J.; Crane, Meredith J.; Kamanaka, Masahito; Flavell, Richard A.; Yap, George S.; Salazar-Mather, Thais P.",PLoS One,417,15

We estimate variation in deaths arising due to a simulated random infection of 10% of the population living in private households and subsequent within-household transmission of the virus. The age-structures of European and North American countries increase their vulnerability to covid-related deaths in general. The co-residence patterns of elderly persons in Africa and parts of Asia increase these countries' vulnerability to deaths induced by within-household transmission of covid-19. Southern European countries, which have aged populations and relatively high levels of intergenerational co-residence are, all else equal, the most vulnerable to outbreaks of covid-19. In a second step, we estimate to what extent avoiding primary infections for specific age-groups would prevent subsequent deaths due to within-household transmission of the virus. Preventing primary infections among the elderly is the most effective in countries with small households and little intergenerational co-residence such as France, whereas confining younger age groups can have a greater impact in countries with large and inter-generational households such as Bangladesh.","Esteve, A.; Permanyer, I.; Boertien, D.; Vaupel, J.

However, there is no approved preventive or therapeutic measure against EV-D68, HRV, or other enteroviruses. In this study, we evaluated the antiviral activity of series of dipeptidyl compounds against EV-D68 and HRV strains, and demonstrated that several peptidyl aldehyde and α-ketoamide peptidyl compounds are potent inhibitors of EV-D68 and HRV strains with high in-vitro therapeutic indices (>1000). One of the α-ketoamide compounds is shown to have favorable pharmacokinetics profiles, including a favorable oral bioavailability in rats.

METHODS: Clinical specimens from both upper and lower respiratory tract sources were validated, including nasopharyngeal aspirates, nasopharyngeal swabs, anterior nares swabs, and tracheal aspirates (n = 333 clinical samples). Testing volumes and laboratory turnaround times were then compared before and after implementation to investigate effects of the workflow changes. RESULTS: Compared to magnetic-bead extraction platforms, extraction-free real-time PCR demonstrated ≥95% positive agreement and ≥97% negative agreement across all tested sources. Implementation of this workflow reduced laboratory turnaround time from an average of 8.8 (+/−5.5) h to 3.6 (+/−1.3) h despite increasing testing volumes (from 1515 to 4884 tests per week over the reported period of testing). CONCLUSIONS: The extraction-free workflow reduced extraction reagent cost for SARS-CoV-2 testing by 97%, shortened sample handling time, and significantly alleviated supply chain scarcities due to the elimination of specialized extraction reagents for routine testing.

However, reading CT films brings a lot of concentration and time for doctors. Therefore, it is necessary to develop an automatic CT image diagnosis system to assist doctors in diagnosis. Previous studies devoted to COVID-19 in the past months focused mostly on discriminating COVID-19 infected patients from healthy persons and/or bacterial pneumonia patients, and have ignored typical viral pneumonia since it is hard to collect samples for viral pneumonia that is less frequent in adults. In addition, it is much more challenging to discriminate COVID-19 from typical viral pneumonia as COVID-19 is also a kind of virus. In this study, we have collected CT images of 262, 100, 219, and 78 persons for COVID-19, bacterial pneumonia, typical viral pneumonia, and healthy controls, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this was the first study of quaternary classification to include also typical viral pneumonia. To effectively capture the subtle differences in CT images, we have constructed a new model by combining the ResNet50 backbone with SE blocks that was recently developed for fine image analysis. Our model was shown to outperform commonly used baseline models, achieving an overall accuracy of 0.94 with AUC of 0.96, recall of 0.94, precision of 0.95, and F1-score of 0.94.

Corticosteroids have been widely used in the treatment of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and the pathological findings seen in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection are very similar to those observed in severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infection. However, the long-term use of corticosteroids (especially at high doses) is associated with potentially serious adverse events, particularly steroid-induced avascular necrosis of the femoral head (SANFH). In today’s global outbreak, whether corticosteroid therapy should be used, the dosage and duration of treatment, and ways for the prevention, early detection, and timely intervention of SANFH are some important issues that need to be addressed. This review aims to provide a reference for health care providers in COVID-19 endemic countries and regions. ARTICLE FOCUS: Hormones are a double-edged sword. This review aims to provide a reference for health care providers in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) endemic countries and regions, especially with respect to the pros and cons of corticosteroid use in the treatment of patients with COVID-19. KEY MESSAGES: In today’s global outbreak, whether corticosteroid therapy should be used, the dosage and duration of treatment, and ways for the prevention, early detection, and timely intervention of SANFH are some important issues that need to be addressed. STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS: Since SARS was mainly prevalent in China at that time, many evidences in this paper came from the reports of Chinese scholars. There is a bias in the selection of data, which may ignore the differences in environment, race, living habits, medical level and so on. SANFH may be the result of multiple factors. Whether the virus itself is an independent risk factor for SANFH has not been confirmed. In this paper, through literature retrieval, some reference opinions on glucocorticoid usage, diagnosis and treatment of SANFH are given. However, due to the lack of large-scale research data support, it can not be used as the gold standard for the above problems.","Zhang, Shenqi; Wang, Chengbin; Shi, Lei; Xue, Qingyun",Drug Des Devel Ther,417,24

Within the United States, metropolitan areas that were hit earliest with the pandemic and reacted with scientifically based health policy were able to contain the virus by late spring. For other areas that kept businesses open, the first wave in the United States hit in mid-summer. As the weather turns colder, universities resume classes, and people tire of lockdowns, a second wave is ascending in both metropolitan and rural areas. It becomes more obvious that additional SARS-CoV-2 surveillance is needed at the local level to track recent shifts in the pandemic, rates of increase, and persistence. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study is to provide advanced surveillance metrics for COVID-19 transmission that account for speed, acceleration, jerk and persistence, and weekly shifts, to better understand and manage risk in metropolitan areas. Existing surveillance measures coupled with our dynamic metrics of transmission will inform health policy to control the COVID-19 pandemic until, and after, an effective vaccine is developed. Here, we provide values for novel indicators to measure COVID-19 transmission at the metropolitan area level. METHODS: Using a longitudinal trend analysis study design, we extracted 260 days of COVID-19 data from public health registries. We used an empirical difference equation to measure the daily number of cases in the 25 largest US metropolitan areas as a function of the prior number of cases and weekly shift variables based on a dynamic panel data model that was estimated using the generalized method of moments approach by implementing the Arellano-Bond estimator in R. RESULTS: Minneapolis and Chicago have the greatest average number of daily new positive results per standardized 100,000 population (which we refer to as speed). Extreme behavior in Minneapolis showed an increase in speed from 17 to 30 (67%) in 1 week. The jerk and acceleration calculated for these areas also showed extreme behavior. The dynamic panel data model shows that Minneapolis, Chicago, and Detroit have the largest persistence effects, meaning that new cases pertaining to a specific week are statistically attributable to new cases from the prior week. CONCLUSIONS: Three of the metropolitan areas with historically early and harsh winters have the highest persistence effects out of the top 25 most populous metropolitan areas in the United States at the beginning of their cold weather season. With these persistence effects, and with indoor activities becoming more popular as the weather gets colder, stringent COVID-19 regulations will be more important than ever to flatten the second wave of the pandemic. As colder weather grips more of the nation, southern metropolitan areas may also see large spikes in the number of cases.","Oehmke, Theresa B; Post, Lori A; Moss, Charles B; Issa, Tariq Z; Boctor, Michael J; Welch, Sarah B; Oehmke, James F",J Med Internet Res,417,10

Epidemiological and clinical data of HCoVs infectious in the Brazilian population are scarce and restricted to one or two groups of patients. Our study aimed to investigate retrospectively the presence of HCoVs in different populations of São Paulo presenting acute respiratory tract infections (ARIs) during the years of 2001–2010. A pancoronavirus RT-PCR was performed in this study. Coronaviruses were detected in 126 (11.5%) of 1,087 specimens. Peaks detection frequency was observed during 2002–2004 and 2008–2009, with the highest detection in 2008. The prevalence of HCoVs was higher among children with heart diseases (24.6%), patients under stem cell transplantation program (24.3%) and renal transplanted patients (20.2%). Coryza, cough and fever were the most common symptoms at presentation of positive cases and wheezing, a lower respiratory tract infection symptom was reported by 12% of the total, and 27% of high at-risk patients.

Univariate analysis showed that overweight, obesity class I and morbid obesity were associated with ICU admittance. Patients with diabetes were more likely to be admitted to the ICU. Two models for multivariate regression analysis assessed either BMI or diabetes on ICU outcomes. In the BMI model, class I and morbid obesities were associated with ICU admittance. In the diabetes model, diabetes was associated with increased ICU admittance, whereas hypertension had a protective effect on ICU admittance.

The lungs are often damaged due to the presence of Sars-CoV-2 binding receptor ACE2 on epithelial alveolar cells. Severity of infection varies from complete absence of symptomatology to more aggressive symptoms, characterized by sudden acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multiorgan failure, and sepsis, requiring treatment in intensive care unit (ICU). It is not still clear why the immune system is not able to efficiently suppress viral replication in a small percentage of patients. It has been documented as pathological conditions affecting the cardiovascular system, strongly associated to atherosclerotic progression, such as heart failure (HF), coronary heart disease (CHD), hypertension (HTN) and diabetes mellitus (DM), could serve as predictive factors for severity and susceptibility during Sars-CoV-2 infection. Atherosclerotic progression, as a chronic inflammation process, is characterized by immune system dysregulation leading to pro-inflammatory patterns, including interleukin 6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), and IL-1β. Reviewing immune system and inflammation profiles in atherosclerosis and laboratory results reported in severe COVID-19 infections, we hypothesized a pathogenetic correlation. Atherosclerosis may be an ideal pathogenetic substrate for high viral replication ability, leading to adverse outcomes, as reported in patients with cardiovascular factors. The level of atherosclerotic progression may affect a different degree of severe infection; in a vicious circle, feeding itself, Sars-CoV-2 may exacerbate atherosclerotic evolution due to excessive and aberrant plasmatic concentration of cytokines.","Vinciguerra, Mattia; Romiti, Silvia; Fattouch, Khalil; De Bellis, Antonio; Greco, Ernesto",J Clin Med,417,11

This chapter presents the reverse genetics of the largest RNA viruses. Just as all other positive-sense RNA viruses (retroviruses excluded), coronavirus genomic RNA is infectious when transfected into the cells of a permissive host. Therefore, in principle, the most direct way to perform reverse genetics on a coronavirus ought to involve the construction of a full-length genomic complementary DNA (cDNA) clone from which infectious RNA could be transcribed in vitro. The method––targeted recombination––is less direct and more laborious, and so far it has been applied exclusively to site-directed mutagenesis of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV). Thus, at least for structural gene mutations that are not expected to be severely deleterious, targeted recombination may remain the less complicated alternative for the creation of MHV mutants. The chapter discusses targeted RNA recombination, such as development of system, genetic analysis of coronavirus structural proteins, genetic analysis of coronavirus RNA synthesis, and limitations of targeted recombination.","Masters, Paul S.",Advances in Virus Research,417,16

Crowding, pollution, noise, inadequate lighting, lack of access to green spaces, and other environmental factors associated with slums can exacerbate mental health disorders, including depression, anxiety, violence, and other forms of social dysfunction. METHOD: : The studies were identified using large-sized newspapers with international circulation. RESULTS: : Experts say that people who sleep in shelters or on the streets already have lower life expectancy, suffer from addiction, and have underlying health conditions that put them at greater risk should they develop the virus. There are just so many competing and unmet needs, which makes it much harder for homeless to contend with all of this. If exposed, people experiencing homelessness might be more susceptible to illness or death due to the prevalence of underlying physical and mental medical conditions and a lack of reliable and affordable health care. Nevertheless, without an urgent solution, people experiencing homelessness will remain in limbo. CONCLUSIONS: : Many people living on the streets already have a diminished health condition, higher rates of chronic illnesses or compromised immune systems, all of which are risk factors for developing a more serious manifestation of the coronavirus infection. Those suffering from mental illness may have difficulty in recognizing and responding to the threat of infection. Homeless people have less access to health care providers who could otherwise order diagnostic testing and, if confirmed, isolate them from others in coordination with local health departments.","Lima, Nádia Nara Rolim; de Souza, Ricardo Inácio; Feitosa, Pedro Walisson Gomes; Moreira, Jorge Lucas de Sousa; da Silva, Claudio Gleidiston Lima; Neto, Modesto Leite Rolim",Psychiatry Res,417,10

In fall 2020, national guidance for reopening omitted testing or screening recommendations. We report the experience of 2 large independent K‐12 schools (School‐A and School‐B) that implemented an array of SARS‐CoV‐2 mitigation strategies that included periodic universal testing. METHODS: SARS‐CoV‐2 was identified through periodic universal PCR testing, self‐reporting of tests conducted outside school, and contact tracing. Schools implemented behavioral and structural mitigation measures, including mandatory masks, classroom disinfecting, and social distancing. RESULTS: Over the fall semester, School‐A identified 112 cases in 2320 students and staff; School‐B identified 25 cases (2.0%) in 1400 students and staff. Most cases were asymptomatic and none required hospitalization. Of 69 traceable introductions, 63 (91%) were not associated with school‐based transmission, 59 cases (54%) occurred in the 2 weeks post‐thanksgiving. In 6/7 clusters, clear noncompliance with mitigation protocols was found. The largest outbreak had 28 identified cases and was traced to an off‐campus party. There was no transmission from students to staff. CONCLUSIONS: Although school‐age children can contract and transmit SARS‐CoV‐2, rates of COVID‐19 infection related to in‐person education were significantly lower than those in the surrounding community. However, social activities among students outside of school undermined those measures and should be discouraged, perhaps with behavioral contracts, to ensure the safety of school communities. In addition, introduction risks were highest following extended school breaks. These risks may be mitigated with voluntary quarantines and surveillance testing prior to reopening.","Gillespie, Darria L.; Meyers, Lauren A.; Lachmann, Michael; Redd, Stephen C.; Zenilman, Jonathan M.",J Sch Health,417,16

We hypothesised that preoperative intravenous iron and tranexamic acid (TXA) may reduce the transfusion rate in these patients. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The HiFIT study is a multicentre, 2×2 factorial, randomised, double-blinded, controlled trial evaluating the effect of iron isomaltoside (IIM) (20 mg/kg) vs placebo and of TXA (intravenously at inclusion and topically during surgery) versus placebo on transfusion rate during hospitalisation, in patients undergoing emergency surgery for HF and having a preoperative haemoglobin between 95 and 130 g/L. 780 patients are expected. The primary endpoint is the proportion of patients receiving an allogenic blood transfusion of packed red blood cells from the day of surgery until hospital discharge (or until D30 if patient is still hospitalised). Enrolment started on March 2017 in 11 French hospitals. The study was stopped between July 2017 and August 2018 (because of investigation of serious AEs with IIM in Spain) and slowed down since March 2020 (COVID-19 crisis). The expected date of final follow-up is May 2022. Analyses of the intent-to-treat and per-protocol populations are planned. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The HiFIT trial protocol has been approved by the Ethics Committee of Comité de Protection des Personnes Ouest II and the French authorities (ANSM). It will be carried out according to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and the Good Clinical Practice guidelines. The results will be disseminated through presentation at scientific conferences and publication in peer-reviewed journals. The HiFIT trial will be the largest study evaluating iron and TXA in patients with HF.

At the time, risk of cross-border spread into South Sudan was very high. Thus, the South Sudan Ministry of Health scaled up Ebola preparedness activities in August 2018, including implementation of a 24-h, toll-free Ebola virus disease (EVD) hotline. The primary purpose was the hotline was to receive EVD alerts and the secondary goal was to provide evidence-based EVD messages to the public. METHODS: To assess whether the hotline augmented Ebola preparedness activities in a protracted humanitarian emergency context, we reviewed 22 weeks of call logs from January to June 2019. Counts and percentages were calculated for all available data. RESULTS: The hotline received 2114 calls during the analysis period, and an additional 1835 missed calls were documented. Callers used the hotline throughout 24-h of the day and were most often men and individuals living in Jubek state, where the national capital is located. The leading reasons for calling were to learn more about EVD (68%) or to report clinical signs or symptoms (16%). Common EVD-related questions included EVD signs and symptoms, transmission, and prevention. Only one call was documented as an EVD alert, and there was no documentation of reported symptoms or whether the person met the EVD case definition. CONCLUSIONS: Basic surveillance information was not collected from callers. To trigger effective outbreak investigation from hotline calls, the hotline should capture who is reporting and from where, symptoms and travel history, and whether this information should be further investigated. Electronic data capture will enhance data quality and availability of information for review. Additionally, the magnitude of missed calls presents a major challenge. When calls are answered, there is potential to provide health communication, so risk communication needs should be considered. However, prior to hotline implementation, governments should critically assess whether their hotline would yield actionable data and if other data sources for surveillance or community concerns are available.","Lopez, Velma K.; Shetty, Sharmila; Kouch, Angelo Thon; Khol, Matthew Tut; Lako, Richard; Bili, Alexandre; Ayuen, Anyang David; Jukudu, Agnes; Kug, Ajak Ater; Mayen, Atem David; Nyawel, Emmanuel; Berta, Kibebu; Olu, Olushayo; Clarke, Kevin; Bunga, Sudhir",Confl Health,417,16

The initial control of SARS-CoV-2 epidemics relied on non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as social distancing, teleworking, mouth masks and contact tracing. However, as pre-symptomatic transmission remains an important driver of the epidemic, contact tracing efforts struggle to fully control SARS-CoV-2 epidemics. Therefore, in this work, we investigate to what extent the use of universal testing, i.e., an approach in which we screen the entire population, can be utilized to mitigate this epidemic. To this end, we rely on PCR test pooling of individuals that belong to the same households, to allow for a universal testing procedure that is feasible with the limited testing capacity. We evaluate two isolation strategies: on the one hand pool isolation, where we isolate all individuals that belong to a positive PCR test pool, and on the other hand individual isolation, where we determine which of the individuals that belong to the positive PCR pool are positive, through an additional testing step. We evaluate this universal testing approach in the STRIDE individual-based epidemiological model in the context of the Belgian COVID-19 epidemic. As the organisation of universal testing will be challenging, we discuss the different aspects related to sample extraction and PCR testing, to demonstrate the feasibility of universal testing when a decentralized testing approach is used. We show through simulation, that weekly universal testing is able to control the epidemic, even when many of the contact reductions are relieved. Finally, our model shows that the use of universal testing in combination with stringent contact reductions could be considered as a strategy to eradicate the virus.","Libin, Pieter J.

One reason could be the lack of systematic utilization of modern technologies, such as eHealth, in their operations. To address this issue, researchers’ efforts have led to the emergence of the disaster eHealth (DEH) field. DEH’s main objective is to systematically integrate eHealth technologies for health care purposes within the disaster management cycle (DMC). OBJECTIVE: This study aims to identify, map, and define the scope of DEH as a new area of research at the intersection of disaster management, emergency medicine, and eHealth. METHODS: An extensive scoping review using published materials was carried out in the areas of disaster management, disaster medicine, and eHealth to identify the scope of DEH. This review procedure was iterative and conducted in multiple scientific databases in 2 rounds, one using controlled indexed terms and the other using similar uncontrolled terms. In both rounds, the publications ranged from 1990 to 2016, and all the appropriate research studies discovered were considered, regardless of their research design, methodology, and quality. Information extracted from both rounds was thematically analyzed to define the DEH scope, and the results were evaluated by the field experts through a Delphi method. RESULTS: In both rounds of the research, searching for eHealth applications within DMC yielded 404 relevant studies that showed eHealth applications in different disaster types and disaster phases. These applications varied with respect to the eHealth technology types, functions, services, and stakeholders. The results led to the identification of the scope of DEH, including eHealth technologies and their applications, services, and future developments that are applicable to disasters as well as to related stakeholders. Reference to the elements of the DEH scope indicates what, when, and how current eHealth technologies can be used in the DMC. CONCLUSIONS: Comprehensive data gathering from multiple databases offered a grounded method to define the DEH scope. This scope comprises concepts related to DEH and the boundaries that define it. The scope identifies the eHealth technologies relevant to DEH and the functions and services that can be provided by these technologies. In addition, the scope tells us which groups can use the provided services and functions and in which disaster types or phases. DEH approaches could potentially improve the response to health care demands before, during, and after disasters. DEH takes advantage of eHealth technologies to facilitate DMC tasks and activities, enhance their efficiency and effectiveness, and enhance health care delivery and provide more quality health care services to the wider population regardless of their geographical location or even disaster types and phases.","Madanian, Samaneh; Norris, Tony; Parry, Dave",J Med Internet Res,417,26

OBJECTIVE: To review a selective for a course in diagnostic pathology geared toward undergraduate medical students, including its design, technical implementation, instructor and student evaluations, and suggestions for options for further adjusting and optimizing the selective. DESIGN: Whole slide images (WSI) were anonymized and students were given remote access to university computers, which were prepared with two freely available WSI viewers. Each topic was taught in a four-part module: Self-assigned reading, lecture via Zoom, quiz based on digital slide sets, and a frontal review of the slides via Zoom. Fifty-nine students participated in the selective. Following the course, students completed an anonymous questionnaire. RESULTS: Of the 59 participants, 42% (n = 25) responded. None of the respondents had any previous instruction in diagnostic pathology. Overall, the course was rated very favorably: 68% (n = 17) gave at least 3 points on a 4-point scale on questions relating to course interest, improvement in understanding of the covered diseases, and how strongly they would recommend a student take this course if given an option. The most significant disadvantage of the class, as reported by 80% (n = 20) were technical challenges in accessing the slides. CONCLUSION: We believe the course was a success and can be a model for future virtual pathology electives. Great effort should be done to provide technical support to the students. The selective demonstrated value for students and provided much-needed exposure to diagnostic pathology in clinical practice.","Samueli, Benzion; Sror, Neta; Jotkowitz, Alan; Taragin, Benjamin",Ann Diagn Pathol,417,1

The method may be executed using a LC-TOF mass spectrometer, requires no specialized knowledge of glycan analysis and exploits the differential resolving power of reverse phase HPLC. While this separation technique resolves peptides with high efficiency, glycans are resolved poorly, if at all. Consequently, glycopeptides consisting of the same peptide bearing different glycan structures will all possess very similar retention times and co-elute. Rather than a disadvantage, we show that shared retention time can be used to map multiple glycan species to the same peptide and location. In combination with MSMS and pseudo MS3, we have constructed a detailed mass-retention time database for Spike glycopeptides. This database allows any accurate mass LC-MS laboratory to reliably identify and quantify Spike glycopeptides from a single overnight elastase digest in less than 90 minutes.","Chalk, Rod; Greenland, William E.

It fails to mention the 120-year history of successful low-dose treatments of a wide variety of serious diseases, including cancers. The commentary ignores published evidence of a threshold at 1.1 Gy for radiogenic leukemia and a dose-rate threshold at about 0.6 Gy per year for lifespan shortening. LNT came from politicized science, replete with scientific misconduct and conflict of interest. Its acceptance created a false cancer scare that was likely intended to stop atomic bomb testing, but it has severely damaged human welfare. Many vitally important low-dose therapies were discarded when the radiation scare was disseminated in 1956. The rapid growth of nuclear energy ended with the media-inflamed public panic after the Three Mile Island accident in 1979. Extreme implementation of the precautionary principle made it uneconomic.

METHODS: We traced the antibody responses and neutralizing activity against MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in peripheral blood samples collected from 70 recovered MERS patients for five years after the 2015 MERS outbreak in South Korea. We also measured the half-life of neutralizing antibody titers in the longitudinal specimens. RESULTS: The seropositivity rate persisted for up to four years (50.7–56.1%), especially in MERS patients who suffered from severe pneumonia, and then decreased (35.9%) in the fifth year. Although the spike-specific antibody responses decreased gradually, the neutralizing antibody titers decreased more rapidly (half-life: 20 months) in 19 participants without showing negative seroconversion during the study period. Only five (26.3%) participants had neutralizing antibody titers greater than 1/1,000 of PRNT(50), and a high neutralizing antibody titer over 1/5,000 was not detected in the participants at five years after infection.

Cholera alone is estimated to cause 95,000 deaths per year, most of which occur in endemic settings with inadequate water access. Whilst a global strategy to eliminate cholera by 2030 calls for investment in improved drinking water services, there is limited rigorous evidence for the impact of improved water supply on endemic cholera transmission in low-income urban settings. Our protocol is designed to deliver a pragmatic health impact evaluation of a large-scale water supply intervention in Uvira (Democratic Republic of the Congo), a cholera transmission hotspot. METHODS/DESIGN: A stepped-wedge cluster randomised trial (SW-CRT) was designed to evaluate the impact of a large-scale drinking water supply intervention on cholera incidence among the 280,000 inhabitants of Uvira. The city was divided into 16 clusters, where new community and household taps will be installed following a randomised sequence over a transition period of up to 8 weeks in each cluster. The primary trial outcomes are the monthly incidence of “confirmed” cholera cases (patients testing positive by rapid detection kit) and of “suspected” cholera cases (patients admitted to the cholera treatment centre). Concurrent process and economic evaluations will provide further information on the context, costs, and efficiency of the intervention. DISCUSSION: In this protocol, we describe a pragmatic approach to conducting rigorous research to assess the impacts of a complex water supply intervention on severe diarrhoeal disease and cholera in an unstable, low-resource setting representative of cholera-affected areas. In particular, we discuss a series of pre-identified risks and linked mitigation strategies as well as the value of combining different data collection methods and preparation of multiple analysis scenarios to account for possible deviations from the protocol. The study described here has the potential to provide robust evidence to support more effective cholera control in challenging, high-burden settings.

Macrodomains, which are functionally promiscuous, have been studied intensively for the past decade due to their importance in the regulation of cellular responses to DNA damage, chromatin remodeling, transcription and tumorigenesis. Recent structural, phylogenetic and biological analyses, however, suggest the need for some reconsideration of the evolutionary advantage of concentrating such a plethora of diverse functions into the macrodomain and of how macrodomains could perform so many functions.

OBJECTIVE Examine the prevailing epidemiological panorama in mid-March 2021 in 16 countries in Latin America and the performance, over time, in the two countries with the best responses to their respective epidemics. METHODS Using morbidity and mortality data, we compared the relative performance of each country under review and identified the two countries with the most successful responses to the pandemic. We used five indicators to analyze the course of each country's performance during the pandemic throughout 2020: prevalence of active cases per million population; cumulative incidence rate in 7 days per 100,000 population; positivity rate over a 7-day period; percentage of recovered patients and crude mortality rate per 1,000,000 population.

Evidence of the social patterning of change,17.637808,3.4186616,2021-01-05,"Cynicism and turnover intentions are highlighted as being detrimental to organisations’ sustainability. Drawing on the social exchange theory, this paper aims to examine the effect of organisational cynicism on turnover intention and the mediating role of organisational support on this relationship. A survey was conducted with 289 employees and managers. Data were gathered from 54 technology firms from Istanbul, Turkey, and analysed through structural equation modelling using AMOS. The findings suggest that the cognitive and affective dimensions of cynicism are significant predictors of turnover intention, and further that organisational support mediates the relationship between the cognitive and affective dimensions of cynicism and turnover intention. This research is novel in that it deepens our understanding of how detrimental workplace perceptions might affect employees’ intentions to leave their organisations and to what extent organisational support mediates this relationship in technology firms in Istanbul, Turkey. To our knowledge, no study has investigated these three variables together, as in the proposed model.","Cicek, Berat; Turkmenoglu, Mehmet Ali; Ozbilgin, Mustafa",Front Psychol,417,16

We employed a Quadratic Unbounded Binary Optimization (QUBO) model, to search for compounds similar to Remdesivir (RDV), the only antiviral against SARS-CoV-2 currently approved for human use, using a quantum-inspired device. We modelled RDV and compounds present in the DrugBank database as graphs, established the optimal parameters in our algorithm and resolved the Maximum Weighted Independent Set problem within the conflict graph generated. We also employed a traditional Tanimoto fingerprint model. The two methods yielded different lists of compounds, with some overlap. While GS-6620 was the top compound predicted by both models, the QUBO model predicted BMS-986094 as second best. The Tanimoto model predicted different forms of cobalamin, also known as vitamin B12. We then determined the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) values in cell culture models of SARS-CoV-2 infection and assessed cytotoxicity. Lastly, we demonstrated efficacy against several variants including SARS-CoV-2 Strain England 2 (England 02/2020/407073), B.1.1.7 (Alpha), B.1.351 (Beta) and B.1.617.2 (Delta). Our data reveal that BMS-986094 and different forms of vitamin B12 are effective at inhibiting replication of all these variants of SARS-CoV-2. While BMS-986094 can cause secondary effects in humans as established by phase II trials, these findings suggest that vitamin B12 deserves consideration as a SARS-CoV-2 antiviral, particularly given its extended use and lack of toxicity in humans, and its availability and affordability. Our screening method can be employed in future searches for novel pharmacologic inhibitors, thus providing an approach for accelerating drug deployment.","Jimenez-Guardeño, Jose M.; Ortega-Prieto, Ana Maria; Moreno, Borja Menendez; Maguire, Thomas J.A.; Richardson, Adam; Diaz-Hernandez, Juan Ignacio; Diez Perez, Javier; Zuckerman, Mark; Playa, Albert Mercadal; Deline, Carlos Cordero; Malim, Michael H.; Martinez-Nunez, Rocio T",bioRxiv,417,32

When the global focus has mostly been on testing, finding a cure and preventing transmission; people are going through a myriad of psychological problems in adjusting to the current lifestyles and fear of the disease. Since there is a severe dearth of researches on this issue, we decided to conduct an online survey to evaluate its psychological impact. METHODS: From 26(th) to 29(th) March an online survey (FEEL-COVID) was conducted using principles of snowballing, and by invitation through text messages to participate. The survey collected data on socio-demographic and clinical variables related to COVID-19 (based on the current knowledge); along with measuring psychological impact with the help of Impact of Event–revised (IES-R) scale. RESULTS: There were a total of 1106 responses from around 64 cities in the country. Out of these 453 responses had at least one item missing; and were excluded from the analysis. The mean age of the respondents was around 41 years with a male female ratio of 3:1 and around 22% respondents were health care professionals. Overall approximately one third of respondents had significant psychological impact (IES-R score > 24). Higher psychological impact was predicted with younger age, female gender and comorbid physical illness. Presence of physical symptoms and contact history predicted higher psychological impact, but did not reach statistical significance. CONCLUSION: During the initial stages of COVID-19 in India, almost one-third respondents had a significant psychological impact. This indicates a need for more systematic and longitudinal assessment of psychological needs of the population, which can help the government in formulating holistic interventions for affected individuals.","Varshney, Mohit; Parel, Jithin Thomas; Raizada, Neeraj; Sarin, Shiv Kumar",PLoS One,417,20

METHODS: PEDSAME study: first cross-sectional section (beginning of the school year) and retrospective data (lockdown), carried out through the network of Primary Care pediatricians in the Catalan population between 5 and 14 years (included) from 09/14/2020 to 10/30/2020 in a random sample. Data were collected with an online survey through the RedCap platform at the beginning of the school year. The main variable was the result of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire answered by parents to assess the risk of psychopathology, in addition to other related variable. RESULTS: The results obtained at the beginning of the school year show that 9.8% of the patients were probable cases of psychopathology. The most affected group were those between 5 and 8 years. The perception of the children's level of concern for their health and that of their family was a risk factor for presenting psychopathology, while the good family environment was a protective factor. Emotional and behavioral symptoms, sleep disorders and problematic use of screens were detected more frequently during confinement than at the beginning of the school year. CONCLUSIONS: Confinement and the absence of schooling for 6 months had a negative impact on the mental health of the child–adolescent population who showed worse indicators than the previous year.","Gatell-Carbó, Anna; Alcover-Bloch, Elena; Balaguer-Martínez, Josep Vicent; Pérez-Porcuna, Tomás; Esteller-Carceller, María; Álvarez-Garcia, Patrícia; Fortea-Gimeno, Emilio",An Pediatr (Barc),417,22

However, its compounds, especially the oxyanions, exert numerous negative effects on both prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms. Recent evidence suggests that increasing environmental pollution with tellurium has a causal link to autoimmune, neurodegenerative and oncological diseases. In this review, we provide an overview about the current knowledge on the mechanisms of tellurium compounds’ toxicity in bacteria and humans and we summarise the various ways organisms cope and detoxify these compounds. Over the last decades, several gene clusters conferring resistance to tellurium compounds have been identified in a variety of bacterial species and strains. These genetic determinants exhibit great genetic and functional diversity. Besides the existence of specific resistance mechanisms, tellurium and its toxic compounds interact with molecular systems, mediating general detoxification and mitigation of oxidative stress. We also discuss the similarity of tellurium and selenium biochemistry and the impact of their compounds on humans.","Vávrová, Silvia; Struhárňanská, Eva; Turňa, Ján; Stuchlík, Stanislav",Int J Mol Sci,417,16

To genotype/subtype the CCoV strains and assess the occurrence of single or multiple CCoV infections, RT-PCR of the S gene was performed, and 25/30 CCoV-positive strains amplified with one or two primer pairs. For 17/25 samples, single infections were detected as follows: six CCoV-I, nine CCoV-IIa and two CCoV-IIb. Eight samples were positive for more than one genotype/subtype as follows: seven CCoV-I/IIa and one CCoV-I/IIb. Sequence analysis revealed that the CCoV-I and IIa strains shared high genetic similarity to each other and to the prototypes. The Brazilian strains of CCoV-IIb displayed an aminoacid insertion that was also described in CCoV-IIb-UCD-1 and TGEV strains.

Risk factors affecting mortality of the disease remain elusive. Diabetes and hyperglycemia are known to negatively affect a host’s antiviral immunity. We evaluated the relationship between a history of diabetes, fasting plasma glucose (FPG) levels and mortality among severely ill patients with COVID-19. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study that assessed 106 adult inpatients (aged ≥18 years) from two tertiary hospitals in Daegu, South Korea. The participants were transferred to tertiary hospitals because their medical condition required immediate intensive care. The demographic and laboratory data were compared between COVID-19 patients who survived and those who did not. RESULTS: Compared with the survivor group, age, and the proportions of diabetes, chronic lung disease and FPG were significantly higher in the deceased group. In the Cox proportional hazards regression model for survival analysis, FPG level and age were identified as significant predictors of mortality (P<0.05). The threshold values for predicting high mortality were age >68 years and FPG of 168 mg/dL, respectively. Among those without diabetes, high FPG remained a significant predictor of mortality (P<0.04). CONCLUSION: High FPG levels significantly predicted mortality in COVID-19, regardless of a known history of diabetes. These results suggest intensive monitoring should be provided to COVID-19 patients who have a high FPG level.","Chang, Min Cheol; Hwang, Jong-Moon; Jeon, Jae-Han; Kwak, Sang Gyu; Park, Donghwi; Moon, Jun Sung",Endocrinol Metab (Seoul),417,16

This resulted in extremely low patient volumes for perioperative services. Conversely, critical care was experiencing an influx of patient volume and acuity, necessitating additional nursing support. Objectives of Project Our aim was to bolster the hospital's critical care service line by pooling available nursing resources. The perioperative and critical care leadership teams further identified this initiative as an opportunity to strengthen relationships between nurses that share a common skill set. Process of Implementation Hospital command center meetings to address surge bed capacity reinforced the partnership between perioperative and critical care services. Team nursing models were reviewed collaboratively. The PACU nurse manager requested volunteers to staff critical care based on a team model. Five highly experienced PACU RNs and five newer PACU RNs without prior ICU assignments volunteered, with goals to expand knowledge, improve critical assessment skills, and help a service in need. The ten PACU nurse volunteers were assigned into five pairs, consisting of one experienced RN and one newer RN. The five teams of two were consistently matched with their partner, and worked every shift in the ICU as a pair. Statement of Successful Practice This collaborative effort between the perioperative and critical care nursing services achieved the goal of providing safe and competent care to a population in dire need during the height of the Covid-19 pandemic. This initiative also strengthened relationships between the services, thereby promoting improved communication and increased efficiency. Implications for Advancing the Practice of Perianesthesia Nursing The future implications of Covid-19 are largely unknown, and this initiative mobilized nursing resources in a systematic fashion to provide necessary specialized care.

The therapy significantly improved the patient's clinical symptoms, oxygenation status, and radiological characteristics of lung injury during hospitalization, and the patient showed good tolerance and avoided intubation. Additionally, we did not find that medical staff wearing optimal airborne personal protective equipment (PPE) were infected by the new coronavirus in our institution.

Thus, islet organoids hold great promise for modeling islet development and function, deciphering the mechanisms underlying the onset of diabetes, providing an in vitro human organ model for infection of viruses such as SARS-CoV-2, and contributing to drug screening and autologous islet transplantation. However, the currently established islet organoids are generally immature compared with native islets, and further efforts should be made to improve the heterogeneity and functionality of islet organoids, making it an authentic and informative disease model for diabetes.

Any potential course of action to manage this complex disease requires the systematic and efficient analysis of data that can delineate the underlying pathogenesis. We have developed a mathematical model of disease progression to predict the clinical outcome, utilizing a set of causal factors known to contribute to COVID-19 pathology such as age, comorbidities, and certain viral and immunological parameters. Viral load and selected indicators of a dysfunctional immune response, such as cytokines IL-6 and IFNα, which contribute to the cytokine storm and fever, parameters of inflammation d-dimer and ferritin, aberrations in lymphocyte number, lymphopenia, and neutralizing antibodies were included for the analysis. The model provides a framework to unravel the multi-factorial complexities of the immune response manifested in SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals. Further, this model can be valuable to predict clinical outcome at an individual level, and to develop strategies for allocating appropriate resources to mitigate severe cases at a population level.","Chirmule, Narendra; Nair, Pradip; Desai, Bela; Khare, Ravindra; Nerurkar, Vivek; Gaur, Amitabh",medRxiv,417,17

SETTING: 460 care home units using the same software package to collect data on residents, from 46 local authority areas in England. PARTICIPANTS: 6464 care home residents with at least one NEWS recording. EXPOSURE MEASURE: 29 656 anonymised person-level NEWS from 29 December 2019 to 20 May 2020 with component physiological measures: systolic blood pressure, respiratory rate, pulse rate, temperature and oxygen saturation. Baseline values for each measure calculated using 80th and 20th centile scores before March 2020. OUTCOME MEASURE: Cross-correlation comparison of time series with Office for National Statistics weekly reported registered deaths of care home residents where COVID-19 was the underlying cause of death, and all other deaths (excluding COVID-19) up to 10 May 2020. RESULTS: Deaths due to COVID-19 were registered from 23 March 2020 in the local authority areas represented in the study. Between 23 March 2020 and 10 May 2020, there were 5753 deaths (1532 involving COVID-19 and 4221 other causes). We observed a rise in the proportion of above-baseline NEWS beginning 16 March 2020, followed 2 weeks later by an increase in registered deaths (cross-correlation of r=0.82, p<0.05 for a 2 week lag) in corresponding local authorities. The proportion of above-baseline oxygen saturation, respiratory rate and temperature measurements also increased approximately 2 weeks before peaks in deaths. CONCLUSIONS: NEWS could contribute to COVID-19 disease surveillance in care homes during the pandemic. Oxygen saturation, respiratory rate and temperature could be prioritised as they appear to signal rise in mortality almost as well as NEWS. This study reinforces the need to collate data from care homes, to monitor and protect residents’ health. Further work using individual level outcome data is needed to evaluate the role of NEWS in the early detection of resident illness.","Stow, Daniel; Barker, Robert O; Matthews, Fiona E; Hanratty, Barbara",BMJ Open,417,24

We performed a randomized survey experiment with a representative sample of 1000 American adults in December 2020. Respondents were asked whether they would opt for vaccination under one of three incentive conditions ($1000, $1500, or $2000 financial incentive) or a no-incentive condition. We find that—without coupled financial incentives—only 58 per cent of survey respondents would elect for vaccination. A coupled financial incentive yields an 8-percentage-point increase in vaccine uptake relative to this baseline. The size of the cash transfer does not dramatically affect uptake rates. However, incentive responses differ dramatically by demographic group. Republicans were less responsive to financial incentives than the general population. For Black and Latino Americans especially, very large financial incentives may be counter-productive.","Robertson, Christopher; Scheitrum, Daniel; Schaefer, Aleks; Malone, Trey; McFadden, Brandon R; Messer, Kent D; Ferraro, Paul J",J Law Biosci,417,16

The patients were admitted between 10 January and 10 April 2020; with the first COVID-19 positive diagnosis on 6 March. A surge in admissions started around the 15 March and peaked at the beginning of April. 56.8% of the admissions were male and 43.2% were female. The average age of the 500 admissions was 69.32 years (SD 19.23 years, range 1 week to 99.21 years). By the morning of 14 April 2020, 199 patients had been discharged (Female 89, Male 111), 163 patients had died (female 61, male 102) and 131 remained as in-patients (female 66, male 71). Fewer than one in twenty deaths occurred in patients below the age of 50 years, in either gender. Mortality rose dramatically, for both genders, after the age of sixty with males being almost twice as vulnerable to dying, as females, during the 7th decade. Males older than their mid-fifties were more likely to die than leave hospital. The same applied to females beyond their mid seventies. We did not see any evidence of a poorer outcome associated with a lower decile for Index of Multiple Deprivation or convincing evidence that any Ethnic minority groups were more likely to die than the White subgroups. When compared to the equivalent medical conditions, normally treated in the early spring, COVID-19 has an increased mortality, adversely affecting more men and an older population. The mean duration from admission to discharge was 11.29 days (SD 11.50 days). For admission to death, the mean interval was 11.72 days (SD 11.05 days). 62 of the 500 admissions required ventilator support. Of this subgroup, 71% were male and 29% were female. By the morning of the 14 April, no female over the age of 60 had left the intensive care unit alive and no male over the age of 50 had left the intensive care unit alive. At this time-point, 1.2% of the 500 admitted patients had returned alive from the intensive care units, following a period of ventilator support. This figure will rise if prolonged ventilator and renal support proves effective. While only providing a snapshot of a relatively small number of patients, reviewed over a short time period, from a small geographic area, the data supports the view that the younger members of society are less vulnerable to the adverse sequelae of COVID-19 infection and that any return to normal work and social activities should be considered initially for the individuals who are less than 40-50 years of age. There is an ongoing need for analyses on larger patient cohorts using both demographic and detailed clinical data.","Field, R. E.; Afzal, I.; Dixon, J.; Patel, V. R.; Sarkar, P.; Marsh, J.

Although females seem to be less affected than females, hyperandrogenic (HA) phenotype, like polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), idiopathic hirsutism, congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) female androgenetic alopecia (AGA), or idiopathic HA may be at higher risk due to its inherent enhanced androgenic activity. The present study aimed to evaluate the effects of any early pharmacological approach to females diagnosed with COVID-19 before seven days of symptoms, as well as investigate whether HA is an additional risk factor in this population. Materials and methods: Females with symptoms for less than seven days confirmed for COVID-19 through positive real-time polymerase chain reaction (rtPCR-SARS-CoV-2) were classified and divided as non-HA, HA, and HA using spironolactone (HA-spiro) groups. Patients were questioned for baseline characteristics, 23 different diseases, 44 drug classes and vaccines, 28 different symptoms, and eight different parameters to measure COVID-19 related clinical outcomes. Treatment was then provided, including azithromycin 500mg/day for five days in all cases, associated with hydroxychloroquine 400mg/day for five days, nitazoxanide 500mg twice a day for six days, or ivermectin 0.2mg/kg/day por three days, and optionally spironolactone 100mg twice a day until cure. Patients were assessed for COVID-19 clinical course, clinical and viral duration, and disease progression. Results: In total, 270 females were enrolled, including 195, 67, and eight in non-HA, HA, and HA-spiro groups, respectively. Prevailing symptoms were anosmia (71.1%), ageusia (67.0%), headache (48.1%), myalgia (37.4%), dry cough (36.3%), nasal congestion or rhinorrhea (34.1%), fatigue (33.3%), weakness (29.5%), hyporexia (27.8%), thoracic pain (24.8%), diarrhea (24.1%) and dizziness (21.5%). Earliest symptoms (days) were dizziness (1.0 +- 0.2 day), abdominal pain (1.1 +- 0.3); conjunctival hyperemia (1.1 +- 0.5), nasal congestion or rhinorrhea (1.2 +- 0.5), headache (1.2 +- 0.5), dry cough (1.2 +- 61617; 0.5), myalgia (1.2 +- 0.4), nauseas (1.3 +- 0.5) and weakness (1.3 +- 0.5). Time-to-treat, positive rtPCR, and duration of symptoms with and without anosmia and ageusia were significantly lower in HA-spiro than non-HA, HA, and overall non-users. Time-to-treat was similar while all duration of symptoms and positive rtPCR-SARS-CoV-2 were significantly shorter in non-HA than HA. Spironolactone users were more likely to be asymptomatic than non-users during COVID-19. Fewer non-HA than HA females were affected by anosmia, ageusia, dry cough, fatigue, weakness and hyporexia. Ageusia, weakness and myalgia lasted shorter in non-HA than HA. None of the patients needed hospitalization or any other COVID-19 complication. Conclusions: A sensitive, early detection of COVID-19 followed by a pharmaceutical approach with different drug combinations yielded irrefutable differences compared to sex-, age-, body mass index (BMI)-, and disease-matched non-treated controls in terms of clinical outcomes, ethically disallowing placebo-control randomized clinical trials in the early stage of COVID-19 due to the marked improvements. HA females presented more severe and prolonged clinical manifestations, although none progressed to worse outcomes. Spironolactone mitigated the additional risks due to HA.","Cadegiani, F.

Applying Poisson Pseudo Maximum Likelihood (PPML) and quantile regressions to panel data and country‐specific socioeconomic background data from 53 African countries, the study finds that enhancing capacity for early testing helps for timeous uncovering of cases, early isolation and contact tracing for effective control of the spread. Other factors such as managing of international movements through reduction of international exposure and ensuring better sanitation and hygiene were found to be relevant in diminishing COVID‐19 spread, whereas alcohol consumption and population density heighten the spread. The work also highlights that stringent measures will be counter‐productive unless they are coupled with measures to create and preserve livelihoods, together with humanitarian relief assistance to the poorest segments of the population. The results are robust to alternative techniques. As policy recommendations, we implore African governments to the promotion of sustainable livelihoods and social safety nets as measures to accompany stringent lockdowns; and good sanitation programmes to become a lifestyle of citizens. Careful attention should be paid to the socioeconomic trade‐off in respect of international travel restrictions given the high dependence of most African economies on tourism.","Ngepah, Nicholas",Afr Dev Rev,417,1

As at today the disease has evolved into a serious global emergency leading to its declaration as a pandemic recently. Body On the African continent, Nigeria is just experiencing the direct effects of this pandemic having recorded her index case in February, 2020 with an increasing number of cases by the day and current case fatality ratio of 0.03 as at 13 April, 2020. Although the recorded cases may albeit seem low, it has been forecasted that Africa will have a fair share of the worst effects of this disease by the end of the pandemic. Generally, African countries have fragile health systems and this remains a source of concern especially in the event of increased outbreaks. Nigeria's current national health systems cannot effectively respond to the growing needs of already infected patients requiring admission into Intensive care units (ICUs) for Acute Respiratory Diseases (ARDs) and SARS COV-2 pnuemonia. This has grim implications for Nigeria especially as increased cases that may require critical care looms. The provision of quarantine or isolation facilities can also be a challenge in Africa and availability of rapid diagnostic kits for fast and reliable testing and diagnosis of the disease. Conclusion There is an urgent need to put in perspective the realities peculiar to Nigeria, and explore available collective measures and interventions to address the Coronavirus pandemic.","Ohia, Chinenyenwa; Bakarey, Adeleye S.; Ahmad, Tauseef",Int J Infect Dis,417,16

In the current study, we sought to provide, in a representative sample of UK residents during the third COVID‐19 lockdown in February 2021, further evidence for the validation of the COVID‐19 anxiety syndrome construct. We did this by evaluating the COVID‐19 anxiety syndrome against measures of personality, health anxiety and COVID‐19 anxiety in predicting levels of generalized anxiety and depression and by examining whether increased health anxiety and COVID‐19 psychological distress (COVID‐19 anxiety and COVID‐19 anxiety syndrome) scores were associated with increased attentional bias to COVID‐19‐related stimuli. A series of correlation analyses revealed that neuroticism, health anxiety, COVID‐19 anxiety and COVID‐19 anxiety syndrome scores were positively and significantly correlated with generalized anxiety and depression scores and that the perseveration component of the COVID‐19 anxiety syndrome predicted generalized anxiety and depression scores independently of age, gender, conscientiousness, openness, health anxiety and COVID‐19 anxiety. Furthermore, results indicated that only the total COVID‐19 anxiety syndrome score and the scores on the avoidance and perseveration components were positively and significantly correlated with attentional bias indices. More specifically, the general attentional bias index was only shown to be positively and significantly correlated with the total COVID‐19 anxiety syndrome score and its perseveration component, while slowed disengagement was only shown to be negatively and significantly correlated with the total COVID‐19 anxiety syndrome score and its avoidance component.

In this paper, based on the actual situation of COVID-19 and environmental impact assessment guidelines, an immune algorithm is used to establish a location model of urban medical waste storage sites. In view of the selection of temporary storage stations and realistic transportation demand, an efficiency-of-transport model of medical waste between hospitals and temporary storage stations is established by using an ant colony–tabu hybrid algorithm. In order to specify such status, Wuhan city in Hubei Province, China—considered the first city to suffer from COVID-19—was chosen as an example of verification; the two-level model and the immune algorithm–ant colony optimization–tabu search (IA–ACO–TS) algorithm were used for simulation and testing, which achieved good verification. To a certain extent, the model and the algorithm are proposed to solve the problem of medical waste disposal, based on transit temporary storage stations, which we are convinced will have far-reaching significance for China and other countries to dispatch medical waste in response to such public health emergencies.","Liu, Ziyuan; Li, Zhi; Chen, Weiming; Zhao, Yunpu; Yue, Hanxun; Wu, Zhenzhen",Int J Environ Res Public Health,417,4

Their replicative enzymes are translated from their genomic RNA, while their seven structural proteins are encoded by a set of small, partially overlapping genes in the genomic 3′-proximal region. The latter are expressed via synthesis of a set of subgenomic mRNAs that, in general, are functionally monocistronic (except for a bicistronic mRNA encoding the E and GP2 proteins). ORF5, which encodes the major glycoprotein GP5, has been used extensively for phylogenetic analyses. However, an in-depth computational analysis now reveals the arterivirus-wide conservation of an additional AUG-initiated ORF, here termed ORF5a, that overlaps the 5′ end of ORF5. The pattern of substitutions across sequence alignments indicated that ORF5a is subject to functional constraints at the amino acid level, while an analysis of substitutions at synonymous sites in ORF5 revealed a greatly reduced frequency of substitution in the portion of ORF5 that is overlapped by ORF5a. The 43–64 aa ORF5a protein and GP5 are probably expressed from the same subgenomic mRNA, via a translation initiation mechanism involving leaky ribosomal scanning. Inactivation of ORF5a expression by reverse genetics yielded a severely crippled EAV mutant, which displayed lower titres and a tiny plaque phenotype. These defects, which could be partially complemented in ORF5a-expressing cells, indicate that the novel protein, which may be the eighth structural protein of arteriviruses, is expressed and important for arterivirus infection.","Firth, Andrew E.; Zevenhoven-Dobbe, Jessika C.; Wills, Norma M.; Go, Yun Young; Balasuriya, Udeni B.

METHODS: A matched case‐control study of pediatric patients with pneumonia was carried out in Beijing, China, between 2007 and 2015. The study enrolled 334 intensive care unit patients who developed life‐threatening diseases and 522 controls matched to the sex, age, ethnicity, admission dates, and residing district of the cases suffered from pneumonia. Nasopharyngeal aspirates were taken from all participants and tested by PCR for 18 common respiratory viruses. RESULTS: At least, one virus was detected in 257 (77%) of the cases and 409 (78%) of the controls. We observed no difference in the prevalence of 17 respiratory viruses between cases and controls but found a higher frequency of influenza A virus (IFV‐A) in the cases than in the controls (7% vs 4%, P = .036). After adjusting for comorbid conditions and a history of reactive airway diseases, IFV‐A was associated with an increase in life‐threatening pneumonia (adjusted odds ratio = 2.55, 95% CI = 1.24‐5.24).

Studies continue rapidly for the diagnosis and treatment of this disease. It is of great importance that individuals who are infected with this virus be isolated from the rest of the society so that the disease does not spread further. In addition to the tests performed in the detection process of the patients, X-ray and computed tomography are also used. In this study, a new hybrid model that can diagnose Covid-19 from computed tomography images created using EfficientNet, one of the current deep learning models, with a model consisting of attention blocks is proposed. In the first step of this new model, channel attention, spatial attention, and residual blocks are used to extract the most important features from the images. The extracted features are combined in accordance with the hyper-column technique. The combined features are given as input to the EfficientNet models in the second step of the model. The deep features obtained from this proposed hybrid model were classified with the Support Vector Machine classifier after feature selection. Principal Components Analysis was used for feature selection. The approach can accurately predict Covid-19 with a 99% accuracy rate. The first four versions of EfficientNet are used in the approach. In addition, Bayesian optimization was used in the hyper parameter estimation of the Support Vector Machine classifier. Comparative performance analysis of the approach with other approaches in the field is given.","Canayaz, Murat",Chaos Solitons Fractals,417,28

However, there is a paucity of information on the efficacy and safety of BeEAM HDCT. We describe our experience with BeEAM HDCT in terms of safety, efficacy and cost-savings. We compare overall and progression-free survival to a cohort of patients previously transplanted at our institution with the older BEAM regimen. We performed a retrospective chart review of 41 lymphoma patients undergoing BeEAM HDCT at the Royal University Hospital in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan between 2015 and 2019 to elicit regimen safety in the first 100 days post-transplant. Furthermore, we calculated overall and progression-free survival and constructed corresponding Kaplan–Meier curves, comparing the results to a historical cohort of BEAM patients (n = 86). Finally, we conducted an economic analysis using the financials available at our centre’s pharmacy. With regards to BeEAM HDCT, we report a 100-day transplant-related mortality of 2.4%. Additionally, we report acceptable rates of typhlitis (27%), grade III–IV mucositis (4.9%) and grade III–IV nephrotoxicity (2.4%). In terms of overall and progression-free survival, we found no statistical difference between BeEAM and BEAM (p = 0.296; 0.762, respectively). Finally, our economic analysis revealed a net savings of $21,200 CAD per transplant when BeEAM is used in replacement of BEAM. The acceptable safety profile of BeEAM and its comparable efficacy to BEAM are encouraging for the perseverance of this cost-effective HDCT regimen.","Hahn, Logan; Lim, Hyun; Dusyk, Tanner; Sabry, Waleed; Elemary, Mohamed; Stakiw, Julie; Danyluk, Pat; Bosch, Mark",Sci Rep,417,16

Pericytes are perivascular cells within the brain that are proposed as SARS-CoV-2 infection points1. Here we show that pericyte-like cells (PLCs), when integrated into a cortical organoid, are capable of infection with authentic SARS-CoV-2. Prior to infection, PLCs elicited astrocytic maturation and production of basement membrane components, features attributed to pericyte functions in vivo. While traditional cortical organoids showed little evidence of infection, PLCs within cortical organoids served as viral ‘replication hubs’, with virus spreading to astrocytes and mediating inflammatory type I interferon transcriptional responses. Therefore, PLC-containing cortical organoids (PCCOs) represent a new ‘assembloid’ model2 that supports SARS-CoV-2 entry and replication in neural tissue, and PCCOs serve as an experimental model for neural infection.","Wang, Lu; Sievert, David; Clark, Alex E.; Federman, Hannah; Gastfriend, Benjamin D.; Shusta, Eric; Palecek, Sean P.; Carlin, Aaron F.; Gleeson, Joseph",bioRxiv,417,8

Another novel cancer therapy involves the employment of the vascular disrupting agent, 5,6-dimethylxanthenone-4-acetic acid (DMXAA). In the current study, we aimed to test the combination of DMXAA treatment with human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV-16) E7 DNA vaccination to enhance the antitumor effects and E7-specific CD8+ T cell immune responses in treated mice. We determined that treatment with DMXAA generates significant therapeutic effects against TC-1 tumors but does not enhance the antigen-specific immune responses in tumor bearing mice. We then found that combination of DMXAA treatment with E7 DNA vaccination generates potent antitumor effects and E7-specific CD8+ T cell immune responses in the splenocytes of tumor bearing mice. Furthermore, the DMXAA-mediated enhancement or suppression of E7-specific CD8+ T cell immune responses generated by CRT/E7 DNA vaccination was found to be dependent on the time of administration of DMXAA and was also applicable to other antigen-specific vaccines. In addition, we determined that inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) plays a role in the immune suppression caused by DMXAA administration before DNA vaccination.

To understand which contain measures effected disease dynamics, we estimate change points in COVID-19 dynamics by fitting a compartmental model to official Italian data. Our results indicate that lockdowns managed to cause the epidemic to peak in late March 2020. Surprisingly, we found a change point during the decay from the peak, which does not correspond to obvious drastic legal interventions, but may be explained by widespread promotion and mandatory use of face masks. We confirm these interpretations at regional levels, and find that the gradual reopening of society since early May has caused no change in disease dynamics. We speculate that widespread use of face masks and other protective means has contributed substantially to keeping the number of new Italian COVID-19 cases under control in spite of society turning towards a new normality.","Pedersen, M.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, moral distress in medical personnel has gained attention, related to the impact of pandemic-associated factors, such as the uncertainty of treatment options for the virus and the accelerated pace of deaths. Measures to provide aid and mitigate the long-term pandemic effect on providers are starting to be designed. Yet, little has been said about the moral distress experienced by patients and the relational and additive effect on provider moral distress. Pandemic-associated factors affecting moral distress in patients include the constraining effects of isolation on spiritual and religious traditions as well as the intentional separation of patients from their families. This paper will explore the idea that patients are suffering their own moral distress and further how this impacts the intensity of moral distress experienced by the providers—nurses and physicians.

In a recent series of studies, we provided evidence for a motivated scapegoating account of this violence. Specifically, individuals who feel that the course of their (or their family member's) illness is a threat to their sense of control are more likely to express motivation to aggress against healthcare providers. Drawing on existential theory, we propose that blaming and aggressing against a single individual represents a culturally afforded scapegoating mechanism in China. However, in an era of healthcare crisis (i.e., the global COVID-19 pandemic), it is essential to understand cultural variation in scapegoating in the context of healthcare. We therefore undertook two cross-cultural studies examining how people in the United States and China use different scapegoating responses to re-assert a sense of control during medical uncertainty. One study was conducted prior to the pandemic and allowed us to make an initial validating and exploratory investigation of the constructs of interest. The second study, conducted during the pandemic, was confirmatory and investigated mediation path models. Across the two studies, consistent evidence emerged that, both in response to COVID-related and non-COVID-related illness scenarios, Chinese (relative to U.S.) individuals are more likely to respond by aggressing against an individual doctor, while U.S. (relative to Chinese) individuals are more likely to respond by scapegoating the medical industry/system. Further, Study 2 suggests these culture effects are mediated by differential patterns of primary and secondary control-seeking.","Yang, Qian; Young, Isaac F.; Wan, Jialin; Sullivan, Daniel",Front Psychol,417,30

While the proximate mechanisms of these anthropogenic changes are well studied (e.g., climate change, biodiversity loss, population growth), the evolutionary causality of these anthropogenic changes have been largely ignored. Anthroecological theory (AET) proposes that the ultimate cause of anthropogenic environmental change is multi-level selection for niche construction and ecosystem engineering. Here, we integrate this theory with Lotka’s Maximum Power Principle and propose a model linking energy extraction from the environment with genetic, technological and cultural evolution to increase human ecosystem carrying capacity. Carrying capacity is partially determined by energetic factors such as the net energy a population can acquire from its environment and the efficiency of conversion from energy input to offspring output. These factors are under Darwinian genetic selection in all species, but in humans, they are also determined by technology and culture. If there is genetic or non-genetic heritable variation in the ability of an individual or social group to increase its carrying capacity, then we hypothesize that selection or cultural evolution will act to increase carrying capacity. Furthermore, if this evolution of carrying capacity occurs faster than the biotic components of the ecological system can respond via their own evolution, then we hypothesize that unsustainable ecological changes will result.","Snyder, Brian F.",Sustain Sci,417,20

Early laparoscopic appendicectomy is the gold-standard management. SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) brought concerns of increased perioperative mortality and spread of infection during aerosol generating procedures: as a consequence, conservative management was advised, and open appendicectomy recommended when surgery was unavoidable. This study describes the impact of the first weeks of the pandemic on the management of AA in the United Kingdom (UK). METHODS: Patients 18 years or older, diagnosed clinically and/or radiologically with AA were eligible for inclusion in this prospective, multicentre cohort study. Data was collected from 23rd March 2020 (beginning of the UK Government lockdown) to 1st May 2020 and included: patient demographics, COVID status; initial management (operative and conservative); length of stay; and 30-day complications. Analysis was performed on the first 500 cases with 30-day follow-up. RESULTS: The patient cohort consisted of 500 patients from 48 sites. The median age of this cohort was 35 [26–49.75] years and 233 (47%) of patients were female. Two hundred and seventy-one (54%) patients were initially treated conservatively; with only 26 (10%) cases progressing to an operation. Operative interventions were performed laparoscopically in 44% (93/211). Median length of hospital stay was significantly reduced in the conservatively managed group (2 [IQR 1–4] days vs. 3 [2–4], p < 0.001). At 30 days, complications were significantly higher in the operative group (p < 0.001), with no deaths in any group. Of the 159 (32%) patients tested for COVID-19 on admission, only 6 (4%) were positive.

Evidence from Germany,17.435247,3.5248826,2020-12-29,"Much remains unknown concerning the origin of the novel pandemic coronavirus that has raged across the globe since emerging in Wuhan of Hubei province, near the center of the People’s Republic of China, in December of 2019. All current members of the family Coronaviridae have arisen by a combination of incremental adaptive mutations, against the backdrop of many recombinational events throughout the past, rendering each a unique mosaic of RNA sequences from diverse sources. The consensus among virologists is that the base sequence of the novel coronavirus, designated SARS-CoV-2, was derived from a common ancestor of a bat coronavirus, represented by the strain RaTG13, isolated in Yunnan province in 2013. Into that ancestral genetic background, several recombination events have since occurred from other divergent bat-derived coronaviruses, resulting in localized discordance between the two. One such event left SARS-CoV-2 with a receptor binding domain (RBD) capable of binding the human ACE-2 receptor lacking in RaTG13, and a second event uniquely added to SARS-CoV-2 a site specific for furin, capable of efficient endoproteolytic cleavage and activation of the spike glycoprotein responsible for virus entry and cell fusion. This paper demonstrates by bioinformatic analysis that such recombinational events are facilitated by short oligonucleotide “breakpoint sequences”, similar to CAGAC, that direct recombination naturally to certain positions in the genome at the boundaries between blocks of RNA code and potentially RNA structure. This “breakpoint sequence hypothesis” provides a natural explanation for the biogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 over time and in the wild.

A poor understanding of the role of PPE and sub-optimal use may fail to prevent or even increase pathogen transmission during routine care or an infectious disease outbreak. Variability in delivery and content of IPC and PPE education and training across organisations can lead to confusion, unsafe practice, and lack of confidence among clinicians. In a national survey we explored the perspectives of Australian and New Zealand IPC professionals on the value and feasibility of a national IPC training and monitoring programme to improve and standardise PPE practice and raise the profile of IPC. METHODS: A population-based online survey that examined hospital PPE training programmes was distributed to members of three major Australasian organisations representing IPC professionals. Quantitative results of the survey have been reported previously. This paper is a qualitative analysis of responses to two open-ended questions about a national approach to training in IPC and the use of PPE. RESULTS: Most respondents agreed that standardising IPC and PPE training could achieve more consistent practice nationally, supported through the provision of educational resources. Including competency in the use of PPE in mandatory IPC standards would assist in improving the practice and raising the profile of IPC more generally.

Among the contributors to thrombosis, the contact activation system and the kallikrein/kinin system, two overlapping plasma proteolytic systems that are often considered as synonymous, regulate thrombosis from different aspects. On one hand, components of the contact activation system such as factor XII initiates activation of the coagulation proteins promoting thrombus formation on artificial surfaces through factor XI- and possibly prekallikrein-mediated intrinsic coagulation. On the other hand, physiological activation of plasma prekallikrein in the kallikrein/kinin system on endothelial cells liberates bradykinin from associated high-molecular-weight kininogen to stimulate the constitutive bradykinin B2 receptor to generate nitric oxide and prostacyclin to induce vasodilation and counterbalance angiotensin II signaling from the renin-angiotensin system which stimulates vasoconstriction. In addition to vascular tone regulation, this interaction between the kallikrein/kinin and renin-angiotensin systems has a thrombo-regulatory role independent of the contact pathway. At the level of the G-protein coupled receptors of these systems, defective bradykinin signaling due to attenuated bradykinin formation and/or decreased B2 receptor expression, as seen in murine prekallikrein and B2 receptor null mice, respectively, leads to compensatory overexpressed Mas, the receptor for angiotensin-(1-7) of the renin-angiotensin system. Mas stimulation and/or its increased expression contributes to maintaining a healthy vascular homeostasis by generating graded elevation of plasma prostacyclin which reduces thrombosis through two independent pathways: (1) increasing the vasoprotective transcription factor Sirtuin 1 to suppress tissue factor expression, and (2) inhibiting platelet activation. This review will summarize the recent advances in this field that support these understandings. Appreciating these subtle mechanisms help to develop novel anti-thrombotic strategies by targeting the vascular receptors in the renin-angiotensin and the kallikrein/kinin systems to maintain healthy vascular homeostasis.","Fang, Chao; Schmaier, Alvin H.",Pharmacol Res,417,16

In integrated water resource management, water quality indicators are critical. The low groundwater quality quantitates mainly attributed to the absence of protection systems for polluted streams that collect and recycle the untreated wastewater. Egypt has a limited river network; thus, the supply of water resources remains inadequate to satisfy domestic demand. In this regard, high-quality groundwater is one of the main strategies for saving water supplies with water shortage problems. This paper investigates the critical issues of groundwater protection and environmental management of polluted streams, leading to overcoming water demand-about 18 × 10(3) km of polluted open streams with a discharge of 9.70 billion Cubic Metter (BCM). We have proposed proposals and policies for the safe use of groundwater and reuse of wastewater recycling for agriculture and other purposes. This study was carried out using the numerical model MODFLOW and MT3DMS—(Mass Transport 3-Dimension Multi-Species) to assess the Wastewater Treated Plant's (WWTP) best location and the critical path for using different lining materials of polluted streams to avoid groundwater contamination. The three contaminants are BOD, COD, and TDS. Five scenarios were applied for mitigating the impact of polluted water: (1) abstraction forcing, (2) installing the WWTP at the outlet of the main basin drain with and without a lining of main and sub-basin streams (base case), (3) lining of main and sub-main streams, (4) installing WWTP at the outlet of the sub-basin streams, and (5) lining of the sub-basin and installing WWTP at the outlet of the sub-basin. The results showed that the best location of WWTP in polluted streams is developed at the outlets of sub-basin with the treatment of main basin water and the lining of sub-basins streams. The contamination was reduced by 76.07, 76.38, and 75.67% for BOD, COD, and TDS, respectively, using Cascade Aeration Biofilter or Trickling Filter, Enhancing Solar water Disinfection [(CABFESD)/(CATFESD)] and High-Density Polyethylene lining. This method is highly effective and safe for groundwater and surface water environmental protection. This study could be managing the water poverty for polluted streams and groundwater in the Global South and satisfy the environmental issues to improve water quality and reduce the treatment and health cost in these regions.","Abd-Elaty, Ismail; Kuriqi, Alban; Shahawy, Abeer El",Nat Hazards (Dordr),417,16

Since SARS-CoV-2 is a new virus, everyone is at risk of catching the Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19). No one has immunity to the virus. Despite this, misconceptions about specific groups of people who are immune to Covid-19 emerged with the onset of the pandemic. This paper explores South African communities’ misconceptions about who is most vulnerable to Covid-19. A rapid qualitative assessment was conducted remotely in Gauteng, KwaZulu-Natal and the Western Cape provinces of South Africa. Recruitment of study participants took place through established relationships with civil society organizations and contacts made by researchers. In total, 60 key informant interviews and one focus group discussion was conducted. Atlas.ti.8 Windows was used to facilitate qualitative data analysis. The qualitative data was coded, and thematic analysis used to identify themes. The results show a high level of awareness and knowledge of the transmission and prevention of SARS-CoV-2. Qualitative data revealed that there is awareness of elderly people and those with immunocompromised conditions being more vulnerable to catching Covid-19. However, misconceptions of being protected against the virus or having low or no risk were also evident in the data. We found that false information circulated on social media not only instigated confusion, fear and panic, but also contributed to the construction of misconceptions, othering and stigmatizing responses to Covid-19. The study findings bring attention to the importance of developing communication materials adapted to specific communities to help reduce misconceptions, othering and stigmatization around Covid-19.","Schmidt, Tenielle; Cloete, Allanise; Davids, Adlai; Makola, Lehlogonolo; Zondi, Nokubonga; Jantjies, Monalisa",PLoS One,417,24

Even though transmission is a direct result of human encounters, environmental conditions, such as lower humidity, may enhance aerosolized transmission risks similar to other respiratory viruses such as influenza. Methods: We utilized dynamic time warping to cluster all 3,137 counties in the United States based on temporal data on absolute humidity from March 10 to September 29, 2020. We then used a multivariate generalized additive model (GAM) combining data on human mobility derived from mobile phone data with humidity data to identify the potential effect of absolute humidity and mobility on new daily cases of COVID-19 while considering the temporal differences between seasons. Results: The clustering analysis found ten groups of counties with similar humidity levels. We found a significant negative effect between increasing humidity and new cases of COVID-19 in most regions, particularly in the period from March to July. The effect was greater in regions with generally lower humidity in the Western, Midwest, and Northeast regions of the US. In the two regions with the largest effect, a 1 g/m3 increase of absolute humidity resulted in a 0.21 and 0.15 decrease in cases. The effect of mobility on cases was positive and significant across all regions in the July-Sept time period, though the relationship in some regions was more mixed in the March to June period. Conclusions: We found that increasing humidity played an important role in falling cases in the spring, while increasing mobility in the summer contributed more significantly to increases in the summer. Our findings suggest that, similar to other respiratory viruses, the decreasing humidity in the winter is likely to lead to an increase in COVID-19 cases. Furthermore, the fact that mobility data were positively correlated suggests that efforts to counteract the rise in cases due to falling humidity can be effective in limiting the burden of the pandemic.","Lin, G.; Hamilton, A.; Gatalo, O.; Haghpanah, F.; Igusa, T.; Klein, E.; Network, CDC MInD-Healthcare",,417,29

Therefore, the need remains to understand how the virus is transmitted in order to identify high-risk environments and activities that disproportionately contribute to its spread so that effective preventative measures could be put in place. Contact tracing and household studies in particular provide robust evidence about the parameters of transmission. In this viewpoint, we discuss the available evidence from large-scale, well-conducted contact tracing studies from across the world and argue that SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics should inform policy decisions about mitigation strategies for targeted interventions according to the needs of the society by directing attention to the settings, activities and socioeconomic factors associated with the highest risks of transmission.","Cevik, Muge; Marcus, Julia L; Buckee, Caroline; Smith, Tara C",Clin Infect Dis,417,16

This study investigated changes in air pollution during the social distancing after the COVID-19 outbreak in Korea. Ambient PM2.5, PM10, NO2, and CO that are particularly related to industrial activities and traffic were reduced during the social distancing in response to the COVID-19 outbreak. In March 2020, immediately after social distancing, mean levels of PM2.5, PM10, NO2, and CO decreased nationwide from last year's mean levels by 16.98 μg/m3, 21.61 μg/m3, 4.16 ppb, and 0.09 ppm, respectively (p-value for the year-to-year difference < 0.001, =0.001, =0.008, <0.001), a decrease by 45.45%, 35.56%, 20.41%, and 17.33%, respectively. Changes in ambient O3 or SO2 were not observed to be attributable to social distancing. Our findings, that such effort for a short period of time resulted in a significant reduction in air pollution, may point toward reducing air pollution as a public health problem in a more sustainable post-COVID-19 world.","Ju, Min Jae; Oh, Jaehyun; Choi, Yoon-Hyeong",Sci Total Environ,417,20

Environmental tobacco/cigarette smoke (CS) disrupts circadian clock leading to enhanced inflammatory responses. Infection with influenza A virus (IAV) increases hospitalization rates and death in susceptible individuals, including patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). We hypothesized that molecular clock disruption is enhanced by IAV infection, altering cellular and lung function, leading to severity in airway disease phenotypes. C57BL/6J mice exposed to chronic CS, BMAL1 knockout (KO) mice and wild-type littermates were infected with IAV. Following infection, we measured diurnal rhythms of clock gene expression in the lung, locomotor activity, pulmonary function, inflammatory, pro-fibrotic and emphysematous responses. Chronic CS exposure combined with IAV infection altered the timing of clock gene expression and reduced locomotor activity in parallel with increased lung inflammation, disrupted rhythms of pulmonary function, and emphysema. BMAL1 KO mice infected with IAV showed pronounced detriments in behavior and survival, and increased lung inflammatory and pro-fibrotic responses. This suggests that remodeling of lung clock function following IAV infection alters clock-dependent gene expression and normal rhythms of lung function, enhanced emphysematous and injurious responses. This may have implications for the pathobiology of respiratory virus-induced airway disease severity and exacerbations.","Sundar, Isaac K.; Ahmad, Tanveer; Yao, Hongwei; Hwang, Jae-woong; Gerloff, Janice; Lawrence, B.

At the same time, the pandemic’s disproportionate impact on Latinx populations underscores the need for information to reach Spanish speakers. However, the equity of COVID-19 information communicated through institutions’ online media to Spanish-speaking cancer patients is unknown. OBJECTIVE: We conducted a multimodal, mixed method document review study to evaluate the equity of online information about COVID-19 and cancer available to English- and Spanish-speaking populations from seven health care institutions in North Texas, where one in five adults is Spanish-speaking. Our focus was less on the “digital divide,” which conveys disparities in access to computers and the internet based on the race/ethnicity, education, and income of at-risk populations; rather, our study asks the following question: to what extent is online content useful and culturally appropriate in meeting Spanish speakers’ information needs? METHODS: We reviewed 50 websites (33 English and 17 Spanish) over a period of 1 week in the middle of May 2020. We sampled seven institutions’ main oncology and COVID web pages, and both internal (institutional) and external (noninstitutional) linked content. We conducted several analyses for each sampled page, including (1) thematic content analysis, (2) literacy level analysis using Readability Studio software, (3) coding using the Patient Education and Materials Assessment Tool (PEMAT), and (4) descriptive analysis of video and diversity content. RESULTS: The themes most frequently addressed on English and Spanish websites differed. While “resources/FAQs” were frequently cited themes on both websites, English websites more frequently addressed “news/updates” and “cancer+COVID,” and Spanish websites addressed “protection” and “COVID data.” Spanish websites had on average a lower literacy level (11th grade) than English websites (13th grade), although still far above the recommended guideline of 6th to 8th grade. The PEMAT’s overall average accessibility score was the same for English (n=33 pages) and Spanish pages (n=17 pages) at 82%. Among the Dallas-Fort Worth organizations, the average accessibility of Spanish pages (n=7) was slightly lower than that of English pages (n=19) (77% vs 81%), due mostly to the discrepancy in English-only videos and visual aids. Of the 50 websites, 12 (24%) had embedded videos; however, 100% of videos were in English, including one on a Spanish website. CONCLUSIONS: We identified an uneven response among the seven health care institutions for providing equitable information to Spanish-speaking Dallas-Fort Worth residents concerned about COVID and cancer. Spanish speakers lack equal access in both diversity of content about COVID-19 and access to other websites, leaving an already vulnerable cancer patient population at greater risk. We recommend several specific actions to enhance content and navigability for Spanish speakers.","Higashi, Robin T; Sweetenham, John W; Israel, Aimee D; Tiro, Jasmin A",JMIR Cancer,417,23

Previous global epidemics led to an increase in the number of psychiatric patients presenting symptoms of anxiety or depression. Knowledge about the impact of early lockdown initiatives during the COVID‐19 pandemic on the number of healthcare interactions is sparse. Contacts in this study include all recorded face‐to‐face (FTF) and virtual treatment interactions between patients and healthcare systems. Aim: To investigate both the impact of the Danish lockdown event on psychiatric patients’ contact with the healthcare system, stratified by type of contact (FTF or virtual) and ICD‐10 diagnosis, and how acute contacts were impacted in the five regions in Denmark. Methods: An interrupted time series analysis was applied to determine the effect of the COVID‐19 lockdown event on the number of contacts with psychiatric hospitals in Denmark, from February 25, 2019 to May 3, 2020. The analyses took a Box‐Jenkins approach to fit an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model. Results: Virtual contacts replaced most FTF contacts during the lockdown. For most patient groups, the total number of contacts did not decrease significantly. However, for adult patients diagnosed with ICD‐10 F 0–10, 10–19, and 60–69 and child and adolescent patients diagnosed with F 10–19, 70–79, and 80–89, the number of contacts decreased during lockdown. The number of acute contacts with the psychiatric system decreased significantly in all regions in Denmark during lockdown. Discussion: The Danish healthcare system was forced to introduce innovative tele‐psychiatry to mental health care during the lockdown. Disruption to service delivery was minimized because the resources were in place to sustain the transition from FTF to virtual contacts.","Hansen, Jens Peter; van Sas, Tessa Quirina Bang; Fløjstrup, Marianne; Brabrand, Mikkel; Hvolby, Allan",Brain Behav,417,1

OBJECTIVE The primary aim was to compare length of stay (LOS) and discharge disposition of adult spinal deformity (ASD) patients undergoing surgery before and during the pandemic. Secondary aims were to compare the rates of 30-day complications, reoperations, readmissions, and unplanned emergency department (ED) visits. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA ASD patients often require extended LOS and non-routine discharge. Given resource limitations during the COVID-19 pandemic and caution regarding hospital stays, surgeons modified standard postoperative protocols to minimize patient exposure. METHODS We identified all patients who underwent elective thoracolumbar ASD surgery with ≥5 levels fusion at a tertiary care center during two distinct time intervals: Jul-Dec 2019 (Pre-COVID, N = 60) and Jul-Dec 2020 (During-COVID, N = 57). Outcome measures included LOS and discharge disposition (home vs. non-home), as well as 30-day major complications, reoperations, readmissions, and ED visits. Regression analyses controlled for demographic and surgical factors. RESULTS Patients who underwent ASD surgery during the pandemic were younger (61 vs. 67 years) and had longer fusion constructs (9 vs. 8 levels) compared to before the pandemic (p < 0.05 for both). On bivariate analysis, patients undergoing surgery during the pandemic had shorter LOS (6 vs. 9 days) and were more likely to be discharged home (70% vs. 28%) (p < 0.05 for both). After controlling for age and levels fused on multivariable regression, patients who had surgery during the pandemic had shorter LOS (IRR = 0.83, p = 0.015) and greater odds of home discharge (OR = 7.2, p < 0.001). Notably, there were no differences in major complications, reoperations, readmissions, or ED visits between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS During the COVID-19 pandemic, LOS for patients undergoing thoracolumbar ASD surgery decreased, and more patients were discharged home without adversely affecting complication or readmission rates. Lessons learned during the pandemic may help improve resource utilization without negatively influencing short-term outcomes.Level of Evidence: 3.","Wang, Kevin Y; McNeely, Emmanuel L; Dhanjani, Suraj A; Raad, Micheal; Puvanesarajah, Varun; Neuman, Brian J; Cohen, David; Khanna, A Jay; Kebaish, Floreana; Hassanzadeh, Hamid; Kebaish, Khaled M",Spine,417,16
