202556,202556,202556,Concerns for others increases the likelihood of vaccination against influenza and COVID-19 more in sparsely rather than densely populated areas,6.5429745,6.973266,2021,"BACKGROUND: Prior to the COVID-19 global health emergency, telehealth was an emerging occupational therapy (OT) service delivery model possessing many positive attributes. These include the potential to offset well-documented global occupational therapy practitioner (OTP) shortages. However, wide-spread adoption of telehealth as a delivery model in school-based practice is lacking in the OT evidence literature. While the COVID-19 global health emergency propelled many OTPs into the use of telehealth technologies, in some cases with minimal preparation, an investigation was conducted into the likelihood of telehealth adoption when comprehensive training was provided so that appropriateness of student fit for telehealth could be determined and essential planning could take place. OBJECTIVE: Prior to the COVID-19 global health emergency, a comprehensive training program was developed incorporating detailed perceptions of OTPs experienced in and new to telehealth in school-based practice as measured via surveys with the goal of increasing adoption of telehealth technologies for the delivery of OT services. Following the completion of the online New to Telehealth Pre-training Survey, OTPs new to telehealth were invited to complete the OT Telehealth Primer: School-based Practice training program. Analysis of pre- and post-training surveys yielded information about attitudinal changes experienced post-training. METHODS: Prior to the COVID-19 global health emergency, school-based occupational therapy practitioners (OTP) experienced in telehealth were invited to complete a survey exploring benefits and barriers encountered in the delivery of OT services using telehealth. OTPs new-to-telehealth were invited to complete a different survey intended to explore attitudes about the potential use of telehealth. Data collected from both surveys were used to develop a comprehensive training program, The OT Telehealth Primer for School-based Practice. OTPs new-to-telehealth were invited to complete the training program and a post-training survey. A descriptive data analysis was completed on responses from pre- to post-training surveys and the chi-square test of independence was used to evaluate difference in reported likelihood of adopting telehealth into practice before and after training. RESULTS: Prior to the COVID-19 global health emergency, the top benefits identified by the OTP Experienced Telehealth-User Survey included: 1) service access, 2) collaboration and carry-over with team members, 3) efficiency themes, and4) student engagement and comfort. Top benefits identified by the OTP New to Telehealth Survey identified the same top benefits after participating in the training program. A significant decrease in perceived barriers was noted in scores from pre- to post-training by OTPs new to telehealth. The perceived barriers that did not significantly decrease post-training suggest the need for future education and future protocol development. These included: unreliable internet, lack of hands-on opportunity and e-helpers' (parent, caregiver or support system available to assist the student in person during a telehealth session) decreased comfort with technology. Of the participants who completed the OT Telehealth Primer: School-based Practice, 80% reported being likely to add telehealth as a delivery model for future OT practice. CONCLUSIONS: Prior to the COVID-19 global health emergency, completion of the comprehensive training program OT Telehealth Primer: School-based Practice program yielded improved perceived benefits and an increased likelihood of telehealth adoption into practice by OTPs. However, both OTPs and school administrators require ongoing education for successful widespread adoption to be achieved thus offsetting the global shortage of OTPs and increasing service access. Future research, particularly related to available training and support for the rapid adoption of telehealth technologies during the COVID-19 global health emergency, will yield helpful information about the likelihood of continued use of telehealth in practice.","Abbott-Gaffney, Cynthia; Jacobs, Karen",Work,949,12

Activities requiring human gatherings have either been postponed, cancelled, or held completely virtually. To supplement lack of in-person contact, people have increasingly turned to virtual settings on-line, advantages of which include increased inclusivity and accessibility and reduction of carbon footprint. However, emerging online technologies cannot fully replace, in-person scientific events. In-person meetings are not susceptible to poor internet connectivity problems, and they provide novel opportunities for socialization, creating new collaborations, and sharing ideas. To continue such activities, a hybrid model for scientific events could be a solution offering both in-person and virtual components. While participants can freely choose the mode of their participation, virtual meetings would most benefit those who cannot attend in-person due to the limitations. In-person portions of meetings should be organized with full consideration of prevention and safety strategies including risk assessment and mitigation, venue and environmental sanitation, participant protection and disease prevention, and promoting the hybrid model. This new way of interaction between scholars can be considered as a part of a resilience system which was neglected previously and should become a part of routine practice in scientific community.","Hanaei, Sara; Takian, Amirhossein; Majdzadeh, Reza; Maboloc, Christopher Ryan; Grossmann, Igor; Gomes, Orlando; Milosevic, Milos; Gupta, Manoj; Shamshirsaz, Alireza A; Harbi, Amine; Burhan, Amer M; Uddin, Lucina Q; Kulasinghe, Arutha; Lam, Chi-Ming; Ramakrishna, Seeram; Alavi, Abass; Nouwen, Jan L; Dorigo, Tommaso; Schreiber, Michael; Abraham, Ajith; Shelkovaya, Natalya; Krysztofiak, Wojtek; Ebrahimi Warkiani, Majid; Sellke, Frank; Ogino, Shuji; Barba, Francisco J; Brand, Serge; Vasconcelos, Clara; Salunke, Deepak B; Rezaei, Nima",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,949,16

However, it is possible that too many correct/wrong pseudo labeled examples are eliminated/selected. In this work we develop a simple yet powerful framework, whose key idea is to select a subset of training examples from the unlabeled data when performing existing SSL methods so that only the unlabeled examples with pseudo labels related to the labeled data will be used to train models. The selection is performed at each updating iteration by only keeping the examples whose losses are smaller than a given threshold that is dynamically adjusted through the iteration. Our proposed approach, Dash, enjoys its adaptivity in terms of unlabeled data selection and its theoretical guarantee. Specifically, we theoretically establish the convergence rate of Dash from the view of non-convex optimization. Finally, we empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in comparison with state-of-the-art over benchmarks.","Xu, Yi; Shang, Lei; Ye, Jinxing; Qian, Qi; Li, Yu-Feng; Sun, Baigui; Li, Hao; Jin, Rong",,949,22

The aim of this paper is to describe the experience of the first month of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in a hospital haemodialysis (HD) unit serving the district of Madrid with the second highest incidence of COVID-19 (almost 1,000 patients in 100,000h). In the form of a diary, we present the actions undertaken, the incidence of COVID-19 in patients and health staff, some clinical characteristics and the results of screening all the patients in the unit. We started with 90 patients on HD: 37 (41.1%) had COVID-19, of whom 17 (45.9%) were diagnosed through symptoms detected in triage or during the session, and 15 (40.5%) through subsequent screening of those who, until that time, had not undergone SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing. Fever was the most frequent symptom, 50% had lymphopenia and 18.4% <95% O2 saturation. Sixteen (43.2%) patients required hospital admission and 6 (16.2%) died. We found a cluster of infection per shift and also among those using public transport. In terms of staff, of the 44 people involved, 15 (34%) had compatible symptoms, 4 (9%) were confirmed as SARS-CoV-2 PCR cases by occupational health, 9 (20%) required some period of sick leave, temporary disability to work (ILT), and 5 were considered likely cases. CONCLUSIONS: We detected a high prevalence of COVID-19 with a high percentage detected by screening; hence the need for proactive diagnosis to stop the pandemic. Most cases are managed as outpatients, however severe symptoms are also appearing and mortality to date is 16.2%. In terms of staff, 20% have required sick leave in relation to COVID-19.","Albalate, Marta; Arribas, Patricia; Torres, Esther; Cintra, Melissa; Alcázar, Roberto; Puerta, Marta; Ortega, Mayra; Procaccini, Fabio; Martin, Juan; Jiménez, Eva; Fernandez, Isabel; de Sequera, Patricia",Nefrologia,949,24

Group-based Pain Management Programs have been viewed as significant treatments aiding patients with self-management of chronic pain. The onset of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) at the beginning of 2020, widely eliminated the in-person Group-based Pain Management Programs. The exploration of therapeutic contextual factors such as the therapeutic alliance and group dynamics in telehealth Group-based Pain Management Programs appears warranted for which reason the Therapeutic Group Context Questionnaire was developed. METHODS: The therapeutic alliance and group dynamics items in the Therapeutic Group Context Questionnaire were developed from an extensive literature review and underwent examination of content validity, internal consistency, reliability, and validity through telehealth Group-based Pain Management Programs. RESULTS: Content validity of the Therapeutic Group Context Questionnaire was established in five separate stages and the psychometrics of the Therapeutic Group Context Questionnaire was found to be very good with high internal consistency and reliability (r = 0.85-0.97) and the ability of the Therapeutic Group Context Questionnaire to differentiate between high and low scorers on the SF-36 emotional well-being measure. DISCUSSION: The examination of therapeutic contextual factors via telehealth Group-based Pain Management Programs using the Therapeutic Group Context Questionnaire appears possible in view of the very good psychometric properties described above. Investigation of therapeutic contextual factors through the Therapeutic Group Context Questionnaire may provide greater insight into the role that these factors may have in telehealth programs and their impact on pain outcomes. Future investigation of the Therapeutic Group Context Questionnaire in non-telehealth Group-based Pain Management Programs, as well as, other disorders being addressed via telehealth appears warranted.","Romm, Marnin J; Cahalin, Lawrence P",J Telemed Telecare,949,1

A novel mapping software integrating vector data and applying an algorithmic solution taking into consideration global activation pattern has been recently described (Coherent&#8482;, Biosense Webster ""Investigational""). OBJECTIVE: We aimed to assess the investigational algorithm to determine the mechanism of AT compared with the standard algorithm. METHODS: This study included patients who underwent ablation of scar-related AT using the Carto 3 and the standard activation algorithm. The mapping data was analyzed retrospectively using the investigational algorithm, and the mechanisms were evaluated by two independent electrophysiologists. RESULTS: A total of 77 scar-related AT activation maps were analyzed (89.6% left atrium, median tachycardia cycle length of 273 milliseconds). Of those, 67 cases with confirmed mechanism of the arrhythmia were used to compare the activation software. The actual mechanism of the arrhythmia was more likely to be identified with the investigational algorithm (67.2% vs 44.8%, P=0.009). In 5 patients with dual-loop circuits, 3/5 (60%) were correctly identified by the investigational algorithm compared to 0/5 (0%) with the standard software. The reduced atrial voltage was prone to lead to less capable identification of mechanism (P for trend: 0.05). The investigational algorithm showed higher inter-reviewer agreement (Cohen's kappa 0.62 vs 0.47). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with scar-related ATs, activation mapping algorithms integrating vector data and ""best-fit"" propagation solution may help in identifying the mechanism and the successful site of termination.

Compared to those who reported positive vaccine intentions, respondents with negative vaccine intentions were significantly less likely to report that they engaged in the COVID-19 prevention behaviors of wearing masks (aOR = 0.53, CI = 0.37-0.76) and social distancing (aOR = 0.22, CI = 0.12-0.42). In a sub-analysis of reasons not to be vaccinated, significant race/ethnic differences were observed. This national survey indicated a modest level of COVID-19 vaccine intention. These data suggest that public health campaigns for vaccine uptake should assess in greater detail the vaccine concerns of Blacks, Hispanics, and women to tailor programs.","Latkin, Carl A; Dayton, Lauren; Yi, Grace; Colon, Brian; Kong, Xiangrong",PLoS One,949,16

From its initial emergence to the present, COVID-19 has posed fundamental challenges to people living with Parkinson's, forcing them to balance the need and desire to stay active and socially connected with the requirement to adhere to strict shelter-at-home orders. As cities and towns worldwide began shutting down in early 2020, people living with Parkinson's found themselves unable to access live dance activities that had provided consistent, reliable physical support; joyful cognitive stimulation; emotional connection; and social engagement. Government sanctioned closures and stay-at-home orders increased the potential for apathy, isolation, anxiety, and stress-factors that are already heightened in people with Parkinson's. COVID-19 also exacerbated disparities based on race, language, socioeconomic background, and age, inequities already present in the Parkinson's community and in Parkinson's-focused dance programming. In this article, the authors provide a description and analysis of ways one dance for Parkinson's program addressed multiples challenges through three key initiatives: online group classes in English and Spanish, telephone-based resources for people without internet access, and robust online training opportunities for teaching artists. The authors outline ways in which the pandemic has increased the inclusive nature of dance for Parkinson's programming and suggest that changes implemented during the pandemic will permanently alter program delivery for the better when it is safe to restore group classes in community settings.","Kelly, Maria Portman; Leventhal, David",Health Promot Pract,949,16

These are projected to increase as human–animal host contact increases owing to increasing environmental degradation that shrinks nature habitats for wildlife over the continent. The current outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) responsible for causing coronavirus disease in 2019 (COVID-19) has reinvigorated discourse on the disruptiveness of the zoonotic emerging infectious diseases, owing to their transboundary character. Even as the world focuses on the COVID-19 sweeping pandemic, the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS)-CoV re-emerged in Saudi Arabia infecting 18 people with five deaths; this has barely received any attention. This outbreak is particularly of concern to the pastoralists in the Horn of Africa, a region that has in recent past seen an increase in camel trade with the Gulf States, especially Yemen and Saudi Arabia. Emerging and re-emerging zoonotic infectious diseases are complex, depend on human–animal–environment interaction and pose a strain on public health systems. There is a need to address these diseases dynamically through a synergistic approach, drawing on expertise from diverse sectors. One Health approach has distinguished itself as an integrative action able to bring together multiple actors on a global, national and local scale to advance the attainment of optimal health outcomes for people, animals and the environment. One Health works by strengthening the preparedness, response, mitigation and monitoring of zoonotic infectious disease risks collaboratively. We opine that as zoonotic emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases continue to rise over pastoral Africa, comprehensive implementation of the One Health approach will be urgently required.","Egeru, Anthony; Dejene, Sintayehu W.; Siya, Aggrey",Pastoralism,949,16

PURPOSE: To compare the insertion torque (IT) and temporal implant stability quotients (ISQ) of implants placed via OD or subtractive drilling (SD). MATERIALS AND METHODS: This multicenter controlled clinical trial enrolled 56 patients, whom were in need of at least 2 implants (n = 150 implants). Patients were treated with narrow, regular, or wide implants and short, regular, or long implants in the anterior or posterior region of the maxilla or in the posterior region of the mandible. Osteotomies were performed following manufacturers recommendation. IT was recorded with a torque indicator. ISQ was recorded with resonance frequency analysis immediately after surgery, 3 and 6 weeks. RESULTS: Data complied as a function of osteotomy indicated significantly higher IT for OD relative to SD. OD outperformed conventional SD for all pairwise comparisons of arches (maxilla and mandible) and areas operated (anterior and posterior), diameters and lengths of the implants, except for short implants. Overall, ISQ data also demonstrated significantly higher values for OD compared to SD regardless of the healing period. Relative to immediate readings, ISQ values significantly decreased at 3 weeks, returning to immediate levels at 6 weeks; however, ISQ values strictly remained above 68 throughout healing time for OD. Data as a function of arch operated and osteotomy, area operated and osteotomy, implant dimensions and osteotomy, also exhibited higher ISQ values for OD relative to SD on pairwise comparisons, except for short implants. CONCLUSIONS: OD demonstrated higher IT and temporal ISQ values relative to SD, irrespective of arch and area operated as well as implant design and dimension, with an exception for short implants. Future studies should focus on biomechanical parameters and bone level change evaluation after loading.","Bergamo, Edmara T P; Zahoui, Abbas; Barrera, Raúl Bravo; Huwais, Salah; Coelho, Paulo G; Karateew, Edward Dwayne; Bonfante, Estevam A",Clin. implant. dent. relat. res,949,16

CC motive chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2), a chemokine originally described as a chemotactic agent for monocytes, is involved in inflammation, coagulation activation and neoangiogenesis. We investigated the association of CCL2 levels with coagulation derangement and respiratory impairment in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated 281 patients admitted to two hospitals in Italy with COVID-19. Among them, CCL2 values were compared in different groups (identified according to D-dimer levels and the lowest PaO2/FiO2 recorded during hospital stay, P/Fnadir) by Jonckheere-Terpstra tests; linear regression analysis was used to analyse the relationship between CCL2 and P/Fnadir. We performed Mann-Whitney test and Kaplan-Meier curves to investigate the role of CCL2 according to different clinical outcomes (survival and endotracheal intubation [ETI]). RESULTS: CCL2 levels were progressively higher in patients with increasing D-dimer levels and with worse gas exchange impairment; there was a statistically significant linear correlation between log CCL2 and log P/Fnadir. CCL2 levels were significantly higher in patients with unfavourable clinical outcomes; Kaplan-Meier curves for the composite outcome death and/or need for ETI showed a significantly worse prognosis for patients with higher (> median) CCL2 levels. CONCLUSIONS: CCL2 correlates with both indices of activation of the coagulation cascade and respiratory impairment severity, which are likely closely related in COVID-19 pathology, thus suggesting that CCL2 could be involved in the thromboinflammatory events characterizing this disease.","Nieri, Dario; Neri, Tommaso; Barbieri, Greta; Moneta, Sara; Morelli, Giovanna; Mingardi, Desirè; Spinelli, Stefano; Ghiadoni, Lorenzo; Falcone, Marco; Tiseo, Giusy; Menichetti, Francesco; Franzini, Maria; Caponi, Laura; Paolicchi, Aldo; Pancani, Roberta; Pistelli, Francesco; Carrozzi, Laura; Celi, Alessandro",Thromb Res,949,24

This study aims to determine the infection containment proportions and cost of two variations of quarantine policies based on geographic travel and close contact with infected individuals within deployed US military populations. Special Operations Command Africa (SOCAF) records of individuals quarantined between March 1, 2020 and June 1, 2020 were examined. The infection containment proportion and cost in containment hours were compared between types of quarantine and between geographic areas. Geographic quarantine contained 2 cases out of 63 quarantined individuals in West Africa (3.2%) compared to 0 out of 221 in East Africa (p = 0.0486). Close contact quarantine contained 3 cases out of 31 quarantined individuals in West Africa compared to 4 out of 55 in East Africa (7.3%, p = 0.6989). Total confinement was 42,048 h for each contained infection using geographic quarantine compared to 4076 h using close contact quarantine. In the US military population deployed to Africa for COVID-19, quarantining based on geographic movement is an order of magnitude more costly in terms of time for each contained infection then quarantining based on close contact with infected individuals. There is not a statistical difference between East and West Africa. The associated costs of quarantine must be carefully weighed against the risk of disease spread.","Hall, Andrew; Qureshi, Iram; Glaser, Jacob; Auchincloss, Paul; Wilson, Ramey",Prev Med,949,32
518733,518733,518733,Timing social distancing to avert unmanageable COVID-19 hospital surges,6.564376,7.077333,2020,"Background: Sexual and gender minority youth (SGMY;eg, lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender youth) are at greater risk than their cisgender heterosexual peers for adolescent relationship abuse (ARA;physical, sexual, or psychological abuse in a romantic relationship). However, there is a dearth of efficacious interventions for reducing ARA among SGMY. To address this intervention gap, we designed a novel web-based methodology leveraging the field of human-centered design to generate multiple ARA intervention concepts with SGMY. Objective: This paper aims to describe study procedures for a pilot study to rigorously test the feasibility, acceptability, and appropriateness of using web-based human-centered design methods with SGMY to create novel, stakeholder-driven ARA intervention concepts. Methods: We are conducting a longitudinal, web-based human-centered design study with 45-60 SGMY (aged between 14 and 18 years) recruited via social media from across the United States. Using MURAL (a collaborative, visual web-based workspace) and Zoom (a videoconferencing platform), the SGMY will participate in four group-based sessions (1.5 hours each). In session 1, the SGMY will use rose-thorn-bud to individually document their ideas about healthy and unhealthy relationship characteristics and then use affinity clustering as a group to categorize their self-reported ideas based on similarities and differences. In session 2, the SGMY will use rose-thorn-bud to individually critique a universal evidence-based intervention to reduce ARA and affinity clustering to aggregate their ideas as a group. In session 3, the SGMY will use a creative matrix to generate intervention ideas for reducing ARA among them and force-rank the intervention ideas based on their potential ease of implementation and potential impact using an importance-difficulty matrix. In session 4, the SGMY will generate and refine intervention concepts (from session 3 ideations) to reduce ARA using round robin (for rapid iteration) and concept poster (for fleshing out ideas more fully). We will use content analyses to document the intervention concepts. In a follow-up survey, the SGMY will complete validated measures about the feasibility, acceptability, and appropriateness of the web-based human-centered design methods (a priori benchmarks for success: means &gt;3.75 on each 5-point scale). Results: This study was funded in February 2020. Data collection began in August 2020 and will be completed by April 2021. Conclusions: Through rigorous testing of the feasibility of our web-based human-centered design methodology, our study may help demonstrate the use of human-centered design methods to engage harder-to-reach stakeholders and actively involve them in the co-creation of relevant interventions. Successful completion of this project also has the potential to catalyze intervention research to address ARA inequities for SGMY. Finally, our approach may be transferable to other populations and health topics, thereby advancing prevention science and health equity.

Pseudotyped viruses are useful for measuring neutralization titers against highly infectious viruses as well as for studying their mechanism of entry. In this study, we constructed a series of cytoplasmic deletion mutants of MERS-CoV S and compared the efficiency with which they formed pseudotypes with vesicular stomatitis virus. A pseudotype bearing an S protein with the C-terminal 16 amino acids deleted (MERSpv-St16) reached a maximum titer that was approximately tenfold higher than that of a pseudotype bearing a non-truncated full-length S protein. Using MERSpv-St16, we demonstrated the inability of rat DPP4 to serve as a functional receptor for MERS-CoV, suggesting that rats are not susceptible to MERS-CoV infection. This study provides novel information that enhances our understanding of the host range of MERS-CoV.

Fears of disruptions in the food supply chain have caused an increase in the quantity and type of food bought by households. However, increases in food purchases could give rise to food waste with negative ramifications for the environment in terms of greenhouse emissions and groundwater pollution. To assess whether household food waste has changed during Covid-19 lockdown, we conducted a nationwide survey of household food purchasers in Italy. Although the amount of food purchases increased during the lockdown, our results show that food waste actually decreased as people mainly bought more non-perishable food. Interestingly, concerns about the impact that the pandemic could have on the waste management system and the desire not to add pressure to the waste management system are key drivers of decreased food waste in Italy during the pandemic. Our findings seem to suggest that Italian consumers are developing a new level of awareness about food waste with potential positive impacts on the environment in terms of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and groundwater pollution.","Pappalardo, Gioacchino; Cerroni, Simone; Nayga, Rodolfo M.; Yang, Wei",Front Nutr,949,16
