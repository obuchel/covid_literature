3058,Obesity and risk of respiratory tract infections: results of an infection-diary based cohort study,2018-02-20,"BACKGROUND: Respiratory tract infections (RTIs) are a major morbidity factor contributing largely to health care costs and individual quality of life. The aim of the study was to test whether obesity (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m(2)) is one of the risk factors underlying frequent RTIs in the German adult population. METHODS: We recruited 1455 individuals between 18 to 70 years from a cross-sectional survey on airway infections in Germany and invited them to self-report in diaries incident RTIs experienced during three consecutive winter/spring seasons. RTIs reported in these 18 months and summary measures adding-up individual RTIs were the outcomes of interest. RESULTS: Compared to individuals with normal weight, obese individuals reported a consistently higher frequency of upper and lower RTIs and predominantly fell in the upper 10% group of a diary sumscore adding-up 10 different RTI symptoms over time. Obesity was associated both with lower RTIs ((adjusted)OR = 2.02, 95%CI = 1.36–3.00) and upper RTIs ((adjusted)OR = 1.55, 95%CI = 1.22–1.96). Adjusting for demographic and lifestyle variables did only marginally affect ORs. Stratified analyses suggested a stronger association for women and effect modifications by sports activity and dietary habits. CONCLUSIONS: We confirm the association of obesity with infection burden and present evidence for putative interaction with sports activity and dietary patterns.

5074,Simit Epidemiological Multicentric Study on Hospitalized Immigrants in Italy During 2002,2005,"Experimental allergic encephalitis (EAE) is an experimental autoimmune inflammatory condition of the central nervous system (CNS) that serves as a disease model for multiple sclerosis (MS). The primary effector mechanisms of the immune system leading to tissue destruction during EAE remain still controversial. T-cells, microglia, and macrophages infiltrating the brain parenchyma are suggested to be involved. To clarify the role of these cells during disease Lewis rats were immunised with different immunisation protocols: Immunisation with myelin basic protein (MBP) in complete Freunds adjuvant (CFA) containing high dose of mycobacterial components induced severe disease, whereas immunisation with low dose of mycobacterial components induced only mild disease. Severely and mildly diseased animals were analysed with respect to infiltration of T-cells, macrophages and upregulation of MHC class II molecules on microglia in the brain. All immunised rats showed high T-cell infiltration accompanied by microglia activation. The degree of disease and the infiltration of macrophages varied with dose of adjuvant. Lowering the dose of adjuvant prevented the development of disease but also the influx of peripheral macrophages into the brain without affecting the peripheral T-cell response to the autoantigen. Thus, appearance of (autoreactive) T-cells in the brain and microglia activation were probably not sufficient for development of disease. It can be concluded that peripheral macrophages play an essential or even key role in the pathogenesis of active EAE.","Imrich, H.; Harzer, K.",J Neural Transm (Vienna),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7087617/,387

6315,Healing Health Care: From Sick Care Towards Salutogenic Healing Systems,2019-04-11,"BACKGROUND: Treatment of resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection continues to be a challenge in Latin American countries (LATAM). We synthesize the literature on the use of appropriate initial antibiotic therapy (AIAT) and inappropriate initial antibiotic therapy (IIAT) in P. aeruginosa infections, and the literature on risk factors for acquisition of resistant P. aeruginosa among hospitalized adult patients in LATAM. METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane, and LILAC were searched between 2000 and August 2019. Abstracts and full-text articles were screened in duplicate. Random effects meta-analysis was conducted when studies were sufficiently similar. RESULTS: The screening of 165 citations identified through literature search yielded 98 full-text articles that were retrieved and assessed for eligibility, and 19 articles conducted in Brazil (14 articles), Colombia (4 articles), and Cuba (1 article) met the inclusion criteria. Of 19 eligible articles, six articles (840 subjects) examined AIAT compared to IIAT in P. aeruginosa infections; 17 articles (3203 total subjects) examined risk factors for acquisition of resistant P. aeruginosa; and four articles evaluated both. Four of 19 articles were rated low risk of bias and the remaining were deemed unclear or high risk of bias. In meta-analysis, AIAT was associated with lower mortality for P. aeruginosa infections (unadjusted summary OR 0.48, 95% CI 0.28–0.81; I(2) = 59%), compared to IIAT and the association with mortality persisted in subgroup meta-analysis by low risk of bias (3 articles; unadjusted summary OR 0.46, 95% CI 0.28–0.81; I(2) = 0%). No meta-analysis was performed for studies evaluating risk factors for acquisition of resistant P. aeruginosa as they were not sufficiently similar. Significant risk factors for acquisition of resistant P. aeruginosa included: prior use of antibiotics (11 articles), stay in the intensive care unit (ICU) (3 articles), and comorbidity score (3 articles). Outcomes were graded to be of low strength of evidence owing to unclear or high risk of bias and imprecise estimates. CONCLUSION: Our study highlights the association of AIAT with lower mortality and prior use of antibiotics significantly predicts acquiring resistant P. aeruginosa infections. This review reinforces the need for rigorous and structured antimicrobial stewardship programs in the LATAM region.","Ponce de Leon, Alfredo; Merchant, Sanjay; Raman, Gowri; Avendano, Esther; Chan, Jeffrey; Tepichin Hernandez, Griselda; Sarpong, Eric",BMC Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7099820/,387
7159,Effects of different broiler production systems on health care costs in the Netherlands,2014-06-01,"Vaccination with a live bivalent vaccine of Newcastle disease virus (NDV) and infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is a routine practice in poultry industry in China. This study was designed to evaluate ginseng stem-leaf saponins (GSLS) in combination with selenium (Se) for their adjuvant effect on the immune response to vaccination against NDV and IBV in chickens. A live bivalent vaccine of NDV and IBV was diluted in saline solution containing GSLS or Se or both and used to immunize chickens via a intraocular-and-intranasal route. Results showed that GSLS promoted significantly higher NDV- and IBV-specific antibody responses with the highest antibody response detected in GSLS-Se group. The increased antibody was capable of neutralizing NDV and IBV. In addition, GSLS-Se enhanced lymphocyte proliferation and production of IFN-γ and IL-4. More importantly GSLS-Se was found to promote early production and prolong the duration of the antibody responses. In order to improve the efficacy of vaccination in chicken flocks, the diluent containing GSLS-Se deserves further studies to evaluate its effect on other chicken vaccines.","Ma, X; Bi, S; Wang, Y; Chi, X; Hu, S",Poult Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7107245/,387

It may be encountered at a relatively high rate in the non-life-threatened fraction of Emergency Department (ED) patients presenting with upper respiratory symptoms or cough. Yet its hallmarks are very non-specific, including a great variety of presentations from mild pharyngitis to potentially life-threatening complications such as the Stevens-Johnson Syndrome. Here, we describe a typical case of pneumonia due to Mycoplasma pneumoniae in a young adult with mild pharyngitis as the leading symptom. Disease presentation, complications, diagnostic means, therapeutic options, and suspicious clinical settings are discussed to provide a review on the clinical aspects of the disease that are important in the ED setting.","Braun, Gerald S.; Wagner, Katrin S.; Huttner, Benedikt D.; Schmid, Holger",J Emerg Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7126277/,387

11015,Critical Issues in Leadership Development for Peer Support Specialists,2020-02-07,"To generate a Hospital Medical Surge Preparedness Index that can be used to evaluate hospitals across the United States in regard to their capacity to handle patient surges during mass casualty events. Data from the American Hospital Association’s annual survey, conducted from 2005 to 2014. Our sample comprised 6239 hospitals across all 50 states, with an annual average of 5769 admissions. An extensive review of the American Hospital Association survey was conducted and relevant variables applicable to hospital inpatient services were extracted. Subject matter experts then categorized these items according to the following subdomains of the “Science of Surge” construct: staff, supplies, space, and system. The variables within these categories were then analyzed through exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses, concluding with the evaluation of internal reliability. Based on the combined results, we generated individual (by hospital) scores for each of the four metrics and an overall score. The exploratory factor analysis indicated a clustering of variables consistent with the “Science of Surge” subdomains, and this finding was in agreement with the statistics generated through the confirmatory factor analysis. We also found high internal reliability coefficients, with Cronbach’s alpha values for all constructs exceeding 0.9. A novel Hospital Medical Surge Preparedness Index linked to hospital metrics has been developed to assess a health care facility’s capacity to manage patients from mass casualty events. This index could be used by hospitals and emergency management planners to assess a facility’s readiness to provide care during disasters.","Marcozzi, David E.; Pietrobon, Ricardo; Lawler, James V.; French, Michael T.; Mecher, Carter; Peffer, John; Baehr, Nicole E.; Browne, Brian J.",Health Serv Outcomes Res Methodol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7222860/,387
11018,Development of a Hospital Medical Surge Preparedness Index using a national hospital survey,2020-02-14,"BACKGROUND: Transthyretin (TTR) has been described as a predictor for outcomes in medical and surgical patients. However, the association of TTR on admission and over time on outcomes has not yet been prospectively assessed in trauma patients. METHODS: This is a prospective observational study including trauma patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of a large Level I trauma center 05/2014–05/2015. TTR levels at ICU admission and all subsequent values over time were recorded. Patients were observed for 28 days or until hospital discharge. The association of outcomes and TTR levels at admission and over time was assessed using multivariable regression and generalized estimating equation (GEE) analysis, respectively. RESULTS: A total of 237 patients with TTR obtained at admission were included, 69 of whom had repeated TTR measurements. Median age was 40.0 years and median ISS 16.0; 83.1% were male. Below-normal TTR levels at admission (41.8%) were independently associated with higher in-hospital mortality (p = 0.042), more infectious complications (p = 0.032), longer total hospital length of stay (LOS) (p = 0.013), and ICU LOS (p = 0.041). Higher TTR levels over time were independently associated with lower in-hospital mortality (p = 0.015), fewer infections complications (p = 0.028), shorter total hospital and ICU LOS (both p < 0.001), and fewer ventilator days (0.004). CONCLUSIONS: In critically ill trauma patients, below-normal TTR levels at admission were independently associated with worse outcomes and higher TTR levels over time with better outcomes, including lower in-hospital mortality, less infectious complications, shorter total hospital and ICU LOS, and fewer ventilator days. Based on these results, TTR may be considered as a prognostic marker in this patient population.","Haltmeier, Tobias; Inaba, Kenji; Durso, Joseph; Khan, Moazzam; Siboni, Stefano; Cheng, Vincent; Schnüriger, Beat; Benjamin, Elizabeth; Demetriades, Demetrios",World J Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7222866/,387
11647,Start Now,2020-05-20,"Doxorubicin-induced nephropathy in mice is a model for studying experimental nephrotic syndrome. It corresponds to puromycin aminonucleoside nephrosis in rats. In this model, susceptible 129 S1/SvImJ mice are administered a rapid intravenous injection that can be accomplished via either the lateral tail vein or the retrobulbar sinus. Because doxorubicin is a highly toxic substance, extravasation must be avoided during the administration of the intravenous injection to prevent the development of large necrotizing lesions and exacerbation of the animals’ stress. In the present study, we compared the safety and stress of these two injection routes by using histopathological analyses of the animals’ orbital cavities or tails, respectively. The injection of 14.5 µg/g body weight doxorubicin into the mice’s lateral tail veins (n = 9) or retrobulbar sinuses (n = 19) caused no clinically detectable stress or impairment. Histopathologies of the specimens five days after doxorubicin injection revealed inflammatory lesions at the injection sites in both groups. In the orbital sinus specimens from the retrobulbar-injected group, fibrosis was evident 25 days after injection. Moreover, while all of the retrobulbar-injected mice (100%) developed nephrotic syndrome, tail vein-injected mice had a significantly lower response rate (66%, p = 0.047, Fisher’s exact test) and exhibited only attenuated features of nephrotic syndrome. It was therefore concluded that doxorubicin administration via either lateral tail vein or retrobulbar sinus injections led to a similar induction of histopathological changes with no effects on the clinical well-being of the mice. However, retrobulbar sinus injections were more efficient for inducing experimental nephrotic syndrome.","Bohnert, Bernhard N.; Dörffel, Thomas; Daiminger, Sophie; Calaminus, Carsten; Aidone, Sandro; Falkenau, Almuth; Semrau, Antje; Le, Mai J.; Iglauer, Franz; Artunc, Ferruh",Lab Anim,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7238670/,387

15125,An integrated model for evaluation of maternal health care in China,2021-01-28,"BACKGROUND: Every year, approximately 42 million people sustain a mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI, also known as concussion), with particularly high rates among college-aged individuals. A substantial proportion of these people (44%-64%) develop persistent symptoms that are challenging to treat, costly, and associated with significant disability. Anxiety has emerged as a risk factor for progression from acute to persistent mTBI symptoms. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to develop, adapt, and establish the feasibility of the Toolkit for Optimal Recovery after Concussions (TOR-C), an innovative mind-body program aimed at preventing persistent symptoms among young adults with mTBI and comorbid anxiety. Here, we describe the proposed study design, methodology, measurement, and treatment manuals. METHODS: In phase 1, we will conduct individual, live video qualitative interviews (up to n=20) with college-aged individuals with mTBI and comorbid anxiety to inform adaptation of the intervention and study procedures. In phase 2, an open pilot of the live video TOR-C (n=5) with exit interviews will be conducted to explore the initial feasibility, acceptability, and credibility of the program and to refine the study procedures. Phase 3 will involve conducting a feasibility randomized controlled trial (N=50) of the TOR-C versus a health education control (Health Enhancement for Concussions; HE-C), both delivered via live video, to establish feasibility of recruitment procedures (screening, eligibility, and enrollment) and data collection; feasibility, credibility, and acceptability of the live video TOR-C and HE-C (adherence, retention, fidelity, and satisfaction) following prespecified benchmarks; and a signal of improvement in outcomes. RESULTS: Phase 1 of the study has been approved by the Massachusetts General Hospital Institutional Review Board. Study completion is anticipated by early 2025. CONCLUSIONS: We will develop and test the first mind-body intervention focused on prevention of persistent symptoms following mTBI in young adults with comorbid anxiety problems. This will allow us to establish feasibility markers in postconcussive symptoms, anxiety, disability, and fear avoidance to inform a future efficacy trial of the TOR-C versus HE-C.

Amniotic membrane sweeping has been recommended as a simple procedure to promote the spontaneous onset of labour. However, despite its widespread use, there is an absence of evidence on (a) its effectiveness and (b) its optimal timing and frequency. The primary aim of the MILO Study is to inform the optimal design of a future definitive randomised trial to evaluate the effectiveness (including optimal timing and frequency) of membrane sweeping to prevent post-term pregnancy. We will also assess the acceptability and feasibility of the proposed trial interventions to clinicians and women (through focus group interviews). METHODS/DESIGN: Multicentre, pragmatic, parallel-group, pilot randomised controlled trial with an embedded factorial design. Pregnant women with a live, singleton foetus ≥ 38 weeks gestation; cephalic presentation; longitudinal lie; intact membranes; English speaking and ≥ 18 years of age will be randomised in a 2:1 ratio to membrane sweep versus no membrane sweep. Women allocated randomly to a sweep will then be randomised further (factorial component) to early (from 39 weeks) versus late (from 40 weeks) sweep commencement and a single versus weekly sweep. The proposed feasibility study consists of four work packages, i.e. (1) a multicentre, pilot randomised trial; (2) a health economic analysis; (3) a qualitative study; and (4) a study within the host trial (a SWAT). Outcomes to be collected include recruitment and retention rates, compliance with protocol, randomisation and allocation processes, attrition rates and cost-effectiveness. Focus groups will be held with women and clinicians to explore the acceptability and feasibility of the proposed intervention, study procedures and perceived barriers and enablers to recruitment. DISCUSSION: The primary aim of the MILO Study is to inform the optimal design of a future definitive randomised trial to evaluate the effectiveness (including optimal timing and frequency) of membrane sweeping to prevent post-term pregnancy.

17519,Patients with young-onset dementia in an older people's mental health service,2021-04-11,"Over the past two decades, the rapid rise of social media has revolutionized the way we communicate and share information online. Social media platforms are not now only used extensively by individuals but also by businesses, governmental agencies, educational institutions, and many other organizations to deliver information to the public and, in return, collect information from that same audience. The preliminary study presented here offers valuable insights into how social media may be used to improve food safety standards. Today, food safety is still a major health challenge in the country, which occasionally faces unsafe food supply chains, an increased number of food borne outbreaks, and poor hygiene education. Social media may be used as a very valuable tool for people to access important information and more knowledge about food safety. The limited-scope survey presented here was conducted over the western part of Saudi Arabia and included 295 individuals of both genders, among various age groups. Participants responded to an online questionnaire about their use of social media to obtain information about food safety. Results showed that social media was indeed a major outlet for individuals to access information on food safety, with the top-ranked social media platforms being WhatsApp (M = 2.99) followed by Snapchat (M = 3.72), YouTube (M = 4.08), Instagram (M = 4.46), and Facebook (M = 4.81). Additionally, we found that the most trusted sources of information was the Saudi Food and Drug Authority (72.6%) and the Saudi Ministry of Health (55.4%). Participants most frequently sought epidemiological information (52.5%), quantitative risk estimates (23.1%), and information on the various types of foodborne infections (15.3%); they preferred the information to be in video format (67.5%), articles (57.6%), infographics (55.3%). Trustworthiness clearly emerged from the survey as an important consideration for individuals when accessing food safety information on social media.","Abdulsalam, Nisreen M; Bakarman, Marwan A",AIMS Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8116190/,387
17631,Artificial intelligence: A rapid case for advancement in the personalization of Gynaecology/Obstetric and Mental Health care,2021-05-14,"The long-term ecological success of compensatory freshwater wetland projects has come into question based on follow-up monitoring studies over the past few decades. Given that wetland restoration may require many years to decades to converge to desired outcomes, long-term monitoring of successional patterns may increase our ability to fully evaluate success of wetland mitigation projects or guide adaptive management when needed. In Portsmouth, New Hampshire a 4 ha wetland was constructed in an abandoned gravel quarry as off-site compensatory mitigation for impacts to a scrub-shrub swamp associated with property expansion. Building upon prior evaluations from 1992 and 2002, we conducted a floral survey in 2020 to compare results with prior surveys to document vegetation successional trends over time. In addition, we monitored the avian community throughout the growing season as a measure of habitat quality. The plant community mirrored documented successional trends of freshwater wetland restoration projects as native hydrophytes dominated species composition. Plant species composition stabilized as the rate of turnover, the measurement of succession, declined by nearly half after 17 years. Researchers should consider long-term monitoring of specific sites to better understand successional patterns of created wetlands as we documented long time frames required for the development of scrub-shrub swamps, red maple swamps, and sedge meadows. High species richness was attributed to beaver activity, topographic heterogeneity from Carex stricta tussocks, and the seed bank from the application of peat from the original wetland. Habitat heterogeneity of open water, herbaceous cover, and woody vegetation supports a diverse avian community including 11 wetland dependent species. Although the mitigation project has not created the full area of lost scrub-shrub swamp after 35 years, it has developed a structurally complex habitat and diverse avian community that effectively provides the functions and values of the impacted system.","McKown, J.

One key factor and severe challenge to maintaining quality of life in older adults is cognitive decline. Assistive robots for helping older adults have been proposed to solve issues such as social isolation and dependent living. Only a few studies have reported the positive effects of dialogue robots on cognitive function but conversation is being discussed as a promising intervention that includes various cognitive tasks. Existing dialogue robot-related studies have reported on placing dialogue robots in elderly homes and allowing them to interact with residents. However, it is difficult to reproduce these experiments since the participants’ characteristics influence experimental conditions, especially at home. Besides, most dialogue systems are not designed to set experimental conditions without on-site support. This study proposes a novel design method that uses a dialogue-based robot system for cognitive training at home. We define challenges and requirements to meet them to realize cognitive function training through daily communication. Those requirements are designed to satisfy detailed conditions such as duration of dialogue, frequency, and starting time without on-site support. Our system displays photos and gives original stories to provide contexts for dialogue that help the robot maintain a conversation for each story. Then the system schedules dialogue sessions along with the participant’s plan. The robot moderates the user to ask a question and then responds to the question by changing its facial expression. This question-answering procedure continued for a specific duration (4 min). To verify our design method’s effectiveness and implementation, we conducted three user studies by recruiting 35 elderly participants. We performed prototype-, laboratory-, and home-based experiments. Through these experiments, we evaluated current datasets, user experience, and feasibility for home use. We report on and discuss the older adults’ attitudes toward the robot and the number of turns during dialogues. We also classify the types of utterances and identify user needs. Herein, we outline the findings of this study, outlining the system’s essential characteristics to experiment toward daily cognitive training and explain further feature requests.","Tokunaga, Seiki; Tamura, Kazuhiro; Otake-Matsuura, Mihoko",Front Robot AI,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8275646/,387

I here propose a causality clustering approach, based on grouping nodes into clusters according to their similarity in the overall information dynamics, the latter one being measured by a causality metric. The whole system can then arbitrarily be simplified, with nodes being grouped in e.g. sources, brokers and sinks of information.

Both forms of therapy are suitable for effectively treating tumors with comparatively low systemic side effects. Nevertheless, even these treatment approaches have side effects, which are triggered by the toxicity of the radiation and by the immunomodulatory effects of the administered drugs. The pneumotoxic potential of these forms of therapy is reflected in the development of interstitial pneumonitis, which can transition into fibrotic changes in the lung structure. The clinical diagnosis of the disease is made more difficult as the symptoms are nonspecific. Computed tomography (CT) is an excellent means of diagnosing the corresponding consolidations and to monitor them over time. Therefore, in the interdisciplinary context the radiologist plays a central role in the diagnostics of this disease.","Hellbach, Katharina",Radiologe,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8456401/,387

These are known for their antimicrobial properties, as well as for their roles in organoleptic changes, antioxidant activity, nutrient digestibility, the release of peptides and polysaccharides, amino acid decarboxylation, and biogenic amine production and degradation. Due to their antimicrobial properties, LAB are used in humans and in animals, with beneficial effects, as probiotics or in the treatment of a variety of diseases. In livestock production, LAB contribute to animal performance, health, and productivity. In the food industry, LAB are applied as bioprotective and biopreservation agents, contributing to improve food safety and quality. However, some studies have described resistance to relevant antibiotics in LAB, with the concomitant risks associated with the transfer of antibiotic resistance genes to foodborne pathogens and their potential dissemination throughout the food chain and the environment. Here, we summarize the application of LAB in livestock and animal products, as well as the health impact of LAB in animal food products. In general, the beneficial effects of LAB on the human food chain seem to outweigh the potential risks associated with their consumption as part of animal and human diets. However, further studies and continuous monitorization efforts are needed to ensure their safe application in animal products and in the control of pathogenic microorganisms, preventing the possible risks associated with antibiotic resistance and, thus, protecting public health.","Miranda, Carla; Contente, Diogo; Igrejas, Gilberto; Câmara, Sandra P.

Organoids have been shown to be promising models for drug test as they reasonably preserve tissue structure and functions. However, colonic organoids of pig and monkey are not yet established. Here, we report a culture medium to support the growth of porcine and monkey colonic organoids. Wnt signaling and PGE2 are important for long-term expansion of the organoids, and their withdrawal results in lineage differentiation to mature cells. Furthermore, we observe that porcine colonic organoids are closer to human colonic organoids in terms of drug toxicity response. Successful establishment of porcine and monkey colonic organoids would facilitate the mechanistic investigation of the homeostatic regulation of the intestine of these animals and is useful for drug development and toxicity studies.

By Steven Jonas, New York: Springer Publishing Company, 2003, 233 pp., $36.95 (softcover)",2004,"BACKGROUND: EMERALD is evaluating the efficacy and safety of switching from bPI + FTC/TDF regimens (control) to D/C/F/TAF 800/150/200/10 mg in virologically suppressed, HIV-1-infected adults. We present Week 48 primary results. METHOD: EMERALD (NCT02269917) is a randomized, active-controlled, open-label, international, multicenter, parallel-group, non-inferiority trial. Virologically suppressed (viral load [VL] < 50 c/mL for ≥2 months), HIV-1-infected adults were randomized (2:1) to switch to D/C/F/TAF or continue control. The FDA-stipulated primary endpoint was non-inferiority of D/C/F/TAF vs. control regarding % virologic rebound (confirmed VL ≥ 50 c/mL or premature discontinuations with last VL ≥ 50 c/mL) cumulative through Week 48 (4% margin). RESULT: 1141 patients were randomized and treated (N = 763 D/C/F/TAF; N = 378 control); median age 46; 18% women; 76% white; 58% on >2 previous ARVs (prior to screening regimen); 15% with previous non-DRV virologic failure (VF). Virologic rebound through Week 48 was non-inferior for D/C/F/TAF (2.5%; n = 19) vs. control (2.1%; n = 8) (Δ0.4%, 95% CI: –1.5%; 2.2%; P < 0.001). Most rebounders (12/19 [63%] vs. 4/8 [50%]) resuppressed by Week 48 without change in therapy. Week 48 virologic suppression rates (VL < 50 c/mL; FDA Snapshot) were 94.9% vs. 93.7% (Δ1.2%, 95% CI: −1.7%;4.1%) and VF rates (VL ≥ 50 c/mL; Snapshot) were 0.8% vs. 0.5% (Δ0.3%, 95% CI: −0.7%;1.2%), with no discontinuations for VF. No resistance-associated mutations related to any study drug were observed. Adverse events (AEs) were similar between arms: AE-related discontinuations (1.4% vs. 1.3%); grade 3–4 AEs (6.8% vs. 8.2%); serious AEs (4.6% vs. 4.8%); and no deaths. Renal and bone parameters favored D/C/F/TAF vs. control. TC and LDL-C slightly favored control vs. D/C/F/TAF, with no clinically significant difference in TC/HDL-C ratio between arms (Table 1). CONCLUSION: Percentage of virologic rebound after switching to D/C/F/TAF was non-inferior to control cumulative through Week 48, with high suppression rates (94.9%), no resistance development, better bone and renal safety parameters and similar TC/HDL-C ratio. D/C/F/TAF maintains the high genetic barrier to resistance of darunavir with the safety advantages of TAF, even in patients with a history of non-DRV VF. DISCLOSURES: C.

The risk management problems need to be handled at three levels strategic, operational and tactical. In addition, risk within the supply chain might manifest itself in the form of deviations, disruptions and disasters. To handle unforeseen events in the supply chain there are two obvious approaches: (1) to design chains with built in risk-tolerance and (2) to contain the damage once the undesirable event has occurred. Both of these approaches require a clear understanding of undesirable events that may take place in the supply chain and also the associated consequences and impacts from these events. We focus our efforts on mapping out the propagation of events in the supply chain due to supplier non-performance, and employ our insight to develop a mathematical programming based model for strategic level deviation and disruption management. The first model, a simple integer quadratic optimization model, adapted from the Markowitz model, determines optimal partner selection with the objective of minimizing both the operational cost and the variability of total operational cost. This model offers a possible approach to robust supply chain design.

In a research framework using recent community ecology, evolutionary biology and molecular biology advances, this information can be used to identify potential pathways for future pathogen spill-over initiating the emergence process. In other words, an understanding of the mechanisms of pathogen transmission in a specific ecosystem can provide an interaction network between host populations defined by nodes and edges and characterized by the frequency, intensity and direction of the interactions with a direct input for targeted disease surveillance.","Caron, Alexandre; Morand, Serge; de Garine-Wichatitsky, Michel",New Frontiers of Molecular Epidemiology of Infectious Diseases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121693/,387

Owing to the abnormal expression in cancer and neurodegenerative diseases, the CaMKIV has been considered a potential drug target. In the present study, we checked the binding affinity of plant-derived natural compounds viz., quercetin, ellagic acid (EA), simvastatin, capsaicin, ursolic acid, DL-α-tocopherol acetate, and limonin towards CaMKIV. Molecular docking and fluorescence binding studies showed that EA and quercetin bind to the CaMKIV with a considerable affinity in comparison to other compounds. Enzyme inhibition assay revealed that both EA and quercetin inhibit CaMKIV activity with their IC(50) values in the micromolar range. To get atomistic insights into the mode of interactions, inhibition mechanism, and the stability of the CaMKIV-ligand complex, a 100 ns MD simulation analysis was performed. Both EA and quercetin bind to the catalytically important residues of active site pocket of CaMKIV forming enough stabilizing interactions presumably inhibiting enzyme activity. Moreover, no significant structural change in the CaMKIV was observed upon binding of EA and quercetin. In conclusion, this study illustrates the application of phytoconstituents in the development of therapeutic molecules targeting CaMKIV having implications in cancer and neurodegenerative diseases after in vivo validation.","Gupta, Preeti; Khan, Shama; Fakhar, Zeynab; Hussain, Afzal; Rehman, Md.

The Poisson mixed-effects models (PMM) can be an appropriate choice for repeated count data. However, this model is not realistic because of the restriction that the mean and variance are equal. Therefore, the PMM is replaced by the negative binomial mixed-effects model (NBMM). The later model effectively manages the over-dispersion of the longitudinal data. We evaluate and compare the proposed models and their application to the number of CD4 cells of HIV-Infected patients recruited in the CAPRISA 002 Acute Infection Study. The results display that the NBMM has appropriate properties and outperforms the PMM in terms of handling over-dispersion of the data. Multiple imputation techniques are also used to handle missing values in the dataset to get valid inferences for parameter estimates. In addition, the results imply that the effect of baseline BMI, HAART initiation, baseline viral load, and the number of sexual partners were significantly associated with the patient’s CD4 count in both fitted models. Comparison, discussion, and conclusion of the results of the fitted models complete the study.","Yirga, Ashenafi A.; Melesse, Sileshi F.; Mwambi, Henry G.; Ayele, Dawit G.",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7541535/,387

Locus of control (LOC) is described as a personality trait developed through social learning theory. Recently, LOC has got attention from both the patient’s and clinician’s perspectives. In addition, higher external LOC is associated with problematic Internet use. The aim was to investigate whether problematic Facebook use is associated with LOC. Four hundred twenty-one university students were enrolled in this cross-sectional study. Problematic Facebook use was determined by the Bergen Facebook Addiction Scale, and the participants were divided into two groups as neutral users and problematic users. Locus of control was assessed using the Locus of Control Scale, including subscales of personal control, belief in chance, the meaninglessness of the effortfulness, belief in fate, and belief in an unjust world. RESULTS: In total, 333 students were eligible for the study. There were 66 students with neutral Facebook use (19.8%), and the remaining (n=267) had problematic Facebook use (80.2%). No significant difference was observed in the demographic characteristic of neutral and problematic Facebook users (p>0.05). Problematic Facebook users had significantly higher scores on the meaninglessness of the effortfulness (p<0.001), belief in fate (p=0.019), and belief in an unjust world (p=0.004) compared to the neutral Facebook users. CONCLUSIONS: The results showed that the physiotherapy students having a problematic Facebook had significantly higher scores on the meaninglessness of the effortfulness, belief in fate, and belief in an unjust world compared to neutral Facebook users. All these negative thoughts might be a problem both for students themselves and their future patients.","Salik Sengul, Yesim; Kahraman, Turhan; Ozcan Kahraman, Buse",Bull Fac Phys Ther,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8354783/,387

Couples’ relational wellbeing continues to be impacted by these COVID-19 related stressors. Protecting both personal and relational wellbeing is therefore particularly important at this time. Using a preventative intervention approach, the current paper argues the theoretical benefit of the Positive Massage programme and reports a qualitative analysis of stressed but healthy couples’ experience of engaging in the programme. Thirty-four participants completed 3 weekly classes and home-based practice of massage exchange. Data from an open text online questionnaire completed every week of the programme and again 3 weeks afterwards were analysed using thematic analysis. The identified themes included “holistic stress relief”, “relationship-promotion”, and “selves-care skill”. Couples perceived Positive Massage as an effective mutual support skill to relax and help one another by de-stressing, both emotionally and physically through verbal and nonverbal communication, creating gratitude, deeper connection and self-efficacy via quality time together and pleasurable touch. Theoretically and experientially, Positive Massage can be an effective preventative selves-care skill. Promoting the concept of selves-care and its practical application through Positive Massage would be beneficial for couples’ personal and relational wellbeing in a touch-deprived era.","Naruse, Sayuri M.; Moss, Mark",Eur J Investig Health Psychol Educ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8314375/,387

Here, we found that the transcription factor EGR3, located at chromosome 8p21.3, is a critical metastasis suppressor. Aberrant deletion of EGR3 was found in up to 59.76% (deep deletions, 16.87%; shallow deletions, 42.89%) of prostate cancer patients. In informatics analysis, EGR3 loss was associated with prostate cancer progression and low survival rates. EGR3 expression inversely correlated with the expressions of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and metastasis-related gene sets in prostate cancer tissues. In prostate cancer cells, EGR3 blocked the EMT process and suppressed cell migration and invasion. In a mouse model for cancer metastasis, EGR3 overexpression significantly suppressed bone metastases of PC3 and 22Rv1 prostate cancer cells. Mechanistically, EGR3 transcriptionally activated ZFP36, GADD45B, and SOCS3 genes by directly binding to their promoter regions. The EMT-inhibitory and tumor-suppressive roles of the EGR3 downstream genes were identified through in vitro and in silico analyses. Together, our results showed that EGR3 may be a biomarker to predict clinical outcomes and that it plays an important role in the metastatic progression of prostate cancer.","Shin, Seung-Hyun; Kim, Iljin; Lee, Jae Eun; Lee, Mingyu; Park, Jong-Wan",Oncogene,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41388-020-01418-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32796959/,387

OBJECTIVE To evaluate the effects of ICP monitoring on the mortality of and functional outcomes in patients with severe diffuse TBI. METHODS Data were collected on patients with severe diffuse TBI (Glasgow Coma Scale [GCS] score on admission <9 and Marshall Class II-IV) treated from January 2012 to December 2013 in 24 hospitals (17 level I trauma centers and 7 level II trauma centers) in 9 Chinese provinces. We evaluated the impact of ICP monitoring on 6-month mortality and favorable outcome using propensity score-matched analysis after controlling for independent predictors of these outcomes. RESULTS ICP monitors were inserted into 287 patients (59.5%). After propensity score matching, ICP monitoring significantly decreased 6-month mortality. ICP monitoring also had a greater impact on the most severely injured patients on the basis of head computed tomography data (Marshall computed tomography classification IV) and on patients with the lowest level of consciousness (GCS scores 3-5). After propensity score matching, monitoring remained nonassociated with a 6-month favorable outcome for the overall sample. However, monitoring had a significant impact on the 6-month favorable outcomes of patients with the lowest level of consciousness (GCS scores 3-5). CONCLUSION ICP monitor placement was associated with a significant decrease in 6-month mortality after adjustment for the baseline risk profile and the monitoring propensity of patients with diffuse severe TBI, especially those with GCS scores of 3 to 5 or of Marshall computed tomography classification IV.","Yuan, Qiang; Wu, Xing; Cheng, Hongwei; Yang, Chaohua; Wang, Yuhai; Wang, Ersong; Qiu, Binghui; Fei, Zhimin; Lan, Qing; Wu, Sirong; Jiang, Yunzhao; Feng, Hua; Liu, Jingfang; Liu, Ke; Zhang, Fayun; Jiang, Rongcai; Zhang, Jianmin; Tu, Yue; Wu, Xuehai; Zhou, Liangfu; Hu, Jin",Neurosurgery,https://doi.org/10.1227/neu.0000000000001050; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26891376/,387

The role of P2Y(2)R upregulation in vivo is poorly understood, in part due to the lack of a P2Y(2)R overexpressing animal model. The P2Y(2)R overexpressing transgenic rat was generated using a lentiviral vector. Rats overexpressing P2Y(2)R showed a significant increase in P2Y(2)R mRNA levels in all tissues screened as compared to nontransgenic rats. Fura 2 imaging of smooth muscle cells (SMCs) isolated from aorta indicated that the percentage of cells exhibiting increases in the intracellular free calcium concentration in response to P2Y(2)R agonists was significantly greater in freshly isolated SMCs from transgenic rats than wild-type controls. Histopathological examination of tissues revealed that P2Y(2)R overexpressing rats develop lymphocytic infiltration in lacrimal glands and kidneys as early as at 3 months of age. These rats show similarities to patients with Sjogren's syndrome who display lymphocyte-mediated tissue damage. This transgenic rat model of P2Y(2)R overexpression may prove useful for linking P2Y(2)R upregulation with chronic inflammatory diseases, neurodegenerative diseases and Sjogren's syndrome.","Agca, Cansu; Seye, Cheikh; Kashuba Benson, Corinna M; Rikka, Shivaji; Chan, Anthony W S; Weisman, Gary A; Agca, Yuksel",Journal of vascular research,https://doi.org/10.1159/000194274; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19155635/,387

A study on immediate mental health status of Chinese college students.,2021-03-19,"BACKGROUND The use of retrievable stents for endovascular clot retrieval has dramatically improved successful revascularization and clinical outcome in selected patients with acute stroke. OBJECTIVE To describe the rate and clinical consequences of unwanted spontaneous detachment of these devices during mechanical thrombectomy. METHODS We studied 262 consecutive patients treated with the retrievable stent, Solitaire, for acute ischemic stroke between November 2008 and April 2015. Clinical, procedural, and outcome variables were compared between patients with and without unexpected detachment of this device. Detachment was classified as proximal to the stent proximal marker (type A) or distal to the marker (type B). Poor functional outcome was defined as modified Rankin scale score >2 at 90 days. RESULTS Unwanted detachment occurred in 6/262 (2.3%) cases, four of type A and two of type B. Stent recovery was possible in three patients, all of 'type A', but in none of 'type B'. The number of prior passes was higher in patients with undesired detachment (3 (2-5) vs 2 (1-3), p=0.007). Detachment was associated with higher rate of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (SICH) (33.3% vs 4.3%, p=0.001), poorer outcome (100% vs 54.8%, p=0.028), and higher mortality rate at 90 days (50% vs 17%, p=0.038). CONCLUSIONS Unwanted detachment of a Solitaire is an uncommon complication during mechanical thrombectomy in patients with acute ischemic stroke and is associated with the clot retrieval attempts, SICH, poor outcome, and higher mortality.","Castaño, C; Dorado, L; Remollo, S; García-Bermejo, P; Gomis, M; Pérez de la Ossa, N; Millán, M; García-Sort, M R; Hidalgo, C; López-Cancio, E; Cubells, C; Dávalos, A",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2015-012156; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26819447/,387

Thus, recent work has sought to identify behavioural characteristics that contribute disproportionately to individual variation in pathogen acquisition (super-receiving) or transmission (super-spreading). However, it remains unknown whether the same behaviours enhance both acquisition and transmission, a scenario likely to result in explosive epidemics. Here, we examined this possibility in an ecologically relevant host-pathogen system: house finches and their bacterial pathogen, Mycoplasma gallisepticum, which causes severe conjunctivitis. We examined behaviours likely to influence disease acquisition (feeder use, aggression, social network affiliations) in an observational field study, finding that the time an individual spends on bird feeders best predicted the risk of conjunctivitis. To test whether this behaviour also influences the likelihood of transmitting M. gallisepticum, we experimentally inoculated individuals based on feeding behaviour and tracked epidemics within captive flocks. As predicted, transmission was fastest when birds that spent the most time on feeders initiated the epidemic. Our results suggest that the same behaviour underlies both pathogen acquisition and transmission in this system and potentially others. Identifying individuals that exhibit such behaviours is critical for disease management.","Adelman, James S; Moyers, Sahnzi C; Farine, Damien R; Hawley, Dana M",Proceedings.

65443,"Perspectives: involving persons with lived experience of mental health conditions in service delivery, development and leadership.",2021-05-12,"BACKGROUND Depressive symptoms are a common, debilitating, and costly public health issue. Helicobacter pylori (H pylori) infection cause changes in the normal physiological state of the gastrointestinal (GI) flora. Although the physiological state of the GI tract is closely related to mental disorders, few population studies have examined the relationship between H pylori infection and depressive symptoms in the general population. The aim of this study was to examine whether H pylori infection is related to depressive symptoms among the general adult population. MATERIALS AND METHODS This cross-sectional study included 5558 inhabitants of Tianjin, China. H pylori infection was diagnosed with the carbon 13 breath test. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the Chinese version of 20-item Self-rating Depression Scale (SDS) with three cutoffs (45, 48, and 50) to indicate elevated depressive symptoms. Multiple logistic regression analysis were conducted to assess the association between H pylori infection and depressive symptoms. RESULTS The prevalence of depressive symptoms (SDS ≥ 45) was 12.7% in men and 17.4% in women. In multivariable models, the odds ratios and 95% confidence interval of having depressive symptoms by H pylori infection were 1.25 (1.01-1.56), 1.46 (1.11-1.91), and 1.46 (1.05-2.06) for three cutoffs: 45, 48, and 50 in women. However, no significant difference was found between H pylori infection and depressive symptoms in men. CONCLUSIONS This study firstly suggested that H pylori infection was related to depressive symptoms in women in the general adult population. Further prospective studies or randomized trials are required to clarify the causality.","Gu, Yeqing; Zheng, Lixiao; Kumari, Shubham; Zhang, Qing; Liu, Li; Meng, Ge; Wu, Hongmei; Bao, Xue; Yao, Zhanxin; Sun, Shaomei; Wang, Xing; Zhou, Ming; Jia, Qiyu; Song, Kun; Niu, Kaijun",Helicobacter,https://doi.org/10.1111/hel.12632; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31332918/,387

To provide preliminary evaluation of the safety and suggested efficacy of the MicroFX design, we performed a multicenter prospective single-arm trial, Axium MicroFX for Endovascular Repair of IntraCranial Aneurysm study (AMERICA). METHODS AMERICA is a prospective multicenter 100 aneurysm observational study evaluating the safety and efficacy of Axium MicroFX PGLA coils. Enrollment was started in April 2010 and completed in October 2012. RESULTS 99 patients underwent treatment for 100 aneurysms at 13 centers. Mean age was 60.2 years, most were women (72%) and 18% of patients had previously undergone treatment for a separate aneurysm. 22% of patients underwent treatment after acute aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Of these patients, all were Hunt and Hess grade 1-3. Pre-procedure modified Rankin score (mRS) was 0-2 in 92% of patients. The majority of aneurysms were anterior circulation (86%), with the most common aneurysm locations being the anterior communicating artery (23%) followed by the supraclinoid internal carotid artery and posterior communicating artery (18% each). The mean maximum diameter was 6.5 mm. Axium MicroFX coils could be placed in all but one treatment (99%). Raymond grade at conclusion of coiling was I (complete) in 52%, II (dog ear or residual neck) in 33% and III (residual aneurysm) in 15%. Discharge mRS was significantly worse in patients with SAH (62% mRS 0-2) compared with electively treated aneurysms (mRS 0-2 in 94%, p<001). Major events were uncommon (6% thromboembolic events, 3% intraoperative vessel or aneurysm rupture) and device-related adverse events (AE) were rare (2% of cases). CONCLUSIONS This prospective study of Axium MicroFX coils demonstrates excellent aneurysm occlusion rates. 52% of aneurysms were completely occluded post-procedure. Within the ruptured aneurysm group, post-procedure occlusion rates were 63.6%. Major AE rates were consistent with historical data.","Fargen, Kyle M; Blackburn, Spiros; Carpenter, Jeffrey S; Jabbour, Pascal; Mack, William J; Rai, Ansaar T; Siddiqui, Adnan H; Turner, Raymond D; Mocco, J",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2013-010887; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24026950/,387

One-lung ventilation (OLV) decreases arterial oxygenation; thus oxygen delivery to the brain can be decreased. In this study, we compared phenylephrine and dopamine with respect to maintaining cerebral oxygenation during OLV in major thoracic surgery.Sixty-three patients undergoing lobectomies were randomly assigned to the dopamine (D) or phenylephrine (P) group. The patients' mean arterial pressure was maintained within 20% of baseline by a continuous infusion of dopamine or phenylephrine. Maintenance fluid was kept at 5 mL/kg/h. The depth of anesthesia was maintained with desflurane 1MAC and remifentanil infusion under bispectral index guidance. Regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rScO2) and hemodynamic variables were recorded using near-infrared spectroscopy and esophageal cardiac Doppler.The rScO2 was higher in the D group than the P group during OLV (OLV 60 min: 71 ± 6% vs 63 ± 12%; P = 0.03). The number of patients whose rScO2 dropped more than 20% from baseline was 0 and 6 in the D and P groups, respectively (P = 0.02). The D group showed higher cardiac output, but lower mean arterial pressure than the P group (4.7 ± 1.0 vs 3.9 ± 1.2 L/min; 76.7 ± 8.1 vs 84.5 ± 7.5 mm Hg; P = 0.02, P = 0.02).

Long-term opioid use, however, is associated with several potential adverse effects and toxicities, such as peripheral edema, immune suppression, hyperalgesia, sleep apnea, and changes in endocrine function, many of which are not fully appreciated. Opioid endocrinopathy can greatly affect patients, causing reduced sexual function, decreased libido, infertility, mood disorders, osteoporosis, and osteopenia. Furthermore, although opioid endocrinopathy appears to be common, many patients do not report their symptoms, thus causing this adverse effect to go unnoticed and without clinical monitoring, particularly in patients chronically taking the equivalent of ≥ 100 mg of morphine daily. Indeed, diagnosing hypogonadism as opioid-related can be challenged by other influences on endocrine function, such as pain pathophysiology, comorbidities, other drug therapies, and patient age. Management options for opioid endocrinopathy include discontinuing opioid therapy, reducing the opioid dose, switching to a different opioid, and hormone supplementation.","Brennan, Michael J",The American journal of medicine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amjmed.2012.12.001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23414717/,387

DATA AND METHODS Canadian Community Health Survey-Healthy Aging data (2008/2009) linked to the Canadian Vital Statistics-Death Database were used to estimate the prevalence of social isolation measured objectively (low social participation) and subjectively (feelings of loneliness and weak sense of community belonging). Associations with death during the 8 to 9 year follow-up period were examined with multivariate Cox proportional hazards models controlling for sociodemographic and health-related characteristics. Structural equation models (SEM) examined direct paths with survival time and indirect effects through health status controlling for covariates that were significant in the Cox models. Analyses were stratified by sex. RESULTS An estimated 525,000 people (12%) aged 65 or older felt socially isolated and over 1 million (1,018,000) (24%) reported low participation. In multivariate Cox models, low participation was significantly associated with death for men and women even when the potential confounding effects of subjective isolation, socio-demographic characteristics, health status, and health behaviours were considered. Subjective isolation was not associated with death in final multivariate models for men or women. SEM revealed significant associations between low participation and survival time for men and women. In addition to the direct effects, there were significant indirect effects mediated by health status. There were no direct effects of subjective isolation on survival for men or women, only indirect effects mediated through health status.

METHODS After standard laparoscopic segmental colonic mobilization, a needle-cannula from a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy kit is passed under direct endoscopic vision transparietally into the colon at the site intended for anvil placement. A wire passed through the cannula into the colon is then withdrawn endoscopically per ano. The stapler anvil is fixed to the wire and pulled back along the intestine before being positioned by traction through the needle puncture site. After distal specimen transection, a standard stapled anastomosis is performed. RESULTS The technique is illustrated in 2 patients undergoing laparoscopic sigmoidectomy by either a single port or a multiport procedure with transanal specimen extraction. CONCLUSION By positioning the anvil without colon exteriorization, this technique enables pure intraperitoneal colonic anastomoses that may advance natural orifice operating.","Leroy, Joël; Costantino, Federico; Cahill, Ronan A; Donnatelli, G F; Kawai, M; Hurng Sheng Wu,; Marescaux, Jacques",Surgical innovation,https://doi.org/10.1177/1553350610371335; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20504781/,387

72598,Eating to Cope With the COVID-19 Pandemic and Body Weight Change in Young Adults.,2020-12-04,"Gene-environment interaction (GxE) determines the vulnerability of an individual to a spectrum of stress-related neuropsychiatric disorders. Increased impulsivity, excessive aggression, and other behavioural characteristics are associated with variants within the tryptophan hydroxylase-2 (Tph2) gene, a key enzyme in brain serotonin synthesis. This phenotype is recapitulated in naïve mice with complete, but not with partial Tph2 inactivation. Tph2 haploinsufficiency in animals reflects allelic variation of Tph2 facilitating the elucidation of respective GxE mechanisms. Recently, we showed excessive aggression and altered serotonin brain metabolism in heterozygous Tph2-deficient male mice (Tph2+/-) after predator stress exposure. Here, we sought to extend these studies by investigating aggressive and anxiety-like behaviours, sociability, and the brain metabolism of dopamine and noradrenaline. Separately, Tph2+/- mice were examined for exploration activity in a novel environment and for the potentiation of helplessness in the modified swim test (ModFST). Predation stress procedure increased measures of aggression, dominancy, and suppressed sociability in Tph2+/- mice, which was the opposite of that observed in control mice. Anxiety-like behaviour was unaltered in the mutants and elevated in controls. Tph2+/- mice exposed to environmental novelty or to the ModFST exhibited increased novelty exploration and no increase in floating behaviour compared to controls, which is suggestive of resilience to stress and despair. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) revealed significant genotype-dependent differences in the metabolism of dopamine, and norepinephrine within the brain tissue. In conclusion, environmentally challenged Tph2+/- mice exhibit behaviours that resemble the behaviour of non-stressed null mutants, which reveals how GxE interaction studies can unmask latent genetically determined predispositions.","Strekalova, Tatyana; Svirin, Evgeniy; Waider, Jonas; Gorlova, Anna; Cespuglio, Raymond; Kalueff, Allan; Pomytkin, Igor; Schmitt-Boehrer, Angelika G; Lesch, Klaus-Peter; Anthony, Daniel",Progress in neuro-psychopharmacology & biological psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pnpbp.2020.110155; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33127424/,387

In this case report, we described the experience of successful treatment of a patient with severe asthmatic status due to Yokkaichi asthma. A 40s-year-old man, who was officially certified as a patient with Yokkaichi asthma from his infancy, was admitted to hospital due to acute exacerbation of asthma. Mechanical ventilation, intravenous administration of aminophylline and dexamethasone, enteral administration of montelukast, and a transdermal patch of tulobuterol were started. However, because of the lack of improvement in clinical status, inhalation of procaterol using vibrating mesh nebulizer systems was started. Inhalation of procaterol was used three times a day. After using the vibrating mesh nebulizer, respiratory system compliance and hypercapnia rapidly improved. Bilateral expiratory wheezing was diminished. Weaning from mechanical ventilation was initiated, and on the eighth day of mechanical ventilation, the patient was extubated. Although intractable respiratory failure with decreased respiratory system compliance resulting from the late effects of air pollution and a long-time asthmatic inflammatory condition was observed, the use of a vibrating mesh nebulizer for the inhaled administration of procaterol was useful to relieve severe bronchospasm due to Yokkaichi asthma.","Yano, Takeshi; Yonaha, Tetsu; Hidaka, Koutaro; Nagahama, Masumi; Koshida, Tomohiro; Matsuoka, Hiroshi; Taniguchi, Masahiko; Tsuneyoshi, Isao",Respiratory medicine case reports,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rmcr.2016.08.002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27547723/,387

Here, we examined the therapeutic effects of increased levels of IL-10 at early times after infection by engineering a recombinant J2.2 virus to produce IL-10. We demonstrate that viral expression of IL-10, which occurs during the peak of virus replication and at the site of disease, enhanced survival and diminished morbidity in rJ2.2-infected wild-type B6 and IL-10(-/-) mice. The protective effects of increased IL-10 levels were associated with reductions in microglial activation, inflammatory cell infiltration into the brain, and proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine production. Additionally, IL-10 increased both the frequency and number of Foxp3(+) regulatory CD4 T cells in the infected central nervous system. Most strikingly, the ameliorating effects of IL-10 produced during the first 5 days after infection were long acting, resulting in decreased demyelination during the resolution phase of the infection. Collectively, these results suggest that the pathogenic processes that result in demyelination are initiated early during infection and that they can be diminished by exogenous IL-10 delivered soon after disease onset. IL-10 functions by dampening the innate or very early T cell immune response. Further, they suggest that early treatment with IL-10 may be useful adjunct therapy in some types of viral encephalitis.","Trandem, Kathryn; Jin, Qiushuang; Weiss, Kayla A; James, Britnie R; Zhao, Jingxian; Perlman, Stanley",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00510-11; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21593179/,387

METHODS This was a pilot, double-blinded, randomized controlled study (phase IIa). Intermittent inhalations of nitric oxide 160 ppm for 30 min or oxygen/air (control) were given 5 times/day to hospitalized infants (2-11 months) with acute bronchiolitis. Oxygen saturation, methemoglobin, and nitric dioxide (NO2 ) levels and vital signs were monitored. RESULTS Forty-three infants were enrolled. Baseline characteristics were comparable in both study groups. Mean clinical score, comprised of four components: respiratory rate, use of accessory muscles, wheezes and crackles, and % room-air oxygen saturation, was 7.86 (±1.1) and 8.09 (±1.2) in the NO and control groups, respectively, consistent with moderate severity. The overall frequency of adverse events was similar between the groups. Repeated nitric oxide inhalations did not result in increased inhaled NO2 levels or cumulative effect on methemoglobin levels. Secondary outcomes of efficacy were measured by length of hospitalization (LOS) in hours: LOS did not differ between groups. However, in a post-hoc analysis of a subgroup of infants hospitalized for >24 h (n = 24), the median LOS was shorter in the nitric oxide (41.9 h) than in the control group (62.5 h) (P = 0.014). CONCLUSION Our study was unable to detect a difference in side effects using intermittent high-dose nitric-oxide inhalation or supportive treatment alone, in infants with moderate bronchiolitis.

79009,Addressing the critical need for long-term mental health data during the COVID-19 pandemic: Changes in mental health from April to September 2020.,2021-02-26,"Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have made an indelible mark in the field of cancer immunotherapy. Starting with the approval of anti-cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (anti-CTLA-4) for advanced-stage melanoma in 2011, ICIs-which now also include antibodies against programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) and its ligand (PD-L1)-quickly gained US Food and Drug Administration approval for the treatment of a wide array of cancer types, demonstrating unprecedented extension of patient survival. However, despite the success of ICIs, resistance to these agents restricts the number of patients able to achieve durable responses, and immune-related adverse events complicate treatment. Thus, a better understanding of the requirements for an effective and safe antitumor immune response following ICI therapy is needed. Studies of both tumoral and systemic changes in the immune system following ICI therapy have yielded insight into the basis for both efficacy and resistance. Ultimately, by building on these insights, researchers should be able to combine ICIs with other agents, or design new immunotherapies, to achieve broader and more durable efficacy as well as greater safety. Here, we review the history and clinical utility of ICIs, the mechanisms of resistance to therapy, and local and systemic immune cell changes associated with outcome.

An extensive simulation was carried out to investigate the performance of this technique for small and medium sample sizes, using both summary and individual data. The results show that the performance depends on the model validity but is not heavily dependent on the sample size.

We aimed to describe the impact of COVID-19 on children's health, wellbeing, and access to medical care in Portugal. MATERIAL AND METHODS We conducted a cross-sectional study through an anonymous online survey via social media. The collected data refers to a period between the 16th of March and the 17th of May 2020. RESULTS We obtained responses to the survey on 19 745 children. Of the previously scheduled outpatient consultations, 54.2% were postponed by healthcare institutions and 21.6% of planned vaccinations were missed. Parents expressed concerns regarding psychological, social, and physical consequences for their children due to the pandemic. DISCUSSION The observed reduction of pediatric emergency department visits and the postponement of outpatient consultations and vaccine administrations are potentially harmful for non-COVID patients. The current pandemic and the imposed social distance might have an important negative impact on the mental health of children. CONCLUSION Further studies are necessary to fully comprehend the outcomes of the decreased access to medical care, as well as the collateral damage for children beyond the clinical aspects of the pandemic. Defining strategies regarding the urge to vaccinate children and not postpone urgent evaluations should be a public health priority.","Poppe, Mariana; Aguiar, Bárbara; Sousa, Rodrigo; Oom, Paulo",Acta medica portuguesa,https://doi.org/10.20344/amp.14805; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33775275/,387
81557,The Digital Mental Health Genie Is Out of the Bottle.,2020-06-24,"This study aimed to identify biomarkers of major depressive disorder (MDD), by relating neuroimage-derived measures to binary (MDD/control), ordinal (severe MDD/mild MDD/control), or continuous (depression severity) outcomes. To address MDD heterogeneity, factors (severity of psychic depression, motivation, anxiety, psychosis, and sleep disturbance) were also used as outcomes. A multisite, multimodal imaging (diffusion MRI [dMRI] and structural MRI [sMRI]) cohort (52 controls and 147 MDD patients) and several modeling techniques-penalized logistic regression, random forest, and support vector machine (SVM)-were used. An additional cohort (25 controls and 83 MDD patients) was used for validation. The optimally performing classifier (SVM) had a 26.0% misclassification rate (binary), 52.2 ± 1.69% accuracy (ordinal) and r = .36 correlation coefficient (p < .001, continuous). Using SVM, R2 values for prediction of any MDD factors were <10%. Binary classification in the external data set resulted in 87.95% sensitivity and 32.00% specificity. Though observed classification rates are too low for clinical utility, four image-based features contributed to accuracy across all models and analyses-two dMRI-based measures (average fractional anisotropy in the right cuneus and left insula) and two sMRI-based measures (asymmetry in the volume of the pars triangularis and the cerebellum) and may serve as a priori regions for future analyses. The poor accuracy of classification and predictive results found here reflects current equivocal findings and sheds light on challenges of using these modalities for MDD biomarker identification. Further, this study suggests a paradigm (e.g., multiple classifier evaluation with external validation) for future studies to avoid nongeneralizable results.","Yang, Jie; Zhang, Mengru; Ahn, Hongshik; Zhang, Qing; Jin, Tony B; Li, Ien; Nemesure, Matthew; Joshi, Nandita; Jiang, Haoran; Miller, Jeffrey M; Ogden, Robert Todd; Petkova, Eva; Milak, Matthew S; Sublette, Mary Elizabeth; Sullivan, Gregory M; Trivedi, Madhukar H; Weissman, Myrna; McGrath, Patrick J; Fava, Maurizio; Kurian, Benji T; Pizzagalli, Diego A; Cooper, Crystal M; McInnis, Melvin; Oquendo, Maria A; Mann, Joseph John; Parsey, Ramin V; DeLorenzo, Christine",Human brain mapping,https://doi.org/10.1002/hbm.24282; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30113112/,387

METHODS Systematic review of observational studies, searching MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Web of Science, PsycARTICLES and SCOPUS for case-control and cohort studies. We included studies on depression and various indications unspecified (including off-label use) reporting risk of suicide and/or suicide attempt for adult patients using selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) and other new-generation antidepressants relative to non-users. Effects were meta-analytically aggregated with random-effects models, reporting relative risk (RR) estimates with 95% CIs. Publication bias was assessed via funnel-plot asymmetry and trim-and-fill method. Financial conflict of interest (fCOI) was defined present when lead authors' professorship was industry-sponsored, they received industry-payments, or when the study was industry-sponsored. RESULTS We included 27 studies, 19 on depression and 8 on various indications unspecified (n=1.45 million subjects). SSRI were not definitely related to suicide risk (suicide and suicide attempt combined) in depression (RR=1.03, 0.70-1.51) and all indications (RR=1.19, 0.88-1.60). Any new-generation antidepressant was associated with higher suicide risk in depression (RR=1.29, 1.06-1.57) and all indications (RR=1.45, 1.23-1.70). Studies with fCOI reported significantly lower risk estimates than studies without fCOI. Funnel-plots were asymmetrical and imputation of missing studies with trim-and-fill method produced considerably higher risk estimates. CONCLUSIONS Exposure to new-generation antidepressants is associated with higher suicide risk in adult routine-care patients with depression and other treatment indications. Publication bias and fCOI likely contribute to systematic underestimation of risk in the published literature.

J Strength Cond Res XX(X): 000-000, 2019-We investigated muscle strength and sprint performance after combining running exercise (RE) with blood flow restriction (BFR). Twelve male sprinters received 2 experimental warm-ups: (a) RE (50% heart rate reserve, 2 minutes × 5 sets, 1-minute rest interval) with BFR (occlusion pressure: 1.3 × resting systolic blood pressure) warm-up, namely RE-BFR; and (b) RE without BFR warm-up, namely RE. Isokinetic strength or 60-m sprint performance was assessed after a 5-minute recovery from each experimental warm-up. All subjects completed 4 exercise trials in a counterbalanced order: (a) RE-BFR-strength; (b) RE-strength; (c) RE-BFR-sprint; and (d) RE-sprint. Muscle activation (during RE), blood lactate (BLa) (pre- and post-REs), heart rate (HR), and rating of perceived exertion (RPE) (pre- and post-REs and at a 5-minute recovery) were determined during each experimental warm-up. The isokinetic knee flexor strength and the hamstring-quadriceps (H:Q) ratio observed for the RE-BFR warm-up were significantly higher than those observed for the RE warm-up (p < 0.05). However, no differences (p > 0.05) in the isokinetic knee extensor strength and 60-m sprint performance were observed between the 2 warm-ups. Running exercise-BFR warm-up induced a higher level of vastus lateralis and biceps femoris muscle activation than did RE warm-up (p < 0.05). Furthermore, RE-BFR warm-up induced higher HR, RPE, and BLa values than did RE warm-up after RE and at a 5-minute recovery (p < 0.05). These results suggest that RE-BFR warm-up may augment physiological responses and improve the H:Q ratio and isokinetic knee flexor strength. Thus, RE-BFR warm-up may be considered a practical warm-up strategy for promoting muscle strength and reducing the risk of hamstring injury in male sprinters.","Chen, Yun-Tsung; Hsieh, Yao-Yi; Ho, Jen-Yu; Lin, Jung-Charng",Journal of strength and conditioning research,https://doi.org/10.1519/jsc.0000000000003313; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31453935/,387
82842,Exploring the potential of civic engagement to strengthen mental health systems in Indonesia (IGNITE): a study protocol.,2018,"BACKGROUND Synthetic vascular material use, particularly PTFE-based, can be associated with bleeding, which may increase operative time and blood loss. None of the commercially available sealants designed to ensure hemostasis combine bioresorption, high viscosity, hydrophobicity, and compliance with the underlying tissue and on-demand activation. METHODS AND OBJECTIVES A study was designed to assess the biocompatibility and in-vivo performance and bioresorption of a new synthetic on-demand light-activated poly (glycerol sebacate) acrylate (PGSA) based SETALIUMTM VASCULAR SEALANT in three large animal studies of open vascular carotid and aortic surgery. The pre-clinical results were then translated into a clinical setting in a prospective, single-arm multicenter study in patients requiring carotid endarterectomy using an ePTFE patch. RESULTS The biocompatibility testing showed that the PGSA-based SETALIUMTM VASCULAR SEALANT did not induce any significant toxic reaction at a standard clinical dose nor at doses up to 40 times the equivalent intended clinical dose. The PGSA-based sealant was shown to be non-pyrogenic, non-sensitizing, non-irritant, non-clastogenic, and non-mutagenic. The animal studies showed excellent performance and safety results, with clinically significant hemostasis achieved in 100% of the animals in both carotid and aorta studies and excellent local tolerance. Histopathology and morphometric analyses showed surface-based gradual and sustained bioresorption of the PGSA-based sealant up to 86% at 12 months. In the clinical study, the application of the PGSA-based sealant resulted in good performance and safety, with immediate hemostasis achieved in 84% of the cases and no adverse event related to the sealant reported through the 1-year follow-up. CONCLUSIONS The new synthetic on-demand light activated PGSA-based SETALIUMTM VASCULAR SEALANT investigated in our studies demonstrated good biocompatibility, sustained and gradual surface based bioresorption, and acceptable safety profile in animal studies. In addition, the first in-human use showed that the sealant is a safe and effective alternative to achieve fast and controlled hemostasis in vascular carotid reconstructions. A larger randomized controlled study will allow further validation of these encouraging preliminary results.","Pellenc, Quentin; Touma, Joseph; Coscas, Raphael; Edorh, Grégoire; Pereira, Maria; Karp, Jeffrey; Castier, Yves; Desgranges, Pascal; Alsac, Jean Marc",The Journal of cardiovascular surgery,https://doi.org/10.23736/s0021-9509.19.10783-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31089086/,387
83267,Why US Health Care Should Think Globally.,2016,"For complex Wigner-type matrices, i.e. Hermitian random matrices with independent, not necessarily identically distributed entries above the diagonal, we show that at any cusp singularity of the limiting eigenvalue distribution the local eigenvalue statistics are universal and form a Pearcey process. Since the density of states typically exhibits only square root or cubic root cusp singularities, our work complements previous results on the bulk and edge universality and it thus completes the resolution of the Wigner-Dyson-Mehta universality conjecture for the last remaining universality type in the complex Hermitian class. Our analysis holds not only for exact cusps, but approximate cusps as well, where an extended Pearcey process emerges. As a main technical ingredient we prove an optimal local law at the cusp for both symmetry classes. This result is also the key input in the companion paper (Cipolloni et al. in Pure Appl Anal, 2018. arXiv:1811.04055) where the cusp universality for real symmetric Wigner-type matrices is proven. The novel cusp fluctuation mechanism is also essential for the recent results on the spectral radius of non-Hermitian random matrices (Alt et al. in Spectral radius of random matrices with independent entries, 2019. arXiv:1907.13631), and the non-Hermitian edge universality (Cipolloni et al. in Edge universality for non-Hermitian random matrices, 2019. arXiv:1908.00969).","Erdős, László; Krüger, Torben; Schröder, Dominik",Communications in mathematical physics,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00220-019-03657-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32831359/,387

Nevertheless, ancient DNA characterization of Formative Period archaeological human remains is particularly scant, especially for Northwest Argentina. To expand current information on genetic characterization of the first agricultural communities of the southern Calchaquí Valleys, we present and discuss the first mitochondrial ancient DNA information obtained on samples dated to ca. 3,600-1,900 years before present from the Cajón Valley, Catamarca Province. Reproducible mtDNA hypervariable region 1 (HVR-1) sequences were obtained in seven individuals. Mitochondrial HVR-1 haplotypes were assigned to three of the four founding haplogroups, D1 (57.1%), C1 (28.5%), and B2 (14.2%), with absence of A2. Our results show that the Cajón Valley sample, with predominance of D1 and C1, differs from that commonly observed in ancient and modern Andean populations, which usually show a high prevalence of haplogroup B2. The fact that the Cajón Valley and Pampa Grande (Salta Province, Argentina) share a prevalence of haplogroup D1 could provide additional evidence to support possible genetic affinities between the valleys and the eastern sub-Andean region during the Formative Period in Northwest Argentina, expanding the archaeological evidence of contact between both populations. Future complete mitogenomic analysis will provide substantial information to formulate new hypotheses about the origins and phylogenetic relationships between the individuals of the Cajón Valley and other groups from the Andes, Gran Chaco, and the Amazon.","Parolin, María Laura; Cortés, Leticia Inés; Basso, Néstor; Scattolin, María Cristina",Human biology,https://doi.org/10.13110/humanbiology.91.4.02; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32767894/,387

The aim of this study was to quantify recent trends in public interest and related online search behavior for a range of imaging modalities, and ""nowcast"" future scenarios with respect to imaging use. METHODS We used Google Trends, a publicly available database to access search query data in systematic and quantitative fashion, to search for key terms related to clinical imaging. We queried the search volume for multiple imaging modalities, identified the most common terms, extracted data for the United States over the time range from August 1, 2016 to August 1, 2020. Results were given in relative terms, using the Google metric 'search volume index'. RESULTS We report a decrease in public interest across all imaging modalities since March 2020 with a subsequent slow increase starting in May 2020. Mean relative search volume (RSV) has changed by -19.4%, -38.3%, and -51.0% for the search terms ""Computed tomography"", ""Magnetic resonance imaging"", and ""Mammography"", respectively, and comparing the two months prior to and following March 1, 2020. RSV has since steadily recuperated reaching all-year highs. CONCLUSION Decrease in public interest coupled with delays and deferrals of diagnostic imaging will likely result in a high demand for healthcare in the coming months. To respond to this challenge, measures such as risk-stratification algorithms must be developed to allocate resources and avoid the risk of overstraining the healthcare system.","Adelhoefer, Siegfried; Henry, Travis S; Blankstein, Ron; Graham, Garth; Blaha, Michael J; Dzaye, Omar",Clinical imaging,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clinimag.2020.11.037; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33260013/,387

92618,Corrigendum.,2015,"During interphase of the eukaryotic cell cycle, the microtubule (MT) cytoskeleton serves as both a supportive scaffold for organelles and an arborized system of tracks for intracellular transport. At the onset of mitosis, the position of the astral MT network, specifically its center, determines the eventual location of the spindle apparatus and ultimately the cytokinetic furrow. Positioning of the MT aster often results in its movement to the center of a cell, even in large blastomeres hundreds of microns in diameter. This translocation requires positioning forces, yet how these forces are generated and then integrated within cells of varied sizes and geometries remains an open question. Here we describe a method that combines microfluidics, hydrogels, and Xenopus laevis egg extract to investigate the mechanics of aster movement and centration. We determined that asters were able to find the center of artificial channels and annular cylinders, even when cytoplasmic dynein-dependent pulling mechanisms were inhibited. Characterization of aster movement away from V-shaped hydrogel barriers provided additional evidence for a MT-based pushing mechanism. Importantly, the distance over which this mechanism seemed to operate was longer than that predicted by radial aster growth models, agreeing with recent models of a more complex MT network architecture within the aster.

We aimed to develop and evaluate a fluorescent destination marker (FDM), composed of a resected omental appendix injected with indocyanine green (ICG), for real-time navigation in laparoscopic surgery for colorectal cancer in this pilot study. METHODS This study included ten patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer. To prepare FDMs, we laparoscopically harvested omental appendices attached to the colon we planned to resect. The harvested appendices were injected with diluted ICG, and a gauze tag was attached. The FDMs were placed at target intra-abdominal sites with a ligation clip. RESULTS Patient diagnoses included 1 cecal, 2 ascending colon, 3 transverse colon, 2 sigmoid colon, and 2 rectal cancers. No conversion to open surgery was required and no intraoperative complications occurred. We created 12 sets of FDMs, which were placed at a total of 13 sites in abdominal cavities. FDM fluorescence was successfully detected in all cases. Furthermore, FDMs could be detected earlier than the gauze tags at 12 points, and they were detected at the same time at 1 point. CONCLUSIONS All FDMs facilitated laparoscopic surgery by allowing the surgeon to find the tissue to be dissected, particularly in procedures that required the dissection of lymph nodes around middle colic vessels and mobilization of the splenic flexure. FDMs showed potential for guiding the laparoscopic surgeon to a target anatomical destination. This marker represents a contribution to the evolution of real-time navigation surgery.","Hamabe, Atsushi; Ogino, Takayuki; Tanida, Tsukasa; Noura, Shingo; Morita, Shunji; Dono, Keizo",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-018-6504-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30341652/,387

RESULTS All procedures were successfully performed without the need for supplemental trocars. Postoperative pathological examinations were supportive of the preoperative diagnoses. No complications such as perioperative hemorrhage or infections occurred. CONCLUSION SILH appears to be a safe approach and the results are cosmetically favorable. The accumulation of SILH experience and the development of instrumentation are needed for extensive use of this technique in hepatectomies.","Pan, Mingxin; Jiang, Zesheng; Cheng, Yuan; Xu, Xiaoping; Zhang, Zhi; Zhou, Chenjie; He, Guolin; Xu, Tingcheng; Liu, Hanyan; Gao, Yi",Surgical innovation,https://doi.org/10.1177/1553350612438412; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22474017/,387

Trastuzumab could be active as second-line chemotherapy for taxane/trastuzumab-naïve patients with epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2)-positive advanced gastric cancer. Patients aged ≥20 years with HER2-positive, previously treated (except for trastuzumab and taxane), unresectable or recurrent gastric adenocarcinoma underwent combined trastuzumab (first and subsequent doses of 8 and 6 mg kg-1 , respectively, every 3 weeks) and paclitaxel (days 1, 8, 15, every 4 weeks) treatment. Study endpoints were best overall response, progression-free survival, overall survival, and safety. From September 2011 to March 2012, 47 Japanese patients were enrolled. Forty patients discontinued treatment after a median of 128.5 (range 4-486) days. Complete and partial responses were obtained in one and 16 patients (response rate of 37% [95% CI 23-52]), respectively. Median progression-free survival and overall survival were 5.1 (95% CI 3.8-6.5) and 17.1 (95% CI 13.5-18.6) months, respectively. Grade 3/4 adverse events were neutropenia (32.6%), leukopenia (17.4%), anemia (15.2%) and hypoalbuminemia (8.7%). There was no clinically significant cardiotoxicity or cumulative toxicity. Three (disturbed consciousness, pulmonary fibrosis, and rapid disease progression) grade 5 events occurred. In conclusion, trastuzumab combined with paclitaxel was well tolerated and was a promising regimen for patients with HER2-positive, previously treated, advanced or recurrent gastric cancer.","Nishikawa, Kazuhiro; Takahashi, Tsunehiro; Takaishi, Hiromasa; Miki, Akira; Noshiro, Hirokazu; Yoshikawa, Takaki; Nishida, Yasunori; Iwasa, Satoru; Miwa, Hiroto; Masuishi, Toshiki; Boku, Narikazu; Yamada, Yasuhide; Kodera, Yasuhiro; Yoshida, Kazuhiro; Morita, Satoshi; Sakamoto, Junichi; Saji, Shigetoyo; Kitagawa, Yuko",International journal of cancer,https://doi.org/10.1002/ijc.30383; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27521503/,387
96874,Measuring productivity of healthcare services under environmental constraints: evidence from China.,2020-07-22,"BACKGROUND Previous studies suggest that pathways reducing oxidative stress may have a protective effect against adverse cardiac responses associated with ambient PM. However, few studies have directly assessed total antioxidant capacity (TAC) as a potential effect modifier of cardiac responses to increased ambient PM. OBJECTIVES We examined if TAC modifies the association between ambient PM and markers of heart rate variability (HRV), repolarization, systemic inflammation, and systolic blood pressure (SBP) in post-infarction patients. METHODS We recruited 76 patients with a recent coronary event (myocardial infarction or unstable angina) who participated in a cardiac rehabilitation program from June 2006 to November 2009 in Rochester, New York. Ambient fine particle (PM2.5,≤2.5µm in aerodynamic diameter), accumulation mode particle (AMP, 100-500nm) and ultrafine particle (UFP, 10-100nm) concentrations were measured continuously by fixed-site monitors. Markers of HRV and repolarization were measured by continuous Holter electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings before and during exercise sessions of the rehabilitation program. Blood pressure was measured and venous blood samples were collected before exercise to measure TAC and inflammation markers. We applied linear mixed models to assess changes in markers of HRV, repolarization, systemic inflammation, and SBP associated with increased PM concentrations in the low, medium and high TAC tertile groups, after adjusting for covariates including temperature, calendar time since the beginning of the study, visit number, month of year, and hour of day. RESULTS Based on subject-visits with available TAC, we observed increases in SBP, C-reactive protein, and fibrinogen, and decreases in rMSSD (square root of the mean of the sum of the squared differences between adjacent normal to normal intervals) and SDNN (standard deviation of normal to normal beat intervals) associated with increased PM2.5, AMP and UFP in the previous 6-120h (e.g. change in SBP associated with each interquartile range (IQR) increase in PM2.5 lagged 0-5h was 1.27mmHg [95%CI: 0.09, 2.46mmHg]). However, we did not observe a consistent pattern of effect measure modification by TAC for any combination of pollutant and outcome (e.g. changes in SBP associated with each IQR increase in PM2.5 lagged 0-5h for the low, medium and high TAC tertile groups were 1.93mmHg [95%CI: 0.23, 3.63 mmHg], -0.31 mmHg [95%CI: -2.62, 2.01 mmHg], and 1.29mmHg [95%CI: -0.64, 3.21 mmHg], respectively. P for interaction=0.28).

While women's representation in health-related sciences has increased substantially, women remain underrepresented in senior leadership roles. This study was conducted to elucidate influences at the individual, interpersonal, organizational, and societal levels that present as barriers to and facilitators for advancement in research careers for women, with the goal of promoting and retaining a more diverse leadership. METHOD The authors conducted individual, 1-hour, in-depth, semistructured interviews with 15 female early stage investigators pursuing careers in health sciences research at a large minority-serving institution in Florida in 2018. Interview guides were designed by using a social ecological framework in order to understand the influence of multilevel systems. Employing a qualitative approach, drawing from a phenomenological orientation, 2 researchers independently coded transcripts and synthesized codes into broad themes. RESULTS Barriers and facilitators were reported at all ecological levels explored. Illustrative quotations reflect the unequal distribution of familial responsibilities that compete with career advancement, family members' lack of understanding of the demands of a research career, the importance of female mentors, perceived differences in the roles and expectations of female and male faculty at institutions, and normative upheld values that influence early career progression. CONCLUSIONS Achieving pervasive and sustained changes that move toward gender equity in research requires solutions that address multilevel, explicit and implicit influences on women's advancement in science. Suggestions include shifting familial and institutional norms, creating support systems for women with female mentors, and enforcing consistent policies regarding the roles and expectations of faculty. Findings shed light on the influence of gender on career progression by providing context for the experiences of women and underscore the importance of addressing pervasive societal and structural systems that maintain inequities hindering women's progress in the scientific workforce.","Fernandez, Sofia B; Clarke, Rachel D; Sheehan, Diana M; Trepka, Mary Jo; Rose, Suzanna M",Academic medicine : journal of the Association of American Medical Colleges,https://doi.org/10.1097/acm.0000000000003902; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33369901/,387
98519,Evaluation of radically open dialectical behaviour therapy in an adult community mental health team: effectiveness in people with autism spectrum disorders.,2020-12-02,"INTRODUCTION Screening and correcting reversible causes of cardiac arrest (CA) are an essential part of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Point-of-care (POC) laboratory analyses are used for screening pre-arrest pathologies, such as electrolyte disorders and acid-base balance disturbances. The aims of this study were to compare the intraosseous (IO), arterial and central venous POC values during CA and CPR and to see how the CPR values reflect the pre-arrest state. METHODS We performed an experimental study on 23 anaesthetised pigs. After induction of ventricular fibrillation (VF), we obtained POC samples from the IO space, artery and central vein simultaneously at three consecutive time points. We observed the development of the values during CA and CPR and compared the CPR values to the pre-arrest values. RESULTS The IO, arterial and venous values changed differently from one another during the course of CA and CPR. Base excess and pH decreased in the venous and IO samples during untreated VF, but in the arterial samples, this only occurred after the onset of CPR. The IO, arterial and venous potassium values were higher during CPR compared to the pre-arrest arterial values (mean elevations 4.4 mmol/l (SD 0.72), 3.3 mmol/l (0.78) and 2.8 mmol/l (0.94), respectively). CONCLUSIONS A dynamic change occurs in the common laboratory values during CA and CPR. POC analyses of lactate, pH, sodium and calcium within IO samples are not different from analyses of arterial or venous blood. Potassium values in IO, arterial and venous samples during CPR are higher than the pre-arrest arterial values.","Jousi, Milla; Skrifvars, Markus B; Nelskylä, Annika; Ristagno, Giuseppe; Schramko, Alexey; Nurmi, Jouni",Resuscitation,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.resuscitation.2019.02.014; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30796917/,387

99454,No evidence of over-reporting of SARS in mainland China.,2009,"Nowadays, there is an increasing demand for more accessible routine diagnostics for patients with respect to high accuracy, ease of use, and low cost. However, the quantitative and high accuracy bioassays in large hospitals and laboratories usually require trained technicians and equipment that is both bulky and expensive. In addition, the multistep bioassays and long turnaround time could severely affect the disease surveillance and control especially in pandemics such as influenza and COVID-19. In view of this, a portable, quantitative bioassay device will be valuable in regions with scarce medical resources and help relieve burden on local healthcare systems. Herein, we introduce the MagiCoil diagnostic device, an inexpensive, portable, quantitative, and rapid bioassay platform based on the magnetic particle spectrometer (MPS) technique. MPS detects the dynamic magnetic responses of magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) and uses the harmonics from oscillating MNPs as metrics for sensitive and quantitative bioassays. This device does not require trained technicians to operate and employs a fully automatic, one-step, and wash-free assay with a user friendly smartphone interface. Using a streptavidin-biotin binding system as a model, we show that the detection limit of the current portable device for streptavidin is 64 nM (equal to 5.12 pmole). In addition, this MPS technique is very versatile and allows for the detection of different diseases just by changing the surface modifications on MNPs. Although MPS-based bioassays show high sensitivities as reported in many literatures, at the current stage, this portable device faces insufficient sensitivity and needs further improvements. It is foreseen that this kind of portable device can transform the multistep, laboratory-based bioassays to one-step field testing in nonclinical settings such as schools, homes, offices, etc.","Wu, Kai; Chugh, Vinit Kumar; di Girolamo, Arturo; Liu, Jinming; Saha, Renata; Su, Diqing; Krishna, Venkatramana D; Nair, Abilash; Davies, Will; Wang, Yongqiang Andrew; Cheeran, Maxim C-J; Wang, Jian-Ping",ACS applied materials & interfaces,https://doi.org/10.1021/acsami.0c21040; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33566573/,387

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The risk assessment tool identified patients with progressive neurology and stratified need for surgery against risk of harm during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS Using our risk stratification tool, 6.6% patients required expedited surgery and a further 11.4% patients were removed completely from the waiting list. The majority of patients 47%, required surgery within 3 months. CONCLUSIONS This simple tool encourages surgical departments to establish contact with patients during COVID-19. The clinician acquires up-to-date information regarding patient symptomatology and subsequently determines surgical priority, a timescale required for surgery and overall uses of NHS resources efficiently.

Thus, this study aimed to evaluate hematological and biochemical parameters in adult residents in a coal mining region in the largest national reserve in Brazil, as well as to investigate their relations with air quality. The study included three cities in the south of Brazil, which are located near an important power plant and coal mine. The air quality was analyzed by PM10, NOx, and SO2 at five air quality monitoring stations, socioeconomic and demographic characteristics were evaluated with a questionnaire, and biochemical parameters were assessed in blood samples. The mean PM10 in the study area was 19.18 μg/m3. The air quality varied among the five monitoring stations, and the Candiota station exceeded the reference limit by 63.3%. In general, participants had lived more than 10 years in the municipality and had hepatic and renal parameters within the reference values. A higher prevalence of alterations was found in hematological parameters (43.1%) and liver function (30%).

METHODS Patients with anterior circulation stroke and premorbid modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score 0-3 who underwent thrombectomy within 24 hours after stroke onset were included. Primary outcome measure was good clinical outcome defined as 90-day mRS score 0-2 or clinical recovery to the status before stroke onset (ie, equal premorbid mRS and 90-day mRS). Secondary outcome measures were successful reperfusion, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale at discharge, and mRS shift. RESULTS In total, 360 patients were included in this study, of whom 111 patients (30.8%) were in the mothership group, 204 patients (56.7%) were in the DS group, and 45 patients (12.5%) were in the DD group. Good clinical outcome was achieved similarly in all three groups (mothership, 45.9%; DS, 43.1%; DD, 40.0%; P=0.778). Likewise, frequency of successful reperfusion was similar in all three groups (mothership, 86.5%; DS, 85.3%; DD, 82.2%; P=0.714). There was no significant difference among the groups regarding the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale at discharge (P=0.115) and mRS shift (P=0.342). In the multivariate analysis, triage concept was not an independent predictor of good outcome (unadjusted odds ratio, 0.89 [CI, 0.64-1.23]; P=0.479).

However, thromboembolic events (TEs) continue to be the major complications during the periprocedural phase. To evaluate the safety and efficacy of the prophylactic use of tirofiban, combined with the conventional dual antiplatelet therapy (DAT), as a new antiplatelet protocol in patients with intracranial aneurysms treated with FDs. METHODS At least 3-5 days before the procedure, daily DAT were administrated to the patients. Tirofiban was administered as an intravenous bolus (5 µg/kg) over a 3 min period during or immediately after FD deployment, followed by a 0.05 µg/kg/min maintenance infusion for 24-48 hours. Periprocedural TEs and hemorrhagic events (HEs) were recorded. RESULTS A total of 331 patients were included, including 229 (69.2%) who received tirofiban administration (tirofiban group) and 102 (30.8%) who received only DAT (non-tirofiban group). Periprocedural TEs occurred in 12 (3.6%) patients, including eight (7.8%) in the non-tirofiban group and four (1.7%) in the tirofiban group. In multivariate analysis, patients receiving tirofiban administration had significantly lower TEs as compared with those who received only DAT (P=0.004). Balloon angioplasty and longer procedure time (>137 min) were also risk factors for TEs. Also, no increase was observed in the rate of HEs related to tirofiban administration. CONCLUSIONS The current study suggested that prophylactic administration of tirofiban combined with conventional oral DAT seems safe and efficient for preventing TEs during FD treatment of unruptured intracranial aneurysms. Balloon angioplasty and prolonged procedure are associated with a high risk of TEs.","Wu, Qiaowei; Shao, Qiuji; Li, Li; Liang, Xiaodong; Chang, Kaitao; Li, Tianxiao; He, Yingkun",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2020-016878; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33199539/,387

108093,Assessing Stress in Pregnancy and Postpartum: Comparing Measures.,2020-07-20,"STUDY DESIGN A retrospective review. OBJECTIVES To evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of the triple layer closure technique to establish watertight sealing without diversion of lumbar drainage, in preventing persistent incidental subarachnoid-pleural fistula and other neurological complications related to excessive drainage of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) after dural defect in transthoracic ossified posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) surgery. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA CSF leakage into the pleural cavity leads to unfavorable conditions for natural healing of incidental durotomy due to the negative pressure environment of the pleural space and lack of wound healing around the bony cavity near the decompressed spinal cord. This often leads to a persistent incidental subarachnoid-pleural fistula. In addition, diversion of lumbar drainage may lead to excessive CSF drainage resulting in intracranial hypotension. To avoid this, we studied the efficacy of a modified sealing method to establish a more watertight covering at the ventral dural defect without lumbar CSF drainage. METHODS Fifty-three patients who had CSF leakage from the ventral aspect of the spinal cord during transthoracic spine surgery for thoracic OPLL between 2004 and 2013 were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were divided into 2 groups: a conventional group (group A) and a triple layer closure group (group B). In group A (n=33 patients), the dural defect was covered with fibrin glue (Beriplast P) mixed with gelfoam (Spongostan Standard) with subsequent subarachnoid lumbar drainage. In group B (n=20 patients), the dural defect was sealed using the triple layer technique with 2 layers of fibrin glue and gelatin sponge plus a third layer of synthetic hydrogel (Duraseal, Dural Sealant System) without subsequent subarachnoid lumbar drainage. Both groups had chest tubes that drained through an underwater seal. Clinical data including duration and total amount of drainage (chest tube and lumbar drainage), related complications, and duration of hospital stay were compared between the 2 groups. RESULTS Compared with the patients in group A, group B had a significantly smaller total volume of drainage and shorter chest tube drainage time (P<0.05) during their hospital stay. In group A, complications occurred in 6 cases (18.2%), including 3 cases of intracranial hypotension combined with transient mental status alteration, postural headache, and dizziness, 1 case of regional atelectasis with pneumonia, and 2 cases of revision thoracotomy. Revision thoracotomy was performed to treat persistent subarachnoid-pleural fistula due to significant and prolonged CSF leakage. In group B, there were no complications and no revision thoracotomy was needed. The mean duration of hospital stay was shorter in group B (15.6 d) compared with group A (22.4 d). CONCLUSIONS The established watertight closure of the dural defect using the triple layer sealing method without lumbar drainage was more effective and safe.","Jeon, Sang-Hyeop; Lee, Sang-Ho; Tsang, Yi Sheng; Jung, Tag-Geun; Moon, Ki-Hyoung; Choi, Gun; Dilip, Ketan D",Clinical spine surgery,https://doi.org/10.1097/bsd.0000000000000249; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28632556/,387

Many newborns are hypothermic on admission despite using polyethylene bags (PBs). Using exothermic mattresses (EMs) in addition to PBs may reduce hypothermia but increase hyperthermia. We wished to determine whether placing preterm newborns in PBs on EMs in the DR results in more infants with rectal temperature outside the range 36.5 to 37.5°C on NICU admission. METHODS Infants <31 weeks were randomly assigned before birth to treatment with or without an EM. All infants were placed in a PB and under radiant heat immediately after birth and brought to NICU in a transport incubator. Infants randomly assigned to EM were placed on a mattress immediately after delivery and remained on it until admission. Randomization was stratified by gestational age. Rectal temperature was measured with a digital thermometer on NICU admission. RESULTS The data safety monitoring committee recommended stopping for efficacy after analyzing data from half the planned sample. We report data for 72 infants enrolled at this time. Fewer infants in PBs on EMs had temperatures within the target range (15/37 [41%] vs 27/35 [77%], P = .002) and more had temperatures >37.5°C (17/37 [46%] vs 6/35 [17%], P = .009). CONCLUSIONS In very preterm newborns, using EMs in addition to PBs in the DR resulted in more infants with temperatures outside the normal range and more hyperthermia on NICU admission.","McCarthy, Lisa K; Molloy, Eleanor J; Twomey, Anne R; Murphy, John F A; O'Donnell, Colm P F",Pediatrics,https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2013-0279; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23776115/,387
109079,Pandemic's Mental Health Toll Grows.,2020-09-22,"OBJECTIVE To determine the association between serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D [25(OH)D] levels and acute respiratory tract infections (ALRTI) in newborns. STUDY DESIGN The study group consisted of 30 term newborns with ALRTI who were admitted to our neonatal intensive care unit. Controls were 30 healthy newborns with the same age as the study group. Newborns and their mothers were tested for serum 25(OH)D levels, with a low level defined as ≤15 ng/mL. RESULTS The groups were similar in gestational week, birthweight, postnatal age and gender. Forty-three of the 60 infants (including study and control) had low 25(OH)D levels. The median 25(OH)D levels were lower [9.5 ng/mL (IQR = 7.9-12.2)] in the study group than those of the control group [15.5 ng/mL (IQR: 12-18)] (p = 0.0001). The median serum 25(OH)D levels in the mothers of the study group were also lower than those in the mothers of the control group [11.6 ng/mL (IQR = 9.4-15.8) and 17.3 ng/mL (IQR = 13.7-20.6), respectively] (p = 0.0001). CONCLUSION Lower blood 25(OH)D levels might be associated with increased risk of ALRTI in term newborn babies. Appropriate vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy and early childhood may enhance newborns' respiratory health.","Dinlen, Nurdan; Zenciroglu, Aysegul; Beken, Serdar; Dursun, Arzu; Dilli, Dilek; Okumus, Nurullah","The journal of maternal-fetal & neonatal medicine : the official journal of the European Association of Perinatal Medicine, the Federation of Asia and Oceania Perinatal Societies, the International Society of Perinatal Obstetricians",https://doi.org/10.3109/14767058.2015.1023710; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25786473/,387

Therefore, to investigate the function of the DPV US3 protein, we used scarless Red recombination technology based on an infectious bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) containing the DPV Chinese virulent strain (CHv) genome and successfully constructed and rescued a US3-deleted mutant and the corresponding revertant virus (BAC-CHv-ΔUS3 and BAC-CHv-ΔUS3R, respectively). For viral growth characteristics, compared to the parental and revertant viruses, the US3-deleted mutant showed an approximately 100-fold reduction in viral titers but no significant reduction in genome copies, indicating that the US3-deleted mutant exhibited decreased viral replication but not decreased viral DNA generation. In addition, the US3-deleted mutant formed viral plaques that were 33% smaller on average than those formed by the parental and revertant viruses, demonstrating that US3 protein affected the viral cell-to-cell spread of DPV. Finally, the results of electron microscopy showed that the deletion of US3 resulted in a large number of virions accumulating in the nucleus and perinuclear space, thus blocking virion nuclear egress. In this study, we found that the DPV US3 protein played pivotal roles in viral replication by promoting viral cell-to-cell spread and virion nuclear egress, which may provide some references for research on the function of the DPV US3 protein.","Deng, Liyao; Wang, Mingshu; Cheng, Anchun; Yang, Qiao; Wu, Ying; Jia, Renyong; Chen, Shun; Zhu, Dekang; Liu, Mafeng; Zhao, Xinxin; Zhang, Shaqiu; Huang, Juan; Ou, Xumin; Mao, Sai; Zhang, Ling; Liu, Yunya; Yu, Yanling; Tian, Bin; Pan, Leichang; Rehman, Mujeeb Ur; Chen, Xiaoyue",Scientific reports,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-64190-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32346128/,387

In this review, we focus on the current understanding of host cell nuclear proteins whose translocation from the nucleus to cytoplasm is induced and utilized by viruses to support viral replication and infection. Utilization of nuclear proteins for viral replication and infection involves disruption of nuclear import, enhancement of nuclear export, removal of nuclear localization signal (NLS) from nuclear proteins and alteration of nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) to cooperatively support viral replication. Understanding of nucleo-cytoplasmic transport system, and associated mechanisms, utilized by viruses will advance therapeutic development of strategies to produce optimal antiviral agents effective in control of viral diseases.","Meng, Wen; Wang, Xiao-Jia; Wang, Hwa-Chain Robert",Critical reviews in microbiology,https://doi.org/10.1080/1040841x.2018.1553848; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30663919/,387

METHODS Retrospective observational study of 81 consecutive patients admitted with Covid-19 respiratory infection who underwent MDCT for clinical suspicion of PTE (sudden dyspnea, chest pain, hemoptysis, severe respiratory failure (SRF) not corrected with high O2 flow) and/or raised D-dimer. RESULTS Of the 81 patients studied [64 (79.01%) men], acute PTE was identified in 22 (27.16%), bilaterally in 13 (59.09%), and 13 (59,09%) showed areas of hypoperfusion. Of the 59 (72.83%) patients without PTE, hypoperfusion was observed in 41 (69.49%) (attributable in one case to pulmonary emphysema). In 18 (22.2%) of the total number of patients, neither PTE nor hypoperfusion were seen. A crazy paving pattern is a risk factor for developing PTE (OR 1.94; 95% CI 0.28-13.57), as are consolidations (OR 1.44; 95% CI 0.24-8.48) and septal thickening/bronchiectasis (OR 1.47; 95% CI 0.12-17.81). Patients with O2-refractory SRF showed a 6.36-fold higher risk for hypoperfusion on the iodine map. CONCLUSION By adding the functional image to the anatomical image, pulmonary angiography with MDCT and iodine mapping can demonstrate not only PTE in main, lobar and segmental arteries, but also the presence of hypoperfusion in distal vessels. This makes it a highly useful tool for the accurate diagnosis and therapeutic orientation of patients with Covid-19 lung involvement.","Pérez Dueñas, Virginia; Allona Krauel, María; Agrela Rojas, Emilio; Ramírez Prieto, Maria Teresa; Díez Izquierdo, Laura; López de la Guardia, Ulpiano; Torres Sánchez, Isabel",Archivos de bronconeumologia,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.arbres.2020.07.031; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32962806/,387

The interaction was initially established with native proteins by co-immunoprecipitating PUUV nucleocapsid (N) protein with the glycoprotein complex. Mapping of the interaction sites revealed that the N protein has multiple binding sites in the cytoplasmic tail (CT) of Gn and is also able to bind to the predicted CT of Gc. The importance of Gn- and Gc-CTs to the recognition of RNP was further verified in pull-down assays using soluble peptides with binding capacity to both recombinant N protein and the RNPs of PUUV and Tula virus. Additionally, the N protein of PUUV was demonstrated to interact with peptides of Gn and Gc from a variety of hantavirus species, suggesting a conserved RNP-recognition mechanism within the genus. Based on these and our previous results, we suggest that the complete hetero-oligomeric (Gn-Gc)(4) spike complex of hantaviruses mediates the packaging of RNP into virions.","Hepojoki, J; Strandin, T; Wang, H; Vapalahti, O; Vaheri, A; Lankinen, H",The Journal of general virology,https://doi.org/10.1099/vir.0.021006-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20444994/,387

Known as edge-vial-effect, vials at the corners and edges tend to run warmer than center vials during primary drying. This is associated with risk of collapse or increased costs due to use of more conservative, longer drying conditions resulting in lower product temperature. The edge-vial-effect has been attributed to radiation coming from the chamber wall. We could show that the neighbor vial has a dominant impact on product temperature during lyophilization. Depending on the number of neighbors as well as the distance to a neighbor vial, the neighbor vial exerts a remarkable cooling effect. Energy transfer by gas conduction enables the cooling effect of a neighboring vial over a distance up to 10 mm. This not only leads to prolonged primary drying but also impacts cake appearance. Thus, to avoid trouble during lyophilization you have to watch out for the neighborhood.","Daller, Sarah; Schroeder, Rudolf; Friess, Wolfgang",Journal of pharmaceutical sciences,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.xphs.2020.10.024; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33069707/,387

Each fluorophore has a characteristic fluorescence decay, known as the fluorescence lifetime, that occurs throughout a nanosecond-to-millisecond timescale. The measurement of fluorescence lifetime as a reporter for biological activity is less common than fluorescence intensity, even though the latter has numerous issues that can lead to false-positive readouts. The confirmation of hit compounds as true inhibitors requires additional assays, cost, and time to progress from hit identification to lead drug-candidate optimization. To explore whether the use of fluorescence lifetime technology (FLT) can offer comparable benefits to label-free-based approaches such as RapidFire mass spectroscopy (RF-MS) and a superior readout compared to time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer (TR-FRET), three equivalent assays were developed against the clinically validated tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2) and screened against annotated compound sets. FLT provided a marked decrease in the number of false-positive hits when compared to TR-FRET. Further cellular screening confirmed that a number of potential inhibitors directly interacted with TYK2 and inhibited the downstream phosphorylation of the signal transducer and activator of transcription 4 protein (STAT4).","Greenhough, Luke A; Clarke, Gabriella; Phillipou, Alexander N; Mazani, Faith; Karamshi, Bhumika; Rowe, Sam; Rowland, Paul; Messenger, Cassie; Haslam, Carl P; Bingham, Ryan P; Craggs, Peter D",SLAS discovery : advancing life sciences R & D,https://doi.org/10.1177/24725552211002472; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33783261/,387

For this critical review, dietary interventions recommended by the Expert Committee for the treatment of pediatric overweight/obesity were categorized according to their potential degree of dietary structure, and their impact on weight outcomes was described. Four levels of dietary structure were reviewed, operationalized as alterations to the following: food groups, such as fruits and vegetables (low structure); daily eating occasions, such as meals (moderate structure); large nutrients, such as energy (high structure); and energy plus additional dietary alterations (very high structure). In total, 24 interventions (four low, three moderate, five high, and 12 very high structure structure) were identified and reviewed. Reductions in standardized body mass index increased with increasing structure, and interventions ≥6 months had better outcomes than interventions <6 months.

OBJECTIVE To summarize neurosurgical applications of ML where it has been compared to clinical expertise, here referred to as ""natural intelligence."" METHODS A systematic search was performed in the PubMed and Embase databases as of August 2016 to review all studies comparing the performance of various ML approaches with that of clinical experts in neurosurgical literature. RESULTS Twenty-three studies were identified that used ML algorithms for diagnosis, presurgical planning, or outcome prediction in neurosurgical patients. Compared to clinical experts, ML models demonstrated a median absolute improvement in accuracy and area under the receiver operating curve of 13% (interquartile range 4-21%) and 0.14 (interquartile range 0.07-0.21), respectively. In 29 (58%) of the 50 outcome measures for which a P-value was provided or calculated, ML models outperformed clinical experts (P < .05). In 18 of 50 (36%), no difference was seen between ML and expert performance (P > .05), while in 3 of 50 (6%) clinical experts outperformed ML models (P < .05). All 4 studies that compared clinicians assisted by ML models vs clinicians alone demonstrated a better performance in the first group. CONCLUSION We conclude that ML models have the potential to augment the decision-making capacity of clinicians in neurosurgical applications; however, significant hurdles remain associated with creating, validating, and deploying ML models in the clinical setting. Shifting from the preconceptions of a human-vs-machine to a human-and-machine paradigm could be essential to overcome these hurdles.","Senders, Joeky T; Arnaout, Omar; Karhade, Aditya V; Dasenbrock, Hormuzdiyar H; Gormley, William B; Broekman, Marike L; Smith, Timothy R",Neurosurgery,https://doi.org/10.1093/neuros/nyx384; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28945910/,387

Indeed, the world has been facing an un-preceded situation in the past couple of months following COVID-19 infestation and the associated high-mortality rates mainly attributed to sepsis and the associated multiple organ failures of particular concern; acute respiratory distress syndrome post lung injury. The current study provides evidence on the ameliorative impact of nifuroxazide, and FDA approved antidiarrheal drug in attenuation of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI and myocarditis when administrated either in prophylactic or curative regimens. Nifuroxazide administration was associated with a significant improvement in lung and heart histopathological characteristics and architecture with retraction of LPS-induced inflammatory-infiltration. This was associated with retraction in serum biomarkers of cellular injury of which; LDH, CK-MB, and ALP. Nifuroxazide administration was associated with a significant improvement in both lung and heart oxidative status. Such positive outcomes were underlined by a significant inhibitory effect of nifuroxazide on lung and heart contents of toll-like receptor (4) (TLR4)/the inflammasome NALPR3/interleukin- 1β (IL-1β).

Methods: An electronic literature search using PubMed was conducted to identify relevant research studies published between December 2019 and August 2020. Twenty-five studies were selected out of 1,041 studies based on inclusion and exclusion criteria, which highlight patients' satisfaction and experience with the use of telemedicine during the pandemic. Results: The findings based upon 48,144 surveyed patients and 146 providers in 12 different countries revealed high satisfaction with virtual encounters across a spectrum of diseases. Telemedicine was found satisfactory on various outcome measures, such as addressing patients' concerns, communication with health care providers, usefulness, and reliability. Most common advantages were time saved due to lesser traveling and waiting time, better accessibility, convenience, and cost efficiency. Age and sex did not significantly impact the satisfaction levels. Physicians and patients both showed a strong preference for continued usage and agreed upon telemedicine's potential to complement the regular health care services even after the pandemic. Technical challenges (reported in 10 studies) and lack of physical examination (reported in 13 studies) were the main limitations encountered in virtual visits. Conclusion: Long-term sustainability of telemedicine for all socioeconomic classes requires closer scrutiny of issues such as technology, training, reimbursement, data privacy, legal guidelines, and framework. Telemedicine must be adopted as a proactive strategy and scaled-up even beyond emergency usage due to its immense potential in complementing conventional health care services, such as diagnosis, treatment, follow-up, surveillance, and infection control.","Nanda, Mehak; Sharma, Rajesh",Telemedicine journal and e-health : the official journal of the American Telemedicine Association,https://doi.org/10.1089/tmj.2020.0570; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33719577/,387

Our objectives were to evaluate the immunogenicity of an influenza vaccine in 37 HIV-infected patients (HIV group) compared to 29 uninfected individuals (control group) and to carry out a clinical and virological surveillance of influenza during a 6-month follow-up. Both groups received the vaccine recommended for the southern hemisphere in 2008. Antibody responses to antigens H1N1, H3N2, and B were measured in blood samples at vaccination (T0) and after 1 month (T1). Influenza surveillance was performed by weekly telephone calls for a follow-up period of 6 months. Nasal washes were taken from subjects with respiratory symptoms. The direct immunofluorescence assay in house polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and real-time PCR were used for the detection of different respiratory viruses. The median age of the participants was 13.3 years (sd = 2.2) and 12.1 years (sd = 1.3) for the HIV group and control group, respectively. One month after vaccination (T1), both groups showed significant increases in the antibody geometric mean titers (GMTs) for all antigens. However, healthy controls showed higher values for antigens A/H1N1 and A/H3N2 (p = 0.002 and 0.001, respectively). There was a higher increase in the percentage of HIV-uninfected subjects with protective A/H1N1 antibodies (96.6%) compared to HIV-infected vaccinees (67.6%) at T1 (p = 0.004).

During the study, we observed a 68 kDa protein with fibrinolytic activity. In this study, we cloned the gene (vprSJ4) encoding the 68 kDa protein, a mature Vpr, a minor protease secreted by Bacillus species. vprSJ4 encodes a preproenzyme consisting of 810 amino acids (aa) including signal sequence (28 aa) and prosequence (132 aa). The mature enzyme (650 aa) has a predicted molecular weight of 68,467.35. Unlike Vprs from other B. subtilis strains, VprSJ4 has 4 additional amino acids (DEFA) at the C-terminus. vprSJ4 was overexpressed in Escherichia coli. PreproVprSJ4 was localized in inclusion bodies, and subjected to in vitro renaturation and purification by an affinity column. SDS-PAGE and western blot showed that autoprocessing of preproVprSJ4 occurred and 68 kDa and smaller proteins were produced. The optimum pH and temperature of the recombinant VprSJ4 was pH 7.0 and 40°C, respectively. Kinetic parameters of recombinant VprSJ4 were measured by using an artificial substrate, N-succinyl-ala-ala-pro-phe-p-nitroanilide.

PATIENTS AND METHODS From January 25, 2020 to March 9, 2020, 5 COVID-19 patients with negative respiratory tract nucleic acid and positive fecal nucleic acid were observed and studied to explore whether these patients can re-infect themselves. Five patients with COVID-19 accompanied by diarrhea as the main gastrointestinal symptoms were carefully observed through clinical symptoms, imaging and other auxiliary examinations. The RT-PCR technology was used to continuously detect fecal and respiratory viral nucleic acids. The IgM antibody was detected on the 7th day of admission and IgM/IgG at the time of discharge. RESULTS All 5 patients had symptoms of fever and diarrhea upon admission. The fecal nucleic acid was positive, as well as the throat swab was positive. All COVID-19 patients had positive IgM antibodies on the 7th day of admission and positive IgM and IgG at the time of discharge, and there were no abnormalities in the gastrointestinal examination on discharge. All 5 fecal nucleic acid tests were positive at the time of discharge. After continuous dynamic follow-up for 3-15 days, no clinical symptoms recurred, and the last nucleic acid test was negative.

120426,Generating Political Priority for Primary Health Care Reform in Romania.,2021-07-01,"Suicide is one of the leading causes of death among adolescents in the United States, and risk for recurring suicidal thoughts and behavior remains high after discharge from psychiatric hospitals. Safety planning, a brief intervention wherein the main focus is on identifying personal coping strategies and resources to mitigate suicidal crises, is a recommended best practice approach for intervening with individuals at risk for suicide. However, anecdotal as well as emerging empirical evidence indicate that adolescents at risk for suicide often do not use their safety plan during the high-risk postdischarge period. Thus, to be maximally effective, we argue that safety planning should be augmented with additional strategies for increasing safety plan use to prevent recurrent crises during high-risk transitions. The current article describes an adjunctive intervention for adolescents at elevated suicide risk that enhances safety planning with motivational interviewing (MI) strategies, with the goal of increasing adolescents' motivation and strengthening self-efficacy for safety plan use after discharge. We provide an overview of the intervention and its components, focusing the discussion on the in-person individual and family sessions delivered during hospitalization, and describe the theoretical basis for the MI-enhanced intervention. We then provide examples of applying MI during the process of safety planning, including example strategies that aim to elicit motivation and strengthen self-efficacy for safety plan use. We conclude with clinical case material and highlight how these strategies may be incorporated into the safety planning session.

The actual delivered chemotherapy dose received by patients can be influenced by dose reductions and treatment delays often due to toxicities, most commonly chemotherapy-induced neutropenia (CIN). AREAS COVERED We review seminal evidence and more recent studies that have shown an association between higher RDI and improved patient survival. A smaller number of studies have shown no association between RDI and outcomes. These differences may be due to study limitations, including low power, differences in patient and disease characteristics, or the chemotherapeutic regimen. We explain guidelines recommendations to prevent and treat CIN with granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) and describe novel approaches to prevent neutropenia that are being developed that may provide greater value and be associated with fewer adverse events than standard G-CSF options. EXPERT OPINION Maintaining RDI is important to ensure optimal patient outcomes. This can be achieved through the proper administration of G-CSF prophylaxis and treatment. Newer agents in development to treat and/or prevent CIN are entering regulatory review and may potentially change the treatment landscape for CIN in the future.","Shayne, Michelle; Harvey, R Donald; Lyman, Gary H",Expert review of anticancer therapy,https://doi.org/10.1080/14737140.2021.1941891; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34114525/,387

It is associated with several perioperative benefits compared with total gastrectomy. The use of laparoscopic proximal gastrectomy (LPG) has become an increasingly popular approach for select tumors. METHODS We describe our method of LPG, including the preoperative work-up, illustrated depictions of the key steps of the surgery, and our postoperative pathway. RESULTS A total of 6 patients underwent LPG between July, 2013 to June, 2017. Five patients had early-stage adenocarcinoma, and 1 patient had a gastrointestinal stromal tumor. The median age of the cohort was 70, and each patient had significant comorbidities. Conversion to open was required for 1 patient. All patients had negative final margins and an adequate lymph node dissection (median number of nodes examined was 15, range 12-22). The median postoperative length of stay was 7 days (range 4-7). Two patients developed anastomotic strictures requiring intervention, and 1 patient experienced significant reflux. At a median follow-up of 11 months, there was 1 recurrence. Three patients were alive without evidence of disease, and 2 patients died from other causes. CONCLUSIONS For carefully selected patients, LPG is a safe and reasonable alternative to total gastrectomy, which is associated with similar oncologic outcomes and low morbidity.","Kukar, Moshim; Gabriel, Emmanuel; Ben-David, Kfir; Hochwald, Steven N",Journal of surgical oncology,https://doi.org/10.1002/jso.25123; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29920681/,387

Methods of detection and the role for cattle persistently infected bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) were identified; viral subunits, cellular components and bacterial products have been characterized. Product advances have included vaccines for bovine respiratory syncytial virus, Mannheimia haemolytica and Pasteurella multocida; the addition of BVDV2 to the existing vaccines and new antibiotics. The role of Mycoplasma spp., particularly Mycoplasma bovis in BRD, has been more extensively studied. Bovine immunology research has provided more specific information on immune responses, T cell subsets and cytokines.

This trial sought to determine the efficacy of ropivacaine wound infusion following laparoscopic colonic surgery. METHODS Forty-eight consecutive patients undergoing elective laparoscopic colorectal resection were randomized to receive either a local anaesthetic wound infusion (ropivacaine 0.5%) or normal saline for a period of 72 h. The primary endpoint was postoperative pain as assessed by analgesic consumption, while secondary endpoints assessed were visual analogue pain scores, respiratory function, gastrointestinal function, length of stay and postoperative complications. RESULTS There was no difference in mean postoperative analgesic consumption between the two groups over 72 h (143 mEq morphine control vs 94 mEq intervention; p = 0.108). Likewise, there was no difference in daily postoperative analgesic consumption or visual analogue pain scores between the two groups. Patients in the ropivacaine group experienced less reduction in their postoperative forced expiratory volume at 1 s on day 1 (mean difference FEV1 0.4 l; p = 0.015). There was no difference between the two groups with respect to return of gut function and postoperative complications. CONCLUSIONS In this study, local anaesthetic wound infusion with ropivacaine following elective laparoscopic colorectal surgery improves early respiratory function, but does not appear to provide an improvement in postoperative analgesia or other clinically relevant postoperative outcomes.","Moore, S E; Reid, K C; Draganic, B D; Smith, S R",Techniques in coloproctology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10151-012-0845-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22956204/,387

But modern epidemics are both more and less than the diffusion of viral entities. We argue that epidemics are 'fire objects', using a term coined by Law and Singleton: They generate locative fears through encounters that focus attention on entities that are unknown or imprecisely known, transforming spaces and humans into indeterminate dangers, alternating appearance and absence. The Ebola epidemic of 2014 had more complex impacts than the number of infections would suggest. We employ multi-sited qualitative interviews to argue that locative fear is the essence of modern global epidemics. In the discussion we contrast Ebola with both the Zika epidemic that followed and the ongoing coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.","Shrum, Wesley; Aggrey, John; Campos, Andre; Pamplona da Costa, Janaina; Joseph, Jan; Kreimer, Pablo; Kroeger, Rhiannon; Rodriguez Medina, Leandro; Miller, Paige; Palackal, Antony; Pandal de la Peza, Ana; Traore, Abou",Social studies of science,https://doi.org/10.1177/0306312720927781; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32597319/,387

It was noticed that Aspergillus terreus, Aspergillus flavus, and Aspergillus fumigatus induced variable toxic potential that was cell type, secondary metabolite type, and concentration dependent. Human colonic adenocarcinoma cells (Caco-2) showed less sensitivity than hepatocyte-derived cellular carcinoma cells (HuH-7), and in turn, the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) was variable. Also, the apoptotic potential of Aspergillus species-derived fungal secondary metabolites was proven via detection of up-regulated pro-apoptotic genes and down-regulation of anti-apoptotic genes. The expression level was cell type dependent. Concurrently, apoptotic profile was accompanied with cellular DNA accumulation at the G2/M phase, as well as an elevation in Pre-G1 phase but not during G0/G1 and S phases. Also, there were characteristic apoptotic features of treated cells presented as abnormal intra-nuclear eosinophilic structures, dead cells with mixed euchromatin and heterochromatin, ruptured cell membranes, apoptotic cells with irregular cellular and nuclear membranes, as well as peripheral chromatin condensation.

This study sought to examine the associations of daily average temperature (AT) and relative humidity (ARH) with the percent increase in COVID-19 cases. Methods: Daily confirmed cases and meteorological factors in 38 districts of India were collected between 1st April 2020 to 30th April 2020. Taking a 5-day time lag of average values of the variables and multiple days-samples, we ran multiple models and performed appropriate hypothesis tests to decide the single preferred model for each sample data. Suitable fixed effects (FE) and random effects (RE) models with cluster-robust standard errors were applied to quantify the district-specific associations of meteorological and other variables with COVID-19 cases. Results: All FE models revealed that every one-degree rise in AT led to a decrease in 3.909 points (on average) in percent increase in COVID-19 cases. All RE models showed that with one unit increase in the malaria annual parasite index, there was a significant increase in 10.835 points (on average) in percent increase in COVID-19 cases. In both FE and RE models, ARH was found to be negatively associated with a percent increase in COVID-19 cases, although in half of these models the association was statistically insignificant. Conclusion: Our results indicate that mean temperature, mean relative humidity, and malaria endemicity might have an essential role in the stability and transmissibility of the 2019 novel coronavirus.","Panigrahi, Ansuman; Mohapatra, Ipsa; Kanyari, S Suneeti; Maharana, Sabita; Panigrahi, Madhulita",Archives of environmental & occupational health,https://doi.org/10.1080/19338244.2021.1910117; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33840381/,387

The required analysis of uncertainty is often unfeasible due to the high computational demand. We combine two possible solution strategies: a) the use of faster surrogate models, and b) a robust data worth analysis combining quick first-order second-moment uncertainty quantification with null-space Monte Carlo techniques to account for parametric uncertainty. A structurally and parametrically simplified model and a proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) surrogate are investigated. Data worth estimations by both surrogates are compared against estimates by a complex MODFLOW benchmark model of an aquifer in New Zealand. Data worth is defined as the change in post-calibration predictive uncertainty of groundwater head, river-groundwater exchange flux and drain flux data, compared to the calibrated model. It incorporates existing observations, potential new measurements of system states (""additional"" data) as well as knowledge of model parameters (""parametric"" data). The data worth analysis is extended to account for non-uniqueness of model parameters by null-space Monte Carlo sampling. Data worth estimates of the surrogates and the benchmark suggest good agreement for both surrogates in estimating worth of existing data. The structural simplification surrogate only partially reproduces the worth of ""additional"" data and is unable to estimate ""parametric"" data, while the POD model is in agreement with the complex benchmark for both ""additional"" and ""parametric"" data. The variance of the POD data worth estimates suggests the need to account for parameter non-uniqueness, like presented here, for robust results.","Gosses, Moritz; Wöhling, Thomas",Ground water,https://doi.org/10.1111/gwat.13098; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33763867/,387

The secondary aim was to assess if the albumin gradient (ALBg) is a reliable criterion for differentiating exudates from transudates in patients with pleural effusion thought to be transudative by clinical criteria but identified as exudative by Light's criteria. Nineteen client-owned cats with pleural effusion were studied. The aetiology of the pleural effusion was used to establish the pathophysiology of its formation. Parameters measured or calculated undergoing statistical analysis included Light's criteria, total protein and total nucleated cell count in the pleural effusions, and the ALBg. Based on the pathophysiology of fluid formation there were seven transudates caused by increased hydrostatic pressure and 12 exudates. There was a significant difference in the accuracy of the Light's criteria in correctly classifying origin of the pleural fluid formation compared with the traditional veterinary classification (84% vs 53%). ALBg values were significantly different between transudates and exudates. One of the three transudates misclassified as exudates by Light's criteria was correctly identified as a transudate by the ALBg. In conclusion, pleural effusion should be classified as either a transudate or an exudate using Light's criteria. In cats with pleural effusion thought to be transudative by clinical criteria, but identified as exudative by Light's criteria, the ALBg may further help in correctly differentiating exudates from transudates.","Zoia, Andrea; Drigo, Michele",Journal of feline medicine and surgery,https://doi.org/10.1177/1098612x15592170; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26116619/,387

However, increased soluble IgD (sIgD) levels and increased IgD+IgM- B-cell populations have been described in the human upper respiratory mucosa. OBJECTIVE We assessed whether levels of sIgD and IgD+ B cell counts are altered in nasal tissue from patients with chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS). We further characterized IgD+ B-cell populations and explored clinical and local inflammatory factors associated with tissue sIgD levels. METHODS sIgD levels were measured by means of ELISA in nasal tissues, nasal lavage fluid, sera, and supernatants of dissociated nasal tissues. IgD+ cells were identified by using immunofluorescence and flow cytometry. Inflammatory mediator levels in tissues were assessed by using real-time PCR and multiplex immunoassays. Bacterial cultures from the middle meatus were performed. Underlying medical history and medicine use were obtained from medical records. RESULTS sIgD levels and numbers of IgD+ cells were significantly increased in uncinate tissue (UT) of patients with chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyps (CRSsNP) compared with that of control subjects (4-fold, P < .05). IgD+ cells were densely scattered in the periglandular regions of UT from patients with CRSsNP. We also found that IgD+CD19+CD38bright plasmablast numbers were significantly increased in tissues from patients with CRSsNP compared with control tissues (P < .05). Among numerous factors tested, IL-2 levels were increased in UT from patients with CRSsNP and were positively correlated with tissue IgD levels. Additionally, supernatants of IL-2-stimulated dissociated tissue from patients with CRSsNP had significantly increased sIgD levels compared with those in IL-2-stimulated dissociated control tissue ex vivo (P < .05). Tissue from patients with CRS with preoperative antibiotic use or those with pathogenic bacteria showed higher IgD levels compared with tissue from patients without these variables (P < .05). CONCLUSION sIgD levels and IgD+CD19+CD38bright plasmablast counts were increased in nasal tissue of patients with CRSsNP. IgD levels were associated with increased IL-2 levels and the presence of pathogenic bacteria. These findings suggest that IgD might contribute to enhancement mucosal immunity or inflammation or respond to bacterial infections in patients with CRS, especially CRSsNP.","Min, Jin-Young; Nayak, Jayakar V; Hulse, Kathryn E; Stevens, Whitney W; Raju, Paul A; Huang, Julia H; Suh, Lydia A; Van Roey, Griet A; Norton, James E; Carter, Roderick G; Price, Caroline P E; Weibman, Ava R; Rashan, Ali R; Ghosn, Eliver E; Patel, Zara M; Homma, Tetsuya; Conley, David B; Welch, Kevin C; Shintani-Smith, Stephanie; Peters, Anju T; Grammer, Leslie C; Harris, Kathleen E; Kato, Atsushi; Hwang, Peter H; Kern, Robert C; Herzenberg, Leonore A; Schleimer, Robert P; Tan, Bruce K",The Journal of allergy and clinical immunology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaci.2017.05.032; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28625807/,387

METHODS We examined consecutive patients enrolled in the population-based Mayo Clinic Olmsted Study of Aging and then admitted to medical or surgical adult ICUs at Mayo Clinic, Rochester between January 1, 2006, and December 31, 2014 to determine one-year functional outcomes. RESULTS 831cases were included. Mean age was 84 years (IQR 79-88). 569 (68.5%) patients were alive one year after ICU admission. Of them, 546 patients had functional assessment at one year and 367 (67.2%) had good functional outcome. On multivariable analysis, poor one-year functional outcome (death or disability) was more common among women, older patients, and patients with baseline cognitive impairment (mild cognitive impairment or dementia), higher Carlson scores, and longer ICU stay (all P <.01). After excluding deceased patients, these associations remained unchanged. In addition, 120 (32.3%) of 372 patients who had post-ICU cognitive evaluation experienced cognitive decline after the ICU admission. CONCLUSIONS On a population-based cohort of older, predominantly elderly patients, approximately two-thirds of survivors maintained or regained good functional status 1 year after ICU hospitalization. However, older age, female sex, greater comorbidities, abnormal baseline cognition, and longer ICU stay were associated with poor functional recovery and cognitive decline was common.","Hajeb, Mania; Singh, Tarun D; Sakusic, Amra; Graff-Radford, Jonathan; Gajic, Ognjen; Rabinstein, Alejandro A",Neurological research,https://doi.org/10.1080/01616412.2020.1831302; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33012281/,387

131593,A comparative analysis of the substance use and mental health characteristics of nurses who complete suicide.,2021-03-25,"BACKGROUND Diagnosing periprosthetic joint infection after total joint arthroplasty is often challenging. The alpha defensin test has been recently reported as a promising diagnostic test for periprosthetic joint infection. The goal of this study was to determine the diagnostic accuracy of alpha defensin testing. METHODS One hundred and eighty-three synovial alpha defensin and synovial fluid C-reactive protein (CRP) tests performed in 183 patients undergoing evaluation for periprosthetic joint infection were reviewed. Results were compared with the Musculoskeletal Infection Society (MSIS) criteria for periprosthetic joint infection. RESULTS Alpha defensin tests were performed prior to surgical treatment for infection, and 37 of these patients who had these tests were diagnosed by MSIS criteria as having infections. Among this group, the alpha defensin test had a sensitivity of 81.1% (95% confidence interval [CI], 64.8% to 92.0%) and a specificity of 95.9% (95% CI, 91.3% to 98.5%). There were 6 false-positive results, 4 of which were associated with metallosis. There were 7 false negatives, all of which were associated with either draining sinuses (n = 3) or low-virulence organisms (n = 4). A combined analysis of alpha defensin and synovial fluid CRP tests was performed in which a positive result was represented by a positive alpha defensin test and a positive synovial fluid CRP test (n = 28). Among this group, the sensitivity was calculated to be 73.0% (95% CI, 55.9% to 86.2%) and the specificity was calculated to be 99.3% (95% CI, 96.2% to 99.9%). An additional combined analysis was performed where a positive result was represented by a positive alpha defensin test or positive synovial fluid CRP test (n = 64). Among this group, the sensitivity was calculated to be 91.9% (95% CI, 78.1% to 98.3%) and the specificity was calculated to be 79.5% (95% CI, 72.0% to 85.7%). CONCLUSIONS Alpha defensin in combination with synovial fluid CRP demonstrates very high sensitivity for diagnosing periprosthetic joint infection, but may yield false-positive results in the presence of metallosis or false-negative results in the presence of low-virulence organisms. When both alpha defensin and synovial fluid CRP tests are positive, there is a very high specificity for diagnosing periprosthetic joint infection. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE Diagnostic Level III.

However, these influences have not been clarified in clinical settings. Objectives: This study aimed to investigate association the between the prothrombin time-international normalized ratio (PT-INR) and concomitant use of antibiotics in a real-world population of warfarin users. Methods: This was a single-center cohort study using data from health records and included patients who received β-lactams (BLs)/fluoroquinolones (FQs) during ongoing warfarin treatment (2011-2015) at Hamamatsu University Hospital in Japan. Antibiotics were categorized into those to which B fragilis is susceptible (BLsus, FQsus) and those to which it is not (BLnon, FQnon) and into those given orally (BLpo, FQpo) or intravenously (BLiv, FQiv). Outcomes were excessive PT-INR and changes in PT-INR, defined as the ratio (INR ratio) and difference (ΔINR) of maximum PT-INR and baseline PT-INR. Excessive PT-INR was graded as INR ratio of >1.5 or >2.5. Results: A total of 1185 warfarin users were included. The proportion of INR ratio >2.5 in FQiv was higher than in BLiv (95% CI: 1.59-46.5). The proportions with an INR ratio of >1.5 in BLsus and FQsus were higher than in BLnon (1.72-14.1) and FQnon (1.05-9.36), respectively. ΔINR values in FQpo, FQiv, and FQsus were higher than those in BLpo, BLiv, and FQnon, respectively. Conclusions and Relevance: Concomitant use of FQs, or of antibiotics to which B fragilis is susceptible is associated with higher risk of excessive anticoagulation. These findings would contribute to safe and proper antibiotic treatment in warfarin users.","Yagi, Tatsuya; Naito, Takafumi; Kato, Ayami; Hirao, Kensho; Kawakami, Junichi",The Annals of pharmacotherapy,https://doi.org/10.1177/1060028020940728; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32633584/,387

El objetivo de este documento es explorar las contribuciones de tres vías de transmisión-contacto, gota e inhalación-al riesgo de infección de COVID-19 adquirida por el personal sanitario en el ámbito laboral. El método consistió en la evaluación cuantitativa de los riesgos microbianos y de un modelo de exposición cuyos posibles parámetros se basaron en datos específicos del virus SARS-CoV-2 cuando se disponía de ellos. El hallazgo clave fue que las vías de transmisión por gotas e inhalación predominan sobre la vía de contacto, contribuyendo en promedio 35%, 57% y 8.2% a la probabilidad de infección cuando no se usa equipo de protección personal. En promedio, 80% de la exposición a la inhalación ocurre cuando el personal sanitario está cerca de los pacientes. La contribución relativa de las gotas y la inhalación depende de la emisión de SARS-CoV-2 en las partículas respirables (<10 μm) a través de la exhalación, y la inhalación se vuelve predominante, en promedio, cuando la emisión supera las cinco copias genéticas por minuto. La concentración prevista del SARS-CoV-2 en el aire de la habitación del paciente es baja (<1 copia del gen por m3 en promedio) y probablemente se encuentre por debajo del límite de cuantificación de muchos métodos de muestreo del aire. Los resultados demuestran el valor que supone la protección respiratoria del personal sanitario y que el muestreo de campo puede no ser lo suficientemente sensible para verificar la contribución que realiza la inhalación del SARS-CoV-2 al riesgo de infección de COVID-19 adquirida por el personal. La emisión e ineficacia del SARS-CoV-2 en gotas respiratorias de diferente tamaño es aún una brecha en el conocimiento, fundamental para comprender y controlar la transmisión de la COVID-19.","Jones, Rachael M",Journal of occupational and environmental hygiene,https://doi.org/10.1080/15459624.2021.1877053; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33822691/,387

Employment status is a major factor determining the amount of physical activity performed. Our purpose was to understand how employment status affects physical activity and sitting time. METHODS Between April 13 and May 4, 2020, 735 full-time employed individuals responded to a survey investigating daily life and overall health during the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants reported how much physical activity they had performed in the last 7 days. Multiple linear regressions were performed for physical activity and sitting time. RESULTS Physical activity was not associated with employment status. An interaction effect between hours worked and employment status was found for sitting time. CONCLUSIONS Employment status was not related to physical activity; however, it did affect the amount of time spent sitting, with nonessential employees sitting more and working more hours than essential employees. Because greater amounts of daily total sitting time have been associated with increased risk of all-cause mortality, it is important that increased sitting time be attenuated by greater physical activity.","Lindsey, Bryndan W; Boolani, Ali; Merrigan, Justin J; Cortes, Nelson; Caswell, Shane V; Martin, Joel R",Journal of physical activity & health,https://doi.org/10.1123/jpah.2020-0570; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33601333/,387

The Korean outbreak was initiated by a single infected individual, allowing studies of virus evolution in the absence of further MERS-CoV introduction into human populations. In contrast, MERS is primarily a camel disease on the Arabian Peninsula and in Africa, with clinical disease in humans only in the former location. Previous work identified two mutations in the South Korean MERS-CoV, D510G and I529T on the Spike (S) protein, that led to impaired binding to the receptor. However, whether these mutations affected virulence is unknown. To address this question, we constructed isogenic viruses expressing mutations found in the S protein from Korean isolates and showed that isogenic viruses carrying the Korean MERS-CoV mutations, D510G or I529T, were attenuated in mice, resulting in greater survival, less induction of inflammatory cytokines, and less severe lung injury. In contrast, isogenic viruses expressing S proteins from African isolates were nearly fully virulent; other studies showed that West African camel isolates carry mutations in MERS-CoV accessory proteins, which may limit human transmission. These data indicate that following a single-point introduction of the virus, MERS-CoV S protein evolved rapidly in South Korea to adapt to human populations, with consequences on virulence. In contrast, the mutations in S proteins of African isolates did not change virulence, indicating that S protein variation likely does not play a major role in the lack of camel-to-human transmission in Africa.","Wong, Lok-Yin Roy; Zheng, Jian; Sariol, Alan; Lowery, Shea; Meyerholz, David K; Gallagher, Tom; Perlman, Stanley",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2102983118; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34099556/,387

To our knowledge, detailed EEG findings in COVID-19 have not yet been reported. This report adds to the scarce body of evidence. METHODS We identified eight COVID-19 positive patients who underwent EEG monitoring in our hospital system. RESULTS EEGs were most commonly ordered for an altered level of consciousness, a nonspecific neurologic manifestation. We observed generalized background slowing in all patients and generalized epileptiform discharges with triphasic morphology in three patients. Focal electrographic seizures were observed in one patient with a history of focal epilepsy and in another patient with no such history. Five of eight patients had a previous diagnosis of epilepsy, suggesting that pre-existing epilepsy can be a potential risk factor for COVID-19-associated neurological manifestations. Five of eight patients who underwent EEG experienced a fatal outcome of infection. CONCLUSIONS Our findings underscore previous observations that neurologic manifestations are common in severe cases. COVID-19 patients with epilepsy may have an increased risk of neurological manifestations and abnormal EEG.","Pilato, Madison S; Urban, Alexandra; Alkawadri, Rafeed; Barot, Niravkumar V; Castellano, James F; Rajasekaran, Vijayalakshmi; Bagić, Anto I; Fong-Isariyawongse, Joanna S",Journal of clinical neurophysiology : official publication of the American Electroencephalographic Society,https://doi.org/10.1097/wnp.0000000000000752; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32639251/,387

Therefore, in this experiment, feces samples collected from infants were transplanted into germ-free mice, to explore the effect of stachyose on the intestinal microbiota and host gut barrier. We found that stachyose promoted the relative abundance of A. muciniphila in human feces; enhanced the symbiotic relationships of A. muciniphila; increased the short-chain fatty acid level, and secretory immunoglobulin A level; reduced the levels of lipopolysaccharide, IL-1, IL-17 and TNF-α through downregulated the expression of NF-κB; increased expression of tight junction proteins (occludin and ZO-1) and goblet cell through A. muciniphila. The intake of stachyose is conducive to promoting the proliferation of beneficial bacteria and enhancing the intestinal barrier in germ-free mice.

The purpose of this article is to provide examples of major environmental injustices in the Pacific and to develop a deeper understanding of the relationship between settler colonialism and environmental injustices. Indigenous knowledge, with a focus on traditional ecological knowledge, is incorporated not just to demonstrate the deep impact of injustices on Pacific people's cultures but also to highlight how this way of knowing cultivates a path to revitalization and community resilience. Cultural practices rooted in traditional ecological knowledge, such as the preservation of food systems, promote reciprocity between living beings and self-determination, necessary for community flourishing.

The objective of this study was to determine if breakdown of the endothelial glycocalyx (eGC) occurs during malaria infection in children. Measures of eGC integrity, endothelial activation, and microvascular reactivity were prospectively evaluated in 146 children: 44 with moderately severe malaria (MSM), 42 with severe malaria (SM), and 60 healthy controls (HC). Biochemical measures of eGC integrity included plasma syndecan-1 and total urinary glycosaminoglycans (GAG). Side-stream dark field imaging was used to quantitatively assess integrity of eGC. Plasma angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2) was measured as a marker of endothelial activation and also as a possible mediator of eGC breakdown. Our results show that urinary GAG, syndecan-1, and Ang-2 were elevated in patients with MSM and SM compared with HC. Syndecan-1 and GAG levels correlated significantly with each other and with plasma Ang-2. The eGC breakdown products also inversely correlated significantly with hemoglobin and platelet count.

Although not correlated with markers of eGC degradation, vascular function (assessed by non-invasive near infrared spectroscopy [NIRS]) demonstrated reduced microvascular reactivity, particularly affecting the SM group.

Multiple pathological physeal fractures were present, including the distal radii, metacarpal and metatarsal bones. No treatment was attempted and the patient was euthanased. Histopathology revealed infiltration by monomorphic round cells within the liver, spleen, kidney and bone marrow. Immunohistochemistry revealed strong reactivity to CD20. Clonality assays revealed clonal results for the B-cell loci, consistent with B-cell lymphoma. To the authors' knowledge this is the first report of polyostotic lymphoma with multiple pathological fractures in a cat.

METHODS Non-infected liver slices, obtained from human liver resection and cut in 350 μm-thick slices (2.7 × 10(6) cells per slice) were infected with cell culture-grown HCV Con1b/C3 supernatant (multiplicity of infection = 0.1) cultivated for up to ten days. HCV infected slices were treated at day 4 post-infection with GNS-396 for 6 d at different concentrations. HCV replication was evaluated by strand-specific real-time quantitative reverse transcription - polymerase chain reaction. The infectivity titers of supernatants were evaluated by foci formation upon inoculation into naive Huh-7.5.1 cells. The cytotoxic effect of the drugs was evaluated by lactate dehydrogenase leakage assays. RESULTS The antiviral efficacy of a new antiviral drug, GNS-396, an autophagy inhibitor, on HCV infection of adult human liver slices was evidenced in a dose-dependent manner. At day 6 post-treatment, GNS-396 EC50 was 158 nmol/L without cytotoxic effect (compared to hydroxychloroquine EC50 = 1.17 μmol/L). CONCLUSION Our results demonstrated that our ex vivo model is efficient for evaluation the potency of autophagy inhibitors, in particular a new quinoline derivative GNS-396 as antiviral could inhibit HCV infection in a dose-dependent manner without cytotoxic effect.","Lagaye, Sylvie; Brun, Sonia; Gaston, Jesintha; Shen, Hong; Stranska, Ruzena; Camus, Claire; Dubray, Clarisse; Rousseau, Géraldine; Massault, Pierre-Philippe; Courcambeck, Jerôme; Bassisi, Firas; Halfon, Philippe; Pol, Stanislas",World journal of hepatology,https://doi.org/10.4254/wjh.v8.i21.902; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27478540/,387

Treatment guidelines for OA recommend acetaminophen for first-line pharmacotherapy for these patients; however, this strategy is rarely effective as monotherapy. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are considered the next step in therapy and have accumulated a large body of data to support their efficacy for OA. Unfortunately, this class of agents is not without the potential for significant adverse effects. In an effort to capture the efficacy of NSAIDs while decreasing their side effect burden, many clinicians are turning to the topical administration of these agents. Localized pain and smaller, superficial joints may be especially amenable to the topical administration of NSAIDs. Numerous commercially available topical NSAID formulations have been shown to be efficacious in patients with OA.

Perturbation of micronutrients has been broadly reported to be a common characteristic in patients with ALD, given the fact that micronutrients often act as composition or coenzymes of many biochemical enzymes responsible for the inflammatory response, oxidative stress, and cell proliferation. Mapping the metabolic pattern and the function of these micronutrients is a prerequisite before targeted intervention can be delivered in clinical practice. Recent years have registered a significant improvement in our understanding of the role of micronutrients on the pathogenesis and progression of ALD. However, how and to what extent these micronutrients are involved in the pathophysiology of ALD remains largely unknown. In the current study, we provide a review of recent studies that investigated the imbalance of micronutrients in patients with ALD with a focus on zinc, iron, copper, magnesium, selenium, vitamin D and vitamin E, and determine how disturbances in micronutrients relates to the pathophysiology of ALD. Overall, zinc, selenium, vitamin D, and vitamin E uniformly exhibited a deficiency, and iron demonstrated an elevated trend. While for copper, both an elevation and deficiency were observed from existing literature. More importantly, we also highlight several challenges in terms of low sample size, study design discrepancies, sample heterogeneity across studies, and the use of machine learning approaches.","Wu, Jing; Meng, Qing-Hua",World journal of gastroenterology,https://doi.org/10.3748/wjg.v26.i31.4567; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32884217/,387

The aim of the present review was to summarize the current literature concerning the methodologies and applications of EIT in lung diseases with flow limitation and hyperinflation. PubMed was searched up to May 2020 to identify studies investigating the use of EIT in patients with asthma, bronchiectasis, bronchitis, bronchiolitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and cystic fibrosis. The extracted data included study design, EIT methodologies, interventions, validation and comparators, population characteristics, and key findings. Of the 44 included studies, seven were related to simulation, animal experimentation, or reconstruction algorithm development with evaluation on patients; 27 studies had the primary objective of validating EIT technique and measures including regional ventilation distribution, regional EIT-spirometry parameters, end-expiratory lung impedance, and regional time constants; and 10 studies had the primary objective of applying EIT to monitor the response to therapeutic interventions, including various ventilation supports, patient repositioning, and airway suctioning. In pediatric and adult patients, EIT has been successfully validated for assessing spatial and temporal ventilation distribution, measuring changes in lung volume and flow, and studying regional respiratory mechanics. EIT has also demonstrated potential as an alternative or supplement to well-established measurement modalities (e.g., conventional pulmonary function testing) to monitor the progression of obstructive lung diseases, although the existing literature lacks prediction values as references and lacks clinical outcome evidence.","Sang, Ling; Zhao, Zhanqi; Lin, Zhimin; Liu, Xiaoqing; Zhong, Nanshan; Li, Yimin",Annals of translational medicine,https://doi.org/10.21037/atm-20-4984; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33490200/,387

In the present study, volume and shape of the basal ganglia was examined in people with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder relative to healthy controls and hypothesized that unique neuroanatomical differences would be observed in each patient group. Magnetic resonance 1.5T images were obtained from schizophrenia (n = 47), schizoaffective disorder (n = 15), and from healthy control (n = 42) participants, matched for age, gender, parental socioeconomic status, and race. The caudate, putamen, and globus pallidus were characterized using high-dimensional brain mapping procedures (Csernansky et al., 2004b). Results revealed significant shape deformations between schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder that also differed from control subjects. Relative to schizophrenia, schizoaffective subjects showed exaggerated inward deformations indicative of localized volume loss in subregions of the caudate, putamen, and globus pallidus (all p < 0.001). These shape features correlated with mental flexibility and negative symptoms in schizophrenia (all p < 0.05), but not schizoaffective disorder. To the extent that differences in important basal ganglia substructures reflect biological heterogeneity among these two psychotic illnesses, this data could prove useful in improving diagnostic precision, as well as informing the affective component of mental illness.","Cobia, Derin; Rich, Chaz; Smith, Matthew J; Mamah, Daniel; Csernansky, John G; Wang, Lei",Psychiatry research.

152304,Gaiha et al. Response.,2021-01-01,"INTRODUCTION Hospital-acquired infections (HAIs) are associated with increased morbidity and mortality, especially in developing countries. However, limited information is available about the risk of HAIs in naturally ventilated wards (NVWs) and mechanically ventilated intensive care units (MVICUs) of public hospitals in the Philippines. We aimed to assess the association between HAIs and type of ventilation in an urban tertiary care hospital in the Philippines. METHODOLOGY A cross-sectional point-prevalence survey of infections was done in NVWs and MVICUs of a tertiary care hospital in December 2013. Multivariate analyses were done to examine the associations between HAIs and type of ventilation and other risk factors. RESULTS Of the 224 patients surveyed, 63 (28%) patients had 69 HAIs. Pneumonia was the most common HAI (35%). Wards near areas with high vehicular activity had more respiratory HAI cases. Being immunocompromised is a risk factor for HAI for pediatric and adult patients. Among pediatric patients, staying in MVICUs had a lower risk for HAIs (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]: 0.33; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.10-1.08) compared to staying in NVWs. For adult patients, a higher risk for HAIs (AOR: 2.41; 95% CI: 0.29-18.20) was observed in MVICUs compared to NVWs. CONCLUSIONS Type of ventilation is not a risk factor for HAIs. Patients who are immunocompromised may be at a higher risk for HAI. Indoor air pollution, proximity to congested main thoroughfare, and increased human foot traffic may contribute to the susceptibility of patients to HAIs. Hospital layout should be considered in infection control.","Vergeire-Dalmacion, Godofreda Ruiz; Itable, Jill Rafols; Baja, Emmanuel Saporna",Journal of infection in developing countries,https://doi.org/10.3855/jidc.8295; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27886037/,387

Its use has expanded for investigation of upper and lower gastrointestinal diseases with similar prototypes. AREAS COVERED This review covers the role and recent advances of CE, as a non-invasive investigative tool. EXPERT OPINION The use of upper gastrointestinal CE is useful in patients who require surveillance for varices particularly in the current era of the COVID 19 pandemic. It has also shown high accuracy in the detection of upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage in patients presenting to the emergency department with a suspicion of haemorrhage. Findings on CE help to guide further management by device assisted enteroscopy. The data on colon CE suggests comparable diagnostic accuracy to colonoscopy for polyp detection, however more evidence is required in the high risk group. Crohn's CE has become an integral part of the management of patients with Crohn's disease offering a comparative assessment tool post escalation of therapy. Artificial intelligence within CE, has demonstrated similar if not better diagnostic yield compared to the human with a significantly shorter reading time. Artificial intelligence is likely to be in-built within CE reading platforms over the next few years minimising reporting time and human error.","Zammit Chetcuti, Stefania; Sidhu, Reena",Expert review of gastroenterology & hepatology,https://doi.org/10.1080/17474124.2021.1840351; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33111600/,387
153718,Surviving a Pandemic.,2020-06-01,"UNLABELLED An accessory gene between the S and E gene loci is contained in all coronaviruses (CoVs), and its function has been studied in some coronaviruses. This gene locus in human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43) encodes the ns12.9 accessory protein; however, its function during viral infection remains unknown. Here, we engineered a recombinant mutant virus lacking the ns12.9 protein (HCoV-OC43-Δns12.9) to characterize the contributions of ns12.9 in HCoV-OC43 replication. The ns12.9 accessory protein is a transmembrane protein and forms ion channels in both Xenopus oocytes and yeast through homo-oligomerization, suggesting that ns12.9 is a newly recognized viroporin. HCoV-OC43-Δns12.9 presented at least 10-fold reduction of viral titer in vitro and in vivo. Intriguingly, exogenous ns12.9 and heterologous viroporins with ion channel activity could compensate for the production of HCoV-OC43-Δns12.9, indicating that the ion channel activity of ns12.9 plays a significant role in the production of infectious virions. Systematic dissection of single-cycle replication revealed that ns12.9 protein had no measurable effect on virus entry, subgenomic mRNA (sgmRNA) synthesis, and protein expression. Further characterization revealed that HCoV-OC43-Δns12.9 was less efficient in virion morphogenesis than recombinant wild-type virus (HCoV-OC43-WT). Moreover, reduced viral replication, inflammatory response, and virulence in HCoV-OC43-Δns12.9-infected mice were observed compared to the levels for HCoV-OC43-WT-infected mice. Taken together, our results demonstrated that the ns12.9 accessory protein functions as a viroporin and is involved in virion morphogenesis and the pathogenesis of HCoV-OC43 infection. IMPORTANCE HCoV-OC43 was isolated in the 1960s and is a major agent of the common cold. The functions of HCoV-OC43 structural proteins have been well studied, but few studies have focused on its accessory proteins. In the present study, we demonstrated that the ns12.9 protein is a newly recognized viroporin, and the ns12.9 gene knockout virus (HCoV-OC43-Δns12.9) presents a growth defect in vitro and in vivo. We identified the important functions of the ns12.9 viroporin in virion morphogenesis during HCoV-OC43 infection. Furthermore, mice infected with HCoV-OC43-Δns12.9 exhibited reduced inflammation and virulence accompanied by a lower titer in the brain than that of wild-type-infected mice, suggesting the ns12.9 viroporin influences virus pathogenesis. Therefore, our findings revealed that the ns12.9 viroporin facilitates virion morphogenesis to enhance viral production, and these results provided a deeper understanding of HCoV-OC43 pathogenesis.","Zhang, Ronghua; Wang, Kai; Ping, Xianqiang; Yu, Wenjing; Qian, Zhikang; Xiong, Sidong; Sun, Bing",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01986-15; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26339053/,387

The light illumination enables flexible switching of the quantum transition in monolayer WS2 from an insulator to a superconductor. In contrast to the prevailing picture of photoinduced carriers, we find that in the presence of a strong interfacial electric field conducting electrons could escape from the surface confinement by absorbing photons, mimicking the field emission. Such an optical tuning tool in conjunction with ionic liquid gating greatly facilitates continuous modulation of carrier densities and hence electronic phases, which would help to unveil novel quantum phenomena and device functionality in various materials.","Qin, Maosen; Han, Xiangyan; Ding, Dongdong; Niu, Ruirui; Qu, Zhuangzhuang; Wang, Zhiyu; Liao, Zhi-Min; Gan, Zizhao; Huang, Yuan; Han, Chunrui; Lu, Jianming; Ye, Jianting",Nano letters,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.nanolett.1c01467; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34369798/,387

Yet, despite working in one of the most dangerous occupations, and despite being especially vulnerable to the virus (due to existing health risk factors and risk of infection stemming from difficulties adopting control measures), many farmers and farm workers in the United States have long lacked essential resources to ensure they can meet their health needs: affordable and accessible health insurance and health care. In this commentary, we draw on our own research focused on farm families and collective experiences to discuss three main challenges farm families have faced meeting their health needs: reliance on off-farm work for health insurance coverage, the need to forecast income when purchasing a plan on the health insurance marketplace, and barriers to health care in rural areas. As we discuss these challenges, we highlight the ways in which the COVID-19 pandemic is likely exacerbating these pressures. Recognizing that major crises in the past have led to major shifts in economic, social, and political systems, the disruptions brought on by COVID-19 could be leveraged to work toward increasing access to affordable and adequate health insurance and health care. As such, we conclude our commentary by outlining policy reforms and research efforts that are needed to ensure that those working in the farm sector have access to essential resources to preserve their health and safety.","Becot, Florence; Inwood, Shoshanah; Bendixsen, Casper; Henning-Smith, Carrie",Journal of agromedicine,https://doi.org/10.1080/1059924x.2020.1814924; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32921286/,387

Here, we investigate the impact of different age individuals on HLA-DR expression on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The results indicate that HLA-DR expression on PBMCs in the population aged above 70 years significantly increased as compared with that in the lower-age groups by flow cytometry analysis (B-D; r = 0.690, P = 0.000265). In addition, followed by LPS stimulation, the levels of cytokine TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-10 secretion by allogeneic T lymphocytes from different age groups (A-D) were significantly increased (P < 0.05). Notably, levels of TNF-α and IL-6 were significantly reduced in groups B, C and D as compared with group A (P < 0.05), whereas levels of IL-10 increased (P = 0.012). However, no significant difference in PBMC-secreted TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-10 levels was observed among groups A, B, C and D (P > 0.05) before LPS stimulation. We firstly present data showing an age-dependent increase in HLA-DR expression in the population aged above 70 years and the individual with aged above 70 years has reduced the secretion of inflammatory mediators (TNF-α and IL-6) by PBMCs and increased the secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokine (IL-10) after LPS stimulation in vitro.

RSV infection and maturation of primary human DCs are reduced in a dose-dependent manner by EDTA. Therefore, we asked whether RSV infection involves DC-SIGN (CD209) or its isoform L-SIGN (CD299) (DC-SIGN/R). Using surface plasmon resonance analysis, we demonstrated that the attachment G glycoprotein of RSV binds both DC- and L-SIGN. However, neutralization of DC- and L-SIGN on primary human DCs did not inhibit RSV infection, demonstrating that interactions between RSV G and DC- or L-SIGN are not required for productive infection. Thus, neither DC- nor L-SIGN represents a functional receptor for RSV. However, inhibition of these interactions increased DC activation, as evidenced by significantly higher levels of alpha interferon (IFN-α), MIP-1α, and MIP-1β in plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) exposed to RSV after neutralization of DC-and L-SIGN. To understand the molecular interactions involved, intracellular signaling events triggered by purified RSV G glycoprotein were examined in DC- and L-SIGN-transfected 3T3 cells. RSV G interaction with DC- or L-SIGN was shown to stimulate ERK1 and ERK2 phosphorylation, with statistically significant increases relative to mock-infected cells. Neutralization of DC- and L-SIGN reduced ERK1/2 phosphorylation. With increased DC activation following DC- and L-SIGN neutralization and RSV exposure, these data demonstrate that the signaling events mediated by RSV G interactions with DC/L-SIGN are immunomodulatory and diminish DC activation, which may limit induction of RSV-specific immunity.","Johnson, Teresa R; McLellan, Jason S; Graham, Barney S",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.06096-11; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22090124/,387
159703,Toward understanding the mental health of nigerian residents during lockdown: the influence of age and vulnerability to COVID-19.,2021-05-19,"The use of social and contact networks to answer basic and applied questions about infectious disease transmission in wildlife and livestock is receiving increased attention. Through social network analysis, we understand that wild animal and livestock populations, including farmed fish and poultry, often have a heterogeneous contact structure owing to social structure or trade networks. Network modelling is a flexible tool used to capture the heterogeneous contacts of a population in order to test hypotheses about the mechanisms of disease transmission, simulate and predict disease spread, and test disease control strategies. This review highlights how to use animal contact data, including social networks, for network modelling, and emphasizes that researchers should have a pathogen of interest in mind before collecting or using contact data. This paper describes the rising popularity of network approaches for understanding transmission dynamics in wild animal and livestock populations; discusses the common mismatch between contact networks as measured in animal behaviour and relevant parasites to match those networks; and highlights knowledge gaps in how to collect and analyse contact data. Opportunities for the future include increased attention to experiments, pathogen genetic markers and novel computational tools.","Craft, Meggan E","Philosophical transactions of the Royal Society of London.

We investigated the safety and efficacy of D-SOP with EHL or LL in patients with obstructing pancreatic duct stones. Patients and methods Retrospective analysis of 109 patients who underwent D-SOP for pancreatic stones at 17 tertiary centers in the United States and Europe from February 2015 to September 2017. Logistic regression was performed to identify factors associated with the need for more than one D-SOP with EHL/LL. Results Most patients were males (70.6 %),mean age 54.7 years. Fifty-nine (54.1 %) underwent EHL and 50 (45.9 %) underwent LL. Mean procedure time was longer in the EHL group (74.4 min vs 53.8 min; P < 0.001). Ducts were completely cleared (technical success) in 89.9 % of patients (94.1 % in EHL vs 100 % in LL; P = 0.243), achieved in a single session in 73.5 % of patients (77.1 % by EHL and 70 % by LL; P = 0.5).D-SOP failed in 11 patients (10.1 %); 6 patients were treated with extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy (ESWL), 1 with surgery,1 with combined treatment (ESWL + D-SOP EHL) and 3 with other. Fourteen adverse events occurred in 11 patients (10.1 %). Patients with more than three ductal stones were more likely to have technical failure compared to those with less than three stones (17 % vs. 4.8 %; P = 0.04). Having more than three stones was independently associated with the need for more than one D-SOC EHL/LL session (OR 2.94, 95 % CI 1.13 – 7.65). Conclusion D-SOP with EHL or LL is effective and safe in patients with pancreatic ductal stones.","Brewer Gutierrez, Olaya I; Raijman, Isaac; Shah, Raj J; Elmunzer, B Joseph; Webster, George J M; Pleskow, Douglas; Sherman, Stuart; Sturgess, Richard P; Sejpal, Divyesh V; Ko, Christopher; Maurano, Attilio; Adler, Douglas G; Mullady, Daniel K; Strand, Daniel S; DiMaio, Christopher J; Piraka, Cyrus; Sharahia, Reem; Dbouk, Mohamad H; Han, Samuel; Spiceland, Clayton M; Bekkali, Noor L H; Gabr, Moamen; Bick, Benjamin; Dwyer, Laura K; Han, Dennis; Buxbaum, James; Zulli, Claudio; Cosgrove, Natalie; Wang, Andrew Y; Carr-Locke, David; Kerdsirichairat, Tossapol; Aridi, Hanaa Dakour; Moran, Robert; Shah, Shawn; Yang, Juliana; Sanaei, Omid; Parsa, Nasim; Kumbhari, Vivek; Singh, Vikesh K; Khashab, Mouen A",Endoscopy international open,https://doi.org/10.1055/a-0889-7743; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31281875/,387

METHODS A PubMed search was conducted using the following terms: vaginal vault prolapse, apical prolapse, surgical treatments, culdoplasty, uterosacral ligament fixation, and sacral colpopexy. RESULTS Vaginal vault prolapse is a common condition with many surgical treatment options. Surgical principles and treatment of this condition dates back to the 19th century. Native tissue repairs such as McCall culdoplasty, uterosacral ligament fixation, and sacrospinous fixation have high overall success rates with restoring apical anatomy. Sacral colpopexy also has excellent success rates when mesh is needed to augment repairs. CONCLUSIONS There are many options for the treatment of vaginal vault prolapse. Modifications have been made to the original procedures; however, the basic principles are still applicable and include attaching the vaginal apex to level 1 support.","Klauschie, Jennifer L; Cornella, Jeffrey L",Female pelvic medicine & reconstructive surgery,https://doi.org/10.1097/spv.0b013e3182404189; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22453258/,387

Despite progress in vaccine development, the rise of novel, increasingly infectious SARS-CoV-2 variants makes it clear that our response to the virus must continue to evolve along with it. The use of immunoinformatics provides an opportunity to rapidly and efficiently expand the tools at our disposal to combat the current pandemic and prepare for future outbreaks through epitope-based vaccine design. In this study, we validated and compared the currently available epitope prediction tools, and then used the best tools to predict T cell epitopes from SARS-CoV-2 spike and nucleocapsid proteins for use in an epitope-based vaccine. We combined the mouse MHC affinity predictor and clinical predictors such as HLA affinity, immunogenicity, antigenicity, allergenicity, toxicity and stability to select the highest quality CD8 and CD4 T cell epitopes for the common SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern suitable for further preclinical studies. We also identified variant-specific epitopes to more precisely target the Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, Cluster 5 and US variants. We then modeled the 3D structures of our top 4 N and S epitopes to investigate the molecular interaction between peptide-MHC and peptide-MHC-TCR complexes. Following in vitro and in vivo validation, the epitopes identified by this study may be used in an epitope-based vaccine to protect across all current variants, as well as in variant-specific booster shots to target variants of concern. Immunoinformatics tools allowed us to efficiently predict epitopes in silico most likely to prove effective in vivo, providing a more streamlined process for vaccine development in the context of a rapidly evolving pandemic.","Jabbour, Gabriel; Rego, Samantha; Nguyenkhoa, Vincent; Dakshanamurthy, Sivanesan",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.11.459907,387

168261,Co-development of a best practice checklist for mental health data science: A Delphi study,2021-02-19,"Large genomic insertions, deletions, and inversions are a potent source of functional and fitness-altering variation, but are challenging to resolve with short-read DNA sequencing alone. While recent long-read sequencing technologies have greatly expanded the catalog of structural variants (SVs), their costs have so far precluded their application at population scales. Given these limitations, the role of SVs in human adaptation remains poorly characterized. Here, we used a graph-based approach to genotype 107,866 long-read-discovered SVs in short-read sequencing data from diverse human populations. We then applied an admixture-aware method to scan these SVs for patterns of population-specific frequency differentiation—a signature of local adaptation. We identified 220 SVs exhibiting extreme frequency differentiation, including several SVs that were among the lead variants at their corresponding loci. The top two signatures traced to separate insertion and deletion polymorphisms at the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus, together tagging a 325 Kbp haplotype that swept to high frequency and was subsequently fragmented by recombination. Alleles defining this haplotype are nearly fixed (60-95%) in certain Southeast Asian populations, but are rare or absent from other global populations composing the 1000 Genomes Project. Further investigation revealed that the haplotype closely matches with sequences observed in two of three high-coverage Neanderthal genomes, providing strong evidence of a Neanderthal-introgressed origin. This extraordinary episode of positive selection, which we infer to have occurred between 1700 and 8400 years ago, corroborates the role of immune-related genes as prominent targets of adaptive archaic introgression. Our study demonstrates how combining recent advances in genome sequencing, genotyping algorithms, and population genetic methods can reveal signatures of key evolutionary events that remained hidden within poorly resolved regions of the genome.","Yan, Stephanie M.; Sherman, Rachel M.; Taylor, Dylan J.; Nair, Divya R.; Bortvin, Andrew N.; Schatz, Michael C.; McCoy, Rajiv C.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.26.428314,387

This study argues that attention to the balance of autonomy and community is vital to successful language learning online. An initial exploration of recent scholarship on autonomy and community in learning languages online validates this approach to evaluating the situation. The specific phenomenon of online language teaching and learning during 2020 at the University of Melbourne is then presented as an autoethnographic case study and analyzed in the context of this research. In 2020, the author participated in online language learning experiences from several different perspectives. As Head of Languages, she led development of a new undergraduate certificate in languages in response to an Australian Federal Government initiative to offer significant subsidies for online language certificates in 2020. As a keen language learner, she enrolled in one of these certificates to study Italian. As a French lecturer, she converted Matters of Taste-French Eating Cultures, a highly interactive and sensory oriented on-campus subject for advanced French students, to online delivery. The autoethnographic work undertaken in this article aims to examine critically the author's experiences of teaching and learning in 2020, assessing the advantages and disadvantages of learning languages online from positions of both teacher and learner. These experiences are triangulated with the academic and administrative leadership and coordination required to produce a schema that relates intentions to outcomes in this particularly challenging context. This study is intended to offer insights that may help language educators reflect on their various roles during COVID-19 confinement. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that negotiating the balance between autonomy and community is (still) the key to learning languages online during COVID-19 confinement in 2020.","Dutton, J.",Frontiers in Education,https://doi.org/10.3389/feduc.2021.647817,387

Epidemiological studies showed increased risk for schizophrenia in children of mothers exposed to the 1957 influenza A2 pandemic. Controversy remains concerning the mechanisms of pathogenesis underlying this risk.ObjectivesWe aim to review the evidence for the association between influenza infection and schizophrenia risk, the possible pathogenic mechanisms underlying and correlate these findings with the schizophrenia hypothesis of neurodevelopment.MethodsWe reviewed literature regarding evidence from epidemiological, translational animal models and serological studies using medline database.ResultsThe biological mechanisms likely to be relevant account to the effects of infection-induced maternal immune activation, microglial activation, infection-induced neuronal autoimmunity, molecular mimicry of the influenza virus, neuronal surface autoantibodies and psychosis with potential infectious antecedents. Influenza infection may fit into the theory of the neurodevelopment of schizophrenia as a factor that alters the normal maturation processes of the brain (possible second or third hit).ConclusionsInfluenza infection has multiple pathogenic pathways in both pre and post natal processes that might increase the risk of schizophrenia or psychosis.

The demand for and expansion of food banks, community agencies, and school breakfast programmes in Australia has led to the emergency food relief system being referred to as an “industry” in itself. The COVID-19 pandemic, and the associated financial crisis, have only exacerbated the challenge of putting food onto the table. These unprecedented challenges expose the vulnerabilities of addressing the problem of food insecurity solely through a charity-based approach. Through key case studies of innovative local food governance models across the globe, this paper calls attention to the need to break down the disconnected, siloed, and fragmented policies and responses across public and private spheres in order to design more comprehensive interventions that better address the complex reality of food insecurity in Australia.

However, investigating this hypothesis using routine RT-qPCR testing data is challenging because the population-distribution of viral loads changes depending on the epidemic growth rate; lower cycle threshold (Ct) values for a VOC lineage may simply reflect increasing incidence relative to preexisting lineages. To understand the extent to which viral loads observed under routine surveillance systems reflect viral kinetics or population dynamics, we used a mathematical model of competing strain dynamics and simulated Ct values for variants with different viral kinetics. We found that comparisons of Ct values obtained under random cross-sectional surveillance were highly biased unless samples were obtained at times when the variants had comparable growth rates. Conversely, comparing Ct values from symptom-based testing was largely unaffected by epidemic dynamics, and accounting for the time between symptom onset and sample collection date further reduced the risk of statistical errors. Finally, we show how a single cross-sectional sample of Ct values can be used to jointly estimate differences in viral kinetics and epidemic growth rates between variants. Epidemic dynamics should be accounted for when investigating strain-specific viral kinetics using virologic surveillance data, and findings should be corroborated with longitudinal viral kinetics studies.","Hay, J.

The paper investigated how an online learning environment–especially massive open online course (MOOC) platforms–introduced a sense of social presence in students’ lives to help them better deal with trauma and changed circumstances. To this end, the author conducted a questionnaire-based survey of 5,000 students and 620 teachers at Communication University of China from May 2020 to June 2020 and analysed the respondents’ attitudes towards online community learning during the outbreak and the associated trauma period. The survey reveals that the mimicked social networking environment ensures that students perceive social presence and makes the trauma more bearable. By applying social presence theory to the ongoing crisis and conducting a case study of online education adopted by a Chinese university, this research deepens the understanding of technical reality and social networking environment creation described by the theory. Meanwhile, by analysing co-presence, immediacy, and intimacy in community learning, this study paints a more nuanced picture of the mental state of traumatised groups in a virtual environment. © AMIC/WKWSCI-NTU 2021.","Duan, P.",Asian Journal of Communication,https://doi.org/10.1080/01292986.2021.1941152,387

The trade-off between stopping value-decreasing RPTs and promoting value-increasing RPTs requires lawmakers to seek an optimal balance, relying on several contingent factors. This paper highlights the strong interdependency between RPTs regulation and economic changes. After the 2008 crisis, policymakers have enhanced minority shareholders' control over RPTs, considering their involvement as the most effective safeguard against tunnelling. During the COVID-19 crisis, governments have introduced exemptions to the rules on RPTs, even if they might weaken minority shareholders' protection. The reason is that firms face dramatic liquidity shortfalls due to the pandemic, and RPTs can be a vehicle for providing finance to distressed companies, avoiding a wave of bankruptcies that would be dangerous for the economy. Thus, RPTs regulation has been tweaked for adapting to the new economic environment, and these legal changes, in turn, could affect the economic recovery.","Toniolo, Anna",Christ University Law Journal,https://doi.org/10.12728/culj.18.1,387
184768,Personal protection during resuscitation of casualties contaminated with chemical or biological warfare agents--a survey of medical first responders.,2009,"The pulmonary surfactant (PS) is a complex mixture of lipids and proteins dispersed in the aqueous lining layer of the alveolar surface. Such a layer plays a key role in maintaining the proper lung functionality. It acts as a barrier against inhaled particles and pathogens, including viruses, and may represent an important entry point for drugs delivered via aerosols. Understanding the physicochemical properties of PS is therefore of importance for the comprehension of pathophysiological mechanisms affecting the respiratory system. That can be of particular relevance for supporting the development of novel therapeutic interventions against COVID-19–induced acute respiratory distress syndrome. Owing to the complexity of the in vivo alveolar lining layer, several in vitro methodologies have been developed to investigate the functional and structural properties of PS films or interfacial films made by major constituents of the natural PS. As breathing is a highly dynamic interfacial process, most applied methodologies for studying PSs need to be capable of dynamic measurements, including the study of interfacial dilational rheology. We provide here a review of the most frequently and successfully applied methodologies that have proven to be excellent tools for understanding the biophysics of the PS and of its role in the respiratory mechanics. This overview also discusses recent findings on the dynamics of PS layers and the impact of inhalable particles or pathogens, such as the novel coronavirus, on its functionality.","Ravera, F.; Miller, R.; Zuo, Y.

This increase has been further exacerbated because of the current coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, thereby increasing the pressure on existing healthcare resources. Smart and Connected Health (SCH) is a viable solution for the prevalent healthcare challenges. It can reshape the course of healthcare to be more strategic, preventive, and custom-designed, making it more effective with value-added services. This research endeavors to classify state-of-the-art SCH technologies via a thorough literature review and analysis to comprehensively define SCH features and identify the enabling technology-related challenges in SCH adoption. We also propose an architectural model that captures the technological aspect of the SCH solution, its environment, and its primary involved stakeholders. It serves as a reference model for SCH acceptance and implementation. We reflected the COVID-19 case study illustrating how some countries have tackled the pandemic differently in terms of leveraging the power of different SCH technologies, such as big data, cloud computing, Internet of Things, artificial intelligence, robotics, blockchain, and mobile applications. In combating the pandemic, SCH has been used efficiently at different stages such as disease diagnosis, virus detection, individual monitoring, tracking, controlling, and resource allocation. Furthermore, this review highlights the challenges to SCH acceptance, as well as the potential research directions for better patient-centric healthcare.","Navaz, A. N.; Serhani, M.

METHOD We performed a retrospective analysis of case notes of 29 patients who underwent laparoscopic adrenalectomy for phaeochromocytoma between 2000 and 2013. RESULTS Twenty-nine patients (16 female), aged 16 to 67 years, underwent laparoscopic adrenalectomy for phaeochromocytoma. All patients were treated preoperatively with alpha-blocking agents. 80% were prescribed additional preoperative antihypertensive agents. 90% received antihypertensive agents intraoperatively. All patients received intraoperative magnesium sulphate for haemodynamic stabilisation. The mean operative time was 160 minutes. Nearly all of the patients experienced haemodynamic stability during surgery. Two patients required conversion to open adrenalectomy, due to severe intraoperative hypertension during tumour handling, and due to extensive intra-abdominal adhesions. Postoperative complications were minimal, and included blood loss, superior epigastric artery damage, and cellulitis at the laparoscopic port site. There was no perioperative mortality. The median length of stay postoperatively was 4 days. 24% were prescribed antihypertensive medication on discharge. CONCLUSION In our experience, favourable perioperative outcomes were achieved, demonstrating that laparoscopic adrenalectomy for phaeochromocytoma is a safe and effective procedure in the setting of experienced and skilled surgical, anaesthetic and medical teams delivering the perioperative care.","Hotu, Cheri; Harman, Richard; Cutfield, Richard; Hodges, Nicola; Taylor, Eletha; Young, Simon",The New Zealand medical journal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26645753/,387

Infected cells were labeled with (32)P(i) in the presence of actinomycin D for the duration of the viral multiplication cycle, and nucleic acids were extracted, denatured, and analyzed on agarose slab gels. Six major RNA species were found. None of these RNAs was found in extracts of mock-infected cells. All six of the virus-specified RNAs (designated species A through F) were single stranded, and RNA species F had the same electrophoretic mobility as purified viral genome RNA. The molecular weights of the five subgenomic RNAs were estimated to be 0.8 x 10(6), 0.9 x 10(6), 1.3 x 10(6), 1.5 x 10(6), and 2.6 x 10(6) for species A through E, respectively. All of the RNAs were polyadenylated and are therefore likely to be viral mRNA's. The RNAs were synthesized in approximately constant proportions throughout the viral multiplication cycle. Intracellular RNA species A, B, C, D, and F and the purified viral genome were analyzed by RNase T(1) fingerprinting. The results confirmed the identification of RNA species F as the intracellular genome and the derivation of the four smaller RNAs from the genome. Fingerprinting also showed that the intracellular RNAs constitute a nested set such that the nucleotide sequence of each RNA is contained within all larger RNAs and each larger RNA contains an additional sequence congruent with its greater size. Finally, the possible modes of transcription and translation of the infectious bronchitis virus RNAs are discussed.","Stern, D F; Kennedy, S I",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6247505/,387

203294,A mental health paradox: Mental health was both a motivator and barrier to physical activity during the COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"BACKGROUND: Although mental distress and quality of life (QoL) impairments because of the pandemic have increased worldwide, the way that each community has been affected has varied. AIMS: This study evaluated the impact of social distancing imposed by coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) on Brazilians' mental health and QoL. METHOD: In this cross-sectional community-based online survey, data from 1156 community-dwelling adults were gathered between 11 May and 3 June 2020. We examined independent correlates of depression, anxiety and QoL, including sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, optimism/pessimism and spiritual/religious coping. Dependent variables were assessed using the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire for depressive symptoms, the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale for anxiety symptoms, and the World Health Organization Quality of Life-BREF for QoL. Correlates of depressive and anxiety disorder were estimated using logistic regression. RESULTS: There were high levels of depressive symptoms (41.9%) and anxiety symptoms (29.0%) in participants. Negative spiritual/religious coping was positively correlated with depressive disorder (odds ratio (OR) = 2.14 95% CI 1.63-2.80;P &lt; 0.001) and with anxiety disorder (OR = 2.46 95% CI 1.90-3.18;P &lt; 0.001), and associated with worse social and environmental QoL (P &lt; 0.001). Healthcare professionals were less likely to have depressive symptoms (OR = 0.71, 95% CI 0.55-0.93;P &lt; 0.001). Participants with friend/family with COVID-19 scored lower on psychological and environmental QoL (P &lt; 0.05). Participants with a longer duration of social isolation were less likely to experience anxiety disorder (OR = 0.99, 95% CI 0.98-0.99;P = 0.004). CONCLUSIONS: We found high levels of depressive and anxiety symptoms and low levels of QoL in Brazil, which has become a pandemic epicentre. Several characteristics were associated with negative mental health symptoms in this study.

205701,Action Steps Toward a Culture of Moral Resilience in the Face of COVID-19,2020,"Here, we report that COVID-19 hospitalization rates follow an exponential relationship with age, doubling for every 16 years of age or equivalently increasing by 4.5% per year of life (R2 = 0.98). This mirrors the well-studied exponential decline of both thymus volume and T-cell production, which halve every 16 years. COVID-19 can therefore be added to the list of other diseases with this property, including those caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, MERS-CoV, West Nile virus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and certain cancers, such as chronic myeloid leukaemia and brain cancers. In addition, the incidence of severe disease and mortality due to COVID-19 are both higher in men, consistent with the degree to which thymic involution (and the decrease in T-cell production with age) is more severe in men compared to women. Since these properties are shared with some non-contagious diseases, we hypothesized that the age dependence does not come from social-mixing patterns, i.e. that the probability of hospitalization given infection rises exponentially, doubling every 16 years. A Bayesian analysis of daily hospitalizations, incorporating contact matrices, found that this relationship holds for every age group except for the under 20s. While older adults have fewer contacts than young adults, our analysis suggests that there is an approximate cancellation between the effects of fewer contacts for the elderly and higher infectiousness due to a higher probability of developing severe disease. Our model fitting suggests under 20s have 49-75% additional immune protection beyond that predicted by strong thymus function alone, consistent with increased juvenile cross-immunity from other viruses. We found no evidence for differences between age groups in susceptibility to infection or infectiousness to others (given disease state), i.e. the only important factor in the age dependence of hospitalization rates is the probability of hospitalization given infection. These findings suggest the existence of a T-cell exhaustion threshold, proportional to thymic output and that clonal expansion of peripheral T-cells does not affect disease risk. The strikingly simple inverse relationship between risk and thymic T-cell output adds to the evidence that thymic involution is an important factor in the decline of the immune system with age and may also be an important clue in understanding disease progression, not just for COVID-19 but other diseases as well.","Palmer, Sam; Cunniffe, Nik; Donnelly, Ruairí",J R Soc Interface,,387
206075,Usable Security for ML Systems in Mental Health: A Framework,2020-08-18,"After major hurricanes, electric production is significantly reduced owing to not only electric infrastructure destruction, but also the economic crisis associated with damage to private and public activities. The full restoration of the electric infrastructure is not always simultaneously performed with the full restoration of electric production. Here, we describe the electric production curves for the islands of Saint-Martin, Saint-Barthelemy, and Puerto Rico in the Caribbean, where two major hurricanes occurred in 2017. After the major hurricanes, the electric energy production was characterised by a slow recovery followed by a stable phase during several months, corresponding to approximately $75\%$ of the initial electric production. A resilience time of several months (1 month $<t_s<$ 5 months) is necessary to attain the new electric energy production equilibrium $E_{is}$, which is lower than the initial electric energy production $E_i$. The reduction in electric energy consumption per capita is of $20-25\%$. In Saint-Martin, during the post-hurricane stable phase, the electric production was only approximately $60\%$ of the initial electric energy production instead of $75\%$. The reduction of 15 percent in the electric production of Saint-Martin after Hurricane Irma could be attributed to the migration of approximately 8 000 inhabitants (approximately $23\%$) outside the island. This approach makes it possible to anticipate the production of electricity during several months after a major hurricane in the Caribbean islands.","Gargani, Julien",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.10745v1.pdf,387

Most classes are moving online, and this includes medical school classes. The authors present their experience of running such online classes with offline clinical clerkship under pandemic conditions, and also present data on student satisfaction, academic performance, and preference. METHODS: The medical school changed every first-year to fourth-year course to an online format except the clinical clerkship, clinical skills training, and basic laboratory classes such as anatomy lab sessions. Online courses were pre-recorded video lectures or live-streamed using video communication software. At the end of each course, students and professors were asked to report their satisfaction with the online course and comment on it. The authors also compared students' academic performance before and after the introduction of online courses. RESULTS: A total of 69.7% (318/456) of students and 35.2% (44/125) of professors answered the questionnaire. Students were generally satisfied with the online course and 62.2% of them preferred the online course to the offline course. The majority (84.3%) of the students wanted to maintain the online course after the end of COVID-19. In contrast, just 13.6% of professors preferred online lectures and half (52.3%) wanted to go back to the offline course. With the introduction of online classes, students' academic achievement did not change significantly in four subjects, but decreased in two subjects. CONCLUSIONS: The inevitable transformation of medical education caused by COVID-19 is still ongoing. As the safety of students and the training of competent physicians are the responsibilities of medical schools, further research into how future physicians will be educated is needed.","Kim, Ju Whi; Myung, Sun Jung; Yoon, Hyun Bae; Moon, Sang Hui; Ryu, Hyunjin; Yim, Jae-Joon",PLoS One,,387

Wide surgical resection, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy are the most common sarcoma treatments. However, sarcomas' response rates to chemotherapy are quite low and sarcoma cells can have intrinsic or acquired resistance after treatment with chemotherapeutics drugs, leading to the development of multi-drug resistance (MDR). Cancer cellular plasticity plays pivotal roles in cancer initiation, progression, therapy resistance and cancer relapse. Moreover, cancer cellular plasticity can be regulated by a multitude of factors, such as genetic and epigenetic alterations, tumor microenvironment (TME) or selective pressure imposed by treatment. Recent studies have demonstrated that cellular plasticity is involved in sarcoma progression and chemoresistance. It's essential to understand the molecular mechanisms of cellular plasticity as well as its roles in sarcoma progression and drug resistance. Therefore, this review focuses on the regulatory mechanisms and pathological roles of these diverse cellular plasticity programs in sarcoma. Additionally, we propose cellular plasticity as novel therapeutic targets to reduce sarcoma drug resistance.","Lin, Zhengjun; Fan, Zhihua; Zhang, Xianghong; Wan, Jia; Liu, Tang",Life Sci,,387

N95 decontamination and re-use programmes provide one potential solution to this problem. Unfortunately, a comprehensive evaluation of the effects of decontamination on the fit of various N95 models using a quantitative fit test (QNFT) approach is lacking. AIMS: To investigate the effects of up to eight rounds of vaporized hydrogen peroxide (VHP) decontamination on the fit of N95 respirators currently in use in a hospital setting, and to examine if N95 respirators worn by one user can adapt to the face shape of a second user with no compromise to fit following VHP decontamination. METHODS: The PortaCount Pro+ Respirator Fit Tester Model 8038 was used to quantitatively define functional integrity, measured by fit, of N95 respirators following decontamination with VHP. FINDINGS: There was an observable downward trend in the functional integrity of Halyard Fluidshield 46727 N95 respirators throughout eight cycles of decontamination with VHP. Functional integrity of 3M 1870 N95 respirators was reduced significantly after the respirator was worn, decontaminated with VHP, and then quantitatively fit tested on a second user. Furthermore, inconsistencies between qualitative fit test and QNFT results were uncovered that may have strong implications on the fit testing method used by institutions. CONCLUSIONS: The data revealed variability in the functional integrity of different N95 models after VHP decontamination, and exposed potential limitations of N95 decontamination and re-use programmes.","Levine, C; Grady, C; Block, T; Hurley, H; Russo, R; Peixoto, B; Frees, A; Ruiz, A; Alland, D",J Hosp Infect,,387

Considering the relevance of present circumstances, we explored perceptions and attitudes of community members towards their mental well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic. SETTING: We conducted an exploratory qualitative study using a purposive sampling approach, at two communities of Karachi, Pakistan. PARTICIPANTS: In-depth interviews were conducted with community members including, young adults, middle-aged adults and older adults of both genders. Study data were analysed manually using the thematic analysis technique. PRIMARY OUTCOME: The primary outcome is assessing community perception towards their mental well-being amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: A total of 27 in-depth interviews were conducted, between May and June 2020. Three overarching themes were identified: (1) impact of COVID-19 on the mental health of the general communities; (2) current coping mechanisms to adapt to the new reality and (3) recommendations to address the mental health of communities. Generally, community members underwent increased anxiety and fear due to the contagious nature of the virus. Alongside, social, financial and religious repercussions of the pandemic have also heightened psychological distress among community members. However, community members were able to point out some of the coping mechanisms such as getting closer to God, connecting with family, participating in mental health sessions and resetting lives by indulging in diverse activities. Simultaneously, they also recommended the need for remote mental health services for elders and continuous efforts by the government to address the mental health needs of the community.

Although the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic necessitated cancellation of all in-person events across the university, the neonatal nurse practitioner students' learning needs remained the same. METHOD: The onsite experience was redesigned for virtual delivery. Procedural content was accomplished through student-led small-group collaborative critical thinking activities surrounding procedural complications, and other faculty-led scenario discussions. RESULTS: Students collaborated for a Complications Rounds activity (1-day) that promoted learning about procedural skills from a global perspective including safe techniques, monitoring, risks, and troubleshooting complications. CONCLUSION: Procedural content can be achieved when in-person learning is not possible. The Complications Rounds approach can mitigate delays or gaps in practical experiences. Examining complications in-depth increases preparedness, promoting greater awareness of harm prevention when these present in future practice.

A first ""school of thought"" advocates that what matters are only standard epidemiological variables (i.e. frequency of interactions in proportion of the viral charge). A second school of thought argues that co-factors such as quality of air play an important role too. METHODS: We analyzed available literature concerning the link between air quality, as measured by different pollutants and a number of COVID-19 outcomes, such as number of positive cases, deaths, and excess mortality rates. We reviewed several studies conducted worldwide and discussing many different methodological approaches aimed at investigating causality associations. RESULTS: Our paper reviewed the most recent empirical researches documenting the existence of a huge evidence produced worldwide concerning the role played by air pollution on health in general and on COVID-19 outcomes in particular. These results support both research hypotheses, i.e. long-term exposure effects and short-term consequences (including the hypothesis of particulate matter acting as viral ""carrier"") according to the two schools of thought, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The link between air pollution and COVID-19 outcomes is strong and robust as resulting from many different research methodologies.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common renal disorder characterized by a sudden and sustained decrease in renal function with a critical influence on poor prognosis and lethal clinical outcomes of various etiologies, including some viral infection diseases. It is known that oxidative stress and inflammation play key roles in the pathogenesis and development of AKI. Quercetin is a natural substance that has multiple pharmacological properties, such as anti-inflammatory action, and is used as a dietary supplement. There is evidence of the anti-coronavirus activities of this compound, including against the target SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro. The ability to inhibit coronavirus and its inflammatory processes is strongly desired in a new drug for the treatment of COVID-19. Therefore, in this review, the dual effect of quercetin is discussed from a mechanistic perspective in relation to AKI kidney injury and its nephroprotective potential to SARS-CoV-2 patients.","Diniz, Lúcio Ricardo Leite; Souza, Marilia Trindade de Santana; Duarte, Allana Brunna Sucupira; Sousa, Damião Pergentino de",Molecules (Basel),,387

The severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is related to the high rate of interhuman transmission of the virus, variability of clinical presentation, and the absence of specific therapeutic methods. COVID-19 can manifest with non-specific symptoms and signs, especially among the elderly. In some cases, the clinical manifestations of hyponatremia may be the first to appear. The pathophysiological mechanisms of hyponatremia among patients with COVID-19 are diverse, including syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH), digestive loss of sodium ions, reduced sodium ion intake or use of diuretic therapy. Hyponatremia may also be considered a negative prognostic factor in patients diagnosed with COVID-19. We need further studies to evaluate the etiology and therapeutic management of hyponatremia in patients with COVID-19.","Gheorghe, Gina; Ilie, Madalina; Bungau, Simona; Stoian, Anca Mihaela Pantea; Bacalbasa, Nicolae; Diaconu, Camelia Cristina",Medicina (Kaunas),,387

232958,Asian American mental health during COVID-19: A call for task-sharing interventions,2021,"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus outbreak (COVID-19) in China has influenced every aspect of life worldwide. Given the unique characteristics of the dental setting, the risk of cross-infection between dental practitioners and patients is high in the absence of adequate protective measures, and dentists may develop severe anxiety in relation to the current pandemic. The limited provision of services and widespread closure of dental practices have raised concerns among dental professionals about the financial impact. The present study assessed the frequency of dental practice closure during the pandemic's first wave in several countries and whether closures and their associated factors differ between the private and non-private sectors. METHODS: An electronic cross-sectional survey questionnaire was sent to dentists in several countries, from April to May 2020. The survey assessed professional, practice related and country-level structural factors elucidating the reason for practice closure. Multilevel logistic regression was used to assess the association between practice closure and these factors, and differences were evaluated by sector type. RESULTS: Dentists from 29 countries (n = 3243) participated in this study. Most of the participants (75.9%) reported practice closure with significantly higher percentage in the private sector than the non-private sector. Greater pandemic-related fears were associated with a significantly higher likelihood of practice closure in the private (odds ratio [OR] = 1.54, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.24, 1.92) and non-private (OR = 1.38, 95% CI 1.04, 1.82) sectors. Dentists in non-private rural areas (OR = 0.58, 95% CI 0.42, 0.81), and those in hospitals (overall OR = 0.60, 95% CI 0.36, 0.99) reported a low likelihood of closure. A high likelihood of closure was reported by dentists in the academia (OR = 2.13, 95% CI 1.23, 3.71). More hospital beds at the country-level were associated with a lower likelihood of closure in the non-private sector (OR = 0.65, 95% CI 0.46, 0.91). Private- sector dentists in high- income countries (HICs) reported fewer closures than those in non-HICs (OR = 0.55, 95% CI 0.15, 1.93). CONCLUSIONS: Most dentists reported practice closure because of COVID-19, and greater impacts were reported in the private sector than in the non-private sector. Closure was associated with professional, practice, and country-levels factors.","Abdelrahman, Hams; Atteya, Sara; Ihab, Merna; Nyan, Myat; Maharani, Diah A; Rahardjo, Anton; Shaath, Mohammed; Aboalshamat, Khalid; Butool, Syeda; Shamala, Anas; Baig, Lubna; El Tantawi, Maha",BMC Oral Health,,387
234151,Ensuring adequate capital investment in Canadian health care,2020,"BACKGROUND: The ongoing coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) is posing a threat to the public health globally. Serological test for SARS-CoV-2 antibody can improve early diagnosis of COVID-19 and serves as a valuable supplement to RNA detection. METHOD: A SARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgM combined antibody test strip based on colloidal gold immunochromatography assay was developed, with both spike protein and nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2 antigen used for antibody detection. From 3 medical institutions across China, serum or plasma of 170 patients with confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis and 300 normal controls were collected and tested with the strip. Sensitivity, specificity, kappa coefficient, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, and area under the curve (AUC) were analyzed. Positive rates in different medical centers, age group, gender, and different disease course were compared. RESULTS: 158 out 170 samples from confirmed COVID-19 patients had positive results from the test, and 296 out of 300 samples from normal controls had negative results. The kit was 92.9% sensitive and 98.7% specific. The positive rate was 77.3% during the first week after disease onset, but reached 100% since day 9. AUC and kappa coefficient were 0.958 and 0.926, respectively, which showed the consistency of the test results with the standard diagnosis. Age or gender caused little variations in the kit sensitivity. CONCLUSION: The rapid, easy-to-use SARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgM combined antibody test kit has a superior performance, which can help with accurate diagnosis and thus timely treatment and isolation of COVID-19 patients, that contributes to the better control of the global pandemic.","Liao, Mengting; Yan, Jiawei; Wang, Xinfeng; Qian, Huimin; Wang, Chao; Xu, Dan; Wang, Bin; Yang, Bo; Liu, Shaohui; Zhou, Mao; Gao, Qian; Zhou, Qian; Luo, Jiquan; Li, Zongxiang; Liu, Wenen",J Clin Lab Anal,,387

234268,"Across the COVID-19 Waves;Assessing Temporal Fluctuations in Perceived Stress, Post-Traumatic Symptoms, Worry, Anxiety and Civic-Moral Disengagement Over One Year of Pandemic (preprint)",2021,"Cyclodipeptide synthases (CDPSs) catalyze the synthesis of various cyclodipeptides by using two aminoacyl-tRNA (aa-tRNA) substrates in a sequential mechanism. Here, we studied binding of phenylalanyl-tRNAPhe to the CDPS from Candidatus Glomeribacter gigasporarum (Cglo-CDPS) by gel filtration and electrophoretic mobility shift assay. We determined the crystal structure of the Cglo-CDPS:Phe-tRNAPhe complex to 5 Å resolution and further studied it in solution using small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). The data show that the major groove of the acceptor stem of the aa-tRNA interacts with the enzyme through the basic ß2 and ß7 strands of CDPSs belonging to the XYP subfamily. A bending of the CCA extremity enables the amino acid moiety to be positioned in the P1 pocket while the terminal A76 adenosine occupies the P2 pocket. Such a positioning indicates that the present structure illustrates the binding of the first aa-tRNA. In cells, CDPSs and the elongation factor EF-Tu share aminoacylated tRNAs as substrates. The present study shows that CDPSs and EF-Tu interact with opposite sides of tRNA. This may explain how CDPSs hijack aa-tRNAs from canonical ribosomal protein synthesis.","Bourgeois, Gabrielle; Seguin, Jérôme; Babin, Morgan; Gondry, Muriel; Mechulam, Yves; Schmitt, Emmanuelle",RNA,,387

The present investigation was undertaken to screen and identify the potent leads from the Indian Ayurvedic herb, Asparagus racemosus (Willd.) against SARS-CoV-2 using molecular docking and dynamics studies. The docking analysis was performed on the Glide module of Schrödinger suite on two different proteins from SARS-CoV-2 viz. NSP15 Endoribonuclease and spike receptor-binding domain. Asparoside-C, Asparoside-D and Asparoside -F were found to be most effective against both the proteins as confirmed through their docking score and affinity. Further, the 100 ns molecular dynamics study also confirmed the potential of these compounds from reasonably lower root mean square deviations and better stabilization of Asparoside-C and Asparoside-F in spike receptor-binding domain and NSP15 Endoribonuclease respectively. MM-GBSA based binding free energy calculations also suggest the most favourable binding affinities of Asparoside-C and Asparoside-F with binding energies of -62.61 and -55.19 Kcal/mol respectively with spike receptor-binding domain and NSP15 Endoribonuclease.

This study examines associations of changing COVID-19-related employment conditions with physical activity and sedentary behavior. Methods: Data from 2,303 US adults in employment prior to COVID-19 were collected April 3rd-7th, 2020. Participants reported whether their employment remained unchanged, they were working from home (WFH) when they had not been before, or they lost their job due to the pandemic. Validated questionnaires assessed physical activity, sitting time, and screen time. Linear regression quantified associations of COVID-19-related employment changes with physical activity, sitting time, and screen time, controlling for age, sex, race, BMI, smoking status, marital status, chronic conditions, household location, public health restrictions, and recalled physical activity, sitting time, and screen time prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. Results: Compared to those whose employment remained unchanged, participants whose employment changed (either WFH or lost their job) due to COVID-19 reported higher sitting time (WFH: g = 0.153, 95% CI = 0.095-0.210; lost job: g = 0.212, 0.113-0.311) and screen time (WFH: g = 0.158, 0.104-0.212; lost job: g = 0.193, 0.102-0.285). There were no significant group differences for physical activity (WFH: g = -0.030, -0.101 to 0.042; lost job: g=-0.070, -0.178 to 0.037). Conclusion: COVID-19 related employment changes were associated with greater sitting and screen time. As sedentary time is consistently negatively associated with current and future health and wellbeing, increased sedentary time due to employment changes is a public health concern.","McDowell, Cillian P; Herring, Matthew P; Lansing, Jeni; Brower, Cassandra; Meyer, Jacob D",Front Public Health,,387

STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a multi-center, prospective observational cohort study from March 23, 2020 through June 1, 2020. We followed all women receiving either clarithromycin or no macrolide antibiotic for adjunct surgical prophylaxis for non-elective cesarean deliveries. The primary outcome was development of postpartum endometritis. Secondary outcomes included meconium-stained amniotic fluid at time of cesarean delivery, neonatal sepsis, neonatal intensive care unit admission, and neonatal acute respiratory distress syndrome. All patients in this study were tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection and resulted negative. RESULTS: This study included 240 patients, with 133 patients receiving clarithromycin and 107 patients receiving no adjunct macrolide prophylaxis. Patients receiving clarithromycin were noted to have significantly lower rates of postpartum endometritis as compared to those who did not receive adjunct prophylaxis (4.5% versus 11.2%, p = 0.025). In crude (unadjusted) analysis, a significantly lower risk of developing endometritis was noted in the clarithromycin group as compared to the control group (66% decreased risk, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.95, p = 0.040). When adjusted for perceived confounders, a significant difference was again noted (67% decreased risk, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.97, p = 0.034). Stratified analysis of significantly different demographic factors including Black race, BMI, and age was performed. A significantly decreased risk of development of endometritis when taking clarithromycin versus no adjunct macrolide was noted for Black race women in crude and adjusted models (crude: 87% decreased risk, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.83, p = 0.032; adjusted: 91% decreased risk, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.79, p = 0.026). This was also noted for women aged 18-29 years in crude and adjusted models (crude: model, 79% decreased risk, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.80, p = 0.014; adjusted model: 75% decreased risk, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.94, p = 0.028). All other stratified analyses did not yield significant differences in endometritis risk. CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that administration of clarithromycin for adjunctive surgical prophylaxis for non-elective cesarean deliveries may be a safe option that may provide suitable endometritis prophylaxis in cases where azithromycin is unavailable, as was the case during the start of COVID-19 pandemic, most especially for Black race women and women ages 18-29 years.","Martingano, Daniel; Nguyen, Ashley; Nkeih, Claudia; Singh, Shailini; Mitrofanova, Antonina",PLoS One,,387

245072,Health systems quickly vaccinated communities against COVID-19 despite supply constraints,2021,"Introduction: The mortality of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is frequently driven by an injurious immune response characterized by the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), endotheliitis, coagulopathy, and multi-organ failure. This spectrum of hyperinflammation in COVID-19 is commonly referred to as cytokine storm syndrome (CSS). Areas covered: Medline and Google Scholar were searched up until 15th of August 2020 for relevant literature. Evidence supports a role of dysregulated immune responses in the immunopathogenesis of severe COVID-19. CSS associated with SARS-CoV-2 shows similarities to the exuberant cytokine production in some patients with viral infection (e.g.SARS-CoV-1) and may be confused with other syndromes of hyperinflammation like the cytokine release syndrome (CRS) in CAR-T cell therapy. Interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha have emerged as predictors of COVID-19 severity and in-hospital mortality. Expert opinion: Despite similarities, COVID-19-CSS appears to be distinct from HLH, MAS, and CRS, and the application of HLH diagnostic scores and criteria to COVID-19 is not supported by emerging data. While immunosuppressive therapy with glucocorticoids has shown a mortality benefit, cytokine inhibitors may hold promise as 'rescue therapies' in severe COVID-19.

Expert opinion: Despite similarities, COVID-19-CSS appears to be distinct from HLH, MAS, and CRS, and the application of HLH diagnostic scores and criteria to COVID-19 is not supported by emerging data. While immunosuppressive therapy with glucocorticoids has shown a mortality benefit, cytokine inhibitors may hold promise as 'rescue therapies' in severe COVID-19. Given the arguably limited benefit in advanced disease, strategies to prevent the development of COVID-19-CSS are needed.","Amigues, Isabelle; Pearlman, Alexander H; Patel, Aarat; Reid, Pankti; Robinson, Philip C; Sinha, Rashmi; Kim, Alfred Hj; Youngstein, Taryn; Jayatilleke, Arundathi; Konig, Maximilian",Expert Rev Clin Immunol,,387

245582,"COVID-19 Fear, Mental Health, and Substance Misuse Conditions Among University Social Work Students in Israel and Russia",2020,"Purpose of Review: To highlight the challenges associated with providing sedation and analgesia to critically ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and also understand the pathophysiological alterations induced by the disease process as well as the logistical difficulties encountered by providers caring for these patients. We also discuss the rationale and risks associated with the use of common sedative agents specifically within the context of COVID-19 and provide evidence-based management strategies to help manage sedation and analgesia in such patients. Recent Findings: A significant proportion of patients with COVID-19 require intensive care and mechanical ventilation, thus requiring sedation and analgesia. These patients tend to require higher doses of sedative medications and often for long periods of time. Most of the commonly used sedative and analgesic agents carry unique risks that should be considered within the context of the unique pathophysiology of COVID-19, the logistical issues the disease poses, and the ongoing drug shortages. Summary: With little attention being paid to sedation practices specific to patients with COVID-19 in critical care literature and minimal mention in national guidelines, there is a significant gap in knowledge. We review the existing literature to discuss the unique challenges that providers face while providing sedation and analgesia to critically ill patients with COVID-19 and propose evidence-based management strategies.","Karamchandani, Kunal; Dalal, Rajeev; Patel, Jina; Modgil, Puneet; Quintili, Ashley",Curr Anesthesiol Rep,,387

245685,The mental health problems of public health center staff during the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan,2021,"OBJECTIVES: To model the effects of continuous, intermittent, and stepping-down social distancing (SD) strategies and personal protection measures on COVID-19 transmission dynamics. METHODS: Constant, intermittent, and stepping-down SD strategies were modeled at 4 mean magnitudes (5%, 10 %, 15 % and 20 %), 2 time windows (40-days, 80-days), and 2 levels of personal caution (30 % and 50 %). RESULTS: The stepping-down strategy was the best long-term SD strategy to minimize the peak number of active COVID-19 cases and associated deaths. The stepping-down strategy also resulted in a reduction in total time required to SD over a two-year period by 6.5 % compared to an intermittent or constant SD strategy. An 80-day SD time-window was statistically more effective in maintaining control over the COVID-19 pandemic than a 40-day window. However, the results were dependent upon 50 % of people being cautious (engaging in personal protection measures). CONCLUSION: If people exercise caution while in public by protecting themselves (e.g., wearing a facemask, proper hand hygiene and avoid agglomeration) the magnitude and duration of SD necessary to maintain control over the pandemic can be reduced. Our models suggest that the most effective way to reduce SD over a two-year period is a stepping-down approach every 80 days. According to our model, this method would prevent a second peak and the number of intensive care units needed per day would be within the threshold of those currently available.","Kennedy, Deanna M; Zambrano, Gustavo José; Wang, Yiyu; Neto, Osmar Pinto",J Clin Virol,,387

247165,Longitudinal Examination of COVID-19 Public Health Measures on Mental Health for Rural Patients With Serious Mental Illness,2020,"OBJECTIVES: For parents, family or clinicians of children with rare, life-threatening conditions there is little information regarding likely symptoms, illness trajectory and end-of-life care. This descriptive analysis of a bereaved cohort recruited in the Charting the Territory (CTT) study describes patient characteristics, symptoms, use of medications, discussion of resuscitation orders and care provided preceding and during the end-of-life. METHODS: Of the 275 children enrolled in the CTT study, 54 died between 2009 and 2014. Baseline demographic information, symptoms, interventions and medical information were collected via chart review, interviews and surveys. RESULTS: 51 of the 54 children had complete medical records. Of the seven symptoms evaluated, children were found to have an increase in median symptoms from baseline (n=2) to time of death (n=3). Opioids were used in the last 48 hours of life in 29 (56.9%) children, whereas only eight (15.7%) were receiving opioids at baseline. Do Not Attempt Resuscitation orders were in place at baseline in 17 (33.3%) children, increasing to 33 (64.7%) at time of death. Death occurred in a hospice setting in 16 (31.4%) children. CONCLUSIONS: While much emphasis on pediatric palliative care has been on supportive treatment and symptom management, when faced with a lack of sound understanding of a rare illness, the mode of care can often be reactive and based on critical needs. By developing greater knowledge of symptoms and illness trajectory, both management and care can be more responsive and anticipatory, thereby helping ease illness burden and suffering.","Bao, Danielle; Feichtinger, Leanne; Andrews, Gail; Pawliuk, Colleen; Steele, Rose; Siden, Harold Hal",J. pain symptom manage,,387

It is not known whether as pre-exposure prophylaxis it may prevent COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: To compare the incidence of COVID-19 in Spanish patients with autoimmune rheumatic diseases treated with and without hydroxychloroquine. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Retrospective electronic record review, from February 27th to June 21st, 2020, of patients with autoimmune inflammatory diseases followed at two academic tertiary care hospitals in Seville, Spain. The cumulative incidence of confirmed COVID-19, by PCR or serology, was compared between patients with and without hydroxychloroquine as part of their treatment of autoimmune inflammatory diseases. RESULTS: Among 722 included patients, 290 (40%) were receiving hydroxychloroquine. During the seventeen-week study period, 10 (3.4% [95% CI: 1.7%-6.7%] cases of COVID-19 were registered among patients with hydroxychloroquine and 13 (3.0% [1.6%-5.1%]) (p = 0.565) in those without hydroxychloroquine. COVID-19 was diagnosed by PCR in four (1.4%, 95% CI 0.38%-3.5%) subject with hydroxychloroquine and six (1.4%, 95% CI 0.5%-3.0%) without hydroxychloroquine (p = 0.697). Three patients on hydroxychloroquine and four patients without hydroxychloroquine were admitted to the hospital, none of them required to be transferred to the intensive care unit and no patient died during the episode. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence and severity of COVID-19 among patients with autoimmune rheumatic diseases with and without hydroxychloroquine was not significantly different.","Macías, Juan; González-Moreno, Paz; Sánchez-García, Esther; Morillo-Verdugo, Ramón; Pérez-Venegas, José J; Pinilla, Ana; Macho, MªMar; Martínez, MªVictoria; González-Serna, Alejandro; Corma, Anaïs; Real, Luis M; Pineda, Juan A",PLoS One,,387

Delivering all doses of drugs on the day before procedure did not affect the quality of bowel preparation for afternoon lists. There is a trend to a higher proportion of children with HBP receiving IV fluids during anaesthetic which may suggest that some are dehydrated. The proportion of day case procedures has increased from 0% to 72%, which since March 2020, has saved NHS Grampian £18,000.ConclusionHome bowel preparation delivered on day prior to procedure is well tolerated and as effective as inpatient delivered, even for children with long travelling times to hospital. Covid-19 distancing measures have reduced the number of available inpatient beds so HBP has aided bed management in addition to providing a cost saving. The risk of dehydration may be higher for HBP and guidance will be changed to increase the emphasis on oral fluid intake, including during travelling time, on day of procedure.","Motion, Jamie Sutherland Malcolm Smart Brenda Cameron Carol Kishore Shyla Chalmers Iain Bunn Su",Frontline Gastroenterology,,387

The study sought to evaluate the diagnostic performance of chest CT in the diagnosis and management of COVID-19 in ED. METHODS: This retrospective single-center study included 155 patients in ED who underwent both RT-PCR and chest CT for suspected COVID-19 from March 1st to April 1st, 2020. The clinical information, CT images and laboratory reports were reviewed and the performance of CT was assessed, using the RT-PCR as standard reference. Moreover, an adjudication committee retrospectively rated the probability of COVID-19 before and after the CT calculating the net reclassification improvement (NRI). Their final diagnosis was considered as reference. The proportion of patients with negative RT-PCR test that was directed to the referent hospital based on positive CT findings was also assessed. RESULTS: Among 155 patients, 42% had positive RT-PCR results, and 46% had positive CT findings. Chest CT showed a sensitivity of 84.6%, a specificity of 80.0% and a diagnostic accuracy of 81.9% in suggesting COVID-19 with RT-PCR as reference. Concurrently, corresponding values of 89.4%, 84.3% and 86.5% were retrieved with the adjudication committee diagnosis as reference. For the subgroup of patients with age > 65, specificity and sensitivity were 50% and 80.8%, respectively. In patients with negative RT-PCR results, 20% (18/90) had positive chest CT finding and 22% (4/18) of those were eventually considered as COVID-19 positive according to the adjudication committee. After CT, the estimated probability of COVID-19 changed in 10/104 (11%) patients with available data: 4 (4%) were downgraded, 6 (6%) upgraded. The NRI was 1.92% (NRI event -2.08% + NRI non-event 5.36%). No patient with negative RT-PCR but positive CT was eventually directed to hospital. CONCLUSION: Chest CT showed promising sensitivity for diagnosing COVID-19 across all patients' subgroups. However, CT did not modify the estimated probability of COVID-19 infection in a substantial proportion of patients and its utility as an emergency department triage tool warrants further analyses.","Skalidis, Ioannis; Nguyen, Vinh Kim; Bothorel, Hugo; Poli, Lauriane; Da Costa, Rui Ribeiro; Younossian, Alain Bigin; Petriccioli, Nicole; Kherad, Omar",Am. j. emerg. med,,387
256124,Medical Council of India module on pandemic management: Neglecting mental health training a major lacuna,2020,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has led to government enforced 'lockdown' in the UK severely limiting face-to-face patient interaction. Virtual consultations present a means for continued patient access to health care. Our aim was to evaluate the use of virtual consultations (VCons) during lockdown and their possible role in the future. METHODS: An anonymous survey was disseminated to UK and European plastic surgeons via social media, email sharing and via the European Association of Societies of Aesthetic Plastic Surgery newsletter. Uptake of VCons, modality, effectiveness, safety and future utility were assessed. RESULTS: Forty-three senior plastic surgeons responded to the survey. The majority of the respondents (97.7%) reported using VCons during COVID-19 lockdown, of which 74.4% had no prior experience. Two-thirds of surgeons utilised commercial platforms such as Zoom, FaceTime and Skype, 38.1% of respondents did not know about or were unsure about adequate encryption for health care use, and just under a half (47.6%) reported they were unaware of or lacking GDPR compliance. Most (97.6%) say they are likely to use virtual consultations after lockdown. CONCLUSION: Virtual consultations have had a crucial role in patient care during UK lockdown. It is clear that they will serve as an adjunct to face-to-face consultation in the future. Further regulation is required to ensure platforms offer adequate safety and security measures and are compliant with relevant data protection laws.

A difficulty for this pro-life position has been Judith Jarvis Thomson's violinist analogy, in which she argues that even if the fetus is a person, abortion is often permissible because a pregnant woman is not obliged to continue to offer her body as life support. Here, we outline the moral theories underlying public health ethics, and examine the COVID-19 pandemic as an example of public health considerations overriding individual rights. We argue that if fetuses are regarded as persons, then abortion is of such prevalence in society that it also constitutes a significant public health crisis. We show that on public health considerations, we are justified in overriding individual rights to bodily autonomy by prohibiting abortion. We conclude that in a society that values public health, abortion can only be tolerated if fetuses are not regarded as persons.","Blackshaw, Bruce; Rodger, Daniel",Bioethics,,387

Because this manoeuvre is related to several complications, it must be performed in a protocolized manner by the appropriate personnel. AIM: To determine the prevalence of adverse events (AEs) in patients admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of COVID-19-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (C-ARDS) undergoing mechanical ventilation in prone position (PP). DESIGN: Descriptive ambispective study of patients admitted to the ICU diagnosed with C-ARDS undergoing mechanical ventilation who were in the PP at least once. The number of PP manoeuvres and the time spent in the PP were recorded for each subject. AEs proportions and frequencies were calculated, and analysis of variance was used to assess mean differences in the number of manoeuvres and total hours in PP stratified by the number of facial pressure ulcers. IBM SPSS Statistics v.25.0. and EPIDAT 4.1 software were used. RESULTS: Forty-four patients were analysed, and 130 PP manoeuvres were performed. The most frequently observed AEs were facial oedema in 26 patients (80.3%) and facial pressure ulcers in 20 (60.6%). There was a significant positive association between the time spent in PP and the development of facial pressure ulcers (P < .001). Enteral nutrition was well tolerated, and no serious AEs or sentinel events were noted. DISCUSSION: Despite the stressful, demanding situation during the peak of the pandemic, the large number of PP manoeuvres, and long duration spent in this position, no serious AEs occurred. This study highlights the need to implement preventive measures to avoid the development of pressure ulcers secondary to prone positioning. RELEVANCE TO PRACTICE: Prone positioning requires a nursing protocol to prevent the occurrence of AEs that may reduce the quality of nursing care.","Rodríguez-Huerta, María Dolores; Díez-Fernández, Ana; Rodríguez-Alonso, María Jesús; Robles-González, María; Martín-Rodríguez, María; González-García, Alberto",Nurs. crit. care,,387
256933,From the frontlines to centre stage: resilience of frontline health workers in the context of COVID-19,2020,"Early warning signals (EWS) identify systems approaching a critical transition, where the system undergoes a sudden change in state. For example, monitoring changes in variance or autocorrelation offers a computationally inexpensive method which can be used in real-time to assess when an infectious disease transitions to elimination. EWS have a promising potential to not only be used to monitor infectious diseases, but also to inform control policies to aid disease elimination. Previously, potential EWS have been identified for prevalence data, however the prevalence of a disease is often not known directly. In this work we identify EWS for incidence data, the standard data type collected by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) or World Health Organization (WHO). We show, through several examples, that EWS calculated on simulated incidence time series data exhibit vastly different behaviours to those previously studied on prevalence data. In particular, the variance displays a decreasing trend on the approach to disease elimination, contrary to that expected from critical slowing down theory; this could lead to unreliable indicators of elimination when calculated on real-world data. We derive analytical predictions which can be generalised for many epidemiological systems, and we support our theory with simulated studies of disease incidence. Additionally, we explore EWS calculated on the rate of incidence over time, a property which can be extracted directly from incidence data. We find that although incidence might not exhibit typical critical slowing down properties before a critical transition, the rate of incidence does, presenting a promising new data type for the application of statistical indicators.","Southall, Emma; Tildesley, Michael J; Dyson, Louise",PLoS Comput Biol,,387

METHODS: The study was performed among students and workers of the University of Campania ""Luigi Vanvitelli"" and the relative Teaching Hospital. Participants were invited to undergo a blood sampling, an interview or to complete a self-administered questionnaire. RESULTS: A total of 140 participants (5.8%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Positive SARS-CoV-2 test results increased significantly during the months of testing, and those who had had at least one symptom among fever, cough, dyspnea, loss of taste or smell and who had had contact with a family member/cohabitant with confirmed COVID-19 were more likely to test positive. Faculty members were less likely to have a positive test result compared to the healthcare workers (HCWs). Among HCWs, physicians showed the lowest rate of seroconversion (5.2%) compared to nurses (8.9%) and other categories (10%). Nurses and other HCWs compared to the physicians, those who had had at least one symptom among fever, cough, dyspnea, loss of taste or smell, and who had had contact with a family member/cohabitant with confirmed COVID-19 were more likely to test positive.

259318,"Concern for Covid-19 cough, fever and impact on mental health. What about risk of Somatic Symptom Disorder?",2021,"OBJECTIVES: Both the political appetite for a science-based coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) policy and its acceptability to the public are little understood, at a time of sharp distrust not only of governments but also of scientists and their journals' review practices. We studied the case of France, where the independent Scientific Council on COVID-19 was appointed by President Macron on March 12, 2020. STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a survey on a representative sample of the French adult population. METHODS: Our data were collected by the French Institute of Public Opinion using a self-administered online questionnaire. This was completed by a sample of 1016 people stratified to match French official census statistics for gender, age, occupation, and so on. We conducted statistical analysis using Python (Pandas-SciPy-Statsmodels) with Chi-squared and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests to control for statistical significance. RESULTS: Intense media coverage has given the council a very high public profile, with three respondents out of four (73%) having heard about it. Perceptions are positive but complex. French citizens expect science to be important in political decision-making. Four of five (81.5%) want political decisions, in general, to be based on scientific knowledge. But one in two (55%) says that the government has not relied enough on science and only 36% are satisfied with the government's crisis management to date. Although most feel that the council has a legitimate advisory role even in situations of uncertainty (only 15% disagree), it is not perceived as fully independent. Only 44% think that it directly represents the scientific community, and only one of three people considers it completely independent from the government (39%) and the pharmaceutical industry (36%). CONCLUSIONS: Our study confirms that while the transparency of scientific advice is important, it alone cannot ensure public confidence in political decision-making. We suggest that efforts made today to instill a 'science-savvy' public culture-one that allows the complex articulation between scientific knowledge, uncertainty, and political decision-making to be understood and accounted for would greatly benefit evidence-based policy in future crises.","Schultz, É; Ward, J K",Public Health,,387
260294,Penn Medicine Lancaster General Health's Ambulatory Care Evolution,2020,"Currently, the world is in the seventh month of the COVID-19 pandemic. Globally, infections with novel SARS-CoV-2 virus are continuously rising with mounting numbers of deaths. International and local public health responses, almost in synchrony, imposed restrictions to minimize spread of the virus, overload of health system capacity, and deficit of personal protective equipment (PPE). Although in most cases the symptoms are mild or absent, SARS-CoV-2 infection can lead to serious acute respiratory disease and multisystem failure. The research community responded to this new disease with a high level of transparency and data sharing; with the aim to better understand the origin, pathophysiology, epidemiology and clinical manifestations. The ultimate goal of this research is to develop vaccines for prevention, mitigation strategies, as well as potential therapeutics.The aim of this review is to summarize current knowledge regarding the novel SARS CoV-2, including its pathophysiology and epidemiology, as well as, what is known about the potential impact of COVID-19 on reproduction, fertility care, pregnancy and neonatal outcome. This summary also evaluates the effects of this pandemic on reproductive care and research, from Canadian perspective, and discusses future implications.In summary, reported data on pregnant women is limited, suggesting that COVID-19 symptoms and severity of the disease during pregnancy are similar to those in non-pregnant women, with pregnancy outcomes closely related to severity of maternal disease. Evidence of SARS-CoV-2 effects on gametes is limited. Human reproduction societies have issued guidelines for practice during COVID-19 pandemic that include implementation of mitigation practices and infection control protocols in fertility care units. In Canada, imposed restrictions at the beginning of the pandemic were successful in containing spread of the infection, allowing for eventual resumption of assisted reproductive treatments under new guidelines for practice. Canada dedicated funds to support COVID-19 research including a surveillance study to monitor outcomes of COVID-19 during pregnancy and assisted reproduction. Continuous evaluation of new evidence must be in place to carefully adjust recommendations on patient management during assisted reproductive technologies (ART) and in pregnancy.","Madjunkov, Mitko; Dviri, Michal; Librach, Clifford",J Ovarian Res,,387

262976,Call for clarity on protective equipment,2020,"Simulating the spread of infectious diseases in human communities is critical for predicting the trajectory of an epidemic and verifying various policies to control the devastating impacts of the outbreak. Many existing simulators are based on compartment models that divide people into a few subsets and simulate the dynamics among those subsets using hypothesized differential equations. However, these models lack the requisite granularity to study the effect of intelligent policies that influence every individual in a particular way. In this work, we introduce a simulator software capable of modeling a population structure and controlling the disease's propagation at an individualistic level. In order to estimate the confidence of the conclusions drawn from the simulator, we employ a comprehensive probabilistic approach where the entire population is constructed as a hierarchical random variable. This approach makes the inferred conclusions more robust against sampling artifacts and gives confidence bounds for decisions based on the simulation results. To showcase potential applications, the simulator parameters are set based on the formal statistics of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the outcome of a wide range of control measures is investigated. Furthermore, the simulator is used as the environment of a reinforcement learning problem to find the optimal policies to control the pandemic. The obtained experimental results indicate the simulator's adaptability and capacity in making sound predictions and a successful policy derivation example based on real-world data. As an exemplary application, our results show that the proposed policy discovery method can lead to control measures that produce significantly fewer infected individuals in the population and protect the health system against saturation.","Mehrjou, Arash; Soleymani, Ashkan; Abyaneh, Amin; Bhatt, Samir; Scholkopf, Bernhard; Bauer, Stefan",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.15561v2.pdf,387

COVID-19 is associated with a set of coagulation abnormalities that increase the risk of thromboembolic events, especially in patients with severe/critical disease. We describe a series of five cases of mild COVID-19, treated in an outpatient clinic, which, after an apparent clinical improvement, developed acute pulmonary embolism (APE) between the third and the fourth week after the onset of symptoms, when they are mostly related to acute illness disappearance. Thromboembolic events are also a potential complication of mild COVID-19 and can manifest later in the disease course. This finding raises discussion about the prevention of thromboembolic events in selected group of patients with mild COVID-19.","Vechi, Hareton Teixeira; Maia, Lucas Rodrigues; Alves, Manoella do Monte",Rev Inst Med Trop Sao Paulo,,387

269147,Impact of COVID-19 on the health and psychosocial status of vulnerable older adults: study protocol for an observational study,2020,"Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), a gamma-coronavirus, causes infectious bronchitis (IB), a major respiratory disease of chicken. Its high mutation rate in conjunction with recombination of the RNA genome constantly creates IBV variants that are difficult to control by currently available vaccines. In this study, we addressed the question whether small-scale holdings might harbor IBV variants that serve as a reservoir for newly emerging variants. Egyptian IBV isolate EGY/NR725/2016 (NR725/16) from a small-scale broiler farm was assigned to genotype I, clade 23 (S1:GI-23), based on partial S1 gene sequences and corroborated by full genome sequencing. Analysis of the S1 gene established three subclades for historical IBV strains (S1:GI-23.1, S1:GI-23.2.1 and S1:GI-23.2.2) and confirmed NR725/16 as being part of a separate fourth subclade (S1:GI-23.3). Samples from the years 2018 and 2019 revealed that the new subclade prevails in Egypt, carrying fixed mutations within the hypervariable regions (HVR) 1-3 of the S1 protein that affect two neutralization sensitive epitopes at sites 294F, 297S and 306Y (48.2) and 329R (62.1). In addition, recombination was recognized in isolate NR 725/16, with intra-subtype mixing for the entire genes 3ab and E and inter-subtype mixing for the entire gene 6b with a close match to QX like viruses of genotype GI-19. Further analysis of gene 3ab detected the homologous gene pool to NR725/16 in samples from 2013 (3ab:C) and closely related 3ab genotypes in IBV Egyptian isolates from 2016, 2018 and 2019. These data prove a flourishing exchange between poultry holdings with a common gene pool. The continued circulation of viruses harboring genes S1:GI-23.3 and 3ab:C indicates an evolutionary advantage of this combination possibly by combining antigenic escape with modulated pathogenicity to facilitate IBV spread in the vaccinated poultry population in Egypt.","Moharam, Ibrahim; Sultan, Hesham; Hassan, K; Ibrahim, Mahmoud; Shany, Salama; Shehata, Awad A; Abo-ElKhair, Mohammed; Pfaff, Florian; Höper, Dirk; El Kady, Magdy; Beer, Martin; Harder, Timm; Hafez, Hafez; Grund, Christian",Infect Genet Evol,,387

The east Texas region suffers from some of the poorest internet availability in the nation. Thus, limitations exist for streaming lectures or having students download large files. Podcasts are small audio files that can be downloaded from the internet for learning. Research has shown that the use of lecture podcasts have a variety of benefits for both faculty and students. Lecture podcasts provide students small file sizes to download and access and allow them to engage with the course material asynchronously. Therefore, the decision was made to record lecture podcasts for Cultivating Plants, Plant Propagation, and Plant Breeding to deliver educational content for the class. An end of semester survey conducted by the SFASU Agriculture Department indicated that 59% of students who engaged with this type of learning felt it was extremely effective. Additional student comments and semester reflections also provided feedback. This example provides further evidence that lecture podcasts can be a useful tool for educators in an ever-changing world.

Recently, TMEM41B was identified as a crucial host factor for infection by all coronaviruses and flaviviruses. The molecular function of TMEM41B and VMP1, which belong to a large evolutionarily conserved family, remains elusive. Here, we show that TMEM41B and VMP1 are phospholipid scramblases whose deficiency impairs the normal cellular distribution of cholesterol and phosphatidylserine. Their mechanism of action on LD formation is likely to be different from that of seipin. Their role in maintaining cellular phosphatidylserine and cholesterol homeostasis may partially explain their requirement for viral infection.

Substantial and unprecedented progress has been made in the elucidation of the viral infection process in a short time; however, our understanding of the structure-function dynamics of the spike protein during the membrane fusion process and viral uptake remains incomplete. Employing computational approaches, we use full-length structural models of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein integrating Cryo-EM images and biophysical properties, which fill the gaps in our understanding. We propose a membrane fusion model incorporating structural transitions associated with the proteolytic processing of the spike protein, which initiates and regulates a series of events to facilitate membrane fusion and viral genome uptake. The membrane fusion mechanism highlights the notable role of the S1 subunit and eventual mature spike protein uptake through the host membrane. Our comprehensive view accounts for distinct neutralizing antibody binding effects targeting the spike protein and the enhanced infectivity of the SARS-CoV-2 variant.","Nishima, Wataru; Kulik, Marta",Viruses,,387

The first such interaction is the recognition of viral envelope proteins by surface receptors that normally fulfil other physiological roles, a hijacking mechanism perfected over the course of evolution. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiological agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has successfully adopted this strategy using its spike glycoprotein to dock on the membrane-bound metalloprotease angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The crystal structures of several SARS-CoV-2 proteins alone or in complex with their receptors or other ligands were recently solved at an unprecedented pace. This accomplishment is partly due to the increasing availability of data on other coronaviruses and ACE2 over the past 18 years. Likewise, other key intervening actors and mechanisms of viral infection were elucidated with the aid of biophysical approaches.

At present, there is still no standardized diagnostic criteria and treatment regimen for PMIS, while the etiology and pathogenesis still remain unclear. METHODS: We performed a systematic review on PubMed and Embase from the time of inception to June 24th 2020 in order to find relevant cases. RESULTS: There are seven studies included, and 80% of patients suffered persistent fever and 90% appeared gastrointestinal symptoms. IgG antibody against SARS-CoV-2 was positive on 81% of patients, while 37% of the patients were nucleic acid positive. C-reactive protein, IL-6 and PCT were elevated and intravenous immunoglobulin was a routine treatment for PMIS. There were more than half of patients required inotropic supports and mechanical ventilation were applied to 33% of patients. The median length of hospital stay was 10.66 days and 74% had admitted to accept intensive care. CONCLUSIONS: Our study documented three common types of PMIS clinical presentation: persistent fever and gastrointestinal symptoms, shocked with heart dysfunction and Kawasaki disease-like syndrome. PMIS patients proved with a marked inflammatory state were possibly associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Zou, Hua; Lu, Juan; Liu, Jingjing; Wong, Josiah Hiu-Yuen; Cheng, Si; Li, Qiuhong; Shen, Yan; Li, Chunli; Jia, Xiaojiong",Int J Infect Dis,,387

Digital interventions may help to mitigate these effects. We investigated the associations between social isolation, COVID-19-related cognitive preoccupation, worries, and anxiety, objective social risk indicators, and psychological distress, as well as use of, and attitude toward, mobile health (mHealth) interventions in youth. METHODS: Data were collected as part of the ""Mental Health And Innovation During COVID-19 Survey""-a cross-sectional panel study including a representative sample of individuals aged 16-25 years (N = 666; Mage = 21.3; assessment period: May 5, 2020 to May 16, 2020). RESULTS: Overall, 38% of youth met criteria for moderate or severe psychological distress. Social isolation worries and anxiety, and objective risk indicators were associated with psychological distress, with evidence of dose-response relationships for some of these associations. For instance, psychological distress was progressively more likely to occur as levels of social isolation increased (reporting ""never"" as reference group: ""occasionally"": adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 9.1, 95% confidence interval [CI] 4.3-19.1, p < 0.001; ""often"": aOR 22.2, CI 9.8-50.2, p < 0.001; ""very often"": aOR 42.3, CI 14.1-126.8, p < 0.001). There was evidence that psychological distress, worries, and anxiety were associated with a positive attitude toward using mHealth interventions, whereas psychological distress, worries, and anxiety were associated with actual use. CONCLUSIONS: Public health measures during pandemics may be associated with poor mental health outcomes in youth. Evidence-based digital interventions may help mitigate the negative psychosocial impact without risk of viral infection given there is an objective need and subjective demand.","Rauschenberg, Christian; Schick, Anita; Goetzl, Christian; Roehr, Susanne; Riedel-Heller, Steffi G; Koppe, Georgia; Durstewitz, Daniel; Krumm, Silvia; Reininghaus, Ulrich",Eur Psychiatry,,387
284029,When lockdown policies amplify social inequalities in COVID-19 infections: evidence from a cross-sectional population-based survey in France,2021,"Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has changed the lives of families in an unprecedented way. During the first lockdown, extrafamilial contact was significantly reduced. Many parents had to look after their children and work from home while the economic pressure increased. Objective: The aim of the present study was to investigate the association between intimate partner violence (IPV) and mental health problems in children and adolescents before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Material and methods: In a cross-sectional online survey 687 parents of underaged children in Germany were included. Demographic and psychosocial predictors for IPV and associations with mental health problems of children before and during the first lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic were assessed. The survey ran from 18 May 2020 to 21 July 2020 and the lockdown in Germany began on 23 March 2020 and ended via a gradual relaxation. The first schools reopened on 22 April and the opening of schools, kindergartens and daycare centers extended to the end of June 2020. Results: Lower household incomes and the experience of own adverse childhood experiences increased the risk of participants reporting violence in their relationship. According to the participating parents, children and adolescents living in families in which violence was reported by intimate partners were more likely to have higher levels of externalizing problems before and during the pandemic. There were no significant differences with respect to emotional problems. Conclusion: Adverse childhood experiences increase the risk of intimate partner violence, which in turn increases the risk of mental health problems in the children. Therefore, in the psychotherapeutic practice questions should also be systematically asked about corresponding experiences and appropriate treatment offers should be recommended.","Clemens, Vera; Köhler-Dauner, Franziska; Keller, Ferdinand; Ziegenhain, Ute; Fegert, Jörg M; Kölch, Michael",Psychotherapeut (Berl),,387

The current work aims to precisely characterize the renal impairment associated to SARS-CoV-2 in ICU patients. Forty-two patients consecutively admitted to the ICU of a French university hospital who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 between 25 March 2020, and 29 April 2020, were included and classified in categories according to their renal function. Complete renal profiles and evolution during ICU stay were fully characterized in 34 patients. Univariate analyses were performed to determine risk factors associated with AKI. In a second step, we conducted a logistic regression model with inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) analyses to assess major comorbidities as predictors of AKI. Thirty-two patients (94.1%) met diagnostic criteria for intrinsic renal injury with a mixed pattern of tubular and glomerular injuries within the first week of ICU admission, which lasted upon discharge. During their ICU stay, 24 patients (57.1%) presented AKI which was associated with increased mortality (p = 0.007), hemodynamic failure (p = 0.022), and more altered clearance at hospital discharge (p = 0.001).

292301,Pediatric Mental Healthcare Providers’ Perceptions of the Delivery of Partial Hospitalization and Outpatient Services via Telehealth during the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) with substantial cardiovascular implications. Although infection with SARS-CoV-2 is usually mild in children, some children later develop a severe inflammatory disease that can have manifestations similar to toxic shock syndrome or Kawasaki disease. This syndrome has been defined by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children. Although the prevalence is unknown, >600 cases have been reported in the literature. Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children appears to be more common in Black and Hispanic children in the United States. Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children typically occurs a few weeks after acute infection and the putative etiology is a dysregulated inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Persistent fever and gastrointestinal symptoms are the most common symptoms. Cardiac manifestations are common, including ventricular dysfunction, coronary artery dilation and aneurysms, arrhythmia, and conduction abnormalities. Severe cases can present as vasodilatory or cardiogenic shock requiring fluid resuscitation, inotropic support, and in the most severe cases, mechanical ventilation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Empirical treatments have aimed at reversing the inflammatory response using immunomodulatory medications. Intravenous immunoglobulin, steroids, and other immunomodulatory agents have been used frequently. Most patients recover within days to a couple of weeks and mortality is rare, although the medium- and long-term sequelae, particularly cardiovascular complications, are not yet known. This review describes the published data on multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, focusing on cardiac complications, and provides clinical considerations for cardiac evaluation and follow-up.","Alsaied, Tarek; Tremoulet, Adriana H; Burns, Jane C; Saidi, Arwa; Dionne, Audrey; Lang, Sean M; Newburger, Jane W; de Ferranti, Sarah; Friedman, Kevin G",Circulation,,387
292690,Ambulatory Care Hastens Its Transformation into the Future,2020,"BACKGROUND: The severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is highly heterogeneous. Studies have reported that males and some ethnic groups are at increased risk of death from COVID-19, which implies that individual risk of death might be influenced by host genetic factors. METHODS: In this project, we consider the mortality as the trait of interest and perform a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of data for 1778 infected cases (445 deaths, 25.03%) distributed by the UK Biobank. Traditional GWAS fails to identify any genome-wide significant genetic variants from this dataset. To enhance the power of GWAS and account for possible multi-loci interactions, we adopt the concept of super variant for the detection of genetic factors. A discovery-validation procedure is used for verifying the potential associations. RESULTS: We find 8 super variants that are consistently identified across multiple replications as susceptibility loci for COVID-19 mortality. The identified risk factors on chromosomes 2, 6, 7, 8, 10, 16, and 17 contain genetic variants and genes related to cilia dysfunctions (DNAH7 and CLUAP1), cardiovascular diseases (DES and SPEG), thromboembolic disease (STXBP5), mitochondrial dysfunctions (TOMM7), and innate immune system (WSB1). It is noteworthy that DNAH7 has been reported recently as the most downregulated gene after infecting human bronchial epithelial cells with SARS-CoV-2. CONCLUSIONS: Eight genetic variants are identified to significantly increase the risk of COVID-19 mortality among the patients with white British ancestry. These findings may provide timely clues and potential directions for better understanding the molecular pathogenesis of COVID-19 and the genetic basis of heterogeneous susceptibility, with potential impact on new therapeutic options.","Hu, Jianchang; Li, Cai; Wang, Shiying; Li, Ting; Zhang, Heping",Hum Genomics,,387

Five pharmacists have been appointed as members of an expert interdisciplinary health care team tasked with taking care of all adult COVID-19 patients in Shanghai in a designated hospital, the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center (SPHCC). They work with pharmacists at SPHCC, having responsibilities that include drug supplies, dispensing, pharmacy intravenous admixture services (PIVAS), prescription audits, medication reconciliations, pharmacotherapy, therapeutic drug monitoring, and patient education. Due to the pandemic, pharmacy operations in all hospitals are modified to adhere to guidelines for infection risk mitigation and personnel protection. Community pharmacies serve as the public access point to health care and medical supplies, providing services beyond dispensing and medication counselling. The establishment of internet hospitals (telehealth facilities) provide new opportunities for delivering pharmaceutical care and working with health care professionals. Pharmacists also participate in evaluating new treatments and keeping health care teams informed of new findings for potential treatment considerations.

298267,Mental health impacts among health workers during COVID-19 in a low resource setting: a cross-sectional survey from Nepal,2020,"Background: COVID-19 exposed undergraduate medical education curricular gaps in exploring historical pandemics, how to critically consume scientific literature and square it with the lay press, and how to grapple with emerging ethical issues. In addition, as medical students were dismissed from clinical environments, their capacity to build community and promote professional identity formation was compromised. Methods: A synchronous, online course entitled Life Cycle of a Pandemic was developed using a modified guided inquiry approach. Students met daily for 2 weeks in groups of 15 to 18 with a process facilitator. During the first week, students reported on lessons learned from past pandemics; in the second week, students discussed ethical concerns surrounding COVID-19 clinical trials, heard from physicians who provided patient care in the HIV and COVID-19 pandemics, and concluded with an opportunity for reflection. Following the course, students were asked to complete an anonymous, voluntary survey to assess their perceptions of the course. Results: With a response rate of 69%, an overwhelming majority of students agreed or strongly agreed that learning about historical pandemics helped them understand COVID-19 (72, 99%). The course successfully helped students understand current and potential COVID-19 management strategies as 66 (90%) agreed or strongly agreed they developed a better understanding of nonpharmacological interventions and new pharmacological treatments. Students also gained insight into the experiences of healthcare providers who cared for patients with HIV and COVID-19. Qualitative analysis of the open-ended comments yielded 5 main themes: critical appraisal of resources, responsibility of the physician, humanism, knowledge related to pandemics, and learning from history. Conclusions: The onset of the COVID-19 crisis illustrated curricular gaps that could be remedied by introducing the history and biology of pandemics earlier in the curriculum. It was also apparent that learners need more practice in critically reviewing literature and comparing scientific literature with lay press. The flexible format of the course promotes the development of future iterations that could cover evolving topics related to COVID-19. The course could also be repurposed for a graduate or continuing medical education audience.","Willey, Joanne M; Olvet, Doreen M; Bird, Jeffrey B; Brenner, Judith M",J Med Educ Curric Dev,,387
298626,The Benefits of Self-Transcendence: Examining the Role of Values on Mental Health Among Adolescents Across Regions in China,2021,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common malignancies, and the fourth most common cause of cancer-associated mortality globally. The epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) serves an important function in metastatic dissemination and determines the aggressiveness of CRC. However, the regulatory mechanism of EMT in CRC has not yet been elucidated. Î³-glutamylcyclotransferase (GGCT) is an important enzyme in glutathione metabolism and highly expressed in numerous forms of cancer, making it a promising therapeutic target. In the present study, GGCT was demonstrated to be highly expressed in CRC tissues, and patients with CRC with a higher expression of GGCT exhibited a worse prognosis compared with patients exhibiting a lower expression of GGCT. This result suggests that GGCT may serve as a novel prognostic marker for CRC. Furthermore, GGCT was indicated to promote CRC cell migration and invasion through regulating EMT-associated genes, including N-cadherin, Vimentin, snail family transcriptional repressor 2 and snail family transcriptional repressor 1. In conclusion, the present study provides novel insights into the mechanism governing CRC migration and invasion, and identified GGCT as a promising therapeutic target that may be used in the treatment of CRC.","Huang, Qi; Zhou, Yuanhang; Li, Yue; Liao, Zhiwei",Oncol Lett,,387
300387,The Effect of Exercise on Mental Health: A Focus on Inflammatory Mechanisms,2020,"BACKGROUND: The number of Masters-level athletes (&#8805; 35 years of age) taking part in cycling has increased in the past years which may have beneficial effects on their health. The restrictions brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic has the potential to negatively impact the diet, training and fitness of these individuals due to restrictions in place to slow the spread of the virus. AIM: To investigate how the COVID-19 pandemic impacted the diet, training and fitness of Masters-level cyclists. METHODS: 32 Masters cyclists (12 males, 20 females; mean age 47 ± 10 years) completed two incremental exercise tests one month apart during the pandemic to assess sport-specific fitness. Participants also completed online questionnaires to report their sedentary behavior and dietary intake before and during the pandemic, and their training volume and intensity for a specified week in February (before the pandemic) and each of March, April and May (during the pandemic). RESULTS: No differences were seen in fitness (p = 0.6), training volume (p = 0.24) or intensity (p = 0.79) and sedentary behavior (p = 0.14) during the pandemic. Energy intake was unchanged (p = 1.0) during the pandemic, but participants consumed lower amounts of key nutrients such as fiber, vitamin A, omega-3 fatty acids and potassium (p < 0.05) while consuming more alcohol (p = 0.008) and vitamin C (p = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Our data shows that the COVID-19 pandemic has undesirable effects on nutrient and alcohol intake of Masters cyclists without impacting their training regimes, which may have adverse effects on their overall health and fitness in the long term.","Shaw, Keely A; Bertrand, Leandy; Deprez, Dalton; Ko, Jongbum; Zello, Gordon A; Chilibeck, Philip D",Nutr Health,,387
301902,How can the COVID-19 response advance global mental health?,2020,"SARS-CoV-2, a novel coronavirus (CoV) that causes COVID-19, has recently emerged causing an ongoing outbreak of viral pneumonia around the world. While distinct from SARS-CoV, both group 2B CoVs share similar genome organization, origins to bat CoVs, and an arsenal of immune antagonists. In this report, we evaluate type I interferon (IFN-I) sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 relative to the original SARS-CoV. Our results indicate that while SARS-CoV-2 maintains similar viral replication to SARS-CoV, the novel CoV is much more sensitive to IFN-I. In Vero E6 and in Calu3 cells, SARS-CoV-2 is substantially attenuated in the context of IFN-I pretreatment, whereas SARS-CoV is not. In line with these findings, SARS-CoV-2 fails to counteract phosphorylation of STAT1 and expression of ISG proteins, while SARS-CoV is able to suppress both. Comparing SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A virus in human airway epithelial cultures, we observe the absence of IFN-I stimulation by SARS-CoV-2 alone but detect the failure to counteract STAT1 phosphorylation upon IFN-I pretreatment, resulting in near ablation of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Next, we evaluated IFN-I treatment postinfection and found that SARS-CoV-2 was sensitive even after establishing infection. Finally, we examined homology between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 in viral proteins shown to be interferon antagonists. The absence of an equivalent open reading frame 3b (ORF3b) and genetic differences versus ORF6 suggest that the two key IFN-I antagonists may not maintain equivalent function in SARS-CoV-2. Together, the results identify key differences in susceptibility to IFN-I responses between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 that may help inform disease progression, treatment options, and animal model development.IMPORTANCE With the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19, differences between SARS-CoV-2 and the original SARS-CoV could be leveraged to inform disease progression and eventual treatment options. In addition, these findings could have key implications for animal model development as well as further research into how SARS-CoV-2 modulates the type I IFN response early during infection.","Lokugamage, Kumari G; Hage, Adam; de Vries, Maren; Valero-Jimenez, Ana M; Schindewolf, Craig; Dittmann, Meike; Rajsbaum, Ricardo; Menachery, Vineet D",J. virol,,387

303645,Mental Health Apps: Ensuring Quality and Reimbursement Through a Dynamic Payment Formulary,2021,"The increased reports of escalation of social inequalities, xenophobic and racist ideologies during the COVID-19 pandemic presents a growing concern. Nurses are not immune to xenophobia and racism, both as perpetrators and as victims. Although COVID-19 brings a new wave of xenophobia and racism, healthcare organisations have been tackling discriminatory and racist practices for decades. However, racist practice quite often goes undetected or unchallenged due to its associated sensitivity and a lack of understanding of its complexity. There is a need for a more open and non-judgemental discourse around interpretations of racism and its predisposing factors as a means of combating the growing reports. This discussion paper proposes a practice-orientated conceptualisation of racism and outlines some particular and sustainable areas for consideration for nurses to use in their daily practice. Developing self-awareness and nurturing the courage, confidence and commitment to challenge self and others is critical for transforming ethnocentric and racist ideologies.","Markey, Kathleen; Zhang, Yu",Br J Nurs,,387
304182,Role of mental health professionals in dealing with the stigma attached to COVID-19,2020,"ABSTRACT Objectives: To determine agreement between clinical features of sciatica and 3.0 T magnetic resonance imaging findings. Study Design: Descriptive, cross-sectional study. Place and Duration of Study : Department of Orthopedics, Combined Military Hospital Rawalpindi, from Nov 2017 to May 2018. Methodology: A total of 90 patients with low back pain radiating to one or both lower limbs and age 25-75 years of either gender were included. Patients with tumors of spine or vertebrae, trauma to spine, Pott's disease and previous spinal surgery were excluded. Patients with clinically diagnosed sciatica were taken for magnetic resonance imaging on a 3.0 T magnetic resonance imaging console and images of lumbosacral spine were obtained by a qualified magnetic resonance imaging technician. The images were transferred to computers on reporting station and findings analyzed on vitrea. Reports were prepared according to the findings of magnetic resonance imaging. Agreement was measured if clinical features were positive(positive straight leg raise test) and magnetic resonance imaging showing any feature of disc herniation, disc prolapse and neural foramen narrowing. Results: Mean age was 53.11 ± 8.13 years. Out of these 90 patients, 46(51.11%) were males and 44(48.89%) were females with ratio of 1.1:1. In my study, numbers of observed agreements were 78(86.67% of the observations) with Kappa value of 0.717(95% confidence interval: from 0.568 to 0.865). The strength of agreement between clinical features of sciatica and 3.0 T magnetic resonance imaging findings is considered to be 'good'. Conclusion: This study concluded that there is a good agreement between clinical features of sciatica and 3.0 T magnetic resonance imaging findings. Careful clinical evaluation will help the clinicians for avoiding unnecessary magnetic resonance imaging in patients with sciatica.","Iqbal, Fatima",Pakistan Armed Forces Medical Journal,,387
304913,Mental health status of health sector and community services employees during the COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"The clinicopathological value of microRNA-141-3p (miR-141-3p) and its prospective target genes in endometrial carcinoma (EC) remains unclear. The present study determined the expression level of miR-141-3p in EC via quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR). RT-qPCR showed a markedly higher expression level of miR-141-3p in EC tissues than in non-EC endometrium tissues (P < 0.0001). The microarray and miRNA-seq data revealed upregulation of miR-141-3p. Integrated analysis based on 675 cases of EC and 63 controls gave a standardized mean difference of 1.737, confirmed the upregulation of miR-141-3p. The Kaplan-Meier survival curve showed that a higher expression of miR-141-3p positively corelated with a poorer prognosis. Combining the predicted targets and downregulated genes in EC, we obtained 271 target genes for miR-141-3p in EC. Two potential targets, PPP1R12A and PPP1R12B, were downregulated at both the mRNA and protein levels. This study indicates that the overexpression of miR-141-3p may play an important part in the carcinogenesis of EC. The overexpression of miR-141-3p may be a risk factor for the prognosis of patients with EC.","Yang, Lin-Jie; Gao, Li; Guo, Yi-Nan; Liang, Zi-Qian; Li, Dong-Ming; Tang, Yu-Lu; Liu, Yi-Hong; Gao, Wan-Jing; Zeng, Jing-Jing; Shi, Lin; Wei, Kang-Lai; Chen, Gang",Bioengineered,,387

305650,A plea for the sustained implementation of digital interventions for young people with mental health problems in the light of the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"BACKGROUND: Few small studies have described hospital-acquired infections (HAIs) occurring in patients with COVID-19. RESEARCH QUESTION: What characteristics in critically ill patients with COVID-19 are associated with HAIs and how are HAIs associated with outcomes in these patients? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Multicenter retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data including adult patients with severe COVID-19 admitted to eight Italian hub hospitals from February 20, 2020, through May 20, 2020. Descriptive statistics and univariate and multivariate Weibull regression models were used to assess incidence, microbial cause, resistance patterns, risk factors (ie, demographics, comorbidities, exposure to medication), and impact on outcomes (ie, ICU discharge, length of ICU and hospital stays, and duration of mechanical ventilation) of microbiologically confirmed HAIs. RESULTS: Of the 774 included patients, 359 patients (46%) demonstrated 759 HAIs (44.7 infections/1,000 ICU patient-days; 35% multidrug-resistant [MDR] bacteria). Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP; n = 389 [50%]), bloodstream infections (BSIs; n = 183 [34%]), and catheter-related BSIs (n = 74 [10%]) were the most frequent HAIs, with 26.0 (95% CI, 23.6-28.8) VAPs per 1,000 patient intubation-days, 11.7 (95% CI, 10.1-13.5) BSIs per 1,000 ICU patient-days, and 4.7 (95% CI, 3.8-5.9) catheter-related BSIs per 1,000 ICU patient-days. Gram-negative bacteria (especially Enterobacterales) and Staphylococcus aureus caused 64% and 28% of cases of VAP, respectively. Variables independently associated with infection were age, positive end expiratory pressure, and treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics at admission. Two hundred thirty-four patients (30%) died in the ICU (15.3 deaths/1,000 ICU patient-days). Patients with HAIs complicated by septic shock showed an almost doubled mortality rate (52% vs 29%), whereas noncomplicated infections did not affect mortality. HAIs prolonged mechanical ventilation (median, 24 days [interquartile range (IQR), 14-39 days] vs 9 days [IQR, 5-13 days]; P < .001), ICU stay (24 days [IQR, 16-41 days] vs 9 days [IQR, 6-14 days]; P = .003), and hospital stay (42 days [IQR, 25-59 days] vs 23 days [IQR, 13-34 days]; P < .001). INTERPRETATION: Critically ill patients with COVID-19 are at high risk for HAIs, especially VAPs and BSIs resulting from MDR organisms. HAIs prolong mechanical ventilation and hospitalization, and HAIs complicated by septic shock almost doubled mortality.

METHODS: We sent a survey to physicians worldwide through the network of the World Stroke Organization to investigate the impact of COVID-19 on stroke clinics. To farther along in recovering from the outbreak, we reviewed stroke and other neurology outpatient clinic visits (approximately 50% were stroke related) and the number of inpatient services from December 2019 to July 2020 in a large neurology department in Shanghai, China, where there was no official city lockdown. RESULTS: We received 112 valid survey responses from 46 countries, representing all continents except for Antarctica. Only seven of the survey responders (7/112, 6.3%) reported that they have kept their outpatient clinics open as usual, but they did exercise increased precautions for COVID-19 by following recent guidelines regarding use of personal protective equipment and isolation techniques. The remainder of the respondents have either reduced outpatient clinic services or suspended outpatient clinics completely. Telephone consultation or telemedicine with video capability was used for new patients or follow-ups, with limited in-person evaluations when necessary. Outpatient clinic visits and inpatient services from a large tertiary hospital in China decreased dramatically during the peak period of the outbreak, but then rebounded back quickly following the partial or full recovery from the outbreak. Compared with the recovery process of inpatient services, outpatient clinic visits decreased faster and recovered much slower. This is consistent with our global survey data which indicates that some outpatient clinics have rescheduled their outpatient visits for 3 to 6 months. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic caused a significant drop of in-person outpatient visits and inpatient services. Clinic visits recovered slower than inpatient services in stroke and other neurological diseases after the pandemic.","Zhao, Jing; Wang, Yong; Fisher, Marc; Liu, Renyu",CNS Neurosci Ther,,387

We aimed to investigate the psychosocial effects of the pandemic and reveal the follow-up characteristics. METHODS: The single center, cross-sectional, web-based survey study included patients with acromegaly and CD, PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients and healthy volunteers without known any chronic disease. The semi-structured sociodemographic data form, The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) and Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) were used. RESULTS: We examined 583 people (217 acromegaly, 127 CD, 102 PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients and 137 healthy controls). The frequency of abnormal state anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) were similar in patients with acromegaly and CD and healthy controls, and higher in PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients than in these three groups (p < 0.001 for both). The frequency of abnormal trait anxiety was higher in patients with acromegaly and PCR-confirmed COVID-19 compared to patients with CD and healthy controls (p = 0.027, p < 0.001, respectively). There were no significant differences between the acromegaly and CD groups in terms of follow-up characteristics and perception of the severity of the COVID-19 outbreak (p > 0.05 for all). But, the treatment discontinuation rate was higher in patients with acromegaly than CD (p = 0.012). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that acromegaly and CD patients are psychologically less affected than PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients and exhibit similar findings the general population. The clinicians should consider the psychosocial effects, as well as focus on the regular follow-up and medical treatments of these patients during the outbreak.","Durcan, Emre; Turan, Senol; Sahin, Serdar; Sulu, Cem; Taze, Sabriye Sibel; Kavla, Yasin; Ozkaya, Hande Mefkure; Kadioglu, Pinar",Pituitary,,387

METHODS: We collected 1777 responses from pregnant women through an online survey. Using the Japanese version of the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), we calculated the percentage of pregnant women above the cutoff (&#8805; 13), and the factor scores of anhedonia, anxiety, and depression. Regression analyses were performed to identify factors and socioeconomic characteristics correlated with depressive symptoms. RESULTS: The point prevalence of pregnant women with an EPDS score of &#8805; 13 was 17%. The mean scores were 0.73, 3.68, and 1.82 for anhedonia, anxiety, and depression, respectively. The probability of becoming above the cutoff score positively correlated with the cancellation of planned informal support, higher perceived risk for infection of COVID-19, difficulties in household finances, and lack of social support. Moreover, being younger, less wealthy, unemployed, and without a partner showed a significantly higher possibility of having a score above the cutoff. CONCLUSIONS: The present study found a high percentage of pregnant women with depressive symptoms. Notably, COVID-19-related variables, including perceived risk for the infection, fear of decreasing economic wealth, and social support, were significantly associated with depressive symptoms.","Matsushima, Midori; Horiguchi, Hanna",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,,387

313650,Mental health services for refugees in Malaysia during the COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic has become one of the biggest threats to the global healthcare system, creating an unprecedented condition worldwide. The necessity of rapid diagnosis calls for alternative methods to predict the condition of the patient, for which disease severity estimation on the basis of Lung Ultrasound (LUS) can be a safe, radiation-free, flexible, and favorable option. In this paper, a frame-based 4-score disease severity prediction architecture is proposed with the integration of deep convolutional and recurrent neural networks to consider both spatial and temporal features of the LUS frames. The proposed convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture implements an autoencoder network and separable convolutional branches fused with a modified DenseNet-201 network to build a vigorous, noise-free classification model. A five-fold cross-validation scheme is performed to affirm the efficacy of the proposed network. In-depth result analysis shows a promising improvement in the classification performance by introducing the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layers after the proposed CNN architecture by an average of 7-12%, which is approximately 17% more than the traditional DenseNet architecture alone. From an extensive analysis, it is found that the proposed end-to-end scheme is very effective in detecting COVID-19 severity scores from LUS images.","Dastider, Ankan Ghosh; Sadik, Farhan; Fattah, Shaikh Anowarul",Comput Biol Med,,387

315729,"COVID-19, mental health and religion: an agenda for future research",2020,"Dental health care workers around the world are in a constant state of fear and anxiety because they work in a constrained space of the dental practice. During routine dental procedures, they are exposed to aerosol and splatter. These airborne particles pose a great risk of transmitting contagious infections to health care workers and patients, especially in an era of social distancing due to COVID-19. The current study was conducted to evaluate contamination amount, duration, the distance of aerosol, and splatter produced after cavity preparation using a two-hole and four-hole handpiece. The study was performed on a dental manikin in a dental simulation laboratory at the College of Dentistry, King Faisal University Al Ahsa. The dental manikin was set to a reclined position to simulate the clinical operatory position of the patient for dental restorative procedures. Aerosol and splatter were collected on Grade 1 qualitative cotton cellulose filter paper. These were placed on adhesive tape extending from the headrest of the dental manikin in six different directions (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 o'clock) for up to 60 inches and on certain positions of the operator and assistant such as the chest, head, forearms, upper leg, and inside facemask. Class V cavity preparation was done by the principal investigator at a specific time of 3 min on tooth #11 using a two-hole high-speed handpiece, then on the next day, Class V cavity preparation was performed on tooth #21 by a four-hole handpiece. High volume suction was used throughout the cavity preparation. Immediately after cavity preparation, the first filter paper disc was replaced with new ones in all positions. The second set of filter papers was removed after 30 min. Transparent grids were used to count the contamination area on the filter paper disc. No statistically significant difference was found in the mean amount of aerosol and splatter produced by both handpieces, however, a statistically significant difference was found in an amount of aerosol and splatter produced at a 12, 24, and 36 inches distance immediately after cavity preparation and 30 min after cavity preparation, regardless of the type of handpiece used. It is advisable to refrain from removing the personal protective barriers immediately after the procedure within the vicinity of the dental practice. The use of other adjuncts such as high volume suction to reduce the spread of aerosol and splatter is also recommended.","Ahmed, M.

Whether there is an association between pulmonary embolism (PE) and COVID-19 in the emergency department (ED) is unknown. The aim of this study was to assess whether COVID-19 is associated with PE in ED patients who underwent a computed tomographic pulmonary angiogram (CTPA). METHODS: A retrospective study in 26 EDs from six countries. ED patients in whom a CTPA was performed for suspected PE during a 2-month period covering the pandemic peak. The primary endpoint was the occurrence of a PE on CTPA. COVID-19 was diagnosed in the ED either on CT or reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. A multivariable binary logistic regression was built to adjust with other variables known to be associated with PE. A sensitivity analysis was performed in patients included during the pandemic period. RESULTS: A total of 3,358 patients were included, of whom 105 were excluded because COVID-19 status was unknown, leaving 3,253 for analysis. Among them, 974 (30%) were diagnosed with COVID-19. Mean (±SD) age was 61 (±19) years and 52% were women. A PE was diagnosed on CTPA in 500 patients (15%). The risk of PE was similar between COVID-19 patients and others (15% in both groups). In the multivariable binary logistic regression model, COVID-19 was not associated with higher risk of PE (adjusted odds ratio = 0.98, 95% confidence interval = 0.76 to 1.26). There was no association when limited to patients in the pandemic period. CONCLUSION: In ED patients who underwent CTPA for suspected PE, COVID-19 was not associated with an increased probability of PE diagnosis.

RECENT FINDINGS: Implementation of telegenetics in health systems is still limited, below 10%, somewhat higher for cancer genetic counseling. Nevertheless, telegenetic services have been shown useful in the COVID pandemic. Key factors for efficient implementation include a patient-centered approach, engaging the major stakeholders, and incorporating telegenetics into existing health policies. Main barriers remain: limitations to billing and reimbursement, licensure, proper equipment and technical issues, engagement of referring providers and patients, coordination of services with local health providers, and lack of decision-making power. Further rigorous studies are needed to investigate the outcomes of telegenetics and to motivate health policies for change. SUMMARY: Despite continuous evidence of the benefits of telegenetics, its use in health systems remains limited. Further, larger, prospective, randomized, long-term studies are needed to address the outcomes.Enabling factors contributing to the implementation of telegenetics are patient-centeredness, the involvement of major stakeholders, and aligning telegenetics with the existing national health policies.","Peterlin, Borut",Curr Opin Pediatr,,387
317517,Preventing COVID-19 Infection in Mental Health Units: Recommendations for Best Practices,2020,"OBJECTIVE: This study was aimed to review 4 weeks of universal novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) screening among delivery hospitalizations, at two hospitals in March and April 2020 in New York City, to compare outcomes between patients based on COVID-19 status and to determine whether demographic risk factors and symptoms predicted screening positive for COVID-19. STUDY DESIGN: This retrospective cohort study evaluated all patients admitted for delivery from March 22 to April 18, 2020, at two New York City hospitals. Obstetrical and neonatal outcomes were collected. The relationship between COVID-19 and demographic, clinical, and maternal and neonatal outcome data was evaluated. Demographic data included the number of COVID-19 cases ascertained by ZIP code of residence. Adjusted logistic regression models were performed to determine predictability of demographic risk factors for COVID-19. RESULTS: Of 454 women delivered, 79 (17%) had COVID-19. Of those, 27.9% (n = 22) had symptoms such as cough (13.9%), fever (10.1%), chest pain (5.1%), and myalgia (5.1%). While women with COVID-19 were more likely to live in the ZIP codes quartile with the most cases (47 vs. 41%) and less likely to live in the ZIP code quartile with the fewest cases (6 vs. 14%), these comparisons were not statistically significant (p = 0.18). Women with COVID-19 were less likely to have a vaginal delivery (55.2 vs. 51.9%, p = 0.04) and had a significantly longer postpartum length of stay with cesarean (2.00 vs. 2.67days, p < 0.01). COVID-19 was associated with higher risk for diagnoses of chorioamnionitis and pneumonia and fevers without a focal diagnosis. In adjusted analyses, including demographic factors, logistic regression demonstrated a c-statistic of 0.71 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.69, 0.80). CONCLUSION: COVID-19 symptoms were present in a minority of COVID-19-positive women admitted for delivery. Significant differences in obstetrical outcomes were found. While demographic risk factors demonstrated acceptable discrimination, risk prediction does not capture a significant portion of COVID-19-positive patients. KEY POINTS: · COVID-19 symptoms were present in a minority of COVID-19-positive women admitted.. · COVID-19 symptomatology did not appear to differ before or after the apex of infection in New York.. · Demographic risk factors are unlikely to capture a significant portion of COVID-19-positive patients..","Sutton, Desmond; Wen, Timothy; Staniczenko, Anna P; Huang, Yongmei; Andrikopoulou, Maria; D039,; Alton, Mary; Feinberg, Bruce B; Fuchs, Karin; Goffman, Dena; Gyamfi-Bannerman, Cynthia; Kahe, Ka; Landau, Ruth; Lasky, James A; Miller, Russell; Ntoso, Amma D; Panzer, Alexis; Sheen, Jean-Ju; Simpson, Lynn L; Friedman, Alexander M",Am J Perinatol,,387

326985,Monitoring the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on mental health: a public health challenge? Reflection on Italian data,2020,"SARS-CoV-2 is a respiratory pathogen and primarily infects the airway epithelium. As our knowledge about innate immune factors of the respiratory tract against SARS-CoV-2 is limited, we generated and screened a peptide/protein library derived from bronchoalveolar lavage for inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 spike-driven entry. Analysis of antiviral fractions revealed the presence of &#945;1-antitrypsin (&#945;1AT), a highly abundant circulating serine protease inhibitor. Here, we report that &#945;1AT inhibits SARS-CoV-2 entry at physiological concentrations and suppresses viral replication in cell lines and primary cells including human airway epithelial cultures. We further demonstrate that &#945;1AT binds and inactivates the serine protease TMPRSS2, which enzymatically primes the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein for membrane fusion. Thus, the acute phase protein &#945;1AT is an inhibitor of TMPRSS2 and SARS-CoV-2 entry, and may play an important role in the innate immune defense against the novel coronavirus. Our findings suggest that repurposing of &#945;1AT-containing drugs has prospects for the therapy of COVID-19.","Wettstein, Lukas; Weil, Tatjana; Conzelmann, Carina; Müller, Janis A; Groß, Rüdiger; Hirschenberger, Maximilian; Seidel, Alina; Klute, Susanne; Zech, Fabian; Prelli Bozzo, Caterina; Preising, Nico; Fois, Giorgio; Lochbaum, Robin; Knaff, Philip Maximilian; Mailänder, Volker; Ständker, Ludger; Thal, Dietmar Rudolf; Schumann, Christian; Stenger, Steffen; Kleger, Alexander; Lochnit, Günter; Mayer, Benjamin; Ruiz-Blanco, Yasser B; Hoffmann, Markus; Sparrer, Konstantin M J; Pöhlmann, Stefan; Sanchez-Garcia, Elsa; Kirchhoff, Frank; Frick, Manfred; Münch, Jan",Nat Commun,,387

331622,Pharmacists promote COVID-19 vaccine acceptance in rural locales,2021,"As of April 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic has swept through 213 countries and infected more than 132 million individuals globally, posing an unprecedented threat to human health. There are currently no specific antiviral treatments for COVID-19 and vaccination programmes, whilst promising, remain in their infancy. A key to restricting the pandemic is the ability to minimize human-human transmission and to predict the infection status of the population in the face of emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants. Success in this area is dependent on the rapid detection of COVID-19 positive individuals with current/previous SARS-CoV-2 infection status. In this regard, the ability to detect antibodies directed against the SARS-CoV-Spike protein in patient sera represents a powerful biomarker for confirmation of infection. Here, we report the design of a proof-of-concept cell-based fluorescent serology assay (termed C19-S-I-IFA) to detect SARS-CoV-2 infection. The assay is based on the capture of IgG antibodies in the serum of COVID-19-positive patients using cells exogenously expressing SARS-CoV-2-Spike and their subsequent fluorescent detection. We validate the assay in 30 blood samples collected in Oxford, UK, in 2020 during the height of the pandemic. Importantly, the assay can be modified to express emerging Spike-variants to permit assessments of the cross-reactivity of patient sera to emerging SARS-CoV-2 strains.","Nguyen, Dung; Skelly, Donal; Goonawardane, Niluka",Viruses,,387

This study sought to assess how occupational segregation according to race and ethnicity may contribute to the risk of COVID-19. METHODS: Data about employment in 2019 by industry and occupation and race and ethnicity were obtained from the Bureau of Labor Statistics Current Population Survey. This data was combined with information about industries according to whether they were likely or possibly essential during the COVID-19 pandemic and the frequency of exposure to infections and close proximity to others by occupation. The percentage of workers employed in essential industries and occupations with a high risk of infection and close proximity to others by race and ethnicity was calculated. RESULTS: People of color were more likely to be employed in essential industries and in occupations with more exposure to infections and close proximity to others. Black workers in particular faced an elevated risk for all of these factors. CONCLUSION: Occupational segregation into high-risk industries and occupations likely contributes to differential risk with respect to COVID-19.

337298,Achieving Positive Mental Health and Wellbeing on the COVID-19 frontline,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Due to the current COVID-19 pandemic, the German Health Ministry has issued restrictions applying to the field of orthopaedics and trauma surgery. Besides postponement of elective surgeries, outpatient consultations have been drastically reduced. Parallel to these developments, an increase in telemedical consultations has reflected efforts to provide sufficient patient care. This study aims to evaluate the feasibility of a clinical examination of the hip joint and pelvis by way of a telemedical consultation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-nine patients of a German university clinic were recruited and assessed in both telemedical and conventional examinations. Agreement between the two examinations was then assessed, and connections between the observed agreement and patient-specific factors such as age, BMI and ASA classification were investigated. RESULTS: The inspections agreed closely with a mean Cohen's kappa of 0.76 ± 0.37. Palpation showed adequate agreement with a mean Cohen's kappa of 0.38 ± 0.19. Function showed good agreement with a mean Cohen's kappa of 0.61 ± 0.26 and range of motion showed adequate agreement with a mean Cohen's kappa of 0.36 ± 0.19. A significant positive correlation was observed between the number of deviations in the different examinations and age (p = 0.05), and a significant positive correlation was shown between the number of non-feasible examinations and age (p < 0.01), BMI (p < 0.01) and ASA classification score (p < 0.01). DISCUSSION: Inspection and function can be reliably evaluated, whereas the significance of palpation, provocation and measurement of range of motion is limited. The small sample size puts limitations on the significance of a statistically relevant correlation between patient-specific factors such as age, BMI and ASA classification score and valid and successful implementation of a telemedical examination. The authors recommend targeted patient selection. If, however, patients are being evaluated who are very old (> 75 years), obese (BMI > 30) or with multiple comorbidities (ASA 3 and above), caution is advised. Large, prospective studies are needed in the future to fully validate telemedical consultations in the fields of orthopaedics and trauma surgery. CONCLUSION: A telemedical examination of the hip joint and pelvis can be performed with certain limitations. Patient-specific factors such as age, BMI, and extent of comorbidities appear to have a relevant impact on validity and execution of the examination. Patients with multiple comorbidities (ASA 3 and above), advanced age (> 75 years) or obesity (BMI > 30) should, whenever possible, be examined in a conventional outpatient setting.","Jaenisch, Max; Kohlhof, Hendrik; Touet, Amadeo; Kehrer, Michael; Cucchi, Davide; Burger, Christof; Wirtz, Dieter Christian; Welle, Kristian; Kabir, Koroush",Z. orthop. unfallchirurgie,,387

In children, allergy and asthma are among the most prevalent non-communicable chronic diseases, and healthcare providers taking care of these patients need guidance. At the current stage of knowledge, children have less severe symptoms of COVID-19, and severe asthma and immunodeficiency are classified as risk factors. In addition, there is no evidence that currently available asthma and allergy treatments, including antihistamines, corticosteroids, and bronchodilators, increase the risk of severe disease from COVID-19. Most countries affected by COVID-19 have opted for nationwide confinement, which means that communication with the primary clinician is often performed by telemedicine. Optimal disease control of allergic, asthmatic, and immunodeficient children should be sought according to usual treatment guidelines.

345268,Effect of COVID-19 on Mental Health Rehabilitation Centers,2020,"SARS-CoV-2 variants could induce immune escape by mutations on the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and N-terminal domain (NTD). Here we report the humoral immune response to circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants, such as 501Y.V2 (B.1.351), of the plasma and neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) elicited by CoronaVac (inactivated vaccine), ZF2001 (RBD-subunit vaccine) and natural infection. Among 86 potent NAbs identified by high-throughput single-cell VDJ sequencing of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from vaccinees and convalescents, near half anti-RBD NAbs showed major neutralization reductions against the K417N/E484K/N501Y mutation combination, with E484K being the dominant cause. VH3-53/VH3-66 recurrent antibodies respond differently to RBD variants, and K417N compromises the majority of neutralizing activity through reduced polar contacts with complementarity determining regions. In contrast, the 242-244 deletion (242-244&#916;) would abolish most neutralization activity of anti-NTD NAbs by interrupting the conformation of NTD antigenic supersite, indicating a much less diversity of anti-NTD NAbs than anti-RBD NAbs. Plasma of convalescents and CoronaVac vaccinees displayed comparable neutralization reductions against pseudo- and authentic 501Y.V2 variants, mainly caused by E484K/N501Y and 242-244&#916;, with the effects being additive. Importantly, RBD-subunit vaccinees exhibit markedly higher tolerance to 501Y.V2 than convalescents, since the elicited anti-RBD NAbs display a high diversity and are unaffected by NTD mutations. Moreover, an extended gap between the third and second doses of ZF2001 leads to better neutralizing activity and tolerance to 501Y.V2 than the standard three-dose administration. Together, these results suggest that the deployment of RBD-vaccines, through a third-dose boost, may be ideal for combating SARS-CoV-2 variants when necessary, especially for those carrying mutations that disrupt the NTD supersite.","Cao, Yunlong; Yisimayi, Ayijiang; Bai, Yali; Huang, Weijin; Li, Xiaofeng; Zhang, Zhiying; Yuan, Tianjiao; An, Ran; Wang, Jing; Xiao, Tianhe; Du, Shuo; Ma, Wenping; Song, Liyang; Li, Yongzheng; Li, Xiang; Song, Weiliang; Wu, Jiajing; Liu, Shuo; Li, Xuemei; Zhang, Yonghong; Su, Bin; Guo, Xianghua; Wei, Yangyang; Gao, Chuanping; Zhang, Nana; Zhang, Yifei; Dou, Yang; Xu, Xiaoyu; Shi, Rui; Lu, Bai; Jin, Ronghua; Ma, Yingmin; Qin, Chengfeng; Wang, Youchun; Feng, Yingmei; Xiao, Junyu; Xie, Xiaoliang Sunney",Cell res,,387

Methods: The general information, including epidemiological and clinical data of the confirmed cases during the epidemic period of the two infectious diseases was collected. The data of SARS in Guangzhou was derived from the technical files of Guangzhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention (GZCDC), including the statistical report and brief report of the epidemic situation (from January 2 to May 11, 2003);The data of COVID-19 in Wuhan was derived from the epidemic data published by Wuhan health and Health Committee's official website and other publicly reported documents (from December 9, 2019 to March 11, 2020). Descriptive analysis was used for a comparativeanalysis of the time and age characteristics, the number of cases, basic reproduction number (R0), proportion of medical staff in confirmed cases (%), crude mortality, etc. Results: A total of 1 072 cases of SARS in Guangzhou were included in the study. The incidence ratio of male to female was 1â¶1.26. 43 cases of death were reported with a mortality rate of 4.01%. The median age was 36 years old. The proportion of medical staff in the early stage of the epidemic was 29.04% (88 cases). As to COVID-19 in Wuhan, a total of 49 978 cases were included, The incidence ratio of male to female was 1.04â¶1. The 2 423 cases of death were reported with a mortality rate of 4.85%. The median age was 56 years old. The proportion of medical staff in the early stage of the epidemic was 30.43% (42 cases). Conclusion: The COVID-19 in Wuhan has the characteristics of high incidence and wide population. However, the epidemic situation is falling rapidly, and the prevention and control strategy needs to be adjusted timely. The prevention and control of nosocomial infection should be addressed in future.","Cai, W F; Yuan, J; Huang, L F; Chen, C; Ma, Y; Wang, H; Zhang, C H; Zhang, Z B; Li, T G; Wang, M",Zhonghua Yu Fang Yi Xue Za Zhi,,387

However, massive imported patients especially into Heilongjiang Province in China recently have been an alert for local COVID-19 outbreak. We collected data from January 23 to March 25 from Heilongjiang province and trained an ordinary differential equation model to fit the epidemic data. We extended the simulation using this trained model to characterize the effect of an imported ‘escaper’. We showed that an imported ‘escaper’ was responsible for the newly confirmed COVID-19 infections from Apr 9 to Apr 19 in Heilongjiang province. Stochastic simulations further showed that significantly increased local contacts among imported ‘escaper’, its epidemiologically associated cases and susceptible populations greatly contributed to the local outbreak of COVID-19. Meanwhile, we further found that the reported number of asymptomatic patients was markedly lower than model predictions implying a large asymptomatic pool which was not identified. We further forecasted the effect of implementing strong interventions immediately to impede COVID-19 outbreak for Heilongjiang province. Implementation of stronger interventions to lower mutual contacts could accelerate the complete recovery from coronavirus infections in Heilongjiang province. Collectively, our model has characterized the epidemic of COVID-19 in Heilongjiang province and implied that strongly controlled measured should be taken for infected and asymptomatic patients to minimize total infections.","Sun, Tingzhe; Wang, Yan",Chaos Solitons Fractals,,387

The viral load of the youngest subjects was lower than that of the older subjects by 0.5 (or fewer) log10 units, and they displayed an estimated ~78% of the peak cell culture replication probability; in part this was due to smaller swab sizes and unlikely to be clinically relevant. Viral loads above 109 copies per swab were found in 8% of subjects, one-third of whom were PAMS, with a mean age of 37.6 years.

In this context, terms such as posthuman sexuality, digisexuality, and techno-sexuality have emerged, signaling possible new understandings of sexual, intimacy, and emotional practices. It is important to note that ancient history shows that humankind has for a long time been fascinated with their relationship to non-living things, mostly human-like figures, such as dolls. The Ningyo (人形, the Japanese term for doll) has a long history of usage, and has deep religious and animistic significance in the Japanese context—there are records of sexual use as early as the 18th century. With this context in mind, this paper focuses on three Japanese examples, aiming to shine a light on beyond-human relationships, which include a Japanese man's marriage to a digital character, sex dolls, and communicative robots, from both a sexual and emotional perspective. In a new horizon of sexual and romantic possibilities, how will humans respond, and what can emerge from these interactions?

357672,Flattening the curve of mental ill-health: the importance of primary prevention in managing the mental health impacts of COVID-19,2020,"Multiple neurological problems have been reported in coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) patients because severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) likely spreads to the central nervous system (CNS) via olfactory nerves or through the subarachnoid space along olfactory nerves into the brain's cerebrospinal fluid and then into the brain's interstitial space. We hypothesize that SARS-CoV-2 enters the subfornical organ (SFO) through the above routes and the circulating blood since circumventricular organs (CVOs) such as the SFO lack the blood-brain barrier, and infection of the SFO causes dysfunction of the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) and supraoptic nucleus (SON), leading to hydroelectrolytic disorder. SARS-CoV-2 can readily enter SFO-PVN-SON neurons because these neurons express angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 receptors and proteolytic viral activators, which likely leads to neurodegeneration or neuroinflammation in these regions. Considering the pivotal role of SFO-PVN-SON circuitry in modulating hydroelectrolyte balance, SARS-CoV-2 infection in these regions could disrupt the neuroendocrine control of hydromineral homeostasis. This review proposes mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 infection of the SFO-PVN-SON pathway leads to hydroelectrolytic disorder in COVID-19 patients.","de Melo, Igor Santana; Sabino-Silva, Robinson; Cunha, Thúlio Marquez; Goulart, Luiz Ricardo; Reis, Wagner Luis; Jardim, Ana Carolina Gomes; Shetty, Ashok K; de Castro, Olagide Wagner",Neurosci Biobehav Rev,,387

(2) What are the possible causes of the re-positive reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test in recovered patients? (3) What are the implications of these re-positive cases concerning the spread of the virus? Understanding how recovery from Covid-19 confers immunity to decrease the risk of re-infection is needed to inform current efforts to safely scale back population-based interventions, such as physical distancing We have also described what is currently known about the immune response to Covid-19, highlighted key gaps in knowledge, and identified opportunities for future research Overall, the quality of the evidence is poor and we describe the features that should be described for future cases","Farrukh, Larabe Mumtaz Aqsa Sana Muhammad K.",Reviews in Medical Virology,,387

360539,"Prevalence and changes in boredom, anxiety and well-being among Ghanaians during the COVID-19 pandemic: a population-based study",2021,"BACKGROUND: In the case of people who carry an increased number of anxiety traits and maladaptive coping strategies, psychosocial stressors may further increase the level of perceived stress they experience. In our research study, we aimed to examine the levels of perceived stress and health anxiety as well as coping styles among university students amid the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted using an online-based survey at the University of Debrecen during the official lockdown in Hungary when dormitories were closed, and teaching was conducted remotely. Our questionnaire solicited data using three assessment tools, namely, the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), the Ways of Coping Questionnaire (WCQ), and the Short Health Anxiety Inventory (SHAI). RESULTS: A total of 1320 students have participated in our study and 31 non-eligible responses were excluded. Among the remaining 1289 participants, 948 (73.5%) and 341 (26.5%) were Hungarian and international students, respectively. Female students predominated the overall sample with 920 participants (71.4%). In general, there was a statistically significant positive relationship between perceived stress and health anxiety. Health anxiety and perceived stress levels were significantly higher among international students compared to domestic ones. Regarding coping, wishful thinking was associated with higher levels of stress and anxiety among international students, while being a goal-oriented person acted the opposite way. Among the domestic students, cognitive restructuring as a coping strategy was associated with lower levels of stress and anxiety. Concerning health anxiety, female students (domestic and international) had significantly higher levels of health anxiety compared to males. Moreover, female students had significantly higher levels of perceived stress compared to males in the international group, however, there was no significant difference in perceived stress between males and females in the domestic group. CONCLUSION: The elevated perceived stress levels during major life events can be further deepened by disengagement from home (being away/abroad from country or family) and by using inadequate coping strategies. By following and adhering to the international recommendations, adopting proper coping methods, and equipping oneself with the required coping and stress management skills, the associated high levels of perceived stress and anxiety could be mitigated.","Garbóczy, Szabolcs; Szemán-Nagy, Anita; Ahmad, Mohamed S; Harsányi, Szilvia; Ocsenás, Dorottya; Rekenyi, Viktor; Al-Tammemi, Ala039; a, B; Kolozsvári, László Róbert",BMC Psychol,,387

This integrative view of science has reemerged complementary to the reductionist philosophy of studying individual cell types. An integrative approach has proven particularly powerful within the field of neuroscience where, intermingled among the most numerous neural cell types of the brain, are immune cells called microglia. Microglia act as a line of defense in the CNS by phagocytizing harmful pathogens and cellular debris and by releasing a variety of factors that mediate immune responses. However, microglia are also appreciated as critical mediators of neurophysiology making them a desired target to rectify neuropathological states. The goal of this review is to discuss microglia ontogenesis, referred to as microgliogenesis, a term that encompasses the events that drive the production, differentiation, migration, and maturation of microglia and opportunities to target microglia for brain repair.","Neckles, Victoria N; Feliciano, David M",Cell tissue res,,387
362548,Maybe we are stronger than we thought: Explore protective factors for the public's mental health in COVID-19,2021,"OBJECTIVES: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) had spread worldwide since December 2019 and became a pandemic in March 2020. The diagnosis of an active infection is based on the real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from the nasopharyngeal swab specimen. The aim of the current analysis was to assess the usefulness of the rapid serological tests for diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 infections. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The rapid serological tests detecting IgG/IgM antibodies for SARS-CoV-2 were voluntarily performed in asymptomatic employees of 2 companies. The examination was conducted at the date and time selected online by the study participants. The testing team consisted of 2 nurses collecting the samples and 1 doctor who interpreted the results. Each positive rapid test result was verified by an RT-PCR examination from a nasopharyngeal swab. The testing kits named Vazyme: 2019-nCoV IgG/IgM Detection Kit (Colloidal Gold-Based) were provided by the employer along with the manual and certificates. RESULTS: The overall interest in testing among employees was below the employer's expectations and reached 30% and 20% in each of the 2 companies, respectively. A total of 516 participants were included in the analysis. Ten positive results of the rapid tests were documented, including 7 for IgM and 3 for IgG antibodies. No positive result was confirmed by the detection of the genetic material of the SARS-CoV-2 by the RT-PCR examination. CONCLUSIONS: Herein, the authors demonstrated the uselessness of rapid serological tests performed in asymptomatic volunteers for diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 infections.","Krygier, Rafal; Stepien, Piotr M; Zarebska-Michaluk, Dorota",Int. j. occup. med. environ. health,,387

Although it has been suggested that elevated levels of blood neutrophils associate with worsening oxygenation in COVID-19, it is unknown whether neutrophils are drivers of the thrombo-inflammatory storm or simple bystanders. To better understand the potential role of neutrophils in COVID-19, we measured levels of the neutrophil activation marker S100A8/A9 (calprotectin) in hospitalized patients and determined its relationship to severity of illness and respiratory status. Patients with COVID-19 (n = 172) had markedly elevated levels of calprotectin in their blood. Calprotectin tracked with other acute phase reactants including C-reactive protein, ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase, and absolute neutrophil count, but was superior in identifying patients requiring mechanical ventilation. In longitudinal samples, calprotectin rose as oxygenation worsened. When tested on day 1 or 2 of hospitalization (n = 94 patients), calprotectin levels were significantly higher in patients who progressed to severe COVID-19 requiring mechanical ventilation (8039 ± 7031 ng/ml, n = 32) as compared to those who remained free of intubation (3365 ± 3146, P < 0.0001). In summary, serum calprotectin levels track closely with current and future COVID-19 severity, implicating neutrophils as potential perpetuators of inflammation and respiratory compromise in COVID-19.","Shi, Hui; Zuo, Yu; Yalavarthi, Srilakshmi; Gockman, Kelsey; Zuo, Melanie; Madison, Jacqueline A; Blair, Christopher; Woodward, Wrenn; Lezak, Sean P; Lugogo, Njira L; Woods, Robert J; Lood, Christian; Knight, Jason S; Kanthi, Yogendra",J. leukoc. biol,,387

Herein, we aimed to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on the clinical outcome of patients with cirrhosis. METHODS: In this multicentre retrospective study, patients with cirrhosis and a confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection were enrolled between 1st and 31th March 2020. Clinical and biochemical data at diagnosis of COVID-19 and at the last outpatient visit were obtained through review of medical records. RESULTS: Fifty patients with cirrhosis and confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were enrolled (age 67 years, 70% men, 38% virus-related, 52% previously compensated cirrhosis). At diagnosis, 64% of patients presented fever, 42% shortness of breath/polypnea, 22% encephalopathy, 96% needed hospitalization or a prolonged stay if already in hospital. Respiratory support was necessary in 71%, 52% received antivirals, 80% heparin. Serum albumin significantly decreased, while bilirubin, creatinine and prothrombin time significantly increased at COVID-19 diagnosis compared to last available data. The proportion of patients with a model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score &#8805;15 increased from 13% to 26% (p = 0.037), acute-on-chronic liver failure and de novo acute liver injury occurred in 14 (28%) and 10 patients, respectively. Seventeen patients died after a median of 10 (4-13) days from COVID-19 diagnosis, with a 30-day-mortality rate of 34%. The severity of lung and liver (according to CLIF-C, CLIF-OF and MELD scores) diseases independently predicted mortality. In patients with cirrhosis, mortality was significantly higher in those with COVID-19 than in those hospitalized for bacterial infections. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 is associated with liver function deterioration and elevated mortality in patients with cirrhosis. LAY SUMMARY: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) poses a major health threat to healthy individuals and those with comorbidities. Herein, we assessed its impact on patients with cirrhosis.

371322,Coping with Racism: a Perspective of COVID-19 Church Closures on the Mental Health of African Americans,2020,"SARS-CoV-2 virus was first detected in late 2019 and circulated globally, causing COVID-19, which is characterised by sub-clinical to severe disease in humans. Here, we investigate the serological antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection during acute and convalescent infection using a cohort of (i) COVID-19 patients admitted to hospital, (ii) healthy individuals who had experienced 'COVID-19 like-illness', and (iii) a cohort of healthy individuals prior to the emergence of SARS-CoV-2. We compare SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody detection rates from four different serological methods, virus neutralisation test (VNT), ID Screen® SARS-CoV-2-N IgG ELISA, Whole Antigen ELISA, and lentivirus-based SARS-CoV-2 pseudotype virus neutralisation tests (pVNT). All methods were able to detect prior infection with COVID-19, albeit with different relative sensitivities. The VNT and SARS-CoV-2-N ELISA methods showed a strong correlation yet provided increased detection rates when used in combination. A pVNT correlated strongly with SARS-CoV-2 VNT and was able to effectively discriminate SARS-CoV-2 antibody positive and negative serum with the same efficiency as the VNT. Moreover, the pVNT was performed with the same level of discrimination across multiple separate institutions. Therefore, the pVNT is a sensitive, specific, and reproducible lower biosafety level alternative to VNT for detecting SARS-CoV-2 antibodies for diagnostic and research applications. Our data illustrate the potential utility of applying VNT or pVNT and ELISA antibody tests in parallel to enhance the sensitivity of exposure to infection.","James, Joe; Rhodes, Shelley; Ross, Craig S; Skinner, Paul; Smith, Samuel P; Shipley, Rebecca; Warren, Caroline J; Goharriz, Hooman; McElhinney, Lorraine M; Temperton, Nigel; Wright, Edward; Fooks, Anthony R; Clark, Tristan W; Brookes, Sharon M; Brown, Ian H; Banyard, Ashley C",Viruses,,387
371530,Confinement and intimate partner violence†,2021,"Background: The 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) can complicate the perioperative course to increase postoperative mortality in operative patients, and also is a serious threat to medical staff. However, studies summarizing the impact of COVID-19 on the perioperative mortality of patients and on the safety of medical staff are lacking. Methods: We searched PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase and Chinese database National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) with the search terms ""COVID-19â³ or ""SARS-CoV-2â³ and ""Surgery"" or ""Operation"" for all published articles on COVID-19 from December 1, 2019 to October 5, 2020. Findings: A total of 269 patients from 47 studies were included in our meta-analysis. The mean age of operative patients with COVID-19 was 50.91 years, and 49% were female. A total of 28 patients were deceased, with the overall mortality of 6%. All deceased patients had postoperative complications associated with operation or COVID-19, including respiratory failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), short of breath, dyspnea, fever, cough, fatigue or myalgia, cardiopulmonary system, shock/infection, acute kidney injury and severe lymphopenia. Patients who presented any or more of the symptoms of respiratory failure, ARDS, short of breath and dyspnea after operation were associated with significantly higher mortality (r = 0.891, p < 0.001), while patients whose symptoms were presented as fever, cough, fatigue or myalgia only demonstrated marginally significant association with postoperative mortality (r = 0.675, p = 0.023). Twenty studies reported the information of medical staff infection, and a total of 38 medical staff were infected, and medical staff who used biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) protective equipment did not get infected. Interpretation: COVID-19 patients, in particular those with severe respiratory complications, may have high postoperative mortality. Medical staff in close contact with infected patients is suggested to take high level personal protective equipment (PPE).

The drug is known to have low oral bioavailability (37%) which may be attributed to its relatively high molecular weight, low solubility, dissolution rate, and incomplete intestinal absorption. To overcome these drawbacks, liquid (L) and solid (S) self-emulsifying drug delivery systems (SEDDs) of AZM were developed and optimized. Eight different pseudo-ternary diagrams were constructed based on the drug solubility and the emulsification studies in various SEDDs excipients at different surfactant to co-surfactant (Smix) ratios. Droplet size (DS) < 150 nm, dispersity (D) &#8804; 0.7, and transmittance (T)% > 85 in three diluents of distilled water (DW), 0.1 mM HCl, and simulated intestinal fluids (SIF) were considered as the selection criteria. The final formulations of L-SEDDs (L-F1(H)), and S-SEDDs (S-F1(H)) were able to meet the selection requirements. Both formulations were proven to be cytocompatible and able to open up the cellular epithelial tight junctions (TJ). The drug dissolution studies showed that after 5 min > 90% and 52.22% of the AZM was released from liquid and solid SEDDs formulations in DW, respectively, compared to 11.27% of the pure AZM, suggesting the developed SEDDs may enhance the oral delivery of the drug.

The disease is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Even though multiple vaccines and treatments are under development so far, the disease is only slowing down under extreme social distancing measures that are difficult to maintain. SARS-COV-2 is an enveloped virus that is surrounded by a lipid bilayer. Lipids are fundamental cell components that play various biological roles ranging from being a structural building block to a signaling molecule as well as a central energy store. The role lipids play in viral infection involves the fusion of the viral membrane to the host cell, viral replication, and viral endocytosis and exocytosis. Since lipids play a crucial function in the viral life cycle, we asked whether drugs targeting lipid metabolism, such as statins, can be utilized against SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses. In this review, we discuss the role of lipid metabolism in viral infection as well as the possibility of targeting lipid metabolism to interfere with the viral life cycle.","Abu-Farha, Mohamed; Thanaraj, Thangavel Alphonse; Qaddoumi, Mohammad G; Hashem, Anwar; Abubaker, Jehad; Al-Mulla, Fahd",,,387

Asthma does not represent a risk factor for COVID-19 in several published cohorts. We hypothesized that the SARS-CoV-2 proteome contains T cell epitopes, which are potentially cross-reactive to allergen epitopes. We aimed at identifying homologous peptide sequences by means of two distinct complementary bioinformatics approaches. Pipeline 1 included prediction of MHC Class I and Class II epitopes contained in the SARS-CoV-2 proteome and allergens along with alignment and elaborate ranking approaches. Pipeline 2 involved alignment of SARS-CoV-2 overlapping peptides with known allergen-derived T cell epitopes. Our results indicate a large number of MHC Class I epitope pairs including known as well as de novo predicted allergen T cell epitopes with high probability for cross-reactivity. Allergen sources, such as Aspergillus fumigatus , Phleum pratense and Dermatophagoides species are of particular interest due to their association with multiple cross-reactive candidate peptides, independently of the applied bioinformatic approach. In contrast, peptides derived from food allergens, as well as MHC class II epitopes did not achieve high in silico ranking and were therefore not further investigated. Our findings warrant further experimental confirmation along with examination of the functional importance of such cross-reactive responses.","Balz, Kathrin; Chen, Meng; Kaushik, Abhinav; Cemic, Franz; Heger, Vanessa; Renz, Harald; Nadeau, Kari; Skevaki, Chrysanthi",,,387

However, there is limited availability of psychometric measures to document COVID-19-related anxiety among the general public. Objectives: This study was aimed at developing a validated scale to measure COVID-19-related anxiety. Methods: Three hundred and seven subjects from different gender, educational categories participated in the study. Exploratory factor analysis for the determination of factor structure, Pearson's correlation test, and Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA were employed in data analysis using SPSS version 20 software. Results: COVID-19 Anxiety Scale (CAS) demonstrated a two-component structure identified as: ""fear of social interaction;"" ""illness anxiety."" The final scale with seven items demonstrated good internal consistency reliability (Cronbach's Alpha 0.736). CAS exhibited good construct validity showing moderately negative correlation (Pearson's r = -0.417) with the self-rated mental health and resulted in higher scores among individuals with lower educational qualification (Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA &#967;2 [2, 303] = 38.01; P = 0.001). Conclusion: CAS is a rapidly administrable, valid, and reliable tool that can be used to measure COVID-19-related anxiety among the Indian population.","Chandu, Viswa Chaitanya; Pachava, Srinivas; Vadapalli, Viswanath; Marella, Yamuna",Indian J Public Health,,387

378037,CoVID-19: Parent and caregiver concerns about reopening New Zealand schools,2020,"Tests used to diagnose illness commonly have imperfect accuracy, with some false-positive and negative results. For risk assessment and clinical decisions, predictive values are of interest. Positive predictive value (PPV) is the chance that a member of a relevant population who tests positive has been ill. Negative predictive value (NPV) is the chance that someone who tests negative has not been ill. The medical literature regularly reports sensitivity and specificity. Sensitivity is the chance that an ill person receives a positive test result. Specificity is the chance that a nonill person receives a negative result. Knowledge of sensitivity and specificity enables one to predict the test result given a person's illness status. These predictions are not directly relevant to patient care but, given knowledge of sensitivity and specificity, PPV and NPV can be derived if one knows the prevalence of the disease, the population rate of illness. There is considerable uncertainty about the prevalence of some diseases, a notable case being COVID-19. This paper addresses the problem of identification of PPV and NPV given knowledge of sensitivity and specificity and given bounds on prevalence. I explain the problem and show how to bound PPV and NPV as well as the risk ratio and difference, which are functions thereof. I apply the findings to COVID-19 antibody tests. I question the realism of supposing that sensitivity and specificity are known.","Manski, Charles F",Epidemiology,,387

Deemed an infodemic by the World Health Organization, and described as an overabundance of information, some accurate, some not, that occurs during an epidemic, this proliferation of data, research and opinions provides both opportunities and challenges for academics. Academics and scientists have a key role to play in the solutions to the infodemic challenge: as educators, influences and communicators, even where their expertise and experience does not align precisely with the SARS-Cov2 virus and its impacts. Successful communication requires a better understanding of how the public seeks, understands and processes scientific information, however, in order to maximise the ways in which experts engage with traditional and social media and to make sure that such engagement does not add to confusion and misinformation alongside efforts to counter or challenge it. This paper will outline the key advantages to be had from greater engagement with COVID19 discussions, the popular channels through which such discussions take place and through which information is disseminated. It also warns against the common pitfalls those who choose to engage might encounter, whilst stressing that the disadvantages of doing so are far outweighed by the advantages such engagement offers.","Cole, Jennifer",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.08787v1.pdf,387

It is unclear if they can predict the clinical outcomes among hospitalized COVID-19 patients. We aim to assess if elevations in AST/ALT were associated with poor outcomes in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Methods: We retrospectively evaluated hospitalized COVID-19 patients with clinically significant elevated aminotransferases (defined as >2 times upper limit of normal) and compared them with COVID-19 patients without an elevation in aminotransferases. Results: The prevalence of elevation in AST/ALT was found to be 13.7% (20/145). The two groups were similar in baseline demographics, comorbidities, and the majority of laboratory tests. There was no difference in the mortality (50% vs. 36.8%, P = 0.32) and median hospital stay (7 days vs. 7 days, P = 0.78). However, there was a statistically significant increase in the rates of mechanical ventilation among elevated aminotransferases group compared with individuals without elevation (50% vs. 24%, P = 0.028). However, this difference was not observed after adjusting for inflammatory markers such as ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase, and lactic acid levels. Conclusion: Elevated aminotransferases among hospitalized COVID-19 patients is associated with higher rates of mechanical ventilation but did not achieve statistical significance after controlling for inflammatory markers. Also, patients with elevated aminotransferases did not have higher rates of mortality or prolonged length of stay.","Ramachandran, Preethi; Perisetti, Abhilash; Gajendran, Mahesh; Chakraborti, Abhishek; Narh, Joshua T; Goyal, Hemant",,,387

Diabetes is also one of the most common causes of morbidity and associated complications. Identification of prognostic markers like glycated hemoglobin can help early categorization of patients and their better management. Aims and Objectives: To determine if Glycated Hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels are associated with radiological severity of COVID -19 disease, thereby predict prognosis in COVID -19 patients. Its association with D dimer and IL-6 was also evaluated to assess hypercoagulability and systemic inflammation in these patients. Materials and Methods: A monocentric retrospective observational study was conducted during admission period from August 1, 2020- October 31, 2020. HbA1c levels of 188 patients who tested positive for COVID-19 in a dedicated COVID-19 tertiary care center (L.N. Medical college and J.K. Hospital, Bhopal) were determined. They were divided into 2 groups: A (HbA1c level ≤6.5 %), B (HbA1c level &gt;6.5 %). Severity of disease in terms of lung involvement in HRCT Chest was recorded. Their SpO2 and oxygen requirement at admission was also recorded. Among laboratory investigations, D dimer, IL6 Levels were obtained. Results: Out of 188 COVID-19 positive patients included in our study, there were 132 men, 56 women. Median age of patients was 66 years. Mean HbA1c level was 7.2%. Of these, 87 had normal HBA1C and 101 had raised HBA1C &gt;6.5%. Oxygen was required in 58 patients with raised HbA1c (RR of 2.782, p value&lt;0.0001), of which 42 patients had severe lung involvement (RR of 2.498, p value=0.0003). 20 (22.9%) patients with normal HbA1c required oxygen on admission, out of which 11 (12.6%) patients had severe lung involvement. Those who had higher HbA1c levels, had higher chances of severe lung involvement (&gt;50%) in radiological evaluation (RR 2.783, p-value 0.0003, Positive Likelihood ratio: 2.78, 95% CI: 1.60 to 4.83, 85% specificity).Significant increase in D dimer was seen in 77 (76.2%) patients with raised HbA1c compared to 40 patients (45.9%) with normal HbA1c(RR-1.6582, p-value 0.0001). No significant relation between HbA1c levels with IL-6 was found. Conclusion: Patients with raised HBA1C contracting COVID-19 have more severe inflammation and greater lung involvement, higher chances of oxygen requirement and are associated with higher risk of hypercoagulability. HbA1C will not only help identify hyperglycemia but also help assess severity of disease (both clinically and radiologically), systemic inflammation, hypercoagulability, thereby helps in predicting prognosis, managing patients and hasten recovery.

383438,Hypertension and diabetes in Zanzibar - prevalence and access to care,2020,"COVID-19 and arboviruses (ARBOD) epidemics co-occurrence is a great concern. In tropical and subtropical regions, ARBOD diseases such as chikungunya, dengue, and Zika are frequent. In both COVID-19 and ARBOD cases, an accurate diagnosis of infected patients is crucial to promote adequate treatment and isolation measures in COVID-19 cases. Overlap of clinical symptoms and laboratory parameters between COVID-19 and ARBOD present themselves as an extra challenge during diagnosis. COVID-19 diagnosis is mainly performed by quantitative reverse polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), while ARBOD diagnosis is performed by serology, detection of antigen or antibody, and molecular diagnosis. In this review, the epidemiologic profile of arboviruses and SARS-CoV-2 is analyzed, and potential risks of symptom overlap is addressed. The implementation of an analytical platform based on infrared (IR) spectroscopy, MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, and RT-qPCR is discussed as an efficient strategy for a fast, robust, reliable, and cost-effective diagnosis system even during the co-occurrence of virus outbreaks. The spectral data of IR spectroscopy and MALDI-TOF MS obtained from COVID-19 infected and recovered patients can be used to build up an integrated spectral database. This approach can enable us to determine quickly the groups that have been exposed and have recovered from COVID-19 or ARBOD, avoiding misdiagnoses.","Costa, Jéssica; Ferreira, Eugénio C; Santos, Cledir",,,387

GapmeR is a cell-permeating antisense single-stranded DNA molecule that can be designed to specifically target intracellular severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Once internalized into host cells, such as lung alveolar cells, GapmeR molecules can bind to the viral RNA. This RNA/DNA hybrid will then be degraded by the RNase H enzyme abundantly present in the host cells. GapmeRs can be delivered to COVID-19 patients through inhalation or via nebulization. SARS-CoV-2-targeted GapmeR can also be given to frontline healthcare workers as a prophylactic protection. The recombinant ACE2 protein, the efficacy of which is being evaluated in clinical trials, will bind to the spike (S) glycoprotein of extracellular SARS-CoV-2 and potentially block viral infectivity. We propose that combining inhalable SARS-CoV-2-targeted GapmeRs with recombinant ACE2 could provide a viable and rapidly implementable more effective therapeutic approach for eradicating SARS-CoV-2 and save millions of lives.","Verma, Navin Kumar; Fazil, Mobashar Hussain Urf Turabe; Duggan, Shane P.; Kelleher, Dermot",Front.

Laboratory personnel in blood transfusion departments may be infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) if laboratory biosafety protection is insufficient. Therefore, we investigated the current situation of laboratory biosafety protection in blood transfusion departments to determine how to improve the safety of laboratory processes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An online survey was conducted in blood transfusion departments from 1st to 6th May 2020 in China. A total of 653 individuals completed the questionnaire. The questionnaire was designed with reference to COVID-19 laboratory biosafety summarized in Annex II. All responses were summarized using only descriptive statistics and expressed as frequencies and ratios [n (%)]. RESULTS: Most participants were concerned about COVID-19. Some participants had inadequate knowledge of COVID-19. Two participants stated that there were laboratory personnel infected with SARS-CoV-2 in their departments. A total of 31 (4.7%) participants did not receive any safety and security training. In terms of laboratory biosafety protection practices, the major challenges were suboptimal laboratory safety practices and insufficient laboratory conditions. CONCLUSION: The major deficiencies were insufficient security and safety training, and a lack of personal protective equipment, automatic cap removal centrifuges and biosafety cabinets. Consequently, we should enhance the security and safety training of laboratory personnel to improve their laboratory biosafety protection practices and ensure that laboratory conditions are sufficient to improve the safety of laboratory processes.","Liu, Haiting; Liu, Leping; Zhang, Junhua; Shang, Xueling; Chen, Sai; Li, Xisheng; Gui, Rong; Huang, Rong",Vox sang,,387
386291,Responding to a Population Mental Health Crisis,2020,"Recent surges in SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) call for the need to evaluate levels of vaccine-and infection-induced SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies (NAbs). CoronaVac (Sinovac Biotech, Beijing, China) is currently being used for mass vaccination in Thailand as well as other low-income countries. Three VOCs currently circulating within Thailand include the B.1.1.7 (Alpha), B.1.351 (Beta), and B.1.617.2 (Delta) strains. We assessed NAb potency against the prototypic strain containing the original spike sequence (WT) compared to that against the 3 VOCs using sera derived from a cohort of healthcare workers who received a full 2-dose regimen of CoronaVac. Sera from two other cohorts consisting of COVID-19 patients who had been hospitalized in 2020 and 2021 were evaluated for comparison. We found that, despite equally robust production of S1-RBD-binding IgG and 100% seropositivity, sera from both CoronaVac vaccinees and naturally infected individuals had significantly reduced neutralizing capacity against all 3 VOCs compared to WT. Strikingly, NAb titers against Alpha and Beta were comparable, but Delta appears to be significantly more refractory to NAbs in all groups. Our results may help inform on CoronaVac NAb-inducing capacity, which is a proxy for vaccine efficacy, in the context of the WT strain and 3 VOCs. Our results also have critical implications for public health decision-makers who may need to maintain efficient mitigation strategies amid a potentially high risk for infection with VOCs even in those who have been previously infected.","Vacharathit, Vimvara; Aiewsakun, Pakorn; Manopwisedjaroen, Suwimon; Srisaowakarn, Chanya; Laopanupong, Thanida; Ludowyke, Natali; Phuphuakrat, Angsana; Setthaudom, Chavachol; Ekronarongchai, Supanuch; Srichatrapimuk, Sirawat; Wongsirisin, Pattama; Sangrajrang, Suleeporn; Imsuwansri, Thanarath; Kirdlarp, Suppachok; Nualkaew, Sureeporn; Sensorn, Insee; Sawaengdee, Waritta; Wichukchinda, Nuanjun; Sungkanuparph, Somnuek; Chantratita, Wasun; Kunakorn, Mongkol; Rojanamatin, Jinda; Hongeng, Suradej; Thitithanyanont, Arunee",,,387

However, textual radiological reports also contain relevant information for determining the likelihood of presenting radiological signs of COVID-19 involving lungs. The development of COVID-19 automatic detection systems based on Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques could provide a great help in supporting clinicians and detecting COVID-19 related disorders within radiological reports. In this paper we propose a text classification system based on the integration of different information sources. The system can be used to automatically predict whether or not a patient has radiological findings consistent with COVID-19 on the basis of radiological reports of chest CT. To carry out our experiments we use 295 radiological reports from chest CT studies provided by the ''HT médica"" clinic. All of them are radiological requests with suspicions of chest involvement by COVID-19. In order to train our text classification system we apply Machine Learning approaches and Named Entity Recognition. The system takes two sources of information as input: the text of the radiological report and COVID-19 related disorders extracted from SNOMED-CT. The best system is trained using SVM and the baseline results achieve 85% accuracy predicting lung involvement by COVID-19, which already offers competitive values that are difficult to overcome. Moreover, we apply mutual information in order to integrate the best quality information extracted from SNOMED-CT. In this way, we achieve around 90% accuracy improving the baseline results by 5 points.","López-Úbeda, Pilar; Díaz-Galiano, Manuel Carlos; Martín-Noguerol, Teodoro; Luna, Antonio; Ureña-López, L Alfonso; Martín-Valdivia, M Teresa",Comput Biol Med,,387

We found 22.3% of participants had severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) receptor binding domain IgG titers above prepandemic levels. After accounting for waning antibody levels, age, and sex, we estimated that 38.3% (95% credible interval 31.8%-46.5%) of the population had been infected with SARS-CoV-2. At this rate, for each PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection reported by the Ministry of Health, 103 (95% credible interval 86-126) infections would have been unreported, meaning SARS-CoV-2 has likely spread extensively within Juba. We also found differences in background reactivity in Juba compared with Boston, Massachusetts, USA, where the immunoassay was validated.

However, at the infection onset, SOT displayed lower IgG seroconversion rates (77% vs. 100%; p = .044), despite no differences on IgG titers, and a trend toward decreased SARS-CoV-2-reactive T cell frequencies, especially against the membrane protein (7 [0-34] vs. 113 [15-245], p = .011, 2 [0-9] vs. 45 [5-74], p = .009, and 0 [0-2] vs. 13 [1-24], p = .020, IFN-Î³, IL-2, and IFN-Î³/IL-2 spots, respectively). In summary, our data suggest that despite a certain initial delay, SOT population achieve comparable functional immune responses than the general population after moderate/severe COVID-19.","Favà, Alexandre; Donadeu, Laura; Sabé, Nuria; Pernin, Vincent; González-Costello, José; Lladó, Laura; Meneghini, Maria; Charmetant, Xavier; García-Romero, Elena; Cachero, Alba; Torija, Alba; Rodriguez-Urquia, Ronny; Crespo, Elena; Teubel, Iris; Melilli, Edoardo; Montero, Nuria; Manonelles, Anna; Preyer, Rosemarie; Strecker, Kevin; Ovize, Anne; Lozano, Juan J; Sidorova, Julia; Cruzado, Josep M; Le Quintrec, Moglie; Thaunat, Olivier; Bestard, Oriol",Am. j. transplant,,387

Two human imposed constraints are the risk-aversion and the profit maximization, which together define a nonlinear optimization problem with a model-dependent solution. In this context, an optimal fixed frequency hedging strategy can be determined a posteriori by maximizing a sharpe ratio simil path dependent reward function. Sampling from Heston processes, a convolutional neural network was trained to infer which period is optimal using partial information, thus leading to a dynamic hedging strategy in which the portfolio is hedged at various frequencies, each weighted by the probability estimate of that frequency being optimal.","Mazzei, G.; Bellora, F.

390301,Influence of the COVID-19 Outbreak on Disease Activity and Quality of Life in Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patients,2021,"Background: A disruption of the crosstalk between gut and lung has been implicated as a driver of severity during several respiratory-related diseases. Lung injury causes systemic inflammation, which disrupts gut barrier integrity, increasing the permeability to gut microbes and their products. This exacerbates inflammation, resulting in positive feedback. We applied a multi-omic systems biology approach to investigate the potential link between loss of gut barrier integrity and Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) severity. Methods: We analyzed plasma samples from age and gender-matched COVID-19 patients (n=60) with varying disease severity (mild, moderate, and severe) and 20 SARS-CoV2 negative controls. We measured markers and drivers of tight junction permeability and microbial translocation using ELISA;inflammation and immune activation markers using ELISA and multiplex cytokine arrays;untargeted metabolomic and lipidomic analyses using mass spectrometry;and plasma glycomes using capillary electrophoresis and lectin microarray. False discovery rate (FDR) was calculated to account for multiple comparisons. Results: Our data indicate, first, that severe COVID-19 is associated with a dramatic increase in the level of zonulin (FDR&lt;0.00001), the only known physiological driver of intestinal tight junction permeability. This increased permeability associated with translocation of both bacterial (LPS binding protein (LBP) levels) and fungal (β-glucan levels) products into blood (FDR&lt;0.01). The degree of intestinal permeability and microbial translocation strongly correlated with increased systemic inflammation (correlations with IL-6 and other inflammatory cytokines and markers) (FDR&gt;0.05). Second, levels of metabolomic and lipidomic markers of gut and gut microbiota functionality including citrulline (a marker of healthy gut;decreased), succinic acid, and tryptophan catabolism metabolites (markers of microbial dysbiosis;increased) were disrupted during severe COVID-19 (FDR&lt;0.05). Finally, the gut microbiome is known to release enzymes that degrade plasma glycans, which regulate inflammation and complement activation. Indeed, severe COVID-19 was associated with loss of the anti-complement activation galactosylated glycans from plasma and IgG glycoproteins (FDR&lt;0.05). Conclusion: Our data provide multiple layers of evidence that a previously unappreciated factor with significant clinical implications, disruption in gut barrier integrity, is a potential force that contributes to COVID-19 severity.","Giron, L.

So far (January 2021), only the antiviral remdesivir has been approved, although no significant benefits in terms of mortality and clinical improvement were recently reported. In a setting where effective and safe treatments for COVID-19 are urgently needed, drug repurposing may take advantage of the fact that the safety profile of an agent is already well known and allows rapid investigation of the efficacy of potential treatments, at lower costs and with reduced risk of failure. Furthermore, novel pharmaceutical formulations of older agents (e.g., aerosolized administration of chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir, heparin, pirfenidone) have been tested in order to increase pulmonary delivery and/or antiviral effects of potentially active drugs, thus overcoming pharmacokinetic issues. In our review, we will highlight the importance of the drug repurposing strategy in the context of COVID-19, including regulatory and ethical aspects, with a specific focus on novel pharmaceutical formulations and routes of administration.","Gatti, Milo; De Ponti, Fabrizio",,,387

Using these modalities, we probe the structure from the molecular to the cellular scale. Holographic projection images on freeze-dried cells have been recorded using highly coherent and divergent x-ray waveguide radiation. Phase retrieval and tomographic reconstruction then yield the three-dimensional electron density distribution with a voxel size below 50 nm. In the reconstruction volume, myofibrils, sarcomeric organization, and mitochondria can be visualized and quantified within a single cell without sectioning. Next, we use microfocusing optics by compound refractive lenses to probe the diffraction signal of the actomyosin lattice. Comparison between recordings of chemically fixed and untreated, living cells indicate that the characteristic lattice distances shrink by â¼10% upon fixation.","Reichardt, Marius; Neuhaus, Charlotte; Nicolas, Jan-David; Bernhardt, Marten; Toischer, Karl; Salditt, Tim",Biophys. j,,387

This is undesirable, especially for highly multivariate settings, where popular cross-covariance functions such as the multivariate Mat\'ern suffer from a ``curse of dimensionality'' as the number of parameters and floating point operations scale up in quadratic and cubic order, respectively, in the number of variables. We propose a class of multivariate ``Graphical Gaussian Processes'' using a general construction called ``stitching'' that crafts cross-covariance functions from graphs and ensures process-level conditional independence among variables. For the Mat\'ern family of functions, stitching yields a multivariate GP whose univariate components are Mat\'ern GPs, and conforms to process-level conditional independence as specified by the graphical model. For highly multivariate settings and decomposable graphical models, stitching offers massive computational gains and parameter dimension reduction. We demonstrate the utility of the graphical Mat\'ern GP to jointly model highly multivariate spatial data using simulation examples and an application to air-pollution modelling.","Dey, Debangan; Datta, Abhirup; Banerjee, Sudipto",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.04837v3.pdf,387

Whether the alveolar compartmentalization of biomarkers has a clinical significance in patients with pneumonia-related ARDS is unknown. This study aimed at assessing the interrelation of ARDS/sepsis biomarkers in the alveolar and blood compartments and explored their association with clinical outcomes. METHODS: Immunocompetent patients with pneumonia-related ARDS admitted between 2014 and 2018 were included in a prospective monocentric study. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid and blood samples were obtained within 48 h of admission. Twenty-two biomarkers were quantified in BAL fluid and serum. HLA-DR+ monocytes and CD8+ PD-1+ lymphocytes were quantified using flow cytometry. The primary clinical endpoint of the study was hospital mortality. Patients undergoing a bronchoscopy as part of routine care were included as controls. RESULTS: Seventy ARDS patients were included. Hospital mortality was 21.4%. The BAL fluid-to-serum ratio of IL-8 was 20 times higher in ARDS patients than in controls (p < 0.0001). ARDS patients with shock had lower BAL fluid-to-serum ratio of IL-1Ra (p = 0.026), IL-6 (p = 0.002), IP-10/CXCL10 (p = 0.024) and IL-10 (p = 0.023) than others. The BAL fluid-to-serum ratio of IL-1Ra was more elevated in hospital survivors than decedents (p = 0.006), even after adjusting for SOFA and driving pressure (p = 0.036). There was no significant association between alveolar or alveolar/blood monocytic HLA-DR or CD8+ lymphocytes PD-1 expression and hospital mortality. CONCLUSIONS: IL-8 was the most compartmentalized cytokine and lower BAL fluid-to-serum concentration ratios of IL-1Ra were associated with hospital mortality in patients with pneumonia-associated ARDS.","Bendib, Inès; Beldi-Ferchiou, Asma; Schlemmer, Frédéric; Surenaud, Mathieu; Maitre, Bernard; Plonquet, Anne; Carteaux, Guillaume; Razazi, Keyvan; Godot, Veronique; Hüe, Sophie; Mekontso Dessap, Armand; de Prost, Nicolas",Crit Care,,387

This article aims to describe key features and the nature of asymptomatic and pauci-symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. The cohort consisted of six participants, three pairs, which were infected with SARS-CoV-2 during February 2020 on board the Diamond Princess. Of the six confirmed (reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction [RT-PCR]) cases, four were initially diagnosed in Japan and two upon their arrival to Israel. Duration of infection was between four days and up to 26 days. Of the six patients, three were completely asymptomatic and the others were pauci-symptomatic. All five patients in whom a computerized tomography (CT) scan was performed had lung pathology. In one patient, infectivity was tested using cell culture and a cytopathic effect was demonstrated. A serology test was performed in three of the patients and all three had a positive immunoglobulin G (IgG) four to eight weeks after disease onset. This case series demonstrates that asymptomatic and pauci-symptomatic patients may play a role in infection transmission by demonstrating probable transmission among asymptomatic spouses and by demonstrating a viable virus via a cell culture.

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to assess the prevalence of COVID-19 misinformation exposure and beliefs, associated factors including psychological distress with misinformation exposure, and the associations between COVID-19 knowledge and number of preventive behaviors. METHODS: A cross-sectional online survey was conducted with 1049 South Korean adults in April 2020. Respondents were asked about receiving COVID-19 misinformation using 12 items identified by the World Health Organization. Logistic regression was used to compute adjusted odds ratios (aORs) for the association of receiving misinformation with sociodemographic characteristics, source of information, COVID-19 misinformation belief, and psychological distress, as well as the associations of COVID-19 misinformation belief with COVID-19 knowledge and the number of COVID-19 preventive behaviors among those who received the misinformation. All data were weighted according to the Korea census data in 2018. RESULTS: Overall, 67.78% (n=711) of respondents reported exposure to at least one COVID-19 misinformation item. Misinformation exposure was associated with younger age, higher education levels, and lower income. Sources of information associated with misinformation exposure were social networking services (aOR 1.67, 95% CI 1.20-2.32) and instant messaging (aOR 1.79, 1.27-2.51). Misinformation exposure was also associated with psychological distress including anxiety (aOR 1.80, 1.24-2.61), depressive (aOR 1.47, 1.09-2.00), and posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms (aOR 1.97, 1.42-2.73), as well as misinformation belief (aOR 7.33, 5.17-10.38).

OBJECTIVE: To describe SARS-CoV-2 rates among SNF employees and residents during a non-outbreak time period, we measured cross-sectional SARS-CoV-2 prevalence across multiple sites in the Seattle area. DESIGN: SARS-CoV-2 testing was performed for SNF employees and residents using quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. A subset of employees completed a sociodemographic and symptom questionnaire. PARTICIPANTS: Between March 29 and May 13, 2020, we tested 1583 employees and 1208 residents at 16 SNFs for SARS-CoV-2. MAIN MEASURE: SARS-CoV-2 testing results and symptom report among employees and residents. KEY RESULTS: Eleven of the 16 SNFs had one or more resident or employee test positive. Overall, 46 (2.9%) employees had positive or inconclusive testing for SARS-CoV-2, and among those who completed surveys, most were asymptomatic and involved in direct patient care. The majority of employees tested were female (934, 73%), and most employees were Asian (392, 30%), Black (360, 28%), or white (360, 28%).

408960,Innovation Through Virtualization: Crisis Mental Health Care during Covid-19,2020,"OBJECTIVES: Obesity is a major risk factor of severe forms of COVID-19 but little is known about the post bariatric surgery (BS) setting. We assessed the prevalence of likely COVID-19 and its risk factors in patients followed-up after BS. METHODS: We surveyed 738 patients who underwent BS and were followed-up at our university medical centre. A retrospective comparison of characteristics at baseline, one- year post BS and at the time of lockdown was performed between patients with a COVID-19 likely event (CL) based on a combination of reported symptoms vs. those for whom it was unlikely (CU). RESULTS: CL occurred in 62 (8.4%) patients among whom 4 (6.4%) had severe form requiring hospitalization and 1 (1.6%) died. The CL group had a higher proportion of persistent type 2 diabetes (T2D) at last follow-up (36.2% vs. 20.3%, p=0.01). BMI at the time of lockdown was lower in the CL group (30.2 ± 5.1 vs. 32.8 ± 6.5 kg/m2 ; p<0.01) with higher percent weight loss since BS in the CL group. Severe forms of COVID-19 requiring hospitalization were associated with persistent T2D at last follow-up visit. CONCLUSIONS: In post-bariatric patients, COVID-19 likely events were associated with persistent T2D and lower BMI.","Bel Lassen, Pierre; Poitou, Christine; Genser, Laurent; Marchelli, Florence; Aron-Wisnewsky, Judith; Ciangura, Cécile; Jacques, Flavien; Moreau, Pauline; Oppert, Jean-Michel; Clément, Karine",Obesity (Silver Spring),,387

412786,Rethink how we plan research to shrink COVID health disparities,2021,"BACKGROUND: The health crisis caused by COVID-19 has led many countries to opt for social quarantine of the population. During this quarantine, communication systems have been characterized by disintermediation, the acceleration of digitization and an infodemic (excess and saturation of information). The following debate arises: Do the levels related to the psychotic phenotype and pseudoscientific beliefs related to the interpretation of information vary before and after social quarantine? OBJECTIVES: This research aims to examine the psychological effects of social quarantine on the psychotic phenotype and pseudoscientific beliefs-experiences of the general nonclinical population. The following hypothesis was posed: social quarantine alters the levels of magical thinking, pseudoscientific beliefs and anomalous perceptions due to quarantine. METHODS: A pre- and posttest analysis design was applied based on the difference in means, and complementary Bayesian estimation was performed. A total of 174 Spanish subjects responded to different questionnaires that evaluated psychopathological risks based on psychotic phenotypes, pseudoscientific beliefs and experiences before and after quarantine. RESULTS: Significant differences were obtained for the variables positive psychotic symptoms, depressive symptoms, and certain perceptual alterations (e.g., cenesthetic perceptions), and a significant increase in pseudoscientific beliefs was also observed. The perceptual disturbances that increased the most after quarantine were those related to derealization and depersonalization. However, paranoid perceptions showed the highest increase, doubling the initial standard deviation. These high increases could be related to the delimitation of physical space during social quarantine and distrust towards information communicated by the government to the population. Is it possible that social alarmism generated by the excess of information and pseudoscientific information has increased paranoid perceptual alterations? CONCLUSIONS: Measures taken after quarantine indicate that perceptual disturbances, subclinical psychotic symptoms and beliefs in the pseudoscience have increased. We discuss which elements of quarantine coincide with the social marginality theory and its clinical repercussions.","Escolà-Gascón, Álex; Marín, Francesc-Xavier; Rusiñol, Jordi; Gallifa, Josep",Global Health,,387

The objective of this study was to quantify and describe US adults who delayed dental care due to the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We analyzed cross-sectional responses collected from a nationally representative and long-running panel survey of US adults conducted in late May and early June 2020 (response rate = 70%). The survey included questions about dental care delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, purpose of the delayed dental visits, timing of future dental visits, and demographic information. Pearson's chi-square tests were used to determine if rates of delayed dental care varied by subgroup. A multivariable regression model, adjusted for age, race, Hispanic ethnicity, census division, and rurality, was estimated to predict the odds of reporting delayed dental care. RESULTS: Nearly half of respondents (46.7%) reported delaying going to the dentist or receiving dental care due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Among adults who reported delaying dental care due to the pandemic, 74.7% reported delaying a checkup, 12.4% reported delaying care to address something that was bothering them, and 10.5% reported delaying care to get planned treatment. About 44.4% of adults reported that they planned to visit the dentist within the next 3 mo. In the multivariable regression model, only living in an urban (vs. rural) area was associated with significantly higher odds of delayed dental care due to the pandemic (odds ratio: 1.5; 95% confidence interval: 1.1, 2.1). CONCLUSIONS: Nearly half of US adults reported delaying dental care due to the COVID-19 pandemic during the spring of 2020. Our results offer insight into the experiences of patients seeking dental care this spring and the economic challenges faced by dental providers due to the pandemic. KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER STATEMENT: This article describes US adults who delayed dental care due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Results can be used by clinicians and policymakers to understand delayed care during the pandemic.","Kranz, A M; Gahlon, G; Dick, A W; Stein, B D",JDR Clin Trans Res,,387
417629,Addressing the public mental health challenge of COVID-19,2020,"The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) constitutes the most significant global public health challenge in a century. It has reignited research interest in coronavirus. While little information is available, research is currently in progress to comprehensively understand the general biology and immune response mechanism against SARS-CoV-2. The spike proteins (S protein) of SARS-CoV-2 perform a crucial function in viral infection establishment. ACE2 and TMPRSS2 play a pivotal role in viral entry. Upon viral entry, the released pro-inflammatory proteins (cytokines and chemokines) cause the migration of the T cells, monocytes, and macrophages to the infection site. IFNÏ released by T cells initiates a loop of pro-inflammatory feedback. The inflammatory state may further enhance with an increase in immune dysfunction responsible for the infection's progression. A treatment approach that prevents ACE2-mediated viral entry and reduces inflammatory response is a crucial therapeutic intervention strategy, and nanomaterials and their conjugates are promising candidates. Nanoparticles can inhibit viral entry and replication. Nanomaterials have also found application in targeted drug delivery and also in developing a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2. Here, we briefly summarize the origin, transmission, and clinical features of SARS-CoV-2. We then discussed the immune response mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2. Finally, we further discussed nanotechnology's potentials as an intervention strategy against SARS-CoV-2 infection. All these understandings will be crucial in developing therapeutic strategies against SARS-CoV-2.","Mba, Ifeanyi Elibe; Sharndama, Hyelnaya Cletus; Osondu-Chuka, Goodness Ogechi; Okeke, Onyekachi Philomena",Infect Dis (Lond),,387
417764,Impact of the 2020 COVID-19 Pandemic on Ambulatory Hepatitis C Testing,2020,"AimsDuring the first wave of coronavirus pandemic, many Psychiatry outpatient appointments moved rapidly to remote or ‘virtual’ to protect patients and staff from infection. Telephone consultations do not allow assessment of appearance or other visual aspects of behaviour/affect, yet these are core components of Mental State Examination. Videoconsultation software was unfamiliar to many mental health clinicians, with obstacles including hardware availability, software provision and skills, data security as well as lack of clinican motivation and confidence preventing rapid uptake. I wanted to take advantage of excellent IT support, and NHS England funding of software licence, to drive introduction of Attend Anywhere patient videoconsultation (‘telepsychiatry’) software within my local ADAPT (Anxiety, Depression and Personality Disorder,Trauma) Community Mental Health Team from April 2020 onwards.MethodI assembled a small group of clinicans to take part in a local pilot of Attend Anywhere software. One Care Coordinator, a Consultant Psychologist, two Consultant Psychiatrists and myself completed satisfaction and confidience scores throughout an 8 week period. Number of videoconsultation outpatient appointments offered to and accepted by patients were also recorded. Weekly group meetings were deemed impossible to schedule given pandemic workloads, so we used 1:1 quick remote catchups, identifying and troubleshooting obstacles, working with IT implement a work-around when the team hit a technical brick wall.ResultClinician confidence and satisfaction increased significantly during this period, as did number of offered & completed video consultations.Attend Anywhere consultations were used for up to 25% of clinician weekly workload.Clinicians who manage their own diaries started quicklyIt was difficult to successfully engage Administration team to organise Attend Anywhere test calls, leading to slow uptake for Consultant Psychiatrists who do not manage their own diaries.ConclusionPatient obstacles to use of Attend Anywhere appeared to be idiosyncratic and multifactorial, including poverty, digital exclusion, lack of privacy at home, and clinical history of online grooming. However, some patients already used Attend Anyhwere software with their physical health teams, while others prefer videocall to phone. Age was not an obstacle.Once this small group of clinicians began to use software successfully, it had a snowball effect within the team and other clinicians asked to sign up for the service. Full support from Administration teams will be crucial to increasing videocalls within the service. Clinicians suggested offering videoconsultation as an opt-out service and requested additional functionality from the software to widen use.","Collins, Phoebe krall Karin",BJPsych Open,,387
418151,The trend of girl child marriage in Iran based on national census data,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Several studies have reported the beneficial effect of glucocorticoids in the treatment of cytokine storm that occurs in patients with severe COVID-19. Various glucocorticoids regimens have been proposed. METHODS: Retrospective observational study that includes patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia and compares admission to an Intensive Care Unit (ICU) or death during hospitalization in three groups of patients: no glucocorticoids treatment, use of glucocorticoids doses equivalent to less than 250mg of prednisone daily and use of equivalent doses greater than or equal to 250mg of prednisone daily. Multivariate analysis was performed using logistic regression, using the propensity index as a covariant. RESULTS: Of the 259 patients enrolled in the study, 67 (25.9%) had an unfavorable evolution, dying or requiring ICU admission. Comparative analyzes between different glucocorticoids treatments and the association with ICU admission or death were: glucocorticoids treatment (any dose) versus no glucocorticoids treatment (OR: 0.71 [0.30-1.66]), treatment with glucocorticoids (&#8805;250mg prednisone daily) versus no glucocorticoids treatment (OR: 0.35 [0.11-1.08]) and glucocorticoids treatment (&#8805;250mg prednisone daily) versus patients with glucocorticoids doses <250mg prednisone daily or without glucocorticoids treatment (OR: 0.30 [0.10-0.88]). CONCLUSION: The results of this study show that patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia treated with glucocorticoids pulses with equivalent doses of prednisone greater than or equal to 250mg have a more favorable evolution (less mortality and less admission to ICU).","Pascual Pareja, José Francisco; García-Caballero, Rebeca; Soler Rangel, Llanos; Vázquez-Ronda, Miguel Angel; Roa Franco, Silvia; Navarro Jiménez, Gema; Moreno Palanco, Miguel Angel; González-Ruano, Patricia; López-Menchaca, Ramiro; Ruíz-Seco, Pilar; Pagán Muñoz, Bárbara; Gómez Gómez, Alejandro; Pérez-Monte, Beatriz; Fuerte Martínez, Rebeca; Valle López, Jose Luis; Muñoz Blanco, Arturo; Rábago Lorite, Isabel; Martínez Martín, Patricia; Serralta San Martín, Gonzalo; Gómez-Cerezo, Jorge Francisco",Med. clin (Ed. impr.),,387
418302,Atlanta's springtime surge preparation aided summer COVID-19 response,2021,"PURPOSE: To identify predictors of patient acceptance of non-in-person cancer genetic visits before and after the COVID-19 pandemic and assess the preferences of health-care professionals. METHODS: Prospective multicenter cohort study (N = 578, 1 February 2018-20 April 2019) and recontacted during the COVID-19 lockdown in April 2020. Health-care professionals participated in May 2020. Association of personality traits and clinical factors with acceptance was assessed with multivariate analysis. RESULTS: Before COVID-19, videoconference was more accepted than telephone-based visits (28% vs. 16% pretest, 30% vs. 19% post-test). Predictors for telephone visits were age (pretest, odds ratio [OR] 10-year increment = 0.79; post-test OR 10Y = 0.78); disclosure of panel testing (OR = 0.60), positive results (OR = 0.52), low conscientiousness group (OR = 2.87), and post-test level of uncertainty (OR = 0.93). Predictors for videoconference were age (pretest, OR 10Y = 0.73; post-test, OR 10Y = 0.75), educational level (pretest: OR = 1.61), low neuroticism (pretest, OR = 1.72), and post-test level of uncertainty (OR = 0.96). Patients' reported acceptance for non-in-person visits after COVID-19 increased to 92% for the pretest and 85% for the post-test. Health-care professionals only preferred non-in-person visits for disclosure of negative results (83%). CONCLUSION: These new delivery models need to recognize challenges associated with age and the psychological characteristics of the population and embrace health-care professionals' preferences.","López-Fernández, Adrià; Villacampa, Guillermo; Grau, Elia; Salinas, Mónica; Darder, Esther; Carrasco, Estela; Torres-Esquius, Sara; Iglesias, Silvia; Solanes, Ares; Gadea, Neus; Velasco, Angela; Urgell, Gisela; Torres, Maite; Tuset, Noemí; Brunet, Joan; Corbella, Sergi; Balmaña, Judith",Genet. med,,387
418691,Challenges and opportunities for early career child mental health professionals during the COVID19 pandemic,2020,"OBJECTIVES: Studies have shown that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is primarily transmitted from person to person via airborne droplets. It is unclear whether it can be shed into human milk and transmitted to a child via breastfeeding. We investigated the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in human milk samples of 15 mothers with coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) and in the throat swab samples of their infants. METHODS: This is a prospective observational study in which breast milk samples were collected from 15 mothers with COVID-19. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the whole human milk samples of the patients was investigated using RT-qPCR. All of the infants underwent a clinical follow-up during their 14-day isolation and their throat swab samples were tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. RESULTS: Of 15 mothers with COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in milk samples from 4 mothers. The throat swab samples from these mothers' infants were found to be positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Three of the four mothers were breastfeeding. In addition, during the 14-day isolation, all but three of the mothers breastfed their infants. Of the 12 breastfed infants, while the test for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in throat swab samples was negative in 6 of the infants, the other 6 infants, who had mild COVID-19 symptoms, tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Clinical outcomes of all mothers and infants were uneventful. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the first case series with the largest number of cases with SARS-CoV-2 RNA positivity in human milk samples of mothers with COVID-19. However, we believe that the benefits of breastfeeding may outweigh the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection in infants.","Kilic, Talat; Kilic, Sebnem; Berber, Nurcan Kirici; Gunduz, Ayten; Ersoy, Yasemin",Int J Clin Pract,,387

424686,Webcast: Maintaining good mental health during COVID,2021,"Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and Influenza A are common disease caused by viral infection. The clinical symptoms and transmission routes of the two diseases are similar. However, there are no relevant studies on laboratory diagnostic models to discriminate COVID-19 and influenza A. This study aims at establishing a signature of laboratory findings to tell patients with COVID-19 apart from those with influenza A perfectly. Materials: In this study, 56 COVID-19 patients and 54 influenza A patients were included. Laboratory findings, epidemiological characteristics and demographic data were obtained from electronic medical record databases. Elastic network models, followed by a stepwise logistic regression model were implemented to identify indicators capable of discriminating COVID-19 and influenza A. A nomogram is diagramed to show the resulting discriminative model. Results: The majority of hematological and biochemical parameters in COVID-19 patients were significantly different from those in influenza A patients. In the final model, albumin/globulin (A/G), total bilirubin (TBIL) and erythrocyte specific volume (HCT) were selected as predictors. Using an external dataset, the model was validated to perform well. Conclusion: A diagnostic model of laboratory findings was established, in which A/G, TBIL and HCT were included as highly relevant indicators for the segmentation of COVID-19 and influenza A, providing a complimentary means for the precise diagnosis of these two diseases.","Xing, Dongyang; Tian, Suyan; Chen, Yukun; Wang, Jinmei; Sun, Xuejuan; Li, Shanji; Xu, Jiancheng",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.11889v1.pdf,387

The Lincolnshire partnership National Health Service (NHS) foundation Trust successfully delivered PrAISED through a video-calling platform during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. METHODS: This qualitative case-study aimed to identify participants that video delivery worked for, to highlight its benefits and its challenges. Interviews were conducted between May and August 2020 with five participants with dementia and their caregivers (n = 10), as well as five therapists from the Lincolnshire partnership NHS foundation Trust. The interviews were analysed through thematic analysis. RESULTS: Video delivery worked best when participants had a supporting caregiver and when therapists showed enthusiasm and had an established rapport with the client. Benefits included time efficiency of sessions, enhancing participants' motivation, caregivers' dementia awareness, and therapists' creativity. Limitations included users' poor IT skills and resources. DISCUSSION: The COVID-19 pandemic required innovative ways of delivering rehabilitation. This study supports that people with dementia can use tele-rehabilitation, but success is reliant on having a caregiver and an enthusiastic and known therapist.","Di Lorito, Claudio; Duff, Carol; Rogers, Carol; Tuxworth, Jane; Bell, Jocelyn; Fothergill, Rachael; Wilkinson, Lindsey; Bosco, Alessandro; Howe, Louise; O039,; Brien, Rebecca; Godfrey, Maureen; Dunlop, Marianne; van der Wardt, Veronika; Booth, Vicky; Logan, Pip; Cowley, Alison; Harwood, Rowan H",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,387

A national cross-sectional survey among 1205 adults was conducted in April 2020 in Greece. Multivariable ordered logistic regression models were used to estimate the association between COVID-19 related attitudes and knowledge and adoption of preventive behaviors, controlling for socioeconomic and health-related characteristics. A total of 923 individuals fully completed the survey. Individuals who believed that the virus is out of control, is transmitted through the air, and is not similar to the common flu were more likely to adopt public health preventive behaviors more frequently, particularly wearing masks in public spaces, washing their hands, and spending fewer hours out of their homes. Uncertainty about the virus symptomatology was associated with less frequent mask-wearing and handwashing. Increased social support, frequent media use for COVID-19 updates, trust to authorities, older age, worse health status, female gender and being a healthcare professional were also associated with uptake of some preventive health behaviors. Attitudinal and socioeconomic determinants critically affect public engagement in preventive behaviors. Health policy initiatives should focus on community outreach approaches to raise awareness and to strengthen social support mechanisms by integrating multiple stakeholders.","Souliotis, Kyriakos; Giannouchos, Theodoros V; Peppou, Lily E; Samara, Myrto T; Nimatoudis, John; Papageorgiou, Charalambos; Economou, Marina",Inquiry,,387

427192,Supporting the Mental Health Needs of Adolescent Fathers during COVID-19: Opportunities for Nursing Practice and Community-Based Partnerships,2020,"Background: Lianhuaqingwen (LH) has been proven effective for influenza. However, the promotion of LH for the treatment of patients with COVID-19 remains controversial. Therefore, our study aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of Lianhuaqingwen (LH) in treating patients with COVID-19 by a systematic review and meta-analysis. Methods: We conducted the literature search using six electronic databases from December 1, 2019, to June 2, 2020. Cochrane Risk of Bias tool has been used to assess the quality of randomized controlled trials. Newcastle-Ottawa Scale has been used to assess the quality of case control studies. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality checklist has been used to assess the quality of case series. All analyses were conducted by RevMan 5.3. For outcomes that could not be meta-analyzed were performed a descriptive analysis. Results: Eight studies with 924 patients were included. Three studies are RCTs, three are case control studies, and two are case series. The quality of the included studies was poor. Compared with patients treated by conventional treatment, patients treated by LH combined with conventional treatment have a higher overall effective rate (RRâ¯=â¯1.16, 95%CIs: 1.04â¼1.30, Pâ¯=â¯0.01) and CT recovery rate (RR=1.21, 95%CIs: 1.02â¼1.43, Pâ¯=â¯0.03). Patients of LH groups have a lower incidence of diarrhea (5.6% vs.13.4%), and have statistically significant (Pâ¯=â¯0.026). But the rate of abnormal liver function in the combined medication group is higher than that in the single LH group. Conclusion: LH combined with conventional treatment seems to be more effective for patients with mild or ordinary COVID-19.","Liu, Ming; Ya, Gao; Yuan, Yuan; Yang, Kelu; Shi, Shuzhen; Tian, Jinhui; Zhang, Junhua",Integr Med Res,,387

We consider the application of deep learning techniques to distinguish individuals with COVID from non-COVID by using data acquirable from a phone. Using cough and context (symptoms and meta-data) represent such a promising approach. Several independent works in this direction have shown promising results. However, none of them report performance across clinically relevant data splits. Specifically, the performance where the development and test sets are split in time (retrospective validation) and across sites (broad validation). Although there is meaningful generalization across these splits the performance significantly varies (up to 0.1 AUC score). In addition, we study the performance of symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals across these three splits. Finally, we show that our model focuses on meaningful features of the input, cough bouts for cough and relevant symptoms for context.

The racemates were separated by HPLC using chiral columns. Their structures including absolute configurations were elucidated by extensive spectroscopic analysis, electronic circular dichroism (ECD) experiments, and single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. Structurally, (±)-oxypenicinolines A-D shared with an unusual 6/6/5/5 tetracyclic system incorporating a rare tetrahydro-pyrrolyl moiety. A plausible biosynthetic pathway for pyrrolyl 4-quinolone alkaloids is proposed. (±)-oxypenicinoline A and quinolactacide displayed &#945;-glucosidase inhibitory activity with the IC50 values of 317.8 and 365.9 µ&#924;, respectively, which were more potent than that of acarbose (461.0 µM).

Under the (uncorrelated) relaxed clock model, tree branches are associated with molecular substitution rates which are independently and identically distributed. In this article we delved into the internal complexities of the relaxed clock model in order to develop efficient MCMC operators for Bayesian phylogenetic inference. We compared three substitution rate parameterisations, introduced an adaptive operator which learns the weights of other operators during MCMC, and we explored how relaxed clock model estimation can benefit from two cutting-edge proposal kernels: the AVMVN and Bactrian kernels. This work has produced an operator scheme that is up to 65 times more efficient at exploring continuous relaxed clock parameters compared with previous setups, depending on the dataset. Finally, we explored variants of the standard narrow exchange operator which are specifically designed for the relaxed clock model. In the most extreme case, this new operator traversed tree space 40% more efficiently than narrow exchange. The methodologies introduced are adaptive and highly effective on short as well as long alignments. The results are available via the open source optimised relaxed clock (ORC) package for BEAST 2 under a GNU licence (https://github.com/jordandouglas/ORC).","Douglas, Jordan; Zhang, Rong; Bouckaert, Remco",PLoS Comput Biol,,387

Despite these intensive research efforts, vaccine hesitancy and misinformation in many countries present substantial obstacles to achieving sufficient coverage and community immunity. Here, we report the findings of a survey regarding the likelihood of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance in a sample of physicians in Turkey. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An anonymous web-based survey was prepared and sent to medical doctors randomly selected from seven parts of Turkey via a text message sent to their mobile phones. Demographic data were collected, including sex (male or female), medical specialty, age, professional experience, COVID-19 history, knowledge of COVID-19 vaccines and behaviours related to vaccines against COVID-19 and other diseases. The survey was conducted over a 1-week period in December 2020. RESULTS: A total of 1,557 medical doctors responded to the survey. A total of 1,065 (68.4%) respondents were considering COVID-19 vaccination, 374 (24%) were undecided and 118 (7.6%) did not want to be vaccinated. As a result of multivariate analysis, the male gender, absence of history of COVID-19 infection, and having sufficient information about the vaccine were determined as predictive factors for willingness to vaccination. CONCLUSION: Although trials tend to focus on the efficacy of vaccines, the results of this study indicated that the most important factor affecting the preference for a given vaccine among Turkish physicians is safety.","Civelek, Burak; Yazici, Ozan; Ozdemir, Nuriye; Karacin, Cengiz; Surel, Aziz Ahmet",Int J Clin Pract,,387
437729,Maintaining sexual and reproductive health services in the UK during COVID-19,2021,"Asymptomatic individuals, called “silent spreaders” spread SARS-CoV-2 efficiently and have complicated control of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. As seen in previous influenza pandemics, socioeconomic and life-trajectory factors are important in disease progression and outcome. The demographics of the asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 carriers are unknown. We used the CON-VINCE cohort of healthy, asymptomatic, and oligosymptomatic individuals that is statistically representative of the overall population of Luxembourg for age, gender, and residency to characterise this population. Gender (male), not smoking, and exposure to early-life or adult traumatic experiences increased the risk of IgA seropositivity, and the risk associated with early-life exposure was a dose-dependent metric, while some other known comorbidities of active COVID-19 do not impact it. As prior exposure to adversity is associated with negative psychobiological reactions to external stressors, we recorded psychological wellbeing during the study period. Exposure to traumatic events or concurrent autoimmune or rheumatic disease were associated with a worse evolution of anxiety and depressive symptoms throughout the lockdown period. The unique demographic profile of the “silent spreaders” highlights the role that the early-life period plays in determining our lifelong health trajectory and provides evidence that the developmental origins of health and disease is applicable to infectious diseases.","Holuka, Cyrielle Snoeck Chantal J.; Mériaux, Sophie B.; Ollert, Markus Krüger Rejko Turner Jonathan D.; Consortium, the CON-VINCE",Journal of Clinical Medicine,,387

These solutions are unpalatable and a new flavoured pre-packaged solution was developed. METHOD: After 8 hours of fasting, 27 patients took 500 ml of the modified WHO cholera solution or Glucodrate® on 2 occasions in a crossover random order and urine and stomal output was collected for 6 hours. RESULTS: There was a small but significant difference in net sodium absorption in favour of the modified WHO cholera solution (10±28mmol modified WHO cholera solution vs -1±26mmol Glucodrate®, p=0.01). However the Glucodrate® was more palatable with 24 patients (89%) preferring it to the modified WHO cholera solution (p<0.005). CONCLUSION: Glucodrate® is a more palatable solution than the modified WHO cholera solution and is almost as effective so can be used when patients find the modified WHO cholera solution unpalatable.

However, the association between e-cigarette use and ventricular arrhythmia is unknown. Thus, in this study, we aimed to evaluate the markers of ventricular repolarization such as QT interval, corrected QT (QTc), QT dispersion (QTd), peak-to-end interval of the T wave (Tp-e), corrected Tp-e and Tp-e/QT ratios in e-cigarette users. Methods: The study population consisted 36 e-cigarette users and 40 healthy subjects. Ventricular repolarization parameters were obtained from 12-lead resting electrocardiogram. Ventricular repolarization parameters of the groups were compared. Results: Basal demographic and laboratory data were similar in both groups. According to the electrocardiographic parameters, the Tp-e interval, corrected Tp-e, and Tp-e/QT ratio were significantly higher in individuals using e-cigarettes than in control subjects [74.9±6.4 milliseconds (ms) vs. 80.1±4.1ms, <0.001; 82.9±7.5 ms vs. 87.8±6.3 ms, p=0.003; 0.20±0.01 vs. 0.21±0.01, p=0.002; respectively].

This study was performed to estimate the number of COVID-19 deaths and population-level exposure per province using seasonal all-cause mortality data. METHODS: Time-series data were collected from the National Organization for Civil Registration on the seasonal all-cause mortality from spring 2015 to summer 2020 (from March 21, 2015 to September 21, 2020), in accordance with the Solar Hijri (SH) calendar, to estimate the expected number of seasonal deaths for each province using a piecewise linear regression model. A population-weighted infection fatality ratio was then applied to estimate the level of exposure per province during this period. RESULTS: From the start of winter to the end of summer (from December 22, 2019 to September 21, 2020), there were a total of 58 900 (95% confidence interval 46 900-69 500) excess deaths across all 31 provinces, with 27% (95% confidence interval 20-34%) estimated nationwide exposure to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). In particular, Qom and Golestan were among the hardest-hit provinces, with nearly 57% exposure, while another 27 provinces showed significant levels of excess mortality in at least one season with >20% population-level exposure to the virus. Unexpectedly high levels of excess mortality were also detected during fall 2019 (from September 23 to December 21, 2019) across 18 provinces, unrelated and prior to the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.

441576,Mental health before and during the COVID-19 pandemic: a longitudinal probability sample survey of the UK population,2020,"Background: Health care systems in the United States are continuously expanding and contracting spaces to treat patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in intensive care units (ICUs). As a result, hospitals must effectively decontaminate and contain severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in constructed and deconstructed ICUs that care for patients with COVID-19. We assessed decontamination of a COVID-19 ICU and examined the containment efficacy of combined contact and droplet precautions in creating and maintaining a SARS-CoV-2-negative ICU ""antechamber"". Methods: To examine the efficacy of chemical decontamination, we used high-density, semi-quantitative environmental sampling to detect SARS-CoV-2 on surfaces in a COVID-19 ICU and COVID-19 ICU antechamber. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to measure viral RNA on surfaces. Viral location mapping revealed the distribution of viral RNA in the COVID-19 ICU and COVID-19 ICU antechamber. Results were further assessed using loop-mediated isothermal amplification. Results: We collected 224 surface samples pre-decontamination and 193 samples post-decontamination from a COVID-19 ICU and adjoining COVID-19 ICU antechamber. We found that 46% of antechamber objects were positive for SARS-CoV-2 pre-decontamination despite the construction of a swinging door barrier system, implementation of contact precautions, and installation of high-efficiency particulate air filters. The object positivity rate reduced to 32.1% and viral particle rate reduced by 95.4% following decontamination. Matched items had an average of 432.2 ± 2729 viral copies/cm2 pre-decontamination and 19.2 ± 118 viral copies/cm2 post-decontamination, demonstrating significantly reduced viral surface distribution (p < 0.0001). Conclusions: Environmental sampling is an effective method for evaluating decontamination protocols and validating measures used to contain SARS-CoV-2 viral particles. While chemical decontamination effectively removes detectable viral RNA from surfaces, our approach to droplet/contact containment with an antechamber was not highly effective. These data suggest that hospitals should plan for the potential of aerosolized virions when creating strategies to contain SARS-CoV-2.","Brune, Zarina; Kuschner, Cyrus E; Mootz, Joseph; Davidson, Karina W; Pena, Robert C F; Ghanem, Mustafa H; Fischer, Austin; Gitman, Michael; Teperman, Lewis; Mason, Christopher; Becker, Lance B",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,387

442723,Factors Affecting Delivery Health Service Satisfaction of Women and Fear of COVID- 19: Implications for Maternal and Child Health in Pakistan,2021,"This paper presents a case study of an innovative direct-to-consumer preclinic triage system designed to reduce predicted peak demand for Australian mental health services as a result of COVID-19 and its associated socioeconomic consequences by guiding Australians to the right mental health care first time. Our innovative, digital health solution comprises two components: (1) a highly personalised and measurement-based model of care (Brain and Mind Centre model of care) that considers both the heterogeneity of mental disorders and other underlying comorbidities, as well as clinical staging; and (2) a health information technology (i.e. the InnoWell Platform). This digital health solution has been embedded as part of standard service delivery into a community-based intake service, thus resulting in a redesigned service model. The service model is currently being implemented as part of a pilot feasibility study, the marker of acceptability at the health professional and service level, and is now under active evaluation to determine its effect on outcomes for consumers, health professionals and the service. For the purposes of this paper, this model served as a prototype for the preclinic triage system that was conceptualised for national scalability at the primary health network level. When implemented at a national level, our direct-to-consumer preclinic triage system is expected to be an effective population health demand management strategy to address the rapidly emerging mental health demand crisis in Australia, and is aligned with the recent recommendation from the Productivity Commission to develop a sustainable national digital platform to facilitate the assessment and referral process to ensure access to mental health care matched to an individual's level of need.What is known about the topic?Although there is increased recognition of the mental health demand crisis in Australia as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, little has been done to 'flatten' the curve. The Australian Government committed additional funding to support the Better Access Pandemic Support measure; however, this approach to care fails to appreciate both the disparities in service availability across Australia and the gap fees that are prohibitive to some of those seeking help. Furthermore, the expansion of this program may only result in those in care remaining in care, thus further delaying access to those in need.What does this paper add?This paper describes a digital health solution, comprised of a highly personalised and measurement-based model of care coupled with a health information technology, that has been embedded as part of standard service delivery. Consumers seeking mental health care complete a multidimensional self-report assessment via the technology, the results of which are available in real-time and used to facilitate triage to pathways of care as indicated by the severity of the consumer's illness and level of need to more effectively and efficiently allocate consumers to care. The redesigned service model is now under active evaluation to determine its effects on outcomes at consumer, health professional and service levels.What are the implications for practitioners?The redesigned local service model served as a prototype for our innovative direct-to-consumer preclinic triage system specifically designed to allocate consumers to self-management, ambulatory care or acute care based on clinical stage and level of need. It is our hypothesis that the preclinic triage system will be an effective population health demand management strategy. Importantly, the proposed preclinic triage system aligns with the recent recommendation from the Productivity Commission for the Australian Government to fund the development and sustained implementation of a digital platform to facilitate assessment and referral to evidence-based interventions matched to a consumer's level of need.","Davenport, Tracey A; LaMonica, Haley M; Rowe, Shelley; Sturgess, Julie; Scott, Elizabeth M; Lee, Grace; Cheng, Vanessa Wan Sze; Hickie, Ian B",,,387

443604,"New data reveals 156,000+ lost to MH, SUD issues pre-COVID-19",2021,"Introduction: Efficient identification and isolation of patients with communicable diseases limits exposure to health care workers, other patients, and visitors. In August 2014, our team developed and implemented an algorithm to triage suspected cases of Ebola virus disease in a midwestern United States emergency department and outpatient clinics based on patient travel history and symptoms. Here, we present the lessons learned and modifications to update the tool. Methods: Two strategies were developed and utilized to properly identify, isolate, and inform on patients with suspected highly hazardous communicable diseases: 1) a robust electronic symptom and travel screen with decision support tools in the electronic medical record, and 2) the availability of workflow protocols for Ebola virus disease, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), and coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) once a person under investigation is identified. After action reports provided opportunities to modify the algorithm and improve the identification and isolation processes. Results: Since our screening and travel electronic medical record inception 5 years ago, modifications changed iteratively to further enhance the screening process. Since 2018, staff have identified 5 patients at risk for MERS; in all cases, identification occurred during the check-in process. Exposure investigations in the emergency department decreased significantly after algorithm implementation in January 2019, from 30 in 2018 to 0 in 2019. Discussion: Although highly hazardous communicable diseases like Ebola virus disease and MERS are of concern due to their mortality rates and limited treatment options, these same concepts may be applied to the early identification and isolation of patients suspected of having more common communicable diseases like measles and influenza, emphasizing the importance of protocol-based screening in the healthcare environment.","Schwedhelm, Michelle M; Herstein, Jocelyn J; Watson, Suzanne M; Mead, Amy L; Maddalena, Leo; Liston, Devon D; Hewlett, Angela L",J Emerg Nurs,,387

447947,Coping and Mental Health in Early Adolescence during COVID-19,2021,"Lung sounds acquired by stethoscopes are extensively used in diagnosing and differentiating respiratory diseases. Although an extensive know-how has been built to interpret these sounds and identify diseases associated with certain patterns, its effective use is limited to individual experience of practitioners. This user-dependency manifests itself as a factor impeding the digital transformation of this valuable diagnostic tool, which can improve patient outcomes by continuous long-term respiratory monitoring under real-life conditions. Particularly patients suffering from respiratory diseases with progressive nature, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, are expected to benefit from long-term monitoring. Recently, the COVID-19 pandemic has also shown the lack of respiratory monitoring systems which are ready to deploy in operational conditions while requiring minimal patient education. To address particularly the latter subject, in this article, we present a sound acquisition module which can be integrated into a dedicated garment; thus, minimizing the role of the patient for positioning the stethoscope and applying the appropriate pressure. We have implemented a diaphragm-less acousto-electric transducer by stacking a silicone rubber and a piezoelectric film to capture thoracic sounds with minimum attenuation. Furthermore, we benchmarked our device with an electronic stethoscope widely used in clinical practice to quantify its performance.","Yilmaz, Gürkan; Rapin, Michaël; Pessoa, Diogo; Rocha, Bruno M; de Sousa, Antonio Moreira; Rusconi, Roberto; Carvalho, Paulo; Wacker, Josias; Paiva, Rui Pedro; Chételat, Olivier",,,387

METHODS: Data were from 549 HIV + WOC, who participated in the Health Resources and Services Administration-funded WOC Initiative 2009-2013. We used generalized estimating equation models to quantify the association between the respondents' nativity status and viral suppression. RESULTS: After adjusting for covariates, foreign-born WOC were 2.2 times (95% confidence interval: 1.25, 3.85) more likely to achieve viral suppression than U.S.-born WOC. This association was not modified by education or housing status. CONCLUSIONS: Despite facing barriers to care, foreign-born WOC were more likely to achieve viral suppression than U.S.-born WOC.

Knowledge on their diversity and distribution in Kenya is scanty, limiting development of effective sustainable management strategies. The present study is aimed at identifying whitefly pest species present in Kenya across different agroecological zones and establish predictive models for the most abundant species in Africa. Whiteflies were sampled in Kenya from key crops known to be severely infested and identified using 16S rRNA markers and complete mitochondrial genomes. Four whitefly species were identified: Aleyrodes proletella, Aleurodicus dispersus, Bemisia afer and Trialeurodes vaporariorum, the latter being the most dominant species across all the agroecology. The assembly of complete mitogenomes and comparative analysis of all 13 protein coding genes confirmed the identities of the four species. Furthermore, prediction spatial models indicated high climatic suitability of T. vaporariorum in Africa, Europe, Central America, parts of Southern America, parts of Australia, New Zealand and Asia. Consequently, our findings provide information to guide biosecurity agencies on protocols to be adopted for precise identification of pest whitefly species in Kenya to serve as an early warning tool against T. vaporariorum invasion into unaffected areas and guide appropriate decision-making on their management.","Khamis, Fathiya M; Ombura, Fidelis L O; Ajene, Inusa J; Akutse, Komivi S; Subramanian, Sevgan; Mohamed, Samira A; Dubois, Thomas; Tanga, Chrysantus M; Ekesi, Sunday",Sci Rep,,387

Antiviral therapy, including for COVID-19, is based on clinical practice, experimental data and trial results. The purpose of this review is to: provide and systematize actual preclinical data, clinical trials results and clinical practice for antiviral agent umifenovir (Arbidol). Databases Scopus, Web of Science, RSCI and medRxiv were used for publication searching from 2004. A meta-analysis of clinical trials results was performed. Umifenovir is antiviral agent, it belongs to fusion inhibitors, interacts with SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Umifenovir the impede the trimerization of spike glycoprotein and inhibit host cell adhesion, at the level of the coronaviruses S-protein of interaction with ACE2 receptor. Preclinical studies in vitro and on animals show umifenovir activity against a number of coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and others. Umifenovir, in combination with other antiviral drugs, symptomatic or traditional medicine, was used in China to treat patients with COVID-19, resulting in reduced mortality, virus elimination, the frequency of more severe course and complications in middle severity. However, antiviral therapy for the treatment of severe patients, with ARDS, did not lead to improved outcomes. In comparative clinical studies, umifenovir showed similar effectiveness with other antiviral drugs, and lower frequency of adverse reactions. Therapy with umifenovir, led to an increase percentage of patients with negative results of PCR tests on days 714 (I2=69.8%, RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.190.76; p=0.001). The efficacy and safety of antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 still requires clinical investigation. Moderate forms of COVID-19 could be effectively treated by antivirals, but severe forms of COVID-19, characterized by pulmonary immunopathology, require different approaches to treatment.","Leneva, I A; Pshenichnaya, N Y; Bulgakova, V A",Ter Arkh,,387

455206,Advanced Practice Telenursing Through a Pandemic,2020,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Cerebral infarction in COVID-19 patients might be associated with a hypercoagulable state related to a systemic inflammatory response. Its diagnosis might be challenging. We present two critically ill patients with COVID-19 who presented acutely altered mental status as the main manifestation of multiple strokes. METHODS: Clinical presentation and diagnostic work-up of the patients. RESULTS: Two patients in their sixties were hospitalized with a bilateral pneumonia COVID-19. They developed respiratory failure and were admitted to ICU for mechanical ventilation and intense medical treatment. They were started on low-molecular-weight heparin since admission. Their laboratory results showed lymphopenia and increased levels of C-reactive protein and D-dimer. Case 1 developed hypofibrinogenemia and presented several cutaneous lesions with biopsy features of thrombotic vasculopathy. Case 2 was performed a CT pulmonary angiogram at ICU showing a bilateral pulmonary embolism. When waking up, both patients were conscious but with a remarkable global altered mental status without focal neurological deficits. A brain MRI revealed multiple acute bilateral ischemic lesions with areas of hemorrhagic transformation in both patients (case 1: affecting the left frontal and temporal lobes and both occipital lobes; case 2: affecting both frontal and left occipital lobes). Cardioembolic source and acquired antiphospholipid syndrome were ruled out. COVID-19-associated coagulopathy was suspected as the possible main etiology of the strokes. CONCLUSION: Acutely altered mental status might be the main manifestation of multiple brain infarctions in critically ill COVID-19 patients. It should be specially considered in those with suspected COVID-19-associated coagulopathy. Full-dose anticoagulation and clinical-radiological monitoring might reduce their neurological consequences.","Díaz-Pérez, Carolina; Ramos, Carmen; López-Cruz, Alberto; Muñoz Olmedo, José; Lázaro González, Jimena; De Vega-Ríos, Enrique; González-Ávila, Carmen; Hervás, Carlos; Trillo, Santiago; Vivancos, José",Neurol Sci,,387

This study aims to describe a series of children admitted to a PICU due to coronavirus disease 2019 infection. DESIGN: Prospective observational study. SETTING: Tertiary hospital in Madrid, Spain. PATIENTS: Children admitted to the PICU with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) infection, from March 1, 2020, to April 15, 2020. INTERVENTIONS: Observational study. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Epidemiologic data, previous clinical characteristics, support therapy needed, imaging tests, laboratory observations on admission, and pharmacologic therapy. Eleven children were admitted to the PICU, with suspected coronavirus disease 2019; the polymerase chain reaction test was positive in seven. The median age was 100.7 months (range, 0.5-162). Five were admitted from the emergency department and two from the ward. The Pediatric Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score was 3 (range, 0-9), and Pediatric Risk of Mortality II score was 4 (range, 0-16). All children were previously healthy except one (allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation). Respiratory symptoms and fever were prevalent. A chest radiograph led to a pneumonia diagnosis. Not all patients presented with lymphopenia on admission. D-Dimer and ferritin were elevated. All patients needed oxygen therapy through a nasal cannula; five patients received high-flow nasal cannula therapy, which was later substituted with noninvasive ventilation in four. Mechanical ventilation was necessary in two patients on the first day of PICU admission. Two children required mechanical ventilation and inotropic support. Tocilizumab was applied in two intubated children. Also, four children received heparin. No patients died. CONCLUSIONS: On the whole, the children were previously healthy and are more than 1 year old. Respiratory symptoms were the leading cause of PICU admission, making respiratory support the principal therapy. Patients requiring mechanical ventilation showed deterioration on the first day of admission. These children seemed to require close monitoring, and multicenter studies are necessary.","García-Salido, Alberto; Leoz-Gordillo, Inés; Martínez de Azagra-Garde, Amelia; Nieto-Moro, Montserrat; Iglesias-Bouzas, María Isabel; García-Teresa, María Ángeles; Cabrero-Hernández, Marta; De Lama Caro-Patón, Gema; Gochi Valdovinos, Ainhoa; González-Brabin, Anthony; Serrano-González, Ana",Pediatr Crit Care Med,,387

Handling infectious virus requires Biosafety Level (BSL)-3 facilities. OBJECTIVE: To compare the recovery and detection of infectious and heat-inactivated (65 °C for 30 min) SARS-CoV-2 from stainless steel by the modified US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 2019-Novel Coronavirus Real Time Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) Diagnostic Panel. METHODS: Viral stocks were diluted in viral transport medium and deposited onto stainless steel test areas at 2 x 103 and 2 x 104 genomic copies for low and high, respectively. Test areas were sampled, and aliquots of the resulting test solutions analyzed by RT-qPCR according to the CDC method. Results were analyzed by Probability of Detection (POD) statistics. RESULTS: The low level, where fractional positive results (25-75%) are expected, yielded PODI = 0.80 (0.58, 0.92) for the infectious virus and PODHI = 0.15 (0.05, 0.36) for the heat-inactivated virus. The bias, dPODHI = -0.65 (-0.80, -0.35), demonstrated a statistical difference between infectious and heat-inactivated virus detection. No difference was observed at the high inoculation level. CONCLUSION: Despite the statistical difference observed, the use of the heat-inactivated virus is a viable alternative for matrix extension studies using a method comparison study design. HIGHLIGHTS: The use of heat-inactivated SARS-CoV-2 can mitigate the need for a BSL-3 facility for matrix extension validation of alternative methods in SARS-CoV-2 studies.","Brunelle, Sharon L; Bird, Patrick M; Boone, Jeremy; Nelson, Maria; Johnson, Zerlinde; Coates, Scott",J.

However, the variability of outcomes and the omission of patient-centered outcomes may diminish the impact of these trials on decision-making. The aim of this study was to generate a consensus-based, prioritized list of outcomes for coronavirus disease 2019 trials. DESIGN: In an online survey conducted in English, Chinese, Italian, Portuguese, and Spanish languages, adults with coronavirus disease 2019, their family members, health professionals, and the general public rated the importance of outcomes using a 9-point Likert scale (7-9, critical importance) and completed a Best-Worst Scale to estimate relative importance. Participant comments were analyzed thematically. SETTING: International. SUBJECTS: Adults 18 years old and over with confirmed or suspected coronavirus disease 2019, their family members, members of the general public, and health professionals (including clinicians, policy makers, regulators, funders, and researchers). INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS: None. MAIN RESULTS: In total, 9,289 participants from 111 countries (776 people with coronavirus disease 2019 or family members, 4,882 health professionals, and 3,631 members of the public) completed the survey. The four outcomes of highest priority for all three groups were: mortality, respiratory failure, pneumonia, and organ failure. Lung function, lung scarring, sepsis, shortness of breath, and oxygen level in the blood were common to the top 10 outcomes across all three groups (mean > 7.5, median &#8805; 8, and > 70% of respondents rated the outcome as critically important). Patients/family members rated fatigue, anxiety, chest pain, muscle pain, gastrointestinal problems, and cardiovascular disease higher than health professionals. Four themes underpinned prioritization: fear of life-threatening, debilitating, and permanent consequences; addressing knowledge gaps; enabling preparedness and planning; and tolerable or infrequent outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Life-threatening respiratory and other organ outcomes were consistently highly prioritized by all stakeholder groups. Patients/family members gave higher priority to many patient-reported outcomes compared with health professionals.","Evangelidis, Nicole; Tong, Allison; Howell, Martin; Teixeira-Pinto, Armando; Elliott, Julian H; Azevedo, Luciano Cesar; Bersten, Andrew; Cervantes, Lilia; Chew, Derek P; Crowe, Sally; Douglas, Ivor S; Flemyng, Ella; Horby, Peter; Lee, Jaehee; Lorca, Eduardo; Lynch, Deena; Marshall, John C; McKenzie, Anne; Mehta, Sangeeta; Mer, Mervyn; Morris, Andrew Conway; Nseir, Saad; Povoa, Pedro; Reid, Mark; Sakr, Yasser; Shen, Ning; Smyth, Alan R; Snelling, Tom; Strippoli, Giovanni F M; Torres, Antoni; Turner, Tari; Webb, Steve; Williamson, Paula R; Woc-Colburn, Laila; Zhang, Junhua; Baumgart, Amanda; Cabrera, Sebastian; Cho, Yeoungjee; Cooper, Tess; Guha, Chandana; Liu, Emma; Gonzalez, Andrea Matus; McLeod, Charlie; Natale, Patrizia; Saglimbene, Valeria; Viecelli, Andrea K; Craig, Jonathan C",Crit Care Med,,387

After recovery, hamsters were re-exposed to hCoV-19/South African/KRISP-K005325/2020 (VOC B.1.351) via an intranasal challenge. Seroconverted rechallenged animals did not lose weight and shed virus for three days. They had a little infectious virus and no pathology in the lungs. In contrast, shedding, weight loss and extensive pulmonary pathology caused by B.1.351 replication were observed in the non-seroconverted animals. The rechallenged seroconverted animals did not transmit the virus to naïve sentinels via direct contact transmission, in contrast to the non-seroconverted animals. Reinfection with B.1.351 triggered an anamnestic response that boosted not only neutralizing titres against lineage A, but also titres against B.1.351. Our results confirm that aerosol exposure is a more efficient infection route than fomite exposure. Furthermore, initial infection with SARS-CoV-2 lineage A does not prevent heterologous reinfection with B.1.351 but prevents disease and onward transmission. These data suggest that previous SARS-CoV-2 exposure induces partial protective immunity. The reinfection generated a broadly neutralizing humoral response capable of effectively neutralizing B.1.351 while maintaining its ability to neutralize the virus to which the initial response was directed against.","Yinda, Claude Kwe; Port, Julia R; Bushmaker, Trenton; Fischer, Robert J; Schulz, Jonathan E; Holbrook, Myndi G; Shaia, Carl; de Wit, Emmie; van Doremalen, Neeltje; Munster, Vincent J",Emerg Microbes Infect,,387

Dermatologic adverse effects appeared during clinical trials and have also been described in the population since approval. Just as descriptions and categorization of skin manifestations of the coronavirus disease 2019 proved important for understanding the disease itself, characterizing the effects of vaccines may also further that goal. This paper reviews the properties of the different types of vaccines currently available and under development and describes how they interact with the immune system and the clinical signs they may cause. We focus on dermatologic adverse effects reported to date and recommendations for managing them.","Galván-Casas, Cristina; Català, Alba; Muñoz-Santos, Carlos",Actas dermo-sifiliogr. (Ed. impr.),,387
464726,Global mental health and novel coronavirus: The risk of the 'same' risks,2020,"OBJECTIVE: As a result of the coronavirus-19 disease (COVID-19) pandemic, Australia adopted emergency measures on 22 March 2020. This study reports the effect of the COVID-19 lockdown on appetite and overeating in Australian adults during the first month of emergency measures. DESIGN: This study reports analysis of data from the population-based, self-completed survey. The main outcome measure was an item from the Patient Health Questionnaire 9 asking: 'Over the past 2 weeks, how often have you been bothered by poor appetite or overeating?'. Data on sociodemographic factors, symptoms of anxiety and depression, and the impact of COVID-19 and lockdown were also collected. Multivariable logistic regression was used to examine associations with poor appetite or overeating. SETTING: An anonymous online survey available from 3 April to 2 May 2020. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 13 829 Australian residents aged 18 years or over. RESULTS: The weighted prevalence of being bothered by poor appetite or overeating in the past 2 weeks was 53·6 %, with 11·6 % (95 % CI 10·6, 12·6) of the cohort reporting poor appetite or overeating nearly every day. High levels of anxiety, concern about contracting COVID-19, being in lockdown with children and reporting a severe impact of the lockdown were associated with increased odds of poor appetite or overeating. CONCLUSIONS: Given the widespread prevalence of being bothered by poor appetite or overeating, universal public health interventions to address emotion-focused or situational eating during periods of lockdown may be appropriate.","Owen, A J; Tran, T; Hammarberg, K; Kirkman, M; Fisher, Jrw",Public Health Nutr,,387

465498,COVID-19 and mental health through the eyes of Indian newspapers,2020,"Diabetes, like COVID-19, is a wicked problem The concept of a wicked problem arose in the 1960's, based on the realization that purely scientific solutions to societal problems are doomed to fail Wicked problems are impossible to solve because of contradictory and changing requirements, the absence of equality, and ever-evolving social complexities Poverty, crime, and climate change are wicked problems COVID-19 is also a classic wicked problem, as evidenced by the unanticipated and disproportionate effect of the virus on minority racial and ethnic populations and individuals who have experienced health disparities A wicked problem persists in perpetuity because of incomplete information, multiple (often selfish) stakeholder interests, a large economic burden, and a ripple effect whereby every action triggers a reaction with other wicked problems For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the exclusion of undocumented residents from the funding given to US taxpayers by the federal government reduced their purchasing power amid a looming recession, contributing further to both the public health and economic crises in US states such as California There is a need to create a digital diabetes ecosystem that is equitable A digital diabetes ecosystem that can help to resolve diabetes as a wicked problem ideally should connect personal consumer (e g , food choices), physiological (e g , sleep patterns), behavioral (e g , physical activity), psychological (e g , mood), environmental (e g , air quality), and genetic data with an understanding of social preferences (e g , family meals vs eating alone) 9 This ecosystem should both be integrated with clinician workloads and have empathy with the user Creating an ecosystem will be an obstinate task, given that personal goals vary among individuals, and shift with time owing to the ripple effect of other wicked problems Finding the problem centre (i e , a modifiable driver of the problem), and choosing the type and timing of an intervention, can be challenging Technologies should be adaptive, adaptable, and affordable, both in terms of financial cost and personal burden for the user Primary care physicians already understand that diabetes is a wicked problem, and that data and algorithms alone are insufficient For scientists and engineers, illness affects the human condition in ways that can be frustratingly illogical and unpredictable Machines can be created to provide sincerity, but without compassion and empathy, their value for providing human-like interactions is markedly low Good clinicians are skilled at locating problems by finding where in a causal network the trouble truly lies and deciding what actions will actually work, thereby narrowing the gap between what is and what ought to be-the essence of addressing a wicked problem That is also the challenge, and opportunity, for the diabetes community","Kerr, D.; Glantz, N.",Lancet Diabetes and Endocrinology,,387
465672,Exploring Factors Associated with Alcohol and/or Substance Use During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic significantly reduced elective surgery in the United States, but the impact of COVID-19 on acute surgical complaints and acute care surgery is unknown. STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective review was performed of all surgical consults at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania in the 30 days prior to and 30 days following confirmation of the first COVID-19 patient at the institution. Consults to all divisions within general surgery were included. RESULTS: Total surgical consult volume decreased by 43% in the post-COVID-19 period, with a significant reduction in the median daily consult volume from 14 to 8 (P < .0001). Changes in consult volume by patient location, chief complaint, and surgical division were variable, in aggregate reflecting a disproportionate decrease among less acute surgical complaints. The percentage of consults resulting in surgical intervention remained equal in the 2 periods (31% vs 28%, odds ratio 0.85, 95% CI 0.61-1.21, P = .38) with most but not all operation types decreasing in frequency. The rise in the COVID-19 inpatient census led to increased consultation for vascular access, accommodated at our center by the creation of a new surgical procedures team. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic significantly altered the landscape of acute surgical complaints at our large academic hospital. An appreciation of these trends may be helpful to other Departments of Surgery around the country as they deploy staff and allocate resources in the COVID-19 era.","Riley, John S; Luks, Valerie L; de Pina, Luis Filipe; Al Adas, Ziad; Stoecker, Jordan B; Jackson, Benjamin M; Braslow, Benjamin M; Holena, Daniel N",Am Surg,,387
466983,"Rural hospitals prepare for, respond to COVID-19",2020,"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has become a public health emergency affecting frail populations, including patients with cancer. This poses the question of whether cancer treatments can be postponed or modified without compromising their efficacy, especially for highly curable cancers such as germ cell tumors (GCTs). MATERIALS AND METHODS: To depict the state-of-the-art management of GCTs during the COVID-19 pandemic, a survey including 26 questions was circulated by e-mail among the physicians belonging to three cooperative groups: (a) Italian Germ Cell Cancer Group; (b) European Reference Network-Rare Adult Solid Cancers, Domain G3 (rare male genitourinary cancers); and (c) Genitourinary Medical Oncologists of Canada. Percentages of agreement between Italian respondents (I) versus Canadian respondents (C), I versus European respondents (E), and E versus C were compared by using Fisher's exact tests for dichotomous answers and chi square test for trends for the questions with three or more options. RESULTS: Fifty-three GCT experts responded to the survey: 20 Italian, 6 in other European countries, and 27 from Canada. Telemedicine was broadly used; there was high consensus to interrupt chemotherapy in COVID-19-positive patients (I = 75%, C = 55%, and E = 83.3%) and for use of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor primary prophylaxis for neutropenia (I = 65%, C = 62.9%, and E = 50%). The main differences emerged regarding the management of stage I and stage IIA disease, likely because of cultural and geographical differences. CONCLUSION: Our study highlights the common efforts of GCT experts in Europe and Canada to maintain high standards of treatment for patients with GCT with few changes in their management during the COVID-19 pandemic. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Despite the chaos, disruptions, and fears fomented by the COVID-19 illness, oncology care teams in Italy, other European countries, and Canada are delivering the enormous promise of curative management strategies for patients with testicular cancer and other germ cell tumors. At the same time, these teams are applying safe and innovative solutions and sharing best practices to minimize frequency and intensity of patient contacts with thinly stretched health care capacity.","Nappi, Lucia; Ottaviano, Margaret; Rescigno, Pasquale; Tortora, Marianna; Banna, Giuseppe L; Baciarello, Giulia; Basso, Umberto; Canil, Christina; Cavo, Alessia; Cossu Rocca, Maria; Czaykowski, Piotr; De Giorgi, Ugo; Garcia Del Muro, Xavier; Di Napoli, Marilena; Fornarini, Giuseppe; Gietema, Jourik A; Heng, Daniel Y C; Hotte, Sebastien J; Kollmannsberger, Christian; Maruzzo, Marco; Messina, Carlo; Morelli, Franco; Mulder, Sasja; Nichols, Craig; Nolè, Franco; Oing, Christoph; Sava, Teodoro; Secondino, Simona; Simone, Giuseppe; Soulieres, Denis; Vincenzi, Bruno; Zucali, Paolo A; De Placido, Sabino; Palmieri, Giovannella",Oncologist,,387

468412,Primary healthcare clinicians,2021,"The spike protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has become the main target for antiviral and vaccine development. Despite its relevance, e information is scarse about its evolutionary traces. The aim of this study was to investigate the diversification patterns of the spike for each clade of SARS-CoV-2 through different approaches. Two thousand and one hundred sequences representing the seven clades of the SARS-CoV-2 were included. Patterns of genetic diversifications and nucleotide evolutionary rate were estimated for the spike genomic region. The haplotype networks showed a star shape, where multiple haplotypes with few nucleotide differences diverge from a common ancestor. Four hundred seventy-nine different haplotypes were defined in the seven analyzed clades. The main haplotype, named Hap-1, was the most frequent for clades G (54%), GH (54%), and GR (56%) and a different haplotype (named Hap-252) was the most important for clades L (63.3%), O (39.7%), S (51.7%), and V (70%). The evolutionary rate for the spike protein was estimated as 1.08 × 10-3 nucleotide substitutions/site/year. Moreover, the nucleotide evolutionary rate after nine months of the pandemic was similar for each clade. In conclusion, the present evolutionary analysis is relevant as the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 is the target for most therapeutic candidates; besides, changes in this protein could have consequences on viral transmission, response to antivirals and efficacy of vaccines. Moreover, the evolutionary characterization of clades improves knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 and deserves to be assessed in more detail as re-infection by different phylogenetic clades has been reported.","Pereson, Matías J; Flichman, Diego M; Martínez, Alfredo P; Baré, Patricia; Garcia, Gabriel H; Di Lello, Federico A",J Med Virol,,387
469246,"National action plan to address MH, suicide amid pandemic",2020,"Extreme events such as drought and heatwaves are among the biggest challenges to agricultural production and food security. However, effects of cropping systems on drought resistance of arable crops via their hydraulic behaviour remain unclear. We investigated how hydraulic traits of a field-grown pea-barley (Pisum sativum L. and Hordeum vulgare L.) mixture were affected by different cropping systems, that is, organic and conventional farming with intensive or conservation tillage. Xylem vulnerability to cavitation of both species was estimated by measuring the pressure inducing 50% loss of hydraulic conductivity (P50 ), while the water stress plants experienced in the field was assessed using native percentage loss of hydraulic conductivity (nPLC). Pea and barley showed contrasting hydraulic behaviours: pea was less vulnerable to xylem cavitation and less stressed than barley; cropping systems affected xylem vulnerability of barley, but not of pea. Barley grown under conventional farming with no tillage was more vulnerable and stressed than under organic farming with intensive tillage. nPLC proved to be a valuable indicator for plant water stress. Our results highlight the impact of cropping systems on crop xylem vulnerability and drought resistance, thus plant hydraulic traits, for protecting food security under future climate.

Although RT-PCR is the most reliable technique to detect ongoing infections, serological tests are frequently proposed as tools in heterogeneous screening strategies. OBJECTIVES: to analyse the performance of a screening strategy proposed by the local government of Tuscany (Central Italy), which first uses qualitative rapid tests for antibody detection, and then RT-PCR tests on the positive subjects. METHODS: a simulation study is conducted to investigate the number of RT-PCR tests required by the screening strategy and the undetected ongoing infections in a pseudo-population of 500,000 subjects, under different prevalence scenarios and assuming a sensitivity of the serological test ranging from 0.50 to 0.80 (specificity 0.98). A compartmental model is used to predict the number of new infections generated by the false negatives two months after the screening, under different values of the infection reproduction number. RESULTS: assuming a sensitivity equal to 0.80 and a prevalence of 0.3%, the screening procedure would require on average 11,167 RT-PCR tests and would produce 300 false negatives, responsible after two months of a number of contagions ranging from 526 to 1,132, under the optimistic scenario of a reproduction number between 0.5 to 1.

It is important to know how much cross-protection is offered between strains following vaccination or infection. Here, we obtain serum and saliva samples from groups of vaccinated (Pfizer BNT-162b2), infected and uninfected individuals and characterize the antibody response to RBD mutant strains. Vaccinated individuals have a robust humoral response after the second dose and have high IgG antibody titers in the saliva. Antibody responses however show considerable differences in binding to RBD mutants of emerging variants of concern and substantial reduction in RBD binding and neutralization is observed against a patient-isolated South African variant. Taken together our data reinforce the importance of the second dose of Pfizer BNT-162b2 to acquire high levels of neutralizing antibodies and high antibody titers in saliva suggest that vaccinated individuals may have reduced transmission potential. Substantially reduced neutralization for the South African variant further highlights the importance of surveillance strategies to detect new variants and targeting these in future vaccines.","Becker, Matthias; Dulovic, Alex; Junker, Daniel; Ruetalo, Natalia; Kaiser, Philipp D; Pinilla, Yudi T; Heinzel, Constanze; Haering, Julia; Traenkle, Bjoern; Wagner, Teresa R; Layer, Mirjam; Mehrlaender, Martin; Mirakaj, Valbona; Held, Jana; Planatscher, Hannes; Schenke-Layland, Katja; Krause, Gérard; Strengert, Monika; Bakchoul, Tamam; Althaus, Karina; Fendel, Rolf; Kreidenweiss, Andrea; Koeppen, Michael; Rothbauer, Ulrich; Schindler, Michael; Schneiderhan-Marra, Nicole",Nat Commun,,387

We aimed to assess the changes in maternity healthcare provision and healthcare-seeking by pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies of the effects of the pandemic on provision of, access to and attendance at maternity services (CRD42020211753). We searched MEDLINE and Embase in accordance with PRISMA guidelines from January 1st, 2020 to April 17th 2021 for controlled observational studies and research letters reporting primary data comparing maternity healthcare-seeking and healthcare delivery during compared to before the COVID-19 pandemic. Case reports and series, systematic literature reviews, and pre-print studies were excluded. Meta-analysis was performed on comparable outcomes that were reported in two or more studies.

488801,Shaping resilience: how work team characteristics affect occupational commitment in health care interns during a pandemic,2020,"Mast cells (MCs) are secretory cells that are central players in human allergic disease and immune responses. With the exception of a few pathological situations, MCs are usually present at relatively low frequencies in most tissues. Since their first description, MCs in tissues were identified mostly using their morphological characteristics and their typical coloration when stained with aniline dyes. However, increasing availability of highly specific antibodies now permits the use of fluorescence-based flow cytometry as the method of choice for the quantification, characterization, and purification of cells in suspension. This technique allows for a rapid analysis of thousands of events and for the identification of cells present at frequencies as low as one event in 106 unwanted cells. This method also permits for simultaneous characterization of multiple antigens at a single cell level, which is ideal in order to study rare populations of cells like MCs. Here we describe the basis of flow cytometry-based immunophenotyping applied to the study of MC. The protocol focuses on the study of human MCs present in body fluids (mainly bone marrow) but can easily be adapted to studying MCs from other tissues and species.","Morgado, José Mário; Sánchez-Muñoz, Laura; Teodósio, Cristina; Mora, Luis María Escribano",Methods Mol Biol,,387

We measured two facets of depressive rumination, brooding and reflection, along with rumination about the current COVID-19 situation to see whether these different subtypes of rumination explained perceived stress among migraineurs and healthy controls. METHODS: Healthy adults (n = 64) and migraine patients (n = 73) filled out self-report questionnaires online. A multiple linear regression model was used to test whether depressive rumination (i.e. brooding and reflection) and COVID-related rumination explained perceived stress among adults with and without migraine during the times of COVID-19, after controlling for gender, age, migraine/control group status and migraine disability. RESULTS: Although we did not find any difference in the level of perceived stress among migraineurs and the control group, perceived stress was more strongly associated with brooding as well as COVID-related rumination among migraineurs than healthy controls. COVID-related rumination and brooding (but not reflection) explained the level of perceived stress after controlling for gender, age, migraine/control group status and migraine disability. CONCLUSIONS: The similar degree of perceived stress among migraineurs and the control group may imply that there is great variation in the personal experience of people regarding the pandemic, that may be determined by numerous other factors. Our results demonstrate that ruminating about the pandemic and related difficulties, as well as brooding (but not reflection) appear to be associated with higher level of perceived stress during the times of the coronavirus. This association was slightly stronger among migraineurs, hinting at the increased vulnerability of this patient group in stressful situations like the COVID-19 pandemic. Our results also suggest that ruminating about the pandemic and its consequences is weakly associated with trait-level depressive rumination, thus may be more contingent on specific factors.","Kovács, Lilla Nóra; Baksa, Dániel; Dobos, Dóra; Eszlári, Nóra; Gecse, Kinga; Kocsel, Natália; Juhász, Gabriella; Kökönyei, Gyöngyi",BMC Psychol,,387
489857,Associations of Medications With Lower Odds of Typical COVID-19 Symptoms: Cross-Sectional Symptom Surveillance Study,2020,"Exposure to ambient air pollution is a well-established determinant of health and disease. The Lancet Commission on pollution and health concludes that air pollution is the leading environmental cause of global disease and premature death. Indeed, there is a growing body of evidence that links air pollution not only to adverse cardiorespiratory effects but also to increased risk of cerebrovascular and neuropsychiatric disorders. Despite being a relatively new area of investigation, overall, there is mounting recent evidence showing that exposure to multiple air pollutants, in particular to fine particles, may affect the central nervous system (CNS) and brain health, thereby contributing to increased risk of stroke, dementia, Parkinson's disease, cognitive dysfunction, neurodevelopmental disorders, depression and other related conditions. The underlying molecular mechanisms of susceptibility and disease remain largely elusive. However, emerging evidence suggests inflammation and oxidative stress to be crucial factors in the pathogenesis of air pollution-induced disorders, driven by the enhanced production of proinflammatory mediators and reactive oxygen species in response to exposure to various air pollutants. From a public health perspective, mitigation measures are urgent to reduce the burden of disease and premature mortality from ambient air pollution.","Hahad, Omar; Lelieveld, Jos; Birklein, Frank; Lieb, Klaus; Daiber, Andreas; Münzel, Thomas",,,387

However, little is known about the effects of COVID-19 on patients with neurological disorders. We conducted a systematic review to evaluate the severity of COVID-19 and its effect on neurological symptoms in patients with preexisting neurological disorder and COVID-19. METHODS: We searched the MEDLINE (PubMed) and medRxiv databases for reports of patients with both preexisting neurological disorders and COVID-19. Studies reporting data on changes in the symptoms of preexisting neurological disorders and/or the severity of COVID-19 were included. RESULTS: Twenty-six articles with 2278 patients with preexisting neurological disorder and COVID-19 were identified. Of 232 patients, 74 (31.9 %) showed exacerbation of preexisting neurological symptoms of dementia (55/92; 59.5 %), Parkinson's disease (10/17; 58.8 %), epilepsy (1/1; 100 %), and unspecified neurological disorders (8/106; 7.5 %). Of 2168 patients, 478 (22.0 %) showed severe COVID-19 course. These included patients with cerebrovascular disease (86/445; 19.3 %), dementia (70/316; 22.2 %), Parkinson's disease (25/214; 11.7 %), multiple sclerosis (28/71; 39.4 %), spinal cord injury (5/7; 71.4 %), epilepsy (10/98; 10.2 %) and unspecified neurological disorders (254/1011; 25 %). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with preexisting neurological disorders and COVID-19 may develop exacerbation of neurological symptoms and severe COVID-19. Clinicians should be aware of the risk of symptom exacerbation and severe COVID-19 in patients with preexisting neurological disease and should focus on the prevention and early care of COVID-19.","Kubota, Takafumi; Kuroda, Naoto",Clin Neurol Neurosurg,,387

According to studies, traditional medicine interventions along with conventional medicine protocols have been reported to be effective in prevention and treatment. The aim of this study was to summarize the recommendations of Persian medicine based on evidence in the prevention and treatment of symptoms of acute respiratory syndrome. METHODS: In this review article, keywords related to the symptoms of COVID-19 in Persian medicine sources, review and items related to the prevention and treatment of acute respiratory syndrome were extracted. Individual items with the keywords ""Influenza"" or ""SARS"" or ""MERS"" or ""COVID-19"" or ""Coronavirus"" or ""Antiviral"" or ""Anti-inflammatory"" or ""Immune system"" or ""Antioxidant"" were searched in the databases SID, Pubmed, Scopus, Cochrane, Web of science, Science direct, and Google scholar, and finally those with scientific evidence were presented in the form of auxiliary instructions for prevention and treatment. FINDINGS: A significant part of the recommendations of Persian medicine to prevent or control the symptoms of acute respiratory syndrome has practical clinical evidence. These include social distance, avoiding heavy meals, and using herbal remedies according to the specific conditions of the patients. CONCLUSION: According to the results of this study, the use of simple strategies of Persian medicine in preventing and improving the symptoms of acute respiratory syndrome caused by COVID-19 along with common medicine protocols, can help control the epidemic conditions. Also, many of these recommendations can be evaluated as useful research ideas in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19.","Azimi, M.; Hasheminasab, F.

We identified an unexpected antagonistic effect of FGFs on the interferon (IFN) signaling pathway. Genetic or pharmacological inhibition of FGF receptor signaling in keratinocytes promoted the expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISG) and proteins in vitro and in vivo. Conversely, FGF7 or FGF10 treatment of keratinocytes suppressed ISG expression under homeostatic conditions and in response to IFN or poly(I:C) treatment. FGF-mediated ISG suppression was independent of IFN receptors, occurred at the transcriptional level, and required FGF receptor kinase and proteasomal activity. It is not restricted to keratinocytes and functionally relevant, since FGFs promoted the replication of herpes simplex virus I (HSV-1), lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, and Zika virus. Most importantly, inhibition of FGFR signaling blocked HSV-1 replication in cultured human keratinocytes and in mice. These results suggest the use of FGFR kinase inhibitors for the treatment of viral infections.","Maddaluno, Luigi; Urwyler, Corinne; Rauschendorfer, Theresa; Meyer, Michael; Stefanova, Debora; Spörri, Roman; Wietecha, Mateusz; Ferrarese, Luca; Stoycheva, Diana; Bender, Daniela; Li, Nick; Strittmatter, Gerhard; Nasirujjaman, Khondokar; Beer, Hans-Dietmar; Staeheli, Peter; Hildt, Eberhard; Oxenius, Annette; Werner, Sabine",EMBO Mol Med,,387

METHODS: This case-control study compared brachial-ankle pulse wave (baPWV) and carotid-femoral pulse wave velocities (cfPWV) of acutely ill patients with and without COVID-19. RESULTS: Twenty-two COVID-19 patients (50% females, 77 [67-84] years) were compared with 22 age- and sex-matched controls. In COVID-19 patients, baPWV (19.9 [18.4-21.0] vs. 16.0 [14.2-20.4], P = 0.02) and cfPWV (14.3 [13.4-16.0] vs. 11.0 [9.5-14.6], P = 0.01) were higher than in the controls.

Assays demonstrated a range of sensitivities (96%-63%), specificities (99%-96%) and precision (IIC 0.55-0.99). Durability of antibody detection in longitudinal samples was dependent on assay format and immunoglobulin target, with anti-spike, direct, or total Ig assays demonstrating more stable, or increasing reactivity over time than anti-nucleocapsid, indirect, or IgG assays. Assays with high sensitivity, specificity and durable antibody detection are ideal for serosurveillance. Less sensitive assays demonstrating waning reactivity are appropriate for other applications, including characterizing antibody responses after infection and vaccination, and detection of anamnestic boosting by reinfections and vaccine breakthrough infections.

The total dataset covers the span of five months, from 1 December 2019, to 10 May 2020, which comprises of four phases, i.e., the pre lockdown phase (1 December 2019, to 23 January 2020), Phase-1 lockdown (24 January 2020, to 26 February 2020), Phase-2 lockdown (27 February 2020, to 31 March 2020), and post lockdown (1 April 2020, to 10 May 2020). The observed results clearly showed that the concentrations of selected pollutants were lower along with improved air quality during the lockdown periods (Phase-1 and Phase-2) with only the exception of O3, which showed an increasing trend during lockdown. The study concluded that limited anthropogenic activities during the spring festival and lockdown phases improved air quality with a significant reduction of selected trace gases, i.e., NO2 59%, HCHO 38%, and SO2 33%. We also compared our results with 2019 data for available gases. Our results imply that the air pollutants concentration reduction in 2019 during Phase-2 was insignificant, which was due to the business as usual conditions after the Spring Festival (Phase-1) in 2019. In contrast, a significant contamination reduction was observed during Phase-2 in 2020 with the enforcement of a Level-II response in lockdown conditions i.e., the easing of the lockdown situation in some sectors during a specific interval of time. The observed ratio of HCHO to NO2 showed that tropospheric ozone production involved Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) limited scenarios.","Javed, Zeeshan Wang YuHang Xie MingJie Tanvir Aimon Rehman Abdul Ji XiangGuang Xing ChengZhi Shakoor A.; Liu, Cheng",Remote Sensing,,387

501909,Disaster psychiatry and homelessness: Creating a mental health COVID-19 response,2020,"While the whole world is still struggling with the COVID-19 pandemic, online learning and home office become more common. Many schools transfer their courses teaching to the online classroom. Therefore, it is significant to mine the students' feedback and opinions from their reviews towards studies so that both schools and teachers can know where they need to improve. This paper trains machine learning and deep learning models using both balanced and imbalanced datasets for sentiment classification. Two SOTA category-aware text generation GAN models: CatGAN and SentiGAN, are utilized to synthesize text used to balance the highly imbalanced dataset. Results on three datasets with different imbalance degree from distinct domains show that when using generated text to balance the dataset, the F1-score of machine learning and deep learning model on sentiment classification increases 2.79% ~ 9.28%. Also, the results indicate that the average growth degree for CR100k is higher than CR23k, the average growth degree for deep learning is more increased than machine learning algorithms, and the average growth degree for more complex deep learning models is more increased than simpler deep learning models in experiments.","Yang, Ru; Edalati, Maryam",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.12061v1.pdf,387
501935,COVID-19 and Mental Health: Should We Expect an Increase in Disability?,2021,"Bats are natural reservoirs for both Alpha- and Betacoronaviruses and the hypothesized original hosts of five of seven known zoonotic coronaviruses. To date, the vast majority of bat coronavirus research has been concentrated in Asia, though coronaviruses are globally distributed; indeed, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2-related Betacoronaviruses in the subgenus Sarbecovirus have been identified circulating in Rhinolophid bats in both Africa and Europe, despite the relative dearth of surveillance in these regions. As part of a long-term study examining the dynamics of potentially zoonotic viruses in three species of endemic Madagascar fruit bat (Pteropus rufus, Eidolon dupreanum, Rousettus madagascariensis), we carried out metagenomic Next Generation Sequencing (mNGS) on urine, throat, and fecal samples obtained from wild-caught individuals. We report detection of RNA derived from Betacoronavirus subgenus Nobecovirus in fecal samples from all three species and describe full genome sequences of novel Nobecoviruses in P. rufus and R. madagascariensis. Phylogenetic analysis indicates the existence of five distinct Nobecovirus clades, one of which is defined by the highly divergent sequence reported here from P. rufus bats. Madagascar Nobecoviruses derived from P. rufus and R. madagascariensis demonstrate, respectively, Asian and African phylogeographic origins, mirroring those of their fruit bat hosts. Bootscan recombination analysis indicates significant selection has taken place in the spike, nucleocapsid, and NS7 accessory protein regions of the genome for viruses derived from both bat hosts. Madagascar offers a unique phylogeographic nexus of bats and viruses with both Asian and African phylogeographic origins, providing opportunities for unprecedented mixing of viral groups and, potentially, recombination. As fruit bats are handled and consumed widely across Madagascar for subsistence, understanding the landscape of potentially zoonotic coronavirus circulation is essential for mitigation of future zoonotic threats.","Kettenburg, Gwenddolen; Kistler, Amy L; Ranaivoson, Hafaliana Christian; Andry, Santino; DeRisi, Joseph L; Gentles, Anecia; Raharinosy, Vololoniaina; Randriambolamanantsoa, Tsiry Hasina; Ravelomanantsoa, Ny Anjara Fifi; Tato, Cristina M; Dussart, Philippe; Heraud, Jean-Michel; Brook, Cara E",,,387

METHODS: A multidisciplinary working group was formed consisting of representatives for orthopedics, epidemiology, ethics, infectious diseases, cardiovascular diseases, and intensive care medicine. Preparation for upcoming meetings consisted of reading up on literature and testing of proposed methodologies on our own waiting lists. RESULTS: A workflow based on 3 domains, that is, required resources, patient fitness, and time sensitivity of the procedure, was considered most useful. All domains function as standalones, in a specific order, and no sum score is used. The domain of required resources demands input from the surgical team, results in a categorical (yes or no) outcome, and generates a list of potential patients who can be scheduled for surgery under these particular circumstances. The (weighted) items for the domain of patient fitness are the same for every patient, are scored on a numerical scale, but are likely to change during the pandemic as more data become available. Time sensitivity of the procedure is again scored on a numerical scale and becomes increasingly important when returning to elective surgery proves to be acceptably safe. After patient selection, an augmented informed consent, screening, and testing according to local guidelines will take place. CONCLUSIONS: A workflow is proposed for patient selection aiming for the safest possible return to elective orthopedic surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Vles, Georges F; Ghijselings, Stijn; De Ryck, Iris; Meyfroidt, Geert; Sweeney, Nicola A; Oosterlinck, Wouter; Casteels, Minne; Moke, Lieven",J Patient Saf,,387

A database of the COVID-19 Tracking Program in school children was used. METHODS: The data comprised sociodemographic and clinical variables, results of serological tests (IgM and IgG), and real-time-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) results of IgM-positive individuals. The statistical analysis was performed with a 5% significance level. RESULTS: Among 423 children, 107 (25.3%) exhibited seroprevalence with IgG, IgM or IgG/IgM; among 854 adolescents, 250 (29.2%) had positive serology; and among 282 adults, 59 (20.9%) were positive. The frequency of positivity on RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 was 3.5%, 3.6% and 6.0% in children, adolescents and adults, respectively. Children had a lower incidence of symptoms than adolescents (p = 0.001) and adults (p = 0.003); the most frequent were fever, ageusia, anosmia, headache, dry cough, sore throat, muscle pain, runny nose, dyspnoea, and diarrhoea. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence rate for all groups was 26.7% in serology and 4.04% in RT-PCR. Children had lower rates of IgM and fewer symptoms compared with adolescents and adults. The data suggest the potential for transmissibility in all age groups.","Cavalcante Pinto Júnior, Valdester; Moura, Luiz Francisco Wemmenson Gonçalves; Cavalcante, Rodrigo Cardoso; Lima, José Rubens Costa; Bezerra, Arnaldo Solheiro; de Sousa Dantas, Daylana Régia; Amaral, Cícero Matheus Lima; Lima, Daniel Freire; Júnior, Antonio Brazil Viana; Florindo Guedes, Maria Izabel",Int J Infect Dis,,387

In this context, we designed a decentralized, patient-centered randomized clinical trial leveraging mobile technologies, rather than in-person site visits, to test the efficacy of 12 weeks of canagliflozin for the treatment of heart failure, regardless of ejection fraction or diabetes status, on the reduction of heart failure symptoms. METHODS: One thousand nine hundred patients will be enrolled with a medical record-confirmed diagnosis of heart failure, stratified by reduced (&#8804;40%) or preserved (>40%) ejection fraction and randomized 1:1 to 100 mg daily of canagliflozin or matching placebo. The primary outcome will be the 12-week change in the total symptom score of the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire. Secondary outcomes will be daily step count and other scales of the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire. RESULTS: The trial is currently enrolling, even in the era of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: CHIEF-HF (Canagliflozin: Impact on Health Status, Quality of Life and Functional Status in Heart Failure) is deploying a novel model of conducting a decentralized, patient-centered, randomized clinical trial for a new indication for canagliflozin to improve the symptoms of patients with heart failure. It can model a new method for more cost-effectively testing the efficacy of treatments using mobile technologies with patient-reported outcomes as the primary clinical end point of the trial.

Because the release of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) is implicated in ARDS pathogenesis, we investigated the presence of NETs and correlates of pathogenesis in blood and LRT samples of critically ill patients with COVID-19. Plasma NET levels peaked early after intensive care unit admission and were correlated with the SARS-CoV-2 RNA load in sputum and levels of neutrophil-recruiting chemokines and inflammatory markers in plasma samples. The baseline plasma NET quantity was correlated with disease severity but was not associated with soluble markers of thrombosis or with development of thrombosis. High NET levels were present in LRT samples and persisted during the course of COVID-19, consistent with the detection of NETs in bronchi and alveolar spaces in lung tissue from deceased patient with COVID-19. Thus, NETs are produced and retained in the LRT of critically ill patients with COVID-19 and could contribute to SARS-CoV-2-induced ARDS disease.","Ouwendijk, Werner J D; Raadsen, Matthijs P; van Kampen, Jeroen J A; Verdijk, Robert M; von der Thusen, Jan H; Guo, Lihui; Hoek, Rogier A S; van den Akker, Johannes P C; Endeman, Henrik; Langerak, Thomas; Molenkamp, Richard; Gommers, Diederik; Koopmans, Marion P G; van Gorp, Eric C M; Verjans, Georges M G M; Haagmans, Bart L",J Infect Dis,,387

Throughout history, pandemic-related health crises have been associated with the stigmatization and “othering” of people of Asian descent. Asian Americans have experienced verbal and physical violence motivated by individual-level racism and xenophobia from the time they arrived in America in the late 1700s up until the present day. At the institutional level, the state has often implicitly reinforced, encouraged, and perpetuated this violence through bigoted rhetoric and exclusionary policies. COVID-19 has enabled the spread of racism and created national insecurity, fear of foreigners, and general xenophobia, which may be related to the increase in anti-Asian hate crimes during the pandemic. We examine how these crimes – situated in historically entrenched and intersecting individual-level and institutional-level racism and xenophobia – have operated to “other” Asian Americans and reproduce inequality.","Gover, Angela R.; Harper, Shannon B.; Langton, Lynn",Am.

The methods were compliant with the PRISMA guidelines. The review was preregistered with PROSPERO (Registration #: CRD42020181576). A literature search was conducted from January 2010 to April 2020 using ProQuest, Web of Science, PsycINFO, PsycARTICLES, Scopus, SAGE Journals, and CINAHL. Of 3844 articles identified, we included 11 quantitative articles in the final synthesis, representing data from 32, 049 individual respondents from eight countries. We identified three pandemics (COVID-19, MERS-CoV, Influenza A(H1N1) pdm09) as well as several psychological outcomes including anxiety, mental distress, post-traumatic stress disorder, and anger. We also identified several behaviours during pandemics and categorized them into protective, preparedness, and perverse behaviours. The review showed that even though there is limited evidence regarding pandemic-related behaviours and psychological outcomes, the current findings showed that the psychological outcomes significantly impacted on the adoption of the pandemic-related behaviours. Given the negative effects of psychological outcomes on behaviours, we recommend that mental health professionals should promote mental health support to people exhibiting psychological distress resulting from similar events in the future. Also, we recommend that future research should test the hypothesized effects of pandemics and psychological outcomes on behaviour change.","Usher, Kim; Jackson, Debra; Durkin, Joanne; Gyamfi, Naomi; Bhullar, Navjot",Int J Ment Health Nurs,,387

Imaging was reviewed for imaging manifestations of coagulopathy. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to assess for associations of patient demographics, hematologic markers, and outcomes, with the conduct of imaging and imaging manifestations of coagulopathy. RESULTS: Among 308 hospitalized patients with COVID-19, 46% underwent cross-sectional imaging for a total of 332 included cross-sectional imaging examinations. A total of 26% (37/142) of patients demonstrated imaging positive for coagulopathy. The most common such imaging manifestations were pulmonary embolus (n=21) on contrast-enhanced CT or CTA, thrombus in the upper or lower extremity veins (n=13) on Doppler US, end organ infarction in the bowel (n=4) and kidney (n=4) on contrast-enhanced CT, and thrombus or parenchymal infarction in the brain (n=2) on contrast-enhanced CTA or MRI with MRA. Among patients with imaging positive for coagulopathy, 22% (8/37) had multi-site involvement. Thrombi were multifocal in 4 of 5 patients with positive upper and 3 of 8 patients with positive lower extremity examinations and involved both superficial and/or deep veins. In multivariable analysis, intubation (p<0.001) and prolonged prothrombin time (p=0.04) showed a significant association with undergoing imaging; no patient variable was significantly associated with imaging positive for coagulopathy (p>0.05). CONCLUSION: Imaging commonly demonstrates manifestations of coagulopathy in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. In patients with such manifestations, over a fifth demonstrate multi-site involvement. Clinical variables poorly predict which patients have positive imaging, indicating a complementary role of imaging in detecting COVID-19 associated coagulopathy. CLINICAL IMPACT: In patients with COVID-19, CT pulmonary angiogram, extremity Doppler US, contrast-enhanced abdomen CT, and contrast-enhanced brain MRI and MRA may all be appropriate if systemic coagulopathy is suspected, in the absence of imaging contraindications.","O039,; Shea, Aileen; Parakh, Anushri; Hedgire, Sandeep; Lee, Susanna I",,,387

Factors related to this adaptation in UK primary care have not yet been examined. AIM: To assess the responsiveness and prioritisation of primary care consultation type for older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN AND SETTING: A cross-sectional database study examining consultations between 17 February and 10 May 2020 for patients aged &#8805;65 years, drawn from primary care practices within the Oxford Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) Research and Surveillance Centre (RSC) sentinel network, UK. METHOD: The authors reported the proportion of consultation type across five categories: clinical administration, electronic/video, face-to-face, telephone, and home visits. Temporal trends in telephone and face-to-face consultations were analysed by polypharmacy, frailty status, and socioeconomic group using incidence rate ratios (IRR). RESULTS: Across 3 851 304 consultations, the population median age was 75 years (interquartile range [IQR] 70-82); and 46% (n = 82 926) of the cohort (N = 180 420) were male. The rate of telephone and electronic/video consultations more than doubled across the study period (106.0% and 102.8%, respectively). Face-to-face consultations fell by 64.6% and home visits by 62.6%. This predominantly occurred across week 11 (week commencing 9 March 2020), coinciding with national policy change. Polypharmacy and frailty were associated with a relative increase in consultations. The greatest relative increase was among people taking &#8805;10 medications compared with those taking none (face-to-face IRR 9.90, 95% CI = 9.55 to 10.26; telephone IRR 17.64, 95% CI = 16.89 to 18.41).

The structure and mechanism of anti-cancer action of pentapeptide Glu-Gln-Arg-Pro-Arg (EQRPR) derived from a rice bran protein are not known. Theoretical and experimental methods were employed to fill this gap. The conformation analysis of the EQRPR pentapeptide was performed first and the obtained lowest energy conformer was optimized. The experimental structural data obtained by FTIR and CD spectroscopies agree well with the theoretical results. d-isomer introduced one-by-one to each position and all D-isomers of the peptide were also examined for its possible anti-proteolytic and activity enhancement properties. The molecular docking revealed avid binding of the pentapeptide to the integrins α(5)β(1) and α(IIb)β(3), with K(d) values of 90 nM and 180 nM, respectively. Moreover, the EQRPR and its D-isomers showed strong binding affinities to apo- and holo-forms of M(pro), spike glycoprotein, ACE2, and dACE2. The predicted results indicate that the pentapeptide may significantly inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Three kinds of characterization systems were developed namely (a) Block imaging for COVID-19 severity index (CSI); (b) Bispectrum analysis; and (c) Block Entropy. A cohort of Italian patients with 30 controls (990 slices) and 30 COVID-19 patients (705 slices) was used to test the performance of three types of classifiers.

In the midst of the crisis, several hundred thousand Maria survivors boarded humanitarian flights and cruise ships, seeking refuge on the United States mainland. More than three years later, tens of thousands of post-Maria migrants remain on the mainland as long-term emigres. In this article, we lay the theoretical/conceptual groundwork for researchers and practitioners interested in understanding the experiences of post-Maria migrants. Specifically, we aim to assist readers in thinking deeply about: [1] why many Puerto Ricans relocated, [2] the experiences of post-Maria migrants en movimiento, and [3] how such experiences shape their lives, behavior, and well-being. In understanding the experiences of post-Maria migrants, several theories/constructs emerge as especially salient. These include “push and pull” models, cultural stress theory and its transnational variants, the concept of crisis migration, and models of cumulative risk. We provide a succinct overview of each of these theories/constructs and describe the broad perspectives that serve as a foundational or orienting paradigm for our work (i.e., the life course perspective, the strengths perspective, and an ecodevelopmental framework). Finally, we provide illustrations of how these theories/concepts apply to emerging data from the Adelante Boricua study, an ongoing research project with post-Maria migrant youth and their parents, supported by funding from the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities.","Salas-Wright, Christopher P.; Maldonado-Molina, Mildred M.; Brown, Eric C.; Bates, Melissa; Rodríguez, José; García, María Fernanda; Schwartz, Seth J.",Am J Crim Justice,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34248324/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s12103-021-09626-9,387

Research has shown that quarantine is a psychologically stressful experience. With respect to children, lack of school and interruptions to daily routines could have a negative impact on their physical and mental health. Parents may also pass their psychological distress to children and practice inappropriate parenting behaviors, which could contribute to the development of post-traumatic stress symptoms in children.

Hence, these flavonoids and structurally similar indole chalcones derivatives were studied in silico for their pharmacokinetic properties including absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, toxicity (ADMET) and anti-SARS-CoV-2 properties against their proteins, namely, RNA dependent RNA polymerase (rdrp), main protease (M(pro)) and Spike (S) protein via homology modelling and docking. Interactions were studied with respect to biology and function of SARS-CoV-2 proteins for activity. Functional/structural roles of amino acid residues of SARS-CoV-2 proteins and, the effect of flavonoid and indole chalcone interactions which may cause disease suppression are discussed. The results reveal that 30 compounds are capable of M(pro) deactivation as well as potentially lowering the efficiency of M(pro) function. Cyanidin may inhibit RNA polymerase function and, Quercetin is found to block interaction sites on the viral spike. These results suggest flavonoids and their modern pharmaceutical cousins, indole chalcones are capable of fighting SARS-CoV-2.

While many viruses are studied to seek solutions for their adverse impact on human, veterinary, and plant health, the study of baculoviruses was stimulated initially by their potential utility to control insect pests. Later, the utility of baculovirus as gene expression vectors was evidenced leading to numerous applications. Several strategies are employed to obtain recombinant viruses that express large quantities of heterologous proteins. A major step forward was the development of bacmid technology (the construction of bacterial artificial chromosomes containing the genome of the baculovirus) which allows the manipulation of the baculovirus genome in bacteria. With this technology, foreign genes can be introduced into the bacmid by homologous and site-directed recombination or by transposition. Baculoviruses have been used to explore fundamental questions in molecular biology such as the nature of programmed cell-death. Moreover, the ability of baculoviruses to transduce mammalian cells led to the consideration of their use as gene-therapy and vaccine vectors. Strategies for genetic engineering of baculoviruses have been developed to meet the requirements of new application areas. Display of foreign proteins on the surface of virions or in nucleocapsid structures, the assembly of expressed proteins to form virus-like particles or protein complexes have been explored and validated as vaccines. The aim of this chapter is to update the areas of application of the baculoviruses in protein expression, alternative vaccine designs and gene therapy of infectious diseases and genetic disorders.

LASV entry is mediated by the viral envelope glycoprotein (GP), a class I membrane fusogen and the sole viral surface antigen. Previous studies have identified components of the LASV entry pathway, including several cellular receptors and the requirement of endosomal acidification for infection. Here, we first demonstrate that incubation at a physiological temperature and pH consistent with the late endosome is sufficient to render pseudovirions, bearing LASV GP, non-infectious. Antibody binding indicates that this loss of infectivity is due to a conformational change in GP. Finally, we developed a single-particle fluorescence assay to directly visualize individual pseudovirions undergoing LASV GP-mediated lipid mixing with a supported planar bilayer. We report that exposure to endosomal pH at a physiologic temperature is sufficient to trigger GP-mediated lipid mixing. Furthermore, while a cellular receptor is not necessary to trigger lipid mixing, the presence of lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP1) increases the kinetics of lipid mixing at an endosomal pH. Furthermore, we find that LAMP1 permits robust lipid mixing under less acidic conditions than in its absence. These findings clarify our understanding of LASV GP-mediated fusion and the role of LAMP1 binding.","Bulow, Uriel; Govindan, Ramesh; Munro, James B.",Viruses,https://doi.org/10.3390/v12070716; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32630688/,387

Three primer sets were selected from conserved regions of the genome coding for the non-structural proteins and were tested on 61 influenza A (22 H1N1, 9 H2N2, and 30 H3N2), 11 influenza B, and three influenza C isolates. Specific amplified products were obtained with all these strains after electrophoresis on a 2% agarose gel. The specificity of the reaction was increased by hybridization with oligonucleotide probes. When nucleic acids from a variety of micro-organisms from the respiratory tract were subjected to the PCR with these primers, no specific amplified products were generated. The sensitivity of the technique was found to be at the subpicogram level. The RNA-PCR was applied to 21 clinical specimens from patients with a culture/IF proven influenza infection. Six influenza A positive patients and 13 influenza B positive patients could be confirmed in the RNA-PCR. In two cases, influenza B positive IF specimens were found negative by the PCR. No virus could be isolated on eggs or tissue culture from these samples.

SARS-CoV-2 reactive T cells have been reported for SARS-CoV-2 unexposed healthy individuals. Until now, there is no data on T cell immunity to SARS-CoV-2 infection in CVID. This study aimed to evaluate reactive T cells to human endemic corona viruses (HCoV) and to study pre-existing SARS-CoV-2 reactive T cells in unexposed CVID patients. We evaluated SARS-CoV-2- and HCoV-229E and –OC43 reactive T cells in response to seven peptide pools, including spike and nucleocapsid (NCAP) proteins, in 11 unexposed CVID, 12 unexposed and 11 post COVID-19 healthy controls (HC). We further characterized reactive T cells by IFNγ, TNFα and IL-2 profiles. SARS-CoV-2 spike-reactive CD4+ T cells were detected in 7 of 11 unexposed CVID patients, albeit with fewer multifunctional (IFNγ/TNFα/IL-2) cells than unexposed HC. CVID patients had no SARS-CoV-2 NCAP reactive CD4+ T cells and less reactive CD8+ cells compared to unexposed HC. We observed a correlation between T cell reactivity against spike of SARS-CoV-2 and HCoVs in unexposed, but not post COVID-19 HC, suggesting cross-reactivity. T cell responses in post COVID-19 HC could be distinguished from unexposed HC by higher frequencies of triple-positive NCAP reactive CD4+ T cells. Taken together, SARS-CoV-2 reactive T cells are detectable in unexposed CVID patients albeit with lower recognition frequencies and polyfunctional potential. Frequencies of triple-functional reactive CD4+ cells might provide a marker to distinguish HCoV cross-reactive from SARS-CoV-2 specific T cell responses. Our data provides evidence, that anti-viral T cell immunity is not relevantly impaired in most CVID patients.","Steiner, Sophie; Sotzny, Franziska; Bauer, Sandra; Na, Il-Kang; Schmueck-Henneresse, Michael; Corman, Victor M.; Schwarz, Tatjana; Drosten, Christian; Wendering, Désirée J.; Behrends, Uta; Volk, Hans-Dieter; Scheibenbogen, Carmen; Hanitsch, Leif G.",Front Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33424856/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2020.607918,387

By December 2020, the safety and efficacy of the first COVID-19 vaccines were demonstrated. The large social media platform Twitter has been used by medical researchers for the analysis of important public health topics, such as the public’s perception on antibiotic use and misuse and human papillomavirus vaccination. The analysis of Twitter-generated data can be further facilitated by using Twitter’s built-in, anonymous polling tool to gain insight into public health issues and obtain rapid feedback on an international scale. During the fast-paced course of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Twitter polling system has provided a viable method for gaining rapid, large-scale, international public health insights on highly relevant and timely SARS-CoV-2–related topics. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to understand the public’s perception on the safety and acceptance of COVID-19 vaccines in real time by using Twitter polls. METHODS: We developed 2 Twitter polls to explore the public’s views on available COVID-19 vaccines. The surveys were pinned to the Digital Health and Patient Safety Platform Twitter timeline for 1 week in mid-February 2021, and Twitter users and influencers were asked to participate in and retweet the polls to reach the largest possible audience. RESULTS: The adequacy of COVID-19 vaccine safety (ie, the safety of currently available vaccines; poll 1) was agreed upon by 1579 out of 3439 (45.9%) Twitter users. In contrast, almost as many Twitter users (1434/3439, 41.7%) were unsure about the safety of COVID-19 vaccines. Only 5.2% (179/3439) of Twitter users rated the available COVID-19 vaccines as generally unsafe. Poll 2, which addressed the question of whether users would undergo vaccination, was answered affirmatively by 82.8% (2862/3457) of Twitter users, and only 8% (277/3457) categorically rejected vaccination at the time of polling. CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to the perceived high level of uncertainty about the safety of the available COVID-19 vaccines, we observed an elevated willingness to undergo vaccination among our study sample. Since people's perceptions and views are strongly influenced by social media, the snapshots provided by these media platforms represent a static image of a moving target. Thus, the results of this study need to be followed up by long-term surveys to maintain their validity. This is especially relevant due to the circumstances of the fast-paced pandemic and the need to not miss sudden rises in the incidence of vaccine hesitancy, which may have detrimental effects on the pandemic’s course.","Eibensteiner, Fabian; Ritschl, Valentin; Nawaz, Faisal A; Fazel, Sajjad S; Tsagkaris, Christos; Kulnik, Stefan Tino; Crutzen, Rik; Klager, Elisabeth; Völkl-Kernstock, Sabine; Schaden, Eva; Kletecka-Pulker, Maria; Willschke, Harald; Atanasov, Atanas G",J Med Internet Res,https://doi.org/10.2196/28973; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33872185/,387
602692,Education and mental health: good reasons to vaccinate children,2021-07-15,"In 2019, a novel coronavirus emerged in Wuhan in the province of Hubei, China. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) quickly spread across the globe, causing the neoteric COVID-19 pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 is commonly transmitted by droplet infection and aerosols when coughing or sneezing, as well as high-risk exposures to infected individuals by face-to-face contact without protective gear. To date, a broad variety of techniques have emerged to assess and quantify the specific antibody response of a patient towards a SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here, we report the first comprehensive comparison of five different assay systems: Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA), Chemiluminescence Immunoassay (CLIA), Electro-Chemiluminescence Immunoassay (ECLIA), and a new Particle-Enhanced Turbidimetric Immunoassay (PETIA) for SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, we also evaluated the suitability of N-, S1- and RBD-antigens for quantifying the SARS-CoV-2 specific immune response. Linearity and precision, overall sensitivity and specificity of the assays, stability of samples, and cross-reactivity of general viral responses, as well as common coronaviruses, were assessed. Moreover, the reactivity of all tests to seroconversion and different sample matrices was quantified. All five assays showed good overall agreement, with 76% and 87% similarity for negative and positive samples, respectively. In conclusion, all evaluated methods showed a high consistency of results and suitability for the robust quantification of the SARS-CoV-2-derived immune response.","Spaeth, Alexander; Masetto, Thomas; Brehm, Jessica; Wey, Leoni; Kochem, Christian; Brehm, Martin; Peter, Christoph; Grimmler, Matthias",Diagnostics (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34441268/; https://doi.org/10.3390/diagnostics11081332,387
603402,UpdatesMental support for health care professionals essential during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020-07-13,"This study aimed to compare physical activity (PA) levels before and during a pandemic lockdown among adolescent Polish youths in relation to meeting the World Health Organization’s (WHO) recommendations of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and identify potential environmental factors that may affect these levels. An online survey tool that included validated measures of adolescents’ MVPA and socio-environmental, potential confounders was administered to youths (e.g., lack of classmates, motivation, possibility of choosing any physical exercise time, possibility of choosing your own exercises, home environment). The analytic sample comprised 127 adolescents aged 15.4 ± 0.5 years on average (52% girls and 48% boys). The results highlight that among adolescents who did not meet the WHO MVPA recommendations before the lockdown, 13.4% had an increased frequency of PA (from 2.9 to 5.4 day/week) (p = 0.01) during the lockdown. In the group who did meet these recommendations before the lockdown, 50% significantly decreased their level of MVPA below the WHO’s recommendations (p = 0.01). Self-rated health for PA showed a significantly strong correlation with MVPA in the group of students who met the WHO recommendations before the pandemic (r = 0.76; p < 0.05) but failed to maintain that recommendation during the COVID-19 restriction. The results suggest a negative impact of the pandemic on PA undertaken by youths. Based on these results we see the need for increased action by both Physical Education (PE) teachers and parents to motivate and support youngsters in taking up systematic PA consciously.","Bronikowska, Małgorzata; Krzysztoszek, Jana; Łopatka, Marlena; Ludwiczak, Mateusz; Pluta, Beata",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18105139; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34066200/,387

The OH principle needs to be visualized beyond the scope of zoonoses. While conservation, ecological and veterinary professions are getting increasingly engaged with OH, most of the medical/clinical and social sciences professions are only peripherally aware of its nuances. The OH initiatives, by their essentially multidisciplinary nature, entail working across ministries and navigating tacit institutional hierarchies and allocating leadership roles. The logical operational step will be the constitution of One Health Committees (OHC) at the State and district levels. Here, we outline the key foundational principles of OHC and hope that the framework for implementation shall be deliberated through wider consultations and piloted and adopted in a phased manner.","Dasgupta, Rajib; Tomley, Fiona; Alders, Robyn; Barbuddhe, Sukhadeo B.; Kotwani, Anita",Indian J Med Res,https://doi.org/10.4103/ijmr.ijmr_537_21; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33906990/,387

The significance of sampling in mental health surveys during COVID-19,2020-06-02,"Nursing has always been a stressful job affecting the physical and mental health of the nurses, but the new medical context of the COVID-19 pandemic has enhanced this issue. The objective of this paper is to study differences between non-employed and employed nursing students in the medical system of Romania before and during the epidemic using matching methods and a sample of 526 nursing students. Stressors and strategies for coping with stress were also identified during the pandemic. The results indicated that employed students were more vulnerable to stress compared to non-employed ones before and during the pandemic. Females registered significantly higher stress scores compared to males in the period of the epidemic. The analysis of the overall sample suggested that gender and environment were significant stress factors during the pandemic, but living conditions were not relevant. The most effective coping strategies against stress for nurses during the COVID-19 crisis were based on self-control and the spiritual dimension, unlike the previous period when other colleagues’ support helped most nurses to overcome difficult working conditions. The implications of this study might help medical management in ensuring a less stressful environment for nurses during the epidemic.","Simionescu, Mihaela; Pellegrini, Angelo; Bordea, Elena-Nicoleta",Healthcare (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34071805/; https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare9060633,387

Patients with RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 infection were assigned to recovery group if they made a full recovery and to death group if they died within 2 months of hospitalization. Chest CT examinations for ground-glass opacity, crazy-paving pattern, consolidation, and fibrosis were scored by two reviewers. The total CT score comprised the sum of lung involvement (5 lobes, scores 1–5 for each lobe, range; 0, none; 25, maximum). 40 patients who recovered from COVID-19 and six patients who died were enrolled. The initial chest CTs showed 27 (58.7%) patients had ground-glass opacity, 19 (41.3%) had ground glass and consolidation, and 35 (76.1%) patients had crazy-paving pattern. None of the patients who died had fibrosis in contrast to six (15%) patients who recovered from COVID-19. Most patients had subpleural lesions (89.0%) as well as bilateral (87.0%) and lower (93.0%) lung lobe involvement. Diffuse lesions were present in four (67%) patients who succumbed to coronavirus but only one (2.5%) patient who recovered (p < 0.001). In the death group of patients, the total CT score was higher than that of the recovery group (p = 0.005). Patients in the death group had lower lymphocyte count and higher C-reactive protein than those in the recovery group (p = 0.011 and p = 0.041, respectively). A high CT score and diffuse distribution of lung lesions in COVID-19 are indicative of disease severity and short-term mortality.","Lei, Qiang; Li, Guangming; Ma, Xiaofen; Tian, Junzhang; Wu, Yun fan; Chen, Hui; Xu, Wen; Li, Cheng; Jiang, Guihua",Sci Rep,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-79183-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33441572/,387
609412,Factors Affecting Delivery Health Service Satisfaction of Women and Fear of COVID− 19: Implications for Maternal and Child Health in Pakistan,2021-04-26,"Social distancing is an effective way to contain the spread of a contagious disease, particularly when facing a novel pathogen and no pharmacological interventions are available. In such cases, conventional wisdom suggests that social distancing measures should be introduced as soon as possible after the beginning of an outbreak to more effectively mitigate the spread of the disease. Using a simple epidemiological model we show that, however, there is in fact an optimal time to initiate a temporal social distancing intervention if the goal is to reduce the final epidemic size or flatten the epidemic curve. The optimal timing depends strongly on the effective reproduction number (R0) of the disease, such that as the R0 increases, the optimal time decreases non-linearly. Additionally, if pharmacological interventions (e.g., a vaccine) become available at some point during the epidemic, the sooner these interventions become available the sooner social distancing should be initiated to maximize its effectiveness. Although based on a simple model, we hope that these insights inspire further investigations within the context of more complex and data-driven epidemiological models, and can ultimately help decision makers to improve temporal social distancing policies to mitigate the spread of epidemics.","Patterson-Lomba, Oscar",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.30.20048132,387

However, an assessment of sleep using validated measures among healthcare workers on social media is lacking. METHODS: A restricted, self-selection survey was distributed on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram for 16 days targeting healthcare workers who were clinically active during COVID-19. In addition to demographics and career information, participants completed the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and Insomnia Severity Index. Poor sleep quality was defined as PSQI > 5. Moderate-to-severe insomnia was defined as an ISI > 14. Multivariate logistic regression tested the association between demographics and career characteristics and sleep outcomes. RESULTS: Of the 983 who clicked our link, 906 completed the survey. Participants were mostly white (70%), female (75%), physicians (64%). Mean sleep duration was 6.1 (SD1.2) hours. Nearly 90% experienced poor sleep (PSQI). One third reported moderate or severe insomnia. Many (60%) reported sleep disruptions due to device usage or due to bad dreams at least once per week (45%). In multivariable regression, non-physicians (OR 3.5, CI: 2.5, 5.0), Hispanic ethnicity (OR 2.2; CI: 1.44, 3.45), being single (1.5, CI: 1.03, 2.21), and youngest age group (18–24) (OR 9.9; CI: 1.44, 68.09) had increased odds of insomnia. In open-ended comments, sleep disruptions mapped to 5 categories: (1) Work demands (“The volume of calls and messages from my patient and caregiver population is through the roof”); (2) Pandemic related (“I never had sleep issues prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. Suddenly I had issues with sleep initiation.”; (3) Children and family (“COVID plus home stress plus stress over my kids, my job, my marriage.”); (4) Personal health (“Insomnia predating COVID, but worsened with COVID.”); (5) Responses to the pandemic (“I worry about how COVID is being managed by the President...This does keep me awake at night.”). CONCLUSION: During the COVID-19 pandemic, 90% of healthcare workers surveyed on social media reported poor sleep, with over one-third of participants reporting moderate-severe insomnia. Online sleep interventions for healthcare workers are urgently needed.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has shifted their recommendations recently, allowing for the co-administration of the currently available COVID-19 vaccines with other vaccines. This is based on the experience with non-COVID-19 vaccines, where the immunogenicity and adverse event profiles were generally similar when vaccines are administered simultaneously or alone. CASE REPORT: We present a case of a 29-year-old Asian woman who received the first dose of BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine and the tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccine at around the same time. BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine and Tdap vaccine were administered into the deltoid region of the left arm and right arm, respectively. We then monitored for immunogenicity. We observed a delay in the development of SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S1) protein antibodies at around 8 weeks after the second dose. CONCLUSIONS: Unless warranted, it is important to adhere to current CDC recommendations with regards to the co-administration of vaccines. Although the administration of Tdap with COVID-19 vaccine in our case caused delay in immunogenicity, it did not negate the ability of the BNT162B2 mRNA vaccine to elicit an adequate immune response. The reason for delay in immune response with co-administration of COVID-19 vaccines with other vaccines is unknown and further studies are needed.","Chilimuri, Sridhar; Mantri, Nikhitha; Shrestha, Elina; Sun, Haozhe; Gongati, Sudharsan; Zahid, Maleeha; Kelly, Paul",Am J Case Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34304240/; https://doi.org/10.12659/ajcr.933003,387

The poorest Americans were put at risk of food deprivation as their incomes fell. Disruptions reverberated through the food supply chain as the pandemic escalated; meatpacking plants became disease hotspots. The Coronavirus Food Assistance Program (CFAP) provided US$ 16 billion of aid to farmers and ranchers based on falling prices. CFAP added to the counter‐cyclical safety‐net programmes legislated in 2018 and ad hoc support authorised for two years by the Trump administration. The CFAP support is reasonable in the context of the pandemic‐related economic collapse, but also raises concern about increased support tied to market conditions and current production, including support linked to unilateral US trade policies that have invoked retaliation by trading partners. As of early June, the hopeful scenario was that the worst challenges to the food system had passed. Grain and livestock inventories were relatively high and spring planting intentions were strong, but supply constraints in North America or internationally remained a risk. The pandemic has underscored the inherent fragility of an integrated world and the high stakes in the debate about globalisation that will inevitably follow.","Orden, David",EuroChoices,https://doi.org/10.1111/1746-692x.12273,387

There is currently no validated objective way to predict which patients will end up needing ventilator support, when the disease is mild and not progressed. N=869 patients from two sites (D1: N=822, D2: N=47) with baseline clinical characteristics and chest CT scans were considered for this study. The entire dataset was randomly divided into 70% training, D1 train (N=606) and 30% test-set (D test : D1 test (N=216) + D2 (N=47)). An expert radiologist delineated ground-glass-opacities (GGOs) and consolidation regions on a subset of D1 train, (D1 train_sub, N=88). These regions were automatically segmented and used along with their corresponding CT volumes to train an imaging AI predictor (AIP) on D1 train to predict the need of mechanical ventilators for COVID-19 patients. Finally, top five prognostic clinical factors selected using univariate analysis were integrated with AIP to construct an integrated clinical and AI imaging nomogram (ClAIN). Univariate analysis identified lactate dehydrogenase, prothrombin time, aspartate aminotransferase, %lymphocytes, albumin as top five prognostic clinical features. AIP yielded an AUC of 0.81 on D test and was independently prognostic irrespective of other clinical parameters on multivariable analysis (p<0.001). ClAIN improved the performance over AIP yielding an AUC of 0.84 (p=0.04) on D test. ClAIN outperformed AIP in predicting which COVID-19 patients ended up needing a ventilator.

In this context, this paper presents a study of the new coronavirus SARS-COV-2 with a focus on verifying the virus propagation associated with mitigation procedures and massive vaccination campaigns. There were two proposed methodologies in making predictions 28 days ahead for the number of new cases, deaths, and ICU patients of five European countries: Portugal, France, Italy, the United Kingdom, and Germany. A case study of the results of massive immunization in Israel was also considered. The data input of cases, deaths, and daily ICU patients was normalized to reduce discrepant numbers due to the countries’ size and the cumulative vaccination values by the percentage of population immunized (with at least one dose of the vaccine). As a comparative criterion, the calculation of the mean absolute error (MAE) of all predictions presents the best methodology, targeting other possibilities of use for the method proposed. The best architecture achieved a general MAE for the 1-to-28-day ahead forecast, which is lower than 30 cases, 0.6 deaths, and 2.5 ICU patients per million people.","Carvalho, Kathleen; Vicente, João Paulo; Jakovljevic, Mihajlo; Teixeira, João Paulo Ramos",Bioengineering (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/bioengineering8060084; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34208000/,387

Conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic, this study (n = 310) tested whether past and current engagement with thematically relevant media fictions, including horror and pandemic films, was associated with greater preparedness for and psychological resilience toward the pandemic. Since morbid curiosity has previously been associated with horror media use during the COVID-19 pandemic, we also tested whether trait morbid curiosity was associated with pandemic preparedness and psychological resilience during the COVID-19 pandemic. We found that fans of horror films exhibited greater resilience during the pandemic and that fans of “prepper” genres (alien-invasion, apocalyptic, and zombie films) exhibited both greater resilience and preparedness. We also found that trait morbid curiosity was associated with positive resilience and interest in pandemic films during the pandemic. Taken together, these results are consistent with the hypothesis that exposure to frightening fictions allow audiences to practice effective coping strategies that can be beneficial in real-world situations.","Scrivner, Coltan; Johnson, John A.; Kjeldgaard-Christiansen, Jens; Clasen, Mathias",Pers Individ Dif,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0191886920305882; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32952249/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886920305882?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2020.110397,387

To identify factors driving severe progression of COVID-19, we performed single-cell RNA-seq using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) obtained from healthy donors, patients with mild or severe COVID-19, and patients with severe influenza. Patients with COVID-19 exhibited hyper-inflammatory signatures across all types of cells among PBMCs, particularly up-regulation of the TNF/IL-1β-driven inflammatory response as compared to severe influenza. In classical monocytes from patients with severe COVID-19, type I IFN response co-existed with the TNF/IL-1β-driven inflammation, and this was not seen in patients with milder COVID-19. Interestingly, we documented type I IFN-driven inflammatory features in patients with severe influenza as well. Based on this, we propose that the type I IFN response plays a pivotal role in exacerbating inflammation in severe COVID-19.","Lee, Jeong Seok; Park, Seongwan; Jeong, Hye Won; Ahn, Jin Young; Choi, Seong Jin; Lee, Hoyoung; Choi, Baekgyu; Nam, Su Kyung; Sa, Moa; Kwon, Ji-Soo; Jeong, Su Jin; Lee, Heung Kyu; Park, Sung Ho; Park, Su-Hyung; Choi, Jun Yong; Kim, Sung-Han; Jung, Inkyung; Shin, Eui-Cheol",Sci Immunol,https://doi.org/10.1126/sciimmunol.abd1554; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32651212/,387

RNAi is now widely appreciated as an important gene control mechanism in mammals, and several RNAi‐based gene‐silencing applications have already been used in clinical trials. In this review I will discuss RNAi approaches to inhibit the pathogenic human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV‐1), which establishes a chronic infection that would most likely require a durable gene therapy approach. Viruses, such as HIV‐1, are particularly difficult targets for RNAi attack because they mutate frequently, which allows viral escape by mutation of the RNAi target sequence. Combinatorial RNAi strategies are required to prevent viral escape.","Berkhout, Ben",Ann N Y Acad Sci,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1749-6632.2009.04972.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19796072/,387

Patients admitted to the hospital have increased mortality rates and patients requiring intensive care have significantly increased mortality rates. Multiple factors influence these outcomes. This study used simple demographic information available on admission to evaluate possible associations between these variables and outcomes, including mortality and length of stay. Clinical outcomes in 63 patients admitted to a tertiary care hospital in West Texas were reviewed. Older patients, patients admitted from nursing homes, and patients admitted to medical intensive care units had increased mortality. Unadjusted analysis indicated that males had increased mortality. Adjusted analysis indicated that males spent nearly 5 days longer in the hospital than females. In summary, age, chronic illness requiring nursing home placement, and acute severe illness requiring intensive care unit admission identify patients with worse prognoses. In addition, males will likely have a longer length of hospital stay.","Ali, Kiran; Rao, Sanjana; Dennis, Jeff; Berdine, Gilbert; Test, Victor; Nugent, Kenneth",J Prim Care Community Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33135551/; https://doi.org/10.1177/2150132720970717,387

620862,Hospital Emergency Management of Emerging Infectious Disease using Instant Communication Technology,2020-05-12,"WHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVE: The sudden and extensive outbreak of coronavirus (SARS‐CoV‐2) has overshadowed another developing viral threat: the Zika flavivirus. Of particular concern is that pregnant women can pass Zika virus to the foetus, and there is a strong implication of an association between Zika virus infection and foetal microcephaly. Currently, there is no vaccine, and there is no cure. METHODS: Published literature and Internet sources were searched for information related to Zika virus, its transmission, its clinical presentation and sequalae, prevention and implications (practice and regulatory) for healthcare providers. The identified English sources were reviewed, assessed and synthesized. Emphasis was placed on providing an overview of the problem, and identification of unmet needs and future directions. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Zika virus poses a major challenge for healthcare providers, particularly in areas unaccustomed to it, since it is transmitted to humans by the vector Aedes aegypti mosquito. The outbreak impacts every healthcare provider, because every provider is required to report cases of Zika infection to their state or local health agencies––whether the infection is confirmed or merely suspected. Since the virus has become a worldwide crisis, healthcare providers will need to work across national boundaries and medical disciplines in order to educate patients about Zika symptoms and the mosquito vector. Until further information is known, infected patients (male and female) are being advised to avoid conceiving a child. WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: Until a vaccine is developed or effective treatment for Zika virus is discovered, healthcare providers must be AVP (aware, vigilant and proactive) in order to lessen the spread and impact of the implicated devastating birth defects (microcephaly) and other neurological disorders (eg Guillain‐Barré Syndrome) of this infection. Unfortunately, many knowledge gaps exist. There is an urgent need for a reliable, inexpensive diagnostic test, an effective treatment and an approved and readily available vaccine.","Pergolizzi, Joseph; LeQuang, Jo Ann; Umeda‐Raffa, Sumiyo; Fleischer, Charles; Pergolizzi, Joseph; Pergolizzi, Claudio; Raffa, Robert B.",J Clin Pharm Ther,https://doi.org/10.1111/jcpt.13310; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33217046/,387
620874,Could COVID-19 Reverse the Modest Gains Made in Newborn Health in Ethiopia?,2021-05-03,"BACKGROUND: During the COVID-19 pandemic, the depression level among US adults has significantly increased. Age disparity in depression during the pandemic has been reported in recent studies. Delay or avoidance of medical care is one of the collateral damages associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, and it can lead to increased morbidity and mortality. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the prevalence of depression and delayed care among US middle-aged adults and older adults during the pandemic, as well as investigate the association of delayed care with depression among those 2 age groups. METHODS: This cross-sectional study used data from the 2020 Health and Retirement Study (HRS) COVID-19 Project (Early, Version 1.0). Univariate analyses, bivariate analyses, and binary logistic regression were applied. US adults older than 46 years were included. Depression was measured by the Composite International Diagnostic Interview-Short Form (CIDI-SF). Delayed care was measured by the following 4 items: delayed surgery, delayed seeing a doctor, delayed dental care, and other delayed care. RESULTS: A total of 3246 participants were identified. More than half of the participants were older than 65 years (n=1890, 58.2%), and 274 (8.8%) participants had depression during the pandemic. Delayed dental care was positively associated with depression among both middle-aged adults (OR 2.05, 95% CI 1.04-4.03; P=.04) and older adults (OR 3.08, 95% CI 1.07-8.87; P=.04). Delayed surgery was positively associated with depression among older adults (OR 3.69, 95% CI 1.06-12.90; P=.04). Self-reported pain was positively related to depression among both age groups. Middle-aged adults who reported higher education levels (some college or above) or worse self-reported health had a higher likelihood of having depression. While perceived more loneliness was positively associated with depression among older adults, financial difficulty was positively associated with depression among middle-aged adults. CONCLUSIONS: This study found that depression was prevalent among middle-aged and older adults during the pandemic. The study highlighted the collateral damage of the COVID-19 pandemic by identifying the association of delayed surgery and dental care with depression during the pandemic. Although surgery and dental care cannot be delivered by telehealth, telehealth services can still be provided to address patients' concerns on delayed surgery and dental care. Moreover, the implementation of telemental health services is needed to address mental health symptoms among US middle-aged and older adults during the pandemic. Future research that uses more comprehensive measurements for delayed care is needed to decipher the path through which delayed care is associated with depression.","Luo, Yan",JMIR Aging,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34524964/; https://doi.org/10.2196/29953,387

Specifically the JHM strain of MHV (MHV-JHM) generally causes an acute encephalitis when inoculated is into 2-day-old Wistar Furth rats. In contrast, JHM generally produces a chronic demyelinating disease with resulting posterior paralysis when inoculated is into 10-day-old Wistar Furth rats. In addition, while JHM readily produces a productive infection in a mouse fibroblast cell line (L-2), it does not form syncytia or replicate well in a tissue cell line of glial origin (G26-24). We have isolated and characterized three MHV-JHM viral variants from the central nervous system of two Wistar Furth rats with a MHV-JHM-induced demyelinating disease. The pattern of viral-specific mRNA for all three of these variants differed from what was observed for the wild-type parental MHV-JHM that had been passaged only in tissue culture. One of these variants, ATIIf cord virus, which induced a chronic demyelinating disease in 2- or 10-day-old intracerebrally inoculated Wistar Furth rats, had a deletion in the coding region of the peplomer glycoprotein mRNA. In addition, this variant formed massive syncytia and replicated well in G26-24 cells. We have not detected this deletion in the other two JHM variants, ATIIf brain virus and ATIIe brain virus. ATIIf brain virus and ATIIe brain virus primarily produced an acute encephalitis when reinoculated into 2-or 10-day-old Wistar Furth rats. In addition, these two variants did not form syncytia and had a reduced ability to replicate in G26-24 cells.","Morris, Vincent L.; Tieszer, Christina; MacKinnon, Joanne; Percy, Dean",Virology,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/0042682289900482; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2538027/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0042682289900482,387

Each of the compartments of this transport pathway carries out particular metabolic functions(5–8), and therefore presumably contains a distinct complement of membrane proteins. Thus, mechanisms must exist for localizing such proteins to their respective destinations. However, a major obstacle to the study of such mechanisms is that the isolation and detailed analysis of such internal membrane proteins pose formidable technical problems. We have therefore used the E1 glycoprotein from coronavirus MHV-A59 as a viral model for this class of protein. Here we present the primary structure of the protein, determined by analysis of cDNA clones prepared from viral mRNA. In combination with a previous study of its assembly into the endoplasmic reticulum membrane(9), the sequence reveals several unusual features of the protein which may be related to its intracellular localization.","Armstrong, John; Niemann, Heiner; Smeekens, Sjef; Rottier, Peter; Warren, Graham",Nature,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6325918/,387

The present study was initiated by an observation that histamine did not evoke a flare around a wheal in the skin of an 86-year-old man. Could that be of relevance to the findings that old men are prone to a more severe COVD-19 infection with a higher mortality than young ones? MATERIALS AND METHODS: Histamine SPT was performed on the forearm of six old men, all above the age of 80. The skin reactions were photographed from above and from the side. The photographs taken from above were treated in a computer with LYYN, a program that increases color differences. With the help of ImageJ (NIH), the size relation between flare and wheal was calculated. On the photographs, taken as side views, areas, heights, and diameters of wheals were measured. Controls consisted of three groups of younger people. RESULTS: Among the old men, no or only a small flare was seen. All the controls had prominent flares. Histamine SPT evoked small wheals in the group of old men as compared to young men.

The association between positive tests and infectious virus is important to quantify. METHODS: A two months cohort of retrospective data and consecutively collected specimens from COVID-19 patients or patients under investigation were used to understand the correlation between prolonged viral RNA positive test results, cycle threshold (Ct) values and growth of SARS-CoV-2 in cell culture. Whole genome sequencing was used to confirm virus genotype in patients with prolonged viral RNA detection. Droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) was used to assess the rate of false negative COVID-19 diagnostic tests. RESULTS: In two months, 29,686 specimens were tested and 2,194 patients received repeated testing. Virus recovery in cell culture was noted in specimens with SARS-CoV-2 target genes’ Ct value average of 18.8 ± 3.4. Prolonged viral RNA shedding was associated with positive virus growth in culture in specimens collected up to 20 days after the first positive result but mostly in individuals symptomatic at time of sample collection. Whole genome sequencing provided evidence the same virus was carried over time. Positive tests following negative tests had Ct values higher than 29.5 and were not associated with virus culture. ddPCR was positive in 5.6% of negative specimens collected from COVID-19 confirmed or clinically suspected patients.

Despite the large number of studies found in the literature on PLA devices, relatively few papers focus on the effects of sterilization treatments on its properties. It is well documented in the literature that conventional sterilization techniques, such as heat, gamma irradiation and ethylene oxide, can induced damages, alterations or toxic products release, due to the thermal and hydrolytical sensitivity of PLA. The purposes of this paper are, therefore, to review the published data on the most common techniques used to sterilize PLA medical devices and to analyse how they are affecting their physicochemical and biocompatible properties.

Thus, the objective of this research was to analyze whether different types of emotion regulation strategies, both adaptive and maladaptive, mediate the relationship between family of origin violence and intimate partner violence in the Mexican population. A total of 838 participants (45.9% men and 54.1% women) responded to instruments addressing family of origin violence, emotion regulation strategies, and intimate partner violence. The results revealed that both structural models were significant. For women, the model showed an adequate fit X(2) (11, N = 838) = 22.75, p = .288, GFI = .95, AGFI = .91, NFI = .98, CFI = .97, RMSEA = .05.

Specifically, the direct effects of adaptive strategies on intimate partner violence were statistically significant. Meanwhile, the direct effects of family of origin violence on maladaptive emotion regulation strategies were significant, as were the direct effects of maladaptive strategies on intimate partner violence. In turn, the indirect effects of family of-origin violence were significantly related to intimate partner violence via maladaptive emotion regulation strategies. In addition, the results clearly showed that men reported higher levels of aggression against women.

The nanocarbon filter functions as a superior barrier compared to those in conventional masks owing to the stronger, more uniform, and more durable hydrophobic nature of the carbon nanotubes. A tightly knit carbon nanotube network has a pore size smaller than that of the average coronavirus; nevertheless, the breathability is equal to that of the conventional polypropylene filter. The exceptional thermal conductivity of carbon nanotubes transpires hyperthermic antiviral effects, which offers stronger protection against the virus, as well as reusability. The facile processability, low cost, and light weight of the aerosol-synthesized carbon nanotube filter warrants its viability, reinforcing the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.","Lee, Sangsu; Nam, Jeong-Seok; Han, Jiye; Zhang, Qiang; Kauppinen, Esko I.; Jeon, Il",ACS Appl Nano Mater,https://doi.org/10.1021/acsanm.1c01386,387

We describe changes in pre-travel vaccination rates and post-travel referrals after animal contact. We conducted a nationwide, retrospective study for 2014-2018. The ratio of rabies vaccine courses distributed to travelers and the number of Israeli-tourist-entries to endemic countries was calculated, as was the proportion of travelers referred to a post-travel clinic after animal contact. During the study period, the ratio of pre-travel vaccine courses distributed nationally to outgoing tourism to endemic countries was stable at ≈0.7%; 13% of 256,969 pre-travel consultations included recommendation for rabies vaccination. Backpackers were more likely to be immunized (40.2%) than business travelers (4.4%) or travelers planning organized/high-end travel (2.0%). However, rates of rabies vaccination among backpackers showed a decline during the study period. Post-travel referrals after animal contact were stable at 2% of all referrals; most were exposed in Asia (69.5%) and 51% were bitten by dogs. Only 38% received post-exposure prophylaxis abroad. We conclude that only a minority of Israeli travelers, including backpackers, receive rabies pre-exposure prophylaxis. The proportion of travelers with potentially rabid animal contact is not decreasing; however, many exposed travelers do not receive post-exposure prophylaxis during travel. Because rabies control programs have been compromised in endemic countries during the COVID-19 pandemic, the need to provide rabies protection to travelers has become more urgent. After the ACIP's adoption of the World Health Organization's (WHO) 2-dose regimen, a revision of current vaccine guidelines is required to provide a simplified, more inclusive rabies vaccine policy.","Meltzer, Eyal; Yanuka, Remez; Schwartz, Eli",The American journal of tropical medicine and hygiene,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34398815/; https://doi.org/10.4269/ajtmh.20-1604,387

Enabling rural and regional patients to access specialist surgical prehabilitation support with the use of telehealth technology has the potential to overcome health inequities and improve post-operative outcomes. AIM: To evaluate the current and likely future impact of a telehealth preoperative education package for patients preparing for major abdominal cancer surgery. METHODS: A telehealth alternative to a hospital based pre-operative education session was developed and implemented at a dedicated cancer hospital. Adult patients (≥18 years) scheduled for elective major cancer surgery were offered this telehealth alternative. Impact evaluation was conducted using the RE-AIM framework. RESULTS: To date, 35 participants have consented to participate in the study. Thirty-one participants attended the intervention; 24 (69%) residing in rural or regional areas. Twenty-four (77%) reported that if given a choice they would prefer the online session as opposed to attending the hospital in person. The majority (97%) reported they would recommend the intervention to others preparing for surgery. Session information was recalled by all 26 participants and 77% of participants reported acting on recommendations 2 weeks after the session. Lessons learnt and recommendations for providers implementing similar programs are reported. CONCLUSION: Telehealth alternatives to hospital based pre-operative education are well received by patients preparing for major cancer surgery. We make seven recommendations to improve implementation. Further evaluation of implementation strategies alongside clinical effectiveness in future studies is essential.

637849,Utilization of Teleconsultation: Mitigation in Handling Mental Disorders in the COVID-19 Era,2020-06-09,"BACKGROUND: The World Health Organization (WHO), like many other organisations around the world, has recognised the need to use more rigorous processes to ensure that health care recommendations are informed by the best available research evidence. This is the thirteenth of a series of 16 reviews that have been prepared as background for advice from the WHO Advisory Committee on Health Research to WHO on how to achieve this. OBJECTIVES: We reviewed the literature on applicability, transferability, and adaptation of guidelines. METHODS: We searched five databases for existing systematic reviews and relevant primary methodological research. We reviewed the titles of all citations and retrieved abstracts and full text articles if the citations appeared relevant to the topic. We checked the reference lists of articles relevant to the questions and used snowballing as a technique to obtain additional information. We used the definition ""coming from, concerning or belonging to at least two or all nations"" for the term international. Our conclusions are based on the available evidence, consideration of what WHO and other organisations are doing and logical arguments. KEY QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS: We did not identify systematic reviews addressing the key questions. We found individual studies and projects published in the peer reviewed literature and on the Internet. Should WHO develop international recommendations? • Resources for developing high quality recommendations are limited. Internationally developed recommendations can facilitate access to and pooling of resources, reduce unnecessary duplication, and involve international scientists. • Priority should be given to international health problems and problems that are important in low and middle-income countries, where these advantages are likely to be greatest. • Factors that influence the transferability of recommendations across different settings should be considered systematically and flagged, including modifying factors, important variation in needs, values, costs and the availability of resources. What should be done centrally and locally? • The preparation of systematic reviews and evidence profiles should be coordinated centrally, in collaboration with organizations that produce systematic reviews. Centrally developed evidence profiles should be adaptable to specific local circumstances. • Consideration should be given to models that involve central coordination with work being undertaken by centres located throughout the world. • While needs, availability of resources, costs, the presence of modifying factors and values need to be assessed locally, support for undertaking these assessments may be needed to make guidelines applicable. • WHO should provide local support for adapting and implementing recommendations by developing tools, building capacity, learning from international experience, and through international networks that support evidence-informed health policies, such as the Evidence-informed Policy Network (EVIPNet). How should recommendations be adapted? • WHO should provide detailed guidance for adaptation of international recommendations. • Local adaptation processes should be systematic and transparent, they should involve stakeholders, and they should report the key factors that influence decisions, including those flagged in international guidelines, and the reasons for any modifications that are made.","Schünemann, Holger J; Fretheim, Atle; Oxman, Andrew D",Health Res Policy Syst,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17156457/,387

639025,Working during pandemics: the need for mental health efforts to prevent the outbreak of mental disorders at the workplace,2020-08-31,"Background The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization, while several key epidemiological parameters of the disease remain to be clarified. This study aimed to obtain robust estimates of the incubation period, upper limit of latent period (interval between exposure of infector and infectee), serial interval, time point of exposure and basic reproduction number (R0) of COVID-19. Methods Between late February and early March of 2020, the individual data of laboratory confirmed cases of COVID-19 were retrieved from 10728 publicly available reports released by the health authorities of and outside China and from 1790 publications identified in PubMed and CNKI. To be eligible, a report had to contain the data that allowed for estimation of at least one parameter. As relevant data mainly came from clustering cases, the clusters for which no evidence was available to establish transmission order were all excluded to ensure accuracy of estimates. Additionally, only the cases with an exposure period spanning 3 days or less were included in the estimation of parameters involving exposure date, and a simple method for determining exposure date was adopted to ensure the error of estimates be small (< 0.3 day). Depending on specific parameters, three or four of normal, lognormal, Weibull, and gamma distributions were fitted to the datasets and the results from appropriate models were presented. Findings In total, 1155 cases from China, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, Vietnam, Germany and Malaysia were included for the final analysis. The mean and standard deviation were 7.44 days and 4.39 days for incubation period, 2.52 days and 3.95 days for the upper limit of latent period, 6.70 days and 5.20 days for serial interval, and -0.19 day (i.e., 0.19 day before symptom onset of infector) and 3.32 days for time point of exposure. R0 was estimated to be 1.70 and 1.78 based on two different formulas. For 39 (6.64%) cases, the incubation periods were longer than 14 days. In 102 (43.78%) infector-infectee pairs, transmission occurred before the symptom onsets of infectors. In 27 (3.92%) infector-infectee pairs, symptom onsets of infectees occurred before those of infectors. Stratified analysis showed that incubation period and serial interval were consistently longer for those with less severe disease and for those whose primary cases had less severe disease. Asymptomatic transmission was also observed. Interpretation This study obtained robust estimates of several key epidemiological parameters of COVID-19. The findings support current practice of 14-day quarantine of persons with potential exposure, but also suggest that longer monitoring periods might be needed for selected groups. The estimates of serial interval, time point of exposure and latent period provide consistent evidence on pre-symptomatic transmission. This together with asymptomatic transmission and the generally longer incubation and serial interval of less severe cases suggests a high risk of long-term epidemic in the absence of appropriate control measures.","Ma, Shujuan; Zhang, Jiayue; Zeng, Minyan; Yun, Qingping; Guo, Wei; Zheng, Yixiang; Zhao, Shi; Wang, Maggie H; Yang, Zuyao",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.21.20040329,387

The principles of SPR-based biosensors are summarized first, focusing on the physical properties of the transducer, on the assays design, on the immobilization chemistry, and on new trends for implementing system analytical performances (e.g., coupling with nanoparticles (NPs). Then we critically review the detection of analytes of interest in molecular diagnostics, such as hormones (relevant also for anti-doping control) and biomarkers of interest in inflammatory, cancer, and heart failure diseases. Antibody detection is reported in relation to immune disorder diagnostics. Subsequently, nucleic acid targets are considered for revealing genetic diseases (e.g., point mutation and single nucleotides polymorphism, SNPs) as well as new emerging clinical markers (microRNA) and for pathogen detection. Finally, examples of pathogen detection by immunosensing were also analyzed.

A total of 5,91,971 cases and 2,70,90 deaths were registered till 28(th) March, 2020. We aimed to predict the impact of duration of exposure to COVID-19 on the mortality rates increment. METHODS: In the present study, data on COVID-19 infected top seven countries viz., Germany, China, France, United Kingdom, Iran, Italy and Spain, and World as a whole, were used for modeling. The analytical procedure of generalized linear model followed by Gompertz link function was used to predict the impact lethal duration of exposure on the mortality rates. FINDINGS: Of the selected countries and World as whole, the projection based on 21st March, 2020 cases, suggest that a total (95% Cl) of 76 (65–151) days of exposure in Germany, mortality rate will increase by 5 times to 1%. In countries like France and United Kingdom, our projection suggests that additional exposure of 48 days and 7 days, respectively, will raise the mortality rates to10%. Regarding Iran, Italy and Spain, mortality rate will rise to 10% with an additional 3–10 days of exposure. World’s mortality rates will continue increase by 1% in every three weeks. The predicted interval of lethal duration corresponding to each country has found to be consistent with the mortality rates observed on 28th March, 2020. CONCLUSION: The prediction of lethal duration was found to have apparently effective in predicting mortality, and shows concordance with prevailing rates. In absence of any vaccine against COVID-19 infection, the present study adds information about the quantum of the severity and time elapsed to death will help the Government to take necessary and appropriate steps to control this pandemic.","Verma, Vivek; Vishwakarma, Ramesh K.; Verma, Anita; Nath, Dilip C.; Khan, Hafiz T.

In order to realize a buildings’ carbon mitigation targets, the impact of individual occupancy profiles needs to be integrated with building simulation models. This paper introduces a decision support framework as a potential solution to make energy performance upgrade choices based on different occupancy profiles. This framework has been demonstrated through a case study of two single-family detached homes in Canada, which were highly instrumented with sensors for monitoring energy input and output. The case studies represented two common occupancy profiles-(1) a family of four (consisting of 2 working adults and 2 teenagers); and (2) a retired couple. Firstly, calibrated energy models were developed by using one-year energy use data collected through an intrusive load monitoring technique. Secondly, energy upgrade combinations were considered for each profile and tested for additional investment, payback period and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Lastly, the most suitable combination of energy upgrade for each profile was ranked using a multi-criteria decision-making method (e.g., TOPSIS). Results indicated that the retired couple used more energy than the family of four and required energy upgrades with usually higher payback periods to achieve the same level of GHG emission reduction. The results of this research are timely for energy policymaking and developing best management practices, which need to be implemented along with the deployment of more stringent building standards and codes.","Rana, Anber; Perera, Piyaruwan; Ruparathna, Rajeev; Karunathilake, Hirushie; Hewage, Kasun; Alam, M.

642030,Monitoring the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on mental health: a public health challenge? Reflection on Italian data,2020-10-09,"Introduction: Early supported discharge (ESD) is a transitional care model aimed at facilitating post-acute stroke patients' discharge to home. Previous studies have demonstrated that ESD provides equivalent patient and caregiver outcomes with superior cost-effectiveness compared to conventional rehabilitation (CR). This study intends to examine the feasibility of ESD in Korea. Methods and Analysis: This study is designed as a multicenter assessor-blinded, randomized controlled trial. Ninety post-acute stroke patients with mild to moderate disability (modified Rankin Scale 1–3) will be recruited from three university hospitals (30 patients per hospital) in Korea and allocated to either the ESD group or the CR group in a 1:1 ratio. Patients in the ESD group will receive individualized discharge planning and goal setting, a 4-week home-based rehabilitation program, and liaison service to community-based resources by a multidisciplinary team. Patients in the CR group will receive rehabilitation practices according to their current hospital policy. Outcomes: The primary outcome is the Korean version of the modified Barthel Index, and the primary endpoint was post-onset 3 months. Clinical outcomes, patient/caregiver reported outcomes, and socioeconomic outcomes will be measured at baseline, 1 month after discharge, 2 months after discharge, and 3 months after onset. Discussion: The efficacy and cost-effectiveness of ESD can vary according to the healthcare system and sociocultural aspects. To establish ESD as an alternative transitional care model for post-acute stroke patients in Korea, its feasibility needs to be examined in prior. This study will add evidence on the applicability of ESD in Korea. Ethical Considerations: The study protocol was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board of Seoul National University Bundang Hospital (IRB number B-2012/654-308).

This study is a case series of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) admitted to 11 hospitals in Korea. METHODS: Patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection by positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing of respiratory specimens by active surveillance that were finally discharged between February 20 and April 30, 2020 were included. Patients were classified into mild and non-mild groups on initial admission according to oxygen demand and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score, and the mild group was followed up and subgrouped into non-aggravation and aggravation groups. RESULTS: A total of 161 patients with SARS-CoV2 infection were enrolled. Among the mild group of 136 patients, 11.7% of patients experienced clinical aggravation during hospitalization, but there was no initial clinical parameter on admission predicting their aggravation. Fever (odds ratio [OR], 4.56), thrombocytopenia (OR, 12.87), fever (OR, 27.22) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) > 300 U/L (OR, 18.35), and CRP > 1 mg/dL (OR, 11.31) significantly indicated aggravation in the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th 5-day periods, respectively. PCR positivity lasted for a median of 22 days and 32 days after the onset of illness in the non-aggravation and aggravation groups, respectively.

643935,‘Herd stupidity’ as a result of ‘irrational beliefs’: The mental health issues in the COVID-19 outbreak,2021-09-08,"BACKGROUND Asthma diagnostic guidelines require procedures with aerosol generating potential (AGPs) to guide decision-making. Restricted access to AGPs poses significant challenges in primary care and resource-poor countries, further amplified during the COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVE To establish an approach to asthma diagnosis that does not require AGPs. METHOD Symptomatic yet untreated (beyond as-required bronchodilator use) adults with clinician-suspected asthma and maximum 10 pack-year smoking history were recruited. Clinical history, physical examination, spirometry with bronchodilator reversibility, home peak flow monitoring and bronchial challenges were performed, and fractional exhaled nitric oxide and serum eosinophils measured. Tests were then repeated following treatment with inhaled corticosteroids before an asthma diagnosis was confirmed or refuted by an expert panel. RESULTS 65 adults [mean (SD) age: 34.8 (12.2) years] were recruited. Five were excluded as ""unclassifiable"", due to borderline results or missing data. Of the remainder 36 were diagnosed with asthma and 24 were not. Using data from non-AGPs only (wheeze on auscultation and blood eosinophilia) and home peak flow variability, a ""rule-in"" diagnostic model provided comparable discriminative ability to the application of established guidelines. Clinical suspicion of asthma together with at least one positive non-AGP test provided a sensitivity of 55%, specificity 100%, positive predictive value 100% and negative predictive value 60%. Application of this model reduced the need for spirometry-based tests by one-third. CONCLUSION The proposed diagnostic algorithm may be clinically useful in ""ruling-in"" asthma in adults when access to AGPs is limited. This algorithm is not suitable for those with low clinical probability, with a significant smoking history, or where alternative diagnoses are more likely. This pragmatic approach to asthma diagnosis merits prospective validation.","Drake, Sarah; Wang, Ran; Healy, Laura; Roberts, Stephen A; Murray, Clare S; Simpson, Angela; Fowler, Stephen J",The journal of allergy and clinical immunology.

644763,The Sexual and Reproductive Health of Adolescents and Young Adults During the COVID‐19 Pandemic,2020-06-14,"This note provides an early assessment of the reinforced measures to curb the COVID-19 pandemic in France, which include a curfew of selected areas and culminate in a second COVID-19-related lock-down that started on October 30, 2020 and is still ongoing. We analyse the change in virus propagation across age groups and across departements using an acceleration index introduced in Baunez et al. (2020). We find that while the pandemic is still in the acceleration regime, acceleration decreased notably with curfew measures and this more rapidly so for the more vulnerable population group, that is, for people older than 60. Acceleration continued to decline under lock-down, but more so for the active population under 60 than for those above 60. For the youngest population aged 0 to 19, curfew measures did not reduce acceleration but lock-down does. This suggests that if health policies aim at protecting the elderly population generally more at risk to suffer severe consequences from COVID-19, curfew measures may be effective enough. However, looking at the departmental map of France, we find that curfews have not necessarily been imposed in departements where acceleration was the largest.","Baunez, C.; Degoulet, M.; Luchini, S.; Pintus, P.; Teschl, M.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.11.11.20230243v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.11.20230243,387
646768,The Benefits of Self-Transcendence: Examining the Role of Values on Mental Health Among Adolescents Across Regions in China,2021-02-17,"BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19) is potentially severe for individuals with compromised immune systems, including people living with HIV. Along with the direct health threats of COVID-19, there are disruptions to social relationships and health services resulting from mitigation efforts instituted by public health authorities. This study examined the relationship between trust in the government and trust in COVID-19 health information from the US CDC, state health departments, and social media on the experience of COVID-19 social and health services-related disruptions. METHODS: People living with HIV (N = 459) recruited through social media advertisements and chain referrals completed confidential surveys delivered through an online platform. RESULTS: Participants experienced high-levels of disruptions to social relationships and health services attributable to COVID-19 mitigation efforts. We also observed high-rates of inaccurate information and low-levels of trust in government and sources of COVID-19 information. Greater disruptions to social relationships were predicted by more concern about oneself and others contracting COVID-19, whereas disruptions to health services were predicted by greater concern for oneself contracting COVID-19, greater general medical mistrust, and less trust in information from the CDC. CONCLUSIONS: Findings have implications for the necessity of rebuilding public trust in credible sources of health information and stepping up efforts to counter sources of inaccurate information.

The policies adopted by the apparatus of most nation states for the past thirty years or more reveal that providing healthcare to all sections of societies is not a priority. The gradual process of economic liberalization has established “market” as the only legitimate mechanism of the distribution of goods/services as per the efficiency principle. The financial markets are globalized in such a manner that nation states are constantly losing their capacity to perform redistributive functions. State withdrawal from the provision of welfare rights is undermining its moral authority to impose any normative imperative to the people who are being left alone at the mercy of market forces. But the spread of COVID-19 on a global scale has provided an opportunity to the nation state. With the help of healthcare systems, the State has reasserted itself as the ultimate archangel to define human beings and their respective status in the newly emerging nomenclature of the public sphere. In this paper, the rejuvenation of the nation state with respect to bio-power will be discussed in the postcolonial context.","Suri, Abdul Wahab",J Bioeth Inq,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11673-020-10021-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32840845/,387

Endocytosis and endosome acidification inhibitors inhibit infection by CHIKV, murine leukemia virus (MLV), or SARS-coronavirus, indicating that these viral entries into host cells occur through endosomes and require endosome acidification. Although endosomal cathepsin B protease is necessary for MLV, Ebola virus, and SARS-CoV infections, its role in CHIKV infection is unknown. Our results revealed that endocytosis inhibitors attenuated CHIKV-pseudotyped MLV vector infection in 293T cells but not in TE671 cells. In contrast, macropinocytosis inhibitors attenuated CHIKV-pseudotyped MLV vector infection in TE671 cells but not in 293T cells, suggesting that CHIKV host cell entry occurs via endocytosis or macropinocytosis, depending on the cell lines used. Cathepsin B inhibitor and knockdown by an shRNA suppressed CHIKV-pseudotyped MLV vector infection both in 293T and TE671 cells. These results show that cathepsin B facilitates CHIKV infection regardless of the entry pathway.","Izumida, Mai; Hayashi, Hideki; Tanaka, Atsushi; Kubo, Yoshinao",Viruses,https://doi.org/10.3390/v12070722; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32635194/,387

Challenges have included limited testing capacity, short windows of organ viability, brief lead time for notification of potential organ recipients, and the need to test lower respiratory donor specimens to optimize sensitivity. In an early US epicenter of the outbreak, we designed and implemented a system to expedite this testing and here report results from the first three weeks. The process included a Laboratory Medicine designee for communication with organ recovery and transplant clinical staff, specialized sample labeling and handoff, and priority processing. Thirty‐two organs recovered from 14 of 17 screened donors were transplanted versus 70 recovered from 23 donors during the same period in 2019. No pre‐transplant or organ donors tested positive for SARS‐CoV‐2. Median turnaround time from specimen receipt was 6.8h (donors), 6.5h (recipients): 4.5h faster than daily inpatient median. No organ recoveries or transplants were disrupted by a lack of SARS‐CoV‐2 testing. Waitlist inactivations for COVID‐19 precautions were reduced in our region.

It is not known whether COVID-19 is associated with a higher risk of death than residents without COVID-19. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess whether COVID-19 is associated with a higher mortality rate in NH residents, considering frailty status assessed with the Multidimensional Prognostic Index (MPI). METHODS: In this retrospective study, made in 31 NHs in Venice, Italy, the presence of COVID-19 was ascertained with a nasopharyngeal swab. Frailty was evaluated using the MPI, modified according to the tools commonly used in our NHs. A Cox’s regression analysis was used reporting the results as hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), using COVID-19 as exposure and mortality as outcome and stratified by MPI tertiles. Similar analyses were run using MPI tertiles as exposure. RESULTS: Overall, 3946 NH residents (median age = 87 years, females: 73.9%) were eligible, with 1136 COVID-19 + . During a median follow-up of 275 days, higher values of MPI, indicating frailer people, were associated with an increased risk of mortality. The incidence of mortality in COVID-19 + was more than doubled than COVID-19- either in MPI-1, MPI-2 and MPI-3 groups. The presence of COVID-19 increased the risk of death (HR = 1.85; 95% CI 1.59–2.15), also in the propensity score model using MPI as confounder (HR = 2.48; 95% CI 2.10–2.93). CONCLUSION: In this retrospective study of NH residents, COVID-19 was associated with a higher risk of all-cause mortality than those not affected by COVID-19 also considering the different grades of frailty.","Veronese, Nicola; Koyanagi, Ai; Stangherlin, Vanni; Mantoan, Paola; Chiavalin, Marco; Tudor, Florina; Pozzobon, Gianfranco; Tessarin, Michele; Pilotto, Alberto",Aging Clin Exp Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33893989/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s40520-021-01855-6,387

However, limited information is available on virus shedding or viremia in the captive wild felids, especially in Malaysia. Four infectious viruses of cat, feline herpesvirus (FHV), feline calicivirus (FCV), canine distemper virus (CDV), and canine parvovirus (CPV), were screened in leopards, feral cats, and tigers in Malaysia based on virus isolation in Crandell-Rees feline kidney (CRFK) cells, PCR/RT-PCR, and whole-genome sequencing analysis of the positive isolate. From a total of 36 sera collected, 11 samples showed three consecutive cytopathic effects in the cell culture and were subjected to PCR using specific primers for FHV, FCV, CDV, and CPV. Only one sample from a Malayan tiger was detected positive for CPV. The entire viral genome of CPV (UPM-CPV15/P. tigris jacksoni; GenBank Accession number MW380384) was amplified using the Sanger sequencing approach. Genome sequencing of the isolate revealed 99.13, 98.65, and 98.40% close similarity to CPV-31, CPV-d Cornell #320, and CPV-15 strains, respectively, and classified as CPV-2a. Time-scaled Bayesian Maximum Clade Credibility tree for the non-structural (NS) genes of CPV showed a close relationship to the isolates CPV-CN SD6_2014 and KSU7-SD_2004 from China and USA, respectively, while the capsid gene showed the same ancestor as the FPV-BJ04 strain from China. The higher evolution rate of the capsid protein (CP) (VP 1 and VP2) [1.649 × 10(−5) (95% HPD: 7.626 × 10(−3) to 7.440 × 10(−3))] as compared to the NS gene [1.203 × 10(−4) (95% HPD: 6.663 × 10(−3) to 6.593 × 10(−3))] was observed in the CPV from this study, and fairly higher than other parvovirus species from the Protoparvovirus genus.

It is important to understand the reliability of assays with different antigen or antibody targets to detect humoral immunity after SARS-CoV-2 infection and to understand how antibody (Ab) binding assays compare to those detecting neutralizing antibody (nAb), particularly as we move into the era of vaccines. METHODS: We evaluated the performance of six commercially available Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assays (ELISAs), including a surrogate virus neutralization test (sVNT), for detection of SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulins (IgA, IgM, IgG), total or nAb. A result subset was compared to a cell culture-based microneutralisation (MN) assay. We tested sera from patients with prior RT-PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, pre-pandemic sera and potential cross-reactive sera from patients with other non-COVID-19 acute infections. RESULTS: For sera collected > 14 days post-symptom onset, the assay achieving the highest sensitivity was the Wantai total Ab at 100% (95% confidence interval: 94.6-100) followed by 93.1% for Euroimmun NCP-IgG, 93.1% for GenScript sVNT, 90.3% for Euroimmun S1-IgG, 88.9% for Euroimmun S1-IgA and 83.3% for Wantai IgM. Specificity for the best performing assay was 99.5% for the Wantai total Ab and for the lowest performing assay was 97.1% for sVNT (as per IFU). The Wantai Total Ab had the best agreement with MN at 98% followed by Euroimmun S1-IgA, Euro NCP-IgG and sVNT (as per IFU) with (97%, 97% and 95% respectively) and Wantai IgM having the poorest agreement at 93%. CONCLUSION: Performance characteristics of the SARS-CoV-2 serology assays detecting different antibody types are consistent with those found in previously published reports. Evaluation of the surrogate virus neutralization test in comparison to the Ab binding assays and a cell culture-based neutralization assay showed good result correlation between all assays. However correlation between the cell-based neutralization test and some assays detecting Ab’s not specifically involved in neutralization was higher than with the sVNT. This study demonstrates the reliability of different assays to detect the humoral immune response following SARS-CoV-2 infection, which can be used to optimise serological test algorithms for assessing antibody responses post SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccination.","Nicholson, Suellen; Karapanagiotidis, Theo; Khvorov, Arseniy; Douros, Celia; Mordant, Francesca; Bond, Katherine; Druce, Julian; Williamson, Deborah A; Purcell, Damian; Lewin, Sharon R; Sullivan, Sheena; Subbarao, Kanta; Catton, Mike",Open Forum Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34258311/; https://doi.org/10.1093/ofid/ofab239,387

Digital PCR (dPCR) is capable of the absolute quantification of nucleic acids. Method By using the droplet dPCR (QX200) and the digital real-time PCR (LOAA), the copy numbers were compared via multiple assays for three distinct targerts; EGFR DNA, SARS-CoV-2 and HIV-1 RNA. Results The droplet dPCR and digital real-time PCR showed similar copy numbers for both DNA and RNA quantification. When the limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantitation (LOQ) of each method were estimated for DNA and RNA targets, the digital real-time PCR showed a higher sensitivity and precision especially with low copy number targets. Conclusion The breath of nucleic acid testing in diagnostic applications continues to expand. In this study we applied common diagnostic targets to a novel digital real-time PCR methodology. It performed comparably to the established dPCR method with distinctive advantages and disadvantages for implementing in laboratories. These rapidly developing dPCR systems can be applied to benefit the accurate and sensitive nucleic acid testing for various clinical areas.","Lee, Sang-Soo; Park, Jae-Hyeong; Bae, Young-Kyung",Clin Chim Acta,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0009898121002175; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34144041/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0009898121002175?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cca.2021.06.016,387

We determined factors independently associated with computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA)-confirmed pulmonary embolism (PE) in hospitalised severe COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Among all (N=349) patients hospitalised for COVID-19 in a university hospital in a French region with a high rate of COVID-19, we analysed patients who underwent CTPA for clinical signs of severe disease (SpO2≤93% or breathing rate≥30/min); or rapid clinical worsening. Multivariable analysis was performed using Firth penalised maximum likelihood estimates. RESULTS: In total, 162 patients (46.4%) underwent CTPA (mean age 65.6±13.0; 67.3% males (95% confidence interval (CI) 59.5–75.5%)). PE was diagnosed in 44 patients (27.2%). Most PE were segmental and the rate of PE-related right ventricular dysfunction was 15.9%. By multivariable analysis, the only two significant predictors of CTPA-confirmed PE were D-dimer level and the lack of any anticoagulant therapy (odds ratio (OR) 4.0 (95%CI 2.4–6.7) per additional quartile, and OR 4.5 (95%CI 1.1–7.4) respectively). ROC curve analysis identified a D-dimer cut-off value of 2590 ng·mL(−1) to best predict occurrence of PE (AUC: 0.88, p<0.001, sensitivity 83.3%, specificity 83.8%). D-dimer level >2590 ng·mL(−1) was associated with a 17-fold increase in the adjusted risk of PE. CONCLUSION: Elevated D-dimers (>2590 ng·mL(−1)) and absence of anticoagulant therapy predict PE in hospitalised COVID-19 patients with clinical signs of severity. These data strengthen the evidence base in favour of systematic anticoagulation, and suggest wider use of D-dimer guided CTPA to screen for PE in acutely ill hospitalised patients with COVID-19.","Mouhat, Basile; Besutti, Matthieu; Bouiller, Kevin; Grillet, Franck; Monnin, Charles; Ecarnot, Fiona; Behr, Julien; Capellier, Gilles; Soumagne, Thibaud; Pili-Floury, Sébastien; Besch, Guillaume; Mourey, Guillaume; Lepiller, Quentin; Chirouze, Catherine; Schiele, François; Chopard, Romain; Meneveau, Nicolas",Eur Respir J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32907890/; https://doi.org/10.1183/13993003.01811-2020,387

658960,Arrival of Covid-19 vaccine cheers Alaska hospital’s staff,2021-02-18,"A majority of viruses that have caused recent epidemics with high lethality rates in people, are zoonoses originating from wildlife. Among them are filoviruses (e.g., Marburg, Ebola), coronaviruses (e.g., SARS, MERS), henipaviruses (e.g., Hendra, Nipah) which share the common features that they are all RNA viruses, and that a dysregulated immune response is an important contributor to the tissue damage and hence pathogenicity that results from infection in humans. Intriguingly, these viruses also all originate from bat reservoirs. Bats have been shown to have a greater mean viral richness than predicted by their phylogenetic distance from humans, their geographic range, or their presence in urban areas, suggesting other traits must explain why bats harbor a greater number of zoonotic viruses than other mammals. Bats are highly unusual among mammals in other ways as well. Not only are they the only mammals capable of powered flight, they have extraordinarily long life spans, with little detectable increases in mortality or senescence until high ages. Their physiology likely impacted their history of pathogen exposure and necessitated adaptations that may have also affected immune signaling pathways. Do our life history traits make us susceptible to generating damaging immune responses to RNA viruses or does the physiology of bats make them particularly tolerant or resistant? Understanding what immune mechanisms enable bats to coexist with RNA viruses may provide critical fundamental insights into how to achieve greater resilience in humans.","Mandl, Judith N.; Schneider, Caitlin; Schneider, David S.; Baker, Michelle L.",Front Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30294323/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2018.02112,387

659794,Health Café Series: a Potential Platform to Reduce Health Disparities,2020-06-15,"BACKGROUND: Vector-borne diseases (VBDs) such as dengue, chikungunya, and Zika pose a significant challenge to health systems in countries they affect, especially countries with less developed healthcare systems. Therefore, countries are encouraged to work towards more resilient health systems. This qualitative study aims to examine the performance of the health system of the Dutch Caribbean island of Curaҫao regarding the prevention and control of VBDs in the last decade by using the WHO health system building blocks. METHODS: From November 2018 to December 2020, a multi-method qualitative study was performed in Curaçao, applying content analysis of documents (n = 50), five focus group discussions (n = 30), interviews with experts (n = 11) and 15 observation sessions. The study was designed based on the WHO framework: health system building blocks. Two cycles of inductive and deductive coding were employed, and Nvivo software was used to analyse the data. RESULTS: This study’s data highlighted the challenges (e.g. insufficient oversight, coordination, leadership skills, structure and communication) that the departments of the health system of Curaҫao faced during the last three epidemics of VBDs (2010–2020). Furthermore, low levels of collaboration between governmental and non-governmental organisations (e.g. semi-governmental and private laboratories) and insufficient capacity building to improve skills (e.g. entomological, surveillance skills) were also observed. Lastly, we observed how bottlenecks in one building block negatively influenced other building blocks (e.g. inadequate leadership/governance obstructed the workforce's performance). CONCLUSIONS: This study uncovers potential organisational bottlenecks that have affected the performance of the health system of Curaҫao negatively. We recommend starting with the reinforcement of oversight of the integrated vector management programme to ensure the development, implementation and evaluation of related legislation, policies and interventions. Also, we recommend evaluating and reforming the existing administrative and organisational structure of the health system by considering the cultural style, challenges and barriers of the current health system. More efforts are needed to improve the documentation of agreements, recruitment and evaluation of the workforce's performance. Based on our findings, we conceptualised actions to strengthen the health system's building blocks to improve its performance for future outbreaks of infectious diseases.

At the same time, laboratories and institutions are working hard to obtain a COVID-19 vaccine, which we hope will be available soon. However, there has been no assessment of whether an individual and society value ​​a vaccine monetarily, and what factors determine this value. Therefore, the objective of this research was to estimate the individual’s willingness to pay (WTP) for a hypothetical COVID-19 vaccine and, at the same time, find the main factors that determine this valuation. For this, we used the contingent valuation approach, in its single and double-bounded dichotomous choice format, which was based on a hypothetical market for a vaccine. The sample used was obtained through an online survey of n = 566 individuals from Chile. The main results showed that the WTP depends on the preexistence of chronic disease ([Formula: see text]), knowledge of COVID-19 ([Formula: see text]), being sick with COVID-19 ([Formula: see text]), perception of government performance ([Formula: see text]), employment status ([Formula: see text]), income ([Formula: see text]), health care ([Formula: see text]), adaptation to quarantine with children at home ([Formula: see text] and whether the person has recovered from COVID-19 ([Formula: see text]. According to our discrete choice model in double-bounded dichotomous format, it was concluded that the individuals’ WTP is US$184.72 (CI: 165.52-203.92; p < 0.01). This implies a social valuation of approximately US$2,232 million, corresponding to 1.09% of the GNP per capita.","García, Leidy Y.; Cerda, Arcadio A.",Vaccine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2020.06.068; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X20308549?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32620375/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X20308549,387

The effectiveness of TM in this population has not been described. Methods A retrospective cohort study was conducted at the Children's Hospital at Montefiore, Bronx, NY. Electronic health records of all HT pts who received care from 1/3/20-8/31/20 were queried. Data collected included frequency of TM, in person, and emergency room (ER) visits, hospitalizations, immunosuppression (IS) levels requiring adjustment, and out-of-window pt follow-up (f/u). The proportion of IS levels out of range was compared among 4 groups by chi-square analysis. Results During SD there were 54 TM visits: 61% routine and 39% sick. Five (24%) sick TM visits justified an in person f/u: 3 clinic visits, 2 ER visits, 1 required hospitalization (Figure). During the post-SD period 1 when in person visits resumed, 9 pt visits were out of window for routine f/u, median of 6 weeks delayed. IS levels were not therapeutic in 29% of pts pre-SD compared to 46% during post-SD period 1 (p=0.06). There was a difference between post-SD period 1 and 2 (p=0.04). By SD period 2, IS had returned to pre-SD levels (p=0.6) (Table). Conclusion TM can be utilized to stay connected to pts and reduce the need for in person visits when routine in person care is disrupted. The higher percentage of pts with IS levels out of range seen during the immediate post COVID SD period reinforces the importance of routine IS level surveillance. Home IS level monitoring should be considered as a component of TM in this population.","Beddows, K.; Bansal, N.; Abraham, L.; Hsu, D. T.; Lamour, J.

A conceptual model of O(3) air pollution is developed based on the analysis of data obtained at Tung Chung (TC) in Hong Kong. By comparing meteorological parameters between O(3) and non-O(3) episode days, it was found that high temperatures, strong solar radiation, low wind speeds and relative humidity, northeasterly and/or northwesterly prevailing winds were favorable for the O(3) formation, while tropical cyclones were most conducive to the occurrence of O(3) episodes. Backward trajectories simulation and graphical illustration of O(3) pollution suggested that super-regional (i.e. central and eastern China) and regional (i.e. Pearl River Delta, southern China) transport was another factor that contributed to high O(3) levels in Hong Kong. The photochemical O(3) formation, generally VOC-limited in Hong Kong, was controlled by a small number of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Furthermore, the positive matrix factorization (PMF) simulation suggested that solvent usage and vehicular emissions are the major contributors to ambient VOCs in Hong Kong. Finally, this paper presents recommendations for further O(3) research and implementation of O(3) control strategies.","Ling, Z.H.; Guo, H.; Zheng, J.Y.; Louie, P.K.K.; Cheng, H.R.; Jiang, F.; Cheung, K.; Wong, L.C.; Feng, X.Q.",Atmos Environ (1994),https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1352231012009223; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2012.09.051; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1352231012009223; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32362762/,387
661800,Assessing the usability and user engagement of Thought Spot - A digital mental health help-seeking solution for transition-aged youth,2021-03-26,"INTRODUCTION: The need to protect the confidentiality of research data has long been recognized. One means to help protect research data from use in civil or criminal matters in the United States is a Certificate of Confidentiality (CoC). Until recently, investigators applied for a CoC when conducting research that was sensitive, stigmatizing or where the disclosure of private information could possibly result in civil or criminal liability. However, effective October 1, 2017, CoCs are automatically issued for much research supported by the National Institutes of Health (NIH). While automatic issuance reduces administrative burden, it also poses some surprising unanticipated challenges for research in general and pragmatic clinical trials (PCTs) in particular, which are key elements of learning health systems. METHODS: We reviewed the new policy on CoCs to identify and analyze issues related to it that are potentially problematic for PCTs. RESULTS: We identified three relevant issues: (1) whether the EHR may be populated with research data that may be sensitive or stigmatizing without explicit consent from subjects; (2) incomplete protections for sensitive data in the EHR; and (3) requirements for notifying subjects about the CoC provisions. CONCLUSION: Formal guidance from the NIH is needed to address the application of CoCs to the setting of PCTs. In the meantime, it is essential for researchers designing and conducting PCTs, as well as health care systems in which this research is conducted, to be aware of the nuances inherent in CoCs so they can best adhere to their legal obligations regarding them. In the absence of guidance, special attention should be paid to pragmatic research that populates the electronic health record with research data as well as research conducted without explicit consent. Given the large amount of pragmatic research precipitated by the Coronavirus Disease 2019 pandemic, which has been accompanied by major efforts to share data, the need for such guidance is especially urgent.","Sugarman, Jeremy; Carrithers, Judith",Learn Health Syst,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33889738/; https://doi.org/10.1002/lrh2.10238,387

From the perspective of the IPBES’ Conceptual Framework, SACs constitute the “nature” component in the complex system of interactions between human societies and the Andean mountain environment. There are four SAC living species today, two of which are wild, or Salqa, in the indigenous cosmovision: guanaco (Lama guanicoe) and vicuña (Vicugna vicugna). Llama (Lama glama) and alpaca (Vicugna pacos) were domesticated 5000 years ago, and are therefore Uywa, in the indigenous cosmovision. Both wild and domestic camelids were, and in several cases still are, the most highly appreciated resource for Andean livelihoods. Historically, camelids and their contributions have been used by Andean people since the peopling of the Americas over 11,000 years ago. In this paper, we present three case studies (chakus for vicuña management, llama caravans, and llama nanobodies) to bring attention to the essential role of vicuñas and llamas for Andean communities today, their intercultural linkages with the Western world, and telecoupling interactions.","Vilá, Bibiana; Arzamendia, Yanina",Sustain Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33133295/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11625-020-00874-y,387
663791,COVID‐19 pandemic and adolescent health and well‐being in sub‐Saharan Africa: Who cares?,2020-08-27,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) may contribute to delayed presentations of acute myocardial infarction. Delayed presentation with late reperfusion is often associated with an increased risk of mechanical complications and adverse outcomes. Inherent delays are possible as every patient who is acutely sick is being considered a potential case or a career of COVID-19. Also, standardized personal protective equipment precautions are established for all members of the team, regardless of pending COVID-19 testing which might further add to delays. AIM: To compare performance measures and clinical outcomes of all patients who presented to our facility with ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) during the COVID-19 pandemic to same time cohort from 2019. METHODS: All patients who presented to our facility with STEMI during the pandemic were compared to a matched cohort during the same time period in 2019. STEMI with unknown time of symptom onset and inpatient STEMI patients were excluded. Primary outcome was major adverse cardiac events (MACE) in-hospital and up to 14 d after STEMI, including death, myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest, or stroke. Significant differences among groups for continuous variables were tested through ANOVA, using SYSTAT, version 13. Chi-square tests of association were used to compare patient characteristics among groups using SYSTAT. Relative risk scores and associated tests for significance were calculated for discrete variables using MedCalc (MedCalc Software, Ostend, Belgium). RESULTS: There was a significantly longer time interval from symptom onset to first medical contact (FMC) in the COVID-19 group (P < 0.02). Time to first electrocardiogram, door-to-balloon time, and FMC to balloon time were not significantly affected. The right coronary artery was the most common culprit for STEMI in both the cohorts. Over 60% of patients had one or more obstructive (> 50%) lesion(s) remote from the culprit site. In-hospital and 14 d MACE were more prevalent in the COVID-19 group (P < 0.01 and P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: This single academic center study in the United States suggests that there is a delay in patients with STEMI seeking medical attention during the COVID-19 pandemic which could be translating into worse clinical outcomes.","Smith, Megan; Singh, Aniruddha; McElroy, Douglas; Mittal, Shilpi; Pham, Richard",World J Cardiol,https://doi.org/10.4330/wjc.v13.i4.76; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33968306/,387

BACKGROUND: Insomnia is an important factor that can affect the health and work quality of nurses. However, There is a lack of big‐sample studies exploring factors that affect the insomnia of nurses fighting against COVID‐19. METHOD: This cross‐sectional study using the Ascension Insomnia Scale, Fatigue Scale‐14, and Perceived Stress Scale took place in March 2020. Participants were 1,794 frontline nurses from four tertiary‐level general hospitals. RESULTS: The prevalence of insomnia among participants was 52.8%. Insomnia was predicted by gender, working experience, chronic diseases, midday nap duration, direct participation in rescue of patients with COVID‐19, frequency of night shifts, professional psychological assistance during the pandemic, negative experiences (such as family, friends, or colleagues being seriously ill or dying due to COVID‐19), the degree of fear of COVID‐19, fatigue, and perceived stress. CONCLUSION: The level of insomnia among participants was higher than the normal level. Interventions based on influencing factors should be implemented to ensure nurses’ sleep quality. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT: An in‐depth understanding of the influencing factors of insomnia among frontline nurses can help nurse managers develop solutions to improve frontline nurses’ sleep quality, which will enhance the physical and mental conditions of nurses and promote the quality of care.","Zhan, Yuxin; Liu, Yunfang; Liu, Huan; Li, Mei; Shen, Yue; Gui, Lingli; Zhang, Jun; Luo, Zhihua; Tao, Xiubin; Yu, Jiaohua",J Nurs Manag,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32657449/; https://doi.org/10.1111/jonm.13094,387

The molecular mechanisms regulating emerging coronavirus pathogenesis are complex and include virus–host interactions associated with entry, replication, egress and innate immune control. Epigenetics research investigates the genetic and non-genetic factors that regulate phenotypic variation, usually caused by external and environmental factors that alter host expression patterns and performance without any change in the underlying genotype. Epigenetic modifications, such as histone modifications, DNA methylation, chromatin remodeling, and non-coding RNAs, function as important regulators that remodel host chromatin, altering host expression patterns and networks in a highly flexible manner. For most of the past two and a half decades, research has focused on the molecular mechanisms by which RNA viruses antagonize the signaling and sensing components that regulate induction of the host innate immune and antiviral defense programs upon infection. More recently, a growing body of evidence supports the hypothesis that viruses, even lytic RNA viruses that replicate in the cytoplasm, have developed intricate, highly evolved, and well-coordinated processes that are designed to regulate the host epigenome, and control host innate immune antiviral defense processes, thereby promoting robust virus replication and pathogenesis. In this article, we discuss the strategies that are used to evaluate the mechanisms by which viruses regulate the host epigenome, especially focusing on highly pathogenic respiratory RNA virus infections as a model. By combining measures of epigenome reorganization with RNA and proteomic datasets, we articulate a spatial-temporal data integration approach to identify regulatory genomic clusters and regions that play a crucial role in the host’s innate immune response, thereby defining a new viral antagonism mechanism following emerging coronavirus infection.","Schäfer, Alexandra; Baric, Ralph S.",Pathogens,https://doi.org/10.3390/pathogens6010008; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28212305/,387

Intervening quickly can minimize the negative effects of deconditioning. Telerehabilitation is a strategy that increases access to rehabilitation, improves clinical outcomes, and reduces costs. This paper presents the protocol for a pragmatic clinical trial that aims to determine the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a multi-component intervention offered by telerehabilitation for discharged older adults awaiting physical therapy for any specific medical condition. METHODS: This is a pragmatic randomized controlled clinical trial with two groups: telerehabilitation and control. Participants (n=230) will be recruited among individuals discharged from hospitals who are in the public healthcare system physical therapy waiting lists. The telerehabilitation group will receive a smartphone app with a personalized program (based on individual’s functional ability) of resistance, balance, and daily activity training exercises. The intervention will be implemented at the individuals’ homes. This group will be monitored weekly by phone and monthly through a face-to-face meeting until they start physical therapy. The control group will adhere to the public healthcare system’s usual flow and will be monitored weekly by telephone until they start physical therapy. The primary outcome will be a physical function (Timed Up and Go and 30-s Chair Stand Test). The measurements will take place in baseline, start, and discharge of outpatient physical therapy. The economic evaluations will be performed from the perspective of society and the Brazilian public healthcare system. DISCUSSION: The study will produce evidence on the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of multi-component telerehabilitation intervention for discharged older adult patients awaiting physical therapy, providing input that can aid the implementation of similar proposals in other patient groups.

666568,The Perfect Storm: COVID-19 Health Disparities in US Blacks,2020-09-23,"BACKGROUND: Teaching medical ethics (ME) in the clinical environment is often difficult, uncalibrated and medical students get variable exposure to skilled educators. Explicit discussion of ethical dimensions of patient management is often neglected, as clinical teachers may feel inadequately skilled to do this. METHODS: We developed a suite of online modules. Each consisted of a clinical scenario filmed using virtual reality (VR) technology, linked to an adaptive, interactive, online tutorial which explicitly discussed the relevant ethical issues and guidelines. These were embedded in clinical placements of students to encourage the transfer of knowledge from these modules to clinical skill competency. We conducted a pilot study to evaluate these modules which examined student engagement, knowledge gains (self-perceived and measured) and user experience. We also reviewed reflections to assess the incorporation of these modules and transfer of knowledge into the clinical learning and skill development of the students. RESULTS: Engagement and self-perceived knowledge gains were extremely high. Students found these modules realistic, interesting and helpful. The measured knowledge gains (module exit quiz) were moderate. User experience was positive overall, although students were intolerant of any technical glitches. There was mixed feedback on whether the VR aspect of the clinical scenarios added value. Student reflections showed high level incorporation of these modules into clinical practice of the students and evidence of knowledge transfer (level 3 Kirkpatrick model of evaluation) in over ¾ of students. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that the use VR clinical scenarios combined with interactive online learning modules resulted in demonstrable high-level student engagement and learning gains in medical ethics and transfer of knowledge to clinical application. It standardised and ensured the student experience of high-quality educational deliverables in clinical years of medical education. This use of VR and online technology can be adapted for use in many areas of the medical curricula where we need to ensure the delivery of well calibrated, high quality, educational deliverables at scale for students.","Torda, Adrienne",BMC Med Educ,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12909-020-02217-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32967692/,387

Here we report the generation and the preclinical evaluation of a novel replication-defective gorilla adenovirus-vectored vaccine encoding the pre-fusion stabilized Spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV2. We show that our vaccine candidate, GRAd-COV2, is highly immunogenic both in mice and macaques, eliciting both functional antibodies which neutralize SARS-CoV-2 infection and block Spike protein binding to the ACE2 receptor, and a robust, Th1-dominated cellular response. We show here that the pre-fusion stabilized Spike antigen is superior to the wild type in inducing ACE2-interfering, SARS-CoV2 neutralizing antibodies. To face the unprecedented need for vaccine manufacturing at massive scale, different GRAd genome deletions were compared to select the vector backbone showing the highest productivity in stirred tank bioreactors.

Seventy-four patients were enrolled (44 men and 30 women, average age 68.6). All of them were screened with lower limb ultrasound. Laboratory analyses including D-dimers were tested the same day. In case of clinical suspicion of pulmonary embolism, they performed a CT pulmonary angiography. A total of 28.4% (21 patients) were diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism. This finding confirms that these patients were at increased risk of venous thromboembolism, as already reported from other studies. Mechanical ventilation, higher d-dimer levels, longer length of hospitalization and admission to intensive care unit showed to be statistically associated with thromboembolic events. In addition, the study showed that an intermediate or high dose of anticoagulation did not decrease the risk of thromboembolic events compared to lower doses. On the other hand, six patients reported severe bleeding that could be caused by higher doses of anticoagulant drugs. ABSTRACT: The purpose of this study is to assess thrombotic risk in CoViD-19/pneumonia patients with acute respiratory failure and to compare populations treated with three different antithrombotic prophylaxis protocols. The primary outcome is to analyze the prevalence of thrombotic events in hospitalized patients, while the secondary outcome is to analyze the correlation between different anticoagulation targets with thrombotic events. All patients referred to our hospital for acute respiratory failure due to COVID-19 pneumonia between 18 and 31 May 2020 were included. Seventy-four patients were enrolled (44 men and 30 women, average age 68.6). Diagnosis of venous thromboembolism was made in 21 cases (28.4%) and thrombotic events were associated with positive pressure ventilation support (p = 0.024) and hospitalization in ICU (p < 0.0001). These patients presented higher levels of D-dimer (p < 0.0001) and their hospital length of stay was >16 days longer. Forty-seven out of 74 patients (63.5%) received intermediate or therapeutic dose of anticoagulation, while twenty-seven patients (34.5%) received standard antithrombotic prophylaxis. The analysis showed that an intermediate or therapeutic dose of anticoagulation did not decrease the prevalence of thrombotic events. On the other hand, six patients reported severe hemorrhagic complications. Despite intermediate or therapeutic-dose of anticoagulation, a high number of patients with acute respiratory failure secondary to COVID-19 developed thrombotic complications.","Longhitano, Yaroslava; Racca, Fabrizio; Zanza, Christian; Muncinelli, Marina; Guagliano, Alberto; Peretti, Elisa; Minerba, Anna Chiara; Mari, Marta; Boverio, Riccardo; Salio, Mario; Chichino, Guido; Franceschi, Francesco; Piccioni, Andrea; Abenavoli, Ludovico; Salvini, Mauro; Artico, Marco",Biology (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32987902/; https://doi.org/10.3390/biology9100310,387

When vaccines were available to protect the population against the major epidemics, then chronic, recurrent, or persistent infections came into focus. Viruses are everywhere and all organisms are permanently exposed to them. The result of this contact depends on the particular moment a t which a given cell is exposed to the virus. Rubella, for example, provokes a very benign disease in adults, but can induce abnormalities in the differentiating fetus. Although interferon is active against virus aggression, excess interferon has a toxic effect and can block differentiation. The capacity of several viruses to act as cellular mutagens by modifying chromosomes is well established, whatever the molecular mechanism may be. Mutations at the cellular level were carefully analyzed for their tumorigenic potential.","Huppert, J.; Wild, T.

An increasing number of patients with ARDS related to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) required prone positioning, which posed a challenge to the intensive care unit (ICU) staff at Brigham and Women’s Hospital. METHODS (CASE DESCRIPTION): A prone team service of physical therapists and occupational therapists with critical care experience was established to assist with increasing demands for prone positioning of patients who were mechanically ventilated. The goals of the rehabilitation-based prone team were to provide support to nursing and respiratory therapy; create a consistent, efficient process; and ensure patient and staff safety. RESULTS: The service evolved over 7 weeks, expanding to 24-hour coverage and adding responsibilities to support the staff as patient volume grew. Volume of requests to the rehabilitation-based prone team generally increased to week 4 and has since then declined. Key points for successful implementation included identification of rehabilitation therapists with ICU experience and leadership qualities, multidisciplinary collaboration, availability of needed positioning devices and supplies to protect the integument, and well-defined roles of all disciplines participating in position change process. CONCLUSION: The description of the development, operations, evolution, and utilization of a rehabilitation therapist prone team acts as a guide for future development and implementation. IMPACT: This case report is one of the first reports of a rehabilitation-based prone team established to assist with positioning patients in prone as an intervention for ARDS related to COVID-19 and will help guide other institutions.","Ng, Jillian A; Miccile, Lauren A; Iracheta, Christine; Berndt, Carolyn; Detwiller, Meredith; Yuse, Carolyn; Tolland, Joseph",Phys Ther,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32691056/; https://doi.org/10.1093/ptj/pzaa124,387
670878,The Crisis of Perinatal Mental Health in the Age of Covid-19,2021-02-04,"Heart failure exhibits remarkable pathophysiologic heterogeneity. A large body of evidence suggests that regardless of the underlying etiology, heart failure is associated with induction of cytokines and chemokines that may contribute to the pathogenesis of adverse remodeling, and systolic and diastolic dysfunction. The pro-inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-1, and IL-6 have been extensively implicated in the pathogenesis of heart failure. Inflammatory cytokines modulate phenotype and function of all myocardial cells, suppressing contractile function in cardiomyocytes, inducing inflammatory activation in macrophages, stimulating microvascular inflammation and dysfunction, and promoting a matrix-degrading phenotype in fibroblasts. Moreover, cytokine-induced growth factor synthesis may exert chronic fibrogenic actions contributing to the pathogenesis of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). In addition to their role in adverse cardiac remodeling, some inflammatory cytokines may also exert protective actions on cardiomyocytes under conditions of stress. Chemokines, such as CCL2, are also upregulated in failing hearts and may stimulate recruitment of pro-inflammatory leukocytes, promoting myocardial injury, fibrotic remodeling, and dysfunction. Although experimental evidence suggests that cytokine and chemokine targeting may hold therapeutic promise in heart failure, clinical translation remains challenging. This review manuscript summarizes our knowledge on the role of TNF-α, IL-1, IL-6, and CCL2 in the pathogenesis of heart failure, and discusses the promises and challenges of targeted anti-cytokine therapy. Dissection of protective and maladaptive cellular actions of cytokines in the failing heart, and identification of patient subsets with overactive or dysregulated myocardial inflammatory responses are required for design of successful therapeutic approaches.","Hanna, Anis; Frangogiannis, Nikolaos G.",Cardiovasc Drugs Ther,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32902739/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10557-020-07071-0,387

The present paper proposes that existential positive psychology (PP 2.0) represents a promising approach to meet the rising needs in palliative care. This framework has a twofold emphasis on (a) how to transcend and transform suffering as the foundation for wellbeing and (b) how to cultivate our spiritual and existential capabilities to achieve personal growth and flourishing. We propose that these objectives can be achieved simultaneously through dialectical palliative counselling, as illustrated by Wong’s integrative meaning therapy and the Conceptual Model of CALM Therapy in palliative care. We then outline the treatment objectives and the intervention strategies of IMT in providing palliative counselling for palliative care and hospice patients. Based on our review of recent literature, as well as our own research and practice, we discover that existential suffering in general and at the last stage of life in particular is indeed the foundation for healing and wellbeing as hypothesized by PP 2.0. We can also conclude that best palliative care is holistic—in addition to cultivating the inner spiritual resources of patients, it needs to be supported by the family, staff, and community, as symbolized by the healing wheel.","Wong, Paul T.

The main outcomes are quick resolution of symptoms, no deterioration in any of the cases and safe treatment for patients with multiple comorbidities. There was no observed mortality. There were no adverse events due to the Ayurvedic medications. The treatment was undertaken in an out-patient setting and at a low cost. The efficacy and safety of the treatment, and the quick resolution of symptoms are demonstrated. This shows that if COVID-19 patients are treated with Ayurvedic medicines early in the course of COVID-SARS-2 infection, Ayurveda has the potential to prevent progression and deterioration of the disease, with decreased morbidity and mortality.","Girija, P.L.T.; Sivan, Nithya; Agalya Murugavel, Yamini; Naik, Pallavi; Mukundan, T.M.; Duraikannan, Monica",J Ayurveda Integr Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34054248/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0975947621000711?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0975947621000711; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaim.2021.04.015,387

The 2003 SARS epidemic marked a new chapter in disease modelling in Canada as it triggered a national discussion on the utility and uptake of modelling research in local and pandemic outbreaks. However, integration and application of model-based outcomes in public health requires knowledge translation and contextualization. We reviewed the history and performance of Pan-InfORM (Pandemic Influenza Outbreak Research Modelling), which created a national infrastructure in Canada with a mandate to develop innovative knowledge translation methodologies to inform policy makers through modelling frameworks that bridge the gaps between theory, policy, and practice. This review demonstrates the importance of a collaborative infrastructure as a “Community of Practice” to guide public health responses, especially in the context of emerging diseases with substantial uncertainty, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Dedicated resources to modelling and knowledge translation activities can help create synergistic strategies at the global scale and optimize public health responses to protect at-risk populations and quell socioeconomic and health burden.","Tariq, Mehreen; Haworth-Brockman, Margaret; Moghadas, Seyed M",AIMS Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34017890/; https://doi.org/10.3934/publichealth.2021020,387

The pathological study, follow by the immunohistochemical exam and the FISH concluded in an amplification of MDM2 (Murine double minute 2) confirming the presence of a liposarcoma. DISCUSSION: The primary bone localization of liposarcomas remains rare. Their localization at the level of the fibular head is exceptional. The proximal fibula is mainly affected by benign tumors, in particular giant cell. Malignant tumors localized to the head of the fibula as well as aggressive benign tumors most often require en bloc resection.

673945,Evaluation of a risk assessment model to predict infection with healthcare facility–onset Clostridioides difficile,2021-05-06,"COVID-19 pandemic has started in December 2019 in China and quickly extended to become a worldwide health and economic emergency issue. It is caused by the novel coronavirus; SARS-CoV-2. COVID-19 patients’ clinical presentations vary from asymptomatic infection or flu like symptoms to serious pneumonia which could be associated with multiple organ failure possibly leading to death. It is understood that the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 includes all elements of the immune system which could altogether succeed in viral elimination and complete cure. Meanwhile, this immune response may also lead to disease progression and could be responsible for the patient’s death. Many trials have been done recently to create therapies and vaccines against human coronavirus infections such as MERS or SARS, however, till now, there is some controversy about the effectiveness and safety of antiviral drugs and vaccines which have been developed to treat and prevent this disease and its management depends mainly on supportive care. The spike glycoprotein or protein S of SARS-CoV-2 is the main promoter that induces development of neutralizing antibodies; hence, many attempts of vaccines and antiviral drugs development have been designed to be directed specifically against this protein. While some of these attempts have been proved to be efficient in in vitro settings, only few of them have been proceeded to randomized animal trials and human studies which makes COVID-19 prevention an ongoing challenge. This review describes the natural immune response scenario during COVID-19 and the vaccines development trials to create efficient vaccines thus helping to build more effective approaches for prophylaxis and management.","Mohammad, Mai H.S.",Int Immunopharmacol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33571745/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567576921000758?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1567576921000758; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.intimp.2021.107439,387
678112,"Needs, gaps and opportunities for standard and e-mental health care among at-risk populations in the Asia Pacific in the context of COVID-19: a rapid scoping review",2021-07-12,"BACKGROUND: The conventional clinical trial design in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and AD-related disorders (ADRDs) is the parallel-group randomized controlled trial. However, in heterogeneous disorders like AD/ADRDs, this design requires large sample sizes to detect meaningful effects in an “average” patient. They are very costly and, despite many attempts, have not yielded new treatments for many years. An alternative, the multi-crossover, randomized control trial (MCRCT) is a design in which each patient serves as their own control across successive, randomized blocks of active treatment and placebo. This design overcomes many limitations of parallel-group trials, yielding an unbiased assessment of treatment effect at the individual level (“N-of-1”) regardless of unique patient characteristics. The goal of the present study is to pilot a MCRCT of a potential symptomatic treatment, methylphenidate, for mild-stage AD/ADRDs, testing feasibility and compliance of participants in this design and efficacy of the drug using both standard and novel outcome measures suited for this design. METHODS: Ten participants with mild cognitive impairment or mild-stage dementia due to AD/ADRDs will undergo a 4-week lead-in period followed by three, month-long treatment blocks (2 weeks of treatment with methylphenidate, 2 weeks placebo in random order). This trial will be conducted entirely virtually with an optional in-person screening visit. The primary outcome of interest is feasibility as measured by compliance and retention, with secondary and exploratory outcomes including cognition as measured by neuropsychological assessment at the end of each treatment period and daily brain games played throughout the study, actigraphy, and neuropsychiatric and functional assessments. DISCUSSION: This pilot study will gauge the feasibility of conducting a virtual MCRCT for symptomatic treatment in early AD/ADRD. It will also compare home-based daily brain games with standard neuropsychological measures within a clinical trial for AD/ADRD. Particular attention will be paid to compliance, tolerability of drug and participation, learning effects, trends and stability of daily measures across blocks, medication carryover effects, and correlations between standard and brief daily assessments. These data will provide guidance for more efficient trial design and the use of potentially more robust, ecological outcome measures in AD/ADRD research.

We comprehensively characterized transcriptomic profiles, cytokine responses, neutralization capacity of antibodies, and cellular immune phenotypes of asymptomatic patients with acute SARS‐CoV‐2 infection to identify potential protective mechanisms. Compared to symptomatic patients, asymptomatic patients had higher counts of mature neutrophils and lower proportion of CD169(+) expressing monocytes in the peripheral blood. Systemic levels of pro‐inflammatory cytokines were also lower in asymptomatic patients, accompanied by milder pro‐inflammatory gene signatures. Mechanistically, a more robust systemic Th2 cell signature with a higher level of virus‐specific Th17 cells and a weaker yet sufficient neutralizing antibody profile against SARS‐CoV‐2 was observed in asymptomatic patients. In addition, asymptomatic COVID‐19 patients had higher systemic levels of growth factors that are associated with cellular repair. Together, the data suggest that asymptomatic patients mount less pro‐inflammatory and more protective immune responses against SARS‐CoV‐2 indicative of disease tolerance.

To date, no specific treatment strategy was approved for the prevention or treatment of COVID-19 in terms of endotheliitis-related comorbidities. Here, we presented our treatment strategies for 11 190 COVID-19 patients depending on categorisation by the severity of both the respiratory and vascular distress and presented the manifestations of endotheliitis in skin, lung and brain tissues according to the different phases of COVID-19. METHODS: After a retrospective examination, patients were divided into three groups according to their repercussions of vascular distress, which were represented by radiological, histopathological and clinical findings. We presented the characteristics and courses of seven representative and complicated cases which demonstrate different phases of the disease and discussed the treatment strategies in each group. RESULTS: Among 11 190 patients, 9294 patients met the criteria for Group A, and 1376 patients were presented to our clinics with Group B characteristics. Among these patients, 1896 individuals (Group B and Group C) were hospitalised. While 1220 inpatients were hospitalised within the first 10 days after the diagnosis, 676 of them were worsened and hospitalised 10 days after their diagnosis. Among hospitalised patients, 520 of them did not respond to group A and B treatments and developed hypoxemic respiratory failure (Group C) and 146 individuals needed ventilator support and were followed in the intensive care unit, and 43 (2.2%) patients died. CONCLUSION: Distinctive manifestations in each COVID-19 patient, including non-respiratory conditions in the acute phase and the emerging risk of long-lasting complications, suggest that COVID-19 has endotheliitis-centred thrombo-inflammatory pathophysiology.

Frontline health care workers are faced with imminent risks of getting infected. In this study, we formulate a theoretical model to calculate the risk of being infected in health care facilities considering the following factors: the average number of encounters with a suspected COVID-19 patient per hour; interaction time for each encounter; work shift duration or exposure time; crowd density, which may depend on the amount of space available in a given location; and availability and effectiveness of protective gears and facilities provided for the frontline health care workers. Based on the simulation results, we recommend the following: (i) decrease the rate of patient encounter per frontline health care worker, e.g., maximum of three encounters per hour in a 12-hour work shift duration; (ii) decrease the interaction time between the frontline health care worker and the patients, e.g., less than 40 minutes for the whole day; (iii) increase the clean and safe space for social distancing, e.g., maximum of 10% crowd density, and if possible, implement compartmentalization of patients; and/or (iv) provide effective protective gears and facilities, e.g., 95% effective, that the frontline health care workers can use during their shift. Moreover, the formulated model can be used for other similar scenarios, such as identifying infection risk in public transportation, school classroom settings, offices, and mass gatherings.","Dy, Louie Florendo; Rabajante, Jomar Fajardo",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.27.20045336,387

We aimed to investigate the prevalence of depressive symptoms, their association with study-relevant problems, and the moderating effect of parent-child relationship among Chinese adolescents during the school closures. METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional analysis with data collected in middle and high schools in Taizhou, China. Students completed an online survey between April 16 and May 14, 2020. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the Children’s Depression Inventory. Three types of study problems were recorded, including having difficulty in studying at home, dislike of remote learning, and excessive screen entertainment time. Parental relationships were categorized into good or normal relationship and poor relationship. Linear regression and logistic regression analyses were conducted to investigate the associations between study-relevant problems and depressive symptoms. RESULTS: Using data from 6435 adolescents, we found that the prevalence of depressive symptoms was 17.7%. All the study problem measures were associated with more severe depressive symptoms. There was a moderating effect of the parental relationship on the associations between study problems and depressive symptoms. The association between number of study problems and depressive symptoms was stronger in adolescents with a poor parent-child relationship (regression coefficient 4.34 [95% CI 2.97, 5.72]) than those with a good or normal relationship (2.55 [2.35, 2.75]), p for interaction 0.002, on multivariable adjustment. CONCLUSIONS: Study problems due to school closures were particularly problematic for adolescents who had poor parent-child relationships.

One possible mechanism is differential immunological and neuroendocrine responses to traumatic stress exposure. In the current prospective study, we aimed to identify whether sex is indirectly associated with the probability of developing nonremitting PTSD through pro-inflammatory markers and whether steroid hormone concentrations influence this effect. Female (n = 179) and male (n = 197) trauma survivors were recruited from an emergency department and completed clinical assessment within 24 h and blood samples within ∼three hours of trauma exposure. Pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-1 [Formula: see text] , TNF, IFNγ), and steroid hormone (estradiol, testosterone, progesterone, cortisol) concentrations were quantified in plasma. Compared to men, women had a higher probability of developing nonremitting PTSD after trauma (p = 0.04), had lower pro-inflammatory cytokines and testosterone (p’s<0.001), and had higher cortisol and progesterone (p’s<0.001) concentrations. Estradiol concentrations were not different between the sexes (p = 0.24). Pro-inflammatory cytokines were a significant mediator in the relationship between sex and probability of developing nonremitting PTSD (p < 0.05), such that men had higher concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines which were associated with lower risk of nonremitting PTSD development. This effect was significantly moderated by estradiol (p < 0.05), as higher estradiol levels in men were associated with higher pro-inflammatory cytokine concentrations and lower risk for developing nonremitting PTSD. The current results suggest that sex differences in the pro-inflammatory cytokine response to trauma exposure partially mediate the probability of developing nonremitting PTSD, and that the protective ability to mount an pro-inflammatory cytokine response in men may depend on higher estradiol levels in the aftermath of trauma exposure.","Lalonde, Chloe S.; Mekawi, Yara; Ethun, Kelly F.; Beurel, Eleonore; Gould, Felicia; Dhabhar, Firdaus S.; Schultebraucks, Katharina; Galatzer-Levy, Isaac; Maples-Keller, Jessica L.; Rothbaum, Barbara O.; Ressler, Kerry J.; Nemeroff, Charles B.; Stevens, Jennifer S.; Michopoulos, Vasiliki",Chronic Stress (Thousand Oaks),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34595364/; https://doi.org/10.1177/24705470211032208,387

The Th17 cytokine profile was evaluated in a pilot study of respiratory virus infections. METHODS: Consecutive patients with symptoms of respiratory tract infection visiting the emergency department of a tertiary care hospital during the winter influenza season of 2014 to 2015 were evaluated. CLART PneumoVir kit, (GENOMICA, Madrid, Spain) was used for viral detection of all known respiratory viruses. Th17 cytokine profile was evaluated with the MILLIPLEX MAP Human TH17 Magnetic Bead Panel (Millipore Corp., Billerica, MA). Correlation of the TH17 profile with viral detection was performed with univariate and multivariate analysis. RESULTS: Seventy‐six patients were evaluated (median age 56 years, 51.3% female); a respiratory virus was identified in 60 (78.9%) patients; 45% had confirmed influenza. Influenza A (H3N2) correlated with higher levels of granulocyte‐macrophage colony‐stimulating factor (GM‐CSF), interleukin 1β (IL‐1β), IL‐17A, IL‐17E, IL‐17F, IL‐21, IL‐22, and IL‐23 (P < 0.05 by analysis of variance [ANOVA]) compared with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).

685905,Talking With white Clients About Race,2021-05-02,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Coronavirus disease 2019 (CO­VID-19) infection is an ongoing pandemic and worldwide health emergency that has caused important changes in healthcare systems. Previous studies reported an increased risk of thromboembolic events, including stroke. This systematic review aims to describe the clinical features and etiological characteristics of ischemic stroke patients with CO­VID-19 infection. METHOD: A literature search was performed in principal databases for studies and case reports containing data concerning risk factors, clinical features, and etiological characteristics of patients infected with COVID-19 and suffering from stroke. Descriptive and analytical statistics were applied. RESULTS: Overall, 14 articles were included for a total of 93 patients. Median age was 65 (IQR: 55–75) years with prevalence in males. Stroke occurred after a median of 6 days from COVID-19 infection diagnosis. Median National of Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score was 19. Cryptogenic (Cry) strokes were more frequent (51.8%), followed by cardioembolic etiology, and they occurred a long time after COVID-19 diagnosis compared with large-artery atherosclerosis strokes (ptrend: 0.03). The clinical severity of stroke was significantly associated with the severity grade of COVID-19 infection (ptrend: 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Ischemic strokes in COVID-19-infected patients were clinically severe, affecting younger patients mainly with Cry and cardioembolic etiologies. Further multicenter prospective registries are needed to better describe the causal association and the effect of COVID-19 infection on stroke.","Vidale, Simone",Cerebrovasc Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33774622/; https://doi.org/10.1159/000514267,387

686853,Threats to Global Mental Health From Unregulated Digital Phenotyping and Neuromarketing: Recommendations for COVID-19 Era and Beyond,2021-09-14,"Various imidazole-containing compounds have been tested for their medical usefulness in clinical trials for several disease conditions. The rapid expansion of imidazole-based medicinal chemistry suggests the promising and potential therapeutic values of imidazole-derived compounds for treating incurable diseases. Imidazole core scaffold contains three carbon atoms, and two nitrogen with electronic-rich characteristics that are responsible for readily binding with a variety of enzymes, proteins, and receptors compared to the other heterocyclic rings. Herein, we provide a thorough overview of the current research status of imidazole-based compounds with a wide variety of biological activities including anti-cancer, anti-microbial, anti-inflammatory and their potential mechanisms including topoisomerase IIR catalytic inhibition, focal adhesion kinase (FAK) inhibition, c-MYC G-quadruplex DNA stabilization, and aurora kinase inhibition. Additionally, a great interest was reported in the discovery of novel imidazole compounds with anti-microbial properties that break DNA double-strand helix and inhibit protein kinase. Moreover, anti-inflammatory mechanisms of imidazole derivatives include inhibition of COX-2 enzyme, inhibit neutrophils degranulation, and generation of reactive oxygen species. This systemic review helps to design and discover more potent and efficacious imidazole compounds based on the reported derivatives, their ADME profiles, and bioavailability scores that together aid to advance this class of compounds.","Alghamdi, Sahar S; Suliman, Rasha S; Almutairi, Khlood; Kahtani, Khawla; Aljatli, Dimah",Drug Des Devel Ther,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34354342/; https://doi.org/10.2147/dddt.s307113,387
687886,Understanding and Accommodating Patient and Staff Choice When Implementing Video Consultations in Mental Health Services,2021,"There is a growing debate on the role of the physical environment and what constitute risk and protective factors for mental health. Various forms of air pollution have shown links to physical and mental health concerns and considering that Germany does not meet the WHO air quality standards—poor air quality affects a large proportion of Germans and is more important now than ever. This study investigates the physical environmental factor, air pollution, measured by particulate matter of particles with an aerodynamic diameter smaller than 10 µm (PM(10)) and effects on determinants of mental health and well-being (life satisfaction, stress resilience, anxiety, depression, and self-esteem). A representative sample of N = 3020 German adults with 54% females (46% males) and an age range between 18 and 92 years (M = 49.04, S.D. ± 17.27) was used. Multivariate linear regression analyses show that higher life satisfaction, more self-esteem and higher stress resilience are predicted by less air pollution (PM(10)). Individual income, age, and gender were taken into account for each regression model. Gender specific sub-analyses revealed similar predictions for PM(10) and stress resilience whereas PM(10) and self-esteem were only significantly associated for females. Associations between mental health or well-being determinants and air pollution (PM(10)) are found in the representative German sample.","Petrowski, Katja; Bührer, Stefan; Strauß, Bernhard; Decker, Oliver; Brähler, Elmar",Sci Rep,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-93773-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34531408/,387

There are signs that the public is also experiencing psychological trauma as they attempt to navigate their way through the COVID-19 restrictions impinging on many aspects of society. With unprecedented demand for health professionals' time, people who are unable to access face-to-face assistance are turning to smartphone apps to help them deal with symptoms of trauma. However, the evidence for smartphone apps to treat trauma is limited, and clinicians need to be aware of the limitations and unresolved issues involved in using mental health apps.","Marshall, Jamie M.; Dunstan, Debra A.; Bartik, Warren",Front Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33014955/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2020.00402,387
688524,Issues relevant to mental health promotion in frontline health care providers managing quarantined/isolated COVID19 patients,2020-04-07,"BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to determine the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the total testing process using six sigma metrics based on a comparison of pre and during pandemic periods. MATERIAL & METHODS: The study duration was over 12 months, 6 months before and 6 months after the COVID-19 onset in Pakistan in March 2020 after the recognition of the first case, using quality indicators (QIs). QIs were chosen from a model of QIs recommended by the CAP. Analysis was performed using Six Sigma calculators and QIs were expressed in percentage (%) and Sigma value were computed. Three levels of performance quality i.e. 25th, 50th, and 75th percentile were derived, being best, common and worst performance respectively. Between-group differences were tested using the Mann-Whitney's U test. RESULTS: The median defect percentages of these QIs ranged from 0% to 0.27% for the pre-pandemic period and 0% to 0.13% for the during pandemic period. Meanwhile, sigma values of the majority of the QIs were all above 4.0σ during the pre and the pandemic times. For the pre-analytical phase, sigma scores declined for 1 QI, improved for 3 QIs and remained same for 2. In the post analytical phase, no change in sigma metrics was noted for critical values notification. Considerable increase in defect percentage of inappropriate turnaround times was noted. CONCLUSION: The emergency preparedness proved to be fruitful as depicted by exceptional performance on the sigma metrics for most Qis both prior to and during the pandemic. The pre-analytical and the post analytical phases, being the most error sensitive requires strict vigilance.","Ahmed, Sibtain; Jahan, Farhat; Naeem Effendi, Muhammad Umer; Ghani, Farooq",Ann Med Surg (Lond),https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amsu.2021.102842; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2049080121007925; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34518783/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2049080121007925?v=s5,387
688926,Implications of respiratory pathogen transmission dynamics on prevention and testing,2020-05-07,"The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the emergent SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus threatens global public health and there is an urgent need to develop safe and effective vaccines. Here we report the generation and the preclinical evaluation of a novel replication-defective gorilla adenovirus-vectored vaccine encoding the pre-fusion stabilized Spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV2. We show that our vaccine candidate, GRAd- COV2, is highly immunogenic both in mice and macaques, eliciting both functional antibodies which neutralize SARS-CoV-2 infection and block Spike protein binding to the ACE2 receptor, and a robust, Th1- dominated cellular response in the periphery and in the lung. We show here that the pre-fusion stabilized Spike antigen is superior to the wild type in inducing ACE2-interfering, SARS-CoV2 neutralizing antibodies. To face the unprecedented need for vaccine manufacturing at massive scale, different GRAd genome deletions were compared to select the vector backbone showing the highest productivity in stirred tank bioreactors. This preliminary dataset identified GRAd-COV2 as a potential COVID-19 vaccine candidate, supporting the translation of GRAd-COV2 vaccine in a currently ongoing Phase I clinical trial (NCT04528641).","Capone, Stefania; Raggioli, Angelo; Gentile, Michela; Battella, Simone; Lahm, Armin; Sommella, Andrea; Contino, Alessandra Maria; Urbanowicz, Richard A.; Scala, Romina; Barra, Federica; Leuzzi, Adriano; Lilli, Eleonora; Miselli, Giuseppina; Noto, Alessia; Ferraiuolo, Maria; Talotta, Francesco; Tsoleridis, Theocharis; Castilletti, Concetta; Matusali, Giulia; Colavita, Francesca; Lapa, Daniele; Meschi, Silvia; Capobianchi, Maria; Soriani, Marco; Folgori, Antonella; Ball, Jonathan K.; Colloca, Stefano; Vitelli, Alessandra",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.22.349951,387

Individual and social factors are behind believing conspiracy theories. Adults (N = 1001) were asked to rate their beliefs in various conspiracy theories circulating in social media, rate their psychological distress relating to COVID-19, rate their trust in science to solve COVID-19 problems, and rate their willingness to adhere to measures regarding social distancing and quarantine. The findings showed conspiracy theories are widely believed and related to lower age, lower education, living in less densely populated areas, and lower income. Stronger conspiracy theory beliefs predicted science mistrust and unwillingness to adhere to public health measures. Psychological state was a strong predictor of conspiracy beliefs. Recommendations, stemming from the findings, for reducing such beliefs and better serving public health are discussed.","Constantinou, Marios; Kagialis, Antonios; Karekla, Maria",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34208154/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18126343,387
689259,"Social (Un)distancing: Teammate Interactions, Athletic Identity, and Mental Health of Student-Athletes During the COVID-19 Pandemic",2020-09-14,"Recent large-scale pandemics such as the covid19, H1N1, Swine flu, Ebola and the Nipah virus, which impacted human health and livelihoods, have come about due to inadequate food systems safeguards to detect, trace and eliminate threats arising from zoonotic diseases. Such diseases are transmitted to humans through their interaction with animals in the food value chain including through the consumption of bush meat. Climate change has also facilitated the emergence of new zoonotic diseases. The lack of adequately enforced food-safety standards in managed agricultural production systems creates the necessary conditions for diseases to mutate into highly contagious strains. The lack of food safety measures in handling, packaging and sales of food increases risks of cross-species contamination. Finally, increasing anti-microbial resistance, combined with rapid urbanization and global interconnectedness allows diseases to spread rapidly among humans. Thus, part of the reconstruction efforts, post covid19, should include prioritizing proactive investments in food safety. The key to stave off another such pandemic lies in integrating one-health knowledge on zoonotic diseases along with food safety measures along the food value chain. Refocusing policy priorities from disease control to prevention will improve international coordination efforts in pandemic prevention. Implementing such proactive actions will cost a very small fraction of the reconstruction budgets. However, the expected benefits of the food-safety approach will include preventing global economic losses due to pandemics.","Aiyar, Anaka; Pingali, Prabhu",Food Secur,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32837645/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s12571-020-01074-3,387
