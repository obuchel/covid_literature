44299,Graded Algebraic Theories,2020-04-17,"BACKGROUND: The area of New York was hit hard by the COVID 19 pandemic with Suffolk county in Long Island numbering >40 thousand cases and 1900 deaths by the end of May 2020. The Veterans Affairs Medical Center (VAMC) at Northport NY serves over 30000 Veterans. We report our institution’s experience during the COVID 19 outbreak METHODS: Retrospective chart review of hospitalized Veterans (VETS) with COVID-19 from March 1(st) to May 31(st) 2020 at Northport VAMC RESULTS: A total of 141 VETS had laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, 67 got hospitalized, and 20/67 died. The median age of the hospitalized cohort was 73 years (33 to 94). Figure 1 shows the dates of tests, Tables 1 &2 summarize the demographic characteristics, medical history and laboratory findings. No co-infection with influenza or other respiratory viruses were identified. The deceased group was older 77.5 vs 71 years P 0.007, had lower oxygen saturation and higher respiratory rate on presentation, had longer length of stay P 0.091, more likely to be in ICU and intubated, had lower bicarbonate levels, higher SAPS P < 0.001, higher lactate dehydrogenase, blood urea nitrogen, potassium levels, and higher peak procalcitonin, CRP, ferritin, ESR levels. There was no difference between recovered and deceased in terms of comorbidities except atrial fibrillation. Also, no difference in use of ACE inhibitors, statins, famotidine, hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), azithromycin, doxycycline, steroids. Beta lactam antibiotics and tocilizumab were given more in the deceased group. HCQ was stopped in 1 patient due to QTc prolongation. No bacteremia identified in the recovered group contrary to two occasions in the deceased, E. faecalis and S. mitis. Six pneumonias in intubated deceased patients were identified (3 had received steroids and one tocilizumab) and 4 in recovered (2 intubated/steroids and 1 tocilizumab). 12 recovered patients had persistent positive nasopharyngeal PCR for SARS-CoV-2 for average 29 days (14 to 79 days), and 4 of them were checked and had detectable IgG antibody Dates of Tests for Hospitalized Veterans with COVID-19 [Image: see text] Comparison of Demographic Data and Comorbidities in Recovered vs Diseased Hospitalized Veterans with COVID - 19 [Image: see text] Comparison of Laboratory Data in Recovered vs Diseased Hospitalized Veterans with COVID - 19 [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: The inpatient mortality of hospitalized VETS with COVID-19 in our institution was 30%. Mortality was associated with older age. Ongoing monitoring of outcomes in hospitalized patients will be important to understand the evolving epidemiology of COVID-19 among US VETS.

44301,Non-idempotent Intersection Types in Logical Form,2020-04-17,"BACKGROUND: The use of corticosteroids, specifically dexamethasone has been associated to low mortality in COVID-19 patients. We present here the mortality related to the use of corticosteroids in the first two months of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in México City. METHODS: We conducted a case series of patients with the diagnosis of pneumonia due to SARS-CoV-2 virus admitted to a tertiary care center in Mexico City, between March 14th and May 14th, 2020. Data collected included demographic information, comorbidities, treatment and outcomes including mortality. RESULTS: We included 109 patients with diagnosis of COVID-19 associated pneumonia with computed tomography; 76(69.7%) were male and 33(30.3%) female with a median age of 52 yo (24–85) and 51 yo (25–81), respectively. Most common comorbidities were overweight (48.6%), obesity (35.8%), hypertension (23.8%), and diabetes (18.3%). Thirty-eight patients received corticosteroids (Methylprednisolone 30, Hydrocortisone 6 and dexamethasone and prednisone in on case). Mortality in those that used corticosteroids was 21% (8/38) and 5.6% for those that did not received (4/71), p=0.014. Forty cases needed mechanical ventilation from the beginning, and 24 of those received corticosteroids with a mortality of 29% (7/24), while the mortality was 18.7% (3/16) in those with no steroid use, p=0.45. CONCLUSION: Mortality in our small cohort with predominantly use of methylprednisolone is not lower in those using steroids. In fact, mortality was significantly higher in those that received corticosteroids, while this significance was not maintained in those that needed immediate mechanical ventilation. Use of corticosteroids for COVID-19 patients with pneumonia, should be further investigated.

44309,Parameterized Synthesis for Fragments of First-Order Logic Over Data Words,2020-04-17,"BACKGROUND: First responders (e.g., emergency medical technicians, firefighters and police) may be at higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and potentially spreading it than the general population due to frequent and close exposure to others. Prevention of first responder infections is important for reducing secondary transmission and maintaining health system capacity. We aimed to evaluate the burden of SARS-CoV-2 infection on first responders, identify risk factors for infection, and to provide health services to help control the current outbreak. METHODS: Memorial Healthcare System (MHS), a public healthcare system serving the South Broward Hospital District, together with the National Guard and Florida state governor, opened up a drive-through testing center for SARS-CoV-2 at C.B. Smith Park in Broward County, Florida. All first responders in Broward County, symptomatic or asymptomatic, were being tested. SARS-CoV-2 infection was made as a positive result of real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing on at least one nasal or nasopharyngeal swab. All first responders who test positive for SARS-CoV-2 were informed by test site staff and self-quarantined to limit the spread of the disease. RESULTS: A total of 3,375 individuals was tested during the period from April 1 to April 29, 2020. The median age was 42 years (IQR 33–52) and 1,464 (43%) were men. 473 (14%) were symptomatic and 2,902 (86%) were asymptomatic. 289 (8.5%) of 3,375 first responders were positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection. These included 54 of 473 symptomatic (11%) and 235 of 2,902 asymptomatic (8.1%) cases. The rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection were comparable in male vs female (8.1% vs 8.9%, p = 0.429) and in symptomatic vs asymptomatic (p = 0.173). There is no sex-, age-based differences in susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection among the first responders tested (Figure 1). Laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 among first responders between April 1 and April 30, 2020 in Broward County. [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: First responders carry a significant burden from SARS-CoV-2 infection, with an infection rate of 8.5%, which was comparable in symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals. There is no sex-, age-based differences in susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection in first responders. High priority testing for SARS-CoV-2 must expand to include first responders, particularly asymptomatic individuals.

44314,Local Local Reasoning: A BI-Hyperdoctrine for Full Ground Store,2020-04-17,"BACKGROUND: Systemic corticosteroids (steroids) have been empirically used in acute respiratory distress syndrome, an entity also present in coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19). Early steroids administration could accelerate resolution of symptoms and reduce intensive care unit (ICU) stay in these patients, but practice varies widely as evidence is scant. METHODS: We reviewed the records of 498 adults admitted to Stony Brook University Hospital, NY, from 3/1 to 4/15, 2020 with COVID-19 requiring high-ﬂow O2 (non-rebreather mask, Venturi mask with FiO2 >50%, or high-ﬂow nasal cannula). We excluded those (N=29) who received mechanical ventilation (MV) or died within 24h of admission. We followed patients until death or discharge. We compared outcomes between patients who received early steroids (i.e. prior to MV) and those who did not. We used adjusted Cox models to evaluate the composite of death or need for MV. We also evaluated healthcare resources utilization. RESULTS: Of 469 patients, 175 (37.3%) received steroids while on high flow O2. Table 1 summarizes the baseline characteristics. Patients who received steroids were more likely to have asthma, had slightly longer duration of symptoms, lower O2 saturation, higher NT-proBNP and lower IL-6 levels at baseline. In total, 228 patients (48.6%) reached the composite endpoint (123 died and 105 received MV). By 7 days, 32.5% of patients who received steroids died or were intubated vs. 44.8% of those who did not (log-rank P=0.008), Figure 1. In models adjusted for race, age, sex, comorbidities, baseline O2 saturation and procalcitonin, steroids reduced risk for death or MV by 44% (hazard ratio [HR] 0.56; 95%CI 0.42–0.76; P< 0.001). The effect was time-dependent with initial HR 0.34 (95%CI 0.21–0.56; P< 0.001) and daily attenuation by 10.2% (95%CI 1.7%–19.4%; P=0.017). Mortality at 7 and 14 days did not differ between groups (8.1% vs. 8.3% and 19.1% vs. 21.0%, respectively, log-rank P=0.75). Among discharged patients, length of hospital stay was longer, but ICU stay was shorter with steroids, Table 2. Patient Characteristics According to Use of Early Steroids [Image: see text] [Image: see text] Healthcare Resources Utilization According to Use of Early Steroids Among Discharged Patients [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: Early administration of steroids reduced primarily the need for MV in our high-risk COVID-19 patients, with shorter ICU utilization, at the expense of longer hospital stay. Further studies are needed to optimize the use of steroids in these patients.

Students who feel included, understood, and safe in their educational environment are better equipped to do well academically and have better social relationships. This chapter will first overview the status of student mental health and how this affects academic achievement, how student mental health can impact educator fatigue and burnout, overall school mental health culture, and barriers for help-seeking, which include mental health stigma, cultural perceptions of mental health, and cost and availability of care. The chapter will then review the impact of online role-play simulations from a suite of K12 programs that include three simulations: At-Risk for Elementary School Educators, At-Risk for Middle School Educators and At-Risk for High School Educators. These virtual role-plays teach educators and school personnel how to identify students in psychological distress and how to use motivational interviewing tactics that they can apply in conversations with students and parents to discuss their concerns and, if necessary, make a referral to the appropriate support services. As K12 educators become more cognizant of how to identify and refer those in need, the overall culture of school mental health and wellness will improve.","Khalid, Nikita",Games and Simulations in Teacher Education,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7981494/,810

Sharing experiences in combating the COVID-19 pandemic and seeking international cooperation is an effective way to facilitate countries’ search for appropriate measures to prevent and control the pandemic. The new local confirmed case of COVID-19 suddenly appeared in Beijing on June 11, when there are 56 consecutive days with no new local cases but rapidly controlled in a short period. Its systematic strategy to combat the pandemic is worth sharing and learning from. Beijing’s pandemic prevention and control measures can be summarized in the “coordination, classification, and collaboration” approach. Based on this prevention and control strategy, Beijing’s anti-pandemic work coordinated the government, society, and individuals’ forces. It divided the critical works of pandemic prevention and control, coordinated the conflict between anti-pandemic work and production life, and finally achieved the smooth anti-pandemic work. Beijing’s experience in fighting the pandemic can provide one of the solutions to mitigate the global COVID-19 pandemic crisis.","Han, Yi; Li, Jie; Jia, Kun; Liu, Yanxu; Zhao, Wenwu",COVID-19 Pandemic Trajectory in the Developing World,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7981497/,810

49900,Leafy automata for higher-order concurrency,2021-03-23,"The global outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 or COVID-19 and the subsequent policies of social distancing and the nationwide lockdown have changed the whole scenario of the world’s public transportation system. It has affected the transportation sector in multiple ways. The virus’ outbreak has instantly affected the traveling behavior of the people, which has ultimately resulted in complete stagnation of the transport sector worldwide. As most economic activities are directly or indirectly associated with the transportation system, transport-related activities are also severely affected. Thus, it has become a necessary consideration for economists and geographers to understand the overall scenario. This paper explores the impact of COVID-19 on the Indian public transportation system during and post lockdown period using some statistical facts and figures. Analyzes have been done based on the primary and secondary sources of information collected from the primary survey, different news reports, and published research articles. The study reveals a massive reduction in demand for mass transportation modes to get around the fear of spreading the virus and lockdown policy.","Paul, Biswajit; Sarkar, Subir",COVID-19 Pandemic Trajectory in the Developing World,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7981506/,810
69396,Laser tracheobronchoplasty: a novel technique for the treatment of symptomatic tracheobronchomalacia.,2017,"Background: There is increasing interest in the use of telemedicine as a means of health care delivery especially in circumstances of pandemics. This is partly because technological advances have made the equipment less expensive and simpler to use and partly because increasing health care costs and patient expectations have increased the need to find alternative modes of health care delivery. Introduction: Telemedicine and telepsychiatry, in particular, are rapidly becoming important delivery approaches to providing clinical care and information to patients in cases wherein the medical resources and the patients are very hard to be brought together with respect to rules of behavior in case of epidemics. The reliance on technology to bridge the obstacles between the patients (consumers) and medical resources (providers) can create problems that impact service delivery and outcomes, but in cases such as this (COVID-19 pandemics), this is virtually the only tool for providing clinical care and information to patients. Materials and Methods: A client satisfaction survey was undertaken in a daily hospital (a part of University Clinic of Psychiatry in Skopje). The anonymous modified self-report questionnaire (short form patient satisfaction questionnaire [PSQ-18]) covering demographic, gender, and age variables was endorsed by 28 participants. The mean age of the subjects was 40.25 ± 22 years, with a small majority of men (18 participants) versus women (11 participants). Results: Overall satisfaction with psychiatric care was high (80.22%). None of the demographic or other variables correlated significantly with satisfaction. Discussion: We had to reduce rate and time length of our face-to-face contacts with patients as a result of pandemics but they were able to reach their doctors virtually at all times. Conclusions: Many mental health professionals are using widely available, commercial software downloaded from the internet to provide care directly to a patient's home.","Haxhihamza, Kadri; Arsova, Slavica; Bajraktarov, Stojan; Kalpak, Gjorgji; Stefanovski, Branislav; Novotni, Antoni; Milutinovic, Milos",Telemedicine journal and e-health : the official journal of the American Telemedicine Association,https://doi.org/10.1089/tmj.2020.0256; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32809916/,810
77272,Zenker's diverticulum: Rotterdam experience.,2016,"During the last decade, a dramatic rise in the development and application of artificial intelligence (AI) tools for use in pathology services has occurred. This trend is often expected to continue and reshape the field of pathology in the coming years. The deployment of computational pathology and applications of AI tools can be considered as a paradigm shift that will change pathology services, making them more efficient and capable of meeting the needs of this era of precision medicine. Despite the success of AI models, the translational process from discovery to clinical applications has been slow. The gap between self-contained research and clinical environment may be too wide and has been largely neglected. In this review, we cover the current and prospective applications of AI in pathology. We examine its applications in diagnosis and prognosis, and we offer insights for considerations that could improve clinical applicability of these tools. Then, we discuss its potential to improve workflow efficiency, and its benefits in pathologist education. Finally, we review the factors that could influence adoption in clinical practices and the associated regulatory processes.","Rakha, Emad A; Toss, Michael; Shiino, Sho; Gamble, Paul; Jaroensri, Ronnachai; Mermel, Craig; Chen, Cameron",Journal of clinical pathology,https://doi.org/10.1136/jclinpath-2020-206908; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32763920/,810
79597,Safety of (rhino)septoplasty without nasal packing in routine ENT practice.,2021-03-18,"Interventional oncology procedures such as thermal ablation are becoming widely used for many tumours in the liver, kidney and lung. Thermal ablation refers to the focal destruction of tissue by generating cytotoxic temperatures in the treatment zone. Hydrodissection - separating tissues with fluids - protects healthy tissues adjacent to the ablation treatment zone to improve procedural safety, and facilitate more aggressive power application or applicator placement. However, fluids such as normal saline and 5% dextrose in water (D5W) can migrate into the peritoneum, reducing their protective efficacy. As an alternative, a thermo-gelable poloxamer 407 (P407) solution has been recently developed to facilitate hydrodissection procedures. We hypothesise that the P407 gel material does not provide convective heat dissipation from the ablation site, and therefore may alter the heat transfer dynamics compared to liquid materials during hydrodissection-assisted thermal ablation. The purpose of this study was to investigate the heat dissipation mechanics within D5W, liquid P407 and gel P407 hydrodissection barriers. Overall it was shown that the gel P407 dissipated heat primarily through conduction, whereas the liquid P407 and D5W dissipated heat through convection. Furthermore, the rate of temperature change within the gel P407 was greater than liquid P407 and D5W. Testing to evaluate the in vivo efficacy of the fluids with different modes of heat dissipation seems warranted for further study.","Johnson, Alexander; Brace, Christopher","International journal of hyperthermia : the official journal of European Society for Hyperthermic Oncology, North American Hyperthermia Group",https://doi.org/10.3109/02656736.2015.1037799; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25960147/,810

Area-based conservation efforts, which include both protected areas and other effective area-based conservation measures, are likely to extend and diversify. However, persistent shortfalls in ecological representation and management effectiveness diminish the potential role of area-based conservation in stemming biodiversity loss. Here we show how the expansion of protected areas by national governments since 2010 has had limited success in increasing the coverage across different elements of biodiversity (ecoregions, 12,056 threatened species, 'Key Biodiversity Areas' and wilderness areas) and ecosystem services (productive fisheries, and carbon services on land and sea). To be more successful after 2020, area-based conservation must contribute more effectively to meeting global biodiversity goals-ranging from preventing extinctions to retaining the most-intact ecosystems-and must better collaborate with the many Indigenous peoples, community groups and private initiatives that are central to the successful conservation of biodiversity. The long-term success of area-based conservation requires parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity to secure adequate financing, plan for climate change and make biodiversity conservation a far stronger part of land, water and sea management policies.","Maxwell, Sean L; Cazalis, Victor; Dudley, Nigel; Hoffmann, Michael; Rodrigues, Ana S L; Stolton, Sue; Visconti, Piero; Woodley, Stephen; Kingston, Naomi; Lewis, Edward; Maron, Martine; Strassburg, Bernardo B N; Wenger, Amelia; Jonas, Harry D; Venter, Oscar; Watson, James E M",Nature,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-2773-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33028996/,810

Oncology services have been reorganized to decrease the risk of nosocomial acquisition of SARS-CoV-2, but changes in treatment pathways and follow-up cancer care can result in patients receiving suboptimal or delayed care. Herein, we describe a cross-sectional nested cohort study conducted to evaluate delays in care for patients with head and neck cancer (HNC) in post-treatment follow-up or palliative care during the COVID-19 pandemic in Northeast Brazil and its impact on health outcomes. Information was extracted from medical records and supplemented by telephone interviews. We compared the following health outcomes: self-perception of anxiety or sadness, fear of COVID-19 infection, cancer-related complications during social isolation, self-medication, diagnosis of COVID-19, and death between patients with and without delayed cancer care. The Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare distributions of continuous variables and the Fisher exact test was used for categorical variables. Thirty-one HNC patients were included in the study, and no case of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 was found. Delayed cancer care due to restriction in health services was reported in 58.1% of cases, and there was no report of telemedicine use during the COVID-19 outbreak. Cancer-related complications during the COVID-19 pandemic were described for most patients (67.7%) and included pain or discomfort, swelling, and dyspnea. Eight (25.8%) patients reported use of prescribed morphine or codeine to manage pain and six (19.4%) patients reported self-medication with over-the-counter (OTC) non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). We found an association between delayed HNC care and the use of self-medication (p = 0.028). This study indicated that patients with delayed HNC care during the COVID-19 outbreak are more likely to use self-medication with NSAIDs for pain management. Better strategies to follow HNC patients in socioeconomically disadvantaged communities need to be discussed and implemented.","Mahl, Claudiane; Melo, Luís Ricardo Santos de; Almeida, Maria Helena Andrade; Carvalho, Catarina Sampaio; Santos, Lois Lene Silva; Nunes, Paula Santos; Quintans-JÚnior, Lucindo José; AraÚjo, Adriano Antunes de Souza; Santos, Victor Santana; Martins-Filho, Paulo Ricardo",Brazilian oral research,https://doi.org/10.1590/1807-3107bor-2020.vol34.0126; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33331392/,810

CONCLUSIONS: Use of spatial analysis techniques is suggested to identify spatial disease patterns and to provide spatially disaggregated public health policy recommendations.","Arauzo-Carod, Josep-Maria",J. public health (Oxf),,810

To mitigate its impact on societies, health systems and economies, countries have adopted non-pharmacological preventive practices such as 'spatial' or 'social' distancing, the use of protective masks, and handwashing; these have been widely implemented. However, measures aimed at protecting physical health and healthcare systems have side-effects that might have a big impact on individuals' wellbeing. As the pandemic reaches low- and middle-income countries, weaker health systems, limited resources and the lower socioeconomic status of their populations make halting the pandemic more challenging. In this article, we explore the impact of COVID-19 and its prevention measures on the wellbeing of vulnerable populations. Special attention must be given to homeless, indigenous, migrant and imprisoned populations, as well as people living with disabilities and the elderly. More than just resolute governmental action will be required to overcome the pandemic. Links between science and political actions have to be strengthened. Fighting COVID-19 is a collective endeavour and community action, on a global scale, is of paramount importance.","Mesa Vieira, Cristina; Franco, Oscar H; Gómez Restrepo, Carlos; Abel, Thomas",Maturitas,,810

Personal care products (PCP) are one source of EDCs where differences in racial/ethnic patterns of use exist. We assessed the literature for racial/ethnic disparities in pregnancy and prenatal PCP chemical exposures. RECENT FINDINGS: Only 3 studies explicitly examined racial/ethnic disparities in pregnancy and prenatal exposure to PCP-associated EDCs. Fifty-three articles from 12 cohorts presented EDC concentrations stratified by race/ethnicity or among homogenous US minority populations. Studies reported on phthalates and phenols. Higher phthalate metabolites and paraben concentrations were observed for pregnant non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic women. Higher concentrations of benzophenone-3 were observed in non-Hispanic White women; results were inconsistent for triclosan. This review highlights need for future research examining pregnancy and prenatal PCP-associated EDCs disparities to understand and reduce racial/ethnic disparities in maternal and child health.,"Chan, Marissa; Mita, Carol; Bellavia, Andrea; Parker, Michaiah; James-Todd, Tamarra",Curr.
