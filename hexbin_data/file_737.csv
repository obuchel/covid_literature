This pathogen is associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality, especially among children under 2 years old, immunocompromised persons, and the elderly population. The major anti-pneumococcus agents are β-lactams and macrolides, with fluoroquinolones ranking third. The emergence of antibiotic-resistant pneumococcus due to overuse of antibiotics is a global concern. While the discovery of novel classes of antibiotics for the pneumococcus is at a standstill, significant progress in reducing the problem of resistance is associated with antibacterial vaccines. Nevertheless, the World Health Organization recently considered drug-resistant S. pneumoniae as ranking among the 12 bacteria, for which there is an urgent need for new treatments. A challenge is to slow the evolution of new strains that are resistant to the vaccines.","Cillóniz, Catia; Garcia-Vidal, Carolina; Ceccato, Adrian; Torres, Antoni",Antimicrobial Resistance in the 21st Century,737,7

Technologies using arrays have proven to be reliable and affordable for most of the scientific community worldwide. By typing microarrays or proteomics into a search engine such as PubMed, thousands of references can be viewed. Nevertheless, almost everyone in life science research has a story to tell about array experiments that were expensive, did not generate reproducible data, or generated meaningless data. Because considerable resources are required for any experiment using arrays, it is desirable to evaluate the best method and the best design to ask a certain question. Multiple levels of technical problems, such as sample preparation, array spotting, signal acquisition, dye intensity bias, normalization, or sample-contamination, can generate inconsistent results or misleading conclusions. Technical recommendations that offer alternatives and solutions for the most common problems have been discussed extensively in previous work. Less often discussed is the experimental design. A poor design can make array data analysis difficult, even if there are no technical problems. This chapter focuses on experimental design choices in terms of controls such as replicates and comparisons for microarray and proteomics. It also covers data validation and provides examples of studies using diverse experimental designs. The overall emphasis is on design efficiency. Though perhaps obvious, we also emphasize that design choices should be made so that biological questions are answered by clear data analysis.","Fournier, Marcia V.; Carvalho, Paulo Costa; Magee, David D.; da Carvalho, Maria Gloria Costa; Appasani, Krishnarao",Bioarrays,737,7

Viruses may also infect cranial or spinal blood vessels to produce ischemic injury. Viral and other infections may also elicit a host immune response which is cross-reactive with components of the neural tissue, resulting in encephalomyelitis, transverse myelitis, injury to peripheral nerves, or optic neuritis. This chapter discusses the pathogenesis of CNS viral infections and reviews clinical features of these disorders, major agents responsible in immunocompromised and immunocompetent individuals, and treatment.

In both biology and medicine, we are observing an exponential growth of structured data collections from experiments and population studies, enabling us to gain novel insights that would otherwise not be possible. However, these growing data sets pose a challenge for existing compute infrastructures since data is outgrowing limits within compute. In this work, we present the application of a novel approach, Memory-Driven Computing (MDC), in the life sciences. MDC proposes a data-centric approach that has been designed for growing data sizes and provides a composable infrastructure for changing workloads. In particular, we show how a typical pipeline for genomics data processing can be accelerated, and application modifications required to exploit this novel architecture. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the isolated evaluation of individual tasks misses significant overheads of typical pipelines in genomics data processing.","Becker, Matthias; Worlikar, Umesh; Agrawal, Shobhit; Schultze, Hartmut; Ulas, Thomas; Singhal, Sharad; Schultze, Joachim L.",High Performance Computing,737,1

While data-parallelism has been extensively studied and developed, several problems exist in realizing model-parallelism and hybrid-parallelism efficiently. Four major problems we focus on are: 1) defining a notion of a distributed model across processes, 2) implementing forward/back-propagation across process boundaries that requires explicit communication, 3) obtaining parallel speedup on an inherently sequential task, and 4) achieving scalability without losing out on a model’s accuracy. To address these problems, we create HyPar-Flow—a model-size and model-type agnostic, scalable, practical, and user-transparent system for hybrid-parallel training by exploiting MPI, Keras, and TensorFlow. HyPar-Flow provides a single API that can be used to perform data, model, and hybrid parallel training of any Keras model at scale. We create an internal distributed representation of the user-provided Keras model, utilize TF’s Eager execution features for distributed forward/back-propagation across processes, exploit pipelining to improve performance and leverage efficient MPI primitives for scalable communication. Between model partitions, we use send and recv to exchange layer-data/partial-errors while allreduce is used to accumulate/average gradients across model replicas. Beyond the design and implementation of HyPar-Flow, we also provide comprehensive correctness and performance results on three state-of-the-art HPC systems including TACC Frontera (#5 on Top500.org).

The coinfection rate of M. pneumoniae pneumonia (MPP) can reach 52% in some areas, but the effects of coinfection with different pathogens have not been clearly recognized. METHODS: The cases of MPP hospitalized in Beijing Children’s Hospital from 1/1/2014 to 12/31/2016 were screened. MPP patients coinfected with Human adenovirus (HAdV) were categorized into the research group. Patients with single M. pneumoniae infection were categorized into the control group, matching the research group by age and admission time with a ratio of 1:3. Clinical manifestations, laboratory examinations, and disease severity were compared between these two groups. RESULTS: A total of 2540 hospitalized MPP cases were screened in Beijing Children’s Hospital, among which thirty cases were enrolled in the research group and ninety cases were enrolled in the control group. The results indicated that patients in the research group had longer hospital stays, longer fever durations and a higher rate of dyspnea, as well as a larger proportion applications of oxygen therapy and noninvasive continuous positive airway pressure (NCPAP). No obvious differences were found in lab examinations within the two groups. Regarding disease severity, the proportions of extremely severe pneumonia and severe disease defined by the clinical score system were higher in the research group than in the control group. CONCLUSION: Compared with single M. pneumoniae infection, MPP coinfected with HAdV in children was relatively more serious.","Gao, Jiaojiao; Xu, Lili; Xu, Baoping; Xie, Zhengde; Shen, Kunling",BMC Infect Dis,737,7

This study evaluated whether specialized ECMO team is associated with improved in-hospital mortality in AMI patients undergoing veno-arterial (VA) ECMO. METHODS: A total of 255 AMI patients who underwent VA-ECMO were included. In January 2014, a multidisciplinary ECMO team was founded at our institution. Eligible patients were classified into a pre-ECMO team group (n = 131) and a post-ECMO team group (n = 124). The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: In-hospital mortality (pre-ECMO team vs. post-ECMO team, 54.2% vs. 33.9%; p = 0.002) and cardiac intensive care unit mortality (pre-ECMO team vs. post-ECMO team, 51.9% vs. 30.6%; p = 0.001) were significantly lower after the implementation of a multidisciplinary ECMO team. On multivariable logistic regression model, implementation of the multidisciplinary ECMO team was associated with reduction of in-hospital mortality [odds ratio: 0.37, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.20–0.67; p = 0.001].

However, like many other current RefSeq annotations, the annotation of the ER2566 strain was incomplete, with missing gene names and miscellaneous RNAs, as well as uncorrected annotations of some pseudogenes. Here, we performed a systematic reannotation of the ER2566 genome by combining multiple annotation tools with manual revision to provide a comprehensive understanding of the E. coli ER2566 strain, and used high-throughput sequencing to explore how the strain adapted under external pressure. RESULTS: The reannotation included noteworthy corrections to all protein-coding genes, led to the exclusion of 190 hypothetical genes or pseudogenes, and resulted in the addition of 237 coding sequences and 230 miscellaneous noncoding RNAs and 2 tRNAs. In addition, we further manually examined all 194 pseudogenes in the Ref-seq annotation and directly identified 123 (63%) as coding genes. We then used whole-genome sequencing and high-throughput RNA sequencing to assess mutational adaptations under consecutive subculture or overexpression burden. Whereas no mutations were detected in response to consecutive subculture, overexpression of the human papillomavirus 16 type capsid led to the identification of a mutation (position 1,094,824 within the 3′ non-coding region) positioned 19-bp away from the lacI gene in the transcribed RNA, which was not detected at the genomic level by Sanger sequencing. CONCLUSION: The ER2566 strain was used by both the general scientific community and the biotechnology industry. Reannotation of the E. coli ER2566 strain not only improved the RefSeq data but uncovered a key site that might be involved in the transcription and translation of genes encoding the lactose operon repressor. We proposed that our pipeline might offer a universal method for the reannotation of other bacterial genomes with high speed and accuracy. This study might facilitate a better understanding of gene function for the ER2566 strain under external burden and provided more clues to engineer bacteria for biotechnological applications.","Zhou, Lizhi; Yu, Hai; Wang, Kaihang; Chen, Tingting; Ma, Yue; Huang, Yang; Li, Jiajia; Liu, Liqin; Li, Yuqian; Kong, Zhibo; Zheng, Qingbing; Wang, Yingbin; Gu, Ying; Xia, Ningshao; Li, Shaowei",BMC Genomics,737,7

The dataset employed was Lung TIME which is publicly available. When no preprocessing or segmentation was applied, training accuracy above 90.24% and test accuracy above 86.8% were obtained. In contrast, when segmentation was applied without preprocessing, a training accuracy above 97.19% and test accuracy above 95.07% were reached. On the other hand, when preprocessing and segmentation was applied, a training accuracy above 96.41% and test accuracy above 94.71% were achieved. On average, the Adam optimizer scored a training accuracy of 96.17% and a test accuracy of 95.23%. Whereas, the Nadam optimizer obtained 96.25% and 95.2%, respectively. It is concluded that CNN has a good performance even when working with images with noise. The performance of the network was similar when working with preprocessing and segmentation than when using only segmentation.

The methods are analyzed and compared using a color palette in which a transition between R, G, B, C, M and Y colors is generated. The results obtained show that the methods studied allow the specific colors to be adequately discriminated, while the proposed method is the only one that allows the full range of extreme colors R, G, B, C, M and Y to be detected, being more selective than the others, by taking practically the areas corresponding to each color separately .","Forero, Manuel G.; Ávila-Navarro, Julián; Herrera-Rivera, Sergio",Pattern Recognition,737,7

The challenge is to detect a flag located somewhere in the environment. The flag is posed on a pole, and to its right, a landing platform is located. Thus, the MAV has to detect the flag, fly towards it and once it is close enough, locate the landing platform nearby, aiming at centring over it to perform landing; all of this has to be carried out autonomously. In this context, the main problem is the detection of both the flag and the landing platform, whose shapes are known in advanced. Traditional computer vision algorithms could be used; however, the main challenges in this task are the changes in illumination, rotation and scale, and the fact that the flight controller uses the detection to perform the autonomous flight; hence the detection has to be stable and continuous on every camera frame. Motivated by this, we propose to use a Convolutional Neural Network optimised to be run on a small computer with limited computer processing budget. The MAV carries this computer, and it is used to process everything on board. To validate our system, we tested with rotated images, changes in scale and the presence of low illumination. Our method is compared against two conventional computer vision methods, namely, template and feature matching. In addition, we tested our system performance in a wide corridor, executing everything on board the MAV.

In this article a new method of Digital Assisted Image Correlation (DAIC) is presented to match specific points in order to estimate the deformation of the surface in the metal sheets used in the automotive industry. To achieve this, it is necessary to stamp the surface to be measured with a regular pattern of points, then a digital image processing is done to obtain the labels of the circles of the pattern. After this, a semi-automatic search is made in the labels of both images to correlate all of them and perform the triangulation. DIC is used to corroborate the correspondence between points and verify the accuracy and efficiency of the developed method. This allows the 3D reconstruction of the sheet with a minimum of information and provides more efficiency and a great benefit in computational cost. Deformation is calculated by two methods, which show similarity between the values obtained with a digital microscope. It is assumed that quality of marks stamping, lighting, and the initial conditions, also contribute for trustworthy effects.","Carlos-Eduardo, García-Alcalá; José-Alfredo, Padilla-Medina; Alejandro-Israel, Barranco-Gutiérrez",Pattern Recognition,737,7

The assessment is done through monitoring the performance measures of a neural classifier, with and without user-level attention, when only a limited number of highly-weighted posts are provided. Results show that the weights assigned by the user-level attention strongly correlate with the amount of information that posts provide in showing if their author is at risk of anorexia or not, and hence can be used to explain the decision of the neural classifier.","Amini, Hessam; Kosseim, Leila",Natural Language Processing and Information Systems,737,7

Fake news are written in a way to confuse readers and therefore understanding which articles contain fabricated information is very challenging for non-experts. Given the difficulty of the task, several fact checking websites have been developed to raise awareness about which articles contain fabricated information. As a result of those platforms, several users are interested to share posts that cite evidence with the aim to refute fake news and warn other users. These users are known as fact checkers. However, there are users who tend to share false information, who can be characterised as potential fake news spreaders. In this paper, we propose the CheckerOrSpreader model that can classify a user as a potential fact checker or a potential fake news spreader. Our model is based on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and combines word embeddings with features that represent users’ personality traits and linguistic patterns used in their tweets. Experimental results show that leveraging linguistic patterns and personality traits can improve the performance in differentiating between checkers and spreaders.","Giachanou, Anastasia; Ríssola, Esteban A.; Ghanem, Bilal; Crestani, Fabio; Rosso, Paolo",Natural Language Processing and Information Systems,737,7

However, these models do not always work effectively in some social media contexts. When considering the use of Arabic in microblogs like Twitter, it is important to note that a variety of different linguistic domains are involved. This is mainly because social media users employ various dialects in their communications. While training word-level models with such informal text can lead to words being captured that have the same meanings, these models cannot capture all words that can be encountered in the real world due to out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words. The inability to identify words is one of the main limitations of this word-level model. In contrast, character-level embeddings can work effectively with this problem through their ability to learn the vectors of character n-grams or parts of words. We take advantage of both character- and word-level models to discover more effective methods to represent Arabic affect words in tweets. We evaluate our embeddings by incorporating them into a supervised learning framework for a range of affect tasks. Our models outperform the state-of-the-art Arabic pre-trained word embeddings in these tasks. Moreover, they offer improved state-of-the-art results for the task of Arabic emotion intensity, outperforming the top-performing systems that employ a combination of deep neural networks and several other features.","Alharbi, Abdullah I.; Lee, Mark",Natural Language Processing and Information Systems,737,7

The onset of pandemic influenza viruses might be attributed to various ambient meteorological factors including temperature, relative humidity (Rh), and PM(1) concentrations, etc. The study aims to explore the correlation between the seasonality of pandemic influenza and these factors. METHODS: We recruited pediatric patients aged from 0 to 18 years who were diagnosed with influenza A or B from July 1st, 2017 to June 30th, 2019 in Shanghai Children’s Medical Centre (SCMC). Ambient meteorological data were collected from the Shanghai Meteorological Service (SMS) over the same period. The correlation of influenza outbreak and meteorological factors were analyzed through preliminary Pearson’s r correlation test and subsequent time-series Poisson regression analysis using the distributed lag non-linear model (DLNM). RESULTS: Pearson’s r test showed a statistically significant correlation between the weekly number of influenza A outpatients and ambient meteorological factors including weekly mean, maximum, minimum temperature and barometric pressure (P < 0.001), and PM(1) (P < 0.01). While the weekly number of influenza B outpatients was statistically significantly correlated with weekly mean, maximum and minimum temperature (P < 0.001), barometric pressure and PM(1) (P < 0.01), and minimum Rh (P < 0.05). Mean temperature and PM(1) were demonstrated to be the statistically significant variables in the DLNM with influenza A and B outpatients through time-series Poisson regression analysis. A U-shaped curve relationship was noted between the mean temperature and influenza A cases (below 15 °C and above 20 °C), and the risks increased for influenza B with mean temperature below 10 °C. PM(1) posed a risk after a concentration of 23 ppm for both influenza A and B. High PM(1), low and the high temperature had significant effects upon the number of influenza A cases, whereas low temperature and high PM(1) had significant effects upon the number of influenza B cases. CONCLUSION: This study indicated that mean temperature and PM(1) were the primary factors that were continually associated with the seasonality of pediatric pandemic influenza A and B and the recurrence in the transmission and spread of influenza viruses.","Li, Yanbo; Ye, Xiaofang; Zhou, Ji; Zhai, Feng; Chen, Jie",Environ Health,737,7

Baseline ScO(2) was significantly associated with LOS in ICU (odds ratio [OR] per percentage decrease in baseline ScO(2), 0.95; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.93 to 0.97; P < 0.001), with LOS in hospital (OR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.91 to 0.96; P < 0.001), with MV duration (OR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.90 to 0.95; P < 0.001) and with 30-day mortality (OR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.91 to 0.98; P = 0.007). Cerebral oxygen saturation TWA had no associations, while ScO(2) TBBL had only a small association with LOS in ICU (OR, 1.02; 95% CI, 1.01 to 1.03; P < 0.001), MV duration (OR,1.02; 95% CI, 1.01 to 1.03; P = 0.002), and LOS in hospital (OR, 1.02; 95% CI, 1.01 to 1.04; P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: In pediatric patients undergoing cardiac surgery, low baseline ScO(2) values measured after tracheal intubation were associated with several adverse postoperative outcomes. In contrast, the severity of actual intraoperative cerebral desaturation was not associated with postoperative outcomes. Baseline ScO(2) measured after tracheal intubation may help identify patients at increased perioperative risk.","Modestini, Marco; Hoffmann, Lisa; Niezen, Caren; Armocida, Benedetta; Vos, Jaap Jan; Scheeren, Thomas W.

We find that regional policy coordination is critical to mitigate and isolate the pandemic shock. It is important to identify the pandemic events early to flatten the pandemic curve at the national and regional level. This supports a recent study by the World Bank (2020), which highlights the importance of early mitigation policies during the pandemic shock. The cost of the pandemic and economic shocks will increase significantly when several countries in the region experience the pandemic shock concurrently. In this case, flattening the regional pandemic curve becomes important. The results also indicate the need for greater coordination in East Asia to mitigate the pending economic shock in terms of unemployment, corporate bankruptcy and financial market fragility. The paper also highlights that the stability of the GVC network is critical during the pandemic in terms of hedging the risk of disruptions to the procurement of critical medical and health products as well as maintaining service linkages to manufacturing, such as the logistics sector.

Due to the size of these models, parallel execution is required to avoid prohibitively long computing time. While it is occasionally possible to specify some of these models using parallel building blocks, this limits expressivity. Therefore, a more general generative specification is preferred. To leverage parallel computing capacity, these specifications can be annotated, but doing so effectively assumes that the modeler has expertise from computer science. This paper outlines how to identify parallel parts automatically by leveraging the conditional independence property in the graphical model extracted from the dataflow graph of model specifications. Computation related to random variables with the same depth in the graphical model are identified as candidates for parallel execution. Since subsequent proposals in the parameter space exploration of the model are clustered together, the results show that the well known longest processing time scheduling heuristic deals adequately with load imbalance. The proposed parallelization is evaluated on two pharmacometrics models, a domain where hierarchical models with load imbalance are common due to the numeric simulation of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of human subjects. The varying number of measurements taken per subject further exacerbates load imbalance.","Nemeth, Balazs; Haber, Tom; Liesenborgs, Jori; Lamotte, Wim",Computational Science - ICCS 2020,737,7

Moreover, by using a probabilistic approach, our model gives a representative understanding of the overall trajectories of simulated outbreaks without the need for numerous (order of hundreds) of repeated Monte Carlo simulations. We simulate our model over a contact network constructed using registration data of university students. We model three diseases; measles and two strains of influenza. We compare the results obtained by PIM with those obtained by simulating stochastic SEIR models over the same the contact network. The results demonstrate that the PIM can successfully replicate the averaged results from numerous simulations of a stochastic model in a single deterministic simulation.","Qian, Willian; Bhowmick, Sanjukta; O’Neill, Marty; Ramisetty-Mikler, Susie; Mikler, Armin R.",Computational Science - ICCS 2020,737,7

However, there are obvious differences between ZeroNet and conventional P2P networks. Existing researches rarely involve ZeroNet and the characteristics and robustness of ZeroNet are unknown.

No like other simulation experiments, the experiments of this paper are set on real-world environment. This is also the first measurement study about ZeroNet. Experimental results show that the topology of the peer network in ZeroNet has scarce edges, short distances and low clustering coefficients, and its degree distribution exhibits a special distribution. These indicate that the peer network of ZeroNet has poor robustness and the experimental results of the ZeroNet resilience verify this issue. In addition, this paper represents an improved peer exchange method to enhance the robustness of the ZeroNet.

There can be different protocols in use, by multiple data streams, producing a mix of different traffic signatures. Furthermore, bottlenecks and protocols can change dynamically. Yet, if it were possible to determine the protocols (e.g., congestion control algorithms (CCAs)) or the applications in use by the background traffic, appropriate optimisations for the foreground traffic might be taken by operating systems, users, or administrators. We extend previous work in predicting network protocols via signatures based on a time-series of round-trip times (RTT). Gathering RTTs is minimally intrusive and does not require administrative privilege. Although there have been successes in using machine learning (ML) to classify protocols, the use cases have been relatively simple or have focused on the foreground traffic.

These advances have come with a dramatic increase of input data in the form of faster frame rates, larger fields of view or higher resolution, so high performance solutions are currently widely used for analysis. Tomographic instruments can vary significantly from one to another, including the hardware employed for reconstruction: from single CPU workstations to large scale hybrid CPU/GPU supercomputers. Flexibility on the software interfaces and reconstruction engines are also highly valued to allow for easy development and prototyping. This paper presents a novel software framework for tomographic analysis that tackles all aforementioned requirements. The proposed solution capitalizes on the increased performance of sparse matrix-vector multiplication and exploits multi-CPU and GPU reconstruction over MPI. The solution is implemented in Python and relies on CuPy for fast GPU operators and CUDA kernel integration, and on SciPy for CPU sparse matrix computation. As opposed to previous tomography solutions that are tailor-made for specific use cases or hardware, the proposed software is designed to provide flexible, portable and high-performance operators that can be used for continuous integration at different production environments, but also for prototyping new experimental settings or for algorithmic development.

As households are an important context for measles transmission, the clustering of susceptible individuals within households can have a decisive effect on the risk for measles outbreaks. However, as the population ages and household constitutions change over the next 20 years, that effect may change as well. To adequately plan for the control and eventual elimination of measles, we need to understand how the effect of within-household susceptibility clustering will evolve. Individual-based models enable us to represent the different levels of heterogeneity in a population that are necessary to understand the spread of a disease in a highly immunized population. In this paper, we use such an individual-based model to investigate how the effect of household-based susceptibility clustering is expected to change over the next two decades in Flanders, Belgium. We compare different scenarios regarding the level of within-household susceptibility clustering for three different calendar years between 2020 and 2040, using projections for the age distribution of the population, the constitution of households and age-specific immunity levels. We find that a higher level of susceptibility clustering within households increases the risk for measles outbreaks and their potential to spread through the population, in current as well as in future populations.","Kuylen, Elise; Liesenborgs, Jori; Broeckhove, Jan; Hens, Niel",Computational Science - ICCS 2020,737,7

Using the tools of the differential algebraic equation theory, we reveal some important qualitative properties of this system, such as its existence domain, and propose a numerical method for its solution.

This mutation model following a Moran process finds a compelling application in modeling information propagation through human networks. Here we present a stochastic model for a two-state human population in which each of N individual nodes subscribes to one of two contrasting messages, or pieces of information. We use a mutation model to describe the spread of one of the two messages labeled the mutant, regulated by stochastic parameters such as talkativity and belief probability for an arbitrary fitness r of the mutant message. The fixation of mutant information is analyzed for an unstructured well-mixed population and simulated on a Barabási-Albert graph to mirror a human social network of [Formula: see text] individuals. Chiefly, we introduce the possibility of a single node speaking to multiple information recipients or listeners, each independent of one another, per a binomial distribution. We find that while in mixed populations, the fixation probability of the mutant message is strongly correlated with the talkativity (sample correlation [Formula: see text]) and belief probability ([Formula: see text]) of the initial mutant, these correlations with respect to talkativity ([Formula: see text]) and belief probability ([Formula: see text]) are weaker on BA graph simulations. This indicates the likely effect of added stochastic noise associated with the inherent construction of graphs and human networks.","Chhabria, Prasidh; Lu, Winnie",Computational Science - ICCS 2020,737,7

The iterative method works as follows: at each iteration, quadratic approximations of the Three-Dimensional-Variational (3D-Var) cost function are built about current solutions. These approximations are employed to build sub-spaces onto which analysis increments can be estimated. We sample search-directions from those sub-spaces, and for each direction, a line-search optimization method is employed to estimate its optimal step length. Current solutions are updated based on directions along which the 3D-Var cost function decreases faster. We theoretically prove the global convergence of our proposed iterative method. Experimental tests are performed by using the Lorenz-96 model, and for reference, we employ a Maximum-Likelihood-Ensemble-Filter (MLEF) whose ensemble size doubles that of our implementation. The results reveal that, as the degree of observational operators increases, the use of additional directions can improve the accuracy of results in terms of [Formula: see text]-norm of errors, and even more, our numerical results outperform those of the employed MLEF implementation.","Nino-Ruiz, Elias D.",Computational Science - ICCS 2020,737,7

So, we describe various usable distance functions and compare them both theoretically and practically. The results suggest that, when using the Mode-based approach, representing planes by reflection transformations is the best way but other simpler representations are applicable as well.

The purpose of the approach is to classify simple actions by applying shape descriptors to sequences of binary silhouettes. The recognition process consists of several main stages: shape representation, action sequence representation and action sequence classification. Firstly, each shape is represented using a selected shape descriptor. Secondly, shape descriptors of each sequence are matched, matching values are put into a vector and transformed into final action representation—we employ Fourier transform-based methods to obtain action representations equal in size. A classification into eight classes is performed using leave-one-out cross-validation and template matching approaches. We present results of the experiments on classification accuracy using moment-based shape descriptors (Zernike Moments, Moment Invariants and Contour Sequence Moments) and three matching measures (Euclidean distance, correlation coefficient and C1 correlation). Different combinations of the above-mentioned algorithms are examined in order to indicate the most effective one. The experiments show that satisfactory results are obtained when low-order Zernike Moments are used for shape representation and absolute values of Fourier transform are applied to represent action sequences.

If the coefficient matrix is the Jacobian of some mathematical function given in the form of a computer program, automatic differentiation enables the efficient and accurate evaluation of Jacobian-vector products and transposed Jacobian-vector products in a matrix-free fashion. Standard preconditioning techniques, however, typically require access to individual nonzero elements of the coefficient matrix. These operations are computationally expensive in a matrix-free approach where the coefficient matrix is not explicitly assembled. We propose a novel preconditioning technique that is designed to be used in combination with automatic differentiation. A key element of this technique is the formulation and solution of a graph coloring problem that encodes the rules of partial Jacobian computation that determines only a proper subset of the nonzero elements of the Jacobian matrix. The feasibility of this semi-matrix-free approach is demonstrated on a set of numerical experiments using the automatic differentiation tool ADiMat.","Rostami, M. Ali; Bücker, H.

The main purpose of this paradigm is how to solve multiple optimization problems or tasks simultaneously by conducting a single search process. The main catalyst for reaching this objective is to exploit possible synergies and complementarities among the tasks to be optimized, helping each other by virtue of the transfer of knowledge among them (thereby being referred to as Transfer Optimization). In this context, Evolutionary Multitasking addresses Transfer Optimization problems by resorting to concepts from Evolutionary Computation for simultaneous solving the tasks at hand. This work contributes to this trend by proposing a novel algorithmic scheme for dealing with multitasking environments. The proposed approach, coined as Coevolutionary Bat Algorithm, finds its inspiration in concepts from both co-evolutionary strategies and the metaheuristic Bat Algorithm. We compare the performance of our proposed method with that of its Multifactorial Evolutionary Algorithm counterpart over 15 different multitasking setups, composed by eight reference instances of the discrete Traveling Salesman Problem. The experimentation and results stemming therefrom support the main hypothesis of this study: the proposed Coevolutionary Bat Algorithm is a promising meta-heuristic for solving Evolutionary Multitasking scenarios.","Osaba, Eneko; Del Ser, Javier; Yang, Xin-She; Iglesias, Andres; Galvez, Akemi",Computational Science - ICCS 2020,737,7

Their main objective is usually to establish a ranking of alternatives, where the best solution is in the first place and the worst in the last place. However, using different techniques to solve the same decisional problem may result in rankings that are not the same. How can we test their similarity? For this purpose, scientists most often use different correlation measures, which unfortunately do not fully meet their objective. In this paper, we identify the shortcomings of currently used coefficients to measure the similarity of two rankings in decision-making problems. Afterward, we present a new coefficient that is much better suited to compare the reference ranking and the tested rankings. In our proposal, positions at the top of the ranking have a more significant impact on the similarity than those further away, which is right in the decision-making domain. Finally, we show a set of numerical examples, where this new coefficient is presented as an efficient tool to compare rankings in the decision-making field.","Sałabun, Wojciech; Urbaniak, Karol",Computational Science - ICCS 2020,737,7

Here, we test for the presence of critical slowing down (CSD), which has proven to be an early warning indicator for critical transitions in a range of different systems. CSD is characterized by a buildup of autocorrelation; we therefore study the residuals of heart surface electrocardiograms (ECGs) of patients that suffered VF to investigate if we can measure positive trends in autocorrelation. We consider several methods to extract these residuals from the original signals. For three out of four VF victims, we find a significant amount of positive autocorrelation trends in the residuals, which might be explained by CSD. We show that these positive trends may not be measurable from the original body surface ECGs, but only from certain areas around the heart surface. We argue that additional experimental studies involving heart surface ECG data of subjects that did not suffer VF are required to quantify the prediction accuracy of the promising results we get from the data of VF victims.","Nannes, Berend; Quax, Rick; Ashikaga, Hiroshi; Hocini, Mélèze; Dubois, Remi; Bernus, Olivier; Haïssaguerre, Michel",Computational Science - ICCS 2020,737,7

Modeling them requires capturing timed and probabilistic behavior as well as structure dynamics. In [9], we introduced Probabilistic Timed Graph Transformation Systems (PTGTSs) as a means of modeling a high-level view of these systems of systems and provided model checking support. However, given the scale of emerging systems of systems and their often complex topologies, analyzing only small or medium size models using model checking is insufficient. To close this gap, we developed a simulator for PTGTSs that can import real-world topologies, automatically detect violations of state properties, and handle the graph pattern matching as well as time and probabilities efficiently so that complex large-scale topologies can be considered.","Zöllner, Christian; Barkowsky, Matthias; Maximova, Maria; Schneider, Melanie; Giese, Holger",Graph Transformation,737,1

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 524 patients with OSCC treated between 2000 and 2016 at the Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery of the University Hospital Muenster, Germany, were examined for the detection of HPV type 16-specific DNA (HPV16-DNA), nicotine and alcohol consumption and the influence of therapy on overall survival (OS). RESULTS: There was a significant increase in the annual prevalence of HPV16-DNA-positive OSCC from 40% (n = 12/30) in 2000 to 46% (n = 18/39) in 2016 (p = 0.025, β = 0.539). Of the HPV16-DNA-positive OSCC, 89% (n = 212) were downgraded on the basis of UICC 8 compared to UICC 7. In the overall collective, frequent alcohol and nicotine (≥ 10 pack years) consumption showed a significant negative influence on OS (p = 0.004 and p = 0.009, respectively). Frequent alcohol consumption was also prognostically relevant in the HPV16-DNA-negative group (p = 0.049). In the HPV16-DNA-positive group, the prognosis for OS according to UICC 8 showed no statistically significant difference between stages I and II (p = 0,481), or between III and IV (p = 0.439). CONCLUSIONS: The current UICC 8 improves the prognostic stratification of OSCC due to the separation of HPV-positive and HPV-negative tumors in comparison to UICC 7. However, the prognostic significance of UICC 8 for HPV-associated OSCC is still insufficient. In the future, alcohol and nicotine consumption could influence the UICC classification in order to further improve prognostic significance.","Riders, A.; Oberste, M.; Abbaspour, B.; Beule, A.; Rudack, C.",HNO,737,20

This has created the need to develop better and reusable protective masks with built-in antimicrobial, self-cleaning, and aerosol filtration properties to prevent the transmission of air-borne pathogens such as the coronaviruses. Herein, molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) nanosheets are used to prepare modified polycotton fabrics having excellent antibacterial activity and photothermal properties. Upon sunlight irradiation, the nanosheet-modified fabrics rapidly increased the surface temperature to ∼77 °C, making them ideal for sunlight-mediated self-disinfection. Complete self-disinfection of the nanosheet-modified fabric was achieved within 3 min of irradiation, making the fabrics favorably reusable upon self-disinfection. The nanosheet-modified fabrics maintained the antibacterial efficiency even after 60 washing cycles. Furthermore, the particle filtration efficiency of three-layered surgical masks was found to be significantly improved through incorporation of the MoS2-modified fabric as an additional layer of protective clothing, without compromising the breathability of the masks. The repurposed surgical masks could filter out around 97% of 200 nm particles and 96% of 100 nm particles, thus making them potentially useful for preventing the spread of coronaviruses (120 nm) by trapping them along with antibacterial protection against other airborne pathogens.","Kumar, Praveen; Roy, Shounak; Sarkar, Ankita; Jaiswal, Amit",ACS applied materials & interfaces,737,11

METHODS A systematic search in PubMed and Embase was performed according to PRISMA-guidelines. Studies reporting symptoms were included. Methodological quality was assessed by the MINORS-tool. Primary outcomes were symptom relief, symptomatic recurrence and quality of life, for which a meta-analysis of proportions was performed.

Therefore, cost-effectiveness analysis in making decisions regarding health and safety is an ethical necessity. We report here cost-effectiveness estimation based on comparison of three independent methods: (1) by analyzing salaries in risky occupations, (2) by assuming that people value their lives twice more than the wealth they earn, and (3) by comparing with the U.S. current legal practice. To the best of our knowledge, nobody applied method (2) to cost-effectiveness analysis. Our result is that the cost-effectiveness threshold for the developed countries is about US$60,000 +/- 25,000 per life-year (LY), or about 1.0 +/- 0.4 GDP (gross domestic product) per capita per LY. Therefore, a sum of not higher than US$85,000 (1.4 GDP per capita) is statistically sufficient to 'purchase' an additional year of life - or, alternatively, to 'rob' one year of life if taken away.

Spatially resolved mathematical and statistical models can help investigators identify sites at highest risk of future transmission and prioritize these for inclusion in trials. Models can also characterize the uncertainty in whether transmission will occur at a site, and how nearby or connected sites may have correlated outcomes. A structure is needed for how trials can use models to address key design questions, including how to prioritize sites, the optimal number of sites, and how to allocate participants across sites. Methods: We illustrate the added value of models using the motivating example of Zika vaccine trial planning during the 2015-2017 Zika epidemic. We used a stochastic, spatially resolved, agent-based transmission model (GLEAM) to generate 1,142 epidemics and site-level incidence at 100 high-risk sites in the Americas. We considered several strategies for prioritizing sites (average site-level incidence of infection across epidemics, median incidence, probability of exceeding 1% incidence), selecting the number of sites, and allocating sample size across sites (equal enrollment, proportional to average incidence, proportional to rank). To evaluate each design, we stochastically simulated trials in each hypothetical epidemic by drawing observed cases from site-level incidence data. Results: When constraining the overall trial sample size, the optimal number of sites represents a balance between prioritizing highest-risk sites and having enough sites to reduce the chance of observing too few endpoints. The optimal number of sites remained roughly constant despite varying the targeted number of events, although it is necessary to increase the total sample size to achieve the desired power. Though different ranking strategies returned different site orders, they performed similarly with respect to trial power. Instead of enrolling participants equally from each site, investigators can allocate participants proportional to projected incidence, though this did not provide an advantage in our example because the top sites had a roughly similar risk profile. Sites from the same geographic region may have similar outcomes, so optimal combinations of sites may be those that are more geographically dispersed, even when these are not the highest ranked sites. Conclusions: Mathematical and statistical models may assist in the design of successful vaccination trials by capturing uncertainty and correlation in future transmission. Although many factors affect site selection, such as logistical feasibility, models can help investigators optimize site selection and the number and size of participating sites.","Madewell, Z.

IoT-enabled healthcare has revolutionized healthcare delivery by moving toward a more pervasive, patient-centered, and preventive care model. In the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, it has also shown a great potential for effective remote patient health monitoring and management, which leads to preventing straining the healthcare system. Nevertheless, due to the heterogeneity of data sources and technologies, IoT-enabled healthcare systems often operate in vertical silos, hampering interoperability across different systems. Consequently, such sensory data are rarely shared nor integrated, which can undermine the full potential of IoT-enabled healthcare. Applying semantic technologies to IoT is a promising approach for fulfilling heterogeneity, contextualization, and situation-awareness requirements for real-time healthcare solutions. However, the enrichment of sensor streams has been under-explored in the existing literature. There is also a need for an ontology that enables effective patient health monitoring and management during infectious disease outbreaks. This study, therefore, aims to extend the existing ontology to allow patient health monitoring for the prevention, early detection, and mitigation of patient deterioration. We evaluated the extended ontology using competency questions and illustrated a proof-of-concept of ontology-based semantic representation of vital sign streams.

We designed and implemented a quality improvement perioperative program for minimally invasive gynecologic oncology surgery (MIGOS). Our aim was to improve SDD rate from 30% to 75% over the study period, while maintaining acceptable 30-day perioperative outcomes and patient experience. Consecutive patients undergoing minimally invasive hysterectomy at a single cancer centre were included during the 9-month project period and a historical cohort of 100 consecutive patients was identified for comparison. A team of gynecologic oncologists, anesthesiologists, and nurses developed a comprehensive perioperative care program and met bi-weekly to revise interventions through plan-do-study-act (PDSA) cycles. Patients were followed for 30 days after discharge. We conducted a descriptive analysis of the characteristics of pre-MIGOS and MIGOS patient cohorts using Wilcoxon rank-sum or Fisher exact tests. We used a run chart to monitor effects of interventions on outcomes and a pre-post analysis to evaluate for statistical significance of change in SDD and perioperative outcomes. We assessed 100 consecutive pre-MIGOS and 79 consecutive MIGOS patients. Overall SDD rates increased from 31% (31/100) to 71% (56/79) after implementation (p<0.001) (Figure 1). There was a consistent increase in SDD rate after implementation, although more pronounced following the start of the COVID pandemic. The MIGOS cohort was significantly younger (59 vs. 65;p=0.04) and had shorter operative times (168 vs. 202 minutes;p<0.001) but the two groups were not different with respect to BMI, comorbidity, stage distribution, type of procedure performed, and intraoperative blood loss. We found no difference in 30-day perioperative complication rates, readmission, reoperation, clinic visits, emergency department visits, mortality or morbidity. The most common reason for overnight admission was nausea and vomiting (35%), complications related to pre-existing comorbidities (15%) and urinary retention (10%). Overall, 89% of MIGOS patients rated their experience as 'very good' or 'excellent', and 87% felt that their post-operative length of stay was adequate. [Display omitted] Following implementation of a perioperative quality improvement program targeted towards minimally invasive gynecologic oncology surgery, a multidisciplinary team significantly improved SDD rates while maintaining low 30-day perioperative complications and excellent patient experience.

For an introductory soil science course with 178 students enrolled, we used a narrative format supported by 360° ground-level and drone photos, newspaper articles, videos, websites, and landscape diagrams. After reading the narratives, the students took a quiz and then visited the sites (public parks near campus) on their own. For the advanced pedology course with seven students enrolled, a virtual trip replaced an all-day field trip that travels a 100-mile route from West Lafayette to Michigan City, IN. The virtual trip was created within the Soil Explorer platform and consists of &gt;50 points of interest (POIs) overlayed on detailed soil maps. Each POI includes relevant information about the soils, agriculture, geology, geomorphology, or history at that point. At two POIs students examined four or five soils along two transects by filling in worksheets using the official series descriptions. Learning was facilitated by a study guide. Effectiveness was assessed by anonymous surveys. Students found the hybrid-virtual or fully virtual field trips informative, interesting, enjoyable, and appropriate given the pandemic. For the introductory class, 42% preferred a virtual field trip format, 39% preferred an in-person format, and 19% were neutral. In the advanced class there was with a clear preference for in-person field trips.","Schulze, Darrell G.; Rahmani, Shams R.; Minai, Joshua O.; Johnston, Cliff T.; Fulk-Bringman, Sherry S.; Scott, John R.; Kong, Ningning Nicole Li Yue Shirley Mashtare Michael L.; Jr.,",Natural Sciences Education,737,1

It also has an impact on the environment. In order to systematically assess the impact of COVID-19 on the environment and the reasons for this impact, this paper takes Chengdu as an example for research. The air quality in Chengdu is analysed from two aspects of time and space, two dimensions of longitudinal and transverse. This paper selects six air pollution indexes (PM2.5, PM10, NO2, CO, SO2, O-3)and applies the dual-weight fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method to analyse. The results show that, no matter what the angle is, the air quality in Chengdu has greatly improved during the COVID-19 blockade and the concentration of various pollutants has been greatly reduced. But it's worth thinking about that this situation is always temporary from a longitudinal perspective. With the unblocking and the restoration of industrial production, the air pollution situation begins to return to previous state. This paper provides a reference for studying the changes in air quality during the COVID-19 pandemic and provides a useful supplement for air pollution control.","Deng, F. M.; Zhang, H. J.; Ma, X.

Our preceding pilot data identified six high-yield topics for this setting: venous thromboembolism, oncologic emergencies, sickle cell disease, hematologic emergencies, brain metastases, and spinal metastases. This study objective was to determine if the addition of educational screencasts on these six topics would be an effective educational intervention for trainees on a busy HOS. METHODS: All internal medicine residents scheduled to start a rotation on an HOS were eligible. Participants underwent block randomization to the usual educational curriculum either with screencast access (treatment) or without it (control). Allocation was concealed but participants were not blinded. Upon completion of the rotation, all participants received an anonymous online survey about their experiences. The primary outcome was the change in attitude among learners, measured as their self-reported confidence for managing the clinical topics that were covered. All randomized participants received a $20 gift certificate upon completion of the study. Exploratory data was also collected from medical students, fellows, and faculty who opted to participate;they were given access to the screencasts without randomization. RESULTS: Over the 29 week study period (12/9/2019 - 6/30/2020), 67 out of 78 eligible residents (86%) opted to participate;these 67 residents all underwent randomization and were analyzed by intention-to-treat. Enrollment continued to completion of the study. The final participant response rate was high at 91%. Demographic characteristics were well-matched between the arms with the exception of a higher prevalence of male gender (72% vs. 42%, p=0.022) in the screencast arm. The majority (64%) of residents in the screencast arm rated their clinical management comfort level as either “comfortable” or “very comfortable” as compared to just 21% of residents in the usual education arm (p = 0.0008), estimated difference = 43%, (95% CI 21%,66%) using a prespecified cumulative cutoff score. Nearly all participants on the screencast arm either agreed or strongly agreed that the screencasts improved their knowledge base in medical oncology (100%), will improve their care for cancer patients (92%), and enjoyed the format (96%). Most participants on the screencast arm felt that the intervention was optimal in terms of content (96%), length (82%), and accessibility (63%). Preferred viewing speed for the screencasts was 1.5x (52%). Nearly all participants felt that a similar database of screencasts would be helpful for all of their clinical rotations (96%). Medical knowledge as tested by a series of 6 clinical vignette multiple-choice questions was not different between the screencast and control arms (percentage correct: 77% vs. 80%, p=0.56). Burnout as tested by the Maslach Burnout Inventory was not different between the screencast and control arms in terms of total score (71 ± 12 vs. 69 ± 13, p=0.67) or personal accomplishment subscale (46 vs. 45, p=0.71). Exploratory data was also collected from 6 medical students, 8 fellows, and 6 attendings. Half of the students (50%) recommended the screencasts for the IM clerkship. Most fellows and faculty were neutral as to their interest in producing their own educational screencasts (77%) or contributing to a similar project (54%). CONCLUSIONS Resident trainees on a busy inpatient adult hematology-oncology service (HOS) found that a JiTT screencast series increased their clinical comfort level in the management of critical and commonly encountered patient problems unique to the HOS. The screencast content and delivery was overwhelmingly positive with nearly all (96%) wanting screencast series to be created for all their clinical rotations. Furthermore, as evidenced by the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020, novel distance and asynchronous learning platforms may be of increasing importance when raditional in-person methods are not feasible.

Design Cross-sectional study Methods Runners with (n=11) and without (n=13) AT were recruited. Plantar flexor isometric peak torque and rate of torque development (RTD) were measured using an isokinetic dynamometer. Triceps surae endurance was measured as single leg heel raise (SLHR) to failure test. Short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) was assessed using paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation during a sustained contraction at 10% of plantar flexor isometric peak torque. Results AT presented 13.41% (95%CI:0.76 to 26.0) higher Triceps surae SICI, 68% inhibition (95%CI:58.5 to 76.4) compared to 55% inhibition in the control group (95%CI:45.1 to 63.0). AT performed 28%, -12.6 (95%CI:-19.4 to -5.7, p=0.001) fewer SLHR repetitions on the most symptomatic side, 27.5 (95%CI:20.7 to 34.3), compared to controls, 38.5 (95% CI:33.2 to 43.8) and 24%, -10.9 (95%CI:-18.4 to -3.3, p=0.008), fewer SLHR repetitions on the non-symptomatic, 29.0 (95%CI:19.4 to 38.6) compared to controls, 38.5 (95%CI:33.2 to 43.8). We found no between-groups differences in isometric peak torque or RTD. Conclusion Our data suggest greater intracortical inhibition for the Triceps surae muscles for the AT group ac-companied by reduced SLHR endurance, without deficits in isometric peak torque or RTD. The increased SICI observed in the AT group could be negatively influencing Triceps surae endurance; thus, rehabilitation aiming to reduce intracortical inhibition should be considered to improve patient outcomes. Furthermore, SLHR is a useful clinical tool to assess plantar flexor function in AT patients.

Strategies involving the isolation of close contacts can lead to high levels of absences, negatively impacting pupils. Methods We fit a stochastic individual-based model of secondary schools to both community swab testing data and secondary school absences data. By simulating epidemics in secondary schools from 31st August 2020 until 21st May 2021, we quantify within-school transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in secondary schools in England, the impact of twice weekly mass testing on within-school transmission, and the potential impact of alternative strategies to the isolation of close contacts in reducing pupil absences. Findings The within-school reproduction number, R school , has remained below 1 from 31st August 2020 until 21st May 2021. Twice weekly mass testing using LFTs have helped to control within-school transmission in secondary schools in England. A strategy of serial contact testing alongside mass testing substantially reduces absences compared to strategies involving isolating close contacts, with only a marginal increase in within-school transmission. Interpretation Secondary school control strategies involving mass testing have the potential to control within-school transmission while substantially reducing absences compared to an isolation of close contacts policy.","Leng, T.; Hill, E.

In October 2019 Salisbury District Hospital (SDH) piloted a successful ‘hold-the-bleep’ simulation day for 5th year Southampton medical students. In March 2020, in response to COVID-19, medical students were given early registration. The majority of FiY1s had not received or missed out on formal bleep training due to graduating early.MethodologyOver 2 days 8 FiY1s were issued with a bleep for a half-day period, continuing normal daily tasks whilst being bleeped for phone advice or to assess a simulated patient. 4 clinical stations and 4 phone calls were designed to simulate roles of FY1s with SIM-Man simulating the patients. Immediate feedback was recorded and generic themes discussed at a structured session, discussing what went well or was challenging. Each FiY1 completed a feedback for assessing confidence and wrote a reflective piece.ResultsFeedback was qualitatively and quantitatively positive. All found the SIM session useful and would recommend it. 7 of 8 candidates had a numerical increase in confidence in managing and prioritising calls.Conclusions and recommendationsThe stations addressed communication skills, prioritisation, clinical and practical skills, and drug prescribing. The improvement in FiY1s confidence and skills is likely to lead to improved patient outcome and satisfaction. Faculty who role played, reported an improvement in the trainees’ performance.

The inhibition of the activity of the two key cytokines, IFNγ and IL-6, can significantly reduce or even reverse the development of the cytokine storm. The objective of our investigations is to reveal the anti-inflammatory potential of heparin for prevention and suppression of the development of CRS in acute COVID-19 patients. The effect of low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) on IFNγ signalling inside the stimulated WISH cells was investigated by measuring its antiproliferative activity and the translocation of phosphorylated STAT1 in the nucleus. The mechanism of heparin binding to IFNγ and IL-6 and therefore inhibition of their activity was studied by means of extensive molecular-dynamics simulations. We find that LMWH binds with high affinity to IFNγ and is able to inhibit fully the interaction with its cellular receptor. It also influences the biological activity of IL-6 by binding to either IL-6 or IL-6/IL-6Rα thus preventing the formation of the IL-6/IL-6Rα/gp130 signaling complex. Our conclusion is that heparin is a potent anti-inflammatory agent that can be used in acute inflammatory conditions, due to its potential to inhibit both IFN γ and IL-6 signalling pathways. Based on our results and available clinical observations, we suggest the administration of LMWH to COVID-19 patients in the initial stages of the acute phase. The beginning of the treatment and the dosage should be based on a careful follow-up of the platelet count and the D-dimer, IL-6, IFN, T-cells, and B-cells levels.","Litov, Leandar; Petkov, Peicho; Rangelov, Miroslav; Ilieva, Nevena; Lilkova, Elena; Todorova, Nadezhda; Krachmarova, Elena; Malinova, Kristina; Gospodinov, Anastas; Hristova, Rossitsa; Ivanov, Ivan; Nacheva, Genoveva",bioRxiv,737,25

However, they represent a heterogeneous group of individuals with variable risk. Identification of vulnerable subgroups is important for prioritization of vaccination strategies and possible early therapeutic intervention after infection. Methods: Tumor pts. with PCRconfirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were included in the multicentric ADHOK registry by 22 institutions. Detailed information about tumor disease and treatment, as well as routine laboratory parameters determined at least 10 days prior to SARS-CoV-2 infection, was collected retrospectively. The primary endpoint was defined as the outcome of the SARS-CoV-2 infection, graded according to the WHO: asymptomatic, mild, moderate, severe, critical, and COVID-19-related death. Results: Until Feb. 5, 2021, 215 pts. (67% with solid tumors, 33% with hematological neoplasms) were included in the registry. 74% of the pts. had an active malignancy. The course of SARS-CoV-2 infection was rather variable: 66% of the pts. remained asymptomatic or showed a mildto- moderate course, while the rest developed severe or critical disease. The COVID-19-related mortality rate was 24%. Pre-infection routine laboratory values were available for 104 pts., obtained at a median of 21 days before SARSCoV- 2 infection. Compared to COVID-19 survivors, COVID-19 non-survivors showed significantly higher median levels of absolute neutrophil count (ANC: 3.6 vs. 6.4 /nL;p = 0.006, n = 91), neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR: 2.2 vs. 7.2;p = 0.005, n = 75), C-reactive protein (CRP: 9.9 vs. 42.0 mg/L;p = 0.001, n = 104), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH: 213.0 vs. 267.0 U/L;p = 0.016, n = 78). When categorized by a median split, COVID-19 mortality was significantly higher in pts. with ANC &gt; 4.4 /nL (4% vs. 55%, p &lt; 0.001), NLR &gt; 4.1 (5% vs. 58%, p &lt; 0.001), CRP &gt; 15.4 mg/L (18% vs. 46%, p = 0.003), LDH &gt; 236 U/L (15% vs. 49%, p = 0.003) and lymphocytes &lt; 1.3 /nL (41% vs. 11% p = 0.002). In multivariable analysis, ANC and CRP showed a strong and significant association with COVID-19-related death (OR 23.0 and 7.7, p = 0.007 and 0.029, respectively). To develop an easy-to-apply preinfection score, we combined ANC and CRP and were able to separate three groups of pts. With significantly different COVID-19 outcomes (p &lt; 0.001) (Table). Conclusions: Our results unveil subgroups of tumor pts. who may be at increased risk of severe COVID-19 and point to preinfection routine laboratory parameters with potential prognostic power: ANC and CRP may help identify pts. at risk for severe COVID-19 before SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Roesch, R.; Suedhoff, T.; Wendtner, C.

Students learn more when they feel well, and the way we shape education influences the way students feel. The COVID-19 crisis has forced us to radically change our design education and is having a large impact on student wellbeing and learning. While some students manage well to adapt to the new circumstances, others struggle and face challenges such as risk of burnout, lack of motivation, and social isolation. In this paper we describe how we approached this challenge by applying methods and principles from strategic human-centred design and systems thinking. The strategic design approach included researching values and patterns in student and staff experiences. The systems approach meant that we saw the university as a complex adaptive system, which focused our activities on connecting staff and students who were and are running multiple creative experiments to promote student wellbeing. This approach is strategic because it supports continuous design and implementation of initiatives to promote wellbeing.

Amongst other things, one of the most remarkable repercussions of the lockdown was the closing of the educational system. The call to reopen the public schools by the Minister of Basic Education after almost 2 months brought contestations from different sects of life, for instance, labour unions, parents and School Governing Body (SGB) representatives. Mistrust and suspicions developed amongst parents, SGB’s unions and the Department of Basic Education as a result. This has seen certain political parties and unions lodging court cases against the reopening decision. This was likely to be a protracted battle as the issue is between life and education.

Drink Less is a theory- and evidence-informed app to help people reduce their alcohol consumption that has been refined in terms of its content and design for usability across the socio-demographic spectrum. We aim to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of recommending Drink Less at reducing alcohol consumption compared with usual digital care. Design: Two-arm individually randomised controlled trial. Setting: Online trial in the UK. Participants: Hazardous or harmful drinkers (Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test score >=8) aged 18+, and want to drink less alcohol (n=5,562). Participants will be recruited from July 2020 to May 2022 using multiple strategies with a focus on remote digital methods. Intervention and comparator: Participants will be randomised to receive either an email recommending that they use Drink Less (intervention) or view the NHS webpage on alcohol advice (comparator). Measurements: The primary outcome is change in self-reported weekly alcohol consumption between baseline and 6-month follow-up. Secondary outcomes include the proportion of hazardous drinkers; alcohol-related problems and injury; health-related quality of life, and use of health services assessed at 6-month follow-up. Effectiveness will be examined with one-way ANCOVAs, adjusting for baseline alcohol consumption, and using an intention-to-treat approach. A mixed-methods process evaluation will assess engagement, acceptability and mechanism of action. Economic evaluations will be conducted using both a short- and longer-term time horizon.

Here, we introduce the epidemicity index e0, a threshold-type indicator: if e0 > 0, initial foci may cause infection peaks even if [Formula: see text]. Therefore, effective containment measures should achieve a negative epidemicity index. We use spatially explicit models to rank containment measures for projected evolutions of the ongoing pandemic in Italy. There, we show that, while the effective reproduction number was below one for a sizable timespan, epidemicity remained positive, allowing recurrent infection flare-ups well before the major epidemic rebounding observed in the fall.","Mari, Lorenzo; Casagrandi, Renato; Bertuzzo, Enrico; Pasetto, Damiano; Miccoli, Stefano; Rinaldo, Andrea; Gatto, Marino",Nat Commun,737,33

This is the second Brazilian record for this molossid, and it is the first documentation from the Caatinga biome. This bat is a common roof dweller in Jaiba, and was frequently captured in nets set near bodies of water. Numbers of individuals found at roosts were small ( 10), and included reproductively active females in a harem-like formation (single-male with multi-females). Reproductive activity was associated with the rainy season, and there was within-group synchronization of pregnancy. Specimens captured away from roosts were obtained in nets set over or adjacent to water sources in habitats ranging from anthropic fields to well preserved arboreal caatingas. A mensural analysis based on 17 specimens (12 females and 5 males) confirmed secondary sexual dimorphism (5 out of 10 variables), and revealed little size variation among localities from Brazil and Central America. M. pretiosus is similar to M. rufus but averages smaller in size. M. pretiosus is the fourth bat species that, in Brazil, is restricted to the open habitats, such as the Caatinga, Cerrado, and Pantanal that separate the forested habitats of Amazonia and Mata Atlantica.","R.

DESIGN: We conducted a systematic review to update and summarise evidence on trends in health expectancies, in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) high-income countries. DATA SOURCES: Four electronic databases (MEDLINE, 1946-19 September 2019; Embase 1980-2019 week 38; Scopus 1966-22 September 2019, Health Management Information Consortium, 1979-September 2019), and the UK Office for National Statistics website (November 2019). ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: English language studies published from 2016 that reported trends in healthy, active and/or disability-free life expectancy in an OECD high-income country. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Records were screened independently by two researchers. Study quality was assessed using published criteria designed to identify sources of bias in studies reporting trends, and evidence summarised by narrative synthesis. FINDINGS: Twenty-eight publications from 11 countries were included, covering periods from 6 to 40 years, between 1970 and 2017. In most countries, gains in healthy and disability-free life expectancy do not match the growth in total life expectancy. Exceptions were demonstrated for women in Sweden, where there were greater gains in disability-free years than life expectancy. Gains in healthy and disability-free life expectancy were greater for men than women in most countries except the USA (age 85), Japan (birth), Korea (age 65) and Sweden (age 77). CONCLUSION: An expansion of disability in later life is evident in a number of high-income countries, with implications for the sustainability of health and care systems. The recent COVID-19 pandemic may also impact health expectancies in the longer term.","Spiers, Gemma F; Kunonga, Tafadzwa Patience; Beyer, Fiona; Craig, Dawn; Hanratty, Barbara; Jagger, Carol",BMJ Open,737,22

METHODS: The presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the air and on environmental surfaces around hospitalised patients, with and without respiratory symptoms, was investigated. Environmental sampling was carried out within eight hospitals in England during the first wave of the COVID-19 outbreak. Samples were analysed using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and virus isolation assays. FINDINGS: SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected on 30 (8.9%) of 336 environmental surfaces. Ct values ranged from 28·8 to 39·1 equating to 2·2 x 105 to 59 genomic copies/swab. Concomitant bacterial counts were low, suggesting the cleaning performed by nursing and domestic staff across all eight hospitals was effective. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in four of 55 air samples taken <1 m from four different patients. In all cases, the concentration of viral RNA was low and ranged from <10 to 460 genomic copies per m3 of air. Infectious virus was not recovered from any of the PCR positive samples analysed. CONCLUSIONS: Effective cleaning can reduce the risk of fomite (contact) transmission but some surface types may facilitate the survival, persistence and/or dispersal of SARS-CoV-2. The presence of low or undetectable concentrations of viral RNA in the air supports current guidance on the use of specific PPE ensembles for aerosol and non-aerosol generating procedures.","Moore, Ginny; Rickard, Helen; Stevenson, David; Bou, Paz Aranega; Pitman, James; Crook, Ant; Davies, Katherine; Spencer, Antony; Burton, Chris; Easterbrook, Linda; Love, Hannah E; Summers, Sian; Welch, Stephen R; Wand, Nadina; Thompson, Katy-Anne; Pottage, Thomas; Richards, Kevin S; Dunning, Jake; Bennett, Allan",J. hosp. infect,737,16

Our aim was to compare the change in the care delivered in a rheumatology nursing consultation before and during the pandemic. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Descriptive and observational study. Patient care was registered before and during the COVID-19 outbreak. The variables collected were age, sex, prevalent rheumatic disease, type of visit and reason for consultation. RESULTS: 254 consecutive patients were included before the COVID-19 pandemic for 20 days and 251 patients during COVID-19 for 10 working days. The mean age was 61 years before and 57 during the pandemic. Of both groups, 74% were women. The most frequently attended pathologies before and during COVID-19 were rheumatoid arthritis and spondyloarthropathies. Scheduled face-to-face visits decreased during COVID-19 (46.5% versus 1.6%), with an increased number of phone scheduled visits (2.8% versus 52.2%) and spontaneous consultations either by phone or e-mail (28.3% versus 45%). The type of scheduled visits during COVID-19 were for stable diseases (20% versus 37%) and monitoring (12% versus 38%). The reason for spontaneous consultation increased during COVID-19 and were mainly doubts regarding prevention measures and treatment optimization (13.8% versus 31.1%).

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional questionnaire-based study over 6 weeks during a federally mandated lockdown. Using snowball sampling, we recruited paediatric surgeons, trainees and medical officers from paediatric surgical units in Malaysia. The anonymous online questionnaire covered sociodemographic information, changes in patient care, redeployment, concerns regarding family members, and impact on training. Mental well-being was assessed using the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21). Kruskal-Wallis, ANOVA and multiple regression analysis was used, with significance level 0.05. RESULTS: Of the 129 eligible participants, 100(77%) responded. Junior doctors had clinically higher levels of depression, anxiety, and stress. Age &lt;30 years was significantly associated with anxiety. Junior doctors believed that redeployment led to loss of surgical skills (p&lt;0.001) and trainees felt that clinical application of knowledge had reduced (p&lt;0.020). CONCLUSION: Specific to our paediatric surgical community, this study highlights areas of concern, particularly among junior doctors. It is likely that recurrent cycles of the pandemic will occur soon. These issues must be addressed to preserve the mental and emotional well-being of all health care workers.","Mahat, N.; Zubaidi, S.

However, the wide range of possible CXR abnormalities makes it impractical to build specific systems to detect every possible condition. In this work, we developed and evaluated an AI system to classify CXRs as normal or abnormal. For development, we used a de-identified dataset of 248,445 patients from a multi-city hospital network in India. To assess generalizability, we evaluated our system using 6 international datasets from India, China, and the United States. Of these datasets, 4 focused on diseases that the AI was not trained to detect: 2 datasets with tuberculosis and 2 datasets with coronavirus disease 2019. Our results suggest that the AI system generalizes to new patient populations and abnormalities. In a simulated workflow where the AI system prioritized abnormal cases, the turnaround time for abnormal cases reduced by 7-28%.

The aim of this case report was to identify whether this variant is a double plantaris or a third head of the gastrocnemius according to its morphological characteristics and innervation. METHODS: The muscles were displayed by careful dissection and delineation of surrounding structures. The size of each of the muscle bellies and tendons of those extra muscles were measured manually by the vernier caliper. RESULTS: The origin of each extra muscle was lateral to the tibial nerve and superior to the plantaris, and each extra muscle which transitioned to a descending tendon parallel to the plantaris had a cone-shaped belly. However, the tendon of the extra muscles was fused into the investing fascia of the gastrocnemius with a tendon length of 4.5 cm on the left and 4.6 cm on the right. The extra muscles were innervated by the branch of the tibial nerve to the medial head of the gastrocnemius on both sides. CONCLUSION: Although they had an origin and shape similar to that of the plantaris, we identified the extra muscles in this case as a third head of the gastrocnemius, because of innervation to the plantaris arises directly from the tibial nerve. This case highlighted that the innervation is essential to understanding the myogenesis of extra muscles, especially in cases which are difficult to categorize based on the morphological features of the muscle.","Ishii, Takaya; Kawagishi, Kyutaro; Hayashi, Shogo; Yamada, Shinnosuke; Yoshioka, Hirotaka; Matsuno, Yoshiharu; Mori, Yasutake; Kosaka, Jun",,737,21

Subsequently, states enacted stay-at-home orders to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, and reduce the burden on the U.S. health care system. CDC* and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) recommended that health care systems prioritize urgent visits and delay elective care to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 in health care settings. By May 2020, national syndromic surveillance data found that emergency department (ED) visits had declined 42% during the early months of the pandemic (1). This report describes trends in ED visits for three acute life-threatening health conditions (myocardial infarction [MI, also known as heart attack], stroke, and hyperglycemic crisis), immediately before and after declaration of the COVID-19 pandemic as a national emergency. These conditions represent acute events that always necessitate immediate emergency care, even during a public health emergency such as the COVID-19 pandemic. In the 10 weeks following the emergency declaration (March 15-May 23, 2020), ED visits declined 23% for MI, 20% for stroke, and 10% for hyperglycemic crisis, compared with the preceding 10-week period (January 5-March 14, 2020). EDs play a critical role in diagnosing and treating life-threatening conditions that might result in serious disability or death. Persons experiencing signs or symptoms of serious illness, such as severe chest pain, sudden or partial loss of motor function, altered mental state, signs of extreme hyperglycemia, or other life-threatening issues, should seek immediate emergency care, regardless of the pandemic.

No vaccine treatment has been defined against SARS-CoV2 or other human coronaviruses (HCoVs), including those causing epidemic infections, neither appropriate strategies for prevention and care are yet officially suggested. Scope and approach: .We reviewed scientific literature on natural compounds that were defined as potentially effective against human coronaviruses. Our desk research identified non-chemically modified natural compounds that were shown (in vitro) and/or predicted (in silico) to act against one or more phases of human coronaviruses cell cycle.We selected all available information, merged and annotated the data to define a comprehensive list of natural compounds, describing their chemical classification, the source, the action, the specific target in the viral infection. Our aim was to collect possible compounds for prevention and care against human coronaviruses. Key findings and conclusions: .The definition of appropriate interventions against viral diseases need a comprehensive view on the infection dynamics and on necessary treatments. Viral targeting compounds to be exploited in food sciences could be of relevant interest to this aim.We collected 174 natural compounds showing effects against human infecting coronaviruses, providing a curated annotation on actions and targets.The data are available in anti-HCoV, a web accessible resource to be exploited for testing and in vivo trials. The website is here launched to favour a community based cooperative effort to call for contribution and expand the collection.

Our goal was to describe clinical outcomes of COVID-19 inpatients regarding the presence of abnormal liver tests and CLD. Methods: A retrospective analysis of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, hospitalized in a tertiary center in Portugal, was performed. Studied outcomes were disease and hospitalization length, COVID-19 severity, admission to intensive care unit (ICU) and mortality, analyzed by the presence of abnormal liver tests and CLD. Results: We included 317 inpatients with a mean age of 70.4 years, 50.5% males. COVID-19 severity was moderate to severe in 57.4% and critical in 12.9%. The mean disease length was 37.8 days, the median hospitalization duration 10.0 days and overall mortality 22.8%. At admission, 50.3% showed abnormal liver tests, and 41.5% showed elevated aminotransferase levels, from which 75.4% were mild. Elevated aminotransferase levels at admission were associated with COVID-19 severity (78.7 vs. 63.3%, p = 0.01), ICU admission (13.1 vs. 5.92%, p = 0.034) and increased mortality (25.8 vs. 13.3%, p = 0.007). However, in a subgroup analysis, only aspartate transaminase (AST) was associated with these worse outcomes. Alkaline phosphatase was elevated in 11.4% of the patients and was associated with critical COVID-19 (21.1 vs. 9.92%, p = 0.044) and mortality (20.4 vs. 9.52%, p = 0.025), while 24.6% of the patients showed elevated γ-glutamyl transferase, which was associated with ICU admission (42.3 vs. 22.8%, p = 0.028). Fourteen patients had baseline CLD (4.42%), 3 with liver cirrhosis. Alcohol (n = 6) and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (n = 6) were the most frequent etiologies. CLD patients had critical COVID-19 in 21.4% (p = 0.237), mean disease length of 36.6 days (p = 0.291), median hospitalization duration of 11.5 days (p = 0.447) and a mortality rate of 28.6% (p = 0.595), which increased to 66.7% among cirrhotic patients (p = 0.176). Conclusions: Liver test abnormalities in COVID-19 patients were frequent but most commonly mild. AST, but not alanine transaminase, was associated with worse clinical outcomes, such as COVID-19 severity and mortality, probably indicating these outcomes were independent of liver injury. A low prevalence of CLD was seen, and a clear impact on COVID-19 outcomes was not seen.","Garrido, Mónica Tiago Pereira Guedes Joana Alves Silva Falcão Daniela Novo Inês Archer Sara Rocha Marta Maia Luís Sarmento-Castro Rui Pedroto Isabel",Portuguese Journal of Gastroenterology,737,16

Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to determine the diagnostic value of ssDNA. In patients with resectable HCC, ssDNA and &#945;-fetoprotein (AFP) levels were measured during follow-up and compared with HCC recurrence detected by imaging. Results: The median ssDNA levels were higher in HCC than in healthy individuals, cirrhosis, and chronic hepatitis (median, 23.20 vs. 9.36, 9.64, and 9.76 ng/µL, respectively, P < 0.001). ssDNA levels in HCC were higher than those in cirrhosis and chronic hepatitis (both P < 0.001); there were no differences in ssDNA levels between healthy controls and patients with cirrhosis (P = 0.15) or chronic liver disease (P = 0.39). The area under the curve of ssDNA for HCC diagnosis was 0.909 (95% CI: 0.879-0.933). The ssDNA levels decreased by 3.19-fold (P < 0.001) after HCC radical resection. In six patients, the ssDNA levels increased about 3-6 months before a recurrence was detected by AFP and imaging. Conclusions: ssDNA might be a noninvasive indicator for HCC diagnosis and prognosis. ssDNA could eventually be complementary to AFP levels and imaging, but confirmatory studies are necessary.","Zhao, Qi; Xu, Yiqiu; Yuan, Dandan; Yang, Junjun; Wang, Ying; Shen, Guorong; Huang, Xuewen",Dis Markers,737,1

The challenge for the future in dentistry education should be revised with the COVID-19 and the possibility for future pandemics, since in most countries dental students stopped attending the dental faculties as there was a general lockdown of the population. The dental teaching has an important curriculum in the clinic where patients attend general dentistry practice. However, with SARS-CoV-2 virus, people may be reluctant having a dental treatment were airborne transmission can occur in some dental procedures. In preclinical dental education, the acquisition of clinical, technical skills, and the transfer of these skills to the clinic are extremely important. Therefore, dental education has to adapt the curriculum to embrace new technology devices, instrumentations systems, haptic systems, simulation based training, 3D printer machines, to permit validation and calibration of the technical skills of dental students.","Clemente, Miguel Pais; Moreira, André; Pinto, João Correia; Amarante, José Manuel; Mendes, Joaquim",Inquiry,737,23

DESIGN: Prospective, observational, cohort study. METHODS: Forty eyes of 40 patients (mean age: 49.7 ± 12.6 years old) post-SARS-CoV-2 infection and 40 healthy subjects were enrolled in this study. COVID-19 patients had to be fully recovered from COVID-19 pneumonia and were evaluated 6 months after COVID-19 infection. The primary outcome resulted from OCTA studies of the following vascular structures: vessel density (VD) in the retinal superficial capillary plexus (SCP), deep capillary plexus (DCP), and radial peripapillary capillaries (RPC) compared to those of controls. Structural spectral domain (SD)-OCT parameters were also evaluated: ganglion cell complex (GCC) and retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL). RESULTS: The patients showed a significant reduction in VD of the SCP in whole images and in the DCP in all sectors compared to those in healthy subjects (P <.05). COVID-19 patients featured a reduced VD of the RPC compared to that in controls (P <.001). No differences were found in the GCC, whereas the RNFL was reduced in the COVID-19 group compared to that in controls (P = .012). Significant correlations were found between the RNFL and VD of the SCP, DCP, RPC, and FAZ area in the COVID-19 group (P <.05). CONCLUSIONS: OCTA showed retinal vascular changes in subjects fully recovered from COVID-19 pneumonia. These findings could be a consequence of a thrombotic microangiopathy that affected retinal structures as well as other systemic organs. OCTA could represent a valid, noninvasive biomarker of early vascular dysfunction after SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Cennamo, Gilda; Reibaldi, Michele; Montorio, Daniela; D039,; Andrea, Luca; Fallico, Matteo; Triassi, Maria",Am J Ophthalmol,737,2

We performed a systemic review of the literature to determine the prevalence of carotid artery IPH on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the vessel wall in patients with ESUS. METHODS: We used PubMed, Epub ahead of print, Ovid MEDLINE in-process and other non-indexed citations, Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid EMBASE, Ovid Cochrane central register of controlled trials, Ovid Cochrane database of systematic reviews and Scopus. Our study consisted of all case series with >10 patients with IPH and ESUS published through October 2018. Additionally, we included 123 patients from an institutional database from 2015-2019. Random effects meta-analysis was used for pooling across studies. Meta-analysis results were expressed as odds ratio (OR) with respective 95% confidence intervals (CI). RESULTS: A total of 7 studies with 354 patients were included. The mean age was 67.5 years old. The overall prevalence estimate for prevalence of IPH ipsilateral to the ischemic lesion was 25.8% (95% CI 13.1-38.5).

We sought to better determine prevalence, severity, and timing of OD in COVID-19 relative to other sinonasal and pulmonary symptoms. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective, cross-sectional. SETTING: Regional/cantonal hospital. SUBJECTS: In total, 103 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-based testing. METHODS: All patients testing positive for COVID-19 at Kantonsspital Aarau over a 6-week period were approached. Timing and severity (at its worst, on scale of 0 [none], 1 [mild], 2 [moderate], and 3 [severe]) of OD, loss of taste, nasal obstruction, rhinorrhea/mucus production, fever, cough and shortness of breath (SOB) were assessed for each patient. RESULTS: Prevalence of OD was 61.2%, and severity of OD was strongly correlated with severity of loss of taste experienced (&#961; = 0.87, P < .001). OD was experienced on the first day of COVID-19 by 8.7% and overall occurred at median infection day 3 (mean, 3.4; range, 0-12). Most experiencing OD reported anosmia, and mean severity of all with OD was moderate to severe (mean [SD], 2.7 [0.6]). Nasal obstruction (49.5%) and rhinorrhea (35.0%) were frequently reported but not correlated with OD. SOB was more severe in patients with OD. OD was associated negatively with older age (OR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.93-0.99; P = .007) and positively with female sex (OR, 2.46; 95% CI, 0.98-6.19; P = .056). CONCLUSIONS: OD is highly prevalent during COVID-19, occurring early and severely, often in conjunction with loss of taste. OD is associated negatively with older age and positively with female sex. Patients with OD may also experience more severe SOB.","Speth, Marlene M; Singer-Cornelius, Thirza; Oberle, Michael; Gengler, Isabelle; Brockmeier, Steffi J; Sedaghat, Ahmad R",Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,737,26

Those recommendations include: (1) Standard prevention and protection, and patient isolation; (2) Patient wearing mask during HFNC treatment; (3) Using dual limb ventilator with filters placed at the ventilator outlets, or using heat-moisture exchanger (HME) instead of heated humidification in single limb ventilator with HME placed between exhalation port and mask; avoid using mask with exhalation port on the mask; (4) Placing filter between resuscitator and mask or artificial airway; (5) For spontaneous breathing patients, placing mask for patients during bronchoscopy examination; for patients receiving noninvasive ventilation, using the special mask with bronchoscopy port to perform bronchoscopy; (6) Using sedation and paralytics during intubation, cuff pressure should be maintained between 25-30 cmH(2)O; (7) In-line suction catheter is recommended and it can be used for one week; (8) Dual-limb heated wire circuits are recommended and only changed with visible soiled; (9. For patients who need breathing support during transportation, placing an HME between ventilator and patient; (10) PSV is recommended for implementing spontaneous breathing trial (SBT), avoid using T-piece to do SBT. When tracheotomy patients are weaned from ventilator, HME should be used, avoid using T-piece or tracheostomy mask. (11) Avoid unnecessary bronchial hygiene therapy; (12) For patients who need aerosol therapy, dry powder inhaler metered dose inhaler with spacer is recommended for spontaneous breathing patients; while vibrating mesh nebulizer is recommended for ventilated patients and additional filter is recommended to be placed at the expiratory port of ventilation during nebulization.",,Zhonghua Jie He He Hu Xi Za Zhi,737,16

As this is a highly contagious virus, it is imperative to understand RNA-dependent-RNA-polymerase (RdRp), the key component in virus replication. Although the SARS-CoV-2 genome shares 80% sequence identity with severe acute respiratory syndrome SARS-CoV, their RdRps and nucleotidyl-transferases (NiRAN) share 98.1% and 93.2% identity, respectively. Sequence alignment of six coronaviruses demonstrated higher identity among their RdRps (60.9%-98.1%) and lower identity among their Spike proteins (27%-77%). Thus, a 3D structural model of RdRp, NiRAN, non-structural protein 7 (nsp7), and nsp8 of SARS-CoV-2 was generated by modeling starting from the SARS counterpart structures. Furthermore, we demonstrate the binding poses of three viral RdRp inhibitors (Galidesivir, Favipiravir, and Penciclovir), which were recently reported to have clinical significance for SARS-CoV-2. The network of interactions established by these drug molecules affirms their efficacy to inhibit viral RNA replication and provides an insight into their structure-based rational optimization for SARS-CoV-2 inhibition.","Zhang, Wen-Fa; Stephen, Preyesh; Thériault, Jean-François; Wang, Ruixuan; Lin, Sheng-Xiang",J Phys Chem Lett,737,2

Various epidemiological and deep learning models have been developed to predict the COVID-19 outbreak, but all have limitations that affect the accuracy and robustness of the predictions. Our method aims at addressing these limitations and making earlier and more accurate pandemic outbreak predictions by (1) using patients' EHR data from different counties and states that encode local disease status and medical resource utilization condition; (2) considering demographic similarity and geographical proximity between locations; and (3) integrating pandemic transmission dynamics into deep learning models. Materials and Methods: We proposed a spatio-temporal attention network (STAN) for pandemic prediction. It uses an attention-based graph convolutional network to capture geographical and temporal trends and predict the number of cases for a fixed number of days into the future. We also designed a physical law-based loss term for enhancing long-term prediction. STAN was tested using both massive real-world patient data and open source COVID-19 statistics provided by Johns Hopkins university across all U.S. counties. Results: STAN outperforms epidemiological modeling methods such as SIR and SEIR and deep learning models on both long-term and short-term predictions, achieving up to 87% lower mean squared error compared to the best baseline prediction model. Conclusions: By using information from real-world patient data and geographical data, STAN can better capture the disease status and medical resource utilization information and thus provides more accurate pandemic modeling.

Disease severity has been associated with increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines and lymphopenia. To elucidate the atlas of peripheral immune response and pathways that might lead to immunopathology during COVID-19 disease course, we performed a peripheral blood RNA sequencing analysis of the same patient's samples collected from symptom onset to full recovery. We found that PBMCs at different disease stages exhibited unique transcriptome characteristics. We observed that SARS-CoV-2 infection caused excessive release of inflammatory cytokines and lipid mediators as well as an aberrant increase of low-density neutrophils. Further analysis revealed an increased expression of RNA sensors and robust IFN-stimulated genes expression but a repressed type I IFN production. SARS-CoV-2 infection activated T and B cell responses during the early onset but resulted in transient adaptive immunosuppression during severe disease state. Activation of apoptotic pathways and functional exhaustion may contribute to the reduction of lymphocytes and dysfunction of adaptive immunity, whereas increase in IL2, IL7, and IL15 may facilitate the recovery of the number and function of lymphocytes.

Many studies in AD suggested beta-amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles-associated tau protein as the key targets for drug development. On the other hand, it is proved that triggering of Glycogen Synthase Kinase-3ß (GSK-3ß) also cause AD, therefore, GSK-3ß is a potential drug target to combat AD. We, in this study, investigated the ability of small molecules to inhibit GSK-3ß through virtual screening, Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion (ADME), induced-fit docking (IFD), molecular dynamics simulation, and binding free energy calculation. Besides, molecular docking was performed to reveal the binding and interaction of the ligand at the active site of GSK-3ß. We found two compounds such as 6961 and 6966, which exhibited steady-state interaction with GSK-3ß for 30 ns in molecular dynamics simulation. The compounds (6961 and 6966) also achieved a docking score of -9.05 kcal/mol and -8.11 kcal/mol, respectively, which is relatively higher than the GSK-3ß II inhibitor (-6.73 kcal/mol). The molecular dynamics simulation revealed that the compounds have a stable state during overall simulation time, and lesser root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) and root-mean-square fluctuation (RMSF) values compared with co-crystal. In conclusion, we suggest the two compounds (6966 and 6961) as potential leads that could be utilized as effective inhibitors of GSK-3ß to combat AD.","Elangovan, Nandha Devi; Dhanabalan, Anantha Krishnan; Gunasekaran, Krishnasamy; Kandimalla, Ramesh; Sankarganesh, Devaraj",J Biomol Struct Dyn,737,26

Waiting for the collective immunity by vaccination, mass-testing, and isolation of positive cases remain essential. The development of a diagnosis method requiring a simple and non-invasive sampling with a quick and low-cost approach is on demand. We hypothesized that the combination of saliva specimens with MALDI-TOF MS profiling analyses could be the winning duo. Before characterizing MS saliva signatures associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, optimization and standardization of sample collection, preparation and storage up to MS analyses appeared compulsory. In this view, successive experiments were performed on saliva from healthy healthcare workers. Specimen sampling with a roll cotton of Salivette(®) devices appeared the most appropriate collection mode. Saliva protein precipitation with organic buffers did not improved MS spectra profiles compared to a direct loading of samples mixed with acetonitrile/formic acid buffer onto MS plate. The assessment of sample storage conditions and duration revealed that saliva should be stored on ice until MS analysis, which should occur on the day of sampling. Kinetic collection of saliva highlighted reproducibility of saliva MS profiles over four successive days and also at two-week intervals. The intra-individual stability of saliva MS profiles should be a key factor in the future investigation for biomarkers associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, the singularity of MS profiles between individuals will require the development of sophisticated bio-statistical analyses such as machine learning approaches. MALDI-TOF MS profiling of saliva could be a promising PCR-free tool for SARS-CoV-2 screening.","Costa, Monique Melo; Benoit, Nicolas; Saby, Florian; Pradines, Bruno; Granjeaud, Samuel; Almeras, Lionel",Diagnostics (Basel),737,16

In this study, we aimed to examine the association between vitamin D and COVID-19 risk and outcomes. We used logistic regression to identify associations between vitamin D variables and COVID-19 (risk of infection, hospitalisation and death) in 417,342 participants from UK Biobank. We subsequently performed a Mendelian Randomisation (MR) study to look for evidence of a causal effect. In total, 1746 COVID-19 cases (399 deaths) were registered between March and June 2020. We found no significant associations between COVID-19 infection risk and measured 25-OHD levels after adjusted for covariates, but this finding is limited by the fact that the vitamin D levels were measured on average 11 years before the pandemic. Ambient UVB was strongly and inversely associated with COVID-19 hospitalization and death overall and consistently after stratification by BMI and ethnicity. We also observed an interaction that suggested greater protective effect of genetically-predicted vitamin D levels when ambient UVB radiation is stronger. The main MR analysis did not show that genetically-predicted vitamin D levels are causally associated with COVID-19 risk (OR = 0.77, 95% CI 0.55–1.11, P = 0.160), but MR sensitivity analyses indicated a potential causal effect (weighted mode MR: OR = 0.72, 95% CI 0.55–0.95, P = 0.021; weighted median MR: OR = 0.61, 95% CI 0.42–0.92, P = 0.016).

This protein is widely distributed in the adult female worm after pairing. Reverse transcription‐polymerase chain reaction (RT‐PCR) and immunofluorescence were employed to analyze the relationship between the RNAi effect and dsRNA dosage in the parasites. The results revealed that the inhibition of SjGCP expression by siRNA is dose‐dependent. RT‐PCR analysis showed that the SjGCP transcript level was reduced by 75% when 100 nM dsRNA was applied.
