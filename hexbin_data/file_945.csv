According to the differences in the dielectric behavior of particles, the preparation of multi-domain oriented particle chains in the gel was successfully realized by using the dielectrophoretic force and electroosmotic rotation. This provides a new idea for manufacturing multi-structure, multi-layer, and multi-functional intelligent response materials. In addition, the factors affecting the alignment height of the particles in the gel were discussed, which was the basis for the preparation of bilayer particle chains. As an example of structural hierarchy, particle assembly has broad application prospects in optoelectronic devices and soft robots.","Zhang, Yajun; Jiang, Weitao; Gu, Tongkai; Han, Jie; Lei, Biao; Wang, Lanlan; Liu, Hongzhong; Yin, Lei; Chen, Bangdao; Shi, Yongsheng",Langmuir : the ACS journal of surfaces and colloids,945,1

The aim of this study was to compare the management approach of acute knee dislocations (AKDs) by orthopedic surgeons from nations with different economic status. METHODS This descriptive cross-sectional scenario-based survey compares different management strategies for aMLKIs of surgeons in developed economic nations (DEN) and emerging markets and developing nations (EMDN). The main areas of focus were operative versus non-operative management, timing and staging of surgery, graft choice and vascular assessment strategies. The members of the Societe Internationale de Chirurgie Orthopedique et de Traumatologie (SICOT) were approached to participate and information was collected regarding their demographics, experience, hospital setting and management strategies of aMLKIs. These were analyzed after categorizing participants into DEN and EMDN based on the gross domestic product (GDP) per capita. RESULTS One-hundred and thirty-eight orthopedic surgeons from 47 countries participated in this study, 67 from DEN and 71 (51.4%) from EMDN. DEN surgeons had more years of experience and were older (p < 0.05). Surgeons from EMDN mostly worked in public sector hospitals, were general orthopedic surgeons and treated patients from a low-income background. They preferred conservative management and delayed reconstruction with autograft (p < 0.05) if surgery was necessary. Surgeons from DEN favored early, single stage arthroscopic ligament reconstruction. Selective Computerized Tomography Angiography (CTA) was the most preferred choice of arterial examination for both groups. Significantly more EMDN surgeons preferred clinical examination (p < 0.05) and duplex doppler scanning (p < 0.05) compared to DEN surgeons. More surgeons from EMDN did not have access to a physiotherapist for their patients. CONCLUSIONS Treatment of aMLKIs vary significantly based on the economic status of the country. Surgeons from DEN prefer early, single stage arthroscopic ligament reconstruction, while conservative management is favored in EMDN. Ligament surgery in EMDN is often delayed and staged. EMDN respondents utilize duplex doppler scanning and clinical examination more readily in their vascular assessment of aMLKIs. These findings highlight very distinct approaches to MLKIs in low-resource settings which are often neglected when guidelines are generated.","Venter, Santa-Marie; Dey, Roopam; Khanduja, Vikas; von Bormann, Richard Pb; Held, Michael",SICOT-J,945,1

METHODS AND RESULTS This prospective observational study included 35 patients admitted to a UK district general hospital with COVID-19 and evidence of cardiac involvement, that is, raised Troponin I levels or clinical evidence of heart failure during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic (March-May 2020). All patients underwent echocardiography including speckle tracking for right ventricular longitudinal strain (RVLS) providing image quality was sufficient (30 out of 35 patients). Upon comparison of patients who survived COVID-19 with non-survivors, survivors had significantly smaller RVs (basal RV diameter 38.2 vs 43.5 mm P = .0295) with significantly better RV function (Tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE): 17.5 vs 15.3 mm P = .049; average RVLS: 24.3% vs 15.6%; P = .0018). Tricuspid regurgitation (TR) maximal velocity was higher in survivors (2.75 m/s vs 2.11 m/s; P = .0045) indicating that pressure overload was not the predominant driver of this effect and there was no significant difference in left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction. Kaplan-Meier and log-rank analysis of patients split into groups according to average RVLS above or below 20% revealed significantly increased 30-day mortality in patients with average RVLS under 20% (HR: 3.189; 95% CI: 1.297-12.91; P = .0195). CONCLUSION This study confirms that RVLS is a potent and independent predictor of outcome in COVID-19 patients with evidence of cardiac involvement.","Stockenhuber, Alexander; Vrettos, Apostolos; Androschuck, Vitaliy; George, Manju; Robertson, Calum; Bowers, Nicola; Clifford, Piers; Firoozan, Soroosh",Echocardiography,945,27

We investigated whether transcranial Doppler ultrasound has utility for identifying microemboli and clinically relevant cerebral blood flow velocities (CBFVs) in COVID-19. METHODS: We performed transcranial Doppler for a consecutive series of patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infection admitted to 2 intensive care units at a large academic center including evaluation for microembolic signals. Variables specific to hypercoagulability and blood flow including transthoracic echocardiography were analyzed as a part of routine care. RESULTS: Twenty-six patients were included in this analysis, 16 with confirmed COVID-19 infection. Of those, 2 had acute ischemic stroke secondary to large vessel occlusion. Ten non-COVID stroke patients were included for comparison. Two COVID-negative patients had severe acute respiratory distress syndrome and stroke due to large vessel occlusion. In patients with COVID-19, relatively low CBFVs were observed diffusely at median hospital day 4 (interquartile range, 3-9) despite low hematocrit (29.5% [25.7%-31.6%]); CBFVs in comparable COVID-negative stroke patients were significantly higher compared with COVID-positive stroke patients. Microembolic signals were not detected in any patient. Median left ventricular ejection fraction was 60% (interquartile range, 60%-65%). CBFVs were correlated with arterial oxygen content, and C-reactive protein (Spearman &#961;=0.28 [P=0.04]; 0.58 [P<0.001], respectively) but not with left ventricular ejection fraction (&#961;=-0.18; P=0.42). CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort of critically ill patients with COVID-19 infection, we observed lower than expected CBFVs in setting of low arterial oxygen content and low hematocrit but not associated with suppression of cardiac output.","Ziai, Wendy C; Cho, Sung-Min; Johansen, Michelle C; Ergin, Bahattin; Bahouth, Mona N",Stroke,945,6

The many risks to the wellbeing of HCWs are not well understood. Of the literature, there is a paucity of information around how to best prevent psychological distress, and what steps are needed to mitigate harm to HCWs' wellbeing. Methods: A systematic review using PRISMA methodology was used to investigate the psychological impact on HCWs facing epidemics or pandemics, using three electronic databases (PubMed, MEDLINE and CINAHL), dating back to 2002 until the 21st of August 2020. The search strategy included terms for HCWs (e.g., nurse and doctor), mental health (e.g., wellbeing and psychological), and viral outbreaks (e.g., epidemic and pandemic). Only studies with greater than 100 frontline HCWs (i.e. doctors or nurses in close proximity to infected patients) were included. Results: A total of 55 studies were included, with 53 using quantitative methodology and 2 were qualitative. 50 of the quantitative studies used validated measurement tools while 5 used novel questionnaires. The studies were conducted across various countries and included people with SARS (13 studies), Ebola (1), MERS (3) and COVID-19 (38). Findings suggest that the psychological implications to HCWs are variable with several studies demonstrating an increased risk of acquiring a trauma or stress-related disorders, depression and anxiety. Fear of the unknown or becoming infected were at the forefront of the mental challenges faced. Being a nurse and being female appeared to confer greater risk. In past epidemics, the perceived stigma from family members and society heightened negative implications; predominantly stress and isolation. Coping strategies varied amongst the contrasting sociocultural settings and appeared to differ amongst doctors, nurses and other HCWs. Implemented changes, and suggestions for prevention in the future consistently highlighted the need for greater psychosocial support and clearer dissemination of disease-related information. Conclusion: This review can inform current and future research priorities in the maintenance of wellbeing amongst frontline HCWs. Change needs to start at the level of policy-makers to offer an enhanced variety of supports to HCWs who play a critical role during largescale disease outbreaks. Psychological implications are largely negative and require greater attention to be mitigated, potentially through the involvement of psychologists, raised awareness and better education. The current knowledge of therapeutic interventions suggests they could be beneficial but more long-term follow-up is needed.","Cabarkapa, Sonja; Nadjidai, Sarah E; Murgier, Jerome; Ng, Chee H",Brain Behav Immun Health,945,33

Natural SARS-COV-2 infection has been detected in dogs, cats and tigers. However, the symptoms in canines and felines were mild. The underlying mechanisms are unknown. Excessive activation of inflammasome pathways can trigger cytokine storm and severe damage to host. In current study, we performed a comparative genomics study of key components of inflammasome and pyroptosis pathways in dogs, cats and tigers. Cats and tigers do not have AIM2 and NLRP1. Dogs do not contain AIM2, and encode a short form of NLRC4. The activation sites in GSDMB were absent in dogs, cats and tigers, while GSDME activation sites in cats and tigers were abolished. We propose that deficiencies of inflammasome and pyroptosis pathways might provide an evolutionary advantage against SARS-CoV-2 by reducing cytokine storm-induced host damage.

Established evidence from other respiratory viruses and emerging evidence for COVID-19 specifically indicates that air pollution alters respiratory defense mechanisms leading to worsened infection severity. Air pollution also contributes to co-morbidities that are known to worsen outcomes amongst those infected with COVID-19, and air pollution may also enhance infection transmission due to its impact on more frequent coughing. Yet despite the massive disruption of the COVID-19 pandemic, there are reasons for optimism: broad societal lockdowns have shown us a glimpse of what a future with strong air pollution measures could yield.

In specific, we first study the characteristics of the most active participants to uncover what might drive their sustained participation. Next, we investigate how these active individuals mobilize their community to action.

The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) spread worldwide, becoming an emergency of major international concern. However, even after a decade of coronavirus research, there are still no licensed vaccines or therapeutic agents to treat the coronavirus infection. In this context, apitherapy presents as a promising source of pharmacological and nutraceutical agents for the treatment and/or prophylaxis of COVID-19. For instance, several honeybee products, such as honey, pollen, propolis, royal jelly, beeswax, and bee venom, have shown potent antiviral activity against pathogens that cause severe respiratory syndromes, including those caused by human coronaviruses. In addition, the benefits of these natural products to the immune system are remarkable, and many of them are involved in the induction of antibody production, maturation of immune cells, and stimulation of the innate and adaptive immune responses. Thus, in the absence of specific antivirals against SARS-CoV-2, apitherapy could offer one hope toward mitigating some of the risks associated with COVID-19.","Lima, William G; Brito, Júlio C M; da Cruz Nizer, Waleska S",Phytother. res,945,1

The series showcases the potential professional case managers have in support of managing during a crisis such as this global pandemic. Part I discusses reenvisioned roles and responsibilities of case managers and leaders known to address patients' needs during a crisis, with a special focus on telehealth, tele-case management, surge capacity, redeployment, discharge planning, and transitions of care. PRIMARY PRACTICE SETTINGS: Applicable to the various case management practice settings across the continuum of health and human services, especially acute care. FINDINGS CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 global pandemic crisis has brought an unprecedented challenge to professional case managers and health care professionals. It also has provided opportunities for innovation and partnerships within and across health care organizations and the various care settings where patients/support systems access necessary services. Most importantly, it created a renewed interest in telehealth and facilitated a wider adoption of such approach to care delivery than ever before. This pandemic has also increased the use of nontraditional sites of care, most importantly those that operate virtually on electronic networks and health information system technologies such as remote visits, e-visits, virtual care, and tele-monitoring. Undoubtedly, these have provided new opportunities for tele-case management services and roles for professional case managers in the virtual world of health and human service delivery. IMPLICATIONS FOR CASE MANAGEMENT PRACTICE: Professional case managers are integral members of interprofessional health care teams. Their roles are even more necessary during a global pandemic such as COVID-19. The practice of case management will forever change-for the better. The experience of this crisis in health care has brought about ever-lasting implications for case management professionals. It has raised awareness to sites of care never were as popular before, resulting in an increased need and recognition for tele-case management practice and virtual case managers. It has also forced partnerships and collaborations among the diverse contexts of health care organizations (public, private, or both) and other industries, regardless of whether directly involved in the delivery of care or having a support service role. These new and innovative approaches in the provision of care and case management services will without a doubt become routine expectations beyond the current pandemic period. Of special note are the enhanced roles of case managers in discharge planning and transitions of care.","Tahan, Hussein M",Prof Case Manag,945,16

While the development of vaccines and pharmaceutical treatments are ongoing, government authorities in China have implemented unprecedented non-pharmaceutical interventions as primary barriers to curb the spread of the deadly SARS-CoV-2 virus. Although the decline of COVID-19 cases coincided with the implementation of such interventions, we searched for evidence to demonstrate the efficacy of these interventions, since artifactual factors, such as the environment, the pathogen itself, and the phases of epidemic, may also alter the patterns of case development. METHODS: We surveyed common viral respiratory infections that have a similar pattern of transmission, tropism, and clinical manifestation, as COVID-19 under a series of non-pharmaceutical interventions during the current pandemic season. We then compared this data with historical data from previous seasons without such interventions. RESULTS: Our survey showed that the rates of common respiratory infections, such as influenza and respiratory syncytial virus infections, decreased dramatically from 13.7% (95% CI, 10.82-16.58) and 4.64% (95% CI, 2.88-7.64) in previous years to 0.73% (95% CI, 0.02-1.44) and 0.0%, respectively, in the current season. CONCLUSIONS: Our surveillance provides compelling evidence that non-pharmaceutical interventions are cost-effective ways to curb the spread of contagious agents, and may represent the only practical approach to limit the evolving epidemic until specific vaccines and pharmaceutical treatments are available.","Yang, Qi; Xiao, Xia; Gu, Xinxia; Liang, Dong; Cao, Ting; Mou, Jun; Huang, Chunxu; Chen, Lei; Liu, Jie",Int J Infect Dis,945,20

We aimed to determine whether serum cardiac troponin T (cTnT) levels measured with a highly sensitive assay [high sensitivity cTnT (HS-cTnT)] may predict cardiovascular events (CVEs) in SLE. METHOD: All SLE patients included between 2007 and 2010 in the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre PLUS trial were screened. Patients with no past history of CVE at inclusion and a follow-up period of >20 months were analysed. HS-cTnT concentration was measured using the electrochemiluminescence method on serum collected at PLUS inclusion. The primary outcome was the incident CVE. Factors associated with the primary outcome were identified and multivariate analysis was performed. RESULTS: Overall, 442 SLE patients (of the 573 included in the PLUS study) were analysed for the primary outcome with a median follow up of 110 (interquartile range: 99-120) months. Among them, 29 (6.6%) experienced at least one CVE that occurred at a median of 67 (interquartile range: 31-91) months after inclusion. Six out of 29 patients had more than one CVE. In the multivariate analysis, dyslipidaemia, age and HS-cTnT were associated with the occurrence of CVE. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that a concentration of HS-cTnT > 4.27 ng/l at inclusion increased by 2.7 [hazard ratio 2.7 (95% CI: 1.3, 5.6), P =0.0083] the risk of CVE in SLE. CONCLUSION: HS-cTnT measured in serum is the first identified biomarker independently associated with incident CVE in SLE patients.","Chezel, Julie; Costedoat-Chalumeau, Nathalie; Laouénan, Cedric; Rouzaud, Diane; Chenevier-Gobeaux, Camille; Le Guern, Véronique; Mathian, Alexis; Belhadi, Drifa; de Almeida Chaves, Sébastien; Duhaut, Pierre; Fain, Olivier; Galicier, Lionel; Ghillani-Dalbin, Pascale; Kahn, Jean Emmanuel; Morel, Nathalie; Perard, Laurent; Pha, Micheline; Saidoune, Fanny; Sarrot-Reynauld, Francoise; Aumaitre, Olivier; Chasset, François; Limal, Nicolas; Desmurs-Clavel, Helene; Ackermann, Felix; Amoura, Zahir; Papo, Thomas; Sacre, Karim",Rheumatology (Oxford),945,1

The amounts of lymphocyte subsets were significantly decreased with the increased severity of illness and the levels of IgM and IgG were lower in critical cases than severe and moderate cases. In deceased patients, the lymphocytes subsets were significantly lower than recovered patients. However, the relationship between the levels of IgM and IgG and the amounts of lymphocyte subsets were not significantly correlated. During different stages of COVID-19, the total T cell, CD4+ T cell, and CD8+ T cell counts were gradually recovered to the normal levels in severe and critical groups but the changing trend was relatively stable in the moderate group.

Increasing infection rates has led authorities in several countries to initiate booster campaigns for vulnerable populations, including the elderly. However, the durability of vaccine-induced immunity in the elderly is currently unknown. Here, we describe interim results of a prospective cohort study comparing immune responses in a cohort of vaccinated elderly persons to those in healthcare workers (HCW), measured six months after first immunisation with BNT162b2. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S1-, full Spike- and RBD-IgG seropositivity rates and IgG levels at six months were significantly lower in the elderly compared to HCW. Serum neutralization of Delta VOC measured by pseudovirus neutralisation test was detectable in 43/71 (60.6%, 95%CI: 48.9-71.1) in the elderly cohort compared to 79/83 in the HCW cohort (95.2%, 95%CI: 88.3-98.1) at six months post vaccination. Consistent with the overall lower antibody levels, SARS-CoV-2-S1 T cell reactivity was reduced in the elderly compared to HCW (261.6 mIU/ml, IQR:141.5-828.6 vs 1198.0 mIU/ml, IQR: 593.9-2533.6, p<0.0001). Collectively, these findings suggest that the established two-dose vaccination regimen elicits less durable immune responses in the elderly compared to young adults. Given the recent surge in hospitalisations, even in countries with high vaccination rates such as Israel, the current data may support booster vaccinations of the elderly. Further studies to determine long-term effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines in high-risk populations and the safety and effectiveness of additional boosters are needed.","Tober-Lau, Pinkus; Schwarz, Tatjana; Vanshylla, Kanika; Hillus, David; Gruell, Henning; Group, - EICOVCOVIM Study; Suttorp, Norbert; Landgraf, Irmgard; Kappert, Kai; Seybold, Joachim; Drosten, Christian; Klein, Florian; Kurth, Florian; Corman, Victor M; Sander, Leif Erik M",,945,16

This review provided strong support for central nervous system (CNS) infection with SARS-CoV-2 and shed light on the neurological mechanism underlying the lethality of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Among the published data, only 1.28% COVID-19 patients who underwent cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tests were positive for SARS-CoV-2 in CSF. However, this does not mean the absence of CNS infection in most COVID-19 patients because postmortem studies revealed that some patients with CNS infection showed negative results in CSF tests for SARS-CoV-2. Among 20 neuropathological studies reported so far, SARS-CoV-2 was detected in the brain of 58 cases in nine studies, and three studies have provided sufficient details on the CNS infection in COVID-19 patients. Almost all in vitro and in vivo experiments support the neuroinvasive potential of SARS-CoV-2. In infected animals, SARS-CoV-2 was found within neurons in different brain areas with a wide spectrum of neuropathology, consistent with the reported clinical symptoms in COVID-19 patients. Several lines of evidence indicate that SARS-CoV-2 used the hematopoietic route to enter the CNS. But more evidence supports the trans-neuronal hypothesis. SARS-CoV-2 has been found to invade the brain via the olfactory, gustatory, and trigeminal pathways, especially at the early stage of infection. Severe COVID-19 patients with neurological deficits are at a higher risk of mortality, and only the infected animals showing neurological symptoms became dead, suggesting that neurological involvement may be one cause of death.","Liu, Jia-Mei; Tan, Bai-Hong; Wu, Shuang; Gui, Yue; Suo, Jia-Le; Li, Yan-Chao",J. med. virol,945,16

Here, by reanalyzing single-cell RNA sequencing data, we delineated metabolic remodeling in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) to elucidate the metabolic mechanisms that may lead to the progression of severe COVID-19. After scoring the metabolism-related biological processes and signaling pathways, we found that mono-CD14+ cells expressed higher levels of glycolysis-related genes (PKM, LDHA and PKM) and PPP-related genes (PGD and TKT) in severe patients than in mild patients. These genes may contribute to the hyperinflammation in mono-CD14+ cells of patients with severe COVID-19. The mono-CD16+ cell population in COVID-19 patients showed reduced transcription levels of genes related to lysine degradation (NSD1, KMT2E, and SETD2) and elevated transcription levels of genes involved in OXPHOS (ATP6V1B2, ATP5A1, ATP5E, and ATP5B), which may inhibit M2-like polarization. Plasma cells also expressed higher levels of the OXPHOS gene ATP13A3 in COVID-19 patients, which was positively associated with antibody secretion and survival of PCs. Moreover, enhanced glycolysis or OXPHOS was positively associated with the differentiation of memory B cells into plasmablasts or plasma cells. This study comprehensively investigated the metabolic features of peripheral immune cells and revealed that metabolic changes exacerbated inflammation in monocytes and promoted antibody secretion and cell survival in PCs in COVID-19 patients, especially those with severe disease.","Qi, Furong; Zhang, Wenbo; Huang, Jialu; Fu, Lili; Zhao, Jinfang",Front Immunol,945,16

The transition to a virtual format has been challenging for case-based teaching sessions, which involve substantial audience participation. We developed a faculty development workshop aimed at teaching health professions educators how to use various interactive virtual tools within videoconferencing platforms to facilitate virtual case-based sessions. Methods: Two 90-minute workshops were piloted as a faculty development initiative. The facilitators demonstrated interactive teaching tools that could be used within virtual case-based sessions. Then, participants discussed how to incorporate these tools into case-based teaching sessions of different class sizes in small-group breakout sessions. Participants completed an online survey following each workshop to evaluate the sessions. Results: A total of 18 and 26 subjects participated in the first and second workshops, respectively. Survey response rates were 100% (n = 18) and 65% (n = 17) for the first and second workshops, respectively. Both groups provided overall high ratings and reported that the workshop was clear, organized, and relevant. Participants were more familiar and comfortable with the use of various interactive tools for online teaching. Discussion: Distance online teaching will be increasingly required for an undetermined time. Faculty development efforts are crucial to facilitate effective interactive teaching sessions that engage learners and maximize learning. This virtual teaching workshop is a simple and straightforward way to introduce a more interactive format to virtual case-based teaching in the health professions.","Spicer, Jennifer O; Nguyen, Trong Tien; Arnold, Margaret W; Anderson, Tiffany; Khalife, Roy",MedEdPORTAL,945,16

For competing risks data, the corresponding quantities of interest are cause-specific hazard ratios (CHRs) and subdistribution hazard ratios (SHRs). However, they all have some limitations related to model assumptions and clinical interpretation. Therefore, we introduce restricted mean time lost (RMTL) as an alternative that is easy to interpret in a competing risks framework. We propose a hypothetical test and sample size estimator based on the difference in RMTL (RMTLd). The simulation results show that the RMTLd test has robust statistical performance (both type I error and power). Meanwhile, the RMTLd-based sample size can approximately achieve the predefined power level. The results of two example analyses also verify the performance of the RMTLd test. From the perspectives of clinical interpretation, application conditions and statistical performance, we recommend that the RMTLd be reported with the HR when analyzing competing risks data and that the RMTLd even be regarded as the primary outcome when the proportional hazard assumption fails.","Wu, Hongji; Yuan, Hao; Yang, Zijing; Hou, Yawen; Chen, Zheng",,945,16

The objective of this survey was to evaluate how the COVID-19 pandemic affected oral and maxillofacial surgery (OMFS) training programs during the early phase of the pandemic. STUDY DESIGN: During the period April 3 to May 6, 2020, a cross-sectional survey was sent to the program directors of 95 of the 101 accredited OMFS training programs in the United States. The 35-question survey, designed by using Qualtrics software, aimed to elicit information about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on OMFS residency programs and the resulting specific modifications made to clinical care, PPE, and resident training/wellness. RESULTS: The survey response rate from OMFS program directors was 35% (33 of 95), with most responses from the states with a high incidence of COVID-19. All OMFS programs (100%) implemented guidelines to suspend elective and nonurgent surgical procedures and limited ambulatory clinic visits by third week of March, with the average date being March 16, 2020 (date range March 8-23). The programs used telemedicine (40%) and modified in-person visit (51%) protocols for dental and maxillofacial emergency triage to minimize the risk of exposure of HCP to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) was experienced by 51% of the programs. Almost two-thirds (63%) of the respondents recommended the use of a filtered respirator (i.e., N95 respirator) with full-face shield and stated that it was their preferred PPE, whereas 21% recommended the use of powered air-purifying respirators (PAPRs) during OMFS procedures. Only (73%) of the programs had resources for resident wellness and stress reduction. Virtual didactic training sessions conducted on digital platforms, most commonly Zoom, formed a major part of education for all programs. CONCLUSIONS: All programs promptly responded to the pandemic by making appropriate changes, including suspending elective surgery and limiting patient care to emergent and urgent services. OMFS training programs should give more consideration to providing residents with adequate stress reduction resources to maintain their well-being and training and to minimize exposure risk during an evolving global epidemic.","Brar, Branden; Bayoumy, Mohamed; Salama, Andrew; Henry, Andrew; Chigurupati, Radhika","Oral surgery, oral medicine, oral pathology and oral radiology",945,16

The prevalence of tooth wear varies among countries; therefore, national studies are needed to examine the prevalence of this condition and its associated determinants. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A sample of this national study included a total of 1,397 adults (response rate of 52%). Severity and number of teeth with erosive tooth wear, caries experience (D3MFS), and fluorosis were assessed clinically. A self-reported questionnaire inquired about sociodemographics, oral health behavior, diet, and general health. Fluoride levels in drinking water at the recruitment areas were also recorded. Data were analyzed by bivariate and multivariate methods. RESULTS: The prevalence of erosive tooth wear in enamel and dentin combined was 59% among 35- to 44-year-old, 75% among 45- to 54-year-old, 70% among 55- to 64-year-old, and 66% among 65- to 74-year-old males. The prevalence among females in the respective age groups was 44, 60, 63, and 59%. Erosive tooth wear in enamel was associated with a lower fluoride level (&#8804;1 ppm) in the drinking water (OR 2.1, 95% CI 1.1-4.2). Erosive tooth wear in dentin was positively associated with male gender (OR 1.7, 95% CI 1.1-2.5), periurban/rural residency (OR 1.6, 95% CI 1.1-2.4), older age (OR 1.6, 95% CI 1.3-1.9), presence of reflux (OR 3.3, 95% CI 1.0-10.9), and negatively with higher D3MFS scores (OR 0.7, 95% CI 0.5-0.9). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of erosive tooth wear in enamel and dentin was relatively high in Lithuania; the erosive tooth wear in enamel and dentin combined was 52% among 35- to 44-year-olds, 68% among 45- to 54-year-olds, 67% among 55- to 64-year-olds, and 63% among 65- to 74-year-olds. Lower fluoride level in drinking water was associated with erosive tooth wear in enamel. Male gender, residency in periurban/rural areas, older age, and presence of acid reflux were associated with higher odds, while higher D3MFS scores were associated with lower odds for erosive tooth wear in dentin. These results can be used to plan dental public health prevention.","Stangvaltaite-Mouhat, Lina; Puriene, Alina; Stankeviciene, Indre; Aleksejuniene, Jolanta",Caries Res,945,23

However, contradictory findings have been reported regarding the impact of glycaemic control on COVID-19 outcome. The aim of this meta-analysis was to explore the impact of hospital pre-admission or at-admission values of HbA1c on COVID-19 mortality or worsening in patients with diabetes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We searched PubMed, Embase and Scopus up to 30th December 2020. Eligibility criteria for study selection were the following: (1)enrolling patients with any form of diabetes mellitus and hospitalized for COVID-19 and (2) reporting data regarding HbA1c values before infection or at hospital admission in relation to COVID-19 mortality or worsening. Descriptive statistics, HbA1c values, odds ratios (ORs) and hazard ratios were extracted from seven observational studies and generic inverse variance (random effects) of OR was used to estimate the effect of HbA1c on COVID-19 outcome. RESULTS: HbA1c was linearly associated with an increased COVID-19 mortality or worsening when considered as a continuous variable (OR 1.01 [1.01, 1.01]; p < 0.00001). Similarly, when analysing studies providing the number of events according to the degree of glycaemic control among various strata, a significantly increased risk was observed with poor glycaemic control (OR 1.15 [1.11, 1.19]; p < 0.00001), a result corroborated by sensitivity analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Notwithstanding the large heterogeneity in study design and patients' characteristics in the few available studies, data suggest that patients with diabetes and poor glycaemic control before infection might have an increased risk of COVID-19 related mortality.","Prattichizzo, Francesco; de Candia, Paola; Nicolucci, Antonio; Ceriello, Antonio",Diabetes Metab Res Rev,945,20

Despite 25 years of supportive legislation and policy in the UK, ethnicity data recording remains inconsistent, which has hindered needs assessment, evaluation and decision-making. We describe efforts to improve the completeness, quality and usage of ethnicity data within our regional health board, NHS Lothian. METHODS: The Ethnicity Coding Task Force was established with the aim of increasing ethnicity recording within NHS Lothian secondary care services from 3 to 90% over 3 years. We subsequently analysed these data specifically focusing on Accident and Emergency (A&E) use by ethnic group. RESULTS: We achieved 91%, 85% and 93% completeness of recording across inpatients, outpatients and A&E, respectively. Analysis of A&E data found a mixed pattern of attendance amongst ethnic minority populations and did not support the commonly perceived relationship between lower GP registration and higher A&E use within this population. CONCLUSIONS: We identified a successful approach to increase ethnicity recording within a regional health board, which could potentially be useful in other settings, and demonstrated the utility of these data in informing assessment of healthcare delivery and future planning.","Davidson, Emma M; Douglas, Anne; Villarroel, Nazmy; Dimmock, Katy; Gorman, Dermot; Bhopal, Raj S",J. public health (Oxf),945,24

This article reflects on the complexity of the public policy process, the perspectives of its various actors, and draws on Alford's work on the Blue, Red and Purple zones to propose a more nuanced approach to advocacy for EBP in health. We contend that the pathway for translation of research evidence into routine clinical practice is relatively linear, in contrast to the more complex course for translation of evidence to public policy - much to the frustration of health researchers and EBP advocates. Cairney's description of the characteristics of successful policy entrepreneurs offers useful guidance to advance EBP and we conclude with proposing some practical mechanisms to support it.

This could result in difficulty for some public safety surveillance systems involving face detection or tracking. Therefore, the development of face detection and tracking algorithms for people wearing face masks is particularly important. In this paper, a real-time tracking algorithm for people with or without face masks is proposed. This algorithm is trained on public face datasets with faces without masks. Although the training does not involve face images of people wearing face masks, we show that the proposed algorithm is robust as it is able to perform well in face tracking for people wearing face masks. We also discuss the possible scenarios where the algorithm could lose track of the target when experimenting in tracking masked faces. This can motivate future research in this area.","Peng, X.

Nevertheless, there are still important challenges in this area, which include the development of more active, non-invasive, and thermo-resistant vaccines. Important biotechnological advances have led to safer subunit antigens, such as proteins, peptides, and nucleic acids. However, their limited immunogenicity has demanded potent adjuvants that can strengthen the immune response. Particulate nanocarriers hold a high potential as adjuvants in vaccination. Due to their pathogen-like size and structure, they can enhance immune responses by mimicking the natural infection process. Additionally, they can be tailored for non-invasive mucosal administration (needle-free vaccination), and control the delivery of the associated antigens to a specific location and for prolonged times, opening room for single-dose vaccination. Moreover, they allow co-association of immunostimulatory molecules to improve the overall adjuvant capacity. The natural and ubiquitous character of polysaccharides, together with their intrinsic immunomodulating properties, their biocompatibility, and biodegradability, justify their interest in the engineering of nanovaccines. In this review, we aim to provide a state-of-the-art overview regarding the application of nanotechnology in vaccine delivery, with a focus on the most recent advances in the development and application of polysaccharide-based antigen nanocarriers.","Cordeiro, Ana Sara; Alonso, María José; de la Fuente, María",Biotechnol Adv,945,0

Several prognostic factors have been identified in the studies from Asian, European or American countries. This is the first national Lebanese study assessing the factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 mortality in hemodialysis patients. METHODS: This is an observational study that included all chronic hemodialysis patients in Lebanon who were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 from 31st March to 1st November 2020. Data on demographics, comorbidities, admission to hospital and outcome were collected retrospectively from the patients’ medical records. A binary logistic regression analysis was performed to assess risk factors for mortality. RESULTS: A total of 231 patients were included. Mean age was 61.46 ± 13.99 years with a sex ratio of 128 males to 103 females. Around half of the patients were diabetics, 79.2% presented with fever. A total of 115 patients were admitted to the hospital, 59% of them within the first day of diagnosis. Hypoxia was the major reason for hospitalization. Death rate was 23.8% after a median duration of 6 (IQR, 2 to 10) days. Adjusted regression analysis showed a higher risk for death among older patients (odds ratio = 1.038; 95% confidence interval: 1.013, 1.065), patients with heart failure (odds ratio = 4.42; 95% confidence interval: 2.06, 9.49), coronary artery disease (odds ratio = 3.27; 95% confidence interval: 1.69, 6.30), multimorbidities (odds ratio = 1.593; 95% confidence interval: 1.247, 2.036), fever (odds ratio = 6.66; 95% confidence interval: 1.94, 27.81), CRP above 100 mg/L (odds ratio = 4.76; 95% confidence interval: 1.48, 15.30), and pneumonia (odds ratio = 19.18; 95% confidence interval: 6.47, 56.83).

We aimed to investigate the diagnostic value of symptoms of anosmia and dysgeusia for COVID‐19. METHODS: A comprehensive electronic search was conducted using PubMed, MEDLINE, Scopus, Cochrane database, and Google Scholar from 1 June 2020 to 12 June 2020. All studies reporting symptoms of anosmia and dysgeusia in COVID‐19‐positive patients were included. A total of 23 studies were included in the systematic review. RESULTS: Symptoms of anosmia and dysgeusia were frequently reported by COVID‐19‐positive patients. Symptoms were more common in females and in younger patients. There was no direct association between the severity of COVID‐19 and the presence of symptoms. However, some evidence was found for a longer duration of these symptoms and increased severity of COVID‐19 infection in young patients. CONCLUSION: OTD is commonly reported by COVID‐19 patients. Due to limited literature on the association between OTD and COVID‐19, it is currently not possible to conclude that these symptoms alone can be used to diagnose COVID‐19. However, the presence of OTD can potentially be used as a screening tool for COVID‐19 especially in young and female patients. Further research is required to establish the true diagnostic value of these symptoms and efficacy as screening tools for COVID‐19 patients.","Zahra, Syeda Anum; Iddawela, Sashini; Pillai, Kiran; Choudhury, Rozina Yasmin; Harky, Amer",Brain Behav,945,1

Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitors are found to be effective in the treatment of primary central nervous system diffuse large B cell lymphoma. Herein, we retrospectively reported the efficacy and safety profiles of bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitors in three consecutive patients with VRL. All three cases of VRL occurred in patients with pre-treated primary central nervous system lymphoma and the central nervous system was not involved at the time of VRL diagnosis. They were treated with zanubrutinib, a bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor, at 160 mg twice daily orally. Rapid improvement of visual acuity and tumor control was achieved in all involved eyes of these 3 patients. Complete remission was confirmed by fundus photograph and optical coherence tomography, and the level of interleukin-10, a well-recognized biomarker for vitreoretinal lymphoma, decreased to normal in all patients. Zanubrutinib was well tolerated in all three patients, and only one adverse event of grade 3 hypertension occurred, which resolved after adjusting antihypertensive drugs. As of March 2021, these three patients have been treated with zanubrutinib for 9 months, 7 months, and 6 months, respectively, and all remained in complete remission. In conclusion, targeting bruton tyrosine kinase with zanubrutinib in vitreoretinal lymphoma is feasible and our findings can be a foundation for a paradigm shift in treatment options for this rare disease. A prospective phase 2 study evaluating the efficacy and safety of zanubrutinib in patients with vitreoretinal lymphoma is ongoing to validate our findings (ChiCTR2000037921).","Wang, Liang; Guan, Wenxue; Peng, Xiaoyan",Front Oncol,945,21

ABSTRACT: We investigated whether phycoerythrin (PE), a pigment sourced from marine algae, could act as an immunomodulatory agent in whiteleg shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei). To this end, PE was extracted and purified from a PE-rich macroalgae, Colaconema sp. Our in vitro analysis demonstrated that PE enhanced prophenoloxidase and phagocytosis activity but inhibited the production of reactive oxygen species in hemocytes. Additionally, the PE signal could be detected using an in vivo imaging system after its injection into the ventral sinus of the cephalothorax of whiteleg shrimp. The expression profiles of fourteen immune-related genes were monitored in hemocytes from whiteleg shrimp injected with 0.30 μg of PE per gram of body weight, and crustin, lysozyme, penaiedin 4, and anti-lipopolysaccharide factor showed up-regulated post-stimulation. The induction of immune genes and enhancement of innate immune parameters by PE may explain the higher survival rates for shrimp that received different doses of PE prior to being challenged with Vibrio parahaemolyticus or white spot syndrome virus compared to controls. Combined, these results show that PE from Colaconema sp. can differentially stimulate the immune response of whiteleg shrimp in vitro and in vivo and could potentially be used as an immunomodulator in shrimp culture.","Lee, Po-Tsang; Huang, Jing; Huang, Chin-Yi; Liu, Zi-Xuan; Yeh, Han-Yang; Huang, Huai-Ting; Chen, Li-Li; Nan, Fan-Hua; Lee, Meng-Chou",Animals (Basel),945,1

Design and participants A 17-question, web-based survey was administered to neurosurgeons worldwide through the WFNS and the Neurosurgery Cocktail from March 28 to April 5, 2020 by web link or e-mail invitation. Questions were divided into three subgroups: general information, health system organization, and institutional plans for the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. Collected data was initially elaborated using Survey Monkey® software. Country specific data were extracted from the WHO website. Statistical analysis was performed using R version 3.6.3. Results Of the 446 respondents, most were from Italy (20%), India (19%), and Pakistan (5%). Surgical activity was significantly reduced in most centers (79%) and dedicated in-hospital routes were created for SARS-CoV-2 patients (58%). Patient screening was performed only when there were symptoms (57%) and not routinely before surgery (18%). The preferred methods included a nasopharyngeal swab and chest x-ray. Health professionals were rarely screened (20%) and sometimes, even if SARS-CoV-2 positive, were asked to work if asymptomatic (26%). Surgical planning was changed in most institutions (92%), while indications were modified for non-urgent procedures (59%) and remained unchanged for subarachnoid hemorrhages (85%). Conclusions Most neurosurgeons worldwide reported work reorganization and practices that respond to current international guidelines. Differences in practice might be related to the perception of the pandemic and significant differences in the health systems.

Here, we verified the replication ability and pathogenicity of a reporter HCoV-OC43 strain expressing Renilla luciferase (Rluc; rOC43-ns2DelRluc) in mice with different genetic backgrounds (C57BL/6 and BALB/c). Additionally, we monitored the spatial and temporal progression of HCoV-OC43 through the central nervous system (CNS) of live BALB/c mice after intranasal or intracerebral inoculation with rOC43-ns2DelRluc. We found that rOC43-ns2DelRluc was fatal to suckling mice after intranasal inoculation, and that viral titers and Rluc expression were detected in the brains and spinal cords of mice infected with rOC43-ns2DelRluc. Moreover, viral replication was initially observed in the brain by non-invasive bioluminescence imaging before the infection spread to the spinal cord of BALB/c mice, consistent with its tropism in the CNS. Furthermore, the Rluc readout correlated with the HCoV replication ability and protein expression, which allowed quantification of antiviral activity in live mice. Additionally, we validated that chloroquine strongly inhibited rOC43-ns2DelRluc replication in vivo. These results provide new insights into the temporal and spatial dissemination of HCoV-OC43 in the CNS, and our methods provide an extremely sensitive platform for evaluating the efficacy of antiviral therapies to treat neuroinvasive HCoVs in live mice.","Niu, Junwei; Shen, Liang; Huang, Baoying; Ye, Fei; Zhao, Li; Wang, Huijuan; Deng, Yao; Tan, Wenjie",Antiviral Res,945,0

According to the relationships among cases, we constructed disease transmission network graphs for the COVID-19 epidemic through a visualization technique based on individual reports of epidemiological data. We proposed an analysis strategy of the transmission network with the epidemiological data in Tianjin and Chengdu. The transmission networks showed different transmission characteristics. In Tianjin, an imported case of COVID-19 can produce an average of 2.9 secondary infections and ultimately produce as many as 4 generations of infections, with a maximum of 6 cases being generated before the imported case is identified. In Chengdu, 45 noninformative cases and 24 cases with vague exposure information made accurate information about the transmission network difficult to provide.

Because the MERS-CoV risk-standardized mortality rates are currently unavailable in the literature, the author concentrated on developing a method to estimate the risk-standardized mortality rates using MERS-CoV 3- and 30-day mortality measures. METHODS: MERS-CoV data in Saudi Arabia is publicly reported and made available through the Saudi Ministry of Health (SMOH) website. The author studied 660 MERS-CoV patients who were reported by the SMOH between December 2, 2014 and November 12, 2016. The data gathered contained basic demographic information (age, gender, and nationality), healthcare worker, source of infection, pre-existing illness, symptomatic, severity of illness, and regions in Saudi Arabia. The status and date of mortality were also reported. Cox-proportional hazard (CPH) models were applied to estimate the hazard ratios for the predictors of 3- and 30-day mortality. RESULTS: 3-day, 30-day, and overall mortality were found to be 13.8%, 28.3%, and 29.8%, respectively. According to CPH, multivariate predictors of 3-day mortality were elderly, non-healthcare workers, illness severity, and hospital-acquired infections (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) =1.7; 8.8; 6.5; and 2.8, respectively). Multivariate predictors of 30-day mortality were elderly, non-healthcare workers, pre-existing illness, severity of illness, and hospital-acquired infections (aHR =1.7; 19.2; 2.1; 3.7; and 2.9, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Several factors were identified that could influence mortality outcomes at 3 days and 30 days, including age (elderly), non-healthcare workers, severity of illness, and hospital-acquired infections.

Some HCoV strains, however, can cause fatal respiratory disease. Some examples of these diseases are severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19). This article will review the etiology, clinical features, diagnosis, and management of HCoVs. METHODS: A systematic literature review was performed using the terms “human coronaviruses”, “MERS-CoV”, “SARSCoV”, “SARS-CoV2”, “COVID-19”, and “common cold” in OVID MEDLINE, PubMed, and Cochrane Library. FINDINGS: Most HCoVs cause mild upper respiratory infections which resolve with supportive care and no sequelae. In recent decades, however, there have been outbreaks of novel HCoVs that cause more severe disease. This is largely due to HCoVs having large genomes which undergo frequent recombination events, leading to the emergence of novel and more virulent strains of the virus. These severe respiratory illnesses can lead to acute respiratory distress requiring invasive intervention, such as mechanical ventilation. These severe infections can lead to long-lasting sequelae in patients. Scientists continue to investigate potential treatments for these viruses, though supportive care remains the gold standard. Scientists have succeeded in developing numerous vaccines for the SARS-CoV-2 virus, and ongoing data collection and analysis will shed even more light on the next steps in fighting the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSION: Due to the frequency of recombination events and the subsequent emergence of novel strains, HCoVs are becoming more prevalent, making them a global health concern as they can lead to epidemics and pandemics. Understanding the epidemiology, etiology, clinical features, diagnosis, and management of HCoVs is important, especially during this worldwide pandemic.","Coerdt, Kathleen M; Khachemoune, Amor",Afr Health Sci,945,1

During SARS period in 2003, fever clinics emerged in many cities in mainland China with the purpose to screen the suspected SARS patients and to transfer the confirmed cases to designated hospitals for professional management. Shanghai city has reserved the fever clinics and the designated hospitals since then. Hence, clinicians in the front line are able to respond quickly to the emerging COVID-19 outbreak with their accumulated knowledge and experiences from the past. One hundred seventeen fever clinics distributed in various district areas in Shanghai have played a vital ‘sentinel’ role to fight against the COVID-19 epidemic. Most of suspected patients were identified in fever clinics and thereafter among these suspected patients the COVID-19 cases were confirmed and were isolated quickly to avoid the spread. We would like to share the sentinel roadmap for screening and diagnosis of COVID-19 to medical healthcare workers around the world, especially countries who are facing great challenges to cope with COVID-19 and meanwhile with limited medical resources. These sentinel surveillance strategies will certainly provide insight into the early detection and timely isolation of suspected cases from the others.","Lai, Rongtao; Chen, Erzhen; Gao, Weiyi; Cheng, Chengwei; Xie, Qing",Epidemiol Infect,945,21

This severe clinical situation increases the risk of serious fungal infections, such as invasive pulmonary aspergillosis, invasive candidiasis or Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia. However, few studies have investigated fungal coinfections in this population. We describe an update on published reports on fungal coinfections and our personal experience in three Spanish hospitals. We can conclude that despite the serious disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 in many patients, the scarcity of invasive mycoses is probably due to the few bronchoscopies and necropsies performed in these patients because of the high risk in aerosol generation. However, the presence of fungal markers in clinically relevant specimens, with the exception of bronchopulmonary colonization by Candida, should make it advisable to early implement antifungal therapy.","Pemán, Javier; Ruiz-Gaitán, Alba; García-Vidal, Carolina; Salavert, Miguel; Ramírez, Paula; Puchades, Francesc; García-Hita, Marta; Alastruey-Izquierdo, Ana; Quindós, Guillermo",Rev Iberoam Micol,945,22

Most LET procedures result in a construct that is fixed to both the femur and the tibia. In a modified Ellison procedure, the construct is only fixed distally, reducing the risk of inadvertently overconstraining the lateral compartment. PURPOSE: To evaluate the use of the modified Ellison procedure in a cohort of patients deemed to be at a high risk of further ACL injury after primary ACL reconstruction. STUDY DESIGN: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. METHODS: Included were 25 consecutive patients with at least 2 of the following risk factors: age <20 years at the time of surgery, previous contralateral ACL reconstruction, positive family history of ACL rupture (parent or sibling), generalized ligamentous laxity (Beighton ≥4), grade 3 pivot shift in the consulting room, a desire to return to a pivoting sport, and an elite or professional status. All patients underwent primary ACL reconstruction with an additional modified Ellison procedure. Postoperatively, patients completed the IKDC subjective knee evaluation form (International Knee Documentation Committee), KOOS Quality of Life subscale (Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score), ACL–Return to Sport After Injury Scale, Marx Activity Rating Scale, and SANE score (Single Assessment Numeric Evaluation). RESULTS: At 12-month follow-up, the mean outcome scores were as follows: SANE, 94/100; IKDC, 92/100; Marx, 13/16; ACL–Return to Sport, 85/100; and KOOS, 77/100. At 24 months, return-to-sport data were available for 23 of 25 patients; 17 (74%) were playing at the same level or higher than preinjury and 2 at a lower level. One patient (4%) sustained a contact mechanism graft rupture at 12 months. There were 2 (9%) contralateral ACL injuries, including 1 ACL graft rupture, at 11 and 22 months postoperatively. There was a further contralateral ACL graft rupture at 26 months. CONCLUSION: The use of the modified Ellison procedure as a LET augmentation of a primary ACL reconstruction to produce a low graft rupture rate appeared to be safe in a cohort considered to be at a high risk of reinjury. The procedure showed promise in terms of reducing further graft injuries.","Feller, Julian A.; Devitt, Brian M.; Webster, Kate E.; Klemm, Haydn J.",Orthop J Sports Med,945,33

Clearly, one can see the need to develop new, more effective, antimicrobial agents that go beyond the explored ‘chemical space’. In this regard, their unique modes of action (e.g., reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, redox activation, ligand exchange, depletion of substrates involved in vital cellular processes) render metal complexes as promising drug candidates. Several Ru (II/III) complexes have been included in, or are currently undergoing, clinical trials as anticancer agents. Based on the in-depth knowledge of their chemical properties and biological behavior, the interest in developing new ruthenium compounds as antibiotic, antifungal, antiparasitic, or antiviral drugs has risen. This review will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of Ru (II/III) frameworks as antimicrobial agents. Some aspects regarding the relationship between their chemical structure and mechanism of action, cellular localization, and/or metabolism of the ruthenium complexes in bacterial and eukaryotic cells are discussed as well. Regarding the antiviral activity, in light of current events related to the Covid-19 pandemic, the Ru (II/III) compounds used against SARS-CoV-2 (e.g., BOLD-100) are also reviewed herein.","Munteanu, Alexandra-Cristina; Uivarosi, Valentina",Pharmaceutics,945,1

METHODS: Three spherical targets of different diameters (1, 1.5, and 2 cm) were drawn and placed equidistantly on the same axial brain computed tomography (CT) images. To test the different isocenter-target distances, 2.5- and 5-cm configurations were prepared. Volumetric modulated arc therapy plans were created for different dose gradients from the target, in which the dose gradients were modified using the maximum dose inside the target. To simulate the rotational error, CT images and targets were rotated in two ways by 0.5°, 1°, and 2°, in which one rotation was in the axial plane and the other was in three dimensions. The initial optimized plan parameters were copied to the rotated CT sets, and the doses were recalculated. The coverage degradation after rotation was analyzed according to the target dislocation and 12-Gy volume. RESULTS: A shallower dose gradient reduced the loss of target coverage under target dislocation, and the effect was clearer for small targets. For example, the coverage of the 1-cm target under 1-mm dislocation increased from 93 to 95% by increasing the Paddick gradient index from 5.0 to 7.9. At the same time, the widely accepted necrosis indicator, the 12-Gy volume, increased from 1.2 to 3.5 cm(3), which remained in the tolerable range. From the differential dose volume histogram (DVH) analysis, the shallower dose gradient ensured that the dose-deficient under-covered target volume received a higher dose similar to that in the prescription. CONCLUSIONS: For frameless stereotactic brain radiotherapy, the gradient, alongside the margin addition, can be adjusted as an ancillary parameter for small targets to increase target coverage or at least limit coverage reduction in conditions with probable positioning error.","Yoon, Jai-Woong; Park, Soah; Cheong, Kwang-Ho; Kang, Sei-Kwon; Han, Tae Jin",Radiat Oncol,945,16

The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommended prioritizing COVID-19 vaccination for specific groups of the U.S. population who were at highest risk for COVID-19 hospitalization and death, including adults aged ≥75 years*; implementation varied by state, and eligibility was gradually expanded to persons aged ≥65 years beginning in January 2021. By April 19, 2021, eligibility was expanded to all adults aged ≥18 years nationwide.† To assess patterns of COVID-19 vaccination coverage among U.S. adults, CDC analyzed data submitted on vaccinations administered during December 14, 2020-May 22, 2021, by age, sex, and community-level characteristics. By May 22, 2021, 57.0% of persons aged ≥18 years had received ≥1 COVID-19 vaccine dose; coverage was highest among persons aged ≥65 years (80.0%) and lowest among persons aged 18-29 years (38.3%). During the week beginning February 7, 2021, vaccination initiation among adults aged ≥65 years peaked at 8.2%, whereas weekly initiation among other age groups peaked later and at lower levels.

However, little guidance is available to inform these activities, and many health departments rely on deterministic algorithms that may miss many true matches. In the context of public health action, these missed matches lead to missed opportunities to deliver interventions and may exacerbate existing health inequities. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to compare the performance of record linkage algorithms commonly used in public health practice. METHODS: We compared five deterministic (exact, Stenger, Ocampo 1, Ocampo 2, and Bosh) and two probabilistic record linkage algorithms (fastLink and beta record linkage [BRL]) using simulations and a real-world scenario. We simulated pairs of datasets with varying numbers of errors per record and the number of matching records between the two datasets (ie, overlap). We matched the datasets using each algorithm and calculated their recall (ie, sensitivity, the proportion of true matches identified by the algorithm) and precision (ie, positive predictive value, the proportion of matches identified by the algorithm that were true matches). We estimated the average computation time by performing a match with each algorithm 20 times while varying the size of the datasets being matched. In a real-world scenario, HIV and sexually transmitted disease surveillance data from King County, Washington, were matched to identify people living with HIV who had a syphilis diagnosis in 2017. We calculated the recall and precision of each algorithm compared with a composite standard based on the agreement in matching decisions across all the algorithms and manual review. RESULTS: In simulations, BRL and fastLink maintained a high recall at nearly all data quality levels, while being comparable with deterministic algorithms in terms of precision. Deterministic algorithms typically failed to identify matches in scenarios with low data quality. All the deterministic algorithms had a shorter average computation time than the probabilistic algorithms. BRL had the slowest overall computation time (14 min when both datasets contained 2000 records). In the real-world scenario, BRL had the lowest trade-off between recall (309/309, 100.0%) and precision (309/312, 99.0%). CONCLUSIONS: Probabilistic record linkage algorithms maximize the number of true matches identified, reducing gaps in the coverage of interventions and maximizing the reach of public health action.","Avoundjian, Tigran; Dombrowski, Julia C; Golden, Matthew R; Hughes, James P; Guthrie, Brandon L; Baseman, Janet; Sadinle, Mauricio",JMIR Public Health Surveill,945,21
