117,117,117,"Global public goods and the global health agenda: problems, priorities and potential",18.519278,1.3279705,2007-09-22,"The 'global public good' (GPG) concept has gained increasing attention, in health as well as development circles. However, it has suffered in finding currency as a general tool for global resource mobilisation, and is at risk of being attached to almost anything promoting development. This overstretches and devalues the validity and usefulness of the concept. This paper first defines GPGs and describes the policy challenge that they pose. Second, it identifies two key areas, health R&D and communicable disease control, in which the GPG concept is clearly relevant and considers the extent to which it has been applied. We point out that that, while there have been many new initiatives, it is not clear that additional resources from non-traditional sources have been forthcoming. Yet achieving this is, in effect, the entire purpose of applying the GPG concept in global health. Moreover, the proliferation of disease-specific programs associated with GPG reasoning has tended to promote vertical interventions at the expense of more general health sector strengthening. Third, we examine two major global health policy initiatives, the Global Fund against AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (GFATM) and the bundling of long-standing international health goals in the form of Millennium Development Goals (MDG), asking how the GPG perspective has contributed to defining objectives and strategies. We conclude that both initiatives are best interpreted in the context of traditional development assistance and, one-world rhetoric aside, have little to do with the challenge posed by GPGs for health. The paper concludes by considering how the GPG concept can be more effectively used to promote global health.","Smith, Richard D; MacKellar, Landis",Global Health,94,5
156,156,156,General Practice and Pandemic Influenza: A Framework for Planning and Comparison of Plans in Five Countries,18.004732,1.9624162,2008-05-28,"BACKGROUND: Although primary health care, and in particular, general practice will be at the frontline in the response to pandemic influenza, there are no frameworks to guide systematic planning for this task or to appraise available plans for their relevance to general practice. We aimed to develop a framework that will facilitate planning for general practice, and used it to appraise pandemic plans from Australia, England, USA, New Zealand and Canada. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We adapted the Haddon matrix to develop the framework, populating its cells through a multi-method study that incorporated the peer-reviewed and grey literature, interviews with general practitioners, practice nurses and senior decision-makers, and desktop simulation exercises. We used the framework to analyse 89 publicly-available jurisdictional plans at similar managerial levels in the five countries. The framework identifies four functional domains: clinical care for influenza and other needs, public health responsibilities, the internal environment and the macro-environment of general practice. No plan addressed all four domains. Most plans either ignored or were sketchy about non-influenza clinical needs, and about the contribution of general practice to public health beyond surveillance. Collaborations between general practices were addressed in few plans, and inter-relationships with the broader health system, even less frequently. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to provide a framework to guide general practice planning for pandemic influenza. The framework helped identify critical shortcomings in available plans. Engaging general practice effectively in planning is challenging, particularly where governance structures for primary health care are weak. We identify implications for practice and for research.","Patel, Mahomed S.; Phillips, Christine B.; Pearce, Christopher; Kljakovic, Marjan; Dugdale, Paul; Glasgow, Nicholas",PLoS One,94,22
1129,1129,1129,Immunosenescence in vertebrates and invertebrates,18.474724,1.9121777,2013-04-02,"There is an established consensus that it is primarily the adaptive arm of immunity, and the T cell subset in particular, that is most susceptible to the deleterious changes with age known as “immunosenescence”. Can we garner any clues as to why this might be by considering comparative immunology and the evolutionary emergence of adaptive and innate immunity? The immune system is assumed to have evolved to protect the organism against pathogens, but the way in which this is accomplished is different in the innate-vs-adaptive arms, and it is unclear why the latter is necessary. Are there special characteristics of adaptive immunity which might make the system more susceptible to age-associated dysfunction? Given recent accumulating findings that actually there are age-associated changes to innate immunity and that these are broadly similar in vertebrates and invertebrates, we suggest here that it is the special property of memory in the adaptive immune system which results in the accumulation of cells with a restricted receptor repertoire, dependent on the immunological history of the individual’s exposures to pathogens over the lifetime, and which is commonly taken as a hallmark of “immunosenescence”. However, we further hypothesize that this immunological remodelling per se does not necessarily convey a disadvantage to the individual (ie. is not necessarily “senescence” if it is not deleterious). Indeed, under certain circumstances, or potentially even as a rule, this adaptation to the individual host environment may confer an actual survival advantage.","Müller, Ludmila; Fülöp, Tamas; Pawelec, Graham",Immun Ageing,94,1
1741,1741,1741,Setting healthcare priorities in hospitals: a review of empirical studies,18.38485,1.6579909,2014-03-05,"Priority setting research has focused on the macro (national) and micro (bedside) level, leaving the meso (institutional, hospital) level relatively neglected. This is surprising given the key role that hospitals play in the delivery of healthcare services and the large proportion of health systems resources that they absorb. To explore the factors that impact upon priority setting at the hospital level, we conducted a thematic review of empirical studies. A systematic search of PubMed, EBSCOHOST, Econlit databases and Google scholar was supplemented by a search of key websites and a manual search of relevant papers’ reference lists. A total of 24 papers were identified from developed and developing countries. We applied a policy analysis framework to examine and synthesize the findings of the selected papers. Findings suggest that priority setting practice in hospitals was influenced by (1) contextual factors such as decision space, resource availability, financing arrangements, availability and use of information, organizational culture and leadership, (2) priority setting processes that depend on the type of priority setting activity, (3) content factors such as priority setting criteria and (4) actors, their interests and power relations. We observe that there is need for studies to examine these issues and the interplay between them in greater depth and propose a conceptual framework that might be useful in examining priority setting practices in hospitals.","Barasa, Edwine W; Molyneux, Sassy; English, Mike; Cleary, Susan",Health Policy Plan,94,5

Tobacco smoking remains the most important risk factor for both cancer and heart diseases. This study was initiated due to the lack of published data concerning the real progress in research output in the use of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) for tobacco cessation. This study was aimed to use bibliometric analysis to estimate the NRT literature indexed in Scopus database at global level. METHODS: Core of the search strategy was the documents that contained specific words or phrases regarding NRT as keywords in the title. Publication output of most prolific countries was adjusted to the gross domestic product and population size. All citations analysis were accomplished on December 22, 2017. RESULTS: A total of 2138 references were retrieved and published from 56 countries, which were published between 1970 and 2016. The USA has the most number of published articles accounted to 986, followed by the UK (312 publications) and then Australia (102 publications), and Sweden (102 publications). No data related to NRT were published from 156 countries. No significant correlation was found between the country population size or 2016 gross domestic product values and the number of publications of the top-10 most prolific countries in the field of NRT (r = − 0.156, P = 0.664; and r = − 0.173, P = 0.632, respectively). Furthermore, there is no correlation between prevalence of tobacco smoking and number of publications of the top-10 most prolific countries in the field of NRT (r = − 0.235, P = 0.514). CONCLUSIONS: The present data reveal a solid mass of research activity on NRT. The USA was by far the predominant country in the amount of NRT-based research activity. NRT-based research activities were low or not available in most countries. The results of this study delineate a framework for better understanding the situations of current NRT research and prospective directions of the research in this field which could be applied for managing and prioritizing future research efforts in NRT research.","Zyoud, Sa’ed H.",Global Health,94,5

DESIGN: A three-round online modified Delphi poll. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-nine leading health informaticians. METHODS: In September 2019, health informatics experts were selected by the research team, and invited to participate the Delphi poll. Participation in each round was anonymous, and panelists were given between 4–8 weeks to respond to each round. In Round 1 open-ended questions solicited forecasts on the impact of AI/ML on: (1) patient care, (2) access to care, (3) the primary care workforce, (4) technological breakthroughs, and (5) the long-future for primary care physicians. Responses were coded to produce itemized statements. In Round 2, participants were invited to rate their agreement with each item along 7-point Likert scales. Responses were analyzed for consensus which was set at a predetermined interquartile range of ≤ 1. In Round 3 items that did not reach consensus were redistributed. RESULTS: A total of 16 experts participated in Round 1 (16/29, 55%). Of these experts 13/16 (response rate, 81%), and 13/13 (response rate, 100%), responded to Rounds 2 and 3, respectively. As a result of developments in AI/ML by 2029 experts anticipated workplace changes including incursions into the disintermediation of physician expertise, and increased AI/ML training requirements for medical students. Informaticians also forecast that by 2029 AI/ML will increase diagnostic accuracy especially among those with limited access to experts, minorities and those with rare diseases. Expert panelists also predicted that AI/ML-tools would improve access to expert doctor knowledge. CONCLUSIONS: This study presents timely information on informaticians’ consensus views about the impact of AI/ML on US primary care in 2029. Preparation for the near-future of primary care will require improved levels of digital health literacy among patients and physicians.","Blease, Charlotte; Kharko, Anna; Locher, Cosima; DesRoches, Catherine M.; Mandl, Kenneth D.",PLoS One,94,1

Overexpression of the protein decreased the apoptosis process in the cell and resulting development of cancer. Different types of XIAP antagonists are generally used to repair the defective apoptosis process that can eliminate carcinoma from living bodies. The chemically synthesis compounds discovered till now as XIAP inhibitors exhibiting side effects, which is making difficulties during the treatment of chemotherapy. So, the study has design to identifying new natural compounds that are able to induce apoptosis by freeing up caspases and will be low toxic. To identify natural compound, a structure-based pharmacophore model to the protein active site cavity was generated following by virtual screening, molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. Initially, seven hit compounds were retrieved and based on molecular docking approach four compounds has chosen for further evaluation. To confirm stability of the selected drug candidate to the target protein the MD simulation approach were employed, which confirmed stability of the three compounds.

Our objective was to confirm the prediction accuracies of the RCFT-copy and CDT for cognitive impairment (CI) using convolutional neural network algorithms as a screening tool. METHODS: The CDT and RCFT-copy data were obtained from patients aged 60–80 years who had more than 6 years of education. In total, 747 CDT and 980 RCFT-copy figures were utilized. Convolutional neural network algorithms using TensorFlow (ver. 2.3.0) on the Colab cloud platform (www.colab.research.google.com) were used for preprocessing and modeling. We measured the prediction accuracy of each drawing test 10 times using this dataset with the following classes: normal cognition (NC) vs. mildly impaired cognition (MI), NC vs. severely impaired cognition (SI), and NC vs. CI (MI + SI). RESULTS: The accuracy of the CDT was better for differentiating MI (CDT, 78.04 ± 2.75; RCFT-copy, not being trained) and SI from NC (CDT, 91.45 ± 0.83; RCFT-copy, 90.27 ± 1.52); however, the RCFT-copy was better at predicting CI (CDT, 77.37 ± 1.77; RCFT, 83.52 ± 1.41). The accuracy for a 3-way classification (NC vs. MI vs. SI) was approximately 71% for both tests; no significant difference was found between them. CONCLUSIONS: The two drawing tests showed good performance for predicting severe impairment of cognition; however, a drawing test alone is not enough to predict overall CI. There are some limitations to our study: the sample size was small, all the participants did not perform both the CDT and RCFT-copy, and only the copy condition of the RCFT was used. Algorithms involving memory performance and longitudinal changes are worth future exploration. These results may contribute to improved home-based healthcare delivery.

19654,19654,19654,Comprehensive Evaluation of Primary Care Sports Medicine Fellowship Websites,18.220377,1.5619174,2021-07-16,"BACKGROUND: There were 2 major incentives introduced by the Chinese government to promote medical informatics in 2009 and 2016. As new drugs are the major source of medical innovation, informatics-related concepts and techniques are a major source of digital medical innovation. However, it is unclear whether the research efforts of medical informatics in China have met the health needs, such as disease management and population health. OBJECTIVE: We proposed an approach to mapping the interplay between different knowledge entities by using the tree structure of Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) to gain insights into the interactions between informatics supply, health demand, and technological applications in digital medical innovation in China. METHODS: All terms under the MeSH tree parent node “Diseases [C]” or node “Health [N01.400]” or “Public Health [N06.850]” were labelled as H. All terms under the node “Information Science [L]” were labelled as I, and all terms under node “Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]” were labelled as T. The H-I-T interactions can be measured by using their co-occurrences in a given publication. RESULTS: The H-I-T interactions in China are showing significant growth and a more concentrated interplay were observed. Computing methodologies, informatics, and communications media (such as social media and the internet) constitute the majority of I-related concepts and techniques used for resolving the health promotion and diseases management problems in China. Generally there is a positive correlation between the burden and informatics research efforts for diseases in China. We think it is not contradictory that informatics research should be focused on the greatest burden of diseases or where it can have the most impact. Artificial intelligence is a competing field of medical informatics research in China, with a notable focus on diagnostic deep learning algorithms for medical imaging. CONCLUSIONS: It is suggested that technological transfers, namely the functionality to be realized by medical/health informatics (eg, diagnosis, therapeutics, surgical procedures, laboratory testing techniques, and equipment and supplies) should be strengthened. Research on natural language processing and electronic health records should also be strengthened to improve the real-world applications of health information technologies and big data in the future.","Du, Jian; Chen, Ting; Zhang, Luxia",JMIR Med Inform,94,12

The primary outcome was the mortality of the final follow-up time and secondary outcomes were ICU mortality, the ICU length of stay and the number of ventilator-free days. RESULTS: A total of 7 RCTs were included, with 2166 patients admitted to the ICU. There was no significant difference in the primary outcome between the LOT and COT. Additionally, LOT could not significantly increase ICU mortality and the ICU length of stay compared with COT.

Last summer, two patients with C. Auris infections were admitted at University of Chicago Medicine (UCM). Environmental samples were collected to assess environmental contamination before and after cleaning. METHODS: Environmental samples were collected using 3M Sponge Sticks with neutralizing Buffer during one patientÕs stay, weeks after another patientÕs stay, and after enhanced terminal cleaning. Samples were cultured directly and yeast was identified using MALDI. The following surfaces were sampled: Bathroom sink drain, bedside table, bedrail, mattress, chair and window ledge. Routine terminal cleaning includes 10% sodium hypochlorite solution applied high touch surfaces of both room and bathroom. The enhanced terminal cleaning process used for these rooms included: (1) 10% sodium hypochlorite solution applied to all high touch surfaces and walls; (2) privacy curtains removed and replaced; (3) supervision by environmental services manager; and (4) single UV disinfection cycle in room and bathroom. RESULTS: Because of delay in identification of C auris for the first patient, pre-clean samples were taken >2 weeks after the patient had been discharged. During the intervening weeks, multiple patients had occupied the room and there had been >3 routine terminal cleanings. None of these samples were positive for C auris. Pre-clean, in-residence samples indicated C auris contamination of multiple surfaces for the second patient. Because of transfers within the institution, there are three sets of post-cleaning cultures for the second patient. All post-clean environmental cultures were negative for both patients. Results are shown in Figure 1. CONCLUSION: Candida auris can contaminate environmental surfaces. While routine terminal cleaning may have been effective in removing C auris from surfaces in one patientÕs room, the enhanced terminal cleaning strategy used here was effective in our facility.

But if groups interact separately, they will each develop a specialized code. This paper asks: Can organizations shape how people interact in order to create shared communication codes? What kinds of design interventions in communication structures and systems are useful? In laboratory experiments on triads composed of dyads that solve distributed coordination problems, we examine the effect of three factors: transparency of communication (versus privacy), role differentiation, and the subjects’ social history. We find that these factors impact the harmonization of dyadic codes into triadic codes, shaping the likelihood that groups develop group-level codes, converge on a single group-level code, and compress the group-level code into a single word. Groups with transparent communication develop more effective codes, while acyclic triads composed of strangers are more likely to use multiple dyadic codes, which are less efficient than group-level codes. Groups of strangers put into acyclic configurations appear to have more difficulty establishing “ground rules”—that is, the “behavioral common ground” necessary to navigate acyclic structures. These coordination problems are transient—groups of different structures end up with the same average communication performance if given sufficient time. However, lasting differences in the code that is generated remain.","Koçak, Özgecan; Warglien, Massimo",J Org Design,94,16

In practice, NBS are increasingly tied to an outward-looking, post-industrial urban growth agenda. This focus ignores interventions which are less visible, smaller scale, and serve a working-class population in still-industrial areas of the city. In this short piece, we consider various small-scale interventions undertaken by the Newtown Creek Alliance to accomplish demonstrable environmental improvements along the heavily polluted industrial waterway of Newtown Creek in New York City. Though largely invisible within the larger conversation on NBS and urban development, these interventions have the potential for substantive environmental improvement that benefits existing long-term residents and users rather than being a tool to attract new residents and luxury development. We offer this example as an attempt to diversify the “best practice” case studies that will inform future NBS growth.","Curran, Winifred; Hamilton, Trina",Socio Ecol Pract Res,94,5

The large-scale psychosocial impact of the pandemic and the subsequent lockdown, is an experiential reality for many, in India. Despite this impact, a closer look at India’s response to the pandemic shows that the two strands of health and relief measures, continue to occupy centre-stage. The psycho-social aspects of the pandemic unfortunately largely remain undocumented and unaddressed. Using experiences of iCALL, National national level psycho-social counseling counselling service and a field action project of the Tata Institute of Social Sciences, the paper throws light on the much-neglected experiential psycho-social dimensions of COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent lockdown in India. It describes the stressors experienced by users who approached iCALL and the consequent impact; especially among those who belonged to the vulnerable sections of the society. The nature of stressors as well as the impact reported by iCALL users, clearly points out to a complex interplay among several factors at individual, interpersonal, community and structural levels. The paper then, critically looks at the merits and limitations of the mental health framework that predominated the mental health response during the pandemic with its bio-medical and individualistic undertones; and suggests an alternative framing using a ‘psycho-social’ paradigm that views distress as an interaction between the psychological and social worlds. The paper asserts reciprocal linkages between development and psycho-social distress; highlighting the need to consciously integrate mental health issues into the development response. In the end, it makes an appeal for an inter sectoral dialogue, integrated response and advocacy for investing in mental health and psycho-social infrastructure to effectively respond to the pandemic.","Joshi, Aparna",J,94,22

This article focuses on key oil and gas jurisdictions in the region—namely, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam—and provides a comparative overview of the cost recovery mechanisms in each country. Despite the practical importance of understanding how the cost recovery regimes are intended to operate in each of the relevant jurisdictions, there remains a little detailed commentary on the relevant legislative and contractual frameworks. By tracking how each of the five jurisdictions has modified and adopted cost recovery provisions as it considers appropriate for its particular investment needs, and comparing the jurisdictions surveyed across a range of measures, as reflected in Table 8, this article aims to provide current and future market participants with insights on cost recovery, both to support investment decisions and provide context for disputes that may arise.","Lingard, Nicholas; Morgan, Philip; Apostolova, Kate; Tan, Jeremy",,94,1

We reach this conclusion by using ordinary least-squares (OLS) regressions of stock returns on the unobservable Gordon factors, which we estimate from firm-level valuation ratios D/P, P/E, and P/B. The effects from a decrease in implied growth outweigh those from an increase in discount rate by a factor of approximately 1.6 to 1.7. Also, firms with a decrease in implied growth show a stock return that is approximately 6.6% more negative than that of firms with no decrease in implied growth.

This study aimed to highlight the CT features of pediatric patients with COVID-19 with upper respiratory symptoms. RESULTS: The mean age of the 53 patients who enrolled in this study were 14.06 ± 4.12 years (range 1-18 years). Majority (75.5%) of them were adolescent. Running nose and fever were the most common symptoms. Forty-four (83%) patients had normal CT with no ground glass opacity (GGO) or consolidation, only 9 patients showed lung opacities; 5 cases showed consolidation, 2 cases with GGO, while consolidation with GGO was noted in another 2 patients. Among these 9 patient, six (66.7%) of them show unilateral lung opacities with peripheral distribution of these opacities in eight (88.9%) patients. The most frequently affected lobes were right and left lower lung lobes that were noted in 6 out of 9 patients with lung opacities (66.7%) in each lobe. Bronchitis was predominant in 23 (43.4%) cases. CONCLUSIONS: RT-PCR is a gold slandered test in the diagnosis of COVID-19 in children with upper respiratory tract symptoms as Chest CT cannot standalone as a diagnostic tool owing to high prevalence of normal chest CT in these patients. However, in case of lung affection, the presence of unilateral, peripheral consolidation with lower lobe predominance, in addition to bronchial wall thickening should be considered as a hallmark of chest CT in diagnosis of pediatric patients with COVID-19 with upper respiratory symptoms.","Samy, Marwa; Khalaf, Lamiaa M.

An adequate nutritional status, including micronutrient status is critical for pregnancy and offspring development; however, there is a lack of evidence regarding maternal dietary micronutrient intake and its relationship with BMI in the COVID-19 era. Henceforth, we sought to assess the adequacy of maternal dietary micronutrient intake and its relationship with BMI in pregnant women exposed to the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This prospective cohort study included 810 Chilean pregnant women (>18 years) enrolled between March and October 2020 in Santiago, Chile. Maternal lifestyle, anthropometric and dietary intake (24-hr recall, n = 389) information was collected in the first trimester by telephonic interviews and from clinical records. Folate, calcium, iron, vitamins B-6, B-12 and D intake was estimated using the USDA nutrient database. Pre-pregnancy BMI was categorized according to the WHO criteria. RESULTS: Overall, 70% of women were classified as overweight or obese. Median (IQR) daily intake was 1.3 (0.8–1.8) mg for B-6, 2.5 (1.3–4.4) µg for B-12, 284 (187–408) µg for folate, 26 (7.2–86) IU for vitamin D, 639 (391–951) mg for calcium and 9.9 (6.9–13.7) mg for iron. Of all, <10% met the daily intake recommendation (RDA) for folate, vitamin D, iron, and calcium, while <25% and 50% met the recommendation for B-6 and B-12, respectively. B-6 intake was inversely correlated with BMI (ρ = −0.15, P < 0.05; Spearman correlation test). Furthermore, B-6, B-12, folate, iron, and calcium intake significantly differed by pre-pregnancy BMI categories (P < 0.05; KruskalWallis test), with obese and overweight women having a lower intake compared to normal or underweight women. CONCLUSIONS: In this subgroup of Chilean pregnant women exposed to the COVID-19 pandemic, the inadequacy of micronutrient intake was highly prevalent, especially in women with excess weight; these results need to be confirmed with the complete sample and by including more detailed analyses of both diet and potential confounders but suggest a very concerning nutrition scenario emerging from the pandemic.

To achieve this, different forms of calcium, such as calcium nanoparticles (CaNPs), calcium phosphate (CaP), a binary blend of calcium and chitosan including CaNPs/Chitosan and CaP/Chitosan, as well as their tertiary blend including CaNPs–CaP/Chitosan, were prepared via both routine and green procedures using Salvia hispanica to reduce toxicity and increase nanoparticle stability (with a yield of 85%).

These conditions are possible complications in hospitalized patients that can extend hospital stay, result in unplanned readmission, and are associated with long-term disability and death. Despite strong evidence, many patients do not receive optimal thromboprophylaxis. VTE prevention is a top priority in healthcare systems worldwide. AIM The aim of the project was to establish a standardized hospital-wide VTE prevention program and to improve awareness of, and compliance with, best practice standards in the prevention of VTE. METHODS A multidisciplinary team utilized the Joanna Briggs Institute Practical Application of Clinical Evidence System program to facilitate the collection of pre and post implementation audit data. The Getting Research into Practice program was also used to conduct a situational analysis to identify barriers, enablers, and implementation strategies while taking into account the context in which the changes were to occur. Hospital-acquired VTE data were collected to monitor the impact, if any, on patient outcomes. The project was conducted in three different phases over a 2.5-year period in an acute care public hospital. RESULTS A comprehensive suite of professionally crafted guidelines, tools, and resources were developed to facilitate clinician acceptance of evidence-based practices. Comparison of compliance results showed variable improvements with four audit criteria. Formalized patient risk assessment improved to 7.5% with the introduction of a new form. High-risk patients receiving appropriate prophylaxis improved to 81% in medical and 83% in surgical patients, on an existing high background compliance rate. A total of 59% of staff attended a VTE update education in-service. No patients received information about adverse VTE events prior to discharge. The hospital-acquired VTE rate decreased slightly from 0.65 to 0.52 events per 1000 overnight bed days. CONCLUSION Overall the project achieved improvements in compliance with best practice standards. A number of delays and barriers contributed to some of the planned interventions not being fully implemented at the time of the follow-up audit. Contributing factors included the lack of electronic capabilities, some processes not being fully embedded into routine clinical workflows, lack of staff time, and identification of an additional organizational barrier relating to practical issues in providing patient education at discharge. A second action cycle is recommended in an attempt to further improve compliance, ensure intervention fidelity, and embed practices into routine daily workflows to positively impact patient and organizational outcomes.","Sykes, Pamela Kathleen; Walsh, Kenneth; Darcey, Chenqu Mimi; Hawkins, Heather Lee; McKenzie, Duncan Scott; Prasad, Ritam; Thomas, Anita",International journal of evidence-based healthcare,94,12

Results demonstrated the activation of JNK1/2 and p38 MAPK in PDCoV-infected cells, which occurred concomitant with viral biosynthesis and irrespective of cell type. Pharmacological inhibition or knockdown of either SAPK significantly attenuated PDCoV replication, whereas addition of a signaling activator augmented virus infectivity. Moreover, pharmacological inhibition of JNK1/2 or p38 MAPK activation was innocuous to viral entry but significantly detrimental to post uncoating stages of the replication cycle. Remarkably, cytokine gene expression in PDCoV-infected IPEC-J2 cells was modified by inhibiting the activation of either SAPK.

One strategy to overcome these issues is utilizing telemedicine, which is recently made possible technologically by the advancement of internet speed, high speed zooming cameras, and the information storages. In Taiwan, the telemedicine is granted legally by the amendment for Taiwan's Physician Act in 2018. METHODS Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital (Kaohsiung CGMH) is the first hospital in Taiwan to provide the telemedicine service connecting to Cheng Kung Branch of Taitung Hospital since Nov 2018. Consultation services from Dermatology, ENT, and Ophthalmology have been delivered in the live-interactive and face to face module every week. RESULTS Dermatology consultation comprises the majorities. In the first year, there were totally 426 dermatology consultation services. Eczema, fungal infections, and scabies infestation were the three most common diseases in the beginning. The disease diagnosis became more diverse after several months, including some ready-to-treat diseases pending correct diagnosis, such as pediculosis, psoriasis, and urticaria. Coupled with dermoscopic images, diseases such as hair loss, pediculosis capitis, skin tumor, and scabies, were diagnosed promptly. The subjective patient improvement rate was more than 75% year-round and the case closure rate was more than 85% year-round. CONCLUSION Teledermatology is a promising approach to serve the remote medical-underprivileged regions.

While compassion training has begun to emerge in healthcare education, there may be factors that facilitate or inhibit the uptake and implementation of training into practice. This review identified the attributes that explain the successes and/or failures of compassion training programs offered to practicing healthcare providers. METHODS Realist review methodology for knowledge synthesis was used to consider the contexts, mechanisms (resources and reasoning), and outcomes of compassion training for practicing healthcare providers to determine what works, for whom, and in what contexts. RESULTS Two thousand nine hundred ninety-one articles underwent title and abstract screening, 53 articles underwent full text review, and data that contributed to the development of a program theory were extracted from 45 articles. Contexts included the clinical setting, healthcare provider characteristics, current state of the healthcare system, and personal factors relevant to individual healthcare providers. Mechanisms included workplace-based programs and participatory interventions that impacted teaching, learning, and the healthcare organization. Contexts were associated with certain mechanisms to effect change in learners' attitudes, knowledge, skills and behaviors and the clinical process. CONCLUSIONS In conclusion this realist review determined that compassion training may engender compassionate healthcare practice if it becomes a key component of the infrastructure and vision of healthcare organizations, engages institutional participation, improves leadership at all levels, adopts a multimodal approach, and uses valid measures to assess outcomes.","Sinclair, Shane; Kondejewski, Jane; Jaggi, Priya; Roze des Ordons, Amanda L; Kassam, Aliya; Hayden, K Alix; Harris, Daranne; Hack, Thomas F",BMC medical education,94,1

This algorithmic process involves testing portions of specimens from separate individuals together as one unit (or ""group"") to detect diseases. Retesting is performed on groups that test positively in order to differentiate between positive and negative individual specimens. The overall goal is to use the least number of tests possible across all individuals without sacrificing diagnostic accuracy. One of the most efficient group testing algorithms is array testing. In its simplest form, specimens are arranged into a grid-like structure so that row and column groups can be formed. Positive-testing rows/columns indicate which specimens to retest. With the growing use of multiplex assays, the increasing number of diseases tested by these assays, and the availability of subject-specific risk information, opportunities exist to make this testing process even more efficient. We propose specific specimen arrangements within an array that can reduce the number of retests needed when compared with other array testing algorithms. We examine how to calculate operating characteristics, including the expected number of tests and the SD for the number of tests, and then subsequently find a best arrangement. Our methods are illustrated for chlamydia and gonorrhea detection with the Aptima Combo 2 Assay. We also provide R functions to make our research accessible to laboratories.","Bilder, Christopher R; Tebbs, Joshua M; McMahan, Christopher S",Statistics in medicine,94,1

HCoV-229E is a close relative of HCoV-NL63, and infection with either virus can lead to the hospitalization of young children, immunocompromised persons, and the elderly. Children infected with HCoV-NL63 often develop croup, with obstruction of the airway. In this study we investigated at which age children are confronted for the first time with an HCoV-NL63 infection and, thus, at which age they seroconvert to HCoV-NL63 positivity. We designed a recombinant HCoV-229E and a recombinant HCoV-NL63 nucleocapsid protein enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and performed a seroepidemiology survey on longitudinal and cross-sectional serum samples. The longitudinal serum samples were collected from 13 newborns, and data for those newborns were available from multiple time points spanning a period of at least 18 months. For the cross-sectional survey we tested serum samples of 139 children, including newborns to children 16 years of age. In examinations of the longitudinal serum samples we observed that all of the children had maternal anti-NL63 and anti-229E antibodies at birth that disappeared within 3 months. Seven of the 13 children became HCoV-NL63 seropositive during follow-up, whereas only 2 became HCoV-229E seropositive. The serology data of the cross-sectional serum samples revealed that 75% and 65% of the children in the age group 2.5 to 3.5 years were HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E seropositive, respectively. We conclude that on average, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E seroconversion occurs before children reach the age of 3.5 years.","Dijkman, Ronald; Jebbink, Maarten F; El Idrissi, Nawal Bahia; Pyrc, Krzysztof; Müller, Marcel A; Kuijpers, Taco W; Zaaijer, Hans L; van der Hoek, Lia",Journal of clinical microbiology,94,1

Although recent studies showed that MERS-CoV infection is associated with an attenuated IFN response, no induction of inflammatory cytokines was demonstrated during the early phase of infection. To study both early and late cytokine responses associated with MERS-CoV infection, we measured the mRNA levels of eight cytokine genes [TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IFN-β, monocyte chemotactic protein-1, transforming growth factor-β and IFN-γ-induced protein (IP)-10] in cell lysates of polarized airway epithelial Calu-3 cells infected with MERS-CoV or severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV up to 30 h post-infection. Among the eight cytokine genes, IL-1β, IL-6 and IL-8 induced by MERS-CoV were markedly higher than those induced by SARS-CoV at 30 h, whilst TNF-α, IFN-β and IP-10 induced by SARS-CoV were markedly higher than those induced by MERS-CoV at 24 and 30 h in infected Calu-3 cells. The activation of IL-8 and attenuated IFN-β response by MERS-CoV were also confirmed by protein measurements in the culture supernatant when compared with SARS-CoV and Sendai virus. To further confirm the attenuated antiviral response, cytokine response was compared with human HCoV-229E in embryonal lung fibroblast HFL cells, which also revealed higher IFN-β and IP-10 levels induced by HCoV-229E than MERS-CoV at 24 and 30 h. Whilst our data supported recent findings that MERS-CoV elicits attenuated innate immunity, this represents the first report to demonstrate delayed proinflammatory cytokine induction by MERS-CoV.

Visualization literacy skills are vital in understanding the world around us and constructing meaningful visualizations, yet, how to better develop these skills at an early age remains largely overlooked and understudied. Only recently has the visualization community started to fill this gap, resulting in preliminary studies and development of educational tools for use in early education. We add to these efforts through the exploration of gamification to support learning, and identify an opportunity to apply role-playing game-based designs by leveraging the presence of narratives in data-related problems involving visualizations. We study the effects of including narrative elements on learning through a technology probe, grounded in a set of design considerations stemming from visualization, game design and education science. We create two versions of a game - one with narrative elements and one without - and evaluate our instances on 33 child participants between 11- to 13-years old using a between-subjects study design. Despite participants requiring double the amount of time to complete their game due to additional narrative elements, the inclusion of such elements were found to improve engagement without sacrificing learning; our results indicate no significant differences in development of graph-reading skills, but significant differences in engagement and overall enjoyment of the game. We report observations and qualitative feedback collected, and note areas for improvement and room for future work.","Huynh, Elaine; Nyhout, Angela; Ganea, Patricia; Chevalier, Fanny",IEEE transactions on visualization and computer graphics,94,16

However, late results in terms of weight loss or weight regain are inconsistent and may warrant a second procedure. This retrospective study analyzes the laparoscopic options for revisional surgery after LRYGB. METHODS Between January 1, 2001 and December 31, 2009, 70 patients underwent a new laparoscopic procedure for poor weight loss or weight regain after LRYGB. The revisional procedure was performed a median of 2.6 years after the initial bypass operation. Fifty-eight patients were available for follow-up (82.9 %); 19 underwent distalization; and 39 a new restrictive procedure. RESULTS The mean mass index (BMI) before the revisional procedure was 39.1 + 11.3 kg/m(2) (30.8-51.8), down from 42.7 + 19.7 kg/m(2) (33.0-56.6) initially, which corresponded to a percentage of excess weight loss (EWL) of 12.4 + 9.3 % (-1.0-29.1). After the corrective procedure, with a follow-up of approximately 4 years, mean BMI was 29.6 + 12.4 kg/m(2) (18.0-45.5), for a significant additional percentage of EWL of 53.7 + 9.8 % (2.0-65.8). The overall complication rate was 20.7 %, and the reoperation rate was 7.3 %. The overall leak rate was 12.1 %. Patients suffering from leaks could consistently be treated conservatively or by stent placement. Two patients needed reconversion after distal bypass. The satisfaction index was good in just over 50 % of the patients. CONCLUSION Revisional laparoscopic surgery after RYGB performed for weight issues provides good additional weight loss but carries significant morbidity. Leaks can usually be handled non-surgically. Patient satisfaction is only fair.","Himpens, Jacques; Coromina, Laia; Verbrugghe, Anneleen; Cadière, Guy-Bernard",Obesity surgery,94,26

We aimed to develop a population (pop)PK/PD model to characterise the infliximab dose-exposure-biomarker-response (faecal calprotectin [fCal] and endoscopic remission [ER]) relationship. METHODS Data were obtained from 116 patients with CD in a phase 4 dose-escalation study. Three sequential models were developed: A two-compartment popPK model linking infliximab dose to exposure, an indirect response popPK-PD model describing the inhibitory effect of infliximab exposure on fCal, and a first-order Markov popPD model linking fCal to transitions between states of ER, no ER, and dropout. RESULTS Infliximab clearance increased with increasing fCal, decreasing albumin, increasing CD activity index and presence of anti-drug antibodies. Baseline fCal increased with increasing C-reactive protein and decreasing platelet count. Lower fCal increased the probability of attaining ER and decreased the probability of losing ER. Probability of dropping out given an earlier state of absence of ER increased with time. Large inter-patient PK and PD variability resulted in a flat dose-response curve. Predicted fraction of patients achieving ER was 45% [30-61] (median [interquartile range], N=50,000) when on 5 mg/kg infliximab (~46% observed in data). Simulations with 10 mg/kg induction doses predicted an increase to 48% [32-63]. This minor benefit at the population level argues against systematic 10 mg/kg induction dosing in all patients. CONCLUSIONS Model-informed infliximab dose optimisation towards a predefined fCal concentration (while accounting for PK and PD variability) may improve effectiveness of infliximab therapy.","Dreesen, Erwin; Berends, Sophie; Laharie, David; D'Haens, Geert; Vermeire, Séverine; Gils, Ann; Mathôt, Ron",British journal of clinical pharmacology,94,33

Payment is not the sort of benefit that justifies exposing subjects to risk. Alan Wertheimer has raised a serious challenge to this view, pointing out that in industry, social value is not considered necessary to make dangerous jobs ethical. This article argues that Wertheimer was correct to think that the ethics of hazard pay should be the same in medical research and in business. Nevertheless, a qualified social benefit requirement should apply in both fields. For a study or a job with significant net physical risk to be ethical, it must have social value beyond the satisfaction of ordinary preferences, including the preference for money. The requirement derives from a non-absolutist version of the doctrine of double effect. If a risky study or a dangerous job has no distinctive social value, and hazard pay is subjects' or workers' only reason to undergo risks, the very fact that they undergo risk is intended as a means to a financial end. Inviting people to enrol in such a study or to take such a job wrongfully treats people as mere means. By contrast, if a study or a job has social value, people can participate with a primary end other than money, even if they accept compensation. Researchers or employers do not intend but merely foresee risks to subjects or workers.","Hughes, Robert C",Journal of medical ethics,94,1

This calls for an easily manageable tool, permitting an all-purpose, cost-efficient, and secure viscerosynthesis. Such a tool for this field already exists: the Autosuture EndoStitch(®). In a series of studies the potential for the EndoStitch to accelerate suturing has been proven. However, its ergonomics still limits its applicability. The goal of this study was twofold: propose an optimized and partially automated EndoStitch and compare the conventional EndoStitch to the optimized and partially automated EndoStitch with respect to the speed and precision of suturing. METHODS Based on the EndoStitch, a partially automated suturing tool has been developed. With the aid of a DC motor, triggered by a button, one can suture by one-fingered handling. Using the partially automated suturing manipulator, 20 surgeons with different levels of laparoscopic experience successfully completed a continuous suture with 10 stitches using the conventional and the partially automated suture manipulator. Before that, each participant was given 1 min of instruction and 1 min for training. Absolute suturing time and stitch accuracy were measured. The quality of the automated EndoStitch with respect to manipulation was tested with the aid of a standardized questionnaire. RESULTS To compare the two instruments, t tests were used for suturing accuracy and time. Of the 20 surgeons with laparoscopic experience (fewer than 5 laparoscopic interventions, n=9; fewer than 20 laparoscopic interventions, n=7; more than 20 laparoscopic interventions, n=4), there was no significant difference between the two tested systems with respect to stitching accuracy. However, the suturing time was significantly shorter with the Autostitch (P=0.01). The difference in accuracy and speed was not statistically significant considering the laparoscopic experience of the surgeons. The weight and size of the Autostitch have been criticized as well as its cable. However, the comfortable handhold, automatic needle change, and ergonomic manipulation have been rated positive. CONCLUSION Partially automated suturing in minimally invasive surgery offers advantages with respect to the speed of operation and ergonomics. Ongoing work in this field has to concentrate on minimization, implementation in robotic systems, and development of new operation methods (NOTES).","Göpel, Tobias; Härtl, Felix; Schneider, Armin; Buss, Martin; Feussner, Hubertus",Surgical endoscopy,94,16

Yet, the incidence of PA in the general population has not been studied. OBJECTIVE To estimate the incidence of PA in the general population. DESIGN AND METHODS Patients who had received a diagnostic code for PA between 1987 and 2016 were identified in the Swedish National Patient Registry. Assessment of clinical and biochemical data was used to validate the diagnosis. The annual incidence of PA was calculated by using the number of inhabitants in the Västra Götaland County as reference. RESULTS Of 570 identified patients, 473 (83 %) had confirmed PA. Eligible for the incidence analysis were 416 patients, 248 (60%) men and 168 (40%) women, diagnosed with PA between 1987-2016. The mean (±standard deviation) age at diagnosis was 56±12 years. The median (interquartile range) annual incidence was 2 (1-2) cases per million between 1987 and 1996, 6 (4-9) cases per million between 1997 and 2006 and 17 (12-24) cases per million between 2007 and 2016. At the end of the study (December 31 st 2016), 386 patients with confirmed PA were alive and living in the Västra Götaland County, giving a prevalence of 231 cases per million (0.022%). CONCLUSIONS Despite increasing incidence, the proportion of patients identified with PA is lower than expected. Given the serious consequences of untreated PA, the noticeably low prevalence at the end of the study stresses the need to increase the awareness of PA among health care providers.","Gkaniatsa, Eleftheria; Ekerstad, Eva; Gavric, Manuela; Muth, Andreas; Trimpou, Penelope; Olsson, Daniel S; Johannsson, Gudmundur; Ragnarsson, Oskar",The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,94,24

Here, we propose an innovative in situ modification strategy for constructing ultrapure BiVO4 nanosheets on graphene (u-BVG) toward the accelerated photocatalytic water oxidation reaction. Considering the Mott-Schottky heterojunctions at the contact interface in u-BVG, the feasible electron transfer from excited BiVO4 to graphene facilitates the holes to migrate onto the BiVO4 surface for the water oxidation reaction. Compared with the conventional synthesis strategies, our strategy avoids the introduction of Cl impurities. This modification allows for not only a ca. 0.1 eV deeper valence band edge position to generate holes with a stronger oxidation potential but the extraction of the impurity level to suppress the carrier recombination. And density functional theory calculations are in accordance with the above results. Impressively, these merits endow the u-BVG with ca. 16.8 times growth in the amount of ˙OH radicals derived from OH-/H2O oxidation, an over 260% enhancement in O2 yield and a 1.6-fold increase in the apparent quantum efficiency relative to the impure counterpart. This work paves the way for the reconstruction of graphene-based binary systems with high performance in solar-to-chemical energy conversion.","Liu, Siyuan; Pan, Jian; Li, Xin; Meng, Xin; Yuan, Hao; Li, Yao; Zhao, Yixin; Wang, Dawei; Ma, Jun; Zhu, Shenmin; Kong, Lingti",Nanoscale,94,1

This study aimed at determining the mechanisms of myocardial localization and fast liver clearance of (99m)Tc-TMEOP. METHODS Subcellular distribution of (99m)Tc-TMEOP was determined in excised rat heart tissue by differential centrifugation. The effect of cyclosporin A on the pharmacokinetic behaviour of (99m)Tc-TMEOP was evaluated by both ex vivo biodistribution and in vivo planar imaging studies. RESULTS Subcellular distribution studies showed that more than 73% of (99m)Tc-TMEOP was associated with the mitochondrial fraction. Comparison with subcellular distribution of (99m)Tc-sestamibi showed no significant difference in the mitochondrial accumulation between the two tracers. Biodistribution studies in the presence of cyclosporin A revealed an increase in kidneys and liver uptake of (99m)Tc-TMEOP, suggesting the involvement of multidrug resistance transporters in determining its pharmacokinetic profile. CONCLUSIONS The heart uptake mechanism of (99m)Tc-TMEOP is similar to that of the other reported monocationic (99m)Tc cardiac agents and is associated with its accumulation in the mitochondria. Cyclosporin A studies indicate that the fast liver and kidney clearance kinetics is mediated by P-glycoprotein (Pgp), supporting the potential interest of this radiotracer for imaging Pgp function associated with multidrug-resistant tumours.","Mendes, Filipa; Gano, Lurdes; Fernandes, Célia; Paulo, António; Santos, Isabel",Nuclear medicine and biology,94,14

METHODS We enrolled 174 patients who underwent cholecystectomy and retrospectively evaluated the outcomes of patients in the SC and CM groups. RESULTS Significant differences in age (71.1 vs. 61.9 years), American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status (ASA-PS), and serum C-reactive protein levels (CRP) (18.1 vs. 4.7 mg/dL) were observed between the CM and SC groups. Conversely, no significant differences were observed in the operation time (129 vs. 108 min), amount of blood loss (147 vs. 80 mL), intraoperative complications (0% vs. 5.7%), or duration of hospital stay (13.2 vs. 8.9 days) between the 2 groups. A high conversion rate (35.3%), postoperative complications (33%), and frequent drain insertions (94%) were observed in the CM group. CONCLUSIONS CM is a safe and valid surgical procedure and surgeons should not hesitate to transition to CM for patients who are of advanced age, in poor general condition (high ASA classification), or have high levels of serum CRP.","Tsukada, Tomoya; Nakano, Tatsuo; Miyata, Takashi; Sasaki, Shozo; Ohta, Tetsuo",BMC gastroenterology,94,0

BACKGROUND SARS-CoV-2 is the betacoronavirus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. It was listed as a potential global health threat by WHO due to high mortality, high basic reproduction number and lack of clinically approved drugs and vaccines for COVID-19. The genomic sequence of the virus responsible for COVID-19, as well as the experimentally determined three dimensional structure of the Main protease are available. OBJECTIVE To identify potential drugs that can be repurposed for treatment of COVID-19 by using molecular docking based virtual screening of all approved drugs. METHODS List of drugs approved for clinical use was obtained from SuperDRUG2 database. The structure of the target in the apo form, as well as structures of several target-ligand complexes, were obtained from RCSB PDB. The structure of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro determined from X-ray diffraction data was used as the target. Data regarding drugs in clinical trials for COVID-19 was obtained from clinicaltrials.org. Input for molecular docking based virtual screening was prepared by using Obabel and customized python, bash and awk scripts. Molecular docking calculations were carried out with Vina and SMINA, and the docked conformations were analyzed and visualized with PLIP, Pymol and Rasmol. RESULTS Among the drugs that are being tested in clinical trials for COVID-19, Danoprevir and Darunavir have the highest binding affinity for the target main protease of SARS-CoV-2. Saquinavir and Beclabuvir were identified as the best novel candidates for COVID-19 therapy by using Virtual Screening of drugs approved for other clinical indications.

Despite significant research efforts, neurology remains one of the most failure-prone areas of drug development. The complexity of the human brain, boundaries to examining the brain directly in vivo, and the significant evolutionary gap between animal models and humans, all serve to hamper translational success. Recent advances in microfluidic in vitro models have provided new opportunities to study human cells with enhanced physiological relevance. The ability to precisely micro-engineer cell-scale architecture, tailoring form and function, has allowed for detailed dissection of cell biology using microphysiological systems (MPS) of varying complexities from single cell systems to ""Organ-on-chip"" models. Simplified neuronal networks have allowed for unique insights into neuronal transport and neurogenesis, while more complex 3D heterotypic cellular models such as neurovascular unit mimetics and ""Organ-on-chip"" systems have enabled new understanding of metabolic coupling and blood-brain barrier transport.

Leptin plays a role in these processes; levels are decreased following bariatric surgery, creating a relative leptin insufficiency. We previously showed that leptin administration in a weight-reduced state after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) caused no further weight loss. Here, we discuss the impact of leptin administration on gut hormones, glucostasis, and appetite. Weight stable women after RYGB were randomized to receive placebo or recombinant human metreleptin (0.05 mg/kg twice daily). At weeks 0 and 16, a liquid meal challenge was performed. Glucose, insulin, C-peptide, GLP-1, PYY, glucagon, and ghrelin (total, acyl, and desacyl) were measured fasting and postprandially. Appetite was assessed using a visual analog scale. Mean post-op period was 53 ± 2.3 months; mean BMI was 34.6 ± 0.2 kg/m(2). At 16 weeks, there was no significant change in weight within or between groups. Fasting PYY was significantly different between groups and the leptin group had lower sweets craving at week 16 than the placebo group (P < 0.05). No other differences were observed. Leptin replacement does not alter gut hormones or glucostasis but may diminish sweet cravings compared to placebo in this population of post-RYGB women.","Conroy, Rushika; Febres, Gerardo; McMahon, Donald J; Thorner, Michael O; Gaylinn, Bruce D; Conwell, Irene; Aronne, Louis; Korner, Judith",International journal of endocrinology,94,19

In an attempt to address these shortcomings, Motiva Ergonomix implants have been introduced. Here, the authors describe the current world's largest experience with these novel devices in aesthetic breast surgery and evaluate the postoperative outcome of 100 primary breast augmentations. METHODS A retrospective assessment of 100 consecutive primary breast augmentation patients over a period of 3 years was conducted. Patients were followed for a minimum of 6 months postoperatively. Demographics, surgical data, and complications were recorded. In addition, a survey regarding the breast augmentation outcome was performed. RESULTS The reasons for surgery were mainly hypoplasia (52 percent) and ptosis (28 percent). All implants were placed by means of an inframammary approach in a submuscular pocket, and the average implant volume was 370 cc (range, 150 to 700 cc) with mostly full projection (65 percent). The revision rate was 7 percent. The authors observed four cases of implant malpositioning, one implant rupture, one implant exchange for aesthetic reasons, and one hematoma evacuation. Nevertheless, the authors achieved a 100 percent satisfaction rate with the postsurgical outcome among both patients and surgeons. CONCLUSIONS Motiva Ergonomix implants provide reliable and satisfying results for both patients and surgeons. They can be used safely and effectively for aesthetic breast surgery. However, like all breast prostheses, Motiva Ergonomix implants are not completely free of complications and should be used only with advanced technique to achieve optimal results.

We hypothesized that RYGBP provides superior results. DESIGN Matched-pair study in patients with a body mass index (BMI) less than 50. SETTING University hospital and regional community hospital with a common bariatric surgeon. PATIENTS Four hundred forty-two patients were matched according to sex, age, and BMI. INTERVENTIONS Laparoscopic GB or RYGBP. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Operative morbidity, weight loss, residual BMI, quality of life, food tolerance, lipid profile, and long-term morbidity. RESULTS Follow-up was 92.3% at the end of the study period (6 years postoperatively). Early morbidity was higher after RYGBP than after GB (17.2% vs 5.4%; P<.001), but major morbidity was similar. Weight loss was quicker, maximal weight loss was greater, and weight loss remained significantly better after RYGBP until the sixth postoperative year. At 6 years, there were more failures (BMI>35 or reversal of the procedure/conversion) after GB (48.3% vs 12.3%; P<.001). There were more long-term complications (41.6% vs 19%; P.001) and more reoperations (26.7% vs 12.7%; P<.001) after GB. Comorbidities improved more after RYGBP. CONCLUSIONS Roux-en-Y gastric bypass is associated with better weight loss, resulting in a better correction of some comorbidities than GB, at the price of a higher early complication rate.

However, the low femtomolar to attomolar concentration of nucleic acids in human samples require sensors with excellent detection capabilities; many past and current platforms fall short or are economically difficult. Strand-mediated signal amplifiers such as hybridization chain reaction (HCR) and catalytic hairpin assembly (CHA) are superior methods for detecting trace amounts of biomolecules because one target molecule triggers the continuous production of synthetic double-helical DNA. This cascade event is highly discriminatory to the target via sequence specificity, and it can be coupled with fluorescence, electrochemistry, magnetic moment, and electrochemiluminescence for signal reporting. Here, we review recent advances in enhancing the sensing abilities in HCR and CHA for improved live-cell imaging efficiency, lowered limit of detection, and optimized multiplexity. We further outline the potential for clinical translatability of HCR and CHA by summarizing progress in employing these two tools for in vivo imaging, human sample testing, and sensing-treating dualities.

METHODS Thirty-two intensive care unit survivors were prospectively evaluated from February 2017 to August 2018 in a post-intensive care unit outpatient clinic in Brazil. Individuals with intensive care unit stays > 72 hours (emergency admissions) or > 120 hours (elective admissions) attending the post-intensive care unit clinic four months after intensive care unit discharge were consecutively enrolled. The association between the 6-Minute Walk Test distance at baseline and physical functional status was assessed over 8 months using the Barthel Index. RESULTS The mean 6-Minute Walk Test distance was significantly lower in intensive care unit survivors than in the general population (405m versus 557m; p < 0.001). Age (β = -4.0; p < 0.001) and muscle weakness (β = -99.7; p = 0.02) were associated with the 6-Minute Walk Test distance. A 6-Minute Walk Test distance was associated with improvement in physical functional status over the 8-month follow-up (odds ratio for each 10m of 1.07; 95%CI 1.01 - 1.16; p = 0.03).

In the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic, we assessed whether those trained through these programmes were involved in the COVID-19 response and if so, in which area(s) of the emergency response they were applying their skills. Methods: From the records for each training programme, we identified the individuals who had completed training during the relevant timespan of each programme: 1999-2018 for the CRDF scheme, 2015-2020 for PGTS, and 2009-2019 for SORT-IT. Between March and April 2020, we sent trainees an online questionnaire by e-mail. Results: Out of 1254 trained, 1143 could be contacted and 699 responded to the survey. Of the latter, 411 were involved with the COVID-19 response, of whom 315 (77%) were applying their acquired skills in 85 countries. With some overlap between programmes, 84% of those trained through CRDF were applying their skills in 27 countries, 91% of those trained through PGTS were applying their skills in 19 countries, and through SORT IT, this was 73% in 62 countries. Skills were being applied in various areas of the emergency response, including: emergency preparedness, situation analysis/surveillance, infection control and clinical management, data generation, mitigating the effect of COVID on the health system, and research. Depending on the type of training programme, 26-74% were involved in implementation, operational or clinical research. Conclusion: Research training programmes build research capacity and equip health workers with transferable core competencies and skillsets prior to epidemics. This becomes invaluable in building health system resilience at a time of pandemics.","Zachariah, Rony; Maher, Dermot; Aseffa, Abraham; Vahedi, Mahnaz; Launois, Pascal; Khogali, Mohammed; Aslanyan, Garry; Reeder, John C",F1000Research,94,1

Despite a plethora of available treatment options, a substantial portion of the hypertensive population has uncontrolled blood pressure. The unmet need of controlling blood pressure in this population may be addressed, in part, by developing new drugs and devices/procedures to treat hypertension and its comorbidities. In this Compendium Review, we discuss new drugs and interventional treatments that are undergoing preclinical or clinical testing for hypertension treatment. New drug classes, eg, inhibitors of vasopeptidases, aldosterone synthase and soluble epoxide hydrolase, agonists of natriuretic peptide A and vasoactive intestinal peptide receptor 2, and a novel mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist are in phase II/III of development, while inhibitors of aminopeptidase A, dopamine β-hydroxylase, and the intestinal Na(+)/H(+) exchanger 3, agonists of components of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2/angiotensin(1-7)/Mas receptor axis and vaccines directed toward angiotensin II and its type 1 receptor are in phase I or preclinical development. The two main interventional approaches, transcatheter renal denervation and baroreflex activation therapy, are used in clinical practice for severe treatment resistant hypertension in some countries. Renal denervation is also being evaluated for treatment of various comorbidities, eg, chronic heart failure, cardiac arrhythmias and chronic renal failure. Novel interventional approaches in early development include carotid body ablation and arteriovenous fistula placement. Importantly, none of these novel drug or device treatments has been shown to prevent cardiovascular disease outcomes or death in hypertensive patients.","Oparil, Suzanne; Schmieder, Roland E",Circulation research,94,1

These included large event bans, school closures, closures of entertainment venues, gyms, bars, and restaurant dining areas, and shelter-in-place orders (SIPOs). We evaluated the impact of these measures on the growth rate of confirmed COVID-19 cases across US counties between March 1, 2020 and April 27, 2020. An event-study design allowed each policy's impact on COVID-19 case growth to evolve over time. Adoption of government-imposed social distancing measures reduced the daily growth rate by 5.4 percentage points after 1-5 days, 6.8 after 6-10 days, 8.2 after 11-15 days, and 9.1 after 16-20 days. Holding the amount of voluntary social distancing constant, these results imply 10 times greater spread by April 27 without SIPOs (10 million cases) and more than 35 times greater spread without any of the four measures (35 million). Our paper illustrates the potential danger of exponential spread in the absence of interventions, providing relevant information to strategies for restarting economic activity.

Methods: The following databases were searched: MEDLINE and EMBASE via OVID, CINAHL and SPORTDiscus via EBSCO, from database inception to 31 st January 2018. Inclusion criteria were: (i) randomised controlled clinical trials (RCTs) or study of intervention with a comparator; (ii) participants with diagnosis of acute complete rupture of the UCL of the thumb; (iii) participants aged 18 years of age or older at enrolment; and (iv) published in a peer-reviewed English-language journal. Results: In total, six studies were identified for inclusion after screening. All studies had a high risk of bias. Three studies were retrospective comparative case series which compared two different surgical techniques (bone anchor versus pull out suture, suture versus pull out suture, suture versus steel wire). Of these studies, three were RCTs, two of which compared different rehabilitation regimes in patients managed surgically (plaster versus early mobilization, new spica versus standard spica). The remaining RCT compared two different rehabilitation regimes in a mixed group of surgically/non-surgically treated patients. The RCT comparing a standard spica with a new spica demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in outcomes with the new spica at all time points (range of motion, Dreiser index and VAS); this was also the only study to provide sufficient outcome data for further analysis. Conclusion: There is no prospective evidence comparing surgery to non-operative treatment for acute complete ruptures of the ulnar collateral ligament of the thumb. There is weak evidence to suggest that early mobilisation may be beneficial following surgical repair. Further research is necessary to better define which patients benefit from which specific interventions.","Mikhail, Mark; Wormald, Justin C R; Thurley, Neal; Riley, Nicholas; Dean, Benjamin J F",F1000Research,94,16

This study analyzes the correlation between tumor size and malignancy in patients with nonfunctioning pancreatic endocrine tumors. METHODS All patients with nonfunctioning pancreatic endocrine tumors who underwent curative resection (R0) at our institution between 1990 and 2008 were considered. Their clinicopathologic characteristics were compared among 3 different groups according to tumor size. Univariate and multivariable analyses were performed. RESULTS Over the study period, 177 patients were identified. Overall, 90 patients (51%) had a tumor size ≤2 cm (group 1), 46 (26%) had tumor size between >2 cm and ≤4 cm (group 2), and 41 (23%) had tumor size >4 cm (group 3). Tumors ≤2 cm were more frequently incidentally discovered (group 1, 57% vs group 2, 51% vs group 3, 32%; P = .014) and benign (group 1, 81% vs group 2, 65% vs group 3, 5%; P < .0001). The presence of a nonfunctioning pancreatic endocrine tumor >2 cm and a nonincidental diagnosis of the tumor were independent predictors of malignancy at multivariable analysis. None of the 51 patients (29%) with a pancreatic endocrine tumor ≤2 cm that was incidentally diagnosed died of disease. CONCLUSION A strict correlation between tumor size and malignancy in nonfunctioning pancreatic endocrine tumors was demonstrated. A nonoperative management could be advocated for tumors ≤2 cm when discovered incidentally.","Bettini, Rossella; Partelli, Stefano; Boninsegna, Letizia; Capelli, Paola; Crippa, Stefano; Pederzoli, Paolo; Scarpa, Aldo; Falconi, Massimo",Surgery,94,1

Given the increased contact from families living in virtual confinement coupled with massive economic disarray, the Covid-19 pandemic may have created the ideal conditions to witness a rise in children's experience of abuse and neglect. Yet such a rise will be difficult to calculate given the drop in official mechanisms to track its incidence. The current investigation utilized two studies conducted early in the pandemic to evaluate maltreatment risk. In the first cross-sectional study, parents (n = 405) reported increased physical and verbal conflict and neglect which were associated with their perceived stress and loneliness. In the second study, parents (n = 106) enrolled in a longitudinal study reported increased parent-child conflict, which was associated with concurrent child abuse risk, with several links to employment loss, food insecurity, and loneliness; findings also demonstrated increases in abuse risk and psychological aggression relative to pre-pandemic levels. Findings are discussed in the context of a reactive welfare system rather than a pro-active public-health oriented approach to child maltreatment, connecting with families through multiple avenues.

Mycoplasma pneumoniae is one of the major causative pathogens of CAP. Early diagnosis of M. pneumoniae pneumonia is crucial for initiating appropriate antibiotic therapy. The aim of this study was to determine whether the Japanese Respiratory Society (JRS) guidelines on CAP are effective for diagnosing M. pneumoniae pneumonia. METHODS Between August 2008 and July 2009, adult outpatients with CAP were consecutively enrolled. The aetiology of CAP was determined by culture and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods to detect M. pneumoniae, urine antigen tests to detect Streptococcus pneumoniae and Legionella pneumoniae, blood and sputum culture for bacteria and real-time PCR for eight common respiratory viruses. The predictive value of the JRS guidelines for differentiating M. pneumoniae pneumonia from typical bacterial and viral pneumonias was determined. RESULTS Data from 215 adult CAP outpatients was analyzed. An aetiological diagnosis was made for 105 patients (48.8%), including 62 patients with M. pneumoniae pneumonia, 17 patients with typical bacterial pneumonia and 23 patients with viral pneumonia. According to the JRS criteria for differential diagnosis of atypical pneumonia, 55 of 62 patients were correctly diagnosed with M. pneumoniae pneumonia (sensitivity 88.7%), and 31 of 40 patients with bacterial and viral pneumonia were correctly excluded (specificity 77.5%). CONCLUSIONS The JRS guidelines on CAP provide a useful tool for the identification of M. pneumoniae pneumonia cases and differentiating these from cases of typical bacterial or viral pneumonia.","Yin, Yu-Dong; Zhao, Fei; Ren, Li-Li; Song, Shu-Fan; Liu, Ying-Mei; Zhang, Jian-Zhong; Cao, Bin",Respirology,94,26

If a gastric tube can be guided into the esophagus under direct vision with a video laryngoscope, misplacement of the gastric tube into the trachea can be avoided. We compared gastric tube insertion under direct vision using a video laryngoscope with the conventional method of blind insertion. METHODS We enrolled 60 patients who required a transnasal gastric tube to facilitate elective abdominal surgery under general anesthesia. The participants were recruited consecutively into one of two groups, a group of 30 patients in whom a gastric tube was inserted using a King Vision™ video laryngoscope (KV group), and a group of 30 patients who underwent conventional blind insertion of the gastric tube (Blind group). The success rate, the time taken to insert the gastric tube, and the incidence of complications were compared. RESULTS In the KV group, the time required for gastric tube placement was 52.5 ± 17.1 seconds, with a success rate of 100%. Slight oral hemorrhage occurred in two participants and slight epistaxis in one participant. In the Blind group, the time required for gastric tube placement was 65.9 ± 39.9 seconds, with a success rate of 90% (27 out of 30 patients). Slight oral hemorrhage occurred in two participants, slight epistaxis occurred in two participants, and tracheal malposition occurred in one participant but was detected promptly and corrected using the video laryngoscope. There were no significant differences in the time required for placing the gastric tube, the success rate, or the incidence of complications between the groups. CONCLUSIONS Gastric tube insertion using a King Vision video laryngoscope was straightforward, and was particularly useful for detecting and correcting tracheal malpositioning.

OBJECTIVES To assess the effectiveness of cloth and medical masks for preventing SARS-CoV-2 transmission in community settings. METHODS Two rapid reviews were conducted searching three electronic databases (PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library) and two clinical trials registries on 30 and 31 March 2020. RESULTS We screened 821 records and assessed nine full-text articles for eligibility. One and seven RCTs were included for cloth and medical mask reviews, respectively. No SARS-CoV-2-specific RCTs and no cloth mask RCTs in community settings were identified. A single hospital-based RCT provided indirect evidence that, compared with medical masks, cloth masks probably increase clinical respiratory illnesses (relative risk (RR) 1.56; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.98 - 2.49) and laboratory-confirmed respiratory virus infections (RR 1.54; 95% CI 0.88 - 2.70). Evidence for influenza-like illnesses (ILI) was uncertain (RR 13.00; 95% CI 1.69 - 100.03). Two RCTs provide low-certainty evidence that medical masks may make little to no difference to ILI infection risk versus no masks (RR 0.98; 95% CI 0.81 - 1.19) in the community setting. Five RCTs provide low-certainty evidence that medical masks may slightly reduce infection risk v. no masks (RR 0.81; 95% CI 0.55 - 1.20) in the household setting. CONCLUSIONS Direct evidence for cloth and medical mask efficacy and effectiveness in the community is limited. Decision-making for mask use may consider other factors such as feasibility and SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics; however, well-designed comparative effectiveness studies are required.","Chetty, T; Ramokolo, V; Rees, K; Kredo, T; Balakrishna, Y; Mathews, C; Siegfried, N",South African medical journal = Suid-Afrikaanse tydskrif vir geneeskunde,94,1

One such side effect is chemotherapy-induced cognitive impairment or 'chemobrain'. Rodent models are commonly used to investigate pathogenesis and potential therapeutic strategies. However, concerns have been raised regarding inadequacies in reporting of animal studies rendering them unreliable and irreproducible. The aim of this systematic review was to assess compliance with the ARRIVE reporting guidelines in peer-reviewed publications evaluating chemotherapy-induced cognitive changes in rodent models, and to determine if the introduction of the ARRIVE guidelines has improved quality of reporting. A comprehensive search was conducted to identify relevant peer-reviewed publications. Ninety-seven studies met the eligibility criteria, and publication compliance with the ARRIVE guideline reporting was assessed. No studies achieved full adherence with the ARRIVE guidelines. Furthermore, no significant improvement was demonstrated in the overall compliance score post-ARRIVE.

Here we report genome-wide data from 174 ancient individuals from The Bahamas, Haiti and the Dominican Republic (collectively, Hispaniola), Puerto Rico, Curaçao and Venezuela, which we co-analysed with 89 previously published ancient individuals. Stone-tool-using Caribbean people, who first entered the Caribbean during the Archaic Age, derive from a deeply divergent population that is closest to Central and northern South American individuals; contrary to previous work4, we find no support for ancestry contributed by a population related to North American individuals. Archaic-related lineages were >98% replaced by a genetically homogeneous ceramic-using population related to speakers of languages in the Arawak family from northeast South America; these people moved through the Lesser Antilles and into the Greater Antilles at least 1,700 years ago, introducing ancestry that is still present. Ancient Caribbean people avoided close kin unions despite limited mate pools that reflect small effective population sizes, which we estimate to be a minimum of 500-1,500 and a maximum of 1,530-8,150 individuals on the combined islands of Puerto Rico and Hispaniola in the dozens of generations before the individuals who we analysed lived. Census sizes are unlikely to be more than tenfold larger than effective population sizes, so previous pan-Caribbean estimates of hundreds of thousands of people are too large5,6. Confirming a small and interconnected Ceramic Age population7, we detect 19 pairs of cross-island cousins, close relatives buried around 75 km apart in Hispaniola and low genetic differentiation across islands. Genetic continuity across transitions in pottery styles reveals that cultural changes during the Ceramic Age were not driven by migration of genetically differentiated groups from the mainland, but instead reflected interactions within an interconnected Caribbean world1,8.","Fernandes, Daniel M; Sirak, Kendra A; Ringbauer, Harald; Sedig, Jakob; Rohland, Nadin; Cheronet, Olivia; Mah, Matthew; Mallick, Swapan; Olalde, Iñigo; Culleton, Brendan J; Adamski, Nicole; Bernardos, Rebecca; Bravo, Guillermo; Broomandkhoshbacht, Nasreen; Callan, Kimberly; Candilio, Francesca; Demetz, Lea; Carlson, Kellie Sara Duffett; Eccles, Laurie; Freilich, Suzanne; George, Richard J; Lawson, Ann Marie; Mandl, Kirsten; Marzaioli, Fabio; McCool, Weston C; Oppenheimer, Jonas; Özdogan, Kadir T; Schattke, Constanze; Schmidt, Ryan; Stewardson, Kristin; Terrasi, Filippo; Zalzala, Fatma; Antúnez, Carlos Arredondo; Canosa, Ercilio Vento; Colten, Roger; Cucina, Andrea; Genchi, Francesco; Kraan, Claudia; La Pastina, Francesco; Lucci, Michaela; Maggiolo, Marcio Veloz; Marcheco-Teruel, Beatriz; Maria, Clenis Tavarez; Martínez, Christian; París, Ingeborg; Pateman, Michael; Simms, Tanya M; Sivoli, Carlos Garcia; Vilar, Miguel; Kennett, Douglas J; Keegan, William F; Coppa, Alfredo; Lipson, Mark; Pinhasi, Ron; Reich, David",Nature,94,16

DESIGN We retrospectively reviewed all patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy with intraoperative cholangiography by a single surgeon from April 2010 to September 2011. Cholangiogram time, demographic, and operative information was recorded, and factors associated with increased cholangiogram times were compared using Fisher's exact test, Kruskal-Wallis test, and linear regression; a p value <0.05 was considered significant. SETTING Academic-affiliated community-based surgical residency program. PARTICIPANTS 10 surgical residents, PGY 1-5. RESULTS Laparoscopic cholecystectomy with intraoperative cholangiography was performed in 54 patients. The average patient age was 43 years; 69% were Caucasian and 74% were female. Cholangiography was successful in 96% of patients. The average time for cholangiograms performed by residents was 11 minutes (range, 6-22 minutes) and average operating room time was 68 minutes (range, 32-103 minutes). The average percentage of case time for cholangiography was 17% (range, 9%-63%). Minor technical complications related to cholangiograms occurred in 33% of cases, with the most common being difficulty with clipping the catheter (20%). There was no significant difference in completion rate or cholangiogram time based on resident level of experience (p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS Intraoperative cholangiogram can be safely performed by residents at every level during laparoscopic cholecystectomy without adding significant time to the operation.","Hope, William W; Bools, Lindsay; Hooks, W Borden; Adams, Ashley; Kotwall, Cyrus A; Clancy, Thomas V",Journal of surgical education,94,31

Seven types of coronavirus can infect humans. DEVELOPMENT Coronaviruses are not always confined to the respiratory tract, and under certain conditions they can invade the central nervous system and cause neurological pathologies. The potential for neuroinvasion is well documented in most human coronaviruses (OC-43, 229E, MERS and SARS) and in some animal coronaviruses (porcine haemagglutinating encephalomyelitis coronavirus). Neurological symptoms have been reported in patients affected by COVID-19, such as headache, dizziness, myalgia and anosmia, as well as cases of encephalopathy, encephalitis, necrotising haemorrhagic encephalopathy, stroke, epileptic seizures, rhabdomyolysis and Guillain-Barre syndrome, associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. CONCLUSIONS Future epidemiological studies and case records should elucidate the real incidence of these neurological complications, their pathogenic mechanisms and their therapeutic options.","Carod-Artal, F J",Revista de neurologia,94,1

Optimum strategies to elicit both systemic and mucosal immunity are critical for the development of vaccines against HIV-1. We therefore sought to evaluate the induction of systemic and mucosal immune responses by the use of Newcastle disease virus (NDV) as a vaccine vector. We generated a recombinant NDV, designated rLaSota/gp160, expressing the gp160 envelope (Env) protein of HIV-1 from an added gene. The gp160 protein expressed by rLaSota/gp160 virus was detected on an infected cell surface and was incorporated into the NDV virion. Biochemical studies showed that gp160 present in infected cells and in the virion formed a higher-order oligomer that retained recognition by conformationally sensitive monoclonal antibodies. Expression of gp160 did not increase the virulence of recombinant NDV (rNDV) strain LaSota. Guinea pigs were administered rLaSota/gp160 via the intranasal (i.n.) or intramuscular (i.m.) route in different prime-boost combinations. Systemic and mucosal antibody responses specific to the HIV-1 envelope protein were assessed in serum and vaginal washes, respectively. Two or three immunizations via the i.n. or i.m. route induced a more potent systemic and mucosal immune response than a single immunization by either route. Priming by the i.n. route was more immunogenic than by the i.m. route, and the same was true for the boosts. Furthermore, immunization with rLaSota/gp160 by any route or combination of routes induced a Th1-type response, as reflected by the induction of stronger antigen-specific IgG2a than IgG1 antibody responses. Additionally, i.n. immunization elicited a stronger neutralizing serum antibody response to laboratory-adapted HIV-1 strain MN.3. These data illustrate that it is feasible to use NDV as a vaccine vector to elicit potent humoral and mucosal responses to the HIV-1 envelope protein.","Khattar, Sunil K; Samal, Sweety; Devico, Anthony L; Collins, Peter L; Samal, Siba K",Journal of virology,94,1

Furthermore, we aimed to explore whether geographical differences or different detection modalities are associated with the conflicting information regarding HPV and the development of the disease. METHODS We searched the MEDLINE, EMBASE and Scopus databases for studies reporting on HPV and conjunctival intraepithelial neoplasia or carcinoma. The pooled prevalence proportions, odds ratio (OR) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals were calculated assuming a random-effects model. Subgroup analyses and meta-regression explored possible sources of heterogeneity. RESULTS A total of 39 studies were included in the systematic review. The pooled prevalence of HPV in conjunctival intraepithelial neoplasia and carcinoma was 26%, with HPV16, 18, and 33 being the most frequently reported genotypes. Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection was associated with an increased risk of conjunctival intraepithelial neoplasia and carcinoma (OR 8.4, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.7-19.1); lower in studies from African countries (OR 1.7, 95% CI 0.9-3.5) than other countries (OR 16.1, 95% CI 5.8-44.3), p = 0.013. CONCLUSION Human papillomavirus infection increases the odds of conjunctival intraepithelial neoplasia and carcinoma by 8.4 compared to healthy conjunctival mucosa or other ocular surface diseases. There seem to be geographical differences regarding HPV in conjunctival intraepithelial neoplasia and carcinoma. HPV16 was the most prevalent genotype, followed by HPV18 and HPV33, meaning that most of the HPV-related conjunctival intraepithelial neoplasia and carcinoma may be prevented by the HPV vaccines that are currently available.","Ramberg, Ingvild; Møller-Hansen, Michael; Toft, Peter Bjerre; Funding, Mikkel; Heegaard, Steffen",Acta ophthalmologica,94,1

Several previous studies reported an over-risk of arterial and venous thrombosis, in particular pulmonary embolism and venous thrombosis of catheter in COVID19 patients in intensive care unit. However, arteriovenous fistula (AVF) thrombosis has rarely been reported yet in these patients. AVF thrombosis is a serious complication that impacts significantly patients outcome. Here, we aim to describe characteristics and prognosis of a cohort of COVID-19 hemodialysis (HD) patients presenting with AVF thrombosis. METHODS In the Ile de France region (Paris area) during the March 11th-April 30th 2020 period, fistula thrombosis cases were collected among COVID-19 hemodialysis patients in seven dialysis units and in interventional vascular departments. These patients' characteristics were analyzed through a review of the patient's medical records. RESULTS Seventeen patients were included in our study (median age 69 years). Ten patients (59%) were men. Ten patients (59%) were diabetic and 88% had a high blood pressure. The mortality rate in these patients was 47%. All thrombosis treated with a declotting procedures (64%) were successfully cleared, but with early relapse in 36%. CONCLUSION Our study highlights AVF thrombosis as a severe complication in COVID-19 hemodialysis patients that contributed to the severity and accelerated death.","Desbuissons, Geoffroy; Michon, Arthur; Attias, Philippe; Burbach, Maren; Diaconita, Mirela; Karie-Guiges, Svetlana; Novelli, Luigi; Abou Rjeili, Marawa; Awad, Sameh; Besse, Francis; Viglietti, Denis; Beaudreuil, Severine; Zaidan, Mohamad; Lefèvre, Edouard; Hebibi, Hadia",The journal of vascular access,94,1

Endotracheal tubes with different cuff shapes may lead to different cuff pressures after positional change. We hypothesized that the intracuff pressure in the TaperGuard™ ETT with a tapered-shaped cuff would be higher than that in the conventional ETT with a cylindrical-shaped cuff after a change from the supine to the lateral flank position. METHODS Fifty-eight patients scheduled for open urological procedures in the lateral flank position were randomly allocated to receive either a TaperGuard ETT (group T) or conventional ETT (group C). The ETT cuff pressure was initially set at 20 cm H2O in the supine position and was measured after the change to the lateral flank position. The distance from the ETT tip to the carina was measured in both the supine and the lateral flank positions. RESULTS Two patients, one from each group, were excluded from the data analysis. The mean (SD) ETT cuff pressure was significantly higher in group T (n = 28) than in group C (n = 28) after the change in position [31 (7) cm H2O vs 25 (4) cm H2O, respectively; mean difference, 6 cm; 95% confidence intervals [CI], 3 to 9; P < 0.001]. The mean (SD) proximal migration of the ETT tip was comparable between the two groups [8 (18) mm vs 4 (14) mm, respectively; P = 0.367]. CONCLUSIONS After the change from the supine to the lateral flank position, the ETT cuff pressure was significantly higher in the TaperGuard ETT than in the conventional ETT, although the extent of cephalad displacement of the ETT was comparable between the two groups.

MATERIALS AND METHODS The initial 44 consecutive patients with esophageal cancer who underwent minimally invasive esophagectomy were statistically analyzed retrospectively. Thoracic cage area was measured from preoperative computed tomography as a factor affecting the surgical difficulty of minimally invasive esophagectomy, as well as other patient characteristics. Correlations with short-term outcomes including chest operation time, blood loss, and morbidity rate were then examined. RESULTS In univariate analyses, smaller area of the upper thoracic cage width correlated with prolonged thoracic procedure time (p = 0.0119) and greater blood loss during thoracic procedures (p = 0.0283), but area of the lower thoracic cage showed no correlations. History of respiratory disease was associated with thoracic procedure time (p < 0.0001), but not blood loss. In multivariate analysis, small area of the upper thoracic cage was independently associated with prolonged thoracic procedure time (p = 0.0253). Small upper thoracic cage area was not directly correlated with morbidity rate, but prolonged thoracic procedure time was associated with increased blood loss (p < 0.0001) and morbidity rate (p = 0.0204). Empirical time reduction (p = 0.0065), but not blood loss, was associated with thoracic procedure time. However, area of the upper thoracic cage did not correlate with empirical case number. In multivariate analysis, area of the upper thoracic cage (p = 0.0317) and empirical case number (p = 0.0193) correlated independently with thoracic procedure time. CONCLUSION A small area of the upper thoracic cage correlated significantly with prolonged thoracic procedure time and increased thoracic blood loss for minimally invasive esophagectomy in the left lateral decubitus position, suggesting the surgical difficulty of minimally invasive esophagectomy in the left lateral decubitus position.","Takeno, Shinsuke; Tanoue, Yukinori; Hamada, Rouko; Kawano, Fumiaki; Tashiro, Kousei; Wada, Takashi; Ikenoue, Makoto; Nanashima, Atsushi; Nakamura, Kunihide",Surgical endoscopy,94,24

The amount, size, and position of the applied ports, their distance as well as the distance between the three operator arms of the robot, external and internal collisions, and complications of the procedures were recorded and analyzed. We were able to perform all planned surgical procedures with 3 mm robotic instruments in piglets with a median body weight of less than 7 kg. We encountered two non-robot associated complications (bleeding from the inferior caval and hepatic vein) which led to termination of the live procedures. Technical limitations were the reaction time and speed of robotic camera movement with eye tracking, the excessive bending of the 3 mm instruments and intermittent need of re-calibration of the fulcrum point. Robotic newborn and infant surgery appears technically feasible with the Senhance® system. Software adjustments for camera movement and sensitivity of the fulcrum point calibration algorithm to adjust for the increased compliance of the abdominal wall of infants, therefore reducing the bending of the instruments, need to be implemented by the manufacturer as a result of our study.

METHODS In a retrospective study, data from patients who underwent SLL after laparoscopic myomectomy between January 2007 and June 2012 at Juntendo University Hospital, Tokyo, were assessed for the incidence of port-site adhesions forming below RET incisional scars when fascial and peritoneal defects had not been closed. RESULTS During the study period, 554 patients underwent SLL, and 2176 incisional scars were examined. Adhesions were detected in 15 patients (2.8%); thus, the incidence of port-site adhesions under scars was 0.7% (15/2176). Among these 15 patients, the wounds with adhesions were located as follows: 6 (1.1%) under the umbilical scar, 5 (0.9%) under the right lower abdominal scar, 2 (0.4%) under the left upper abdominal scar, and 2 (0.4%) under the left lower abdominal scar. According to multiple regression analysis, the duration of laparoscopic myomectomy was positively associated with port-site adhesions (odds ratio, 1.79; 95% confidence interval, 1.09-2.94; P=0.02).

From 2006-2009 outbreaks of BTV in northern Europe inflicted major disruption and economic losses to farmers and several attempts were made to implicate Palaearctic Culicoides species as vectors. Results from these studies were difficult to interpret as they used semi-quantitative RT-PCR (sqPCR) assays as the major diagnostic tool, a technique that had not been validated for use in this role. In this study we validate the use of these assays by carrying out time-series detection of BTV RNA in two colony species of Culicoides and compare the results with the more traditional isolation of infectious BTV on cell culture. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS A BTV serotype 1 strain mixed with horse blood was fed to several hundred individuals of Culicoides sonorensis (Wirth & Jones) and C. nubeculosus (Mg.) using a membrane-based assay and replete individuals were then incubated at 25°C. At daily intervals 25 Culicoides of each species were removed from incubation, homogenised and BTV quantified in each individual using sqPCR (Cq values) and virus isolation on a KC-C. sonorensis embryonic cell line, followed by antigen enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). In addition, comparisons were also drawn between the results obtained with whole C. sonorensis and with individually dissected individuals to determine the level of BTV dissemination. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE Cq values generated from time-series infection experiments in both C. sonorensis and C. nubeculosus confirmed previous studies that relied upon the isolation and detection of infectious BTV. Implications on the testing of field-collected Culicoides as potential virus vectors by PCR assays and the use of such assays as front-line tools for use in diagnostic laboratories in this role are discussed.","Veronesi, Eva; Antony, Frank; Gubbins, Simon; Golding, Nick; Blackwell, Alison; Mertens, Peter Pc; Brownlie, Joe; Darpel, Karin E; Mellor, Philip S; Carpenter, Simon",PloS one,94,31

The K. pneumoniae sequence type (ST) 307 lineage has appeared in several different parts of the world after first being described in Europe in 2008. From June to October 2019, we recorded an outbreak of an extensively drug-resistant ST307 lineage in four medical facilities in north-eastern Germany. METHODS Here, we investigated these isolates and those from subsequent cases in the same facilities. We performed whole-genome sequencing to study phylogenetics, microevolution, and plasmid transmission, as well as phenotypic experiments including growth curves, hypermucoviscosity, siderophore secretion, biofilm formation, desiccation resilience, serum survival, and heavy metal resistance for an in-depth characterization of this outbreak clone. RESULTS Phylogenetics suggest a homogenous phylogram with several sub-clades containing either isolates from only one patient or isolates originating from different patients, suggesting inter-patient transmission. We identified three large resistance plasmids, carrying either NDM-1, CTX-M-15, or OXA-48, which K. pneumoniae ST307 likely donated to other K. pneumoniae isolates of different STs and even other bacterial species (e.g., Enterobacter cloacae) within the clinical settings. Several chromosomally and plasmid-encoded, hypervirulence-associated virulence factors (e.g., yersiniabactin, metabolite transporter, aerobactin, and heavy metal resistance genes) were identified in addition. While growth, biofilm formation, desiccation resilience, serum survival, and heavy metal resistance were comparable to several control strains, results from siderophore secretion and hypermucoviscosity experiments revealed superiority of the ST307 clone, similar to an archetypical, hypervirulent K. pneumoniae strain (hvKP1). CONCLUSIONS The combination of extensive drug resistance and virulence, partly conferred through a ""mosaic"" plasmid carrying both antibiotic resistance and hypervirulence-associated features, demonstrates serious public health implications.","Heiden, Stefan E; Hübner, Nils-Olaf; Bohnert, Jürgen A; Heidecke, Claus-Dieter; Kramer, Axel; Balau, Veronika; Gierer, Wolfgang; Schaefer, Stephan; Eckmanns, Tim; Gatermann, Sören; Eger, Elias; Guenther, Sebastian; Becker, Karsten; Schaufler, Katharina",Genome medicine,94,1

METHODS Prior to the Covid-19 epidemic, the Makasi community-based cohort followed 850 immigrants from sub-Saharan Africa in the Greater Paris area. Between the 1st of April and the 7th of June 2020, all participants scheduled for a follow-up survey were systematically included into an additional COVID-19-related wave of data collection (N = 100). We compared participants' type of housing, level of food insecurity, work and mental health (PHQ9) before and during the first COVID-19-related lockdown, using paired-Mc Nemar chi-2 tests. We next described their level of information on Covid-19 and policy measures, broken down by sex. RESULTS Among the 100 participants, 68% had no legal residence permit. Food insecurity was more often reported during lockdown than before (62% vs 52%). 9% of participants had a score indicative of severe depression (PHQ9) before lockdown and 17% afterwards (p = 0.17). Only 51% knew about the possibility of asymptomatic transmission of the COVID-19 virus. CONCLUSIONS This study brings original information on a hard-to-reach population group. Our results suggest that the lockdown had a detrimental impact on various economic and mental health aspects among disadvantaged migrants residing in the Greater Paris area.","Gosselin, Anne; Melchior, Maria; Carillon, Séverine; Gubert, Flore; Ridde, Valéry; Kohou, Veroska; Zoumenou, Iris; Senne, Jean-Noël; Desgrées du Loû, Annabel",Journal of psychosomatic research,94,16

Although objective indicators showed strong economic growth in terms of a rise in per capita GDP and public revenue as well as a decline in unemployment rate, subjective indicators revealed that local residents were less than optimistic about their own employment outlook and did not perceive any improvement in their overall economic situation. While casino liberalization brought forth tremendous economic gain, the general population did not subjectively feel the benefits.

Methods We used a comparison group of 502 patients diagnosed with myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). Participants completed a standardized symptom questionnaire and a list of additional CDC COVID-19 symptoms. Results Over time, the long-haulers reported an overall reduction of most symptoms including unrefreshing sleep and post-exertional malaise, but an intensification of neurocognitive symptoms. When compared to ME/CFS, the COVID-19 sample was initially more symptomatic for the immune and orthostatic domains but over time, the long-haulers evidenced significantly less severe symptoms than those with ME/CFS, except in the orthostatic domain. Among the COVID-19 long haulers, several neurocognitive symptoms got worse over time, whereas improvements occurred in most other areas. Conclusions These types of differential patterns of symptoms over time might contribute to helping better understand the pathophysiology of those reporting prolonged illness following COVID-19.","Jason, Leonard A; Islam, Mohammed; Conroy, Karl; Cotler, Joseph; Torres, Chelsea; Johnson, Mady; Mabie, Brianna","Fatigue : biomedicine, health & behavior",94,17

We now demonstrate that loss of function of the endosomal GTPase Rab35 in human brain tumor initiating cells (BTICs) increases glioblastoma growth and decreases animal survival following BTIC implantation in mouse brains. Mechanistically, we identify that the GTPase Arf5 interacts with the guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for Rab35, DENND1/connecdenn, and allosterically enhances its GEF activity toward Rab35. Knockdown of either Rab35 or Arf5 increases cell migration, invasiveness, and self-renewal in culture and enhances the growth and invasiveness of BTIC-initiated brain tumors in mice. RNAseq of the tumors reveals up-regulation of the tumor-promoting transcription factor SPOCD1, and disruption of the Arf5/Rab35 axis in glioblastoma cells leads to strong activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor, with resulting enhancement of SPOCD1 levels. These discoveries reveal an unexpected cascade between an Arf and a Rab and indicate a role for the cascade, and thus endosomal trafficking, in brain tumors.","Kulasekaran, Gopinath; Chaineau, Mathilde; Piscopo, Valerio Emilio Crescenzo; Verginelli, Federica; Fotouhi, Maryam; Girard, Martine; Tang, Yeman; Dali, Rola; Lo, Rita; Stifani, Stefano; McPherson, Peter S",The Journal of cell biology,94,1

Currently, TiLV has been reported in 16 countries, and this number is continuing to rise due to improved diagnostic assays and surveillance activities around the world. In this review, we summarize the up-to-date knowledge of TiLV with regard to TiLV host species, the clinical signs of a TiLV infection, the affected tissues, pathogenesis and potential disease risk factors.

Concurrently, Lévy noise is a well-established approach to model systems characterized by statistical outliers and diverging higher order moments, ranging from gene expression control to the movement patterns of animals and humans. Here, we study the problem of Lévy noise-driven escape from an almost rectangular, arctangent potential well restricted by two absorbing boundaries, mostly under the action of the Cauchy noise. We unveil analogies of the observed transient dynamics to the general properties of stationary states of Lévy processes in single-well potentials. The first-escape dynamics is shown to exhibit exponential tails. We examine the dependence of the escape on the shape parameters, steepness, and height of the arctangent potential. Finally, we explore in detail the behavior of the probability densities of the first-escape time and the last-hitting point.","Capała, Karol; Padash, Amin; Chechkin, Aleksei V; Shokri, Babak; Metzler, Ralf; Dybiec, Bartłomiej",Chaos,94,29

Support comes from M/EEG studies, showing reduced auditory N1 and P2 responses to self-compared to externally generated events, or when stimulus properties are more predictable (e.g. prototypical). The current study examined the sensitivity of N1 and P2 responses to statistical regularities of speech. We employed a motor-to-auditory paradigm comparing ERP responses to externally and self-generated pseudowords, varying in phonotactic probability and syllable stress. We expected to see N1 and P2 suppression for self-generated stimuli, with greater suppression effect for more predictable features such as high phonotactic probability and first syllable stress in pseudowords. We observe an interaction between phonotactic probability and condition on the N1 amplitude, with an enhanced effect of phonotactic probability in processing self-generated stimuli. However, the directionality of this effect was reversed compared to what was expected, namely a larger N1 amplitude for high probability items, possibly indicating a perceptual bias toward the more predictable item. We further observed an effect of syllable stress on the P2 amplitude, with greater amplitudes in response to first syllable stress items. The current results suggest that phonotactic probability plays an important role in processing self-generated speech, supporting feedforward models involved in speech production.","Emmendorfer, Alexandra K.; Bonte, Milene; Jansma, Bernadette M.; Kotz, Sonja A.",bioRxiv,94,5

There are limited data about the coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19)-related organisational responses and the challenges of expanding a critical care service in a resource-limited setting. Objectives. To describe the ICU organisational response to the pandemic and the main outcomes of the intensive care service of a large state teaching hospital in South Africa. Methods. Data were extracted from administrative records and a prospective patient database with ethical approval. An ICU expansion plan was developed, and resource constraints identified. A triage tool was distributed to referring wards and hospitals. Intensive care was reserved for patients who required invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV). The total number of ICU beds was increased from 25 to 54 at peak periods, with additional non-COVID ICU capacity required during the second wave. The availability of nursing staff was the main factor limiting expansion. A ward-based high flow nasal oxygen (HFNO) service reduced the need for ICU admission of patients who failed conventional oxygen therapy. A team was established to intubate and transfer patients requiring ICU admission but was only available for the first wave. Results. We admitted 461 COVID-19 patients to the ICU over a 13-month period from 5 April 2020 to 5 May 2021 spanning two waves of admissions. The median age was 50 years and duration of ICU stay was 9 days. More than a third of the patients (35%;n=161) survived to hospital discharge. Conclusions. Pre-planning, leadership, teamwork, flexibility and good communication were essential elements for an effective response. A shortage of nurses was the main constraint on ICU expansion. HFNO may have reduced the requirement for ICU admission, but patients intubated after failing HFNO had a poor prognosis.","Michell, W. L.; Joubert, I. A.; Peters, S.; Fredericks, D. L.; Miller, M. G.

Using total RNA sequencing (“metatranscriptomics”) we documented the presence of contaminant viral sequences in multiple libraries of ‘blank’ negative control sequencing libraries that comprise a sterile water and reagent mix. Accordingly, we identified 14 viral sequences in 7 negative control sequencing libraries. As in previous studies, several circular replication-associated protein encoding (CRESS) DNA virus-like sequences were recovered in the blank libraries, as well as contaminating sequences from the RNA virus families Totiviridae, Tombusviridae and Lentiviridae.

Though models predict this complexity is due to convergent inputs from neurons with diverse response properties, in most vertebrate systems convergence has only been inferred rather than tested directly. Here we measure sensory computations in zebrafish vestibular neurons across multiple axes in vivo. We establish that whole-cell physiological recordings reveal tuning of individual vestibular afferent inputs and their postsynaptic targets. An independent approach, serial section electron microscopy, supports the inferred connectivity. We find that afferents with similar or differing preferred directions converge on central vestibular neurons, conferring more simple or complex tuning, respectively. Our data also resolve a long-standing contradiction between anatomical and physiological analyses by revealing that sensory responses are produced by sparse but powerful inputs from vestibular afferents. Together these results provide a direct, quantifiable demonstration of feedforward input convergence in vivo.","Liu, Zhikai; Kimura, Yukiko; Higashijima, Shin-ichi; Hildebrand, David G.; Morgan, Joshua L.; Holy, Timothy E.; Bagnall, Martha W.",bioRxiv,94,13

However, simulation studies have suggested an increased risk of COVID-19 related morbidity for older individuals inoculated by house-bound children. This study examines whether the March 2020 lockdown in New York City (NYC) was associated with higher COVID-19 hospitalization rates in neighborhoods with larger proportions of multigenerational households. Methods: We obtained daily age-segmented COVID-19 hospitalization counts in each of 166 ZIP code tabulation areas (ZCTAs) in NYC. Using Bayesian Poisson regression models that account for spatiotemporal dependencies between ZCTAs, as well as socioeconomic risk factors, we conducted a difference-in-differences study amongst ZCTA-level hospitalization rates from February 23 to May 2, 2020. We compared ZCTAs in the lowest quartile of multigenerational housing to other quartiles before and after the lockdown. Findings: Among individuals over 55 years, the lockdown was associated with higher COVID-19 hospitalization rates in ZCTAs with more multigenerational households. The greatest difference occurred three weeks after lockdown: Q2 vs. Q1: 54% increase (95% Bayesian credible intervals: 22 to 96%); Q3 vs. Q1: 48%, (17 to 89%); Q4 vs. Q1: 66%, (30 to 211%). After accounting for pandemic-related population shifts, a significant difference was observed only in Q4 ZCTAs: 37% (7 to 76%). Interpretation: By increasing house-bound mixing across older and younger age groups, city-wide lockdown mandates imposed during the growth of COVID-19 cases may have inadvertently, but transiently, contributed to increased transmission in multigenerational households.","Ghosh, A.

To characterize air pollutants affected by lockdown, trend and rate of changes were carried out using Mann-Kandle and Sen's slope methods, while spatial variability across the cities was done using ArcGIS and statistics within ArcGIS. The substantial reduction of mean concentrations in the range of 30–65%, 20–80%, 30 - 80%, 65 - 90% and 75 - 90% across the cities is found during lockdown compared to typical mean in previous years for the PM2.5, PM10, SO2, CO, and NO2 concentrations in air.

Design Observational cohort study. Setting University affiliated teaching hospital and tertiary referral center for Asherman's syndrome in The Netherlands from March 2020 to March 2021. Patients or Participants Women with AS, eligible for treatment were included. Interventions The first consult and pre-operative screening took place with a phone interview. The diagnosis, treatment and follow-up protocol were explained. Women were triaged on basis of their symptoms and infection exposure status and whether or not a face-to-face visit with the anesthesiologist was required. If eligible for treatment, they were given the opportunity to schedule a see and treat procedure with propofol sedation. All women who decide to proceed with surgery were treated with the standard AS protocol with special Covid-19 precaution measurements. At the recovery unit, women were asked to fill in a questionnaire. Measurements and Main Results 137 women were operated in 32 sessions between March 2020 and March 2021. Patients were matched with a cohort prior to the Covid-19 pandemic. Baseline characteristics were reported. Patients rated their satisfaction with hearing the explanation about the disease and upcoming treatment by the practitioner over the phone, the assisting on-site nurse's capability, quality of care of the treatment, convenience, and overall understanding and explanation by the practitioner post operatively. Women with AS who were treated in our center during the Covid-pandemic were equally satisfied with the information at first visit, explanation, treatment and follow-up as women in their matched cohort prior to the pandemic. Conclusion Patients with AS who were referred to our center, were offered COVID-19 adjusted protocol to inform, diagnose, treat and follow-up on their condition. Women were equally satisfied with the care provided.","Hanstede, M. M.",Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology,94,1

Chemical assays suggested a triterpene linked to polyphenol known as saponin. CHN Elements analysis (35.9% C; 5.5% H) did not identified nitrogen suggesting a polyphenol or glycoside. VU-Vis spectra gave high peak at below 200nm with a secondary peak at 275nm with minor hinge at 578nm indicating a fused ring with bromo-polyphenol. CU1 Mass (897 Daltons) with fragments of 515, 325, 269, 180 daltons and six halogen substitutions reflected by 82 molecular mass of DBr deviate six larger fragments. FT-IR suggested broad band at 3500-3000 cm−1 for −OH where as two strong peaks at 1552cm−1 for aromatic C=C and 1408cm−1 for phenol. Proton-NMR confirmed polymeric phenol at δ 4.86-4.91 ppm and tetratet at δ3.57-3.618 ppm with phenolic bromo-substituents. Carbon-NMR identified a strong peak at δ=23.7ppm for many C-Br and at 165ppm for a polybenzoid compound. CU1 inhibited the RNA Polymerase of E. coli (IC50=23μg/ml) and M. tuberculosis (IC50=34μg/ml) but not DNA polymerase.

173144,173144,173144,Impact of covid lockdown on autopsy cases: A comparative study,18.117748,1.6689898,2020,"Background: The PIPPRA (Physiotherapist-led Intervention to Promote Physical Activity in Rheumatoid Arthritis) project is a feasibility project examining the impact of a physical activity behaviour change intervention in people who have rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The PIPPRA study recruitment commenced in October 2019, with participant assessment and intervention commencing in November 2019. In the Republic of Ireland people who have RA are categorised as high risk category for Covid-19, due to immunosuppression [1], although this categorisation contrasts with EULAR's provisional recommendations [2]. Objectives: To examine the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic and public health restrictions on a pilot randomised controlled feasibility study in 2020. Methods: Participants (aged 18 years+, diagnosis of RA, independently mobile and low levels of physical activity [3]) were recruited from a rheumatology clinic at an urban hospital. Target recruitment was four participants per month for one year (N=48). Assessments were planned at baseline, eight and twenty-four weeks (N=144). Participants were randomised to intervention group or control group. The intervention group received four 1:1 sixty minute sessions with a physiotherapist (N=96). The intervention was delivered over eight weeks. Intervention and control groups received a physical activity information leaflet. Results: The Covid-19 pandemic and associated public health restrictions forced the study to be formally paused in April 2020 and the study formally resumed in August 2020. N=48 participants were recruited between October 2019 and March 2020 (six months). N=20 participants have commenced in the study, N=16 are awaiting baseline assessment, N=6 withdrew and N=6 were lost to follow-up prior to baseline. Trial protocol planned for the delivery of N=55 assessments and N=36 intervention sessions for participants who had commenced in the study. N=22 assessments and N=26 intervention sessions were delivered between November 2019 and March 2020. N=5 assessments and N=6 intervention sessions were conducted between August and October 2020. No assessment or intervention delivery occurred in November-December 2020 due to participant hesitancy in attending for assessment and/or intervention with increased public health restrictions. The impact of Covid-19 restrictions resulted in N=33 (60%) deviations from assessment protocol and N=10 (27%) deviations from intervention delivery protocol (Figure 1). Conclusion: The Covid-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the delivery of the PIPPRA study. Feasibility study outcomes, including participant retention rate, and study delivery as per protocol, have been affected due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Participant reluctance to attend face-to-face sessions demonstrates the need to consider alternative methods of delivery, e.g. virtual delivery of interventions, where attending in person is not acceptable to participants [4], in future studies.","Larkin, L.; Moses, A.; Gallagher, S.; Fraser, A.; Esbensen, B.

SAE includes delirium, premature death, post-traumatic stress disorder, and major long-term cognitive impairment. The underlying pathophysiology of SAE is largely unresolved and specific treatment options are missing. We induced the peritoneal contamination and infection (PCI) sepsis model in 769 mice and compared these with 259 control mice. We found that experimental sepsis causes synaptic pathology in the brain characterized by severely disordered synaptic plasticity with reduced long-term potentiation, changes in CA1 pyramidal neuron dendritic spines, and behavioral abnormalities indicating cognitive dysfunction. Using electrophysiology, we found reduced frequency of quantal and spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents whereas amplitudes of miniature, spontaneous, and evoked excitatory currents were increased, pointing towards a homeostatic synaptic scaling mechanism. Corresponding to dysfunctional excitatory synaptic function we discovered downregulation of genes related to neuronal and synaptic signaling in the brain, including the gene for activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein (Arc/Arg3.1), members of the transcription-regulatory EGR gene family, and the gene for dual-specificity phosphatase 6 (Dusp6). At the protein level, ARC expression and MAP kinase signaling in the brain were affected. For targeted rescue of dysfunctional synaptic signaling and plasticity, we overexpressed ARC in the hippocampus by microinjection of an adeno-associated virus containing a neuron-specific plasmid of the ARC transgene. Hereby we achieved recovery of defective synaptic plasticity in the hippocampal Schaffer collateral-CA1 pathway and improvement of memory dysfunction. Using a different rescue paradigm, PCI mice were subjected to enriched environment providing multiple activating stimuli. Enriched environment led to restoration of disordered long-term potentiation and memory, thus demonstrating the potential for activity-induced improvement. Together, we identified synaptic pathomechanisms of SAE after severe systemic infection and provide a conceptual approach to treat SAE-related disease mechanisms which may be applicable to patients afflicted with SAE.","Grünewald, Benedikt; Wickel, Jonathan; Hahn, Nina; Hörhold, Franziska; Rupp, Hanna; Chung, Ha-Yeun; Haselmann, Holger; Strauss, Anja S.; Schmidl, Lars; Hempel, Nina; Grünewald, Lena; Urbach, Anja; Bauer, Michael; Toyka, Klaus V.; Blaess, Markus; Claus, Ralf A.; König, Rainer; Geis, Christian",bioRxiv,94,1

It is essential to understand the intellectual and cognitive personal resources students use to deal with the unique problems and issues of the first year. Attention and their appraisal of their own problem-solving skills can be presented as one of the primary personal resources. These resources should be considered in terms of student-centered and personalized, healthy, and sustainable learning. This dimension of learning is of great importance, especially in the emergency distance education process due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The objective of the study is to investigate the relationship between problem-solving appraisal, attention, and visuospatial skills of first-year architecture students. The research is an experimental study. Neuropsychological assessment tools and scales were used. There are Turkish standardization studies for these neuropsychological assessment tools. These tools have norm values on a healthy sample, which were benefited as control group scores. For visuospatial skills, Raven Standard Progressive Matrices test and Benton Judgment of Line Orientation test;for attention, STROOP test TBAG version were administrated. Problem-Solving Appraisal Inventory were given to record the students' their own validation and assessment on their own problem-solving skills. Participants were volunteer first-year architecture students, who complied with the inclusion criteria. The sample was composed of 40 (26, %65.0, female, 14, %35.0, male) students. Age range was 18-22. It was observed that the students participating in the study evaluated their own problem-solving skills positively. It was found that female participants evaluated their problem-solving skills as more advanced regarding to planfulness factor, whereas for male students it was the self-confidence factor. The neuropsychological test performances of the participants who evaluate their own problem-solving skills negatively were lower. Findings suggest that participants whose problem-solving skills are incompatible with the age group need improvement in decision-making, action, part-whole relationship, visual motor speed, and resistance to confounders or distractors. It was concluded that students who evaluated themselves as better problem solvers in evaluative approach, self-confidence and planfulness dimensions performed better in visuospatial assessment. Architectural education raises issues and challenges which might be quite problematic for the first-year students. Students are expected to gain knowledge, skills, and competence in a new field. Design exercise itself is either undefined or ill-defined. Focusing mainly on the non-working, inconsistent, or missed opportunities instead of positive aspects of the design proposal initiates new challenges that the students must encounter. Students are expected to formulate and manage their problem-solving challenge, which is mostly supported with negative feedbacks and criticism. It is possible to claim that the academic performance of a person who is made to feel worthless by reinforcing their negative judgments about their own skills and competencies decreases. Creativity and innovation, critical thinking, problem solving, decision making, learning to learn, metacognitive awareness, communication and collaboration are the 21st century skills which are the key skills preparing the societies and individual to the future. The COVID-19 pandemic and the measures taken to combat the epidemic, especially emergency distance education, have reminded the vital importance of the skills mentioned above. The skills emerge and develop individually on the basis of personal resources and individual's social context. The idea that these skills can be improved by means of architectural design education is not a defensible claim within the scientific framework of learning and development. Studies in the areas of learning and development recommend the understanding, evaluation and appraisal of the student's own personal intellectual and cognitive resources. The design exercise proceeds through processes similar to solving real life problems. The studio environment can be defined as a social learning environment based on problem solving. How first year architecture students appraise their own problem-solving skills has not been studied sufficiently. The benefits of these research can be listed as follows: Students' individual differences can be revealed. Changes in their academic performance can be observed. Students' attitudes towards feedback can be explained. The relationship between students' attitudes towards their own skills and competencies and their academic performance can be observed and studies can be carried out to improve performance. The findings of these and similar studies show that individuals' metacognitive awareness, self-efficacy perceptions of their knowledge, skills and competencies and their self-control over them are the keys to intellectual and academic development.","Acar, A.; Soysal Acar, A.

Innovation in cash flow generation will take center stage to operate the business in these uncertain times. Forecasting demand for future flights is a challenge since historical demand patterns are not meaningful which requires a new adaptive robust revenue management approach that monitors key metrics, detects anomalies and quickly takes corrective action when performance targets cannot be achieved. Design/methodology/approach: The novel COVID-19 pandemic decimated the travel industry in 2020 and continues to plague us with no end in sight. With the steep drop in revenues, airlines need to adapt to a new marketing planning process of scheduling, pricing and revenue management that is more nimble to adapt quickly to changing market conditions. This new approach will continue to be relevant in a post-COVID-19 world during and after economic recovery. Findings: A methodology for airline revenue planning: scheduling, airline pricing and revenue management, has been proposed that will also work in a post-COVID-19 era. Research limitations/implications: The limitation of the proposed model is that it needs to be applied in practice to determine the true benefits of this novel approach to airline revenue planning. Practical implications: Flight scheduling will rely more on clean sheet scheduling, schedule revisions and close in refleeting to better match demand to supply.

Here, a RT-qPCR assays with High Resolution Melting (HRM-RTqPCR) was developed for different regions of the SARS-CoV-2 genome (RdRp, E and N) and an internal control (human RNAse P gene). The assays were validated using synthetic sequences from the viral genome and clinical specimens (nasopharyngeal swabs, serum and saliva) of sixty-five patients with severe or moderate COVID-19 from different states in Brazil, in comparison to a commercial TaqMan RT-qPCR assay, as gold standard. The sensitivity of the HRM-RTqPCR assays targeting N, RdRp and E were 94.12, 98.04 and 92.16%, with 100% specificity to the 3 targets, and diagnostic accuracy of 95.38, 98.46 and 93.85%, respectively. Thus, the HRM-RTqPCR emerges as an alternative and low-cost methodology to increase the molecular diagnostic of patients suspicious for Covid-19, especially in restricted-budget laboratories.","Ferreira, B.

Such a transition has been readily made by virtue of today's Internet technology and infrastructure, but online learning also has limitations compared to traditional face-to-face lectures. One of the biggest hurdles is that it is challenging for teachers to instantly keep track of students' learning status. In this paper, we envision earables as an opportunity to automatically estimate learner's understanding of learning material for effective learning and teaching, e.g., to pinpoint the part for which learners need to put more effort to understand. To this end, we conduct a small-scale exploratory study with 8 participants for 24 lectures in total and investigate learner's behavioral characteristics that indicate the level of understanding. We demonstrate that those behaviors can be captured from a motion signal on earables. We discuss challenges that need to be further addressed to realize our vision. © 2021 ACM.","Kim, D.; Min, C.; Kang, S.","2021 ACM International Joint Conference on Pervasive and Ubiquitous Computing and the 2021 ACM International Symposium on Wearable Computers, UbiComp/ISWC 2021",94,8

Face masks can also change how we communicate and subsequently affect speech signal quality. Here we investigated how three face mask types (N95, surgical and cloth) affect acoustic analysis of speech and perceived intelligibility in healthy subjects. We compared speech produced with and without the different masks on acoustic measures of timing, frequency, perturbation and power spectral density. Speech clarity was also examined using a standardized intelligibility tool by blinded raters. Mask type impacted the power distribution in frequencies above 3kHz for both the N95 and surgical masks. Measures of timing and spectral tilt also differed across mask conditions. Cepstral and harmonics to noise ratios remained flat across mask type. No differences were observed across conditions for word or sentence intelligibility measures. Our data show that face masks change the speech signal, but some specific acoustic features remain largely unaffected (e.g., measures of voice quality) irrespective of mask type. Outcomes have bearing on how future speech studies are run when personal protective equipment is worn.","Magee, Michelle; Lewis, Courtney; Noffs, Gustavo; Reece, Hannah; Chan, Jess C.

Consequently, physical activity and sedentary behavior may be negatively impacted as many fitness and recreational centers have been closed. This study aimed to examine the impact of the pandemic on physical activity and sedentary behavior in a sample of university students and employees before and after the university cancelled face-to-face classes and closed campus. Participants (N = 398) completed the validated Godin physical activity questionnaire and the International Physical Activity Questionnaire which assessed physical activity and sedentary behavior pre- and post-cancellation of face-to-face classes. Participants were also separated in the groups (low, moderate, high physical activity) based upon a tertile split of pre-pandemic total physical activity. Physical activity group by time ANOVAs were used to assess potential changes in total physical activity and sedentary behavior. Post-cancellation sedentary behavior was greater (F (1, 388) = 9.2, p = 0.003, partial η2 = 0.032) than pre-cancellation. Physical activity group moderated (F (2, 395) = 22.0, p < 0.001, partial η2 ≥ 0.10) changes in total physical activity from pre- to post cancellation. The high activity group decreased physical activity whereas the moderate and low activity groups increased physical activity (t ≥ 2.4, p ≤ 0.02, Cohen's d = 0.23). While the university closure increased sedentary behavior across the sample, it only decreased physical activity in participants who were the most active pre-cancellation. Pandemic-related closure of facilities designed for physical activity may disproportionately impact active individuals.","Barkley, Jacob E; Lepp, Andrew; Glickman, Ellen; Farnell, Greg; Beiting, Jake; Wiet, Ryan; Dowdell, Bryan",International journal of exercise science,94,17

One model for an equitable system of healthcare delivery may be the integration of General Internal Medicine as the core matrix, around which the various subspecialties deliver quality care. This is now a reality in many hospitals, where all subspecialists serve for varying periods in general medical wards, some even achieving dual accreditation. This promotes integration rather than fragmentation of services. Subspecialties will thrive, for the general workload will also be shared by internists in an equitable fashion. The obvious beneficiaries are the patients, and the health economics will also benefit the funding bodies. The services provided by internists must also be expanded into new fields, e.g. medicine for disasters, so as to promote cost-effective medical care, research and teaching, and also to achieve right-siting of patient care. It must also be emphasised that the specialties remain integral parts of the matrix, so that all departments complement one another, rather than compete with each other.

METHODS Twelve relevant manuscripts were sourced from a total of 7288 search results obtained using PubMed, Medline and Google Scholar. The search keywords used were COVID-19, nasopharyngeal, oropharyngeal, swabs, SARS and CoV2. Original manuscripts were obtained and analysed by all authors. The review included manuscripts which have not undergone rigorous peer-review process in view of the magnitude of the topic discussed. RESULTS The viral load of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the upper respiratory tract was significantly higher during the first week and peaked at 4-6 days after onset of symptoms, during which it can be potentially sampled. Nasopharyngeal swab has demonstrated higher viral load than oropharyngeal swab, where the difference in paired samples is best seen at 0-9 days after the onset of illness. Sensitivity of nasopharyngeal swab was higher than oropharyngeal swabs in COVID-19 patients. Patient self-collected throat washing has been shown to contain higher viral load than nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swab, with significantly higher sensitivity when compared with paired nasopharyngeal swab. RECOMMENDATIONS Routine nasopharyngeal swab of suspected COVID-19 infection should take anatomy of the nasal cavity into consideration to increase patient comfort and diagnostic yield. Routine oropharyngeal swab should be replaced by throat washing which has demonstrated better diagnostic accuracy, and it is safe towards others.","Mawaddah, A; Gendeh, H S; Lum, S G; Marina, M B",The Malaysian journal of pathology,94,24

Currently, the standard paradigm for HVAC (heating, ventilation and air conditioning) is based on central air systems that tie delivery of heating and cooling to delivery of fresh air. To prevent heat loss, the delivery of fresh air must be tightly controlled and often limited through recirculation of already heated air. Buildings are designed with air-tight envelopes, which do not allow for natural ventilation, and depend on energy-intensive central-air systems. As closed environments, buildings have become sites of rapid COVID-19 transmission. In this research, we demonstrate the energy cost of increasing outdoor air supply with standard systems per COVID-19 recommendations and introduce an alternative HVAC paradigm that maximizes the decoupling of ventilation and thermal control. We first consider a novel analysis of the energy costs of increasing the amount of conditioned fresh air using standard HVAC systems to address COVID-19 concerns. We then present an alternative that includes a novel membrane-assisted radiant system we have studied for cooling in humid climates, in place of an air conditioning system. The proposed system can work in conjunction with natural ventilation and thus decreases the risk of indoor spread of infectious diseases and significantly lowers energy consumption in buildings. Our results modeling HVAC energy in different climates show increased outdoor air in standard HVAC systems can double cooling costs, while increasing natural ventilation with radiant systems can halve HVAC costs. More specifically it is possible to add up to 100 days' worth of natural ventilation while saving energy, when coupling natural ventilation and radiant systems. This combination decreases energy cost by 10-45% in 60 major cities globally, while increasing fresh air intake.","Aviv, Dorit; Wee Chen, Kian; Teitelbaum, Eric; Sheppard, Denon; Pantelic, Jovan; Rysanek, Adam; Meggers, Forrest",Appl Energy,94,24

Machine learning studies that focus on COVID-19 have been limited to single-hospital data, which limits model generalizability. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to use federated learning, a machine learning technique that avoids locally aggregating raw clinical data across multiple institutions, to predict mortality in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 within 7 days. METHODS: Patient data were collected from the electronic health records of 5 hospitals within the Mount Sinai Health System. Logistic regression with L1 regularization/least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and multilayer perceptron (MLP) models were trained by using local data at each site. We developed a pooled model with combined data from all 5 sites, and a federated model that only shared parameters with a central aggregator. RESULTS: The LASSOfederated model outperformed the LASSOlocal model at 3 hospitals, and the MLPfederated model performed better than the MLPlocal model at all 5 hospitals, as determined by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve.

Methods: Retrospective review of electronic medical records of all patients presenting to the ophthalmology department from March 23, 2020, to July 15, 2020, was compared with that from March 23, 2019, to July 15, 2019. The data between March 23, 2020, to May 31, 2020 (lockdown) and June 06, 2020, to July 15, 2020 (unlock) was compared separately. Parameters evaluated were age, gender, presenting complaints, final diagnosis, treatment advised, and surgical interventions. Results: During the lockdown, routine outpatient flow reduced by 97.14% (P < 0.001), the median age of presentation decreased to 29 years (55 years last year) and males increased by 4.7% (from 61.51% to 66.21%) in 2020.

STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a multi-method study of survey and interview data. We performed 40 baseline interviews and surveys in spring 2019 and 36 follow-up surveys and ten interviews one year later. We compared pre- and post-Likert scale responses of provider views on the importance of different aspects of standard medication abortion assessment and evaluation (e.g., related to ultrasounds and blood-typing). We performed content analysis of the follow-up interviews using deductive-inductive analysis. RESULTS: Survey results revealed that clinics substantially changed their medication abortion protocols in response to COVID-19, with more than half increasing their gestational age limits and introducing telemedicine for follow-up of a medication abortion. Interview analysis suggested that physicians were more supportive of self-sourced medication abortion in response to changing clinic protocols that decreased in-clinic assessment and evaluation for medication abortion, and as a result of physicians' altered assessments of risk in the context of COVID-19. Having evidence already in place that supported these practice changes made the implementation of new protocols more efficient, while working in a state with restrictive abortion policies thwarted the flexibility of clinics to adapt to changes in standards of care. CONCLUSION: This exploratory study reveals that the COVID-19 pandemic has altered clinical assessment of risk and has shifted practice towards a less medicalized model. Further work to facilitate person-centered abortion information and care can build on initial modifications in response to the pandemic.","Karlin, Jennifer; Sarnaik, Shashi; Holt, Kelsey; Dehlendorf, Christine; Joffe, Carole; Steinauer, Jody",Contraception,94,1

The positive rate in the second quarter was highest (6.03%), which was higher than that in other quarters (1.89%-2.93%). There were significant differences among different age groups (&#967;(2)=16.94, P=0.001), and the positive rate decreased with age (&#967;(2)=10.16, P=0.001). The positive rate of 13-19 years old group (9.43%) was higher than that of other age groups (1.48%-4.81%). The positive rate of student group (12.07%) was higher than that of other occupations (2.61%). The difference was systematic (&#967;(2)=11.53, P=0.001). Mixed infection accounted for 31.11% (14/45) of 45 adenovirus positive cases. The mixed infection rates of ILI and SARI were 34.48% (10/29) and 25.00% (4/16), respectively. Among 14 cases of mixed infection, the main mixed infection pathogens of adenovirus were influenza A virus and coronavirus. Conclusion: Adenovirus surveillance should be further strengthened in adolescents with a focus on students and other key groups in the second quarter.","Kong, D C; Zheng, Y X; Jiang, C Y; Pan, H; Han, R B; Wu, H Y; Chen, J",Zhonghua Liu Xing Bing Xue Za Zhi,94,23

This paper investigates the role of social capital as a mediating factor for the spread of the virus. Because social capital is associated with greater trust and relationships within a community, it could endow individuals with a greater concern for others, thereby leading to more hygienic practices and social distancing. Using data for over 2,700 US counties, we investigate how social capital explains the level and growth rate of infections. We find that moving a county from the 25th to the 75th percentile of the distribution of social capital would lead to a 18% and 5.7% decline in the cumulative number of infections and deaths, as well as suggestive evidence of a lower spread of the virus. Our results are robust to many demographic characteristics, controls, and alternative measures of social capital.","Makridis, Christos A; Wu, Cary",PLoS One,94,26

There is a lack of knowledge regarding the disease, and liver involvement is controversial. Objectives: We aimed to analyze the laboratory investigations of COVID-19 patients focusing on liver enzymes and association with outcomes. Methods: We enrolled 93 patients with COVID-19 referring to the Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences’ hospitals and 186 people from the normal population of Tabari Cohort. The laboratory tests included CBC, Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST), Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT), Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP), direct bilirubin, and total bilirubin. The lengths of hospital stay, critical care transfers, and deaths were the outcome measures investigated with lab results. Results: The counts of lymphocytes (833.3 ± 564.4 vs. 2465.1 ± 796.6 per mm 3, P &lt; 0.001) and platelets (209.4 ± 62.7 vs. 255.2 ± 63.8 per mm 3, P &lt; 0.001) were significantly lower in patients than in controls. Also, AST (39.5 ± 34.9 vs. 19.9 ± 7.5 U/L, P &lt; 0.001), ALT (40.4 ± 46.5 vs. 21.6 ± 12.7 U/L, P &lt; 0.001), and ALP (192.6 ± 91.2 vs. 222.2 ± 70.6 U/L, P = 0.004) were higher in patients than in controls. The most common hepatic impairment events were increased direct bilirubin (45.8%), ALT (30.3%), AST (29.2%), ALP (17%), and total bilirubin (10.2%), in sequence. The risk of transfer to intensive and critical care units was strongly associated with elevated levels of AST and direct bilirubin, and AST = 30.5 (U/L) had a sensitivity of 71.4% and specificity of 68.5% for critical and intensive care transfer. The mortality rate significantly increased with increased AST levels (P = 0.023). Conclusions: Abnormal liver enzymes are frequent in COVID-19 patients. As AST is not specific for liver damage, the systemic inflammation induced by the virus might be responsible for these findings.","Omrani-Nava, Versa; Maleki, Iradj; Ahmadi, Abdolrahim; Moosazadeh, Mahmood; Hedayatizadeh-Omran, Akbar; Roozbeh, Fatemeh; Nahanghi, Hasan; Alizadeh-Navaei, Reza",Hepat.

Therefore, it is important to study how the mechanical properties of woven bone are dependent on its microarchitecture and especially on its porosity and mineral content. The porosity and the x-ray greyscale of specimens taken from bone transport studies in sheep were assessed by means of ex vivo imaging. Our study demonstrates that the porosity of the woven bone in the distraction area diminishes during the healing process from 73.3% 35 days after surgery to 31.9% 525 days after surgery. In addition, the woven bone's porosity is negatively correlated with its Young's modulus. The x-ray greyscale, was measured as an indicator of the level of mineralization of the woven bone. Greyscale index has been demonstrated to be inversely proportional to porosity and to increase to up to 60-80% of the level in cortical bone. The results of this study may contribute to the development of micromechanical models of woven bone and improvements in in silico modelling.","Mora-Macías, J; García-Florencio, P; Pajares, A; Miranda, P; Domínguez, J; Reina-Romo, E",Ann. biomed. eng,94,16

BACKGROUND: Internationally, there has been an increase in universities offering Graduate Entry Masters programs in Nursing. Such programs specify a bachelor degree as an entry requirement and then offer an intensive program of study that prepares graduates for registration as a nurse. To date, no formal standards exist to guide evaluation of these curricula. DESIGN: A two phased sequential mixed-methods design comprising thematic content analysis of curricula and a Delphi study. The setting was the Australian and New Zealand tertiary education sectors. Participants were nurse academics who were recruited to participate in the Delphi study. Quota sampling was used to identify educators from the education providers meeting organisational inclusion criteria (program coordinator and one lecturer working as a subject coordinator of the program) and nominated by their Head of Department. METHODS: Phase One of the study involved a thematic analysis of the curricula of nine Graduate Entry Master of Nursing programs to identify common elements of curricula and domains of quality. In Phase Two these themes were used in a series of Delphi rounds to identify a set of agreed quality domains, statements and indicators. RESULTS: Participants (n = 16) responded over three Delphi rounds. A total of nine domains of quality were determined, a set of 26 quality statements were identified based on the acceptance threshold of > 75% level of agreement and 27 quality indicators were established. CONCLUSIONS: Our research provides an agreed set of indicators for evaluating the quality of Graduate Entry Master of Nursing programs. This work will also make it possible to measure the immediate and longer-term impacts of Graduate Entry Master of Nursing programs for the nursing workforce. Future work must focus on testing feasibility and optimising utility while refining indicators across jurisdictions.","Gerdtz, Marie F; Seaton, Philippa; Jones, Virginia; Tomkins, Zerina; Stacey, Gemma; Brooks, Ingrid Ann; Kapp, Suzanne",Nurse Educ Pract,94,1

Statements about duration of therapeutic efficacy are based on persistence of serum buprenorphine levels over a minimum threshold, but behavioral data demonstrating sustained efficacy is not established. Additionally, chronic opioid exposure can induce tolerance and/or hyperalgesia; mice receiving sustained-release buprenorphine have not been evaluated for these effects. This study assessed clinical efficacy and duration of sustained-release buprenorphine in inflammatory, post-operative, and cancer pain; and screened for centrally-mediated opioid-induced hyperalgesia as well as opioid tolerance. At 1-2â¯mg/kg sustained-release buprenorphine, statistically significant analgesic efficacy occurred only at time points up to 2â¯h. These animals showed no changes in von Frey thresholds on the contralateral side, i.e. no centrally-mediated opioid hyperalgesia. To establish whether acute onset opioid tolerance resulted from a single sustained-release buprenorphine administration, we used the tail flick assay, exposing mice to sustained-release buprenorphine or saline on Day 1 and buprenorphine on Day 2. We measured duration and efficacy of 1â¯mg/kg buprenorphine after 1â¯mg/kg sustained-release buprenorphine, and also quantified a dose-response curve of buprenorphine (0.1-3â¯mg/kg) after 2â¯mg/kg sustained-release buprenorphine. Compared to control animals, mice previously exposed to sustained-release buprenorphine showed diminished analgesic response to buprenorphine; the resultant dose-response curve showed decreased efficacy. Pretreatment with naloxone, an opioid receptor antagonist, blocked sustained-release buprenorphine analgesic action. The short duration of antinociception following administration of sustained-release buprenorphine in mice is caused by the rapid development of tolerance.","Larson, Christina M; Peterson, Cristina D; Kitto, Kelley F; Wilcox, George L; Fairbanks, Carolyn A",Eur J Pharmacol,94,18

The aim of this manuscript is to update treatment protocols by reviewing recently published studies on the treatment of nosocomial pneumonia in the critically ill patients that require invasive respiratory support and patients with HAP from hospital wards that require invasive mechanical ventilation. An interdisciplinary group of experts, comprising specialists in anaesthesia and resuscitation and in intensive care medicine, updated the epidemiology and antimicrobial resistance and established clinical management priorities based on patients' risk factors. Implementation of rapid diagnostic microbiological techniques available and the new antibiotics recently added to the therapeutic arsenal has been reviewed and updated. After analysis of the categories outlined, some recommendations were suggested, and an algorithm to update empirical and targeted treatment in critically ill patients has also been designed.

A major obstacle has been capturing variations in the underlying kinetics of transmission resulting from changes in public policy, individual behaviors, and evolution of the virus. However, the availability of standardized forecasts and versioned data sets from this period allows for continued work in this area. Here we introduce the Gaussian Infection State Space with Time-dependence (GISST) forecasting model. We evaluate its performance in 1-4 week ahead forecasts of COVID-19 cases, hospital admissions, and deaths in the state of California made with official reports of COVID-19, Googles mobility reports, and vaccination data available each week from June 29, 2020 to April, 26, 2021. Evaluation of these forecasts with a weighted interval score shows them to consistently outperform a naive baseline forecast and often score closer to or better than a high-performing ensemble forecaster. The GISST model also provides parameter estimates for a compartmental model of COVID-19 dynamics, includes a regression submodel for the transmission rate, and allows for parameters to vary over time according to a random walk. GISST provides a novel, balanced combination of computational efficiency, model interpretability, and applicability to large multivariate data sets that may prove useful in improving the accuracy of infectious disease forecasts. Author summaryThe COVID-19 pandemic has been unprecedented both in the volume of related data made available and the volume of infectious disease forecasts generated. Improvements in forecasting methods can allow us to more fully identify regular patterns within the available data, which may provide further insight into the epidemiology of COVID-19. Improved forecasting algorithms would also be of value during any future outbreaks of similar pathogens, and to develop models useful for scenario planning. In this paper, we introduce a new forecasting model developed for forecasting cases, deaths, and hospital admissions at the state level in the United States. We use versioned data sets to apply this to the same forecasting tasks that models performed during the pandemic. We find that this new model performs well relative to a leading ensemble forecasting method. We also show that this model can be useful for understanding how COVID-19 cases, hospital admissions, and deaths are related to each other and human mobility and vaccine administration, and how these relationships changed over time.","O'Dea, Eamon B; Drake, John M",,94,22

Similarly, the order of nucleotides is not random (e.g., in the human genome, guanine follows cytosine at a frequency of ~0.0125, or a quarter the number of times predicted by random representation). Codon usage and codon order are also nonrandom. Furthermore, nucleotide and codon biases vary between species. Such biases have various drivers, including cellular proteins that recognize specific patterns in nucleic acids, that once triggered, induce mutations or invoke intrinsic or innate immune responses.

Whether the nature of the two groups is the same but in the spectrum of different diagnostic time points is not certain. METHODS: Hospitalized COVID-19 patients who needed oxygen therapy from February to November 2020 were included in the study. The patients were divided into early and late groups based on the time when the oxygen requirement occurred. Basic and epidemiologic characteristics were compared. Clinical variables were analyzed in both groups. RESULTS: A total of 164 patients needed oxygen therapy, 94 of whom were in the early group and 70 of whom were in the late group. The early and late groups had similar baseline characteristics except age (median age, 73 vs. 67 years), uncertain exposure history (50% vs. 31.4%) and the time from the onset of illness to admission (median, 5 vs. 2 days). Multivariate analysis showed that age > 65 years (OR, 4.65), symptom onset > 5 days (OR, 9.13) and several clinical manifestations, such as febrile sensation (OR, 6.01), dyspnea (OR, 30.0), C-reactive protein > 1 mg/dL (OR, 7.87) and chest X-ray abnormality (OR, 8.15), were predictive factors in the early group. The early group required more intensive care such as mechanical ventilation care, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and death (29.8% vs. 14.3%, P = 0.002). CONCLUSION: Older age, especially > 65 years, and a delay of over 5 days from the onset of illness to admission were associated with early oxygen demand in COVID-19 patients. Interventions for earlier diagnosis of elderly people may benefit clinical outcomes.","Suh, Hyeon Jeong; Lee, Eunyoung; Park, Sang Won",J Korean Med Sci,94,16

A soluble form of EPCR (sEPCR) circulates in plasma and inhibits activated protein C (APC) activities. The clinical impact of sEPCR and its involvement in COVID-19 has not been explored. In this study, we investigated whether sEPCR levels were related to COVID-19 patients' requirement for hospitalization. METHODS: Plasma sEPCR levels were measured on hospital admission in 84 COVID-19 patients, and in eleven (11) non-hospitalized SARS-CoV2-positive patients approximately 6âdays after reported manifestation of their symptoms. Multiple logistic regression analysis was performed to identify potential risk factors for hospitalization and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated to assess their value. RESULTS: In our cohort, hospitalized patients had considerably higher sEPCR levels upon admission compared to outpatients [107.5 (76.7-156.3) vs. 44.6 (12.1-84.4) ng/ml; pâ<â0.0001)]. The ROC curve using hospitalization as the classification variable and sEPCR levels as the prognostic variable generated an area under the curve (AUC) at 0.845 (95% CIâ=â0.710-0.981, pâ<â0.001). Additionally, we investigated the predictive value of sEPCR combined with BMI, age, or D-dimers. CONCLUSIONS: In our cohort, sEPCR levels in COVID-19 patients upon hospital admission appear considerably elevated compared to outpatients; this could lead to impaired APC activities and might contribute to the pro-coagulant phenotype reported in such patients. sEPCR measurement might be useful as a point-of-care test in SARS-CoV2 positive patients.","Vassiliou, Alice G; Keskinidou, Chrysi; Jahaj, Edison; Gallos, Parisis; Zacharis, Alexandros; Athanasiou, Nikolaos; Tsipilis, Stamatios; Mastora, Zafeiria; Dimopoulou, Ioanna; Kotanidou, Anastasia; Orfanos, Stylianos E",Shock (Augusta Ga.),94,1

This paper mainly anatomized the comprehensive characteristics and evolution trends of ozone pollution based on the lockdown period in the first half of 2020. Using the Hybrid Single Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model and cluster analysis method to establish backward trajectories and channels, the spatial transport process of ozone in the preset period and the causation of typical ozone pollution events were investigated in depth. The results demonstrated that: The ozone concentration pollution in the first half of 2020 was increased than last year. During the lockdown period, the basic pollutants levels were lower than that in pre-lockdown under different proportions, except O3 maximum 8-h moving average (MDA8) was increased by 69.7%, accompanied by the delay of daily peak value, increased pollution days and longer pollution cycle. The typical pollution events were highly consistent with the evolution path of fine aerosol compelled by extreme weather. The ozone concentration and the atmospheric oxidation capacity can be stably maintained at a low level when NO2 concentration remained at 50-70 µg/m3, no matter how much the AQI was. Meanwhile, ozone concentration in the downwind suburban was as low as the central city and soared in few stations amid post-lockdown, simultaneous the correlation between ozone and other pollutants converted from negative to positive. The trajectory indicated that the pollution sources during the lockdown and pre-lockdown were basically Southern Russia, Inner Mongolia, and the three provinces of Northeast China, the pollution from the Bohai Sea provoked ozone pollutants in Shenyang to rebound briskly amid post-lockdown, the pollution of neighboring countries and areas would have a stronger impact on air quality under the effect of lockdown.","Wang, Liyuan; Wang, Ju; Fang, Chunsheng",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),94,16

SARS-CoV-2-infected children were more likely to be Hispanic (p<0.0001), less likely to have asthma (p=0.005), and more likely to have an infected sibling contact (p=0.001) than uninfected children. Children ages 6-13 years were frequently asymptomatic (39%) and had respiratory symptoms less often than younger children (29% vs. 48%; p=0.01) or adolescents (29% vs. 60%; p<0.0001). Compared to children ages 6-13 years, adolescents more frequently reported influenza-like (61% vs. 39%; p<0.0001), gastrointestinal (27% vs. 9%; p=0.002), and sensory symptoms (42% vs. 9%; p<0.0001), and had more prolonged illnesses [median (IQR) duration: 7 (4, 12) vs. 4 (3, 8) days; p=0.01]. Despite the age-related variability in symptoms, we found no differences in nasopharyngeal viral load by age or between symptomatic and asymptomatic children. CONCLUSIONS: Hispanic ethnicity and an infected sibling close contact are associated with increased SARS-CoV-2 infection risk among children, while asthma is associated with decreased risk. Age-related differences in the clinical manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection must be considered when evaluating children for COVID-19 and in developing screening strategies for schools and childcare settings.","Hurst, Jillian H; Heston, Sarah M; Chambers, Hailey N; Cunningham, Hannah M; Price, Meghan J; Suarez, Lilianna; Crew, Carter G; Bose, Shree; Aquino, Jhoanna N; Carr, Stuart T; Griffin, S Michelle; Smith, Stephanie H; Jenkins, Kirsten; Pfeiffer, Trevor S; Rodriguez, Javier; DeMarco, C Todd; De Naeyer, Nicole A; Gurley, Thaddeus C; Louzao, Raul; Zhao, Congwen; Cunningham, Coleen K; Steinbach, William J; Denny, Thomas N; Lugo, Debra J; Moody, M Anthony; Permar, Sallie R; Rotta, Alexandre T; Turner, Nicholas A; Walter, Emmanuel B; Woods, Christopher W; Kelly, Matthew S",Clin. infect. dis,94,29

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate if obstructive diseases are risk factors for intensive care unit (ICU) stay and death due to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID19). METHODS: We collected data from the electronic medical record from 596 adult patients hospitalized in University Hospital of Liege between March 18 and April 17, 2020, for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) infection. We classified patients into 3 groups according to the underlying respiratory disease, present before the COVID19 pandemic. RESULTS: Among patients requiring hospitalization for COVID19, asthma and COPD accounted for 9.6% and 7.7%, respectively. The proportions of asthmatics, patients with COPD, and patients without obstructive airway disease hospitalized in the ICU were 17.5%, 19.6%, and 14%, respectively. One-third of patients with COPD died during hospitalization, whereas only 7.0% of asthmatics and 13.6% of patients without airway obstruction died due to SARS-CoV2. The multivariate analysis showed that asthma, COPD, inhaled corticosteroid treatment, and oral corticosteroid treatment were not independent risk factors for ICU admission or death. Male gender (odds ratio [OR]: 1.9; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.1-3.2) and obesity (OR: 8.5; 95% CI: 5.1-14.1) were predictors of ICU admission, whereas male gender (OR 1.9; 95% CI: 1.1-3.2), older age (OR: 1.9; 95% CI: 1.6-2.3), cardiopathy (OR: 1.8; 95% CI: 1.1-3.1), and immunosuppressive diseases (OR: 3.6; 95% CI: 1.5-8.4) were independent predictors of death.

METHODS: A comprehensive literature search of PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and Cochrane library was conducted for all eligible studies range from inception to February 29, 2020. Studies with control group were included. Treatment group received convalescent plasma therapy, and control group may receive any therapy other than convalescent plasma therapy. Odds ratios (ORs), mean differences (MDs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were pooled for categorical and continuous outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 1997 patients from 13 studies were included, and seven studies were prospectively designed. Pooled analysis indicated convalescent plasma treatment significantly reduced the mortality by 51% (OR=0.49, 95% CI: 0.36 to 0.67). Subgroup analyses by publication time, study design, and influenza A revealed similar results. Sensitivity analyses suggested that the results were stable. In addition, convalescent plasma therapy reduced mechanical ventilation requirement (OR: 0.35, 95% CI: 0.21 to 0.59), while it was not associated with less use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (OR: 2.0, 95% CI: 0.83 to 4.83) and shorter length of hospital stay (MD: -2.20, 95% CI: -4.98 to 0.57days). Pooled estimates showed there was no difference in serious adverse effects between the convalescent plasma treatment and control groups (OR: 0.75, 95% CI: 0.50 to 1.13). CONCLUSION: Convalescent plasma therapy significantly reduced the mortality and mechanical ventilation requirements of patients with virus-induced severe acute respiratory infections, without serious adverse effects.

Clinically meaningful data, such as overall survival (OS) and quality of life, are often only presented in subsequent publications. We examined if the clinical benefit of cancer drugs, as measured by the European Society for Medical Oncology Magnitude of Clinical Benefit Scale (ESMO-MCBS), improves post-European Medicines Agency (EMA) approval as more data emerges. METHODS: Cancer drug indications approved by the EMA from January 2006 to December 2016 were reviewed and trials cited for efficacy were identified. Primary and subsequent publications (up to December 2019) of scorable trials were included. Changes in benefit over time were measured using ESMO-MCBS thresholds for non-curative (&#8805;4 for substantial, =3 for intermediate and &#8804;2 for low benefit) and curative intent (A or B for major benefit) scoring. RESULTS: Fifty-five non-curative and two curative intent trials were included. At approval, 29.1% of non-curative trials were substantial, 45.5% intermediate and 25.5% low benefit. For curative intent trials, one displayed major benefit and one displayed no major benefit. We identified 82 subsequent publications for reassessment. A change in ESMO-MCBS classification was seen in 34.5% of non-curative trials (11 raised and 8 lowered). At 3-year reassessment, 36.4% of non-curative trials were substantial, 34.5% intermediate and 29.1% low benefit. Both curative trials showed no major benefit at reassessment. CONCLUSION: As over a third of trials changed classification, in either direction, reassessing the ESMO-MCBS score of approved cancer drugs may help to inform patients and ensure ongoing relevance of regulatory and reimbursement decisions.","Thomson, Sasha; Witzke, Noah; Gyawali, Bishal; Delos Santos, Seanthel; Udayakumar, Suji; Cardone, Claudia; Cheung, Matthew C; Chan, Kelvin K W",Eur J Cancer,94,24

Previously, we realized that caffeine is the ligand of type 2 taste receptors (TAS2Rs), which play a critical role in host defense. Here we gathered data on caffeine acting as an immunomodulator. Unexpectedly, we found that caffeine can fight WARS by acting on multiple organs, which may lead to prevent the virus from entering the cell, stimulate the phagocytosis of macrophages, enhance breathing, and inhibit the cytokine storm. Thus, the immunoprotective effects of caffeine can improve the therapeutic outcomes in patients infected with coronavirus. Collectively, we report that caffeine, an FDA-approved, highly safe, inexpensive, and widely available drug, could be an excellent HDT for battling WARS.","Liu, Lianyong; Zhang, Chaobao; Chen, Juan; Li, Xiangqi",Curr. med. chem,94,24

Moreover, in silico sequence analysis of azurin gene using globally reported sequences was intended. Materials and Methods: Fifty-nine multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa isolates were selected from different clinical specimens of patients suffering from burn wound infections in two university hospitals and subjected to antibacterial susceptibility testing. The frequency and genetic diversity of the azurin gene was determined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Sanger sequencing. The azurin gene sequences were compared with the sequence data from other countries. The expression level of azurin gene in P. aeruginosa isolates with different azurin sequences from different clinical specimens was evaluated by real-time PCR. Results and Conclusion: About 98%-100% of the isolates were resistant to gentamicin, tobramycin, cefoxitin, ciprofloxacin, amikacin, and imipenem, while 100% and 23.9% of the isolates were susceptible to colistin and ceftazidime, respectively. Only eight point mutations were detected with amino acid substitutions in only two positions (81 and 102). In global analysis, 93% of strains showed missense mutation at positions 81 (alanine to threonine). The majority (81%) of Iranian strains were allocated to two major clusters distinct from the rest of world, which may suggest that strains from Iran have made a distinct genetic stockpile through point mutations which has established them separate from the other counties. However, 19% were distributed in different clusters together with the strains from different countries of North and South America, Europe, South and East Asia. The expression level of the azurin gene was statistically higher in the isolates collected from the blood of burns patients with systemic infection compared to the isolates collected from other specimens (wound, catheter and tissue), which shows a positive correlation between azurin gene expression and increased pathogenicity and capability for dissemination. This study may open new insight about azurin genetic variation and significance in P. aeruginosa pathogenesis.","Mohammadi Barzelighi, Hajar; Bakhshi, Bita; Daraei, Bahram; Fazeli, Hossein; Nasr Esfahani, Bahram",Infect Drug Resist,94,1

Surfaces simulated are aluminum, copper, copper oxide, polyethylene (PE), and silicon dioxide (SiO2). Steered MD (SMD) simulations are also used to investigate the transfer of the virus from PE and SiO2 when a contaminated surface is touched. The virus shows the lowest and highest adhesions to PE and SiO2, respectively (20 vs 534 eV). Influence of temperature is not found to be noticeable. Using simulated water molecules to represent moisture on the skin, SMD simulations show that water molecules can lift the virus from the PE surface but damage the virus when lifting it from the the SiO2 surface.

Almost all hospitals have CT imaging machines; therefore, the chest CT images can be utilized for early classification of COVID-19 patients. However, the chest CT-based COVID-19 classification involves a radiology expert and considerable time, which is valuable when COVID-19 infection is growing at rapid rate. Therefore, an automated analysis of chest CT images is desirable to save the medical professionals' precious time. In this paper, a convolutional neural networks (CNN) is used to classify the COVID-19-infected patients as infected (+ve) or not (-ve). Additionally, the initial parameters of CNN are tuned using multi-objective differential evolution (MODE).

Reports suggest a beneficial effect of the use of heparin/low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) on mortality in COVID-19. In part, this beneficial effect could be explained by the anticoagulant properties of heparin/LMWH. Here, we summarise potential beneficial, non-anticoagulant mechanisms underlying treatment of COVID-19 patients with heparin/LMWH, which include: (i) Inhibition of heparanase activity, responsible for endothelial leakage; (ii) Neutralisation of chemokines, and cytokines; (iii) Interference with leukocyte trafficking; (iv) Reducing viral cellular entry, and (v) Neutralisation of extracellular cytotoxic histones. Considering the multiple inflammatory and pathogenic mechanisms targeted by heparin/LMWH, it is warranted to conduct clinical studies that evaluate therapeutic doses of heparin/LMWH in COVID-19 patients. In addition, identification of specific heparin-derived sequences that are functional in targeting non-anticoagulant mechanisms may have even higher therapeutic potential for COVID-19 patients, and patients suffering from other inflammatory diseases.","Buijsers, Baranca; Yanginlar, Cansu; Maciej-Hulme, Marissa L; de Mast, Quirijn; van der Vlag, Johan",EBioMedicine,94,16

Meanwhile, myocardial infarction is and will probably remain the foremost cause of death in the Western world throughout the coming decades. Severe deregulation of the immune system can unnecessarily expand the inflammatory response and participate in target and multiple organ failure, in infection but also in critical illness. Indeed, the course and fate of inflammatory cells observed in severe ST-elevation myocardial infarction (neutrophilia, monocytosis, and lymphopenia) almost perfectly mirror those recently reported in severe coronavirus disease 2019. A pleiotropic proinflammatory imbalance hampers adaptive immunity in favor of uncontrolled innate immunity and is associated with poorer structural and clinical outcomes. The goal of the present review is to gain greater insight into the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying this canonical activation and downregulation of the two arms of the immune response in both entities, to better understand their pathophysiology and to open the door to innovative therapeutic options.

While these measures are imperative to abate the spreading of COVID-19, the impact of these restrictions on health behaviours and lifestyles at home is undefined. Therefore, an international online survey was launched in April 2020, in seven languages, to elucidate the behavioural and lifestyle consequences of COVID-19 restrictions. This report presents the results from the first thousand responders on physical activity (PA) and nutrition behaviours. METHODS: Following a structured review of the literature, the ""Effects of home Confinement on multiple Lifestyle Behaviours during the COVID-19 outbreak (ECLB-COVID19)"" Electronic survey was designed by a steering group of multidisciplinary scientists and academics. The survey was uploaded and shared on the Google online survey platform. Thirty-five research organisations from Europe, North-Africa, Western Asia and the Americas promoted the survey in English, German, French, Arabic, Spanish, Portuguese and Slovenian languages. Questions were presented in a differential format, with questions related to responses ""before"" and ""during"" confinement conditions. RESULTS: 1047 replies (54% women) from Asia (36%), Africa (40%), Europe (21%) and other (3%) were included in the analysis. The COVID-19 home confinement had a negative effect on all PA intensity levels (vigorous, moderate, walking and overall). Additionally, daily sitting time increased from 5 to 8 h per day. Food consumption and meal patterns (the type of food, eating out of control, snacks between meals, number of main meals) were more unhealthy during confinement, with only alcohol binge drinking decreasing significantly. CONCLUSION: While isolation is a necessary measure to protect public health, results indicate that it alters physical activity and eating behaviours in a health compromising direction. A more detailed analysis of survey data will allow for a segregation of these responses in different age groups, countries and other subgroups, which will help develop interventions to mitigate the negative lifestyle behaviours that have manifested during the COVID-19 confinement.","Ammar, Achraf; Brach, Michael; Trabelsi, Khaled; Chtourou, Hamdi; Boukhris, Omar; Masmoudi, Liwa; Bouaziz, Bassem; Bentlage, Ellen; How, Daniella; Ahmed, Mona; Müller, Patrick; Müller, Notger; Aloui, Asma; Hammouda, Omar; Paineiras-Domingos, Laisa Liane; Braakman-Jansen, Annemarie; Wrede, Christian; Bastoni, Sofia; Pernambuco, Carlos Soares; Mataruna, Leonardo; Taheri, Morteza; Irandoust, Khadijeh; Khacharem, Aïmen; Bragazzi, Nicola L; Chamari, Karim; Glenn, Jordan M; Bott, Nicholas T; Gargouri, Faiez; Chaari, Lotfi; Batatia, Hadj; Ali, Gamal Mohamed; Abdelkarim, Osama; Jarraya, Mohamed; Abed, Kais El; Souissi, Nizar; Van Gemert-Pijnen, Lisette; Riemann, Bryan L; Riemann, Laurel; Moalla, Wassim; Gómez-Raja, Jonathan; Epstein, Monique; Sanderman, Robbert; Schulz, Sebastian Vw; Jerg, Achim; Al-Horani, Ramzi; Mansi, Taiysir; Jmail, Mohamed; Barbosa, Fernando; Ferreira-Santos, Fernando; Simunic, Bostjan",Nutrients,94,20

However, unsuitable sample types and laboratory detection kits/methods lead to misdiagnosis, which delays the prevention and control of the pandemic. Methods: We compared four nucleic acid detection methods [two kinds of reverse transcription polymerase chain reactions (RT-PCR A: ORF1ab and N testing; RT-PCRB: only ORF1ab testing), reverse transcription recombinase aided amplification (RT-RAA) and droplet digital RT-PCR (dd-RT-PCR)] using 404 samples of 72 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, including oropharyngeal swab (OPS), nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) and saliva after deep cough, to evaluate the best sample type and method for SARS-CoV-2 detection. Results: Among the four methods, dd-RT-PCR exhibited the highest positivity rate (93.0%), followed by RT-PCR B (91.2%) and RT-RAA (91.2%), while the positivity rate of RT-PCR A was only 71.9%. The viral load in OPS [24.90 copies/test (IQR 15.58-129.85)] was significantly lower than that in saliva [292.30 copies/test (IQR 20.20-8628.55)] and NPS [274.40 copies/test (IQR 33.10-2836.45)]. In addition, if OPS samples were tested alone by RT-PCR A, only 21.4% of the COVID-19 patients would be considered positive. The accuracy of all methods reached nearly 100% when saliva and NPS samples from the same patient were tested simultaneously. Conclusions: SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection methods should be fully evaluated before use. High-positivity rate methods such as RT-RAA and dd-RT-PCR should be considered when possible. Furthermore, saliva after deep cough and NPS can greatly improve the accuracy of the diagnosis, and testing OPS alone is not recommended.","Yu, Fei; Xie, Guoliang; Zheng, Shufa; Han, Dongsheng; Bao, Jiaqi; Zhang, Dan; Feng, Baihuan; Wang, Qi; Zou, Qianda; Wang, Ruonan; Yang, Xianzhi; Chen, Weizhen; Lou, Bin; Chen, Yu",Front Cell Infect Microbiol,94,33

There is a need to identify key pathogenic molecules in COVID-19-associated inflammation attainable to target with existing therapeutic compounds. The endogenous damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) molecule HMGB1 initiates inflammation via two separate pathways. Disulfide-HMGB1 triggers TLR4 receptors generating pro-inflammatory cytokine release. Extracellular HMGB1, released from dying cells or secreted by activated innate immunity cells, forms complexes with extracellular DNA, RNA and other DAMP or pathogen-associated molecular (DAMP) molecules released after lytic cell death. These complexes are endocytosed via RAGE, constitutively expressed at high levels in the lungs only, and transported to the endolysosomal system, which is disrupted by HMGB1 at high concentrations. Danger molecules thus get access to cytosolic proinflammatory receptors instigating inflammasome activation. It is conceivable that extracellular SARS-CoV-2 RNA may reach the cellular cytosol via HMGB1-assisted transfer combined with lysosome leakage. Extracellular HMGB1 generally exists in vivo bound to other molecules, including PAMPs and DAMPs. It is plausible that these complexes are specifically removed in the lungs revealed by a 40% reduction of HMGB1 plasma levels in arterial versus venous blood. Abundant pulmonary RAGE expression enables endocytosis of danger molecules to be destroyed in the lysosomes at physiological HMGB1 levels, but causing detrimental inflammasome activation at high levels.

Several models have been proposed to explain the regularity of yearly recurring outbreaks and the phase-differences observed at different latitudes on Earth. Such models take into account known internal causes, primarily the periodic emergence of new virus variants that evade the host immune response. Yet, this alone, is generally unable to explain the regularity of recurrences and the observed phase-differences. Here we show that seasonality of viral respiratory diseases, as well as its distribution with latitude on Earth, can be fully explained by the virucidal properties of UV-B and A Solar photons through a daily, minute-scale, resonant forcing mechanism. Such an induced periodicity can last, virtually unperturbed, from tens to hundreds of cycles, and even in presence of internal dynamics (host's loss of immunity) much slower than seasonal will, on a long period, generate seasonal oscillations.","Nicastro, F.; Sironi, G.; Antonello, E.; Bianco, A.; Biasin, M.; Brucato, J.

To create a tool to rapidly determine where pandemic demand for critical care overwhelms county-level surge capacity and to compare public health and medical responses.Methods. In March 2020, COVID-19 cases requiring critical care were estimated using an adaptive metapopulation SEIR (susceptibleâexposedâinfectiousârecovered) model for all 3142 US counties for future 21-day and 42-day periods from April 2, 2020, to May 13, 2020, in 4 reactive patterns of contact reduction-0%, 20%, 30%, and 40%-and 4 surge response scenarios-very low, low, medium, and high.Results. In areas with increased demand, surge response measures could avert 104 120 additional deaths-55% through high clearance of critical care beds and 45% through measures such as greater ventilator access. The percentages of lives saved from high levels of contact reduction were 1.9 to 4.2 times greater than high levels of hospital surge response. Differences in projected versus actual COVID-19 demands were reasonably small over time.Conclusions. Nonpharmaceutical public health interventions had greater impact in minimizing preventable deaths during the pandemic than did hospital critical care surge response.

By August 18, 2020, the United States, Brazil, and India were the most affected countries. Health infrastructure and socioeconomic vulnerabilities may be affecting the response capacities of these countries. We compared official indicators to identify which vulnerabilities better determined the exposure risk to COVID-19 in both the most and least affected countries. To achieve this purpose, we collected indicators from the Infectious Disease Vulnerability Index (IDVI), the World Health Organization (WHO), the World Bank, and the Brazilian Geography and Statistics Institute (IBGE). All indicators were normalized to facilitate comparisons. Speed, incidence, and population were used to identify the groups of countries with the highest and lowest risks of infection. Countries' response capacities were determined based on socioeconomic, political, and health infrastructure conditions. Vulnerabilities were identified based on the indicator sensitivity. The highest-risk group included the U.S., Brazil, and India, whereas the lowest-risk group (with the largest population by continent) consisted of China, New Zealand, and Germany. The high-sensitivity cluster had 18 indicators (50% extra IDVI), such as merchandise trade, immunization, public services, maternal mortality, life expectancy at birth, hospital beds, GINI index, adolescent fertility, governance, political stability, transparency/corruption, industry, and water supply. The greatest vulnerability of the highest-risk group was related first to economic factors (merchandise trade), followed by public health (immunization), highlighting global dependence on Chinese trade, such as protective materials, equipment, and diagnostic tests. However, domestic political factors had more indicators, beginning with high sensitivity and followed by healthcare and economic conditions, which signified a lesser capacity to guide, coordinate, and supply the population with protective measures, such as social distancing.","Cartaxo, Adriana Nascimento Santos; Barbosa, Francisco Iran Cartaxo; de Souza Bermejo, Paulo Henrique; Moreira, Marina Figueiredo; Prata, David Nadler",PLoS One,94,1

There is weak evidence on the antiviral and immunomodulating effects of azithromycin, which in addition is not based on results from COVID-19 patients specifically. Therefore, this antibacterial should be considered only as empirical treatment of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), although not all current treatment guidelines are in agreement. After the initial expectations raised by a small trial, more recent evidence has raised serious safety concerns on the use of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine with azithromycin to treat COVID-19 patients, as all these drugs have arrhythmogenic potential. The World Health Organization has not made recommendations suggesting the use of azithromycin with hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine as treatment for COVID-19, but some national organisations have taken a different position, recommending this as first-line treatment.

We elaborated ultrasonic method of triazavirin aerosol generation and investigated the inhalation delivery of this drug in mice. Mean particle size and number concentration of aerosol used in inhalation experiments are 560 nm and 4×105 cm-3, respectively. Aerosol mass concentration is 1.6×10-4 mg/cm3. Inhalation for 20 min in a nose-only chamber resulted in 2 mg/kg body delivered dose and 2.6 µg/ml triazavirin concentration in blood plasma. Elimination rate constant determined in aerosol administration experiments was ke = 0.077 min-1, which agrees with the value measured after intravenous delivery, but per-oral administration resulted in considerably lower apparent elimination rate constant of pseudo-first order, probably due to non-linear dependence of absorption rate on triazavirin concentration in gastrointestinal tract.

Patients on dialysis may be exposed to greater risk of infection due to an inability to isolate. Consideration of these competing risks is important before restarting suspended transplant programs. This study compared outcomes in kidney and kidney/pancreas transplant recipients with those on the waiting list, following admission with COVID-19 in a high prevalence region. METHODS: Audit data from all 6 London transplant centres were amalgamated. Demographic and laboratory data were collected and outcomes included mortality, intensive care (ITU) admission and ventilation. Adult patients who had undergone a kidney or kidney/pancreas transplant, and those active on the transplant waiting list at the start of the pandemic were included. RESULTS: 121 transplant recipients (TR) and 52 waiting list patients (WL) were admitted to hospital with COVID-19. 36 TR died (30%), whilst 14 WL patients died (27% p=0.71). There was no difference in rates of admission to ITU or ventilation. 24% of TR required renal replacement therapy, and 12% lost their grafts. Lymphocyte nadir and D-dimer peak showed no difference in those who did and did not die. No other co-morbidities or demographic factors were associated with mortality, except for age (odds ratio of 4.3 [95% CI 1.8 - 10.2] for mortality if aged over 60 years) in TR.

Overall, 98.2% (n=10,013) of participants paid high or very high attention to the epidemic, with WeChat being their main information source (n=9400, 92.2%). Over half the participants (n=5878, 57.7%) were confident that the epidemic could be curbed in China; 92.4% (n=9427) opened windows for ventilation more frequently than usual; 97.9% (n=9986) used masks in public; 95.7% (n=9759) avoided large crowds and stayed at home as much as possible; and 97.9% (n=9988) washed their hands more often than usual. Women were more likely to practice these behaviors than men (P<.001). With a series of strict public control measures, like nationwide health education campaigns, holiday extensions, the Examine and Approve Policy on the resumption of work, close management of working and living quarters, a health QR (Quick Response) code system, community screening, and social distancing policies, the number of new cases have decreased dramatically since February 12, 2020. CONCLUSIONS: The methods employed by Chinese citizens and authorities have effectively curtailed the spread of COVID-19, demonstrating that this pandemic can be brought under control as long as the right measures are taken.","Huang, Yu; Wu, Qingqing; Wang, Ping; Xu, Yan; Wang, Lei; Zhao, Yusui; Yao, Dingming; Xu, Yue; Lv, Qiaohong; Xu, Shuiyang",J Med Internet Res,94,21

The symptomatology of COVID-19 is heterogeneous with a severity continuum. Many symptoms are related to pathological changes in the vocal system, leading to the assumption that COVID-19 may also affect voice production. For the first time, the present study investigates voice acoustic correlates of a COVID-19 infection based on a comprehensive acoustic parameter set. We compare 88 acoustic features extracted from recordings of the vowels /i:/, /e:/, /u:/, /o:/, and /a:/ produced by 11 symptomatic COVID-19 positive and 11 COVID-19 negative German-speaking participants. We employ the Mann-Whitney U test and calculate effect sizes to identify features with prominent group differences. The mean voiced segment length and the number of voiced segments per second yield the most important differences across all vowels indicating discontinuities in the pulmonic airstream during phonation in COVID-19 positive participants. Group differences in front vowels are additionally reflected in fundamental frequency variation and the harmonics-to-noise ratio, group differences in back vowels in statistics of the Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients and the spectral slope. Our findings represent an important proof-of-concept contribution for a potential voice-based identification of individuals infected with COVID-19.","Bartl-Pokorny, Katrin D; Pokorny, Florian B; Batliner, Anton; Amiriparian, Shahin; Semertzidou, Anastasia; Eyben, Florian; Kramer, Elena; Schmidt, Florian; Schönweiler, Rainer; Wehler, Markus; Schuller, Björn W",J Acoust Soc Am,94,1

We present the use of phage display to select anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike antibodies from the human naïve antibody gene libraries HAL9/10 and subsequent identification of 309 unique fully human antibodies against S1. 17 antibodies are binding to the RBD, showing inhibition of spike binding to cells expressing ACE2 as scFv-Fc and neutralize active SARS-CoV-2 virus infection of VeroE6 cells. The antibody STE73-2E9 is showing neutralization of active SARS-CoV-2 as IgG and is binding to the ACE2-RBD interface. Thus, universal libraries from healthy human donors offer the advantage that antibodies can be generated quickly and independent from the availability of material from recovering patients in a pandemic situation.","Bertoglio, Federico; Meier, Doris; Langreder, Nora; Steinke, Stephan; Rand, Ulfert; Simonelli, Luca; Heine, Philip Alexander; Ballmann, Rico; Schneider, Kai-Thomas; Roth, Kristian Daniel Ralph; Ruschig, Maximilian; Riese, Peggy; Eschke, Kathrin; Kim, Yeonsu; Schäckermann, Dorina; Pedotti, Mattia; Kuhn, Philipp; Zock-Emmenthal, Susanne; Wöhrle, Johannes; Kilb, Normann; Herz, Tobias; Becker, Marlies; Grasshoff, Martina; Wenzel, Esther Veronika; Russo, Giulio; Kröger, Andrea; Brunotte, Linda; Ludwig, Stephan; Fühner, Viola; Krämer, Stefan Daniel; Dübel, Stefan; Varani, Luca; Roth, Günter; Cicin-Sain, Luka; Schubert, Maren; Hust, Michael",Nat Commun,94,16

Data for the research model were collected from 980 in-service teachers during the COVID-19 outbreak between April and May 2020. Overall, the structural model explained 70% of the variance in teachers' CI. Motivational practices were directly and indirectly linked through OS with CI. The findings showed that IM has the most directly significant effect on teachers' CI, followed by TPK-SE, and OS as significant, but lower predictors. IM was positively associated with TPK-SE and negatively associated with EM. The results offered valuable insights into how motivation constructs were related to OS and to a better understanding online instruction in an unstable work context, in order to support teachers in coping during working remotely.","Panisoara, Ion Ovidiu; Lazar, Iulia; Panisoara, Georgeta; Chirca, Ruxandra; Ursu, Anca Simona",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),94,15

Longitudinal survey data about students' stress levels and self-efficacy in self-regulation were collected before and after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic at a public university (N = 274). Regression analysis results show an overall increase in study-related stress levels after the onset of the pandemic. Students with self-efficacy in self-regulation reported lower stress increases; students with higher mental health impairment and limited time for coursework reported larger stress increases. To address students' stress levels and strengthen coping resources, universities should consider providing students with resources to improve their self-regulation and time-management skills.","von Keyserlingk, Luise; Yamaguchi-Pedroza, Katsumi; Arum, Richard; Eccles, Jacquelynne S",,94,16

METHODS: Two months before the first case of the COVID-19 in Serbia, we obtained the Serbian Version of Quality of Life Inventory for Epilepsy 31 (SVQOLIE-31) and Neurological Disorders Depression Inventory for Epilepsy scores (SVNDDI-E) for another study. We retested the same patients one year after in COVID-19 pandemic. In addition to SVQOLIE-31, and SVNDDI-E we used a generic questionnaire compiled from items related to the COVID-19. RESULTS: We retested 97 out of 118 patients (82.2%) for the follow-up analysis. The average age was 36.1â¯±â¯12.2 (range: 18-69), and 49 were women (50.5%). The median duration of epilepsy was 13â¯years (range: 1.5-48). The structural etiology of epilepsy was noted in 41 (42.3%), unknown etiology in 41 (42.3%), and genetic etiology in 15 (15.4%) patients. Fewer patients (27.8%) experienced at least one seizure three months before follow-up testing when compared to patients who experienced at least one seizure three months in initial testing (36.0%) (pâ¯=â¯0.15). All patients reported full compliance with anti-seizure medication in the follow-up. The SVQOLIE-31 score during the COVID-19 pandemic visit (64.5â¯±â¯14.6) was significantly lower than the SVQOLIE-31 score before the pandemic (pâ¯<â¯0.001). The SVNDDI-E score during the COVID-19 pandemic (10.5â¯±â¯3.5) was significantly higher than the SVNDDI-E score before it (pâ¯<â¯0.001). Multiple linear regression analyses revealed fear of seizures, and fear of a reduction in household income, significantly associated with SVQOLIE-31 and SVNDDI-E overall score. These variables accounted for 66% and 27% of the variance of SVQOLIE-31 and SVNDDI-E overall score. SIGNIFICANCE: Lower quality of life, higher prevalence of depression, healthcare availability issues, and perceived fears during pandemic all suggest COVID-19 has negatively impacted lives of patients with epilepsy.","Strizovic, Selena; Vojvodic, Nikola; Kovacevic, Masa; Pejovic, Aleksa; Bukumiric, Zoran; Sokic, Dragoslav; Ristic, Aleksandar J",Epilepsy Behav,94,10

This study aimed to examine the sleep quality of frontline healthcare workers (FLHCW) in Bahrain during the COVID-19 pandemic, and compare it with the sleep quality of non-frontline healthcare workers (NFLHCW). METHODS: Healthcare workers (n = 280) from multiple facilities belonging to the Ministry of Health, Bahrain, were invited to participate in this cross-sectional study. An online questionnaire, including socio-demographics, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), was used to evaluate sleep disturbances and stress levels of healthcare workers. Poor sleep quality was defined as PSQI &#8805; 5 and moderate-severe stress as PSS &#8805; 14. Descriptive statistics were used to compare the scores of FLHCW and NFLHCW. Univariate and multivariate binary logistic regressions were used to identify predictors of poor sleep quality, moderate-severe stress, and the combined problem of poor sleep quality and moderate-severe stress. RESULTS: A total of 257 participants (129 FLHCW and 128 NFLHCW) provided usable responses. The overall PSQI and PSS scores were 7.0 ± 3.3 and 20.2 ± 7.1, respectively. The FLHCW scored higher in the PSQI and PSS compared with the NFLHCW; however, the differences in the PSQI and PSS scores were not statistically significant.

These modules could also be offered across locations. For students of human medicine, an elective for the acquisition of data literacy has been implemented. Originally designed as a blended learning offer, the elective was then carried out completely online due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Despite the lack of classroom teaching, the aim was to achieve intensive cooperation between the students. Project description: In the elective, the students worked on a total of 14 learning tasks, so-called e-tivities, which stimulate collaborative work and thus promote the examination of the learning content. These asynchronous learning activities were supplemented by video conferences, in which the students also took on the role of presenters. The teachers accompanied this learning process as e-moderators. Results: In April/May 2020, the elective course was carried out with 12 students entirely online. Despite a workload that was experienced as high, the elective was rated very well by the students. Discussion: The didactic concept of the elective enabled an active engagement with the learning material and the social interaction between the learners. With the digital learning offers, the learners were able to gain new experiences which are also of professional relevance. Conclusion: The didactic concept of the elective can be transferred to other courses.

Here, we propose an innovative in situ modification strategy for constructing ultrapure BiVO4 nanosheets on graphene (u-BVG) toward the accelerated photocatalytic water oxidation reaction. Considering the Mott-Schottky heterojunctions at the contact interface in u-BVG, the feasible electron transfer from excited BiVO4 to graphene facilitates the holes to migrate onto the BiVO4 surface for the water oxidation reaction. Compared with the conventional synthesis strategies, our strategy avoids the introduction of Cl impurities. This modification allows for not only a ca. 0.1 eV deeper valence band edge position to generate holes with a stronger oxidation potential but the extraction of the impurity level to suppress the carrier recombination. And density functional theory calculations are in accordance with the above results. Impressively, these merits endow the u-BVG with ca. 16.8 times growth in the amount of ËOH radicals derived from OH-/H2O oxidation, an over 260% enhancement in O2 yield and a 1.6-fold increase in the apparent quantum efficiency relative to the impure counterpart.

Endogenous NO produced by nitric oxide synthases regulates multiple signaling cascades, including activation of soluble guanylate cyclase to generate cGMP, relaxing smooth muscle cells. Inhaled NO is an established therapy for pulmonary hypertension in neonates, and has been recently proposed for treatment of hypoxic respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome due to COVID-19. In this review, we summarize the effects of endogenous and exogenous NO on protein S-nitrosylation, which is the selective and reversible covalent attachment of a nitrogen monoxide group to the thiol side chain of cysteine. This post-translational modification targets specific cysteines based on the acid/base sequence of surrounding residues, with significant impacts on protein interactions and function. S-nitrosothiol (SNO) formation is tightly compartmentalized and enzymatically controlled, but also propagated by non-enzymatic transnitrosylation of downstream protein targets. Redox-based nitrosylation and denitrosylation pathways dynamically regulate the equilibrium of SNO-proteins. We review the physiological roles of SNO proteins, including nitrosohemoglobin and autoregulation of blood flow through hypoxic vasodilation, and pathological effects of nitrosylation including inhibition of critical vasodilator enzymes; and discuss the intersection of NO source and dose with redox environment, in determining the effects of protein nitrosylation.

Protein expression of Trx system family members has been assessed in various cancers and linked to various clinicopathological variables, disease progression, treatment response and survival outcomes but information is lacking in brain tumours. Expression of the system was therefore examined, by immunohistochemistry in different brain tumour types, adult and paediatric cases, to determine if expression was of importance to clinical outcome. Trx system proteins were expressed, to variable levels, across all brain tumour types with significant variations in expression between different tumour types/grades/regions. High Trx reductase (TrxR) expression was linked to worse prognosis across all cohorts. High cytoplasmic TrxR expression was significantly associated with adverse overall survival (OS) in adult glioblastoma (P = 0.027) and paediatric low-grade glioma (LGG) patients (P = 0.012). High expression of nuclear TrxR, cytoplasmic and nuclear Trx and Trx-interacting protein (TxNIP) was associated with improved OS in paediatric LGGs (P = 0.031, P < 0.001, P = 0.044 and P = 0.018, respectively). For patients with high-grade gliomas, both high cytoplasmic TrxR and Trx expression were associated with poor OS (P = 0.002 and P = 0.007, respectively). In medulloblastoma, high expression of cytoplasmic TrxR and Trx and nuclear Trx was associated with worse prognosis (P = 0.013, P = 0.033 and P = 0.007, respectively); with cytoplasmic TrxR and nuclear Trx remaining so in multivariate analysis (P = 0.009 and P = 0.013, respectively). The consistent finding that high levels of cytoplasmic TrxR are associated with a worse prognosis across all cohorts suggests that TrxR is an important therapeutic target in brain cancers.","Yao, Anqi; Storr, Sarah J; Al-Hadyan, Khaled; Rahman, Ruman; Smith, Stuart; Grundy, Richard; Paine, Simon; Martin, Stewart G",Mol.

OBJECTIVE: This study focused on how sleep characteristics in the United States may be different from before to during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: To this end, the sleep characteristics of a nationally representative sample of U.S. adults collected before the COVID-19 outbreak (i.e., 2018 National Health Interview Survey, n = 19,433) were compared to the sleep characteristics of a nationally representative sample of U.S. adults recruited via Luc.id, an online survey sampling company, during the COVID-19 outbreak (i.e., 2020 Luc.id, n = 2059). RESULTS: While average sleep duration did not change between 2018 and 2020, the prevalence of both shorter and longer than recommended sleep duration were greater in 2020. Moreover, the number of days with difficulty falling asleep, difficulty staying asleep, and not feeling rested was greater in 2020 than 2018. Adults younger than 60 had larger differences than those 60 or older. CONCLUSIONS: Sleep health in U.S. adults was worse in 2020 than in 2018, particularly in adults younger than 60. Findings highlight sleep as target in future research and interventions seeking to understand and reduce the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Hisler, Garrett C; Twenge, Jean M",Soc Sci Med,94,15

Due to the outbreak of COVID-19 worldwide, using the computed-aided diagnosis technique for COVID-19 classification based on CT images could largely alleviate the burden of clinicians. In this paper, we propose an Adaptive Feature Selection guided Deep Forest (AFS-DF) for COVID-19 classification based on chest CT images. Specifically, we first extract location-specific features from CT images. Then, in order to capture the high-level representation of these features with the relatively small-scale data, we leverage a deep forest model to learn high-level representation of the features. Moreover, we propose a feature selection method based on the trained deep forest model to reduce the redundancy of features, where the feature selection could be adaptively incorporated with the COVID-19 classification model. We evaluated our proposed AFS-DF on COVID-19 dataset with 1495 patients of COVID-19 and 1027 patients of community acquired pneumonia (CAP). The accuracy (ACC), sensitivity (SEN), specificity (SPE) and AUC achieved by our method are 91.79%, 93.05%, 89.95% and 96.35%, respectively. Experimental results on the COVID-19 dataset suggest that the proposed AFS-DF achieves superior performance in COVID-19 vs. CAP classification, compared with 4 widely used machine learning methods.","Sun, Liang; Mo, Zhanhao; Yan, Fuhua; Xia, Liming; Shan, Fei; Ding, Zhongxiang; Shao, Wei; Shi, Feng; Yuan, Huan; Jiang, Huiting; Wu, Dijia; Wei, Ying; Gao, Yaozong; Gao, Wanchun; Sui, He; Zhang, Daoqiang; Shen, Dinggang",,94,9

Global and regional (Asian, North American and European) mean surface temperatures (MSTs) were significantly warmer than baseline for 5 years. This was followed by cooler‐than‐baseline MSTs lasting for about two decades until the end of the simulation. Emission reduction of only carbon dioxide (CO2) resulted in multi‐decadal cooler‐than‐baseline MSTs. Emission reduction of aerosols and aerosol precursors resulted in strong short‐term warmer‐than‐baseline MSTs for the first five years after the start of the crisis. This was followed by weaker multi‐decadal warmer‐than‐baseline MSTs. The greatest warming occurred over Europe. This could be explained by the inter‐scenario differences in the state of the North Atlantic Oscillation.

Since the expression profile of ACE2, a crucial cell entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2, could indicate the susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection, here we systematically dissected ACE2 expression using large-scale multi-omics data from 30 organs/tissues, 33 cancer types and some common chronic diseases involving >28 000 samples. It was found that sex and age could be correlated with the susceptibility of SARS-CoV-2 infection for certain tissues. Strikingly, ACE2 was up-regulated in cervical squamous cell carcinoma and endocervical adenocarcinoma, colon adenocarcinoma, oesophageal carcinoma, kidney renal papillary cell carcinoma, lung adenocarcinoma and uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma compared to controls. Furthermore, the patients with common chronic diseases regarding angiocardiopathy, type 2 diabetes, liver, pneumonia and hypertension were also with higher ACE2 expression compared to related controls, which were validated using independent data sets. Collectively, our study may reveal a novel important mechanism that the patients with certain cancers and chronic diseases may express higher ACE2 expression compared to the individuals without diseases, which could lead to their higher susceptibility to multi-organ injury of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Li, Yunjin; Xu, Qiyue; Ma, Lu; Wu, Duojiao; Gao, Jie; Chen, Geng; Li, Hua",J Cell Mol Med,94,1

The restrictions in Israel included limitations on movement, reduction of working capacity and closure of the educational system. The present study focused on patients treated at a referral center for burns in northern Israel. Our goal was to investigate temporal variations in burn injuries during this period. Data was retrospectively extracted from the medical records of burn patients treated at our hospital between March 14, 2020 and April 20, 2020 (i.e., the period of aggravated lockdown). Data from this period was compared to that from paralleling periods between 2017-2019. During the lockdown and paralleling periods, 178 patients were treated for burn injuries, of whom 44% were under 18. Although no restrictions were enforced during the virus outbreak period with regard to seeking medical care, we noticed a decrease in the number of patients admitted to the emergency room for all reasons. Of particular interest was a 66% decrease in the number of adult burn patients (p&0.0001). Meanwhile, among the pediatric population, no significant decrease was observed. Nonetheless, subgroups with higher susceptibility to burn injuries included children aged 2-5 years (56.3% vs 23.8%, p=0.016) and female patients from all pediatric age groups (57.1% vs 25%, p=0.027). These findings may be explained by the presumably busier kitchen and dining areas during the lockdown. Overall, the study results can assist with building a stronger understanding of varying burn injuries, and with developing educational and preventive strategies.","Kruchevsky, Dani; Arraf, Maher; Levanon, Shir; Capucha, Tal; Ramon, Yitzchak; Ullmann, Yehuda",J. brun care res,94,5

Retrospective information from July 2013 to June 2014 was collected. A descriptive analysis was performed and results were inferred into the national dairy cattle population. Several management practices that could contribute to poor calf welfare were identified in a large proportion of farms. The annual calf mortality risk (calves that died between birth and weaning/calves born death or alive × 100, n = 149 farms) was 15.2%. Age at weaning averaged 75 d. Farmers reported that the most common clinical syndromes were diarrhea and respiratory disease in 85.2% and 47.5% of the farms, respectively.

SARS-CoV-2 infects ACE2-expressing cells and gains cell entry through either direct plasma membrane fusion or endocytosis. Recent studies have shown that in addition to ACE2, heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) also play an important role in SARS-CoV-2 cell attachment by serving as an attachment factor. Binding of viral spike protein to HSPGs leads to the enrichment of local concentration for the subsequent specific binding with ACE2. We therefore hypothesize that blocking the interactions between viral spike protein and the HSPGs will lead to inhibition of viral replication. In this study, we report our findings of the broad-spectrum antiviral activity and the mechanism of action of lactoferrin (LF) against multiple common human coronaviruses as well as SARS-CoV-2. Our study has shown that LF has broad-spectrum antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-229E in cell culture, and bovine lactoferrin (BLF) is more potent than human lactoferrin. Mechanistic studies revealed that BLF binds to HSPGs, thereby blocking viral attachment to the host cell. The antiviral activity of BLF can be antagonized by the HSPG mimetic heparin. Combination therapy experiment showed that the antiviral activity of LF is synergistic with remdesivir in cell culture. Molecular modelling suggests that the N-terminal positively charged region in BLF (residues 17-41) confers the binding to HSPGs. Overall, LF appears to be a promising drug candidate for COVID-19 that warrants further investigation.","Hu, Yanmei; Meng, Xiangzhi; Zhang, Fushun; Xiang, Yan; Wang, Jun",Emerg Microbes Infect,94,24

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) diagnostic assays play a central role in diagnosis and have fixed technical performance metrics. Interpretation becomes challenging because the clinical sensitivity changes as the virus clears and the immune response emerges. Our goal was to examine the clinical sensitivity of two most common SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic test modalities, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and serology, over the disease course to provide insight into their clinical interpretation in patients presenting to the hospital. We conducted a single-center, retrospective study. To derive clinical sensitivity of PCR, we identified 209 PCR-positive SARS-CoV-2 patients with multiple PCR test results (624 total PCR tests) and calculated daily sensitivity from date of symptom onset or first positive test. Clinical sensitivity of PCR decreased with days post symptom onset with >90% clinical sensitivity during the first 5 days after symptom onset, 70%-71% from Days 9 to 11, and 30% at Day 21. To calculate daily clinical sensitivity by serology, we utilized 157 PCR-positive patients with a total of 197 specimens tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for IgM, IgG, and IgA anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. In contrast to PCR, serological sensitivity increased with days post symptom onset with >50% of patients seropositive by at least one antibody isotype after Day 7, >80% after Day 12, and 100% by Day 21. Taken together, PCR and serology are complimentary modalities that require time-dependent interpretation. Superimposition of sensitivities over time indicate that serology can function as a reliable diagnostic aid indicating recent or prior infection.","Miller, Tyler E; Garcia Beltran, Wilfredo F; Bard, Adam Z; Gogakos, Tasos; Anahtar, Melis N; Astudillo, Michael Gerino; Yang, Diane; Thierauf, Julia; Fisch, Adam S; Mahowald, Grace K; Fitzpatrick, Megan J; Nardi, Valentina; Feldman, Jared; Hauser, Blake M; Caradonna, Timothy M; Marble, Hetal D; Ritterhouse, Lauren L; Turbett, Sara E; Batten, Julie; Georgantas, Nicholas Zeke; Alter, Galit; Schmidt, Aaron G; Harris, Jason B; Gelfand, Jeffrey A; Poznansky, Mark C; Bernstein, Bradley E; Louis, David N; Dighe, Anand; Charles, Richelle C; Ryan, Edward T; Branda, John A; Pierce, Virginia M; Murali, Mandakolathur R; Iafrate, A John; Rosenberg, Eric S; Lennerz, Jochen K",FASEB j,94,14

We used Google Alerts, a content change detection and notification service, to prospectively analyze new radiology-related content appearing on the internet. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An automated notification was created on Google Alerts for the search term ""radiology,"" sending the user emails with up to 3 new links daily. All links from November 2019 through April 2020 were assessed by 2 of 3 independent raters using a coding system to classify the content source and primary topic of discussion. The top 5 primary topics were retrospectively evaluated to identify prevalent subcategories. Content viewing restrictions were documented. RESULTS: 526 links were accessed. The majority (68%) of links were created by non-radiology lay press, followed by radiology-related lay press (28%), university-based publications (2%), and professional society websites (2%). The primary topic of these links most frequently related to market trends (28%), promotional material (20%), COVID-19 (13%), artificial intelligence (8%), and new technology or equipment (5%). 15% of links discussed a topic sourced from another article, such as a peer-reviewed journal, though only 2 linked directly to the journal itself. 8% of links had content viewing restrictions. CONCLUSION: New radiology content was largely disseminated via non-radiology news sources; radiologists should therefore ensure their research and viewpoints are presented in these outlets. Google Alerts may be a useful tool to stay abreast of the most current public radiology subject matters, especially during these times of social isolation and rapidly evolving clinical practice.","Munawar, Kamran; Sugi, Mark D; Prabhu, Vinay",Curr. probl. diagn. radiol,94,27

Chest X-ray (CXR) imaging has several advantages over other imaging techniques as it is cheap, easily accessible, fast and portable. This paper explores the effect of various popular image enhancement techniques and states the effect of each of them on the detection performance. We have compiled the largest X-ray dataset called COVQU-20, consisting of 18,479 normal, non-COVID lung opacity and COVID-19 CXR images. To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest public COVID positive database. Ground glass opacity is the common symptom reported in COVID-19 pneumonia patients and so a mixture of 3616 COVID-19, 6012 non-COVID lung opacity, and 8851 normal chest X-ray images were used to create this dataset. Five different image enhancement techniques: histogram equalization, contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization, image complement, gamma correction, and Balance Contrast Enhancement Technique were used to improve COVID-19 detection accuracy. Six different Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) were investigated in this study. Gamma correction technique outperforms other enhancement techniques in detecting COVID-19 from standard and segmented lung CXR images. The accuracy, precision, sensitivity, f1-score, and specificity in the detection of COVID-19 with gamma correction on CXR images were 96.29%, 96.28%, 96.29%, 96.28% and 96.27% respectively. The accuracy, precision, sensitivity, F1-score, and specificity were 95.11 %, 94.55 %, 94.56 %, 94.53 % and 95.59 % respectively for segmented lung images. The proposed approach with very high and comparable performance will boost the fast and robust COVID-19 detection using chest X-ray images.","Rahman, Tawsifur; Khandakar, Amith; Qiblawey, Yazan; Tahir, Anas; Kiranyaz, Serkan; Kashem, Saad Bin Abul; Islam, Mohammad Tariqul; Maadeed, Somaya Al; Zughaier, Susu M; Khan, Muhammad Salman; Chowdhury, Muhammad E.

A focus on sex as a biological factor may suggest a potential therapeutic intervention for this disease. We assessed whether adding progesterone to standard of care (SOC) would improve clinical outcomes of hospitalized men with moderate to severe COVID-19. RESEARCH QUESTION: Does short-term subcutaneous administration of progesterone safely improve clinical outcome in hypoxemic men hospitalized with COVID-19? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a pilot, randomized, open-label, controlled trial of subcutaneous progesterone in men hospitalized with confirmed moderate to severe COVID-19. Patients were randomly assigned to receive SOC plus progesterone (100 mg subcutaneously twice daily for up to 5 days) or SOC alone. In addition to assessment of safety, the primary outcome was change in clinical status on day 7. Length of hospital stay and number of days on supplemental oxygen were key secondary outcomes. RESULTS: Forty-two patients were enrolled from April 2020 to August 2020; 22 were randomized to the control group and 20 to the progesterone group. Two patients from the progesterone group withdrew from the study before receiving progesterone. There was a 1.5-point overall improvement in median clinical status score on a seven-point ordinal scale from baseline to day 7 in patients in the progesterone group as compared with control subjects (95% CI, 0.0-2.0; P = .024). There were no serious adverse events attributable to progesterone. Patients treated with progesterone required three fewer days of supplemental oxygen (median, 4.5 vs 7.5 days) and were hospitalized for 2.5 fewer days (median, 7.0 vs 9.5 days) as compared with control subjects. INTERPRETATION: Progesterone at a dose of 100 mg, twice daily by subcutaneous injection in addition to SOC, may represent a safe and effective approach for treatment in hypoxemic men with moderate to severe COVID-19.

SARS Coronavirus (SARS-CoV), MERS Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and the novel coronavirus, previously dubbed 2019-nCoV, and now officially named SARS-CoV-2, are the causative agents of the SARS, MERS, and COVID-19 disease outbreaks, respectively. Safe vaccines that rapidly induce potent and long-lasting virus-specific immune responses against these infectious agents are urgently needed. The coronavirus spike (S) protein, a characteristic structural component of the viral envelope, is considered a key target for vaccines for the prevention of coronavirus infection. METHODS: We first generated codon optimized MERS-S1 subunit vaccines fused with a foldon trimerization domain to mimic the native viral structure. In variant constructs, we engineered immune stimulants (RS09 or flagellin, as TLR4 or TLR5 agonists, respectively) into this trimeric design. We comprehensively tested the pre-clinical immunogenicity of MERS-CoV vaccines in mice when delivered subcutaneously by traditional needle injection, or intracutaneously by dissolving microneedle arrays (MNAs) by evaluating virus specific IgG antibodies in the serum of vaccinated mice by ELISA and using virus neutralization assays. Driven by the urgent need for COVID-19 vaccines, we utilized this strategy to rapidly develop MNA SARS-CoV-2 subunit vaccines and tested their pre-clinical immunogenicity in vivo by exploiting our substantial experience with MNA MERS-CoV vaccines. FINDINGS: Here we describe the development of MNA delivered MERS-CoV vaccines and their pre-clinical immunogenicity. Specifically, MNA delivered MERS-S1 subunit vaccines elicited strong and long-lasting antigen-specific antibody responses. Building on our ongoing efforts to develop MERS-CoV vaccines, promising immunogenicity of MNA-delivered MERS-CoV vaccines, and our experience with MNA fabrication and delivery, including clinical trials, we rapidly designed and produced clinically-translatable MNA SARS-CoV-2 subunit vaccines within 4 weeks of the identification of the SARS-CoV-2 S1 sequence. Most importantly, these MNA delivered SARS-CoV-2 S1 subunit vaccines elicited potent antigen-specific antibody responses that were evident beginning 2 weeks after immunization. INTERPRETATION: MNA delivery of coronaviruses-S1 subunit vaccines is a promising immunization strategy against coronavirus infection. Progressive scientific and technological efforts enable quicker responses to emerging pandemics. Our ongoing efforts to develop MNA-MERS-S1 subunit vaccines enabled us to rapidly design and produce MNA SARS-CoV-2 subunit vaccines capable of inducing potent virus-specific antibody responses. Collectively, our results support the clinical development of MNA delivered recombinant protein subunit vaccines against SARS, MERS, COVID-19, and other emerging infectious diseases.","Kim, Eun; Erdos, Geza; Huang, Shaohua; Kenniston, Thomas W; Balmert, Stephen C; Carey, Cara Donahue; Raj, V Stalin; Epperly, Michael W; Klimstra, William B; Haagmans, Bart L; Korkmaz, Emrullah; Falo, Louis D; Gambotto, Andrea",EBioMedicine,94,20

Nevertheless, the sample from Malaysia is still under-sequenced. Hence lacking clarity of the circulating strain in Malaysia leads to a deadlock in understanding the virus infectivity. This study aimed to investigate the genome identity of circulating COVID-19 strains in Pahang and understand disease epidemiology during the pandemic. This study leveraged high-throughput sequencing analysis for the whole genome sequencing and implemented bioinformatic technique for the analysis. Here we reported that the virus with D614G mutation in Spike protein circulates in a few Malaysia states before the Sivagangga cluster announced in Kedah in July 2020. This mutated virus includes our virus sample isolated in April 2020 from an asymptomatic patient in Pahang. Based on the phylogenetic analysis, we discovered the origin of our sample Pahang/IIUM91 was not related to Sivagangga cluster. Here, we have generated 3D structure model of Pahang/IIUM91 Spike protein. D614G mutation in Pahang/IIUM91 Spike protein increases viral stability and flexibility, hence render higher infectivity. Collectively, our results suggest for the establishment of a complete SARS-CoV-2 genome database in Malaysia. Hence, more research should be established to learn the behaviour of this virus.","Syahida Mat Yassim, Aini; Fazli Farida Asras, Mohd; Mahfuz Gazali, Ahmad; Marcial-Coba, Martin S; Afeera Zainulabid, Ummu; Fauzan Bin Ahmad, Hajar",,94,16

Here different symptoms of neurological and/or cardiological origin have been reported. With symptoms, which are very similar to the ones reported but are not caused by SARS-CoV-2, the occurrence of functionally active autoantibodies (fAABs) targeting G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR-fAABs) has been discussed to be involved. We, therefore investigated, whether GPCR-fAABs are detectable in 31 patients suffering from different Long-COVID-19 symptoms after recovery from the acute phase of the disease. The spectrum of symptoms was mostly of neurological origin (29/31 patients), including post-COVID-19 fatigue, alopecia, attention deficit, tremor and others. Combined neurological and cardiovascular disorders were reported in 17 of the 31 patients. Two recovered COVID-19 patients were free of follow-up symptoms. All 31 former COVID-19 patients had between 2 and 7 different GPCR-fAABs that acted as receptor agonists. Some of those GPCR-fAABs activate their target receptors which cause a positive chronotropic effect in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes, the read-out in the test system for their detection (bioassay for GPCR-fAAB detection). Other GPCR-fAABs, in opposite, cause a negative chronotropic effect on those cells. The positive chronotropic GPCR-fAABs identified in the blood of Long-COVID patients targeted the ß2-adrenoceptor (ß2-fAAB), the &#945;1-adrenoceptor (&#945;1-fAAB), the angiotensin II AT1-receptor (AT1-fAAB), and the nociceptin-like opioid receptor (NOC-fAAB). The negative chronotropic GPCR-fAABs identified targeted the muscarinic M2-receptor (M2-fAAB), the MAS-receptor (MAS-fAAB), and the ETA-receptor (ETA-fAAB). It was analysed which of the extracellular receptor loops was targeted by the autoantibodies.","Wallukat, Gerd; Hohberger, Bettina; Wenzel, Katrin; Fürst, Julia; Schulze-Rothe, Sara; Wallukat, Anne; Hönicke, Anne-Sophie; Müller, Johannes",J Transl Autoimmun,94,0

Optimising MV care to a specific patient with respiratory failure is difficult due to inter- and intra- patient variability in lung mechanics and condition. The ability to accurately predict patient-specific lung response to a change in MV settings would enable semi -automated care and significantly improve the efficiency of MV monitoring and care. It has particular emphasis when considering MV care required to treat Covid-19 patients, who require longer MV care, where patient-specific care can reduce the time on MV required. This study develops a nonlinear smooth hysteresis loop model (HLM) able to capture the essential lung dynamics in a patient-specific fashion from measured ventilator data, particularly for changes of compliance and infection points of the pressure-volume loop. The automated (no human input) hysteresis loop analysis (HLA) method is applied to identify HLM model parameters, enabling automated digital cloning to create a virtual patient model to accurately predict lung response at a specified positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) level, as well as in response to the changes of PEEP. The performance of this automated digital cloning approach is assessed using clinical data from 4 patients and 8 recruitment maneuver (RM) arms. Validation results show the HLM-based hysteresis loops identified using HLA match clinical pressure volume loops very well with root-mean-square (RMS) errors less than 2% for all 8 data sets over 4 patients, validating the accuracy of the developed HLM in capturing the essential lung physiology and respiratory behaviours at different patient conditions. More importantly, the patient-specific digital clones at lower PEEP levels accurately predict lung response at higher PEEP levels with predicted peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) errors less than 2% in average. In addition, the resulted additional lung volume Vfrc obtained with PEEP changes are predicted with average absolute difference of 0.025L. The overall results validate the versatility and potential of the developed HLM for delineating changes of nonlinear lung dynamics, and its capability to create a predictive virtual patient with use of HLA for future treatment personalization and optimisation in MV therapy.

A safe and effective vaccine remains urgently needed. METHOD: We constructed three variants of the recombinant receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein (residues 331-549) in yeast as follows: (1) a ""wild type"" RBD (RBD219-WT), (2) a deglycosylated form (RBD219-N1) by deleting the first N-glycosylation site, and (3) a combined deglycosylated and cysteine-mutagenized form (C538A-mutated variant (RBD219-N1C1)). We compared the expression yields, biophysical characteristics, and functionality of the proteins produced from these constructs. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: These three recombinant RBDs showed similar secondary and tertiary structure thermal stability and had the same affinity to their receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2), suggesting that the selected deletion or mutations did not cause any significant structural changes or alteration of function. However, RBD219-N1C1 had a higher fermentation yield, was easier to purify, was not hyperglycosylated, and had a lower tendency to form oligomers, and thus was selected for further vaccine development and evaluation. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: By genetic modification, we were able to design a better-controlled and more stable vaccine candidate, which is an essential and important criterion for any process and manufacturing of biologics or drugs for human use.","Chen, Wen-Hsiang; Wei, Junfei; Kundu, Rakhi Tyagi; Adhikari, Rakesh; Liu, Zhuyun; Lee, Jungsoon; Versteeg, Leroy; Poveda, Cristina; Keegan, Brian; Villar, Maria Jose; de Araujo Leao, Ana C; Rivera, Joanne Altieri; Gillespie, Portia M; Pollet, Jeroen; Strych, Ulrich; Zhan, Bin; Hotez, Peter J; Bottazzi, Maria Elena",Biochim Biophys Acta Gen Subj,94,6

The virulence factors of B. holmesii and their role in the pathogenesis remain unknown. Lipopolysaccharide is the main surface antigen of all Bordetellae. Data on the structural features of the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of B. holmesii are scarce. The poly- and oligosaccharide components released by mild acidic hydrolysis of the LPS were separated and investigated by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and chemical methods. The structures of the O-specific polysaccharide and the core oligosaccharide of B. holmesii ATCC 51541 have been identified for the first time. The novel pentasaccharide repeating unit of the B. holmesii O-specific polysaccharide has the following structure: {â2)-&#945;-l-Rhap-(1â6)-&#945;-d-Glcp-(1â4)-[ß-d-GlcpNAc-(1â3]-&#945;-d-Galp-(1â3)-&#945;-d-GlcpNAc-(1â}n. The SDS-PAGE and serological cross-reactivities of the B. holmesii LPS suggested the similarity between the core oligosaccharides of B. holmesii ATCC 51541 and B. pertussis strain 606. The main oligosaccharide fraction contained a nonasaccharide. The comparative analysis of the NMR spectra of B. holmesii core oligosaccharide fraction with this of the B. pertussis strain 606 indicated that the investigated core oligosaccharides were identical.","Ucieklak, Karolina; Koj, Sabina; Niedziela, Tomasz",,94,15

We aimed to provide an alternative to laboratory tests and to assess the value of home testing as part of our regular services going forward. METHODS: Home test kits as well as accompanying user instructions were made available to our patients with paediatric IBD that required faecal calprotectin test between 17 April and 12 August 2020. Once the user completed the test, results were automatically uploaded to the result portal and clinical staff were alerted. A user feedback questionnaire was sent to users that had completed the home test. RESULTS: Of the 54 patients, 41 (76%) aged between 4.7 and 18.1 years used the home test. A total of 45 home tests were done, one of which produced an invalid result. The decision to modify management was made in 12 (29%) of the patients, while 14 (34%) had no changes made and 15 (37%) required further assessment. Twenty (48.8%) responded to the questionnaire and 85% stated that they preferred the home test to the laboratory testing method. CONCLUSIONS: Home calprotectin tests were useful in guiding clinical management during a time when laboratory testing was less available. They may offer benefits as part of routine paediatric IBD monitoring to help target appointments and reduce unnecessary hospital attendances in the future.","Jere, Mwansa; Garrick, Vikki; Curtis, Lee; Tayler, Rachel; Gervais, Lisa; Gerasimidis, Konstantinos; Hansen, Richard",,94,16

We found both short- and long-term observational relationships with a range of regulated pollutants, although only two studies considered both cases (i.e., infections) and deaths within a common analytical framework. Most of these studies were limited to a few months of the pandemic period. Statistically significant relationships were found more often for PM2.5 and NO2 than for other regulated pollutants, but no rationale was suggested for such short-term relationships;latency was seldom considered for long-term relationships. It was also unclear whether confounding had been adequately controlled in either type of study. Studies of air quality improvement following lockdowns found more robust relationships with local (CO, NO2) rather than regional (PM2.5, O3) pollutants, but meteorological confounding was seldom considered. Only one of seven studies of airborne virus transmission reported actual measurements. Overall, we found the existing body of literature to be more suggestive than definitive. Due to these various deficiencies, we assembled a new state-level database of cumulative COVID-19 cases and deaths through March 2021 with a range of potential predictor variables and performed linear regression analyses on various combinations. As single predictors, we found significant (p &lt;0.05) relationships between cumulative cases and household crowding (+), education (−), face-mask usage (−), or voting Republican (+). For cumulative deaths, we found significant relationships with education (−), black race (+), or previous levels of PM2.5 (+). NOx (+), and elemental carbon (EC, +). We found no relationships between long-term air quality and cumulative COVID-19 cases. Our associations linking air pollution with COVID-19 mortality were not statistically different from those for all-cause mortality in previous studies. In multiple mortality regressions combining air pollution, race, and education, NOx and EC remained significant but PM2.5 did not. We concluded that the current worldwide emphasis on PM2.5 is misplaced. We predicted air pollutant effects of a few percentage points, but individual differences between races, political identification, and post-graduate education were of the order of factors of 2 to 4. In general, the factors predicting infection were personal and related to COVID-19 exposure, while those predicting subsequent mortality tended to be more situational and related to geography. Overall, we concluded that how you live is more important than where you live.","Lipfert, Frederick W.; Wyzga, Ronald E.",Environments,94,24

METHODS: Retrospective, observational cohort study of all adult patients (18 years and older) consecutively admitted with laboratory-confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 infection between March 13 and April 25, 2020 at the University of Mississippi Medical Center. All of the patients either survived to hospital discharge or died during hospitalization. Demographics, body mass index, comorbidities, clinical manifestations, and laboratory findings were collected. Patient outcomes (need for invasive mechanical ventilation and in-hospital death) were analyzed. RESULTS: One hundred patients were included, 53% of whom were women. Median age was 59 years (interquartile range 44-70) and 66% were younger than 65. Seventy-five percent identified themselves as Black, despite representing 58% of hospitalized patients at our institution in 2019. Common comorbid conditions included hypertension (68%), obesity (65%), and diabetes mellitus (31%). Frequent clinical manifestations included shortness of breath (76%), cough (75%), and fever (64%). Symptoms were present for a median of 7 days (interquartile range 4-7) on presentation. Twenty-four percent of patients required mechanical ventilation and, overall, 19% died (67% of those requiring mechanical ventilation). Eighty-four percent of those who died were Black. On multivariate analysis, ever smoking (odds ratio [OR] 5.9, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.2-28.6) and history of diabetes mellitus (OR 5.9, 95% CI 1.5-24.3) were associated with mortality, and those admitted from home were less likely to die (vs outside facility, OR 0.2, 95% CI 0.0-0.7).

However, the broad restrictive measures typically associated with lockdowns, though effective, also comes at a cost - imposing significant social and economic burdens on individuals and societies, especially for those in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Like most high-income countries (HICs), many LMICs initially adopted broad lockdown strategies for COVID-19 in the first wave of the pandemic. While many HICs experiencing subsequent waves have returned to employing lockdown strategies until they can receive the first shipments of COVID-19 vaccine, many LMICs will likely have to wait much longer to get comparable access for their own citizens. In leaving LMICs vulnerable to subsequent waves for a longer period of time without vaccines, there is a risk LMICs will be tempted to re-impose lockdown measures in the meantime. In response to the urgent need for more policy development around the contextual challenges involved in employing such measures, we propose some strategies LMICs could adopt for safe and responsible lockdown entrance/exit or to avoid re-imposing coercive restrictive lockdown measures altogether.","Eyawo, Oghenowede; Viens, A M; Ugoji, Uchechukwu Chidiebere",Global Health,94,20

Thus, there is an urgent need for developing treatments for COVID-19. Drug repurposing, which is the process of reusing already-approved drugs for new medical conditions, can be a good way to solve this problem quickly and broadly. Many clinical trials for COVID-19 patients using treatments for other diseases have already been in place or will be performed at clinical sites in the near future. Additionally, patients with comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus, obesity, liver cirrhosis, kidney diseases, hypertension, and asthma are at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19. Thus, the relationship of comorbidity disease with COVID-19 may help to find repurposable drugs. To reduce trial and error in finding treatments for COVID-19, we propose building a network-based drug repurposing framework to prioritize repurposable drugs. First, we utilized knowledge of COVID-19 to construct a disease-gene-drug network (DGDr-Net) representing a COVID-19-centric interactome with components for diseases, genes, and drugs. DGDr-Net consisted of 592 diseases, 26,681 human genes and 2,173 drugs, and medical information for 18 common comorbidities. The DGDr-Net recommended candidate repurposable drugs for COVID-19 through network reinforcement driven scoring algorithms. The scoring algorithms determined the priority of recommendations by utilizing graph-based semi-supervised learning. From the predicted scores, we recommended 30 drugs, including dexamethasone, resveratrol, methotrexate, indomethacin, quercetin, etc., as repurposable drugs for COVID-19, and the results were verified with drugs that have been under clinical trials. The list of drugs via a data-driven computational approach could help reduce trial-and-error in finding treatment for COVID-19.","Nam, Yonghyun; Yun, Jae-Seung; Lee, Seung Mi; Park, Ji Won; Chen, Ziqi; Lee, Brian; Verma, Anurag; Ning, Xia; Shen, Li; Kim, Dokyoon",,94,16

Entry of the SARS-CoV-2 into the host cell involves interaction of the virus (via the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of its spike glycoprotein) with the membrane-bound form of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) followed by the virus-ACE2 complex internalization by the cell. Since ACE2 is expressed in various tissues, such as brain, gut, heart, kidney, and lung, and since these organs represent obvious targets for the SARS-CoV-2 infection, therapeutic approaches were developed to either inhibit ACE2 or reduce its expression as a means of prevention of the virus entry into the corresponding host cells. The problem here is that in addition to be a receptor for the SARS-CoV-2 entry into the host cells, ACE2 acts as a key component of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) aimed at the generation of a cascade of vasoactive peptides coordinating several physiological processes. In RAAS, ACE2 degrades angiotensin II, which is a multifunctional CVD-promoting peptide hormone and converts it to a heptapeptide angiotensin-(1-7) acting as the angiotensin II antagonist. As protein multifunctionality is commonly associated with the presence of flexible or disordered regions, we analyze here the intrinsic disorder predisposition of major players related to the SARS-CoV-2 - RAAS axis. We show that all considered proteins contain intrinsically disordered regions that might have specific functions. Since intrinsic disorder might play a role in the functionality of query proteins and be related to the COVID-19 pathogenesis, this work represents an important disorder-based outlook of an interplay between the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and SARS-CoV-2. It also suggests that consideration of the intrinsic disorder phenomenon should be added to the modern arsenal of means for drug development.","Elrashdy, Fatma; Redwan, Elrashdy M; Uversky, Vladimir N",Infect Genet Evol,94,4

We aimed to critically appraise and synthesise published evidence on the risk factors for poor outcomes in hospitalised COVID-19 patients. Methods: We searched PubMed, medRxiv and the WHO COVID-19 literature database for studies that reported characteristics of COVID-19 patients who required hospitalisation. We included studies published between January and May 2020 that reported adjusted effect size of any demographic and/or clinical factors for any of the three poor outcomes: mortality, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and invasive mechanical ventilation. We appraised the quality of the included studies using Joanna Briggs Institute appraisal tools and quantitatively synthesised the evidence through a series of random-effect meta-analyses. To aid data interpretation, we further developed an interpretation framework that indicated strength of the evidence, informed by both quantity and quality of the evidence. Results: We included a total of 40 studies in our review. Most of the included studies (29/40, 73%) were assessed as ""good quality"", with assessment scores of 80 or more. We found that male sex (pooled odds ratio (OR) = 1.32 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.18-1.48; 20 studies), older age (OR = 1.05, 95% CI = 1.04-1.07, per one year of age increase; 10 studies), obesity (OR = 1.59, 95% CI = 1.02-2.48; 4 studies), diabetes (OR = 1.25, 95% CI = 1.11-1.40; 11 studies) and chronic kidney diseases (6 studies; OR = 1.57, 95% CI = 1.27-1.93) were associated with increased risks for mortality with the greatest strength of evidence based on our interpretation framework. We did not find increased risk of mortality for several factors including chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (5 studies), cancer (4 studies), or current smoker (5 studies); however, this does not indicate absence of risk due to limited data on each of these factors. Conclusion: Male sex, older age, obesity, diabetes and chronic kidney diseases are important risk factors of COVID-19 poor outcomes. Our review provides not only an appraisal and synthesis of evidence on the risk factors of COVID-19 poor outcomes, but also a data interpretation framework that could be adopted by relevant future research.","Li, You; Ashcroft, Thulani; Chung, Alexandria; Dighero, Izzie; Dozier, Marshall; Horne, Margaret; McSwiggan, Emilie; Shamsuddin, Azwa; Nair, Harish",J Glob Health,94,26

Now is opportune to gain a deeper understanding of what may have happened. The findings can help inform mitigation strategies in the disease-affected countries. Methods: In this work, we examine an essential factor that characterizes the disease transmission patterns: the interactions among people. We develop a computational model to reveal the interactions in terms of the social contact patterns among the population of different age-groups. We divide a city's population into seven age-groups: 0-6 years old (children); 7-14 (primary and junior high school students); 15-17 (high school students); 18-22 (university students); 23-44 (young/middle-aged people); 45-64 years old (middle-aged/elderly people); and 65 or above (elderly people). We consider four representative settings of social contacts that may cause the disease spread: (1) individual households; (2) schools, including primary/high schools as well as colleges and universities; (3) various physical workplaces; and (4) public places and communities where people can gather, such as stadiums, markets, squares, and organized tours. A contact matrix is computed to describe the contact intensity between different age-groups for each of the four settings. By integrating the four contact matrices with the next-generation matrix, we quantitatively characterize the underlying transmission patterns of COVID-19 among different populations. Findings: We focus our study on 6 representative cities in China: Wuhan, the epicenter of COVID-19, together with Beijing, Tianjin, Hangzhou, Suzhou, and Shenzhen, which are five major cities from three key economic zones. The results show that the social contact-based analysis can readily explain the underlying disease transmission patterns as well as the associated risks (including both confirmed and unconfirmed cases). In Wuhan, the age-groups involving relatively intensive contacts in households and public/communities are dispersedly distributed. This can explain why the transmission of COVID-19 in the early stage mainly took place in public places and families in Wuhan. We estimate that Feb. 11, 2020 was the date with the highest transmission risk in Wuhan, which is consistent with the actual peak period of the reported case number (Feb. 4-14). Moreover, the surge in the number of new cases reported on Feb. 12-13 in Wuhan can readily be captured using our model, showing its ability in forecasting the potential/unconfirmed cases. We further estimate the disease transmission risks associated with different work resumption plans in these cities after the outbreak. The estimation results are consistent with the actual situations in the cities with relatively lenient control policies, such as Beijing, and those with strict control policies, such as Shenzhen. Interpretation: With an in-depth characterization of age-specific social contact-based transmission, the retrospective and prospective situations of the disease outbreak, including the past and future transmission risks, the effectiveness of different interventions, and the disease transmission risks of restoring normal social activities, are computationally analyzed and reasonably explained. The conclusions drawn from the study not only provide a comprehensive explanation of the underlying COVID-19 transmission patterns in China, but more importantly, offer the social contact-based risk analysis methods that can readily be applied to guide intervention planning and operational responses in other countries, so that the impact of COVID-19 pandemic can be strategically mitigated.

We aimed to estimate the impact and health system cost of implementing post-exposure prophylaxis against household exposure to COVID-19 with monoclonal antibodies. MethodsWe developed a decision-analytical model analysis of results from a recent randomized controlled trial with complementary data on household demographic structure, vaccine coverage, and COVID-19 confirmed case counts for the representative month of May, 2021. The model population includes individuals of all ages in the United States by sex and race/ethnicity. ResultsIn a month of similar intensity to May, 2021, in the USA, a monoclonal antibody post-exposure prophylaxis program reaching 50% of exposed unvaccinated household members aged 50+, would avert 1,813 (1,171 - 2,456) symptomatic infections, 526 (343 - 716) hospitalizations, and 83 (56 - 116) deaths.

Although memes are typically humorous, recent days have witnessed an escalation of harmful memes used for trolling, cyberbullying, and abuse. Detecting such memes is challenging as they can be highly satirical and cryptic. Moreover, while previous work has focused on specific aspects of memes such as hate speech and propaganda, there has been little work on harm in general. Here, we aim to bridge this gap. We focus on two tasks: (i)detecting harmful memes, and (ii)identifying the social entities they target. We further extend a recently released HarMeme dataset, which covered COVID-19, with additional memes and a new topic: US politics. To solve these tasks, we propose MOMENTA (MultimOdal framework for detecting harmful MemEs aNd Their tArgets), a novel multimodal deep neural network that uses global and local perspectives to detect harmful memes. MOMENTA systematically analyzes the local and the global perspective of the input meme (in both modalities) and relates it to the background context. MOMENTA is interpretable and generalizable, and our experiments show that it outperforms several strong rivaling approaches.","Pramanick, Shraman; Sharma, Shivam; Dimitrov, Dimitar; Akhtar, Md Shad; Nakov, Preslav; Chakraborty, Tanmoy",,94,20

Spain's health care system has been exposed to uncontrollable numbers of patients over a short period, causing the system to collapse. Given that diagnosis is not immediate, and there is no effective treatment for COVID-19, other tools have had to be developed to identify patients at the risk of severe disease complications and thus optimize material and human resources in health care. There are no tools to identify patients who have a worse prognosis than others. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to process a sample of electronic health records of patients with COVID-19 in order to develop a machine learning model to predict the severity of infection and mortality from among clinical laboratory parameters. Early patient classification can help optimize material and human resources, and analysis of the most important features of the model could provide more detailed insights into the disease. METHODS: After an initial performance evaluation based on a comparison with several other well-known methods, the extreme gradient boosting algorithm was selected as the predictive method for this study. In addition, Shapley Additive Explanations was used to analyze the importance of the features of the resulting model. RESULTS: After data preprocessing, 1823 confirmed patients with COVID-19 and 32 predictor features were selected. On bootstrap validation, the extreme gradient boosting classifier yielded a value of 0.97 (95% CI 0.96-0.98) for the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve, 0.86 (95% CI 0.80-0.91) for the area under the precision-recall curve, 0.94 (95% CI 0.92-0.95) for accuracy, 0.77 (95% CI 0.72-0.83) for the F-score, 0.93 (95% CI 0.89-0.98) for sensitivity, and 0.91 (95% CI 0.86-0.96) for specificity. The 4 most relevant features for model prediction were lactate dehydrogenase activity, C-reactive protein levels, neutrophil counts, and urea levels. CONCLUSIONS: Our predictive model yielded excellent results in the differentiating among patients who died of COVID-19, primarily from among laboratory parameter values. Analysis of the resulting model identified a set of features with the most significant impact on the prediction, thus relating them to a higher risk of mortality.","Domínguez-Olmedo, Juan L; Gragera-Martínez, Álvaro; Mata, Jacinto; Pachón Álvarez, Victoria",J Med Internet Res,94,29

Developing antiviral drugs is a challenge for the scientific community and pharmaceutical industry. Given the health emergency, repurposing of existing antiviral, antiinflammatory or antimalarial drugs is an attractive option for controlling SARS-CoV-2 with drugs. However, phytochemicals selected based on ethnomedicinal information as well as in vitro antiviral studies could be promising as well. Here, we summarise the phytochemicals with reported anti-CoV activity, and further analyzed them computationally to accelerate validation for drug development against SARS-CoV-2. This systematic review started from the most potent phytocompounds (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; in muM) against SARS-CoV, followed by a cluster analysis to locate the most suitable lead(s). The advanced molecular docking used the crystallography structure of SARS-CoV-2-cysteine-like protease (SARS-CoV-2-3CL&lt;sup&gt;pro&lt;/sup&gt;) as a target. In total, seventy-eight phytochemicals with anti-CoV activity against different strains in cellular assays, were selected for this computational study, and compared with two existing repurposed FDA-approved drugs: lopinavir and ritonavir.

Therefore, we investigated the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients with diarrhea. METHODS: We included 118 COVID-19 patients admitted to a single hospital from February 20 to March 31, 2020. Medical records with clinical characteristics, laboratory data, treatment course, and clinical outcomes were compared based on the presence or absence of diarrhea. Prognostic factors for disease severity and mortality in COVID-19 were also assessed. RESULTS: Among patients, 54 (45.8%) had diarrhea, whereas seven (5.9%) had only diarrhea. The median age of patients with diarrhea was 59 years (44 to 64), and 22 (40.7%) were male. Systemic steroid use, intensive care unit admission, septic shock, and acute respiratory distress syndrome were less frequent in the diarrhea group than in the non-diarrhea group. No significant differences were observed in total hospital stay and mortality between groups. On multivariate analysis, age (odds ratio [OR], 1.06; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.01 to 1.12; p = 0.044), diabetes (OR, 3.00; 95% CI, 1.25 to 20.47; p = 0.042), and dyspnea (OR, 41.19; 95% CI, 6.60 to 823.16; p < 0.001) were independent risk factors for septic shock. On Cox regression analysis, diabetes (hazard ratio [HR], 4.82; 95% CI, 0.89 to 26.03; p = 0.043) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (HR, 16.58; 95% CI, 3.10 to 88.70; p = 0.044) were risk factors for mortality.

METHODS: In phase 1a of this clinical trial, we assessed the safety, side-effect profile, and pharmacokinetics of TY014, a fully human IgG1 anti-yellow fever virus monoclonal antibody. In a double-blind, phase 1b clinical trial, we assessed the efficacy of TY014, as compared with placebo, in abrogating viremia related to the administration of live yellow fever vaccine (YF17D-204; Stamaril). The primary safety outcomes were adverse events reported 1 hour after the infusion and throughout the trial. The primary efficacy outcome was the dose of TY014 at which 100% of the participants tested negative for viremia within 48 hours after infusion. RESULTS: A total of 27 healthy participants were enrolled in phase 1a, and 10 participants in phase 1b. During phase 1a, TY014 dose escalation to a maximum of 20 mg per kilogram of body weight occurred in 22 participants. During phases 1a and 1b, adverse events within 1 hour after infusion occurred in 1 of 27 participants who received TY014 and in none of the 10 participants who received placebo. At least one adverse event occurred during the trial in 22 participants who received TY014 and in 8 who received placebo. The mean half-life of TY014 was approximately 12.8 days. At 48 hours after the infusion, none of the 5 participants who received the starting dose of TY014 of 2 mg per kilogram had detectable YF17D-204 viremia; these participants remained aviremic throughout the trial. Viremia was observed at 48 hours after the infusion in 2 of 5 participants who received placebo and at 72 hours in 2 more placebo recipients. Symptoms associated with yellow fever vaccine were less frequent in the TY014 group than in the placebo group. CONCLUSIONS: This phase 1 trial of TY014 did not identify worrisome safety signals and suggested potential clinical benefit, which requires further assessment in a phase 2 trial.

We hereby review the rapid responses in the community of medical imaging (empowered by AI) toward COVID-19. For example, AI-empowered image acquisition can significantly help automate the scanning procedure and also reshape the workflow with minimal contact to patients, providing the best protection to the imaging technicians. Also, AI can improve work efficiency by accurate delineation of infections in X-ray and CT images, facilitating subsequent quantification. Moreover, the computer-aided platforms help radiologists make clinical decisions, i.e., for disease diagnosis, tracking, and prognosis. In this review paper, we thus cover the entire pipeline of medical imaging and analysis techniques involved with COVID-19, including image acquisition, segmentation, diagnosis, and follow-up. We particularly focus on the integration of AI with X-ray and CT, both of which are widely used in the frontline hospitals, in order to depict the latest progress of medical imaging and radiology fighting against COVID-19.","Shi, Feng; Wang, Jun; Shi, Jun; Wu, Ziyan; Wang, Qian; Tang, Zhenyu; He, Kelei; Shi, Yinghuan; Shen, Dinggang",,94,1

METHODS: This is a nationwide retrospective case-control study of 219,961 individuals, aged 18 years or older, whose medical costs for COVID-19 testing were claimed until May 15, 2020. COVID-19 diagnosis and infection severity were identified from reimbursement data using diagnosis codes and on the basis of respiratory support use, respectively. Odds ratios (ORs) were estimated using multiple logistic regression, after adjusting for age, sex, region, healthcare utilization, and insurance status. RESULTS: The COVID-19 group (7,341 of 219,961) was young and had a high proportion of female. Overall, 13.0% (954 of 7,341) of the cases were severe.

However, is the importance placed on stethoscopes justified today? We now have devices like portable ultrasound machines that make it much easier to visualize the body. These devices offset their higher initial cost by reducing downstream costs due to their greater accuracy and their capability of detecting diseases at an earlier stage. Also, because of the COVID-19 pandemic, new ways are being investigated to reduce the transmission of diseases. Stethoscopes being a possible vector for infectious agents coupled with the advent of newer devices that can visualize the body with greater accuracy put into question the continued use of stethoscopes today.

Fast-paced environmental changes have influenced contact of human populations with newly identified microbes resulting in diseases that can spread quickly. These microbes can cause infections like HIV, SARS-CoV2, malaria, nosocomial Escherichia coli, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), or Candida infection for which there are no available vaccines/drugs or are less efficient to prevent or treat these infections. In the pursuit to find potential safe agents for therapy of microbial infections, natural biflavonoids like amentoflavone, tetrahydroamentoflavone, ginkgetin, bilobetin, morelloflavone, agathisflavone, hinokiflavone, Garcinia biflavones 1 (GB1), Garcinia biflavones 2 (GB2), robustaflavone, strychnobiflavone, ochnaflavone, dulcisbiflavonoid C, tetramethoxy-6,6â³-bigenkwanin and other derivatives isolated from several species of plants can provide effective starting points and become a source of future drugs. These biflavonoids show activity against influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), dengue, HIV-AIDS, coxsackieviral, hepatitis, HSV, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), protozoal (Leishmaniasis, Malaria) infections, bacterial and fungal infections. Some of the biflavonoids can provide antiviral and protozoal activity by inhibition of neuraminidase, chymotrypsin-like protease, DV-NS5 RNA dependant RNA polymerase, reverse transcriptase (RT), fatty acid synthase, DNA polymerase, UL54 gene expression, Epstein-Barr virus early antigen activation, recombinant cysteine protease type 2.8 (r-CPB2.8), Plasmodium falciparum enoyl-acyl carrier protein (ACP) reductase or cause depolarization of parasitic mitochondrial membranes. They may also provide anti-inflammatory therapeutic activity against the infection-induced cytokine storm. Considering the varied bioactivity of these biflavonoids against these organisms, their structure-activity relationships are derived and wherever possible compared with monoflavones.

A questionnaire was carried out in the University of Malta Faculties of Health Sciences, Dentistry and Medicine to ascertain degree of vaccine hesitancy vis-à-vis influenza and COVID-19 vaccination. METHODS: An anonymous questionnaire was sent through the faculty Deans and the respective secretaries via Google forms. RESULTS: The response rate was 23% (n = 852). The percentages of who took the influenza vaccine last year and who will take it this year increased at all ages, highest for Medicine and Academics. For COVID-19 vaccination, unlikely, undecided and likely to take were 30.5/25.3/44.2% respectively. Medicine and Academics was also likeliest to take, as were males overall. The proportion of those likelier to take the COVID-19 vaccine was directly related to likelihood of taking influenza vaccination. Concerns pertaining to COVID-19 vaccination were related to insufficient knowledge about such a vaccine and potential long-term side effects. DISCUSSION: The increased influenza vaccine uptake is unsurprising in view of the current heightened awareness of respiratory disease. The hesitancy toward COVID-19 vaccination is of concern particularly in this health related group who should be better informed.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively studied 268 COVID-19 convalescent plasma donors and 162 COVID-19 inpatients (total 430 subjects, confirmed by RT-PCR) and 2,212 healthy volunteer first-time blood donors as a control group. These were further divided into two groups: those with anti-A (blood types O and B) and those without it (types A and AB). Titres of nucleoproteins, and neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 antibody were measured in the convalescent plasma donors and inpatients. Multivariate logistic regression and non-parametric tests were applied. RESULTS: Persons having types O or B showed less infection prevalence than those of types A or AB (OR = 0·62, 95% CI 0·50-0·78; P < 0·001), but there was no difference when COVID-19 inpatients were analysed.

PM2.5 samples were collected using mid-volume samplers during the autumn of 2017 in all six cities. The samples were analyzed to determine the ambient PM2.5 compositions, including the concentrations of water-soluble inorganic ions (WSIIs), carbonaceous aerosols, and elements concentrations. The chemical ratios of organic carbon to elemental carbon and nitrate to sulfate as well as the enrichment factors of elements were calculated to establish the possible sources of PM2.5 in all six cities. The highest PM2.5 concentration was 152 µg/m3 in SJZ, while the lowest concentration was 47 µg/m3 in HRB. During the sampling period in these six cities, the PM2.5 concentrations exceeded the World Health Organization recommended daily average air quality guidelines by 2.4-6.1 times, and WSIIs, carbonaceous aerosols, and elements accounted for 31.8%-61.6%, 9.8%-35.1%, and 0.9%-2.5% of the PM2.5, respectively. In 2013, the Chinese government formulated the Air Pollution Prevention and Control Action Plan (APPCAP) for controlling air pollution, and effective measures have been implemented since then. Compared with previous studies conducted during 2009-2013 before the implementation of the APPCAP, the concentrations of PM2.5 and most of its components decreased to varying degrees, and large changes in the chemical ratios of PM2.5 components were observed. These results indicate that PM2.5 sources vary among these six cities and that China has improved the ambient air quality in these cities through the implementation of air pollution control policies. The APPCAP have achieved considerable results in continuously reducing pollution concentrations, although the air pollution concentrations observed in this study remain high compared with those of other countries.","Wang, Qiong; Fang, Jianlong; Shi, Wanying; Dong, Xiaoyan",Environ Pollut,94,15

At what time children should be taken care of during COVID-19 emergency,18.088552,1.6848319,2020,"The COVID-19 trajectories worldwide have shown several surprising features which are outside the purview of classical epidemiological models. These include (a) almost constant and low daily case rates over extended periods of time, (b) sudden waves emerging from the above solution despite no or minimal change in the level of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI), and (c) reduction or flattening of case counts following relaxation of NPI. To explain these phenomena, we add contact tracing to our recently developed cluster seeding and transmission (CST) model. We find no fewer than four effects which make prediction of epidemic trajectories uncertain. These are (a) cryptogenic instability, where a small increase in population-averaged contact rate causes a large increase in cases, (b) critical mass effect, where a wave manifests after weeks of quiescence with no change in parameter values, (c) knife-edge effect, where a small change in parameter across a critical value causes a huge change in the response of the system, and (d) hysteresis effect, where the timing and not just the strength of a particular NPI determines the subsequent behaviour. Despite these effects however, some non-obvious conclusions regarding NPI appear to be robust. In particular, (a) narrowing the circle of ones social interactions can be as effective a measure as reducing interactions altogether, and (b) a good contact tracing program can effectively substitute for much more invasive measures. Finally, we propose the contact tracing capacity ratio - a metric of the load to which the tracers are subject - as a reliable early warning indicator of an imminent epidemic wave.","Shayak, B; Sharma, Mohit Manoj",,94,1

DESIGN: Cross-sectional surveys using a web-based questionnaire. Participants were recruited via snowball techniques. SETTING: São Paulo state, the urban epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil at the time of the study. PARTICIPANTS: 2.203 clicks to the survey link and 1.223 surveys completed (55.5% response rate). However, only 1118 surveys were considered after the exclusion criteria (>18 years-old and consent). MEASURES: Demographics, educational status, COVID-19-related symptoms (headache, cough, sore throat, rhinorrhea, fever, asthenia, diarrhea, dyspnea, nausea, vomiting, vertigo, anosmia, and ageusia), and face mask use. ANALYSIS: Self-reports of COVID-19 symptoms were categorized as dichotomous variables (Cohen's h = 0.94). Pearson Chi-square test evaluated differences between T1 and T2 and logistic multiple regression analyzed odds-ratio for the presence of symptoms and independent variables. RESULTS: Face mask use increased from 43.60% in T1 to 90.52% in T2 (P < .0001) as the pandemic went on. Health literacy also changed within 2 weeks and people started to assume everybody should use face masks (62.93% in T1 vs 94.12% in T2; P < .0001; ES = 0.29) during outside activities (43.60% in T1 vs 90.52% in T2; P < .0001; ES = 0.39). Self-reports of face mask use were associated with fewer self-reports of COVID-19 symptoms (OR = 0.65, P = .01, 95% CI 0.48; 0.88). CONCLUSION: Face mask use was already high among educated Brazilians before the formal recommendation by the authorities.

Increased Plk4 expression, which is a feature of many common human cancers, causes centriole overduplication, mitotic irregularities, and chromosomal instability. Plk4 can also promote cancer invasion and metastasis through regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. Herein we demonstrate physical interaction of Plk4 with FAM46C/TENT5C, a conserved protein of unknown function until recently. FAM46C localizes to centrioles, inhibits Plk4 kinase activity, and suppresses Plk4-induced centriole duplication. Interference with Plk4 function by FAM46C was independent of the latter's nucleotidyl transferase activity. In addition, FAM46C restrained cancer cell invasion and suppressed MDA MB-435 cancer growth in a xenograft model, opposing the effect of Plk4. We demonstrate loss of FAM46C in patient-derived colorectal cancer tumor tissue that becomes more profound with advanced clinical stage.

Wnt8B, one of canonical Wnt ligands, has been implicated in oncogenesis. However, the role of Wnt8B in human HCCs and its transcriptional regulation mechanism remain unknown presently. Here we report that Wnt8B expression was frequently increased in HCCs, and was significantly associated with poorer patient prognosis. Wnt8B knockdown suppresses HCC cell growth both in vitro and in vivo, via inhibiting canonical Wnt signaling. Transcription factor ZNF191 can positively regulate Wnt8B mRNA and proteins expression, and promoter luciferase assay indicated that ZNF191 can increase transcription activity of 2Kbps WNT8B promoter. Chromatin immunoprecipitation- qPCR and Electrophoretic mobility shift assay showed ZNF191 protein directly binds to WNT8B promoter and the binding sites are at nt-1491(ATTAATT) and nt-1178(ATTCATT). Moreover, Wnt8B contributes the effect of ZNF191 on cell proliferation, and Wnt8B expression correlates positively with ZNF191 in human HCCs. Our findings suggested that Wnt8B, directly transcriptionally regulated by ZNF191, plays a pivotal role in HCC proliferation via canonical Wnt pathway, and may serve as a new prognostic biomarker and a potential therapeutic target for HCC patients.","Liu, Yufeng; Di, Wu; Cheng, Hanghang; Chen, Lei; Zhang, Weidi; Zou, Liping; Gao, Qiongmei; Zhao, Zhonghua; Chen, Qi; Zeng, Wenjiao; Zhang, Zhigang; Jiang, Wei; Huang, Cheng; Liu, Guoyuan",Cancer sci,94,21

We conducted this study to compare the outcomes in our institution of influenza patients treated with veno-venous-ECMO (VV-ECMO) to COVID-19 patients treated with VV-ECMO, during the first wave of COVID-19. Methods: All adult patients who were placed on VV-ECMO between March 1, 2016 and September 15, 2020 (encompassing the first wave of COVID-19) were identified within an IRB-approved database, and any patient with ARDS due to COVID-19 or influenza was included in this study. The clinical characteristics and outcomes of these patients were extracted and analyzed. Results: 28 COVID-19 patients and 17 influenza patients placed on VV-ECMO were identified and included in this study. ECMO survival rates were 68% (19/28) in COVID-19 patients and 94% (16/17) in influenza patients (p=0.04). 30-day survival rates after ECMO decannulation were 54% (15/28) in COVID-19 patients and 76% (13/17) in influenza patients (p=0.13). The COVID-19 patients had lower rates of pre-ECMO acute renal injury (29% vs. 59%, p=0.045), lower rates of coronary artery disease (0% vs. 18%, p=0.021), and a lower average body surface area (2.0 vs. 2.2, p=0.036). They were more likely to have ECMO initiated at an outside hospital (50% vs. 12%, p=0.009) and spend a longer time on ECMO (21 days vs. 12 days, p=0.025). COVID-19 patients had statistically higher complication rates of new infections during ECMO (50% vs. 18%, p=0.03), bacterial pneumonia (36% vs 6%, p=0.024), and blood culture-positive sepsis (32% vs. 6%, p=0.04). Conclusions: COVID-19 patients who were treated in our institution with VV-ECMO had statistically lower ECMO survival rates than influenza patients with the same treatment. It is possible that COVID-19 immunomodulation therapies may increase the risk of other superimposed infections, as COVID-19 patients developed new infections, sepsis, and bacterial pneumonia more frequently than influenza patients. However, more research is needed to better understand the true efficacy rates of ECMO in treating both influenza and COVID-19.","Blazoski, C.

We present short-term follow-up data concerning mild to moderate disease in home-quarantined COVID-19 patients in Greece. METHODS: We provided a symptom questionnaire and instructions for a self-administered home smell-and-taste test to 79 positive COVID-19 patients from 2 tertiary hospitals in Greece. The patients recorded their subjective symptoms before and during infection as well as 4 weeks after the diagnosis. The patients also underwent the home test during infection and 4 weeks later. RESULTS: Twenty-nine patients (36.7%) reported a loss of smell, and 21 (27.8%) reported a loss of taste, with equal prevalences between genders. We observed 2 types of recovery, i.e., a rapid, almost complete recovery, and a second slower and partial recovery. The type of recovery was not age related. A rapid recovery was observed in two thirds of the patients, with their olfactory ratings presenting a trend towards significance in correlation with nasal obstruction. A slow recovery in olfaction was correlated with low intensity ratings in odors with a trigeminal compound. The loss of taste was more pronounced in sweet and salty intensity ratings.

It aims to explore the characteristics and rules of scientific communication in social media under emergency events, grasp the potential and risks of scientific communication in social media in special times and provide a perspective of academic communication for the scientific response. Design/methodology/approach: The authors select the enumeration data of the early COVID-19 theme papers spread on social media networks as the research object, apply descriptive statistical analysis to the basic statistical distribution of variables and use factor analysis and visualization methods to explore the law and characteristics of the spread of scientific papers on social media platforms. Findings: It was found that users of the COVID-19 paper are mainly in North America, Europe and South America, followed by those in East Asia, Southeast Asia and Oceania. The users are mainly public figures, doctors and other practitioners, science communicators and scientists. The process of social media communication reflects three ways of knowledge construction, social interaction and academic communication, and there are three ways of communication law and changing trend of cross transition and integration. Originality/value: This study observes the function and role of science communication in social media in a special period from a unique perspective of academic communication, so as to promote academic means to fight against the epidemic. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Li, J.; Sun, L.; Feng, X.; He, P.; Zhang, Y.",Library Hi Tech,94,21

Extra precautionary measures against COVID-19 during and after delivery are pivotal to ensure the safety of the baby and health care workers. Based on current literature, it is recommended that delivery decisions be discussed between obstetricians and neonatologists prior to delivery, and designated negative pressure delivery rooms should be arranged for COVID person under investigation (PUI). During delivery, a minimal number of experienced staff attending delivery should don personal protective equipment (PPE) and follow the neonatal resuscitation program (NRP). Positive pressure ventilation is best used in a negative pressure room if available. At-risk babies should be transported in an isolette, and tested for COVID-19 in a negative pressure room soon after bathing. Skin-to-skin contact and breast milk feed should continue under certain circumstances. Although newborns with COVID-19 infections often present with symptoms that mimic sepsis and one third of affected patients may demand some form of respiratory support, short-term prognoses are favorable and most recover within two weeks of symptoms onset. In this article, we will further elaborate on topics covering timing and mode of delivery, antenatal steroid, vertical transmission, delivery room management, airway management, transport, testing and isolation after birth, skin-to-skin contact, breast milk feeding, clinical features, outcomes, and discharge plans. In addition, we also share our experiences of encountering neonates born of suspected COVID-19 positive mothers.","Lin, Chih; Chu, Shih-Ming; Hsu, Jen-Fu; Hsu, Chin-Chieh; Chang, Yao-Lung; Lien, Reyin; Cheng, Shao-Wen; Chiang, Ming-Chou",Pediatr. neonatol,94,1

Patients with adrenal insufficiency are at an increased risk of infection, which may be complicated by developing an adrenal crisis; however, there is currently no evidence that adrenal insufficiency patients are more likely to develop a severe course of disease. We highlight the need for education (sick day rules, stringent social distancing rules), equipment (sufficient glucocorticoid supplies, steroid emergency self-injection kit) and empowerment (steroid emergency card, COVID-19 guidelines) to prevent adrenal crises. In patients with adrenal insufficiency developing an acute COVID-19 infection, which frequently presents with continuous high fever, we suggest oral stress dose cover with 20 mg hydrocortisone every 6 h. We also comment on suggested dosing for patients who usually take modified release hydrocortisone or prednisolone. In patients with adrenal insufficiency showing clinical deterioration during an acute COVID-19 infection, we advise immediate (self-)injection of 100 mg hydrocortisone intramuscularly, followed by continuous i.v. infusion of 200 mg hydrocortisone per 24 h, or until this can be established, and administration of 50 mg hydrocortisone every 6 h.

We aimed to assess the frequency of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza ARIs before and during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. METHODS: This study was a prospective, multicenter, population-based ARI surveillance, including children seen in the emergency departments and inpatient settings in 7 US cities for ARI. Respiratory samples were collected and evaluated by molecular testing. Generalized linear mixed-effects models were used to evaluate the association between community mitigation and number of eligible and proportion of RSV and influenza cases. RESULTS: Overall, 45 759 children were eligible; 25 415 were enrolled and tested; 25% and 14% were RSV-positive and influenza-positive, respectively. In 2020, we noted a decrease in eligible and enrolled ARI subjects after community mitigation measures were introduced, with no RSV or influenza detection from April 5, 2020, to April 30, 2020. Compared with 2016-2019, there was an average of 10.6 fewer eligible ARI cases per week per site and 63.9% and 45.8% lower odds of patients testing positive for RSV and influenza, respectively, during the 2020 community mitigation period. In all sites except Seattle, the proportions of positive tests for RSV and influenza in the 2020 community mitigation period were lower than predicted. CONCLUSIONS: Between March and April 2020, rapid declines in ARI cases and the proportions of RSV and influenza in children were consistently noted across 7 US cities, which could be attributable to community mitigation measures against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.","Haddadin, Zaid; Schuster, Jennifer E; Spieker, Andrew J; Rahman, Herdi; Blozinski, Anna; Stewart, Laura; Campbell, Angela P; Lively, Joana Y; Michaels, Marian G; Williams, John V; Boom, Julie A; Sahni, Leila C; Staat, Mary; McNeal, Monica; Selvarangan, Rangaraj; Harrison, Christopher J; Weinberg, Geoffrey A; Szilagyi, Peter G; Englund, Janet A; Klein, Eileen J; Curns, Aaron T; Rha, Brian; Langley, Gayle E; Hall, Aron J; Patel, Manish M; Halasa, Natasha B",Pediatrics,94,21

We identified widespread gene expression changes in CBMC from cases, including upregulation of interferon-stimulated genes and Major Histocompatibility Complex genes in CD14 + monocytes;transcriptional changes suggestive of activation of plasmacytoid dendritic cells, and activation and exhaustion of NK cells and CD8 + T-cells. Lastly, we observed fetal TCR repertoire expansion in cases. As none of the infants were infected with SARS-CoV-2, our results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 maternal infection might modulate the fetal immune system in the absence of vertical transmission.","Matute, J.; Finander, B.; Pepin, D.; Ai, X.; Smith, N.; Li, J.; Edlow, A.; Villani, A.; Lerou, P.; Kalish, B.",,94,1

DISCUSSION: Quarantine has been associated with increased rates of suicide, anger, acute stress disorder, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder, with symptoms continuing even years after quarantine ends. There are several predisposing risk factors including the inhabited environment, unique aspects of assessment as well as phenomena seen specifically among groups facing isolation together.

These networks are important, as they amplify the voices of municipal officials, who are often excluded from high-level decision-making, and can also provide a platform for officials from low- or middle-income nations to participate in higher-level political forums. The global response to the COVID-19 pandemic has included traditional public health stakeholders-including supranational organizations, international non-governmental organizations and national authorities-but has also featured mayors and city networks, in an unprecedented fashion. Existing networks without an explicit focus on health have shifted their focuses to prioritize pandemic response and several new networks have been created. These developments are significant, not only because they represent a shift in health governance and policy, but also because cities and urban networks more broadly have exhibited a nimbleness and pragmatism unmatched by higher levels of governance. These characteristics could prove beneficial for addressing the current pandemic, as well as future health issues and emergencies. Furthermore, given the relative lack of engagement with health security issues before the COVID-19 pandemic, the drastic health and economic impacts associated with it, and the demonstrable value added by strong city leadership, there are an open policy window and a compelling case for continued city engagement in health security.","Boyce, Matthew R; Katz, Rebecca",Health policy plan,94,10

Background: At the offset of Pandemic, a decrease in utilization of healthcare in medical emergencies like acute ischemic stroke and Myocardial Infarction was observed. Design/Methods: We collected stroke data from TriNetX network research platform. We analyzed number of ischemic stroke patients greater than 18 years, intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (IV tPA) administration and mechanical thrombectomy (MT) in Study group (SG) from 20 January 2020 to 16 May 2020 and compared them with two control groups (CGs): control group 1 (CG1) from 20 January 2019 to 16 May 2019 and control group 2 (CG2) from 25 September 2019 to 19 January 2020. We used Bonferroni's method to correct for multiple comparisons and alpha of 0.01 was considered significant. Results: There was 43% decrease in number of stroke patients in SG compared to CG1 and 25.5% decrease compared to CG2. In the SG, there was drop in number of IV tPA administrations 51% and 35%, and MT by 39% and 27% compared to CG1 and CG2 respectively. Likelihood of stroke patients receiving IV tPA was higher in both CGs compared to the SG (X =8.95, p=0.002 for CG1, and X =6.59, p=0.010 for CG2).

Conclusions: There was substantial drop in number of stroke patients seeking medical help in the SG, suggesting that people with strokes were not presenting to hospitals during study period, likely due to concerns contracting SARS-CoV2 in hospital. Younger patients were overrepresented in COVID-19 strokes suggesting possible increased risk of strokes due to hypercoagulable state with COVID-19.","Sharma, R.; Elkhider, H.; Sheng, S.; Veerapaneni, P.; Brown, A.; Veerapaneni, K.; Kapoor, N.; Onteddu, S.; Nalleballe, K.",Neurology,94,16

The study included 321 hospitalized patients admitted to the ICU between June 2020 and March 2021 aged [≥] 20 years, with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 via RT-PCR conducted on a nasopharyngeal swab. The patients information was gathered using graded data forms from electronic medical reports. The diagnosis of bacterial and fungal infection was proved through the patients clinical presentation and positive blood or sputum culture results. All cases had received empirical antimicrobial therapy before the ICU admission, and different regimens during the ICU stay. The rate of bacterial co-infection was 51.1%, mainly from gram-negative isolates (Enterobacter species and K.pneumoniae). The rate of fungal co-infection caused by A.fumigatus was 48.9%, and the mortality rate was 8.1%.

To combat this crisis, research communities worldwide are falling back on the existing repertoire of approved/investigational drugs to probe into their anti-coronavirus properties. In this report, we describe our unique efforts in identifying potential drugs that could be repurposed against the main protease of SARS-CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2 Mpro). To achieve this goal, we have primarily exploited the principles of 'neighbourhood behaviour' in the protein 3D (workflow-I) and chemical 2D structural space (workflow-II) coupled with docking simulations and insights into the possible modes of action of the selected candidates from the available literature. This integrative approach culminated in prioritizing 29 potential repurpose-able agents (20 approved drugs and 9 investigational molecules) against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. Apart from the approved/investigational anti-viral drugs, other notable hits include anti-bacterial, anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer and anti-coagulant drugs. Our analysis suggests that some of these drugs have the potential to simultaneously modulate the functions of viral proteins and the host response system. Interestingly, many of these identified candidates (12 molecules from workflow-I and several molecules, belonging to the chemical classes of alkaloids, tetracyclines, peptidomimetics, from workflow-II) are suggested to possess anti-viral properties, which is supported by laboratory and clinical data. Furthermore, this work opens a new avenue of research to probe into the molecular mechanism of action of many drugs, which are known to demonstrate anti-viral activity but are so far not known to target viral proteases.","Chakraborti, Sohini; Bheemireddy, Sneha; Srinivasan, Narayanaswamy",Mol Omics,94,6

Here, we characterized that porcine torovirus (PToV, family Tobaniviridae, order Nidovirales) 3CLpro autocatalytically release itself from the viral precursor protein by self-cleavage. Site-directed mutagenesis suggested that PToV 3CLpro, as a serine protease, employed His53 and Ser160 as the active-site residues. Interestingly, unlike most nidovirus 3CLpro, the P1 residue plays a less essential role in N-terminal self-cleavage of PToV 3CLpro Substituting either P1 or P4 residue of substrate alone has little discernible effect on N-terminal cleavage. Notably, replacement of the two residues together completely blocks N-terminal cleavage, suggesting that N-terminal self-cleavage of PToV 3CLpro is synergistically affected by both P1 and P4 residues. Using a cyclized luciferase-based biosensor, we systematically scanned the polyproteins for cleavage sites, and identified (FXXQ&#8595;A/S) as the main consensus sequences. Subsequent homology modeling and biochemical experiments suggested that the protease formed putative pockets S1 and S4 between the substrate. Indeed, mutants of both predicted S1 (D159A, H174A) and S4 (P62G/L185G) pockets completely lost the ability of cleavage activity of PToV 3CLpro In conclusion, the characterization of self-processing activities and substrate specificities of PToV 3CLpro will offer helpful information for the mechanism of nidovirus 3C-like proteinase's substrate specificities and the rational development of the anti-nidovirus drugs.IMPORTANCECurrently, the active-site residues and substrate specificities of 3C-like protease (3CLpro) differ among nidoviruses, and the detailed catalytic mechanism remains largely unknown. Here, porcine torovirus (PToV) 3CLpro cleaves 12 sites in the polyproteins, including its N- and C-terminal self-processing sites. Unlike coronaviruses and arteriviruses, PToV 3CLpro employed His53 and Ser160 as the active-site residues that recognize a Glutamine (Gln) at the P1 position. Surprisingly, mutations of P1-Gln impaired the C-terminal self-processing but did not affect N-terminal self-processing. The ""noncanonical"" substrate specificity for its N-terminal self-processing was attributed to the Phenylalanine (Phe) residue at the P4 position in the N-terminal site. Furthermore, a double glycine (neutral) substitution at the putative P4-Phe-binding residues (P62G/L185G) abolished the cleavage activity of PToV 3CLpro suggested the potential hydrophobic force between the PToV 3CLpro and P4-Phe side chains.","Xu, Shangen; Zhou, Junwei; Chen, Yingjin; Tong, Xue; Wang, Zixin; Guo, Jiahui; Chen, Jiyao; Fang, Liurong; Wang, Dang; Xiao, Shaobo",J. virol,94,1

This assay can be completed in two steps in a label-free fashion, yielding a ""signal-on"" signal readout, which usually cannot be attained by electrochemical label-free detection using no labels or markers to tag the target protein. The proposed assay also utilizes no antibodies or enzyme-based reagents. The method achieves this performance by moderating the frequency of electrochemical potential scanning such that the scanning rate keeps pace with, or ""resonances"" with, the molecular motion of the probe molecule. This method has been successfully applied to detect the three target proteins in serum samples collected from patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the results indicate a strong correlation with the risk of deteriorating into severe acute conditions after virus infection.

Although respiratory tract symptoms are often the initial presentation among kidney transplant recipients who contract COVID-19, other clinical features which may indicate underlying SARS-CoV-2-related inflammation, such as gastrointestinal symptoms, are not uncommon. Hyponatremia can develop and may reflect underlying inflammation. Interferon-6 is an important pro-inflammatory cytokine involved in the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19 complications and may play a role in the inappropriately higher secretion of antidiuretic hormone leading to hyponatremia. This pathway is the so-called immuno-neuroendocrine interface. Hyponatremia in COVID-19 has been reported in a few case series of non-kidney transplant patients and only one reported kidney transplant recipient. However, the clinical course and prognostic value of hyponatremia in this population are not described in detail. We report a kidney transplant recipient who was infected with COVID-19 and exhibited severe hyponatremia secondary to the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion. Hyponatremia is one of the clinical presentations of COVID-19, although less common, and may occur more frequently in kidney transplant recipients. Thus, the possible underlying immuno-neuroendocrine relationship related to the inflammatory process of COVID-19 leading to hyponatremia and its prognostic value are reviewed.","Tantisattamo, Ekamol; Reddy, Uttam G; Duong, Dang K; Ferrey, Antoney J; Ichii, Hirohito; Dafoe, Donald C; Kalantar-Zadeh, Kamyar",Transpl Infect Dis,94,1

There have been studies of patients on in-center hemodialysis, but home dialysis population data are scarce. Our objective is to study the incidence and course of COVID-19 in a home dialysis unit (HDU) at the height of the pandemic. METHODS: An observational, retrospective study enrolling all patients diagnosed with COVID-19 from the HDU of Hospital Universitario La Paz (La Paz University Hospital) (Madrid, Spain) between March 10 and May 15, 2020. We collected clinical data from the HDU (57 patients on peritoneal dialysis and 22 patients on home hemodialysis) and compared the clinical characteristics and course of patients with and without COVID-19 infection. RESULTS: Twelve patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 (9 peritoneal dialysis; 3 home hemodialysis). There were no statistically significant differences in terms of clinical characteristics between patients with COVID-19 and the rest of the unit. The mean age was 62±18.5 years; most were men (75%). All patients but one required hospitalization. Ten patients (83%) were discharged following a mean of 16.4±9.7 days of hospitalization. Two patients were diagnosed while hospitalized for other conditions, and these were the only patients who died. Those who died were older than those who survived. CONCLUSION: The incidence of COVID-19 in our HDU in Madrid at the height of the pandemic was high, especially in patients on peritoneal dialysis. No potential benefit for preventing the infection in patients on home dialysis was observed. Advanced age and nosocomial transmission were the main factors linked to a worse prognosis.","Maldonado, María; Ossorio, Marta; Del Peso, Gloria; Santos, Carlos; Álvarez, Laura; Sánchez-Villanueva, Rafael; Rivas, Begoña; Vega, Cristina; Selgas, Rafael; Bajo, María A",Nefrologia (Madrid),94,1

METHODS: We evaluated the viral dynamics in various body fluid specimens, such as nasopharyngeal swab, oropharyngeal swab, saliva, sputum, and urine specimens, of two patients with COVID-19 from hospital day 1 to 9. Additional samples of the saliva were taken at 1 hour, 2 hours, and 4 hours after using a chlorhexidine mouthwash. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) viral load was determined by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR). RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 was detected from all the five specimens of both patients by rRT-PCR. The viral load was the highest in the nasopharynx (patient 1 = 8.41 log10 copies/mL; patient 2 = 7.49 log10 copies/mL), but it was also remarkably high in the saliva (patient 1 = 6.63 log10 copies/mL; patient 2 = 7.10 log10 copies/mL). SARS-CoV-2 was detected up to hospital day 6 (illness day 9 for patient 2) from the saliva of both patients. The viral load in the saliva decreased transiently for 2 hours after using the chlorhexidine mouthwash. CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2 viral load was consistently high in the saliva; it was relatively higher than that in the oropharynx during the early stage of COVID-19.

Not only can accurate TC monitoring predict and prevent the spread of contagious illnesses at the worksite, but also can protect workers and athletes from heat-related injuries and illnesses. Although many non-invasive solutions currently exist for conducting spot-checks of TC, the accuracy of these solutions is highly variable, and is dependent upon subject characteristics and their environmental conditions. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of a new wearable device's TC algorithm in comparison to ground truth TC continuously across 24 h (n=46 male and female subjects for 65 total trials;mean age ± SD=31 ± 12 y;age range=18-62 y;mean height ± SD=172.2 ± 10.0 cm;mean weight ± SD=72.6±17.9 kg). Subjects ingested a gastrointestinal pill (e-Celsius, BodyCap Inc.) 1 h prior to the start of each trial, and then went about their normal daily routine while wearing a non-invasive wearable device around their upper arm (Kenzen Inc.). Kenzen's wearable device continuously monitors heart rate (via PPG), skin and ambient temperature, relative humidity of the skin and environment, and activity (via accelerometry);gastrointestinal temperatures were recorded every 5 min throughout the monitoring period. Subjects either completed one (n=27 subjects) or two trials (n=19 subjects for 38 trials). Based on gastrointestinal pill transit times, trial times ranged from 8.5 to 84.5 h, with a mean trial time of 34.5 h. To our knowledge, this is the largest dataset to date that has collected ground truth TC continuously throughout a 24 h monitoring period, and across two timepoints. See Table 1 for ground truth TC statistics. Overall accuracy of Kenzen vs. ground truth TC: mean absolute error (MAE) = 0.27°C, mean percent error = 0.72%, mean bias = -0.07°C, root mean squared error = 0.35°C, limits of agreement = ±0.68°C (see Fig. 1). Subjects? completing two trials had a similar TC range and circadian rhythm of TC during both trials. Resting heart rate was the single best predictor of the TC range for each subject during their trial (r = ?0.41, P=0.01). In conclusion, according to previously established accuracy criteria for TC devices (i.e. MAE ≤0.27°C;Casa et al., JAT, 2007), the Kenzen device can be used as an accurate, non-invasive measurement of continuous core body temperature, where TC ranges from 36-41°C.","Moyen, Nicole Bapat Rohit Tan Beverly Esfahani Mohammad Mundel Toby",The FASEB Journal,94,24

The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, cough, and fatigue. While most patients with COVID-19 present with mild illness, some patients develop pneumonia, an important risk factor for mortality, at early stage of viral infection, putting these patients at increased risk of death. So far, little has been known about differences in the T cell repertoires between COVID-19 patients with and without pneumonia during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Herein, we aimed to investigate T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire profiles and patient-specific SARS-CoV-2-associated TCR clusters between COVID-19 patients with mild disease (no sign of pneumonia) and pneumonia. The TCR sequencing was conducted to characterize the peripheral TCR repertoire profile and diversity. The TCR clustering and CDR3 annotation were exploited to further discover groups of patient-specific TCR clonotypes with potential SARS-CoV-2 antigen specificities. Our study indicated a slight decrease in the TCR repertoire diversity and a skewed CDR3 length usage in patients with pneumonia compared to those with mild disease. The SARS-CoV-2-associated TCR clusters enriched in patients with mild disease exhibited significantly higher TCR generation probabilities and most of which were highly shared among patients, compared with those from pneumonia patients. Importantly, using similarity network-based clustering followed by the sequence conservation analysis, we found different patterns of CDR3 sequence motifs between mild disease- and pneumonia-specific SARS-CoV-2-associated public TCR clusters. Our results showed that characteristics of overall TCR repertoire and SARS-CoV-2-associated TCR clusters/clonotypes were divergent between COVID-19 patients with mild disease and patients with pneumonia. These findings provide important insights into the correlation between the TCR repertoire and disease severity in COVID-19 patients.","Chang, Che-Mai; Feng, Po-Hao; Wu, Tsung-Hsun; Alachkar, Houda; Lee, Kang-Yun; Chang, Wei-Chiao",J Clin Immunol,94,26

It is crucial to understand the effect of social determination of health on novel COVID-19 outcomes in order to establish health justice. There is an imperative need, for policy makers at all levels, to consider socioeconomic and racial and ethnic disparities in pandemic planning. Cross-sectional analysis from COVID Boston University's Center for Antiracist Research COVID Racial Data Tracker was performed to evaluate the racial and ethnic distribution of COVID-19 outcomes relative to representation in the United States. Representation quotients (RQs) were calculated to assess for disparity using state-level data from the American Community Survey (ACS). We found that on a national level, Hispanic/Latinx, American Indian/Alaskan Native, Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islanders, and Black people had RQs > 1, indicating that these groups are over-represented in COVID-19 incidence. Dramatic racial and ethnic variances in state-level incidence and mortality RQs were also observed. This study investigates pandemic disparities and examines some factors which inform the social determination of health. These findings are key for developing effective public policy and allocating resources to effectively decrease health disparities. Protective standards, stay-at-home orders, and essential worker guidelines must be tailored to address the social determination of health in order to mitigate health injustices, as identified by COVID-19 incidence and mortality RQs.","Raine, Samuel; Liu, Amy; Mintz, Joel; Wahood, Waseem; Huntley, Kyle; Haffizulla, Farzanna",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),94,2

Mortality was 22 and 35% for CsA and control groups (p=0.02), respectively, for all patients, and 24 and 48.5% for patients with moderate to severe disease (p=0.001). Higher cumulative clinical improvement was seen for the CsA group (Nelson Aalen curve, p=0.001, log-rank test) in moderate to severe patients. The Cox proportional hazard analysis showed the highest HR improvement value of 2.15 (1.39-3.34, 95%CI, p=0.0005) for CsA treatment in moderate to severe patients, and HR = 1.95 (1.35-2.83, 95%CI, p=0.0003) for all patients.

Through an online survey, we demonstrated variable adherence to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) PPE guidelines among health care personnel (HCP). METHODS: CDC guidelines for optimal and acceptable PPE usage in common situations faced by frontline health care workers were referenced to create a short online survey. The survey was distributed to national, statewide, and local professional organizations across the United States and to HCP, using a snowball sampling technique. Responses were collected between June 15 and July 17, 2020. RESULTS: Responses totaling 2245 were received from doctors, nurses, midwives, paramedics, and medical technicians in 44 states. Eight states with n > 20 (Arizona, California, Colorado, Louisiana, Oregon, South Carolina, Texas, and Washington) and a total of 436 responses are included in the quantitative analysis. Adherence to CDC guidelines was observed to be highest in the scenario of patient contact when COVID-19 was not suspected (86.47%) and lowest when carrying out aerosol generating procedures (AGPs) (42.47%).

The disease was first described in the city of Wuhan in China, presenting as an atypical infection of the lower respiratory tract. METHODS: COVID-19 is characterized by multisystemic involvement, and mortality is attributed mainly to the respiratory system involvement, which may lead to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome and respiratory failure. Several COVID-19-associated complications are being increasingly reported, including arterial and venous thromboembolic events that may lead to amputation of the affected limbs. So far, a large number of reports have described hypercoagulability crises leading to amputation of the lower limbs. However, a search of the National Library of Medicine (MEDLINE) revealed no cases of urgent upper limb amputation in COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: This article describes a novel case of upper limb ischemia in a COVID-19 patient, with rapid progression to hand necrosis, requiring urgent through-arm amputation of the upper limb. CONCLUSIONS: This case emphasizes the need for anticoagulant therapy in COVID-19 patients and to maintain a constant awareness of the possible thromboembolic COVID-19-related sequelae.","Makhoul, Kamal; Shukha, Yousef; Hanna, Lana Abu; Nitecki, Samy; Leiderman, Maxim; Hayek, Tony; Hamoud, Shadi",Int J Infect Dis,94,1

Consequently, other promising options have emerged, such as the antimicrobial photodynamic inactivation therapy (aPDI) based in photosensitizer (PS) compounds to produce light-activated local oxidative stress (photooxidative stress). However, there are scarce studies regarding the mode of action of PSs compound to induce photooxidative stress on pathogenic Î³-proteobacteria such as MDR-Klebsiella pneumoniae. METHODOLOGY: The mode of action exerted by the cationic Ir(III)-based PS (PSIR-3) to inhibit the growth of K. pneumoniae was analyzed. RT-qPCR determined the transcriptional response induced by PSIR-3 on bacteria treated with aPDI. The expression levels of genes associated with a bacterial oxidative response, such as oxyR and sodA, and the extracytoplasmic, regulators rpoE and hfq were determined. Also, were determined the transcriptional response of the extracytoplasmic factors mrkD, acrB, magA, and rmpA. RESULTS: At 17 µW/cm2 photon flux and 4 µg/mL of the PSIR-3 compound, the K. pneumoniae growth was inhibited in 3 log10. Compared with untreated bacteria, the transcriptional response induced by PSIR-3 occurs via the extracytoplasmic sigma factor rpoE and hfq. In contrast, no participation in the oxyR pathway or induction of the sodA gene was observed. This response was accompanied by the upregulation of the extracytoplasmic virulence factors mrkD, magA, and rmpA. CONCLUSIONS: APDI produced by PSIR-3 kills K. pneumoniae and may induce damage to the bacterial envelope that the bacterium tries to avoid by activation of extracytoplasmic factors mediated through the rpoE regulon.","Bustamante, Vanessa; González, Iván A; Dreyse, Paulina; Palavecino, Christian Erick",Photodiagnosis Photodyn Ther,94,10
428377,428377,428377,Communicable disease outbreaks: Surveillance and infrastructure,18.36516,1.6505964,2021,"BACKGROUND: Parental involvement in mobile health (mHealth) to consult with medical professionals appears to be prevalent in China with the rapid development of the internet. More parents with busy jobs have chosen to use mHealth. During the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak, mHealth can assist with health promotion, directions for medication use, and disease diagnosis via online chat and video consultation without contacting others. To our knowledge, no studies have been performed to explore the role of mHealth in parents' attitudes toward child health care at home during the COVID-19 outbreak. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to identify the associated factors of willingness to adopt mHealth among Chinese parents during the COVID-19 outbreak and to explore the correlation between the frequency of adopting mHealth and parents' attitudes toward child health care at home. METHODS: Chinese parents were asked to complete an online survey from January 25 to February 15, 2020. The questionnaire comprised of two parts with a total of 16 items, including parents' demographic variables and attitudes toward child health care at home. By multivariate logistic regression, we explored factors associated with parents' willingness to adopt mHealth during the COVID-19 outbreak. Pearson chi-square tests were used to reveal the correlation between the frequency of adopting mHealth and parents' attitudes toward child health care at home. RESULTS: A total of 254 parents enrolled, and 202 (79.5%) parents were willing to adopt mHealth during the COVID-19 outbreak. Parents' age (26-35 years: adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 8.114, 95% CI 1.471-44.764), parents' interest in the COVID-19 pandemic (moderate: AOR 8.753, 95% CI 2.009-38.127; high: AOR 22.194, 95% CI 5.509-89.411), the source that recommended mHealth (medical health providers: AOR 4.257, 95% CI 1.439-12.596), the presence of chronic disease in their children (yes: AOR 20.844, 95% CI 4.600-94.443), parents' duration of daily internet use (4-6 hours: AOR 6.487, 95% CI 1.870-22.495; >6 hours: AOR 8.766, 95% CI 1.883-40.804), and adoption of mHealth before the COVID-19 outbreak (yes: AOR 3.413, 95% CI 1.234-9.444) were significantly correlated with the parents' willingness to adopt mHealth during the COVID-19 outbreak. The frequency of mHealth use among parents was correlated with their behaviors in regard to handwashing (&#967;26=18.967, P=.004), mask wearing (&#967;26=45.364, P<.001), frequency of leaving the home (&#967;26=16.767, P=.01), room disinfection and ventilation (&#967;26=19.515, P=.003), temperature checking (&#967;26=17.47, P=.007), and mental health care of children (&#967;26=63.810, P<.001) during the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: We found various objective factors that were associated with parents' willingness to adopt mHealth during the COVID-19 outbreak. Overall, parents' willingness to adopt mHealth was high. The frequency of mHealth use among parents was correlated with their attitudes toward child health care at home. The option of mHealth to patients at home during the COVID-19 outbreak would be beneficial for education and improvement in self-management of child health care at home.","Yang, Siyu; Chen, Yijing; Zhou, Leshan; Huang, Yuting; Dai, Jiahui",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,94,16

As machine learning methods become more common in health care settings, it is important to ensure that these methods do not contribute to racial disparities through biased predictions or differential accuracy across racial groups. OBJECTIVE: The goal of the research was to assess a machine learning algorithm intentionally developed to minimize bias in in-hospital mortality predictions between white and nonwhite patient groups. METHODS: Bias was minimized through preprocessing of algorithm training data. We performed a retrospective analysis of electronic health record data from patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) at a large academic health center between 2001 and 2012, drawing data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-III database. Patients were included if they had at least 10 hours of available measurements after ICU admission, had at least one of every measurement used for model prediction, and had recorded race/ethnicity data. Bias was assessed through the equal opportunity difference. Model performance in terms of bias and accuracy was compared with the Modified Early Warning Score (MEWS), the Simplified Acute Physiology Score II (SAPS II), and the Acute Physiologic Assessment and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE). RESULTS: The machine learning algorithm was found to be more accurate than all comparators, with a higher sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic. The machine learning algorithm was found to be unbiased (equal opportunity difference 0.016, P=.20). APACHE was also found to be unbiased (equal opportunity difference 0.019, P=.11), while SAPS II and MEWS were found to have significant bias (equal opportunity difference 0.038, P=.006 and equal opportunity difference 0.074, P<.001, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates there may be significant racial bias in commonly used severity scoring systems and that machine learning algorithms may reduce bias while improving on the accuracy of these methods.","Allen, Angier; Mataraso, Samson; Siefkas, Anna; Burdick, Hoyt; Braden, Gregory; Dellinger, R Phillip; McCoy, Andrea; Pellegrini, Emily; Hoffman, Jana; Green-Saxena, Abigail; Barnes, Gina; Calvert, Jacob; Das, Ritankar",JMIR Public Health Surveill,94,1

Pupils' right to education, as one of their basic rights, was enabled by the Government of the Republic of Croatia's decision to organise distance learning. The part of the system which encountered most challenges during transitioning to online education was in classes first to fourth due to the pupils, because of chronological age and digital and computer literacy level, requiring parents' assistance in order to successfully accomplish educational outcomes. The involvement of parents, who because of child's impossibility to independently carry out duties, have taken on a role of a substitute teacher overnight which consequentially resulted in their overload. The key element in distance learning is independence of pupils which is questionable in the chosen segment of the educational system. In addition to independence of pupils, this paper distinguishes two other important factors: pupils' spatial-material-technical learning conditions necessary to undertake distance learning and cooperative relationship between parents (as substitute teachers) and ""real"" teachers which takes on a new dimension in the newly emerged situation. The empirical research's goal was an inquiry into parents' attitudes and experiences in three categories (independence of pupils, spatial-material-technical conditions and teachers' requirements). Research results show the existence of difference in parents' attitudes considering their structural characteristics (age, sex, educational status). Furthermore, research participants show mostly positive feedback information in relation to general attributes of distance learning, and results confirm the existence of differences in attitudes in questioned categories. Based on research results we can conclude that distance learning asks of parents, whose children are pupils of classes first to fourth, for a new level of investment for which they require pedagogical support and guidance.","Kolak, Ante Markic Ivan Horvat Zoran Klemencic Marta Stojanac Mara",Turkish Online Journal of Educational Technology - TOJET,94,1

Unfortunately, these measures have caused physical, economical and mental health problems. Children and adolescents are not immune to the adverse mental health effect due to the new changes. Research around the globe shows children and adolescents are suffering from an increased number of depressive symptoms, clinginess, inattention, irritability and worry. This cross-sectional online-based survey type study was aimed to get a snapshot of the prevalence of predictive psychiatric disorders in the child and adolescent population in Bangladesh before and during lockdown. Validated Bangla parent version of Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire was used to assess the psychopathology among subjects. Total sample was 552 aged from 4-17 years. Boy-girl ratio was 1.3:1. Prevalence of any predictive psychiatric disorder before lockdown was 20.5 % and within lockdown was 39.7 % and the difference was highly significant (P < 0.001). Prevalence of emotional, conduct disorder and hyperactivity were also increased significantly during the lockdown period than before. Conduct disorder and hyperactivity were more prevalent among boys both before and within lockdown. In contrast, prevalence of emotional disorder was higher among girls before lockdown but within the lockdown period, the boy-girl prevalence was almost the same. This study shows the new extreme measures to tackle COVID-19 has a disaster impact on mental health of children and adolescents.

For example, harmonious passion increases commitment at work but stress reduces sustainability and leads to burnouts. When more and more employees work remotely, these emotional and mental health signals of workers become harder to observe through daily, face-to-face communications. The use of online platforms to communicate and collaborate at work provides an alternative channel to monitor the emotions of workers. This paper studies how emojis, as non-verbal cues in online communications, can be used for such purposes. In particular, we study how the developers on GitHub use emojis in their work-related activities. We show that developers have diverse patterns of emoji usage, which highly correlate to their working status including activity levels, types of work, types of communications, time management, and other behavioral patterns. Developers who use emojis in their posts are significantly less likely to dropout from the online work platform. Surprisingly, solely using emoji usage as features, standard machine learning models can predict future dropouts of developers at a satisfactory accuracy.","Lu, Xuan; Ai, Wei; Chen, Zhenpeng; Cao, Yanbin; Liu, Xuanzhe; Mei, Qiaozhu",,94,16

We conducted anatomical and pathological analyses to elucidate the possible reasons for the distribution, morphology, and characteristics of COVID-19 in chest CT. We also shared a semiquantitative scoring of affected lung segments, which was recommended by our local medical association. This scoring system was applied to quantify the severity of the disease. The most frequent imaging findings of COVID-19 were subpleural ground glass opacities and consolidation; there was a significant difference in semiquantitative scores between the early, progressive, and severe stages of the disease. We conclude that the chest CT findings of COVID-19 showed certain characteristics because of the anatomical features of the human body and pathological changes caused by the virus. Therefore, chest CT is a valuable tool for facilitating the diagnosis of COVID-19 and semiquantitative scoring of affected lung segments may further elucidate diagnosis and assessment of disease severity. This will assist healthcare workers in diagnosing COVID-19 and assessing disease severity, facilitate the selection of appropriate treatment options, which is important for reducing the spread of the virus, saving lives, and controlling the pandemic.","Zhang, Hao; Jiang, Xu-Jing; Liu, Xiao-Hua; Ma, Hong; Zhang, Ya-Hong; Rao, Yue; Li, Lin; Xu, Hai-Yan; Lyu, Fa-Jin",PLoS One,94,24

There is a paucity of studies reporting the perception of medical teachers toward teaching using teleconferencing platforms. The objective of this survey was to evaluate the perception of medical teachers toward teaching using videoconferencing platforms such as Zoom meet, Google meet, and Google classroom during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our hypothesis was teaching faculty would have a positive perception and experience toward web-based teaching modalities. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medical teachers of a medical college were invited to participate in a prospective observational cross-sectional online survey. The faculty demographic information, perception, experience, and satisfaction were noted. Perception data were presented as proportion and percentage. RESULTS: 104 out of 160 faculty members participated in the study (response rate = 65%). 61 male (58.7%) and 43 female (41.3%) faculty members participated in the study. The mean age of the faculty members was 39.3 years +/- 13 (range: 27-69 years). Laptop (n = 73 [70.2%]) was the most commonly used electronic device by the faculty members for conducting e-teaching sessions followed by smartphone (n = 25 [24%]). Google meet was the most preferred videoconference tool for online teaching. Ninety-six faculties (92.2%) were satisfied with the e-teaching method adopted by the institute. Eighty-three faculty (79.8%) perceived the e-teaching method to be very useful and quite useful as a modality for teaching during the lockdown period.

The aim of the study was to explore perceptions on usability and relevance of the app in order to maximise user engagement and sustainability. Using the theory- and evidence-informed person-based approach, initial planning included a scoping review of qualitative evidence to identify barriers and facilitators to use of digital interventions in people with cardiovascular conditions and two focus groups exploring experiences and support needs of people (N = 32) with a history of TIA or minor stroke. The scoping review and focus group data were analysed thematically and findings were used to produce guiding principles, a behavioural analysis and explanatory logic model for the intervention. Optimisation included an additional focus group (N = 12) and individual think-aloud interviews (N = 8) to explore perspectives on content and usability of a prototype app. Overall, thematic analysis highlighted uncertainty about increasing physical activity and concerns that fatigue might limit participation. Realistic goals and progressive increases in activity were seen as important to improving self-confidence and personal control. The app was seen as a useful and flexible resource. Participant feedback from the optimisation phase was used to make modifications to the app to maximise engagement, including simplification of the goal setting and daily data entry sections. Further studies are required to examine efficacy and cost-effectiveness of this novel digital intervention.","Heron, Neil; O039,; Connor, Seán R; Kee, Frank; Thompson, David R; Anderson, Neil; Cutting, David; Cupples, Margaret E; Donnelly, Michael",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),94,0

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Since July 2020 and promoted by the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented the use of DSCT after cerebrovascular CT angiography (CTA) among patients with AIS using a dual-layer spectral CT. We explored the presence of CE sources, as well as late myocardium iodine enhancement (LIE) and pulmonary thromboembolism. Among patients further undergoing transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) or cardiac CTA, we explored the diagnostic performance. RESULTS: Fifty consecutive patients with AIS who underwent DSCT after cerebrovascular CTA comprised the patient population. The confidence degree for excluding cardiac thrombi was significantly higher than for LIE (4.4±0.8 vs. 3.4±1.3, p<0.0001). DSCT identified a CE source in 4 (8%) and LIE in 24 (48%) patients. The iodine ratio of CE sources was significantly lower compared to the left atrial appendage of patients with no CE sources (0.25±0.1 mg/mL vs. 0.91±0.2 mg/mL, p<0.0001). TEE/cardiac CT, performed in 20 (40%) patients, identified a CE source in 5 (25%) cases, whereas DSCT identified 4 (20%), leading to a sensitivity and specificity of 80% (95% CI 28-99%) and 100% (95% CI 78-100%) respectively (kappa 0.86).

Existing surveillance provides a proxy of the COVID-19 caseload and mortalities;however, these measures make it difficult to identify the dynamics of the pandemic and places where outbreaks are likely to occur. Moreover, existing surveillance techniques have failed to measure the dynamics of the pandemic. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to provide additional surveillance metrics for COVID-19 transmission to track changes in the speed, acceleration, jerk, and persistence in the transmission of the pandemic more accurately than existing metrics. METHODS: Through a longitudinal trend analysis, we extracted COVID-19 data over 45 days from public health registries. We used an empirical difference equation to monitor the daily number of cases in the LAC as a function of the prior number of cases, the level of testing, and weekly shift variables based on a dynamic panel model that was estimated using the generalized method of moments approach by implementing the Arellano-Bond estimator in R. COVID-19 transmission rates were tracked for the LAC between September 30 and October 6, 2020, and between October 7 and 13, 2020. RESULTS: The LAC saw a reduction in the speed, acceleration, and jerk for the week of October 13, 2020, compared to the week of October 6, 2020, accompanied by reductions in new cases and the 7-day moving average. For the week of October 6, 2020, Belize reported the highest acceleration and jerk, at 1.7 and 1.8, respectively, which is particularly concerning, given its high mortality rate. The Bahamas also had a high acceleration at 1.5. In total, 11 countries had a positive acceleration during the week of October 6, 2020, whereas only 6 countries had a positive acceleration for the week of October 13, 2020. The TAC displayed an overall positive trend, with a speed of 10.40, acceleration of 0.27, and jerk of -0.31, all of which decreased in the subsequent week to 9.04, -0.81, and -0.03, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Metrics such as new cases, cumulative cases, deaths, and 7-day moving averages provide a static view of the pandemic but fail to identify where and the speed at which SARS-CoV-2 infects new individuals, the rate of acceleration or deceleration of the pandemic, and weekly comparison of the rate of acceleration of the pandemic indicate impending explosive growth or control of the pandemic. Enhanced surveillance will inform policymakers and leaders in the LAC about COVID-19 outbreaks.","Post, L.; Ohiomoba, R. O.; Maras, A.; Watts, S. J.; Moss, C. B.; Murphy, R. L.; Ison, M.

However, benchmarks do not exist to claim if a new AI/ML technique is better than the existing ones. The""covid-forecast-hub""is a collection of more than 30 teams, including us, that submit their forecasts weekly to the CDC. It is not possible to declare whether one method is better than the other using those forecasts because each team's submission may correspond to different techniques over the period and involve human interventions as the teams are continuously changing/tuning their approach. Such forecasts may be considered""human-expert""forecasts and do not qualify as AI/ML approaches, although they can be used as an indicator of human expert performance. We are interested in supporting AI/ML research in epidemic forecasting which can lead to scalable forecasting without human intervention. Which modeling technique, learning strategy, and data pre-processing technique work well for epidemic forecasting is still an open problem. To help advance the state-of-the-art AI/ML applied to epidemiology, a benchmark with a collection of performance points is needed and the current""state-of-the-art""techniques need to be identified. We propose EpiBench a platform consisting of community-driven benchmarks for AI/ML applied to epidemic forecasting to standardize the challenge with a uniform evaluation protocol. In this paper, we introduce a prototype of EpiBench which is currently running and accepting submissions for the task of forecasting COVID-19 cases and deaths in the US states and We demonstrate that we can utilize the prototype to develop an ensemble relying on fully automated epidemic forecasts (no human intervention) that reaches human-expert level ensemble currently being used by the CDC.","Srivastava, Ajitesh; Xu, Tianjian; Prasanna, Viktor K.",,94,1

It is important to assess how different patient groups respond to stress related to the pandemic, and what additional factors influence it, including family-related stress, migration background, and sex. We conducted a survey in a sample of 294 psychiatric patients in a large outpatient clinic in Berlin, measuring level of distress in relation to COVID-19 lockdown as well as family-related distress. We also measured potential influencing factors such as media consumption and medical support. In the migration background group, we found that women had more lockdown related psychological distress than men. This was not apparent in those patients with a German background. We found that females were more strongly affected by family-related distress, particularly those with a migration background. People with PTSD were most strongly affected by family-related distress, whereas people with psychotic disorders and addiction reported the least distress. There were no effects of media consumption. There were no differences in ability to abide by the lockdown related restrictions across diagnoses. Our results support earlier findings on differential vulnerability of diagnostic groups to these stressors. Thus, clinicians can optimize treatment by taking family-related stressors into account particularly for females and people with a migrant background.","Moran, J.

This study aimed to assess circulating levels of inflammatory cytokines in adult patients who were hospitalized with COVID-19 and stratified according to age (older or younger than 65 years) aiming to explore associations between these markers of inflammation and comorbidities. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study of 142 COVID-19 patients consecutively admitted to the University Hospital of the Federal University of São Carlos, from July to October 2020. Sociodemographic data, chronic comorbidities, and baseline NEWS2 and SOFA for clinical deterioration were obtained at hospital admission. Serum levels of inflammatory cytokines were determined by flow cytometry. RESULTS: Older adults with COVID-19 had higher serum levels of IL-6 and IL-10 as compared to those under 65 years of age (p < 0.001 and p = 0.003, respectively). IL-10 was independently associated with age (p = 0.04) and severity of the disease (p = 0.05), whereas serum levels of IL-6 were not directly associated with age (p = 0.5). The comorbidity index seems to be the main responsible for this, being significantly associated with IL-6 levels among those aged 65 and over (p = 0.007), in addition to the severity of the disease. CONCLUSIONS: Higher serum levels of IL-6 and IL-10 are associated with the severity of the disease and a higher comorbidity index among adults aged 65 and over with COVID-19. This should raise awareness of the importance of comorbidity index, rather than age, during risk stratification.","Luporini, Rafael Luís; Rodolpho, Joice M de A; Kubota, Lauro Tatsuo; Martin, Ana Carolina Baptista Moreno; Cominetti, Marcia R; Anibal, Fernanda de Freitas; Pott-Junior, Henrique",Cytokine,94,13

Using a survey targeted at children under 17 years of age, we described dietary (adherence to Mediterranean diet, AMD) and sleeping habits (disorders of initiating and maintaining sleep) after the implementation of lockdown, and examined the probability of the inadequate frequency of physical activity (PA) and use of TV and electronic devices (TV-ED) before and after lockdown through generalized estimating equation models, accounting for age and gender differences. From 3464 children included, 53.2% showed optimal AMD; 79.2% referred to delayed bedtime; and 16.3% were suspected of sleeping disorders after the implementation of lockdown. Delay in bedtime was more frequent among children older than 6 years, and inadequate sleeping hours among those younger than 11 years. There were no gender differences in AMD or sleeping habits. The odds of inadequate frequency of PA and TV-ED use were greater after lockdown, with a greater risk for TV-ED use. Boys were at greater risk of inadequate PA frequency and TV-ED use. Odds ratio of inadequate PA was greater at older ages. Lockdown could influence changes in children's habits that could lead to risk factors for non-communicable diseases during adulthood if such behaviors are sustained over time.","Ventura, Paula Sol; Ortigoza, Ana F; Castillo, Yanira; Bosch, Zelmira; Casals, Sara; Girbau, Cristina; Siurana, Jose M; Arce, Amalia; Torres, Marisa; Herrero, Francisco J",Nutrients,94,20

Unfortunately, few data for regions are available. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to describe the characteristics and independent risk factors associated with COVID-19 mortality in Castilla-La Mancha, Spain. METHODS: Cohort and multicenter study in all 14 public hospitals of the Castilla-La Mancha Health Service. Baseline characteristics, preexisting comorbidities, symptoms, clinical features and treatments were included. Multivariable logistic regression was used to evaluate factors associated with death and Kaplan-Meier test to examine survival probability. Statistical significance was considered with p<0.05 (95% CI). SPSS (version 24.0 for Windows) and R 4.0.2 (R Statistics) software were used. RESULTS: The cohort comprised 12,126 patients sequentially attended between February 11 and May 11, 2020. The mean age of patients was 66.4 years; 5667 (46.7%) were women. Six protective factors against exitus were defined: female sex, anosmia, cough, chloroquine and azithromycin. The risk factors were: age over 50, obesity, cardiac pathology, fever, dyspnea, lung infiltrates, lymphopenia, D-dimer above 1000ng/mL, and mechanical ventilation requirement. Survival analysis showed higher survival rate in women (75.7%) than men (72.1%). Cumulative survival was 87.5% for non-hospitalized patients, 70.2% for patients admitted to hospital and 61.2% in ICU patients. Additionally, survival probability decreased with increasing age range.

There is now extensive literature on its presentation and initial management. There is no literature however on what happens to these patients following discharge. MethodsWe collected clinical data and samples from seven patients presenting with VITT and followed them up for 82-145 days. We also collected clinical samples from them at last follow-up. Testing for anti-PF4/heparin antibodies was done using an anti-PF4/heparin enzymatic immunoassay. Flow Cytometry was used to look at Fc{gamma}RIIa levels on patient platelets. Light Transmission Aggregometry with patient serum and healthy donor / patient platelets was used to analyse platelet responsiveness, in the presence and absence of PF4. FindingsAll patients were discharged on direct oral anticoagulants. Two patients remain completely symptom free, three have ongoing headaches, two have residual neurological deficits. Two patients developed mild thrombocytopenia and worsening headache (but without cerebral venous sinus thrombosis) and were retreated, one of these with rituximab. All patients, except the one treated with rituximab, had similar anti-PF4 antibody titres at 80-120 days to their levels at diagnosis. Platelets from patients at follow-up had normal levels of Fc{gamma}RIIa and had normal responses to thrombin and collagen-related-peptide. Patient serum from diagnosis strongly activated healthy donor platelets in the presence of PF4. Serum from follow-up was much weaker at stimulating platelets, even in the presence of PF4. InterpretationThis study shows that despite similar PF4 antibody titres at diagnosis and during follow-up, there are further differences in patient serum, that are not apparent from currently used testing, that result in lower levels of platelet activation during the follow-up period. Further understanding of these factors are important in order to assess duration of anticoagulation for these patients.

METHODS: EMBASE, MEDLINE, Cochrane library, pre-print servers, clinical trial registries, and relevant grey literature sources were searched until July 31, 2020, using database searching and an automated method called Continuous Active Learning® (CAL®). All search results were processed using CAL® to identify the most likely relevant citations that were then screened by a single human reviewer. Full-text screening, data abstraction, and quality appraisal were completed by a single reviewer and verified by a second. RESULTS: Nine clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) were included. The most common recommendation in the CPGs was establishing surveillance and monitoring systems followed by mandating the use of PPE; physically distancing or cohorting residents; environmental cleaning and disinfection; promoting hand and respiratory hygiene among residents, staff, and visitors; and providing sick leave compensation for staff. CONCLUSIONS: Current evidence suggests robust surveillance and monitoring along with support for IPAC initiatives are key to preventing the spread of COVID-19 in LTCF.

METHODS: We did a secondary analysis of a web-based cohort, initially set up to study home and leisure injuries, in order to measure the consequences of the national lockdown implemented in France from 17 March 2020 to 11 May 2020, and to assess potential vulnerability and resilience factors. Eligible participants were invited to answer an online questionnaire designed to assess their living conditions and health during lockdown. Comparisons were done with answers provided 4.8 years earlier on average. RESULTS: On 15th April 2020, we sent email invitations to 9598 participants recruited between November 2014 and December 2019 and 1237 volunteers took part in the study by completing the online questionnaire. The proportion of those with anxiety symptoms markedly increased from 17.3 to 20.1%. The average self-rated level of mental health decreased from 7.77 to 7.58. Women, the elderly and the youngest appeared to be more vulnerable. A small living space (less than 30 m2) was associated with an increase in depression symptoms (PHQ-9 score), and poorer self-rated physical health at recruitment was associated with an increase in anxiety symptoms (GAD-7 score). On the contrary, the average self-rated level of physical health markedly increased from 7.44 to 7.94 between recruitment and lockdown, and the proportion of those who reported a level of 9 or 10 jumped from 25.7% at recruitment to 43.1% during lockdown. CONCLUSIONS: Mental health deteriorated during lockdown in France during the 2020 COVID-19 crisis. Overall, self-rated physical health improved but those who experienced a worse physical health were more likely to report anxiety symptoms.","Ramiz, Leila; Contrand, Benjamin; Rojas Castro, Madelyn Yiseth; Dupuy, Marion; Lu, Li; Sztal-Kutas, Catherine; Lagarde, Emmanuel",Global Health,94,16

After projecting COVID-19 hospitalizations, a Hospital Energy Model and Infection De-escalation Models quantified increases in energy demand and reductions in infections. The NP intervention was applied to 11, 22, and 44 rooms for small, medium, and large hospitals, while the XP-UV equipment was used eight, nine, and ten hours a day. For small, medium, and large hospitals, the annum kWh for NP rooms were 116,700 kWh, 332,530 kWh, 795,675 kWh, which correspond to annum energy costs of $11,845 ($1,077/room), $33,752 ($1,534/room), and $80,761 ($1,836/room). For XP-UV, the annum-kilowatt-hours (and costs) were 438 ($45), 493 ($50), and 548 ($56) for small, medium, and large hospitals. While energy efficiencies may be expected for the large hospital, the hospital contained more energy-intensive use rooms (ICUs) which resulted in higher operational and energy costs. XP-UV had a greater reduction in secondary COVID-19 infections in large and medium hospitals. NP rooms had a greater reduction in secondary SARS-CoV-2 transmission in small hospitals. Early implementation of interventions can result in realized cost savings through reduced hospital-acquired infections.","Squire, Marietta M; Munsamy, Megashnee; Lin, Gary; Telukdarie, Arnesh; Igusa, Takeru",Energy Build,94,16

Currently, there are no targeted therapeutic agents for the treatment of this disease, and effective treatment options remain very limited. Here we describe the results of a programme that aimed to rapidly discover lead compounds for clinical use, by combining structure-assisted drug design, virtual drug screening and high-throughput screening. This programme focused on identifying drug leads that target main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2: Mpro is a key enzyme of coronaviruses and has a pivotal role in mediating viral replication and transcription, making it an attractive drug target for SARS-CoV-25,6. We identified a mechanism-based inhibitor (N3) by computer-aided drug design, and then determined the crystal structure of Mpro of SARS-CoV-2 in complex with this compound. Through a combination of structure-based virtual and high-throughput screening, we assayed more than 10,000 compounds-including approved drugs, drug candidates in clinical trials and other pharmacologically active compounds-as inhibitors of Mpro. Six of these compounds inhibited Mpro, showing half-maximal inhibitory concentration values that ranged from 0.67 to 21.4 µM. One of these compounds (ebselen) also exhibited promising antiviral activity in cell-based assays. Our results demonstrate the efficacy of our screening strategy, which can lead to the rapid discovery of drug leads with clinical potential in response to new infectious diseases for which no specific drugs or vaccines are available.","Jin, Zhenming; Du, Xiaoyu; Xu, Yechun; Deng, Yongqiang; Liu, Meiqin; Zhao, Yao; Zhang, Bing; Li, Xiaofeng; Zhang, Leike; Peng, Chao; Duan, Yinkai; Yu, Jing; Wang, Lin; Yang, Kailin; Liu, Fengjiang; Jiang, Rendi; Yang, Xinglou; You, Tian; Liu, Xiaoce; Yang, Xiuna; Bai, Fang; Liu, Hong; Liu, Xiang; Guddat, Luke W; Xu, Wenqing; Xiao, Gengfu; Qin, Chengfeng; Shi, Zhengli; Jiang, Hualiang; Rao, Zihe; Yang, Haitao",Nature,94,1

Recent COVID-19-specific enhanced Traffic Control Bundling (eTCB) recommendations provide a cogent framework for managing patient care pathways and reducing health care worker (HCW) and patient exposure to SARS-CoV-2. eTCB has been applied broadly and has proven to be effective in limiting fomite and droplet transmissions in hospitals and between hospitals and the surrounding community. At the same time, resource constrained conditions involving limited personal protective equipment (PPE), low testing availability, and variability in physical space can require modifications in the way hospitals implement eTCB. While eTCB has come to be viewed as a standard of practice, COVID-19 related resource constraints often require hospital implementation teams to customize eTCB solutions. We provide and describe a cross-functional, collaborative on-the-ground adaptive application of eTCB initially piloted at two hospitals and subsequently reproduced at 16 additional hospitals and health systems in the US to date. By effectively facilitating eTCB deployment, hospital leaders and practitioners can establish clearer 'zones of risk' and related protective practices that prevent transmission to HCWs and patients. We outline key insights and recommendations gained from recent implementation under the aforementioned constraints and a cross-functional team process that can be utilized by hospitals to most effectively adapt eTCB under resource constraints.","De Georgeo, Michael R; De Georgeo, Julia M; Egan, Toby M; Klee, Kristi P; Schwemm, Michael S; Bye-Kollbaum, Heather; Kinser, Andrew J",J. microbiol. immunol. infect,94,18

Previously described LUS manifestations for COVID-19 include B-lines, consolidations, and pleural thickening. The interrater reliability (IRR) of these findings for COVID-19 is unknown. METHODS: This study was conducted between March and June 2020. Nine physicians (hospitalists: n = 4; emergency medicine: n = 5) from 3 medical centers independently evaluated n = 20 LUS scans (n = 180 independent observations) collected from patients with COVID-19, diagnosed via RT-PCR. These studies were randomly selected from an image database consisting of COVID-19 patients evaluated in the emergency department with portable ultrasound devices. Physicians were blinded to any patient information or previous LUS interpretation. Kappa values (&#954;) were used to calculate IRR. RESULTS: There was substantial IRR on the following items: normal LUS scan (&#954; = 0.79 [95% CI: 0.72-0.87]), presence of B-lines (&#954; = 0.79 [95% CI: 0.72-0.87]), &#8805;3 B-lines observed (&#954; = 0.72 [95% CI: 0.64-0.79]). Moderate IRR was observed for the presence of any consolidation (&#954; = 0.57 [95% CI: 0.50-0.64]), subpleural consolidation (&#954; = 0.49 [95% CI: 0.42-0.56]), and presence of effusion (&#954; = 0.49 [95% CI: 0.41-0.56]). Fair IRR was observed for pleural thickening (&#954; = 0.23 [95% CI: 0.15-0.30]). DISCUSSION: Many LUS manifestations for COVID-19 appear to have moderate to substantial IRR across providers from multiple specialties utilizing differing portable devices. The most reliable LUS findings with COVID-19 may include the presence/count of B-lines or determining if a scan is normal. Clinical protocols for LUS with COVID-19 may require additional observers for the confirmation of less reliable findings such as consolidations.","Kumar, Andre; Weng, Yingjie; Graglia, Sally; Chung, Sukyung; Duanmu, Youyou; Lalani, Farhan; Gandhi, Kavita; Lobo, Viveta; Jensen, Trevor; Nahn, Jeffrey; Kugler, John",J. ultrasound med,94,33

At the time of writing this article, more than 17,500 elderly people that lived in Care Homes have died due to coronavirus, more than 66% of the deaths. The infection and mortality rates in the institutionalised population are high. This is due to the advanced age, immune system deficit, and the presence of comorbidities, as well as because there are frail, because they live with other residents and carers in a closed institution, and transmission is easy in the context of a highly contagious and virulent virus. The elderly often have more severe forms of the disease. Atypical presentations are more frequent in the elderly and can delay the diagnosis. The Polymer Chain Reaction (PCR) test in the first 7 days for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA is considered the test of reference ('Gold standard'). The criteria for referring to a hospital site from Care Homes should take into account an assessment of comorbidity, the severity, the presence of severe cognitive impairment, and the dependency or necessity of ventilatory support in seriously ill patients.

A SPN is defined as a single lung opacity of less than 3cm in size. They present a diagnostic dilemma as differentials are broad and range from benign to malignant. Here, we present a case of a SPN in an patient with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Case Description: A 33 year-old female with history of recreational marijuana use presented to the hospital with right-sided flank pain, dysuria, fevers, and nausea for four days. Upon presentation, she was afebrile with stable vital signs and SpO2 97% on ambient air. Physical exam was remarkable only for flank and suprapubic tenderness. A diagnosis of pyelonephritis was made and confirmed with CT of the abdomen which also detected a left lower lobe subpleural nodular consolidation. Follow-up chest CT better characterized the lesion as a 2.2 x 1.2 cm ground glass opacity (GGO) in the posterior left lower lobe without effusion, pneumothorax, or regional lymphadenopathy. Coccidioides serology was negative, however, routine COVID-19 testing found the patient to be positive for SARS-CoV-2. She underwent successful treatment for pyelonephritis and was discharged with instructions to follow up in pulmonology clinic. At follow up, she denied any interval development of respiratory symptoms. Repeat chest CT four months later showed complete resolution of the lesion and she was discharged from pulmonology clinic. Discussion: Since the advent of COVID-19, a plethora of radiologic findings have been noted in patients with known infections. Chest CT offers insight into clinical staging of diseas e and temporal evolutions of CT findings correlate with disease severity. Typical features include bilateral peripheral GGO, crazy paving pattern, airspace consolidations, traction bronchiectasis, and bronchovascular thickening. Atypical findings include mediastinal lymphadenopathy, pleural effusions, multiple small nodules, tree-in-bud, pneumothorax, and cavitation. Though not typical and seemingly underreported, a SPN may also indicate a very early infectious stage in the absence of respiratory symptoms. For our patient, Fleischner guidelines suggest a follow-up CT at 6-12 months but such a strategy would surely fail to detect development of pneumonia given the speed at which COVID-19 progresses, and possibly miss the window on early outpatient interventions and infection prevention. Instead, this case highlights the importance of shorter interval repeat chest imaging in patients with incidental SPN and SARS-CoV-2 infection as a means to monitor for resolution or progression requiring further evaluation and treatment.","Vaccarello, A.; Charley, E.; Tharumia Jagadeesan, C.; Talon, A.; Munoz, J.; Irandost, M.; Varda, B.; Saeed, A.

The objective of this study was to describe natural history and clinical outcomes in a large cohort of children with HCM and pathogenic/likely pathogenic (P/LP) MYBPC3 variants. METHODS AND RESULTS: Longitudinal data from 62 consecutive patients diagnosed with HCM under 18 years of age and carrying at least one P/LP MYBPC3 variant were collected from a single specialist referral centre. The primary patient outcome was a major adverse cardiac event (MACE). Median age at diagnosis was 10 (IQR: 2-14) years, with 12 patients (19.4%) diagnosed in infancy. Forty-seven (75%) were boy and 31 (50%) were probands. Median length of follow-up was 3.1 (IQR: 1.6-6.9) years. Nine patients (14.5%) experienced an MACE during follow-up and five (8%) died. Twenty patients (32.3%) had evidence of ventricular arrhythmia, including 6 patients (9.7%) presenting with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Five-year freedom from MACE for those with a single or two MYBPC3 variants was 95.2% (95% CI: 78.6% to 98.5%) and 68.4% (95% CI: 40.6% to 88.9%), respectively (HR 4.65, 95% CI: 1.16 to 18.66, p=0.03). CONCLUSIONS: MYBPC3 variants can cause childhood-onset disease, which is frequently associated with life-threatening ventricular arrhythmia. Clinical outcomes in this cohort vary substantially from aetiologically and genetically mixed paediatric HCM cohorts described previously, highlighting the importance of identifying specific genetic subtypes for clinical management of childhood HCM.","Field, Ella; Norrish, Gabrielle; Acquaah, Vanessa; Dady, Kathleen; Cicerchia, Marcos Nicolas; Ochoa, Juan Pablo; Syrris, Petros; McLeod, Karen; McGowan, Ruth; Fell, Hannah; Lopes, Luis R; Cervi, Elena; Kaski, Juan Pablo Pablo",J. medical. genet,94,16

Thus, this study examines how anatomists in the United Kingdom (UK) and Republic of Ireland (ROI) perceive the teaching adaptations made in response to COVID-19, and how these adaptations have impacted their experiences teaching, their online work environment and community. Data was collected via a questionnaire from 24 anatomists across 15 universities in the UK (11) and ROI (4). With regards to teaching, 95.6% of academics have upskilled in new technologies to meet the demands of distance teaching. Academics (95.8%) preferred face-to-face delivery of practical sessions. Most universities (80.0%) reported that practical sessions will continue in a new form that ensures social distancing. However, 50.0% of academics are uncertain if these adaptations will improve student learning. Many anatomists believe that the new adaptations may hinder student-student (66.7%) and student-tutor (45.8%) interactions. Regarding assessment, 52.6% of academics preferred traditional methods to online. Remote online assessment was difficult to protect against collusion, but provided time saving opportunities for academics.

An alternate entry receptor for the virus was recently proposed to be basigin/CD147. These early studies have already prompted a clinical trial and multiple published hypotheses speculating on the role of this host receptor in viral infection and pathogenesis. Here, we report that we are unable to find evidence supporting the role of basigin as a putative spike binding receptor. Recombinant forms of the SARS-CoV-2 spike do not interact with basigin expressed on the surface of human cells, and by using specialized assays tailored to detect receptor interactions as weak or weaker than the proposed basigin-spike binding, we report no evidence for a direct interaction between the viral spike protein to either of the two common isoforms of basigin. Finally, removing basigin from the surface of human lung epithelial cells by CRISPR/Cas9 results in no change in their susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Given the pressing need for clarity on which viral targets may lead to promising therapeutics, we present these findings to allow more informed decisions about the translational relevance of this putative mechanism in the race to understand and treat COVID-19.","Shilts, Jarrod; Crozier, Thomas W M; Greenwood, Edward J D; Lehner, Paul J; Wright, Gavin J",Sci Rep,94,16

Its role in augmenting thrombotic microangiopathy mediated organ damage has also been implicated in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This study aimed to examine associations between complement parameters and progression to severe COVID-19 illness, as well as correlations with other systems. Blood samples of COVID-19 patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) were analyzed for a wide panel of complement and inflammatory biomarkers. The primary outcome was COVID-19 severity at index ED visit, while the secondary outcome was peak disease severity over the course of illness. Fifty-two COVID-19 patients were enrolled. C3a (p = 0.018), C3a/C3 ratio (p = 0.002), and sC5b-9/C3 ratio (p = 0.021) were significantly elevated in with severe disease at ED presentation. Over the course of illness, C3a (p = 0.028) and C3a/C3 ratio (p = 0.003) were highest in the moderate severity group. In multivariate regression controlled for confounders, complement hyperactivation failed to predict progression to severe disease. C3a, C3a/C3 ratio, and sC5b-9/C3 ratio were correlated positively with numerous inflammatory biomarkers, fibrinogen, and VWF:Ag, and negatively with plasminogen and ADAMTS13 activity. We found evidence of complement hyperactivation in COVID-19, associated with hyperinflammation and thrombotic microangiopathy. Complement inhibition should be further investigated for potential benefit in patients displaying a hyperinflammatory and microangiopathic phenotype.","Henry, Brandon Michael; Szergyuk, Ivan; de Oliveira, Maria Helena Santos; Lippi, Giuseppe; Benoit, Justin L; Vikse, Jens; Benoit, Stefanie W",J. med. virol,94,1

The single accessory gene of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), ORF3, is dispensable for virus replication in vitro, while viral mutants carrying ORF3 truncations exhibit an attenuated phenotype of which the underlying mechanism is unknown. Here, we studied the effect of ORF3 deletion on the proliferation of PEDV in Vero cells. To this end, four recombinant porcine epidemic diarrhea viruses (PEDVs) were rescued using targeted RNA recombination, three carrying the full-length ORF3 gene from different PEDV strains, and one from which the ORF3 gene had been deleted entirely. Our results showed that PEDVs with intact or naturally truncated ORF3 replicated to significantly higher titers than PEDV without an ORF3. Further characterization revealed that the extent of apoptosis induced by PEDV infection was significantly lower with the viruses carrying an intact or C-terminally truncated ORF3 than with the virus lacking ORF3, indicating that the ORF3 protein as well as its truncated form interfered with the apoptosis process. Collectively, we conclude that PEDV ORF3 protein promotes virus proliferation by inhibiting cell apoptosis caused by virus infection. Our findings provide important insight into the role of ORF3 protein in the pathogenicity of PEDV.","Si, Fusheng; Hu, Xiaoxia; Wang, Chenyang; Chen, Bingqing; Wang, Ruiyang; Dong, Shijuan; Yu, Ruisong; Li, Zhen",Viruses,94,24

This workflow started with the throat swab of the COVID-19 patient, combined reverse transcript PCR, and multi-amplification in one-step to shorten the experiment time, then can quickly and steadily obtain high-quality SARS-CoV-2 genome within 24 h. A comprehensive evaluation of the method was conducted in 42 samples: the sequencing quality of the method was correlated well with the viral load of the samples; high-quality SARS-CoV-2 genome could be obtained stably in the samples with Ct value up to 39.14; data yielding for different Ct values were assessed and the recommended sequencing time was 8 h for samples with Ct value of less than 20; variation analysis indicated that the method can detect the existing and emerging genomic mutations as well; Illumina sequencing verified that ultra-deep sequencing can greatly improve the single read error rate of Nanopore sequencing, making it as low as 0.4/10,000 bp.

The aim of this study was to know the influence of the population strict confinement on the presentation of the different types of fracture as well as on the needs of hospital admission by the Orthopedic Surgery and Traumatology Service. METHODS: a retrospective observational analytical descriptive study was carried out on the population attended in the Emergency Services of two general hospitals in a public Health Care Department in Spain. Data were studied from the two-months confinement period in 2020 and compared with the same period in 2018 and 2019. RESULTS: A total of 56,332 emergency cases were included. There was a decrease in the total number of patients attended along the confinement period compared to the same period in the two previous years. Fracture cases decreased by 58,8% in the confinement period (330 in 2020; 715 in 2018 and 884 in 2019). Also there was a 37,6% reduction in fractures needing admission or surgery. The percentage distribution of the types of fractures that required admission resulted in a decrease in upper and lower limb fractures, whereas the number of vertebral and hip fractures remained unchanged. CONCLUSIONS: both the reduction of fractures attended in the emergency department and the maintenance of the number of hip fractures must be taken into account when establishing contingency plans in the event of a pandemic situation in order to properly plan human resources and materials.","Miranda, Ignacio; Sangüesa-Nebot, María José; González, Antonio; Doménech, Julio",J. orthop. sci,94,1

Although in the long-term mass vaccinations remains the most promising approach to control the pandemic, evidence suggests that new variants of the virus have emerged that may be able to evade the immune responses triggered by current vaccines. Therefore despite the recent approval of a number of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines there remains considerable urgency for effective treatments for COVID-19. Severe-to-critical COVID-19 has been shown to be associated with a dysregulated host immune response to SARS-CoV-2 with elevated levels of C-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5) ligands including chemokine C-C ligands 3, 4, 5, as well as interleukins 6 and 10. Leronlimab, a CCR5-specific humanised IgG4 monoclonal antibody originally developed for the treatment of HIV has been studied for the treatment of COVID-19. In the TEMPEST trial which compared leronlimab to placebo in subjects with mild-to-moderate COVID-19, a post hoc analysis showed that leronlimab led to improvements from baseline in National Early Warning Score 2 (NEWS2) at Day 14 in the sub-set of people with more severe disease. Data has also been released on a further ongoing, randomized, placebo-controlled phase 3 registrational trial of leronlimab in 394 people with severe-to-critical COVID-19. The results show that Day 28 mortality was reduced (P=0.0319) in the subset of participants receiving leronlimab plus other pre-specified commonly used COVID-19 treatments including dexamethasone administered as part of their standard of care (SOC) compared to participants receiving placebo plus other pre-specified commonly used COVID-19 treatments including dexamethasone as part of their SOC. Several cases have recently been reported demonstrated that treatment with leronlimab restores immune function and achieves clinical improvement in people with critical COVID-19. Here we report on a further case of a critically ill person who was treated with leronlimab. This person had been on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) for an extended period of time before receiving 4 doses of leronlimab. The male subject received his first dose of leronlimab on Day 79 of hospitalization he was weaned off ECMO by Day 84 and discharged from the ECMO intensive care unit on Day 91.

The latter two pillars have been challenged during the course of the COVID-19 pandemic across all population age groups including children. The closure of schools resulted in decreased organised physical activity, increase in sedentary lifestyle and screen time with the possibility of stress-induced indulgence in high calorie dense and sugary foods, resulting in higher susceptibility to weight gain. The uncertainty faced by many Northern Hemisphere governments as the new scholastic year looms closer whether to open schools again or not further enhances the stress on the children and their family. Re-opening of schools is beneficial for children's mental and physical health, and general wellbeing including the 'combating' of the childhood obesity epidemic. The family unit has also been challenged during this pandemic especially if the parent/s suffered redundancy. There have been attempts at seeing a silver lining as some families have embraced lockdowns as a means to strengthen their family bonds, increase homemade meals apart from the various virtual opportunities that were streamed on social media to encourage children to perform physical activity at home or in safe environments. However, curbing the viral spread while protecting population health will remain top priority until an effective COVID-19 vaccine is available. It is imperative to address other co-existing problems such as childhood obesity, which if uncontrolled may have a long-term profound health and economic consequence of higher eminence than the actual COVID-19 infection.

Currently, there is a lack of research that studies these aspects beyond technology and examines the impact of digital transformation on the full life cycle of disaster management on the national level. Therefore, this research fills this gap by integrating interdisciplinary concepts from different research fields including Disaster Management, Information Systems, and Business Management to understand the impact and determinants of digital transformation in NDM systems. To achieve this, the research uses the Technology-Organization-Environment (TOE) framework and conducts semi-structured interviews with UK NDM experts. The results show that the impact of digital transformation on NDM is profound, paradoxical, multi-directional, and driven by a multitude of driving forces. This research makes many significant contributions to research and practice. Theoretically, this research expands the TOE framework beyond its original underpinnings by uncovering a new set of disaster-context determinants. It also presents an innovative Layered Cake FAST (Foundations-Approach-Strategy-Technology) Model that offers a unique roadmap for NDM on how to handle its digital transformation journey. Practically, the research presents several sets of useful expert-recommended actions.","AlHinai, Yousuf Salim",Int J Disaster Risk Reduct,94,24

Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) are currently some of the most widely-used drugs to control blood pressure by acting on the angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R). ARBs have been reported to trigger the modulation of the angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the receptor used by the virus to penetrate susceptible cells, raising concern that such treatments may promote virus capture and increase their viral load in patients receiving ARBs therapy. In this in vitro study, we reviewed the effect of ARBs on ACE2 and AT1R expression and investigated whether treatment of permissive ACE2+/AT1R+ Vero E6 cells with ARBs alters SARS-CoV-2 replication in vitro in an angiotensin II-free system. After treating the cells with the ARBs, we observed an approximate 50% relative increase in SARS-CoV-2 production in infected Vero E6 cells that correlates with the ARBs-induced up-regulation of ACE2 expression. From this data, we believe that the use of ARBs in hypertensive patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 should be carefully evaluated.","Pires de Souza, Gabriel Augusto; Osman, Ikram Omar; Le Bideau, Marion; Baudoin, Jean-Pierre; Jaafar, Rita; Devaux, Christian; La Scola, Bernard",Front Cell Infect Microbiol,94,16

Slightly more than two decades ago, a new type of IFN was discovered: the lambda IFN (type III IFN). Like other IFN, the type III IFN display antiviral activity against a wide variety of infections, they induce expression of antiviral, interferon-stimulated genes (MX1, OAS, IFITM1), and they have immuno-modulatory activities that shape adaptive immune responses. Unlike other IFN, the type III IFN signal through distinct receptors is limited to a few cell types, primarily mucosal epithelial cells. As a consequence of their greater and more durable production in nasal and respiratory tissues, they can determine the outcome of respiratory infections. This review is focused on the role of IFN-&#955; in the pathogenesis of respiratory viral infections, with influenza as a prime example. The influenza virus is a major public health problem, causing up to half a million lethal infections annually. Moreover, the virus has been the cause of four pandemics over the last century. Although IFN-&#955; are increasingly being tested in antiviral therapy, they can have a negative influence on epithelial tissue recovery and increase the risk of secondary bacterial infections. Therefore, IFN-&#955; expression deserves increased scrutiny as a key factor in the host immune response to infection.","Lozhkov, Alexey A; Klotchenko, Sergey A; Ramsay, Edward S; Moshkoff, Herman D; Moshkoff, Dmitry A; Vasin, Andrey V; Salvato, Maria S",,94,1

Here, we aimed to investigate the quality of life (QoL) in brain tumor patients and relatives in this setting. Over twelve weeks during the first wave of the pandemic (04-07/2020), brain tumor patients and their families from two large German tertiary care centers were asked to complete weekly questionnaires for anxiety, depression, distress, and well-being. Information regarding social support and living conditions was also collected. One hundred participants (63 patients, 37 relatives) completed 729 questionnaires over the course of the study. Compared to relatives, patients showed more depressive symptoms (p < 0.001) and reduced well-being (p = 0.013). While acceptance of lockdown measures decreased over time, QoL remained stable. QoL measures between patients and their families were weakly or moderately correlated. The number of social contacts was strongly associated with QoL. Age, living conditions, ongoing therapy, employment, and physical activity were other predictors. QoL is correlated between patients and their families and heavily depends on social support factors, indicating the need to focus on the entire family and their social situation for QoL interventions during the pandemic.","Troschel, Fabian M; Ahndorf, Franziska; Wille, Lisa-Marie; Brandt, Ralf; Jost, Johanna; Rekowski, Sylvia; Eich, Hans Theodor; Stummer, Walter; Wiewrodt, Rainer; Jetschke, Kathleen; Wiewrodt, Dorothee",,94,16

DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis. DATA SOURCES: PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), China Science and Technology Journal Database (VIP) and Wanfang (up to October 2020). Studies in languages other than English and Chinese were excluded. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR SELECTING STUDIES: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the impact of dexmedetomidine on emergence agitation (EA), the need for postoperative rescue analgesics, postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), and other adverse events in paediatric patients during CLP repair. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: The quality of evidence was assessed by using the Cochrane Review Methods and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach. Data were screened, extracted and assessed by two independent authors. Outcomes were reported as a risk ratio (RR) with a 95% CI. A random-effect model was used when heterogeneity was detected. RESULTS: Thirteen studies including 1040 children met the inclusion criteria. The incidence of EA was significantly decreased in the dexmedetomidine group (RR, 0.19; 95% CI 0.10 to 0.36; p<0.00001; I2=56%) as compared with the control group. Paediatric patients receiving dexmedetomidine had lower postoperative analgesic requirements (RR, 0.27; 95% CI 0.10 to 0.73; p=0.01; I2=84%) and a lower incidence of respiratory adverse events (RR, 0.49; 95% CI 0.31 to 0.78; p=0.003; I2=0%). There were no significant differences in the risk of PONV and cardiovascular adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: There was a lack of high-quality studies in this field. Perioperative administration of dexmedetomidine reduced the need for postoperative rescue analgesics and the incidence of EA in children without side effects undergoing CLP repair.

BACKGROUND: Acute care providers may be exposed to an increased risk of contracting the COVID-19 infection since many patients present to the emergency department without complete screening measures. However, it is not known which patients present with the highest incidence. METHODS: All acute care surgery (ACS) patients who presented to our level I trauma center between March 19, 2020, and September 20, 2020 and were tested for COVID-19 were included in the study. The patients were divided into two cohorts: COVID positive (+) and COVID negative (-). Patient demographics, type of consultation (emergency general surgery consults [EGS], interpersonal violence trauma consults [IPV], and non-interpersonal violence trauma consults [NIPV]), clinical data and outcomes were analyzed. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to compare differences between the groups. RESULTS: In total, 2177 patients met inclusion criteria. Of these, 116 were COVID+ (5.3%) and 2061 were COVID- (94.7%). COVID+ patients were more frequently Latinos (64.7% versus 61.7%, P = 0.043) and African Americans (18.1% versus 11.2%, P < 0.001) and less frequently Caucasian (6.0% versus 14.1%, P < 0.001). Asian/Filipino/Pacific Islander (7.8% versus 7.2%, P = 0.059) and Native American/Other/Unknown (3.4% versus 5.8%, P = 0.078) groups showed no statistical difference in COVID incidence. Mortality, hospital and ICU lengths of stay were similar between the groups and across patient populations stratified by the type of consultation. Logistic regression demonstrated higher odds of COVID+ infection amongst IPV patients (OR 2.33, 95% CI 1.62-7.56, P < 0.001) compared to other ACS consultation types.

This is anticipated to result in long-term negative mental health effects on the population, with HCWs representing a particularly vulnerable group. The scope of the COVID-19 pandemic necessitates the development of a scalable mental health platform to provide services to large numbers of at-risk or affected individuals. The Mount Sinai Health System in New York City was at the epicenter of the pandemic in the United States. OBJECTIVE: The Center for Stress, Resilience, and Personal Growth (CSRPG) was created to address the current and anticipated psychological impact of the pandemic on the HCWs in the health system. The mission of the Center is to support the resilience and mental health of employees through educational offerings, outreach, and clinical care. Our aim was to build a mobile app to support the newly founded Center in its mission. METHODS: We built the app as a standalone digital platform that hosts a suite of tools that users can interact with on a daily basis. With consideration for the Center's aims, we determined the overall vision, initiatives, and goals for the Wellness Hub app, followed by specific milestone tasks and deliverables for development. We defined the app's primary features based on the mental health assessment and needs of HCWs. Feature definition was informed by the results of a resilience survey widely distributed to Mount Sinai HCWs and by the resources offered at CSRPG, including workshop content. RESULTS: We launched our app over the course of two phases, the first phase being a ""soft"" launch and the second being a broader launch to all of Mount Sinai. Of the 231 HCWs who downloaded the app, 173 (74.9%) completed our baseline assessment of all mental health screeners in the app. Results from the baseline assessment show that more than half of the users demonstrate a need for support in at least one psychological area. As of 3 months after the Phase 2 launch, approximately 55% of users re-entered the app after their first opening to explore additional features, with an average of 4 app openings per person. CONCLUSIONS: To address the mental health needs of HCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic, the Wellness Hub app was built and deployed throughout the Mount Sinai Health System. To our knowledge, this is the first resilience app of its kind. The Wellness Hub app is a promising proof of concept, with room to grow, for those who wish to build a secure mobile health app to support their employees, communities, or others in managing and improving mental and physical well-being.

The causative agents of global heterogeneity in the whole genome of SARS-CoV-2 are not well characterized due to the lack of comparative study of a large enough sample size from around the globe to reduce the standard deviation to the acceptable margin of error. To better understand the SARS-CoV-2 genome architecture, we have performed a comprehensive analysis of codon usage bias of sixty (60) strains to get a snapshot of its global heterogeneity. Our study shows a relatively low codon usage bias in the SARS-CoV-2 viral genome globally, with nearly all the over-preferred codons' A.U. ended. We concluded that the SARS-CoV-2 genome is primarily shaped by mutation pressure; however, marginal selection pressure cannot be overlooked. Within the A/U rich virus genomes of SARS-CoV-2, the standard deviation in G.C. (42.91% ± 5.84%) and the GC3 value (30.14% ± 6.93%) points towards global heterogeneity of the virus. Several SARS-CoV-2 viral strains were originated from different viral lineages at the exact geographic location also supports this fact. Taking all together, these findings suggest that the general root ancestry of the global genomes are different with different genome's level adaptation to host.

""Probability of dying from any of cardiovascular, cancer, diabetes or chronic renal disease"" and ""suicide mortality rate"" were the most commonly assessed health indicators and core priorities within the WHO General Programme of Work 2019/2023 and the EPW 2020/2025. Big data analytics have shown moderate to high accuracy for the diagnosis and prediction of complications of diabetes mellitus as well as for the diagnosis and classification of mental disorders; prediction of suicide attempts and behaviors; and the diagnosis, treatment, and prediction of important clinical outcomes of several chronic diseases. Confidence in the results was rated as ""critically low"" for 25 reviews, as ""low"" for 7 reviews, and as ""moderate"" for 3 reviews. The most frequently identified challenges were establishment of a well-designed and structured data source, and a secure, transparent, and standardized database for patient data. CONCLUSIONS: Although the overall quality of included studies was limited, big data analytics has shown moderate to high accuracy for the diagnosis of certain diseases, improvement in managing chronic diseases, and support for prompt and real-time analyses of large sets of varied input data to diagnose and predict disease outcomes.

METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed all COVID patients diagnosed with AP in 62 Spanish EDs (20% of Spanish EDs, COVID-AP) during the COVID outbreak. We formed two control groups: COVID patients without AP (COVID-non-AP) and non-COVID patients with AP (non-COVID-AP). Unadjusted comparisons between cases and controls were performed regarding 59 baseline and clinical characteristics and 4 outcomes. RESULTS: We identified 54 AP in 74,814 patients with COVID-19 attending the ED (frequency=0.72, 95%CI=0.54-0.94). This frequency was lower than in non-COVID patients (2,231/1,388,879, 1.61, 95%CI=1.54-1.67; OR=0.44, 95%CI=0.34-0.58). Etiology of AP was similar in both groups, being biliary origin in about 50%. Twenty-six clinical characteristics of COVID patients were associated with a higher risk of developing AP: abdominal pain (OR=59.4, 95%CI=23.7-149), raised blood amylase (OR=31.8; 95%CI=1.60-632) and vomiting (OR=15.8, 95%CI=6.69-37.2) being the strongest, and some inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, platelets, D-dimer) were more increased. Compared to non-COVID-AP, COVID-AP patients differed in 23 variables; the strongest ones related to COVID symptoms, but less abdominal pain was reported, pancreatic enzymes raise was lower, and severity (estimated by BISAP and SOFA score at ED arrival) was higher. The in-hospital mortality (adjusted for age and sex) of COVID-AP did not differ from COVID-non-AP (OR=1.12, 95%CI=0.45-245) but was higher than non-COVID-AP (OR=2.46, 95%CI=1.35-4.48). CONCLUSIONS: Acute pancreatitis as presenting form of COVID-19 in the ED is unusual (<1 cases). Some clinically distinctive characteristics are present compared to the remaining COVID patients and can help to identify this unusual manifestation. In-hospital mortality of COVID-AP does not differ from COVID-non-AP but is higher than non-COVID-AP, and the higher severity of AP in COVID patients could partially contribute to this increment.","Miró, Òscar; Llorens, Pere; Jiménez, Sònia; Piñera, Pascual; Burillo-Putze, Guillermo; Martín, Alfonso; Martín-Sánchez, Francisco Javier; Lambereche, Jorge; Alquézar-Arbé, Aitor; Jacob, Javier; Noceda, José; Cano, María José Cano; Fortuny Bayarri, María José; Marín Porrino, Juan Miguel; Meléndez, Napoleón; Pérez García, Carles; Brasó Aznar, José Vicente; Ponce, María Carmen; Díaz Fernández, Elena; Ejarque Martínez, Laura; Peiró Gómez, Ana; Tost, Josep; Domínguez, María Jesús; Teigell Muñoz, Francisco Javier; González Del Castillo, Juan",J. hepato-biliary-pancreat. sci.

This study shows the effect of the pandemic on our practice in paediatric orthopaedics in a referral third level paediatric hospital. Methods We performed a single-centre retrospective review of the official census from a third level paediatric hospital from 14 March to 14 April for the years 2018, 2019 and 2020. Results The patients seen in our clinic during this period in 2020 decreased in by 82% (p &lt; 0.001) compared with 2018 and 2019, however, the number of telemedicine consultations increased by 90.21% (p &lt; 0.001). The total number of patients attending the clinic (including onsite and virtual) was reduced by 54.25% (p &lt; 0.001). The total surgeries performed plummeted by 81% in this period in 2020 (p &lt; 0.001) due to a reduction in elective cases of 94.6% (p &lt; 0.001). No significant decrease was found in the number of urgent surgical cases per day in 2020 (p = 0.34). Finally, the number of orthopaedic patients admitted to our emergency department dropped by 78.6% during the state of alarm (p &lt; 0.001). Conclusion According to our results, the pandemic has significantly affected our daily practice by decreasing elective surgeries and onsite clinics, but other activities have increased. As we have implemented telemedicine and new technologies to adapt to this setback, we should take advantage of the situation to change our practice in the future to better allocate our health resources and to anticipate outbreaks.","Peiro-Garcia, Alejandro; Corominas, Laura; Coelho, Alexandre; Desena-Decabo, Lidia; Torner-Rubies, Ferran; Fontecha, Cesar G.",J.

This outbreak threatens not only physical health but also has significant repercussions on mental health. In recent world history, major infectious outbreaks were associated with severe mental health sequelae, including suicide. In this study, we systematically review the literature on suicidal outcomes during major international respiratory outbreaks, including COVID-19. We reviewed descriptive and analytic articles addressing suicide during major international respiratory outbreaks. We searched PubMed, Medline, Embase, Scopus, and PsycInfo databases and then utilized an independent method for study selection by a pair of reviewers. Two reviewers completed data abstraction and conducted a narrative summary of the findings. Our search generated 2,153 articles. Nine studies (three descriptive, five analytical, and one with mixed methodology) were eligible. The included studies were heterogeneous, divergent in methods, and with a low degree of evidence. Deducing an association between pandemics, suicide, and suicide-related outcomes remains thus poorly supported. Future research with better methodological characteristics, the use of longitudinal studies, and a focus on suicide as the primary outcome would allow for an in-depth understanding and formulation of the scope of this problem.","Kahil, Karine; Cheaito, Mohamad Ali; El Hayek, Rawad; Nofal, Marwa; El Halabi, Sarah; Kudva, Kundadak Ganesh; Pereira-Sanchez, Victor; El Hayek, Samer",Asian J Psychiatr,94,20

For a proportion of hospitalized patients, death can occur within a few days, mainly for adult respiratory distress syndrome or multi-organ dysfunction syndrome. In these patients, clinical signs and symptoms, as well as laboratory abnormalities, suggest a cytokine storm syndrome in response to the viral infection. No current targeted treatment is yet available for COVID-19, an unknown disease up to 2 months ago, which challenges doctors and researchers to find new drugs or reallocate other treatments for these patients. Since the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak, a growing body of information on diagnostic and therapeutic strategies has emerged, mainly based on preliminary experience on retrospective studies or small case series. Antivirals, antimalarials, corticosteroids, biotechnological and small molecules, convalescent plasma and anticoagulants are among the drugs proposed for the treatment or in tested for COVID-19. Given the complexity of this new condition, a multidisciplinary management seems to be the best approach. Sharing and integrating knowledge between specialists, to evaluate the correct timing and setting of every treatment, could greatly benefit our patients.

Much of the morbidity, mortality and health care costs of COPD are attributable to acute exacerbations, the commonest causes of which are respiratory infections. Respiratory viruses are frequently detected in COPD exacerbations but direct proof of a causative relationship has been lacking. We have developed a model of COPD exacerbation using experimental rhinovirus infection in COPD patients and this has established a causative relationship between virus infection and exacerbations. In addition it has determined some of the molecular mechanisms linking virus infections to COPD exacerbations and identified potential new therapeutic targets. This new data should stimulate research into the role of antiviral agents as potential treatments for COPD exacerbations. Testing of antiviral agents has been hampered by the lack of a small animal model for rhinovirus infection and experimental rhinovirus infection in healthy volunteers has been used to test treatments for the common cold. Experimental rhinovirus infection in COPD subjects offers the prospect of a model that can be used to evaluate the effects of new treatments for virus-induced COPD exacerbations, and provide essential data that can be used in making decisions regarding large scale clinical trials.","Gunawardana, Natasha; Finney, Lydia; Johnston, Sebastian L.; Mallia, Patrick",Antiviral Research,94,21

Since the first outbreaks in Belgium and the United Kingdom were reported in 1971, PED has spread throughout many countries around the world and causing significant economic loss. This study was conducted to investigate the recent distribution of PEDV strains in Vietnam during the 2015–2016 seasons. METHODS: A total of 30 PED‐specific PCR‐positive intestinal and faecal samples were collected from unvaccinated piglets in Vietnam during the 2015–2016 seasons. The full length of the spike (S) gene of these PEDV strains were analysed to determine their phylogeny and genetic relationship with other available PEDV strains globally. RESULTS: Phylogenetic analysis of the complete S gene sequences revealed that the 28 Vietnamese PEDV strains collected in the northern and central regions clustered in the G2 group (both G2a and G2b sub‐groups), while the other 2 PEDV strains (HUA‐PED176 and HUA‐PED254) collected in the southern region were clustered in the G1/G1b group/sub‐group. The nucleotide (nt) and deduced amino acid (aa) analyses based on the complete S gene sequences showed that the Vietnamese PEDV strains were closely related to each other, sharing nt and aa homology of 93.2%–99.9% and 92.6%–99.9%, respectively. The N‐glycosylation patterns and mutations in the antigenic region were observed in Vietnamese PEDV strains.

After the emergence of this virus, it became a global public health concern and quickly evolved into a pandemic. Mexico is currently in the third position in the number of deaths due to SARS-CoV-2. To date, there have been several lineages of SARS-CoV-2 worldwide; in the Mexican population, two variants of the spike protein (S-protein) are found, localized at H49Y and D614G, which have been related to increased infectivity with respect to the wild-type S-protein. To understand how these differences impact the structural behavior of the S-protein of SARS-CoV-2, as well as binding with ACE2, we performed MD simulations combined with the molecular mechanics generalized Born/Poisson-Boltzmann surface area (MMGB(PB)SA) approach starting from X-ray crystallography data. Energetic and structural analysis showed that the differences in infectivity can be explained by differences in affinity of the protein-protein interface between the wild-type and mutant S-protein with ACE2. Conformational analysis showed that molecular recognition between the S-protein and ACE2 is linked to a decrease in the conformational flexibility of wild-type and mutant S-protein; however, an increase in the conformational mobility of ACE2 could also contribute to the binding affinity observed using the MMGB(PB)SA method.","Bello, Martiniano; Hasan, Md Kamrul; Hussain, Nazmul",J Mol Graph Model,94,20

However, predictive factors for the outcomes remain unclear. OBJECTIVE: Attempted to determine the predictive factors for the poor outcomes of patients with COVID-19. STUDY DESIGN: This is a single-center, retrospective study. Clinical, laboratory, and treatment data were collected and analyzed from 111 hospitalized patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in Union Hospital. The gathered data of discharged and deteriorated patients were compared. RESULTS: Among these 111 patients, 93 patients were discharged and 18 patients were deteriorated. The lymphocyte count (0.56 G/L [0.47-0.63] vs 1.30 G/L [0.95-1.65]) was lower in the deteriorated group than those in the discharged group. The numbers of pulmonary lobe involved (5.00 [5.00–5.00] vs 4.00 [2.00-5.00]), serum C‐reactive protein (CRP, 79.52 mg/L [61.25-102.98] vs 7.93 mg/L [3.14-22.50]), IL-6 (35.72 pg/ml [9.24-85.19] vs 5.09 pg/ml [3.16-9.72]), and IL-10 (5.35 pg/ml [4.48-7.84] vs 3.97 pg/ml [3.34-4.79]) concentrations in deteriorated patients were elevated compared with discharged patients.

By using complete nucleotide sequences of S1 gene we determined the phylogeny of these IBV isolates, which in turn allowed us to define six lineages/genotypes, a number of recombinants and a novel variant. The GI-19 lineage was the most frequently isolated type in China in recent years. Although scattered mutations in the S1 gene among the GI-19 lineage viruses were observed, we also noted different sublineages in the GI-19 lineage with unique mutations, suggesting a high degree of S1 gene variation since they were first isolated in the mid-1990s. We also isolated a number of vaccine-like viruses from vaccinated diseased chickens, although more work is needed to differentiate the reisolation of vaccine strains from field strains of the same serotype. One of the important findings in this study is that the prevalence of the TW I type viruses in GI-7 lineage has been increasing in recent years in China. Another important finding is that recombination events occurred between the predominant GI-19 lineage and the commonly used 4/91 vaccine, which gave rise to distinct IBV isolates. In addition, a novel IBV isolate, together with a reference strain in GenBank database, were found to form a novel lineage/genotype that was remarkably distinct from established lineages. The characteristics of the antigenicity, tissue tropism, pathogenicity and complete genome were required for further investigation for the recombinants and the viruses in different sublineages and novel lineages.

Our purpose was to report outcomes of critically ill COVID-19 patients after hospitalization in a field intensive care unit (ICU), established under military tents in a civil–military collaboration. METHODS: All patients with COVID-19-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) admitted to the Military Health Service Field Intensive Care Unit in Mulhouse (France) between March 24, 2020, and May 7, 2020, were included in the study. Medical history and clinical and laboratory data were collected prospectively. The institutional review board of the French Society Anesthesia and Intensive Care approved the study. RESULTS: Forty-seven patients were hospitalized (37 men, median age 62 [54-67] years, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score 7 [6-10] points, and Simplified Acute Physiology Score II score 39 [28-50] points) during the 45-day deployment of the field ICU. Median length of stay was 11 [6-15] days and median length of ventilation was 13 [7.5-21] days. At the end of the deployment, 25 (53%) patients went back home, 17 (37%) were still hospitalized, and 4 (9%) died. At hospital discharge, 40 (85%) patients were alive. CONCLUSION: In this study, a military field ICU joined a regional civil hospital to manage a large cluster of COVID-19-related ARDS patients in Mulhouse, France. This report illustrates how military teams can support civil authorities in the provision of advanced critical care. Outcomes of patient suggest that this field hospital deployment was an effective adaptation during pandemic conditions.","Danguy des Déserts, Marc; Mathais, Quentin; Morvan, Jean Baptiste; Rager, Gwendoline; Escarment, Jacques; Pasquier, Pierre",Mil Med,94,15

We explore the impact of having in-person sports on COVID-19 transmission on a college campus, specifically the excess cases within the campus community can be anticipated. Methods: Using a stochastic compartmental model representing the interactions between the university community, we model the impact of transient influxes of visitors attending sporting events and ancillary activities (bars, dining out, etc.). We consider a number of scenarios, varying the extent to which visitors interact with the campus, the number of infectious visitors, and the extent to which the campus has controlled COVID-19 absent events. We also conducted a sensitivity analysis, exploring the model's outcomes over a wide range of uncertainty. Results: Events caused an increase in the number of cases among the campus community, ranging from a 25% increase in a scenario where the campus already had an uncontrolled COVID-19 outbreak and visitors had a low prevalence of COVID-19 and mixed lightly with the campus community to an 822% increase where the campus had controlled their COVID-19 outbreak and visitors had both a high prevalence of COVID-19 and mixed heavily with the campus community. The model was insensitive to parameter uncertainty, save for the duration a symptomatic individual was infectious. Conclusion: In-person sporting events represent a threat to the health of the campus community. This is the case even in circumstances where COVID-19 seems controlled both on-campus and among the larger population visitors are drawn from.","Johnson, S. S.; Jackson, K. C.; Mietchen, M.

We provide a roadmap from the access to epidemiological data sources to the control of epidemic phenomena. We review the available methodologies and discuss the challenges in the development of data-driven strategies to combat the spreading of infectious diseases. Our aim is to bring together several different disciplines required to provide a holistic approach to epidemic analysis, such as data science, epidemiology, and systems-and-control theory. A 3M-analysis is presented, whose three pillars are: Monitoring, Modelling and Managing. The focus is on the potential of data-driven schemes to address three different challenges raised by a pandemic: (i) monitoring the epidemic evolution and assessing the effectiveness of the adopted countermeasures; (ii) modelling and forecasting the spread of the epidemic; (iii) making timely decisions to manage, mitigate and suppress the contagion. For each step of this roadmap, we review consolidated theoretical approaches (including data-driven methodologies that have been shown to be successful in other contexts) and discuss their application to past or present epidemics, such as Covid-19, as well as their potential application to future epidemics.","Alamo, Teodoro; G.

In the current study, the long-term viral safety of macrobead implantation into pancreatectomized diabetic dogs treated with pravastatin (n = 3) was assessed while 2 dogs served as nonimplanted controls. A more gradual return to preimplant insulin requirements occurred after a 2nd implant procedure (days 148, 189, and >652) when compared to a first macrobead implantation (days 9, 21, and 21) in all macrobead implanted animals. In all three implanted dogs, porcine C-peptide was detected in the blood for at least 10 days following the first implant and for at least 26 days following the second implant. C-peptide was also present in the peritoneal fluid of all three implanted dogs at 6 months after 2nd implant and in 2 of 3 dogs at necropsy. Prescreening results of islet macrobeads and culture media prior to transplantation were negative for 13 viruses. No evidence of PERV or other viral transmission was found throughout the study. This study demonstrates that the long-term (2.4 years) implantation of agarose-agarose encapsulated porcine islets is a safe procedure in a large animal model of type I diabetes mellitus.","Gazda, Lawrence S.; Vinerean, Horatiu V.; Laramore, Melissa A.; Hall, Richard D.; Carraway, Joseph W.; Smith, Barry H.",J Diabetes Res,94,16

OBJECTIVES: The objective of the present work is to present the epidemiological variations in the production of fractures in the period of mandatory confinement in our reference population. METHODS: Analytical retrospective comparative study of two groups of patients: Group A: patients admitted before the state of alarm that forced confinement in the period from January 13 to March 13 compared to Group B: patients admitted in the two months of confinement, until the de-escalation period began, March 13-May 13. Epidemiological variables including age, personal history, type of fracture, mechanism of injury, outpatient rate, and hospital stay were recorded. RESULTS: A total of 190 patients were included. 112 in the pre-confinement period and 78 in the confinement (30% decrease). The mean age (p = 0.007) and falls at home (p < 0.001) were higher in the confinement group. The postoperative (p = 0.006) and overall (p < 0.001) hospital stay were significantly less in the confinement group. No differences were found in the anatomical location of the lesion, sex, comorbidities, mechanism of injury, outpatient rate, or death. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the results of our study, the period of forced confinement due to the COVID-19 pandemic has produced a drastic decrease in the total number of fractures admitted to the traumatology service of a third level hospital. On the other hand, osteoporotic hip fractures have not varied in their incidence and a decrease in the average postoperative and overall stay has been observed.","González-Martín, D.; Álvarez-De la Cruz, J.; Martín-Vélez, P.; Boluda-Mengod, J.; Pais-Brito, J.L.; Herrera-Pérez, M.",Rev Esp Cir Ortop Traumatol,94,16

The COVID-19 pandemic has changed patient flow and healthcare strategies at numerous emergency departments across Brazil with still unknown consequences for the population. This study sought to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on clinical outcomes in patients with acute obstructive pyelonephritis at a tertiary academic center. MATERIALS AND METHODS: After Institutional Review Board approval, a retrospective chart review of patients who required decompression of the collecting system due to acute obstructive pyelonephritis from June 2019 to July 2020 was conducted. Basic demographic information, pre-operative, and peri-operative data were recorded. Patients were assigned in “Pre-Covid” and “Post-Covid” groups based on the admission dates. RESULTS: A total of 63 patients were included, with 40 patients in the Pre-Covid group and 23 in the Post-Covid group. Patients from the Post-Covid group presented at the ER later after symptoms onset (7.8 vs. 4.3 days; p = 0.012), had higher rates of SIRS (57% vs. 25%; p = 0.012), perirenal abscesses (13% vs. 0%; p = 0.019), overall complications (p = 0.047) and presented longer hospital length of stay (7.6 vs. 3.8; p = 0.007). CONCLUSION: During the COVID-19 pandemic, patients with acute obstructive pyelonephritis presented later for evaluation at the ER, had higher disease severity and longer hospital length of stay when compared to the pre-COVID group of patients with the same pathology.","Silva, André B.; Freschi, Gustavo; Carrera, Raphael V.; Astolfi, Rafael H.; Berti, Fernando F.; Gattas, Nelson; Meller, Alex",Int Urol Nephrol,94,17

Twenty-two CNAs (100% female, mean age 48 years, 82% Black/African American) from 3 mid-sized, non-profit NHs in the Southeast US completed either a standard 8-week, 20 h self-compassion training or a 6-week, 6 h modified version designed for health care providers. Qualitative data analyses from post-training focus group discussions identified four themes pertaining to changes in: (1) stress management, (2) appreciation and support, (3) caregiver role, and (4) connection to others. Findings suggested self-compassion training is feasible and beneficial for the stressors that CNAs experience.

It is the authors’ clinical experience that patients in the intensive care unit suffering from COVID-19 are extremely pro-coagulable, with venous and arterial thromboembolism frequently observed, and losses of vascular access lines and filtration circuits to thrombosis now commonplace. Here, we explore the evidence for hypercoagulability in this group, presenting evidence of both a localised pulmonary hypercoagulability, and a systemic hypercoagulability resulting in thrombosis distant to the pulmonary vasculature. Furthermore, we discuss the possible risk factors exacerbated by, or selected for in COVID-19. We review the available evidence for use of plasma D-dimer as a prognostic marker, exploring the possibility that it acts as a marker of a COVID-19-associated hypercoagulability. We review the evidence for a pro-coagulant subtype of disseminated intravascular coagulation, discussing its clinical significance. Finally, we discuss the current evidence surrounding treatment of COVID-19 hypercoagulability, including prophylactic and treatment-dose heparin, thrombolytic agents, antiplatelet agents, and direct thrombin inhibitors, among others. We suggest areas in which further investigation is urgently needed to reduce the startling incidence of thrombosis in this group, a complication no doubt contributing to morbidity and mortality.","Frazer, John Scott; Tyrynis Everden, Angharad Joanna",,94,24

The research reported here aims to understand how argumentative interactions involving role-play, with subsequent group reflection on them, contribute to collaborative creative design projects. The study was carried within a specialised Masters course at the Royal College of Art (London), organised jointly with Imperial College London, and focuses on analysing group reflection sessions of two groups of students whose on-going project was initially defined as “communication by touch”. Results showed that although students reported difficulties in playing argumentative roles that were not aligned with their personal views, their debates enabled them to arrive at “Eureka!” moments with respect to better grounded and precise definitions of their project concepts. We highlight the complex ways in which emotions circulate with respect to “Eureka!” moments, role-play and grounding. Given differences in ways that groups played out their assigned argumentative roles, we conclude that role play debate and group reflection on it need to be applied and considered as a whole in creative design training.","Baker, Michael J.; Détienne, Françoise; Mougenot, Céline; Corvin, Tim; Pennington, Miles",Learn Cult Soc Interact,94,3

A better awareness and understanding of these differences might help to improve the outcome of preclinical research. In reproduction, the placenta is the central organ regulating fetal exposure to a substance circulating in the maternal organism. Exact information about placental transfer can help to better estimate the toxic potential of a substance. From an evolutionary point of view, the chorioallantoic placenta is the organ with the highest anatomical diversity among species. Moreover, frequently used animal models in reproduction belong to rodents and lagomorphs, two groups that are characterized by the generation of an additional type of placenta, which is crucial for fetal development, but absent from humans: the inverted yolk sac placenta. Taken together, the translatability of placental transfer studies from laboratory animals to humans is challenging, which is supported by the fact that numerous species-dependent toxic effects are described in literature. Thus, reliable human-relevant data are frequently lacking and the toxic potential of chemicals and pharmaceuticals for humans can hardly be estimated, often resulting in recommendations that medical treatments or exposure to chemicals should be avoided for safety reasons. Although species differences of placental anatomy have been described frequently and the need for human-relevant research models has been emphasized, analyses of substances with species-dependent placental transfer have been performed only sporadically. Here, we present examples for species-specific placental transfer, including that of nanoparticles and pharmaceuticals, and discuss potential underlying mechanisms. With respect to the COVID 19-pandemic it might be of interest that some antiviral drugs are reported to feature species-specific placental transfer. Further, differences in placental structure and antibody transfer may affect placental transfer of ZIKA virus.","Schmidt, André; Schmidt, Astrid; Markert, Udo R",Placenta,94,17

In fact, the activation or inhibition of membrane trafficking and other related activities are fundamental to ensure the adequate replication and spreading of certain viruses. In this review, data will be presented that support the key role of membrane dynamics in the viral cycle, especially in terms of the assembly, egression and infection processes.

This study was performed to investigate the association of prealbumin at baseline on COVID19-related mortality in elderly patients. Methods: We non-selectively and consecutively collected participants in Tongji Hospital in Wuhan from January 17 to February 17, 2020. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were employed to evaluate the correlation between prealbumin and in-hospital outcomes (in-hospital mortality, ICU admission and mechanical ventilation) in elderly COVID-19 patients. Linear trend was performed by entering the median value of each category of prealbumin tertile as continuous variable and was visually confirmed by using generalized additive models. Interaction and stratified analyses were conducted as well. Results: A total of 446 COVID-19 elderly patients were included in the final analyses and the in-hospital mortality was 14.79%. 15.47% patients admitted to intensive care unit and 21.3% patients required mechanical ventilation. Compared with patients in the highest tertile, the prealbumin of patients in the lowest tertile had a 19.09-fold higher risk of death (OR = 20.09; 95% CI, 3.62 to 111.64; P = 0.0006), 25.39-fold higher risk of ICU admission (OR = 26.39; 95% CI, 4.04to 172.39; P = 0.0006) and 1.8-fold higher risk of mechanical ventilation (OR = 2.8; 95% CI, 1.15 to 6.78; P = 0.0227) after adjustment for potential confounders. There was a linear trend correlation between serum prealbumin concentration and risk of in-hospital mortality, ICU admission and mechanical ventilation in elderly patients with COVID-19 infection. Conclusion: Prealbumin is an independent risk factor of the in-hospital mortality for COVID-19 elderly patients.

The aim of this study was to summarize and share our experience of infection control measures and corresponding outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Infection control measures, including workflow optimization, useful epidemiologic survey methods, and personal full protective clothing, were discussed. Characteristics and outcomes of emergency cases and elective cases under local and general anesthesia during the COVID-19 pandemic were summarized. RESULTS: A hierarchy of interventions were applied mainly from 4 aspects. First, administration control and online consultation significantly decreased patient attendance. Second, a triage workflow was established to identify high-/low-risk patients, with clinical manifestations (fever, fatigue, cough, nasal discharge, etc), epidemiologic survey, blood test, chest computed tomographic scan, and coronavirus test if necessary. Third, strict environmental control was adopted using increasing ventilation, isolated room for inpatients, etc. Fourth, proper rotation of healthcare staff was ensured to reduce workload and minimize possible contact. A total of 904 emergency interventions, 2561 local anesthesia, and 570 general anesthesia were performed during this period, and none of the cases/healthcare professionals were found to be infected.

Despite the high incidence of abortion around the globe, the synthesis of known economic outcomes of abortion care and policies is lacking. Using data from a systematic scoping review, we synthesized the literature on the economics of abortion at the microeconomic, mesoeconomic, and mesoeconomic levels and presented the results in a collection of studies. This article describes the history and scientific background for collection, presents the scoping review framework, and discusses the value of this knowledge base. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We conducted a scoping review using the PRISMA extension for Scoping Reviews. Studies reporting on qualitative and/or quantitative data from any world region were considered. For inclusion, studies must have examined one of the following outcomes: costs, impacts, benefits, and/or value of abortion-related care or policies. Our searches yielded 19,653 unique items, of which 365 items were included in our final inventory. Studies most often reported costs (n = 262), followed by impacts (n = 140), benefits (n = 58), and values (n = 40). Approximately one quarter (89/365) of studies contained information on the secondary outcome on stigma. Economic factors can lead to a delay in abortion care-seeking and can restrict health systems from adequately meeting the demand for abortion services. Provision of post-abortion care (PAC) services requires more resources then safe abortion services. Lack of insurance or public funding for abortion services can increase the cost of services and the overall economic impact on individuals both seeking and providing care. CONCLUSIONS: Consistent economic themes emerge from research on abortion, though evidence gaps remain that need to be addressed through more standardized methods and consideration to framing of abortion issues in economics terms. Given the highly charged political nature of abortion around the world, it is imperative that researchers continue to build the evidence base on economic outcomes of abortion services and regulations.","Moore, Brittany; van der Meulen Rodgers, Yana; Coast, Ernestina; Lattof, Samantha R.; Poss, Cheri",PLoS One,94,1

Therefore, it is important to identify whether the therapists have the required knowledge, skills and resources in order to deliver the best evidence-based practice. OBJECTIVES: The main objective of this cross-sectional study is to analyse the self-reported characteristics of behaviour, knowledge, skills and resources, opinion and barriers related to evidence-based practice among cardiopulmonary physical therapists of United Arab Emirates (UAE). METHODS: An electronic questionnaire was circulated among 60 licensed cardiopulmonary physical therapists, of either gender, practicing in UAE with a minimum experience of 1 year via e-mail. The response was further subjected to descriptive analysis. RESULTS: The rate of response was 55% (33/60). The physical therapists of cardiopulmonary disciple reported that they understand the term Evidence Based Practice and frequently update themselves through scientific papers obtained via accessing various databases. Respondents also believe that the exposure in undergraduate or postgraduate course was not sufficient. However, they were also satisfied with amount of discussions taking place regarding EBP at their work place.

However, this procedure requires separate analysis per each individual, performed in advanced centralized laboratory facilities with specialized medical personnel. In this study, an alternative approach termed “solid waste-based surveillance (SWBS)” was explored, in order to investigate SARS-CoV-2 infection in small communities through the indirect sampling of saliva left on waste. Sampling was performed at 20 different sites in Italy during the second peak of COVID-19. Three swabs were positive for SARS-CoV-2 using a published RT-qPCR protocol targeting the non-structural protein 14 region, and the viral load ranged 4.8 × 103–4.0 × 106 genome copies/swab.

However, despite the emphasis of technology integration in educational contexts, little research has examined the knowledge, skills and attitudes post-graduate pre-service teachers bring to teaching from a technology perspective. This paper presents findings from the final phase of an explanatory case study exploring the development of post-graduate pre-service teachers’ technology integration beliefs and practice during a teacher education program at an Australian university. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 17 post-graduate pre-service teachers after two professional (field) experiences. A social cognitive lens was applied to understand how technology integration beliefs and practice developed during this time. Results showed occupation-specific technology experience provided this group with a diversity of technology expertise, confidence using technology, resilience to overcome technical issues, and self-regulatory traits to learn new technology tools. Contributing personal factors influencing beliefs and practice included age, professional background, technology skills and technology self-efficacy beliefs. Initial practice revealed a predilection to integrate technology to supplement teacher-directed pedagogy. The shift towards technology integration to support student-centred pedagogy was dependent upon modelling and mentoring provisions offered by both teacher-educators and teacher-mentors during professional (field) experience placements. Other extrinsic factors, such as hardware provisions, Information Technology infrastructure, and school culture, were also instrumental in the conceptualization and realization of technology pedagogy. Recommendations include the necessity for post-graduate teacher education programs to recognise the untapped technology expertise this group may bring to teaching, and practical suggestions to support the development of meaningful technology integration epistemologies.","Rowston, Kim; Bower, Matt; Woodcock, Stuart",Int J Technol Des Educ,94,32

DESIGN: An iterative design process was employed. Laboratory evaluation included in vitro assessment of mock nasopharyngeal samples spiked with two different concentrations of gamma‐irradiated SARS‐CoV‐2. A prospective clinical study compared SARS‐CoV‐2 and human cellular material recovery by 3D‐printed swabs and standard nasopharyngeal swabs. SETTING, PARTICIPANTS: Royal Melbourne Hospital, May 2020. Participants in the clinical evaluation were 50 hospital staff members attending a COVID‐19 screening clinic and two inpatients with laboratory‐confirmed COVID‐19. INTERVENTION: In the clinical evaluation, a flocked nasopharyngeal swab sample was collected with the Copan ESwab and a mid‐nasal sample from the other nostril was collected with the 3D‐printed swab. RESULTS: In the laboratory evaluation, qualitative agreement with regard to SARS‐CoV‐2 detection in mock samples collected with 3D‐printed swabs and two standard swabs was complete. In the clinical evaluation, qualitative agreement with regard to RNase P detection (a surrogate measure of adequate collection of human cellular material) in samples collected from 50 hospital staff members with standard and 3D‐printed swabs was complete.

Regular testing of high-risk individuals (pre-existing conditions, older than 60 years of age) has been suggested by public health authorities. The WHO suggested the use of routine screening of residents, employees, and visitors of long-term care facilities (LTCF) to protect the resident risk group. Similar suggestions have been made by the WHO for other closed facilities including incarceration facilities (e.g., prisons or jails), wherein parts of the U.S., accelerated release of approved inmates is taken as a measure to mitigate COVID-19. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Here, the simulation model underlying the pandemic preparedness tool CovidSim 1.1 (http://covidsim.eu/) is extended to investigate the effect of regularly testing of employees to protect immobile resident risk groups in closed facilities. The reduction in the number of infections and deaths within the risk group is investigated. Our simulations are adjusted to reflect the situation of LTCFs in Germany, and incarceration facilities in the U.S. COVID-19 spreads in closed facilities due to contact with infected employees even under strict confinement of visitors in a pandemic scenario without targeted protective measures. Testing is only effective in conjunction with targeted contact reduction between the closed facility and the outside world—and will be most inefficient under strategies aiming for herd immunity. The frequency of testing, the quality of tests, and the waiting time for obtaining test results have noticeable effects. The exact reduction in the number of cases depends on disease prevalence in the population and the levels of contact reductions. Testing every 5 days with a good quality test and a processing time of 24 hours can lead up to a 40% reduction in the number of infections. However, the effects of testing vary substantially among types of closed facilities and can even be counterproductive in U.S. IFs. CONCLUSIONS: The introduction of COVID-19 in closed facilities is unavoidable without a thorough screening of persons that can introduce the disease into the facility. Regular testing of employees in closed facilities can contribute to reducing the number of infections there, but is only meaningful as an accompanying measure, whose economic benefit needs to be assessed carefully.","Tsoungui Obama, Henri Christian Junior; Adil Mahmoud Yousif, Nessma; Alawam Nemer, Looli; Ngougoue Ngougoue, Pierre Marie; Ngwa, Gideon Akumah; Teboh-Ewungkem, Miranda; Schneider, Kristan Alexander",PLoS One,94,26

To develop a simple, rapid, accurate, and high-throughput detection method for diagnosis and differential diagnosis on swine enteric coronaviruses, specific primers and probes were designed based on the highly conserved regions of transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) N, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) M, porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) M, and porcine enteric alphacoronavirus (PEAV) N genes respectively. A TaqMan-probe-based multiplex real-time RT-qPCR assay was developed and optimized to simultaneously detect these swine enteric coronaviruses. The results showed that the limit of detection can reach as low as 10 copies in singular real-time RT-qPCR assays and 100 copies in multiplex real-time RT-qPCR assay, with all correlation coefficients (R(2)) at above 0.99, and the amplification efficiency at between 90 and 120%.

In particular, we explored the nurses’ perception of job satisfaction in relation to the images sent back by public opinion through the mass media and social communication channels. During the first wave of Covid-19 nurses have acquired media visibility, but their feeling is represented more by the discomfort of finding themselves suddenly glorified in the face of a lack of professional, social, and economic recognition.

The infectious spread grew in leaps and bounds and forced the policymakers and governments to move towards lockdown. The lockdown further compelled people to stay under house arrest, which further resulted in an outbreak of emotions on social media platforms. Perceiving people's emotional state during these times becomes critically and strategically important for the government and the policymakers. In this regard, a novel emotion care scheme has been proposed in this paper to analyze multimodal textual data contained in real-time tweets related to COVID-19. Moreover, this paper studies 8-scale emotions (Anger, Anticipation, Disgust, Fear, Joy, Sadness, Surprise, and Trust) over multiple categories such as nature, lockdown, health, education, market, and politics. This is the first of its kind linguistic analysis on multiple modes pertaining to the pandemic to the best of our understanding. Taking India as a case study, we inferred from this textual analysis that ‘joy’ has been lesser towards everything (~9-15%) but nature (~17%) due to the apparent fact of lessened pollution. The education system entailed more trust (~29%) due to teachers' fraternity's consistent efforts. The health sector witnessed sadness (~16%) and fear (~18%) as the dominant emotions among the masses as human lives were at stake.

Resurgence of host-virus interactions in recent literature emphasizes the key role of mitochondria and host metabolism on viral life processes. Mitochondrial dysfunction leads to damage of mitochondria that generate toxic compounds, importantly mitochondrial DNA, inducing systemic toxicity, leading to damage of multiple organs in the body. Mitochondrial dynamics and mitophagy are essential for the maintenance of mitochondrial quality control and homeostasis. Therefore, metabolic antagonists may be essential to gain a better understanding of viral diseases and develop effective antiviral therapeutics.

The rotavirus nonstructural protein 4 (NSP4), an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) transmembrane glycoprotein, increases intracellular levels of cytoplasmic Ca(2+) ([Ca(2+)]cyto) through a phospholipase C-independent pathway, which is required for virus replication and morphogenesis. However, the NSP4 domain and mechanism that increases [Ca(2+)]cyto are unknown. We identified an NSP4 domain (amino acids [aa] 47 to 90) that inserts into membranes and has structural characteristics of viroporins, a class of small hydrophobic viral proteins that disrupt membrane integrity and ion homeostasis to facilitate virus entry, assembly, or release. Mutational analysis showed that NSP4 viroporin activity was mediated by an amphipathic α-helical domain downstream of a conserved lysine cluster. The lysine cluster directed integral membrane insertion of the viroporin domain and was critical for viroporin activity. In epithelial cells, expression of wild-type NSP4 increased the levels of free cytoplasmic Ca(2+) by 3.7-fold, but NSP4 viroporin mutants maintained low levels of [Ca(2+)]cyto, were retained in the ER, and failed to form cytoplasmic vesicular structures, called puncta, which surround viral replication and assembly sites in rotavirus-infected cells. When [Ca(2+)]cyto was increased pharmacologically with thapsigargin, viroporin mutants formed puncta, showing that elevation of calcium levels and puncta formation are distinct functions of NSP4 and indicating that NSP4 directly or indirectly responds to elevated cytoplasmic calcium levels. NSP4 viroporin activity establishes the mechanism for NSP4-mediated elevation of [Ca(2+)]cyto, a critical event that regulates rotavirus replication and virion assembly.","Hyser, Joseph M.; Collinson-Pautz, Matthew R.; Utama, Budi; Estes, Mary K.",mBio,94,1

SARS-CoV-2 is highly lethal in older adults (>65 years old) and in cases with underlying medical conditions, including chronic respiratory diseases, immunosuppression, and cardio-metabolic diseases, including severe obesity, diabetes, and hypertension. The course of the COVID-19 pandemic in Mexico has led to many fatal cases in younger patients attributable to cardio-metabolic conditions. Thus, in the present study, we aimed to perform an early spatial epidemiological analysis for the COVID-19 outbreak in Mexico. Firstly, to evaluate how mortality risk from COVID-19 among tested individuals (MRt) is geographically distributed and secondly, to analyze the association of spatial predictors of MRt across different states in Mexico, controlling for the severity of the disease. Among health-related variables, diabetes and obesity were positively associated with COVID-19 fatality. When analyzing Mexico as a whole, we identified that both the percentages of external and internal migration had positive associations with early COVID-19 mortality risk with external migration having the second-highest positive association. As an indirect measure of urbanicity, population density, and overcrowding in households, the physicians-to-population ratio has the highest positive association with MRt. In contrast, the percentage of individuals in the age group between 10 to 39 years had a negative association with MRt. Geographically, Quintana Roo, Baja California, Chihuahua, and Tabasco (until April 2020) had higher MRt and standardized mortality ratios, suggesting that risks in these states were above what was nationally expected.

We aimed to comprehensively characterize the viral RNA level and serum antibody responses in RP-DC patients and evaluate their viral transmission risk. Methods A population-based observational cohort study was performed on 479 DC patients discharged from February 1 to May 5, 2020 in Shenzhen, China. We conducted RT-qPCR, antibody assays, neutralisation assays, virus isolation, whole genome sequencing (WGS), and epidemiological investigation of close contacts. Findings Of 479 DC patients, the 93 (19%) RP individuals, including 36 with multiple RP results, were characterised by young age (median age: 34 years, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 29-38 years). The median discharge-to-RP length was 8 days (95% CI: 7-14 days; maximum: 90 days). After readmission, RP-DC patients exhibited mild (28%) or absent (72%) symptoms, with no disease progression. The viral RNA level in RP-DC patients ranged from 1.9-5.7 log10 copies/mL (median: 3.2, 95% CI: 3.1-3.5). At RP detection, the IgM, IgG, IgA, total antibody, and neutralising antibody (NAb) seropositivity rates in RP-DC patients were 38% (18/48), 98% (47/48), 63% (30/48), 100% (48/48), and 91% (39/43), respectively. Regarding antibody levels, there was no significant difference between RP-DC and non-RP-DC patients. The antibody level remained constant in RP-DC patients pre- and post-RP detection. Virus isolation of nine representative specimens returned negative results. WGS of six specimens yielded only genomic fragments. No clinical symptoms were exhibited by 96 close contacts of 23 RP-DC patients; their viral RNA (96/96) and antibody (20/20) test results were negative. After full recovery, 60% of patients (n=162, 78 no longer RP RP-DC and 84 non-RP-DC) had NAb titres of [≥]1:32. Interpretation RP may occur in DC patients following intermittent and non-stable excretion of low viral RNA levels. RP-DC patients pose a low risk of transmitting SARS-CoV-2. An NAb titre of [≥]1:32 may provide a reference indicator for evaluating humoral responses in COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials.","Yang, C.; Jiang, M.; Wang, X.; Tang, X.; Fang, S.; Li, H.; Zuo, L.; Jiang, Y.; Zhong, Y.; Chen, Q.; Zheng, C.; Wang, L.; Wu, S.; Wu, W.; Liu, H.; Yuan, J.; Liao, X.; Zhang, Z.; Lin, Y.; Geng, Y.; Zhang, H.; Zheng, H.; Wan, M.; Lu, L.; Ren, X.; Cui, Y.; Zou, X.; Feng, T.; Xia, J.; Yang, R.; Liu, Y.; Mei, S.; Li, B.; Yang, Z.; Hu, Q.",,94,30

The emergency systems are dealing with large number of patients in various stages of deteriorating conditions which require significant medical expertise for accurate and rapid diagnosis and treatment. This issue will become more prominent in places with lack of medical experts and state-of-the-art clinical equipment, especially in developing countries. The machine intelligence aided medical diagnosis systems can provide rapid, dependable, autonomous, and low-cost solutions for medical diagnosis in emergency conditions. In this paper, a privacy-preserving computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) framework, called Decentralized deep Emergency response Intelligence (D-EI), which provides secure machine learning based medical diagnosis on the cloud is proposed. The proposed framework provides a blockchain based decentralized machine learning solution to aid the health providers with medical diagnosis in emergency conditions. The D-EI uses blockchain smart contracts to train the CAD machine learning models using all the data on the medical cloud while preserving the privacy of patients’ records. Using the proposed framework, the data of each patient helps to increase the overall accuracy of the CAD model by balancing the diagnosis datasets with minority classes and special cases. As a case study, the D-EI is demonstrated as a solution for COVID-19 diagnosis. The D-EI framework can help in pandemic management by providing rapid and accurate diagnosis in overwhelming medical workload conditions.","Peyvandi, Amirhossein; Majidi, Babak; Peyvandi, Soodeh; Patra, Jagdish",New Gener Comput,94,1

Existing reports mainly focus on in-hospital and intensive care unit mortality in patient cohorts usually not representative of the population with the highest mortality, i.e. the very old and frail patients. Accordingly, little is known about the risk patterns related to body mass and nutrition in very old patients. Our aim was to assess the relationship between body mass index (BMI), nutritional status and in-geriatric hospital mortality among geriatric patients treated for COVID-19. As a reference, the analyses were performed also in patients treated for other diagnoses than COVID-19. METHODS: We analyzed up to 10,031 geriatric patients with a median age of 83 years of which 1409 (14%) were hospitalized for COVID-19 and 8622 (86%) for other diagnoses in seven geriatric hospitals in the Stockholm region, Sweden during March 2020–January 2021. Data were available in electronic hospital records. The associations between 1) BMI and 2) nutritional status, assessed using the Mini-Nutritional Assessment - Short Form (MNA-SF) scale, and short-term in-geriatric hospital mortality were performed using logistic regression. RESULTS: After adjusting for age, sex, comorbidity, polypharmacy, frailty and the wave of the pandemic (first vs. second), underweight defined as BMI<18.5 increased the risk of in-hospital mortality in COVID-19 patients (odds ratio [OR] = 2.30; confidence interval [CI] = 1.17–4.31). Overweight and obesity were not associated with in-hospital mortality. Malnutrition; i.e. MNA-SF 0–7 points, increased the risk of in-hospital mortality in patients treated for COVID-19 (OR = 2.03; CI = 1.16–3.68) and other causes (OR = 6.01; CI = 2.73–15.91). CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that obesity is not a risk factor for very old patients with COVID-19, but emphasize the role of underweight and malnutrition for in-hospital mortality in geriatric patients with COVID-19.","Kananen, L.; Eriksdotter, M.; Boström, A.M.; Kivipelto, M.; Annetorp, M.; Metzner, C.; Bäck Jerlardtz, V.; Engström, M.; Johnson, P.; Lundberg, L.G.; Åkesson, E.; Sühl Öberg, C.; Hägg, S.; Religa, D.; Jylhävä, J.; Cederholm, T.",Clin Nutr,94,20

Here we investigated the relative efficiency of aerosol transmission of two variants of SARS-CoV-2, B.1.1.7 (alpha) and lineage A, in the Syrian hamster. A novel transmission caging setup was designed and validated, which allowed the assessment of transmission efficiency at various distances. At 2 meters distance, only particles <5 μm traversed between cages. In this setup, aerosol transmission was confirmed in 8 out of 8 (N = 4 for each variant) sentinels after 24 hours of exposure as demonstrated by respiratory shedding and seroconversion. Successful transmission occurred even when exposure time was limited to one hour, highlighting the efficiency of this transmission route. Interestingly, the B.1.1.7 variant outcompeted the lineage A variant in an airborne transmission chain after mixed infection of donors. Combined, this data indicates that the infectious dose of B.1.1.7 required for successful transmission may be lower than that of lineage A virus. The experimental proof for true aerosol transmission and the increase in the aerosol transmission potential of B.1.1.7 underscore the continuous need for assessment of novel variants and the development or preemptive transmission mitigation strategies.","Port, Julia R.; Yinda, Claude Kwe; Avanzato, Victoria A.; Schulz, Jonathan E.; Holbrook, Myndi G.; van Doremalen, Neeltje; Shaia, Carl; Fischer, Robert J.; Munster, Vincent J.",bioRxiv,94,33

The recent outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in South Korea and the continuing reports of MERS-CoV cases from Saudi Arabia highlight the need for active surveillance for MERS-CoV in returning pilgrims or travellers from the Middle East. Public Health England Birmingham Laboratory (PHEBL) is one of a few selected UK public health laboratories responsible for MERS-CoV screening in travellers returning to the UK from the Middle East who present to hospital with severe respiratory symptoms. The results of the PHEBL MERS-CoV screening and surveillance over the past 3 years is presented. METHODS: UK travellers/pilgrims who returned from the Middle East and presented to a hospital with respiratory symptoms were studied over the period February 1, 2013 to December 31, 2015. Patients with respiratory symptoms, who satisfied the Public Health England MERS-CoV case algorithm, were tested for MERS-CoV and other respiratory tract viruses on admission to hospital. RESULTS: Two hundred and two patients suspected of having MERS-CoV were tested. None of them had a laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV infection. A viral aetiology was detected in half (50.3%) of the cases, with rhinoviruses, influenza A (H1N1 and H3N2), and influenza B being most frequent. Peak testing occurred following the annual Hajj season and in other periods of raised national awareness. CONCLUSIONS: Respiratory tract infections in travellers/pilgrims returning to the UK from the Middle East are mainly due to rhinoviruses, influenza A, and influenza B. Whilst MERS-CoV was not detected in the 202 patients studied, heightened awareness of the possibility of MERS-CoV and continuous proactive surveillance are essential to rapidly identify cases of MERS-CoV and other seasonal respiratory tract viruses such as avian influenza, in patients presenting to hospital. Early identification and isolation may prevent outbreaks in nosocomial settings.","Atabani, Sowsan F.; Wilson, Steven; Overton-Lewis, Clare; Workman, Judith; Kidd, I.

We focus on the role of social relationships, stress, and stress reduction in relation to perinatal mental health; the role of HAI in perceptions of social support, stressors, and stress reduction; and gaps in empirical knowledge concerning the role of HAI in perinatal mental health. Finally, we integrate contemporary biobehavioral models of perinatal mental health and HAI (i.e., Comprehensive Model of Mental Health during the Perinatal Period and the HAI–HPA Transactional Model) to propose a new conceptual framework that depicts ways in which HAI during the perinatal period may influence maternal and child health and wellbeing. To our knowledge, this is the first paper to consider the role of HAI in biobehavioral responses and mental health during the perinatal period.

Here, based on known physical properties of such 3-D instabilities, we propose a simple, energy-conserving model describing this situation. It consists of a 2D point-vortex flow coupled to localized 3D perturbations (ergophages), such that ergophages can gain energy by altering vortex-vortex distances through an induced divergent velocity field, thus decreasing point-vortex energy. We investigate the model in three distinct stages of evolution: (i) The linear regime, where the ergophage amplitude grows or decays exponentially on average, with a randomly fluctuating instantaneous growth rate. The growth rate has a small auto-correlation time, and follows a probability distribution featuring a power-law tail with exponent between -2 and -5/3 (up to a cut-off), depending on the point-vortex base flow. Consequently, the logarithmic ergophage amplitude performs a free L\'evy flight. (ii) The passive-nonlinear regime of the model, where the 2D flow evolves independently of the ergophage amplitudes, which saturate by non-linear self-interactions without affecting the 2D flow. In this regime the system exhibits a new type of on-off intermittency that we name L\'evy on-off intermittency, and which we study in a companion paper. We compute the bifurcation diagram for the mean and variance of the perturbation amplitude, as well as the probability density of the perturbation amplitude. (iii) Finally, we characterize the the fully nonlinear regime, where ergophages feed back on the 2D flow, and study how the vortex temperature is altered by the interaction with ergophages. It is shown that when the amplitude of the ergophages is sufficiently large, the 2D flow saturates to a zero-temperature state.

With more COVID-19 vaccines expecting approval in the coming months, it is necessary to note that vaccine availability does not equate to vaccine accessibility, nor vaccine efficacy.

For higher-income countries, such as the United States, the prevalence of vaccine hesitancy may further compound the situation. These insights combined, in turn, emphasize the fact that even though COVID-19 vaccines are becoming more available, safety measures (e.g., face masks, personal hygiene, and social distancing) are still of pivotal importance in protecting personal and public health against COVID-19.

The disease has re-emerged in Egypt since 2011; however, there is a paucity of recent epidemiological data available. Therefore, in this study, we employed a cross-sectional study to determine DF prevalence in humans and camels in Asyut and Sohag Governorates, Egypt, during 2019. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 91 humans and a similar number of dromedary camels were utilized in this study. Sera were obtained and analyzed for the presence of specific antibodies against DF virus using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Related epidemiological data affecting the disease spread in humans and camels were recorded and statistically analyzed. RESULTS: The seroprevalence of DF in humans and camels was 12.09% and 3.3%, respectively. The disease varied significantly by the species examined as humans were found to be at a higher risk of acquiring the infection compared to camels. Nearly equal odds of exposure (odds ratio [OR]) were seen in the individuals with close contact with camels compared to those without; however, individuals exposed to mosquitoes were at approximately 3 times higher risk of infection (OR=2.95 [95% confidence interval [CI], 0.73-11.93]) compared to individuals who were not exposed to mosquitoes (OR=0.033 [95% CI, 0.084-1.37]). Interestingly, DF seropositivity in camels was significantly related to the presence or absence of symptoms within 2 weeks before sampling (p=0.02) where symptomatic animals had higher odds of exposure (OR=19.51 [95%, 0.97-392.3]) compared to asymptomatic ones (OR=0.05 [95%, 0.002-1.03]). CONCLUSION: The current study reports the presence of specific antibodies against dengue virus (DENV) in humans residing within Asyut and Sohag Governorates, Egypt. Furthermore, it provides the first serological evidence of DENV circulation in camels which is alarming. A more comprehensive study is needed; however, this baseline investigation underscores the urgent need for increasing awareness among people residing in the area as well as application of the appropriate mosquito control measures to avoid further spread of the disease.","Hussen, Mostafa Osman; Sayed, Amal S.

No drug for prevention or treatment in earlier stages of COVID-19 are yet found; although several new candidates including ivermectin, dutasteride, baricitinib, budesonide and colchicine are being studied with some early promising results. Safe and effective treatments will need to be both affordable and widely available globally. Objectives This analysis will estimate and compare potential generic production costs of a selection of COVID-19 drug candidates with international list prices. Methods Costs of production for new and potential COVID-19 drugs (dexamethasone, ivermectin, dutasteride, budesonide, baricitinib, tocilizumab, sarilumab and colchicine) were estimated using active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) data extracted from global shipping records. This was compared with national pricing data from low, medium, and high-income countries. Annual API export volumes from India were used to estimate the current availability of each drug. Results Repurposed therapies can be generically manufactured at very low per-course costs: ranging from $2.58 for IV dexamethasone (or $0.19 orally) to $0.12 for ivermectin. No export price data was available for baricitinib, tocilizumab or sarilumab. When compared against international list prices, we found wide variations between countries. Drug API availability was generally good, with colchicine being the most available with sufficient annual API exported for 59.8 million treatment courses. Conclusions Successful management of COVID-19 will require equitable access to treatment for all populations, not just those able to pay high prices. Analysed drugs are widely available and affordable, whilst IV treatment courses are more expensive.","Wang, J.; Levi, J.; Ellis, L.; Hill, A.",,94,16

Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of the macroeconomic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 using key indicators of the Spanish economy for the 17 Autonomous Communities (ACs) of the country. National statistics were examined in the search for impacts or anomalies occurring since the beginning of the pandemic. To estimate the strength of the impact on each of the indicators analyzed, we used Bayesian structural time series. We also calculated the correlation between the rate of GDP decline during 2020 and the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases per 100,000 inhabitants in the ACs. Results: In 2020, the cumulative impact on the gross domestic product was of −11.41% (95% credible interval: −13.46; −9.29). The indicator for business turnover changed by −9.37% (−12.71; −6.07). The Spanish employment market was strongly affected; our estimates showed a cumulative increase of 11.9% (4.27; 19.45) in the rate of unemployment during 2020. The worst indicators were recorded in the ACs most economically dependent on the services sector. There was no statistical association between the incidence of COVID-19 in 2020 and the fall in GDP in the ACs. Conclusions: Our estimates portray a dramatic situation in Spain, where the COVID-19 crisis has had more serious economic and health consequences than in other European countries. The productive system in Spain is too dependent on sectors vulnerable to the pandemic, and it is necessary to design and implement profound changes through the European Next Generation program.","Pinilla, Jaime; Barber, Patricia; Vallejo-Torres, Laura; Rodríguez-Mireles, Silvia; López-Valcárcel, Beatriz G.; Serra-Majem, Luis",Int J Environ Res Public Health,94,20

The 2009 Hajj took place during the influenza A (H1N1) pandemic. This study investigates factors associated with compliance with recommended influenza A (H1N1)-related health practices and behaviors among American pilgrims to the 2009 Hajj: receiving seasonal influenza vaccinations, receiving influenza A (H1N1) vaccinations, and behaviors intended to mitigate respiratory illness. METHODS American residents from Minnesota and Michigan completed anonymous surveys prior to and following travel to the 2009 Hajj. Surveys assessed demographics; knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) related to influenza A (H1N1); seasonal and H1N1 vaccinations; health-seeking behaviors; sources of health information; and protective behaviors during the Hajj. RESULTS Pre- and post-travel surveys were completed by 186 participants. Receiving seasonal influenza vaccination was reported by 138 (63%) respondents, and 80 (36%) reported receiving an influenza A (H1N1) vaccine. One hundred forty-four (79%) respondents reported engaging in protective behaviors during the Hajj to prevent illness. In multivariable models, greater perceived severity of influenza A (H1N1) before traveling was associated with: seasonal influenza vaccination (OR=1.74, 95% CI=1.14-2.62, p=.01), influenza A (H1N1) vaccination (OR=2.02, 95% CI=1.35-3.02, p=.001), and engaging in protective behaviors during the Hajj (OR=1.62, 95% CI=1.00-2.63, p=.003). CONCLUSIONS This study found that accurate knowledge of influenza A (H1N1) symptoms, transmission, and prevention was associated with greater perceived severity of influenza A (H1N1); and perceived influenza A (H1N1) severity was associated with engaging in recommended protective health practices. Understanding the barriers to and facilitators of compliance with recommended behaviors can help guide the development of tailored outreach strategies to mitigate the impact and spread of respiratory disease.","Balaban, V.; Stauffer, W.; Hammad, A.; Afgarshe, M.; Abd-Alla, M.; Ahmed, Q.; Memish, Z.; Saba, J.; Harton, E.; Palumbo, G.; Marano, N.",J Epidemiol Glob Health,94,30

METHODS: We retrospectively report on 1061 SARS-CoV-2 positive tested patients treated with HCQ (200 mg three times daily for ten days) + AZ (500 mg on day 1 followed by 250 mg daily for the next four days) for at least three days. Outcomes were death, clinical worsening (transfer to ICU, and >10 day hospitalization) and viral shedding persistence (>10 days). RESULTS: A total of 1061 patients were included in this analysis (46.4% male, mean age 43.6 years – range 14–95 years). Good clinical outcome and virological cure were obtained in 973 patients within 10 days (91.7%). Prolonged viral carriage was observed in 47 patients (4.4%) and was associated to a higher viral load at diagnosis (p < .001) but viral culture was negative at day 10. All but one, were PCR-cleared at day 15. A poor clinical outcome (PClinO) was observed for 46 patients (4.3%) and 8 died (0.75%) (74–95 years old). All deaths resulted from respiratory failure and not from cardiac toxicity. Five patients are still hospitalized (98.7% of patients cured so far). PClinO was associated with older age (OR 1.11), severity at admission (OR 10.05) and low HCQ serum concentration. PClinO was independently associated with the use of selective beta-blocking agents and angiotensin II receptor blockers (p < .05). A total of 2.3% of patients reported mild adverse events (gastrointestinal or skin symptoms, headache, insomnia and transient blurred vision). CONCLUSION: Administration of the HCQ+AZ combination before COVID-19 complications occur is safe and associated with very low fatality rate in patients.","Million, Matthieu; Lagier, Jean-Christophe; Gautret, Philippe; Colson, Philippe; Fournier, Pierre-Edouard; Amrane, Sophie; Hocquart, Marie; Mailhe, Morgane; Esteves-Vieira, Vera; Doudier, Barbara; Aubry, Camille; Correard, Florian; Giraud-Gatineau, Audrey; Roussel, Yanis; Berenger, Cyril; Cassir, Nadim; Seng, Piseth; Zandotti, Christine; Dhiver, Catherine; Ravaux, Isabelle; Tomei, Christelle; Eldin, Carole; Tissot-Dupont, Hervé; Honoré, Stéphane; Stein, Andreas; Jacquier, Alexis; Deharo, Jean-Claude; Chabrière, Eric; Levasseur, Anthony; Fenollar, Florence; Rolain, Jean-Marc; Obadia, Yolande; Brouqui, Philippe; Drancourt, Michel; La Scola, Bernard; Parola, Philippe; Raoult, Didier",Travel Med Infect Dis,94,20

However, the kinetics of the humoral response against SARS-CoV-2 remains poorly described and relies on the performance of the different serological tests. METHODS: In this study, we evaluated the performance of six CE-marked point-of-care tests (POC) and three ELISA assays for the diagnosis of COVID-19 by exploring seroconversions in hospitalized patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. RESULTS: Both the ELISA and POC tests were able to detect SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in at least half of the samples collected seven days or more after the onset of symptoms. After 15 days, the rate of detection rose to over 80% but without reaching 100%, irrespective of the test used. More than 90% of the samples collected after 15 days tested positive using the iSIA and Accu-Tell® POC tests and the ID.Vet IgG ELISA assay. Seroconversion was observed 5 to 12 days after the onset of symptoms. Three assays suffer from a specificity below 90% (EUROIMMUN IgG and IgA, UNscience, Zhuhai Livzon). CONCLUSIONS: The second week of COVID-19 seems to be the best period for assessing the sensitivity of commercial serological assays. To achieve an early diagnosis of COVID-19 based on antibody detection, a dual challenge must be met: the immunodiagnostic window period must be shortened and an optimal specificity must be conserved.","Tuaillon, E; Bolloré, K; Pisoni, A; Debiesse, S; Renault, C; Marie, S; Groc, S; Niels, C; Pansu, N; Dupuy, AM; Morquin, D; Foulongne, V; Bourdin, A; Le Moing, V; Van de Perre, P",J Infect,94,17

We aimed to investigate the association between age, frailty, and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in hospitalized middle-aged and older adults. METHODS: Longitudinal observational study comprising 711 patients aged ≥50 years consecutively admitted to a university hospital dedicated to COVID-19 severe cases, between March and May 2020. We reviewed electronic medical records to collect data on demographics, comorbidities, COVID-19 signs/symptoms, and laboratory findings on admission. We defined frailty using the Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS=1-9; frail ≥5). We also documented in-hospital mortality. We used logistic regressions to explore associations between age, frailty, and COVID-19 signs/symptoms; and between typical symptoms (fever, cough, dyspnea) and mortality. RESULTS: Participants had a mean age of 66±11 years, and 43% were female. Overall, 25% were frail, and 37% died. The most common COVID-19 presentations were dyspnea (79%), cough (74%), and fever (62%), but patients aged ≥65 years were less likely to have a co-occurrence of typical symptoms, both in the absence (OR=0.56; 95%CI=0.39-0.79) and in the presence of frailty (OR=0.52; 95%CI=0.34-0.81). In contrast, older age and frailty were associated with unspecific presentations, including functional decline, acute mental change, and hypotension. After adjusting for age, sex, and frailty, reporting fever was associated with lower odds of mortality (OR=0.70; 95%CI=0.50-0.97). CONCLUSIONS: Atypical COVID-19 presentations are common in frail and older hospitalized patients. Providers should be aware of unspecific disease manifestations during the management and follow-up of this population.","Poco, Paula Cristina Eiras; Aliberti, Márlon Juliano Romero; Dias, Murilo Bacchini; Takahashi, Silvia de Fatima; Leonel, Fabio Campos; Altona, Marcelo; Azevedo, Amanda Lagreca Venys; Shin-Ike, Isabela Akie; Garcia, Bianca Aparecida; Sumita, Leticia Harumi; Lima, Lara Mune de Oliveira; Garcez, Flavia Barreto; Avelino Silva, Thiago J",J Gerontol A Biol Sci Med Sci,94,20

METHOD: In this descriptive study, the survey was administered online to CPs in all regions of Turkey. The frequency of their provision of patient counselling, provision of medication information and practices towards precautions during the pandemic were evaluated based on CP self-reports. The Turkish version of the Burnout Measure Short Form was used, and a 30-item questionnaire based on the 12-domain Theoretical Domains Framework was developed to determine CPs' perceived enablers of and barriers to pharmaceutical service delivery during the COVID-19 pandemic. Data were collected using convenience sampling methods. Besides internal consistency reliability, principal component analysis, and correlation analysis, Mann-Whitney U-test was conducted in group comparisons. RESULTS: A total of 1098 complete responses were received, for a response rate of 4.11% among 26 747 CPs. The CPs' median burnout score was 3.3 (2.5-4.2). More than half of the CPs (54.5%) referred probable patients with COVID-19 to the hospital. Commonly delivered cognitive CP-led services included preventive health services (89.5%) and medication information services (86.3%). Perceived barriers to delivering pharmaceutical services were a lack of environmental resources and support and a lack of innovation in pharmaceutical services. Perceived enablers were CPs' knowledge, skills, self-confidence, actions, impacts, emotions and perceived behavioural control. CONCLUSION: To increase the preparedness of pharmacists for future pandemics or disasters, this study highlighted CP-led cognitive services, precautions taken related to COVID-19, perceived enablers and barriers and burnout during the COVID-19 pandemic. Pharmaceutical services guidelines that could be followed during a pandemic or other disaster should be designed by addressing these findings.","Okuyan, Betul; Bektay, Muhammed Yunus; Kingir, Zehra Betul; Save, Dilsad; Sancar, Mesut",Int J Clin Pract,94,22

Patients with confirmed COVID-19 ( n = 430) hospitalized between March 18 and April 21, 2020 were divided in derivation ( n = 310) and validation ( n = 120) cohorts. Two groups became evident: (1) good prognosis group (G-group) with patients hospitalized at the conventional COVID-19 ward and (2) Worsening disease group (W-group) with patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) from the emergency departments. The study end point was disease worsening (acute respiratory failure, shock, myocardial dysfunction, bacterial or viral coinfections, and acute kidney injury) requiring ICU admission. All patients were routinely evaluated for full blood count, prothrombin time, fibrinogen, D-dimers, antithrombin (AT), and protein C activity. Data from the first hospitalization day at the conventional ward or the ICU were analyzed. Cardiovascular risk factors and comorbidities were routinely registered. Obesity, hypertension, diabetes and male gender, increased fibrinogen and D-dimers, thrombocytopenia, AT deficiency, lymphopenia, and an International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) score for compensated disseminated intravascular coagulation score (cDIC-ISTH) ≥ 5 were significant risk factors for worsening disease. The COMPASS-COVID-19 score was derived from multivariate analyses and includes obesity, gender, hemoglobin, lymphocyte, and the cDIC-ISTH score (including platelet count, prothrombin time, D-dimers, AT, and protein C levels). The score has a very good discriminating capacity to stratify patients at high and low risk for worsening disease, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve value of 0.77, a sensitivity of 81%, and a specificity of 60%. Application of the COMPASS-COVID-19 score at the validation cohort showed 96% sensitivity. The COMPASS-COVID-19 score is an accurate clinical decision-making tool for an easy identification of COVID-19 patients being at high risk for disease worsening.","Gerotziafas, Grigoris T.; Sergentanis, Theodoros N.; Voiriot, Guillaume; Lassel, Ludovic; Papageorgiou, Chryssa; Elabbadi, Alexandre; Turpin, Matthieu; Vandreden, Patrick; Papageorgiou, Loula; Psaltopoulou, Theodora; Terpos, Evangelos; Dimopoulos, Meletios-Athanasios; Parrot, Antoine; Cadranel, Jacques; Pialoux, Gilles; Fartoukh, Muriel; Elalamy, Ismail",Thromb Haemost,94,16

In addition, weak activation of Akt cannot prevent SARS-CoV infection-induced apoptosis in Vero E6 cells. In the present study, we demonstrated that signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 3, which is constitutively phosphorylated at tyrosine (Tyr)-705 and slightly phosphorylated at serine (Ser)-727 in Vero E6 cells, was dephosphorylated at Tyr-705 on SARS-CoV infection. In addition to phosphorylation of p38 MAPK in virus-infected cells, other MAPKs, i.e., extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), were phosphorylated. Although inhibitors of ERK1/2 and JNK (PD98059 and SP600125) had no effect on phosphorylation status of STAT3, inhibitors of p38 MAPK (SB203580 and SB202190) partially inhibited dephosphorylation of STAT3 at Tyr-705. Tyr-705-phosphorylated STAT3 was localized mainly in the nucleus in mock infected cells, whereas STAT3 disappeared from the nucleus in virus-infected cells. As STAT3 acts as an activator of transcription in the nucleus, these results suggest that STAT3 lacks its activity on transcription in SARS-CoV-infected Vero E6 cells.","Mizutani, Tetsuya; Fukushi, Shuetsu; Murakami, Masaaki; Hirano, Toshio; Saijo, Masayuki; Kurane, Ichiro; Morikawa, Shigeru",FEBS Lett,94,20

In this study, we evaluated factors that impact stigma for PWE involved in evolution and maintenance to report changes in the public awareness and cultural practices. We performed a cross-sectional study in which data were collected from a self-administered electronic survey composed of 33 items targeting the population in the Aseer region. Feedback response was obtained from 937 respondents. Of these, 921 participants (98.3%) had heard or read about the disorder previously. Approximately 84.8% believed that epilepsy was one of the brain disorders. 95.8% disagreed that epilepsy was due to a contagious disease. However, 40.1% of the responders were convinced that it was the result of a spiritual reason. Still, more than 9% believed treating PWE should be approached spiritually. About 75% felt that epilepsy could be the results of a test delievered by God. In addition to the clinical impact from seizures in PWE, it carries a social label and public stigma that influences one's social prognosis. Raising awareness through campaigns would improve the knowledge and practices of the population and hence provide a healthier environment for PWE, alleviating feelings of stigma, and improving their quality of life.","Abdel Ghaffar, Nawal F.; Asiri, Reem N.; AL-Eitan, Laith N.; Alamri, Reem S.; Alshyarba, Reem M.; Alrefeidi, Faris A.; Asiri, Ashwag; Alghamdi, Mansour A.",Epilepsy Behav Rep,94,1

Neutrophils are first responders to external threats, and they use different mechanisms to control pathogens. Phagocytosis, reactive oxygen species, and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are some of the mechanisms that neutrophils utilize to fight pathogens. Although there is some controversy as to whether NETs are in fact beneficial or detrimental to the host, it mainly depends on the biological context. NETs can contribute to disease pathogenesis in certain types of diseases, while they are also undeniably critical components of the innate immune response. On the contrary, the role of eosinophils during host immune responses remains to be better elucidated. Eosinophils play an important role during helminthic infections and allergic responses. Eosinophils can function as effector cells in viral respiratory infections, gut bacterial infections, and as modulators of immune responses by driving the balance between Th1 and Th2 responses. In particular, eosinophils have biological activities that appear to be quite similar to those of neutrophils. Both possess bactericidal activity, can activate proinflammatory responses, can modulate adaptive immune responses, can form extracellular traps, and can be beneficial or detrimental to the host according to the underlying pathology. In this review we compare these two cell types with a focus on highlighting their numerous similarities related to extracellular traps.","Williams, Tyler L.; Rada, Balázs; Tandon, Eshaan; Gestal, Monica C.",Microorganisms,94,16

The risk of hematoma associated with intraoperative ketorolac is low, but whether concomitant routine discharge with NSAIDs increases the risk of hematoma is unclear. METHODS: We retrospectively identified patients who underwent lumpectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB), and compared the 30-day risk of hematoma between patients discharged with opioids (opioid period: January 2018–August 2018) and patients discharged with NSAIDs with or without opioids (NSAID period: January 2019–April 2020). The association between study period and hematoma risk was assessed using multivariable models. Covariates included intraoperative ketorolac, home aspirin, and race/ethnicity. During the NSAID period, a survey was used to assess analgesic consumption on postoperative days 1–5. RESULTS: In total, 2724 patients were identified: 858 (31%) in the opioid period and 1866 (69%) in the NSAID period. In the NSAID period, 867 (46%) received NSAIDs and opioids, and 999 (54%) received NSAIDs only. Receipt of intraoperative ketorolac was higher in the NSAID period (78 vs. 64%, P < 0.001). The risks of any hematoma (4.1 vs. 3.6%, P = 0.6) and reoperation for bleeding (0.5 vs. 0.6%, P = 0.8) were similar between groups. Study period was not associated with hematoma risk (odds ratio 0.87, 95% confidence interval 0.56–1.35, P = 0.5). Among survey respondents (41%), nonopioid analgesic consumption did not increase after opioids were removed from the discharge regimen (median, 6 pills/group, P = 0.06). CONCLUSIONS: NSAIDs are associated with a low risk of hematoma after lumpectomy and SLNB, and should be prescribed instead of opioids, unless contraindicated.","Pawloski, Kate R.; Matar, Regina; Sevilimedu, Varadan; Tadros, Audree B.; Kirstein, Laurie J.; Cody, Hiram S.; Van Zee, Kimberly J.; Morrow, Monica; Moo, Tracy-Ann",Ann Surg Oncol,94,16

It is vital to understand what is causing this: worries over potential adversities due to the pandemic, or the toll of experiencing adverse events. METHODS: We used panel data from 41 909 UK adults in the COVID-19 Social Study assessed weekly from 1 April 2020 to 12 May 2020 to study the association between adversities and anxiety and depressive symptoms. We studied six categories of adversity including both worries and experiences of: illness with COVID-19, financial difficulty, loss of paid work, difficulties acquiring medication, difficulties accessing food, and threats to personal safety. Anxiety and depression were measured using the 7-item Generalised Anxiety Disorder Assessment and the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire. We used fixed-effect regression models to account for time-invariant confounders. RESULTS: Cumulative number of worries and experience of adversities were both related to higher levels of anxiety and depression. A number of worries were associated more with anxiety than depression, but number of experiences were equally related to anxiety and depression. There were clear associations between specific worries and poorer mental health. There was weak evidence that individuals of lower socio-economic position were more negatively affected psychologically by the adverse experiences. CONCLUSION: Measures over the first few weeks of lockdown in the UK appear to have been insufficient at reassuring people given that we see clear associations with mental health and cumulative worries. Interventions are required that seek to prevent adverse events (eg, redundancies) and reassure individuals and support adaptive coping strategies.","Wright, Liam; Steptoe, Andrew; Fancourt, Daisy",J Epidemiol Community Health,94,14

As OHCA outcomes are markedly improved when BLS maneuvers are swiftly applied, a “first-responder” system was introduced in 2019. When emergency dispatchers identify a possible OHCA, first responders receive an alert message on a specific app (Save-a-Life) installed on their smartphones. Those nearest to the victim and immediately available are sent the exact location of the intervention. First-year medical students only have limited knowledge regarding BLS procedures but might nevertheless need to take care of OHCA victims. Medical students responding to out-of-hospital emergencies are off-duty in half of these situations, and offering junior medical students the opportunity to enlist as first responders might therefore not only improve OHCA outcomes but also foster a greater recognition of the role medical students can hold in our society. OBJECTIVE: Our aim is to determine whether providing first-year medical students with a short intervention followed by an interactive e-learning module can motivate them to enlist as first responders. METHODS: After obtaining the approval of the regional ethics committee and of the vice-dean for undergraduate education of the University of Geneva Faculty of Medicine (UGFM), 2 senior medical students will present the project to their first-year colleagues at the beginning of a lecture. First-year students will then be provided with a link to an interactive e-learning module which has been designed according to the Swiss Resuscitation Council’s first aid guidelines. After answering a first questionnaire and completing the module, students will be able to register for practice sessions. Those attending and successfully completing these sessions will receive a training certificate which will enable them to enlist as first responders. The primary outcome will be the proportion of first-year medical students enlisting as first responders at the end of the study period. Secondary outcomes will be the proportion of first-year medical students electing to register on the platform, to begin the e-learning module, to complete the e-learning module, to register for practice sessions, to attend the practice sessions, and to obtain a certificate. The reasons given by medical students for refusing to participate will be analyzed. We will also assess how comfortable junior medical students would feel to be integrated into the first responders system at the end of the training program and whether it affects the registration rate. RESULTS: The regional ethics committee (Req-2020-01143) and the UGFM vice-dean for undergraduate education have given their approval to the realization of this study, which is scheduled to begin in January 2021.

There are limited reports describing the clinical features of COVID-19 in an IBD population, and the impact of immunosuppression on the severity of the infection remains unclear. CASE REPORT: A 33-year-old female patient with a long history of ulcerative colitis, poorly controlled, was admitted with COVID-19 a few days after being discharged from the hospital for treatment of acute severe ulcerative colitis. High-risk factors for COVID-19 complications, i.e., high-dose steroids (40 mg prednisone) and severe active disease, were present at admission. Despite the development of extensive pulmonary involvement, the patient had a favorable outcome. DISCUSSION: Management of IBD patients during the COVID-19 pandemic has been challenging. Measures to minimize the potential risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, including strict social distancing and self-isolation, in the IBD population have been recommended, especially for high-risk patients. Although steroid tapering and persistence of biologics are advised by professional groups, the best treatment strategy for IBD patients presenting a flare during the outbreak has yet to be defined.","Garcia, Karoline Soares; Moutinho, Bruna Damásio; de Azevedo, Matheus Freitas Cardoso; Queiroz, Natalia Sousa Freitas; Milani, Luciane Reis; Sanches, Lucas Navarro; Barros, Luisa Leite; Oba, Jane; Carlos, Alexandre de Sousa; Damião, Aderson Omar Mourão Cintra; Sipahi, Aytan Miranda",Inflamm Intest Dis,94,1

AIM: To describe the clinical aspects and outcomes of COVID-19 among KT recipients. METHODS: This multicenter cohort study enrolled 1,680 KT recipients diagnosed with COVID-19 between March and November 2020, from 35 Brazilian centers. The main outcome was the 90-day cumulative incidence of death, for the entire cohort and according to acute kidney injury (AKI) and renal replacement therapy (RRT) requirement. Fatality rates were analyzed according to hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and mechanical ventilation (MV) requirement. Multivariable analysis was performed by logistic regression for the probability of hospitalization and death. RESULTS: The median age of the recipients was 51.3 years, 60.4% were men and 11.4% were Afro-Brazilian. Comorbidities were reported in 1,489 (88.6%), and the interval between transplantation and infection was 5.9 years. The most frequent symptoms were cough (54%), myalgia (40%), dyspnea (37%), and diarrhea (31%), whereas the clinical signs were fever (61%) and hypoxemia (13%). Hospitalization was required in 65.1%, and immunosuppressive drugs adjustments were made in 74.4% of in-hospital patients. ICU admission was required in 34.6% and MV in 24.9%. In the multivariable modeling, the variables related with the probability of hospitalization were age, hypertension, previous cardiovascular disease, recent use of high dose of steroid, and fever, dyspnea, diarrhea, and nausea or vomiting as COVID-19 symptoms. On the other hand, the variables that reduced the probability of hospitalization were time of COVID-19 symptoms, and nasal congestion, headache, arthralgia and anosmia as COVID-19 symptoms. The overall 90-day cumulative incidence of death was 21.0%. The fatality rates were 31.6%, 58.2%, and 75.5% in those who were hospitalized, admitted to the ICU, and required MV, respectively. At the time of infection, 23.2% had AKI and 23.4% required RRT in the follow-up. The cumulative incidence of death was significantly higher among recipients with AKI (36.0% vs. 19.1%, P < 0.0001) and in those who required RRT (70.8% vs. 10.1%, P < 0.0001). The variables related with the probability of death within 90 days after COVID-19 were age, time after transplantation, presence of hypertension, previous cardiovascular disease, use of tacrolimus and mycophenolate, recent use of high dose of steroids, and dyspnea as COVID-19 symptom. On the other hand, the variables that reduced the risk of death were time of symptoms, and headache and anosmia as COVID-19 symptoms. CONCLUSION: The patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were long-term KT recipients and most of them had some comorbidities. One in every five patients died, and the rate of death was significantly higher in those with AKI, mainly when RRT was required.","Requião-Moura, Lúcio R.; de Sandes-Freitas, Tainá Veras; Viana, Laila Almeida; Cristelli, Marina Pontello; de Andrade, Luis Gustavo Modelli; Garcia, Valter Duro; de Oliveira, Claudia Maria Costa; Esmeraldo, Ronaldo de Matos; Abbud Filho, Mario; Pacheco-Silva, Alvaro; Sousa, Katia Cronemberger; Vicari, Alessandra Rosa; Costa, Kellen Micheline Alves Henrique; Simão, Denise Rodrigues; de Sousa, Marcos Vinicius; Campos, Juliana Bastos; Almeida, Ricardo Augusto Monteiro de Barros; Deboni, Luciane Mônica; Neto, Miguel Moysés; Zanocco, Juliana Aparecida; Tedesco-Silva, Helio; Medina-Pestana, José",PLoS One,94,21

Despite these efforts, SARS-CoV-2 infections remain unmanageable in some parts of the world. Due to inherent mutability of RNA viruses, it is not surprising that the SARS-CoV-2 genome has been continuously evolving since its emergence. Recently, four functionally distinct variants, B.1.1.7, B.1.351, P.1 and CAL.20C, have been identified, and they appear to more infectious and transmissible than the original (Wuhan-Hu-1) virus. Here we provide evidence based upon a combination of bioinformatics and structural approaches that can explain the higher infectivity of the new variants. Our results show that the greater infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 than SARS-CoV can be attributed to a combination of several factors, including alternate receptors. Additionally, we show that new SARS-CoV-2 variants emerged in the background of D614G in Spike protein and P323L in RNA polymerase. The correlation analyses showed that all mutations in specific variants did not evolve simultaneously. Instead, some mutations evolved most likely to compensate for the viral fitness.","Spratt, Austin N.; Kannan, Saathvik R.; Woods, Lucas T.; Weisman, Gary A.; Quinn, Thomas P.; Lorson, Christian L.; Sönnerborg, Anders; Byrareddy, Siddappa N.; Singh, Kamal",bioRxiv,94,17

Because of their unique specificity and essential role in viral polyprotein processing, these proteases are suitable targets for the development of antiviral drugs. In order to obtain near-equipotent, broad-spectrum antivirals against alphacoronaviruses, betacoronaviruses, and enteroviruses, we pursued a structure-based design of peptidomimetic α-ketoamides as inhibitors of main and 3C proteases. Six crystal structures of protease–inhibitor complexes were determined as part of this study. Compounds synthesized were tested against the recombinant proteases as well as in viral replicons and virus-infected cell cultures; most of them were not cell-toxic. Optimization of the P2 substituent of the α-ketoamides proved crucial for achieving near-equipotency against the three virus genera. The best near-equipotent inhibitors, 11u (P2 = cyclopentylmethyl) and 11r (P2 = cyclohexylmethyl), display low-micromolar EC(50) values against enteroviruses, alphacoronaviruses, and betacoronaviruses in cell cultures. In Huh7 cells, 11r exhibits three-digit picomolar activity against the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus.","Zhang, Linlin; Lin, Daizong; Kusov, Yuri; Nian, Yong; Ma, Qingjun; Wang, Jiang; von Brunn, Albrecht; Leyssen, Pieter; Lanko, Kristina; Neyts, Johan; de Wilde, Adriaan; Snijder, Eric J.; Liu, Hong; Hilgenfeld, Rolf",J Med Chem,94,24

COVID-19 impacted countries worldwide and generated a global crisis resulting in impacts on daily life, however, it’s effect on IFCSA is unknown. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to compare professional perspectives and experiences working with IFCSA with respect to the context of the COVID-19 pandemic within the United States and Israel. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: Participants were therapeutic, child welfare and legal professionals, who provided services to children involved in IFCSA. METHODS: This qualitative cross-cultural comparative study analyzes professional experiences of IFCSA during COVID-19 based on an open-ended questionnaire answered online, with 37 responses from the US and 23 responses from Israel. RESULTS: Findings reveal mostly negative changes in the dynamics of IFCSA families during COVID-19, including financial, environmental, and emotional hardships, as well as some positive changes in the relationships among family members. In terms of professional interventions, concerns were raised that COVID-19 has been detrimental to the disclosure of IFCSA, with plummeting child abuse reports. Further, risk and benefits of transferring to internet based or telephonic therapeutic interventions were shared. CONCLUSIONS: Governmental and community efforts are needed to develop a safety net of protective factors to reduce IFCSA risks and increase resiliency during the COVID-19 pandemic and future global crises. Moreover, enhanced strategies to accessing and supporting families remotely such as using technology could improve identification and response to IFCSA.","Tener, Dafna; Marmor, Amitai; Katz, Carmit; Newman, Abbie; Silovsky, Jane; Shields, Jennifer; Tylor, Erin",Child Abuse Negl,94,21

As such morbidity and mortality vary significantly around the globe between populations and ethnic groups. Underlying medical conditions and environmental factors contribute higher incidence in some populations and a genetic predisposition may play a role for severe cases with respiratory failure. Here we investigated whether genetic variation in the key genes for viral entry to host cells—ACE2 and TMPRSS2—and sensing of viral genomic RNAs (i.e., TLR3/7/8) could explain the variation in incidence across diverse ethnic groups. Overall, these genes are under strong selection pressure and have very few nonsynonymous variants in all populations. Genetic determinant for the binding affinity between SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2 does not show significant difference between populations. Non-genetic factors are likely to contribute differential population characteristics affected by COVID-19. Nonetheless, a systematic mutagenesis study on the receptor binding domain of ACE2 is required to understand the difference in host-viral interaction across populations.","Lee, In-Hee; Lee, Ji-Won; Kong, Sek Won",Infect Genet Evol,94,1

Methods: In this pilot study of hospitalized adult patients (≥18 years of age), with radiologically confirmed pneumonia who were SARS-CoV-2 positive for more than 28 days despite standard care, were assigned to receive standard of care (SOC, grp I) or leflunomide + SOC (grp 2). After 2 weeks, grp 1 and grp 2 patients who continued to be SARS-CoV-2-positive received leflunomide for 14 days while continuing SOC. The primary outcomes were the rate of and time to SARS-CoV-2 clearance and the 14-day and 30-day hospital discharge rate. Results: 12 patients were enrolled in grp 1 and 15 patients were in grp 2. The 14 days SARS-CoV-2 viral clearance rate was 80.0% (12/15) for grp 2 patients receiving leflunomide vs. 16.7% for grp 1 patients (2/12) (p = 0.002). By day 14, the median time to SARS-CoV-2 clearance was 6.0 days (range 1–12, IQR 1–12) for grp 2 patients. In grp 1, two patients converted to viral negative on days 1 and 6 (p = 0.002). The 14-day discharge rate was 73.3% (11/15) for the grp 2 vs. 8.3% (1/12) for grp 1 (p = 0.001). The 30 days discharge rate was 100% (15/15) for the grp 2 vs. 66.7% (8/12) for grp 1. No severe adverse events or deaths were reported. Conclusion: Leflunomide may improve the SARS-CoV-2 clearance rate and discharge rate in patients with refractory COVID-19. The tolerability of the 14–28 days course of treatment with leflunomide is acceptable. These preliminary observations need to be verified by a large sample size and randomized controlled trial.","Wang, Qiang; Guo, Haipeng; Li, Yu; Jian, Xiangdong; Hou, Xinguo; Zhong, Ning; Fei, Jianchun; Su, Dezhen; Bian, Zhouyan; Zhang, Yi; Hu, Yingying; Sun, Yan; Yu, Xueyuan; Li, Yuan; Jiang, Bei; Li, Yan; Qin, Fengping; Wu, Yingying; Gao, Yanxia; Hu, Zhao",Front Pharmacol,94,8
